<text>Theodore Martin McGinley (born May 30, 1958) is an American actor. He is known for his roles as Jefferson D&#x27;Arcy on the television sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, Charley Shanowski on the ABC sitcom &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;, and as Derek on the Apple TV+ comedy drama series &quot;Shrinking&quot;. He was a late regular on &quot;Happy Days&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot; and &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and is known for playing the villainous role of Stan Gable in the film &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; and several made-for-television sequels.

==Early life==
McGinley was born and raised in Newport Beach, California. His paternal grandfather was an Irish immigrant. He played on the water polo team at Newport Harbor High School. McGinley attended the University of Southern California, but after pursuing work as a model, dropped out and moved to New York in 1979.

==Career==
After a casting director spotted a picture of him in &quot;GQ&quot;, McGinley was cast on the comedy series &quot;Happy Days&quot; as Roger Phillips (nephew of the Cunninghams), a role he played from 1980 to 1984. During the run of &quot;Happy Days&quot;, he landed a role in the comedy film &quot;Young Doctors in Love&quot; (1982).

After &quot;Happy Days&quot; ended in 1984, McGinley appeared in &quot;Revenge of the Nerds&quot; where he played Stanley Gable, the head of the jock-run Alpha Beta fraternity and the primary antagonist of the Lambda Lambda Lambda nerd fraternity; he reprised the role in the third and fourth films in the &quot;Nerds&quot; franchise, both produced for television. He went on to appear in regular roles on television series including &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot;. He then played the role of Al Bundy&#x27;s best friend Jefferson D&#x27;Arcy on &quot;Married... with Children&quot; from 1991 to 1997, describing it as a &quot;great, great gig.&quot; He had recurring roles on Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s television series &quot;Sports Night&quot; as Dana&#x27;s boyfriend Gordon, and &quot;The West Wing&quot; as a television news anchor. From 2003 to 2006, he played Charley Shanowski on &quot;Hope &amp; Faith&quot;.

Two years later, he was selected for a role in &quot;Charlie Lawrence&quot;, a situation comedy about a freshman congressman from New Mexico, played by Nathan Lane. McGinley played Graydon Ford, the neighbor of Lane&#x27;s title character, who was a member of the opposing political party. McGinley was also in the pilot for the 2002 CBS show &quot;Life of the Party&quot;, playing a senator.

His guest star roles include series such as &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; (1982), &quot;Hotel&quot; (1985–87), &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (1988), &quot;B.L. Stryker&quot; (1989), &quot;Evening Shade&quot; (1990), &quot;Dream On&quot; (1991), &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot; (1995–96; 1997–98), &quot;The Practice&quot; (2001), and &quot;Justice League&quot; (2002).

During and shortly after the run of &quot;Married … With Children&quot;, McGinley was a part of many films and television films, playing different types of characters. In 1993, he played Mr. Scream in &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot;. That same year, McGinley affected a Southern accent in his role in the miniseries &quot;Wild Justice&quot;, which was poorly received by critics. Some of his television film roles were very dark. In 1996, he was the star of &quot;Deadly Web&quot;, a film that aired on NBC in 1996 and co–starred his wife, Gigi Rice. The film was about a woman who was stalked on the Internet. McGinley played one of his darkest roles in 1998 in the television film &quot;Every Mother&#x27;s Worst Fear&quot;. He played Mitch Carson, a sexual predator who lures a teenage girl into his house, where he holds her captive and tortures her.

In 2008, McGinley became a contestant on the seventh season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, and was paired with pro dancer Inna Brayer. He was the second contestant to be eliminated in the competition.

===&quot;Jumping the Shark&quot;===
McGinley was called &quot;the patron saint of shark-jumping&quot; by jumptheshark.com founder Jon Hein. This is a reference to the several instances McGinley joined popular television programs in their final years, often to replace a departing regular cast member. Hein explains he is not making any comment &quot;on Ted&#x27;s fine acting skills&quot; and furthermore notes that &quot;[McGinley] has a great sense of humor about it, too.&quot; In one episode of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, McGinley himself spoofed this reputation by asking Al Bundy, &quot;Another picture, Captain? I mean, Fonzie? ...Al?&quot; In 2003, McGinley told Melanie McFarland of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun with it. To be honest with you, it&#x27;s meant people are still talking about me. It&#x27;s kind of doing me a favor. And people keep hiring me, so I know that I&#x27;m okay, jumping the shark.&quot;

In 2011, McGinley again made fun of his &quot;shark-jumping&quot; abilities in &quot;Mitefall!&quot;, the final episode of &quot;&quot;. In the episode, Bat-Mite (voiced by Paul Reubens) wants the show to be cancelled to usher in a new TV show called &quot;Beware the Batman&quot;. To that end, he starts replacing aspects of the show, including switching Aquaman&#x27;s regular voice actor, John DiMaggio, with McGinley. Ambush Bug (voiced by McGinley&#x27;s &quot;Happy Days&quot; co-star Henry Winkler) helps to reverse the situation, in part by getting McGinley to break character and leave, forcing DiMaggio&#x27;s voice back into Aquaman.

==Personal life==
McGinley married actress Gigi Rice in 1991 and they have two sons, Beau (born 1994) and Quinn. They reside in Los Angeles.

<doc id="654925" wikidata="Q5467372" url="?curid=654925" title="Forbidden Planet (retail chain)">
<text>Forbidden Planet is the trading name of three separate businesses with online and retail bookstores selling science fiction, fantasy and popular culture products. The original store was opened in London in 1978 named after the 1956 feature film of the same name. Specialising in film and television merchandise, the shops sell comic books, graphic novels, fantasy and horror, manga, DVDs, video games, and a wide variety of co-branded edition/collector&#x27;s items, promotional apparel and merchandise and collector&#x27;s items.

==History==
===Founding===

Forbidden Planet London was the third major comics store in the city, eventually replacing what had been the leading shop, Derek Stokes&#x27;s Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed, which had started in 1969, and coming after Frank and Joan Dobson&#x27;s Weird Fantasy in New Cross. Much of FP&#x27;s growth came after the demise of Dark They Were, and Golden-Eyed, which went out of business in 1981. Mike Lake, Nick Landau, and Mike Luckman founded Forbidden Planet alongside Titan Distributors (Titan having grown out of Comic Media Distributors).
The first Forbidden Planet began life in 1978 as a small store in Denmark Street. Visitors to the store included Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore and Douglas Adams. When Adams attempted to attend a signing for the first &quot;The Hitch-Hiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; book in 1979, the queue to the shop was so long that Adams thought a demonstration was taking place elsewhere. As the scope of the store expanded beyond comics to embrace film and television, a second store was opened just around the corner on St Giles High Street. The store&#x27;s success led to overcrowding, necessitating a move to much larger premises on New Oxford Street. 

=== Expansion ===
The original partners, in addition to improving their London store, opened Forbidden Planet New York in 1981.

Landau, Lake, and Luckman later paired with James Hamilton and Kenny Penman to open other stores. Penman and Hamilton were owners of one of the UK&#x27;s oldest comics and SF stores, Science Fiction Bookshop, in Edinburgh, which had opened under previous owners in 1975.

=== The split ===
In 1992/1993, the original chain split into two firms, called Forbidden Planet and Forbidden Planet Scotland. Landau retained control of the London Forbidden Planet locations, and Lake helped form Forbidden Planet Scotland (later renamed Forbidden Planet International). Luckman, meanwhile, took over ownership of the New York City location.

Forbidden Planet International grew beyond Scotland to include stores throughout the Midlands, in Wales, Northern Ireland, and Ireland.

=== Later developments ===

On 30 September 2003, the London store moved to larger premises at the northern end of Shaftesbury Avenue.

Forbidden Planet opened a second Megastore in Clifton Heights in Bristol in 2005, and a third in Southampton in 2007. In 2006 the company launched forbiddenplanet.com, an e-commerce retail site offering a wide range of products and hosting details of the company&#x27;s many events and signings.

On the evening of 3 December 2023, the Bristol store caught fire; Avon Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that the blaze was not started on purpose. On 30 September 2024 Forbidden Planet confirmed a 7 December 2024 reopening, with a schedule of signings, costumed characters, decorations, and goodie bags.

=== Forbidden Planet NYC ===
The first New York store opened in 1981, located at 56 East 12th Street and Broadway in Greenwich Village. Forbidden Planet NYC was founded by Luckman, with Americans Phil Seuling and Jonnis Levas acting as silent partners. (Luckman by that point had moved to New York and became romantically involved with Levas, who was Seuling&#x27;s partner at Sea Gate Distributors and was his former girlfriend.)

The store had one of the most extensive selections in the world of in-print science fiction and fantasy paperbacks, primarily from major genre labels such as Ballantine, Del Rey, Ace, and so on, but also some small press materials. There were also large and small press magazines, some hardbacks, tie-in toys and merchandise, and comics. They occasionally had book signing appearances by famous authors such as Douglas Adams. The location across the street from the Strand Bookstore and less than a mile from Baird Searles&#x27; The Science Fiction Shop made the area a mecca for genre fans.

An additional New York store opened in the mid-1980s at 227 East 59th Street in Lenox Hill, with a smaller selection. Rising rent led to its closure in the mid-1990s. 

In the 1990s, the primary New York store moved across the street to a significantly smaller space at 840 Broadway and East 13th Street, and the focus became comic books and graphic novels, with a greatly diminished selection of traditional fiction.
On 24 July 2012, the New York City store moved several doors south to 832 Broadway, where it would enjoy 3,400 square feet of retail space. The New York store is not part of Forbidden Planet International, as they are owned by rival organizations.

Like many shops, Forbidden Planet struggled during the COVID-19 pandemic. The New York branch launched a GoFundMe to survive, in light of the city&#x27;s high rent.

<text>Laura San Giacomo (born November 14, 1961 or 1962) is an American actress. She played Cynthia in the film &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot; (1989) for which she won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female, Kit De Luca in the film &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990), Crazy Cora in the film &quot;Quigley Down Under&quot; (1990), Nadine Cross in &quot;The Stand&quot; (1994), and Maya Gallo on the sitcom &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; (1997–2003). A BAFTA and two-time Golden Globe Award nominee, she played the regular role of Rhetta Rodriguez on the drama &quot;Saving Grace&quot; (2007–2010), and the recurring role of Dr. Grace Confalone on the drama &quot;NCIS&quot; (2016–2024).

==Early life and education==
San Giacomo, an Italian-American, was born November 14, 1961 or 1962, in West Orange, New Jersey, the daughter of MaryJo and John San Giacomo, a paper mill owner. She grew up in Denville Township, New Jersey, and discovered acting while attending Morris Knolls High School. In 1984, she received a fine arts degree, specializing in acting, from Carnegie Mellon School of Drama in Pittsburgh.

==Career==
After graduating, she moved to New York. San Giacomo then went on to appear in several theater productions, including the Garry Marshall–Lowell Ganz production of &quot;Wrong Turn at Lungfish&quot; in Los Angeles, the Princeton/McCarter Theatre production of &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, and off-Broadway in &quot;Beirut&quot;. She starred in &quot;Italian American Reconciliation&quot;, regional productions of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; as well as &quot;Crimes of the Heart&quot;. In a review of the Walnut Street Theatre 1986 presentation of &quot;As You Like It&quot;, San Giacomo received a special mention: &quot;although doll-like Laura San Giacomo had only a minor role as a wilful shepherdess, she sank her fangs into it and received the only show-interrupting applause of the evening.&quot;

===Early career===
San Giacomo&#x27;s first television appearances were four episodes on three television series during 1987. Two notable appearances were in &quot;Crime Story&quot; in 1988 for the episode &quot;Protected Witness&quot; (season 2/episode 13) as Theresa Farantino and in &quot;Miami Vice&quot; in 1989 for the episode &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; (season 5, episode 21) as Tania Lewis. The &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode also featured a guest appearance by her future husband, actor Cameron Dye, one year before their marriage. Previously, she was featured on the daytime soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; as Louisa Sanchez, the Latina common-law wife of Mitch Beck (Brian Fitzpatrick) whose presence threatened to thwart his relationship with Hillary Martin (Carmen Thomas).

San Giacomo first drew international attention in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape&quot; (1989), which was her film debut as a credited actor (in the 1988 movie &quot;Miles from Home&quot;, her role as Sandy was not credited). Her work in the film was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and she received a Los Angeles Film Critics Association New Generation Award. The film was honored with the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s prestigious Palme d&#x27;Or.

In 1990, San Giacomo played a supporting role as Julia Roberts&#x27;s character&#x27;s wisecracking roommate Kit De Luca in &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;. The film generated $178 million at the box office.

San Giacomo also has appeared in &quot;Quigley Down Under&quot; (1990), &quot;Vital Signs&quot; (1990), &quot;Under Suspicion&quot; (1991), &quot;Once Around&quot; (1991), &quot;Where the Day Takes You&quot; (1992), &quot;Nina Takes a Lover&quot; (1994), and &quot;Suicide Kings&quot; (1997). She also appeared as Nadine Cross in the Stephen King miniseries &quot;The Stand&quot; with Rob Lowe, which landed them on the cover of the May 7–13, 1994 issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot;. She continued doing films, and as 1999 ended, she did the film &quot;Eat Your Heart Out&quot;. In 2001, San Giacomo landed the starring role in the Jenifer Estess bio-pic &quot;Jenifer&quot;.

San Giacomo did voice work for the animated series &quot;Gargoyles&quot; (as the character of Fox). However, she went uncredited for the role because her agent believed it would damage her reputation to have worked on an animated series.

===&quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;===

Needing to work, but not wanting to be away from her newborn son for months at a time, San Giacomo shifted to television in the role of hot-tempered, sassy journalist Maya Gallo in &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; (1997–2003). Her character was partially based on an unproduced idea that executive producer Steven Levitan once had in mind for actress Janeane Garofalo when he was a writer for &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;. San Giacomo was cast in the starring role because the series was meant to center on her character; however, the show soon adopted an ensemble style. Despite the shift in focus, San Giacomo remained an integral part of the show, and she received top billing. She and the four other main cast members appeared in all 148 episodes of the series, which lasted until 2003.

San Giacomo&#x27;s work during season 2 (1997–1998) earned her a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1998 for Best Actress in a Television Comedy or Musical.

===Post-&quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; and appearances===
After NBC cancelled &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; in 2003, San Giacomo appeared sporadically on television and in films. She made guest appearances on several television series, including the short-lived crime drama &quot;The Handler&quot; in 2003 and &quot;Unscripted&quot; in 2005. She was the narrator for the series &quot;Snapped: Killer Couples&quot;. San Giacomo also appeared in the 2005 films &quot;Checking Out&quot; and &quot;Havoc&quot; as well as the 2006 film &quot;Conquistadora&quot;. San Giacomo was to have made her return to television on The WB&#x27;s new drama &quot;Related&quot; in 2005, but the character was recast due to creative differences. Kiele Sanchez took her place as Anne Sorelli on the show. San Giacomo also made few public appearances; she made her first public appearance in nearly a year on 19 October 2005 at the 15th Annual Environmental Media Awards. She made two more public appearances at the Crystal and Lucy Awards on 6 June 2006 and at the 3rd Annual Alfred Mann Foundation Innovation and Inspiration Gala on 9 September 2006.

In 2006, San Giacomo returned to network television with three guest appearances on the third season of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;. She reunited with Enrico Colantoni from &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot;, playing Harmony Chase. Both Colantoni and San Giacomo enjoyed their reunion so much that they lobbied for their characters to appear together in more episodes.

In September 2006, San Giacomo secured her first starring role on a television program after &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; when she reunited with fellow Carnegie-Mellon alum Holly Hunter in the series &quot;Saving Grace&quot;. San Giacomo played Grace&#x27;s best friend Rhetta Rodriguez.

In June 2010, San Giacomo guest-starred in the episode titled &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; on the series &quot;In Plain Sight&quot;. She played a woman from an organized crime family with a terminal illness. In December 2011, San Giacomo appeared on the episode titled &quot;Beards&quot; on &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; as Caroline, Melanie&#x27;s estranged sister.

== Personal life ==
San Giacomo has been married twice. Her first marriage (1990–1998) was to actor Cameron Dye, with whom she had a son, Mason, who was born with cerebral palsy. In 2000, she remarried, to actor Matt Adler. She is a cousin of Torry Castellano, former drummer of the rock group The Donnas.

She lives in the San Fernando Valley, California.

==Philanthropy==
San Giacomo has been honored by the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy and Developmental Medicine, by Media Access for a TV public service announcement on &quot;Inclusive Education&quot; (in &quot;The More You Know&quot;), by Shane&#x27;s Inspiration with its Humanitarian Award, and &quot;Redbook&#x27;s&quot; Mother and Shaker Award. She has been a keynote speaker at various conferences for TASH and CalTASH, which promote an inclusive society, and at two conferences sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education, and at the Young Neuroscientists&#x27; Workshop for the Children&#x27;s Neurobiological Solutions Foundation (now the Pediatric Brain Foundation).

In 2021, she was listed as the board secretary of the international wheelchair-charity Momentum Wheels for Humanity, and honorary chair of the Environment of People Foundation, Inc., a charity promoting music opportunities for children.

<doc id="654933" wikidata="Q469273" url="?curid=654933" title="Jaimee Foxworth">
<text>Jaimee Monae Foxworth (born December 17, 1979) is an American actress, model, and singer. She is best known for her role of Judy Winslow, the daughter of Carl and Harriette Winslow on the ABC sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot;, during the show&#x27;s first four seasons.

==Career==
Foxworth, who began modeling at the age of five, soon appeared in national television advertisements, and ultimately landed the role of Judy Winslow, the youngest of the Winslow family&#x27;s three children, on the long-running sitcom &quot;Family Matters.&quot; After the introduction of Steve Urkel (Jaleel White), Foxworth&#x27;s scenes on the show were reduced significantly. The combination of the character having little to do on the show and budget cuts caused producers to eliminate her from the series after its fourth season. The character disappeared without explanation, with the Winslows acknowledging only two children: Eddie (Darius McCrary) and Laura (Kellie Shanygne Williams). Jo Marie Payton, who played matriarch Harriette Winslow, was particularly upset with Foxworth&#x27;s dismissal, stating that producers had decided &quot;nobody would notice&quot; Judy was gone. 

With very little acting work coming in the years after &quot;Family Matters&quot;, Foxworth formed an R&amp;B musical group, S.H.E., with her two sisters (Tyren Perry and Jania Perry). They released their debut album &quot;3&#x27;s a Charm&quot; on July 1, 1997, through Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s T.W.IsM./Interscope Records. From 2000 to 2002, she worked in the adult industry, making pornographic films under the pseudonym Crave.

== Personal life ==
Foxworth battled substance abuse and depression. It was rumored that this was prompted in part by a judge&#x27;s ruling that her trust fund of more than $500,000 be used to save her family from bankruptcy, but she denied this in a 2009 interview, stating, &quot;I think [that came] from the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. We never filed for bankruptcy. We were almost to the point where we were just completely flat broke but we never filed for bankruptcy.&quot;

In 2009, &quot;People&quot; magazine reported that Foxworth and longtime boyfriend Michael Shaw had a child.

In Fall 2009, the TV One series &quot;Life After&quot; chronicled Foxworth&#x27;s story, dealing with her departure from &quot;Family Matters&quot;, and her subsequent use of marijuana, which she claimed to have stopped smoking. Also, during the show, her newborn son was shown.

<text>Samuel (de) Sorbière (; 17 September 1615 – 9 April 1670) was a French physician and man of letters, a philosopher and translator, who is best known for his promotion of the works of Thomas Hobbes and Pierre Gassendi, in whose view of physics he placed his support, though unable to refute René Descartes, but who developed a reputation in his own day for a truculent and disputatious nature. Sorbière is regarded often by his position on ethics and disclosure about medical mistakes. In 1672 Sorbière considered the idea of being honest and upfront about a mistake having been made in medicine but thought that it might seriously jeopardise medical practice and concluded that it &quot;would not catch on&quot;.

==Life==
After relocating to the Netherlands, he published a French translation of Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; in 1643. He arranged for the publication of Hobbes&#x27;s &quot;De Cive&quot; in Amsterdam in 1647, published a French translation in 1649, published a French translation of Hobbes&#x27; &quot;De Corpore Politico, or the Elements of Law&quot; in 1652, and helped secure a publisher for Hobbes&#x27;s own Latin translation of &quot;Leviathan&quot; in 1668. His collected &quot;Lettres et discours de M. de Sorbière, sur diverses matières curieuses&quot;, published in Paris, 1660, are imbued with the spirit of compromise, reconciling science and theology and separating science from metaphysics. His life of Gassendi was prefixed to the collected edition of Gassendi&#x27;s writings, 1658. Besides Gassendi and Hobbes, he corresponded with Marin Mersenne, François de La Mothe Le Vayer and other prominent thinkers of the day.

In 1663–1664, Sorbière visited England, where in 1663 he was inducted into the Royal Society. In 1664 he published an account of his stay, &quot;Relation d&#x27;un voyage en Angleterre, où sont touchées plusieurs choses, qui regardent l&#x27;estat des sciences, et de la religion&quot; (L. Billaine, Paris), in which he offered his comments on how bad the food was, how bad the inns were and imputed to the Royal Society the intention of developing a library. This provoked Thomas Sprat (then spokesman for and historian of the Society) to publish &quot;Observations upon Monsieur de Sorbier&#x27;s Voyage into England&quot; (London, 1665) as a reply to Sorbière&#x27;s perceived insults against both English culture and the Society in particular. In order to avoid further international controversy, Sorbière was held under arrest for four months in France, and Charles II of England prohibited any further responses.

Sorbière&#x27;s conversion from Calvinism to Catholicism, which opened a career to him, has been interpreted in a political light.

<doc id="654945" wikidata="Q527916" url="?curid=654945" title="Cagney &amp; Lacey">
<text>Cagney &amp; Lacey was an American police procedural drama television series that aired on the CBS television network for seven seasons from March 25, 1982, to May 16, 1988. The show is about two New York City police detectives who lead very different lives: Christine Cagney (Sharon Gless) is a career-minded single woman, while Mary Beth Lacey (Tyne Daly) is a married working mother. The series is set in a fictionalized version of Manhattan&#x27;s 14th Precinct (known as &quot;Midtown South&quot;). The pilot movie had Loretta Swit in the role of Cagney, while the first six episodes had Meg Foster in the role. When the show was revived for a full-season run, Gless portrayed the role for six consecutive years. Each year during that time, one of the two lead actresses won the Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama (four wins for Daly, two for Gless), a winning streak matched only once since in any major category by a show.

==Development==
Producer Barney Rosenzweig was influenced by the feminist movement through his then-girlfriend Barbara Corday, who recommended to him Molly Haskell&#x27;s book &quot;From Reverence to Rape&quot; which analyses depictions of women in film. Haskell&#x27;s book claimed there had never been a female buddy film, and Rosenzweig sought to make one, a comedy initially titled &quot;Newman &amp; Redford&quot; (before changing the title for legal reasons). Corday and Barbara Avedon wrote the script. No studio wanted to make the film, so Corday considered taking it to television. Rosenzweig took the script, removed the main plot (leaving only the character development), and took it to all networks, but only CBS was interested.

==Cast==
* Loretta Swit (pilot movie), Meg Foster (season 1) and Sharon Gless (seasons 2–7) as Detective/Sergeant Christine Cagney
* Tyne Daly as Detective Mary Beth Lacey
* Al Waxman as Lieutenant Albert Samuels
* John Karlen as Harvey Lacey, Sr.
* Carl Lumbly as Detective/Sergeant Marcus Petrie (seasons 1–6; guest season 7)
* Martin Kove as Detective Victor Isbecki
* Sidney Clute as Detective Paul LaGuardia (seasons 1–4)
* Barry Primus as Sergeant Dory McKenna (season 4; guest season 2)
* Harvey Atkin as Desk Sergeant Ronald Coleman (seasons 5–7; recurring seasons 1–4)

* Paul Mantee as Detective Al Corassa (seasons 5–7)
* Robert Hegyes as Detective Manny Esposito (seasons 6–7)
* Merry Clayton as Detective Verna Dee Jordan (season 7)

Actress Loretta Swit played the role of Christine Cagney in the original television movie (October 1981), but was forced to decline the role in the series when the producers of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; refused to let her out of her contract. When the movie was picked up as a series, first airing with six episodes as a midseason replacement in the spring of 1982, Meg Foster portrayed the character. When the show was picked up for a regular season in 1982, Foster was replaced with Sharon Gless because CBS deemed Foster too aggressive and too likely to be perceived as a lesbian by the viewers.

CBS executives hoped Gless would portray Cagney as more feminine and attempted to pressure the producers to remake Christine into a more &quot;high-class&quot;, snobbish woman from wealthy parents. The pilot had portrayed Cagney as an ex-glamour model. Barney Rosenzweig and Barbara Corday initially refused to change Cagney from a tough, witty, working-class woman. Shortly into Gless&#x27;s tenure on the program, Rosenzweig and Corday compromised with the network brass. They further developed Cagney&#x27;s background, explaining gradually in a loose storyline that she may have been born to a somewhat well-to-do professional mother, Maureen, who had a relationship with police officer Charles Cagney (Dick O&#x27;Neill), who came from working-class roots. They separated soon after Christine and her brother Brian (David Ackroyd) were born. She was partially raised in an uptown Westchester world, which she appreciated; however, the trappings of the upper-middle social strata sometimes drove her to miss her father&#x27;s lifestyle, and she and her father therefore established a special bond.

Cagney was a bit quieter and more reserved than her vivacious, talkative, loud partner Mary Beth Lacey, but could still relate to the world with attitudes that could be shared by people across the social spectrum.

==Synopsis==
Al Waxman co-starred as Cagney and Lacey&#x27;s good-natured and sometimes blustery supervisor, Lt. Bert Samuels. Carl Lumbly and Martin Kove played fellow detectives Marcus Petrie and Victor Isbecki. Sidney Clute played veteran detective Paul LaGuardia. John Karlen co-starred as Mary Beth&#x27;s husband, Harvey Lacey, and Tony La Torre and Troy Slaten played their sons Harvey Lacey Jr. and Michael Lacey. Harvey Atkin played desk sergeant Ronald Coleman. Jason Bernard had the recurring role of Deputy Inspector Marquette during the first two seasons. When the show was brought back in March 1984, Marquette had been replaced by Dep. Inspector Knelman (Michael Fairman), who lasted the rest of the series. In the fourth season, Christine entered a relationship with Sgt. Dory McKenna (Barry Primus), who battled drug addiction. After a tumultuous courtship, Christine left him and soon after took up with a more stable suitor, attorney David Keeler (Stephen Macht).

On October 2, 1985, Clute died of cancer at age 69. He had completed filming a few episodes of the 1985–86 season. Det. LaGuardia&#x27;s disappearance from the show was explained by saying he had retired from the 14th Precinct and moved to New Jersey with a new female companion less than half his age. To honor Clute, the producers kept his name in the opening credits for the rest of the series. 

LaGuardia was replaced in the fifth season with Det. Jonah Newman (Dan Shor), a boyish ingenu with an elevated sense of himself. Newman, while popular with the guys, was not above stepping on anyone in order to get the coveted promotion of Detective Second Grade. As a result, Chris and Mary Beth had a strained relationship with him. Newman developed a crush on Chris but she never knew. Eventually, Newman was partnered with veteran Al Corassa (Paul Mantee), who became a regular midway through season five (Mantee had made three guest appearances in late 1985, in which his character&#x27;s name was Det. Thomas in the first two episodes, and Corassa in the third) and took up the role of experienced cop that LaGuardia had vacated. Their partnership met a sad end in May 1986, when Newman was killed by a random gunshot outside of the local district court, just after receiving his promotion to Second Grade.

The beginning of the sixth season saw the arrival of Manny Esposito (Robert Hegyes), a young, street-savvy detective who became Corassa&#x27;s new partner. There was quite a clash between the two, as Esposito&#x27;s freewheeling lifestyle (represented by his casual dress on the job, the desire to make a quick buck, and three ex-wives) put him in contrast with Corassa, the older, more conservative family man with a heightened sense of professionalism. Supporting characters added to the precinct at this time were rookie Officer Tom Basil (Barry Laws) and Officer Beverley Faverty (Beverley Faverty). The following year, Petrie was promoted to sergeant and then departed the 14th Precinct (Carl Lumbly had decided to leave the series). In his place, singer Merry Clayton joined the cast as Verna Dee Jordan, the first new female detective at the precinct since the additions of Cagney and Lacey. Jordan had joined law enforcement in middle age to better herself, after having been a single mother raising four children (now grown) on welfare.

Dick O&#x27;Neill played a recurring role as Cagney&#x27;s alcoholic father, Charlie Cagney, a former NYPD officer who regaled her with stories of the old days; Christine later fought alcoholism as well. In the fourth season, Mary Beth becomes pregnant; she and Harvey welcome in a baby daughter, Alice Christine, in the fall of 1985. Alice Lacey was played by alternating twins Dana &amp; Paige Bardolph from 1985 to 1987, with toddler Michelle Sepe taking over for the seventh season.

==Cancellation and return==

&quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; premiered in March 1982 with high hopes from the industry, in the wake of the TV movie. Reviews of the series, however, with Meg Foster in place of Loretta Swit, were mixed. Critics praised the level of storytelling, but put emphasis on the aggressiveness that both Daly and Foster expressed with their characters. As soon as the six-episode order was finished in late April, CBS canceled the program due to poor ratings. Executive producer Barney Rosenzweig was determined to reverse the network&#x27;s decision. Sharon Gless had been initially unavailable for the movie and series, which were produced by Orion, because of her long-running contract to Universal Television (she was the last actress ever to be signed to a long-term contract with a studio, in 1972). Gless was even actively utilizing her Universal contract at the time the series went into production, having taken over as female lead (from Lynn Redgrave who left the series in a dispute with producers) on the CBS sitcom &quot;House Calls&quot;. Rumors were also rampant that &quot;House Calls&quot; was getting the axe that spring.

Before the unveiling of that year&#x27;s network upfronts, a CBS executive told the press that the network had cancelled &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; because of low ratings but also the jarringly tough nature of the female leads, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ve perceived them as dykes&quot;. This remark drew wide protest, and put Rosenzweig into high gear in his dealings with CBS. The cancellation of &quot;House Calls&quot; was announced among insider circles just before upfronts, and Rosenzweig pressured CBS executives to relaunch &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; in the fall with Gless replacing Foster. Gless met with &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; producers again to consider the role, but while always having taken to the character, had doubts about joining for the fall of 1982 because, after &quot;House Calls&quot;, she &quot;didn&#x27;t want to make a career of replacing actresses&quot;.

Ratings were still low during the first year Daly and Gless co-starred on the series. &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; was canceled by CBS a second time in May 1983, but after almost a year of decreased buzz about the show, an ever-larger public outcry exploded upon the series&#x27;s axing. Fans of the show, organized by Rosenzweig, staged a letter-writing campaign. At the same time, CBS switched its time slot for what was to have been its final three months on the air during summer reruns. This relocation resulted in the ratings suddenly rising. The viewer protest, coupled with the post-cancellation improvement in the Nielsens and the Emmy nomination that year (which Tyne Daly won in September), resulted in success for the public. That fall, CBS announced the return of &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; as a mid-season entry. The network would have wanted to return it sooner, but not long after the second cancelation came to pass, the sets at Orion had already been destroyed, and the cast had been let out of their contracts. One cast member, Tony La Torre, had already joined another series, the ABC sitcom &quot;9 to 5&quot;. When nearly all of the &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; cast received new contracts in late 1983, La Torre returned as well after &quot;9 to 5&quot; was canceled by ABC just weeks into the 1983–84 season. &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; went back into production in January 1984 and returned to air on March 19 of that year.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; celebrated the show&#x27;s return with the cover reading &quot;Welcome Back, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; – You want them! You&#x27;ve got them!&quot;. The show finished in the top 10 for the 1983–84 season, and went on to earn 36 Emmy Award nominations and 14 wins throughout its run until 1988, including six nominations each for stars Daly and Gless: four wins for Daly and two for Gless. The series itself won two consecutive Emmy Awards for Best Drama Series in 1985 and 1986. The show&#x27;s ratings leveled out to where it hovered around 30th place in the Nielsens during seasons four to six, a period where many state the show to have been in its creative peak.

The series continued to air Monday nights at 10:00p.m. EST/9:00p.m. CST until the middle of the 1987–88 season, holding its own against ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; and &quot;NBC Monday Night at the Movies&quot;. Midway through its seventh season, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; was moved to Tuesdays at 10:00p.m. EST/9:00p.m. CST, where it began to compete against &quot;Thirtysomething&quot; (ABC) and &quot;Crime Story&quot; (NBC). &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; lost viewers to the first-year critical success of &quot;thirtysomething&quot;, which, despite being the time slot winner, only ranked No. 45 overall. CBS&#x27; reason for relocating &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; was because it was believed that its Monday slot would further build an audience for &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, another new critical hit of the season that had average ratings at best. By the end of the season, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; was left at 53rd place, and the 20-point drop from the previous season was enough for CBS to have doubts about renewing the show. With the final episode of the seventh season ending on a cliffhanger, CBS was considering bringing the show back, but when May 1988 upfronts were released, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;″s cancellation was confirmed. For the summer of 1988, the series moved one last time, not back to its familiar Monday time slot, but to Thursdays at 10 pm EST/9 CST. The series garnered considerable popularity internationally. It was originally shown in the UK on BBC1, where it regularly made the top 10.

==Theme music==
The main titles for the first season are accompanied by the theme song &quot;Ain&#x27;t That the Way&quot; by Michael Stull, sung by Marie Cain, and shows the two lead characters being promoted to plainclothes detectives and later disguised as prostitutes. This was replaced the following season by an instrumental theme composed by Bill Conti set to a collage of action and comical scenes featuring the characters from the series.

==After the series==

The series was followed by four television films which reunite the characters Christine Cagney and Mary Beth Lacey. In the storyline, Cagney has been promoted to Lieutenant, and is now working at the District Attorney&#x27;s office as a special investigator. Lacey, meanwhile, has retired from the police force. However, at Cagney&#x27;s urging (and partly due to Mary Beth&#x27;s strained financial circumstances), Mary Beth agrees to work for the D.A.&#x27;s office as well, thereby reuniting the old partnership.

John Karlen appears in all four movies as Harvey Lacey, as does Molly Orr playing Harvey and Mary Beth&#x27;s school-age daughter Alice (who was seen as an infant in various series episodes). Making cameos in the first movie only are series regulars Martin Kove as Isbecki, Al Waxman as Lt. Samuels, Carl Lumbly as Marcus Petrie, Vonetta McGee as Claudia Petrie, Robert Hegyes as Esposito, and Paul Mantee as Corassa. Also seen in the first two films are James Naughton as Christine&#x27;s husband James Burton (they soon were divorced), and David Paymer as Deputy D.A. Feldberg.

*&quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: The Return&quot; (1994)
*&quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: Together Again&quot; (1995)
*&quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: The View Through the Glass Ceiling&quot; (1995)
*&quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: True Convictions&quot; (1996)

Following the conclusion of &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless have reunited onscreen three times: all three times playing different characters. Daly guest-starred in an episode of Gless&#x27;s 1990 series &quot;The Trials of Rosie O&#x27;Neill&quot;; Gless then guest-starred in 2003 on an episode of Daly&#x27;s TV series &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, while Daly appeared in 2010 in an episode of Gless&#x27;s series &quot;Burn Notice&quot;.

===In popular culture===
In the television show &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, Lieutenant Terry Jeffords&#x27; twin daughters are named Cagney and Lacey.

===Home media===
On May 8, 2007, MGM Home Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released Season 1 of &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The release coincided with the 25th anniversary of the series and it features the first full season of the show (which is actually the second season of the series) when Sharon Gless joined the cast as Cagney.

The quartet of TV movies entitled &quot;The Menopause Years&quot; was released in 2009 by S&#x27;more Entertainment. The deluxe set contains the complete collection of post-series TV movies. In addition, one of the features, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: The Return&quot;, was released separately on the same day. As of 2012, these releases have been discontinued and are out of print.

In November 2012, Visual Entertainment released &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1. The 32-disc set contains all episodes of the series featuring Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless (seasons 2–7). They also released a separate season 2 release on the same day.

A separate collection only available to purchase online, entitled &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey – 30th Anniversary Limited Edition&quot; was released on November 27, 2012. This 38-disc set contains all the content from the &quot;Complete Series&quot; set as well as the pilot episode, the complete first season with Meg Foster as Cagney and Tyne Daly as Lacey, all four post-series &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey: The Menopause Years&quot; made-for-TV movies and special bonus features exclusive to this collection, such as an autographed photo from Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly, an audiobook of Barney Rosenzweig&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey ... and Me&quot; An Inside Hollywood Story OR How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Blonde&quot;, and footage of the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; 30th Anniversary Event from London. The Limited Edition DVD set is available through the official &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; website.

===Downloads===
Since October 2009, all 125 episodes of &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; have been available as a digital download on iTunes in the UK and North America and were also licensed to Netflix for American viewers via the streaming option, which expired in April 2012, and is no longer available. In 2011, the four post-series telefilms were also added to the streaming option after they were licensed to Netflix partner Starz. That partnership ended in February 2012, and the telefilms ceased to run on Netflix streaming.

===Aborted reboot===
In January 2018, CBS ordered a pilot for a reboot of the series. In March, Sarah Drew and Michelle Hurd were cast as Cagney and Lacey, respectively, with Bridget Carpenter writing the pilot and Rosemary Rodriguez directing. Ving Rhames was cast in the role of police Captain Stark. CBS passed on the pilot on May 11.

<text>The Caterham 7 (or Caterham Seven) is a super-lightweight sports car produced by Caterham Cars in the United Kingdom. It is based on the Lotus Seven, a lightweight sports car sold in kit and factory-built form by Lotus Cars, from 1957 to 1972.

After Lotus ended production of the Lotus Seven, Caterham bought the rights to the design, and today make both kits and fully assembled cars. The modern Caterham Seven is based on the Series 3 Lotus Seven, though developed to the point that no part is the same as on the original Lotus.

Various other manufacturers offer a sports car in a similar basic configuration, but Caterham owns various legal rights to the Lotus Seven design and name. The company has taken legal action in the past in order to protect those rights, although in South Africa, it lost its case against Birkin on the basis that it never obtained the claimed rights from Lotus.

==History==
Colin Chapman had been a Royal Air Force pilot, studied structural engineering, and went on to become one of the great innovators in motorsports design and founded Lotus Engineering Ltd. His vision of light, powerful cars and performance suspensions guided much of his development work with the basic design philosophy of, &quot;Simplify, then add lightness&quot;. His Lotus 7 had its debut at the 1957 Earl&#x27;s Court Motor Show in London. They were priced at £1,036 including purchase tax but it cost only £536 in kit form as no purchase tax was required. It weighed only . Fast and responsive, the Lotus 7 was one of Chapman&#x27;s masterworks, an advanced machine that surpassed the earlier Lotus 6 as a vehicle that could perform well on the track and be driven legally on the road.

In 1973, Lotus decided to shed its kit car image and concentrate on limited series motor racing cars and up-market sports cars. As part of this plan, it sold the rights to the Seven to its only remaining agents, Caterham Cars in England and Steel Brothers Limited in New Zealand. At the time the current production car was the Series 4, but when Caterham ran out of the Lotus Series 4 kits in 1974 they introduced its own version of the Series 3, as the Caterham Seven. The modern-day Road sports and Superlights (in &quot;narrow-bodied chassis&quot; form) are the direct descendants of this car and therefore of the original Lotus 7.

===Chassis and suspension===

As with the Lotus Mark VI before it, the original Lotus Seven used an extremely light space-frame chassis with stressed aluminium body panels. Although the chassis has had numerous modifications to strengthen it and accommodate the various engine and suspension setups (and to try to find more cockpit space for the occupants), this basic formula has remained essentially the same throughout the Seven&#x27;s life (with the exception of the Series 4, which used steel for the cockpit and engine bay and glassfibre for the bodywork). Early cars used a live rear axle, initially from various Fords, later from the Morris Ital. De Dion rear suspension was introduced in the mid-1980s and both geometries were on offer until 2002 when the live-axle option was phased out (though later reintroduced for the 160/165 and 170/Super Seven 600 versions). Late 90s and early 2000s versions (such as the Superlight) employed adjustable double-wishbone suspension with front anti-roll bar and a de-Dion rear axle, located by an A-frame and Watt&#x27;s linkage.

The Caterham 7 range was based exclusively on this Series 3 chassis until 2000, when the SV (Series V, or Special Vehicle) chassis was released, aimed at accommodating the increasing number of prospective buyers who could not fit comfortably in the Series 3 cockpit. The SV chassis offers an extra of width across the cockpit, at a cost of of extra weight, and both chassis sizes are available today in earlier Superlight and current 360, 420, 620 and Super Seven 2000 configurations, though only the S3 chassis is offered on the 170 and Super Seven 600. The SV chassis subsequently provided the basic dimensions for the Caterham CSR. The suspension was completely redesigned, bringing the front suspension inboard, using pushrods, and replacing the De-Dion rear axle with a lighter, fully independent, double-wishbone layout with new coil/damper units. Additional chassis modifications resulted in a 25% increase in torsional stiffness. The CSR was released in October 2004, with a Cosworth Duratec engine and was available from the factory in either or form.

===Engines===

==== Lotus TwinCam ====
Early cars used the Lotus TwinCam engine (subsequently manufactured by Vegantune), followed by Ford crossflow engines. The first Cosworth BDR engines appeared around 1983, in 1600 cc form, followed by 1700 cc versions three years later. 

==== Vauxhall ====
By 1990 the top of the range engine had become the two-litre Vauxhall HPC, as fitted to the Vauxhall Calibra, putting out 165–175 bhp. A few HPC &quot;Evolution&quot; models were built with engines developed by Swindon Race Engines producing between and . In 1993 Caterham created the JPE special edition (named for Formula 1 driver Jonathan Palmer) by using a two-litre Vauxhall Touring Car engine, putting out around and reducing weight to around by such measures as removing the windscreen in favour of an aeroscreen. The JPE was quoted at 0–60 mph times of around 3.5 seconds and, with Jonathan Palmer at the wheel, set a 0–100 mph-0 record of 12.6 seconds. Around 1997 the cross flow range was replaced by 8v and 16v Vauxhall units which, in various guises lived on until the end of the VX-powered Caterham Classic, in 2002.

==== Rover ====
The Rover K-series made its appearance in 1991, initially as the 1.4-litre engine from the Metro GTi. This engine became the backbone of the range for the next 15 years. The 1.6-litre K-series appeared in 1996 and the 1.8-litre a year later. 1996 also saw the addition of the &#x27;Superlight&#x27; range, a range that successfully focussed initially on reducing weight and subsequently on the bespoke tuning of the K-series to ever-higher outputs. Weight was saved by removing the spare wheel (and carrier), carpets, heater, and often the windscreen (replaced with an aeroscreen), hood, and doors. Lightweight &quot;Tillet&quot; GRP seats were usually fitted along with carbon-fibre front wings and nosecone (note however that items such as heaters and windscreens could still be specified by the Superlight customer if they so wanted). The wide-track suspension was added to the superlight, increasing the track at the front to match that at the back. The later Superlight-R offered the dry-sumped VHPD (Very High-Performance Derivative) variant on the 1.8-litre K-series. Output was now up to around , in a car that now weighed as little as . 

Three years later Caterham took the same concept to a new level and created the iconic Superlight R500, still based on the Rover 1.8-litre K-series but now tuned (by Minister Racing Engines) to around at 8,600 rpm in a car weighing just . The R500 was initially available in kit-form but quickly became a factory-build only item. Quoted performance figures still make impressive reading; 0–100 mph in 8.2 seconds (although EVO magazine quotes 8.8 seconds). Perhaps unsurprisingly, such a stressed engine required frequent &quot;refreshing&quot; in order to keep it on the road and a series of engine revisions were undertaken throughout the R500&#x27;s life in order to increase reliability. This culminated in 2004 with perhaps the most extreme production Caterham of all; the R500 EVO was bored out by Minister to 1,998 cc and delivered . At £42,000, the R500 EVO sold poorly; it is believed that just three were sold. It did, however, succeed in setting a series of performance car benchmarks several of which last to this day; the 0–100 mph-0 record was set at 10.73 seconds (in second place was a Ferrari Enzo costing ten times as much) and, until the end of 2006 it remained the fastest production car timed by EVO magazine around the Bedford Autodrome West Circuit, ahead of a Porsche Carrera GT. Only the Radical SR3 1300 has subsequently posted a faster time than the R500 EVO.

==== Ford ====
After the demise of Rover and Powertrain, Caterham started the process of phasing out the Rover K-series engine and replacing them with Ford engines; the Sigma engine for Road sports and later 270 and 310 models, and the 2.0-litre and 2.3-litre Duratec engines for the more powerful Superlight, CSR, 360, 420, 620 and Super Seven 2000 ranges.

Caterham has had a somewhat tentative relationship with the installation of motorbike engines into their cars. Since 2000, a Canadian firm has been selling Caterham 7 models using the GSXR1300 engine used in the Suzuki Hayabusa. It reportedly does 0–62 in under 3 seconds. In 2000 the Honda CBR1100 engine was installed into a superlight chassis to create the Caterham Blackbird, delivering at 10,750 rpm (although just of maximum torque). The Blackbird offered near R500 performance for rather less money (Top Gear quote 0–60 of 3.7 seconds and a top speed of at a new cost of £25,750). In 2001 a Honda Fireblade engine was offered in a live-axle chassis, via James Whiting of Ashford, Middlesex. Quoted power was at 10,500 rpm. Both of these models have ceased production. There has also been at least one installation of the RST-V8, created by Moto Power; a 2-litre, 40 valve V8 made from a pair of motorcycle engines joined at the crank. An early, pre-production review of the car/engine combination exists on the EVO website. In Feb 2008, the &quot;Caterham 7 Levante&quot; was announced, featuring a supercharged version the RST-V8, offering over , installed in a modified Caterham chassis, with bespoke bodywork. Made by RS Performance (described in the press release as &quot;Caterham&#x27;s new performance arm&quot;), the Levante is intended to be a limited run of 8 cars at a cost of £115,000 each.

In 2013 the 620R had installed a Ford Duratec direct injection supercharged straight-four engine rated at at 7700 rpm and at 7350 rpm of torque.

====Suzuki-engined models====

In 2013, Caterham also launched the 160/165 at the opposite end of the spectrum. This used a Suzuki 660 cc three-cylinder turbo K6A engine, producing , with a live rear axle and S3-style body work only. The model was only available in S (road) specification and continued until 2018.

The 160 was replaced in 2021 by the 170, available in both R (track) and S (road) specifications. The 170 uses a newer Suzuki 660 cc three cylinder turbo R06A engine, producing , and features narrower front and rear bodywork resulting in the smallest Seven Caterham have produced, and the lightest of the current range, weighing in at in R specification. Again, this variant was only available in the S3 body. In 2022 a further variant, the Super Seven 600, was added. This features the same engine and chassis, but with more traditional clamshell front wings and a variety of other heritage styling changes.

== Racing ==

The Lotus 7 was conceived by Chapman as a car to be raced. Whilst still a prototype, in September 1957, it was raced at the Brighton Speed Trials and by the end of 1958 Graham Hill was winning races with the Coventry Climax-engined &#x27;Super Seven&#x27;. The car has had a strong racing history throughout its life under both Lotus and Caterham stewardship. Amongst the marque&#x27;s more famous races was the victory in the Nelson Ledges 24-hour race in Ohio when, against a field including works teams from Honda and Mazda, a four-man team from Caterham (including both Jez Coates and Robert Nearn) won by seven laps (after 990 laps) in a modified Vauxhall HPC.

After dominating open class races for decades, Caterham Super 7 Racing, a one-make championship for Caterhams, began in 1986. Caterham 7 races have since expanded to include club and competitive races in the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Canada, the United States and Asia. In 1995 the Caterham Academy, a novices-only format, was introduced in the UK. For £17,995 (2009 price), entrants get a modified Roadsport kit (although a factory-built option is available for extra cost) with a sealed engine and 5-speed gearbox. Having completed the ARDS license qualification, the season then consists of four sprints followed by four circuit races. The Academy is designed as the first step in a well-established chain of Caterham race formats, such as the Caterham Motorsport Ladder which consists of Road sports B then Road sports A, R300, Superlight and Eurocup, or the Caterham Graduates Racing Club.

The car was banned from production car racing in the UK in 1976 for being too successful. This prompted Caterham Cars&#x27; boss Graham Nearn to produce T-shirts which read &quot;Caterham Seven, the car that&#x27;s Too Fast to Race ...&quot;. More significantly, Nearn also reached out to his local MP, Sir Geoffrey Howe, arguing that it was unreasonable to ban a British product from a British championship. The RAC lifted the ban in 1980, but initially only allowed Caterhams to be raced under rather severe restrictions, requiring a full windshield be fitted and limiting the engine to the Crossflow unit. These restrictions were later gradually lifted. In 2002 an R400 won its class (and came 11th overall out of 200 starters) at the Nürburgring 24-hour race by 10 laps, ahead of the competition that included Porsche and BMW racecars, leading, once again, to a ban on entry in subsequent years.

==Current range==

The existing range provided by Caterham Cars comprises a choice of two chassis types (the traditional narrow-bodied &#x27;Series 3&#x27; chassis and a wider ‘Series 5’). All road going Caterham 7’s are powered by a 2.0 Ford Duratec engine except the 170, the Caterham academy cars are powered by a 1.6 Ford Sigma engine. All models are available either factory-built or as a self-build kit (620 factory built only).

Until mid-2013 the factory had offered options around the Rover K-series engine, including the entry-level &quot;Classic&quot; with a 1.4-litre, capable of 0–60 in 6.5 seconds and a top speed of . But with the cessation of the engine production and new EU emissions regulations, the end of the engine&#x27;s production also removed the &quot;Classic&quot; from the company&#x27;s model line-up. As of 2017, the company maintains two separate ranges for mainland Europe (Euro 6 compliant) and the United Kingdom, reflecting the different legislative systems.

As of 2015, the range was simplified and is now simply a number, reflecting the horsepower per tonne, with ‘S’ or ‘R’ packages for either street or track use. Most versions (not the 170) are available on the standard S3 or on the wider SV chassis. The European models end with the number &quot;5&quot; while the UK models end in a &quot;0&quot;. The range consists of the Seven 165, 275, 355, and 485. The 170 model is powered by a 660cc Suzuki engine, while the more powerful variants have 2.0 Ford engines. The UK range for 2022 is 170, 360, 420, and 620.

=== 160 / 165 / 170 ===

The 170 is the current entry-level offering from Caterham. Prior to 2021, entry-level models were the 160 and 165: the 160 for the United Kingdom and the 165 intended for sale in the European Union. It is only available with the S3 chassis, doors, and windscreen as standard. There is a list of optional extras such as carpets, spare wheel, weather package and heater. It is powered by a turbocharged Suzuki 660 cc kei car K6A engine producing 84 horsepower. The price starts at £22,990 for a 170S in semi-kit form. This model, with its skinnier tyres and Suzuki driveshafts, is compact enough to be classified as a &quot;Kei&quot; car in Japan – even though its power which is above the 64 PS limit for that class, as its European Type Approval was more important to the Japanese authorities. Caterham Japan had originally intended to sell the car with the lower powered engine, assuming this was required, and initially announced the car as the &quot;Caterham 130&quot; in November 2013, reflecting the lower power-to-weight ratio.

The car&#x27;s gearbox and live rear axle is also supplied by Suzuki, with the rear axle coming from the Suzuki Every kei van; this is the first Caterham with a live rear axle since the supply of Morris Marina rears dried up and the Seven Beaulieu ended production in 2003. The car received a large amount of publicity for a low-powered entry-level model, with an appearance on &quot;Top Gear&quot;, and Suzuki displaying it at the 2014 Frankfurt Motor Show. Production had to be adjusted upwards by 50 percent, with a third of the first year&#x27;s production of 150 cars shipped to Japan.

=== 360 ===
The 360 is now the second-level offering from Caterham. It is available in both S3 and SV chassis sizes and is sold in ‘kit’ form as standard. The 360 is available in both ‘S’ and ‘R’ trims for street and track respectively. 
The 360 has 180hp, produced from a 2.0 Ford Duratec engine. 0-60mph time is 4.8s going on to a top speed of 130mph.
The Caterham 360 starts at £31,990 for the ‘S’ trim and an additional £1,000 for ‘R’ trim.

=== Superlight ===
The Superlight is available in both S3 and SV chassis sizes. The list of standard equipment reflects the Superlight&#x27;s bias to track work: Wide-track front suspension, 6-speed sequential manual gearbox, carbon-fibre dashboard and front wings, GRP aeroscreen, and seats, racing harness, removable steering wheel. Quoted weight for the Superlight is about less than the Roadsport, due in part to the lack of a spare wheel and carrier. All Superlight cars use the 2-litre Ford Duratec engine in differing states of tune; the R400 with and R500 with . Caterham used to manufacture an R300 using the same engine at 175 bhp, but this car has effectively now become the Supersport R. With the launch of the R500 (April 2008), Caterham made available the options of a sequential gearbox and launch control. Quoted performance for the R500 is 0–60 in 2.88 seconds and a top speed of . In October 2012 a supercharged model &#x27;R600&#x27; for a race-series above the R300-class was released, including slick tyres and a sequential gearbox. The weight of the R600 was 1139 lbs or 517 kg.

At the beginning of December 2008, &quot;Top Gear&quot; made the R500 its &#x27;2008 Car of the Year&#x27;.
=== Super 7 ===
The Caterham Super 7 is the retro-inspired 1,600cc version of the Caterham 7. The Super 7 is powered by a 1.6 litre Ford Sigma petrol engine which makes use of twin throttle bodies to aid airflow. Caterham has designed the Super Seven to have long, flared wheel arches, dials provided by Smiths, and a wire mesh grille. Optional packages include a wooden Mota-Lita steering wheel to complete the look.

===EV===

Two Seven EV concepts were shown at Goodwood Festival of Speed in July 2023. These had electric engines from Swindon Powertrain E-axle and weighed 70 kg more due to the 40 kWh battery.

== Model history ==

=== 50th Anniversary editions ===
Caterham celebrated the 50th year of Seven productions with a couple of special edition &quot;50th Anniversary&quot; paint options. In addition, as part of the 50th-anniversary celebrations in early June 2007, they showcased the X330 concept car. Based on the CSR, the X330 employs a supercharged version of the Duratec engine to produce . The use of lighter-gauge steel and of carbon-fibre instead of GRP further improves the power-to-weight ratio. Caterham says that they have no plans to put this car into production.

=== CSR ===
The CSR represents the top of the range and in some respects can be considered a separate model. It has its own chassis, suspension, and interior and is available with 2.3-litre (200 bhp or 260 bhp) Ford Cosworth Duratec engine. Quoted performance for the CSR260 is 0–60 in 3.1 seconds and a top speed of . There is no home-build option; the factory supplies the finished car.

In 2006, Caterham introduced the CSR Superlight. Based on the CSR260, this model adds a &#x27;Superlight&#x27; lightweight specification to the CSR, further extending the CSR260&#x27;s already epic performance envelope. The 2.3-litre Cosworth-powered Caterham CSR260 Superlight brings all the performance credentials associated with its stablemate; performance is quoted as a 0–60 mph time of 3.1 seconds and a top speed of . The Superlight swaps the windscreen, carpet, heater, and weather gear on the standard car for a limited-slip differential and a quicker steering rack. There is a 25-kilo weight reduction over the standard CSR260, this model variant also adds distinctive Superlight styling to the exterior, including a wind deflector, a carbon-fibre dashboard and wings, a black powder-coated cockpit, and a quick-release MOMO steering wheel. Of particular note are &#x27;Dynamic Suspensions&#x27; Damper units developed by a specialist Multimatic for the car. The damper units lend the already capable CSR a further edge in terms of handling and cornering performance. It features the same 2.3-litre (260 bhp) engine as the CSR260, but weighs only and has a power-to-weight ratio of -per-tonne.

Caterham has a number of models, such as the Roadsport, Supersport and Superlight, that are occasionally re-introduced with chassis upgrades or changes in the engine options.

<doc id="654957" wikidata="Q1156975" url="?curid=654957" title="Evening Shade">
<text>Evening Shade is an American sitcom that aired on CBS from September 21, 1990, to May 23, 1994. The series stars Burt Reynolds as Woodrow &quot;Wood&quot; Newton, an ex-professional football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who returns to rural Evening Shade, Arkansas, to coach a high-school football team with a long losing streak. Reynolds personally requested to use the Steelers as his character&#x27;s former team because he was a fan.

The general theme of the show is the appeal of small-town life. Episodes often ended with a closing narration by Ossie Davis, as his character Ponder Blue, summing up the events of the episode, always closing with &quot;... in a place called Evening Shade.&quot; The opening segment included clips from around Arkansas, including the famous McClard&#x27;s Bar-B-Q in Hot Springs National Park.

==Summary==

A former pro football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers who quit due to injury, Wood Newton has settled down to a quiet life in Arkansas as the coach of the Evening Shade High School football team, which is notorious for its long losing streak.

Wood and his wife Ava, whom he married when she was only 18 (a frequently voiced grievance made by her father Evan Evans, owner of the local newspaper) are devoted to each other despite their age difference. Ava is an ambitious, successful practicing lawyer who in the first season is elected District Attorney while pregnant with their fourth (unintended) child, Emily, who is born in the first season finale. Among Wood and Ava&#x27;s closest friends are the somewhat-older town doctor Harlan Eldridge and his trusting wife Merleen, who always believes the best of people.

The show&#x27;s plots focus on the various difficulties that Wood faces in living a very different life than he ever expected, as well as the obvious family pressures of two jobs and four children. Additional tensions come from Ava&#x27;s aunt Frieda, Evan&#x27;s perennially discontented sister, who especially disapproves when Evan begins dating town stripper Fontana Beausoleil, who discovers in season two that she is the long-lost daughter Merleen gave up for adoption when she was 15. Evan and Fontana get married in a three-part episode in season two and have a child in season three.

The show also gets mileage out of the incongruity of the decidedly unathletic, but well-meaning assistant coach Herman Stiles, the best the school&#x27;s budget can afford. During the first season, he catches the eye of Evening Shade High&#x27;s prim and proper principal, Margaret Fouch, and they start dating.

On July 12 and 19, 1993, CBS aired two parts of an hour-long pilot, &quot;Harlan &amp; Merleen&quot;, as a proposed spin-off of the series. The pilot had the Eldridges open their home to young pregnant women who needed help (one of whom was played by Leah Remini). The pilot did not achieve series status.

== Production ==
The show&#x27;s production company, Mozark Productions, was a joint venture by creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason of Missouri and her husband, Arkansas native Harry Thomason, which concurrently produced another successful show set in the South, &quot;Designing Women&quot;. Hal Holbrook&#x27;s &quot;Designing Women&quot; character was killed off to free the actor to star in the newer program. The series was produced in association with CBS Productions, Burt Reynolds Productions, and MTM Enterprises. CBS retained full ownership of the series while MTM syndicated the series in the United States.

== Release ==

=== Home media ===
On July 15, 2008, CBS DVD/Paramount Home Entertainment released the first season on DVD, albeit with redone music and editing.

On April 12, 2019, Visual Entertainment released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the first time.

== Reception ==
The series enjoyed strong ratings during its entire run, hitting its peak in season two with a number 15 Nielsen ranking. At the time, this was a notably higher position than &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, which had recently fallen from a five-year streak as TV&#x27;s number-one program. &quot;Evening Shade&quot; was still a top-30 performer, after CBS cancelled the series in May 1994. Skyrocketing production costs, mainly attributed to the large salaries of the show&#x27;s top-caliber, all-star cast, were the primary reason given for the cancellation (which was confirmed by Marilu Henner in her September 1994 appearance on &quot;Charlie Rose&quot;). However, some have speculated that the show&#x27;s ending was a decision made by Reynolds, rather than CBS, as his recent marriage troubles with Loni Anderson (from whom he was divorced in 1993) were thought to have affected his work.

After its cancellation, reruns of &quot;Evening Shade&quot; were picked up by The Family Channel, which were also edited considerably from their original broadcast versions.

<text>The Andorra national football team () represents Andorra in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Andorran Football Federation, the governing body for football in Andorra. The team has enjoyed very little success due to the Principality&#x27;s tiny population, the fifth smallest of any UEFA country (only Liechtenstein, San Marino, Gibraltar and the Faroe Islands are smaller).

Andorra&#x27;s first official game was a 6–1 defeat in a friendly match to Estonia in 1996. Since the qualifying rounds for the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament, Andorra have competed in qualifying for every European Championship and FIFA World Cup but have had very little success. They have only won thirteen matches since becoming recognised by FIFA in 1996.

==History==
Though the Andorran Football Federation formed in 1994, and the domestic league started in 1995, the national team could not participate in major championships until it gained affiliation with governing bodies FIFA and UEFA in 1996. Because the European qualifiers for the 1998 FIFA World Cup were already underway, Andorra could not take part in them by the time the assocoation joined FIFA and UEFA. The national team played its first match against Estonia in Andorra La Vella and lost 6–1.

Andorra&#x27;s first match in a FIFA-sanctioned competition was a 3–1 loss to Armenia on 5 September 1998 in a qualifier for UEFA Euro 2000. Andorra lost all ten qualifiers for the tournament. The team particularly struggled in away matches; each loss was by at least three goals. Andorra scored only three goals, two of which were penalties, and two of which were in the away matches. Andorra conceded 28 goals, and their biggest defeat of the qualifiers was a 6–1 away loss to Russia.

For their first World Cup qualifying campaign, Andorra were drawn in a group with Cyprus, Estonia, Ireland, the Netherlands and Portugal. They lost their opening match 1–0 to Estonia. In the next game, they lost 3–2 to Cyprus but scored their first World Cup qualifying goals. They were again defeated by Estonia, this time 2–1. They lost all their matches and their only away goal was in a 3–1 loss against Ireland. Their worst defeat was 7–1 to Portugal on a neutral ground in Lleida, Spain. Andorra finished the campaign with no points and conceded 36 goals in ten matches.

In the team&#x27;s qualification campaign for UEFA Euro 2004 they again lost every game. They scored their only goal in a 2–1 away loss to Bulgaria. In this competition the scores were closer than before as they lost 3–0 to Bulgaria, Croatia and Belgium, 2–0 twice to Estonia, 2–0 to Croatia and 1–0 to Belgium.

By Andorran standards, qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup was successful. They won their first competitive game 1–0 at home against Macedonia. Andorra midfielder Marc Bernaus, who played in the Spanish second division, received a long throw in off his chest and volleyed in a goal early in the second half. After the game, Macedonia coach Dragan Kanatlarovski resigned and called the game &quot;a shameful outcome, a humiliation.&quot; Andorra also drew two matches, 0–0 in Macedonia and 0–0 at home against Finland.

In the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, Andorra again lost every game. The closest game was against Russia, a 1–0 defeat on 21 November 2007. Their biggest defeat was a 7–0 loss to Croatia in Andorra La Vella, which is their worst defeat in UEFA competitions and matched their loss to the Czech Republic as their largest losing deficit. Andorra scored only two goals and conceded 42 in a total of 12 games. In 2010 World Cup qualifying, Andorra lost all ten matches. For the tournament, they scored three goals, in defeats to Belarus and Kazakhstan, and conceded 39 goals, including six in a defeat to England, the largest margin in the group.

Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 ended in familiar fashion; they lost all ten matches, scoring only one goal and conceding 25; their best results were two one-goal losses to Slovakia and a 3–1 loss in Ireland. The 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying tournament was even more disastrous. Andorra lost all their matches while conceding 30 goals and not scoring.

During 2016 UEFA Euro qualifying, Andorra again lost all of its ten games but scored four goals, setting a national team record for goals scored in a European Championship qualifying group. On 22 February 2017, Andorra beat San Marino away 2–0 in a friendly match, ending with 12 years and 132 days without winning any match. On 9 June 2017, Andorra beat Hungary 1–0 in a World Cup home qualifier with a goal by Marc Rebés, their first victory in a competitive match since 2004. Thanks to these two wins and a draw against the Faroe Islands on 6 July 2017, Andorra progressed 57 positions in the FIFA rankings to 129th, its second best position ever. On 21 March 2018, Rebés scored the only goal of a friendly win over Liechtenstein in Spain, giving Andorra their third victory of the last 13 months and sixth of all time.

In 2018, Andorra made its debut in the newly created UEFA Nations League. They played in Group 1 of League D, where they finished at the bottom of the group with four ties and two losses, finishing unbeaten at home.

On 11 October 2019, Andorra won 1–0 against Moldova in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying competition, thus ending a 56-match winless run in Euro qualifiers. One month later, the team earned one more point after an away draw against Albania, thus avoiding for the first time to end a qualifying round in the last position.

On 7 December 2020, after the draw for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Andorra was given an opportunity to achieve further success in official competition as it was placed in Group I where it found among its five opponents San Marino, the lowest placed team in the last pot and which it has faced before that only once in a friendly match (away on 22 February 2017, for a 2–0 victory). Their other opponents were Albania (against whom they drew 2–2 away in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying), Hungary (whom they beat at home 1–0 in the 2018 World Cup qualifiers), Poland and England. On 2 September 2021 Andorra achieved a 3rd success in the qualifiers of a World Cup, at home against San Marino (2–0). On 12 October 2021 Andorra achieved a 4th success in a World Cup qualifier, beating San Marino again in the return match (3–0). It was also a first in several respects: it is the largest Andorran victory in its history, but also the first time that the Pyrenean selection managed to score 3 goals in the same game and won an away match; finally it also succeeded for the first time in its history to sign 2 successes in the same qualifying phase and pocket 6 points. However, they lost all their games against their four other opponents and finished second to last in the group with 6 points, with a record of 2 wins and 8 losses.

On 25 March 2022 Andorra defeated St. Kitts and Nevis at home (1–0), recording its first win against a non-European team. Three days later, Andorra defeated another non-European side with another 1–0 win at home to Grenada. On 10 June 2022, in the 2022–23 edition of the UEFA Nations League, Andorra won at home against Liechtenstein (2–1), with Jesús Rubio scoring a spectacular goal with a 60-meter lob on the second Andorran goal, thus signing its first success in this competition for its third participation. This success also means that the Pyrenean team has achieved at least one victory in each of the official competitions in which it has taken part. On September 22, they beat Liechtenstein, 2–0, in Vaduz - this was their first away win in the Nations League. The Pyrenees team totaled 8 points at the end of this edition thanks to two home draws against Moldova (0–0) and the Latvia (1–1), finishing undefeated at home and losing only two away games against the Latvians and Moldovans, which is its best record in the group stage of any competition.

==Stadium==

From 1996 until 2014, Andorra played their home matches at the Comunal d&#x27;Andorra la Vella, in the capital city of Andorra la Vella. This stadium has a capacity of 1,800 and also hosts the matches of club sides FC Andorra and the Andorran Premier League. On 9 September 2014, the national team began playing at the new Estadi Nacional with a capacity of 3,306.

Construction is underway on a new home stadium, Nou Estadi Encamp, which is due to be opened in June 2025.

Andorra have occasionally played home matches outside their borders. For example, Andorra hosted France and England in the 2000 European Championship, 2008 European Championship and 2010 World Cup qualifiers in the Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys in Barcelona, which was the home of RCD Espanyol between 1997 and 2009.

==Reputation==
Andorra&#x27;s lopsided win–loss record gives them a lowly reputation in world football. The nation has only won seven competitive fixtures, four World Cup qualifying matches against Macedonia in October 2004 and Hungary in June 2017, both by 1–0; San Marino in September and October 2021 by 2–0 at home and 3–0 away at Serravalle (their biggest ever win), a single European Championship qualifying match at home against Moldova in October 2019 by 1–0 and two UEFA Nations League matches against Liechtenstein in June and September 2022 by 2–1 at home and 2–0 away at Vaduz; and six friendly games, three of them by 2–0 against Belarus in April 2000 and Albania in April 2002 at home and San Marino in February 2017 away, as well as three wins by 1–0 margin against Liechtenstein at neutral venues in March 2018 and against St. Kitts and Nevis and Grenada at home in March 2022.

With the fourth smallest population of any UEFA country, until the admission of Gibraltar, the talent pool is small. Players are predominantly amateurs because the Andorra domestic league is only part-time. Since Andorra began playing in 1996, their average FIFA ranking is 163.

<text>Catherine Anahid Berberian (July 4, 1925 – March 6, 1983) was an American mezzo-soprano and composer based in Italy. She worked closely with many contemporary avant-garde music composers, including Luciano Berio, Bruno Maderna, John Cage, Henri Pousseur, Sylvano Bussotti, Darius Milhaud, Roman Haubenstock-Ramati, and Igor Stravinsky. She also interpreted works by Claudio Monteverdi, Heitor Villa-Lobos, Kurt Weill, Philipp zu Eulenburg and others. As a recital curator, she presented several vocal genres in a classical context, including arrangements of songs by The Beatles by Louis Andriessen as well as folk songs from several countries and cultures. As a composer, she wrote &quot;Stripsody&quot; (1966), in which she exploits her vocal technique using comic book sounds (onomatopoeia), and &quot;Morsicat(h)y&quot; (1969), a composition for the keyboard (with the right hand only) based on Morse code.

==Biography==
Cathy Berberian was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts to Armenian parents, Yervant and Louise Berberian. The elder of two children, she spent the first 12 years of her life in Attleboro, then the family moved to New York City in 1937 where she graduated from Manhattan&#x27;s Julia Richman High School for Girls. From an early age, she showed an interest in Armenian folk music and dance as well as traditional opera. While still in high school, she was the director and soloist of the Armenian Folk Group in New York City. For a time, she was an undergraduate at New York University, but left to take evening classes in theatre and music at Columbia University, working during the day to support her studies. She went on to study music in Paris with Marya Freund in 1948, and in 1949 she went to Milan to study singing at the Milan Conservatory with Giorgina del Vigo. In 1950, she received a Fulbright scholarship to continue her studies there. Although she had appeared in several student productions, radio broadcasts and informal concerts during the early 1950s, she made her formal debut in 1957 at Incontri Musicali, a contemporary music festival in Naples. The following year her performance of John Cage&#x27;s &quot;Aria with Fontana Mix&quot; in its world premiere, established her as a major exponent of contemporary vocal music. Her American debut came in 1960 at the Tanglewood Music Festival where she premiered &quot;Circles&quot; by the Italian composer Luciano Berio.

From 1950 to 1964 Berberian was married to Luciano Berio, whom she met when they were students at the Milan Conservatory. They had one daughter, Cristina Berio, born in 1953. Berberian became Berio&#x27;s muse and collaborator both during and after their marriage. He wrote, for her, &quot;Thema (Omaggio a Joyce)&quot; (1958), &quot;Circles&quot; (1960), &quot;Visage&quot; (1961), &quot;Folk Songs&quot; (1964–73), &quot;Sequenza III&quot; (1965), and &quot;Recital I (for Cathy)&quot; (1972).

In 1967 Berberian released a 12-track album (recorded in Paris) that consisted entirely of quirky baroque-style cover versions of songs by The Beatles, entitled &quot;Beatles Arias&quot;. The instrumental backing was scored for a classical string quartet or wind quintet plus harpsichord or organ. All the tracks were arranged by Guy Boyer and most of the songs feature him on harpsichord. The original US cover illustration for the album (resembling the Beatles&#x27;s single &quot;Revolution&quot;) was by Roberto Zamarin while the UK&#x27;s was by Gerald Scarfe. The album was reissued on CD in 2005 with bonus tracks including a 1975 French radio interview, and three live tracks featuring Berberian performing songs from the album, recorded at French music festivals in the early 1980s, with accompaniment by Italian composer–musician Bruno Canino and arrangements by noted Dutch composer Louis Andriessen.

Sylvano Bussotti, John Cage, Hans Werner Henze, William Walton, Igor Stravinsky, and Anthony Burgess also composed works for her voice. Although Berberian was based in Milan from the time of her studies there, she taught at both Vancouver University and the Rheinische Musikschule in Cologne during the 1970s. Following her death, Berio composed &quot;Requies: in memoriam Cathy Berberian&quot; which premiered in Lausanne on March 26, 1984.

She is mentioned in the Steely Dan song &quot;Your Gold Teeth&quot; from the 1973 album &quot;Countdown to Ecstasy&quot; :
: &quot;Even Cathy Berberian knows / There&#x27;s one roulade she can&#x27;t sing.&quot;

Berberian was also a translator. With Umberto Eco she translated into Italian works by Jules Feiffer and, with other Italian translators, works by Woody Allen. Eco and Berberian worked together in other projects too and he nicknamed her &quot;magnificathy&quot;. This nickname with a different spelling chosen by Berberian herself: &quot;magnifiCathy&quot; was later used as the title of one of her best-known albums.

==Death==
In the last years of her life Berberian experienced increasing health problems and almost entirely lost her vision. In order to continue performing, she committed all her repertoire to memory. An avid reader, the loss of sight was a great source of frustration for Berberian and she expressed feelings of loneliness and depression. She had gained weight and had developed heart problems, but nevertheless continued with an ambitious concert schedule. On 7 March 1983, in a broadcast on RAI Italian Television that marked the centennial of Karl Marx&#x27;s death, Berberian had planned to perform the Italian version of &quot;The Internationale&quot; in the style of Marilyn Monroe. On March 5, she called Luciano Berio to discuss ideas about the performance, but died the next day of a &quot;massive&quot; heart attack.

Her body was cremated in Rome and the urn with her ashes was brought to Milan where, on March 13, a ceremony was held in the &quot;Armenian Church&quot; of &quot;Via Jommelli&quot;. The ashes were divided between Berberian&#x27;s brother Ervant and her daughter Cristina, who later dispersed them in the Mediterranean Sea, in front of the city of Oneglia, along with pink orchids, Berberian&#x27;s favorite flower.

== The New Vocality ==
In her article &quot;La nuova vocalità nell&#x27;opera contemporanea&quot; (&quot;The New Vocality in Contemporary Music&quot;) from 1966, Berberian outlines a new role for vocal performance in contemporary music. Although the ideas were developed along with Luciano Berio during their collaboration on works such as &quot;Visage&quot; and &quot;Sequenza III&quot;, Berberian championed the concept and descriptions of the &quot;New Vocality&quot; which became a major part of her philosophy of performance and legacy as an artist. In contrast to traditional opera practice, wherein singers are to produce beautiful tones and nothing else, the New Vocality employs &quot;the voice which has an endless range of vocal styles at its disposal, embracing the history of music as well as aspects of sound itself.&quot; However, the New Vocality is much more than extended vocal techniques, which are &quot;based on the inventory of more or less unedited vocal effects which the composer may devise and the singer regurgitates.&quot; Rather, the singer should become the composer of the live performance and &quot;use the voice in all aspects of the vocal process; a process which can be integrated as flexibly as the lines and expressions on a face.&quot; This philosophy of vocal performance can be seen as fundamental to the development of vocal performance art as well as to the work of Meredith Monk, Diamanda Galas, Laurie Anderson, and countless other vocal performers and composers.

<text>Bevin Boys were young British men conscripted to work in coal mines between December 1943 and March 1948, to increase the rate of coal production, which had declined through the early years of World War II. The programme was named after Ernest Bevin, the Labour Party politician who was Minister of Labour and National Service in the wartime coalition government.

Chosen by lot as 10% of all male conscripts aged 18–25 (plus some volunteering as an alternative to military conscription) nearly 48,000 Bevin Boys performed vital and dangerous civil conscription service in coal mines. Although the last ballot took place in May 1945 (shortly before VE Day), the final conscripts were not released from service until March 1948. Few chose to remain working in the mining industry after demobilisation; most left for further education or for employment in other sectors.

Bevin Boys were targets of abuse from the general public, who mistakenly believed them to be draft dodgers or cowards. They were frequently stopped by the police as possible deserters. Unlike those who had served in the military, Bevin Boys were not awarded medals for their contribution to the war effort and official recognition by the British government was only conferred in 1995.

==Creation of programme==
===Shortfall in UK coal output===

At the start of WWII, the UK was highly dependent on coal to power ships and trains, and as the main source of energy for electricity generation. Although output from mines had increased as the world economy recovered from the Great Depression, it was in decline again by the time war broke out in September 1939.

At the beginning of the war the Government, underestimating the value of strong younger coal miners, conscripted them into the armed forces. By mid-1943, the coal mines had lost 36,000 workers, and they were generally not replaced, because other likely young men were also being conscripted to the armed forces.

Industrial relations were also poor: In the first half of 1942, there were several local strikes over wages across the country, which also reduced output. In response, the government increased the minimum weekly pay to 83 shillings (for those over the age of 21 working underground) and established a new Ministry of Fuel, Light and Power, under the leadership of Gwilym Lloyd George to oversee the reorganisation of coal production for the war effort. In late summer, a bonus scheme was proposed to reward workers in mines that exceeded their output targets. These measures resulted in an increase in production in the second half of 1942, although volumes were still short of the tonnage required.

Absenteeism (miners taking time off work as a result of e.g. sickness) also rose through the war from 9.65% in December 1941 to 10.79% and 14.40% in the Decembers of 1942 and 1943 respectively.

By October 1943, Britain was becoming desperate for a continued supply of coal, both for the industrial war effort and for domestic heating throughout the winter.

===Appeals for volunteers===

On 23 June 1941, Bevin made a broadcast appeal to former miners, asking them to volunteer to return to the pits, with an aim of increasing numbers of mineworkers by 50,000. He also issued a &#x27;standstill&#x27; order, to prevent more miners being called up to serve in the armed forces.

On 12 November 1943, Bevin made a radio broadcast aimed at sixth-form boys, to encourage them to volunteer to work in the mines when they registered for National Service. He promised the students that, like those serving in the armed forces, they would be eligible for the government&#x27;s further education scheme.
The term &#x27;Bevin Boys&#x27; is thought to originate from this broadcast.

===Conscription===
On 12 October 1943, Gwilym Lloyd George, Minister of Fuel and Power, announced in the House of Commons that some conscripts would be directed to the mines. On 2 December, Ernest Bevin explained the scheme in more detail in parliament, announcing his intention to draft 30,000 men aged 18 to 25 by 30 April 1944.

From 1943 to 1945, one out of every ten young men called up was sent to work in the mines. This caused a great deal of upset, as many young men wanted to join the fighting forces and felt that as miners, their contributions would not be valued. The first Bevin Boys began work, having completed their training, on 14 February 1944.

==Programme==

===Selection of conscripts===
To make the process random, one of Bevin&#x27;s secretaries each week, from 14 December 1943, pulled a digit from a hat containing all ten digits, 0–9, and all men liable for call-up that week whose National Service registration number ended in that digit were directed to work in the mines, with the exception of any selected for highly skilled war work such as flying planes and in submarines, and men found physically unfit for mining. Conscripted miners came from many different trades and professions, from desk work to heavy manual labour, and included some who might otherwise have become commissioned officers.

An appeals process was set up, to allow conscripts the opportunity to challenge the decision to send them to the pits, although decisions were rarely overturned. Those who refused to serve in the mines were imprisoned. By 31 May 1944, 285 conscripts had refused to serve as miners, of whom 135 had been prosecuted and 32 had been given a prison sentence. By the end of November 1944, out of a total of 16,000 conscripts, 143 had refused to serve in the mines and had been sent to prison, some with the imposition of hard labour.

===Training===

Boys when they were nearly 18 years old received an official postcard instructing them in five days time to report to a training centre such as at Cresswell Colliery, Derbyshire.

Bevin Boys with no previous experience of mining, were given six weeks&#x27; training (four in a classroom-type setting and two at their assigned colliery). For their first four weeks of underground work, they were supervised by an experienced miner. With the exception of those working in the south Wales coalfields, the conscripts could not work at the coalface until they had accrued four months&#x27; experience underground.

For the most part, the Bevin Boys were not directly involved in cutting coal from the mine face, but acted instead as colliers assistants, responsible for filling tubs or wagons and hauling them back to the shaft for transport to the surface. Conscripts were supplied with helmets and steel-capped safety boots.

===Pay and working conditions===

Almost as soon as the first Bevin Boys had reported for training, there were complaints that their remuneration (44 shillings per week for an 18-year-old) were barely sufficient to cover living costs. Some 140 went on strike in Doncaster for two days before their training had finished. There were also complaints from experienced miners, who resented the fact that a 21-year-old recruit received the same minimum wage as they did.

Bevin Boys did not wear uniforms or badges, but the oldest clothes they could find. Being of military age and without uniform caused many to be stopped by police and questioned about avoiding call-up.

===Contemporary attitudes to Bevin Boys===

Many Bevin Boys suffered taunts as they wore no uniform, and there were accusations by some people that they were deliberately avoiding military conscription. Since a number of conscientious objectors were sent to work down the mines as an alternative to military service (under a system wholly separate from the Bevin Boy programme), there was sometimes an assumption that Bevin Boys were &quot;Conchies&quot;. The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in WWI. Old attitudes prevailed amongst some members of the general public, with resentment by association towards Bevin Boys. In 1943 Ernest Bevin said in Parliament:

==End of programme==
The final conscription ballot took place in May 1945 (shortly before VE Day); however, the final conscripts were not released from service until March 1948.

==Recognition of contribution to the war effort==
Within a few months of the first Bevin Boys starting work, there were calls for a badge to be awarded in recognition of the importance of their national service.

After the war, Bevin Boys received neither medals nor the right to return to the jobs they had previously held, although like forces veterans, they were entitled to participate in the government&#x27;s Further Education and Training Scheme, which paid university fees and an annual means-tested grant of up to £426 to cover living expenses whilst studying.

The role played by Bevin Boys in Britain&#x27;s war effort was not fully recognised until 1995, 50 years after VE Day, when Queen Elizabeth II mentioned them in a speech.

On 20 June 2007, then-prime minister Tony Blair informed the House of Commons that thousands of conscripts who worked in mines during WWII would be awarded a veterans badge similar to the HM armed forces badge awarded by the Ministry of Defence. The first badges were awarded on 25 March 2008 by the then-prime minister, Gordon Brown, at a reception in 10 Downing Street, marking the 60th anniversary of discharge of the last Bevin Boys. In 2010, Tom Hickman&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Called Up Sent Down&quot;: The Bevin Boys&#x27; War&quot; was published, containing accounts of around 70 of the boys sent to the coal mines.
On Tuesday 7 May 2013, a memorial to the Bevin Boys, based on the Bevin Boys Badge, was unveiled by the Countess of Wessex at the National Memorial Arboretum at Alrewas, Staffordshire. The memorial was designed by former Bevin Boy Harry Parkes; it is made of four stone plinths carved from grey Kilkenny stone from Ireland. The stone should turn black over time, to resemble the coal that the miners extracted.

The Bevin Boys Association is trying to trace all 48,000 Bevin Boy conscripts, optants or volunteers who served in Britain&#x27;s coal mines during and after the war, from 1943 to 1948.

==In popular culture==
Douglas Livingstone&#x27;s radio play, &quot;Road to Durham&quot;, is a fictional account of two former Bevin Boys, now in their eighties, as they visit the Durham Miners&#x27; Gala.

British musician Jez Lowe wrote the song &quot;The Sea and the Deep Blue Devil&quot; from the perspective of a Bevin Boy who loses his girlfriend to a Royal Navy recruit.

English singer-songwriter Reg Meuross wrote a song called &quot;The Bevin Boys (Bill Pettinger&#x27;s Lament)&quot;. The song was commissioned by Martin Pettinger as a tribute to his Bevin Boy father, Bill.

<text>Support Through Court (formerly The Personal Support Unit (The PSU)) is a UK legal charity that supports people who have to represent themselves in court. The aim is to &quot;reduce the disadvantage of people facing the civil and family justice system without a lawyer, enabling them to access justice&quot; and believe that &quot;no one should face court alone&quot;.

Support Through Court does not offer legal advice, but provides support to clients in a variety of other ways including: explaining how the court system works, helping to fill in court forms and papers, and accompanying clients to their hearings.

== History ==

The PSU was founded in 2001, led by Diana Copisarow OBE, Michael Naish and Mark Sheldon CBE. Whilst volunteering at the Old Bailey for the Witness Service, Lady Copisarow supported an unrepresented litigant through contested divorce proceedings at the Royal Courts. The litigant&#x27;s experience was horrendous as she faced the confusion of the court system, uncertainty about appearing before a judge, and the general emotions of litigation. These experiences drove Lady Copisarow, Michael Naish and Mark Sheldon CBE to establish the PSU to meet the human, non-legal, needs of people attending court alone and without legal representation. The PSU grew rapidly from 2007 onwards.

Following changes to legal aid in 2012, the PSU had a rise in demand for its services and now operates from 23 courts in 17 different cities across England and Wales.

In 2014 the PSU won &quot;The Guardian&quot; &#x27;Small Charity, Big Difference&#x27; Award.

In February 2017 the PSU reached the milestone of having helped on over 200,000 occasions.

In October 2019 the PSU was rebranded as Support Through Court to convey more effectively the services offered to litigants in persons.

In February 2020 Support Through Court launched its national helpline to offer individuals who cannot commute to an office an alternative method of accessing its services.

In April 2020 Support Through Court won the SME News&#x27; &#x27;Best Legal Support Volunteers 2020, England and Wales&#x27; award.

==Aims and principles==
Support Through Court aims to reduce the disadvantage of people facing the civil and family justice system without a lawyer, enabling them to access justice. Support Through Court believes that no one should face court alone and their vision is that every person in England and Wales who wants help should be able to access the help of a Support Through Court volunteer.

Support Through Court volunteers can:
* Explain how the court works, help fill in forms, organise papers, and discuss settling issues without going to court
* Help plan what you want to say in court, and if needed accompany you in court to take notes and help afterwards
* Provide details of other specialist agencies and help you find out whether you can get free legal advice

== Impact ==
Support Through Court volunteers will help with any aspect of civil legal proceedings: over half of Support Through Court help is in a family matter, with two thirds of these cases concerning children; nearly 17% of cases involve a money claim; and 14% concern housing problems, which often place people at risk of homelessness. Many of their clients are vulnerable and disadvantaged, and to Support Through Court volunteers for reassurance and guidance. Most clients cannot afford a lawyer and are not eligible for legal aid.

In 2017-18 the PSU helped clients on a record 65,000 occasions.

After being helped by a Support Through Court volunteer, 98% of clients report that they feel the Support Through Court helped them get a fairer hearing.

== Locations ==
Support Through Court has offices across England and Wales:
* Birmingham Civil Justice Centre
* Cardiff Civil and Family Justice Centre
* Central Family Court, London
* Chelmsford County Court
* Leeds Leeds Beckett University
* Liverpool Civil and Family Court
* Manchester Civil Justice Centre

<text>Puerto Peñasco () is a small city located in Puerto Peñasco Municipality in the northwest of the Mexican state of Sonora, from the border with the U.S. state of Arizona. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 62,689 inhabitants. It is located on the northern shores of the Sea of Cortez on the small strip of land that joins the Baja California Peninsula with the rest of Mexico. The area is part of the Altar Desert, one of the driest and hottest areas of the larger Sonoran Desert.

Since the late 1990s, there has been a push to develop the area for tourism. It is now one of the most important tourist destinations in northern Mexico. Puerto Peñasco is often called &quot;Rocky Point&quot; in English, and has been nicknamed &quot;Arizona’s Beach&quot; as it is the closest beach to cities such as Phoenix and Tucson. The warm sea surface temperatures of the northern end of the gulf cause Puerto Peñasco to have a much warmer climate than coastal cities on the Pacific both in the Mexican and American Californias. Nights also remain hot and muggy during summer due to the warm-water influence.

The Mar de Cortés International Airport serves Puerto Penasco, but currently has no regularly-scheduled flights in or out. A new highway shortens the drive from California by . Tourism and fishing are the most important economic activities for the city. Development to date includes over one hundred restaurants, forty-two hotels and motels, and fourteen RV facilities. The new &quot;Home Port del Mar de Cortés&quot; (Sea of Cortez) cruise ship terminal began construction in 2014 between Sandy Beach and Cholla Bay (La Choya), northwest of the central city. The construction has been suspended for financial reasons.

==History==
The city is known by two names, Puerto Peñasco (rocky cliff port) in Spanish and Rocky Point in English. In 1826, retired Robert William Hale Hardy of the British Royal Navy was sailing in this area searching for pearls and precious metals. He named the area Rocky Point, and it was identified as Rocky Point on marine maps until President Lázaro Cárdenas changed it to Puerto Punta Peñasco. To simplify pronunciation, the English name lost the word “Port” and the Spanish name dropped “Punta”.

Prior to the 1920s, the area was just one of the safe harbors for wandering fishermen who worked the upper Gulf of California. During fishing seasons, fishermen from Guaymas, Bahía Kino, Puerto Libertad, and Puerto Lobos began to come here to camp out. The main attraction for these fishermen was a fish called totoaba, which was fished not for its meat, but for its use in medicine. At this time the area was known as Punta de Piedra o Punta Peñasco. The name comes from a large quantity of solidified lava that hit the Gulf. Even as early as the 19th century, fishermen from Arizona came here. Since there was no source of drinking water, it was not settled permanently.

In the 1930s, under President Lázaro Cárdenas, a railroad was built to connect Baja California to the rest of Mexico, passing by Puerto Peñasco. The town began to grow again, adding a police delegation in 1932, as a dependency of the nearby municipality of Sonoyta, even though the town was part of the municipality of Caborca. The railroad line created new population centers and the initial layout of the city and port of Puerto Peñasco was begun in the 1940s. During this same time shrimp fishing was having an impact on the local economy.

In 1952, Puerto Peñasco separated from the municipality of Caborca and comprised the localities of Sonoyta, Bahía La Choya, 21 de Marzo and Cuauhtémoc. Sonoyta was the second largest population center at the time. In 1989, the municipality of Plutarco Elías Calles was split from Puerto Peñasco. 
Until the 1990s, there had been little tourism here except for campers and fishermen. The municipality&#x27;s pristine beaches with clear waters stretched for a hundred miles north or south with almost no development. The push to make Puerto Peñasco or Rocky Point a major tourism center was initiated in 1993, with the government joining with private investors to build condominiums and other facilities. The goal has been to take advantage of the area&#x27;s proximity to the United States.

Much of the inspiration for the effort came from the success of Cancún, which was a nearly virgin beach before a government/private venture developed it. Another reason to look to tourism was the declining catches of fishermen here, due to overfishing and pollution. The federal government contributed two billion pesos in infrastructure, especially roadways and an airport and the area was declared a free zone, meaning foreigners could visit the area without a visa (although a passport is still needed). There was some economic instability in 1994 and 1995, but it did not derail development here for long, coming back by 1999. Between 2002 and 2007 economic growth was at twelve percent. The local real estate market started to go bust in 2007 due to the economic slowdown in the United States.

==Cityscape==
The oldest part of the town was founded between the edge of the sea and Ballena Hill. The base of the area is volcanic rock, much of it solidified lava flows from when ancient eruptions met the ocean. To promote tourism here, the city was declared to be part of the border “free zone” although it is about from the U.S. This means that foreigners can drive from the U.S. to Puerto Peñasco without obtaining visas. This makes the area attractive to visitors from Arizona, California, and Nevada. In a relatively short time, Puerto Peñasco has become a major tourist center. It contains numerous hotels as well as RV and primitive camping sites. Puerto Peñasco is described as &quot;by far the most American city in Mexico&quot; and &quot;Arizona’s beach&quot;, with Tucson, Phoenix, and Yuma closer than the Mexican cities of Mexicali and Hermosillo. Most visitors come for the beaches and to fish. The annual fishing festival begins on Navy Day on June 1. These celebrations feature mariachis, folklorico dance, and a festival queen. Another fishing tournament is sponsored by the La Choya Bay Club. Beaches here include Sandy Beach, Las Conchas, El Mirador, La Choya, Playa Encanto, Estero de Morúa, Playa La Joya, Playa Miramar, and Playa San Jorge. Sandy Beach is noted for its sand which is a light brown color. One attraction of the beaches is the tidal pools. Tides here can raise and lower the sea on the relatively flat land up to . Low tide reveals a large number of tidal pools in the craters of the rocky coast. In these pools there used to be large numbers of crabs, starfish, and other marine life. There is also an estuary by the name of Morúa east of the community of Las Conchas. Here live thousands of birds, including migratory species.

A large number of beachfront condominiums have been built in this area including Las Conchas, Sandy Beach Resorts, Costa Diamante, Las Palomas Beach and Golf Resort, Sonoran Sea, Bella Sirena, and Las Palmas. The first condos, Las Conchas and Bahías Choya, were built in the far southeast and far northwest respectively. Interest in property here has been unexpectedly strong, prompting further developments such as Sandy Beach. This development has plans for a golf course, malls, marinas and more condos.

Crafts for sale here include shell jewelry, iron pieces and carved ironwood.

The airport is a joint government and private enterprise project which was inaugurated in 2008 and has a daily capacity of 2,000 passengers.
Puerto Peñasco is a popular destination for spring break, especially for high school and college students from Arizona and California for both its proximity and its 18-year-old legal drinking age.

The Universidad de Sonora has its Centro de Investigaciones Científicas y Tecnológicas (Scientific and Technological Research Center) as well as its Centro de Estudios del Desierto (Center for Desert Studies) here which are open to visitors. These institutions started as a joint project with the Laboratory of Atmospheric Sciences of the University of Arizona in 1963 to develop methods of desalinization of sea water. In 1973 and 1974, the Unidad Experimental Peñasco was founded to research the raising of blue shrimp or Penaeus stylirostris. This project has been the leader in the development of shrimp farming techniques in Mexico. The CET-MAR Aquarium is a marine research center open to the public with displays of marine life such as turtles, octopus, and numerous fish species.

Many residents are from the United States or Canada. Most restaurants offer menus in English, and most businesses accept U.S. dollars. Puerto Peñasco is popular with retirees, especially those from the United States and Canada who have trailers and RVs. However, there are retirees here from all over the world. The town also has newspapers in English.

== Geography ==
The city of Puerto Peñasco (Rocky Point) is found in the northwest of the Mexican state of Sonora, a state that is located directly to the south of the U.S. state of Arizona. It is located on the eastern coast of the Gulf of California approximately 60 miles south of the Arizonan border, only about a four-hour drive from Phoenix or Tucson. The city&#x27;s maximum elevation is 100 meters (328 feet) above sea level and its minimum is 0 meters (0 feet) above sea level. It is found in the Sonoran Desert, a desert which stretches from the U.S. states of Arizona and California down to the northern tip of the Mexican state of Sinaloa. Because of this, its climate reaches extreme temperatures during the summer and relatively high temperatures in the winter. The city itself is relatively flat, with the exception of Ballena hill that is found near its port. Further, remnants of ancient volcanoes can be found on the beaches of Puerto Peñasco and several dormant volcano peaks can be seen throughout the entire state.

The average yearly high temperature is , but temperatures of are very common in the summer months. The average yearly low temperature is , and frosts are rare. Though very rare, it is possible for a tropical storm or hurricane to reach the northern Gulf of California and cause significant damage. Hurricane Kathleen in 1976, Hurricane Nora in 1997, and Hurricane Rosa in 2018 were the last hurricanes to hit Puerto Peñasco. Due to the influence of the Gulf waters, summers are moderated compared to inland areas in both Sonora and Arizona to its north in terms of air temperature, although the apparent temperature remains very hot due to high humidity.

<doc id="654971" wikidata="Q656189" url="?curid=654971" title="Ensenada, Baja California">
<text>Ensenada (&quot;inlet&quot;) is a city in Ensenada Municipality, Baja California, situated on the Pacific Coast of Mexico. Located on Bahía de Todos Santos, the city had a population of 279,765 in 2018, making it the third-largest city in Baja California. The city is an important international trade center and home to the Port of Ensenada, the second-busiest port in Mexico. Ensenada is a major tourist destination, owing to its warm climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, and is commonly known as &quot;La Cenicienta del Pacífico&quot; (&quot;The Cinderella of the Pacific&quot;).

Ensenada was founded in 1882, when the small community of Rancho Ensenada de Santos was made the regional capital for the northern partition of the Baja California Territory. The city grew significantly with the proliferation of mines in the surrounding mountains. While the Mexican Revolution curtailed much of Ensenada&#x27;s expansion, the onset of Prohibition in the United States transformed the city into a popular tourist destination for Americans seeking entertainment and alcohol. Ensenada&#x27;s reputation as a resort town was cemented by the 1950s and 1960s, which saw a construction boom and the city&#x27;s rise in international prominence outside of North America.

Today, Ensenada is a major economic and cultural hub for Baja California. The city is home to numerous universities, like the Ensenada Institute of Technology and the Autonomous University of Baja California, Ensenada. Ensenada is an important biotechnology hub and is home to numerous research institutions, like the Ensenada Center for Scientific Research. The city is a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network.

==History==
At the time the first European explorers arrived in the region, Yuman–Cochimí speaking peoples inhabited the region. Groups such as the Kiliwa, Paipai and Kumeyaay still exist. These hunter-gatherer indigenous peoples lived in the bay area and interior valleys of the Sierra de Juárez and Sierra de San Pedro Mártir. The Kumeyaay had a village where the city is seated that was called Pa-tai.

Bahía de Todos Santos, which Ensenada now borders, was first reached by sea by the Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo on the vessels &quot;El Salvador&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot;. The city was founded on September 17, 1542, under the name &quot;San Mateo&quot;. In 1602, while mapping the coast of the Californias in search of safe harbors for returning Spanish galleons from Manila to Acapulco, Sebastián Vizcaíno renamed the city to &quot;Ensenada de Todos Santos&quot;. &quot;Ensenada&quot; means &quot;bay&quot; or &quot;cove&quot;.

The first permanent settlement was established by the Jesuits during the 17th or 18th century. After the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1768, the Dominicans took over the representation of Europe in what is now Ensenada. In 1805, José Manuel Ruiz Carillo obtained permission to establish himself in Ensenada, being appointed governor of Baja California and building in Ensenada a house that survived until the final part of that century, despite being briefly taken by William Walker, the self-declared &quot;president&quot; of the Republic of Baja California, in 1853–54.

In 1882, Ensenada was designated the capital of Baja California, and attempts at developing the area were made by the English Mexican Land and Colonization Company. These were interrupted by the Mexican Revolution, which left the area devastated. In 1915, the capital was transferred to Mexicali, and in 1930, the population of Ensenada was only 5,000. During the early part of the twentieth century, the city&#x27;s name was shortened from &quot;Ensenada de Todos Santos&quot; to &quot;Ensenada&quot;, a change made in order to avoid confusion with Todos Santos in Baja California Sur.

The twentieth-century development of Ensenada was assisted by prohibition, which sent Americans and Canadians south of their border in search of entertainment and alcohol, developing first Tijuana, then Rosarito, and finally Ensenada as tourist destinations. The Hotel Riviera del Pacífico was opened in 1930, briefly placing Ensenada on the international glamor map and was visited several times by President Miguel Alemán Valdés, international artists and political personalities.

Ensenada truly began to flourish in the early 1950s, at which time the city&#x27;s population had risen to 20,000. The hotel finally closed in 1964. It was later reopened as a cultural center and museum. By this time, other hotels had opened, and the population and economy of Ensenada had grown and diversified towards their present status.

On January 26, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI created the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ensenada with territory taken from the Archdiocese of Tijuana and Mexicali Diocese, making it a suffragan diocese of the Metropolitan Church of Tijuana.

In 2023, ten people were killed in a shootout.

==Geography==

Many of the terrestrial or marine species inhabiting the surrounding the Greater Ensenada area in the Baja California islands are unique. Guadalupe Island, off the coast of the city, is one of the best places in the world for observing the great white shark. The island has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1975.

The city&#x27;s offshore is host to an array of aquatic mammals including the gray whale, the northern elephant seal, the Guadalupe fur seal and California sea lion; terrestrial mammals include various squirrel species, otters, the ring-tailed cat, coyote, bobcat, and puma.

Bird species include hawks, pelicans, roadrunners, and various waterfowl and oceangoing species.

Fish include tilapia, rainbow trout, leopard shark, and the great white shark.

There are no rivers in the city, only surface runoff streams that flow when there have been large amounts of rainfall.

Ensenada has one natural fresh water body, the Lagunita pond, located to the north of El Ciprés military air field, and which has ecological importance.

The average rainfall is per year, falling mainly in the winter months. Ensenada has a mild semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), much like the rest of northwestern Baja California. During the colder months from November to February, rainfall is scarce and temperatures average . On the other hand, the warmer months from June to September are the driest, and during this time maintain an average temperature of .

For Ensenada&#x27;s warm summer coastal location, the city&#x27;s climate is greatly affected by the offshore cold California Current. Due to the current, the late summer and early fall seasons are typically the warmest periods for the city. Santa Ana winds – observed in much of Southern California as well – are responsible for temperature rises at any time of the year. During Santa Anas, wind direction changes and brings warm air from the interior to the coast. Snowfall is rare with the last recent one in January 2007, when the hills south of the city received small amounts of snowfall.

Similar to the South Coast of California, Ensenada experiences the periodic May Gray and June Gloom marine layer effects.

===Tourism===

Ensenada is located some south of the border with the United States, connected via a four-lane toll road MX-1D and a two lane free road, which makes it a natural destination for tourists on short vacations by car. Ensenada&#x27;s proximity to California also makes it a destination for short cruise ship trips from Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach. As of 2005, four cruise lines maintained ships that docked in Ensenada weekly, though, one of these ships—the &quot;Monarch of the Seas&quot;, operated by Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines—ceased operations in the Pacific in mid-October 2008. The world-renowned Baja 1000 off-road race is held in Ensenada every year in late November, while the Baja 500 race is held in early June. Off-road enthusiasts use Ensenada year-round as a starting point to explore Baja California.

Watersports and ocean proximity have formed an integral part of the structure of tourism and its relation to economics in the city. Ensenada and coastal beach towns of Greater Ensenada have several renowned surfing spots, such as San Miguel Beach, California Trailer Park, Stacks and 3 M&#x27;s (&quot;Tres Emes&quot; in Spanish), which are located on the north coast of the city. Todos Santos Island is a small island located west of Ensenada (about two hours by boat) and a world-famous surfing spot. A number of surfing contests, such as the Billabong XXL. have been held at Todos Santos Island. Wave faces can reach above on the island and in December 2006 Brad Gerlach, 2006 winner of Big XXL, surfed a wave of . 
Tourists also stop in the city on their way to their destinations farther south in the municipality where windsurfing spots are located. Maritime activities associated with the city also include the global Newport to Ensenada International Yacht Race, billed as the world&#x27;s largest international sailing event, which begins in Newport Beach and finishes in Ensenada. SCORE International&#x27;s Baja 1000 and Baja 500 desert races also traditionally begin and/or end in the city. Whale watching has also developed as a tourist draw in the city due to the gray whale&#x27;s annual migration from Alaska to the lagoons of Baja California Sur. Between the months of December and March, and back in the months of April and May, whales can be seen from the coast of Ensenada.

The nearby historical mission town of Guadalupe, was revitalized from 1905 to 1910 with immigrant Spiritual Christians, mostly &quot;Pryguny&quot; from the Caucasus, South Russia. After WWII most moved to California to join more prosperous relatives, while many who remained intermarried with Mexicans and live in Ensenada and Tijuana. Two families remaining in the Guadalupe Valley opened museums, a cafe, and participate in wine tourism. The traditional economic activities in Guadalupe are olive and wine production. Currently, about 90% of wine production in Mexico originates in the valleys of Guadalupe and adjacent Calafia. Many local wine producers offer tours and tastings. Every year during the month of August, the beginning of wine harvest season is celebrated in the Guadalupe Valley and in the city of Ensenada with a two-week-long series of cultural and culinary events, all under the title banner of Fiestas de la Vendimia (Wine Harvest Festival). This event attracts people from all over the world.

There is a street in Ensenada called &quot;La Calle Primera&quot; or Adolfo Lopez Mateos (&quot;1st Street&quot;). It&#x27;s a tourism spot in Ensenada due to its many &quot;Curios&quot; (short for &quot;Curiosidades&quot;—trinkets and souvenirs) shops, restaurants, hotels, bars, and popular club. &quot;La Primera&quot; is a very busy street, filled with tourists and locals. &quot;La Primera&quot; is just one block away from &quot;Ventana al Mar&quot; (&quot;Window to the Sea&quot;), a boardwalk/seawall avenue where an enormous Mexican flag is located. The Ensenada Carnaval is one of the country&#x27;s largest, as thousands of people gather in the streets for six days and nights. Just south of the city on Highway 1 is located one of the largest marine geysers in the world, colloquially known as &quot;La Bufadora&quot; (&quot;The Blowhole&quot;). La Bufadora attracts many tourists. The street leading to the viewpoint is a commercial area where a variety of authentic Mexican arts and crafts are for sale; bartering over prices with vendors is customary. There are also seafood restaurants and street vendors selling &quot;churros&quot; (fried pastry with cinnamon and sugar) and other delicacies.

===Research and manufacturing===

Ensenada is developing scientific research and natural science sectors, with special focus in the marine sciences sectors. Ensenada is claimed to be the city with the highest number of scientists per capita in Latin America. The Center of Scientific Research and Higher Education of Ensenada (CICESE) conducts research in Earth Sciences, Applied Physics, Oceanography, Communications and Experimental and Applied Biology. Further research is conducted on the campus of the Autonomous University of Baja California, Ensenada (UABC), mainly in Oceanography and education areas although there are groups in Physics, Biology, and other related sciences. The National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) has a research campus in the city. The campus hosts the Institute of Astronomy and the Centre for Nanosciences and Nanotechnology (CNyN). The National Astronomical Observatory (Mexico) is located on the mountains of the Sierra de San Pedro Martir, south of the city.

The city is home to the largest cluster of bio-medical device companies in Mexico and is a developing center that is drawing a growing number of biotech researchers. Unique to the city is that its biotech cluster is near that of another, larger, cluster in San Diego. The proximity of these two biotech clusters fuels their interaction.

The city is not part of any rail transport grid with which it could use to transport cargo and other materials, although there are plans to build a rail line to the United States border in the short to mid-term future that would link it to San Diego–Tijuana. Unlike the larger cities to the north, Ensenada has only six major industrial parks, compared to 26 in Mexicali and 51 in Tijuana, as its economy is more focused on tourism and technology. Fender guitars and Lowrance fishfinders are manufactured in Ensenada.

===Maritime industry===
The Port of Ensenada has a large influence on the civic economy. Ensenada is home to the only deep-water port in the state of Baja California and on the Baja California Peninsula. The port is part of standard shipping routes that directly link it with the Mexican cities of La Paz, Manzanillo, Mazatlán, Acapulco and Lázaro Cárdenas; the American cities of San Diego, Long Beach and Los Angeles; the Guatemalan city of Puerto Quetzal, the Chilean city of Valparaíso, the Japanese city of Yokohama, and the city of Hong Kong. Ensenada is where the Fender standard series guitars and basses are produced.

In addition to revenue generated by docking cruise ships, fishing accounts for a large part of the economy. More than 90 species of fish are commercially fished in Ensenada; the most important fisheries are tuna, shrimp, California spiny lobster, abalone, sea urchin, sardine, mackerel and seaweed. A large percentage of all catches are exported to East Asia. A tuna embargo imposed on Mexico during the 1990s caused most of the fishing fleet to relocate to the ports of Guaymas, and Mazatlán, further south. To survive, Ensenada&#x27;s tuna industry has shifted its focus to tuna farming, exporting the highly valued meat almost exclusively to Japan. Ensenada has been known for sports fishing over 50 years. Each year hundreds of anglers head for Ensenada to go fishing and take advantage of the shorter distances needed to travel by sea to get to the big catch.

===Agriculture===

The municipality of Ensenada has three main agricultural zones: the Guadalupe-Calafia valleys to the north, the Ojos Negros valley to the east and the San Quintin valley to the south. The main crops are grapes, olives, tomato, wheat, alfalfa, asparagus, green onions and broccoli.

===Mining===
One of the earliest activities in the Ensenada region was gold and silver mining, and some of these mines remain in limited operation. In recent years, very large amounts of gravel have been extracted from creek beds in rural areas and exported for infrastructure works in California in the US. However, this has been a controversial activity, as environmentalists have argued that depleting the creekbeds will decrease the amount of water that is absorbed by the soil during the brief rainy season, negatively impacting the agriculture. As of November 2005, the extraction of gravel remains unchecked. Said extraction activities have been linked to former governor Ernesto Ruffo.

==Culture==

Ensenada&#x27;s diversity as a city is in part attributed to Spanish, Russian, and American influences. Spanish missionaries and Russian settlers began the growth of the wine industry in the city. Reminiscent of this time period are Russian museums in the city.

The city is known for its festivities and laid-back atmosphere, the city hosts many events including the Wine Harvest Festival (Fiestas de la Vendimia) and Ensenada Carnaval. The Wine Harvest Festival celebrates the wine harvest season and in the city and nearby Guadalupe Valley, a series of events takes place.

Typical food in Ensenada consists of fish tacos, which originated in the city, shrimp tacos, and ceviche. These dishes are usually accompanied by avocado and salsa. Another dish characteristic of the port city is carpaccio. The city&#x27;s Mediterranean climate allows for the cultivation of grapes and olives, which in turn make wine and olive oil, respectively. Development of such foods complement Spanish, Italian, French, and Mexican dishes in Ensenada.

==Sports==

Ensenada maintains no professional sports teams in association football, basketball, or baseball, but is known for its water sports. The city has sports fishing venues, and swells that are known for drawing professional surfers.

<text>Fireflies is a novel by Shiva Naipaul originally published in 1970. It was his first book, a comic novel set in Trinidad. In an essay in An Unfinished Journey, Naipaul described how in 1968 as a final year student at Oxford University studying Chinese, he had been moved to write down a sentence, which proved to be the beginning of his first novel, which he then worked on for the next two years. The novel was hailed on publication, winning the Jock Campbell New Statesman Award, the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize.

Writer Martin Amis said of &quot;Fireflies&quot;

<text>John of Cornwall, in Latin Johannes Cornubiensis or Johannes de Sancto Germano was a Christian scholar and teacher, who was living in Paris about 1176.

He is not to be confused with the fourteenth-century John of Cornwall who expounded Latin at his grammar school in English instead of French. There was also an archdeacon of Worcester called John of Cornwall around 1197, who probably was a different person.

==Life and writings==
Little is known of his life. From his names, it is surmised that he was a native of St Germans in Cornwall. He studied with Peter Lombard in Paris, and wrote &quot;Eulogium ad Alexandrum Papam III, quod Christus sit aliquis homo&quot;, a treatise refuting Abelard&#x27;s doctrine that the humanity of Jesus was only a garment clothing the Logos.

The &quot;Eulogium&quot; (dated 1176 or later) was printed by Edmond Martène in &quot;Thesaurus novus anecdotum&quot; (Paris, 1717), and by Jacques Paul Migne&#x27;s in &quot;Patrologiae Latinae Cursus Completus&quot; (1844-1855), vol. CXCIX. Other books attributed to him are:

* &quot;Apologia de Christi Incarnatione&quot; (disputed authorship; perhaps by Hugh of St. Victor).
* &quot;Summa qualiter fiat Sacramentum Altaris per virtutem sanctae crucis et de septem canonibus vel ordinibus Missae&quot;. Migne, &quot;Patrologiae Latinae&quot;, vol. CLXXVII.
* &quot;Prophetia Merlini&quot; or &quot;Merlini prophetia cum expositione&quot;. A poem written between 1141 and 1155, known from a unique manuscript in the Vatican Library.
* &quot;De diuersa consuetudine legendi Sacram Scripturam&quot;. See Friedrich Stegmüller, &quot;Bibl.&quot; 4419; Richard Sharpe, &quot;Latin Writers&quot;, 229.

<text>A highly elliptical orbit (HEO) is an elliptic orbit with high eccentricity, usually referring to one around Earth. Examples of inclined HEO orbits include Molniya orbits, named after the Molniya Soviet communication satellites which used them, and Tundra orbits.

Such extremely elongated orbits have the advantage of long dwell times at a point in the sky during the approach to, and descent from, apogee. Bodies moving through the long apogee dwell appear to move slowly, and remain at high altitude over high-latitude ground sites for long periods of time. This makes these elliptical orbits useful for communications satellites. 

Geostationary orbits cannot serve polar latitudes because their elevation above the horizon from these ground sites is too low. The latitude limit for a GEO sat is 81 degrees with a practical limit of just above 75 degrees. Many GEO comm sats have custom &quot;foot prints&quot; and focus their signals at their primary service areas, so above 60 degrees a larger ground antenna and clear line of sight is needed.

Sirius Satellite Radio used inclined HEO orbits, specifically the Tundra orbits, to keep two satellites positioned above North America while another satellite quickly sweeps through the southern part of its 24-hour orbit. The longitude above which the satellites dwell at apogee in the small loop remains relatively constant as Earth rotates. The three separate orbits are spaced equally around the Earth, but share a common ground track.

<text>The Naval Battle of Lemnos (, ), fought on , was a naval battle during the First Balkan War, in which the Greeks defeated the second and last attempt of the Ottoman Empire to break the Greek naval blockade of the Dardanelles and reclaim supremacy over the Aegean Sea. This, the final naval battle of the First Balkan War, forced the Ottoman Navy to retreat to its base within the Dardanelles, from which it did not venture for the rest of the war, thus ensuring the dominion of the Aegean Sea and the Aegean islands by Greece.

==Prelude==
Following the loss of a number of Aegean Islands to Greece during the first phase of the war in 1912, and its first defeat at the Battle of Elli, the Ottoman Navy sought to check Greek progress by destroying the Greek fleet docked at the port of Moudros, Lemnos. However, it faced the problem of countering the Greek flagship, the , which had already defeated them at Elli. 

The Ottomans developed the plan to slip a fast cruiser through the Greek patrols for a raiding mission in the Aegean, hoping to draw off some Greek ships, possibly even the &quot;Georgios Averof&quot; itself, leaving the remainder of the Greek fleet weakened for attack. Indeed, the cruiser evaded the Greek lookout ships on the night of 13/14 January 1913, and sank a Greek transport ship at Syros the next day, also bombarding the island&#x27;s harbour. This action caused concern in Athens, and an order was sent to the Fleet, commanding it to &quot;sail immediately in pursuit&quot;. Admiral Kountouriotis refused to obey, suspecting an Ottoman trap, and instead prepared for the inevitable exit of the Ottoman Fleet from the Dardanelles Straits.

On the Ottoman side, efforts were made to uplift the morale of the crews, including the hoisting of the original banner of the great corsair and admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa on the flagship, , which was named after him.

==Battle==


The Greek fleet, led by Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis was composed of its 9,960 ton armored cruiser flagship ; the three old ironclad battleships , and ; and seven destroyers. The Ottoman flotilla, led by Captain Ramiz Bey included the pre-dreadnought battleships &quot;Barbaros Hayreddin&quot; and and the older ironclad battleship ; the cruiser ; and five destroyers. The old ironclad remained in the Dardanelles and did not participate in the battle.

At 08:20 on the morning of January 5, the Greek patrols signalled that the Ottoman fleet had appeared. At 09:45, the Greek fleet sailed from Moudros Bay. The two fleets met some 19.3 kilometers (12 miles) SE of Lemnos, sailing southeast in converging columns, with their flagships in front. The gunnery exchange commenced at 11:34, when the two fleets were at a distance of 8400 meters (9186 yards). Immediately the Greek column turned left, further diminishing the distance. Soon after, the &quot;Mecidiye&quot; and the accompanying destroyers turned northeast towards the Dardanelles, followed by the &quot;Mesûdiye&quot; at 11:50, after it had suffered heavy damage from the combined fire of &quot;Hydra&quot; and &quot;Psara&quot;. At 11:54, a successful salvo from the &quot;Georgios Averof&quot; hit the &quot;Barbaros Hayreddin&quot;, destroying its middle tower, forcing it to withdraw towards the Dardanelles, along with the &quot;Turgut Reis&quot; at 12:00. As at Elli, the &quot;Georgios Averof&quot; commenced independent action, using its superior speed, and maneuvering so that it could use the artillery of both its sides, to pursue the Ottoman ships, while the older battleships followed as fast as they could. The pursuit ended finally at 14:30, as the Ottoman ships were nearing the Dardanelles.

==Aftermath==
Throughout the battle, the Ottoman ships achieved an excellent rate of fire, firing about 800 shells, but with dismal accuracy. Only two hits were registered on the &quot;Georgios Averof&quot;, causing one injury and minor damages, while the other battleships escaped unscathed. The Ottoman ships suffered far more. &quot;Barbaros Hayreddin&quot; was hit by over 20 shells, which destroyed much of its artillery, and suffered 32 dead and 45 wounded. &quot;Turgut Reis&quot; suffered a major leak and other minor damages from 17 hits, and 9 dead and 49 wounded. &quot;Mesûdiye&quot; also suffered several hits, but the main damage was caused by a 270mm shell which destroyed the central 150mm gun platform, and caused 68 casualties. This, the final naval battle of the First Balkan War, forced the Ottoman Navy to retreat to its base within the Dardanelles, from which it did not venture for the rest of the war, thus ensuring the dominion of the Aegean Sea by Greece.

For the Greeks, the withdrawal of the Ottoman fleet within the Dardanelles was confirmed by 1st Lieutenant Michael Moutoussis and Ensign Aristeidis Moraitinis on January 24, 1913. They conducted a naval aviation mission, flying their Maurice Farman hydroplane over the Nagara naval base, where they spotted the enemy fleet. During their sortie, they accurately drew a diagram of the positions of the Ottoman fleet, against which they dropped four bombs. Moutoussis and Moraitinis travelled over 180 kilometers (111.8 miles) and took 140 minutes to complete their mission, which was extensively reported in both the Greek and international press.

<doc id="654983" wikidata="Q3198833" url="?curid=654983" title="Kootenays">
<text>The Kootenays or Kootenay ( ) is a region of southeastern British Columbia. It takes its name from the Kootenay River, which in turn was named for the Kutenai First Nations people.

==Boundaries==
The Kootenays are more or less defined by the Kootenay Land District, though some variation exists in terms of what areas are or are not a part. The strictest definition of the region is the drainage basin of the lower Kootenay River from its re-entry into Canada near Creston, through to its confluence with the Columbia at Castlegar &quot;(illustrated by a, right)&quot;. In most interpretations, however, the region also includes:
* an area to the east which encompasses the upper drainage basin of the Kootenay River from its rise in the Rocky Mountains to its passage into the United States at Newgate. This adds a region spanning from the Purcell Mountains to the Alberta border, and includes Rocky Mountain Trench cities such as Cranbrook and Kimberley and the Elk Valley of the southern Canadian Rockies, centred on Fernie. This region also includes part of the Flathead River drainage basin. &quot;(illustrated by b)&quot;
* an area to the southwest encompassing the Columbia&#x27;s drainage from the Kootenay confluence south to the U.S. Border plus the Salmo River basin. This adds the communities of Rossland, Castlegar, Fruitvale and Salmo &quot;(illustrated by c)&quot;
Some or all of the following areas to the north, which drain into the Columbia River, are also commonly included in the Kootenays:
* The Arrow Lakes area, which adds Nakusp. &quot;(illustrated by d)&quot;
* The Upper Columbia Valley, which parallels the first section of the Kootenay River, including the communities of Invermere and Radium Hot Springs &quot;(illustrated by e)&quot;
* The Columbia drainage between the Kicking Horse Pass and the Rogers Pass, in and around the town of Golden. &quot;(illustrated by f)&quot;
* The Columbia drainage between the Rogers Pass and the Eagle Pass, in and around the town of Revelstoke. &quot;(illustrated by g)&quot;
When the above regions are added, sometimes the region&#x27;s name is morphed into Columbia-Kootenay or Kootenay-Columbia, although that terminology also includes the Big Bend Country and Kinbasket Lake, to the north of Golden and Revelstoke, which is not generally considered part of the Kootenays, though part of the Kootenay Land District.

Finally, the Boundary Country, a southern east–west corridor between the Okanagan and the Bonanza Pass and drained by the basins of the Kettle and Granby Rivers, is sometimes mentioned as being in the West Kootenay, and in other reckonings as being part of the Okanagan. In actuality, the settlement of the Boundary Country predates development in either of the regions it is now attached to, as is also the case with the Similkameen Country to the west of the Okanagan. In some descriptions, the Boundary Country includes Osoyoos and Oliver in the South Okanagan (rather than the other way around). The Boundary Country is &quot;(illustrated by h)&quot; In the event of its inclusion, the Kootenays could be described as the complete Canadian portion of the Columbia Basin minus lands drained by the Okanagan River.

==Naming and subdivision==
Contingent on the above boundaries, the Kootenays are commonly split either into East and West, or East, Central and West. In general use amongst locals of the area, the &quot;East/West&quot; convention is more common as a descriptor of where someone is from or where a town is located (rather than splitting the region into &quot;East/Central/West&quot; subregions). That being said:
* The usual East-West separator is the Purcell Mountains, a range running north–south through the region. Areas to the east of this range are deemed to be in &quot;East Kootenay&quot; or the &quot;East Kootenays&quot; while places west of this division are in &quot;West Kootenay&quot; or the &quot;West Kootenays&quot;. This places Creston and points east in the &quot;East Kootenay&quot; (or &quot;East Kootenays&quot;) and Crawford Bay, Salmo and points west in the &quot;West Kootenay&quot; (or &quot;West Kootenays&quot;). 
* The usual East-Central-West separators are the Purcell Mountains splitting East from Central and the Selkirk Mountains splitting Central from West.

It remains unclear why both Kootenay and Kootenays are used somewhat interchangeably to describe the area. The plural form is in reference to &quot;The Kootenays&quot;, both East and West; the singular is in reference to the &quot;Kootenay Region&quot;. In practice the two terms are used interchangeably, although one indicates a geographical region and the other a legal boundary, the Kootenay Land District, which was identical with the original federal and provincial Kootenay ridings.

==Economy==
Once settled by miners, loggers, and rail workers, the area experienced a silver rush in the 1890s. The district now contains important tourism, outdoor activity and fruit-growing regions (Creston Valley) and numerous commercial centres, including Grand Forks, Kaslo, Robson,
Ymir, Warfield, Montrose, Fruitvale, Salmo, Trail, Nelson, Slocan, Playmor, Winlaw, Cranbrook, Kimberley, Fernie, Castlegar, Rossland, Erickson, and Creston.

The region has a large network of outdoor activity operators, with the biggest facilities including lift, cat and heli-skiing. This includes some of the oldest resorts in North America such as Red Mountain, and largest Revelstoke Mountain. The highway that connects them all has been named the powder highway.

With the emergence of fibre internet, digital nomads and technology developers are now a growing part of the economy. Several coworking and innovation centres have sprouted including Kootenay Lake Innovation Centre.

A number of Community Radio stations exist in the region, most notably CJLY-FM in Nelson, CIDO-FM in Creston and Stoke FM in Revelstoke. These stations usually operate either as Cooperatives or as non-profit Societies. Since 2001, The Kootenay Mountain Culture has brought the bioregion together under one magazine. It covers a range of topics including outdoor adventure, environmental issues, arts and culture, local events, and profiles of people living in the region.

<text>The R-1 rocket (NATO reporting name SS-1 Scunner, Soviet code name SA11, GRAU index 8A11) was a tactical ballistic missile, the first manufactured in the Soviet Union, and closely based on the German V-2 rocket. The R-1 missile system entered into service in the Soviet Army on 28 November 1950. Deployed largely against NATO, it was never an effective strategic weapon. Nevertheless, production and launching of the R-1 gave the Soviets valuable experience which later enabled the USSR to construct its own much more capable rockets.

== History ==
In 1945 the Soviets captured several key A-4 (V-2) rocket production facilities, and also gained the services of some German scientists and engineers related to the project. In particular the Soviets gained control of the main V-2 manufacturing facility at Nordhausen. Under the supervision of the Special technical Commission (OTK) established by the Soviet Union to oversee rocketry operations in Germany, A-4s were assembled and studied. This prompted the 13 May 1946 decree of the Soviet Council of Ministers for, in part, the development of a Soviet copy of the A-4, which would be the first domestically produced ballistic missile. A further decree on 16 May converted the M.I. Kalinin Plant No. 88, which had produced artillery and tanks during World War II into NII-88, tasked with managing the Soviet Union&#x27;s long-range rocketry programs.

11 A-4s, six of them assembled at NII-88, the other five at Nordhausen, all by German engineers and technicians, were launched from the Soviet launch site Kapustin Yar in 1947. Only five of the rockets reached their target, roughly the same reliability the rocket had had under the Germans during the war. The experience derived from assembling and launching these rockets was directly applied to the Soviet copy, called the R-1, production of which was authorized by Josef Stalin in April 1947. NII-88 chief designer Sergei Korolev oversaw the R-1&#x27;s development.

== Description and development==
Though the R-1 was a close copy of the German A-4, it was ultimately considerably more reliable than its predecessor thanks to improvements made on the original design. The rocket was in length and weighing 13.5 tons. 9.2 tons of the R-1&#x27;s mass was devoted to propellant: 4 tons of ethyl alcohol and 5 tons of liquid oxygen, which fed the Soviet-designed RD-100 engine. The R-1 missile could carry a warhead of conventional explosive to a maximum range of , with an accuracy of about . a range slightly greater than that of the A-4.

The first tests of the missile began 13 September 1948. This first series revealed a variety of unforeseen issues that affected launch reliability and target accuracy. Six of the ten rockets in this series refused to leave the launch pad at all. Remedial improvements along with experimental design upgrades were made in 1949, with a second series of twenty tests starting in September and October. Launch reliability was 100% and only two missiles failed to reach their targets. The R-1 missile system entered into service in the Soviet Army on 28 November 1950.

The R-1A, a variant of the R-1 with a separable warhead, was tested in 1949. This development was largely in service of the upcoming R-2 (missile), a rocket with the same payload and twice the range of the R-1.

Even after adoption by the Soviet military, reliability of the R-1 remained problematic. The R-1&#x27;s insulated electrical wiring attracted vermin. In one January 1953 incident, thousands of flood-displaced mice disabled many rockets by eating the insulation, requiring &quot;hundreds of cats and repairmen&quot;. Moreover, 10-20% of the missiles launched broke up on reentry—a problem that had also plagued the A-4 in German service. This was traced, in 1954, to heating of the TNT warhead, evaporation of which caused the payload housing to rupture, which in turn, detonated the warhead. This issue was solved in the R-2 and later Soviet rockets through the use of the separable nosecone.

== Military service ==

Just three R-1 brigades, each equipped with six launchers with mobile platforms, were fielded. The first, the 23rd brigade (BON RVGK), was activated in December 1950 and deployed to Kamishin in Volgograd oblast the following month. This unit was later deployed to Belokovorovich in Ukraine; Šiauliai in Lithuania; Dzhambul, Kazakhstan, Ordzhonikidze, Armenia, the Far East, and the Primorsk area. Two other brigades, the 77th and 90th, were formed at Lviv, Khmelnytskyi, and Zhytomyr, Ukraine. They were transferred to the Land Forces in August 1958. Though the R-1 was essentially useless as a weapon against NATO, against which it was almost exclusively deployed, it was, nevertheless, invaluable in laying the foundation of the Soviet rocket industry.

== R-1 sounding rockets ==

High-altitude scientific experiments were conducted with the last two of the R-1As in 1949, and afterward a series of specialized scientific R-1 variants was developed: The R-1B, R-1V, R-1D, and R-1E. Some carried experiments to analyze the upper atmosphere, measure cosmic rays and take far-UV spectra of the Sun. Others carried biological payloads.

Between 22 July 1951 and 14 June 1956, the Soviets launched fifteen of these variant R-1s carrying a pair of dogs as payload. Three of the missions were failures resulting in the death of the animals. The 22 July 1951 launch of an R-1V marked the first time dogs were ever launched into space and recovered, preceding the first American success by two weeks.

<text>The R-2 (NATO reporting name SS-2 Sibling) was a Soviet short-range ballistic missile developed from and having twice the range as the R-1 missile (itself a copy of the German V-2). Developed from 1946-1951, the R-2 entered service in numbers in 1953 and was deployed in mobile units throughout the Soviet Union until 1962. A sounding rocket derivative, the R-2A, tested a prototype of the dog-carrying capsule flown on Sputnik 2 in 1957. The same year, the R-2 was licensed for production in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where it entered service as the Dongfeng 1.

== History ==

In 1945 the Soviets captured several key A-4 (V-2) rocket production facilities, and also gained the services of some German scientists and engineers related to the project. Under the supervision of the Special technical Commission (OTK) established by the Soviet Union to oversee rocketry operations in Germany, A-4s were assembled and studied. This prompted the 13 May 1946 decree of the Soviet Council of Ministers for, in part, the development of a Soviet copy of the A-4, which would be the first domestically produced ballistic missile. A further decree on 16 May converted the M.I. Kalinin Plant No. 88, which had produced artillery and tanks during World War II into NII-88, tasked with managing the Soviet Union&#x27;s long-range rocketry programs. In April 1947 Josef Stalin authorized the production of the R-1 missile, the designation for the Soviet copy of V-2. NII-88 chief designer Sergei Korolev oversaw the R-1&#x27;s development. Testing of the R-1 proceeded from 1948 to 1950, and the R-1 missile system entered into service in the Soviet Army on 28 November 1950.

By the latter half of 1946, Korolev and rocket engineer Valentin Glushko had, with extensive input from German engineers, outlined a successor to the R-1 with an extended frame and a new engine designed by Glushko. The R-2 would have a range of , twice that of the R-1, while maintaining a similar payload of around .

Korolev proposed commencement of the R-2 project in January 1947, but it was declined by the Soviet government, which favored development of the more technologically conservative R-1. Moreover, development of the R-2 was in direct competition with the G-1 missile being concurrently developed by Helmut Gröttrup, head of a German team of engineers. Though the G-1 was a compelling design, able to lift a payload three times heavier than that of the A-4, and with higher precision and a shorter launch preparation time, it was politically infeasible to leave the Soviet missile program in the hands of Germans. Thus, on April 14, 1948, the same decree that authorized the operational production of the R-1 also sanctioned development of the R-2. The G-1 was ultimately never completed.

== Description==

Like its predecessor, the R-1, the R-2 was a single-stage missile using ethanol as a fuel and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer. At a length of and a mass of , the R-2 was longer and the dry weight of was about heavier than the R-1. Maximum body diameter remained , the same as the R-1, and in the interests of conservatism, the R-2 retained the R-1&#x27;s graphite stabilizing fins, though they reduced lifting capacity and caused heating and stress issues.

The R-2 design included four major improvements over the R-1:

*The warhead separated from the rocket prior to atmospheric reentry, enhancing hull strength (one of the V-2/R-1&#x27;s biggest weaknesses) and increasing range.
*The propellant tank became the main load-bearing structure for the rocket, in contrast to the R-1&#x27;s load-bearing hull. This reduced the overall weight of the spaceframe.
*The R-2 had much improved command guidance, and access to the unit was made easier to reduce prelaunch preparation time.
*The RD-101 engine was 50% more powerful than the RD-100 used by the R-1. This increased performance was made possible by raising combustion pressure and increasing the concentration of ethanol fuel.

Test launches of an experimental version of the R-2, designated R-2E, began on 25 September 1949. Five of these slightly shorter () rockets were fired from Kapustin Yar, three of them successfully. The R-1A, a variant of the R-1 developed largely to test the separable warhead concept to be used in the R-2, was also test-flown in 1949. Launches of the full-scale R-2 began on 21 October 1950, the last being fired on 20 December. None of the 12 flights in this series fulfilled their primary objectives due to engine failures, warhead trajectory errors, and malfunctions with the guidance systems. 

A second series of tests was carried out between 2-27 July, 1951. The R-2 had been made more reliable by then, and twelve of the thirteen flights successfully reached their targets. A subsequent series of 18 launches in 1951 had 14 successes. Per an order dated 27 November, 1951, the R-2 was formally adopted as operational armament for the Soviet Union, and production was authorized at factory 586 in Dnepropetrovsk three days later. Mass production began at this factory in June 1953. As with the R-1, reliability remained suboptimal. In a series of 14 operational R-2s test-launched in 1952, only 12 reached their target.

== Military service ==

The R-2 was deployed in Supreme Command Reserve (RVGK) engineer brigades consisting of three divizions each equipped with two rockets and mobile launch equipment. A crew of 11 was required for the launch of each missile, preparations for which took six hours, including 15 minutes for guidance system programming. After preparation, a rocket could stand ready to fire for 24 hours before it required defueling and renewed preparations. The R-2 was launched operationally in temperatures ranging from to , withstanding wind speeds of up to . 

The first two R-2 military units, the 54th and 56th brigades, were formed for the 1952 test launches. Starting in 1953, divisions were deployed to Zhytomyr; Kolomyia; , Novgorod Oblast; Kamyshin, Volgograd Oblast; Šiauliai, Lithuanian SSR; Dzhambul, Kazakh SSR; and Ordzhonikidze, and in the Far East. The R-2 was retired from active service in 1962.

Like the R-1, the R-2&#x27;s utility was limited by the smallness of its warhead. The Geran (Eng: Geranium) radiological warhead, which would disperse radioactive liquid as toxic rain around the impact point, was proposed for use with the R-2. However, this warhead was ultimately never developed.

The West obtained its first photographs of the R-2 (which they designated SS-2 &quot;Sibling&quot;) in December 1959 when aerial surveillance returned images from rockets deployed at Kapustin Yar. These confirmed the dimensions of the rocket and revealed much information about the organization of the RVGK brigades.

== R-2A sounding rocket ==

The R-2 had a maximum altitude of , a two-fold improvement over that of the R-1. This made it a much more desirable vehicle for probing outer space. OKB-1 developed a draft plan for the R-2A sounding rocket in 1956. This new vehicle would loft a capsule housing two dogs and also two strap-on pods for scientific experiments. 

A first series of five launches, each carrying a pair of dogs, was carried out from 16 May 1957 through 9 September. During these flights, the animals experienced several minutes of weightlessness. Just two months later, Sputnik 2 was launched into orbit containing a canine passenger inside a capsule derived from the one used on the R-2A. Sounding rocket flights continued through 1960 with biological and ionospheric packages.

Originally, OKB-1 planned to use the R2A for suborbital human test flights. This was on the assumption that a human orbital flight would not be feasible until the mid &#x27;60s. With the completion of the R-7 Semyorka ICBM, however, it became clear that a crewed mission into orbit would happen much sooner, and the plan was abandoned.

== Chinese version (Dongfeng 1) ==

On 6 December 1957 an agreement was signed to license production of the R-2 to China, which was produced as the Dongfeng 1. In August 1958, a group of OKB-1 senior engineers and several R-2 missiles were sent to China in aid of that country&#x27;s fledgling ballistic missile program. This team was sent home 2 August 1960 amidst increased tension between the Soviet Union and China.

<doc id="654996" wikidata="Q231880" url="?curid=654996" title="Nina Persson">
<text>Nina Elisabet Persson (; born 6 September 1974) is the lead singer and lyricist for the Swedish rock band The Cardigans. She also has worked as a solo artist, releasing two albums as A Camp and one under her own name, and has appeared as a guest artist with several other acts.

==Career==

Persson made her acting debut in the film &quot;Om Gud vill&quot; which was released in 2006.

She appears on the Manic Street Preachers song &quot;Your Love Alone Is Not Enough&quot;, which reached #2 on the UK chart, on the album &quot;Send Away the Tigers&quot;. She also features on the 2009 Sparklehorse/Danger Mouse collaboration &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; singing &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Gone&quot;.

Persson&#x27;s first solo album released under her own name, &quot;Animal Heart&quot;, was released on 10 February 2014 on the independent British record label Lojinx Records.

In 2016, Persson appeared as a guest vocalist on the Local Natives song &quot;Dark Days,&quot; singing the second verse.
In October 2022, Domino Recording Company posted a single by James Yorkston, Persson and The Secondhand Orchestra called &quot;Hold Out For Love.&quot; The track was from the forthcoming album &quot;The Great White Sea Eagle&quot;. She worked with James Yorkston and Karl-Jonas Winqvist of The Second Hand Orchestra on that album in Malmo. She toured in the UK with them in 2022 and 2023. 

She has said that the Cardigans may reform occasionally to play together, but there are no plans to work in a studio to create new music together.

==Personal life==
Persson grew up in Jönköping, Sweden. &quot;I grew up in a middle-class, academic family,&quot; Persson said in 2014: &quot;I lived in a villa with a garden. I had two younger brothers.&quot;

She did not want to be a musician growing up, having an interest in art instead, which resulted in her attending art school. &quot;I never really strived to be a musician; I was just, sort of, recruited into this band. I was bored out of my mind in this small, safe place (Jönköping). I was like, &#x27;Awesome, I get to hang with fun guys.
On 16 June 2001, Persson married American songwriter and author Nathan Larson.

Persson was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2009 and underwent surgical treatment.

After three attempts at in vitro fertilization, their son was born on 30 September 2010. For several years the family resided in Harlem, New York City, but in 2015 they decided to relocate to Malmö, the former base of the Cardigans. In an interview with Swedish daily &quot;Dagens Nyheter&quot; in March 2018, Persson talked about her expatriate years and the return to Sweden. She pointed out that the return to her native country was family business and did not reflect any wish to reboot her old band.

<text>Van Buren State Park is a public recreation area on Lake Michigan south of South Haven, Michigan, United States. The state park, which is maintained and operated by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, is located in the southwest corner of South Haven Township and the northwest corner of Covert Township, just north of the Palisades Nuclear Power Plant. The Van Buren County–owned North Point Conservation Area is located directly north of the park. The park has forested sand dunes, camping, and a swimming beach.

==History==
The park was established in 1966 following the state&#x27;s purchase of from the Harry LaBar Drake family in 1965. Two subsequent land purchases further expanded the park&#x27;s boundaries.

==Activities and amenities==
The park offers swimming, picnicking, playground, 220-site campground, and access to Van Buren Trail State Park.

<doc id="655002" wikidata="Q1754940" url="?curid=655002" title="Philosophy of space and time">
<text>Philosophy of space and time is the branch of philosophy concerned with the issues surrounding the ontology and epistemology of space and time. While such ideas have been central to philosophy from its inception, the philosophy of space and time was both an inspiration for and a central aspect of early analytic philosophy. The subject focuses on a number of basic issues, including whether time and space exist independently of the mind, whether they exist independently of one another, what accounts for time&#x27;s apparently unidirectional flow, whether times other than the present moment exist, and questions about the nature of identity (particularly the nature of identity over time).

==Ancient and medieval views==
The earliest recorded philosophy of time was expounded by the ancient Egyptian thinker Ptahhotep (c. 2650–2600 BC), who said:

The Vedas, the earliest texts on Indian philosophy and Hindu philosophy, dating back to the late 2nd millennium BC, describe ancient Hindu cosmology, in which the universe goes through repeated cycles of creation, destruction, and rebirth, with each cycle lasting 4,320,000,000 years. Ancient Greek philosophers, including Parmenides and Heraclitus, wrote essays on the nature of time.

Incas regarded space and time as a single concept, named &quot;pacha&quot; (, ).

Plato, in the &quot;Timaeus&quot;, identified time with the period of motion of the heavenly bodies, and space as that in which things come to be. Aristotle, in Book IV of his &quot;Physics&quot;, defined time as the number of changes with respect to before and after, and the place of an object as the innermost motionless boundary of that which surrounds it.

In Book 11 of St. Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot;, he reflects on the nature of time, asking, &quot;What then is time? If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one who asks, I know not.&quot; He goes on to comment on the difficulty of thinking about time, pointing out the inaccuracy of common speech: &quot;For but few things are there of which we speak properly; of most things we speak improperly, still, the things intended are understood.&quot; But Augustine presented the first philosophical argument for the reality of Creation (against Aristotle) in the context of his discussion of time, saying that knowledge of time depends on the knowledge of the movement of things, and therefore time cannot be where there are no creatures to measure its passing (&quot;Confessions&quot; Book XI ¶30; &quot;City of God&quot; Book XI ch.6).

In contrast to ancient Greek philosophers who believed that the universe had an infinite past with no beginning, medieval philosophers and theologians developed the concept of the universe having a finite past with a beginning, now known as temporal finitism. John Philoponus presented early arguments, adopted by later Christian philosophers and theologians of the form &quot;argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite&quot;, which states:
:&quot;An actual infinite cannot exist.&quot;
:&quot;An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite.&quot;
:&quot;∴ An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist.&quot;

In the early 11th century, the Muslim physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen or Alhazen) discussed space perception and its epistemological implications in his &quot;Book of Optics&quot; (1021). He also rejected Aristotle&#x27;s definition of &quot;topos&quot; (&quot;Physics&quot; IV) by way of geometric demonstrations and defined place as a mathematical spatial extension. His experimental disproof of the extramission hypothesis of vision led to changes in the understanding of the visual perception of space, contrary to the previous emission theory of vision supported by Euclid and Ptolemy. In &quot;tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things.&quot;

==Realism and anti-realism==
A traditional realist position in ontology is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind. Idealists, by contrast, deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some anti-realists, whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.

In 1781, Immanuel Kant published the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, one of the most influential works in the history of the philosophy of space and time. He describes time as an &quot;a priori&quot; notion that, together with other &quot;a priori&quot; notions such as space, allows us to comprehend sense experience. Kant holds that neither space nor time are substance, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds, rather, that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) events. Although space and time are held to be &quot;transcendentally ideal&quot; in this sense—that is, mind-dependent—they are also &quot;empirically real&quot;—that is, according to Kant&#x27;s definitions, a priori features of experience, and therefore not simply &quot;subjective,&quot; variable, or accidental perceptions in a given consciousness.

Some idealist writers, such as J. M. E. McTaggart in &quot;The Unreality of Time&quot;, have argued that time is an illusion (see also The flow of time, below).

The writers discussed here are for the most part realists in this regard; for instance, Gottfried Leibniz held that his monads existed, at least independently of the mind of the observer.

==Absolutism and relationalism==

===Leibniz and Newton===
The great debate between defining notions of space and time as real objects themselves (absolute), or mere orderings upon actual objects (relational), began between physicists Isaac Newton (via his spokesman, Samuel Clarke) and Gottfried Leibniz in the papers of the Leibniz–Clarke correspondence.

Arguing against the absolutist position, Leibniz offers a number of thought experiments with the purpose of showing that there is contradiction in assuming the existence of facts such as absolute location and velocity. These arguments trade heavily on two principles central to his philosophy: the principle of sufficient reason and the identity of indiscernibles. The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise. The identity of indiscernibles states that if there is no way of telling two entities apart, then they are one and the same thing.

The example Leibniz uses involves two proposed universes situated in absolute space. The only discernible difference between them is that the latter is positioned five feet to the left of the first. The example is only possible if such a thing as absolute space exists. Such a situation, however, is not possible, according to Leibniz, for if it were, a universe&#x27;s position in absolute space would have no sufficient reason, as it might very well have been anywhere else. Therefore, it contradicts the principle of sufficient reason, and there could exist two distinct universes that were in all ways indiscernible, thus contradicting the identity of indiscernibles.

Standing out in Clarke&#x27;s (and Newton&#x27;s) response to Leibniz&#x27;s arguments is the bucket argument: Water in a bucket, hung from a rope and set to spin, will start with a flat surface. As the water begins to spin in the bucket, the surface of the water will become concave. If the bucket is stopped, the water will continue to spin, and while the spin continues, the surface will remain concave. The concave surface is apparently not the result of the interaction of the bucket and the water, since the surface is flat when the bucket first starts to spin, it becomes concave as the water starts to spin, and it remains concave as the bucket stops.

In this response, Clarke argues for the necessity of the existence of absolute space to account for phenomena like rotation and acceleration that cannot be accounted for on a purely relationalist account. Clarke argues that since the curvature of the water occurs in the rotating bucket as well as in the stationary bucket containing spinning water, it can only be explained by stating that the water is rotating in relation to the presence of some third thing—absolute space.

Leibniz describes a space that exists only as a relation between objects, and which has no existence apart from the existence of those objects. Motion exists only as a relation between those objects. Newtonian space provided the absolute frame of reference within which objects can have motion. In Newton&#x27;s system, the frame of reference exists independently of the objects contained within it. These objects can be described as moving in relation to space itself. For almost two centuries, the evidence of a concave water surface held authority.

===Mach===
Another important figure in this debate is 19th-century physicist Ernst Mach. While he did not deny the existence of phenomena like that seen in the bucket argument, he still denied the absolutist conclusion by offering a different answer as to what the bucket was rotating in relation to: the fixed stars.

Mach suggested that thought experiments like the bucket argument are problematic. If we were to imagine a universe that only contains a bucket, on Newton&#x27;s account, this bucket could be set to spin relative to absolute space, and the water it contained would form the characteristic concave surface. But in the absence of anything else in the universe, it would be difficult to confirm that the bucket was indeed spinning. It seems equally possible that the surface of the water in the bucket would remain flat.

Mach argued that, in effect, the water experiment in an otherwise empty universe would remain flat. But if another object were introduced into this universe, perhaps a distant star, there would now be something relative to which the bucket could be seen as rotating. The water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve. To account for the curve that we observe, an increase in the number of objects in the universe also increases the curvature in the water. Mach argued that the momentum of an object, whether angular or linear, exists as a result of the sum of the effects of other objects in the universe (Mach&#x27;s Principle).

===Einstein===
Albert Einstein proposed that the laws of physics should be based on the principle of relativity. This principle holds that the rules of physics must be the same for all observers, regardless of the frame of reference that is used, and that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. This theory was motivated by Maxwell&#x27;s equations, which show that electromagnetic waves propagate in a vacuum at the speed of light. However, Maxwell&#x27;s equations give no indication of what this speed is relative to. Prior to Einstein, it was thought that this speed was relative to a fixed medium, called the luminiferous ether. In contrast, the theory of special relativity postulates that light propagates at the speed of light in all inertial frames, and examines the implications of this postulate.

All attempts to measure any speed relative to this ether failed, which can be seen as a confirmation of Einstein&#x27;s postulate that light propagates at the same speed in all reference frames. Special relativity is a formalization of the principle of relativity that does not contain a privileged inertial frame of reference, such as the luminiferous ether or absolute space, from which Einstein inferred that no such frame exists.

Einstein generalized relativity to frames of reference that were non-inertial. He achieved this by positing the Equivalence Principle, which states that the force felt by an observer in a given gravitational field and that felt by an observer in an accelerating frame of reference are indistinguishable. This led to the conclusion that the mass of an object warps the geometry of the space-time surrounding it, as described in Einstein&#x27;s field equations.

In classical physics, an inertial reference frame is one in which an object that experiences no forces does not accelerate. In general relativity, an inertial frame of reference is one that is following a geodesic of space-time. An object that moves against a geodesic experiences a force. An object in free fall does not experience a force, because it is following a geodesic. An object standing on the earth, however, will experience a force, as it is being held against the geodesic by the surface of the planet.

Einstein partially advocates Mach&#x27;s principle in that distant stars explain inertia because they provide the gravitational field against which acceleration and inertia occur. But contrary to Leibniz&#x27;s account, this warped space-time is as integral a part of an object as are its other defining characteristics, such as volume and mass. If one holds, contrary to idealist beliefs, that objects exist independently of the mind, it seems that relativistics commits one to also hold the idea that space and temporality have exactly the same type of independent existence.

==Conventionalism==
The position of conventionalism states that there is no fact of the matter as to the geometry of space and time, but that it is decided by convention. The first proponent of such a view, Henri Poincaré, reacting to the creation of the new non-Euclidean geometry, argued that which geometry applied to a space was decided by convention, since different geometries will describe a set of objects equally well, based on considerations from his sphere-world.

This view was developed and updated to include considerations from relativistic physics by Hans Reichenbach. Reichenbach&#x27;s conventionalism, applying to space and time, focuses around the idea of coordinative definition.

Coordinative definition has two major features. The first has to do with coordinating units of length with certain physical objects. This is motivated by the fact that we can never directly apprehend length. Instead we must choose some physical object, say the Standard Metre at the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (International Bureau of Weights and Measures), or the wavelength of cadmium to stand in as our unit of length. The second feature deals with separated objects. Although we can, presumably, directly test the equality of length of two measuring rods when they are next to one another, we can not find out as much for two rods distant from one another. Even supposing that two rods, whenever brought near to one another are seen to be equal in length, we are not justified in stating that they are always equal in length. This impossibility undermines our ability to decide the equality of length of two distant objects. Sameness of length, to the contrary, must be set by definition.

Such a use of coordinative definition is in effect, on Reichenbach&#x27;s conventionalism, in the General Theory of Relativity where light is assumed, i.e. not discovered, to mark out equal distances in equal times. After this setting of coordinative definition, however, the geometry of spacetime is set.

As in the absolutism/relationalism debate, contemporary philosophy is still in disagreement as to the correctness of the conventionalist doctrine.

==Structure of space-time==

Building from a mix of insights from the historical debates of absolutism and conventionalism as well as reflecting on the import of the technical apparatus of the General Theory of Relativity, details as to the structure of space-time have made up a large proportion of discussion within the philosophy of space and time, as well as the philosophy of physics. The following is a short list of topics.

===Relativity of simultaneity===
According to special relativity each point in the universe can have a different set of events that compose its present instant. This has been used in the Rietdijk–Putnam argument to demonstrate that relativity predicts a block universe in which events are fixed in four dimensions.

===Historical frameworks===
A further application of the modern mathematical methods, in league with the idea of invariance and covariance groups, is to try to interpret historical views of space and time in modern, mathematical language.

In these translations, a theory of space and time is seen as a manifold paired with vector spaces, the more vector spaces the more facts there are about objects in that theory. The historical development of spacetime theories is generally seen to start from a position where many facts about objects are incorporated in that theory, and as history progresses, more and more structure is removed.

For example, Aristotelian space and time has both absolute position and special places, such as the center of the cosmos, and the circumference. Newtonian space and time has absolute position and is Galilean invariant, but does not have special positions.

===Holes===
With the general theory of relativity, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether spacetime is a substance, since the general theory of relativity largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. One powerful argument against spacetime substantivalism, offered by John Earman is known as the &quot;hole argument&quot;.

This is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows:

Define a function &quot;d&quot; as the identity function over all elements over the manifold M, excepting a small neighbourhood H belonging to M. Over H &quot;d&quot; comes to differ from identity by a smooth function.

With use of this function &quot;d&quot; we can construct two mathematical models, where the second is generated by applying &quot;d&quot; to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time &quot;t&quot;=0, where &quot;t&quot; is a time function created by a foliation of spacetime, but differ after &quot;t&quot;=0.

These considerations show that, since substantivalism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantivalism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantivalism.

==Direction of time==
The problem of the direction of time arises directly from two contradictory facts. Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the macroscopic level, is &quot;not&quot; time-reversal invariant. Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables. We have memories of the past, and none of the future. We feel we can&#x27;t change the past but can influence the future. There is no future without our past.

===Causation solution===
One solution to this problem takes a metaphysical view, in which the direction of time follows from an asymmetry of causation. We know more about the past because the elements of the past are causes for the effects that compose our perception. We cannot affect the past, but we can affect the outcomes of the future.

There are two main objections to this view. First is the problem of distinguishing the cause from the effect in a non-arbitrary way. The use of causation in constructing a temporal ordering could easily become circular. The second problem with this view is its explanatory power. While the causation account, if successful, may account for some time-asymmetric phenomena like perception and action, it does not account for many others.

However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between i) temporal direction and ii) the implications of form and functional capacity.

The application of these ideas of form and functional capacity only dictates temporal direction in relation to complex scenarios involving specific, non-metaphysical agency which is not merely dependent on human perception of time. However, this last observation in itself is not sufficient to invalidate the implications of the example for the progressive nature of time in general.

===Thermodynamics solution===
The second major family of solutions to this problem, and by far the one that has generated the most literature, finds the existence of the direction of time as relating to the nature of thermodynamics.

The answer from classical thermodynamics states that while our basic physical theory is, in fact, time-reversal symmetric, thermodynamics is not. In particular, the second law of thermodynamics states that the net entropy of a closed system never decreases, and this explains why we often see glass breaking, but not coming back together.

But in statistical mechanics things become more complicated. On one hand, statistical mechanics is far superior to classical thermodynamics, in that thermodynamic behavior, such as glass breaking, can be explained by the fundamental laws of physics paired with a statistical postulate. But statistical mechanics, unlike classical thermodynamics, is time-reversal symmetric. The second law of thermodynamics, as it arises in statistical mechanics, merely states that it is &quot;overwhelmingly&quot; likely that net entropy will increase, but it is not an absolute law.

Current thermodynamic solutions to the problem of the direction of time aim to find some further fact, or feature of the laws of nature to account for this discrepancy.

===Laws solution===
A third type of solution to the problem of the direction of time, although much less represented, argues that the laws are not time-reversal symmetric. For example, certain processes in quantum mechanics, relating to the weak nuclear force, are not time-reversible, keeping in mind that when dealing with quantum mechanics time-reversibility comprises a more complex definition. But this type of solution is insufficient because 1) the time-asymmetric phenomena in quantum mechanics are too few to account for the uniformity of macroscopic time-asymmetry and 2) it relies on the assumption that quantum mechanics is the final or correct description of physical processes.

One recent proponent of the laws solution is Tim Maudlin who argues that the fundamental laws of physics are laws of temporal evolution (see Maudlin [2007]). However, elsewhere Maudlin argues: &quot;[the] passage of time is an intrinsic asymmetry in the temporal structure of the world... It is the asymmetry that grounds the distinction between sequences that runs from past to future and sequences which run from future to past&quot; [ibid, 2010 edition, p. 108]. Thus it is arguably difficult to assess whether Maudlin is suggesting that the direction of time is a consequence of the laws or is itself primitive.

==Flow of time==
The problem of the flow of time, as it has been treated in analytic philosophy, owes its beginning to a paper written by J. M. E. McTaggart, in which he proposes two &quot;temporal series&quot;. The first series, which means to account for our intuitions about temporal becoming, or the moving Now, is called the A-series. The A-series orders events according to their being in the past, present or future, &quot;simpliciter&quot; and in comparison to each other. The B-series eliminates all reference to the present, and the associated temporal modalities of past and future, and orders all events by the temporal relations &quot;earlier than&quot; and &quot;later than&quot;. In many ways, the debate between proponents of these two views can be seen as a continuation of the early modern debate between the view that there is absolute time (defended by Isaac Newton) and the view that there is only merely relative time (defended by Gottfried Leibniz).

McTaggart, in his paper &quot;The Unreality of Time&quot;, argues that time is unreal since a) the A-series is inconsistent and b) the B-series alone cannot account for the nature of time as the A-series describes an essential feature of it.

Building from this framework, two camps of solution have been offered. The first, the A-theorist solution, takes becoming as the central feature of time, and tries to construct the B-series from the A-series by offering an account of how B-facts come to be out of A-facts. The second camp, the B-theorist solution, takes as decisive McTaggart&#x27;s arguments against the A-series and tries to construct the A-series out of the B-series, for example, by temporal indexicals.

== Dualities ==

Quantum field theory models have shown that it is possible for theories in two different space-time backgrounds, like AdS/CFT or T-duality, to be equivalent.

==Presentism and eternalism==

According to Presentism, time is an ordering of various realities. At a certain time, some things exist and others do not. This is the only reality we can deal with. We cannot, for example, say that Homer exists because at the present time he does not. An Eternalist, on the other hand, holds that time is a dimension of reality on a par with the three spatial dimensions, and hence that all things—past, present and future—can be said to be just as real as things in the present. According to this theory, then, Homer really &quot;does&quot; exist, though we must still use special language when talking about somebody who exists at a distant time—just as we would use special language when talking about something far away (the very words &quot;near&quot;, &quot;far&quot;, &quot;above&quot;, &quot;below&quot;, and such are directly comparable to phrases such as &quot;in the past&quot;, &quot;a minute ago&quot;, and so on).

==Endurantism and perdurantism==

The positions on the persistence of objects are somewhat similar. An endurantist holds that for an object to persist through time is for it to exist completely at different times (each instance of existence we can regard as somehow separate from previous and future instances, though still numerically identical with them). A perdurantist on the other hand holds that for a thing to exist through time is for it to exist as a continuous reality, and that when we consider the thing as a whole we must consider an aggregate of all its &quot;temporal parts&quot; or instances of existing. Endurantism is seen as the conventional view and flows out of our pre-philosophical ideas (when I talk to somebody I think I am talking to that person as a complete object, and not just a part of a cross-temporal being), but perdurantists such as David Lewis have attacked this position. They argue that perdurantism is the superior view for its ability to take account of change in objects.

On the whole, Presentists are also endurantists and Eternalists are also perdurantists (and vice versa), but this is not a necessary relation and it is possible to claim, for instance, that time&#x27;s passage indicates a series of ordered realities, but that objects within these realities somehow exist outside of the reality as a whole, even though the realities as wholes are not related. However, such positions are rarely adopted.

<text>Afton is an unincorporated community in Cheboygan County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The community is located along M-68 at the boundary between Ellis Township to the south and Koehler Township to the north.

As an unincorporated community, Afton has no legally defined boundaries or population statistics of its own but does have its own post office with the 49705 ZIP Code.

==Geography== 
Afton is a rural community in Cheboygan County in Northern Michigan. The community is centered along M-68, in which the highway at this point forms the boundary between Ellis Township to the south and Koehler Township to the north. Interstate 75 runs about to the west along M-68 and is directly accessible via exit 310 in Indian River. Afton sits at an elevation of above sea level.

Other nearby unincorporated communities include Legrand to the northeast, Fingerboard Corner and Tower to the east, and Indian River to the northwest. The nearest incorporated municipalities are the village of Wolverine to the southwest and the city of Onaway to the east via roadway.

The community is located within the Pigeon River watershed region, which is a tributary of the large Mullett Lake to the northwest. The main branch of the Pigeon River flows to the west, while the middle branch of the Little Pigeon River flows to the east of the community. The smaller Kimberly Creek flows within closer proximity to the east of the community.

Afton contains its own post office located at 498 M-68 in the center of the community. The post office uses the 49705 ZIP Code, which serves the majority of Koehler Township, the eastern portion of Ellis Township, and the western portion of Walker Township. The ZIP Code also serves very small areas in western Waverly Township and Forest Township, as well as northern areas in Nunda Township. The community is served by two separate public school districts. The areas to the south and west are served by Wolverine Community Schools, while the areas to the north and east are served by Indian Lakes Schools.

==History==

The community was first settled under the name Ellisville as early as 1887 when Patrick O&#x27;Connor opened the first lumber camp along the Pigeon River in Ellis Township. Cheboygan County, which was formally organized over 30 years earlier, was experiencing a sudden growth in development during the region&#x27;s lumber exploitation in the 1880s. Many new communities were settled during this time, and the community of Ellisville was named after the township.

Many of the earliest settlers came from Canada and were of French and Irish heritage. A post office began operating under the name Ellisville on April 22, 1905 with storekeeper Fred Bartholomew serving as the first postmaster. Another local resident named MacPherson suggested changing the name to Afton, as he felt that the Pigeon River resembled the River Afton in his native Ayrshire County in Scotland. He originally wanted to change the name to Pigeon River (or Pidgeon River) but the name was deemed too common in the area, and the name Afton was chosen after a compromise. The post office was renamed Afton on February 12, 1906 and remains in operation. Around 1903, Afton was given a station along the Michigan Central Railroad and had a direct route south to the village of Wolverine and also connecting north to Mackinaw City. At the height of the community in the early 1900s, Afton contained several lumber mills, the railway depot, saloons, restaurants, raspberry farms, livestock farms, and stone quarries. Potato farming was also very prominent.

The area&#x27;s first school, the Beebe School, opened around 1898 and enrolled 19 students at the time. A new two-room schoolhouse was built in 1901 and become known as the Afton School. Several nearby schools later organized as Afton Agricultural Schools, which served students up until eighth grade and later tenth grade. Students had to leave Afton to continue their education. The district consolidated with Indian Lakes Schools in Indian River by the 1960s, after which the Beebe School burned down. The defunct Afton School was purchased and restored as a private residence, which still stands today.

As the railroad and lumbering industry declined, Afton benefited from the creation of U.S. Route 23 (US 23), which was commissioned in late-1926. This original route of US 23 provided a direct route from the village of Mackinaw City in the north all the way south to the state of Ohio. The highway passed slightly east of the center of the community. In 1940, US 23 was rerouted to run closer to the Lake Huron shoreline and no longer ran near Afton. The former stretch of US 23 running east of Afton would be turned over to state control and designated as a northerly extension of M-33. In July 1946, the main roadway through Afton would be designated as an eastern extension of M-68 in order to eliminate a gap in that highway&#x27;s route. M-68 remains the main roadway through Afton, and it merges concurrent with M-33 slightly east of Afton in the community of Fingerboard Corner.

After the decline in the lumber industry, the Michigan Central Railroad decommissioned the rail lines in the area, and the lines were later removed by 1937; Afton is no longer served by any railroad. St. Monica’s Catholic Mission Church was established in Afton in 1938. It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Gaylord and is one of the smallest operating Catholic churches in the state.

<text>The Continental Football League (COFL) was a professional American football minor league that operated in North America from 1965 through 1969. It was established following the collapse of the original United Football League, and hoped to become the major force in professional football outside the National Football League (NFL) and the American Football League (AFL). It owed its name, at least in part, to the Continental League, a proposed third Major League Baseball organization that influenced MLB significantly, although they never played a game.

Four Continental Football League contributors are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the most of any league not considered a major league: coach Bill Walsh, quarterback Ken Stabler, Doak Walker and Steve Van Buren (the last two of whom were inducted as players but were coaches in this league). Sam Wyche, Bob Kuechenberg, Garo Yepremian and Otis Sistrunk were among the other players and coaches who would later gain fame in the NFL, while a few others, such as Don Jonas and Tom Wilkinson, would emerge as stars in the Canadian Football League.

==History==
===1965 season===
The formation of the Continental Football League (COFL) was announced on February 6, 1965. The league was primarily formed by minor-league teams that had played in the United Football League and Atlantic Coast Football League.

A. B. &quot;Happy&quot; Chandler, former Kentucky governor, U.S. senator, and retired Major League Baseball commissioner, was named COFL commissioner on March 17, 1965.

The league originally adopted a &quot;professional&quot; appearance. Teams were sorted into two divisions and each team had a 36-man roster with a five-man &quot;taxi&quot; squad. The rules were primarily those of the NFL except that a &quot;sudden death&quot; overtime period was employed to break ties, which was not part of the NFL during the regular season at that time. 
To reinforce an image of league autonomy, teams were restricted from loaning players to, or receiving optioned players from, the NFL or AFL.

The first COFL season opened with three games played on August 14, 1965. Before the season began, the Springfield, Massachusetts, franchise moved to Norfolk, Virginia. The Norfolk club went on to become the most successful team in the league at the box office and held several minor league attendance records throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

===1966 season===

Eastern Division
* Brooklyn Dodgers
* Hartford Charter Oaks
* Norfolk Neptunes
* Philadelphia Bulldogs
* Toronto Rifles

Western Division
* Charleston Rockets
* Montreal Beavers
* Orlando Panthers
* Richmond Rebels
* Wheeling Ironmen

In 1966, the league began abandoning the &quot;league autonomy&quot; posture by striving to establish working relationships with NFL and AFL clubs. Commissioner Chandler, charging that the league was altering the terms under which he had accepted the position, resigned on January 20, 1966. He was replaced by COFL Secretary Sol Rosen, owner of the Newark Bears. Rosen sold the Bears to Tom Granatell, who promptly moved the team to Orlando.

The league engaged in some unsuccessful preseason negotiations with the Empire Sports Network to obtain a television broadcasting agreement. However, it was able to get ABC to broadcast the championship game on the &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;; ABC paid the league $500 for the rights to the game.

The Brooklyn Dodgers, although under the general managership of baseball Dodgers player Jackie Robinson, failed to attract at the gate. Part of the problem was that they were playing nowhere near Brooklyn: their home games were at Downing Stadium on Randall&#x27;s Island.

Evidently, the Dodgers had trouble securing home dates at Downing; a season-ticket application showed only five home games in a fourteen-game schedule. In any event, small crowds (only 29,500 combined for four games, including 12,000 for an exhibition contest) caused the franchise to become a league-operated &quot;road club&quot; in October; one home game against Hartford was moved to Connecticut, and their final &quot;home&quot; contest was shifted to Memorial Stadium in Mount Vernon, New York.

Charleston&#x27;s Coy Bacon, 1966 COFL All-Star end, went on to play for the NFL&#x27;s Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers, Cincinnati Bengals and Washington Redskins.

The league also established farm team relationships with semi-pro clubs (for instance, the Dodgers affiliated with the Liberty Football Conference&#x27;s Long Island Jets in 1966).

===1967 season===

Atlantic North Division
* Akron Vulcans
* Hartford Charter Oaks
* Montreal Beavers
* Norfolk Neptunes
* Philadelphia Bulldogs
* Richmond Rebels
* Toronto Rifles

Atlantic South Division
* Charleston Rockets
* Orlando Panthers
* Wheeling Ironmen

Western Division
* Eugene Bombers
* Long Beach Admirals
* Orange County Ramblers (Anaheim, California)
* Sacramento Buccaneers
* San Jose Apaches
* Seattle Rangers
* Victoria Steelers

The COFL added a Pacific Division for the 1967 season, adding three teams from the Pacific Football League to its ranks - Eugene Bombers (Oregon), Seattle Rangers (Washington) and Victoria Steelers (British Columbia), while the rest of the division comprised from four minor-league teams in California. The Pacific Division was basically a league-within-a-league and played exclusively against other Pacific Division opponents. The remaining teams in the league split into an Atlantic North Division and an Atlantic South Division.

Two of the small western franchises, in Eugene, Oregon, and San Jose, California, left the league after the season, while the franchise in Long Beach only played one game before folding. The Toronto Rifles actually folded &quot;mid-season&quot;, under unusual circumstances: the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League raided the Rifles roster and signed away the Rifles head coach, starting quarterback and starting running back, leaving the team unable to continue.

The remnants of the Brooklyn Dodgers were sold to Frank Hurn, who moved the team to Akron, Ohio as the Akron Vulcans. Hurn used only $2,000 of his own money and $50,000 of Chicago Outfit funding to buy the team and swindled numerous businessmen into providing lavish benefits for his team for which he would never pay. Under Hurn, the team lost $100,000 after just three weeks of play, forcing his big-budget head coaches, Doak Walker and Lou Rymkus, to front their own money to keep the team afloat; Hurn never paid the either the coaches or players for their services, and the Wheeling Ironmen ended up paying the Vulcans&#x27; salaries for what would be the Vulcans&#x27; fourth and final game in order to avoid a strike. Hurn would later amass a long record of criminal activity after his time in Akron.

Such instability marked the season for the COFL, particularly because the league could not improve upon its overall &quot;semi-pro&quot; public image. Inability to establish working relationships with NFL and AFL teams was a contributing factor. The league&#x27;s breakthrough television contract with the upstart United Network was another: the network ended up folding prior to the 1967 season it was supposed to broadcast, leaving the COFL without a television partner yet again.
The San Jose Apaches in 1967 were coached by Bill Walsh, who later achieved great success as the three-time Super Bowl-winning coach of the NFL&#x27;s San Francisco 49ers.

* Chicago Owls
* Indianapolis Capitols

In February 1968, the COFL merged with the Professional Football League of America (PFLA), in order to expand into the midwestern United States. The Quad City Raiders franchise moved to become the Las Vegas Cowboys after losing their first two games.

Danny Hill succeeded Rosen as COFL commissioner. Hill established a weekly payroll ceiling of $200 per player and $5,000 per team.

Ken Stabler played two games for the Spokane Shockers in 1968. Stabler later became the Continental league&#x27;s first Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee as a player through his work with the Oakland Raiders of the NFL.

The Michigan Arrows began their season with a soccer-style kicker named Garo Yepremian, who had played the previous season with the Detroit Lions but had found himself out of work because of military service. Yepremian later found Super Bowl fame in the NFL as a member of the Miami Dolphins.

On September 8, 1968, Glen Hepburn, a two-way player for the Omaha Mustangs, suffered an in-game injury from which he died four days later; it would be the only fatality in the league&#x27;s history.

The Orange County Ramblers were featured in the 1968 film &quot;Skidoo&quot;, in a credited role as stand-ins for a nude Green Bay Packers team. The Ramblers offense is seen, from behind, wearing nothing but helmets, during a scene in which a security guard is hallucinating due to the effects of LSD.

===1969 season===
Jim Dunn replaced Hill as league commissioner for the 1969 season.

The league expanded into Texas by absorbing the Texas Football League, which also brought the first and, to date, only team from Mexico to play in a professional American football league, the Mexico Golden Aztecs (whose owner, Red McCombs, would later buy the NFL&#x27;s Minnesota Vikings). Midway through the season, the Hawaii franchise moved to Portland, Oregon.

The COFL entered the 1969 season with high hopes. That optimism was exemplified by the Orlando Panthers&#x27; bidding for the services of the 1968 Heisman Trophy winner, halfback O. J. Simpson of the University of Southern California (USC). The Panthers made an offer of $400,000 (nearly double the entire team&#x27;s salary) for Simpson to play for the Panthers if his negotiations with the Buffalo Bills fell through; they did not, and Simpson signed with Buffalo for the 1969 season.

But COFL attendance averaged approximately 5,700 spectators per game (the top attended team, Norfolk, had 13,000), insufficient to offset the lack of a TV contract. These economics contributed to the ultimate demise of the league after the 1969 season. Plans for an interleague exhibition between the COFL champion Capitols and the Canadian Football League champion Ottawa Rough Riders had been laid, but the Rough Riders backed out.

The Alabama Hawks played a pre-season game against the NFL&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons rookies, losing 55–0.

The Indianapolis Capitols featured a rookie quarterback named Johnnie Walton during the 1969 season. Walton would become a regular in second-tier professional football; after several failed attempts to get onto an NFL roster in the early 1970s, Walton got his break in the World Football League, starting for the San Antonio Wings in 1975. Walton would spend the 1976–79 seasons as an NFL backup, then came out of retirement in 1983 to lead the Boston Breakers of the United States Football League.

COFL&#x27;s alum Don Jonas did not reach the NFL, but instead chose to play in Canada after the 1969 season. As Orlando Panthers quarterback, he played four seasons before joining the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL). Jonas led Orlando to the 1967 and 1968 COFL championships, and was named the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player for each season. He also paced the Panthers to the 1966 championship game, which they lost to Philadelphia in overtime; and to the COFL semifinal game in 1969. Don was inducted into the American Football Association&#x27;s Semi Pro Hall of Fame in 1983. Many CFL teams used the COFL as a developmental league sending players that need time to improve their skills.

Obert &quot;Butch&quot; Logan, a receiver, defensive back and player-coach, played his penultimate season in professional football with the Continental league&#x27;s San Antonio Toros. Logan is notable for being the last professional football player to wear the singular jersey number zero (two others, Ken Burrough and Jim Otto, would wear a double zero, 00, into the 1970s).

== The end of the COFL ==
A number of franchises folded or defected during and after the conclusion of the 1969 season, making the end of the COFL all but inevitable.

* September 21, 1969: The Mexico Golden Aztecs ceased operations and forfeited the remainder of their 1969 schedule.
* December 15, 1969: The COFL revoked the franchises of the Chicago Owls, Ohio Valley Ironmen, and Omaha Mustangs for failure to meet the league&#x27;s financial obligations.
* February 18, 1970: The Jersey Jays moved to the Atlantic Coast Football League (ACFL).
* February 22, 1970: The defending champion Orlando Panthers announced their departure from the league and the establishment of the &quot;Sunshine League,&quot; a Florida-based loop. The Sunshine League never materialized.
* March 6, 1970: At the annual COFL owners meeting in Chicago, the defending champion Indianapolis Capitols and the Norfolk Neptunes announced their withdrawal from the league 
* March 10, 1970, COFL commissioner James Dunn announced his resignation effective the end of that month. No replacement was ever found, and there was never any announcement of the league&#x27;s cessation.
* March 11, 1970: The San Antonio Toros announced the formation of the Trans-American Football League, taking with them the Fort Worth Braves and Dallas Rockets. The TAFL initially planned to be a nationwide league with teams in various major markets; by the time it began play in fall 1970, this was not the case, and the Omaha Mustangs (the only TAFL team to play outside Texas) and Texarkana Titans had joined the league.
* March 27, 1970: The Arkansas Diamonds folded.
* April 4, 1970: The Indianapolis Capitols, Norfolk Neptunes and Orlando Panthers (now under new ownership) were accepted for membership by the ACFL for 1970.
* May 2, 1970: The ACFL held a dispersal draft of players from the Las Vegas Cowboys, Ohio Valley Ironmen, Arkansas Diamonds, Chicago Owls, Tri-City Apollos, and Alabama Hawks.
* July 2, 1970: The Sacramento Capitols folded after selling less than half of the 3,000 season tickets needed to remain viable. By this point, only Spokane, Portland and Seattle remained in the league. Spokane was, according to secondhand reports, ready to play, but there would not be enough teams to do so; Portland&#x27;s failure to answer phone calls marked the effective end of the league.

<text>Grey import vehicles are new or used motor vehicles and motorcycles legally imported from another country through channels other than the maker&#x27;s official distribution system or a third-party channel officially authorized by the manufacturer. The synonymous term parallel import is sometimes substituted.

Car makers frequently arbitrage markets, setting the price according to local market conditions so the same vehicle will have different real prices in different territories. Grey import vehicles circumvent this profit-maximization strategy. Car makers and local distributors sometimes regard grey imports as a threat to their network of franchised dealerships, but independent distributors do not since more cars of an odd brand bring in money from service and spare parts.

In order for the arbitrage to work, there must be some means to reduce, eliminate, or reverse whatever savings could be achieved by purchasing the car in the lower-priced territory. Examples of such barriers include regulations preventing import or requiring costly vehicle modifications. In some countries, such as Vietnam, the import of grey-market vehicles has largely been banned.

==Overview==
Grey imports are generally used vehicles, although some are new, particularly in Europe where the European Union tacitly approves grey imports from other EU countries. In 1998, the European Commission fined Volkswagen for attempting to prevent prospective buyers from Germany and Austria from going to Italy to buy new VWs at lower pre-tax prices; pre-tax price is lower in Italy, as in Denmark, due to higher tax on cars. It is even possible for car buyers in the United Kingdom to buy right-hand drive cars in EU countries with right-hand traffic where left-hand drive cars are the norm.

Japanese used vehicle exporting is a large global business, as rigorous road tests and high depreciation make such vehicles worth very little (in Japan) after six years, and strict environmental laws make vehicle disposal expensive. Consequently, it is profitable to export them to other countries with left-hand traffic, such as Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, Malta, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda, Zambia, Mozambique, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Cyprus. Some have even been exported to countries such as Peru, Paraguay, Russia, China, Mongolia, Yemen, Burma, Canada, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, despite the fact that these countries drive on the right. It is actually &quot;because&quot; of these vehicles&#x27; RHD configuration that many of them are sent to LHD countries in the first place, for use as mail delivery vehicles. Many Japanese market Jeep Cherokees, for example, have found new use with rural mail carriers in the United States.

Thailand is the third largest exporter of brand new and used right-hand drive cars after Japan and Singapore, because of that country&#x27;s high-volume production of diesel 4x4 vehicles such as the Toyota Hilux Vigo, Toyota Fortuner, Mitsubishi L200, Nissan Navara, Ford Ranger, Chevy Colorado, and others. The Toyota Vigo is the most exported vehicle by parallel exporters. Unlike Japanese and Singaporean exports, the majority of Malaysia&#x27;s grey exports are of new vehicles and the market is dominated by two companies. One of them known as Alpha Automobile Co., Ltd. These trucks are also exported many countries include Japan due to Japanese domestic makers no longer officially selling them through authorized dealers there.

Similarly, there are exports of left hand drive (LHD) used cars from Germany to countries in Eastern Europe, some EU countries (less likely Spain, Portugal and Greece) and West Africa (especially Ghana and Nigeria, not Senegal and its surrounding countries). Some cars in the United States are sold only as export by insurance companies due to them having been stolen and recovered, or damaged in other ways.

==By country==

===United States===
Because the United States and Canada uniquely have not signed onto United Nations Economic Commission for Europe standards for automobile design (see World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations), they use an anomalous set of motor vehicle safety and emission regulations.

For the U.S., these are developed and administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). They differ significantly in detail from the international UN Regulations used throughout the rest of the world.

From 1976 to 1988, individual Americans were actually able to obtain cars conforming to World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations standards and &quot;convert&quot; them to vehicles compliant with U.S. regulations - this was known as the &quot;grey market,&quot; in that it was a legal activity parallel to officially sanctioned manufacturer efforts.

Vehicle manufacturers face considerable expense to type-certify a vehicle for U.S. sale this amount is not widely publicized, but Automotive News cites a 2013 model vehicle where this modification cost US$42 million. This cost particularly affects low-volume manufacturers and models, most notably the makers of high end sports cars. However, larger companies such as Alfa Romeo and Peugeot have also cited costs of &quot;federalizing&quot; their vehicle lineups as a disincentive to re-enter the U.S. market.

====Pre-1968: Era of Freedom====
During the Second World War American servicemen stationed in Europe experienced the benefits of light, nimble British sports cars (e.g., the MG T-type) and shipped them home on their return. There were no legal restrictions to this behavior until 1967. Some owners even acted as sales reps for manufacturers who were happy to help, leading to official imports and the British sports car craze in North America. As with future waves of imported cars, this led the U.S. automakers to develop domestic models, including the Nash-Healey, Ford Vega, Ford Thunderbird, and Chevrolet Corvette.

====1968: Walled Garden====
Beginning in 1968, U.S. regulations surrounding vehicle importing became far harsher, and many vehicles, like the Mini, were immediately excluded from the market.

NHTSA and EPA regulations post 1968 criminalize the possession of a vehicle not meeting U.S. standards. Exceptions exist for foreign nationals touring the U.S. in their own vehicle and for cars imported for Show and Display purposes.

====Response of Market Demand====
Unavailability of certain foreign models encoouraged demand for grey market vehicles arose during the &quot;Malaise era&quot; in the late 1970s. Importing them into the US involved modifying or adding certain equipment, such as headlamps, sidemarker lights, bumpers, and a catalytic converter as required by the relevant regulations. The NHTSA and EPA would review the paperwork and then approve possession of the vehicle. It was also possible for these agencies to reject the application and order the automobile destroyed or re-exported. The grey market provided an alternative method for Americans to acquire desirable vehicles, and still obtain certification.

Tens of thousands of cars were imported this way each year during the 1980s.
The vast majority of these imports were by individuals importing just one car. Many otherwise unavailable vehicles entered the US via the grey market, like the Citroën CX, Range Rover Classic, Renault 5 Turbo, and Mercedes-Benz G-Class.

====1988: Crackdown====
The grey market was successful enough that it ate significantly into the business of Mercedes-Benz in North America and their dealers. The corporation launched a successful multi-million-dollar congressional lobbying effort to stop private importation of vehicles not officially intended for the U.S. An organisation called AICA (Automotive Importers Compliance Association) was formed by importers in California, Florida, New York, Texas, and elsewhere to counter some of these actions by Mercedes lobbyists, but the Motor Vehicle Safety Compliance Act was passed in 1988, effectively ending private import of grey-market vehicles to the United States. There have been allegations of improper lobbying, but the issue has never been raised in court.

As a result of being practically banned, the grey market declined from 66,900 vehicles in 1985 to 300 vehicles in 1995. It is no longer possible to import a non-U.S. vehicle into the United States as a personal import, with four exceptions, none of which permits Americans to buy recent vehicles not officially available in the United States.

====Registered Importer====
After 1988, a vehicle not originally built to U.S. specifications can, under certain, very limited circumstances be imported through a registered importer or independent commercial importer, who modifies the vehicle to comply with US equipment and safety regulations and then certifies it as compliant, at enormous expense. In practice, this avenue is nearly impossible, even for an extremely wealthy individual. Those who import nonconforming motor vehicles sometimes bring in more than one car at a time to spread the substantial cost of the necessary destructive testing, modification, and safety certification. Destructive crash testing is required if the vehicle is substantially similar to a model sold in the U.S.

====Canadian cars in U.S.====
Even Canadian-market vehicles may not meet these requirements. Since Canadian regulations are similar to those in the U.S., an individual can import a vehicle manufactured to Canadian motor vehicle safety standards if the original manufacturer issues a letter stating that the vehicle also conforms to U.S. motor vehicle standards. The decision to issue a compliance letter is solely at the discretion of the manufacturer, even if the vehicle is known to meet U.S. standards. Before issuing a compliance letter, most manufacturers request proof that the owner of the vehicle is a resident of Canada, and that the car was registered and used in Canada for a minimum period. This is done because the manufacturers maintain separate pricing structures for the U.S. and Canadian markets.

====25-year rule====
In 1989, NHTSA granted vehicles over 25 years of age dispensation from the rules it administers, since these are presumed to be collector vehicles. However, there are two exceptions to the rule. One is California, where vehicle emissions requirements make it difficult to register a classic vehicle from overseas. (California Smog Check is mandated for automobiles 1976 and newer.) In 21 states, mini trucks (JDM market kei trucks) of any age can be legally imported and registered as a utility vehicle with on-road use and top speed restrictions varying by state, although states that allow mini trucks to be operated on public roads prohibit their operation on Interstate highways. In 2021, Maine began deregistering third-generation Mitsubishi Delica vans that were legally imported through the dispensation by classifying it as an off-road all-terrain vehicle. Rhode Island also deregistered legally imported Kei cars (including non-van models) in October 2021, citing a best practices guideline (non-legally binding) issued by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.

====JDM====
Some Americans are interested in Japanese domestic market vehicles, like the Nissan Skyline. In 1999, a California company called Motorex had a number of Nissan Skyline R33 GTS25s crash-tested. They submitted their information to NHTSA and petitioned for 1990–1999 GT-Rs and GTSs to be declared eligible for import.
Many Skylines were subsequently imported through Motorex. This lasted until late 2005, when NHTSA learned not all 1990 through 1999 Skyline models would perform identically in crash testing. Motorex had submitted information for only the R33, but had asserted that the data applied to R32, R33, and R34 models. NHTSA determined that only 1996–1998 R33 models have been demonstrated as capable of being modified to meet the federal motor vehicle safety standards, and that only those models are eligible for import. In March 2006, Motorex ceased all imports and Motorex principal Hiroaki &quot;Hiro&quot; Nanahoshi was arrested and held on $1 million bail on financial, kidnapping, and assault charges.

====Market demand signals from grey market====
Penetrating the market via the grey market first, is a valid market entry strategy. The Lamborghini Countach was initially only available as a grey market vehicle (from 1976 to 1985), as were the Range Rover and Mercedes-Benz G-Class. These automakers later made US models to meet the demand.

This avenue of vehicle availability was increasingly successful, especially in cases where the US model of a vehicle was less powerful and/or less well equipped than versions available in other markets. For example, Mercedes-Benz chose to offer only the sluggish 380 SEL model in 1981 to Americans, some of whom wanted the much faster 500 SEL available in the rest of the world. BMW had the same issue with their 745i Turbo.

Nissan developed the 2008 Nissan GT-R to meet this market demand in the United States.

As with the earlier &quot;G-Wagen&quot; and &quot;560 SEL&quot;, Mercedes-Benz was also able to use the grey market to read market demand signals with the Smart Fortwo, which was imported in this manner in 2004–2006, prior to its official U.S. release in 2007.

===Canada===
Cars not originally manufactured to Canadian-market specifications may be legally imported once they are 15 or more years old. This has led to the import of many Japanese sports cars such as the Nissan Skyline. The only categorical exception to the 15-year rule is that many – but not all – vehicles manufactured to United States-market specifications can legally be imported into Canada under the compliance modification and inspection program administered by the Registrar of Imported Vehicles. Typically, modifications to meet Canadian standards include the installation of daytime running lights and tether anchors to permit secure attachment of infant car seats, documentation indicating that any repairs required in response to the original manufacturer&#x27;s factory recalls are complete, and passenger cars assembled on or after September 1, 2007 are also required to have an immobilization system that meets the CMVSS 114 standard. Labelling of the vehicle to indicate its imported status, to warn that the odometer is counting in miles (as made-for-Canada odometers have used kilometres since 1976) and to translate safety-related warning labels (such as airbag maintenance procedures) is typically also required. Speedometers in US and most Canadian vehicles indicate both miles per hour and km/h, either with dual calibration or with a single set of numbers that can be made to display miles or kilometres at the driver&#x27;s option, so are usually left unmodified.

In March 2007, Transport Canada initiated proposed rulemaking to change the importation laws such that vehicles not originally manufactured to Canadian-market specifications would be eligible for import only once they are 25 years old, rather than the present 15-year cutoff rule. The main impetus behind this proposal is the significant influx of Japanese-market vehicles in Canada in recent years, particularly in Western provinces such as British Columbia due to geographical proximity to Asian ports of departure. BC&#x27;s public auto insurance administrative body, Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, in 2007 released a report finding that right-hand drive vehicles are involved in 40% more crashes than left-hand drive vehicles in that province.

===New Zealand===
In the 1980s, New Zealand eased import restrictions, and reduced import tariffs on cars. Consequently, large volumes of used cars from Japan appeared on the local market, at a time when most cars in New Zealand were locally assembled, and expensive compared to other countries, with most used cars available being comparatively old.

Local buyers now had a much wider choice of models, but despite specifications being higher than so-called &quot;NZ New&quot; cars, there were many problems with &quot;clocking&quot; or odometer fraud, with the odometer wound back to display a much lower mileage. Other problems include vehicles damaged in accidents in Japan. This is in contrast to those imported from Australia, for which the history of such vehicles, including write-offs, is readily available from insurance companies.

However, the widespread availability of used Japanese imports prompted official importers to reduce the price of brand new cars, and in 1998, New Zealand became one of the few countries in the world to remove all import tariffs on motor vehicles.

Grey market vehicles comprise a majority of cars in the national fleet. These secondhand imports have achieved &#x27;normal&#x27; status and are used and serviced without comment throughout society. A huge industry servicing and supplying parts for these vehicles has developed. After years of trying to stop grey imports the car companies themselves have become involved, importing in competition with their own new models and providing owners with spare part and repair services. Russia and many African countries, albeit not South Africa where second-hand car imports are illegal, import large quantities of secondhand vehicles from Japan and Singapore.

Nevertheless, a great many used vehicles are imported, 94.6 percent of which come from Japan, most of which are Japanese makes. Most of the other makes are German, such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen. There are a smaller number of United States makes such as Chevrolet and Chrysler, which were built in right hand drive for the Japanese market. Although in heavy decline from 2005, used-vehicle import totals are higher than those of vehicles first registered in New Zealand. In 2006, 123,390 ex-overseas vehicles were registered, compared to 76,804 brand new vehicles.

Used vehicles must, with some exceptions, be right-hand drive, and they must comply with recognised European, Australian, Japanese, or American emission and safety standards, or they are ineligible for import to New Zealand.

In some cases a left-hand drive vehicle can be imported into New Zealand if it meets certain conditions or is a specialized vehicle. Left-hand drive vehicles 20 years or older normally do not have to meet any special requirements but must weigh no more than 3500 kg.

===Ireland===
Japanese used car importing has been quite common in Ireland since the 1980s. The imported cars are cheaper than local used cars due to the very low value of used cars in Japan (and to an extent, used products in general), and a much larger range of specifications are available on Japanese models compared to the very limited ranges sold locally even in comparison to the UK, model ranges of Japanese cars can be very limited mostly due to the high vehicle-registration tax and other taxes imposed on new cars sold in Ireland.

For example, the Toyota Corollas sold in the late 1980s up until the late 1990s (E90 and E100 series) were only available in Ireland in one specification level, with few features and only the base 1.3 litre petrol and diesel engines. In Japan, however, 1.5 and 1.6 litre engines were also available, with around 6 different trim levels, options such as sunroofs, central locking and electric windows available on many specs as early as 1989, ABS and driver airbags optional since 1991, four-wheel drive, and performance GT models. Very basic saloons and diesel-engined models with automatic transmissions also appealed to taxi drivers.

In more recent years, Japanese imports have become less common with typical family cars, probably due to the great change in the Irish economy over the past 20 years people generally have larger incomes now, and sales in new cars have soared. Imports from Japan has become more of a specialty market now importing of sports models not originally available in Europe such as the Mitsubishi FTO, Toyota Corolla Levin/Toyota Sprinter Trueno, Toyota Starlet Glanza and Honda Integra has become quite popular, and sports cars like the Nissan Skyline GT-R, Toyota Supra and Mazda RX-7 are more easily available as imports. Also, small commercial kei car models such as the Daihatsu Midget II and Nissan S-Cargo are used by some businesses as advertising aids, as they are quite distinctive and eye-catching on the roads in Ireland.

No modifications are required for Japanese imported cars to be registered and driven on the roads in Ireland. One disadvantage is that Japan uses a different FM radio band than everywhere else, so a band expander or a replacement stereo system is required to receive the full FM band used locally. Like all other cars used on public roads in Ireland, Japanese imports have to pass the National Car Test.

Other used imports sold in Ireland are from the UK, the most readily identifiable being those from General Motors, which badges its cars in the UK as Vauxhalls, not as Opels as in Ireland. As of 2007 the number of cars being Imported into the Republic of Ireland from both Northern Ireland and Great Britain is at record high levels due to high new-car taxation in Ireland and the fact that UK cars are of a higher spec than Irish ones. This trend was highlighted by RTÉ in a consumer programme entitled &quot;Highly Recommended&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, many people have chosen to buy new cars in other EU member states, where pre-tax prices are much lower than in the UK, and then import them into their own country, where they only pay the UK&#x27;s rate of value added tax (VAT). This is especially the case in Northern Ireland, as pre-tax prices in the Republic of Ireland are kept low because of a vehicle registration tax levied on top of VAT. Other UK buyers can also request a model in RHD when ordering from a dealer in continental Europe for a small supplement. Motor dealers in the EU are compelled under EU competition law to supply right-hand drive models at the same price as LHD models should a buyer request it. Strictly speaking, such imports are known as parallel imports.

Warranties on new cars bought in an EU member state are valid throughout the EU, meaning that a UK resident who has bought a new car in another member state and then imports it into the UK will be covered by the same warranty. However, whereas UK warranties tend to be for three years, those in other EU countries may be only for one or two.

There are also some Japanese imported cars found in the UK, the most popular being the Mazda Eunos Roadster, Nissan Figaro and Mitsubishi Pajero as well as performance cars such as Nissan Skylines, Mitsubishi FTOs and highly tuned Subaru Impreza and Toyota Supra variants that were never officially imported into the UK. These cars tend to be cheaper than official UK imports, but often have better Japanese domestic market specification levels by comparison. The range of Japanese vehicles in the UK is rising all the time as UK customers see the impressive high spec, low-mileage Japanese vehicles on the roads. Each month new models are being imported by dealers and rapidly become popular on the UK market.

Importing a vehicle from outside of the EU may require the vehicle to be subjected to an IVA test if the vehicle is under ten years of age. This test is carried out by the government agency known as the DVSA. If the vehicle is left hand drive this is fairly straightforward to submit an IVA test application and then present the vehicle to the local test station. The vehicle will likely need changes to lighting systems e.g. amber turn signal indicators in the rear, the installation of a rear foglight and headlight alignments for driving on the left. If the vehicle being imported is right hand drive then it must be a personal import i.e. owned by yourself for at least 6 months and you are returning to live in the UK permanently having lived outside of the EU for at least 12 months.

===Australia===

In Australia, the commercial import of used motor vehicles is significantly regulated and restricted by the Department of Infrastructure.

The allowed imports are limited to what are called special and enthusiast vehicles (SEVS), or cars manufactured 25 years ago and older (With the introduction of the ).

All vehicles imported into Australia must also be listed on the &quot;Register of Approved Vehicles&quot;

Limitations of vehicles manufactured after 1 January 1989 was to ensure compliance with the regulations governing safety of vehicles on Australian Roads that came into force on this date.

Until the present regulations entered force at the start of 2004, cars over 15 years old could be imported, and would need to gain a Vehicle Inspection in Australia (needed for registration transfer in many states anyway) and often safety modifications to ensure that they met with regulations that would have been in force at the time of their manufacture.

To bring a special or enthusiast vehicle into Australia, the importer must either apply to have the car added to the SEVS register, or import a car already listed on the register.

Vehicles can also be imported to Australia under what is known as a &quot;Type Approval&quot;, this is generally used by remanufacturing companies who wish to import a vehicle that is commercially sold overseas, and remanufactured for use in Australia. Examples of vehicles such as this are the Chevrolet Camaro, the RAM Trucks, and the Ford F-Series.

Grey imports can pose considerable challenges, due to Australia using Left Hand Traffic, as opposed to the more common Right-Hand Traffic.

This means that vehicles produced for compliance from a country that uses Right Hand Traffic would need a number of modifications to be compliant with the Australian Design Rules, these modifications must be compliant with the Vehicle Standards Bulletin 14, primarily the components that relate to Suspension and Steering, and Lighting 

Vehicles imported into Australia must be complied by a Registered Automotive Workshop for use on the roads in Australia. This is different to a regular workshop as detailed in the Vehicle Inspection in Australia article, where a regular automotive workshop can be authorised to conduct vehicle safety inspections in most states.

====External Territories====

Australia&#x27;s external territories include Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and Norfolk Island.

You do not need to obtain an approval under the RVS legislation to import a road vehicle into an external Australian territory.

However, you do need to obtain an approval to import a road vehicle into Australia from an Australian external territory.

===Russia===

In Russia, grey imports, both new and used, comprised, at certain points, up to 80% of all automobile fleets, because of domestic production being unable to meet the market demands, both in numbers and in quality, especially in the early to mid-1990s.

In western Russia, most imports were from Germany, while to the east of the Ural Mountains where the cost of delivery made both the German imports and domestic productions particularly unattractive, a thriving industry of importing used vehicles from Japan developed. Even though Russia is a left hand drive country, RHD vehicles are nevertheless legal there, provided that some adjustments (e.g. retuning the headlights) are made, but these are cheap and easily done, thus making the cheap and well-built Japanese cars, trucks and tractors (which proved sturdy enough to withstand severe Russian climate, bad roads, often inadequate servicing and questionable quality of fuel/oil) particularly attractive to the customer. In main import centers such as Vladivostok and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk a large-scale service and aftermarket industry developed, including parts depots, auction houses, and logistic centers, all geared for servicing and supporting this relentless import drive. The authorities tried to fight this phenomenon to protect the domestic industry, but the effects have so far been mixed. While increasingly stringent technical requirements and stiffer import tariffs had some effect, they only managed to force the locals to import newer and more expensive vehicles, and to invent various quasi-legal ways to circumvent these regulations. Japanese manufacturers themselves have also stepped in, creating local assembly plants that produce new, left-hand drive models to try to compete with the grey imports.

South Korean used vehicle imports become highly prominent in Vladivostok, as the solution to save Russian market from sanctions they have caused by the suspension of Japanese used vehicle imports from 2014 onwards.

===China===
The parallel market has existed to a limited extent in China for several years, especially in port cities Tianjin and Dalian. The Shanghai free trade zone has a &#x27;car dealer&#x27; where new cars imported from other territories are sold. Due to price arbitrage, these vehicles can be significantly cheaper than the same vehicle available from the official distributor. For example, a Porsche Cayenne parallel imported from the United States are priced significantly cheaper, sometimes up to CNY 200,000 ($30,000) than the official version sold in Chinese markets due to heavy dealer markups.
===Hong Kong===

Although Hong Kong is a Special administrative Region of China, the cars in Hong Kong are Right Hand Drive, which in contrast with China. Quite a lot of used cars from Japan are registered in Hong Kong, including both Japanese makes and even European makes, since both Hong Kong and Japan are right hand drive. In addition to used cars from Japan, some new cars are also independently imported too. In order to register the car in Hong Kong, the car must be right hand drive, less than seven years old, gasoline powered, meets Euro VIc emission and noise standards, with E-mark for all glasses, all lamps and safety belts, and an unleaded-fuel restrictor installed (if not present already). For cars over 20 years old, they can be imported as classic cars and do not have to meet Euro VIc emission standards. However, Hong Kong does not accept privacy windows. If a Japanese used car is fitted with privacy windows, it must be converted to AS-2 standard clear glass in order to register in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong does not have import tax for cars, however, the first registration tax is high. And the first registration tax rate is progressive, which means a higher price car will fall into a higher tax bracket. Since the used car values are mostly lower than new cars of the same model, used car can enjoy a lower tax rate due to depreciated car value.

===Philippines===
In the Philippines, the main source of import grey market vehicles, both passenger and commercial, is Japan. Second is Korea, third is the US via trans-shipments through Japan. Only one port, Port Irene, Cagayan, was open to grey market passenger vehicles between 2008 and 2014. Some dispute over the legality of importation of passenger vehicles arose and led to a Port Irene ban. Currently the Executive Order 418 has been upheld, thus banning the importation of used passenger vehicles into the Philippines.

Commercial vehicles, special purpose vehicles are not under EO 418 and thus are currently being imported into Subic and Poro Point, San Fernando. Subic sees roughly 1 cargo ship per week, and has many licensed locators. A second port, Poro Point is, as of February 2014, once per month and is solely facilitated by Forerunner Multi-Resources as the licensed locator, and SASTRAD KK in Japan as the sole shipper.

There is a grey-area trade of used mini trucks from Japan flourishing in Cebu. Mini trucks are chopped in Japan, imported as &quot;parts&quot; and are re-assembled by welding chassis parts together. Cheap to buy, they are a staple of small businesses transporting goods.

===Japan===

In Japan, although the laws against grey import products were strict, and domestic car makers and authorized dealers have to conform the vehicle dimension standards and other various regulations differing from Europe and United States, the laws against grey-imported vehicles are very lax due to absence of import tariffs, and there are some grey imported vehicles that were never officially sold in the Japanese domestic market. These ranging from small city cars like Toyota Aygo and Smart ForTwo, to sports cars like AC Cobra and Chevrolet Camaro, to commercial vehicles and pickup trucks like the Toyota Tundra. Most cars were imported from their country of origin, and a few were converted to RHD, though some were later introduced to authorized dealers due to popular demand.

Some grey market importers have tried to import domestically made export-only cars, such as the Subaru BRAT and Infiniti FX, back into Japan&#x27;s grey market. In Japan, the term used to refer to this scene is called , and this mainly applies to Japanese-branded vehicles. Also, due to NOx laws and some other differing regulations, pickup trucks like the Toyota Hilux are no longer officially distributed in the JDM, so importers continue to import foreign-built trucks into Japan.

The concept of Gyakuyunyu is referenced in the music album &quot;Gyakuyunyū: Kōwankyoku&quot;.

In Japan, foreign cars sold locally have traditionally been LHD, which is regarded as exotic or a status symbol. This even applies to British brands (although cars for the British market have the steering wheel on the right), in part because many have been imported via the US. Many tollbooths in Japan have a special lane for LHD vehicles. However, some US manufacturers have made RHD models for the Japanese market (namely the Ford Taurus and Chevrolet Cavalier), though with limited success; and as continental European brands become more popular, the preference is increasingly for RHD models, many of which are re-exported to countries like New Zealand as grey imports, along with Japanese models.

===Sweden===

In Sweden, the main source of grey market vehicles is via Germany, which has more liberal laws and better tax deals on new imported cars. Many used cars also come from Germany, which has a bigger domestic market and rigorous roadworthiness tests. There are no age restrictions on imported vehicles, as such.

=== Thailand ===
In Thailand, most grey imports are expensive, rare, and/or sports cars. Most are right-hand drive cars from the United Kingdom, Japan, Malaysia, or Hong Kong, though some are brought in from the US (as left-hand drive cars).

Mercedes-Benz Thailand, an authorised distributor, does exist, but many Mercedes-Benz cars are imported and sold by grey importers. As of 2011, Mercedes-Benz Thailand has a new policy of not providing warranty work to grey-market imports.

The new Thai law prohibits the importation of used cars, effective on December 10, 2019.

===Trinidad and Tobago===

In Trinidad and Tobago, nearly all used imports come from Japan, with some vehicles coming from Thailand and Singapore. Before February 2016, cars under 6 years old could be legally imported. Since February 2016, no car can be imported and registered if over 4 years old. An import licence is required and most imports are through dealerships. No new importer dealerships are permitted.

===Senegal===

Grey imports from France are generally being most common in Senegal. There are also grey imports from Spain, especially vehicles formerly being owned by their taxi companies, though some are brought in from Italy or even Belgium.

===Slovakia===

Grey import in Slovakia exists in some ways. As part of the EU, importing vehicles from member states is not restricted at all, although imported vehicle has to be inspected for origin (VIN number manipulation, possible stolen vehicle legalization)
Main destinations for import are Germany, Austria, Italy, and the Czech Republic.

Imports from non-member EU states are restricted by age. Personal vehicles are restricted to 8 years (from date of first registration to date of customs declaration), and vehicles intended to be used for business are restricted to 5 years. Vehicles imported from non-member states which are not approved for European roads have to pass import inspection, and modified to meet restrictions. For vehicles from the U.S. or Canada it is mandatory to change headlights, or adjust them for the EU bulb pattern, change red rear turn signals to orange ones, separate them from brake wiring, and add fog lights. Importing cars with RHD has been allowed from 20 May 2018, but the headlights and fog lights have to be converted to the continental pattern.

===Pakistan===

Grey imports in Pakistan do exist; however, it is limited by passenger cars no older than 3 years old and 4x4 jeeps or off-road passenger vehicles no older than 5 years old at the time of arrival in the Port of Entry. There could be a significant saving on luxury cars in Pakistan, as the official dealer channels may be excessive in price, and also the used car markets may also be excessive in price.

The Federal Board of Revenue for Pakistan gives the importer three scenarios which a passenger vehicle could be imported into the country. These scenarios are as follows:
*Personal Baggage scheme
*Transfer of Residence scheme
*Gift scheme

The Pakistan Customs Duty rates of imports, providing that the vehicles (excluding jeeps) meet the age requirements for Pakistan, are shown below:
*Up to 800 CC (other than US$6,600 Asian Makes);
*From 801 CC to 1000 CC US$5,500
*From 1001 CC to 1300 CC US$11,000
*From 1301 CC to 1500 CC US$15,400
*From 1501 CC to 1600 CC US$18,700
*From 1601 CC to 1800 CC US$23,100

In 2018, after years of appealing with the Pakistan Government, the Classic Car Club of Pakistan was delighted to announce that the Pakistan Government has finally allowed the importation of classic vehicles. The Express Tribune of Pakistan reported on the subject by stating;

&quot;...Earlier in the budget announcement for fiscal year 2018–19 at the end of April, the government had said that it would impose a flat duty of $5,000 on the import of vintage or classic cars and jeeps. A formal notification was issued by the FBR on July 3...&quot;

“...The federal government is pleased to exempt vintage or classic cars and jeeps meant for transport of persons on the import thereof from customs duty, regulatory duty, additional customs duty, federal excise duty, sales tax and withholding tax as are in excess of the cumulative amount of US dollars five thousand per unit,” said the FBR notification.

The duties have been exempted in exercise of the powers of the Customs Act 1969, Federal Excise Act 2005 and Sales Tax Act. However, it clarified that vintage or classic cars and jeeps mean old and used automotive vehicles, falling under PCT Code 87.03 of the First Schedule to the Customs Act 1969 (IV of 1969), manufactured prior to January 1, 1968. APP...&quot;

===Greece===

Grey imports do exist in Greece. However, they are rare, expensive, and are really limited by small and medium vehicles must be new and not more than 15 days old, buses, vans, and heavy vehicles cannot be more than 25 days old, and vehicles have to be left hand drive before arrival in Greece. Vehicles from left hand traffic countries must be at least 3 years old, have to be converted to left hand drive, and must be inspected before arrival.

The majority of grey imported vehicles originate from either Germany, Netherlands and France, and is a beneficial method of purchasing any (maybe unusual) vehicle in a much better condition and better vehicle history record, but in an attempt to reduce carbon footprints of older vehicles, the Ministry of Energy and Environment had announced environmental tax measures that:

* Prohibited the import of vehicles that meet Euro III (or lower) standards
* As for Euro IV vehicles, the importer has to pay a fee of €3,000
* As for Euro V vehicles, the importer has to pay a fee of €1,000
* As for Euro VI vehicles, the importer does not pay any environmental fees upon importing
* The only exception from the restrictions above is when an imported vehicle is over 30 years old and intended for historical use only.
Above all the additional costs, there is also a vehicle registration fee that must be paid within up to 45 days (from the time of the declared arrival of the vehicle into the country until the 15th of the next month) in order to obtain Greek number plates. That&#x27;s highly dependable on:

* The pre-tax retail price of the vehicle (at the time of its first registration)
* The vehicle&#x27;s mileage
* The vehicle&#x27;s age/month of first registration (in months)
* The factory claimed CO2 emissions of the vehicle
* The European emission standards the vehicle is classified for (at the time of its first registration)
* The ehicle&#x27;s type (e.g. hatchback, estate, SUV etc.)
* How the vehicle is powered (Hybrid vehicles are subject to half of the fee, where as fully electric vehicles are exempt from any registration fees)
* The status of the new owner of the vehicle (if they&#x27;re disabled or parents of at least 3 underaged children, they are exempt from any registration fees, but future resale is restricted to people with multi-member families or disabilities respectively)
The declaration of arrival is submitted either electronically or upon arrival in the country (either through the respective border control or the destination&#x27;s customs office).

===Cambodia===

Used cars in Cambodia are mainly imported from Taiwan, United States, Russia, Japan, South Korea and the GCC countries (mostly UAE). Used vehicles from Germany and also the Netherlands are rarely imported there due to the lack of port cities and also due to troubled and highly problematic cost of delivery.

===Singapore===
As of 2019, the Land Transport Authority mandates that vehicles imported into Singaporean soil must be brand new or manufactured at most three years ago.

===Armenia===

Used cars in Armenia are mainly imported from Japan, Singapore and the United States. There are also used cars from European countries, but they are mostly over 15 years old.

===Kyrgyzstan===

In Kyrgyzstan, Grey imports of used cars from Japan and the United States are generally most common there. Used cars from European countries are predominantly more than 15 years old, and mostly limited to German car brands.

===Suriname===

Grey imports from Japan and Singapore are generally being most common there in Suriname. LHD vehicles are also allowed on the road, but importation of LHD vehicles (especially from the US) is prohibited. Used vehicles from the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand are rarely imported there.

Most of the privately owned buses are imported from Japan, since they are already RHD. Most state-owned buses, however, are from the US and the doors have to be repositioned.

===Myanmar===

In spite of the change to driving on the right, most passenger cars in the country today are RHD, being second-hand vehicles imported from Japan, Thailand, and Singapore. Now, only left hand drive can be imported to Myanmar and the reason behind is that right hand drive cars are unsuitable for Myanmar&#x27;s road traffic system.

===Caribbean===

In many Caribbean islands where traffic drives on the left, such as the British Virgin Islands, U.S. Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, most passenger cars are LHD, being imported from the United States or even Korea. Only government cars, buses and vehicles imported from Japan are RHD. The US Virgin Islands (originally a Danish protectorate which drove on the left, as did Denmark until the early 20th century) are particularly notorious for a high accident rate caused by American tourists from the mainland who are unfamiliar with driving on the left in their rental cars – the confusion from which is obviously compounded by using a LHD vehicle.

<text>James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale, (26 January 1759 – 10 September 1839) was Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland and a Scottish representative peer in the House of Lords.

==Early years==

Born at Haltoun House near Ratho, the eldest son and heir of James Maitland, 7th Earl of Lauderdale, whom he succeeded in 1789, he became a controversial Scottish politician and writer. His tutor had been the learned Dr. Andrew Dalzell and James Maitland then attended the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, completing his education in Paris where, it is said, he became radicalised.

==Parliamentary career==

Upon his return home in 1780, he was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates and successfully stood for election to parliament the same year. From 1780 until 1784 he was a member of parliament representing Newport and from 1784 to 1789, Malmesbury. In the House of Commons he supported the prominent Whig Charles Fox and took an active part in debate and was one of the managers of the Impeachment of Warren Hastings.

From 1789, in the House of Lords, where he was a Scottish representative peer, he was prominent as an opponent of the policy of William Pitt the Younger and the English government with regard to France. He was a frequent speaker and also distinguished himself by his active opposition to the &quot;Habeas Corpus&quot; Suspension Act, the Sedition Bill, and other measures. Upon the outbreak of the French Revolution, of which he was thought to be in sympathy, he ostentatiously appeared in the house in the rough costume of Jacobinism.

In July 1792, he fought a bloodless duel with Benedict Arnold after impugning Arnold&#x27;s honour in the House of Lords.

==French Revolution==
In 1792, in the company of John Moore, Lord Lauderdale travelled again to France. The attack on the Tuileries and the imprisonment of King Louis XVI took place three days after the earl&#x27;s arrival in the French capital. After the massacres of 2 September, the British ambassador having left Paris, the earl left Paris on the 4th for Calais. However, he returned to Paris the following month and did not leave for London until 5 December. Upon his return from France, he published a &quot;Journal during the residence in France from the beginning of August to the middle of December 1792&quot;.

According to the antiquarian Andrew Thomson, &quot;James Maitland 8th Earl of Lauderdale was known as &#x27;Citizen Maitland&#x27;. An extremist, he was in Paris during the French Revolution and was a personal friend of Jean-Paul Marat. He rarely visited Scotland&quot;. The earl had helped to found the British Society of the Friends of the People in 1792.

==New peerage==
Upon the formation of the Grenville administration in February 1806, Lauderdale was made a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Lauderdale of Thirlestane and sworn a member of the Privy Council. For a short time from July 1806 he was keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland.

==Napoleonic treaty==
On 2 August 1806 the earl, fully fluent in French, departed for France, invested with full powers to conclude peace, the negotiations for which had been for several weeks carried on by the Earl of Yarmouth. Arriving on the 5th he and Yarmouth set about the arduous task of treating with Napoleon and Tallyrand. Yarmouth was recalled on the 14th and Lauderdale was left alone.

In his &#x27;Memoirs &#x27; Eugène François Vidocq wrote that circa Battle of Copenhagen (1807) Boulogne was also bombed. According to Vidocq at this moment Lauderdale was right in Boulogne, and was almost lynched by Frenchmen.

He was an Englishman, and the exasperated people were desirous of revenging themselves on him: they surrounded him, mobbed him, and pressed upon him; and in defiance of the protection of two officers who were attending him, they showered stones and mud upon him from all sides. Pale, trembling, and faltering, the peer thought he was about to fall a sacrifice, when sword in hand, I cleared my way through the rabble, crying &#x27;Destruction to whoever strikes him!&#x27; I harangued the multitude, dispersed them, and led the way to the harbour, where, without being subjected to further insult, he embarked on board a flag of truce boat. He soon reached the English squadron, which the next evening renewed the bombardment. 
Following the renewal of hostilities he left Paris for London on 9 October. A full account of the progress and termination of the negotiations appeared in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 21 October 1806.

After acting as the leader of the Whigs in Scotland, Lauderdale became a Tory and voted against the Reform Bill of 1832. Lord Lauderdale was made a Privy Counsellor in 1806 and a Knight of the Thistle in 1821.

==Banner dispute==
In 1672 on the death of the Earl of Dundee, the Duke of Lauderdale was appointed 
Hereditary Bearer for the Sovereign of the Standard of Scotland, and this right was retained by his heirs until 1910.

In 1790, James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale matriculated arms in the character of Hereditary Bearer for the Sovereign of the Standard of Scotland and Hereditary Bearer for the Sovereign of the National Flag of Scotland.

In 1952 after a meeting with the Earls of Lauderdale and Dundee the Lord Lyon advised the Queen to confirm the Earl of Lauderdale&#x27;s right to bear the saltire as the Bearer of the National Flag of Scotland, and to confirm that the Earl of Dundee as the Bearer of the Royal Banner bears the Royal Standard of the lion rampant.

==Writings==
Maitland wrote an &quot;Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Public Wealth&quot; (1804 and 1819), in which he introduced the concept that has come to be known as the &quot;Lauderdale Paradox&quot;: there is an inverse correlation between public wealth and private wealth; an increase in the one can only come at the cost of a decrease in the other. This work, which was translated into French and Italian, produced a controversy between the author and Lord Brougham; &quot;The Depreciation of the Paper-currency of Great Britain Proved&quot; (1812); and other writings of a similar nature.
The &quot;Inquiry&quot; was the first work to draw attention to the economic consequences of a budget surplus or deficit and its influence on the expansion or contraction of the economy, and was thus the basis of the later Keynesian economic theories which are now widely applied.

==Death==
He died at Thirlestane Castle, near Lauder, Berwickshire, at 80.

He is buried in the Maitland vault, also called the Lauderdale Aisle, at St Mary&#x27;s Collegiate Church, Haddington.

==Family==

On 15 August 1782, he married Eleanor Todd (1762–1856), the only daughter and heiress of Anthony Todd, Secretary of the General Post Office. They had ten children:
* Lady Eleanor, married James Balfour (parents of James Maitland Balfour MP, and grandparents of Prime Minister Arthur Balfour)
* Lady Mary, married Edward Stanley of Cross Hall, near Ormskirk. Mother of Edward Stanley MP.
* Lady Julia, married in 1823 Sir John Warrender, 5th Baronet (1786–1867)
* James Maitland, 9th Earl of Lauderdale (1784–1860)
* Admiral Anthony Maitland, 10th Earl of Lauderdale (1785–1863)
* Five other sons.
None of his seven sons were married.

<doc id="655016" wikidata="Q3041080" url="?curid=655016" title="Valley of the Ten Peaks">
<text>Valley of the Ten Peaks () is a valley in Banff National Park in Alberta, Canada, which is crowned by ten notable peaks and also includes Moraine Lake. The valley can be reached by following the Moraine Lake road near Lake Louise. The ten peaks were originally named by Samuel Allen, an early explorer of the region, who simply referred to them by using the numerals from one to ten in the Stoney First Nations Language. He may have learned the terms from his Native American guides, who helped him with the horses. The Nakoda–also known as the Stoney Indians–is a tribe whose culture and dialect are closely related to that of the Assiniboine First Nation, from whom they are believed to have separated in the mid-1700s, and who roamed large parts of the prairies and mountains of western Alberta well into British Columbia. The secluded Valley of the Ten Peaks was part of their original homeland. Gradually, though, all but three of the mountains were renamed in honour of noteworthy individuals, including Allen himself.

Mount Hungabee was not included in the original peak list by Allen, even though it is higher than Wenkchemna Peak, the latter of which is really an extension of Hungabee.

==Peaks==

The ten peaks, in order of how they are numbered from east to west, are:


There are other peaks visible from within the valley as well, including Mount Temple, Mount Babel and Eiffel Peak. Fay Glacier is developed between Mount Babel, Mount Fay, Mount Little and Mount Bowlen.

The Valley of the Ten Peaks was featured on the reverse side of the 1969 and 1979 issues of the Canadian twenty dollar bill; see .

The Neil Colgan Hut, a mountaineering destination and the highest permanent structure in Canada, can be reached in 8 to 12 hours of climbing the Perren Route from Moraine Lake.

<doc id="655019" wikidata="Q558505" url="?curid=655019" title="Richard Anuszkiewicz">
<text>Richard Joseph Anuszkiewicz (; May 23, 1930 – May 19, 2020) was an American painter, printmaker, and sculptor. The son of Polish immigrants, he developed a geometric style.

==Life and work==
Anuszkiewicz was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, the son of Victoria (Jankowski) and Adam Anuszkiewicz, who worked in a paper mill. His parents were Polish immigrants. He first studied art under Joseph Plavcan while still in high school, later describing him as his most significant influence. Anuszkiewicz trained at the Cleveland Institute of Art in Cleveland, Ohio (1948–1953), and then with Josef Albers at the Yale University School of Art in New Haven, Connecticut (1953–1955), where he earned his Masters of Fine Arts. While at Yale, Anuszkiewicz was roommates with a fellow abstract painter of Polish descent and a student of Albers, Julian Stanczak.

He was one of the leading figures in the Op Art movement during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s. Victor Vasarely in France and Bridget Riley in England were his primary international counterparts. In 1964, &quot;Life&quot; magazine called him &quot;one of the new wizards of Op&quot;. While reflecting on a New York City gallery show of Anuszkiewicz&#x27;s from 2000, &quot;New York Times&quot; art critic Holland Cotter described Anuszkiewicz&#x27;s paintings: &quot;The drama — and that feels like the right word — is in the subtle chemistry of complementary colors, which makes the geometry glow as if light were leaking out from behind it.&quot; Anuszkiewicz exhibited at the Venice Biennale, Florence Biennale and Documenta, and his works are in permanent collections internationally. He was elected into the National Academy of Design in 1992 as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1994.

== Style ==

Anuszkiewicz was concerned with the optical changes that occur when different high-intensity colors are applied to the same geometric configurations. Most of his work comprises visual investigations of formal structural and color effects, many of them nested square forms similar to the work of his mentor Josef Albers. In his series, &quot;Homage to the Square&quot;, Albers experimented with juxtapositions of color, and Anuszkiewicz developed these concepts further. Anuszkiewicz continued to produce works in the Op Art style over the subsequent decades of his career.

In 1963, Anuszkiewicz summarized his approach to painting as: &quot;My work is of an experimental nature and has centered on an investigation into the effects of complementary colors of full intensity when juxtaposed and the optical changes that occur as a result, and a study of the dynamic effect of the whole under changing conditions of light, and the effect of light on color.&quot;

<text>Henri Paul Julien Dutilleux (; 22 January 1916 – 22 May 2013) was a French composer of late 20th-century classical music. Among the leading French composers of his time, his work was rooted in the Impressionistic style of Debussy and Ravel, but in an idiosyncratic, individual style. Among his best known works are his early Flute Sonatine and Piano Sonata; concertos for cello, &quot;Tout un monde lointain...&quot; (&quot;A whole distant world&quot;) and violin, &quot;L&#x27;arbre des songes&quot; (&quot;The tree of dreams&quot;); a string quartet known as &quot;Ainsi la nuit&quot; (&quot;Thus the night&quot;); and two symphonies: No. 1 (1951) and No. 2 &quot;Le Double&quot; (1959). 

Works were commissioned from him by such major artists as Charles Munch, George Szell, Mstislav Rostropovich, the Juilliard String Quartet, Isaac Stern, Paul Sacher, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Simon Rattle, Renée Fleming, and Seiji Ozawa. In addition to composing, he worked as the Head of Music Production for Radio France for 18 years. He also taught at the École Normale de Musique de Paris and at the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique, and was twice composer in residence at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts.

Among Dutilleux&#x27;s many awards and honours were the Grand Prix de Rome (1938) and the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize (2005). When describing him, the music critic Paul Griffiths wrote that &quot;Mr. Dutilleux’s position in French music was proudly solitary. Between Olivier Messiaen and Pierre Boulez in age, he was little affected by either, though he took an interest in their work. But his voice, marked by sensuously handled harmony and color, was his own.&quot;

==Life==
Henri Dutilleux was born on 22 January 1916 in Angers, Maine-et-Loire. He was the great-grandson of the painter Constant Dutilleux and grandson of the composer Julien Koszul. He was also a cousin of the mathematician Jean-Louis Koszul. He studied harmony, counterpoint, and piano with Victor Gallois at the before leaving for the Conservatoire de Paris. There, between 1933 and 1938, he attended the classes of Jean and Noël Gallon (harmony and counterpoint, in which he won joint first prize with the cellist Paul Tortelier), Henri Büsser (composition) and Maurice Emmanuel (history of music).

Dutilleux won the Prix de Rome in 1938 for his cantata &quot;L&#x27;anneau du roi&quot; but did not complete his entire residency in Rome due to the outbreak of World War II. He worked for a year as a medical orderly in the army and returned to Paris in 1940, where he worked as a pianist, arranger and music teacher. In 1942, he conducted the choir of the Paris Opera.

Dutilleux worked as Head of Music Production for Radio France from 1945 to 1963. He served as professor of composition at the École Normale de Musique de Paris from 1961 to 1970. He was appointed to the staff of the Conservatoire National Supérieur de Musique in 1970 and was composer-in-residence at Tanglewood in 1995 and 1998. His students included Gérard Grisey, Francis Bayer, Alain Gagnon, Jacques Hétu, and Kenneth Hesketh. Invited by Walter Fink, in 2006 he was the 16th composer featured in the Rheingau Musik Festival&#x27;s annual &quot;Komponistenporträt&quot;.
For many years, Dutilleux had a studio on Île Saint-Louis. He died on 22 May 2013 in Paris, aged 97, and was buried in Montparnasse Cemetery, in the same grave as Geneviève, his wife who died in 2009. His tombstone is made of grey granite and bears the epitaph &quot;Compositeur&quot;.

== Influences and style ==
Dutilleux&#x27;s music extends the legacies of French composers such as Debussy and Ravel but is also clearly influenced by Béla Bartók and Igor Stravinsky. Among his favourite pieces, he mentioned Beethoven&#x27;s late string quartets and Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;.

His attitude toward serialism was ambiguous. While he always paid attention to developments in contemporary music and incorporated some serialist techniques into his work, he also criticized the more radical and intolerant aspects of the movement: &quot;What I reject is the dogma and the authoritarianism which manifested themselves in that period.&quot; Dutilleux refused to be associated with any school.

Dutilleux&#x27;s music contains distant echoes of jazz, as can be heard in the plucked double bass strings at the beginning of his First Symphony and his frequent use of syncopated rhythms. He often calls for Ray Robinson-style cup mutes in the brass section, which seems to indicate the influence of big band music. Dutilleux was greatly enamoured of vocalists, especially the jazz singer Sarah Vaughan and the great French chanson singers.

Some of Dutilleux&#x27;s trademarks include very refined orchestral textures; complex rhythms; a preference for atonality and modality over tonality; the use of pedal points that serve as atonal pitch centers; and &quot;reverse variation&quot;, whereby a theme is revealed gradually, appearing in its complete form only after a few partial, tentative expositions. His music also displays a strong sense of structure and symmetry. This is particularly obvious from an &quot;external&quot; point of view, in the overall organisation of the different movements or the spatial distribution of the various instruments, but is also apparent in the music itself (themes, harmonies and rhythms mirroring, complementing or opposing each other). According to Stuart Jefferies, &quot;A passage may be conceived as a symmetrical shape of notes on paper and only later given musical substance. He loves symmetrical musical figures such as palindromes or fan-shaped phrases&quot;.

Dutilleux&#x27;s music was influenced by art and literature, such as the works of Vincent van Gogh, Charles Baudelaire and Marcel Proust. It also shows a concern for the concepts of time and memory, both in its use of quotations (notably from Bartók, Benjamin Britten, and Jehan Alain), and in short interludes that recall material used in earlier movements and/or introduce ideas that will be fully developed later.

A perfectionist with a strong sense of artistic integrity, he allowed only a small number of his works to be published; what he did publish he often repeatedly revised. In his own words:

==Compositional history==

Dutilleux numbered as Op. 1 his Piano Sonata (1946–1948), written for the pianist Geneviève Joy, whom he married in 1946. He renounced most of the works he composed before it because he did not believe them to be representative of his mature standards, considering many of them to be too derivative to have merit.

After the Piano Sonata, Dutilleux started working on his First Symphony (1951). It consists of four monothematic movements and has a perfectly symmetrical structure: music slowly emerges from silence (first movement—a passacaglia) and builds towards a fast climax (second—a scherzo and moto perpetuo), keeps its momentum (third—&quot;a continuous melodic line that never goes back on itself&quot;), and finally slowly fades out (fourth—a theme and variations).

In 1953, Dutilleux wrote the music for the ballet &quot;Le loup&quot; (&quot;The Wolf&quot;).

In his Second Symphony, titled &quot;Le double&quot; (1959), the orchestra is divided into two groups: a small one at the front with instruments taken from the various sections (brass, woodwind, strings and percussion) and a bigger one at the back consisting of the rest of the orchestra. Although this brings to mind the Baroque concerto grosso, the approach is different: in this piece, the smaller ensemble acts as a mirror or ghost of the bigger one, sometimes playing similar or complementary lines, sometimes contrasting ones.

His next work, &quot;Métaboles&quot; for orchestra (1965) explores the idea of metamorphosis, how a series of subtle and gradual changes can radically transform a structure. A different section of the orchestra dominates each of the first four movements before the fifth brings them all together. As a result, it can be considered as a concerto for orchestra. It quickly achieved celebrity and, following its première by George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, was performed in several North American cities, then in France. &quot;Métaboles&quot; is one of his most often performed works.

In the 1960s, Dutilleux met Mstislav Rostropovich, who commissioned a cello concerto from him. Rostropovich premièred the work, &quot;Tout un monde lointain…&quot; (&quot;A whole distant world...&quot;), in 1970. It is considered one of Dutilleux&#x27;s major achievements.

After the cello concerto, Dutilleux turned to chamber music for the first time in more than 20 years and wrote the string quartet &quot;Ainsi la nuit&quot; (1976). It consists of seven movements, some of which are linked by short &quot;parentheses&quot;. The parentheses&#x27; function is to recall material that has already been heard and to introduce fragments that will be fully developed later. It is based on a hexachord (C–G–F–G–C–D) that highlights the intervals of fifth and major second. Each movement emphasizes various special effects (pizzicato, glissandi, harmonics, extreme registers, contrasting dynamics...), resulting in a difficult, elaborate work.

Dutilleux also published various works for piano (&quot;3 Préludes&quot;, &quot;Figures de résonances&quot;) and &quot;3 strophes sur le nom de Sacher&quot; (1976–1982) for solo cello. The latter was originally composed on the occasion of Paul Sacher&#x27;s 70th birthday in 1976, on a request by Rostropovich to write compositions for cello solo using his name spelt out in musical notes as the theme eS-A-C-H-E-Re (&quot;Es&quot; is E in German, &quot;H&quot; is B in German, and &quot;Re&quot; is D in French; see Sacher hexachord). He then returned to orchestral works in 1978 with &quot;Timbres, espace, mouvement ou la nuit etoilée&quot;, inspired by Van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;The Starry Night&quot;. In this composition, Dutilleux attempted to translate into musical terms the opposition between emptiness and movement the painting conveys. It employs a string section of only lower-register instruments: cellos and basses, no violins or violas.

In 1985, Isaac Stern premiered &quot;L&#x27;arbre des songes&quot; (&quot;The Tree of Dreams&quot;), a violin concerto he had commissioned from Dutilleux. According to the composer, it is based on a process of continual growth and renewal: &quot;All in all the piece grows somewhat like a tree, for the constant multiplication and renewal of its branches is the lyrical essence of the tree. This symbolic image, as well as the notion of a seasonal cycle, inspired my choice of &#x27;L&#x27;arbre des songes&#x27; as the title of the piece.&quot;

Dutilleux&#x27;s later works include &quot;Mystère de l&#x27;instant&quot; (for cymbalum, string orchestra and percussion, 1989), &quot;Les Citations&quot; (for oboe, harpsichord, double bass and percussion, 1991), &quot;The Shadows of Time&quot; (for orchestra and children voices, 1997), &quot;Slava&#x27;s Fanfare&quot; (for Rostropovich&#x27;s 70th birthday, 1997) and&quot; Sur le même accord&quot; (for violin and orchestra, 2002, dedicated to Anne-Sophie Mutter). In 2003, he completed &quot;Correspondances&quot;, a song cycle for soprano and orchestra inspired by poems and letters by Van Gogh, Prithwindra Mukherjee, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. This work received a very enthusiastic reception and has been programmed several times since its première.

Dutilleux&#x27;s last major work was the song cycle &quot;Le temps l&#x27;horloge&quot;, written for American soprano Renée Fleming. It consists of four pieces and an instrumental interlude on two poems by Jean Tardieu, one by Robert Desnos and one by Charles Baudelaire. The first three songs were premièred at the Saito Kinen Festival Matsumoto, Japan in September 2007. The American première of this partial version took place in November 2007 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The complete work was unveiled on 7 May 2009 at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées in Paris.

In 2010, Dutilleux added a third movement to his chamber work &quot;Les citations&quot;. The expanded version was premiered at the Festival d’Auvers-sur-Oise.

In 2011, with Dutilleux&#x27;s approval, Pascal Gallois transcribed three of his early vocal works for bassoon and piano: &quot;Regards sur l&#x27;Infini&quot; (from the early cycle for voice and piano &quot;Quatre mélodies&quot;) and &quot;Deux sonnets de Jean Cassou&quot; (originally for baritone and piano). He played them in a concert at the Hôtel de Lauzun in Dutilleux&#x27;s presence.

Dutilleux allowed only a small fraction of his work to be published. He often expressed a wish to write more chamber music, notably a second string quartet, a piece for clarinet and ensemble, one for solo double bass, and more piano préludes. He long considered composing an opera but abandoned that project because he could not find a libretto that appealed to him.

Those who commissioned works from Dutilleux include Szell (&quot;Métaboles&quot;), Rostropovich (&quot;Tout un monde lointain…&quot; and &quot;Timbres, espace, mouvement&quot;), Stern (&quot;L&#x27;arbre des songes&quot;), Mutter (&quot;Sur le même accord&quot;), Charles Munch (Symphony No. 2 &quot;Le double&quot;), and Seiji Ozawa (&quot;The Shadows of Time&quot; and &quot;Le temps l&#x27;horloge&quot;).

==Legacy==
After Dutilleux&#x27;s death, the composer and conductor Laurent Petitgirard paid tribute to him as &quot;one of the very rare contemporary composers&quot; whose music became part of the repertoire in his lifetime, predicting that &quot;[h]is work will remain intensely present after his death&quot;.

Several major musicians and conductors championed Dutilleux&#x27;s works, notably Stern, Sacher, Mutter, Fleming, Ozawa, Munch, Szell, Rostropovich, Simon Rattle, and the Juilliard String Quartet.

The conductor and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said of Dutilleux, &quot;His production is rather small but every note has been weighed with golden scales... It&#x27;s just perfect – very haunting, very beautiful. There’s some kind of sadness in his music which I find very touching and arresting.&quot;

The critic Tom Service wrote for the BBC, &quot;Dutilleux&#x27;s exquisite catalogue of pieces is becoming, rightly, ever more popular with performers and listeners all over the world&quot;.

An obituary in &quot;Gramophone&quot; commented, &quot;Dutilleux represented a generation of musicians with roots almost back into the 19th century; certainly his music can be seen in a direct line from that of his great predecessors Debussy and Ravel.&quot; In an obituary in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Roger Nichols described him as &quot;the outstanding French composer between Messiaen and Boulez&quot;, adding that he &quot;achieved a wholly individual synthesis of ear-catching colours and harmonies with formal rigour.&quot;

&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said, &quot;Because Dutilleux was a perfectionist and self-critical to a fault, his output was small. He wrote barely a dozen major works in his career, destroyed much of his early music and often revised what he had written. His early work was clearly derivative of Ravel, Debussy and Roussel; but his later music, though influenced by Bartok and Stravinsky, was entirely original and often seemed—in its scale—more German than French.&quot; &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s critic Philip Hensher called Dutilleux &quot;the Laura Ashley of music; tasteful, unfaultable, but hardly ever daring ... Personally, I can’t stick him.&quot;

Rob Cowan, the BBC Radio 3 presenter and critic, recalled in June 2013 an interview with Dutilleux in which he told Cowan that his personal favourite among his own works was &quot;Tout un monde lointain&quot;...

<doc id="655028" wikidata="Q127406" url="?curid=655028" title="Samuel Francis Du Pont">
<text>Samuel Francis Du Pont (September 27, 1803 – June 23, 1865) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy, and a member of the prominent Du Pont family. In the Mexican–American War, Du Pont captured San Diego, and was made commander of the California naval blockade. Through the 1850s, he promoted engineering studies at the United States Naval Academy, to enable more mobile and aggressive operations. In the American Civil War, he played a major role in making the Union blockade effective, but was controversially blamed for the failed attack on Charleston, South Carolina in April 1863.

==Early life and naval career==

Du Pont was born at Goodstay, his family home at Bergen Point (now Bayonne), New Jersey, the fourth child and second son of Victor Marie du Pont and Gabrielle Joséphine de la Fite de Pelleport. His uncle was Eleuthère Irénée du Pont, the founder of E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company, which began as a gunpowder factory and today is a multinational chemical corporation. (Samuel was the only member of his generation to use a capital &quot;D&quot;.) Du Pont spent his childhood at his father&#x27;s home, Louviers, across the Brandywine Creek from his uncle&#x27;s estate and gunpowder factory, Eleutherian Mills, just north of Wilmington, Delaware. He was enrolled at Mount Airy Academy in Germantown, Pennsylvania, at age 9. However, his father was unable to fund his education because of his failing wool mill, and he was encouraged to instead enlist in the U.S. Navy. His family&#x27;s close connections with President Thomas Jefferson helped secure him an appointment as a midshipman by President James Madison at the age of 12, and he first set sail aboard the 74-gun ship of the line out of Delaware in December 1815.

As there was no naval academy at the time, Du Pont learned mathematics and navigation at sea and became an accomplished navigator by the time he took his next assignment aboard the frigate in 1821. He then served aboard the frigate in the West Indies and off the coast of Brazil. Though still not yet a commissioned officer, he was promoted to sailing master during his service aboard the 74-gun in 1825, which sailed on a mission to display American influence and power in the Mediterranean. Soon after his promotion to Lieutenant in 1826, he was ordered aboard the 12-gun schooner , returned home for two years after his father&#x27;s death in 1827, and then served aboard the 16-gun sloop in 1829. Despite the short period in which he had been an officer by this time, Du Pont had begun to openly criticize many of his senior officers, who he believed were incompetent and had only received their commands through political influence.

After returning from the &quot;Ontario&quot; in June 1833, Du Pont married Sophie Madeleine du Pont (1810–88), his first cousin as the daughter of his uncle, Eleuthère Irénée du Pont. As he never kept an officer&#x27;s journal, his voluminous correspondence with Sophie serves as the main documentation of his operations and observations throughout the rest of his naval career. From 1835 until 1838, he was the executive officer of the frigate and the sloop , commanding both the latter and the schooner in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1838 he joined the ship in the Mediterranean until 1841. The following year he was promoted to commander and set sail for China aboard the brig , but was forced to return home and give up his command because of severe illness. He returned to service in 1845 as commander of the , the flagship of Commodore Robert Stockton, reaching California by way of a cruise of the Hawaiian Islands by the time the Mexican–American War had begun.

==Mexican–American War==

Du Pont was given command of the sloop in 1846 and quickly showed his skill as a naval combat commander, taking or destroying thirty enemy ships and clearing the Gulf of California in the process. Du Pont transported Major John Fremont&#x27;s troops to San Diego, where they captured the city. Du Pont then continued operations along the Baja coast, including the capture of La Paz, and burnt two enemy gunboats in the harbor of Guaymas under heavy fire. He led the main line of ships that took Mazatlán on November 11, 1847, and on February 15, 1848, launched an amphibious assault on San José del Cabo that managed to strike three miles (5 km) inland and relieve a besieged squadron, despite heavy resistance. He was given command of the California naval blockade in the last months of the war and, after taking part in further land maneuvers, was ordered home.

==Between wars==
Du Pont served most of the next decade on shore assignment, and his efforts during this time are credited with helping to modernize the U.S. Navy. He studied the possibilities of steam power, and emphasized engineering and mathematics in the curriculum that he established for the new United States Naval Academy. He was appointed superintendent of the Academy, but resigned after four months because he believed it was a post more appropriate for someone closer to retirement age. He was an advocate for a more mobile and offensive Navy, rather than the harbor defense function that much of it was then relegated to, and worked on revising naval rules and regulations. After being appointed to the board of the United States Lighthouse Service, his recommendations for upgrading the antiquated system were largely adopted by Congress in a lighthouse bill.

In 1853, Du Pont was made general superintendent over what is typically considered the first World&#x27;s Fair in the United States—the Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations, held in New York City. Despite international praise, low attendance caused the venture to go into heavy debt, and Du Pont resigned.

Du Pont became an enthusiastic supporter of naval reform, writing in support of the 1855 congressional act to &quot;Promote the Efficiency of the Navy.&quot; He was appointed to the Naval Efficiency Board and oversaw the removal of 201 naval officers. When those under fire called upon friends in Congress, Du Pont himself became the subject of heavy criticism, and subsequent review of the dismissals resulted in the reinstatement of nearly half of those removed.
Du Pont was promoted to captain in 1855. In 1857 he was given command of the steam frigate and ordered to transport William Reed, the U.S. Minister to China, to his post in Beijing. Du Pont&#x27;s &quot;Minnesota&quot; was one of seventeen warships parading Western force in China, and after China failed to satisfy demands for greater access to its ports, he witnessed the capture of Chinese forts on the Peiho River by the French and English on April 28, 1858. He then sailed to Japan, India, and Arabia, finally returning to Boston in May 1859. He played a major role in the receiving of the Japanese ambassador that year, accompanying him on his three-month visit to Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia; the trip was a breakthrough for opening Japan to American trade and investment. Du Pont was then made commandant of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in 1860. He expected to retire in this post, but the outbreak of the Civil War returned him to active duty.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1862.

==Civil War==
When communication was cut off with Washington at the start of the Civil War, Du Pont took the initiative of sending a fleet to the Chesapeake Bay to protect the landing of Union troops at Annapolis, Maryland. In June 1861 he was made president of a board in Washington formed to develop a plan of naval operations against the Confederacy. He was appointed flag officer serving aboard the steam frigate as commander of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, leading from Norfolk, Virginia, the largest fleet ever commanded by an American officer at that time. On November 7, Du Pont led a successful attack on the fortifications at Port Royal harbor in South Carolina. This victory enabled Union naval forces to secure the southern waters of Georgia and the entire eastern coast of Florida, and an effective blockade was established. On January 3, 1862, he was promoted to the newly created rank of Flag Officer (equivalent to the rank of Commodore, which would be created in July 1862). Du Pont received commendations from U.S. Congress for his brilliant tactical success, and was appointed rear admiral on July 16, 1862.
Towards the end of 1862, Du Pont became the first U.S. naval officer to be assigned command over armored &quot;ironclad&quot; ships. Though he commanded them ably in engagements with other ships, they performed poorly in an attack on Fort McAllister, due to their small number of guns and slow rate of fire. Du Pont was then given direct orders from the Navy Department to launch an attack on Charleston, South Carolina which was the site of the first shots fired in the Civil War with the fall of Fort Sumter and the main area in which the Union blockade had been unsuccessful. Though Du Pont believed that Charleston could not be taken without significant land troop support, he nevertheless attacked with nine ironclads on April 7, 1863. Unable to navigate properly in the obstructed channels leading to the harbor, his ships were caught in a blistering crossfire, and he withdrew them before nightfall. Five of his nine ironclads were disabled in the failed attack, and one more subsequently sank.

The Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, blamed Du Pont for the highly publicized failure at Charleston. Du Pont himself anguished over it and, despite an engagement in which vessels under his command defeated and captured a Confederate ironclad, was relieved of command on July 5, 1863, at his own request and was replaced in this Office by Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren. Though he enlisted the help of Maryland U.S. Representative Henry Winter Davis to get his official report of the incident published by the Navy, an ultimately inconclusive congressional investigation into the failure essentially turned into a trial of whether Du Pont had misused his ships and misled his superiors. Du Pont&#x27;s attempt to garner the support of President Abraham Lincoln was ignored, and he returned home to Delaware. He returned to Washington to serve briefly on a board reviewing naval promotions.

However, subsequent events arguably vindicated Du Pont&#x27;s judgment and capabilities. A subsequent U.S. naval attack on the city failed, despite being launched with a significantly larger fleet of armored ships. Charleston was finally taken only by the invasion of General Sherman&#x27;s army in 1865.

==Death and legacy==
Du Pont died on June 23, 1865, while on a trip to Philadelphia and is buried in the du Pont family cemetery. The cemetery is located near the Hagley Museum in Greenville, Delaware.

In 1882, 17 years after Du Pont&#x27;s death, the U.S. Congress finally moved to recognize his service and commissioned a sculpture of him to be placed in Pacific Circle in Washington. A bronze sculpture of Du Pont by Launt Thompson was dedicated on December 20, 1884, and the traffic circle was renamed Dupont Circle. In attendance were U.S. President Chester A. Arthur and Delaware senator Thomas F. Bayard. Though the circle still bears his name, the statue was moved to Rockford Park (part of Wilmington State Parks) in Wilmington, Delaware, by the du Pont family in 1920, and replaced by a fountain designed by Daniel Chester French, dedicated in 1921.

Louviers was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

==Namesakes==
Fort du Pont near Delaware City, Delaware, and three U.S. Navy ships; the torpedo boat , and the destroyers and were all named in honor of Samuel Du Pont. Public School 31 in the Greenpoint neighborhood of New York City, is named after him, as is Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C. Grant Avenue in San Francisco, California, at one time was named Dupont Street following the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848. While it was renamed after President Ulysses S. Grant in 1906, Grant Avenue is still written and said in Chinese as &quot;Dupont Gai&quot; (都板街, Gai 街 means street).

<text>Alden is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located in Antrim County in the U.S. state of Michigan. Located within Helena Township, the community is located upon the shores of Torch Lake. The population of the CDP was 123 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Alden was first settled as early a 1868 by storekeeper F. J. Lewis in Helena Township, and he chose the name Noble as the name for the new settlement. The growing community was located along the mouth of Spencer Creek along Torch Lake, which was named after John Spencer. The community itself also became known as Spencer Creek and was given a post office under that name on June 15, 1869. In 1891, the Pere Marquette Railway expanded into the area, and Spencer Creek was renamed Alden after railroad official William Alden Smith, who would later become a state politician. The post office was renamed Alden on July 18, 1892.

The community of Alden was listed as a newly organized census-designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics for the first time.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Alden CDP had a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 census, Alden has a population of 123 with 59 households and a median income of 49,063.

<doc id="655036" wikidata="Q5634422" url="?curid=655036" title="HMS St. James (D65)">
<text>HMS &quot;St. James&quot; was a of the Royal Navy. She was named in honour of the Battle of St. James Day which took place in 1666.

&quot;St. James&quot; was built by Fairfields at Govan. She was launched on 7 June 1945 and commissioned on 12 July 1946.

==Operational service==
In 1946, &quot;St. James&quot; joined the 5th Destroyer Flotilla, part of the Home Fleet. On 25 August 1946, while undergoing calibration trials off the Isle of Portland, she accidentally hit and sank the tug &quot;Buccaneer&quot; with a 4.5-inch shell, while aiming at the target &quot;Buccaneer&quot; was towing. &quot;St. James&quot;″s captain, Commander J. Lee Barber, went alongside and took off &quot;Buccaneer&quot;″s crew without loss, but &quot;St. James&quot; suffered a damaged propeller when the tug capsized. An inquiry was held aboard the cruiser on 28 August, at which it was decided that no further action would be taken.

In 1950, &quot;St. James&quot; deployed on a Home Fleet Spring Cruise, which saw her, as well as many other vessels, including the aircraft carrier and two other carriers, as well as the battleship , visit the Mediterranean, which included stops in Italy. The group performed the usual naval exercises in the region, as well as undertaking &#x27;fly-the-flag&#x27; visits to a number of ports.

In 1953, &quot;St. James&quot; was placed in reserve along with a number of her sister ships. However she did take part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.

In 1957, &quot;St. James&quot; finally began a refit to modernise the destroyer, but just the following year, her refit was cancelled, and she was subsequently placed on the disposal list. In 1961, at Newport, &quot;St. James&quot; was broken up.

<doc id="655038" wikidata="Q2992232" url="?curid=655038" title="List of convicts on the First Fleet">
<text>The First Fleet is the name given to the group of eleven ships carrying convicts, the first to do so, that left England in May 1787 and arrived in Australia in January 1788. The ships departed with an estimated 775 convicts (582 men and 193 women), as well as officers, marines, their wives and children, and provisions and agricultural implements. After 43 convicts had died during the eight-month trip, 732 landed at Sydney Cove.

In 2005, the First Fleet Garden, a memorial to the First Fleet immigrants, friends and others was created on the banks of Quirindi Creek at Wallabadah, New South Wales. Stonemason Ray Collins researched and then carved the names of all those who came out to Australia on the eleven ships in 1788 on tablets along the garden pathways. The stories of those who arrived on the ships, their life, and first encounters with the Australian country are presented throughout the garden.

No single definitive list of people who travelled on those ships exists; however, historians have pieced together as much data about these pioneers as possible. In the late 1980s, a simple software program with a database of convicts became available for Australian school students, both as a history and an information technology learning guide. An on-line version is now hosted by the University of Wollongong.

Digitised images of the lists from the Orders in Council for the First Fleet are available on the Convict Indents Index.

The six ships that transported the First Fleet convicts were:
* &quot;Alexander&quot;
* &quot;Charlotte&quot;
* &quot;Friendship&quot;
* &quot;Lady Penrhyn&quot;
* &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;
* &quot;Scarborough&quot;

<doc id="655044" wikidata="Q384873" url="?curid=655044" title="Leash">
<text>A leash (also called a lead, lead line or [[tether]]) is a rope or similar material used to control an animal by attaching it to a collar, harness, or halter. In British English, a leash is generally for a larger (possibly dangerous or aggressive) animal, with lead being more commonly used when walking a dog.

==Types of leashes==

Leashes take many forms; for example:
* A simple metal chain.
* Very short tab leashes; a clip attached to a loop handle or to a short piece of leather with a knot or similar short handle. Allows very close, tight control of a dog in certain competition or training situations.
* Short, soft, braided leather leash with a loop handle and a clip to attach to the collar, usually about 4 feet in length, commonly used during obedience training. The softness enables the trainer to fold the leash into a shorter length and the braiding allows a firmer grip.
* Nylon webbing leash, also known as a tracking/training leash in the UK, usually 4 to 6 feet, with a loop handle and clip, most commonly used for walking dogs casually.
* Extended-length webbing leashes, 12 to 30 feet or more, also known as a tracking/training leash in the UK, usually with a loop handle and a clip, primarily for training at a distance or during tracking sessions.
* Slip-leash, usually with a loop handle and an adjustable, slipping loop at the other end that goes around the dog&#x27;s neck. Often used in work or competitions—such as dog agility—where the leash must be quickly removed and replaced.
* Retractable, a hook on a thin rope that retracts automatically into a large plastic handle, allowing the dog to wander 15 or 25 feet away while keeping the leash taut (in theory preventing it from tangling around obstacles or the dog&#x27;s legs) but still allowing the handler to reel in the dog for closer control.

There are also bicycle dog leashes, especially designed for people who enjoy taking their pet on a ride with the bike. The leash is an aluminum tube with a plastic coated cable which runs down through the tube. It extends out of the tube end a couple of feet to allow for ease of movement for the dog. One end connects to the bike and the other to the dog&#x27;s collar. This keeps them safely away from the bike. While bicycle leashes might be suitable for some dogs, they aren&#x27;t a good idea for all breeds. There are numerous safety considerations before attempting to bike with a dog.

Cat leashes and harnesses are also available on the market and are convenient for people who are not comfortable letting their pet free.

==Leash laws in the United States==
Many cities have passed legislation that requires dogs to be on leash in public areas; in some areas, cats are also required to be restrained (under control) on a leash, in a kennel, or in a cat-proof yard or house.

Purposes of a leash include: preventing animals from frightening or biting people or other animals, defecating and urinating in inappropriate places, endangering traffic, digging up lawns, causing other damage, getting lost, and getting away from owners. Leashes also provide a clear method of communication and ensure control during training of dogs.

In the United States, leash laws are different within each state. While some states do not have statewide leash laws and give localities power to make leash law, there are some other states in which leash laws apply statewide.

States that do not have statewide leash laws are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming.

In Connecticut, dogs are not permitted to run at large except in the situation of hunting. Still, if the dog has vicious propensities and the owner still allows it to run at large and a person is bitten, the owner can be fined for up to $1,000 and is also liable for 6 months of prison unless the victim has abused the dog and provoked the harmful behavior.

In Delaware, dogs are not allowed to run at large unless in situations when the owner is present and has control over the pet. An exception is for farm dogs. Also, during the night dogs must be kept in an enclosure from which they cannot escape, firmly secured with a collar or chain or other device, so they cannot stray from the premises, or are under the reasonable control of the owner or custodian. If an owner does not respect these laws and if the dog bites someone, the owner is subject to civil liability and for fines of up to $1,500.

Dogs in the District of Columbia must be kept on a leash as well. They are also not permitted on school grounds when school is in session or on any public recreation area without a leash.

Indiana is one of the states that has a restraint statute, which means that dogs must be restrained at all times. Otherwise, if the dog bites a person when not restrained the owner is subject to civil liability and criminal penalties.

Dogs are allowed to run at large during the night in Kentucky only if they are accompanied by and under control of their owner.

According to the leash laws of Louisiana, dogs are prohibited to run at large at all times of the day. The same law applies in Maine, where the only exception is for hunting dogs.

Missouri legislation requires that dogs are kept in leashes that are no longer than 10 feet when they are in state parks or on historic sites. Also, dogs that have rabies are not permitted to run at large.

In Nebraska, dogs may run at large only in counties where the population does not reach 80,000.

New Hampshire legislation does not allow dogs to run at large unless they are accompanied by their owner or custodian or when dogs are used for training or are trained for hunting, herding or exhibitions.

Illinois legislation prohibits owners from walking their dogs when they are not in a leash.

Dogs in New York must be restrained or confined at all times of the day. However, certain NYC parks allow dogs off leash at certain hours.

According to the North Carolina law, dogs are allowed to run at large during the night only if they are accompanied by their owner or a person who has received the owner&#x27;s permission to do so.

Ohio law requires one to &quot;keep the dog under the reasonable control of some person,&quot; but does not require a leash except for &quot;any female dog … at any time the dog is in heat.&quot; There are additional provisions for &quot;dangerous dogs&quot; that have injured a person or killed another dog.

Some Oregon counties and cities have leash ordinances that can be used to hold dog owners responsible for injuries resulting from their animal attacking or biting a person while running at large. These ordinances expand upon Oregon law, under which dog owners have limited responsibility for injuries caused by their dogs unless the owner was aware that the animal is abnormally dangerous.

Pennsylvania legislation states that dogs must be confined or firmly secured or reasonably controlled by a person, within the property of the owner.

Tennessee law prohibits dogs to run at large except in cases in which dogs are engaged in legal hunting or herding.

West Virginia and Wisconsin are states that do not have a law that requires dogs to be leashed. Still, they do have laws that hold dog owners and keepers liable for all damages caused by dogs that are permitted to run at large.

Different law applies to dangerous dogs and female dogs as in different states they are prohibited to run at large at all times. Also, in states such as Connecticut and Louisiana, guide dogs must also be leashed.

==Dog leashes==
Dog leashes are used to walk the dog in public places. Having the dog wear a leash is a way of protecting the dog and other persons (e.g., if the dog runs away and bites someone). The length is one of the important aspects of the leash. The length of the leash must be chosen according to the size of the dog and it is important because it allows a good control. Leashes should not be either too long or too short. Too-long leashes do not provide good control of the pet whereas too-short leashes are uncomfortable for both the dog and the owner. The perfect leash can restrain the dog but at the same time is not viewed as a punishment for the pet.

High quality dog leashes have a good quality metal clip and they can be made of leather, nylon or even chain. The metal clip must securely fasten to a metal ring on the collar in order to maintain good control of the dog. The material of which the leash is made of is not of great importance as long as the leash does not show evidence of wear or fraying. Therefore, leashes should be periodically checked to ensure they are maintained in proper condition.

An important aspect of dog leashes is their sturdiness. Although rope leashes are quite cheap, they are vulnerable to chewing and fraying and are not amongst the most recommended types of leashes. Nylon leashes are recommended; this material provides a bit of elasticity which is meant to result in more comfort for the dog. On the other hand, nylon leashes can cause chafe or can cut into the skin of the dog.

Leather leashes are often preferred over the nylon ones because of the resistance of the material and because it becomes more flexible with age and it is softer. Leather is however more prone to be chewed when compared to nylon.

The retractable dog leash is one of the most dangerous leashes for the dogs because they allow them to go as far as they want. Retractable leashes are usually made of nylon and the retractable device is made of plastic or a stronger composite. Although these leashes can be convenient for both the dog and the owner as it allows some control, they make it difficult to keep a dog under control which can result in persons or other dogs being attacked. Aggressive dogs should not be walked with such a leash, and puppies should be kept closely to ensure their protection from various dangers such as cars. Dogs with a tendency to bolt without warning should be walked with caution, as a retractable lead can allow the dog to accelerate to significant speed before being stopped, presenting the possibility of injury to both dog and owner.

Some leashes are made of reflective materials and are suitable for walking the dog at night. They are convenient because they make the dog and the owner much more visible in the traffic, reducing the likelihood of accidents.

==Cat leashes==

Cat leashes are used with the purpose of preventing the cat getting lost. Unlike dogs, cats rarely attack persons on the street, so cat leashes are mainly a safety measure to protect the pet itself. Very often the collars are replaced with harnesses, because they avoid the dangers of collars which include escaping and running away or choking. Cats are more likely to not be willing to be walked in a harness than dogs are, and are considered to need up to months to be able to adjust to wearing a harness.

Cat leashes come in a variety of colors, designs and models and are made of different materials. There are cat leashes made of leather, nylon and rope. Whereas the leather leash is one of the best qualities because of the characteristics of the material, it is also one of the most expensive and not very comfortable for the cat at the same time. Nylon cat leashes and harnesses are, however, more elastic, and thus more comfortable and also provide more control.

==Leashes for large animals==
Leashes are used on large animals—such as bovids, camelids, and equids—to lead them so that they will be forced to follow and come to a desired area—as well as to tether them to a specific area, such as to a fencepost or tree trunk, so that they will remain stationary and not run away. Oftentimes, leashes are used to tether such animals when they require separation, examination, or work to be done to them, such as grooming and tacking up.


==Notes==
* Dog leashes date back a very long time, both in art and written record, as a Proto-cuneiform tablet, Jemdet Nasr period, c. 3100–2900 BC features a &quot;figure guiding two dogs on a leash and hunting or herding boars in a reed marsh&quot;.
* Among hunters, a collection of three hares (&quot;a brace and a half&quot; or tierce) or three creatures of any kind, especially greyhounds, foxes, and deer, is called &quot;a leash&quot;.

* Child leashes, attached to child harnesses, ensure that young children do not wander far away from their guardians. The metal clip is attached to the harness that the child wears, while the other end containing the loop is held by the guardian.

<doc id="655049" wikidata="Q4114595" url="?curid=655049" title="The Wanting Seed">
<text>The Wanting Seed is a dystopian novel by the English author Anthony Burgess, written in 1962.

==Theme==
Although the novel addresses many societal issues, the primary subject is overpopulation and its relation to culture. Religion, government, and history are also addressed. A significant portion of the book is a condemnation of war.

Burgess once said, &quot;I have spent the last 25 years thinking that &quot;The Wanting Seed&quot; could, in my leisurely old age, be expanded to a length worthy of the subject.&quot;

==Plot==

The novel begins by introducing the two protagonists: Tristram Foxe, a history teacher, and his wife, Beatrice-Joanna, a homemaker. They have recently suffered through their young son&#x27;s death.

Throughout the first portion of the novel, overpopulation is depicted through the limitation and reuse of materials, and extremely cramped living conditions.

There is also active discrimination against heterosexuals, homosexuality being encouraged as a measure against overpopulation. Self-sterilization is also encouraged.

One of the major conflicts of the novel is between Tristram and his brother, Derek. Very much alike at first, Derek chose a different path from Tristram and pretends to be homosexual while in public, to help his career as a government official. Derek has an affair with Beatrice-Joanna, and when she forgets to take her State-provided contraceptives she becomes illegally pregnant. She has sex with her husband, Tristram, and his brother, Derek, within a 24-hour time span, thus the paternity of her twin boys is uncertain.

Life changes as the largely homosexual police (&#x27;greyboys&#x27;) become more repressive, and a mysterious blight spreads across the world threatening food supplies. Tristram is arrested after getting unintentionally mixed up in a protest and spends the next section of the novel in jail.

While he is imprisoned, formerly repressed religion begins to bloom, fertility rituals are endorsed, and the structure of society, as well as government, undergoes radical transformation. Cannibalism is openly practised in much of England. Beatrice-Joanna has run away, and is staying with her sister and brother-in-law in the countryside on their farm, where the blight is affecting even their chickens. She stays there until she delivers her twin sons, when members of the Population Police arrive to take her and her children to the city.

With the help of his cellmate, Tristram escapes and tries to rejoin his wife. He travels across England to his sister-in-law&#x27;s farm. He is so desperate for food that he briefly joins &quot;a dining club&quot;, a rather chaotic affair which provides food (composed of murdered human beings) and orgiastic behavior for its village membership.

His journey eventually takes him to a sort of soup kitchen, where he enlists in the newly recreated army, which has replaced the (largely eaten) greyboys and Population Police. This is the third section of the novel. In the army, Tristram is shipped to an unknown location to fight in the war, though the reader later discovers that he is in Ireland. In his first battle he discovers that there is no real enemy; the purpose of the &quot;war&quot; is population control by winnowing out the socially expendable. Companies, led by junior officers trained to recite patriotic verse, are sent to a made-up Western Front style battlefield to kill each other. Every other member of his unit is shot down as they emerge from their trench, but Tristram slips through the barbed wire surrounding the miniature war zone and begins his journey back to England.

Escaping back into general society, Tristram finds a new job. In his absence, Beatrice-Joanna has been moved to live with Derek. She has also brought the twins (it is implied that Derek is their father) and named them after her two brotherly lovers, Derek and Tristram Foxe.

At the last scene Tristram meets again his wife at Brighton pier.

The book closes with a translation of the final stanza of the French poet Paul Valéry&#x27;s poem &#x27;Le Cimetière marin&#x27;. The quotation clarifies the book&#x27;s themes:

The wind rises... we must try to live. The immense air opens and closes my book. The wave, pulverised, dares to gush and spatter from the rocks. Fly away, dazzled, blinded pages. Break, waves. Break with joyful waters...
==Cyclical history==

Often repeated in the novel is the concept that history is cyclical. As Tristram explains in the first few chapters to his slumbering history class, there are three phases: Pelphase, Interphase, and Gusphase.

Pelphase is named after Pelagianism, the theology of Pelagius. The Pelphase is characterised by the belief that people are generally good. Crimes have slight punishment, and the government tries to improve the population. The government works through socialism. According to Tristram &quot;A government functioning in its Pelagian phase commits itself to the belief that man is perfectible, that perfection can be achieved by his own efforts, and that the journey towards perfection is along a straight road.&quot; The novel begins – and ends – in Pelphase.

Interphase is the darkening of Pelphase into Gusphase – an &quot;Intermediate&quot; phase. As Tristram explains things, the government grows increasingly disappointed in its population&#x27;s inability to be truly good, and thus police forces are strengthened and the state becomes Totalitarian. In many respects, Interphase is a finite version of George Orwell&#x27;s 1984.

:&quot;&#x27;Brutality!&#x27; cried Tristram. ... &#x27;Beatings-up. Secret police. Torture in brightly lighted cellars. Condemnation without trial. Finger-nails pulled out with pincers. The rack. The cold-water treatment. The gouging out of eyes. The firing squad in the cold dawn. And all this because of disappointment. The Interphase.&#x27;&quot;

Gusphase is named after Augustinianism, the theology of St. Augustine of Hippo. In short, Gusphase involves the lifting of the Interphase. The leaders begin to realise how horrible they have become, and realise that they are being overly harsh. Therefore, the government relaxes its rules and creates havoc. Tristram describes the Gusphase: 
:&quot;The orthodox view presents man as a sinful creature from whom no good at all may be expected... It eventually appears that human social behaviour is rather better than any Augustinian pessimist has any right to expect, and so a sort of optimism begins to emerge. And so Pelagianism is reinstated.&quot;

==Characters==
*Tristram Foxe – a plodding but conscientious history teacher
*Beatrice-Joanna Foxe – Tristram&#x27;s unfaithful wife
*Derek Foxe – Tristram&#x27;s ambitious and opportunistic brother, becomes head of the Ministry of Infertility
*Mr. Livedog – the term used for God, who is both good and evil. He makes masses of useless life and it is the job of Mr. Homo, his master, to eliminate it. The phrase &#x27;god knows&#x27; is replaced by the phrase &#x27;dogsnose&#x27;. Note that the first part of the name, &quot;Live(d)&quot;, spelled backwards is &quot;(D)evil&quot; and the second part, &quot;dog&quot;, spelled backwards is &quot;God&quot;. 
*Roger Foxe – the deceased baby son of Tristram and Beatrice-Joanna. 
*Mavis – Beatrice-Joanna&#x27;s sister.
*Shonny – Mavis&#x27; husband and Beatrice-Joanna&#x27;s brother-in-law: an insensitive rural radical.
*The Blessed Ambrose Bayley – an unfrocked and alcoholic priest whom Tristam first meets in a bar, then shares a prison cell with.
*The Right Hon. Robert Starling – the effete but harassed Prime Minister of the English-Speaking Union during the initial Pelphase and subsequent Gusphase eras. Retires to comfortable exile while awaiting the political and social wheel to turn again in his favor.
*Captain Loosley – a bumbling Population Police officer who attempts to derail Derek Foxe&#x27;s civil service career.
*The Right Hon. George Ockham – the new Prime Minister following the entrance into Gusphase.

==Reception==
A review in &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said that the novel&#x27;s &quot;starting pace is fast and pointed, but this slows to a crawl when wit becomes predictable silliness&quot;.

<text>Colleen Marie Haskell (born December 6, 1976) is an American former reality show contestant, actress, and producer. She was a contestant on the of the American reality show &quot;Survivor&quot; in 2000. She also co-starred in the comedy film &quot;The Animal&quot;.

==&quot;Survivor&quot;==
===&quot;Borneo&quot;===

Haskell was a contestant on the original season of &quot;Survivor&quot; in 2000. She was a castaway on the Pagong tribe alongside B.B. Andersen, Greg Buis, Gretchen Cordy, Ramona Gray, Joel Klug, Jenna Lewis and Gervase Peterson. Haskell initially formed a bond with Buis, which is sometimes cited as the shows first &#x27;showmance&#x27;.

The two tribes merged into the Rattana tribe at the final ten, where the Tagi tribe had planned to vote out all the Pagong members systematically beforehand, where Haskell was the last remaining original Pagong member to be voted out, making her the fourth member of the jury.

At the final tribal council, Haskell had planned to vote for Richard Hatch but after Sue Hawk&#x27;s infamous &quot;rats and snakes&quot; speech and disliking Hatch&#x27;s answer to her question, she voted for Kelly Wiglesworth to win. Wiglesworth would go on to lose to Hatch in a 4-3 vote.

===Post-show===
Haskell was expected to reappear on &quot;Survivor&quot; during the &quot;&quot; edition in 2004. Producer Mark Burnett later confirmed that Haskell was offered a spot on the show, but she turned down the offer, saying that she had &quot;moved on with her life and just genuinely didn&#x27;t want to go through that again&quot;.

==Career==
After competing on &quot;Survivor&quot;, Haskell starred in the 2001 feature film comedy &quot;The Animal&quot;, playing Rianna, the love interest of Rob Schneider&#x27;s character.

Haskell also appeared in an episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; as a love interest of Hyde. In 2002, Haskell appeared in the TV show &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Me&quot;. She worked as an assistant producer on &quot;The Michael Essany Show&quot; in 2003 before leaving the entertainment industry.

<doc id="655065" wikidata="Q703370" url="?curid=655065" title="Xaver Scharwenka">
<text>Theophil Franz Xaver Scharwenka (6 January 1850 – 8 December 1924) was a German pianist, composer and teacher of Polish descent. He was the brother of Ludwig Philipp Scharwenka (1847–1917), who was also a composer and teacher of music.

==Life and career==
Scharwenka was born in 1850 in Samter, Prussia (Polish: Szamotuły; until 1793 and since 1919 part of Poland). His paternal ancestors originally came from Prague, then moved to Frankfurt on the Oder in 1696 - probably for reasons of faith - and settled thereafter in Samter. His father, August Wilhelm, was a gifted master-builder but decidedly did not have an ear for music. His mother, née Golisch, was an ethnic Pole from a family of some means, who was musically inclined and early on instilled in her children a love of music. Although he began learning to play the piano by ear when he was 3, Scharwenka did not start formal music studies until he was 15, when his family moved to Berlin and he enrolled at the Akademie der Tonkunst. Under Theodor Kullak, his pianistic skills developed rapidly, and he made his debut at the Singakademie in 1869. He taught at the academy until entering military service in 1873. Upon his discharge in 1874, Scharwenka began touring as a concert pianist. Praised for the beauty of his tone, he became a renowned interpreter of the music of Frédéric Chopin.

In 1881 Scharwenka organized a successful annual series of chamber and solo concerts at the Singakademie in conjunction with Gustav Holländer and Heinrich Grünfeld. That October he founded his own music school in Berlin. In 1886, he conducted the first in a series of orchestral concerts devoted to the music of Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt and Ludwig van Beethoven while continuing to tour extensively and play his works in collaboration with other artists such as the conductor Hans Richter and the violinist Joseph Joachim. This triple role as pianist, composer and educator would occupy Scharwenka for the rest of his career.

In 1891, Scharwenka made his first tour of America. Deciding to emigrate, he opened a New York branch of his Scharwenka Music School. In 1893 the Berlin Scharwenka Conservatory was united with the Klindworth Conservatory, and in 1898 he returned there as Director, from New York. In 1914, with W. Petzet, he opened a School of Music with a piano teachers&#x27; seminary attached. 

Among pianists who received some instruction from him were José Vianna da Motta, Fridtjof Backer-Grøndahl and Selmar Janson. His &quot;Methodik des Klavierspiels&quot; was published in Leipzig in 1907.

Sometime in the very early 1900s he conducted Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s G minor Concerto, at which the composer and pianist Marthe Servine made her debut. 

Scharwenka made several recordings for Columbia Records in 1910 and 1913, including works of his own, as well as pieces by Chopin, Mendelssohn, Weber and Liszt: his account of Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; (Op. posth. 66) is admired. His playing is also preserved on Welte-Mignon and Hupfeld piano rolls, including the Chopin A-flat Waltz, Op 42, and the F minor Fantaisie (Op. 49), his performance of which was famous. Some of his Hupfeld rolls were also converted for the American Ampico reproducing piano.
==Music==
Scharwenka&#x27;s own compositions include an opera (&quot;Mataswintha&quot;), a symphony, four piano concertos, chamber music (all with piano part) and numerous piano pieces; his piano idiom somewhat resembles Schumann and Rachmaninoff.

The four piano concertos are substantial works. The first, in B-flat minor, Op. 32, was completed in 1874 and premiered the following year. It was originally written as a solo piano fantasy, but Scharwenka was dissatisfied, and reworked it with orchestra into this form. Franz Liszt accepted the dedication and performed it in Berlin. Its first recording was made in 1968 with Earl Wild and the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Erich Leinsdorf. Wild had learned the concerto as a boy under Selmar Janson, who had studied it directly with the composer. When Leinsdorf asked Wild to record the concerto, he was able to say &quot;I&#x27;ve been waiting by the phone for forty years for someone to ask me to play this&quot;.

The fourth concerto, in F minor, Op. 82 (1908), was premiered on 18 October 1908 in the Beethovensaal, Berlin, with Scharwenka&#x27;s student Martha Siebold as the soloist and the composer himself conducting.

Scharwenka&#x27;s works were neglected for some years after his death; however, his &quot;Polish Dance No. 1&quot; in E-flat minor, Op. 3, No. 1, remained popular. Since the mid-1990s, however, interest in his music has been rekindled, and recordings of most of his works are now commercially available. 

The recording of his Fourth Piano Concerto played by Stephen Hough with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster was voted Record of the Year by the British music magazine Gramophone in 1996. His Symphony in C minor, Op. 60, received its CD premiere in 2004.

<text>Anita Denise Baker (born January 26, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter. She is known for her soulful ballads, particularly from the height of the quiet storm period in the 1980s.

Starting her career in the late 1970s with the funk band Chapter 8, Baker released her first solo album, &quot;The Songstress&quot;, in 1983. In 1986, she rose to fame following the release of her Platinum-selling second album, &quot;Rapture&quot;, which included the Grammy-winning single &quot;Sweet Love&quot;. , Baker has won eight Grammy Awards and has four Platinum albums, along with two Gold albums. Baker is a contralto with a wide range of octaves.

==Life and music career==
===1958–82: Early life, career beginnings and Chapter 8===
Anita Baker was born on January 26, 1958, in Toledo, Ohio. When she was two, her mother abandoned her and Baker was raised by a foster family in Detroit, Michigan. When Baker was 12, her foster parents died and her foster sister raised her afterwards. By the time Baker was 16, she began singing R&amp;B at Detroit nightclubs. After one performance, she was discovered by bandleader David Washington, who gave her a card to audition for the funk band, Chapter 8.

Baker joined Chapter 8 in 1975 and the group toured until securing a deal with Ariola Records in 1979. The group&#x27;s first album, &quot;Chapter 8&quot;, was released that year and featured the singles &quot;Ready for Your Love&quot;, a duet between Baker and bandmate Gerald Lyles, and the Baker-led &quot;I Just Want to Be Your Girl.&quot; After Ariola was bought out by Arista Records in 1979, Chapter 8 was dropped by the label who were convinced that Baker, as the group&#x27;s lead singer, didn&#x27;t have &quot;star potential.&quot; Baker returned to Detroit, working as a waitress and a receptionist until, in 1982, Otis Smith, a former associate of Ariola, convinced Baker to start a solo career under his Beverly Glen label.

===1983–88: &quot;The Songstress&quot;, &quot;Rapture&quot; and &quot;Giving You the Best That I Got&quot;===

Baker released her debut solo album, &quot;The Songstress&quot;, in May 1983. The album produced four singles: &quot;No More Tears&quot; and its B-side, &quot;Will You Be Mine&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing Yet&quot;. &quot;Angel&quot; became Baker&#x27;s first R&amp;B top ten single, reaching number five on the R&amp;B charts in late 1983. &quot;You&#x27;re the Best Thing Yet&quot; followed it in the R&amp;B top 40 early the following year.

Despite this early success, Baker later complained that she had not received any royalties from the work. In addition, the label delayed work on Baker&#x27;s follow-up of &quot;The Songstress&quot;. By 1984, after two years, Baker sought to leave the label but was sued by Smith for breach of contract in 1985. After months in court debating the matter, it was concluded that Baker should be allowed to record for other labels, winning the case against Beverly Glen label owner Otis Smith. Baker then signed with the Warner Music Group-associated Elektra Records label in 1985 and began working on her next album. Her Elektra contract allowed the singer to have creative control and produce her own music.

In March 1986, Baker released her second album, &quot;Rapture&quot;. While sales were initially slow following the release of the album&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Watch Your Step&quot;, Elektra released the mid-tempo ballad, &quot;Sweet Love&quot;, which became her first pop hit, reaching number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and also reaching the UK Top 20. The album eventually launched three further hit singles, including &quot;Caught Up in the Rapture&quot;, &quot;No One in the World&quot; and &quot;Same Ole Love (365 Days a Year)&quot;.

Throughout 1986 and 1987, Baker promoted the album by touring, headlining her first tour, &quot;The Rapture Tour&quot;, a show from which was later released on home video as &quot;A Night of Rapture&quot;. By 1988, the album had sold over 8 million copies worldwide, 5 million of which were sold in the United States alone. The album resulted in Baker&#x27;s winning two Grammy Awards at the 1987 ceremony.

In 1987, Baker collaborated with The Winans on their song, &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Need to Worry&quot;, which gave Baker a third Grammy, this time in the Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group, Choir or Chorus category.

Baker&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Giving You the Best That I Got&quot;, was released in October 1988 and immediately became a success, topping the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and selling 5 million copies worldwide, 3 million of which sold alone in the United States. The title track reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and topped the R&amp;B and adult contemporary charts, becoming her highest charting single. The follow-up, &quot;Just Because&quot;, reached the top 20 on the pop chart while also becoming an R&amp;B chart-topper, while a third single, &quot;Lead Me Into Love&quot;, became a top ten R&amp;B hit. The album resulted in three more Grammy Awards for the singer.

===1990–02: &quot;Compositions&quot;, motherhood, &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot; and tour===
In 1990, Baker released &quot;Compositions&quot;, which had Baker more involved in the songwriting and production process and the first in which she began incorporating more jazz elements than in previous albums. The album launched the singles &quot;Talk to Me&quot;, &quot;Soul Inspiration&quot; and &quot;Fairy Tales&quot;, and eventually sold over a million copies.

After the end of the album&#x27;s touring and promotion schedule in 1991, Baker took a break from the business to settle down with her husband at the time, later having two children with him. Meanwhile, Elektra bought the rights to, and reissued, her first album, &quot;The Songstress&quot;.

After appearing on Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Duets&quot; album, Baker returned to the charts with &quot;Rhythm of Love&quot; in 1994. The album featured &quot;Body and Soul&quot;, her first top 40 pop hit since 1989. The second single, the mid-tempo &quot;I Apologize&quot;, won Baker an eighth Grammy. The album eventually sold over two million copies: her fourth consecutive platinum-selling album. Baker undertook the &quot;Rhythm of Love World Tour&quot; from December 14, 1994, to November 14, 1995. Baker was transferred to another label within the Warner Music Group, Atlantic Records, in 1996.

Taking a hiatus after the end of the &quot;Rhythm of Love Tour&quot; to care for her two sons, Baker returned to the studio in 2000. In May 2001, she filed a lawsuit against Zomba Recording and its Dreamhire division for alleged damage to her recordings by a hired 24-track tape machine. Due to a label restructuring, Baker was let go from Atlantic that November without releasing any material with the company. During this hiatus, Rhino Records released the compilation, &quot;The Best of Anita Baker&quot; (named &quot;Sweet Love: The Very Best of Anita Baker&quot; in the UK) in June 2002. The album eventually was certified platinum by the RIAA, denoting sales in excess of 1,000,000 units in the US.

===2004–08: &quot;My Everything&quot;, &quot;Christmas Fantasy&quot; and tour===
That year, Baker returned to live performing, signing with Blue Note Records in March 2004. That September, Baker released the album, &quot;My Everything&quot;. The album peaked at number four on the Billboard 200 and number-one on the R&amp;B charts, eventually being certified gold.

In 2005, Baker released &quot;Christmas Fantasy&quot;, winning a Grammy nomination for the song, &quot;Christmas Time Is Here&quot;. In May 2005, Baker was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music. Starting in 2007, Baker embarked on a two-year concert tour titled &quot;An Evening with Anita Baker&quot;. She occasionally sang the American national anthem at sports events. &quot;I met Anita at the Grammy Awards in 2007,&quot; said Mary J. Blige. &quot;I told [her] how much she meant to me. She said, &#x27;I&#x27;m glad that you picked up the ball where I left off.&#x27; That meant a lot.&quot;

===2010–present: New music, tour, brief retirement, and comeback===
Baker had been working on a new album featuring the single, &quot;Only Forever&quot;, since 2010. In August 2012, Baker released her version of Tyrese&#x27;s hit, &quot;Lately&quot;. The song made headlines for Baker after the song was played every hour, on the hour, throughout the day on urban adult contemporary radio, making her the first artist to make this kind of debut. Though Blue Note set release dates for the album in October and December 2012, Baker decided she still needed to work on the album, causing delays. The album never materialized.

In February 2013, Baker returned to the national spotlight, performing &quot;Lately&quot; and &quot;Same Ole Love&quot; on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. That same month, she appeared at the Grammys where &quot;Lately&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Performance. In January 2017, Baker confirmed she had retired. She emerged from retirement in 2018.

In March 2021, Baker entered into a conflict with Elektra Records over rights to her master recordings, which she claimed were supposed to return to her after the expiration of her contract, according to copyright law. She asked fans to stop buying and streaming her music until the rights to her music were given to her. In September 2021, she announced that the dispute had been settled and that she owned her masters.

Baker performed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Philadelphia&#x27;s Lincoln Financial Field prior to the 2022 NFC Championship Game between the Eagles and San Francisco 49ers.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Baker at number 92 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Personal life==
Baker married Walter Bridgforth Jr. on December 24, 1988, at their home in Detroit. In the following year, Baker had a miscarriage. The couple separated in 2005 and finalized their divorce two years later. They have two sons, Walter Baker Bridgforth (born January 1993) and Edward Carlton Bridgforth (born May 1994). Baker currently lives in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan.

More than five years after her divorce, Baker filed for a legal last name change from Bridgforth to her maiden name in her private life.

Baker publicly endorsed presidential candidate Andrew Yang in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.

<text>Peter Jonathan Westbrook (April 16, 1952 – November 29, 2024) was an American saber fencer. He was a 13-time national and 3-time Pan American Games saber champion, five-time Olympian, and an Olympic bronze medalist. He founded the Peter Westbrook Foundation (PWF), a 501(c)(3) non-profit that uses fencing as a vehicle to help young people from under-served New York City communities develop life and academic skills. Westbrook died on November 29, 2024 in Manhattan, New York from liver cancer. He was 72 years old.

==Early life and education==
Westbrook&#x27;s father, Ulysses Jonathan Westbrook, was an American G.I. stationed in Japan during the Allied occupation of Japan after World War II when he met Mariko Wado-Westbrook, a Japanese woman, in the city of Kobe. They married in 1950, and soon after they moved to the United States, eventually settling in Newark, New Jersey. Peter and his younger sister Vivian were born in the United States, Peter in St. Louis.

Peter was four when his father left, leaving his mother to raise the family in the Hayes Homes housing project in central Newark. She remained in Newark, given her Japanese relatives’ objection to her returning to Japan with Black children. Raising the children Catholic, Mariko bartered with priests at the local parochial school (St. Peters/Queen of Angels) in exchange for schooling for Peter and Vivian, cleaning the church and assisting on bingo night.

His mother, 66 years old at the time, was killed in December 1993. After she offered friendly advice while on a Newark bus to a 31-year-old, 200-plus pound, fellow female passenger with regard to the young child the woman was traveling with, the woman became angry at her, cursed her, told her to mind her own business, and then pummeled and kicked her to death. Peter Westbrook said: &quot;I have never known such sadness&quot;. Her attacker pled guilty to aggravated manslaughter, and was sentenced to 16 years in prison.

== Fencing career ==
===High school ===
Westbrook&#x27;s fencing career started at Essex Catholic High School (&#x27;70) in Newark, when he was 13 years old, after his mother enrolled him in fencing to keep him out of trouble. He trained under Dr. Samuel D&#x27;Ambola, a medical doctor and the founder of the school’s fencing program, winning a New Jersey state individual championship in his junior year.

===College===

Westbrook attended New York University&#x27;s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, where he received a B.S. in Marketing in 1975. He received a full fencing scholarship, and trained under Hugo Castello, the multi-championship-winning coach who as of 1998 held the most wins of any college fencing coach in history.

In 1972, he began training with Csaba Elthes, a Hungarian saber coach who had emigrated to the United States, at the Fencers Club in New York City, but he stopped training with him after one year. He initially found Elthes to be intimidating, saying: &quot;Csaba&#x27;s theory is discipline with pain. Never a compliment, usually belittlement. I was stunned.&quot; It went beyond unkind words: &quot;I thought he was crazy. Then he started hitting me in the legs with his sabre every time I made a mistake, and I was wearing short pants, too. He said, &#x27;I want you to associate mistakes with pain.` And then, whack, whack, whack. Right across the thighs. Then I knew he was crazy.&quot; In 1973, he won the NCAA saber championship, and the NYU team won the team championship. Recognizing that his short time with Csaba had been beneficial, Westbrook returned to Csaba; as he recalled, &quot;after a year, it just wasn`t the same. I knew I needed him. I couldn`t believe it, but I did.&quot;

===National championships===
Westbrook won the U.S. National Men&#x27;s Sabre Championship 13 times (1974–75, 1979–86, 1988–89, and 1995). In 1974, as a college senior, Westbrook placed first at the Amateur Fencers League of America&#x27;s (now known as USA Fencing) National Championships, beating among others Olympians Alex Orban and Paul Apostol. He was the first black fencer to win the U.S. men&#x27;s saber national championship. Winning the Nationals made him an internationally recognized fencer.

===Pan American Games===
Westbrook competed at the Pan American Games from 1975-95, winning 11 medals (three of them gold medals). In 1975, Westbrook won a team silver medal and an individual bronze medal at the Pan American Games in Mexico City. In 1979, he won a Pan American Games team silver medal. These wins were soon accompanied by his 1983 individual gold medal and team silver medal. From 1987 to 1995, Westbrook won additional silver medals for individual performance (1987), two silver medals for team performance (1987, 1991), and gold medals for individual and team performances (1995).

===Olympics===
In 1976, Westbrook competed in his first Olympic Games; thereafter, he was part of every Team USA Olympic fencing team through 1996 (the US chose not to compete in 1980). During pre-competition sparring with a European fencer at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Westbrook tore two ligaments in his left ankle. He ended the competition ranked 13th.

At the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Westbrook won a bronze medal, and was the first American to win an Olympic fencing medal since Al Axelrod won a bronze medal in foil in 1960. He also became the first African American and Asian American to win a medal in fencing.

Westbrook served as flag bearer for the closing ceremonies of the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain.

== Peter Westbrook Foundation ==

===The PWF Elite Athlete Program===
Following his competitive fencing career, Westbrook founded and served as CEO of the Peter Westbrook Foundation (PWF), a non-profit that uses fencing as a vehicle to help young people from under-served New York City communities develop life and academic skills. Notable fencers trained by the foundation who have represented the United States at the Olympics include Akhi Spencer-El, Benjamin Bratton, Ibtihaj Muhammad, Daryl Homer, Curtis McDowald, Khalil Thompson, and Lauren Scruggs, who won a foil team gold medal and an individual silver medal in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

In 2000, the foundation was represented internationally for the first time when Ahki Spencer-el, Keeth Smart, and Keeth Smart&#x27;s sister Erinn Smart qualified for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. In 2004 four of the foundation’s fencers, Keeth Smart, Erinn Smart, Kamara James, and Ivan Lee represented the United States in the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. In 2008, Keeth Smart and Erinn Smart represented the United States in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, and both returned home with a silver medal.

Ivan Lee won 2001, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2008 saber U.S. national championships. Keeth Smart won the 2002 and 2004 national saber championship titles and was ranked # 1 in the world in saber in 2003 (the first-ever American to hold this rank). Erinn Smart won the 1998, 2002, 2004, 2007, and 2008 women&#x27;s foil national championships, and Kamara James was ranked # 1 in the world in women&#x27;s épée in 2004. Over 4,000 fencers, including 16 Olympians (five of whom won medals), began fencing at the foundation, which placed athletes on every U.S. Olympic team from the 2000 Sydney Games through the 2024 Paris Games.

===The PWF Academic Enrichment Program===
The Peter Westbrook Foundation Academic Enrichment Program provides one-on-one tutorial support, literacy assistance, SAT, PSAT, and specialized high school exam preparation, along with group workshops and productivity seminars on core academic skills, time management, motivational techniques, and homework habits. From October through June, students and tutors meet for 6 to 12 hours each month and students receive extra academic support.

==Writing==
In 1997, Westbrook published his memoir, &quot;Harnessing Anger: The Way of an American Fencer&quot;, in which he described turning his childhood experiences into a drive to succeed at his sport, and the inception of the Peter Westbrook Foundation.

In &quot;Harnessing Anger&quot;, Westbrook told how he came to be the first African American to win a national gold title in sabre fencing, along with his reaching international levels of success. Westbrook described how as the son of an African-American father and a Japanese mother, he was aided by his mother alone in poverty in a Newark ghetto. Becoming a fencer at an early age gave him the confidence and the discipline to use an ancient martial art to his advantage, both in swordplay and when facing the vicissitudes of daily life in the inner city.

&quot;Harnessing Anger: The Way of an American Fencer&quot; (1997) was nominated by the American Library Association for its Book of the Year Award.

==Death==
Westbrook died from liver cancer at a hospital in Manhattan, New York, on November 29, 2024, at the age of 72.

==Halls of Fame==
Westbrook was inducted into the Essex Catholic High School Hall of Fame in 1981, and the New York University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1985. He was inducted into the USFA Hall of Fame in 1996. He was also inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame of New Jersey in 2002, and into the Newark Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2021, he was inducted into the International Sports Hall of Fame. He was also inducted as a member into the FIE Hall of Fame.

<text>Allegan State Game Area is a forest attracting campers, hikers, bikers snowmobilers, cross-country skiers, horse trail riders and hunters. It is located in west-central Allegan County, Michigan, with one gateway just west of the city of Allegan. It is more commonly referred to as Allegan Forest.

==Camping==
It has two primitive campgrounds, one owned by the state of Michigan but operated by Allegan County. Ely Lake Campground is on Ely Lake, a small inland lake while the Silver Creek Campground is owned and operated by Allegan County. They both have picnic tables and fire pits at each campsite and vault toilets and water pump stations. Ely Lake, a non-motorized boat lake has a swimming beach and Silver Creek has a shallow spring-fed creek. They both welcome tent and hammock camping, as they are located in a heavily forested area. There are camping fees and reservations can be made. Silver Creek Campground also has a pavilion for day use with picnic tables and fire pits. Silver Creek Campground is in a good location for road biking as all the roads leading to Silver Creek are paved country roads, even though within the campground the roads are dirt.

The forest is a mixture, but largely hardwood. The Kalamazoo River flows through the northern portion. It is popular with canoeists and fisherman. Behind the Calkins Bridge Dam the Kalamazoo becomes the large, but shallow, Lake Allegan.

==Geography==

During hunting season, many come to hunt whitetail deer, Canada geese and wild turkeys.

Trails are laid out for hikers and horse riders in the summer and snowmobilers and cross-country skiers in the winter.

The forest is broken up by private ownership with sections of woods and sections of homes. The state occasionally buys private land to add to the forest and fill in the gaps.

<text>Theodor Kullak (12 September 1818 – 1 March 1882) was a German pianist, composer and teacher.

==Background==
Kullak was born on 12 September 1818, in Krotoszyn. He began his piano studies as a pupil of Albrecht Agthe in Poznań. He progressed sufficiently to excite the interest of the artistic Prince Anton Radziwill in his eighth year. This early ability to attract noble patronage was an art he continued to deploy to advantage for many years to come. In 1829, the prince used his influence to secure a Berlin court concert. He appeared with soprano singer Henriette Sontag. The usually undemonstrative King Frederick William IV was so delighted that he presented young Kullak with thirty Friedrichs d&#x27;or. He performed a concert in Breslau that was received with gratifying applause. The kindly Prince Radziwill then saw to a rounded education for Kullak, sponsoring his school fees in Sulechów (now in Poland).

Kullak eventually lost Radziwill&#x27;s patronage and from age thirteen to eighteen, had to make do with just occasional access to a piano. At age nineteen, at his father&#x27;s behest, he opted for a sensible profession and went to study medicine in Berlin. A new aristocratic friend, Count von Ingenheim, provided a small stipend which allowed him music studies with Siegfried Dehn and Wilhelm Taubert. Ingenheim was also instrumental in providing him with several pupils of rank. Medicine was not close to Kullak&#x27;s heart. Music was a more pressing vocation and in 1842 Hermine von Massow interceded on his behalf in the right places, and Frederick William IV placed 400 thaler at Kullak&#x27;s disposal, specifically for piano studies.

==Musical career==
Kullah moved to Vienna for his education. Carl Czerny happily took over his pianistic schooling, and Otto Nicolai and Simon Sechter, the theoretical side of things. Franz Liszt and Adolf von Henselt were also highly revered influences. Kullak played a little in Austria that year but in 1843 returned to Berlin where Fraulein von Hellwig secured him the post of pianoforte instructor to Princess Anna, the daughter of Prince Karl. This was just the beginning. Kullak seemed subsequently to make a speciality of teaching princes and princesses of the Royal house, as well as the offspring of many upper-class families who became aware of his excellent professorial qualifications, connections and, presumably, his unimpeachable manners.

In 1844, Kullak founded the Tonkünstler-Verein in Berlin and presided over it for many years. Two years later, at the age of twenty-eight, he was made Pianist to the Prussian Court, and four years after that founded the Berliner Musikschule (also known as the Kullak Institute) in partnership with Julius Stern and Adolf Bernhard Marx. However, due to dissension in the ensuing five years, Kullak retired from his institute, which then became known as the Stern Conservatory, with Hans von Bülow as a director.

In 1855, Kullak established a new school, the , which proved a lasting success and was affectionately referred to as &quot;Kullak&#x27;s Academy&quot;. It specialised in the training of pianists and became the largest private music school in the whole of Germany. By the time of its twenty-fifth anniversary it boasted a hundred teachers and eleven hundred students. Kullak was made professor in 1861 and was also elected to honorary membership of the Royal Academy of Music in Florence. Many other distinctions were also accorded him.

His son Franz received his musical education at his father&#x27;s ; he and completed his studies under Karl Wehle and Henry Litolff in Paris, but abandoned a concert career because of a nervous complaint, and instead taught at the where he succeeded his father as director upon his father&#x27;s death in 1882.

Kullak wrote a large amount of instructional piano music. His &quot;Die Schule des Oktavenspiels&quot; (&quot;The School of Octave Playing&quot;), published in 1848 and edited in 1877, is especially well known. His other music, including a piano concerto in C minor, and two sonatas, is very rarely played today.

Theodor Kullak edited and annotated a 13-book edition of the piano works of Frédéric Chopin that was published by Schlesinger and co-issued by G. Schirmer, Inc. and others in the 1880s. He also edited the complete piano works of Felix Mendelssohn, including &quot;Songs Without Words&quot;, published by C. F. Peters.

Among Kullak&#x27;s many pupils were August Arnold, Alfred Grünfeld, Agathe Backer Grøndahl, Heinrich Hofmann, Alexander Ilyinsky, Leonard Liebling, Moritz Moszkowski, Silas Gamaliel Pratt, Julius Reubke, Nikolai Rubinstein, Xaver Scharwenka, Otto Bendix, Hans Bischoff, Amy Fay, James Kwast and Fred Werner. Noted Bohemian pianist and composer Franz Bendel taught at the academy.

<text>Deidre Hall (born October 31, 1947) is an American actress and model. She is best known for her portrayal of Marlena Evans on the NBC/Peacock daytime drama &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, whom she has played for over 45 years.

Hall has won many awards for her portrayal of Marlena, including two Best Actress Soapy Awards in 1982 and 1983. Hall has won three Soap Opera Digest Awards for Outstanding Lead Actress in 1984, 1985, and 1995.
 Hall was the first recipient of the Outstanding Contribution by an Actress/Actor Award in 1986; in addition to receiving a shared award with Drake Hogestyn in 2005 for Favourite Couple: John and Marlena.
Hall has also been nominated for a Daytime Emmy three times.

==Early years==
The third of five children born to John and Jeanie Hall, Deidre and her twin sister, Andrea, were born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and raised in Lake Worth, Florida. She studied psychology before moving into acting.

==Career==
Along with her sister, Andrea, Hall appeared in press materials for the 1952 Hudson Twin-H-Power engine. In her late teens, Hall traveled to Los Angeles for the summer – while attending Palm Beach Junior College – and there she landed some modeling jobs and commercials through an agent. Quickly, she began appearing in television shows, thinking it was temporary until getting a serious career as a psychologist. In a later interview, she recalled that one day, she realized that acting was her serious career.

In the late 1960s Hall posed topless for various men&#x27;s magazines, under the names Glenda Cole &amp; Heidi Dorrington.

In 1976, she portrayed the superheroine Electra Woman in &quot;Electra Woman and Dyna Girl&quot;, a Sid and Marty Krofft live action children&#x27;s show that aired on Saturday mornings.

Hall appeared on a number of shows, including &quot;Emergency!&quot; (as Nurse Sally Lewis in the first two seasons), and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; (as Barbara Anderson), before joining &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in 1976 as Dr. Marlena Evans. In an interview, Hall said that she thought that she would have no chance to land the role of Marlena, considering that she was unsure about a career in soap operas, as well as having to compete against established soap opera veterans for the role. Hall was cast, though, and the role skyrocketed her to fame, which was proved by fan protests when a 1979 NBC promo hinted that Hall&#x27;s character would be killed off. Two separate daytime television magazines named Hall the best soap actress of 1983. 

In 1986, Hall began playing Jesse Witherspoon on the family drama &quot;Our House&quot;, which ran for two seasons on NBC. Wilford Brimley, who was 13 years older than Hall, played her father-in-law in the series; Chad Allen, her son; Shannen Doherty, her older daughter. Hall initially reacted without concern on playing on two television series at a time, explaining that she filmed &quot;Our House&quot; on weekdays while taping &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; on Saturdays. However, she left &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; in 1987 when it became too difficult to co-ordinate her prime time and daytime schedules. &quot;Our House&quot; was cancelled in 1988, though she did not immediately return to the soap opera. 

Hall made guest appearances on a variety of prime time shows until March 1991, when she made a return to &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. This decision was a result of a request by producer Ken Corday, who hoped her return would have influence on the low ratings. According to the actress, she was approached to play a new character, but she refused and insisted on portraying Marlena, with a contract for six months only. Producers were reluctant to give into Hall&#x27;s requests, fearing that the fans would leave after six months when she left. However, she remained on contract with the show for 18 more years until January 24, 2009, when she was terminated because of budget cuts mandated by NBC. Her salary on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; was in the range of $60,000 per month, much higher than most other daytime serial actors. On May 11th, 2023, Hall&#x27;s 5,000th Episode aired on Peacock, an NBC streaming service that exclusively carries &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. The episode featured a flashback of her first episode when she met Mickey Horton. 

In 1995, Hall produced and starred in &quot;Never Say Never: The Deidre Hall Story&quot;, a made-for-TV movie about her personal struggles to become a mother. Her longtime &quot;Days&quot; co-star Suzanne Rogers (Maggie Horton) is featured in the program.

Since at least early 2009, Hall has occasionally guest-hosted &quot;Clout&quot;, a talk radio program syndicated through Air America Media. In 2010, Hall and her writing partner Lynne Bowman wrote &quot;Deidre Hall&#x27;s Kitchen Closeup.&quot; In 2011, Hall guest-starred on the season finale of Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;Drop Dead Diva&quot;. She and Drake Hogestyn reprised their roles as Marlena Evans and John Black on September 26, 2011.

Hall received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2016.

==Personal life==
She has been married four times:
*William Hudson (May 6, 1966 – 1970)
*Keith Barbour (1972–1977), a singer
*Michael Dubelko (1987–1989), a producer and writer
*Steve Sohmer (December 31, 1991 – 2006), an author and screenwriter. Hall and Sohmer have two sons: David Atticus Sohmer and Tully Chapin Sohmer. Both were born via a surrogate mother known as &quot;Robin B&quot;.

In between her marriages to Barbour and Dubelko, Hall dated Louisiana State Senator Ned Randolph in the early 1980s. She made several campaign appearances during Randolph&#x27;s run for a seat in the United States House of Representatives in 1982, which he lost to incumbent Gillis William Long.
She is close friends with &quot;General Hospital&quot;&#x27;s Jane Elliot.

The Hall Family was one of the founding families of the town of Meriden, Connecticut, and Deidre is descended from two notable Halls. John Hall immigrated from England and settled in Boston in 1625. Another ancestor, Lyman Hall, was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence.

<doc id="655093" wikidata="Q2360751" url="?curid=655093" title="Keeth Smart">
<text>Keeth Thomas Smart (born July 29, 1978) is an American saber fencer, who was the first American to gain the sport&#x27;s top ranking for males in saber. A three-time Olympian, he won a silver medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing in team sabre.

==Early life and education==
Smart was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York City. His parents were Thomas R. Smart Jr. (a production manager and later an economist) and Liz Smart (a teacher who had come to the United States from Jamaica). At the urging of his parents, he and his younger sister Erinn began to learn fencing at the Peter Westbrook Foundation, whose founder, Olympic sabre bronze-medalist Peter Westbrook, was his mentor.

Smart graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1996. He graduated from St. John&#x27;s University in New York City in 2001, majoring in finance. He later received his MBA from Columbia University in 2010, and now works as a Senior Vice President for Chelsea Piers Fitness which he had joined in 2017.

==Fencing career==
Smart&#x27;s fencing coach was Yury Gelman.

During college, Smart was the NCAA sabre champion in 1997 and 1999, and took second place in 2001.

He was a member of the 1999 Pan American Games bronze medal team.

Smart competed in three Olympic Games in men&#x27;s saber. He placed 30th in the individual competition in the 2000 Olympic Games. He then placed 15th in the individual competition and 4th in the team competition at the 2004 Olympic Games.

He placed 6th in the individual competition at the 2008 Olympic Games, defeating eventual three-time individual Olympic champion Áron Szilágyi along the way, and won a silver medal in the 2008 team event. In the saber team semi-finals the United States had been losing to Russia 40–35, before Smart outscored Russian Stanislav Pozdnyakov 10–4 for the win, with Team USA beating the Russians 45–44, allowing the Americans to go on to win the silver medal. It was the first Olympic medal for the US men&#x27;s saber team since 1948.

His sister Erinn also earned a silver medal as part of the US women&#x27;s foil team at the 2008 Olympics.

In 2002 and 2004, Smart won the US national sabre championship. In 2003, he became the first American to be named the top-ranked fencer internationally.

==Personal life==
Keeth married Shyra (Cooper) Smart on May 27, 2007 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. They live in Brooklyn, New York, with their two children. Keeth and his sister Erinn are actively involved in the Peter Westbrook Foundation in New York City.

<text>Jean Chardin (16 November 1643 – 5 January 1713), born Jean-Baptiste Chardin, and also known as Sir John Chardin, was a French jeweller and traveller whose ten-volume book &quot;The Travels of Sir John Chardin&quot; is regarded as one of the finest works of early Western scholarship on Safavid Iran and the Near East in general.

==Life and work==
He was born in Paris, son of a wealthy merchant, jeweller of the Place Dauphine, and followed his father&#x27;s business. 
In 1664, he started working for the East Indies with M. Raisin, a Lyon merchant. 
They journeyed by Constantinople and the Black Sea, reaching Persia in early 1666. 
The same year the shah, Abbas II, made Chardin his agent for the purchase of jewels. 
In the mid-1667, he visited India and returned to Persia in 1669, and in the next year he arrived in Paris. 
He issued an account of some events to which he was an eyewitness in Persia, entitled &quot;Le Couronnement de Soleiman Troisième&quot; Paris, 1671. 
A learned nobleman, Mirza Sefi, a prisoner in his own palace at Isfahan, had entertained him, instructed him in the Persian language, and assisted him in this work. 
Peter de la Croix and Tavernier severely criticised it, while Ange de la Brosse strongly defended it.

Chardin again started for Persia in August of 1671. Traveling with writer and artist Guillaume-Joseph Grelot.
He was at Constantinople from March to July 1672. 
A quarrel between the grand vizier and the French ambassador made the position of French subjects dangerous, and Chardin escaped in a small vessel across the Black Sea, and made a most adventurous journey by Caffa, and through Georgia, and Armenia to Isfahan, which he reached in 1673. 
At Sapias, he was robbed by thugs in Samegrelo of all he possessed except two small bundles, worth £6,000. 
He stayed at Isfahan four years, following the court in all its removals, and making particular journeys throughout the land, from the Caspian to the Persian Gulf and the river Indus, and visiting several Indian cities. 
By these two journeys he realised a considerable fortune, and, deciding to return home, reached Europe in 1677 by a voyage round the Cape of Good Hope.

Of four volumes originally projected the first volume was published in 1686, &quot;Journal du Voyage . . . de Chardin en Perse et aux Indes Orientales,&quot; London, fol. 
An English translation was issued concurrently. 
This volume contains the author&#x27;s journey from Paris to Isfahan, and has the author&#x27;s half-length portrait by Loggan, with eighteen copper plates, mostly folding. 
His former work is reprinted there with a fulsome &#x27;Epistle Dedicatory to James II.&#x27;

Chardin in his preface announced three other volumes to follow. The last, which was to contain a short history of Persia, along with his diaries for 1675–77, never appeared. The other three volumes (with many additions to the first) were published at Amsterdam, 1711, 4to, &quot;Voyages de Mons. le Chevalier Chardin&quot;, as the complete work. In 1711 another edition, with his translation of &quot;La Relation des Mingreliens&quot;, by J. M. Zampi, appeared in ten vols., Amsterdam, l2mo; and in 1735 another edition was published in four vols. 4to, containing a great number of passages added from his manuscripts, but with many omissions of violent Calvinistic passages. The most complete reprint is that of M. L. Langles, in ten vols. 8vo, Paris, 1811. 
Chardin&#x27;s style of writing is simple and graphic, and he gives a faithful account of what he saw and heard. Montesquieu, Rousseau, Gibbon, and Helvetius acknowledge the value of his writings; and Sir William Jones says he gave the best account of Muslim nations ever published. 
Extracts from his works appear in all the chief collections of travels, but there is no complete English translation.

In 1681, Chardin determined to settle in England because of the persecution of Protestants in France. 
He was well received at court, and was soon after appointed court jeweller. 
He was knighted by Charles II at Whitehall, 17 November 1681. 
The same day he married a Protestant lady, Esther, daughter of M. de Lardinière Peigné, councillor in the Parliament of Rouen, then a refugee in London. 
He carried on a considerable trade in jewels, and in the correspondence of his time was called &#x27;the flower of merchants.&#x27; 
In 1682, when he lived in Holland House, Kensington, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. 
In 1684, the king sent him as envoy to Holland, where he stayed some years, was styled agent to the East India Company. 
On his return to London he devoted most of his time to oriental studies. 
In the prefaces to his works, 1686 and 1711, besides travels he speaks of what he calls &#x27;my favourite desipi,&#x27; or &#x27;Notes upon Passages of to the Holy Scriptures, illustrated by Eastern ally Customs and Manners,&#x27; as having occupied his time for many years.

He did not live after to publish it, and after his death the manuscript was supposed to be lost. 
Some of his descendants advertised a reward of twenty guineas for it. 
When Thomas Harmer published a second edition of his &quot;Observations on divers passages of Scripture&quot;, 2 vols., London, 1776, 8vo, it was found that he had recovered the lost manuscript in six small volumes with the help of Sir Philip Musgrave, a descendant of Chardin, and had incorporated almost all of them in his work, under the author&#x27;s name, or signed &#x27;MS. C.,&#x27; i.e. manuscript of Chardin.

In his latter years Chardin lived at Turnin.
Sir John died in Chiswick, London in 1713. He was buried in Turnham Green (Chiswick). A funeral monument to Chardin exists in Westminster Abbey, bearing the inscription &quot;Sir John Chardin – nomen sibi fecit eundo&quot; (&quot;he made a name for himself by travelling&quot;).

The remains of Chardin&#x27;s library were sold by James Levy at Tom&#x27;s coffee-house, St. Martin&#x27;s Lane, 1712–13.

==Family==

He had four sons and three daughters. His eldest son, John, was created a baronet 1720 and died unmarried. He had three others, Daniel, Charles and George. He left his large Kempton Manor House and estate, Sunbury-on-Thames to his nephew Sir Philip Chardin Musgrave.

===Value of Chardin&#x27;s work===
Modern scholars consider the 1811 edition of &quot;Voyages&quot; (edited by the Orientalist Louis-Mathieu Langlès) to be the standard version. The complete book has never been translated into English; in fact, English-language versions contain less than half of the original material.

Early readers commended Chardin&#x27;s work for its fullness and fidelity, and he received praise from a number of Enlightenment thinkers, among them Montesquieu, Rousseau, Voltaire and Gibbon. Latter-day scholars of Persia also vouch for his importance; according to John Emerson, &quot;his information on Safavid Persia outranks that of all other Western writers in range, depth, accuracy, and judiciousness.&quot; Chardin travelled far and wide, had a good command of the Persian language, and left detailed accounts of the places and people he encountered. He also had direct access to the Safavid court, and his descriptions of contemporary politics and administration are highly regarded. Although there are occasional lapses in his books, he is generally trusted as a reliable witness, and his work has been used as a source for diverse studies on Safavid history, government, economics, anthropology, religion, art and culture.

==French-language biographies of Chardin==
Jean Chardin&#x27;s life story forms the basis of Dirk Van der Cruysse&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;Chardin le Persan&quot;, and of the partly fictionalised 2011 biography, &quot;Le Joaillier d&#x27;Ispahan&quot; by Danielle Digne.

<text>The Dingleys is an early South African television family drama from 1977, following the South African Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s introduction of television. Set in Pietermaritzburg in Natal (now KwaZulu-Natal), it centred on a fictional middle-class, white South African, English-speaking family, the Dingleys, who own a bookshop.

The series starred John Hussey, Vera Blacker, Sybel Coetzee and Eckard Rabe. It was directed by Bill Faure.
Although some outdoor scenes were shot on location in Pietermaritzburg, most of the show was recorded on a set in the SABC&#x27;s Johannesburg studios. Celia Motsie, who played the only black character in the series, was removed after she shared a table with white cast members in the SABC&#x27;s whites-only canteen.

It received mixed reviews from South African viewers, with the &quot;Rand Daily Mail&quot; publishing complaints from readers under the heading &quot;The Dingleys are dreadful&quot;, although others described it as &quot;good clean fun&quot;, praising the sight of &quot;a family sticking together - be it rather conservative and dull.&quot;

The theme song, &quot;Dingley&#x27;s Bookshop&quot;, was performed by Rabbitt, and featured on their album &quot;A Croak And A Grunt In The Night&quot;. One of its members, Duncan Faure, was the brother of the programme&#x27;s producer.

<doc id="655115" wikidata="Q240225" url="?curid=655115" title="Kazuki Takahashi">
<text>, known professionally as , was a Japanese manga artist. He is best known as the author of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1996 to 2004. The manga spawned a trading card game of the same name, which holds the Guinness World Record for the best-selling trading card game of all time.

==Early life==
Kazuo Takahashi was born in Tokyo on October 4, 1961. In his childhood, he drew artwork of manga he enjoyed such as &quot;Tiger Mask&quot;, &quot;Ultraman&quot;, &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, &quot;Devilman&quot;, and &quot;Kamen Rider&quot;. He also played tennis in his youth.

Disinterested in his studies, Takahashi was shamed by his homeroom teacher as &quot;the poop machine that knows nothing except eating, sleeping and pooping&quot; in front of other students. Angered by the humiliation, Takahashi decided to become a manga artist. In his second year of high school, he also sought to be a background animator of Tezuka Productions. He planned to drop out of school if he passed the recruitment exam, but he failed as his drawing skills were not yet up to industry standard. Takahashi gave up on his goal of becoming an animator, instead becoming a designer of corporate logos and banners, which included making designs for pachislot panels. It was at this time he started submitting his manga to publishers.

==Career==
In 1981, at the age of 20, Takahashi&#x27;s one-shot manga &quot;Ing! Love Ball&quot;, submitted under the pen name &quot;&quot;, won the Shogakukan New Comic Award and was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; in the same year. His serial debut was in 1986 with &quot;Gō-Q-Chōji Ikkiman&quot;, an adaptation of the TV sports anime of the same name, published in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Weekly Shōnen Magazine&quot;. In the meantime, Takahashi explained that he experienced extreme poverty as his home lacked electricity and he made thirty-six times of credit card installments in the magazine. George Morikawa, author of &quot;Hajime no Ippo&quot;, described his living place from that time as &quot;dilapidated Showa era wooden apartment that people immediately thought of&quot;. Because his early works were unprofitable, Takahashi switched his direction to Shueisha. In 1990, his one-shot &quot;Tokiō no Taka&quot; was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. Another manga, &quot;Tennenshoku Danji Buray&quot;, was published in the magazine from 1991 to 1992.

In 1996, Takahashi launched &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; under the pen name &quot;Kazuki Takahashi&quot; in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, where it was serialized until 2004. The series became a huge success and has sold more than 40 million copies. It has also received several media adaptations, notably an anime television series and a trading card game developed by Konami, which holds the Guinness World Record for the best-selling trading card game in history, with more than 25.1 billion cards sold as of 2011. Following the end of the original manga&#x27;s serialization, Takahashi would supervise adaptions made by his assistants, such as &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! R&quot; by Akira Itō, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; by Naoyuki Kageyama and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s&quot; by Masashi Sato. He was also involved in the animation production of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Bonds Beyond Time&quot; and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Dark Side of Dimensions&quot;.

In 2013, his one-shot manga &quot;Drump&quot; was released in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. In 2015, Takahashi received the Inkpot Award from Comic-Con International for his outstanding contributions to comics. In 2018, Takahashi published the limited series &quot;The Comiq&quot; in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. Takahashi also wrote a two-part manga, titled &quot;Secret Reverse&quot;, for the &quot;Marvel × Shōnen Jump+ Super Collaboration&quot;, which was released on &quot;Shōnen Jump+&quot; in September 2019.

==Style==
Takahashi&#x27;s early art style was comical and influenced by traditional anime. Some illustrators such as Drew Struzan, Alphonse Mucha, and Norman Rockwell had a tremendous impact on Takahashi&#x27;s later art style. His choices of traditional art tools were g-pen, watercolors and Copic markers, whereas Adobe Photoshop and Painter were the art programs he used during post manga serialization.

==Personal life==
Takahashi enjoyed playing games such as shogi, mahjong, card games, and tabletop role-playing games. In an interview with &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;, Takahashi stated that his favorite manga from other authors included &quot;Akira&quot; by Katsuhiro Otomo, &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot; by Hirohiko Araki, and &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; by Akira Toriyama. He also enjoyed reading American comics and stated that Hellboy was his favorite American comic book character. His pet dog, a shiba inu named , was the basis for the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Trading Card Game monster card ; the card&#x27;s artwork was personally drawn by Takahashi. Takahashi also enjoyed sea diving and visited Okinawa seaside each July.

Takahashi occasionally expressed his political views in his art, such as when he posted a drawing on Instagram of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; characters criticizing Shinzo Abe&#x27;s government and asking his followers to &quot;vote for justice&quot; in the 2019 House of Councillors election. He later apologized.

===Death===
On July 6, 2022, Takahashi was found dead in the water off the shore of Nago, Okinawa, by Japan Coast Guard officers following a civilian report from a passing boat. He was found wearing snorkeling gear, and his cause of death was determined to be drowning.

It was subsequently reported, first in the American military newspaper &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; on October 11, that Takahashi had died in the afternoon of July 4 while assisting in the rescue of three others who were caught in a rip current.

<doc id="655116" wikidata="Q12334423" url="?curid=655116" title="Sam Malone">
<text>Samuel &quot;Mayday&quot; Malone is a fictional character and the protagonist of the American television show &quot;Cheers&quot;, portrayed by Ted Danson and created by Glen and Les Charles. Sam is a former relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox baseball team who owns and tends the bar called &quot;Cheers&quot;. He is also a recovering alcoholic and a notorious womanizer. Although his celebrity status was short-lived, Sam retains that standing within the confines of Cheers, where he is beloved by the regular patrons. Along with Carla Tortelli and Norm Peterson, he is one of only three characters to appear in all episodes of &quot;Cheers&quot;. Sam has an on-again, off-again relationship with the bar waitress Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) for the series&#x27; first five seasons until her departure from the series. Then he tries to seduce Diane&#x27;s replacement, Rebecca Howe (Kirstie Alley), who frequently rejects his advances. Sam also appears in &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot;, a crossover episode of the spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot;.

Other actors auditioned for the role. Producers decided to give Danson the role for primarily his scenes with Shelley Long as Diane. Critical reception for the character has been mostly positive. Some academics considered Sam an example of satirizing masculinity. For his performance as Sam, Ted Danson won two respective Emmy Awards as an Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 1990 and 1993 and two Golden Globe Awards as a Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Series.

==Role==
At the time the series debuted in 1982, Sam has been the bartender and owner of Cheers for five years. Chronologically within the series, Sam, who is Irish Catholic, dropped out of high school in his senior year to play professional baseball. He has one older brother, Derek, who seems to be a polymath and is a highly successful international lawyer. Derek and Sam are not close, and Sam is also not close to his parents (who it is implied, always favored Derek.)

Sam began his career in the minor leagues, where he met Coach Ernie Pantusso (Nicholas Colasanto). He eventually became a relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, wearing number 16. His major league career lasted approximately five years; he specifically mentions having pitched in 1973, and was a member of the 1975 AL champion Red Sox team. As well, Martin Crane saw him pitch at the Kingdome, which opened in 1977 – also the year that he became the owner of Cheers. Although his baseball career is not highly detailed throughout the series, Sam was at times a good-to-very-good pitcher (stories of him retiring star batters occur during the series), and was the team&#x27;s bullpen ace for a while. Sam&#x27;s baseball career declined when he became an alcoholic, and there are also numerous stories of him pitching poorly and giving up tape-measure home runs. Over time, Sam&#x27;s role as a bartender turns him into the &quot;resident ringleader for an assortment of poor souls and wanna-be&#x27;s&quot;.

Throughout the series, Sam has had casual female partners, usually one-dimensional or sexually very available, and sometimes takes them along in his red Chevrolet Corvette. However, in &quot;Sam Turns the Other Cheek&quot; (episode 49, 1984), Sam reveals that he avoids &quot;married, underage, and comatose&quot; women, so he does have some ethical standards. In &quot;Teacher&#x27;s Pet&quot; (season 3, 1985), Sam earns his high school diploma despite an overall bad grade from the high school geography teacher, with whom he had a brief affair while he was her student. The episode &quot;Sam&#x27;s Women&quot; (episode 2, 1982) reveals that Sam was married to his somewhat more sophisticated ex-wife, Debra (Donna McKechnie). (In some syndicated prints, Sam&#x27;s past marriage is omitted, although it is mentioned again in the 5th-season episode, &quot;Young Dr. Weinstein&quot;.) Notably, he has an on-and-off relationship with &quot;a bright, attractive graduate student&quot;, Diane Chambers (Shelley Long). One time after Sam and Diane ended their on-and-off relationship, in &quot;Rebound, Part One&quot; (episode 45, 1984), Sam relapses into alcoholism and excessively womanizes. Diane finds this out from Coach, and involves her new love interest Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) in helping Sam slowly regain his sobriety in the following episode, &quot;Rebound, Part Two&quot;. In the three-part episode &quot;Strange Bedfellows&quot; (episodes 93–95, 1986), Sam dates an intelligent, attractive politician Janet Eldridge (Kate Mulgrew), who eventually ends the relationship because of Sam&#x27;s visible feelings for Diane. Throughout the fifth season (1986–87), Sam cyclically proposes to Diane, but she rejects every proposal until, in &quot;Chambers vs. Malone&quot; (episode 108, 1987), Diane finally accepts his latest proposal. In &quot;I Do, Adieu&quot; (episode 121, 1987), Sam and Diane try to marry but call off the wedding to let her start a supposedly promising writing career.

In the following episode &quot;Home Is the Sailor&quot; (episode 122, 1987), Sam sells Cheers to the Lillian Corporation six months before the episode and later returns to the bar to work under employment of the &quot;voluptuously beautiful&quot; new manager, Rebecca Howe. Within this period, Sam constantly flirts with and attempts to seduce Rebecca, but she rejects all of his advances. In &quot;Cry Harder&quot; (episode 194, 1990), Sam is able to buy back the bar from the Lillian Corporation after Sam has saved the corporation from financial victimization by Robin Colcord (Roger Rees), Rebecca&#x27;s lover. At the last minute, Sam and Rebecca embrace and kiss. However, in the following episode &quot;Love Is a Really, Really, Perfectly Okay Thing&quot; (episode 195, 1990), Sam devastatingly tells Rebecca that he has no feelings for her. In &quot;The Days of Wine and Neuroses&quot; (1990), Sam rejects Rebecca&#x27;s advances one night while she is drunk over her doubts when now-impoverished Robin proposed to her. In the tenth season (1991–92), they try to conceive a child, but by then, they have decided to stay friends. In &quot;The Guy Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; (1993), Sam plays with the idea of marrying Rebecca (as a safety net &quot;in case no one better comes along&quot;), but several bar patrons and even Carla tell Sam his womanizing is getting him nowhere, prompting him to join Dr. Robert Sutton&#x27;s (Gilbert Lewis) group meetings for sex addicts, a referral made by Frasier. In the series finale, &quot;One for the Road&quot; (1993), Sam reunites with Diane after six years of separation. They try to rekindle their relationship, but just before they fly off together to California, Sam and Diane begin to have doubts about their future together, and they re-separate. Sam returns to the bar, where his friends celebrate his return. Then, when Norm and Sam remain while everyone else leaves, Norm reassures Sam that Sam would return and never leave his one &quot;true love&quot;which the &quot;TV Guide&quot; implies is the Cheers bar.

In a &quot;Frasier&quot; episode, &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot; (1995), Sam is engaged to Sheila (Téa Leoni), a fellow sex addict whom he met during group therapy, but he breaks off the engagement after she admits that she slept with two regular Cheers customersPaul Krapence and Cliff Clavinduring their engagement. Unbeknownst to Sam, she slept with Frasier, which she does not reveal to Sam.

===Skit appearances===
Ted Danson reprised the role of Sam Malone in pre-game segments of the 1983 Super Bowl and of one of the baseball games of the 1986 World Series, &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot; episode &quot;Mickey&#x27;s 60th Birthday&quot;, and &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Fear of Flying&quot;. In the Super Bowl pregame skit, Sam and his customers at the bar chide Diane for not knowing and ridiculing football. They meet Pete Axthelm, an NBC sportscaster who visits the bar. In the pregame skit of the 1986 World Series game, Bob Costas interviews Sam at the bar. In &quot;Mickey&#x27;s 60th Birthday&quot;, Sam forgets Rebecca&#x27;s birthday and begs Mickey Mouse to sing &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; as her birthday present. Rebecca chooses Mickey over Sam, who still wants to seduce her. In &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Sam is dating twins while trying to marry Diane without Rebecca knowing.

==Development==
===Conception, writing, and casting===

Before the series began in September 1982, various actors considered or were considered for the role of Sam Malone. Before he was cast, Ted Danson appeared in films and television series. Danson appeared in the 1979 film &quot;The Onion Field&quot;, adapted from the nonfiction book of the same name, as Officer Ian Campbell, who was murdered by two criminals. Danson also appeared in &quot;Taxi&quot; episode, &quot;The Unkindest Cut&quot; (1982), as one-time character Vincenzo Senaca—&quot;a flamboyant and decidedly effeminate hairdresser, who ruined Elaine&#x27;s but got his comeuppance at the end.&quot; &quot;Cheers&quot; creators Glen and Les Charles—along with James Burrows—were executive consultants for the episode. Danson, William Devane and Fred Dryer were shortlisted for the role of Sam Malone. Ed O&#x27;Neill auditioned for the role but did not win the part. John Lithgow missed the audition because he was ill.

Originally, Sam Malone was intended &quot;to be a former wide receiver for the American football team, New England Patriots.&quot; Fred Dryer was initially chosen for that role because he is a former football player, but the Charles brothers chose Danson because NBC executives noticed the chemistry between him and Shelley Long. The character then evolved into a former relief pitcher for the baseball team Boston Red Sox. To prepare for the role, Danson attended a bartending school in Burbank, California.

Fred Dryer later appeared as Dave Richards, one of Sam Malone&#x27;s friends and a sports commentator, in &quot;Cheers&quot;. Danson said:
Sam is &quot;athletically handsome&quot; and a womanizer who casually dates and has sex with various women &quot;who want to have fun&quot;. However, his relationships invariably fail. Les Charles said that Sam was a &quot;straight man&quot; to Diane; after Shelley Long&#x27;s departure, he became more &quot;carefree&quot; and a &quot;goof-off.&quot;

Ted Danson wore a hairpiece to conceal his baldness for the role of Sam Malone during filming of &quot;Cheers&quot;. His baldness was revealed at the 42nd Primetime Emmy Awards (1990). In the episode &quot;It&#x27;s Lonely on the Top&quot; (1993), Sam Malone reveals his baldness to Carla (Rhea Perlman).

Danson earned per episode as Sam Malone during the last few years of &quot;Cheers&quot;. In the final season of &quot;Cheers&quot; (1992–93), Danson decided to stop portraying Sam Malone, which contributed to the end of &quot;Cheers&quot;. Danson said about the way the character changed, &quot;He got older, you know ... [the writers] tried to make him Sammy again. But he&#x27;s 45 now. I&#x27;m 45. It&#x27;s OK to be chasing around when you&#x27;re 37. But when you&#x27;re 45, it&#x27;s kind of sad to be chasing around that way.&quot; The producers tried to continue the show without Ted Danson, and they attempted to move the show to the first-run syndication, but these ideas were shelved.

===Characterization and analysis===
Sam&#x27;s on-screen relationships with Diane and Rebecca were inspired by works about the &quot;mixture of romance and antagonism of two people, [portrayed by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn], in a competitive situation&quot;.

Sam is subject to a satire of masculinity. He is described as &quot;a sleazy, promiscuous, aggressive, exhibitionistic narcissist&quot;, one of the &quot;new macho [heroes]&quot; of the 1980s pop culture, &quot;the target of humor,&quot; and not a &quot;likely [candidate] to lead the post-feminist counter revolution.&quot; A new macho hero of the 1980s is the opposite of a pre-1980s macho hero that &quot;constituted an antifeminist backlash&quot;.

Steve Craig from the University of North Texas wrote in his 1993 journal that Sam is a parody of &quot;traditional male values&quot; and of a negative stereotype of masculinity. Craig wrote that Sam&#x27;s attempts to define and exemplify &quot;his version of masculinity&quot; are satirized throughout the series &quot;to explore gender identity&quot; without threatening the viewer&#x27;s own definition of one&#x27;s own gender. In his 2011 book &quot;Primetime Propaganda&quot;, Ben Shapiro, an American conservative commentator, called Sam &quot;a dog, a feminist caricature of men&quot;, and a cultural representation of the &quot;lower-class conservative,&quot; in contrast to portrayer Ted Danson, who identifies himself as liberal. Glen Charles, a creator of &quot;Cheers&quot;, considered Sam &quot;a spokesman for a large group of people who thought that [the women&#x27;s movement] was a bunch of bull and look with disdain upon people who don&#x27;t think it was&quot;.

Heather Hundley wrote that the series sends &quot;double standards&quot; about promiscuous men and women. Hundley said that Sam is portrayed as heroic. She further wrote that Sam never suffers from consequences of his promiscuity and has been happily single and childless, while it portrays Carla Tortelli as a &quot;nymphomaniac&quot; who regrets her own promiscuities, which lead to out-of-wedlock pregnancies. She said the series&#x27; portrayal of premarital sex is &quot;negative and unhealthy&quot;, omitting other dangers of promiscuity such as sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS. Mark LaFlamme of the &quot;Sun Journal&quot; called Sam&#x27;s relationship with Rebecca Howe &quot;mundane&quot; and his flirtation with her &quot;bawdy&quot;.

Throughout most of &quot;Cheers&quot;, Sam is &quot;allowed to be happy [and to live] a rich life&quot;. Towards the end of the series&#x27; run, however, Sam undergoes therapy for sex addiction. In a 1995 episode of &quot;Frasier&quot; called &quot;The Show Where Sam Shows Up&quot;, Sam is depicted as a self-identified sexual addict; he gets help from group meetings and commits to changing himself.

Sam Malone has been compared with some of Ted Danson&#x27;s later roles. In 1998, David Bianculli from &quot;New York Daily News&quot; called Danson&#x27;s guest appearance as a plumber in &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot; Sam Malone&#x27;s &quot;close cousin: a confident womanizer, and not the brightest guy in the room&quot;. In 1999, Danson said that Sam Malone and John Becker (&quot;Becker&quot;) are both &quot;very lonely men&quot;.

==Reception==
Bill Simmons writing for ESPN praised Danson&#x27;s performance for giving life and color to Sam Malone. In &quot;The Complete Idiot&#x27;s Guide&quot; book, John Steve and Carey Rossi said Sam Malone &quot;[brings] magic to establishment&quot; and is praised for &quot;successfully running [&quot;Cheers&quot;].&quot; &quot;The Shark Guys&quot; website ranked Sam at number three on its list of the &quot;top ten coolest bartenders of all time&quot;. In a 2009 NPR interview, Terry Gross called Sam &quot;the opposite of intellectual&quot;.

Woody Harrelson, who played Woody Boyd, called Sam the person who brings an ensemble together. Roger Rees, who portrayed Robin Colcord in &quot;Cheers&quot;, said that no other character could fill in Sam Malone&#x27;s spot if he was written out of the show. Rees also said that the show would not survive without Sam and Danson. Television critic Phil Rosenthal from &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; said Danson&#x27;s performance as Sam was irreplaceable and that no other actor could capture Sam&#x27;s &quot;sexiness, vulnerability, and goofiness&quot;. Rosenthal credited Sam Malone for helping the series survive by becoming the show&#x27;s central character.

According to the April 1–4, 1993, telephone survey of 1,011 people by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press (now Pew Research Center), Sam Malone was a top favorite character by 26%. The survey asked which character Sam should marry. 21% voted Diane Chambers, 19% voted Rebecca Howe, 48% voted Sam to stay single, and 12% had &quot;no opinion&quot; on this matter. When asked which character should star in a spin-off, 15% voted Sam, 12% voted Woody Boyd (Woody Harrelson), 10% voted Norm Peterson (George Wendt), and 29% voted no spin-offs. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer), whose own spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot; debuted in September 1993, was voted by 2% to have his own show.

According to a 1993 article in &quot;People&quot; magazine, newspaper columnist Mike Royko chose Diane to be with Sam. Novelist Jackie Collins picked Rebecca. Celebrated personality Zsa Zsa Gabor chose both as Sam&#x27;s potential partner. Tennis player Martina Navratilova found Sam too good for either of them. Novelist-archaeologist Clive Cussler said Carla Tortelli (Rhea Perlman) was &quot;Sam&#x27;s best bet.&quot;

Sam&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Frasier&quot; received mixed notices. Scott D. Pierce from &quot;The Deseret News&quot; found him too &quot;old and [tiring].&quot; Nevertheless, John Martin, a syndicate writer from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, enjoyed Sam&#x27;s interaction with main characters of &quot;Frasier&quot;. Frazier Moore from &quot;The Associated Press&quot; called Sam&#x27;s appearance a ratings ploy but a must-see for a &quot;Cheers&quot; fan and any other viewer who lacks interest in the show &quot;Frasier&quot;.

===Accolades===
The role of Sam Malone earned Ted Danson two Emmy Awards as the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series: one in 1990 and another in 1993. It also earned Danson two Golden Globe Awards as the Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy Series: one in 1990 and another in 1991. Danson was awarded an American Comedy Award as the Funniest Male Performer in a TV Series.

<text>Anthony LaPaglia (, ; born 31 January 1959) is an Australian actor. He has won three AACTA Awards, Best Actor in a Leading Role for &quot;Lantana&quot; (2001) and &quot;Balibo&quot; (2009), and Best Actor in a Supporting Role for &quot;Nitram&quot; (2021).

For his starring role as Jack Malone on the American television crime drama series &quot;Without a Trace&quot; (2002–09), he received a Golden Globe Award in 2004. LaPaglia won a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play for his portrayal of Eddie Carbone in the 1997 Broadway revival of &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;, and a Primetime Emmy Award for his role as Simon Moon on the television sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot; (2000–04).

He has also appeared in films such as &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1990), &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; (1993), &quot;Empire Records&quot; (1995), &quot;Autumn in New York&quot; (2000), &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006) and its sequel &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; (2011), &quot;Mental&quot; (2012), &quot;Holding the Man&quot; (2015), and &quot;&quot; (2017).

== Early life and education ==
LaPaglia was born in Adelaide, South Australia, the son of Maria Johannes (née Brendel), a secretary and model, and Egidio &quot;Eddie&quot; LaPaglia (deceased), an auto mechanic and car dealer. LaPaglia&#x27;s mother was Dutch, and his father emigrated from Bovalino, Calabria, Italy, at the age of eighteen. His younger brother, Jonathan LaPaglia, is also an actor, and his other brother, Michael, is a car wholesaler in Los Angeles. LaPaglia attended Rostrevor College and Norwood High School.

LaPaglia was working in Adelaide as a shoe salesman for Florsheim Shoes in the early 1980s. He asked to be transferred to the US and continued working there while studying acting as he was rejected by the prestigious Sydney drama school NIDA. LaPaglia first began his venture into dramatic art in his late teens, when he enrolled in an acting course at the South Australian Castings Agency (SA Castings) in Adelaide. The two-and-half-year course was to be supplemented with a further three months, which would have included a &quot;boot camp&quot; and a trial listing with SA Castings. After completing one-and-a-half years of the course, LaPaglia left Adelaide for Los Angeles.

==Career==
LaPaglia&#x27;s earliest credit was a 1985 part in an episode of the television series &quot;Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Amazing Stories&quot;. His first feature film was &quot;Cold Steel&quot; in 1987, followed that same year by the title role of Frank Nitti in the telemovie &quot;Nitti: The Enforcer&quot;. LaPaglia had a supporting role as a mobster in the minor hit &quot;Betsy&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1990).

He starred alongside Danny Aiello and Lainie Kazan in &quot;29th Street&quot;, a fact-based comedy/bio-pic, as the first New York State Lottery winner, Frank Pesce Jr. This was followed by roles in the vampire/Mafia story &quot;Innocent Blood&quot; (1992), the comedy thriller &quot;So I Married an Axe Murderer&quot; (1993), the legal thriller &quot;The Client&quot; (1994), and the comedy &quot;Empire Records&quot; (1995). LaPaglia appeared in the role of Jimmy Wyler, lead character in the TV series &quot;Murder One&quot;, during its second and final season. LaPaglia made his debut in an Australian production opposite Hugo Weaving in &quot;The Custodian&quot; (1993). He played a hit man in &quot;Bulletproof Heart&quot; (1994) with Mimi Rogers and starred alongside future wife Gia Carides in the romantic comedy &quot;Paperback Romance&quot; (1994).

During 1997–98, LaPaglia appeared in a Broadway production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; with the Roundabout Theatre Company and later received a Tony Award for his portrayal of the protagonist, Eddie Carbone. LaPaglia also played Tito Merelli in Ken Ludwig&#x27;s &quot;Lend Me a Tenor&quot; on Broadway. Before &quot;A View From the Bridge&quot; opened, LaPaglia was sent a script for the pilot of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and met its creator, David Chase, to discuss the role of protagonist Tony Soprano. However, various factors, including Fox and his Broadway role, prevented LaPaglia from obtaining the role.

Spike Lee cast LaPaglia as a New York police detective in &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; (1999). During 2000–04, LaPaglia appeared in eight episodes of the sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, including the finale, playing Daphne Moon&#x27;s brother Simon. The role won him an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series&quot;.

He continued to live mainly in Los Angeles, returning occasionally—especially from about 2000—for roles in major Australian films such as &quot;Looking for Alibrandi&quot; (2000), &quot;Lantana&quot; (2001), &quot;The Bank&quot; (2001), &quot;Happy Feet&quot; (2006), &quot;$9.99&quot; (2008), &quot;Balibo&quot; (2009), and &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; (2011). In 2002, LaPaglia co-starred as a fire captain opposite Sigourney Weaver in &quot;The Guys&quot;, a film about New York firemen who died in the World Trade Center. He also played the role onstage, rotating with Bill Murray and others. &quot;We did it as a tribute to the men,&quot; said LaPaglia. &quot;I&#x27;ve been so lucky to do it, to be part of this experience. But I can&#x27;t go back to that morning or watch the video. It&#x27;s too painful.&quot; He also played fictional Australian actor Anthony Bella (who played Nicky Caesar in the fictitious series &quot;Little Caesar&quot;) in the comedy movie &quot;Analyze That&quot;, but was uncredited in his role.

In addition to playing the central character in &quot;Without a Trace&quot; during 2002–09, LaPaglia co-wrote an episode entitled &quot;Deep Water&quot;. In 2009, LaPaglia played the part of Roger East, a real-life Australian journalist, in the political thriller &quot;Balibo&quot;, about the killing in 1975 of five Australian journalists by the Indonesian Army in the town of Balibo, East Timor. The opening scene depicts East&#x27;s own summary execution, during the Indonesian invasion.

LaPaglia was originally cast in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s new film &quot;Django Unchained&quot;, but eventually left the project, calling the production &quot;out of control.&quot;

In 2012 LaPaglia starred in the ABC drama pilot &quot;Americana&quot;, but it was not picked up. He next appeared in the feature adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;A Good Marriage&quot; with Joan Allen. In 2014, LaPaglia appeared in a CBS terrorism drama pilot titled &quot;Red Zone&quot; starring as a retired CIA operative and current high school football coach who returns to active duty after a terrorist attack in Washington, D.C. It was renamed &quot;Field of Play&quot; but never aired.

From about 2012, LaPaglia began accepting work in Australia more frequently. Following major roles in &quot;&quot; (2012) (a biopic about Julian Assange) and the comedy &quot;Mental&quot; (2012), LaPaglia had a supporting role in the Neil Armfield&#x27;s Australian romantic-drama film &quot;Holding the Man&quot;, as Bob Caleo. The 2015 film stars Ryan Corr and Craig Stott, with supporting performances from LaPaglia, Guy Pearce and Geoffrey Rush. &quot;Holding the Man&quot; was adapted from Timothy Conigrave&#x27;s 1995 memoir of the same name. For his role within the film, LaPaglia was nominated for an AACTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role at the 5th AACTA Awards in 2015. In that year LaPaglia returned to his home city, Adelaide, to star in &quot;A Month of Sundays&quot; as Frank, a miserable real estate agent who finds solace and redemption in a chance friendship with an elderly woman (played by Julia Blake) who reminds him of his mother. In 2016 he appeared in his first Australian TV series: &quot;The Code&quot;, a political thriller set against rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China. The following year he starred in the four-part miniseries &quot;Sunshine&quot;, an Australian crime drama series screened on SBS, set in the western Melbourne suburb of the same name, playing the role of mentor to a promising young Sudanese-Australian soccer player. The four-part miniseries is an Essential Media production, directed by Daina Reid and written by Matt Cameron and Elise McCredie. In 2018, LaPaglia appeared in the fifth season of the comedy &quot;Rake&quot;, based loosely on the life and misadventures of Charles Waterstreet.

In 2017, LaPaglia played Vito Rizzuto in the Simon Barry Canadian TV series &quot;Bad Blood&quot;, which aired on Citytv, in French on ICI Radio-Canada. From 2017 to 2020, he starred in Neil Jordan&#x27;s series &quot;Riviera&quot;. Set in the French Riviera, the series follows Georgina Clios, a midwestern art curator whose life is turned upside down after the death of her billionaire husband Constantine Clios (LaPaglia) in a yacht accident. Georgina becomes immersed in a world of lies, double-dealing and crime, as she seeks to uncover the truth about her husband&#x27;s death.

In 2023 LaPaglia appeared in the ABC TV series &quot;The Black Hand&quot;, which explores the activities of the Italian &#x27;Ndrangheta in the cane fields of Queensland, Australia, in the 1920s and 1930s. The same year, he appeared in his Australian stage debut as Willy Loman in Arthur Miller&#x27;s play &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne, directed by Neil Armfield.

==Personal life==
LaPaglia currently lives in Santa Monica, California. He has said that he adopted an American accent to help him get acting work after moving to the US. His current accent is neither distinctly American nor is it Australian, but, rather, a combination of both. According to an offhand remark by LaPaglia, he has employed an American accent since 1982. LaPaglia is the godfather of Poppy Montgomery and Adam Kaufman&#x27;s son, Jackson. LaPaglia&#x27;s first marriage was to actress Cherie Michan. His second marriage was to actress Gia Carides, whom he met at a party; the two starred in the 1994 Australian movie &quot;Paperback Romance&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Lucky Break&quot;) and married in 1998. Their daughter Bridget was born in January 2003. In April 2015, newspapers reported that LaPaglia and Carides had split after 17 years. He married Alexandra Henkel (his third marriage), who is 30 years younger, on 28 April 2018.

===Life in soccer===
In the 1980s, LaPaglia was a goalkeeper in the National Soccer League, playing for Adelaide City and West Adelaide. LaPaglia was part owner of A-League club Sydney FC until 2008; flying from California to Sydney to attend their matches since their inception in 2005. He was the narrator and executive producer of &quot;The Away Game&quot;, a critically acclaimed television documentary exploring the experiences of Australian men&#x27;s soccer players in Europe.

He plays occasionally with Hollywood United, an amateur organisation of which he is club president, with others in the entertainment industry including Frank Leboeuf, Vinnie Jones, Steve Jones (of the Sex Pistols) and others.

LaPaglia has a minority shareholding in the International Goalkeepers Academy. The Academy was founded and is operated by James Fraser, who represented the Australian national team leading up to the 1974 FIFA World Cup.

LaPaglia has volunteered as an actor with the Young Storytellers Program. He played in a charity soccer match in 2007 to raise funds for Southern California wildfire relief.

<text>Gwendolen Mary John (22 June 1876 – 18 September 1939) was a Welsh artist who worked in France for most of her career. Her paintings, mainly portraits of anonymous female sitters, are rendered in a range of closely related tones. Although in her lifetime, John&#x27;s work was overshadowed by that of her brother Augustus and her mentor and lover Auguste Rodin, awareness and esteem for John&#x27;s artistic contributions has grown considerably since her death.

== Early life ==

Gwen John was born in Haverfordwest, Wales, the second of four children of Edwin William John and his wife Augusta, née Smith (1848–1884). Augusta came from a long line of Sussex master plumbers. Gwen&#x27;s elder brother was Thornton John; her younger siblings were Augustus and Winifred. Edwin John was a solicitor whose dour temperament cast a chill over his family, and Augusta was often absent from the children owing to ill health, leaving her two sisters—stern Salvationists—to take her place in the household. Augusta was an amateur watercolor painter, and both parents encouraged the children&#x27;s interest in literature and art.

Her mother died when Gwen was eight years old. Regarding her mother&#x27;s death and the loss of her influence, John&#x27;s brother Augustus later wrote: &quot;My mother would no doubt have been helpful, but she died when I was a small child, after, I fear, a very tearful existence.&quot;

Following their mother&#x27;s premature death in 1884, the family moved to Tenby in Pembrokeshire, Wales, where governesses provided the early education of Gwen and her sister Winifred. The siblings often went to the coast of Tenby to sketch. John said that she would make &quot;rapid drawings of beached gulls, shells and fish on stray pieces of paper, or sometimes in the frontispiece of the book she was reading.&quot; Although John painted and drew from an early age, her earliest surviving work was made at age 19.

==Education==
From 1895 to 1898, John studied at the Slade School of Art, where the program was modelled after the French atelier method with various levels of student working under a master artist. It was the only art school in the United Kingdom that allowed female students, although there was generally no mixing of men and women on the grounds, in classes, or in corridors. Like her younger brother, Augustus, who was enrolled there starting in 1894, John studied figure drawing under Henry Tonks. During this period, she and Augustus shared living quarters, and further reduced their expenses by subsisting on a diet of nuts and fruit. She developed a close relationship with the woman who would become her brother&#x27;s wife, Ida Nettleship. At this time, she also had a relationship with another of her brother&#x27;s friends, Ambrose McEvoy, which turned out to be an unhappy one. Good friends also included Ursula Tyrwhitt and Gwen Salmond. John won the Melvill Nettleship Prize for Figure Composition in her final year at Slade.

Slade students were encouraged to copy the works of old masters in London museums. John&#x27;s early paintings such as &quot;Portrait of Mrs. Atkinson&quot;, &quot;Young Woman with a Violin&quot; and &quot;Interior with Figures&quot; are intimist works painted in a traditional style characterised by subdued colour and transparent glazes. Even as a student, Augustus&#x27;s brilliant draughtsmanship and personal glamour made him a celebrity, and stood in contrast to Gwen&#x27;s quieter gifts and reticent demeanour. Augustus greatly admired his sister&#x27;s work but believed she neglected her health, and he urged her to take a &quot;more athletic attitude to life&quot;. She refused his advice, and demonstrated throughout her life a marked disregard for her physical well-being.

In 1898 she made her first visit to Paris with two friends from the Slade, and while there she studied under James McNeill Whistler at his school, Académie Carmen. She returned to London in 1899 and exhibited her work for the first time in 1900, at the New English Art Club (NEAC). With Arthur Ambrose McEvoy becoming engaged to Mary Edwards at the end of 1900, &quot;an awkward period ensued with Gwen living at the McEvoy family home in Bayswater&quot;, where &quot;she had continued living&quot;, &quot;while Ambrose and Mary moved down to Shrivenham in Oxfordshire&quot; in around 1903.

==France and early career==
In late 1903, she travelled to France with her friend Dorelia McNeill (who would later become Augustus John&#x27;s second wife and whose daughter, Vivien John, would also become an artist). Upon landing in Bordeaux, they set off on a walking tour with their art equipment in hand, intending to reach Rome. Sleeping in fields and living on money earned along the way by selling portrait sketches, they made it as far as Toulouse.

In 1904, the two went to Paris, where John found work as an artist&#x27;s model, mostly for women artists. In that same year, she began modelling for the sculptor Auguste Rodin, and became his lover after being introduced by Hilda Flodin. Rodin used John as a model for a muse in his unfinished monument to Whistler. Her devotion to Rodin, the most famous artist of his time, who was 35 years older than her, continued unabated for the next ten years, as documented in her thousands of fervent letters to him. John was given to fierce attachments to both men and women that were sometimes disturbing to them, and Rodin, despite his genuine feeling for her, eventually resorted to the use of concièrges and secretaries to keep her at a distance.

During her years in Paris, she met many of the leading artistic personalities of her time, including Matisse, Picasso, Brâncuși, and Rainer Maria Rilke, but the new developments in the art of her time had little effect on her, and she worked in solitude. In 1910 she found living quarters in Meudon, a suburb of Paris where she would remain for the rest of her life. As her affair with Rodin drew to a close, John sought comfort in Catholicism, and around 1913 she was received into the Church. Her notebooks of the period include meditations and prayers; she wrote of her desire to be &quot;God&#x27;s little artist&quot; and to &quot;become a saint&quot;. In an often-quoted letter of c. 1912, she wrote: &quot;As to whether I have anything worth expressing that is apart from the question. I may never have anything to express, except this desire for a more interior life&quot;.

==Career==

John stopped exhibiting at the NEAC in 1911, but gained an important patron in John Quinn, an American art collector who, from 1910 until his death in 1924, purchased the majority of the works that Gwen John sold. Quinn&#x27;s support freed John from having to work as a model, and enabled her to devote herself to her work. Although she participated in exhibitions fairly regularly, her perfectionism produced in her a marked ambivalence toward exhibiting. She wrote in 1911: &quot;I paint a good deal, but I don&#x27;t often get a picture done—that requires, for me, a very long time of a quiet mind, and never to think of exhibitions&quot;. In 1913, one of her paintings was included in the seminal Armory Show in New York, which Quinn assisted in organising.

Her attitude toward her work was both self-effacing and confident. After viewing an exhibition of watercolours by Cézanne she remarked: &quot;These are very good, but I prefer my own.&quot;

About 1913, as an obligation to the Dominican Sisters of Charity at Meudon, she began a series of painted portraits of Mère Marie Poussepin (1653–1744), the founder of their order. These paintings, based on a prayer card, established a format—the female figure in three-quarter length seated pose—which became characteristic of her mature style. She painted numerous variants on such subjects as &quot;Young Woman in a Spotted Blue Dress&quot;, &quot;Girl Holding a Cat&quot; and &quot;The Convalescent&quot;. The identities of most of her models are unknown.

In Meudon John lived in solitude, except for her cats. In an undated letter she wrote, &quot;I should like to go and live somewhere where I met nobody I know till I am so strong that people and things could not effect me beyond reason&quot;. She wished also to avoid family ties (&quot;I think the family has had its day. We don&#x27;t go to Heaven in families now but one by one&quot;) and her decision to live in France after 1903 may have been the result of her desire to escape the overpowering personality of her famous brother, although, according to the art historian David Fraser Jenkins, &quot;there were few occasions when she did anything against her will, and she was the more ruthless and dominating of the two&quot;.

John exhibited in Paris for the first time in 1919 at the Salon d&#x27;Automne, and exhibited regularly until the mid-1920s, after which time she became increasingly reclusive and painted less. She had only one solo exhibition in her lifetime, at the New Chenil Galleries in London in 1926. In that same year she purchased a bungalow in Meudon. In December 1926, distraught after the death of her old friend Rilke, she met and sought religious guidance from her neighbour, the neo-Thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain. She also met Maritain&#x27;s sister-in-law, Véra Oumançoff, with whom she formed her last romantic relationship, which lasted until 1930.

John&#x27;s last dated work is a drawing of 20 March 1933, and no evidence suggests that she drew or painted during the remainder of her life. On 10 September 1939, she wrote her will and then travelled to Dieppe, where she collapsed and was hospitalised. She died there on 18 September 1939 and was buried in Janval Cemetery. According to Paul Johnson in &quot;Art: A New History&quot;, &quot;she appears to have starved to death&#x27;&quot;.

== Artistic approach ==
In 1916, John wrote in a letter: &quot;I think a picture ought to be done in 1 sitting or at most 2. For that one must paint a lot of canvases probably and waste them.&quot; Her surviving oeuvre is comparatively small, comprising 158 known oil paintings which rarely exceed 24 inches in height or width. The majority are portraits, but she also painted still life compositions, interiors and a few landscapes. John wrote, &quot;...a cat or a man, its the same thing ... its an affair of volumes ... the object is of no importance.&quot;

Her early paintings, such as the &quot;Portrait of the Artist&#x27;s Sister Winifred&quot; (c. 1897–1898) and &quot;Dorelia in a Black Dress&quot; (1903–1904), are painted using thin glazes in the traditional manner of the old masters. Beginning with her series of paintings of Mère Poussepin (c. 1913), her style is characterised by thicker paint applied in small, mosaic-like touches. It became her habit to paint the same subject repeatedly. Her portraits are usually of anonymous female sitters seated in a three-quarter length format, with their hands in their laps. One of her models, Jeanne Foster, wrote of John: &quot;She takes down my hair and does it like her own ... she has me sit as she does, and I feel the absorption of her personality as I sit&quot;.

John created thousands of drawings. In addition to studio work, she made many sketches and watercolours of women and children in church. Unlike her oil paintings of solitary women, these sketches frequently depict subjects from behind and in groups. John also made many sketches of her cats. Daringly for a female artist of the era, she made two nude drawings of herself. She created few prints and only two etchings made in 1910 exist.

John&#x27;s notebooks and letters contain personal formulae for observing nature, painting a portrait, designating colours by a system of numbers, and the like. Their meaning is often obscure, but they reveal John&#x27;s predilection for order and the lasting influence of Whistler, whose teaching emphasised systematic preparation.

Gwen John&#x27;s art, in its quietude and its subtle colour relationships, stands in contrast to her brother&#x27;s far more vivid and assertive work. Though she was once overshadowed by her popular brother, critical opinion now tends to view Gwen as the more talented of the two. Augustus himself had predicted this reversal, saying &quot;In 50 years&#x27; time I will be known as the brother of Gwen John.&quot;

==Sexuality==
Throughout her life, John was attracted to people of both sexes. As a student, she had an affair with her fellow artist Ambrose McEvoy. Although Auguste Rodin was her great love, she had a number of same-sex relationships. While at the Slade she developed a passion for an unnamed woman, which her brother Augustus describes in his autobiography &quot;Chiaroscuro&quot;, and while walking to Paris with Dorelia McNeill, she developed a passion for a married girl, who then followed them to Paris. It has been suggested that Gwen John had romantic feelings for McNeill. Rodin, who had a sexual relationship with his assistant Hilda Flodin, drew erotic drawings of Flodin and John together. The German painter Ida Gerhardi fell in love with John but it was not reciprocated. John&#x27;s last passion was Véra Oumançoff, for whom she developed an obsession, much to Oumançoff&#x27;s discomfort.

== Legacy ==
John&#x27;s pictures are held in many public collections. Some of the best examples are in National Museum Cardiff and in Tate Britain, London.

&quot;Still Lives&quot;, by Candida Cave, is a four-person play written in 1969 about Augustus John, Gwen John, Ida John (Augustus John&#x27;s wife) and Dorelia McNeill (Augustus John&#x27;s mistress).

An art mystery novel &quot;The Gwen John Sculpture&quot; (1985), by John Andrews, writing as John Malcolm, features her stay in Meudon and her relationship with Rodin.

Margaret Forster wrote a novel, published 2006, &quot;Keeping the World Away&quot;, centred upon a picture by John, &quot;A Corner of the Artist&#x27;s Room in Paris&quot;, which starts with the story of John herself and then follows stories of fictional women who subsequently owned it and responded to it. The title comes from something written by John: &quot;Rules to Keep the World away: Do not listen to people (more than is necessary); Do not look at people (ditto); Have as little intercourse with people as possible; When you come into contact with people, talk as little a possible ...&quot;

An S4C documentary presented by Ffion Hague about Gwen John&#x27;s life included filming of the unveiling of a memorial plaque to the artist in Dieppe&#x27;s Janval Cemetery in 2015.

John was the aunt of the cellist Amaryllis Fleming, her brother&#x27;s illegitimate daughter with his other mistress Evelyn Fleming, whose husband Valentine was a Member of Parliament. Other nephews and nieces included Sir Caspar, Vivien, Tristan de Vere Cole and Gwyneth Johnstone. Cole and Johnstone were also born from Augustus&#x27;s other relationships.

<doc id="655152" wikidata="Q6135999" url="?curid=655152" title="Jim McLay">
<text>Sir James Kenneth McLay (born 21 February 1945) is a New Zealand diplomat and former politician. He served as the ninth deputy prime minister of New Zealand from 15 March to 26 July 1984. McLay was also Leader of the National Party and Leader of the Opposition from 29 November 1984 to 26 March 1986. Following his ousting as party leader, he retired from parliamentary politics in 1987. In June 2009, he became New Zealand&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations. In May 2015, McLay became New Zealand&#x27;s Representative to the Palestinian Authority. From May 2016 to January 2017, he was New Zealand&#x27;s Consul General in Honolulu.

==Early life==
McLay was born in Devonport, Auckland, the son of Robert and Joyce McLay. Peter Wilkinson was his half-brother. He was educated at King&#x27;s College, Auckland and the University of Auckland, gaining a law degree in 1967. He worked as a lawyer for some time, and also became involved in a number of law associations. In 1983 he married Marcy Farden, who was an assistant to American congressman Daniel Akaka.

==Member of Parliament==


McLay had joined the National Party in 1963, and held a number of prominent positions within the party&#x27;s Auckland branch. He also served on the party&#x27;s national council. In the 1975 election, he stood as the National Party&#x27;s candidate for the Birkenhead electorate, and defeated the incumbent Labour MP, Norman King, amid the massive landslide that brought National to power. King had been the local MP for 21 years and McLay&#x27;s win was seen as a surprise result.

===Cabinet Minister===

In Parliament, McLay was known as one of the more liberal members of the National Party, and had a particular focus on reforming laws that related to women&#x27;s rights. In 1978, Prime Minister Robert Muldoon appointed McLay to the posts of Attorney General and Minister of Justice.

In October and November 1980 McLay was a leading member of &#x27;the Colonels&#x27; (alongside Derek Quigley, Jim Bolger and George Gair) who attempted to oust Muldoon as leader. In what became known as the Colonels&#x27; Coup after its originators it intended to supplant Muldoon with his deputy, Brian Talboys, who was more economically liberal and in tune with traditional National Party philosophy than Muldoon. The Colonels waited until Muldoon was out of the country before moving against him. However, Talboys was reluctant to challenge and the ploy failed with Muldoon remaining leader.

===Deputy Prime Minister===
In early 1984, following the retirement of Duncan MacIntyre, McLay became deputy leader of the National Party, and thus Deputy Prime Minister. He defeated fellow cabinet ministers Jim Bolger and Bill Birch for the position, receiving a majority in the first caucus ballot. His elevation to the deputy leadership was thought to be a reflection of his youth and stance as a social and economic liberal which was seen as key at the time to blunt the growth of the incipient New Zealand Party which was making serious inroads among National&#x27;s traditional support base. Likewise it placed him as the most likely person to inevitably replace Muldoon as leader.

===Leader of the Opposition===

When National lost the 1984 election, there was widespread desire in the party for a leadership change. This desire came mainly from the younger and less conservative wing of the party, which saw Robert Muldoon as representing an era that had already passed. Muldoon, however, refused to leave the position voluntarily, thereby forcing a direct leadership challenge. The two main candidates in the leadership race (apart from Muldoon himself) were Jim McLay and Jim Bolger. McLay, in distinct contrast to Muldoon, promoted free market economic policies and a relatively liberal social outlook. Bolger, meanwhile, was seen as a more traditionalist and pragmatic candidate but less conservative as Muldoon. McLay won the caucus vote with slightly over half the votes.

McLay&#x27;s first major challenge was Muldoon himself. On his defeat, Muldoon refused to accept any portfolios offered him, thereby becoming a backbencher. McLay&#x27;s attempts to give Muldoon an &quot;elder statesman&quot; role within the party were rebuffed, with Muldoon insisting on an active role. The relationship between McLay and Muldoon deteriorated further, as McLay outlined a major departure from Muldoon&#x27;s interventionist economic policies. Muldoon&#x27;s hostility was to prove a major problem for McLay&#x27;s leadership, and undermined all attempts to promote unity within the party. Later, when Muldoon made a strong public criticism of the entire party leadership, Muldoon (along with loyalist Merv Wellington) was demoted to the lowest ranking within the National caucus.

Muldoon, apparently realising that there was little chance of him regaining the leadership, threw his support behind Bolger, who remained opposed to McLay. There was considerable media speculation that McLay would be deposed before the end of 1985. The rumoured challenge, however, failed to happen, and McLay remained leader. In early 1986, however, McLay made a fatal mistake: in an attempt to &quot;rejuvenate&quot; the party&#x27;s upper ranks, he demoted George Gair and Bill Birch, both of whom were highly respected for their long service.

Gair and Birch had earlier been opponents of McLay&#x27;s in the 1984 leadership election before they withdrew. Both of them, who were among National&#x27;s most experienced politicians, quickly allied themselves with Bolger. From then on, McLay&#x27;s fall was almost guaranteed.

===Ousting===
On 26 March, Gair, Birch, and party whip Don McKinnon presented McLay with a letter signed by a majority of MPs in the National Party caucus asking him to step aside. McLay then agreed to hold a leadership election, with himself and his deputy, Bolger, as contenders. Bolger received a clear majority in the resulting caucus vote, ending McLay&#x27;s leadership of the National Party. As a concession to McLay, Bolger appointed him as Shadow Minister of Justice and Shadow Attorney-General, but gave him the relatively low caucus rank of 10th (below Muldoon at eighth). This prompted him to retire at the .

McLay was the first full-time National Party leader, and one of three overall (the others being Simon Bridges and Todd Muller) who left office without becoming Prime Minister or taking the party into an election.

==After Parliament==
McLay retired from Parliament at the 1987 election. Between 1994 and 2002 he was the New Zealand representative on the International Whaling Commission. He served as chairman of the New Zealand Council for Infrastructure Development, an independent industry body which advances best practice in infrastructure development, investment and procurement, from 2005 to 2006 and remained as patron until 2009.

===Permanent Representative to the United Nations===
In July 2009 McLay took up the role of New Zealand&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations. On 16 October 2014, McLay led New Zealand to victory in the United Nations Security Council election for a temporary seat on the United Nations Security Council winning in the first round of voting with 145 votes out of a possible 193 beating both Spain and Turkey. McLay took up New Zealand&#x27;s seat on the United Nations Security Council on 1 January 2015.

===Representative to the Palestinian Authority===
On 20 February 2015, it was announced that McLay is to finish his role as Permanent Representative after the end of his second term. McLay is set to become New Zealand&#x27;s Representative to the Palestinian Authority, as well as being a special advisor to Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully and, when required, a Prime Ministerial special envoy.

==Honours and awards==

In 1977, McLay was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In 1993, he was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

In the 1987 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, McLay was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services.

<text>Laura Elizabeth Campbell (born 24 May 1953), better known as Nell Campbell or by her stage name Little Nell, is an Australian actress, singer, and former club owner. She is best known for her role as Columbia in the 1975 film &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, and the original stage play from which it was adapted. Campbell released her EP, &quot;The Musical World of Little Nell (Aquatic Teenage Sex &amp; Squalor)&quot;, through A&amp;M Records in 1978. She appeared as Nurse Ansalong in the 1981 film &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;. In 1984, she appeared as Beth in the BAFTA and Oscar-award-winning drama film &quot;The Killing Fields&quot;.

==Early life==
Campbell was born in Sydney, to Ruth and Ross Campbell. Ross, a writer, referred to her as &quot;Little Nell&quot; (after a character in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot;) in his family life column in the &quot;Sydney Daily Telegraph&quot;. She grew up with three siblings: Sally, Patrick, and Cressida. Elder sister Sally was a property master, a set designer, and (subsequently) a fashion designer; younger sister Cressida Campbell is an artist; elder brother Patrick (who died in 2020) was a solar engineer at the University of New South Wales. Nell began dancing when she was 10, in order to remain healthy following being diagnosed with hepatitis A. She was called Laura E. Campbell until the age of about 17, when she went by the nickname &quot;Sonny&quot; (pronounced to rhyme with &quot;Donny&quot;), short for &quot;Sonata&quot;. She attended high school at Abbotsleigh School for Girls in Sydney, supporting herself as a waitress.

==Career==
Campbell decided to use the name &quot;Little Nell&quot; as a stage name after her arrival in Britain in the early 1970s with her family. She sold clothes at Kensington Market; her stall was next to Freddie Mercury&#x27;s. She also worked as a busker and as a soda jerk in a café, where her tap dancing is often noted as the reason why she was cast as Columbia in the original production of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; following an impromptu audition. She reprised the role in &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, released in 1975, and starred as Nurse Ansalong in the 1981 sequel, &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;.

After &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;, Campbell signed a recording contract with A&amp;M Records. Her debut single was &quot;Stilettos and Lipstick&quot; backed with &quot;Do the Swim&quot;, released in 1975. She also recorded a disco version of the song &quot;Fever&quot; in 1978, which was again backed with &quot;Do the Swim&quot;. The B-side of both of these releases became better-known, perhaps helped by a performance on British television in which she accidentally (and repeatedly) exposed her breasts. While edited out of the original broadcast in 1975, the unedited version was shown worldwide on bloopers shows (beginning with the British show &quot;It&#x27;ll be Alright on the Night&quot; in 1977). Following this notoriety, another effort was made to promote the recordings made in 1975 and 1976. In 1978, a &quot;triple B-side&quot; extended play titled &quot;The Musical World of Little Nell (Aquatic Teenage Sex &amp; Squalor)&quot; was released which featured both &quot;Do the Swim&quot; and &quot;Stillettos and Lipstick&quot; along with the track &quot;Dance that Cocktail Latin Way&quot; (also known as &quot;Tropical Isle&quot;) which originally appeared as the B-side of her second single from 1976. Following some success with the EP, the other two tracks, singles &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;See You Round like a Record&quot;, were released as a single but that was to be her last release on A&amp;M. A final single, &quot;Beauty Queen&quot; from the film &quot;The Alternative Miss World&quot;, was released on PRE Records in 1980.

Campbell has also appeared in several stage productions, including the Off-Broadway play &quot;You Should Be So Lucky&quot; and the Broadway musical &quot;Nine&quot;. She appeared as Sandra LeMon in the British TV series &quot;Rock Follies of &#x27;77&quot;.

In 1986, Campbell opened the nightclub Nell&#x27;s on West 14th Street in Manhattan (New York) with Keith McNally and Lynn Wagenknecht. In 1995 she opened two restaurants in New York: The Kiosk (uptown) and E&amp;O (downtown). Nell&#x27;s was sold in 1998 to Noel Ashman and his business partner, actor Chris Noth, right before Campbell gave birth to her daughter, Matilda Violet, with ex-boyfriend and business partner, Eamon Roche. The club closed in 2004.

Campbell has written several magazine articles, including regular segments called &quot;MamaTalks&quot; and &quot;FirstLook&quot; in the now defunct Talk magazine, starting in the December 1999 issue.

* Gornji Daruvar, population 436
* Lipovac Majur, population 83
* Ljudevit Selo, population 252
* Markovac, population 80
* Vrbovac, population 561

==Etymology==
Its name is a conjunction of the Hungarian words &quot;daru&quot; () and &quot;vár&quot; ().

==History==


Archaeological findings here of stone axes can be traced to the Stone Age. The history of Daruvar can be traced to the 4th century BC, when the first organized habitation developed near the warm geothermal spas in today&#x27;s Daruvar valley. Celtic - Pannonian tribes living here and familiar with water treatments benefiting health, were Iassi, (meaning &quot;healers&quot;), so called by both Greek and Roman writers.

As allies of the Roman Empire, the tribes provided support to Emperor Augustus during the siege of Siscia (today&#x27;s Sisak). In the year 35CE, Iassi were granted local autonomy known as &quot;Res Publica Iasorum&quot;. The center was Aquae Balissae, meaning &quot;very strong springs&quot;. 

In the year 124, during the reign of Hadrian, the area gained additional autonomy as Municipium Iassorum. Stretching between the rivers Sava and Drava, on the roads which ran between Siscia-Mursa, (Sisak- Osijek), Salona–Aquincum, and Sirmium–Poetovio, the town was easy to access. After Hadrian, emperors Marcus Aurelius, Commodus, Septimius Severus, and Constantine I all visited Aquae Balissae&#x27;s thermal complex, its decorated temple, its forum, and its amphitheatre (although it was smaller than the one in Pula). 

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the destruction of local tribes by Avar Kaghanate in 6th century, this area was resettled by Croats, a Slavic tribe that reached the Balkans in 7th century.

In the 11th century the region became part of a mightier entity, that of Križevci, a rapidly growing and politically important city. It became part of the archdiocese of Zagreb mentioned by legislators for the first time in 1334. 

Since the city was on a busy crossroads, there were four trading points within the valley — Četvrtkovac, Dimičkovine, Podborje, and Toplice (&quot;toplice&quot; = &quot;spas&quot; in Croatian). For more than a millennium, the spas continued to attract people as a destination. The population in that period was exclusively Catholic.

In the 15th and 16th centuries, all that changed. Expansion of the Ottoman Empire disrupted the steady development, and Turks occupied lands here in 1543. The Monastery of &quot;St King Ladislaus&quot; was degraded, becoming a Turkish defensive post looking into the &quot;Krajina&quot;, a military zone created to protect the Habsburg Empire just west of the city. Local people fled from Turks.

In 1699 the Habsburg Empire expelled the Turks. The ethnically mixed area came under the rule of Vienna in 1745. Podborje, Sirač, and Pakrac were bought by count Antun Janković, who in 1771 renamed Podborje as Daruvar, (&quot;daru&quot; = &quot;crane&quot; in Hungarian), after a building of his called the Crane&#x27;s castle. 

In 1837 Daruvar was declared a free city by decree of king Ferdinand I. The monarch&#x27;s government recruited migrant farmers from southern Bavaria and other areas to repopulate the area and re-establish agriculture in the Danube River valley. They also recruited people skilled in crafts and trade. Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Italians (around so called Little Italy), and others were invited to come. The government promised that they could practice their own religions (most were Catholic) nd languages. 

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Daruvar was part of the Požega County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Parts of Daruvar&#x27;s suburbs were briefly captured by militants from the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Western Slavonia during the Croatian War of Independence.

==Climate==


==Demographics==
According to the census of 2011, the population of the Daruvar municipality (township) was 11,633. In ethnic terms, 61.28% are Croats, 21.36% Czechs, 12.28% Serbs, and 0.98% Hungarians. As for the religion, 75.49% are Catholics, 10.23% Orthodox, and 7.62% are agnostics and atheists.

The Czech population is of significant size having its own newspaper, schools, societies and clubs (&quot;Česká beseda&quot; or &#x27;Czech word&#x27;, &quot;Jednota&quot; or &#x27;Unity&#x27; in Czech), and publishing company. The entire area (Veliki Zdenci, Grubišno Polje, Končanica), is actually bilingual with Czech being the second official language. There are numerous local ethnic festivities celebrating important points in different cultures — youth, harvest etc. with the most interesting and picturesque that of the Czech minority.

==Politics==
===Minority councils and representatives===

Directly elected minority councils and representatives are tasked with consulting tasks for the local or regional authorities in which they are advocating for minority rights and interests, integration into public life and participation in the management of local affairs. At the 2023 Croatian national minorities councils and representatives elections Czechs and Serbs of Croatia each fulfilled legal requirements to each elect their own 15 members minority council of the City of Daruvar while Hungarians were electing individual representative.

==Spas==

Water treatments benefiting health were well known to mentioned Iassi tribes here almost 2,500 years ago, later widely used by Romans and in the Middle Ages. In 1772 the owner of the area Antun Janković started building around the springs, envisioning correctly that the town might become a healing, leisure, and recreation center again as it was through the course of history. He erected numerous buildings, many of them still functional (&quot;Anton&#x27;s spa&quot;, &quot;Ivan&#x27;s spa&quot;). After 1897 the newly opened railroad brought new visitors. Restaurant &quot;Teresa&quot;, &quot;Swiss villa&quot;, &quot;Villa Arcadia&quot;, and &quot;Big Mud Spa&quot; with its prominent dome and today well known city mark were all built during the turn of 19 and 20th century.

Daruvarske Toplice is a special hospital complex for rehabilitation specializing in treatment of female fertility (primary and secondary sterility), with two clinics for esthetic surgery. Warm waters (33 to 47 °C) are also used in postoperative rehabilitation, treatment of inflammations, rheumatism, the trauma of bones, hips, head, spine, and locomotion. More spas are around Pakrac and Lipik, where there is also a mineral water bottling plant. The park within the complex is positioned containing 65 different kind of trees such as a 250-year-old Ginkgo tree from China, &quot;Variegatum&quot; from Arizona, and others. Hotel &quot;Termal&quot;, renovated and extended in 1996, is also here. A smaller hotel, &quot;Balisse&quot;, is a few minutes walking distance away in the traffic-friendly downtown.

==Tourism==
The area is rich in monuments. Historic &quot;Kistalovac&quot;, &quot;Pavlovina&quot;, &quot;Sirač&quot;, &quot;Bagenovać&quot;, &quot;Dobra Kuća&quot;, and &quot;Stupčanica&quot; are examples of numerous local castles belonging to the Croatian nobility of the times passed by. Franciscan monasteries like those of &quot;St. Margareth&quot;, &quot;St. Ana&quot;, &quot;St. Three Kings&quot;, and the Church of &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; are witnesses of the rich religious culture.

==Economy==

German people who came here in the 18th century as well as Czechs in the 19th were the keystone of the revival participating in agriculture, food processing plants, culture, and education. The development was accelerated at the turn of the century by being connected to the railroad track from Banova Jaruga to Barcs in Hungary. An important historic moment in 1897 was witnessed by the emperor Franz Joseph himself. Since 1840 a brewery is operating here producing today more than 250,000 hectoliters of beer based upon an old and famous Czech recipes, with &quot;Old Bohemian&quot; (&quot;Staročeško pivo&quot;) brand being the most known. &quot;Zdenka&quot; of Veliki Zdenci is well known for its milk and melted cheese processing plant.

Fish is cultivated in artificial lakes around Končanica and processed within &quot;Irida&quot;. Here are local high quality vines as Graševina (ranking the highest), Rhein Riesling, Chardonnay, and Sauvignon. Here fruit, maize, wheat, meat, and other agriculture products are produced for local, national, and wider markets. &quot;Dalit&quot;, created in 1905, is a metal processing plant, once one of the biggest in what was once Yugoslavia, employing today 320, but in the late 1970s almost 2,000 people. A flat glass factory is in Lipik. There are small graphics and printing (&quot;Daruvarska Tiskara d.d.&quot;, &quot;Logos&quot;) facilities and the textile plant &quot;Vesna&quot;, which employs around 200. Growing is the importance of trade, tourism, and communication. 2300 people are employed, one-third of them women.

==Education==
The first school was opened in 1856. A school for women was opened here in 1866.

<doc id="655183" wikidata="Q17078345" url="?curid=655183" title="Sphere-world">
<text>The idea of a sphere-world was constructed by French mathematician Henri Poincaré who, while pursuing his argument for conventionalism (see philosophy of space and time), offered a thought experiment about a sphere with strange properties.

==The concept==
Poincaré asks us to imagine a sphere of radius &quot;R&quot;. The temperature of the sphere decreases from its maximum at the center to absolute zero at its extremity such that a body’s temperature at a distance &quot;r&quot; from the center is proportional to formula_1.

In addition, all bodies have the same coefficient of dilatation so every body shrinks and expands in similar proportion as they move about the sphere. To finish the story, Poincaré states that the index of refraction will also vary with the distance &quot;r&quot;, in inverse proportion to formula_1.

How will this world look to inhabitants of this sphere? 

In many ways it will look &quot;normal&quot;. Bodies will remain intact upon transfer from place to place, as well as seeming to remain the same size (the Spherians would shrink along with them). The geometry, on the other hand, would seem quite different. Supposing the inhabitants were to view rods believed to be rigid, or measure distance with light rays. They would find that a geodesic is not a straight line, and that the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its radius is greater than formula_3.

These inhabitants would in fact determine that their universe is not ruled by Euclidean geometry, but instead by hyperbolic geometry.

==Commentary==

This thought experiment is discussed in Roberto Torretti&#x27;s book &quot;Philosophy of Geometry from Riemann to Poincaré&quot; and in Jeremy Gray&#x27;s article &quot;Epistemology of Geometry&quot; in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. This sphere-world is also described in Ian Stewart&#x27;s book &quot;Flatterland&quot; (chapter 10, Platterland).

<text>Felix Joseph Slade (6 August 1788 – 29 March 1868) was an English lawyer and collector of glass, books and prints.

A fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (1866) and a philanthropist who endowed three Slade Professorships of Fine Art at the University of Oxford and Cambridge University, and at University College London, where he also endowed scholarships which formed the beginning of the Slade School of Art (founded 1871) in London, whose Director holds the Slade Professorship. The bequest was also indirectly responsible for the foundation of the Ruskin School of Drawing in Oxford, which was financed by the first Oxford Professor, John Ruskin, who announced his intention in his inaugural lecture &quot;to the general dismay of his listeners&quot;.

The Oxford and Cambridge professorships are visiting ones, who give the Slade Lectures, one of the most prestigious series of lectures on the history of art, which are commonly published. The first Slade Professors were John Ruskin, at Oxford, and Matthew Digby Wyatt at Cambridge; Edward Poynter. gave the first lecture on 2 October 1871 at University College, London.

He was the son of Robert Slade, a Surrey landowner and proctor in Doctors&#x27; Commons, who eventually became deputy lieutenant for Surrey, and his wife Eliza Foxcroft of Halsteads (near Thornton-in-Lonsdale, Yorkshire). From his father he inherited a considerable fortune, which supported his purchases of books and prints. He lived with his bachelor brother Henry in the family house in Walcot Place (in the Kennington area of London) and built up a valuable collection of historical glass. When he died unmarried he left a fortune of £160,000 and bequeathed the bulk of his art collection to the British Museum; the books are now in the British Library. One of the features of the book collection includes twenty-five bindings from the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, representing English, French, and Italian styles. £35,000 was specified for the endowment of art professorships, to be known as Slade Professorships, at Oxford, Cambridge, and University College, London. University College received the additional bequest of six art scholarships for students, the nucleus of the Slade School of Art.

He meticulously catalogued his collection of glass, which was published in 1869 and 1871.

Slade was the subject of a portrait in coloured chalk by Margaret Sarah Carpenter.

<doc id="655196" wikidata="Q1681274" url="?curid=655196" title="James Wapakhabulo">
<text>James Francis Wambogo Wapakhabulo (23 March 1945 – 27 March 2004) was a Ugandan politician who served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Uganda from 2001 to 2004.

==Background==
Wapakhabulo began his career studying law at the University of East Africa (now the University of Dar es Salaam). From the 1960s until its collapse in 1977, he worked as a clerk and legal draftsman with the Assembly of the East African Community. Later that year, he moved to Papua New Guinea, as first a senior legal draftsman and then a principal legal officer. He continued in this role until 1986.

==Political career==
Wapakhabulo became involved with the ruling National Resistance Movement. He then stood for Parliament, and between 1994 and 1995 was chairman of the Constituent Assembly. In 1996, he was promoted to Speaker of Parliament, a post he held until 1998. In 1998, he was appointed as the National Political Commissar in Uganda&#x27;s no-party political system until 2001 when he became Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. He held both these positions until his death.

During his time as foreign minister, he helped contain a conflict with Rwanda and soothed relations with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, and Sudan. In 2001, Wapakhabulo threatened to sue an opposition MP, Wanjusi Wasieba, after Wasieba accused him of blocking his electoral nomination. After making the accusation, Wasieba claimed that he had received death threats and hired armed guards.

Several days before he died, Wapakhabulo wrote to President (and long-time friend) Yoweri Museveni, opposing the lifting of term limits outside those prescribed by the constitution. He died at his home in the neighborhood of Bugolobi in Kampala on 27 March 2004. He was laid to rest at Mafudu Village, Sironko District on Friday, 2 April 2004.

Wapakhabulo was liked by many on both sides of Ugandan politics. Upon hearing of his death, leading opposition MP Aggrey Awori stated that he was &quot;the best speaker ever&quot;. He was a recipient of Uganda&#x27;s Nalubaale Medal for civilian activists who had assisted during the guerrilla war. Upon his death, Vice President Gilbert Bukenya proposed that Parliament Avenue in Kampala be renamed Wapa Avenue in honor of Wapakhabulo.

In January 2005, President Museveni appointed Sam Kutesa, the Minister of State for Investment, to succeed Wapakhabulo as foreign minister.

<doc id="655212" wikidata="Q7143796" url="?curid=655212" title="Pat Mora">
<text>Pat Mora (born January 19, 1942) is an American poet and author of books for adults, teens and children. A native of El Paso, Texas, her grandparents came to the city from northern Mexico. She graduated from the University of Texas at El Paso, received Honorary Doctorates from North Carolina State University and SUNY Buffalo, and was awarded American Library Association Honorary Membership. A literacy advocate, in 1996, she founded Children&#x27;s Day, Book Day (), now celebrated across the country each year on April 30.

==Career==
Pat Mora taught for the El Paso Public Schools, the El Paso Community College, and the University of Texas at El Paso where she then became Assistant to the Vice President for Academic Affairs and later Assistant to the President.

===Writing===
Mora began professionally writing in the early 1980s. She has produced writing for all age groups, creating picture books, poetry and biographies. Her choice of subject matter and theme is often shaped by life on the Mexico–United States border where she was born and spent much of her life. she says: &quot;The desert, &quot;mi madre,&quot; is my stern teacher...The Southwestern landscape has been my world, my point of reference.&quot; Her writing highlights the human and cultural diversity of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. She writes of the rich sense of &quot;diversity within Mexican American experience.&quot; Mora celebrates diversity and is opposed to the idea of an American monoculture; therefore, she is very concerned with preserving cultural heritage: &quot;I write because I believe that Mexican Americans need to take their rightful place in U.S. literature. We need to be published and to be studied in schools and colleges so that the stories and ideas of our people won&#x27;t quietly disappear.&quot;

Mora is a strong advocate of bilingual literacy. Early in her career, she coined a concept she named &quot;bookjoy&quot; which describes the pleasure of reading.

Mora&#x27;s style of writing often incorporates code-switching between English and Spanish words. As a writer, she allows a free-flow of ideas in her first draft: she doesn&#x27;t question her motivation for writing and writes using &quot;as little conscious analysis as possible.&quot; She prefers to use her critical eye for editing her own work later.

Mora has collaborated with her daughter, Libby Martinez, on two children&#x27;s books: &quot;I Pledge Allegiance&quot; and &quot;Bravo, Chico Canta! Bravo!&quot;, for which Martinez is the illustrator.

===Children&#x27;s Day, Book Day===
In the mid-nineties, Mora founded the community-based, family literacy initiative, &quot;El día de los niños, El día de los libros&quot;/Children&#x27;s Day, Book Day (&quot;Día&quot;). In 1997, she received the official endorsement of REFORMA, the National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-Speaking for the project. Mora based &quot;Dia&quot; on Mexican National Children&#x27;s Day festivities held since 1925. The two part celebration of &quot;Día&quot; includes a commitment to promote literacy and bookjoy, and culminates in book celebrations that unite communities. When choosing a date to kick off &quot;Día&quot;, she chose April 30 because it was the last day of National Poetry month. The first &quot;Dia&quot; took place in 1996.

Children&#x27;s Day, Book Day, has grown in the U.S. to include all children, languages and cultures. Mora has expressed the desire to have books, celebrations and materials for &quot;Día&quot; to include &quot;all languages spoken in the United States.&quot;

In 2004, the Association for Library Services to Children&#x27;s (ALSC) division of the American Library Association became an active partner for &quot;Dia&quot;. Mora says, &quot;If we want our nation to be a country of readers...[we] need to work together to inspire communities in nurturing reading families.&quot;../

<text>, also transliterated Ashvaghosha (, ; lit. &quot;Having a Horse-Voice&quot;; ; ) ( CE), was a Buddhist philosopher, dramatist, poet, musician, and orator from India. He was born in Saketa, today known as Ayodhya. 

He is believed to have been the first Sanskrit dramatist, and is considered the greatest Indian poet prior to Kālidāsa. It seems probable that he was the contemporary and spiritual adviser of Kanishka in the first century of our era. He was the most famous in a group of Buddhist court writers, whose epics rivaled the contemporary &quot;Ramayana.&quot; Whereas much of Buddhist literature prior to the time of Aśvaghoṣa had been composed in Pāli and Prakrit, Aśvaghoṣa wrote in Classical Sanskrit. He may have been associated with the Sarvāstivāda or the Mahasanghika schools. 

==Life==

He is said to have been born in Ayodhya. His original (lay) name is unknown, Aśvaghosa being a later nickname only. According to the traditional biography of Aśvaghoṣa, which was translated into Chinese by Kumārajīva, and preserved in that language, he was originally a wandering ascetic who was able to defeat all-comers in debate. He set a challenge to the Buddhist monks that if none could meet with him in debate then they should stop beating the wood-block which signalled to the people to bring offerings to them. There was no one there to meet the challenge so they stopped beating the wood-block.

However, in the north there was an elder bhikṣu named Pārśva at the time, who saw that if he could convert this ascetic, it would be a great asset to the propagation of the Dharma, so he travelled from northern India and had the wood-block sounded. The ascetic came to ask why it had been sounded. Though thinking the old monk would be unable to debate with him, he accepted the challenge. After seven days, the debate was held in front of the King, his Ministers, and many ascetics and brahmans. The loser agreed to become the disciple of the other.

They agreed that the elder Pārśva should speak first, and he said: &quot;The world should be made peaceable, with a long-lived king, plentiful harvests, and joy throughout the land, with none of the myriad calamities&quot;, to which the ascetic had no response and so was bound to become Pārśva&#x27;s disciple, and he was given full ordination as a bhikṣu. Although he had to consent to this, he still was not convinced of the elder&#x27;s virtues until he showed him he had mastered the Bases of Spiritual Power (r̥ddhipādāḥ), at which point he gained faith. Pārśva then taught him the 5 Faculties, the 5 Powers, the 7 Factors and the 8-fold Noble Path, and he eventually mastered the teaching.

Later, the central kingdom was besieged by the Kuṣāna king&#x27;s army, who demanded 300,000 gold pieces in tribute. The King could not pay so much, as he had only 100,000. The Kuṣāna king therefore asked for the Buddha&#x27;s begging bowl, the converted monk, and the 100,000 gold pieces for his tribute. Although the king of the central kingdom was unhappy, the monk persuaded him it would be for the good of the propagation of the Dharma which would spread across the four continents if he went with the Kuṣāna king. He was therefore taken away.

The Kuṣāna&#x27;s king&#x27;s Ministers, however, were unhappy, not thinking that the bhikṣu was priced correctly at 100,000 gold pieces. The king, who knew the worth of bhiksu, ordered that seven horses be starved for six days. The king then made an assembly and had the bhikṣu preach the Dharma. Even the horses, whose favourite food was placed in front of them, were entranced by the Teaching of the monk, and listened intently. Everybody was thereby convinced of his worth. He was then granted the name Aśvaghoṣa, Horse-Cry.

He travelled throughout northern India proclaiming the Dharma and guiding all through his wisdom and understanding, and he was held in great regard by the four-fold assembly, who knew him as The Sun of Merit and Virtue.

It is now believed that Aśvaghoṣa was not from the Mahayanist period, and seems to have been ordained into a subsect of the Mahasanghikas. Some recent research into his &quot;kavya&quot; poems have revealed that he may have used the &quot;Yogacarabhumi&quot; as a textual reference, particularly for the &quot;Saundarananda&quot;, which opens up the possibility he was affiliated with either the Yogacara or the Sautrantika school.

==Works==
Aśvaghoṣa wrote an epic life of the Buddha called &quot;Buddhacharita&quot; (&quot;Acts of the Buddha&quot;) in classical Sanskrit. The monk I-tsing (Yijing) mentioned that in his time &quot;Buddhacarita&quot; was &quot;...extensively read in all the five parts of India and in the countries of the South Sea (Sumātra, Jāva and the neighbouring islands). He clothed manifold notions and ideas in a few words which so delighted the heart of his reader that he never wearied of perusing the poem. Moreover, it was regarded as a virtue to read it in as much as it contained the noble doctrine in a neat compact form.&quot;

He also wrote &quot;Saundarananda&quot;, a kāvya poem with the theme of conversion of Nanda, Buddha&#x27;s half-brother, so that he might reach salvation. The first half of the work describes Nanda&#x27;s life, and the second half of the work describes Buddhist doctrines and ascetic practices.

Aśvaghoṣa also wrote drama, and a fragment of his &quot;Śāriputraprakaraṇa&quot; has survived in Sanskrit.

=== Other attributed works ===
There are various works which have been attributed to Aśvaghoṣa which are of questionable authorship.

One of these works is the &quot;Tridaṇḍamālā&quot; (preserved in a single Sanskrit manuscript) which includes within it various passages from other Aśvaghoṣa works as well as the text of the &quot;Śokavinodana&quot; (attributed to Aśvaghoṣa)&quot;.&quot;

Aśvaghoṣa has been claimed to be the author of the &quot;Sutralankara&quot;.

Aśvaghoṣa was previously believed to have been the author of the influential East Asian Buddhist text named &quot;The&quot; &quot;Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana&quot; (Chinese: 大乘起信論; pinyin: &quot;Dàshéng Qǐxìn Lùn&quot;), but modern scholars agree that the text was composed in China.

Another text ascribed to Aśvaghoṣa is &quot;Vajrasuchi&quot;, an extensive, beautifully written poetry that is critical of class and inequity imposed by Vedic religion. The relationship between the &quot;Vajrasuchi&quot; text of Buddhism and &quot;Vajrasuchi Upanishad&quot; of Hinduism has long been of interest to scholars. This interest among Western scholars began with Brian Houghton Hodgson – a colonial official based in Nepal who was loaned a Sanskrit text titled &quot;Vajra Suchi&quot; in 1829, by a Buddhist friend of his, whose contents turned out to be similar to the &quot;Vajrasuci Upanishad&quot;. In 1835, Hodgson published a translation. The first line of the Hodgson translation mentioned &quot;Ashu Ghosa&quot; and invoked &quot;Manju Ghosa&quot; as the Guru of the World. The details of the caste system, its antiquity and &quot;shrewd and argumentative attack&quot; by a Buddhist, in the words of Hodgson, gained wide interest among 19th-century scholars. The scholarship that followed, surmised that &quot;Ashu Ghosa&quot; is possibly the famous Buddhist scholar Aśvaghoṣa, who lived around the 2nd century CE.

<doc id="655221" wikidata="Q7672341" url="?curid=655221" title="Pop (American TV channel)">
<text>Pop, commonly referred to as Pop TV (formerly known as Electronic Program Guide, Prevue Guide, Prevue Channel, TV Guide Channel, and TV Guide Network), is an American pay television channel owned by Paramount Global under its networks division through MTV Entertainment Group. It is a general entertainment channel, focusing primarily on programs pertaining to popular culture.

The network was originally launched in 1981 as a barker channel service providing a display of localized channel and program listings for cable television providers. Later on, the service, branded Prevue Channel or Prevue Guide and later as Prevue, began to broadcast interstitial segments alongside the on-screen guide, which included entertainment, news, and promotions for upcoming programs. After Prevue&#x27;s parent company, United Video Satellite Group, acquired the entertainment magazine &quot;TV Guide&quot; in 1998 (UVSG would in turn, be acquired by Gemstar the following year), the service was relaunched as TV Guide Channel (later TV Guide Network), which now featured full-length programs dealing with the entertainment industry, including news magazines and reality shows, along with red carpet coverage from major award shows.

Following the acquisition of TV Guide Network by Lionsgate in 2009, its programming began to shift towards a general entertainment format with reruns of dramas and sitcoms. In 2013, CBS Corporation acquired of a 50% stake in the network, and the network was renamed TVGN. At the same time, as its original purpose grew obsolete because of the integrated program guides offered by digital television platforms, the network began to downplay and phase out its program listings service; as of June 2014, none of the network&#x27;s carriage contracts require the display of the listings, and they were excluded entirely from its high-definition simulcast. In 2015, TVGN was rebranded as Pop. In 2019, CBS acquired Lionsgate&#x27;s 50% stake in Pop and merged with Viacom.

, Pop is available to approximately 60,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2007 peak of 84,000,000 households.

== History ==

On September 18, 2014, CBS and Lionsgate announced that TVGN (previously TV Guide Network) would be relaunched as Pop in early 2015, with the rebranding later announced to occur on January 14 of that year. The newly branded channel would shift toward programming about pop culture fandom and would carry 400 hours of original programming following the rebrand, including a reality show starring New Kids on the Block and the Canadian sitcom &quot;Schitt&#x27;s Creek&quot;, the first program from Pop TV to receive Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Comedy Series. Pop was made available on AT&amp;T U-verse on March 1, 2016.

On March 12, 2019, CBS acquired Lionsgate&#x27;s 50% stake in Pop, making Pop a part of CBS Cable Networks. It then became part of ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks on December 4, 2019, when CBS merged with Viacom. Now under the latter&#x27;s management, it was merged into Viacom&#x27;s existing cable unit with corresponding job losses due to redundancies. As Viacom traditionally has their programming produced internally for their cable networks rather than from outside producers, second-season renewals for &quot;Flack&quot; and &quot;Florida Girls&quot;, along with a series order for &quot;Best Intentions&quot; were revoked, with Viacom freeing all three series to be shopped to other venues without penalty.

== Programming ==

Current programming seen on Pop includes a mix of procedural dramas, including &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Scorpion&quot;, and series from the &quot;NCIS&quot; and &quot;Law and Order&quot; franchises, along with films. As mentioned above, original programming for the channel was cut after 2020 as the newly merged ViacomCBS (now Paramount Global) focused on their more high-profile brands. Previously, the network also aired professional wrestling from Total Nonstop Action / Impact Wrestling and the now-defunct Las Vegas-based Paragon Pro Wrestling promotion.

<text>Raymond Chang (March 6, 1939 – April 10, 2017) was an emeritus professor at Williams College in the Department of Chemistry and a textbook author. His most popular textbook was titled &quot;Chemistry,&quot; which was published up to the thirteenth edition. He also published a few children&#x27;s books.

He was a naturalized American citizen who came from Hong Kong to America to start graduate studies at Yale University. There he received both his master&#x27;s and PhD degrees. His family was originally from Shanghai, but Chang was born in Hong Kong as a result of his family&#x27;s deportation in 1937. They left to escape the Japanese invasion of China. However, in 1941, Chang and his family returned to Shanghai for eight years before they again re-returned to Hong Kong. As a result of his forced movement through different regions of China Chang became fluent in many Chinese dialects. At the age of seventeen, Chang followed his sister to London. He received his B.Sc. with a first-class honors degree in chemistry from the University of London and Ph. D. from Yale University. He completed his postdoctoral research at Washington University in St. Louis and served as a professor at Hunter College of the City University of New York, prior to joining the faculty at Williams College in 1968.

On August 3, 1968, he married Margaret A. Scrogin. They had one daughter, Elizabeth Chang.

After that, he became an assistant professor of chemistry at Hunter College part of  City University of New York, in New York City. Chang distinguished himself between 1968 and 1973, as he was the only Asian American who worked at Williams College in that time. Subsequently, from 1978 to 1989 he worked as professor of chemistry at Halford R. Clark Professor of Natural Sciences. By 1993 he went on to chair the department for two years.  

In the late 1970s and through the 1980s, Chang worked as a visiting scientist at various schools, including the University of California, where he worked in the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory and the Laboratory of Chemical Biodynamics. He also held positions at Stanford University, Amherst College, and on the Olympiad Examinations Task Force.

He was a member of the American Chemical Society, where he contributed to the examination committees for physical chemistry and general chemistry, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Chang contributed numerous articles to chemistry journals, and he was a member of the editorial board of Chemical Educator. He also authored or contributed to instructor&#x27;s manuals, workbooks, and study guides that accompanied his chemistry texts.
