<text>Catherine Jagiellon (; , Lithuanian: &quot;Kotryna Jogailaitė&quot;; 1 November 1526 – 16 September 1583) was a princess of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Queen of Sweden from 1569 as the wife of King John III. Catherine had significant influence over state affairs during the reign of her spouse. She negotiated with the pope to introduce Counter-Reformation in Sweden. She was the mother of Sigismund III Vasa.

==Early life==
Catherine Jagiellon was born in Kraków as the youngest daughter of King Sigismund I the Old of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and his wife, Bona Sforza of Milan.

Catherine was given a thorough Renaissance education by Italian tutors: she was taught to read, write and speak Latin, German and Italian, instructed in conversation, riding, dancing, singing, and playing several musical instruments.

After the death of her father in 1548, she and her unmarried sisters Anna and Sophia moved to Masovia with their mother. In 1556, when her sister Sophia married and left for Germany and her mother departed for Italy, Catherine and her sister Anna were moved to the Palace of Vilnius by their brother Sigismund II Augustus of Poland, to ensure a royal presence in Lithuania. Their stay in Vilnius was described as happy, living in a palace and a court strongly influenced by the Italian Renaissance: Catherine and Anna were allowed to compose their own separate households and socialized with the aristocracy.

===Marriage negotiations===
Catherine was described as the most beautiful of her sisters, but she was married late for a princess of the era because her family wanted to ensure a marriage of the highest political status for Poland, and the marriages proposed to her demanded protracted negotiations which ultimately came to nothing. In 1548, she was proposed marriage to by both Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Duke Albert of Prussia, who both preferred her to her sisters Anna and Sophia. Her brother was inclined to the latter, but after lengthy negotiations, the Pope refused the marriage because they were related to each other. Next, she was proposed to by Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria, but her brother, who had himself married a member of the Habsburg dynasty by then, ultimately decided against it.

In the 1550s, her brother the king wished for an alliance between Poland and Sweden against the Tsardom of Russia due to growing tension around Livonia. The religious issue was not considered a serious obstacle by her brother, and the Catholic policy in Poland was at that time still tolerant toward Protestantism. The Polish-Swedish alliance was a wish her brother entertained for several years, and it had in fact been suggested already in 1526, that time between her half-sister Hedwig and King Gustav I of Sweden. In 1555–56, Sigismund II Augustus suggested to King Gustav I that one of the four Swedish princes, preferably Eric or his brother John, should marry either his sister Anna or Catherine, and he sent portraits of the princesses to the Swedish royal court. Eric was at that time proposing to marry the future queen Elizabeth I of England, however, a proposal he was not willing to give up for several years. There was talk of Catherine marrying John, but Sigismund II Augustus was somewhat reluctant to allow his younger sister to marry before the eldest, Anna, and this created a problem. The negotiations were drawn out, and in 1560, Gustav I died and all negotiations were closed.

In August 1560, during the Livonian war, Czar Ivan the Terrible, recently widowed, suggested a marriage between himself and Catherine in order to create peace and settle the differences between Poland and Russia. Her brother viewed the proposal favourably and a Russian delegation visited the Polish court in Vilnius. The Russian envoy reported to Ivan the Terrible that Catherine was beautiful, but that she was crying. Ultimately, Poland and Russia could not agree on the political terms of the marriage and the negotiations were discontinued in January 1561.

In July 1561, Sigismund II Augustus suggested to King Eric XIV that his sisters Catherine and Anna should be married to the king&#x27;s brothers, John and Magnus. Erik XIV gave no definite answer. John was willing to marry Catherine, but not Anna. Sigismund II Augustus was still somewhat reluctant to allow his younger sister to marry before his older one, which created a problem. Magnus eventually expressed himself willing to marry Anna to enable John to marry Catherine, but the negotiations initially led to nothing and the Swedish king was not willing to take a stand on the issue. In October, John resumed the negotiations of marriage between himself and Catherine on his own initiative and without the consent of Eric XIV, during a time when Sweden under Eric XIV was fighting Poland in the Livonian war. John viewed the Polish king as an important ally and Catherine&#x27;s Italian inheritance from her mother as important assets in his personal ambitions.

==Duchess of Finland==

On 4 October 1562, Catherine was married in the Lower Castle of Vilnius, Lithuania, to Duke John of Finland, the second son of Gustav I and half-brother of the then-reigning King Eric XIV. John had not received his brother&#x27;s permission for the marriage and there were already tensions between them since John pursued an independent foreign policy. The marriage was conducted in a Catholic ceremony. Catherine brought a large entourage and luxurious possessions, but the inheritance from her mother was actually never given to her. The material dowry she brought with her to Finland, however, greatly impressed her contemporaries: she brought with her an impressive amount of silver items, among them the first forks used in Finland; hundreds of garments in black, yellow, red and purple satin, silk and velvet; as well as an entourage of Poles, Italians and Germans, among them a Polish cook and an Italian vine master.

The couple set up house in Turku Castle in Turku, Finland. Duke John&#x27;s dealings in Livonia caused King Eric XIV to declare war on his brother. Eric sent 10,000 men to besiege the castle. On 12 August 1563, the castle capitulated; Catherine and John were taken to Sweden and imprisoned in Gripsholm Castle. 
Eric offered to allow Catherine to return to Poland, but she chose to accompany John in prison. Tradition claims that when the king made the offer, Catherine pointed to the inscription in her wedding ring, which said: &quot;Nemo nisi mors&quot; (&quot;Nothing but death [shall separate us]&quot;). Catherine was used as a valuable hostage by Eric, but because of her, the imprisonment was lenient. She was personally treated with consideration by king Eric, who allowed her greater freedom than John, such as walking in the area around the castle, and generally granted all requests she made in order to make her imprisonment more comfortable, with the exception of anything that had to do with her Catholic religion, such as the access to Catholic priests, which he denied. She asked for the larger part of her entourage to be sent home, only keeping some Polish ladies-in-waiting and her Court dwarf and personal confidante Dorothea Ostrelska. During her incarceration, Catherine gave birth first to her eldest daughter Isabella in 1564 (died 1566), then to her son Sigismund in 1566. In October 1567, John reconciled with Eric, and the couple was released. Catherine and John apparently developed a close relationship during the years of imprisonment. 
Catherine&#x27;s unsuccessful suitor Tsar Ivan was in negotiations with Eric in hopes of separating her from John and sending her to marry him in Russia. This caused alarm among Catherine and her relations. In popular opinion, this discussion was one of the reasons for the Swedish people&#x27;s growing dissatisfaction with the increasingly insane Eric. King Eric agreed to hand over Catherine to Ivan, but the Swedish king was deposed before Catherine could be sent away. As his brother John succeeded him, the problem disappeared. Catherine was at Vadstena during the rebellion.

Another reason which agitated the nobility against Erik XIV and made them encourage the rebellion of Duke John and his brother Duke Charles was the marriage of Erik to the commoner Karin Månsdotter, which the nobility regarded as an insult. Catherine played some part in the rebellion: she was a friend of one of Erik&#x27;s enemies, Ebba Lilliehöök, who had an influential position within the nobility, and she was also directly approached by Pontus De la Gardie, who appealed to her to persuade the indecisive John to join the rebellion against the King in protest of his scandalous marriage. According to a witness, she answered: &quot;Pontus! I have heard your advice and the reasons you present well and good, and they are all very correct and just, but hard to realise. My dear friend, show me the courtesy of allowing this to remain between us, and I will speak to my lord and husband.&quot;After the fall of Stockholm, she made her entrance to the city in a grand procession on 7 November 1568.

==Queen consort==

Catherine was crowned queen of Sweden in the spring of 1569. Her relationship with John III continued to be very good during her lifetime, and there are no extramarital partners known on either side. Her ladies-in-waiting were supervised by Karin Gyllenstierna and her household by chamberlain Pontus De la Gardie, with whom she reportedly had a very good personal relationship (she gave him power of attorney to act as her agent and envoy in Italy regarding her Sforza inheritance). She had her own personal Catholic chapel at court as well as several Catholics in her private household, among them several Catholic monks and priests, which shocked the Protestants. Despite the controversy around her regarding her role in religious policy, she does not appear to have been subjected to much personal slander. She received many supplicants from both Catholics and Protestants, asking her for charity as well as to act as mediary to the king, and fulfilled these duties as was expected by a contemporary queen consort. Her fervent Protestant brother-in-law, the future Charles IX mentioned her in his propaganda chronicle &quot;Hertig Karls rimkrönika&quot;, in which he slanders the names of her spouse, son and daughter, but with only mild disapproval toward Catherine, acknowledging her personal qualities: &quot;She was a Princess full of virtue and piety, still her faith did come from Rome&quot;.

Queen Catherine had political influence and influenced the monarch in many areas, such as his foreign policy and his interest in Renaissance art. It is a revealing fact that the king&#x27;s diplomatic contacts with the Catholic powers quickly diminished after her death. Foremost, however, she is known to have influenced John III in his religious policy in favour of Catholicism and the Counter-Reformation, just as the next queen and spouse of John III, Gunilla Bielke, would influence his religious policy in favour of Protestantism. John III named Catherine the prospective regent of Sweden during the minority of his son, should he die while his son was a minor.

Another significant matter of interest were the rights of her son Sigismund to the Polish throne. She brought up both her children in the Catholic faith, which made Sigismund acceptable as a Polish monarch. After the death of her childless brother Sigismund II Augustus in 1572, she considered her son to have rights to the Polish throne through her. However, after 1569, Poland had become an elective monarchy. This matter, however, also made her significant internationally.

In 1582, she received the former queen, Karin Månsdotter, and saw to it that her confiscated jewellery was returned to her.

In her final years, Catherine suffered from gout. She fell sick in the spring of 1583, died in Stockholm on 16 September 1583 and was buried in the royal crypt of the Uppsala Cathedral.

===Religious policy===
After having become queen, she attracted international attention as a Catholic queen in a Protestant nation, with the position of being able to introduce the Counter-Reformation. In the Papal curia in Rome, she was seen as a Catholic in heretic surroundings.

The same year she became queen, her Polish adviser coadjutor Martin Kromer encouraged her to convert John III to Catholicism. She answered that she was willing, but that the monarch and the public would not accept it. Cardinal Commendone asked her sister, the Queen of Poland Anna Jagiellon, to support her in her religious-political task, and through Anna, she made contact with the Papal Curia in Rome. A conflict arose between Catherine and Pope Pius V after it became known that she had received the communion &quot;sub utraque&quot;, something which had been banned in the Council of Trent and since then regarded as a sign of heresy. In 1572, she asked for two papal advisers and was given the Polish Jesuit Johan Herbst as her confessor. From 1572, Queen Catherine was in direct contact with Cardinal Stanislaus Hosius, who declared that he would serve as her support and ally in the work of counter-reformation in Sweden and her messenger to the Pope.

In the autumn of 1572, Catherine applied for dispensation to be given the right to receive the communion &quot;sub utraque&quot; and certain dispensations regarding fasting. Her demands are seen as a way for John III to investigate how far the Catholic church would be willing to go to introduce the Counter-Reformation, as certain changes would have to be made to make it possible. John III launched a new church order called &quot;Röda Boken&quot; (&quot;The Red Book&quot;). This was a sort of mix between Protestantism and Catholicism that reintroduced numerous Catholic customs in the ceremonial life of the Swedish church, one of them being the use of Latin, which aroused a great deal of opposition and resulted in the Liturgical struggle, which was not to end for twenty years. Queen Catherine, Queen Anna, Cardinal Hosius and the pope negotiated for several years about this, and Catherine pointed out, that without certain dispensations for Sweden, a counter-reformation would not be possible. In 1574, she was given absolution and dispensation regarding fasting, but as the pope refused dispensation regarding communion, she refused to take communion altogether. Her agent in Rome was Paolo Ferrari. The papal curia had serious hopes for a counter-reformation in Sweden through her. In 1574, she received the Polish Jesuit Stanislaus Warszewicki, sent to her as an ambassador from the pope and king Philip II of Spain.

Queen Catherine had the son of the deposed Eric XIV sent to the Jesuit order in Poland in 1573. In 1575, the ban for the remaining convents in Sweden to accept novices was lifted. In 1576, she sent her son to be educated by the Jesuits in Braunsberg. She welcomed the Norwegian Jesuit Laurentius Nicolai from Rome and housed him in the former Franciscan monastery in Stockholm, which had been closed during the Reformation, and allowed him to open a Catholic school there (the Protestants stormed and closed the school in 1583). Queen Catherine strongly supported the old Vadstena Abbey, where the last nuns still lived, and often visited it. A new shrine was made for the relics of King Eric the Saint in the cathedral of Uppsala.

The counter-reformatory efforts contributed to tension in connection to the imprisoned Erik XIV, who came to be a symbol of Protestantism in prison. During the imprisonment of Eric, three major conspiracies were made to depose John III: the 1569 Plot, the Mornay Plot and the 1576 Plot, among which at least the last was heavily influenced by religious considerations.

===Sforza inheritance===
Catherine and John III were both eager to be given possession of her part of the Sforza inheritance from her mother in Italy. Queen Catherine had her own personal ambassadors in Rome to protect her interests, Petrus Rosinus and Ture Bielke. The papal curia was willing to help them in this issue, but as her inheritance was situated in the Kingdom of Naples, then belonging to Spain, the pope did not succeed. During the reign of King Stephen Báthory in Poland, the relation between Sweden and Poland affected Catherine&#x27;s power position in Sweden and placed her in a difficult situation. In 1578-79 and 1579–80, she received the papal ambassador Antonio Possevino. He had been given the task of providing Catherine with her Sforza inheritance, mediating between Poland and Sweden and converting John III. He failed on all accounts. He did, however, confirm the marriage between the royal couple, which had been dubious in Rome, as it had lacked the dispensation which was necessary for Rome to consider a marriage between a Catholic and a Protestant as valid. In 1582, Catherine received the Polish ambassador Alamanni and explained that she was not in a position to convince John to make peace with Poland. At her next audience with the ambassador, she received him in the presence of her children Sigismund and Anna and stated that Poland seldom had seen to her interests.

Catherine was, by testament, one of the heirs of her nephew John Sigismund Zápolya, ruler of Transilvania.

==Legacy==
The infusion of Polish - Lithuanian Commonwealth blood into the Swedish royal lineage that began with Catherine would cause considerable strife after her death in the context of the ongoing European wars of religion. Her son Sigismund inherited the thrones of both the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (in 1587) and Sweden (in 1592) but ruled the latter only seven years before being deposed in 1599. Sigismund and his descendants, as Catholic kings, would continue to lay claim to &quot;de facto&quot; Protestant Sweden over the following century. The succession dispute contributed to the outbreak of several destructive wars until a massive Swedish invasion in the 1650s (known as the Deluge) nearly broke up the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Polish claims to the Swedish throne were finally relinquished in the 1660 Treaty of Oliva.

The image of Catherine Jagiellon enjoyed a resurgence in the 19th and 20th centuries Finnish culture and art. John and Catherine were the only Swedish monarchs to reside in the Finnish part of the Swedish realm for any length of time, and their alleged fondness for the land inspired Finnish nationalists. The religious issues that made Catherine unpopular with her contemporaries were by then long obsolete, and it has instead become traditional to depict her as a compassionate and loyal queen.

The first version of the later famous royal Drottningholm Palaca (&quot;The Queen&#x27;s Islet&quot;) was founded for and named after her.

<text>Ursynów () is the southernmost district of Warsaw. With a surface area of , it is the third largest district in Warsaw, comprising 8.6% of the city. The district has a population of over 150,000, and is one of the fastest-growing neighbourhoods in Warsaw. Nearly 25% of its inhabitants are below 18 years of age.

The eastern section of Ursynów is heavily built up with blocks of flats, while its western and southern sections are often referred to as &quot;Green Ursynów&quot; due to its lower population density and broad open spaces and green areas. The neighbourhood is considered the &quot;bedroom of Warsaw&quot;, and is home to nearly a quarter of the city&#x27;s post-1989 construction.

Ursynów&#x27;s southern extremity comprises Kabaty Forest, covering more than . Other popular attractions include the Vistula river escarpment, Natolin palace and Służewiec horseracing track (built in 1939), used not only for its original purpose, but for open-air exhibitions, pop concerts, etc.

Ursynów is served by the Ursynów, Stokłosy, Imielin, Natolin and Kabaty stations of the Warsaw Metro. The Kabaty depot is located in the south of the borough.

<text>Down House is the former home of the English naturalist Charles Darwin and his family. It was in this house and garden that Darwin worked on his theory of evolution by natural selection, which he had conceived in London before moving to Down.

The Grade I listed building stands in Luxted Road, south of Downe, a village south-east of London&#x27;s Charing Cross. The village was known as Down when Darwin moved there in 1842. In his day, Downe was a parish in Kent. Since 1965, it has lain within the London Borough of Bromley.

The house, garden and grounds are in the guardianship of English Heritage. They have been restored and are open to the public.

== History ==
=== 1651–1842: early history ===
In 1651, Thomas Manning sold a parcel of land including most of the current property to John Know the elder, from a Kentish yeoman family, for £345 (equivalent to £ today). It has been debated whether this price is likely to have included a house, but, if not, it was Know who built the first farmhouse on the property: some surviving flint walls may date from this period. In 1653, John Know gave the house to his son Roger, probably as a wedding present; and in 1743, the marriage of Mary Know passed the property to the family of Bartholomew of West Peckham in the Weald. In 1751, Leonard Bartholomew sold the uninhabited house on to Charles Hayes of Hatton Garden.

The property was acquired by the businessman and landowner George Butler in 1778, and it is thought that he rebuilt and enlarged the house: in 1781, he paid the highest window tax in the village. Around this time, it was apparently called the Great House. After Butler died in 1783, the property changed hands several times, then in 1819, it went to Lieut.-Col. John Johnson, C.B., colonel of engineers in the Hon. East India Company, Bombay establishment. In 1837, Johnson migrated to &quot;Lake Erie near Dunville in Upper Canada&quot;, and passed what was now called Down House on to the incumbent parson of the parish, the Rev. James Drummond. The house was re-roofed and brought into good order under the supervision of Edward Cresy, an architect who lived nearby. Around 1840, Drummond left the property vacant and put it up for auction, but it was unsold and lay empty for two years.

=== 1842–1906: Darwin occupancy ===
The Darwin family in 1841 was finding their London house increasingly cramped: both Charles and his wife Emma preferred living in the countryside, as they were disturbed by the constant noise and severe coal smoke air pollution of central London, and they had two young children, William (b. 1839) and Anne (b. 1841). Darwin approached his father Robert Darwin for financing, and with the caution that he should try living in an area for some time before being committed to a move, was given approval to start house hunting. Charles and Emma sought somewhere about from London with railway access, such as Windsor, Berkshire, and came close to buying one near Chobham, Surrey.

On Friday 22 July 1842, Charles and Emma visited Down House. They slept at a little &quot;&quot; in the village, which was also &quot;a grocers-shop &amp; the land-lord is the carpenter&quot;, and returned to London on Saturday afternoon, then on the Sunday Darwin wrote to tell his sister of their first impressions. Though there were plenty of trains on the line from London to the nearest station, from there it was a long, slow and hilly drive to Downe. The small quiet village was away from main roads, and though local scenery was beautiful on a good day, the house &quot;being situated on rather high table-land, has somewhat of desolate air ... The charm of the place to me is that almost every field is intersected (as alas is our&#x27;s) by one or more foot-paths— I never saw so many walks in any other country&quot;.

The three-storey house itself stood &quot;very badly close to a tiny lane &amp; near another man&#x27;s field&quot;, and was &quot;ugly, looks neither old nor new&quot; but on the ground floor it had a &quot;Capital study&quot; and a dining room facing east, and a large drawing room facing west, with plenty of bedrooms upstairs. Darwin believed that the price was about £2,200 (equivalent to £ in present-day terms) and he could lease it for one year to try it out.

That Friday was cold and gloomy, and Emma was at first disappointed with the &quot;desolate&quot; scenery as well as being &quot;dreadfully bad with toothache, headache&quot;, that evening, but liked the house and grounds better than Charles, finding it &quot;not too near or too far from other houses&quot;. On the Saturday the weather changed, and &quot;she was so delighted with the scenery for the first few miles from Down, that it has worked great change in her&quot;.
The house had obvious faults, but they were both weary of house-hunting, and it was cheap. Emma preferred a more expensive house in Surrey, and may have hoped that Darwin&#x27;s father would increase the loan, but life in crowded dirty London was becoming more unpleasant and she was pregnant so unable to continue the search that year.

With advice from the architect and surveyor Edward Cresy, Darwin opened negotiations, but the Rev. James Drummond refused to lease the property and wanted £2,500 to pay off his mortgage on it. Cresy suggested a bid of £2,100, but Darwin remembered an unsuccessful earlier attempt at purchase, and made an offer of about £2,200 which was accepted. At the end of August they were almost ready to move, and Emma moved in on 14 September 1842, followed by Charles three days later. Emma gave birth to Mary Eleanor on 23 September, and they were all getting on well – even Darwin&#x27;s brother Erasmus who had said the place should be called &quot;Down-in-the-Mouth&quot; had altered his opinion, but they were saddened when baby Mary died on 16 October.

Darwin made extensive alterations to the house and grounds. An angled bay forming a large bow front extending up through all three storeys at the west elevation of the house extended the drawing room and rooms over it, giving improved views and lighting: Darwin wrote telling his cousin that the first brick was laid on 27 March 1843. By 27 April, work was in hand to lower the lane by as much as and build new flint boundary walls, which together with earth mounds and shrubbery made the east garden more private. A strip of the field was made into a kitchen garden including the experimental plot of ground, and later the greenhouses.

In September 1843, the Darwin family increased with the birth of &quot;Etty&quot; in the house, where all their remaining children were born: George in 1845, &quot;Bessy&quot; in 1847, Francis in 1848, Leonard in 1850, Horace in 1851, and their 10th child Charles Waring Darwin who was born in 1856, but died in 1858.

Between 1845 and 1846, Darwin altered the service wing to the south of the main block, getting the kitchen area rebuilt with the addition of a butler&#x27;s pantry, and a schoolroom and two small bedrooms on upper floors. The outhouses were rebuilt, and a mound to the west side was removed with a new mound being added to the east to give protection from the wind.

On their first visit, Darwin had noted that &quot;The great Astronomer Sir J. Lubbock is owner of 3000 acres [12 km2] here, &amp; is building a grand house a mile off&quot;, but thought that he would be too reserved or proud to visit them. In fact, Sir John William Lubbock had brought home a &quot;great piece of news&quot;, and while his son was initially disappointed that the news was just that Darwin was coming to Down House and not a new pony, young John Lubbock soon became close friends with Darwin and a frequent visitor to Down House.
In 1846, Darwin rented from Sir John William Lubbock a narrow strip of land of adjoining the Down House grounds to the southwest, and had it planted. He named it the Sandwalk Wood. One side was shaded by an old shaw with oak trees, and the other looked over a hedge to a charming valley. Darwin had a variety of trees planted, and ordered a gravel path known as the &quot;sandwalk&quot; to be created around the perimeter. Darwin&#x27;s daily walk of several circuits of this path served both for exercise and for uninterrupted thinking. He set up a number of small stones at one point on the walk so that he could kick a stone to the side each time he passed, so that he did not have to interrupt his thoughts by consciously counting the number of circuits he had made that day. The sandwalk also served as a playground for his children. A wooden summerhouse was built at the lower end of the sandwalk. In 1874, Darwin gave a piece of pasture land to Sir John Lubbock (the son) in exchange for ownership of the Sandwalk Wood. From 1849, Darwin used it to continue his walking exercise on return from Dr. Gully&#x27;s hydrotherapy treatment.

A new extension at the north end of the house was added in 1858, providing a large new drawing room facing west which became a comfortable family room, and two bedrooms over. The former drawing room was converted into a new dining room, and the old dining room next to the kitchen became a billiard room.

Darwin&#x27;s interest in the fertilisation of orchids led him to get a new heated greenhouse constructed under the supervision of John Horwood, the gardener of Mr Turnbull at The Rookery: this was completed in February 1863. It includes a tunnel passageway that allows bees to fly in and out. 
Darwin spent 16 years growing sundews and other carnivorous plants in his greenhouse, feeding them proteins like roast beef and boiled egg. This research became the basis for his pioneering book &quot;Insectivorous Plants&quot; (1875).

In 1872, a verandah was added to the west side of the new drawing room, and in 1877, a new billiard room was added to the east of this block, with the hallway being extended to form a new entrance hall and Georgian-style porch facing east. The new billiard room was converted to a new study in 1881, and the old study where Darwin wrote &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; was converted into a smoking room. In the same year, Darwin bought a strip of land to the north of the property, beyond his orchard, and had a hard tennis court and a new wall built. 

After the death of Frank&#x27;s first wife Amy, their son Bernard Darwin was brought up by Charles and Emma at Down. Charles Darwin died at the house on 19 April 1882, aged 73. Emma also died there in 1896.

In February 1897, the house was advertised to be let, furnished, at a rent of &quot;12 guineas per week, including gardeners&quot;. From 1900 to 1906, George Darwin rented the house out to a Mr. Whitehead, who was the first owner of a motor car in Downe.

=== 1907–1922: Downe School for Girls ===

A girls&#x27; boarding school was established at the house in February 1907, co-founded by the headmistress Olive Willis (1877–1964) with her friend Alice Carver. The school began with five mistresses and one girl, but was soon successful and grew to around 60 pupils. Various corrugated iron outbuildings were erected around the house at this time, to serve as the school&#x27;s chapel, gymnasium, music-rooms and lavatories: these were later removed. The school occupied the house until 1 April 1922, when it moved to larger premises at Hermitage Rd, Cold Ash, Newbury, where it remains. The present school is still named Downe House School, and one of its houses is still named Darwin. The novelist Elizabeth Bowen, who was a pupil at the school during the First World War, wrote after revisiting Down House in the 1930s: &quot;I have never liked scientific people very much, and it mortifies me to think of them trampling reverently around there on visiting days, thinking of Charles Darwin and ignorant of my own youth.&quot;

=== 1927–1996: Darwin Museum ===

From 1924, another girls&#x27; school was run in the house by a Miss Rain, but this was unsuccessful and closed in 1927. Following an appeal at that year&#x27;s Annual Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science by its president Sir Arthur Keith, the surgeon Sir George Buckston Browne (1850–1945) bought Down from the Darwin heirs for £4,250 in 1927 (equivalent to £ in present-day terms). He spent about £10,000 on repairs and on 7 January 1929 presented it to the British Association together with an endowment of £20,000 to ensure its preservation in perpetuity as a memorial to Darwin, to be used for the benefit of science and open to visitors free of charge. Down House was formally opened to the public as a museum at a tea on 7 June 1929. In 1931, Buckston Browne gave the Royal College of Surgeons of England (RCS England) an endowment fund and land adjacent to the Down House property to establish the Buckston Browne Research Farm, a surgical research station. For his efforts in saving the historic house, Buckston Browne received a knighthood in the 1932 New Year Honours.

Buckston Browne&#x27;s endowment for the house proved insufficient and the expense of maintenance led to the British Association in turn donating the house to the RCS England in October 1953. In 1962, Sir Hedley Atkins (1905–1983), later President of the RCS England, moved into the house together with his wife and assumed the role of honorary curator.

In May 1954, Down House itself was designated as a Grade I listed building, and in September 1988 the garden and Sandwalk were added to the Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England at Grade II.

=== 1996 to present: restored house and garden ===
Down House was acquired in 1996 by English Heritage, with a grant from the Wellcome Trust. It was restored with funds raised by the Natural History Museum from many trusts, and from a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and reopened to the public in April 1998. In 2009, the Darwin Bicentenary Project created a new exhibition on the first floor of the house, telling the story of Darwin&#x27;s life and work. A video guide outside focuses on how Darwin used his garden as an outdoor laboratory and features clips from David Attenborough, Professor Steve Jones and Melvyn Bragg. Darwin&#x27;s notebooks were digitised using Turning the Pages software and put online.

Down House and the surrounding area has been nominated by the UK government&#x27;s Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to become a World Heritage Site. It originally went through public consultation in 2006 and a decision had been expected in the last three days of June 2007. However, ICOMOS warned the DCMS that the House might not meet the criteria for scientific sites on the register, and so in May 2007, the DCMS announced that it was withdrawing the bid with the intention of resubmitting it later. The bid was resubmitted unsuccessfully in January 2009.

The master bedroom was restored, and opened to the public for the first time in June 2016. The restoration included a reconstruction of the Darwins&#x27; collection of fine art prints, with Biblical scenes by Raphael, Titian, and Sebastiano del Piombo, as well as a Raphael self-portrait in the bedroom, and a self-portrait by Leonardo da Vinci in Darwin&#x27;s study together with portraits of Charles Lyell and Erasmus Darwin.

==Visiting==
Down House, its garden and grounds are open to the public daily from April to October; from November through to March, it opens on weekends. The house and garden undergoes routine conservation work during its closed periods.

The house can be reached by public transport from central London, as it is located within Transport for London travel Zone 6. The 146 bus service from Bromley North railway station (daily) terminates nearby at Downe Village, and the R8 bus from Orpington railway station (excluding Sundays) stops on request outside Down House. The closest Tramlink station is New Addington.

<text>Westbury White Horse or Bratton White Horse is a hill figure on the escarpment of Salisbury Plain, approximately east of Westbury in Wiltshire, England. Located on the edge of Bratton Downs and lying just below an Iron Age hill fort, it is the oldest of several white horses carved in Wiltshire. It was restored in 1778, an action which may have obliterated another horse that had occupied the same slope. A contemporary engraving from around 1772 appears to show a horse facing in the opposite direction that was rather smaller than the present figure. There is, however, no documentation or other evidence for the existence of a chalk horse at Westbury before 1772.

The horse is tall and wide and has been adopted as a symbol for the town of Westbury, appearing on welcome signs and the logo of its tourist information centre. It is also considered a symbol for Wiltshire as a whole.

== Origins ==
Although it is the oldest of the Wiltshire white horses, the origin of Westbury White Horse is obscure. It is often claimed to commemorate King Alfred&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Ethandun in 878, and while this is quite plausible, there is no trace of such a legend before the second half of the 18th century. Perhaps more believable is a theory that it was created at a much later date to commemorate this early &quot;English victory&quot;, particularly as King Alfred had a very strong following in England from the 17th century onwards, see for example King Alfred&#x27;s Tower.

Historians have generally located the battle of Ethandun or Edington on the high ground, somewhere within a few kilometres of the white horse, which would have been a strong defensive position for Alfred and the Saxons of Wessex, marching north-east from Egbert&#x27;s Stone (popularly believed to be located at Kingston Deverill or King Alfred&#x27;s Tower nearby), whilst facing the Danes led by Guthram, advancing south-west from their stronghold in Chippenham. It is popularly believed that Bratton Castle, the Iron Age hillfort immediately adjacent to the white horse may have played some part in the battle, but there is no evidence of this, and the &#x27;fortress&#x27; referenced in Medieval texts is much more likely to have been the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Chippenham, which had been occupied by Guthram&#x27;s Danes as their headquarters. Local legend asserts that the defeated Danes fled down the slopes to the springs that rise between the villages of Bratton and Edington (after which the battle was named), and the slopes on which the white horse is located. Again, according to local legend, many exhausted Danes were massacred in the woods and boggy ground there by pursuing Saxons, the survivors fleeing north-eastwards, pursued by Alfred&#x27;s men all the way to Chippenham. However, there are some who dispute this account and believe this key battle was fought elsewhere, as there is very little real evidence either way, it remains contested, although the majority agree the vicinity of Edington is the most likely, and logical site.

A local site, just to the north-east of the white horse is Luccombe Vale, which has a locally famed &#x27;bloodstone&#x27; said to be connected with the massacre of Danish prisoners after the battle.

According to local tradition, the current white horse was cut in 1778 by a Mr Gee, who overlaid a smaller, older chalk figure, believed to also have been a horse, the only surviving image of which dates to 1772, and shows a figure facing the other way with a long tail. During the 19th and early 20th Centuries the figure was periodically reshaped and repaired.

Another hillside chalk figure, the Uffington White Horse, featured in King Alfred&#x27;s early life. He was born in the Vale of White Horse, not far from Uffington in Oxfordshire. Unlike the recorded history of Westbury, documents as early as the eleventh century refer to the &quot;White Horse Hill&quot; at Uffington (&quot;mons albi equi&quot;), and archaeological work has dated the Uffington White Horse to the Bronze Age, although it is not certain that it was originally intended to represent a horse.

A white horse war standard was associated with the continental Saxons in the Dark Ages, and the figures of Hengest and Horsa who, according to legend, led the first Anglo-Saxon invaders into England, are said to have fought under a white horse standard (a claim recalled in the heraldic badge of the county of Kent).

During the 18th century, the white horse was a heraldic symbol associated with the new British royal family, the House of Hanover, and it is argued by some scholars that Westbury White Horse may have first been carved in the early 18th century as a symbol of loyalty to the new Protestant reigning house.

In &quot;Alfred and the Great White Horse of Wiltshire&quot; (1939), the Downside Abbey monk Dom Illtyd Trethowan debunked the suggested connection of the White Horse with Alfred and the Battle of Ethandune. Paul Newman suggests in his book &quot;Lost Gods of Albion&quot; (2009) that the horse may have been inspired by the popularity of folly buildings in the 18th century.

Wiltshire folklore has it that when the nearby Bratton church clock strikes midnight, the white horse goes down to the Bridewell Springs, below the hill, to drink.

== Modern history ==

By 1872 the horse was considered to have lost its shape, by the chalk repeatedly growing over and being re-cut. In 1873 it was remodelled by a committee, and at the same time substantial edging-stones were added all around the perimeter, to prevent the shape from changing again.

During the Second World War, the chalk of the horse was turfed over to prevent German pilots from using it for navigation. Nearby Westbury was considered to be a potential target as a railway hub.

The horse was illuminated at night in 1900 and again in 1950, both times using army equipment. For the 1950 event, which used World War Two searchlights, traffic in Westbury and Bratton came almost to a standstill as drivers slowed down to look.
 In 1928, the horse was used as inspiration for the design of the Litlington White Horse in East Sussex, which until 1983, when it was changed from a standing position to a prancing position, was visually similar to the Westbury horse. 

In 1957 the horse was concreted over and painted white by Westbury Urban District Council, in an attempt to save on long-term maintenance costs, as the chalk of the face was eroding and unstable, due to the steepness of the slope. Since then, the concrete has tended to turn grey and deteriorate over time, requiring regular cleaning, as well as periodic repairs and repainting. It was thoroughly cleaned in 1993 and in 1995, the concrete facing from 1957 was replaced and repainted.

In 2003, the horse was vandalised when &quot;Stop This War&quot; was written in yellow across the horse in capital letters in protest of the Iraq War. After the words were removed, the horse was noticeably grey with a white horizontal strip where the message had been. In November 2006, the horse was repaired and repainted again. The newly whitened horse was illuminated on the night the repairs were finished, by Second World War searchlights, as in 1950.

In July 2010, the neck of the horse was vandalised when the word &quot;wonkey&quot; was written across it. This part of the neck had to be re-whitened in 2010, leading to the horse having a whiter neck than the rest of the body.

The BBC reported that the horse was to be cleaned again in 2012. Work began on 11 April 2012 and was completed on 19 April 2012. The cleaning coincided with the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. Celebrating the completion of the work, again the horse was lit up with searchlights. Since the annual Village Pump Festival moved from Farleigh Hungerford to the White Horse Country Park beneath the horse in 2012, the horse has been illuminated at night whilst the festival has been taking place. This is achieved via a tinted spotlight which changes colour every couple of seconds, so the horse appears different colours.

Two visitor information signs, on the hill above the horse and in the viewing area car park, were placed in 1999 following the completion of Devizes White Horse; the signs show all eight Wiltshire White Horses. Also on the side of the hill is a toposcope dated 1968, mounted on a small stone structure, which identifies the towns and cities that can be seen from the hillside. For the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, a fire beacon was placed to the side of the road on the top of the hill leading to the car park on 3 June 2002, that resembles the millennium beacons. It is lit to mark occasions such as the 70th anniversary of VE Day on 8 May 2015.

BBC News had a video in June 2018 showing the horse being cleaned with high pressure water jets by up to 18 volunteer abseilers. The cost was given as £3,000, paid for by Westbury Town Council. It stated that the previous clean was in 2016. In July 2023 the horse was cleaned, repainted and repaired again, with water used to clean off algae and dirt in a project funded by English Heritage. The cost was not made public, but the paint alone cost £25,000.

== Views ==
The Horse can be viewed from up to in all directions. From the horse, Westbury and Trowbridge can be closely observed. The Mendip TV Mast on the Mendip Hills in Somerset can be seen clearly to the west, particularly at night. From the top of the horse and Bratton Castle, Devizes White Horse and Alton Barnes White Horse can both be viewed. The horse itself cannot be seen from other hill figures. Two of the furthest views of the horse are said to be from Beckford&#x27;s Tower in Bath and from the tower of St Michael&#x27;s Church, Dundry near Bristol.

A car park on Bratton Road (B3098) which passes beneath the horse is known as Westbury White Horse Viewing Area. It has fifteen parking spaces and information boards on the horse.

In 1961 a chimney was built at the Blue Circle cement works about a mile and a half from the horse. The Blue Circle company was bought in 2001 by Lafarge and the chimney was last used in 2010: it was demolished on 18 September 2016. Some considered it an eyesore whilst others considered it a local icon, a debate covered by a BBC Wiltshire radio broadcast in 2011. The chimney was the most prominent feature of the view from the horse; some considered it to spoil views from the hill.

The landscape of the horse was threatened in 2013 when Wiltshire Council revealed plans for a potential three-lane bypass that would run within half a mile of the horse, with a business park and 550 new homes on green belt land. Some local residents, together with many from outside the town, were against the &quot;Swindonisation&quot; of their corner of West Wiltshire, although many residents felt that Westbury, as the only town on the A350 without a bypass and whose medieval heart was blighted by pollution and HGVs needed a bypass.

== Battle of Ethandun memorial ==

Although the horse is only presumed to commemorate King Alfred&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Ethandun, an official monument to the victory was erected atop the hill, adjacent to Bratton Camp. The monument does not have an official name but is known as the Battle of Ethandun memorial. It consists of a large sarsen stone (stone of remembrance) with a pebbled base, on which lies a metal commemorative plaque. The monument was unveiled 5 November 2000 by the 7th Marquess of Bath.

King Alfred&#x27;s Tower, near Stourhead, is the best known monument that was definitely built to celebrate King Alfred and his victory. The folly tower was erected in 1772, six years before the white horse was redesigned.

== In popular culture ==

The White Horse was referenced in G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;The Ballad of the White Horse&quot; (1911) and the books &quot;The Tontine&quot; (1955) by Thomas B. Costain, &quot;The Emigrants&quot; (1980) by Caribbean author George Lamming, and in the novel &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1992) by Michael Ondaatje, as the place where the sapper Kip learned how to deactivate bombs. Michael Morpurgo mentioned it as one of the inspirations for &quot;The Butterfly Lion&quot;.

The figure can be seen in the music video for Scottish guitarist Midge Ure&#x27;s 1996 single &quot;Breathe&quot;, and is featured in the current opening titles of the regional television news programme ITV News West Country. Furthermore, it featured in a 2015 Visit England tourist advertisement produced in association with the England rugby team.

The horse lends its name to White Horse Business Park outside Trowbridge and White Horse Country Park outside Westbury. The horse overlooks both parks. White Horse Way is also a name of a street in Westbury, and the town&#x27;s visitor centre features the horse in its logo, as does its golf club.

The horse was depicted by artist Eric Ravilious (1903–1942) in his watercolour paintings &quot;Train Landscape&quot; and &quot;The Westbury Horse&quot; 1939.

<text>Benjamin Andrew (December 16, 1790) was an American rice planter, slave-owner, and state politician in the Royal Province of Georgia, and later, the State of Georgia. He became heavily involved in supporting the Patriot cause in the American Revolution and was closely associated with other patriotic Georgia leaders, like Noble W. Jones, Button Gwinnett, Archibald Bulloch, Lyman Hall, George Walton, Lachlan McIntosh, Nathan Brownson, John Houstoun, John Adam Treutlen, Edward Telfair, Samuel Elbert, Richard Howley, William Few, and William Glascock.

==Early life==

He was born in either Dorchester County, South Carolina or Colleton County, South Carolina, around 1726. His father was John Andrew, who is believed to have come to South Carolina from the New England area around 1705. Benjamin was a member of the Dorchester, SC, Congregationalist Church, and re-located with that church when they elected to move, as an entire congregation with their Negro slaves, to Georgia in 1754.

The church established itself in Midway, Georgia that year. The community cleared the marshes and became a thriving community of rice planters. They built Midway Congregational Church, which became the center of both religious and civil gatherings for the tight-knit community.

In 1769, Benjamin was elected to the royal provincial legislature (the Commons House of Assembly) of Georgia representing Midway and St. John&#x27;s Parish (modern-day Liberty County). He served in the Commons through 1774.
In April 1773, the naturalist William Bartram visited Benjamin Andrew at his home in Midway and recorded the visit in his Travels book. 

==American Revolution==

On 27 Jul 1774, Benjamin Andrew was among those who responded to a notice in the local Georgia Gazette newspaper to meet at Tondee&#x27;s Tavern in Savannah, Georgia to discuss the political situation in the American colonies following the announcement of the “Intolerable Acts” and the closing of the port of Boston. Benjamin was appointed as one of 30 men to start Georgia&#x27;s Committee of Correspondence.
Unable to persuade the rest of the Province of Georgia to join the other colonies in boycotting British goods (as called for by the 1st Continental Congress), Benjamin Andrew joined with other like-minded Patriots from St. John&#x27;s Parish. They elected Dr. Lyman Hall to be their delegate to represent St. John&#x27;s in the Continental Congress. Arriving in Philadelphia on 13 May 1775, Dr. Hall presented his credentials and was admitted as the delegate from St. John&#x27;s Parish. Georgia finally joined the other colonies in sending delegates to the Continental Congress in July 1775.
In Feb 1776, Benjamin joined the Georgia Council of Safety. The Council of Safety had recently ousted the Royal Governor, Sir James Wright, who had fled to safety to a British warship off the Georgia coast. The Council of Safety became the de facto government of Georgia until a state constitution could be established. Benjamin became an active member of the Council. Shortly after he joined the Council occurred Georgia&#x27;s first armed conflict with the British, the &quot;Battle of the Rice Boats&quot; in Savannah harbor. After a small fight with the Americans, the British were successful in commandeering and sailing off with some of the rice cargo vessels. This incident galvanized the Council to begin fortifying Savannah and Sunbury, raising troops, and accumulating stores of ammunition for the defense of Georgia.

In May 1777, Georgia adopted its first state Constitution. John Adam Treutlen was elected Governor of Georgia. Benjamin Andrew was chosen president of the new Executive Council, which was the equivalent of a modern-day Lieutenant Governor. The primary concerns of the new state government for the next two years were possible British incursions from British Florida as well as problems with the Creek Indians on Georgia&#x27;s western fronter.

In Nov 1778, British and Loyalist units from St. Augustine, Florida conducted a raid in the Midway and Sunbury areas prior to the main British assault on Savannah in December. Benjamin, his family, and many others fled the region to South Carolina. The Midway Church was burned by the British. One month later, the British captured Savannah (Dec 1778). The British were able to restore the Royal government in Savannah and the surrounding areas by Mar 1779. What was left of the Georgia Patriot government retreated to Wilkes County in northern Georgia but was unable to govern effectively for the next 3 years. Benjamin Andrew and his family spent the next three years living as refugees in parts of South Carolina and Wilkes County.

In Jan 1780, Benjamin Andrew attended a short-lived meeting of the state (Patriot) General Assembly in Augusta, Georgia. He was elected to represent Georgia in the 2nd Continental Congress but was not able to travel to Philadelphia to take his seat.

Later that year, in May 1780, the reinstated Royal Government of Georgia retaliated against the Georgia Patriots&#x27; confiscation of Loyalist estates in 1778 by passing the High Treason and Disqualification Acts, also known as the Retaliatory Acts. These acts seized the property of prominent Georgia Patriots and disqualified them from ever holding public office in Georgia. Benjamin Andrew&#x27;s name is one of 151 names that appear on the Disqualification Act. His property was consequently seized by the Royal government. 

Most of Georgia was in a very weaken and lawless state during the years 1779–1781 as the Royal government could only effectively control the area around Savannah. The Americans were able to take back Augusta from the Loyalists in June 1781. With the American victory at Yorktown in Oct 1781, American fortunes began to rise, and Georgia leaders were able to begin rebuilding a state government.

State elections were held in Jan 1782, and Benjamin Andrew was again elected to office, representing Liberty County, and then elected to serve on the Executive Council. John Martin was elected as Governor of Georgia.
The British evacuated Savannah on 11 Jul 1782 and the exiled Georgia state government was able to resume their meetings in Savannah.

==Latter Life==

Benjamin Andrew continued to be a representative in the Georgia Legislature from 1782 through 1786, representing Liberty County. He also served as one of three Superior Court judges in Liberty County, along with George Walton. In 1787, he decided to leave Liberty County and purchased land in Richmond County, Georgia, near Augusta, and moved there with his family and Negro slaves. In Oct 1790, Benjamin was again elected to the state legislature as a representative for Richmond County. The Legislature met in Nov 1790 in Augusta and adjourned on 11 Dec 1790. Benjamin Andrew died 5 days later, on 16 Dec 1790, in Augusta.

==Family Life==

Benjamin Andrew was married 4 times.

His first wife, Elizabeth, died shortly after the birth of their 2nd son in 1753. Both boys lived to adulthood.

He married his second wife, Susanna Franklyn, in 1753. Together they had 5 children, but only one child, a daughter, survived infancy to live to adulthood. Susanna died in 1762. Such death of children and young mothers was common in the tidewater area of Georgia during this period. This has been attributed to the malarial-like conditions that existed around the rice plantations, either due to malaria or yellow-fever.

Later in 1762, Benjamin married Mary Philbin. They had 4 daughters, of which 3 survived to adulthood. Mary died in Jan 1787.

He married for the last (4th) time in 1788, Elizabeth Few Lee, a recent widow with 5 young children and 25 years his junior. Elizabeth was the sister of William Few, signer of the US Constitution for the state of Georgia. They had one boy and one girl. The boy, Moses Andrew, became a famous physician and Methodist preacher in Montgomery, Alabama. Elizabeth survived him and remarried for her 3rd time Thomas Bush.

<doc id="646346" wikidata="Q607446" url="?curid=646346" title="Skeuomorph">
<text>A skeuomorph (also spelled skiamorph, ) is a derivative object that retains ornamental design cues (attributes) from structures that were necessary in the original. Skeuomorphs are typically used to make something new feel familiar in an effort to speed understanding and acclimation. They employ elements that, while essential to the original object, serve no pragmatic purpose in the new system. Examples include pottery embellished with imitation rivets reminiscent of similar pots made of metal and a software calendar that imitates the appearance of binding on a paper desk calendar.

== Definition and purpose ==
The term &quot;skeuomorph&quot; is compounded from the Greek &quot;skeuos&quot; (σκεῦος), meaning &quot;container or tool&quot;, and &quot;morphḗ&quot; (μορφή), meaning &quot;shape&quot;. It has been applied to material objects since 1890. With the advent of graphical computer systems in the 1980s, skeuomorph is used to characterize the many &quot;old fashioned&quot; icons utilized in graphic user interfaces.

A similar alternative definition of skeuomorph is &quot;a physical ornament or design on an object made to resemble another material or technique&quot;. This definition is broader in scope, as it can be applied to design elements that still serve the same function as they did in a previous design.

Skeuomorphs may be deliberately employed to make a new design more familiar and comfortable or may be the result of cultural influences and norms on the designer. They may be the artistic expression on the part of the designer. The usability researcher and academic Don Norman describes skeuomorphism in terms of cultural constraints: interactions with a system that are learned only through culture. Norman also popularized perceived affordances, where the user can tell what an object provides or does based on its appearance, which skeuomorphism can make easy.

The concept of skeuomorphism overlaps with other design concepts. Mimesis is an imitation, coming directly from the Greek word. Archetype is the original idea or model that is emulated, where the emulations can be skeuomorphic. Skeuomorphism is parallel to, but different from, path dependence in technology, where an element&#x27;s functional behavior is maintained even when the original reasons for its design no longer exist.

== Physical examples==
Many features of wooden buildings were repeated in stone by the Ancient Greeks when they transitioned from wood to masonry construction. Decorative stone features in the Doric order of classical architecture in Greek temples such as triglyphs, mutules, guttae, and modillions are supposed to be derived from true structural and functional features of the early wooden temples. The triglyph and guttae are seen as recreating, respectively, the carved beam-ends and six wooden pegs driven in to secure the beam in place. 
Historically, high-status items such as the Minoans&#x27; elaborate and expensive silver cups were recreated for a wider market using pottery, a cheaper material. The exchange of shapes between metalwork and ceramics, often from the former to the latter, is near-constant in the history of the decorative arts. Sometimes pellets of clay are used to evoke the rivets of the metal originals.

There is also evidence of skeuomorphism in material transitions. Leather and pottery often carry over features from the wooden counterparts of previous generations. Clay pottery has also been found bearing rope-shaped protrusions, pointing to craftsmen seeking familiar shapes and processes while working with new materials. Another example is the tiny, non-functional handle on glass maple syrup bottles, which evoke stoneware jug handles. In this context, skeuomorphs exist as traits sought in other objects, either for their social desirability or psychological comforts.

In the modern era, cheaper plastic items often attempt to mimic more expensive wooden and metal products, though they are only skeuomorphic if new ornamentation references the original functionality, such as molded screw heads in molded plastic items. Another well-known skeuomorph is the plastic Adirondack chair. The lever on a mechanical slot machine, or &quot;one-armed bandit&quot;, is a skeuomorphic throwback feature when it appears on a modern video slot machine, since it is no longer required to set physical mechanisms and gears into motion. Articles of clothing are also given skeuomorphic treatment; for example, faux buckles on certain strap shoes such as Mary Janes for small children, which permit the retention of the original aesthetic but otherwise use velcro fastening for children to wear more easily.

Automotive design has historically been full of physical skeuomorphisms, such as the transformation from wooden framed and bodied early vehicles produced by coachworks to those which incorporated both functional wood and steel (referred to as &quot;woodies&quot;) to, ultimately, simulated vinyl woodgrain cladding entirely for style by the 1960s. Other examples include thinly faux chrome-plated plastic components and imitation leather, gold, interior wood, pearl, or crystal jeweled elements. In &quot;The Design of Everyday Things&quot;, Don Norman notes that early automobiles were designed after horse-drawn carriages. Indeed, the early automobile design Horsey Horseless even included a wooden horse head on the front to try to minimize scaring the real animals. In the 1970s, opera windows and vinyl roofs on many luxury sedan cars similarly imitated carriage work from the horse and buggy era. , most electric cars feature prominent front grilles, even though there is little need for intake of air to cool an absent internal combustion engine.

== Virtual examples==
Many computer programs have a skeuomorphic graphical user interface that emulates the aesthetics of physical objects. Examples include a digital contact list resembling a Rolodex, and IBM&#x27;s 1998 RealThings package. A more extreme example is found in some music synthesis and audio processing software packages, which closely emulate physical musical instruments and audio equipment complete with buttons and dials. On a smaller scale, the icons of GUIs may remain skeuomorphic representations of physical objects, such as an image of a physical paper folder to represent computer files in the desktop metaphor. This is even the case for items that are no longer directly applicable to the task they represent (such as a drawing of a floppy disk to represent &quot;save&quot;).

Apple Inc., while under the direction of Steve Jobs, was known for its wide usage of skeuomorphic designs in various applications. This changed after Jobs&#x27;s death when Scott Forstall, described as &quot;the most vocal and high-ranking proponent of the visual design style favored by Mr. Jobs&quot;, resigned. Apple designer Jonathan Ive took over some of Forstall&#x27;s responsibilities and had &quot;made his distaste for the visual ornamentation in Apple&#x27;s mobile software known within the company&quot;. With the announcement of iOS 7 at WWDC in 2013, Apple officially shifted from skeuomorphism to a more simplified design, thus beginning the so-called &quot;death of skeuomorphism&quot; at Apple. Skeuomorphism is a key component of Frutiger Aero, an Internet aesthetic derived from mid-2000s user interface designs.

Other virtual skeuomorphs do not employ literal images of some physical object; but rather allude to ritual human heuristics or heuristic motifs, such as slider bars that emulate linear potentiometers and visual tabs that behave like physical tabbed file folders. Another example is the swiping hand gesture for turning the &quot;pages&quot; or screens of a tablet display.

Virtual skeuomorphs can also be auditory. The shutter-click sound emitted by most camera phones when taking a picture is an auditory skeuomorph. Another familiar example is the paper-crumpling sound when a document is trashed.

== In design ==

Retrofuturism incorporates visual motifs from old predictions of the future, especially Skeuomorphic design is frequently incorporated in retrowave or synthwave illustrations. Skeuomorphic design is closely linked with metamodernism.

Skeuomorphic design seems to be preferred by older recipient groups, often referred to as &quot;digital immigrants&quot;, while &quot;digital natives&quot; tend to favor flat design over skeuomorphisms. However, younger people are still able to understand the signifiers that skeuomorphic design employs. A better user experience could be measured for each respective design philosophy among digital natives and immigrants.

=== Arguments in favor ===
An argument in favor of skeuomorphic design in digital devices is that signifiers to affordances help those familiar with the original item learn to use the digital version. Interaction paradigms for computer devices are culturally entrenched; proposals for change often spawn debate. Don Norman describes this process as a form of cultural heritage, and credits skeuomorphism with easing transitions to newer technology, stating that it &quot;gives comfort and makes learning easier&quot; until the newer devices no longer need to resemble their predecessors.

Compared to flat design, skeuomorphic design seems to facilitate a fast navigation through graphic user interfaces, because icons are more easily recognized and less abstract than their minimalistic counterparts found in flat design.

=== Arguments against ===
The arguments against virtual skeuomorphic design are that skeuomorphic interface elements are harder to operate and take up more screen space than standard interface elements, that this breaks operating system interface design standards, that it causes an inconsistent look and feel between applications, that skeuomorphic interface elements rarely incorporate numeric input or feedback for accurately setting a value, that many users may have no experience with the original device being emulated, that skeuomorphic design can increase cognitive load with visual noise that after a few uses gives little or no value to the user, that skeuomorphic design limits creativity by grounding the user experience to physical counterparts, and that skeuomorphic designs often do not accurately represent underlying system state or data types due to inappropriate mimesis. For example, an analog gauge interface may be read less precisely than a digital one.

<text>Kachaks (, / &quot;kačaci&quot;) is a term used for the Albanian rebels active in the late 19th and early 20th century in northern Albania, Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia, and later as a term for the militias of Albanian revolutionary organizations against the Kingdom of Serbia (1910–18) Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–24), called the &quot;Kachak Movement&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from Turkish &quot;&quot; for &quot;outlaw&quot;.

==Background==
==History==
===1920–24 Kachak movement===
The Committee for the National Defense of Kosovo () was created in Shkodër, under Hasan Prishtina, in 1918. The committee organizationally and financially supported the kachaks in Albanian-populated areas of Yugoslavia, in Kosovo and Skopje (the former Kosovo vilayet). Kachaks were also active around Ohrid and Bitola. On 6 May 1919 the Committee called for a general uprising in Kosovo and other Albanian-inhabited regions in Yugoslavia. The Kachaks were popular among Albanians, and local support to them increased in the 1920s when Hasan Prishtina became a member of the Albanian parliament, Kadri Prishtina (&quot;Hoxhe Kadriu&quot;) became Minister of Justice, and Bajram Curri became Minister of war (1921). All three were Kosovar Albanians.

During this time, Kosovar Albanians under Azem Galica began an armed struggle, also known as the &quot;Kachak movement&quot;, a large-scale revolt in Drenica involving around 10,000 people under Galica. The uprising was quelled by the Royal Yugoslav Army Armed conflicts between the Royal Yugoslav Army and the Kachaks took place in the years 1920 and 1921, 1923, with a revival in 1924. One of the achievements was the creation of the &quot;neutral zone&quot; around Junik, which would serve to jeopardize the frontier and provide ammunition and other logistical support for the Kachaks.

==Legacy==
They are widely depicted in Albanian folklore. Albanian collaborationists in Yugoslavia during World War II were also sometimes known as &quot;Kachaks&quot;.

<text>Charles &quot;Don&quot; Alias (December 25, 1939 – March 28, 2006) was an American jazz percussionist.

Alias was best known for playing congas and other hand drums. He was, however, a capable drum kit performer: for example, Alias played drums on the song &quot;Miles Runs the Voodoo Down&quot; from trumpeter Miles Davis&#x27;s album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; (1969) when neither Lenny White nor Jack DeJohnette was able to play the marching band-inspired rhythm requested by Davis. He also played drums and percussion on the Joni Mitchell live album &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;.

Alias performed on hundreds of recordings and was perhaps best known for his associations with Miles Davis and saxophonist David Sanborn, though he also performed and recorded with artists such as Weather Report, Joni Mitchell, Herbie Hancock, the Brecker Brothers, Jaco Pastorius, Pat Metheny, Nina Simone, and many others.

== Early life ==
Alias was born in New York City on December 25, 1939. 

He studied piano and guitar as a boy but turned to percussion, using the rhythms he learned on New York&#x27;s streets and one-on-one lessons with the percussionist Mongo Santamaria as a foundation. At 16 years old, he was enrolled as a conga player for the Eartha Kitt Dance Foundation when he landed his first professional gig playing with Dizzy Gillespie at the Newport Jazz Festival.

He had a degree in biology, studying at Gannon College and the Carnegie Institute for Biochemistry in Boston. He followed this degree at the insistence of his mother, who wanted him to have a career besides music to fall back on. During his time in Boston, he played in jazz night clubs, where he met students from the Berklee College of Music, which aided him in entering the music industry.

== Career ==

=== Touring with Stone Alliance ===
While at school in Boston, Alias met bassist Gene Perla, with whom he formed the jazz trio Stone Alliance in 1964. The group, which included saxophonist Steve Grossman, centered on jazz, Afro-Cuban, rock, and pop music.

In 1976, the trio began a 15-day tour in Chile, through the US State Department Jazz Diplomacy program. The initial leg with 10 locations in Chile extended into a 6-month tour with stops in Uruguay, Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. 

The group totaled 2 South American tours, 4 European tours, and 2 in Canada. The band recorded four studio albums between 1976 and 1980, with live albums from Amsterdam, Buenos Aires, Berlin, and Bremen. After a 13-year hiatus, the group returned as a power trio with guitarist Mitch Stein playing 2 notable shows in New York City.

=== Work with Miles Davis and others ===

His work with Nina Simone caught the eye of Miles Davis, who recruited him to play trap-set drums on &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;. His impact as a percussionist was not lost among the A-list group responsible for this album, as critics and journalists have recounted that &quot;the heart of Bitches Brew is that driving rhythm section&quot; and &quot;is in many ways the revolutionary art the album is famed for.&quot; Alias played alongside Jack DeJohnette and utilized a &quot;lean and loose&quot; syncopation, which drew from New Orleans parade tunes.

Alias&#x27; most prominent work was with saxophonist David Sanborn, for whom he worked as a stage and studio member for nearly 20 years. During these sessions and beyond, he paid careful attention to detail and had a dedication to the improvement of every member of the group. Sanborn remarked that Alias would consistently come to sessions offering specific improvements based on the previous day&#x27;s work. Sanborn says &quot;[Alias] immersed himself 100 percent in the music, and he gave his all to the music.”

His work reached its widest audience as the drummer for Joni Mitchell&#x27;s live album &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;, which notably features his drum kit on the cover. For Mitchell&#x27;s second live album, she recruited many well-known jazz artists, such as Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Lyle Mays, and Michael Brecker. Alias also served as the studio percussionist for Mitchell&#x27;s early jazz-influenced albums. On &quot;Don Juan&#x27;s Reckless Daughter&quot;, he played congas, claves, snare drums, and sandpaper blocks; he also provided some background vocals. Alias played congas on the &quot;Mingus&quot; album.
== Style and influence ==
Alias credited his playing style to Cuban and Puerto Rican hand drummers, whose techniques he said he picked up from the streets of New York. From this background, he often played congas, bongos, and other hand drums, rather than a traditional drum kit. 

Gene Perla was responsible for introducing Alias to singer-songwriter Nina Simone, for whom he switched gears and played a traditional full-set drum kit. This change did not present a challenge; instead, Alias thrived and eventually became her musical director.

== Death ==
After his long career as a sideman (and just before a planned tour with David Sanborn), Alias passed away at his home on March 28, 2006, at age 66. Alias is survived by his son, Charles Donald Alias Jr.; his daughter, Kimberlee Marisa Alias; and four grandchildren.

<text>Georges Guynemer (, 24 December 1894 – 11 September 1917 MIA) was the second highest-scoring French fighter ace with 54 victories during World War I, and a French national hero at the time of his death. Guynemer&#x27;s death was a profound shock to France.

==Early life and military career==
Georges Marie Ludovic Jules Guynemer was born in Paris to a wealthy and aristocratic family. His father was Paul Guynemer (1860-1922), a former officer of Saint-Cyr. His mother, Julie Noémi Doynel de Saint-Quentin (1866-1957), belonged to the old Norman nobility and was a descendant of Charles of Valois, founder of the royal house of Valois. Guynemer experienced an often sickly childhood. Nevertheless, he succeeded as an aviator through his enormous drive and self-confidence.

He was originally rejected five times for military service due to frailty, but was accepted for training as a mechanic in late 1914. With determination, he gained acceptance to pilot training, joining &quot;Escadrille&quot; MS.3 on 8 June 1915. He remained in the same unit for his entire service. The first plane allocated to him was a Morane-Saulnier L monoplane previously flown by Charles Bonnard, and accordingly named &quot;Vieux Charles&quot; (&quot;Old Charles&quot;). Guynemer kept the name and continued to use it for most of his later aircraft. On 19 July 1915, he shot down his first plane, a German Aviatik.

On 5 December 1915, the &quot;Escadrille&quot; MS.3 was renamed the &quot;Escadrille&quot; N.3, after being re-equipped with new Nieuport 10 fighters. Flying the more effective plane, Guynemer quickly established himself as one of France&#x27;s premier fighter pilots. He became an ace, with his fifth victory coming in February 1916, and was promoted to lieutenant in March. On 12 March 1916 he scored his 8th victory. At the end of the year, his score had risen to 25. Capitaine Brocard, commander of &quot;Escadrille&quot; N.3 (&quot;Storks&quot;), described Guynemer at that time as &quot;...my most brilliant Stork.&quot; Less than a year later, Guynemer was promoted to captain and commander of the Storks squadron.
Guynemer became influential enough to affect French fighter aircraft design. In December 1916, he wrote a letter to the chief designer at Spad, criticizing the Spad VII as inferior to the German Halberstadt that was its contemporary. As a consequence, Spad developed two new but very similar models, the SPAD XII and SPAD XIII. The new models were promising, but had teething problems with the reduction gear between engine and propeller.

On 23 January 1917 Guynemer scored a &quot;double&quot; credit of victories 26 and 27, first shooting down an Albatros C piloted by Captain Martin Korner, who was killed, followed by a Rumpler C I of Flieger-Abteilung (A) 216 piloted by Lt. Bernhard Röder and his observer Lt. Otto von Schanzenbach who were both killed. On 26 January 1917 Guynemer forced down an Albatros C.VII of Flieger-Abteilung (A) 226 whose crew was captured for his 30th credit. On 8 February 1917, flying a SPAD VII, Guynemer became the first Allied pilot to shoot down a German Gotha bomber, his 31st victory. On 16 March 1917 he brought down his 32nd credit, a Roland D.II of Jasta 32 whose pilot was captured. On 14 April 1917 he downed his 36th credit, by killing a crew from Flieger-Abteilung (A) 254. His highest scoring month was May 1917, when he downed seven German aircraft including a quadruple credit on 25 May. By July, he began to fly the Spad XII; his &quot;avion magique&quot; was, at his behest, armed with a cannon whose barrel fired through the propeller shaft. It was also armed with a air-cooled Vickers machine gun. Although the cannon promised devastating firepower, the new plane was a handful because of it, as the cannon&#x27;s rearwards-protruding breech mandated separate aileron and elevator controls split from each other on opposing sides of the cockpit. The single shot cannon had to also be manually reloaded in flight; it had a heavy recoil when fired and filled the canopy with fumes with every shot. The Spad XII was not a plane for a novice pilot. However, Guynemer used it to down an Albatros fighter on 27 July, and a DFW the next day. The latter triumph made him the first French ace to attain 50 victories, with headlines such as &quot;Fifty machines destroyed! This had been Guynemer&#x27;s dream!&quot; written in the newspapers.
==Death==

Guynemer failed to return from a combat mission on 11 September 1917. The previous week had been one of mechanical ills, in both his assigned aircraft and the ones he borrowed. At 08:30, with rookie pilot Jean Bozon-Verduraz, Guynemer took off in his Spad XIII S.504 n°2. His mission was to patrol the Langemark area. At 09:25, near Poelkapelle, Guynemer sighted a lone Rumpler, a German observation plane, and dove toward it. Bozon-Verduraz saw several Fokkers above him, and by the time he had shaken them off, his leader was nowhere in sight, so he returned alone. Guynemer never came back.

Guynemer was confirmed missing in action by his squadron commander Major Brocard; it was officially announced in Paris by the French War Department on 25 September 1917. Unofficial confirmation came from a captured German pilot who was shot down behind Canadian lines the evening of 29 September. A German sergeant from the 413th Regiment swore he had witnessed the crash and identified Guynemer&#x27;s corpse; he also certified that he had died from a bullet through the head, with other injuries including a broken leg and a finger shot away. The German party retrieving the body was driven away by Allied artillery fire before they could bury or remove the body. The 25 September details released by the French War Department were unclassified and became public knowledge as described by one of his flying comrades (name withheld due to security reasons):

Guynemer sighted five machines of the Albatros type D-3. Without hesitation, he bore down on them. At that moment enemy patrolling machines, soaring at a great height, appeared suddenly and fell upon Guynemer. There were forty enemy machines in the air at this time, including Baron von Richthofen and his circus division of machines, painted in diagonal blue and white stripes. Toward Guynemer&#x27;s right some Belgian machines hove in sight, but it was too late. Guynemer must have been hit. His machine dropped gently toward the Earth, and I lost track of it. All that I can say is that the machine was not on fire.

Additional details were furnished by Major Brocard, as listed in an article from the Paris &quot;Le Matin&quot;:

The last fight of the French aviator occurred four or five miles inside the German lines northeast of Ypres and opposite the British lines. Captain Guynemer was accompanied by Lieutenant Bozon Verduraz, who says that they were flying at a height of 15,000 feet when Guynemer sighted an enemy two-seater, which he attacked. Almost at the same moment Verduraz saw four German monoplanes approaching and turned toward them instantly so as to draw them off. They circled around for a while and then disappeared. Verduraz then returned to the place where he had left Guynemer engaged with the German biplane, but Guynemer had vanished.

The two-seater, described as a Rumpler type by Bozon-Verduraz, has never been identified, but recent research shows that it could have been a machine flown by Lt. d. R. Max Psaar (observer) and Fl. Georg Seibert (pilot) from FA(A)224. German ace Kurt Wissemann of Jasta 3 was credited with the victory. Wissemann would himself be killed in action little more than two weeks later on 28 September 1917.

According to an American Red Cross communique from the French front, the death of Guynemer was determined to be &quot;definitely confirmed&quot;. This Red Cross report provided these details:

Information received by the Red Cross says Guynemer was shot through the head north of Poelcapelle, on the Ypres front. His body was identified by a photograph on his pilot&#x27;s license found in his pocket. The burial took place at Brussels in the presence of a guard of honor, composed of the 5th Prussian Division. Such is the story told by a Belgian, who has just escaped from the Germans. The burial was about to take place at Poelcapelle, when the bombardment preceding the British attack at Ypres started. The burying party hastily withdrew, taking the body with them. The German General chanced to be an aviation enthusiast with a great admiration for Captain Guynemer&#x27;s achievements. At his direction the body was taken to Brussels in a special funeral car. Thither the captain was carried by non-commissioned officers and was covered with floral tributes from German aviators. The Prussian Guards stood at salute upon its arrival and during the burial, which was given all possible military honors. The French Government has been invited to place in the Pantheon, where many great Frenchmen are buried, an inscription to perpetuate the memory of Captain Guynemer as &#x27;a symbol of the aspirations and enthusiasm of the Army.&#x27; A resolution to this effect has been introduced in the Chamber of Deputies by Deputy Lasies.

Guynemer had 54 victories at the time of his death.


==Legacy==
Guynemer was lionized by the French press and became a national hero. The French government encouraged the publicity to boost morale and take the people&#x27;s minds off the terrible losses in the trenches. Guynemer was embarrassed by the attention, but his shyness only increased the public&#x27;s appetite to know everything about him. This was quite different later in 1918 with the French top ace René Fonck, who despite having 75 confirmed victories, had bad publicity for his arrogance and shameless self-promotion. Guynemer&#x27;s death was a profound shock to France; nevertheless, he remained an icon for the duration of the war. Only 22 at his death, he continued to inspire the nation with his advice, &quot;Until one has given all, one has given nothing.&quot;

The Paris street rue Guynemer is named after him as is a school in Compiègne, the Institution Guynemer.
A statue is erected in Poelcapelle in commemoration of Georges Guynemer.

The episode &quot;The Last Flight&quot; (1960) from season one of the American television series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; was loosely based on the disappearance of Guynemer put to fictional speculation as to what happened to him.

He was decorated Order of Karađorđe&#x27;s Star with swords and a number of other decorations.

<doc id="646359" wikidata="Q300897" url="?curid=646359" title="Bc (programming language)">
<text>bc, for &quot;basic calculator&quot;, is &quot;an arbitrary-precision calculator language&quot; with syntax similar to the C programming language. bc is typically used as either a mathematical scripting language or as an interactive mathematical shell.

==Overview==
A typical interactive usage is typing the command codice_1 on a Unix command prompt and entering a mathematical expression, such as , whereupon will be output. While bc can work with arbitrary precision, it actually defaults to zero digits after the decimal point, so the expression yields (results are truncated, not rounded). This can surprise new bc users unaware of this fact. The option to bc sets the default &quot;scale&quot; (digits after the decimal point) to 20 and adds several additional mathematical functions to the language.

==History==
bc first appeared in Version 6 Unix in 1975. It was written by Lorinda Cherry of Bell Labs as a front end to dc, an arbitrary-precision calculator written by Robert Morris and Cherry. dc performed arbitrary-precision computations specified in reverse Polish notation. bc provided a conventional programming-language interface to the same capability via a simple compiler (a single yacc source file comprising a few hundred lines of code), which converted a C-like syntax into dc notation and piped the results through dc.

In 1991, POSIX rigorously defined and standardized bc. Four implementations of this standard survive today: The first is the traditional Unix implementation, a front-end to dc, which survives in Unix and Plan 9 systems. The second is the free software GNU bc, first released in 1991 by Philip A. Nelson. The GNU implementation has numerous extensions beyond the POSIX standard and is no longer a front-end to dc (it is a bytecode interpreter). The third is a re-implementation by OpenBSD in 2003. The fourth is an independent implementation by Gavin Howard that is included in Android (operating system), FreeBSD as of 13.3-RELEASE, and macOS as of 13.0.

==Implementations==
===POSIX bc===
The POSIX standardized bc language is traditionally written as a program in the dc programming language to provide a higher level of access to the features of the dc language without the complexities of dc&#x27;s terse syntax.

In this form, the bc language contains single-letter variable, array and function names and most standard arithmetic operators, as well as the familiar control-flow constructs (codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4) from C. Unlike C, an codice_5 clause may not be followed by an codice_6.

Functions are defined using a codice_7 keyword, and values are returned from them using a codice_8 followed by the return value in parentheses. The codice_9 keyword (optional in C) is used to declare a variable as local to a function.

All numbers and variable contents are arbitrary-precision numbers whose precision (in decimal places) is determined by the global codice_10 variable.

The numeric base of input (in interactive mode), output and program constants may be specified by setting the reserved codice_11 (input base) and codice_12 (output base) variables.

Output is generated by deliberately not assigning the result of a calculation to a variable.

Comments may be added to bc code by use of the C codice_13 and codice_14 (start and end comment) symbols.

====Mathematical operators====

=====Exactly as C=====
The following POSIX bc operators behave exactly like their C counterparts:
 += -= *= /=
 == != &lt;= &gt;=

=====Similar to C=====
The modulus operators, codice_15 and codice_16 behave exactly like their C counterparts only when the global codice_10 variable is set to 0, i.e. all calculations are integer-only. Otherwise the computation is done with the appropriate scale. codice_18 is defined as codice_19. Examples:

$ bc
bc 1.06
Copyright 1991-1994, 1997, 1998, 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
For details type `warranty&#x27;.
scale=0; 5%3
2
scale=1; 5%3
.2
scale=20; 5%3
.00000000000000000002
=====Conflicting with C=====
The operators

superficially resemble the C bitwise exclusive-or operators, but are in fact the bc integer exponentiation operators.

Of particular note, the use of the codice_20 operator with negative numbers does not follow the C operator precedence. codice_21 gives the answer of 4 under bc rather than −4.

=====&quot;Missing&quot; operators relative to C=====
The bitwise, Boolean and conditional operators:
 &amp;= |= ^= &amp;&amp;= ||=
 «= »=

are not available in POSIX bc.

====Built-in functions====
The codice_22 function for calculating square roots is POSIX bc&#x27;s only built-in mathematical function. Other functions are available in an external standard library.

The codice_23 function for determining the precision (as with the codice_10 variable) of its argument and the codice_25 function for determining the number of significant decimal digits in its argument are also built-in.

====Standard library functions====
bc&#x27;s standard math library (defined with the -l option) contains functions for calculating sine, cosine, arctangent, natural logarithm, the exponential function and the two parameter Bessel function &quot;J&quot;. Most standard mathematical functions (including the other inverse trigonometric functions) can be constructed using these. See external links for implementations of many other functions.
The -l option changes the scale to 20, so things such as modulo may work unexpectedly. For example, writing codice_26 and then the command codice_27 outputs 0. But writing codice_28 after codice_26 and then the command codice_27 will output 1.

===Plan 9 bc===
Plan 9 bc is identical to POSIX bc but for an additional codice_31 statement.

===GNU bc===
GNU bc derives from the POSIX standard and includes many extensions. It is entirely separate from dc-based implementations of the POSIX standard and is instead written in C. Nevertheless, it is fully backwards compatible as all POSIX bc programs will run unmodified as GNU bc programs.

GNU bc variables, arrays and function names may contain more than one character, some more operators have been included from C, and notably, an codice_5 clause may be followed by an codice_6.

Output is achieved either by deliberately not assigning a result of a calculation to a variable (the POSIX way) or by using the added codice_31 statement.

Furthermore, a codice_35 statement allows the interactive input of a number into a running calculation.

In addition to C-style comments, a codice_36 character will cause everything after it until the next new-line to be ignored.

The value of the last calculation is always stored within the additional built-in codice_37 variable.

====Extra operators====
The following logical operators are additional to those in POSIX bc:

They are available for use in conditional statements (such as within an codice_5 statement). Note, however, that there are still no equivalent bitwise or assignment operations.

====Functions====
All functions available in GNU bc are inherited from POSIX. No further functions are provided as standard with the GNU distribution.

==Example code==
Since the bc codice_20 operator only allows an integer power to its right, one of the first functions a bc user might write is a power function with a floating-point exponent. Both of the below assume the standard library has been included:

===A &quot;power&quot; function in POSIX bc===

 /* A function to return the integer part of x */
 define i(x) {
 auto s
 s = scale
 scale = 0
 x /= 1 /* round x down */
 scale = s
 return (x)

 /* Use the fact that x^y == e^(y*log(x)) */
 define p(x,y) {
 if (y == i(y)) {
 return (x ^ y)
 return ( e( y * l(x) ) )


===Calculating π to 10000 digits===
Calculate pi using the builtin arctangent function, :

$ bc -lq
scale=10000
4*a(1) # The atan of 1 is 45 degrees, which is pi/4 in radians.
 # This may take several minutes to calculate.
===A translated C function===
Because the syntax of bc is similar to that of C, published numerical functions written in C can often be translated into bc quite easily, which immediately provides the arbitrary precision of bc. For example, in the Journal of Statistical Software (July 2004, Volume 11, Issue 5), George Marsaglia published the following C code for the cumulative normal distribution:
double Phi(double x)
 long double s=x,t=0,b=x,q=x*x,i=1;
 while(s!=t)
 s=(t=s)+(b*=q/(i+=2));
 return .5+s*exp(-.5*q-.91893853320467274178L);


With some necessary changes to accommodate bc&#x27;s different syntax, and noting that the constant &quot;0.9189...&quot; is actually log(2*PI)/2, this can be translated to the following GNU bc code:
define phi(x) {
 auto s,t,b,q,i,const
 s=x; t=0; b=x; q=x*x; i=1
 while(s!=t)
 s=(t=s)+(b*=q/(i+=2))
 const=0.5*l(8*a(1)) # 0.91893...
 return .5+s*e(-.5*q-const)


==Using bc in shell scripts==
bc can be used non-interactively, with input through a pipe. This is useful inside shell scripts. For example:

$ result=$(echo &quot;scale=2; 5 * 7 /3;&quot; | bc)
$ echo $result
11.66

In contrast, note that the bash shell only performs integer arithmetic, e.g.:

$ result=$((5 * 7 /3))
$ echo $result
11

One can also use the here-string idiom (in bash, ksh, csh):

$ bc -l «&lt; &quot;5*7/3&quot;
11.66666666666666666666

<text>Arena are an English neo-prog band founded in 1995. Their style ranges from symphonic to hard rock.

== History ==
Arena was founded in 1995 by Clive Nolan keyboardist of Pendragon and Shadowland, and Mick Pointer, the original drummer of Marillion, whose tenure lasting from 1979 until 1983. The other founding members of the band were guitarist Keith More, vocalist John Carson, and bassist Cliff Orsi. Orsi was replaced by John Jowitt (of IQ) in the band&#x27;s inaugural year, whilst Carson and More left the band in 1996 and 1997, and were replaced by Paul Wrightson and John Mitchell (of Frost*) respectively.

Both Jowitt and Wrightson left the band in 1998, to be replaced by Ian Salmon and Rob Sowden, creating the band&#x27;s most stable lineup to date (from 1998 until 2010). This lineup came to an end with Paul Manzi replacing Sowden in 2010. In 2011, Jowitt rejoined the band to replace the departing Salmon, leaving again in 2014 and being replaced by Kylan Amos. In July 2020, Manzi was replaced by Damian Wilson.

Most of the band&#x27;s lyrics are written by Nolan, though Pointer contributed lyrics to Sirens and other tracks on the first two albums.

Musically the band&#x27;s style ranges from symphonic to hard rock. While in the beginning the band sounded like Fish-era Marillion, some of their recent albums have a similar sound to Nolan&#x27;s earlier band, Shadowland.

AllMusic called them one of the dominant neo-prog groups of the 1990s.

<text>Rediffusion was a business that distributed radio and TV signals through wired relay networks. The business gave rise to a number of other companies, including Associated-Rediffusion, later known as Rediffusion London, the first ITV (commercial television) franchisee to go on air in the UK. Rediffusion also spawned a record label, Rediffusion International Music, in 1968 (which was also responsible for the short-lived Koala label).

Redifon was the name used, until 1981, for companies in the capital goods businesses of Rediffusion, namely Redifon Computers, Redifon Flight Simulation and Redifon Telecommunications.

The Rediffusion brand has been revived and is currently used in China on consumer electrical products and on LED televisions in the UK.

==Early history==
Rediffusion was the trading name of Broadcast Relay Service Limited, founded in March 1928 for Joshua Powell (9 May 1871 – October 1946).

In January 1929, the company introduced its first cable radio service in Hull to customers frustrated with the difficulties of tuning in weak radio broadcasts. In the customer premises, nothing more than a selector switch and loudspeaker were needed. Initially, the service consisted primarily of rebroadcasts of the BBC Radio service, which was reflected in the trading name: Rediffusion simply means &quot;broadcasting again&quot;.

Rediffusion quickly branched out into making, renting, and selling radios, both receivers for its cable services and conventional models. With the arrival of the first experimental television broadcasts in the 1930s, Rediffusion began manufacturing TV sets and supplying &quot;Piped TV&quot;, an early form of cable TV service, to its customers, until the cessation of television broadcasts during the Second World War.

The first British colony to have the Rediffusion service was Barbados in 1934, when Radio Distribution (Barbados) Limited was formed.

A year later, Rediffusion started operating in Malta. Transmissions in Malta started from Hamrun on 11 November 1935, under the name of &quot;Broadcast Relay Service Malta Limited&quot;, with Charles Whotcroft and George Powler the first manager and chief engineer, respectively.

==Post-war==
In 1947, British Electric Traction acquired a substantial minority interest in Rediffusion. BET acquired a controlling interest in 1967, and the remaining 36% of equity in 1983.

In 1948, Rediffusion established Redifon Ltd as a manufacturer of naval (and later flight) telecommunications equipment.

After the war, Rediffusion began operations in several of the then British colonies. These included holding the concessions for wired and over-the-air radio and television stations. A subsidiary company, Overseas Rediffusion, operated these stations and also sold advertising time and programming for them. Stations included the radio station Rediffusion Barbados, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the wired television service Rediffusion Television in Hong Kong, the latter later known as Asia Television. It also opened a company in Jersey in 1949, Rediffusion (Channel Islands) Limited, which obtained a licence to relay radio broadcasts from the States of Jersey in 1950. It also opened a manufacturing division in Jersey, Television Research Limited (TVR) which also provided research facilities for the wired network. This was established in 1952, and was renamed Reditronics Limited in 1976.

BET&#x27;s financial resources enabled Rediffusion to capitalise on the growth in post war television, which restarted in 1946. Initially, the company installed cable TV systems in blocks of flats in London, and over the next few years expanded outside London. The company was also involved in the sale and rental of television sets.

==Expansion into broadcasting==
With the passage of the Television Act 1954, Rediffusion joined forces with Associated Newspapers, a subsidiary of Daily Mail and General Trust, to form Associated-Rediffusion, and won the coveted London weekday ITV broadcast franchise. They began broadcasting on 22 September 1955.

During the partnership&#x27;s first year, Associated-Rediffusion was losing money so fast that by the end of 1956, Associated Newspapers sold 80% of its stake back to BET and Rediffusion at a severe loss. Around this time, Associated-Rediffusion struck a very lucrative deal with Granada Television, the franchise holder for weekday broadcasts in the North of England. Granada was also losing money, and lacked the financial resources of BET; the deal guaranteed Granada a certain level of financial security, at the cost of Associated-Rediffusion receiving the vast majority of future profits from their arrangement.

On 29 September 1962, Rediffusion (Malta) Ltd. inaugurated a television service covering the Maltese islands.

By 1964, when Associated-Rediffusion changed its name to Rediffusion London, the efforts of the owners had left them sitting on a substantial cash pile, and it is arguable that this success may have led to the 1967 decision by the Independent Television Authority to effectively break up the company. Rediffusion London was ordered to merge with ABC Weekend TV, the holder of the weekend Midlands and North of England franchises, to form Thames Television, with ABC given the controlling interest (despite its generally weaker financial position) and Rediffusion holding 49%. Thames Television was given the new weekday London franchise, with ABC&#x27;s existing franchises awarded to other companies.

==Other ventures==
===Rediffusion Cable===


Rediffusion also offered a low-bandwidth cable TV and radio distribution system. This was based on connecting homes with multiple twisted-pair cables. Each pair carried a single TV or radio channel. The system was provided in most United Kingdom towns. Selection of TV or radio station was by means of a rotary switch, usually mounted on a wall or window frame close to the point of entry of the cable into the home. From this a two-wire cable led to the TV or radio. The TVs used on this system were stripped-down TV sets with no tuner or RF front-end and the radios were little more than a loudspeaker with a step down transformer and volume control. Rediffusion abandoned this system of TV and radio distribution by the end of the 1980s. The wall mounted switches, external junction boxes and street cable ducts are still visible in places that have not been redeveloped since the late 1980s.
===Overseas Rediffusion===

BET and Rediffusion Limited had strong links with the former British colonies. These included holding the concessions for wired and over-the-air radio and television stations. A subsidiary company, Overseas Rediffusion, operated these stations and also sold advertising time and programming for them. Stations included the radio operations in Barbados, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Malaysia, Malta, Liberia, Thailand and the wired television service Rediffusion Television in Hong Kong, the latter now known as Asia Television.

===Rediffusion Rentals===
The Rediffusion retail chain, renting and servicing TVs, radios, VCRs and hi-fi systems, was common on high streets until it was bought by Granada Rentals in 1984.

==Last years==
Rediffusion&#x27;s television sale and rental operations continued to grow, particularly following the start of colour television broadcasts in 1967.

On 14 February 1975, the employees of the Rediffusion (Malta) Ltd staged a sit-in strike at the company&#x27;s premises in Malta and they even started to run the company. On 30 July 1975, an agreement was reached between Rediffusion Group of Companies and the Dom Mintoff led Labour Party government of Malta for the transfer of all Rediffusion&#x27;s assets in Malta to the Maltese government.

The company also experimented with its local cable operations: a local community station in Bristol (&quot;Bristol Channel&quot;) from 1973 to 1976, and an optical fibre system in Hastings in 1976.

The Rediffusion brand was also a name in aircraft simulation in both the UK and the US. Redifon, established in 1948, had become a manufacturer of flight simulators and in 1981, BET changed Redifon&#x27;s name to Rediffusion Simulation to capitalise on the name. The company was sold in 1988, to Hughes Aircraft, which kept the Rediffusion name until it sold the company in 1994.

Redifon (later Rediffusion) Computers was also part of the group and was based in Crawley, West Sussex. It initially started in the production of analogue computers to control flight simulators, then moved to produce minicomputers (&quot;R range&quot;), departmental Unix Servers and microcomputers (&quot;teleputers&quot;), specialising in data capture, enterprise accounting for local government and videotex systems. Michael Aldrich joined the company as marketing director in 1977, and became managing director and CEO in 1980.

From 1980, the company designed, manufactured, sold, installed and maintained online shopping systems mainly in the UK and achieved a significant number of world firsts. The company&#x27;s name was changed to Rediffusion Computers in 1981. During the 1980s, a large part of the company&#x27;s revenue came from its sales in Eastern Europe and Russia. Equipment that met the CoCom directive for the sales of high performance technology to the Soviet Bloc was supplied to a number of customers the largest of which was Gazprom who used the systems on the Siberian Gas Pipeline project. In addition there was a steady stream of Polish engineers attending the Crawley training facility to enable them to support and maintain this equipment mainly in Russia but also in other countries in the Eastern Bloc.

The company was highly innovative and amongst other things developed a signature recognition system for detecting cheque fraud. It was one of the first companies to sell a turnkey solution that utilised the newly available Post Office database (PAF) for postcode recognition. In 1984, Aldrich led a management buyout and the company became &quot;ROCC Computers&quot; (Rediffusion&#x27;s Old Computer Company). Aldrich was the largest shareholder and he subsequently bought-out the other shareholders.

In the 1980s, Rediffusion&#x27;s cable operations were left behind by the new generation of cable TV networks. BET (from 1983 the sole owners of Rediffusion) began divesting and sold off its overseas interests, and at the end of the 1980s, the company was broken up, The rentals business went to Granada, and the cable network systems were sold to the Maxwell Communications.

Reditronics Jersey was sold to SCK Holdings Limited in 1986, and following BET&#x27;s retreat from cable and the consequent loss of associated contracts, it ceased trading in 1987. The Rediffusion Jersey cable network was sold to Jersey Cable Limited (now Newtel Solutions) in 1988.

In 1991, a Hong Kong-based branch of the company, now known as Asia Television, returned telerecording copies of all four episodes of &quot;The Tomb of the Cybermen&quot;, a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial, to the BBC. The prints were in good condition, and the episodes were thought to have been lost for roughly fifteen years.

<text>Christopher &quot;Kiffer&quot; Finzi (12 July 1934 — 28 November 2019) was a British orchestral conductor. He was the son of composer Gerald Finzi and artist Joy Finzi.

== Background ==
Born in Hampstead, London in 1934, Finzi was the elder of Gerald Finzi&#x27;s two sons. Both he and his younger brother Nigel (1936–2010) attended Bedales School in Hampshire, where they were exposed to a liberal education and intellectual freedom much in line with their parents&#x27; own progressive outlook on the world. Finzi attended the Royal Academy of Music and embarked on a career as a freelance cellist. He became the conductor of the Newbury String Players after the death of his father who had founded the orchestra.

Like his father, the younger Finzi became a pacifist. As a conscientious objector he refused military service in 1955 and was briefly imprisoned before being allowed to do farm work. After his father&#x27;s death in 1956, he helped his mother to establish the Finzi Trust and sustain Gerald Finzi&#x27;s reputation. Their lifestyle was bohemian, living in a remote farmhouse.

== Marriage ==
Finzi married Hilary du Pré, a flautist, in 1961. They raised their four children, Theresa, Clare, Nicolette and Orlando, at Church Farm in Ashmansworth, Hampshire, the family home built by Finzi&#x27;s parents. Du Pré&#x27;s younger sister, the cellist Jacqueline du Pré, was part of their household during the 1970s.

Hilary du Pré&#x27;s 1997 memoir, &quot;A Genius in the Family&quot;, written with her brother Piers du Pré, created controversy by revealing that Finzi had had an affair with his sister-in-law.

The 1998 film &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;, the plot of which was based on interviews with Hilary and Piers, told the same basic story and was also controversial.

== Later life ==
Finzi eventually turned his attention away from music to farming, establishing a poultry business at Ashmansworth. He and his wife operated a health food shop in Newbury, Berkshire.

He made several recordings in his capacity as a conductor, including a performance of Gerald Finzi&#x27;s &quot;Dies Natalis&quot; and music by British composers Robin Milford and Edmund Rubbra. From 1971 to 1997, Finzi was resident conductor of the North Wiltshire Orchestra.

Finzi died in November 2019, aged 85.

<doc id="646384" wikidata="Q7661180" url="?curid=646384" title="Symbolic linguistic representation">
<text>A symbolic linguistic representation is a representation of an utterance that uses symbols to represent linguistic information about the utterance, such as information about phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, or semantics. Symbolic linguistic representations are different from non-symbolic representations, such as recordings, because they use symbols to represent linguistic information rather than measurements.

Symbolic representations are widely used in linguistics. In syntactic representations, atomic category symbols often refer to the syntactic category of a lexical item. Examples include lexical categories such as auxiliary verbs (INFL), phrasal categories such as relative clauses (SRel) and empty categories such as wh-traces (tWH). In some formalisms, such as Lexical Functional Grammar, these symbols can refer to both grammatical functions and values of grammatical categories. In linguistics, empty categories are represented with ∅.

Symbolic representations also appear in phonetic transcription, descriptions of phonological processes, trochees, phonemes, morphophonemes, natural classes, semantic features such as animacy and the qualia structures of Generative Lexicon Theory.

In natural language processing, linguistic representations, such as syntactic representations, have long been in the service of improving the output of information retrieval systems, such as search engines and machine translation systems. Recently, in span-based neural constituency parsing lexical items begin as wordpiece tokens or BPE tiktokens before they are transformed into several other representations: word vectors (word encoder), terminal nodes (span vectors, fenceposts), non-terminal nodes (span classifier), parse tree (neural CKY). It&#x27;s suggested that the mapping from terminals to non-terminals learns what constructions are permitted by the language.

Symbolic linguistic representations are frequently used in computational linguistics.

Other representations in linguistics that are not symbols or measurements include rules and rankings.

<text>Bremgarten bei Bern is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

==History==
Bremgarten bei Bern is first mentioned in 1180 as &quot;Bremecart&quot;. In 1236 it was mentioned as &quot;Bremegarten&quot; and until 1870 it was known as &quot;Bremgarten-Herrschaft&quot;.

The oldest trace of settlements in Bremgarten are from the Roman era and include a settlement, cobbled roads and Roman coins. During the Middle Ages there was a castle and village at Bremgarten, though no trace remains. However, in 1978, the outer curtain wall of the old castle was discovered. The castle, the home of the Lords of Bremgarten, was located at a narrow point on the Aare peninsula. The castle was the center of a barony that stretched along the Aare river at least as far as from Worblaufen to Kirchlindach. The Bremgarten family&#x27;s personal church, St. Michaels Church was first mentioned in 1275, though it was built in the 10th or 11th century and the choir was rebuilt in 1306.

In 1298, the town and castle were destroyed by Bern after the Bernese victory at the Battle of Donnerbühl. In 1306, the Lords of Bremgarten sold their land, rights and their ferry, to the Knights Hospitaller commandry of Münchenbuchsee. Under the Commandery, the town and castle were rebuilt and the castle became the seat of the commander. In 1510 the lands in Bremgarten were sold to the Stuckihaus Commandery to hold as a fief. Following the Protestant Reformation, the Commandery was secularized in 1529 and its land became part of Bern. The last commander of Münchenbuchsee Commandry retired to Bremgarten Castle for the remainder of his life. Bremgarten was assigned to the high court of Zollikofen. Much of the land that had been part of the Barony of Bremgarten was broken up to form new municipalities. In 1545, Bern sold the village and low court right to the Schultheiss Hans Franz Nageli. He demolished the old castle, except for the keep and curtain walls, and had a renaissance country manor built. Over the following centuries the castle and land was repeatedly inherited, bought and sold by Bern&#x27;s patrician families. It was held in 1579-92 by the Brügger family, 1592-1727 by the Kilchberger, 1727-43 by the de Chemilleret, 1743-61 by the von Wattenwyl and in 1761-65 by Fischer von Reichenbach. In 1743-47 the medieval keep and ramparts of the castle were demolished to make way for a baroque summer palace. Starting in 1765, the new owner Albrecht von Frisching, encouraged many tenants and craftsmen to settle in Bremgarten to help him rebuild the castle. By 1780 the project was finished and the castle was completely rebuilt. He had the castle hill built up and leveled to create a spacious courtyard and gardens around the castle. In 1770-71 the country estates of Belvedere (Friedrich von Luternau) and Aarwyl (Rudolf Albrecht Haller) were built in Bremgarten.

During the 19th century, Bremgarten Castle changed hands frequently, until 1918 when it was bought by the wealthy industrialist Wassmer family. They repaired the castle and in 1978 fully restored it.

After the 1798 French invasion and under the Helvetic Republic, Bremgarten was granted a town council and became part of the District of Bern. The first bridge over the Aare at Bremgarten was the Neubrügg which was built in 1466. However, the town remained isolated from the major roads leading to Bern until the 20th century. In 1921, the much larger Seftausteg bridge was built next to the Neubrügg. This was followed in 1928 by the Felsenaubrücke which was built by the army as a wooden bridge in 1929 and rebuilt as a solid-web girder bridge made of packed concrete in 1949.

The town was chronically short of money and sought to be incorporated into Bern in 1925, 1934 and 1945. A building boom in the 1950s helped alleviate many of the town&#x27;s financial problems. With little industrial development, Bremgarten has remained a bedroom community of Bern with over 80% of the working population commuting to Bern.

<doc id="646392" wikidata="Q610404" url="?curid=646392" title="Common flat-tail gecko">
<text>The common flat-tail gecko (Uroplatus fimbriatus) is a gecko endemic to Madagascar. It is found in eastern Madagascar and on the islands Nosy Bohara and Nosy Mangabe. These geckos live in tropical rain forests. They reach a total length of 330 mm.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Uroplatus&quot;, is a Latinization of two Greek words: &quot;ourá&quot; (οὐρά) meaning &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;platys&quot; (πλατύς) meaning &quot;flat&quot;. Its specific name &quot;fimbriatus&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;fringed&quot; based upon the gecko&#x27;s unique appearance of fringed skin.

==Description==

It is a large nocturnal gecko. Because the eyes are extremely sensitive to light, 350 times more sensitive than the human eye, the species is able to see in colors even at night. By day it plasters itself to a small tree trunk and rests head down. If disturbed it will raise its tail and head, open its mouth and scream.

==Threats==
Habitat destruction and deforestation in Madagascar is the primary threat to this animal&#x27;s future as well as collection for the pet trade. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the &quot;Uroplatus&quot; species on their &quot;Top ten most wanted species list&quot; of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it &quot;being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade&quot;. It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal. However, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the commercial export as likely sustainable.

In 20th and 21st century traditional music and popular music such as blues, swing, jazz, jazz fusion, rock and heavy metal, guitar solos often contain virtuoso techniques and varying degrees of improvisation. Guitar solos on classical guitar, which are typically written in musical notation, are also used in classical music forms such as chamber music and concertos.

Guitar solos range from unaccompanied works for a single guitar to compositions with accompaniment from a few other instruments or a large ensemble. The accompaniment musicians for a guitar solo can range from a small ensemble such as a jazz quartet or a rock band, to a large ensemble such as an orchestra or big band. Unaccompanied acoustic guitar music is found in folk and classical music dating as far back as the instrument&#x27;s first use in western music, the use of an acoustic guitar as a solo voice within an ensemble dates back at least to the Baroque concerto.

==Classical guitar==
The classical guitar is an acoustical wooden guitar with six strings, usually nylon, as opposed to the metal strings used in metal stringed acoustic guitars used in other genres. Classical guitar is typically played by plucking individual strings with the fingernails or the fingertips. A classical guitar solo concert is typically called a recital; it may include a variety of works, e.g. works written originally for the lute or vihuela by composers such as John Dowland (b. Ireland 1563) and Luis de Narváez (b. Spain c. 1500), and also music written for the harpsichord by Domenico Scarlatti (b. Italy 1685), for the baroque lute by Sylvius Leopold Weiss (b. Germany 1687), for the baroque guitar by Robert de Visée (b. France c. 1650) or even Spanish-inspired music written for the piano by Isaac Albéniz (b. Spain 1860) and Enrique Granados (b. Spain 1867). Johann Sebastian Bach (b. Germany 1685) is another composer who did not write for the guitar specifically, but whose music is often played on it as his baroque lute works have proved highly adaptable to the instrument.

Of music written originally for guitar, the earliest influential composers stem from the classical period. They include Fernando Sor (b. Spain 1778) and Mauro Giuliani (b. Italy 1781), it is noted that their music can be seen to be potentially influenced by Viennese classicism. In the 19th century guitar composers such as Johann Kaspar Mertz (b. Slovakia, Austria 1806) were influenced by music written for the piano. I Francisco Tárrega (b. Spain 1852) wrote more uniquely guitar music, incorporating stylized aspects of flamenco&#x27;s Moorish influences into his romantic miniatures. This was part of late 19th century European trend towards musical nationalism. Albéniz and Granados contributed to this movement as they wrote within the same time period.

Some classical guitarists play concertos, which are solos written for performance with the accompaniment of an orchestra. Fewer classical guitar concertos have been written compared to concertos for multi-instrumental orchestras. Some potentially notable ones could include Joaquín Rodrigo&#x27;s &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot; and &quot;Fantasía para un gentilhombre&quot;. In the 2000s, it has been noted that classical guitar is appearing more in classical music, as contemporary composers are increasingly writing guitar concertos.

===History===
Composers of the Renaissance period who wrote for four course guitar include Alonso Mudarra, Miguel de Fuenllana, Adrian Le Roy and Guillaume de Morlaye. Composers of the baroque guitar include Gaspar Sanz, Robert de Visée and Francesco Corbetta. From approximately 1780 to 1850, the guitar had composers and performers including: Filippo Gragnani (1767–1820), Antoine de Lhoyer (1768–1852), Ferdinando Carulli (1770–1841), Francesco Molino (1774–1847), Fernando Sor (1778–1839), Mauro Giuliani (1781–1829), Niccolò Paganini (1782–1840), Dionisio Aguado (1784 – 1849), Luigi Legnani (1790–1877), Matteo Carcassi (1792–1853), Napoléon Coste (1805–1883) and Johann Kaspar Mertz (1806–1856). Guitar soloist Andrés Segovia popularized the guitar with tours and early phonograph recordings in the 1920s. Modern classical guitar solo performers who are known for playing modern repertoire include Kazuhito Yamashita, Agustín Barrios, Paul Galbraith, and John Williams.

==Traditional and popular music==

===Blues, R&amp;B and rock and roll===

The term &quot;guitar solo&quot; often refers to electric guitar solos played in blues and in rock. The use of a guitar solo as an instrumental interlude was developed by blues musicians such as Lonnie Johnson, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, and T-Bone Walker, and jazz like Charlie Christian. Ernest Tubb&#x27;s 1940 honky tonk classic, &quot;Walking the Floor over You&quot; was the first &quot;hit&quot; recording to feature and highlight a solo by a standard electric guitar—though earlier hits featured electric lap steel guitars.

Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon, and Jimmy Reed played in Chicago in a style characterized by the use of electric guitar, sometimes slide guitar, harmonica, and a rhythm section of bass and drums. In the late 1950s, a new blues style emerged on Chicago&#x27;s West Side pioneered by Magic Sam, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush on Cobra Records. The &#x27;West Side Sound&#x27; had strong rhythmic support from a rhythm guitar, bass guitar and drums and as perfected by Guy, Freddie King, Magic Slim and Luther Allison was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar. Other blues artists, such as John Lee Hooker had influences not directly related to the Chicago style. John Lee Hooker&#x27;s blues is more &quot;personal,&quot; based on Hooker&#x27;s deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar.

These and other blues guitarists as well as the fast-picking techniques derived from country and bluegrass inspired the appearance of many virtuoso blues rock fusion soloists, beginning in 1963 with Lonnie Mack&#x27;s first major recordings. Jimi Hendrix was a psychedelic guitarist, and a pioneer in the use of distortion and audio feedback in his music. Through these artists and others, blues music influenced the development of rock music. Another important blues rock guitar soloist in the 1960s and 1970s was Eric Clapton. In the early 1970s, the Texas rock-blues style emerged, which used guitars in both solo and rhythm roles (e.g., Stevie Ray Vaughan).

===Rock===
The earliest rock guitar solos, as exemplified by popular recordings of Duane Eddy and Link Wray in the late 1950s, were relatively simple instrumental melodies. In the early 1960s, instrumental surf music represented a step forward in the sonic complexity of rock guitar melodies. In 1963, the dramatic, technically advanced electric guitar solo rose to the fore with Lonnie Mack&#x27;s hit records, &quot;Memphis&quot; and &quot;Wham!&quot; (later covered by The Ventures, Stevie Ray Vaughan and others), and soon, with the advent of blues rock and psychedelic rock in the mid-late 1960s, became a characteristic part of rock music. Later still, guitar solos became a defining feature of the rock genre of heavy metal, in which most songs feature a solo. Metal solos often showcase the virtuosity of the guitarists, especially in metal styles that use shred guitar techniques for rapid playing of scales and arpeggios. Since the 1960s, electric guitarists have often altered the timbre of their guitar adding electronic guitar effects such as reverb, distortion, delay, and chorus to make the sound fuller and add harmonic overtones. Other effects used in solos include the wah-wah pedal and the talk box.

Rock bands often have two guitarists, designated &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot;, with the lead player performing the solos and instrumental melody lines while the rhythm player accompanies with chords or riffs. In some cases, two guitarists share the lead role. Most rock music is based around songs in traditional forms. The main formal features are verses, choruses, and bridges. The guitar solo is usually the most significant instrumental section of a mainstream rock song. In other rock-related genres, such as pop and dance music, the synthesizer usually plays this role.

In classic verse–chorus form, it often falls between the second chorus and third verse. Extended guitar solos are sometimes used as a song&#x27;s outro, such as Christopher Cross&#x27; &quot;Ride Like the Wind&quot;, Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Free Bird&quot;, The Stooges&#x27; &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;, Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;November Rain&quot;, Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Dog&quot;, Journey&#x27;s &quot;Who&#x27;s Crying Now&quot;, The Cult&#x27;s &quot;Love Removal Machine&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, .38 Special&#x27;s &quot;Hold On Loosely&quot;, The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Sway&quot;, Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Alive&quot;, Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;Dani California&quot;, Cream&#x27;s &quot;White Room&quot;, AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;, Outlaws&#x27; &quot;Green Grass and High Tides&quot;, The Alan Parsons Project&#x27;s &quot;Eye in the Sky&quot; and Eagles&#x27; &quot;Hotel California&quot;.

Solos can take place in the intro, such as &quot;Voodoo Child (Slight Return)&quot; by Jimi Hendrix, &quot;Since I&#x27;ve Been Loving You&quot; by Led Zeppelin, &quot;One&quot; by Metallica, &quot;Lazy&quot; by Deep Purple, &quot;I Want It All&quot; by Queen, &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; by Chuck Berry, &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Me Alive&quot; by Steely Dan, &quot;Sails of Charon&quot; by Scorpions and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; by Pink Floyd. In rarer cases, the guitar solo may come after the first chorus as opposed to the second, such as &quot;Beast and the Harlot&quot; by Avenged Sevenfold, &quot;The Importance of Being Idle&quot; by Oasis and &quot;Black Summer&quot; by Red Hot Chili Peppers.

The use of guitar solos in hard rock and heavy metal was notable during the 1980s, when rapid-fire &quot;shredding&quot; solos were common; a virtuoso lead guitarist of a band might be more well-known than the singer (although in a few cases one artist held both roles). During this time, players began to use advanced harmonics techniques more widely. Later, guitarists who had developed considerable technical facility began to release albums with instrumental-only guitar compositions. Guitar solos in popular music waned in fashion in the middle 1990s, coinciding with the rise in popularity of nu metal and grunge. Nu metal differed significantly from previous sub-genres of metal and abandoned guitar solos altogether, except for a few rare lead fills here and there, whilst grunge did not wholly abandon solos and included them from time to time. Guitar solos likewise became less prominent in many pop and popular rock music styles; either being trimmed down to a short four-bar transition or omitted entirely, in a vast departure from the heavy usage of solos in classic rock music from the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s. Classic rock revival music heavily features soloing, along with classic rock bands that are still active as of 2018.

Occasionally, a song contains a two-part guitar solo with both rhythm and lead guitar taking solos (e.g., &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; by Metallica), or dual solos with both lead and rhythm playing complementary solos—such as with Twisted Sister&#x27;s &quot;30&quot;, Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;, &quot;The Trooper&quot;, Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Holy Wars... The Punishment Due&quot; or Deep Purple’s &quot;Highway Star&quot;. Some rock bands use harmonized dual lead guitar solos as part of their signature sound, such as Wishbone Ash and Lovebites. This was first popularized by the Allman Brothers Band in their album &quot;At Fillmore East&quot;.

===Bass guitar solos===
The bass guitar is played through a specialized amplifier to make the instrument louder and provided control over tone. The bass guitar came into use in popular music in the 1950s. While bass guitar solos are not common in popular music, some bands include bass solos in some songs, particularly heavy metal, funk, and progressive rock bands. Some genres use bass guitar solos in most songs, such as jazz bands or jazz fusion groups. Bass solos are also common in certain styles of punk music. In a rock context, bass guitar solos are structured and performed in a similar fashion as rock guitar solos, often with the musical accompaniment from the verse or chorus sections. While bass guitar solos appear on few studio albums from rock or pop bands, genres such as progressive rock, fusion-influenced rock, and some types of heavy metal are more likely to include bass solos, both in studio albums and in live performances.

Players perform bass solos with a range of techniques, such as plucking or finger picking. In the 1960s, The Who&#x27;s bassist, John Entwistle, performed a bass break on the song &quot;My Generation&quot; using a plectrum, though he intended to use his fingers—he simply could not drop the plectrum quickly enough. Many consider this one of the first bass solos in rock music, and one of the most recognizable. John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, on &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot;, the first song on their first album, uses two bass solos in an influentially dynamic way, as a bridge (when the band drops out after the choruses) to the next verse (after the first chorus) and the guitar solo-driven coda (after the third chorus). Queen&#x27;s bassist, John Deacon, occasionally played bass solos, notably in &quot;Under Pressure&quot; and &quot;Liar&quot;. In the 1970s, Aerosmith&#x27;s bassist, Tom Hamilton, played a bass intro on the song &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; from their album &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;. Thrash metal group Metallica&#x27;s 1983 debut album &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; features a solo by bassist Cliff Burton on &quot;(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth&quot;, which some consider his greatest work. John McVie of Fleetwood Mac performed a notable bass solo on &quot;The Chain&quot; from the record-setting 1977 album &quot;Rumours&quot;.

Manowar&#x27;s bassist Joey DeMaio uses special piccolo bass for his extremely fast bass solos like &quot;Sting of the Bumblebee&quot; and &quot;William&#x27;s Tale&quot;. Green Day bassist Mike Dirnt played a bass solo on the song &quot;No One Knows&quot; from the 1992 album &quot;Kerplunk!&quot; and on the song &quot;Makeout Party&quot; from the 2012 album &quot;¡Dos!&quot;. U2 includes a bass solo most notably on &quot;Gloria&quot;, in which Adam Clayton utilizes several techniques. Bassist Matt Freeman of Rancid has a very speedy, guitar-like bass solo in the song &#x27;&quot;Maxwell Murder&quot;. Blink-182&#x27;s &quot;Voyeur&quot; has a bass solo on both their studio album &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; and their live album &quot;The Mark, Tom and Travis Show (The Enema Strikes Back!)&quot;, in which they must &quot;prepare for the bass solo.&quot;

Heavy metal bass players such as Geezer Butler (Black Sabbath), Alex Webster (Cannibal Corpse), Cliff Burton (Metallica), jazz fusion bassist Jaco Pastorius (Weather Report), and Les Claypool (Primus, Blind Illusion) used chime-like harmonics and rapid plucking techniques in their bass solos. Geddy Lee of Rush performed a number of solos, most notably in &quot;YYZ&quot;. Also, in both published Van Halen concert videos, Michael Anthony performs unique maneuvers and actions during his solos. Funk bassists, such as Larry Graham, began using slapping and popping techniques for their bass solos, which coupled a percussive thumb-slapping technique of the lower strings with an aggressive finger-snap of the higher strings, often in rhythmic alternation. The slapping and popping technique incorporates a large number of muted (or &#x27;ghost&#x27; tones) to normal notes to add to the rhythmic effect. Slapping and popping solos were prominent in 1980s pop and R&amp;B, and they are still used by some 2000s-era funk and Latin bands.

Bass effects such as fuzz bass or wah-wah pedals to produce a more pronounced sound can be used when playing bass solos, hard rock and heavy metal bassists. Notably, Cliff Burton of Metallica used both distortion and wah-wah. Bass guitar solos have a much lighter accompaniment than solos for other instruments due to the lower range of the bass. The bass guitar solo can also be unaccompanied or accompanied only by the drums.

<text>Joyce Amy Finzi (; 3 March 1907 – 14 June 1991), commonly known as Joy Finzi, was a British artist and founder of the Finzi Trust, a foundation named for her husband, composer Gerald Finzi.

==Life and career==
She was born Joyce Amy Black in Hampstead, London in 1907. She studied music and art, and married Finzi in 1933. They had two sons, Christopher and Nigel.

Together with her husband, Finzi played an important part in founding the Newbury String Players. She devoted much time to preserving the work of composer-poet Ivor Gurney, continuing her husband&#x27;s work after his premature death in 1956. She sketched portraits of contemporary musicians including Ralph Vaughan Williams, Sir Adrian Boult, Howard Ferguson and Sir Arthur Bliss, and writers including Edmund Blunden, Ursula K. Le Guin, Sylvia Townsend Warner and David Jones.

In 1969, she founded the Finzi Trust to finance the recording of her husband Gerald&#x27;s work and that of other composers, and was instrumental in the formation of &quot;Finzi Friends&quot; in 1982, a society furthering the work of the Trust. She continued to draw and sculpt, and published two volumes of poetry: &quot;A Point of Departure&quot; and &quot;Twelve Months of a Year&quot;. A collection of her portrait drawings was published in 1987, with the title &quot;In That Place&quot;.

She died on 14 June 1991 in Ashmansworth, Hampshire at the age of 84.

<text>The Nashville Basin, also known as the Central Basin, is a term often used to describe the area surrounding Murfreesboro, Tennessee, in which Nashville is located. The Central Basin was caused by an uplifting which produced a dome known as the Nashville Dome. The Nashville Dome is evidenced by the underlying rock strata that all dip downward away from Nashville. The uplifting of the Nashville Dome fractured overlying strata, making it more easily eroded, and thus the &quot;dome&quot; resulted in a &quot;basin&quot;. Uplifted strata in the center of a geological dome have higher potential erosive energy than the surrounding strata, because they are physically higher. Erosion thus acts on the uplifted area at a greater rate than on the surrounding flat-lying area, creating a low area, i.e., a basin. This area is more correctly referred to as the &quot;Central Dome&quot; of Tennessee.

Nashville is located in the northwestern portion of the Central Basin. The basin extends for approximately forty-five to sixty miles to the east of Nashville and about eighty miles to the south, near the Tennessee–Alabama state line. Travelers leaving Nashville in a northerly or easterly direction will soon begin the climb up the escarpment that marks the bordering geographic/geologic province, the Highland Rim and further eastwards, the Cumberland Plateau. The southern edge of the Highland Rim is more distant and somewhat less pronounced. The only downhill routes leaving the area follow the course of the Cumberland River as it flows northwest toward Ashland City and Clarksville, Tennessee.
The Central Basin is underlain primarily by limestone from the Ordovician Period. The Nashville Basin and a similar but smaller area surrounding Lexington, Kentucky referred to as the &quot;Kentucky Bluegrass&quot; area, are the two primary areas of this sort in the world.

The &quot;Inner Basin&quot; of the flattest terrain and most limestone-derived soil chemistry is located to the south and east of Nashville, primarily in the counties of Marshall, Rutherford, Wilson, and Bedford. Here also are seen the horse farms somewhat reminiscent of the Kentucky Bluegrass region. Supposedly the underlying rock weathers to a soil particularly suited to the growing of the sorts of grasses most favored by horses. Limestone glades (or cedar glades), located to the east of Nashville, primarily in Wilson and Rutherford Counties, are open areas where the flat limestone rock is denuded of overlying soil or nearly so, provide an environment for flora unlike any other in the world.

<text>Günther&#x27;s flat-tail gecko (&quot;Uroplatus guentheri)&quot;, also known commonly as Güenther&#x27;s leaf-tail gecko, is a species of nocturnal gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to Madagascar.

==Etymology==
The specific name, &quot;guentheri&quot;, is in honour of German-born British herpetologist Albert Günther.

==Geographic range==
&quot;U. guentheri&quot; is found in northwestern Madagascar in the area around Ankarafansika and near Morondava in western Madagascar.

==Description==
&quot;U. guentheri&quot; reaches a total length (including tail) of .

==Habitat==
The preferred natural habitat of &quot;U. guentheri&quot; is forest, at altitudes of .

==Behaviour==
&quot;U. guentheri&quot; forages and roosts on small trees and bushes. It is generally found less than above the ground. It is very difficult to find during the day, using its camouflage to mimic dead branches and bits of bark. During the night however, it becomes active, hunting for invertebrate prey.

==Reproduction==
&quot;U. guentheri&quot; is oviparous. The sperical eggs are laid in leaf litter.

<text>Büren an der Aare (usually abbreviated with Büren a.A., means &quot;Büren on the Aare&quot;) is a historic town and a municipality in the Seeland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

==History==
Büren an der Aare is first mentioned in 1185 as &quot;Buirro&quot;. In 1236 it was mentioned as &quot;Buron&quot;. The formerly independent village of Reiben was first mentioned in 1309. It became part of Büren an der Aare in 1911.

The earliest trace of humans in Büren are scattered neolithic and La Tene items. The Roman era road between Aventicum and Salodurum (Solothurn) runs through the area that would become the municipality. Roman ruins include part of the road and a milestone at Bürenmoos, a canal at Burgweg and what may have been a country estate on Kirchmatt. Above the town, on the Schlosshubel hill, was the high medieval Strassberg Castle, the home of the Baron of Strassberg. The town was built on a narrow strip of land between the Städtiberg and the Aare. The town received a town charter from Berchtold I of Strassberg in 1260, which was confirmed in 1288. Under the Barons, the town became the center of the Büren &quot;Herrschaft&quot;. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the Counts of Neuchâtel gained power in the Herrschaft. In 1345, financial difficulties forced Imer of Strassberg to pledge some rights in the town to Solothurn. In 1369 Solothurn also acquired the right to collect duties and tolls in Büren. In 1375 Enguerrand de Coucy besieged the town, but did not take it. After Imer&#x27;s death the town was inherited by the Counts of Neu-Kyburg, who then sold it to Austria. During the Sempach War, Büren was besieged and captured by Bern and in 1388 it was placed under joint Bern-Solothurn control. In 1393, the captured land was finally divided and Büren became the capital of a new Bernese bailiwick. In 1620-25 Büren Castle was built on the main street as the official residence of the Bernese bailiff.

The oldest part of the town church of St. Catherine is the choir from the third quarter of the 13th century. The rest of the church was completed between then and 1500. By 1375 it was an independent parish church.

The town council appointed its first recorded Schultheiss in 1254. The oldest town seal is from 1273. The 1288 town charter granted it the right to hold markets. In 1284, a toll bridge over the Aare was first mentioned. In 1478, the salt, iron, steel, wool and linen markets came under Bernese control. The town had both a market square and docks on the Aare as well as inns and warehouses to encourage traders to come to Büren. In 1481, weekly markets were added to the quarterly fairs that they had been holding. The town&#x27;s economy was based on both trade and agriculture. During the 15th and 16th century a new town hall was built with a market hall on the ground floor. In the 16th century a hospital and school opened. Starting in the 15th century, the town began operating mountain pastures, a dairy and a cheese-maker as a fief of the Prince-Bishop of Basel. The now disused brickworks was first mentioned in 1630.

After the 1798 French invasion, it became the capital of the Helvetic Republic&#x27;s Büren District. After the Act of Mediation and the Congress of Vienna the district remained as a part of the Canton of Bern.

During the 19th century, the town began to decline. No major railway line passes through it and water transportation had declined in importance. In 1876 the regional Lyss-Solothurn railway line connected the town to its neighbors. A few small factories moved in including watch manufactures, but they have since closed. Only the old gear and machinery factory (built in 1946) and a meat processing plant (built in 1945) remain of the older factories. However, a new anodizing and electronics moved into Büren in the end of the 20th century. The Nidau-Büren channel, built in 1868–75, helped protect the town from flooding and opened up new agricultural land. The cultivation of sugar beets and livestock remain important. During World War II it was the site of the largest refugee camp in Switzerland. The wooden bridge was built in 1821 and replaced in 1991 after a fire 1991. In addition to the district administration, Büren is home to the forestry office, the secondary school, a nursing home and an outpatient hospital care facility.

<text>Thomas Wilson Barnes (1825–1874) was an English chess master, one of the leading British masters of his time.

==Chess history==
Barnes was one of the leading British chess masters at the time of Paul Morphy&#x27;s visit to the UK in 1858. Barnes had the happy fortune of having the best record against Paul Morphy during the latter&#x27;s visit, winning eight games and losing nineteen . The only tournament he played in was London in 1862, where he finished in the middle of the field , .

==Openings named for Barnes==

A variation of the Ruy Lopez opening called the Barnes Defence was named after him: 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 g6 (this is also sometimes known as the Smyslov Defence). A much more dubious variation named for him is Barnes Defence, 1.e4 f6 which he played against Anderssen and Morphy, beating the latter. Barnes Opening, 1.f3, also bears his name. Opening with the f-pawn served his preference to sidestep existing opening knowledge.

==Death==
Barnes went on a diet and lost 130 pounds (9st 4 lb, approx. 59 kg) in 10 months, which resulted in his death. Barnes was buried 5 days after his death at the Brompton cemetery in London.

<text>The Satellite Control Network (SCN), operated by the United States Space Force&#x27;s Space Delta 6, provides support for the operation, control, and maintenance of a variety of United States Department of Defense and some non-DoD satellites. This involves continual execution of Telemetry, Tracking, and Commanding (TT&amp;C) operations. In addition, the SCN provides prelaunch checkout and simulation, launch support, and early orbit support while satellites are in initial or transfer orbits and require maneuvering to their final orbit. The SCN provides tracking data to help maintain the catalog of space objects and distributes various data such as satellite ephemeris, almanacs, and other information. It was previously known as the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) while under Air Force Space Command&#x27;s 50th Network Operations Group.

==Overview==
The Satellite Control Network consists of satellite control centers, tracking stations, and test facilities located around the world. Satellite Operations Centers (SOCs) are located at Schriever Space Force Base near Colorado Springs, Colorado, and various other locations throughout the continental United States. These SOCs are staffed around the clock and are responsible for the command and control of their assigned satellite systems. The SOCs are linked to remote tracking stations (RTSs) around the world. Space vehicle checkout facilities are used to test launch vehicles and satellite platforms to ensure that the onboard systems operate within specifications. The RTSs provide the link between the satellites and the SOCs. A similar relationship exists for dedicated networks, which are outside the purview of the Satellite Control Network. RTSs around the world are needed to maintain frequent communications with the satellite. Without RTSs, the SOCs would only be able to contact a satellite when it came into the control center&#x27;s view. Some satellites, especially those in geostationary orbit, never come within view of their control center. Each antenna at an RTS is referred to as a &quot;side&quot;. Previously, Side A typically included a dish antenna. Side B typically included a antenna. At some sites, the B side included a antenna. Over time, however, as the network upgraded and/or replaced the antennas, the old conventions no longer apply.

==History==
The Satellite Control Network was originally activated to support the CORONA (Discoverer) program in 1959. An interim satellite control center was initially established in Palo Alto, California, and by June 1960, a permanent control center had been established Sunnyvale AFS, later renamed Onizuka AFS, Sunnyvale, California. The main operations control center, now at Schriever Space Force Base, Colorado Springs, CO, functions as a central command and control node for the remote tracking stations established at several different locations.

==Locations==
*Schriever Space Force Base, Colorado – Primary C2 Node
*Ellison Onizuka Satellite Operations Facility (EOSOF) at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California – Secondary C2 Node.

The Satellite Control Network maintains a number of tracking stations, which are used to track (primarily) US government agency &amp; military satellites, as well as receive and process telemetry and send commands to these satellites. Said facilities are intended to support all Department of Defense satellites. Most tracking stations are operated by operational detachments of the 21st Space Operations Squadron (21 SOPS) and 23d Space Operations Squadron. Many scientific and research satellites are supported as well.

==Current Remote Tracking Stations==
* Diego Garcia Station (DGS), Diego Garcia, BIOT; callsign REEF. The Diego Garcia Station has two sides (as of 2010) to provide enhanced tracking for the Satellite Control Network users. This site also includes a GPS Ground Antenna site.
* Guam Tracking Station (GTS), Guam; callsign GUAM. The Guam Tracking Station has two sides (one ARTS and one RBC) and is undergoing a &quot;hybridization&quot; upgrade that replaces the old A-side ARTS system with an RBC core electronics suite and upgrades the existing 60-foot antenna.
* Hawaii Tracking Station (HTS), Kaena Point Satellite Tracking Station, Hawaii; callsign HULA. The Hawaii Tracking Station is located on the island of Oahu and also includes an ARTS side and an RBC side. The Hawaii Tracking Station is also undergoing a &quot;hybridization&quot; effort that will replace the old B-side ARTS system and upgrade the existing 60-foot antenna (previously the A-side).
* New Hampshire Station (NHS), New Boston SFS, New Hampshire; callsign BOSS. The New Hampshire Tracking Station is located in New Boston, New Hampshire. As of 2013, the site had two ARTS sides and an RBC side.
* Telemetry &amp; Command Station (TCS), RAF Oakhanger, in England, operated by the United Kingdom and supporting the Satellite Control Network through a Memorandum of Agreement between the UK Ministry of Defence and the US Department of Defense; callsign LION. As of 2010, the site includes three sides, two ARTS and an RBC.
* Thule Tracking Station (TTS), Pituffik Space Base, Greenland; callsign POGO. The station ) is a U.S. Space Force installation in Greenland. It is near Pituffik Space Base and has a Remote Tracking Station (callsign: Polar Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (POGO)) of the Satellite Control Network. It was originally the classified 6594th Test Wing&#x27;s Operating Location 5 designated by Air Force Systems Command on 15 October 1961: the station was operational on 30 March 1962, with &quot;transportable antenna vans parked in an old Strategic Air Command bomb assembly building.&quot; The permanent RTS equipment was emplaced in 1964, and a communications terminal was emplaced on Pingarssuit Mountain—Thule Site N-32 (moved to Thule Site J in 1983.

The station transferred to Detachment 3, 22nd Space Operations Squadron, in 1992.

It includes a &quot;fully equipped mini-fitness center&quot;. It was a three-sided site until the summer of 2011, when the &quot;C&quot; side was decommissioned and dismantled in preparation for system upgrades. The upgrade to an Automated Remote Tracking Station was planned to be completed in 2015. In May, 2013, the A-side antenna suffered a mechanical failure that prompted an early decommissioning. From that time, the site operated only with its B-side. Starting in 2014, the new C-side RBC installation got under way. This is the northernmost RTS, located at approximately 76.4 degrees north latitude. As of February 2015, the RBC installation is nearly complete, with just a few minor details to be finished before the formal testing gets underway in the May/June timeframe.
* Vandenberg Tracking Station (VTS), California; callsign COOK. This is a dual-sided station which provides normal on-orbit support but also provides pre-launch checkouts and launch support for the Western Test Range at Vandenberg Space Force Base.

==Automated Remote Tracking Stations==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the RTSs were modernized with the addition of the Automated Remote Tracking Station (ARTS) systems. The ARTS systems provided more responsive support and reduced the manpower required at each site through semi-automation. In addition to upgrading all the existing sites, the ARTS Phase I program added the following sites to the Satellite Control Network:
*Colorado Tracking Station at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado, which had a &quot;cessation of operations&quot; in August 2012 and was formally deactivated in 2014
*Thule Tracking Station &quot;C&quot; side, which was decommissioned in 2011 and dismantled that summer
*Telemetry and Command Station &quot;B&quot; side
*Diego Garcia Station &quot;A&quot; side code number 01122334455

==RTS Block Change (RBC) Systems==
Beginning in 2004, an upgrade effort was started to replace the ARTS sites, which were already beyond their planned design life. The following sites have been upgraded to the RBC configuration, which includes a 13-meter 3-axis antenna:
*Vandenberg Tracking Station &quot;A&quot; side
*Diego Garcia Station &quot;B&quot; side, added to the network during the upgrade effort
*Telemetry and Command Station &quot;C&quot; side, added to the network during the upgrade effort
*Hawaii Tracking Station &quot;A&quot; side
*Guam Tracking Station &quot;B&quot; side
*New Hampshire Station &quot;B&quot; side
*Thule Tracking Station &quot;C&quot; side

==Closed Remote Tracking Stations==

*Indian Ocean Station (IOS), Mahe Island, Seychelles; callsign INDI (closed in August 1996, after the Government of Seychelles attempted to &quot;raise the rent&quot; to more than $10 million/year). The Indian Ocean Tracking Station was located on the island of Mahe, the main island of the Seychelles archipelago. It had one 60-foot antenna. Its location was ideal for communicating with geosynchronous satellites over the Indian Ocean. The station was also geographically suited for acquiring realtime or near-realtime data from passes over areas to the north. In 1980, due to political instabilities of the island, the main processing computers were removed and relocated to Sunnyvale. These computers communicated with the IOS downlink and tracking equipment via a wideband (DSCS) communications link. IOS has been supplanted by Diego Garcia RTS.
*Kodiak Tracking Station (KTS), Kodiak Island, Alaska; callsign KODI (closed on 20 March 1975)
*Sunnyvale Control Station, callsign CUBE. Not a true tracking station, in that it had no direct downlink antenna. Instead, CUBE supported operations at TCS/Oakhangar and IOS/Seychelles, where main processing computers could not be located. CUBE had two &#x27;sides&#x27;, and so could support two satellite passes simultaneously. The 750th Space Group was inactivated in June 1999.
* Colorado Tracking Station (CTS), Schriever AFB, Colorado; callsign PIKE. As of 2008, this site transitioned from an operational location to a testing facility, with operational support as possible. This site formally ceased operational support on 2 August 2012. It used to support various DoD satellites and previously included enhancement equipment that was used to support the Global Positioning System satellites. On 30 September 2014, the site was formally deactivated and closed.

There was a tracking station on Annette Island that is one of the Alaska islands far south east of the Alaska main land area and not too far north of Seattle Washington. It was built in the mid/late 1950s and closed in the early 1960s.

<doc id="646414" wikidata="Q1227145" url="?curid=646414" title="Diphone">
<text>In phonetics, a diphone is an adjacent pair of phones in an utterance. For example, in [daɪfəʊn], the diphones are [da], [aɪ], [ɪf], [fə], [əʊ], [ʊn]. The term is usually used to refer to a recording of the transition between two phones. 

In the following diagram, a stream of phones are represented by P1, P2, etc., and the corresponding diphones are represented by D1-2, D2-3, etc.:

 |P1===|P2===|P3===|P4===|P5===|P6===|
 |D1-2=|D2-3=|D3-4=|D4-5=|D5-6=|

If the number of phones in a language is P, the theoretical number of possible diphones is P2. However, since all languages have restrictions about what sounds can occur next to each other (see &quot;phonotactics&quot;), the number of diphones in each language is usually much smaller than P2. 

Spanish has about 800 diphones and German about 2,500. 

Diphones are useful in speech synthesis. When pre-recorded diphones are combined to create synthesized speech, the resulting sounds are much more natural than just combining simple phones. That is because the pronunciations of each phone varies based on the surrounding phones.

<doc id="646416" wikidata="Q137604" url="?curid=646416" title="Henkel's leaf-tailed gecko">
<text>Henkel&#x27;s leaf-tailed gecko (&quot;Uroplatus henkeli)&quot;, also known commonly as Henkel&#x27;s flat-tailed gecko or the frilled leaf-tail gecko, is a species of gecko, a lizard in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to Madagascar.

==Geographic range==
&quot;U. henkeli&quot; is found in primary forest on the island of Nosy Bé near Madagascar, as well as on the mainland of Madagascar itself, in the region of Ankaranafantsika.

==Behaviour==
Henkel&#x27;s leaf-tailed gecko lives an arboreal lifestyle, venturing down to the ground only to lay eggs in soft soil and leaf litter.

==Description==
There are two different morphs of &quot;U. henkeli&quot;, the Nosy Bé form and the mainland Madagascar form, and they can be distinguished by their colouration patterns, though these are not always reliable. Reaching a total length (including tail) of , this is one of largest species in the genus.

==Diet==
Henkel&#x27;s flat-tailed gecko is insectivorous, but will also eat snails if they are found.

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Uroplatus&quot;, is a Latinization of two Greek words: &quot;ourá&quot; (οὐρά) meaning &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;platys&quot; (πλατύς) meaning &quot;flat&quot;. The specific name, &quot;henkeli&quot;, is a Latinization of German herpetologist Friedrich-Wilhelm Henkel&#x27;s last name.

==Threats==
Henkel&#x27;s leaf-tailed gecko is currently classified as vulnerable by the IUCN. Habitat destruction and deforestation in Madagascar is the primary threat to this animal&#x27;s future as well as collection for the pet trade. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the &quot;Uroplatus&quot; species on their &quot;Top ten most wanted species list&quot; of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it &quot;being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade&quot;. It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal.

<text>A trailhead is the point where a trail begins or is accessed, where the trail is often intended for hiking, biking, horseback riding, or off-road vehicles. Modern trailheads often contain restrooms, maps, signposts, and distribution centers for informational brochures about the trail and its features and parking areas for vehicles and trailers. 

The United States Access Board defines a trailhead &quot;as an outdoor space that is designated by an entity responsible for administering or maintaining a trail to serve as an access point to the trail.&quot; The intersection of two trails is a trail junction and does not constitute a trailhead.
Historically, the cities located at the terminus of major pathways for foot traffic, such as the Natchez Trace and the Chisholm Trail, were also known as trailheads.

For mountain climbing and hiking, the elevation of the trailhead above sea level is posted to give an idea of how high the mountain is above the average terrain. A trailhead may also feature a trail grade, which determines the walking difficulty of the trail.

<text>Letzigrund () is a stadium in Zürich, Switzerland, the home of the football clubs FC Zürich and Grasshopper Club Zürich, as well as the athletics club . The original stadium was constructed by members of FC Zürich in 1925. Grasshopper Club has been using it as their home stadium since 2007, shortly after construction of the new stadium was completed. 

The annual track and field meet Weltklasse Zürich, part of the Diamond League, has taken place at the Letzigrund since 1928, as have frequent open-air concerts. On the Letzigrund track on 21 June 1960, Armin Hary was the first human to run the 100 metres in 10.0 seconds.

==Old stadium (1925–2006)==

The old Letzigrund stadium was opened on 22 November 1925 and was owned by FC Zürich. In 1937, during the Great Depression, ownership was transferred to the city of Zurich, which has operated the Letzigrund ever since. It underwent extensive remodeling in 1947, 1958, 1973, and 1984. Lighting was added in 1973. The first open-air concert there was held in 1996.

The capacity of the stadium was 25,000 and the main pitch was , with athletics facilities. There were also three other playing fields: two lawns, an artificial turf, and a small packed sand field. The old Letzigrund also contained a bar and a restaurant within the stadium.

== New stadium (2007–present) ==
In the 1990s, the athletics club Zürich pushed for a modernisation of the facilities at Letzigrund, in order to even better accommodate the athletes of Weltklasse Zürich. In 1997, the city parliament decided favourably on an upgrade of the stadium, whereas the city administration was simultaneously working on a reconstruction plan. At the same time, the owners of the Hardturm football stadium were also planning to reconstruct their stadium.

In 2003, the new Hardturm stadium was approved by the city population in a public vote, but subsequently, legal objections by neighbourhood and environmental groups put the timely realisation for the EURO 2008 tournament, for which it was chosen by UEFA in 2002 as one of eight venues, in jeopardy. As a result, the planning process for the new Letzigrund stadium was accelerated. In 2005, the city population approved the reconstruction of the public stadium and the costs of temporarily adjusting the stadium to the requirements of EURO 2008 in two separate referendums.

Originally planned for 2009, the new Letzigrund stadium was opened on August 30, 2007. The first sports event there was the annual Weltklasse Zürich on September 7 with 26,500 spectators. The first football game was FC Zürich vs. Grasshopper Club Zürich on September 23. It hosted three games during the 2008 European championships, with a capacity of up to 30,000. The current capacity is 25,000 for football events, 26,000 for athletics and 50,000 for concerts.

On 2 October 2011, the Swiss Football League game between FC Zürich and Grasshopper Club Zürich held at the stadium saw a major incident of football hooliganism. During the 74th minute of the match, with Grasshopper Club Zürich leading 2–1, a masked FC Zürich fan threw a lit flare into the Grasshopper Club Zürich fan section. This incited a violent reaction from the Grasshopper Club Zürich fans, several dozen of whom rushed towards the fence separating the two groups and attempted to fight back with flagpoles. The referee abandoned the match due to safety concerns. Six people were injured in the riot that ensued. The game had to be abandoned with approximately 15 minutes of regular time to go. Also dubbed the &quot;Disgrace of Zürich&quot; () by Swiss media, this incident represented a second major episode of hooligan violence in Switzerland within five years, after a hooligan incident of similar significance occurred in Basel in 2006.

==Matches==

=== UEFA Euro 2008 ===
The stadium was one of the venues for the UEFA Euro 2008. Three games were played at the stadium during the tournament. 

=== International matches ===
=== UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2025 ===
The stadium will be one of the venues for the UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2025. Five games will be played at the stadium during the tournament.

<doc id="646423" wikidata="Q72044151" url="?curid=646423" title="Eastern Slavic naming customs">
<text>Eastern Slavic naming customs are the traditional way of identifying a person&#x27;s family name, given name, and patronymic name in East Slavic cultures in Russia and some countries formerly part of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union.

They are used commonly in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and to a lesser extent in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. 
==Given names==
Eastern Slavic parents select a given name for a newborn child. Most first names in East Slavic languages originate from two sources:

* Eastern Orthodox Church tradition 
* native pre-Christian Slavic lexicons

Almost all first names are single. Doubled first names (as in, for example, French, like &quot;Jean-Luc&quot;) are very rare and are from foreign influence. Most doubled first names are written with a hyphen: &quot;Mariya-Tereza&quot;.

===Males===

===Females===
===Forms===
Being highly synthetic languages, Eastern Slavic treats personal names as grammatical nouns and apply the same rules of inflection and derivation to them as for other nouns. So one can create many forms with different degrees of affection and familiarity by adding the corresponding suffixes to the auxiliary stem derived from the original name. The auxiliary stem may be identical to the word stem of the full name (the full name Жанна &quot;Zhanna&quot; can have the suffixes added directly to the stem Жанн- &quot;Zhann-&quot; like Жанночка &quot;Zhannochka), and most names have the auxiliary stem derived unproductively (the Russian name Михаил &quot;Mikhail&quot; has the auxiliary stem Миш- &quot;Mish-&quot;, which produces such name-forms as Миша &quot;Misha, Мишенька &quot;Mishenka, Мишуня &quot;Mishunya etc., not *Михаилушка &quot;Mikhailushka&quot;).

Unlike English, in which the use of diminutive forms is optional even between close friends, in East Slavonic languages, such forms are obligatory in certain contexts because of the strong T–V distinction: the T-form of address usually requires the short form of the counterpart&#x27;s name. Also, unlike other languages with prominent use of name suffixes, such as Japanese, the use of derived name forms is mostly limited to the T-addressing: there is no way to make the name more formal than the plain unsuffixed full form, and usually no suffixes can be added to the family name.

Most commonly, Russian philologists distinguish the following forms of given names:

====Short forms====


The &quot;short name&quot; (Russian: краткое имя &quot;kratkoye imya&quot;), historically also &quot;half-name&quot; (Russian: полуимя &quot;poluimya&quot;), is the simplest and most common name derivative. Bearing no suffix, it is produced suppletively and always has the declension noun ending for both males and females, thus making short forms of certain unisex names indistinguishable: for example, Sasha (Russian: Саша) is the short name for both the masculine name Aleksandr (Alexander) and the feminine form Aleksandra (Alexandra).

Some names, such as Zhanna (Jeana) and Mark, have no short forms; others may have two (or more) different forms. In the latter case, one form is usually more informal than the other.

====Diminutive forms====
Diminutive forms are produced from the &quot;short name&quot; by means of various suffixes; for example, Михаил Mikhail (full) – Миша Misha (short) – Мишенька Mishenka (affectionate) – Мишка Mishka (colloquial). If no &quot;short name&quot; exists, then diminutive forms are produced from the full form of the respective first name; for example, Марина Marina (full) – Мариночка Marinochka (affectionate) – Маринка Marinka (colloquial). Unlike the full name, a diminutive name carries a particular emotional attitude and may be unacceptable in certain contexts. Depending on the nature of the attitude, diminutive name forms can be subdivided into three broad groups: affectionate, familiar, and slang.

=====Affectionate diminutive=====
Typically formed by suffixes -&quot;еньк&quot;- (-yenk-), -&quot;оньк&quot;- (-onk-), -&quot;ечк&quot;- (-yechk-), -&quot;ушк&quot; (-ushk), as illustrated by the examples below. It generally emphasises a tender, affectionate attitude and is roughly analogous to German suffixes -&quot;chen&quot;, -&quot;lein&quot;, Japanese -&quot;chan&quot; and -&quot;tan&quot; and affectionate name-derived nicknames in other languages. It is often used to address children or intimate friends.

Within a more official context, this form may be combined with the honorific plural to address a younger female colleague.

=====Colloquial diminutives=====

Colloquial diminutives are derived from short names by the -&quot;к&quot;- (&quot;-k-&quot;) suffix. Expressing a highly familiar attitude, the use may be considered rude or even pejorative outside a friendly context.

=====Slang forms=====
Slang forms exist for male names and, since a few decades ago, female names. They are formed with the suffixes -&quot;ян&quot; (-yan), -&quot;он&quot; (-on), and -&quot;ок/ёк&quot; (-ok/yok). The suffixes give the sense of &quot;male brotherhood&quot; that was once expressed by the patronymic-only form of address in the Soviet Union. Originating in criminal communities, such forms came into wide usage in Russia in the 1990s.

===Early Soviet Union===
During the days of the October Revolution, as part of the campaign to rid Russia of bourgeois culture, there was a drive to invent new, revolutionary names. As a result, many Soviet children were given atypical names, often being acronyms/initialisms besides many other names above.

==Patronymics==
The patronymic name is based on the given name of the father and is written in all legal and identity documents. If used with the given name, the patronymic always follows it; but it is not analogous to an English middle name.

===Usage===
The patronymic name is obligatory when addressing a person of higher social stance and/or on special occasions such as business meetings; for example, when a pupil addresses a teacher, they are obliged to use both first and patronymic names – . Not using patronymic names in such situations is considered offensive.

Addressing a person by patronymic name only is widespread among older generations (more often – &quot;blue collar&quot;-male coworkers) and serves as a display of close relationship based on not only sympathy but also mutual responsibility.

===Derivation===
The patronymic is formed by a combination of the father&#x27;s name and suffixes. The suffix is -&quot;ович&quot; for a son, -&quot;овна&quot; – for a daughter. For example, if the father&#x27;s name was &quot;Иван&quot; (Ivan), the patronymic will be &quot;Иванович&quot; (Ivanovich) for a son and &quot;Ивановна&quot; (Ivanovna) for a daughter.

If the suffix is being appended to a name ending in a &quot;й&quot; (&quot;y&quot;) or a soft consonant, the initial &quot;o&quot; in the suffixes -&quot;ович&quot; and -&quot;овна&quot; becomes a &quot;е&quot; (&quot;ye&quot;) and the suffixes change to -&quot;евич&quot; and -&quot;евна&quot; . For example, if the father is &quot;Дмитрий&quot; (Dmitry), the patronymic is &quot;Дмитриевич&quot; (Dmitrievich) for a son and &quot;Дмитриевна&quot; (Dmitrievna) for a daughter. It is not &quot;Дмитрович&quot; (Dmitrovich) or &quot;Дмитровна&quot; (Dmitrovna) because the name &quot;Дмитрий&quot; (Dmitry) ends on &quot;й&quot; (&quot;y&quot;);

For some names ending in a vowel, the suffix is -&quot;ич&quot; for a son and -&quot;ична&quot; or -&quot;инична&quot; for a daughter; for example, Фока Foka (father&#x27;s first name) – Фокич Fokich (male patronymic) – Фокична Fokichna (female patronymic); Кузьма Kuzma (father&#x27;s first name) – Кузьмич Kuzmich (male patronymic) – Кузьминична Kuzminichna (female patronymic).

=== Historical grounds ===
Historical Russian naming conventions did not include surnames. A person&#x27;s name included that of their father: e.g. &quot;Иван Петров сын&quot; (Ivan Petrov syn) which means &quot;Ivan, son of Peter&quot;. That is the origin of most Russian -ov surnames.

Modern -ovich- patronyms were originally a feature of the royal dynasty (Рюриковичи, Ruerikovichi, Rurikids, which makes the East Slavic patronym in its original meaning being similar to German &quot;von&quot;. From the 17th century, the second name with suffix -&quot;ович&quot; (-&quot;ovich&quot;) was the privilege given by the tsar to commoners. For example, in 1610, Tsar Vasili IV gave to the Stroganovs, who were merchants, the privilege to use patronyms. As a tribute for developing the salt industry in Siberia, Pyotr Stroganov and all his issues were allowed to have a name with -&quot;ovich&quot;. The tsar wrote in the chart dated on 29 May, &quot;... &quot;to write him with &quot;ovich&quot;, to try&quot; [him] &quot;in Moscow only, not to fee&quot; [him] &quot;by other fees, not to kiss a cross by himself&quot; [which means not to swear during any processions]&quot; In the 18th century, it was the family of merchants to have patronyms. By the 19th century, the -ovich form eventually became the default form of a patronymic.

===Legal basis===
Everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a tripartite name. Single mothers may give their children any patronym, and this does not have any legal consequences. Foreigners who adopt Russian citizenship are exempted from having a patronym. Now, an adult person is entitled to change patronyms if necessary, such as to alienate themselves from the biological father (or to show respect for the adopted one) as well as to decide the same for an underage child.

=== Matronymic ===
In modern Russia, there are cases when women raising a child without a father give the child their own name instead of a patronymic. This practice is not recognized by law, but the civil registry offices may meet such wishes. A common loophole is when mother&#x27;s name is a feminine form of a masculine given name, even an obscure one.

==Family names==
Family names are generally used like in English.

===Derivation and meaning===

In Russian, some common suffixes are -&quot;ов&quot; (-ov), -&quot;ев&quot; (-yev), meaning &quot;belonging to&quot; or &quot;of the clan of/descendant of&quot;, e.g. Petrov = of the clan of/descendant of Petr (Peter), usually used for patronymic surnames—or -&quot;ский&quot; (-sky), an adjectival form, meaning &quot;associated with&quot; and usually used for toponymic surnames. Historically, toponymic surnames may have been granted as a token of nobility; for example, the princely surname Shuysky is indicative of the princedom based on the ownership of Shuya. Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin-Tavricheski had the victory title &#x27;Tavricheski&#x27;, as part of his surname, granted to him for the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire.

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, &quot;-off&quot; was a common transliteration of &quot;-ov&quot; for Russian family names in foreign languages such as French and German (like for the Smirnoff and the Davidoff brands).

Surnames of Ukrainian and Belarusian origin use the suffixes -ко (-ko), -ук (-uk), and -ич (-ych). For example, the family name &quot;Писаренко&quot; (Pisarenko) is derived from the word for a scribe, and &quot;Ковальчук&quot; (Kovalchuk) refers to a smith.

Less often, some versions of family names will have no suffix, e.g. Lebed, meaning swan, and Zhuk, meaning beetle (but see also Lebedev and Zhukov).

Hyphenated surnames like Petrov-Vodkin are possible.

===Grammar===
Eastern Slavic languages are synthetic languages and have grammatical cases and grammatical gender. Unlike analytic languages like English, which use prepositions (&quot;to&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, &quot;on&quot; etc.) to show the links and relations between words in a sentence, Eastern Slavic suffixes are used much more broadly than prepositions. Words need the help of some suffix to integrate them into the sentence and to build a grammatically correct sentence. That includes names, unlike in German. Family names are declined based on the Slavic case system.

The surnames that originally are short (&quot;-ov&quot;, &quot;-ev&quot;, &quot;-in&quot;) or full (&quot;-iy/-oy/-yy&quot;) Slavic adjectives, have different forms depending on gender: male forms &quot;-ov&quot;, &quot;-ev&quot;, &quot;-in&quot; and &quot;-iy/-oy/-yy&quot; correspond to female forms &quot;-ova&quot;, &quot;-eva&quot;, &quot;-ina&quot; and &quot;-aya&quot;, respectively. For example, the wife of &quot;Борис Ельцин&quot; (Boris Yel&#x27;tsin) was &quot;Наина Ельцина&quot; (Naina Yel&#x27;tsina); the wife of Leo Tolstoy was Sophia Tolstaya, etc. All other, i.e. non-adjectival, surnames stay the same for both genders (including surnames ending with -&quot;енко&quot; (&quot;-yenko&quot;), -&quot;ич&quot; (&quot;-ich&quot;) etc.), unlike in many West Slavic languages, where the non-adjectival surname of men corresponds to derivative feminine adjectival surname (Novák → Nováková). Note the difference between patronymics and surnames ending with &quot;-ich&quot;: surnames are the same for males and females, but patronymics are gender-dependent (for example, Ivan Petrov&quot;ich&quot; Mirov&quot;ich&quot; and Anna Petr&quot;ovna&quot; Mirov&quot;ich&quot;)

This dependence of grammatical gender of adjectival surname on the gender of its owner is not considered to be changing the surname (compare the equivalent rule in Polish, for example). The correct transliteration of such feminine surnames in English is debated: the names technically should be in their original form, but they sometimes appear in the masculine form.

The example of &quot;Иванов&quot; (Ivanov), a family name, will be used:

The surnames which are not grammatically adjectives (&quot;Zhuk&quot;, &quot;Gogol&quot;, &quot;Barchuk&quot;, &quot;Kupala&quot; etc.) declines in cases and numbers as the corresponding common noun. The exclusion is when a woman has a surname which is grammatically a noun of masculine gender; in such case, the surname is not declined. For example, Ivan and Anna Zhuk in dative case (&quot;to whom?&quot;) would be: Ивану Жуку (&quot;Ivanu &quot;Zhuku), but Анне Жук (&quot;Anne Zhuk&quot;).

Family names are generally inherited from one&#x27;s parents. As in English, on marriage, women usually adopt the surname of the husband; the opposite, when the husband adopt the maiden surname of his wife, very rarely occurs. Rarely, both spouses keep their pre-marriage family names. The fourth, very rare but still legal way is the taking a double surname; for example, in marriage of Ivanov (he) and Petrovskaya (she), the spouses may adopt the family name Ivanov-Petrovsky and Ivanova-Petrovskaya, correspondingly.

==Slavicisation of foreign names==
===Slavicisation of foreign surnames===

Some surnames in those languages have been russified since the 19th century: the surname of Kazakh former president Nursultan Nazarbayev has a Russian &quot;-yev&quot; suffix, which literally means &quot;of Nazar-bay&quot; (in which &quot;bay&quot; is a Turkic native noble rank: compare Turkish &quot;bey&quot;, Uzbek &quot;boy&quot; &quot;bek&quot;, and Kyrghyz &quot;bek&quot;). The frequency of such russification varies greatly by country.

After incorporation of Azerbaijan into the Soviet Union, it became obligatory to register their surnames and to add a Russian suffix such as &quot;-yev&quot; or &quot;-ov&quot; for men and &quot;-yeva&quot; or &quot;-ova&quot; for women. Since the majority did not have official surnames, the problem was resolved by adopting the name of the father and adding the mentioned suffixes. Examples are Aliyev, Huseynov, and Mammadov.

Since 1930s and 1940s, surnames and patronymics were obligatory in Uzbekistan. The surname could be derived from the name of the father by adding the suffixes -ev after vowels or soft consonants and -ov in all other cases. Examples are Rashidov, Beknazarov and Abdullaev. Most of the people born in this time had the same surname as their patronymic.

===Slavicisation of foreign patronymics===
By law, foreign persons who adopt Russian citizenship are allowed to have no patronymic. Some adopt non-Slavonic patronymics as well. For example, the Russian politician Irina Hakamada&#x27;s patronym is &quot;Муцуовна&quot; (Mutsuovna) because her Japanese father&#x27;s given name was Mutsuo. The ethnicity of origin generally remains recognizable in Russified names. Other examples are Kazakh &quot;ұлы&quot; (&quot;uly&quot;; transcribed into Latin script as &quot;-uly&quot;, as in Nursultan Abishuly Nazarbayev), or Azeri &quot;оглы/оғлу&quot; (&quot;oglu&quot;) (as in Heydar Alirza oglu Aliyev); Kazakh &quot;қызы&quot; (transcribed into Latin script as -&quot;qyzy&quot;, as in Dariga Nursultanqyzy Nazarbayeva). Such Turkic patronymics were officially allowed in the Soviet Union.

Bruno Pontecorvo, after he emigrated to the Soviet Union, was known as &quot;Бруно Максимович Понтекорво&quot; (Bruno Maximovich Pontekorvo) in the Russian scientific community, as his father&#x27;s given name was &quot;Massimo&quot; (corresponding to Russian Максим (Maksim)). His sons have been known by names &quot;Джиль Брунович Понтекорво&quot; (Gigl Brunovich Pontecorvo), &quot;Антонио Брунович Понтекорво&quot; (Antonio Brunovich Pontecorvo) and &quot;Тито Брунович Понтекорво&quot; (Tito Brunovich Pontekorvo).

==Forms of address==
===Common rules===
*For informal communication, only the first name is used: Иван Ivan. Even more informally, diminutives (several can be formed from one name) are often used. 
*In rural areas, the patronymic name alone (&quot;Петрович&quot; Petrovich, &quot;Ивановна&quot; Ivanovna) is used by old people among themselves, but young people sometimes use the form for irony. Also, younger people can use the form for much older people for both respect and informality. For example, a much younger man with a very good relationship with his elder colleague may use a patronymic and the &quot;ty&quot; form, but using the first name alone is generally inappropriate. Using a diminutive (like in most informal communication) would nearly always be very impolite.
*The family name alone (&quot;Петров&quot;, Petrov) is used, much more rarely, in formal communications. It is commonly used by school teachers to address their students. Informally, Russians are starting to call people by their surnames alone for irony.
* the form &quot;first name + patronymic&quot; (for instance, &quot;Иван Иванович&quot;, Ivan Ivanovich):
** is the feature of official communication (for instance, students in schools and universities call their teachers in the form of &quot;first name + patronymic&quot; only);
** may convey the speaker&#x27;s respect for the recipient. Historically, patronymics were reserved for the royal dynasty (Рюриковичи, Ruerikovichi)
* The full three-name form (for instance, &quot;Иван Иванович Петров&quot; Ivan Ivanovich Petrov) is used mostly for official documents. With some exceptions, everyone in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus is supposed to have a three-part name. This form is also used on formal occasions and for introducing oneself to a person who is likely to write down the full name, like a police officer. The family name is placed first (&quot;Петров Иван Иванович&quot;, Petrov Ivan Ivanovich) in various documents, when sorting by personal name is important.

Historically, diminutives of the given names were used in reference to commoners, to indicate an their low status: Stenka Razin, Grishka Rasputin, etc. A diminutive could be used by persons of a higher class when referring to themselves to indicate humility, e.g., when addressing to the tsar.

The choice of addressing format is closely linked to the choice of second-person pronoun. Russian language distinguishes:

* formal &quot;вы&quot; (vy, &quot;you&quot;); respectful &quot;Вы&quot; (&quot;Vy&quot;, &quot;You&quot;) may be capitalized in formal correspondence, but plural &quot;вы&quot; (&quot;vy&quot;, &quot;you&quot;) is not.
* informal &quot;ты&quot; (ty, &quot;you&quot;, &quot;thou&quot; in old English);

&quot;Вы&quot; (&quot;Vy&quot;) is the plural of both forms to address a pair or group. Historically, it comes from German, under Peter the Great, which uses &quot;du&quot; and &quot;Sie&quot; similarly.

Other than the use of patronymics, Russian forms of address in Russian are very similar to English ones.

Also, the meaning of the form of address strongly depends on the choice of a V-T form:

Using a &quot;ty&quot; form with a person who dislikes it or on inappropriate occasions can be an insult, especially the surname alone.

===Adjectives===
Other Eastern Slavic languages use the same adjectives of their literal translation if they differ from Russian analogue. All Eastern Slavic languages are synthetic languages, and grammatical genders are used. Thus, the suffix of an adjective changes with the sex of the recipient.

In Russian, adjectives before names are generally restricted to written forms of communication. Adjectives like &quot;Любимый / Любимая&quot; (lyubimiy / lyubimaya, &quot;beloved&quot;) and &quot;Милый / Милая&quot; (miliy / milaya, &quot;sweetheart&quot;) are informal, and &quot;Уважаемый / Уважаемая&quot; (uvazhayemiy / uvazhayemaya, literally &quot;respected&quot;) is highly formal. Some adjectives, like &quot;Дорогой / Дорогая&quot; (dorogoy / dorogaya, &quot;dear&quot;), can be used in both formal and informal letters.

<doc id="646426" wikidata="Q314814" url="?curid=646426" title="Philippe de Champaigne">
<text>Philippe de Champaigne (; 26 May 1602 – 12 August 1674) was a Brabant-born French Baroque era painter, a major exponent of the French school. He was a founding member of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture in Paris, the premier art institution in the Kingdom of France in the eighteenth century.

==Life and work==
Born of a poor family in Brussels (Duchy of Brabant, Southern Netherlands), during the reign of the Archduke Albert and Isabella, Champaigne was a pupil of the landscape painter Jacques Fouquier. In 1621 he moved to Paris, where he worked with Nicolas Poussin on the decoration of the under the direction of Nicolas Duchesne, whose daughter he would eventually marry. According to Houbraken, Duchesne was angry at Champaigne for becoming more popular than he was at court, and so Champaigne returned to Brussels to live with his brother. It was only after he received news of Duchesne&#x27;s death that he returned to marry his daughter.
After the death of Duchesne, Champaigne worked for the Queen Mother, Marie de Medicis, for whom he participated in the decoration of the Luxembourg Palace. He made several paintings for the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, dating from 1638. He also drew several cartoons for tapestries. He was made first painter of the Queen with a pension of 1200 livres. He also decorated the Carmelite Church of Faubourg Saint-Jacques, one of the favorite churches of the Queen Mother. This site was destroyed during the French Revolution, but there are several paintings now preserved in museums, that were part of the original design, such as &quot;The Presentation in the Temple&quot; in Dijon, the &quot;Resurrection of Lazarus&quot; in Grenoble, and the &quot;Assumption of the Virgin&quot; in the Louvre. 

He also worked for Cardinal Richelieu, for whom he decorated the Palais Cardinal, the dome of the Sorbonne and other buildings. Champaigne was the only artist who was allowed to paint Richelieu enrobed as a cardinal, which he did eleven times. He was a founding member of the Académie de peinture et de sculpture in 1648.
Later in his life (from 1640 onwards), he came under the influence of Jansenism. After his paralysed daughter was allegedly miraculously cured at the nunnery of Port-Royal, he painted the celebrated but atypical picture &quot;Ex-Voto de 1662&quot;, now in the Louvre, which represents the artist&#x27;s daughter with Mother-Superior Agnès Arnauld.

===Career===

Champaigne produced a large number of paintings, mainly religious works and portraits. Influenced by Rubens at the beginning of his career, his style later became more austere. Philippe de Champaigne remains an exceptional painter thanks to the brilliance of the colors in his paintings and the stern strength of his compositions.

He portrayed the entire French court, the French high nobility, royalty, high members of the church and the state, parliamentarians and architects, and other notable people. His portrait of the poet Vincent Voiture was created around 1649 as the frontispiece for Voiture&#x27;s published &quot;Works&quot; (published posthumously in 1650). The portrait is highly unusual in that Champaigne later reworked it as a portrait of a religious figure, Saint Louis (King Louis IX), to enable Voiture&#x27;s daughter to keep it with her when she entered a convent.

In depicting their faces, he refused to show a transitory expression, instead capturing the psychological essence of the person.

His works can be seen in public buildings, private collections, churches such as Val-de-Grâce, Sorbonne, Saint Severin, Saint-Merri, Saint-Médard and in the Basilica of Notre-Dame du Port in Clermont-Ferrand.

Champaigne was prominent enough in his time as to be mentioned in &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; in a line by Ragueneau referencing Cyrano: &quot;Truly, I should not look to find his portrait / By the grave hand of Philippe de Champaigne.&quot;

His pupils were his nephew Jean Baptiste de Champaigne, William Faithorne, Jean Morin, and Nicolas de Plattemontagne. During his last period Champaigne painted mainly religious subjects and family members. He died in Paris in 1674.

<doc id="646428" wikidata="Q2555897" url="?curid=646428" title="Lined flat-tail gecko">
<text>The lined flat-tail gecko (Uroplatus lineatus) is a gecko which is found in eastern Madagascar and on the island Nosy Bohara. These geckos live on trees in tropical rain forests and on bamboo plants. They reach a total length of 270 mm. Threats to this species are posed by deforestation and illegal pet trade.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Uroplatus&quot;, is a Latinization of two Greek words: &quot;ourá&quot; (οὐρά) meaning &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;platys&quot; (πλατύς) meaning &quot;flat&quot;. Its specific name, &quot;lineatus&quot;, is the Latin word for &quot;lined&quot; in reference to the longitudinal stripes on the lizard&#x27;s body.

<text>Francisco de Zurbarán ( , ; baptized 7 November 1598 – 27 August 1664) was a Spanish painter. He is known primarily for his religious paintings depicting monks, nuns, and martyrs, and for his still-lifes. Zurbarán gained the nickname &quot;Spanish Caravaggio&quot;, owing to the forceful use of chiaroscuro in which he excelled.

He was the father of the painter Juan de Zurbarán.

==Biography==

Zurbarán was born in 1598 in Fuente de Cantos, Extremadura; he was baptized on 7 November of that year. His parents were Luis de Zurbarán, a haberdasher, and his wife, Isabel Márquez. In childhood he set about imitating objects with charcoal. In 1614 his father sent him to Seville to apprentice for three years with Pedro Díaz de Villanueva, an artist of whom very little is known.

Zurbarán&#x27;s first marriage, in 1617, was to María Paet who was nine years older. María died in 1624 after the birth of their third child. In 1625 he married again to wealthy widow Beatriz de Morales. On 17 January 1626, Zurbarán signed a contract with the prior of the Dominican monastery San Pablo el Real in Seville, agreeing to produce 21 paintings within eight months. Fourteen of the paintings depicted the life of Saint Dominic; the others represented Saint Bonaventura, Saint Thomas Aquinas, and the four Doctors of the Church. This commission established Zurbarán as a painter. On 29 August 1628, Zurbarán was commissioned by the Mercedarians of Seville to produce 22 paintings for the cloister in their monastery. In 1629, the Elders of Seville invited Zurbarán to relocate permanently to the city, as his paintings had gained such high reputation that he would increase the reputation of Seville. He accepted the invitation and moved to Seville with his wife Beatriz de Morales, the three children from his first marriage, a relative called Isabel de Zurbarán and eight servants. In May 1639 his second wife, Beatriz de Morales, died.

Towards 1630 he was appointed painter to Philip IV, and there is a story that on one occasion the sovereign laid his hand on the artist&#x27;s shoulder, saying &quot;Painter to the king, king of painters&quot;. After 1640 his austere, harsh, hard-edged style was unfavorably compared to the sentimental religiosity of Murillo and Zurbarán&#x27;s reputation declined. 
Beginning by the late 1630s, Zurbarán&#x27;s workshop produced many paintings for export to South America.
&quot;Jacob and his twelve sons&quot;, a series depicting the patriarch Jacob and his 12 sons, seems to have been aimed at the South America market, but the originals were acquired for Auckland Castle in Bishop Auckland, Co. Durham, England.

On 7 February 1644, Zurbarán married a third time with another wealthy widow, Leonor de Torder. It was only in 1658, late in Zurbarán&#x27;s life, that he moved to Madrid in search of work and renewed his contact with Velázquez. Popular myth has Zurbarán dying in poverty, but at his death the value of his estate was about 20,000 &quot;reales&quot;.

==Style==

It is unknown whether Zurbarán had the opportunity to see the paintings of Caravaggio, only that his work features a similar use of chiaroscuro and tenebrism (dramatic lighting). The painter thought by some art historians to have had the greatest influence on his characteristically severe compositions was Juan Sánchez Cotán. Polychrome sculpture—which by the time of Zurbarán&#x27;s apprenticeship had reached a level of sophistication in Seville that surpassed that of the local painters—provided another important stylistic model for the young artist; the work of Juan Martínez Montañés is especially close to Zurbarán&#x27;s in spirit.

He painted his figures directly from nature, and he made great use of the lay-figure in the study of draperies, in which he was particularly proficient. He had a special gift for white draperies; as a consequence, the houses of the white-robed Carthusians are abundant in his paintings. To these rigid methods, Zurbarán is said to have adhered throughout his career, which was prosperous, wholly confined to Spain, and varied by few incidents beyond those of his daily labour. His subjects were mostly severe and ascetic religious vigils, the spirit chastising the flesh into subjection, the compositions often reduced to a single figure. Zurbaran&#x27;s &quot;incapacity or possibly scorn for narrative&quot; makes the actions depicted in his compositions difficult to interpret without foreknowledge of the subject. The style is more reserved and chastened than Caravaggio&#x27;s, the tone of color often quite bluish. Exceptional effects are attained by the precisely finished foregrounds, massed out largely in light and shade. Backgrounds are often featureless and dark. Zurbaran had difficulty painting deep space; when interior or exterior settings are represented, the effect is suggestive of theater backdrops on a shallow stage. The art historian Julián Gállego suggests that Zurbarán&#x27;s early training &quot;may have left him with a taste for Mannerist composition ... with the furniture and accessories placed on the slant&quot; in an ambiguous space devoid of unitary perspective. The resulting contradictions have been compared to Cubism for the way each object is represented in isolation. According to José Camón Aznar, &quot;Zurbarán succeeded in making a grace of his clumsiness&quot;.

Zurbarán&#x27;s late works, such as the &quot;Saint Francis&quot; (–1664; Alte Pinakothek) show the influence of Murillo and Titian in their looser brushwork and softer contrasts.

==Artistic legacy==
In 1631, he painted the great altarpiece of &quot;The Apotheosis of Saint Thomas Aquinas&quot;, now in the Museum of Fine Arts of Seville; it was executed for the church of the college of that saint. This is Zurbarán&#x27;s largest composition, containing figures of Christ, the Madonna, various saints, Charles V with knights, and Archbishop Deza (founder of the college) with monks and servitors, all the principal personages being more than life-size. It had been preceded by numerous pictures for the retable of St. Peter in the cathedral of Seville.

Between 1628 and 1634, he painted four scenes from the life of St. Peter Nolasco for the Principal Monastery of the Calced Mercedarians in Seville. In Santa Maria de Guadalupe he painted multiple large pictures, eight of which relate to the history of St. Jerome; and in the church of Saint Paul, Seville, a figure of the Crucified Saviour, in grisaille, creating an illusion of marble. In 1639, he completed the paintings of the high altar of the Carthusians in Jerez. Also in the 1630s he was commissioned to provide canvases representing the Labours of Hercules, the only group of mythological subjects from the hand of Zurbarán, which were installed in the Hall of Realms in Madrid. A fine example of his work is in the National Gallery, London: a whole-length, life-sized figure of a kneeling Saint Francis holding a skull.

In 1835, paintings by Zurbarán were confiscated from monasteries and displayed in the new Museum of Cádiz.

His principal pupils were Bernabé de Ayala, Juan Caro de Tavira, and the Polanco brothers; others included Ignacio de Ries.

Zurbarán was the subject of a major exhibition in 1987 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, which traveled in 1988 to Galeries nationales du Grand Palais in Paris. In 2015, the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum in Madrid presented &quot;Zurbarán. A New Perspective&quot;.

<doc id="646454" wikidata="Q761423" url="?curid=646454" title="Nirvana (1997 film)">
<text>Nirvana is a 1997 Italian cyberpunk science fiction film directed by Gabriele Salvatores. The film stars Christopher Lambert, Diego Abatantuono, Sergio Rubini, and Stefania Rocca. It was screened out of competition at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.

==Plot==
The film tells the story of a virtual reality game designer, Jimi (Christopher Lambert), who discovers that the main character of his game, Solo (Diego Abatantuono), has achieved sentience due to an attack by a computer virus. Asked by his creation (who feels everything the character in the game feels, including multiple deaths) to eliminate its existence, Jimi sets out to erase the game from the server of his employer, Okasama Star, before it&#x27;s commercially released on Christmas Day, and thus spare Solo further suffering.

Jimi has been depressed since his wife Lisa (Emmanuelle Seigner) left him. He decides to make his search for her a part of his quest to delete Solo and the game. Along the way he recruits Lisa&#x27;s friend Joystick (Sergio Rubini) and tech wizard Naima (Stefania Rocca) to help him avoid suspicious representatives of Okasama Star, who employ increasingly forceful methods to stop him. By the end, Jimi hacks into one of the company&#x27;s servers. This hack is in the world of virtual reality interpreted as encounters with persons from Jimi&#x27;s life; the network defends itself by projecting virtual representations of people such as Jimi&#x27;s father and Lisa. It tries to keep the hacker&#x27;s mind in the loop of his own memories as it burns the hacker&#x27;s brain. Jimi manages to pass through the network defence mechanism by freeing his mind, forgetting about life before or after, about bodily feelings, and entering a state of pure concentration where one focuses only on the target (in this case the server with the company&#x27;s bank account). It is similar to meditation where one tries to concentrate on breathing; people who are able to do this are referred to as angels (they are invisible to the system, can go anywhere they want, and their possibilities are limitless) in the film. In the end, Jimi feels enlightened and at inner peace with himself. He successfully deletes Solo, comes to terms with Lisa&#x27;s leaving him, and understands why things happened the way they did. He is in the state of Nirvana. Yet, during the film ending credits, a message flashes - &quot;Naima is on line&quot; - meaning the whole Nirvana intrigue was indeed a game within another game, that the player (the spectator) completed.

==Cast==
==Production==
The director, Gabriele Salvatores, shot the film mainly in the disused Alfa Romeo assembly plant in Portello, Milan. The whole place was converted in this sci-fi set where many ethnic sides of the city are shown. From the Indian to the Japanese to the Chinese, the film moves around the dynamic and the futuristic realms that the future created.

==Release==
&quot;Nirvana&quot; was released on 24 January 1997 in Italy on 112 screens and opened at number two at the Italian box office behind &quot;The Cyclone&quot; with a gross of $1.7 million for the weekend. It went on to gross $10 million Dimension Films picked up U.S. distribution rights in March 1997, and the film was dubbed in English and released in early 1998.

==Reception==
Margaret Pomeranz of Special Broadcasting Service rated the film 2 out of 5 stars and stated that the film is too serious and not very fun. Alan Jones of &quot;RadioTimes&quot; rated it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote: &quot;This stunning cyber-fantasy is rich in design and innovative ideas, and intellectually engages the mind while always remaining enjoyable on the purest pulp levels&quot;. Travis Mackenzie Hoover of Exclaim! stated the film is too derivative and has aged poorly. David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a visually impressive, existential sci-fi yarn&quot; that is &quot;shortchanged by a poorly structured story&quot;.

<doc id="646457" wikidata="Q7756302" url="?curid=646457" title="The Past Through Tomorrow">
<text>The Past Through Tomorrow is a collection of science fiction stories by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first published in 1967, all part of his &quot;Future History&quot;.

Most of the stories are parts of a larger storyline about the future rapid collapse of sanity in the United States, followed by a theocratic dictatorship, a revolution, and the establishment of a free society that does not save the pseudo-immortal Lazarus Long and the Howard families from fleeing Earth for their lives. Most editions of the collection include a timeline showing the chronology of the stories (including stories never written, such as &quot;The Stone Pillow&quot;, which was to occur during the period of the theocracy), times of birth and death of the significant characters, and commentary by Heinlein.

==Reception==
While regretting that several Future History stories Heinlein planned were never written, Algis Budrys praised the collection as &quot;some of the finest writing this field has ever known&quot;. He described the book as &quot;a magnificent compendium, coincidentally a rewarding and perhaps accurate cross-section of a writer&#x27;s career&quot;, and required for any science fiction library. In February 1968 he named the book the &quot;best publishing idea of the year&quot;.

<text>The Nashville Banner is a defunct daily newspaper of Nashville, Tennessee, United States, which published from April 10, 1876 until February 20, 1998. The &quot;Banner&quot; was published each Monday through Friday afternoon (as well as Saturdays until the 1990s and Sundays until 1937), and at one time carried as many as five editions.

The &quot;Banner&quot; name was relaunched in March 18, 2024 as a digital-only news outlet, funded by sponsorships and donations.

The &quot;Banner&quot; was long a voice of conservative viewpoints in contrast to its liberal morning counterpart, &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, although these views were greatly moderated in the paper&#x27;s twilight years. In its relaunch, the outlet has been significantly less conservative and is regarded as moderate.

==History==

The first edition of the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; was published on April 10, 1876. It was begun as a voice for the railroads and other interests in comparison with other area papers of the time which tended to take the viewpoint of workers and unions. It was long controlled by the Stahlman family.

The &quot;Banner&quot; was an evening paper, which at one time published as many as five editions (first, second, market final, sports final, and sunset final), although these were later consolidated into three editions, and eventually, two. For many years it was in a superior financial condition to its competitors, and in fact, when the rival &quot;Tennessean&quot; went bankrupt and almost had to cease publication, the &quot;Banner&quot; assisted in its purchase by the &quot;Evans&quot; family, who saved it. The &quot;Tennessean&quot; and the &quot;Banner&quot; entered into what was one of the first joint operating agreements in the U.S. in 1937. Under this agreement, which became a common model for many other cities over the next half-century, the papers maintained editorial independence and remained separate as news-gathering organizations. However, they were printed on the same presses, distributed by a common agent, and had a consolidated classified advertising department. They were fierce competitors in the realm of news and ideas, but no longer business competitors in the truest sense.

This arrangement stood both papers in good stead for many years. However, the &quot;Banner&quot; began to suffer in the post-World War II era from the slow loss of readership that became common to most U.S. evening papers, which was largely attributed to the rise of television.

Though the two papers shared many vital resources, they were vastly different in their editorial agendas. One memorable instance of such differences occurred during the mid-1960s as the merits of Daylight Saving Time were being debated. The &quot;Tennessean&quot;/&quot;Banner&quot; offices, at the time, featured a dual-sided clock on the roof. One side had the &quot;Tennessean&quot; logo, the other had the &quot;Banner&quot;&#x27;s. Silliman Evans, Jr., owner of the &quot;Tennessean&quot;, supported DST and set its clock accordingly during the summer hours, but the Stahlman family, who controlled the &quot;Banner&quot;, opted to keep their side of the clock on standard time, causing confusion for the many drivers and pedestrians on busy Broadway.

Ed Huddleston wrote for The Banner including coverage of the Civil War in Middle Tennessee in 1965 for the centennial of the war’s end and the fight to save the historic Bijou Theatre, demolished as part of an urban renewal plan and replaced by the Municipal Auditorium.

In the early 1970s the Stahlmans sold the &quot;Banner&quot; to the Gannett Co. Gannett published it for several years, but in 1979 announced that it was assuming publication of the &quot;Tennessean&quot; while selling the &quot;Banner&quot; back to local owners Irby C. Simpkins, Jr., Brownlee O. Currey, and John Jay Hooker (Hooker later sold his stake in the paper to Simpkins and Currey).

Although it took almost twenty years, this was the death knell for the &quot;Banner&quot;. It was now clearly inferior in resources to its morning counterpart, and its circulation continued to shrink. In the 1980s Gannett insisted on renegotiation of the joint operating agreement to its benefit, and the &quot;Banner&quot; had little choice but to comply. Another reason for the weakness of the &quot;Banner&quot; was its lack of a Sunday edition comparable to the Tennessean&#x27;s, which it had given up in the formation of the joint operating agreement. It had since always published on a six-day schedule, and as weekday papers, especially evening weekday papers, continued to decline, it did not have this profit center to draw upon. The &quot;Banner&quot; switched its Saturday edition for a while to a single, morning edition in direct competition with the &quot;Tennessean&quot;, then announced that it was terminating its Saturday edition entirely.

During this time, the &quot;Banner&quot; began to take far more moderate positions on issues on its editorial pages, although it generally remained more conservative than the &quot;Tennessean&quot; in most areas. It was in the contradictory situation of probably becoming more respected by people, especially those in the journalism community, at the same time that it was becoming less read.

The &quot;Banner&quot; adopted several new technologies soon before its demise, including early online efforts such as the launch of a daily e-mail newsletter (&quot;Nashville Banner Digest&quot;) in 1996, as usage of e-mail and the World Wide Web was becoming more common. It also built and maintained a website nearly a year before &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, although only five months before the &quot;Banner&quot; went out of business. The &quot;Banner&quot; newsroom also became one of the nation&#x27;s first to convert to the exclusive use of digital photography, completing the conversion just a few months before it ceased publication.

==Closing and Re-Launch==
The end occurred when the Gannett Co. made the publishers of the &quot;Banner&quot; a large offer to terminate the joint operating agreement. The offer was approximately $65 million, likely more than any profit that could have been made by the continued publication of the &quot;Banner&quot;, so it ceased to exist. (This was not considered by the Justice Department to be an antitrust violation, but when Gannett attempted to do the same thing with its &quot;Honolulu Advertiser&quot; and the evening paper in that joint operating agreement, the &quot;Honolulu Star-Bulletin&quot;, only a few months later, it was prosecuted as such, the merger was forestalled, and both papers continued to operate until 2010.)

The Banner&#x27;s final edition was published on Friday, February 20, 1998. The announcement to close was made public the previous Monday, February 16. Several of the Banner&#x27;s popular features and reporters, including columnists Mary Hance (&quot;Ms. Cheap&quot;) and Joe Biddle (sports), immediately went to &quot;The Tennessean&quot;.

On March 18, 2024, more than two decades later, the Nashville Banner re-launched as a free digital news outlet, funded by sponsorships and donations. The staff, though small, covers both news in the city of Nashville as well as the state legislature.

==Archives==
The archives of the &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; were donated to the Nashville Public Library. The collection features the entire archive, a vending machine with the final edition still displayed in the window, the many awards the paper won over the years, various trinkets from the paper&#x27;s offices, and a bronze statue of a paperboy selling the &quot;Banner&quot; which was originally placed on the plaza in front of the &quot;Tennessean/Banner&quot; offices. The archive is located at the downtown Nashville Public Library on Church Street and is open to the public.

<doc id="646472" wikidata="Q7113228" url="?curid=646472" title="Ovalipes ocellatus">
<text>Ovalipes ocellatus, commonly known as the lady crab, oscellated crab, or calico crab, is a species of crab in the family Ovalipidae. 

==Description==
The carapace of &quot;O. ocellatus&quot; is slightly wider than long, at wide, and long. The carapace is yellow-grey or light purplish, with &quot;leopardlike clusters of purple dots&quot;. It exhibits a limited iridescence as a form of signalling.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Ovalipes ocellatus&quot; is commonly known as the lady crab, oscellated crab, or calico crab. It was first described in 1799 by naturalist Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Herbst, who placed it into the genus &quot;Cancer&quot;. In 1898, carcinologist Mary Jane Rathbun moved the species to her new genus &quot;Ovalipes&quot;. &quot;O. ocellatus&quot; is part of a distinct group of &quot;Ovalipes&quot; which also includes &quot;O. floridanus&quot;, &quot;O. iridescens&quot;, &quot;O. molleri&quot;, and &quot;O. stephensoni&quot;. &quot;O. ocellatus&quot; is almost identical to &quot;O. floridanus&quot;, which lives in the Gulf of Mexico, but can be separated from the sympatric &quot;O. stephensoni&quot; by purple spots which &quot;O. stephensoni&quot; lacks. The following cladogram based on morphology shows the relationship between &quot;O. catharus&quot; and the other extant species of &quot;Ovalipes&quot;:

==Distribution==
The distribution of &quot;Ovalipes ocellatus&quot; extends along North America&#x27;s Atlantic coast from Canada to Georgia. &quot;O. ocellatus&quot; is &quot;probably the only &quot;Ovalipes&quot; species common north of Virginia&quot;, being replaced by &quot;Ovalipes stephensoni&quot; to the south.

==Diet==
The diet of &quot;Ovalipes ocellatus&quot; consists predominantly of bivalves, crustaceans including other crabs, polychaetes, cephalopods, and gastropods. It rarely feeds on fish.

==Life cycle==
&quot;Ovalipes ocellatus&quot; has five zoeal (larval) stages, lasting a total of 18 days at and a salinity of 30‰, and 26 days at and 30‰.

==Ecology==

&quot;Ovalipes ocellatus&quot; is nocturnal and often buries itself in the sand. It has been described as &quot;vicious&quot; and &quot;the crab most likely to pinch a wader&#x27;s toes&quot;.

<doc id="646478" wikidata="Q2310615" url="?curid=646478" title="Abiogenic petroleum origin">
<text>The abiogenic petroleum origin hypothesis proposes that most of earth&#x27;s petroleum and natural gas deposits were formed inorganically, commonly known as abiotic oil. Scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports a biogenic origin for most of the world&#x27;s petroleum deposits. Mainstream theories about the formation of hydrocarbons on earth point to an origin from the decomposition of long-dead organisms, though the existence of hydrocarbons on extraterrestrial bodies like Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan indicates that hydrocarbons are sometimes naturally produced by inorganic means. A historical overview of theories of the abiogenic origins of hydrocarbons has been published.

Thomas Gold&#x27;s &quot;deep gas hypothesis&quot; proposes that some natural gas deposits were formed out of hydrocarbons deep in the Earth&#x27;s mantle. Earlier studies of mantle-derived rocks from many places have shown that hydrocarbons from the mantle region can be found widely around the globe. However, the content of such hydrocarbons is in low concentration. While there may be large deposits of abiotic hydrocarbons, globally significant amounts of abiotic hydrocarbons are deemed unlikely.

==Overview hypotheses==
Some abiogenic hypotheses have proposed that oil and gas did not originate from fossil deposits, but have instead originated from deep carbon deposits, present since the formation of the Earth.

The abiogenic hypothesis regained some support in 2009 when researchers at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm reported they believed they had proven that fossils from animals and plants are not necessary for crude oil and natural gas to be generated.

==History==
An abiogenic hypothesis was first proposed by Georgius Agricola in the 16th century and various additional abiogenic hypotheses were proposed in the 19th century, most notably by Prussian geographer Alexander von Humboldt (1804), the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1877) and the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot. Abiogenic hypotheses were revived in the last half of the 20th century by Soviet scientists who had little influence outside the Soviet Union because most of their research was published in Russian. The hypothesis was re-defined and made popular in the West by astronomer Thomas Gold, a prominent proponent of the abiogenic hypothesis, who developed his theories from 1979 to 1998 and published his research in English.

Abraham Gottlob Werner and the proponents of neptunism in the 18th century regarded basaltic sills as solidified oils or bitumen. While these notions proved unfounded, the basic idea of an association between petroleum and magmatism persisted. Von Humboldt proposed an inorganic abiogenic hypothesis for petroleum formation after he observed petroleum springs in the Bay of Cumaux (Cumaná) on the northeast coast of Venezuela. He is quoted as saying, &quot;the petroleum is the product of a distillation from great depth and issues from the primitive rocks beneath which the forces of all volcanic action lie&quot;. Other early prominent proponents of what would become the generalized abiogenic hypothesis included Dmitri Mendeleev and Berthelot.

In 1951, the Soviet geologist Nikolai Alexandrovitch Kudryavtsev proposed the modern abiotic hypothesis of petroleum. On the basis of his analysis of the Athabasca Oil Sands in Alberta, Canada, he concluded that no &quot;source rocks&quot; could form the enormous volume of hydrocarbons, and therefore offered abiotic deep petroleum as the most plausible explanation. (Humic coals have since been proposed for the source rocks.) Others who continued Kudryavtsev&#x27;s work included Petr N. Kropotkin, Vladimir B. Porfir&#x27;ev, Emmanuil B. Chekaliuk, Vladilen A. Krayushkin, Georgi E. Boyko, Georgi I. Voitov, Grygori N. Dolenko, Iona V. Greenberg, Nikolai S. Beskrovny, and Victor F. Linetsky.

Following Thomas Gold&#x27;s death in 2004, Jack Kenney of Gas Resources Corporation has recently come into prominence as a proponent of the theories, supported by studies by researchers at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden.

== Foundations of abiogenic hypotheses ==

Within the mantle, carbon may exist as hydrocarbons—chiefly methane—and as elemental carbon, carbon dioxide, and carbonates. The abiotic hypothesis posits that the full suite of hydrocarbons found in petroleum can either be generated in the mantle by abiogenic processes, or by biological processing of those abiogenic hydrocarbons, and that the source-hydrocarbons of abiogenic origin can migrate out of the mantle into the crust until they escape to the surface or are trapped by impermeable strata, forming petroleum reservoirs.

Abiogenic hypotheses generally reject the supposition that certain molecules found within petroleum, known as biomarkers, are indicative of the biological origin of petroleum. They contend that these molecules mostly come from microbes feeding on petroleum in its upward migration through the crust, that some of them are found in meteorites, which have presumably never contacted living material, and that some can be generated abiogenically by plausible reactions in petroleum.

Some of the evidence used to support abiogenic theories includes: 
==Recent investigation of abiogenic hypotheses==
, little research is directed towards establishing abiogenic petroleum or methane, although the Carnegie Institution for Science has reported that ethane and heavier hydrocarbons can be synthesized under conditions of the upper mantle. Research mostly related to astrobiology and the deep microbial biosphere and serpentinite reactions, however, continues to provide insight into the contribution of abiogenic hydrocarbons into petroleum accumulations.
* Rock porosity and migration pathways for abiogenic petroleum.
* Mantle peridotite serpentinization reactions and other natural Fischer–Tropsch analogs.
* Primordial hydrocarbons in meteorites, comets, asteroids and the solid bodies of the Solar System.
** Primordial or ancient sources of hydrocarbons or carbon in Earth.
*** Primordial hydrocarbons formed from hydrolysis of metal carbides of the iron peak of cosmic elemental abundance (chromium, iron, nickel, vanadium, manganese, cobalt).
* Isotopic studies of groundwater reservoirs, sedimentary cements, formation gases and the composition of the noble gases and nitrogen in many oil fields.

Common criticisms include:

* If oil was created in the mantle, it would be expected that oil would be most commonly found in fault zones, as that would provide the greatest opportunity for oil to migrate into the crust from the mantle. Additionally, the mantle near subduction zones tends to be more oxidizing than the rest. However, the locations of oil deposits have not been found to be correlated with fault zones, with some exceptions.

==Proposed mechanisms of abiogenic petroleum==
===Primordial deposits===
Thomas Gold&#x27;s work was focused on hydrocarbon deposits of primordial origin. Meteorites are believed to represent the major composition of material from which the Earth was formed. Some meteorites, such as carbonaceous chondrites, contain carbonaceous material. If a large amount of this material is still within the Earth, it could have been leaking upward for billions of years. The thermodynamic conditions within the mantle would allow many hydrocarbon molecules to be at equilibrium under high pressure and high temperature. Although molecules in these conditions may disassociate, resulting fragments would be reformed due to the pressure. An average equilibrium of various molecules would exist depending upon conditions and the carbon-hydrogen ratio of the material.

===Creation within the mantle===
Russian researchers concluded that hydrocarbon mixes would be created within the mantle. Experiments under high temperatures and pressures produced many hydrocarbons—including n-alkanes through C10H22—from iron oxide, calcium carbonate, and water. Because such materials are in the mantle and in subducted crust, there is no requirement that all hydrocarbons be produced from primordial deposits.

===Hydrogen generation===
Hydrogen gas and water have been found more than deep in the upper crust in the Siljan Ring boreholes and the Kola Superdeep Borehole. Data from the western United States suggests that aquifers from near the surface may extend to depths of to . Hydrogen gas can be created by water reacting with silicates, quartz, and feldspar at temperatures in the range of to . These minerals are common in crustal rocks such as granite. Hydrogen may react with dissolved carbon compounds in water to form methane and higher carbon compounds.

One reaction not involving silicates which can create hydrogen is:
:Ferrous oxide + water → magnetite + hydrogen

The above reaction operates best at low pressures. At pressures greater than almost no hydrogen is created.

Thomas Gold reported that hydrocarbons were found in the Siljan Ring borehole and in general increased with depth, although the venture was not a commercial success.

However, several geologists analysed the results and said that no hydrocarbon was found.

===Serpentinite mechanism===

In 1967, the Soviet scientist Emmanuil B. Chekaliuk proposed that petroleum could be formed at high temperatures and pressures from inorganic carbon in the form of carbon dioxide, hydrogen or methane.

This mechanism is supported by several lines of evidence which are accepted by modern scientific literature. This involves synthesis of oil within the crust via catalysis by chemically reductive rocks. A proposed mechanism for the formation of inorganic hydrocarbons is via natural analogs of the Fischer–Tropsch process known as the &quot;serpentinite mechanism&quot; or the serpentinite process.
:(2&quot;n&quot;+1) 

Serpentinites are ideal rocks to host this process as they are formed from peridotites and dunites, rocks which contain greater than 80% olivine and usually a percentage of Fe-Ti spinel minerals. Most olivines also contain high nickel concentrations (up to several percent) and may also contain chromite or chromium as a contaminant in olivine, providing the needed transition metals.

However, serpentinite synthesis and spinel cracking reactions require hydrothermal alteration of pristine peridotite-dunite, which is a finite process intrinsically related to metamorphism, and further, requires significant addition of water. Serpentinite is unstable at mantle temperatures and is readily dehydrated to granulite, amphibolite, talc–schist and even eclogite. This suggests that methanogenesis in the presence of serpentinites is restricted in space and time to mid-ocean ridges and upper levels of subduction zones. However, water has been found as deep as , so water-based reactions are dependent upon the local conditions. Oil being created by this process in intracratonic regions is limited by the materials and temperature.

====Serpentinite synthesis====
A chemical basis for the abiotic petroleum process is the serpentinization of peridotite, beginning with methanogenesis via hydrolysis of olivine into serpentine in the presence of carbon dioxide. Olivine, composed of Forsterite and Fayalite metamorphoses into serpentine, magnetite and silica by the following reactions, with silica from fayalite decomposition (reaction 1a) feeding into the forsterite reaction (1b).

Reaction 1a:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Fayalite + water → magnetite + aqueous silica + hydrogen&quot;

Reaction 1b:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Forsterite + aqueous silica → serpentinite&quot;

When this reaction occurs in the presence of dissolved carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) at temperatures above Reaction 2a takes place.

Reaction 2a:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Olivine + water + carbonic acid → serpentine + magnetite + methane &quot;

or, in balanced form: 

However, reaction 2(b) is just as likely, and supported by the presence of abundant talc-carbonate schists and magnesite stringer veins in many serpentinised peridotites;

Reaction 2b:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Olivine + water + carbonic acid → serpentine + magnetite + magnesite + silica &quot;


The upgrading of methane to higher n-alkane hydrocarbons is via dehydrogenation of methane in the presence of catalyst transition metals (e.g. Fe, Ni). This can be termed spinel hydrolysis.

===Spinel polymerization mechanism===
Magnetite, chromite and ilmenite are Fe-spinel group minerals found in many rocks but rarely as a major component in non-ultramafic rocks. In these rocks, high concentrations of magmatic magnetite, chromite and ilmenite provide a reduced matrix which may allow abiotic cracking of methane to higher hydrocarbons during hydrothermal events.

Chemically reduced rocks are required to drive this reaction and high temperatures are required to allow methane to be polymerized to ethane. Note that reaction 1a, above, also creates magnetite.

Reaction 3:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Methane + magnetite → ethane + hematite &quot;&lt;br&gt;


Reaction 3 results in n-alkane hydrocarbons, including linear saturated hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, and cyclic compounds.

===Carbonate decomposition===
Calcium carbonate may decompose at around through the following reaction:

Reaction 5:&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Hydrogen + calcium carbonate → methane + calcium oxide + water &quot;&lt;br&gt;

Note that CaO (lime) is not a mineral species found within natural rocks. Whilst this reaction is possible, it is not plausible.

===Evidence of abiogenic mechanisms===
* Theoretical calculations by J.F. Kenney using scaled particle theory (a statistical mechanical model) for a simplified perturbed hard-chain predict that methane compressed to or kbar at (conditions in the mantle) is relatively unstable in relation to higher hydrocarbons. However, these calculations do not include methane pyrolysis yielding amorphous carbon and hydrogen, which is recognized as the prevalent reaction at high temperatures.
* Experiments in diamond anvil high pressure cells have resulted in partial conversion of methane and inorganic carbonates into light hydrocarbons.

==Biotic (microbial) hydrocarbons==
The &quot;deep biotic petroleum hypothesis&quot;, similar to the abiogenic petroleum origin hypothesis, holds that not all petroleum deposits within the Earth&#x27;s rocks can be explained purely according to the orthodox view of petroleum geology. Thomas Gold used the term &quot;the deep hot biosphere&quot; to describe the microbes which live underground.

This hypothesis is different from biogenic oil in that the role of deep-dwelling microbes is a biological source for oil which is not of a sedimentary origin and is not sourced from surface carbon. Deep microbial life is only a contaminant of primordial hydrocarbons. Parts of microbes yield molecules as biomarkers.

Deep biotic oil is considered to be formed as a byproduct of the life cycle of deep microbes.
Shallow biotic oil is considered to be formed as a byproduct of the life cycles of shallow microbes.

===Microbial biomarkers===
Thomas Gold, in a 1999 book, cited the discovery of thermophile bacteria in the Earth&#x27;s crust as new support for the postulate that these bacteria could explain the existence of certain biomarkers in extracted petroleum. A rebuttal of biogenic origins based on biomarkers has been offered by Kenney, et al. (2001).

====Isotopic evidence====
Methane is ubiquitous in crustal fluid and gas. Research continues to attempt to characterise crustal sources of methane as biogenic or abiogenic using carbon isotope fractionation of observed gases (Lollar &amp; Sherwood 2006). There are few clear examples of abiogenic methane-ethane-butane, as the same processes favor enrichment of light isotopes in all chemical reactions, whether organic or inorganic. δ13C of methane overlaps that of inorganic carbonate and graphite in the crust, which are heavily depleted in 12C, and attain this by isotopic fractionation during metamorphic reactions.

One argument for abiogenic oil cites the high carbon depletion of methane as stemming from the observed carbon isotope depletion with depth in the crust. However, diamonds, which are definitively of mantle origin, are not as depleted as methane, which implies that methane carbon isotope fractionation is not controlled by mantle values.

Commercially extractable concentrations of helium (greater than 0.3%) are present in natural gas from the Panhandle-Hugoton fields in the US, as well as from some Algerian and Russian gas fields.

Helium trapped within most petroleum occurrences, such as the occurrence in Texas, is of a distinctly crustal character with an &quot;Ra&quot; ratio of less than 0.0001 that of the atmosphere.

===Biomarker chemicals===
Certain chemicals found in naturally occurring petroleum contain chemical and structural similarities to compounds found within many living organisms. These include terpenoids, terpenes, pristane, phytane, cholestane, chlorins and porphyrins, which are large, chelating molecules in the same family as heme and chlorophyll. Materials which suggest certain biological processes include 

The presence of these chemicals in crude oil is a result of the inclusion of biological material in the oil; these chemicals are released by kerogen during the production of hydrocarbon oils, as these are chemicals highly resistant to degradation and plausible chemical paths have been studied. Abiotic defenders state that biomarkers get into oil during its way up as it gets in touch with ancient fossils. However a more plausible explanation is that biomarkers are traces of biological molecules from bacteria (archaea) that feed on primordial hydrocarbons and die in that environment. For example, hopanoids are just parts of the bacterial cell wall present in oil as a contaminant.

===Trace metals===
Nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and others metals frequently occur in oils. Some heavy crude oils, such as Venezuelan heavy crude have up to 45% vanadium pentoxide content in their ash, high enough that it is a commercial source for vanadium. Abiotic supporters argue that these metals are common in Earth&#x27;s mantle, but relatively high contents of nickel, vanadium, lead and arsenic can be usually found in almost all marine sediments.

Analysis of 22 trace elements in oils correlate significantly better with chondrite, serpentinized fertile mantle peridotite, and the primitive mantle than with oceanic or continental crust, and shows no correlation with seawater.

===Reduced carbon===
Sir Robert Robinson studied the chemical makeup of natural petroleum oils in great detail, and concluded that they were mostly far too hydrogen-rich to be a likely product of the decay of plant debris, assuming a dual origin for Earth hydrocarbons. However, several processes which generate hydrogen could supply kerogen hydrogenation which is compatible with the conventional explanation.

Olefins, the unsaturated hydrocarbons, would have been expected to predominate by far in any material that was derived in that way. He also wrote: &quot;Petroleum ... [seems to be] a primordial hydrocarbon mixture into which bio-products have been added.&quot;

This hypothesis was later demonstrated to have been a misunderstanding by Robinson, related to the fact that only short duration experiments were available to him. Olefins are thermally very unstable (which is why natural petroleum normally does not contain such compounds) and in laboratory experiments that last more than a few hours, the olefins are no longer present.

The presence of low-oxygen and hydroxyl-poor hydrocarbons in natural living media is supported by the presence of natural waxes (n=30+), oils (n=20+) and lipids in both plant matter and animal matter, for instance fats in phytoplankton, zooplankton and so on. These oils and waxes, however, occur in quantities too small to significantly affect the overall hydrogen/carbon ratio of biological materials. However, after the discovery of highly aliphatic biopolymers in algae, and that oil generating kerogen essentially represents concentrates of such materials, no theoretical problem exists anymore. Also, the millions of source rock samples that have been analyzed for petroleum yield by the petroleum industry have confirmed the large quantities of petroleum found in sedimentary basins.

==Empirical evidence==
Occurrences of abiotic petroleum in commercial amounts in the oil wells in offshore Vietnam are sometimes cited, as well as in the Eugene Island block 330 oil field, and the Dnieper-Donets Basin. However, the origins of all these wells can also be explained with the biotic theory. Modern geologists think that commercially profitable deposits of abiotic petroleum &quot;could&quot; be found, but no current deposit has convincing evidence that it originated from abiotic sources.

The Soviet school of thought saw evidence of their hypothesis in the fact that some oil reservoirs exist in non-sedimentary rocks such as granite, metamorphic or porous volcanic rocks. However, opponents noted that non-sedimentary rocks served as reservoirs for biologically originated oil expelled from nearby sedimentary source rock through common migration or re-migration mechanisms.

The following observations have been commonly used to argue for the abiogenic hypothesis, however each observation of actual petroleum can also be fully explained by biotic origin:

===Lost City hydrothermal vent field===
The Lost City hydrothermal field was determined to have abiogenic hydrocarbon production. Proskurowski et al. wrote, &quot;Radiocarbon evidence rules out seawater bicarbonate as the carbon source for FTT reactions, suggesting that a mantle-derived inorganic carbon source is leached from the host rocks. Our findings illustrate that the abiotic synthesis of hydrocarbons in nature may occur in the presence of ultramafic rocks, water, and moderate amounts of heat.&quot;

===Siljan Ring crater===
The Siljan Ring meteorite crater, Sweden, was proposed by Thomas Gold as the most likely place to test the hypothesis because it was one of the few places in the world where the granite basement was cracked sufficiently (by meteorite impact) to allow oil to seep up from the mantle; furthermore it is infilled with a relatively thin veneer of sediment, which was sufficient to trap any abiogenic oil, but was modelled as not having been subjected to the heat and pressure conditions (known as the &quot;oil window&quot;) normally required to create biogenic oil. However, some geochemists concluded by geochemical analysis that the oil in the seeps came from the organic-rich Ordovician Tretaspis shale, where it was heated by the meteorite impact.

In 1986–1990 The Gravberg-1 borehole was drilled through the deepest rock in the Siljan Ring in which proponents had hoped to find hydrocarbon reservoirs. It stopped at the depth of due to drilling problems, after private investors spent $40 million. Some eighty barrels of magnetite paste and hydrocarbon-bearing sludge were recovered from the well; Gold maintained that the hydrocarbons were chemically different from, and not derived from, those added to the borehole, but analyses showed that the hydrocarbons were derived from the diesel fuel-based drilling fluid used in the drilling. This well also sampled over of methane-bearing inclusions.

In 1991–1992, a second borehole, Stenberg-1, was drilled a few miles away to a depth of , finding similar results.

===Bacterial mats===
Direct observation of bacterial mats and fracture-fill carbonate and humin of bacterial origin in deep boreholes in Australia are also taken as evidence for the abiogenic origin of petroleum.

===Examples of proposed abiogenic methane deposits===
Panhandle-Hugoton field (Anadarko Basin) in the south-central United States is the most important gas field with commercial helium content. Some abiogenic proponents interpret this as evidence that both the helium and the natural gas came from the mantle.

The Bạch Hổ oil field in Vietnam has been proposed as an example of abiogenic oil because it is 4,000 m of fractured basement granite, at a depth of 5,000 m. However, others argue that it contains biogenic oil which leaked into the basement horst from conventional source rocks within the Cuu Long basin. 

A major component of mantle-derived carbon is indicated in commercial gas reservoirs in the Pannonian and Vienna basins of Hungary and Austria.

Natural gas pools interpreted as being mantle-derived are the Shengli Field and Songliao Basin, northeastern China.

The Chimaera gas seep, near Çıralı, Antalya (southwest Turkey), has been continuously active for millennia and it is known to be the source of the first Olympic fire in the Hellenistic period. On the basis of chemical composition and isotopic analysis, the Chimaera gas is said to be about half biogenic and half abiogenic gas, the largest emission of biogenic methane discovered; deep and pressurized gas accumulations necessary to sustain the gas flow for millennia, posited to be from an inorganic source, may be present. Local geology of Chimaera flames, at exact position of flames, reveals contact between serpentinized ophiolite and carbonate rocks.
Fischer–Tropsch process can be suitable reaction to form hydrocarbon gases.

==Geological arguments ==

===Incidental arguments for abiogenic oil===

Given the known occurrence of methane and the probable catalysis of methane into higher atomic weight hydrocarbon molecules, various abiogenic theories consider the following to be key observations in support of abiogenic hypotheses:
* the serpentinite synthesis, graphite synthesis and spinel catalysation models prove the process is viable
* the likelihood that abiogenic oil seeping up from the mantle is trapped beneath sediments which effectively seal mantle-tapping faults
* outdated mass-balance calculations for supergiant oilfields which argued that the calculated source rock could not have supplied the reservoir with the known accumulation of oil, implying deep recharge.
* the presence of hydrocarbons encapsulated in diamonds 

The proponents of abiogenic oil also use several arguments which draw on a variety of natural phenomena in order to support the hypothesis:

* the modeling of some researchers shows the Earth was accreted at relatively low temperature, thereby perhaps preserving primordial carbon deposits within the mantle, to drive abiogenic hydrocarbon production
* the presence of methane within the gases and fluids of mid-ocean ridge spreading centre hydrothermal fields.
* the presence of diamond within kimberlites and lamproites which sample the mantle depths proposed as being the source region of mantle methane (by Gold et al.).

===Incidental arguments against abiogenic oil===

Arguments against chemical reactions, such as the serpentinite mechanism, being a source of hydrocarbon deposits within the crust include:
*the lack of available pore space within rocks as depth increases.
**this is contradicted by numerous studies which have documented the existence of hydrologic systems operating over a range of scales and at all depths in the continental crust.
* the lack of any hydrocarbon within the crystalline shield areas of the major cratons, especially around key deep-seated structures which are predicted to host oil by the abiogenic hypothesis. See Siljan Lake.
* lack of conclusive proof that carbon isotope fractionation observed in crustal methane sources is entirely of abiogenic origin (Lollar et al. 2006)
* drilling of the Siljan Ring failed to find commercial quantities of oil, thus providing a counter example to Kudryavtsev&#x27;s Rule and failing to locate the predicted abiogenic oil.
* helium in the Siljan Gravberg-1 well was depleted in 3He and not consistent with a mantle origin
**The Gravberg-1 well only produced of oil, which later was shown to derive from organic additives, lubricants and mud used in the drilling process.
* Kudryavtsev&#x27;s Rule has been explained for oil and gas (not coal)—gas deposits which are below oil deposits can be created from that oil or its source rocks. Because natural gas is less dense than oil, as kerogen and hydrocarbons are generating gas the gas fills the top of the available space. Oil is forced down, and can reach the spill point where oil leaks around the edge(s) of the formation and flows upward. If the original formation becomes completely filled with gas then all the oil will have leaked above the original location.
* ubiquitous diamondoids in natural hydrocarbons such as oil, gas and condensates are composed of carbon from biological sources, unlike the carbon found in normal diamonds.

===Field test evidence===
What unites both theories of oil origin is the low success rate in predicting the locations of giant oil/gas fields: according to the statistics discovering a giant demands drilling 500+ exploration wells. A team of American-Russian scientists (mathematicians, geologists, geophysicists, and computer scientists) developed an Artificial Intelligence software and the appropriate technology for geological applications, and used it for predicting places of giant oil/gas deposits. In 1986 the team published a prognostic map for discovering giant oil and gas fields at the Andes in South America based on abiogenic petroleum origin theory. The model proposed by Prof. Yury Pikovsky (Moscow State University) assumes that petroleum moves from the mantle to the surface through permeable channels created at the intersection of deep faults. The technology uses 1) maps of morphostructural zoning, which outlines the morphostructural nodes (intersections of faults), and 2) pattern recognition program that identify nodes containing giant oil/gas fields. It was forecast that eleven nodes, which had not been developed at that time, contain giant oil or gas fields. These 11 sites covered only 8% of the total area of all the Andes basins. 30 years later (in 2018) was published the result of comparing the prognosis and the reality. Since publication of the prognostic map in 1986 six giant oil/gas fields were discovered in the Andes region: Caño Limón oilfield, Cusiana, Capiagua, Colombia, and Volcanera (Llanos basin, Colombia), Camisea (Ukayali basin, Peru), and Incahuasi (Chaco basin, Bolivia). All discoveries were made in places shown on the 1986 prognostic map as promising areas.

During the 1960s, Donald Hings was issued numerous patents for developing practical methods for locating likely locations of the deep morphological nodes most likely to indicate the presence of abiogenic hydrocarbons. His methods and technologies are used to this day by geophysicists to locate deep hydrocarbon deposits.

==Extraterrestrial argument==

The presence of methane on Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan and in the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune is cited as evidence of the formation of hydrocarbons without biological intermediate forms, for example by Thomas Gold. (Terrestrial natural gas is composed primarily of methane). Some comets contain massive amounts of organic compounds, the equivalent of cubic kilometers of such mixed with other material; for instance, corresponding hydrocarbons were detected during a probe flyby through the tail of Comet Halley in 1986.

Drill samples from the surface of Mars taken in 2015 by the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover&#x27;s Mars Science Laboratory have found organic molecules of benzene and propane in 3 billion year old rock samples in Gale Crater.

<text>Lubawa (, Old Prussian: &quot;Lūbawa&quot;) is a town in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, Poland. It is located in Iława County on the Sandela River, some southeast of Iława.

== Geographical location ==
Lubawa is located in Chełmno Land, approximately north-east of the town of Nowe Miasto Lubawskie, south-west of the town of Olsztyn and south-east of the regional centre of Gdańsk, at an altitude of above sea level.

==History==

In 1214 the local Prussian landlord Surwabuno was christened by Christian of Oliva, the first Catholic bishop of Prussia. The latter is nowadays featured on the coat of arms of Lubawa. The town was first mentioned in a papal bull of January 18, 1216, issued by Pope Innocent III. Soon afterwards a wooden castle was built. Within the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, the Bishopric of Culm was created in 1243 by William of Modena. In 1257 the town became a property of the church and the seat of the bishops of Culm (Chełmno). In 1268 the castle was destroyed. Between 1301 and 1326 a new castle was built of stone by the local bishop named Arnold. In 1330 it was destroyed by an invasion of Lithuanian forces of Gediminas, but was rebuilt. The town of Löbau was captured by the Kingdom of Poland after the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 but returned to the Teutonic Order once the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War ended. However the surrounding Land of Lubawa had gone partially to Masovia in the south.
In 1440 the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, at the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region and town to Poland in 1454. In the beginning of the Thirteen Years&#x27; War in 1454, the pro-Polish troops took over the local castle. The incorporation of the town to Poland was confirmed in the Second Peace of Toruń in 1466. It was part of the Chełmno Voivodeship and soon afterwards became a centre of local trade and commerce. As such it became one of the seats of the bishops of Chełmno. In 1533 it was razed to the ground by a great fire mentioned by Erasmus of Rotterdam, but it was soon rebuilt and between 1535 and 1539 Nicolaus Copernicus visited the bishop&#x27;s castle in Lubawa several times. At that time, the castle also housed an astronomical observatory. It was in Lubawa that the decision was made to publish Copernicus&#x27; groundbreaking work &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot;. In 1545 the town and the castle were yet again destroyed by a fire.

The town gained significant profits from the trade. In 1627 the castle was refurbished and became a Baroque style palace of Bishop Jakub Zadzik. By 1640 construction of water works and sewers had been completed. The town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772 through the First Partition of Poland. Part of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807–13) during the Napoleonic Wars, the town was again annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia after the dissolution of the duchy. In 1815 the palace was destroyed by a fire and in 1826 its walls were demolished. In 1820 the convent of the Benedictine Confederation was suppressed. The population was subjected to Germanisation policies. In 1831, several Polish infantry and artillery units, engineer corps, sappers and general staff of the November Uprising stopped in the town on the way to their internment places. In 1871 it became a part of the Prussian-led German Empire. During the Partitions of Poland, and until 1920, Löbau belonged to Kreis Löbau in Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder in the Province of West Prussia. According to the German census of 1890, the town had a population of 4,593, of which 2,300 (50.1%) were Poles.

As a consequence of the Treaty of Versailles following the rebirth of sovereign Poland the town was re-incorporated into Poland.
Following the 1939 invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the region was occupied by Nazi Germany, and from 26 October 1939 to 1945 as &quot;Löbau&quot; was administered as part of Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder in the new province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. The Polish population was subjected to various repressions and atrocities. The &quot;Einsatzgruppe V&quot; carried out mass searches of houses, offices etc. in September 1939. On 7 December 1939, the &quot;Selbstschutz&quot; carried out a public execution of 10 Polish inhabitants. The German Nazi regime housed a secret camp in the town for Polish children and teenagers aged 10–17, mostly boys. The children were subjected to forced labour, beatings, malnutrition and even executions. Children reaching the age of majority were deported to the Stutthof concentration camp and its subcamps. With the approaching Eastern Front, the camp was dissolved in January 1945 and the remaining children were deported to Germany. After the end of war, Lubawa was again part of Poland where it remained since then.

== Economy ==
Lubawa is an important centre of furniture industry. Also, a &quot;Lubawa S.A.&quot; company is located there, which is the biggest Polish producer of military equipment such as bulletproof vests, currently used by the Polish Army and the Polish press.

<text>Myron Leon Wallace (May 9, 1918 – April 7, 2012) was an American journalist, game show host, actor, and media personality. Known for his investigative journalism, he interviewed a wide range of prominent newsmakers during his seven-decade career. He was one of the original correspondents featured on CBS news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, which debuted in 1968. Wallace retired as a regular full-time correspondent in 2006, but still appeared occasionally on the series until 2008. He is the father of Chris Wallace.

Wallace interviewed many politicians, celebrities, and academics, such as Tina Turner, Joseph Bonanno, Vladimir Horowitz, Bobby Fischer, Luciano Pavarotti, Maria Callas, Malcolm X, Richard Nixon, Pearl S. Buck, Deng Xiaoping, Ronald Reagan, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Jiang Zemin, Ruhollah Khomeini, Kurt Waldheim, Frank Lloyd Wright, Yasser Arafat, Menachem Begin, Anwar Sadat, Louis Farrakhan, Manuel Noriega, John Nash, Gordon B. Hinckley, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Vladimir Putin, Barbra Streisand, Salvador Dalí, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, William Carlos Williams, Mickey Cohen, Roy Cohn, Dean Reed, Jimmy Fratianno, Morgan Freeman, Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, and Ayn Rand.

==Early life==
Wallace, whose family&#x27;s surname was originally Wallik, was born on May 9, 1918, in Brookline, Massachusetts, to Russian Jewish immigrant parents. He identified as Jewish and claimed it was his ethnicity (instead of religion) throughout his life. His father was a grocer and insurance broker. Wallace attended Brookline High School, graduating in 1935. He graduated from the University of Michigan four years later with a Bachelor of Arts degree. While a college student, he was a reporter for the &quot;Michigan Daily&quot; and belonged to the Alpha Gamma chapter of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity.

==Career==
===1930s–1940s: Radio===
Wallace appeared as a guest on the popular radio quiz show &quot;Information Please&quot; on February 7, 1939, when he was in his last year at the University of Michigan. He spent his first summer after graduation working on-air at Interlochen Center for the Arts. His first radio job was as a newscaster and continuity writer for WOOD radio in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This lasted until 1940, when he moved to WXYZ radio in Detroit, Michigan, as an announcer. He then became a freelance radio worker in Chicago.

Wallace enlisted in the United States Navy in 1943 and during World War II served as a communications officer on the , a submarine tender. He saw no combat but traveled to Hawaii, Australia, and Subic Bay in the Philippines, then patrolling the South China Sea, the Philippine Sea and south of Japan. After being discharged in 1946, Wallace returned to Chicago.

Wallace announced for the radio shows &quot;Curtain Time&quot;, &quot;Ned Jordan: Secret Agent&quot;, &quot;Sky King&quot;, &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, and &quot;The Spike Jones Show&quot;. It is sometimes reported Wallace announced for &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;, but Wallace said that he never had done so. From 1946 through 1948, he portrayed the title character on &quot;The Crime Files of Flamond&quot; on WGN and in syndication.

Wallace announced wrestling in Chicago in the late 1940s and early 1950s, sponsored by Tavern Pale beer.

In the late 1940s, Wallace was a staff announcer for the CBS radio network. He had displayed his comic skills when he appeared opposite Spike Jones in dialogue routines. He was also the voice of Elgin-American in the company&#x27;s commercials on Groucho Marx&#x27;s &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot;. As Myron Wallace, he portrayed New York City detective Lou Kagel on the short-lived radio drama series &quot;Crime on the Waterfront&quot;.

===1940s–1960s: Television===
In 1949, Wallace began to move to the new medium of television. In that year, he starred under the name Myron Wallace in a short-lived police drama, &quot;Stand By for Crime&quot;.

Wallace hosted a number of game shows in the 1950s, including &quot;The Big Surprise&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; and &quot;Who Pays?&quot;. Early in his career, Wallace was not known primarily as a news broadcaster. It was not uncommon during that period for newscasters to announce, to deliver commercials and to host game shows; Douglas Edwards, John Daly, John Cameron Swayze and Walter Cronkite hosted game shows as well. Wallace also hosted the pilot episode of &quot;Nothing but the Truth&quot;, which was helmed by Bud Collyer when it aired under the title &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. Wallace occasionally served as a panelist on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; in the 1950s. He also made commercials for a variety of products, including Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Fluffo brand shortening. In the summer of 1959, he was the host on the NBC game show &quot;Who Pays?&quot;.
Wallace also hosted two late-night interview programs, &quot;Night Beat&quot; (broadcast in New York City during 1955–1957, only on DuMont&#x27;s WABD) and &quot;The Mike Wallace Interview&quot; on ABC in 1957–1958. See also &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, section: Authorship controversy.

In 1959, Louis Lomax told Wallace about the Nation of Islam. Lomax and Wallace produced a five-part documentary about the organization, &quot;The Hate That Hate Produced&quot;, which aired during the week of July 13, 1959. The program marked the first time that most white people heard about the Nation, its leader, Elijah Muhammad, and its charismatic spokesman, Malcolm X.

By the early 1960s, Wallace&#x27;s primary income came from commercials for Parliament cigarettes, touting their &quot;man&#x27;s mildness&quot; (he had a contract with Philip Morris to pitch their cigarettes as a result of the company&#x27;s original sponsorship of &quot;The Mike Wallace Interview&quot;). 

Between June 1961 and June 1962, Wallace and Joyce Davidson hosted a New York-based nightly interview program for Westinghouse Broadcasting called &quot;PM East&quot; for one hour; it was paired with the half-hour &quot;PM West&quot;, which was hosted by &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; television critic Terrence O&#x27;Flaherty. Westinghouse syndicated the series to television stations that it owned and to a few other cities. WFAA channel 8 in Dallas, Texas carried it, but viewers in other southwestern states, in the Deep South and in the metropolitan areas of Chicago and Philadelphia were unable to watch it.

A frequent guest on the &quot;PM East&quot; segment was Barbra Streisand, though only the audio of some of her conversations with Wallace survives, as Westinghouse wiped the videotapes and kinescopes were never made or were thrown away. 

Also in the early 1960s, Wallace was the host of the David Wolper–produced &quot;Biography&quot; series.

After his elder son&#x27;s death in 1962, Wallace decided to get back into news and hosted an early version of &quot;CBS Morning News&quot; from 1963 through 1966. In 1964 he interviewed Malcolm X, who, half-jokingly, commented &quot;I probably am a dead man already.&quot; The black leader was assassinated a few months later in February 1965.

===1960s–2000s: &quot;60 Minutes&quot;===
Wallace&#x27;s career as the lead reporter on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; led to some run-ins with the people interviewed and claims of misconduct by female colleagues. While interviewing Louis Farrakhan, Wallace alleged that Nigeria was the most corrupt country in the world. Farrakhan immediately shot back that Americans were in no moral position to judge, declaring &quot;Has Nigeria dropped an atomic bomb that killed people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Have they killed off millions of Native Americans?&quot; &quot;Can you think of a more corrupt country?&quot; asked Wallace. &quot;I&#x27;m living in one,&quot; said Farrakhan.

Wallace interviewed General William Westmoreland for the CBS special &quot;The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception&quot; that aired on January 23, 1982. Westmoreland then sued Wallace and CBS for libel. The trial ended in February 1985 when the case was settled out of court just before it would have gone to the jury. Each side agreed to pay its own costs and attorney fees, and CBS issued a clarification of its intent with respect to the original story.

In 1981, Wallace was forced to apologize for a racial slur he had made about Blacks and Hispanics. During a break while preparing a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; report on a bank that had been accused of duping low-income Californians, Wallace was caught on tape joking that &quot;You bet your ass [the contracts are] hard to read if you&#x27;re reading them over the watermelon or the tacos!&quot;

Attention was again drawn to that incident several years later when protests were raised after Wallace was selected to deliver a university commencement address during a ceremony within which Nelson Mandela was awarded an honorary doctorate in absentia for his fight against racism. Wallace initially called the protesters&#x27; complaint &quot;absolute foolishness&quot;. However, he subsequently apologized for his earlier remark and added that when he had been a student decades earlier on the same university campus, &quot;though it had never really caused me any serious difficulty here ... I was keenly aware of being Jewish, and quick to detect slights, real or imagined... We Jews felt a kind of kinship [with blacks]&quot;, but &quot;Lord knows, we weren&#x27;t riding the same slave ship.&quot;

Wallace&#x27;s reputation has been retrospectively affected by his admission that he had harassed female colleagues at &quot;60 Minutes&quot; over many years. &quot;Back in the 1970s and ’80s, &quot;60 Minutes&quot; correspondent Mike Wallace was known for putting his hand on the backs of his female CBS News co-workers and unsnapping the clasps on their bras. &#x27;It wasn&#x27;t a secret. I have done that&#x27;, Wallace told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 1991.&quot; In 2018, claims of sexual misconduct at &quot;60 Minutes&quot; led to the resignation of executive producer Jeff Fager, who had assumed the role of Executive Producer following the retirement of the show&#x27;s creator, Don Hewitt. He resigned several months after a July 27 story by Ronan Farrow in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Not only did Farrow&#x27;s story accuse Fager of ignoring and enabling misconduct by several high-ranking male producers at &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, but Farrow also cited former employees who accused Fager himself of misconduct.

On March 14, 2006, Wallace announced his retirement from &quot;60 Minutes&quot; after 37 years with the program. He continued working for CBS News as a &quot;Correspondent Emeritus&quot;, albeit at a reduced pace. In August 2006, Wallace interviewed Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Wallace&#x27;s last CBS interview was with retired baseball star Roger Clemens in January 2008 on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Wallace&#x27;s previously vigorous health (Morley Safer described him in 2006 as &quot;having the energy of a man half his age&quot;) began to fail, and in June 2008 his son Chris said that his father would not be returning to television.

Wallace expressed regret for not having secured an interview with First Lady Pat Nixon.

==Personal life==

Wallace had two children with his first wife, Norma Kaphan. Their younger son, Chris, is also a journalist. Their elder son, Peter, died at age 19 in a mountain-climbing accident in Greece in 1962.

From 1949 to 1954, Wallace was married to his second wife, Patrizia &quot;Buff&quot; Cobb, an actress and stepdaughter of Gladys Swarthout. The couple hosted the &quot;Mike and Buff Show&quot; on CBS television in the early 1950s. They also hosted &quot;All Around Town&quot; in 1951 and 1952. She died in 2010.

He was married to his third wife, Lorraine Perigord, from 1955 until their divorce in 1986.

The same year as his divorce from his third wife (1986), he married his fourth and final wife, Mary Yates, the widow of one of his best friends and television producer, Ted Yates, who died in 1967 while on assignment for NBC News during the Six-Day War.

In addition to his two sons, Wallace had a stepdaughter, Pauline Dora, and two stepsons, Eames and Angus Yates.

For many years, Wallace unknowingly suffered from depression. In an article that he wrote for &quot;Guideposts&quot;, Wallace related, &quot;I&#x27;d had days when I felt blue and it took more of an effort than usual to get through the things I had to do.&quot; His condition worsened in 1984 after General William Westmoreland filed a $120 million libel lawsuit against Wallace and CBS over statements that were made in the documentary &quot;The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception&quot; (1982). Westmoreland claimed that the documentary made him appear as if he had manipulated intelligence. The lawsuit, &quot;Westmoreland v. CBS&quot;, was later dropped after CBS issued a statement explaining they never intended to portray the general as disloyal or unpatriotic. During the proceedings, Wallace was hospitalized with what was diagnosed as exhaustion. His wife Mary forced him to go to a doctor, who diagnosed Wallace with clinical depression. He was prescribed an antidepressant and underwent psychotherapy. Out of a belief that it would be perceived as weakness, Wallace kept his depression a secret until he revealed it in an interview with Bob Costas on Costas&#x27; late-night talk show, &quot;Later&quot;. In a later interview with colleague Morley Safer, he admitted having attempted suicide circa 1986.

Wallace received a pacemaker more than 20 years before his death, and underwent triple bypass surgery in January 2008. He lived in a care facility the last several years of his life. In 2011, CNN host Larry King visited him and reported that he was in good spirits, but that his physical condition was noticeably declining.

Wallace considered himself a political moderate. He was a friend of Nancy Reagan and her family for over 75 years. Nixon wanted Wallace to be his press secretary. Fox News said, &quot;He didn&#x27;t fit the stereotype of the Eastern liberal journalist.&quot; Interviewed by his son on &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot;, he was asked if he understood why people feel disaffection toward the mainstream media. &quot;They think they&#x27;re wide-eyed commies; liberals,&quot; Mike replied, a notion he dismissed as &quot;damned foolishness&quot;.

==Death==
Wallace died at his residence in New Canaan, Connecticut, from natural causes on April 7, 2012. The night after Wallace&#x27;s death, Morley Safer announced his death on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. On April 15, 2012, a full episode of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; aired that was dedicated to remembering Wallace&#x27;s life. He was buried at West Chop Cemetery in Tisbury, Massachusetts.

==Awards==
In 1989, Wallace was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Pennsylvania. Wallace&#x27;s professional honors included 21 Emmy Awards, among them a report just weeks before the September 11 attacks for an investigation on the former Soviet Union&#x27;s smallpox program and concerns about terrorism. He also won three Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards, three George Foster Peabody Awards, a Robert E. Sherwood Award, a Distinguished Achievement Award from the University of Southern California School of Journalism, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement, and a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award in the international broadcast category. In September 2003, Wallace received a Lifetime Achievement Emmy, his 20th. Most recently, on October 13, 2007, Wallace was awarded the University of Illinois Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Journalism.
* 1991: Paul White Award, Radio Television Digital News Association
* 1999: Gerald Loeb Award for Network and Large-Market Television for an investigative piece on the international pharmaceutical industry

==Fictional portrayals==
Wallace was played by actor Christopher Plummer in the 1999 feature film &quot;The Insider&quot;. The screenplay was based on the &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; by Marie Brenner, which was about Wallace caving in to corporate pressure to kill a story about Jeffrey Wigand, a whistle-blower trying to expose Brown &amp; Williamson&#x27;s dangerous business practices in the manufacture of cigarettes. Wallace disliked his on-screen portrayal and maintained that he was in fact very eager to have Wigand&#x27;s story aired in full.

Wallace was played by actor Stephen Rowe in the stage version of &quot;Frost/Nixon&quot;, but he was omitted from the screenplay of the 2008 film adaptation and thus the movie itself. In the 1999 American broadcast television movie &quot;Hugh Hefner: Unauthorized&quot;, Wallace is portrayed by Mark Harelik. In the film &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957), Wallace portrayed himself.

<text>In computing, gettext is an internationalization and localization (i18n and l10n) system commonly used for writing multilingual programs on Unix-like computer operating systems. One of the main benefits of gettext is that it separates programming from translating. The most commonly used implementation of gettext is GNU gettext, released by the GNU Project in 1995. The runtime library is libintl. gettext provides an option to use different strings for any number of plural forms of nouns, but this feature has no support for grammatical gender. The main filename extensions used by this system are .POT (Portable Object Template), .PO (Portable Object) and .MO (Machine Object).

==History==
Initially, POSIX provided no means of localizing messages. Two proposals were raised in the late 1980s, the 1988 Uniforum gettext and the 1989 X/Open catgets (XPG-3 § 5). Sun Microsystems implemented the first gettext in 1993. The Unix and POSIX developers never really agreed on what kind of interface to use (the other option is the X/Open catgets), so many C libraries, including glibc, implemented both. , whether gettext should be part of POSIX was still a point of debate in the Austin Group, despite the fact that its old foe has already fallen out of use. Concerns cited included its dependence on the system-set locale (a global variable subject to multithreading problems) and its support for newer C-language extensions involving wide strings.

The GNU Project decided that the message-as-key approach of gettext is simpler and more friendly. (Most other systems, including catgets, requires the developer to come up with &quot;key&quot; names for every string.) They released GNU gettext, a free software implementation of the system in 1995. Gettext, GNU or not, has since been ported to many programming languages. The simplicity of po and widespread editor support even lead to its adoption in non-program contexts for text documents or as an intermediate between other localization formats, with converters like po4a (po for anything) and Translate Toolkit emerging to provide such a bridge.

==Operation==

===Programming===

The basic interface of gettext is the function, which accepts a string that the user will see in the original language, usually English. To save typing time and reduce code clutter, this function is commonly aliased to codice_1:
printf(gettext(&quot;My name is %s.\n&quot;), my_name);
printf(_(&quot;My name is %s.\n&quot;), my_name); // same, but shorter
codice_2 then uses the supplied strings as keys for looking up translations, and will return the original string when no translation is available. This is in contrast to POSIX codice_3, AmigaOS codice_4, or Microsoft Windows codice_5 where a programmatic ID (often an integer) is used. To handle the case where the same original-language text can have different meanings, gettext has functions like codice_6 that accept an additional &quot;context&quot; string.

codice_7 is run on the sources to produce a codice_8 (Portable Object Template) file, which contains a list of all the translatable strings extracted from the sources. Comments starting with codice_9 are used to give translators hints, although other prefixes are also configurable to further limit the scope. One such common prefix is codice_10.

For example, an input file with a comment might look like:
/// TRANSLATORS: %s contains the user&#x27;s name as specified in Preferences
printf(_(&quot;My name is %s.\n&quot;), my_name);
codice_7 is run using the command:

 xgettext -c /

The resultant .pot file looks like this with the comment (note that xgettext recognizes the string as a C-language printf format string):

#. TRANSLATORS: %s contains the user&#x27;s name as specified in Preferences
#, c-format
#: src/name.c:36
msgid &quot;My name is %s.\n&quot;
msgstr &quot;&quot;
In POSIX shell script, gettext provides a codice_12 library one can include that provides the many same functions gettext provides in similar languages. GNU bash also has a simplified construct codice_13 for the simple gettext function, although it depends on the C library to provide a codice_2 function.

===Translating===
The translator derives a codice_15 (Portable Object) file from the template using the codice_16 program, then fills out the translations. codice_16 initializes the translations so, for instance, for a French language translation, the command to run would be:

 msginit --locale=fr --input=name.pot

This will create codice_18. The translator then edits the resultant file, either by hand or with a translation tool like Poedit, or Emacs with its editing mode for codice_15 files. An edited entry will look like:

#: src/name.c:36
msgid &quot;My name is %s.\n&quot;
msgstr &quot;Je m&#x27;appelle %s.\n&quot;
Finally, the .po files are compiled with codice_20 into binary codice_21 (Machine Object) files. GNU gettext may use its own file name extension codice_22 on systems with another gettext implementation. These are now ready for distribution with the software package.

GNU codice_20 can also perform some checks relevant to the format string used by the programming language. It also allows for outputting to language-specific formats other than MO; the X/Open equivalent is codice_24.

In later phases of the developmental workflow, codice_25 can be used to &quot;update&quot; an old translation to a newer template. There is also codice_26 for reverse-compiling codice_21 files, and many other utilities for batch processing.

===Running===
The user, on Unix-type systems, sets the environment variable codice_28, and the program will display strings in the selected language, if there is an codice_21 file for it.

Users on GNU variants can also use the environment variable codice_30 instead. Its main difference from the Unix variable is that it supports multiple languages, separated with a colon, for fallback.

== Plural form ==
The codice_31 interface accounts for the count of a noun in the string. As with the convention of codice_2, it is often aliased to codice_33 in practical use. Consider the code sample:
// parameters: english singular, english plural, integer count
printf(ngettext(&quot;%d translated message&quot;, &quot;%d translated messages&quot;, n), n);
A header in the codice_34 (empty string) entry of the PO file stores some metadata, one of which is the plural form that the language uses, usually specified using a C-style ternary operator. Suppose we want to translate for the Slovene language:

msgid &quot;&quot;
msgstr &quot;&quot;
&quot;Language: sl\n&quot;
&quot;Plural-Forms: nplurals=4; plural=(n%100==1 ? 1 : n%100==2 ? 2 : n%100==3 || n%100==4 ? 3 : 0);\n&quot;
Since now there are four plural forms, the final po would look like:

#: src/msgfmt.c:876
#, c-format
msgid &quot;%d translated message&quot;
msgid_plural &quot;%d translated messages&quot;
msgstr[0] &quot;%d prevedenih sporočil&quot;
msgstr[1] &quot;%d prevedeno sporočilo&quot;
msgstr[2] &quot;%d prevedeni sporočili&quot;
msgstr[3] &quot;%d prevedena sporočila&quot;
Reference plural rules for languages are provided by the Unicode consortium. msginit also prefills the appropriate rule when creating a file for one specific language.

==Implementations==
In addition to C, gettext has the following implementations: C# for both ASP.NET and for WPF, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Scala, and Node.js.

GNU gettext has native support for Objective-C, but there is no support for the Swift programming language yet. A commonly used gettext implementation on these Cocoa platforms is POLocalizedString. The Microsoft Outlook for iOS team also provides a LocalizedStringsKit library with a gettext-like API.

<text>Irving Chernev (January 29, 1900 – September 29, 1981) was a chess player and prolific Ukrainian-born American chess author. He was born in Pryluky, Ukraine, then a part of the Russian Empire and emigrated to the United States in 1905. Chernev was a national master-strength player and was devoted to chess. He wrote that he &quot;probably read more about chess, and played more games than any man in history.&quot;

Chernev&#x27;s deep love for the game is obvious to any reader of his books. Chess historian Edward Winter commented:
:Although Chess Notes items have shown that he sometimes cut corners, he was active at a time when writing and scholarship were not regarded as a natural pairing and when anecdotes and other chestnuts were particularly prevalent. Few were interested in sources. Above all, in the pre-digital age the work of writers in his field was far harder; they could not fill in gaps in their knowledge with press-of-a-button &#x27;research&#x27;. …

: Chernev&#x27;s output — clear, humorous and easy-going — gave the impression of effortlessness, but much industry lay behind it all. …

: Although his prose was often conversational, it was literate and carefully structured, bearing no resemblance to the ultra-casual &#x27;I&#x27;m-just-one-of-the-lads&#x27; stuff increasingly seen in chess books and magazines since his time. We have also been struck by the scarcity of typographical errors in Chernev&#x27;s writing throughout his life.

He wrote 20 chess books, among them: &quot;Chessboard Magic!&quot;, &quot;The Bright Side of Chess&quot;, &quot;The Fireside Book of Chess&quot; (with Fred Reinfeld), &quot;The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played&quot;, &quot;1000 Best Short Games of Chess&quot;, &quot;Practical Chess Endings&quot;, &quot;Combinations: The Heart of Chess&quot;, and &quot;Capablanca&#x27;s Best Chess Endings&quot;, the last of these being highly regarded by Edward Winter:

:Published by the Oxford University Press in 1978 and reprinted by Dover in 1982, &quot;Capablanca&#x27;s Best Chess Endings&quot; by Irving Chernev presents (in full algebraic notation) sixty complete games, annotated with emphasis on the final phase. Well over half are absent from the Golombek volume, a fact which underscores not only the inadequacy of Golombek&#x27;s selection but also Chernev&#x27;s readiness to embrace newly-found material. Written with deceptive casualness, &quot;Capablanca&#x27;s Best Chess Endings&quot; was, perhaps, Chernev&#x27;s finest book, combining hard analytical work and his customary screwball levity. Only Chernev could write annotations like (page 169) &#x27;“Don&#x27;t simplify against Capablanca!”, I keep telling them at the office&#x27;.

In 1945, he and Kenneth Harkness wrote &quot;An Invitation to Chess&quot;, which became one of the most successful chess books ever written, with sales reaching six figures. Perhaps his most famous book is &quot;Logical Chess: Move by Move&quot;, first released in 1957. This takes 33 classic games from 1889 to 1952, played by masters such as Capablanca, Alekhine, and Tarrasch, and explains them in an instructive manner. An algebraic notation version was published by Batsford in 1998, with minor alterations to the original text. Similar editions followed for &quot;Winning Chess&quot; and &quot;The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played&quot;. Chernev died in San Francisco in 1981. He was survived by his wife, Selma Kulik, and their son Melvin Chernev.

<text>Brunsbüttel (; Northern Low Saxon: &quot;Bruunsbüddel&quot;) is a town in the district of Dithmarschen, in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany that lies at the mouth of the Elbe river, near the North Sea. It is the location of the western entrance to the Kiel Canal.

==History==
The earliest reference to the town is in a document dated 14 July 1286.
 
With the construction of the Kiel Canal () in 1911, the town was divided in two.

During the opening days of World War II, on 4 September 1939, the No. 149 Squadron RAF carried out the second bombing of that war, targeting warships near the town.
== Economy ==
Brunsbüttel became an industrial area in the 1960s and 1970s. The &quot;ChemCoast Park Brunsbüttel&quot; is still the most important enterprise zone and at also the largest industrial area in Schleswig-Holstein.

=== Chemical plants ===
* Total S.A.
* Bayer MaterialScience
* Lanxess
* Sasol
* Yara International

=== Energy ===
* Vattenfall: Gas Turbine Power Station (near the Brunsbüttel Nuclear Power Plant which is out of service)
* A terminal to import of liquefied natural gas is under construction. Originally expected to become operational in approximately 2026, following the invasion of Ukraine by Russia it 

=== Harbours ===
* Brunsbüttel Ports GmbH (port operation and logistics)

==Twin towns - sister cities==

Brunsbüttel is twinned with:
* Horní Počernice (Prague 20), Czech Republic (2004)

==Notable residents==
* Horst Wohlers (born 1949), former football player, played 301 pro games, then a manager
* Dirk Busch (born 1951 in Brunsbüttelkoog), a professor, singer, songwriter, composer and music producer.
* Jennifer Oeser (born 1983), heptathlete

<text>John McCall () (1852/1853 – March 1, 1877), also known as &quot;Crooked Nose&quot; or &quot;Broken Nose Jack&quot;, was the murderer of Old West legend Wild Bill Hickok. McCall shot Hickok from behind as he played poker at Nuttal &amp; Mann&#x27;s Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, on August 2, 1876. McCall was executed for the murder on March 1, 1877.

==Early life==
Many details of McCall&#x27;s life are unknown. He was most likely born in the early 1850s in Jefferson County, Kentucky. McCall was raised in Kentucky with three sisters and eventually drifted west to become a buffalo hunter. By 1876, he was living in a gold mining camp outside Deadwood, under the alias &quot;Bill Sutherland&quot;.

==Murder of Hickok==

McCall was intoxicated while drinking alcohol at Nuttal &amp; Mann&#x27;s saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory, on August 1, 1876, when one of the players dropped out of a poker game that included &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok. The inebriated McCall quickly took his place. McCall proceeded to lose several hands, and was soon out of money. Hickok offered McCall money to buy breakfast and advised him not to play again until he could cover his losses. Though McCall accepted the money, he reportedly felt insulted.

The following day on August 2, 1876, another poker game was taking place at the saloon. On this particular evening, Hickok had his back to the door, in contrast to his normal practice of sitting in a corner to protect his back. Among the players at the table (sitting in the corner) was Charles Rich, who refused Hickok&#x27;s request to switch seats. Hickok reluctantly took the empty seat and joined the game, which was a fatal mistake. A drunken McCall entered the saloon, and ordered a drink from the bar. He proceeded to move down the bar, and stopped a few steps behind Hickok, as if to look at the hand he had been dealt. Not noticing McCall, Hickok said to another player, &quot;The old duffer. He broke me on the hand,&quot; his final words. McCall shot Hickok in the back of the head with a single-action .45-caliber revolver, shouting &quot;Damn you! Take that!&quot; Hickok died instantly. McCall ran out the back door of the saloon and tried to make his escape on a horse, but the saddle was loose, causing McCall to fall off. He was apprehended by several men shortly after.

==First trial==
An impromptu court was called to order with the prosecution, defense, and jury made up of local miners and businessmen. On trial the next day in McDaniel&#x27;s Theater, McCall claimed his actions were in retribution for Hickok having previously killed his brother in Abilene, Kansas. McCall was found not guilty after two hours. The verdict brought the &quot;Black Hills Pioneer&quot; to editorialize: &quot;Should it ever be our misfortune to kill a man... we would simply ask that our trial may take place in some of the mining camps of these hills.&quot;

==Second trial and execution==
Fearing for his safety, McCall soon left the area and headed into Wyoming Territory, where he repeatedly bragged at local saloons about killing Hickok in a &quot;fair&quot; gunfight. But Wyoming authorities refused to recognize the result of McCall&#x27;s acquittal on the grounds that the court in Deadwood had no legal jurisdiction. Because Deadwood was not under a legally constituted law enforcement or court system, officials argued that McCall could be tried for murder again. Agreeing, the federal court in Yankton, Dakota Territory, declared that double jeopardy did not apply, and set a date for a retrial.

The trial began on December 4, 1876. No witnesses were called for the defense, and the guilty verdict came in at 10:15 p.m. on December 6. McCall stated that he had been heavily intoxicated at the time of the murder and did not remember any details of the event. He requested a new trial, as well as claimed that his name was not really Jack McCall, and that he had changed it when he left home as a child. Judge Granville Bennett did not believe his story and sentenced McCall to death by hanging.

At 10:15 a.m. on March 1, 1877, McCall was hanged in a public execution in Yankton, at age 24.

==Aftermath and legacy==
McCall was buried in Sacred Heart Cemetery in Yankton County, South Dakota, a cemetery which was moved in 1881. When McCall&#x27;s body was exhumed, it was found to have the noose still around its neck. McCall was the first person to be executed by federal officials in the Dakota Territory.

The killing of Hickok and the capture of McCall is reenacted every summer evening (except Sundays) at the Masonic Temple in Deadwood.

<text>Vambraces (French: &quot;avant-bras&quot;, sometimes known as &quot;lower cannons&quot; in the Middle Ages) or forearm guards are &quot;tubular&quot; or &quot;gutter&quot; defences for the forearm worn as part of a suit of plate armour that were often connected to gauntlets. Vambraces may be worn with or without separate &quot;couters&quot; in a full suit of medieval armour. The term originates in the early 14th century. They were made from either boiled leather or steel. Leather vambraces were sometimes reinforced with longitudinal strips of hardened hide or metal, creating splinted armour. Sometimes vambraces were decorated with extravagant designs as was customary for nobles during the late middle ages.

<text>The Royal Irish Academy (RIA; ), based in Dublin, is an academic body that promotes study in the natural sciences, arts, literature, and social sciences. It is Ireland&#x27;s premier learned society and one of its leading cultural institutions. The Academy was established in 1785 and granted a royal charter by King George III in 1786. the RIA has 600 members, with regular members being Irish residents elected in recognition of their academic achievements, and honorary members similarly qualified but based abroad; a small number of members are elected in recognition of non-academic contributions to society. All members are entitled to use the honorific title MRIA with their names.

Until the late 19th century the Royal Irish Academy was the owner of the main national collection of Irish antiquities. It presented its collection of archaeological artefacts and similar items, which included such famous pieces as the Tara Brooch, the Cross of Cong and the Ardagh Chalice to what is now the National Museum of Ireland, but retains its very significant collection of manuscripts including the famous Cathach of Colmcille, the Lebor na hUidre (), the later medieval Leabhar Breac, the Book of Ballymote, and the Annals of the Four Masters.

==Work==
The RIA is an independent forum of peer-elected experts, operating on an all-Ireland basis, which draws on Members&#x27; expertise to contribute to public debate and policy formation on issues in science, technology and culture. It works across the academic world, and with government and business, and it leads national research projects, particularly in areas relating to Ireland and its heritage. The RIA also represents Irish learning internationally, operates a major research library, and is an academic publisher.

==Membership==
Election to Membership of the Academy is a public recognition of academic excellence and is sometimes held to be the highest academic honour in Ireland. Those elected are entitled to use the designation &quot;MRIA&quot; after their name. The criterion for election to membership is a significant contribution to scholarly research as shown in the candidate&#x27;s published academic work. However some of those elected to membership are not academics at all but receive the accolade in recognition of other contributions to society: these include former public servants, philanthropists, leaders in political and business life, and others.

===Regular membership===
To be elected to regular membership, a candidate has to be proposed and recommended by five Members, and selection is made by a rotating committee of existing Members, their names not made known outside the Academy. Presently, up to 24 Members are elected each year, equally divided between the sciences and humanities. Regular membership is open only to those resident in Ireland.
===Honorary membership===
Honorary membership can be awarded to persons who have made an outstanding contribution to their academic discipline, but who are normally resident outside the island of Ireland. At least two existing Members must propose and recommend a candidate for Honorary Membership. Honorary members are entitled to use the designation &quot;Hon. MRIA&quot; after their name.

==Publishing==
The Academy is one of the longest-established publishers in Ireland, having commenced in 1787. The Academy currently publishes six journals:
* &quot;Ériu&quot;
* &quot;Irish Studies in International Affairs&quot;
* &quot;Mathematical Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy&quot;
* &quot;Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy&quot;: Archaeology, Culture, History, Literature
* &quot;Irish Journal of Earth Sciences&quot;
* &quot;Biology and Environment&quot;

The Academy&#x27;s research projects also regularly publish the &quot;Irish Historic Towns Atlas&quot; series, the &quot;Documents on Irish Foreign Policy&quot;, &quot;Foclóir na nua-Ghaeilge&quot;, the &quot;Dictionary of Medieval Latin from Celtic Sources&quot;, and the &quot;New Survey of Clare Island&quot;. In 2014 the Academy published (in association with Yale University Press) the five-volume &quot;Art and Architecture of Ireland&quot;.

The Academy is committed to publishing work which not only influences scholarship, but also the wider community, for example &quot;Flashes of Brilliance&quot; by Dick Ahlstrom, and &quot;Judging Dev&quot; by Diarmaid Ferriter. Both of these publications have been accompanied by either a television or a radio series.

==Research projects==
The Academy manages a number of high-profile research projects in the sciences and humanities. Past projects have included The Digital Humanities Observatory (DHO), New Survey of Clare Island (NSCI), The Origins of the Irish Constitution (OIC), and the &quot;Dictionary of Irish Biography&quot; (DIB).

Other projects include:

*Dictionary of Medieval Latin from Celtic Sources (DMLCS)
*Documents on Irish Foreign Policy (DIFP)
*Foclóir na nua-Ghaeilge (Dictionary of Modern Irish) Online Historical Irish Corpus 1600–1926 
*Irish Historic Towns Atlas (IHTA)
*Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI)

==Academy committees==
During the 1950s the Academy began forming national committees, each relating to a specific discipline. Today these act as strategic national fora, providing input into policy, research priorities and issues of public concern, such as climate change. They also organise public outreach activities, such as lectures and public interviews, and award grants for research and travel. The Academy committees are made up of both Members and non-Members, including representatives from universities, research institutions, government agencies and, where appropriate, industry. They include: Life and Medical Sciences; Physical, Chemical and Mathematical Sciences; Climate Change and Environmental Sciences; Engineering and Computer Sciences; Geosciences and Geographical Sciences; Ethical, Political, Legal and Philosophical Studies; Historical Studies; Social Sciences; Study of Languages, Literature, Culture and Communication; and Coiste Léann na Gaeilge, Litríocht na Gaeilge agus na gCultúr Ceilteach.
There are also Standing Committees for Archaeology, International Affairs and North-South matters.

==Headquarters==

The first meeting of the academy were held at the Earl of Charlemont&#x27;s personal residence Charlemont House.

===Navigation House===
On application to the Commissioners of Inland Navigation, the academy was then granted the use of a building at 114 Grafton Street named Navigation House around 1787, previously used by the Grand Canal Company. The building had originally been constructed in 1766 as the dedicated offices of the Commissioners of Inland Navigation alongside the then headquarters of the Dublin Society which they eventually sold on in 1796.

The academy had already been using the building for meetings from 1785.

===Academy House===

In 1852 the Royal Irish Academy moved to its current premises at 19 Dawson Street, Dublin 2, known as Academy House.

Built in , the building has fine decorative plasterwork and a meeting room designed in 1854 by Frederick Clarendon and now used for conferences, exhibitions and public talks. The Academy allows the use of these meeting rooms by external bodies when its own activities permit.

Academy House was home to many of Ireland&#x27;s finest national treasures, including the Ardagh Chalice and the Tara Brooch, until 1890 when the Academy transferred its collections to the newly established National Museum of Ireland.

===Library===
The Academy Library holds the largest collection of Old Irish manuscripts in the world, and is an important research centre for studies covering Irish history, language, archaeology and the history of Irish science. The Library is home to the sixth-century Latin psalter, the &quot;Cathach&quot;, reputedly copied by St Columcille. The Library also holds the personal library and a harp belonging to Thomas Moore and the philological collection of Osborn J. Bergin.

==Governance==
The President and Council are responsible for the Academy&#x27;s general government and regulation. They are elected annually at the Stated Meeting on 16 March. The President normally serves a three-year term of office. The membership of the Council is drawn from the Sciences and Humanities sections. The Council formulates policies and recommends candidates for membership.

The Executive Committee supports the Council in supervising the day-to-day business of the Academy. The members of the Executive Committee are the President, Senior Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Secretaries of Science and PL&amp;A (Polite Literature &amp; Antiquities, i.e. Humanities), Executive Secretary, Secretary for International Relations, and a staff representative.

The Royal Irish Academy became a prescribed body under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and the Freedom of Information Act (Amendment) 2003, on 31 May 2006.

===Presidents===
==Awards of the Royal Irish Academy==
The premier award of the Royal Irish Academy is the Cunningham Medal, which it awards every three years in recognition of &quot;outstanding contributions to scholarship and the objectives of the Academy.&quot; Other awards include the Gold Medals which are awarded to two people each year who &quot;made a demonstrable and internationally recognised outstanding scholarly contribution in their fields,&quot; and US-Ireland Research Innovation Awards which are awarded annually in three categories HEIs, Multinationals and SMEs.

The Royal Irish Academy also operates a number of prizes including the annual Hamilton Prize for Mathematics which it awards to the best mathematic students as nominated by academic institutions, the Kathleen Lonsdale Prize for Chemistry which is awarded to the most outstanding Irish Ph.D. thesis in the general area of the chemical sciences, and the biennial RIA Michel Deon Prize for Non-Fiction which honours the life of Michel Déon (1919–2016) by continuing his work in supporting and championing writing talent and sustains his legacy in celebrating the richness and diversity of cultural experience in Europe.

<text>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74 (2004), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that, in a criminal proceeding in federal court, a defendant who does not alert the district court to a possible violation of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure must show on appeal that the violation affirmatively affected his rights in order to obtain reversal of his conviction by guilty plea. Rule 11, which pertains to criminal prosecutions in United States federal courts only, governs the offering of plea bargains to criminal defendants and the procedures district courts must employ to ensure that the defendant knows of and properly waives his trial-related constitutional rights.

In &quot;Benitez&quot;, the trial court violated Rule 11 when it took the defendant&#x27;s plea by failing to warn him that the plea could not be withdrawn if the court did not accept the prosecution&#x27;s sentencing recommendations. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction, considering that the non-English speaking defendant did not understand his rights under those circumstances.

The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, ruling the Court of Appeals had applied the wrong test by not requiring the defendant to show how the error actually prejudiced the proceedings. The Court of Appeals had consequently failed to consider the entire record regarding what the defendant understood. An eight-justice majority of the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice David Souter, held that a defendant attempting to reverse his conviction due to a Rule 11 violation must show a reasonable probability that, but for the trial court&#x27;s error, he would not have entered the plea. Justice Antonin Scalia concurred in the judgment but disagreed with the majority&#x27;s standard.

==Background of the case==
===Arrest and indictment===
Carlos Dominguez Benitez arranged to sell several pounds of methamphetamine to an informant secretly working with law enforcement. Benitez was arrested while making the sale, confessed, and gave information on his supplier and fellow drug dealers. Benitez was then indicted by a federal grand jury under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 for conspiracy to possess more than of a methamphetamine mixture, and for possession of of a methamphetamine mixture, both with intent to distribute. Under the statutory sentencing ranges, Benitez faced anywhere from ten years to life in prison, and his court-appointed counsel began discussing a plea bargain while he faced trial before the United States District Court for the Central District of California.

===Plea agreement and District Court sentencing===
Benitez, who could only speak and write in Spanish, sent several letters to the District Court, in which he expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney and the plea agreement he was being encouraged to sign. During a hearing, however, Benitez expressed that he did not want to go to trial but just wanted a better deal, and the court declined to make any change. Benitez and the federal prosecutor subsequently agreed that he would plead guilty to the conspiracy charge in exchange for the possession charge being dropped, and that the prosecutor would stipulate to a &quot;safety valve&quot; that would allow him to avoid the statutory ten year minimum sentence, provided he could meet the statutory conditions. Benitez was warned in discussion with the prosecutor and in the written plea agreement that the agreement was not binding on the District Court, and that Benitez would not be able to withdraw his guilty plea if the court rejected the prosecutor&#x27;s recommendations.

However, at the hearing the next day when Benitez entered his guilty plea, District Court judge Alicemarie H. Stotler failed to deliver the warning required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(3)(B) that he would not be able to withdraw his plea. Benitez&#x27;s earlier criminal convictions under a different name were subsequently discovered, which rendered him ineligible for the &quot;safety valve.&quot; He was then sentenced to the statutory minimum of ten years in prison over his objection that he was never told what the conditions of the &quot;safety valve&quot; sentence reduction were.

===Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision===
Benitez appealed his conviction and sentencing to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that the District Court&#x27;s failure to comply with all of the required Rule 11 warnings was ground for reversal. A three-judge panel of the court consisting of Circuit Judges James R. Browning, Stephen Reinhardt, and Richard C. Tallman voted 2-1 to reverse his conviction and sentence. The court&#x27;s opinion was written by Judge Browning, and the dissent by Judge Tallman.

Because Benitez did not object to the District Court&#x27;s failure prior to his conviction, the error was not preserved for appeal and so was reviewed under the plain error standard of Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b), pursuant to the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;United States v. Vonn&quot;, 535 U.S. 55 (2002). The Court of Appeals applied a two part test to determine whether plain error had been committed. First, the defendant had to establish that the court&#x27;s error was not &quot;merely minor or technical.&quot; The court considered this satisfied by the inherently serious nature of a Rule 11 violation alone, because the rule was intended to ensure that a defendant&#x27;s plea was made intelligently and knowingly. Second, the defendant had to establish that he did not understand the rights at issue when he entered his guilty plea. The court found that this second element was satisfied because Benitez&#x27;s language barrier had prevented him from gaining a full understanding of his rights from only the written plea agreement and other comments made by the court.

Judge Tallman&#x27;s dissent argued that &quot;Vonn&quot; required the court to view the proceedings as a whole in determining whether the Rule 11 violation constituted plain error. He believed that although the record showed that the Rule 11 &quot;magic words&quot; may not have been spoken, Benitez&#x27;s counsel and the District Court had fully discussed the plea agreement with him, and that he had expressed understanding of all the relevant issues.

==The court&#x27;s decision==
The Supreme Court granted review on the narrow issue of on what basis a court&#x27;s failure to comply with Rule 11 constitutes reversible error, and unanimously reversed. Justice David Souter wrote the majority opinion, which seven Justices joined. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.

The Court stated that even for preserved errors, only those that structurally &quot;undermine the fairness of a criminal proceeding as a whole&quot; require reversal without a consideration of the effect the error had on the proceeding. The omission of a Rule 11 warning alone does not fall into this category. Furthermore, the Rule 52 phrase &quot;error that affects substantial rights,&quot; which is used in Rule 52, &quot;has previously been taken to mean error with a prejudicial effect on the outcome of a judicial proceeding.&quot; The Court concluded by holding that &quot;a defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.&quot; The Court explained that a reasonable probability is one that is &quot;sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome&quot; of the proceeding.

In the Court&#x27;s view—essentially the same as Judge Tallman&#x27;s—the Court of Appeals&#x27; standard failed because it did not consider record evidence that tended to show that any misunderstanding was inconsequential, or what the relative significance of the factors involved in Benitez&#x27;s plea decision were regardless of the Rule 11 error. The Court acknowledged that the standard it imposed would be very rarely met, but that it was still easier than if the defendant had to prove the claim by a preponderance of the evidence.

Though the Supreme Court did not explicitly decide whether Benitez met the proper standard, its opinion nonetheless proceeded with an unfavorable analysis of his case. The Court believed that his statements in the record showed that he may have been confused about the substantive law of the safety valve provision, but not that there was a &quot;causal link&quot; between his confusion and the Rule 11 violation. The strength of the government&#x27;s case was also a factor, and the Court did not think that the proper Rule 11 warning would have changed his &quot;assessment of his strategic position.&quot; This was especially true because the written plea agreement included the warning that it would be irrevocable, and it had been read to him in Spanish. The Court accordingly reversed the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case.

===Scalia&#x27;s concurrence===
In a short separate opinion, Justice Scalia expressed agreement with much of the Court&#x27;s analysis, but disagreed with the standard of probability the Court required the defendant to meet. Scalia listed four different standards that the Court had adopted in different contexts to prove what would have happened in a trial absent error, and stated that these &quot;ineffable gradations of probability&quot; confused judicial reasoning more than aided it. He wrote that a court could only achieve the precision of two standards—beyond a reasonable doubt, and by a preponderance of the evidence—and that the latter should apply to the claim at issue.

==Subsequent developments==
Upon remand from the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals affirmed Benitez&#x27;s conviction and sentencing in a &quot;per curiam&quot;, summary opinion.

<doc id="646519" wikidata="Q847818" url="?curid=646519" title="The Hanson Brothers (band)">
<text>The Hanson Brothers were a Canadian punk rock band formed in 1984 in Victoria and later based in Vancouver. The group included John and Rob Wright and Tom Holliston, all members of the punk rock band Nomeansno. The Hanson Brothers&#x27; band name references characters in the cult ice hockey film &quot;Slap Shot&quot;.

==History==
From 1984 to 1989, the Wright brothers (John on drums and Rob on bass guitar) and original NoMeansNo guitarist Andy Kerr performed Ramones cover sets sporadically under the name The Hanson Brothers. The Hanson Brothers later began to write &quot;their own Ramones songs&quot; i.e., original songs in the fast, melodic style of the Ramones. At this time John Wright played drums and the three members shared lead vocal duties. Examples of songs from this era are &quot;Ya Little Creep&quot; and &quot;Bad,&quot; two Kerr-era NoMeansNo songs with songwriting credited to the Hanson Brothers; the former appears on the 1991 compilation &quot;Clam Chowder and Ice Vs. Big Macs and Bombers,&quot; and the latter on &quot;The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy&quot;, a collaborative LP with Jello Biafra.

The Wrights began working with guitarist Tom Holliston as the Hanson Brothers in 1989. The earliest sessions from this time still featured John Wright on drums; however, Ken Jensen of D.O.A. soon joined as the drummer and John Wright devoted himself to the lead vocals. After releasing a debut 7-inch, the band recorded their first album, &quot;Gross Misconduct,&quot; in 1992. The album featured art spoofing the cover of the Ramones&#x27; &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;.

Jensen died in a house fire in 1995. Ken Kempster (member of, among many other groups, the Showbusiness Giants) became the group&#x27;s next drummer, referred to as &quot;Kenny Jr&quot; Hanson. This lineup released the group&#x27;s second record, &quot;Sudden Death,&quot; through a subsidiary of Virgin Records. The cover spoofed D.O.A.&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner&quot; single cover.

In 2000, the songs &quot;Rink Rat&quot;, &quot;Third Man In&quot;, &quot;Stick Boy&quot;, and &quot;Danielle&quot;, were featured in the &quot;NHL Rock The Rink&quot; game for the Sony PlayStation. Also in 2000, John Wright, in his Johnny Hanson character, recorded an instructional video regarding homebrewing beer. Wright also compiled and released two compilations of hockey-themed songs called &quot;Puck Rock Volumes I and II.&quot;

Kempster left the group in 2001, and Ernie Hawkins joined for touring behind the group&#x27;s third record, &quot;My Game&quot;. The cover parodied Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;My War&quot;. In April 2006, the band went on a tour of Canada. Hawkins appears on the group&#x27;s 2008 live album &quot;It&#x27;s a Living&quot;, whose cover parodies the Ramones&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Alive&quot;. Mike Branum, from The Freak Accident, debuted as the group&#x27;s drummer for their 2008 tour. Byron Slack replaced Branum in 2014.

Nomeansno broke up in 2016, also putting an end to the Hanson Brothers.

<doc id="646523" wikidata="Q2699963" url="?curid=646523" title="The Bernie Mac Show">
<text>The Bernie Mac Show (often shortened to Bernie Mac in syndication) is an American sitcom television series created by Larry Wilmore, that aired on Fox for five seasons from November 14, 2001 to April 14, 2006. The series featured Bernie Mac and his wife Wanda raising his sister&#x27;s three kids: Jordan, Vanessa, and Bryana.

==Premise==
The series was loosely based on Mac&#x27;s stand-up comedy acts. In real life, Bernie &quot;Mac&quot; McCullough was married with one daughter; Mac&#x27;s character on the show (a stand-up comedian) was married with no children of his own. The pilot episode, aired on November 14, 2001, set up the basic premise for the series: the character Bernie Mac takes in his sister&#x27;s children after she enters rehab (a fictional premise taken from one of Mac&#x27;s stand-up routines which was eventually featured in the 2000 film, &quot;The Original Kings of Comedy&quot;). &quot;In reality, the story is a blend of two real incidents: Mac briefly took in his niece Toya who was an at risk youth and her daughter Monique; while a friend of his had to raise her sister&#x27;s children long-term.&quot;

Much of the humor in the show was derived from Mac&#x27;s continual adjustment to and his unique take on parenthood. A frequent motif of the show was the juxtaposition of Mac&#x27;s acerbic comments, such as his threats to &quot;bust the (children&#x27;s) heads &#x27;til the white meat shows,&quot; and the parental affection he felt toward the trio, which often brought him to the verge of tears. Toward the end of the series, Bryana&#x27;s long-lost father (Anthony Anderson) returns and drops by occasionally to help Bernie and Wanda with the kids.

Many of his most emotional scenes occurred in segments in which Mac, while still in character, broke the &#x27;fourth wall&#x27; and talked to the television audience, which he referred to as &quot;America&quot;. This technique was notably used before an episode during the 2005–2006 season, when Bernie, as himself and wearing a Chicago White Sox cap and jacket, delivered a heartfelt congratulatory message to the baseball organization and its staff on their recent World Series Championship. Mac, who grew up on Chicago&#x27;s south-side, was a die-hard fan of the White Sox and was seen at Game 1 of the World Series, in a front row seat.

The show also features yellow captions pointing things out that aren&#x27;t explicitly mentioned.

Mac&#x27;s character&#x27;s celebrity worked as a plot device allowing other celebrities to appear on the show as themselves, including Halle Berry, Serena Williams, Chris Rock, Ashton Kutcher, Billy Crystal, Carl Reiner, Don Rickles, Angela Bassett, Ellen DeGeneres, Ice Cube, Isaac Hayes, Flavor Flav, Lucy Lawless, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H, Matt Damon, Charles Barkley, Jon Garland, Jules Sylvester, Sugar Ray Leonard, India Arie, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Sugar Shane Mosley, Hugh Hefner, Phil McGraw, and Marcus Allen.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Main===
* Bernard &quot;Bernie&quot; McCullough (Bernie Mac) – The show&#x27;s main character who is loosely based on Mac. Bernie and his wife take in the three kids when their drug-addicted mother (Bernie&#x27;s sister Stacy) is no longer able to be a proper parent. Bernie uses tough-love parenting tactics and he can be both strict and comical. He narrates the series, and between scenes, he talks to the audience by addressing them as &quot;America&quot;. Although he loves all three kids, his favorite is Bryana (whom he affectionately calls &quot;Babygirl&quot; because she is the youngest), and finds himself in conflict with teenage Vanessa, the eldest sibling, who has a poor attitude.
* Wanda McCullough (née Thomas) (Kellita Smith) – Bernie&#x27;s loving wife, an intelligent woman who is vice president for AT&amp;T, and later in the series, vice president at the fictional West Coast Wireless. She enjoys raising the kids with Bernie, but periodically her patience is tested. Whenever Bernie has a problem, she does her best to help, though her assistance can be overbearing and unnecessary at times.
* Jordan Thomkins (Jeremy Suarez) – Bernie and Wanda&#x27;s nephew and the middle child. Jordan is very mischievous and peculiar. He is interested in collecting bugs and conducting odd science experiments. Early in the series, he gets beat up by his little sister, Bryana, and he would frequently cry, occasionally vomit, and sometimes urinate on himself. As the series progresses, he becomes emotionally tougher and gains confidence.
* Bryana &quot;Baby Girl&quot; Thomkins (Dee Dee Davis) – Bernie and Wanda&#x27;s younger niece, the youngest child, and the half-sister of Jordan and Vanessa. Bryana is a friendly child who is sweet, innocent, and naive, though she is often more bratty and obnoxious as the series progresses. Bryana is her uncle&#x27;s favorite, and has a trusting relationship with her Uncle Bernie. Bernie fears that one day she will grow up and end up like Vanessa.
* Vanessa &quot;Nessa&quot; Thomkins (Camille Winbush) – Bernie and Wanda&#x27;s elder niece, and the eldest of the three children. Vanessa purposely gives Bernie trouble with her attitude, most of which comes from the pressure of being the eldest and having to take a parental role with her younger siblings. As the series progresses, she gets along better with Bernie.

===Recurring===
* W.B. (Reginald Ballard) – Bernie&#x27;s close friend who&#x27;s always on his side
* Bonita (Niecy Nash) – Bernie&#x27;s younger sister (seasons 2–4)
* Chuy (Carlos Mencia (season 1) and Lombardo Boyar) – Bernie&#x27;s friend
* Kelly (Michael Ralph) – Bernie&#x27;s friend
* Jerry Best (Rick Hoffman) – Bernie&#x27;s manager
* Father Sean Cronin (Wade Williams) – The Dean of Discipline at Damien Elementary, Jordan and Bryana&#x27;s school
* Bryan (Anthony Anderson) – Bryana&#x27;s father (season 5)
* Donna (Naya Rivera) – Vanessa&#x27;s friend
* Teri (Ashley Monique Clark) – Vanessa&#x27;s friend (guest, season 3; recurring, seasons 4–5)

===Unseen characters===
* Stacey Thomkins – One of two of Bernie&#x27;s sisters and Vanessa, Jordan, and Bryana&#x27;s mother. Before the events of the show, she became addicted to drugs; Bernie had to place her in an institution to recover and took in her children until the time came she could care for them herself. Though institutionalized, Stacey&#x27;s addiction was such that she was not known to make any serious attempts to recover and her children remain with Bernie for the run of the series. A picture of her younger self is seen once in &quot;Road to Traditions&quot;.
* Mr. Thomkins – Vanessa and Jordan&#x27;s biological father, who left them when she was five years of age and he was a baby. According to Bernie and Vanessa, he&#x27;s in prison for various law violations that include gun violence. A picture of him (played by an unknown man) is shown in the episode &quot;Saving Sergeant Thomkins&quot;.
* Big Mama – Bernie&#x27;s grandmother. She died sometime before Bernie became famous. She is frequently mentioned by Bernie over the course of the series. In the family reunion episode, Bebe Drake played the matriarchal role.
* Uncle Ellister – Bernie&#x27;s uncle who is, in actuality, his biological father.

==Production==

===Main crew===
* Creator and executive producer: Larry Wilmore
* Executive producers: Pete Aronson, Warren Hutcherson.
* Co-executive producers: Bernie Mac, Richard Appel, Teri Schaffer, Michael Benson, Marc Abrams.

===Cancellation===
After five seasons and 104 episodes, Fox announced the cancellation of &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;.

The series finale titled &quot;Bernie&#x27;s Angels&quot; focused on Bernie getting an electrical shock and ends up traumatized. After he recovers, he begins to teach Jordan and Bryanna how to do certain things on their own. Also, Vanessa doesn&#x27;t want Bernie to be involved in her choosing a college. Meanwhile, Jordan takes advantage of Bernie&#x27;s kindness. In the end, Vanessa and Bernie make up (mainly due to her writing an essay about who inspires her most: which is him). In the final scene of the series, Bernie goes back to his normal self and takes back the iPod he bought Jordan since he was taking advantage of him. Bernie&#x27;s final line is a farewell message to the viewers and stating that he is going to continue to raise and teach the kids for as long as they need it and he also wishes the viewers luck. The scene pans out with Jordan on his knees sobbing and begging for the iPod while Bernie smugly laughs and teases him.

==Broadcast history==
The series debuted in its time slot on November 14, 2001, with solid ratings in spite of a weak lead-in, &quot;Grounded for Life&quot;. The show had a very successful first season and in the process won a handful of honors including an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series&quot; and the prestigious Peabody Award. Bernie Mac also received Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor in a Comedy Series.

In fall 2002, the series aired against the Damon Wayans comedy &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; which may have hurt the show&#x27;s momentum in the ratings during the first half of its second season run. Larry Wilmore, the show&#x27;s creator and executive producer, was fired at this time. In interviews, Wilmore said he was fed up with the network&#x27;s creative interference with the show, in addition to Fox constantly shuffling it around the schedule. Fox contended that it wasn&#x27;t happy with the show&#x27;s direction under Wilmore in the second season, claiming the show &quot;wasn&#x27;t delivering enough laughs&quot;. With &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot;&#x27;s inability to topple &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot; in the Wednesday 8 p.m. timeslot, Fox eventually aired the show after &quot;American Idol&quot;, after which it received its highest ratings ever.

The third season was scheduled to start on October 29, 2003, but was postponed due to &quot;The O.C.&quot; being moved. Instead, the series started the season at the late date of November 30, 2003. The ratings were mediocre, despite the large ratings of its lead-in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In March 2004, the show was moved to Monday nights in a plan to boost ratings for the new show &quot;Cracking Up&quot;, but the ratings were low for both shows. &quot;Cracking Up&quot; was canceled and &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; was pulled from May Sweeps with leftover episodes that aired in June (one of which included an episode about Thanksgiving).

&quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; returned to its original time slot on September 8, 2004, to start the fourth season. The production was shut down a month later due to Bernie&#x27;s sickness. The show returned on January 14, 2005, with new episodes on Friday nights. Although the ratings were low enough that commentators questioned the show&#x27;s future (especially when it was postponed from May Sweeps again), the show was renewed for a fifth season.

The fifth season started September 23, 2005, on Friday nights and beginning mid-season, airings were followed by reruns of the show.

&quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; celebrated its 100th episode on February 3, 2006, even though the actual 100th episode was not aired until March 31.

===Syndication and international broadcast===
The series had been airing in syndication since September 2005 and aired on Independent Fox UPN and The WB affiliates (the letter networks The WB 100+ Station Group (now The CW Plus) also carries the program as part of its national schedule) and was on the FX network from September 2008 until 2011. In syndication, the series&#x27; title is shortened simply to &quot;Bernie Mac&quot;. Bernie Mac&#x27;s hometown of Chicago aired the series on the city&#x27;s independent station The U. &quot;The Bernie Mac Show&quot; began its run on the station in September 2005. In the beginning of fall 2009, the series briefly moved to The U&#x27;s sister station Me-TV, before returning to The U where it remained until late 2010. It also formerly aired reruns on BET, BET Her, Laff, MTV2 and TV One and currently airs on Bounce TV and Aspire TV.

On the day of Mac&#x27;s funeral, The U aired a retrospective TV special called &quot;A Tribute to Bernie Mac&quot;, which featured clips from the series and an interview with Camille Winbush, who portrayed Vanessa.

Reruns of the show were also aired on Much in Canada. The show aired in Jamaica on CVM Television.

<text>Classified advertising is a form of advertising, particularly common in newspapers, online and other periodicals, which may be sold or distributed free of charge. Classified advertisements are much cheaper than larger display advertisements used by businesses, although display advertising is more widespread. They were also commonly called &quot;want&quot; ads, starting in 1763, and are sometimes called small ads in Britain.

== Newspaper classifieds ==

Advertisements in a newspaper are typically short, as they are charged for by the line or word, and are one newspaper column wide.

Publications printing news or other information often have sections of classified advertisements; there are also publications that contain only advertisements. The advertisements are grouped into categories or &quot;classes&quot; such as &quot;for sale—telephones&quot;, &quot;wanted—kitchen appliances&quot;, and &quot;services—plumbing&quot;, hence the term &quot;classified&quot;. Classified advertisements generally fall into two types: individuals advertising sales of their personal goods, and advertisements by local businesses. Some businesses use classified ads to hire new employees.

One issue with newspaper classified advertising is that it does not allow images, even though display advertisements, which do allow images, can be found in the classified section.

== Developments ==
In recent years the term &quot;classified advertising&quot; or &quot;classified ads&quot; has expanded from merely the sense of print advertisements in periodicals to include similar types of advertising on computer services, radio, and even television, particularly cable television but occasionally broadcast television as well, with the latter occurring typically very early in the morning hours.

Like most forms of printed media, the classified advertisement has found its way to the Internet, as newspapers have taken their classified advertisements online and new groups have discovered the benefits of classified advertising.

Internet classified advertisements do not typically use per-line pricing models, so they tend to be longer. They are also searchable, unlike printed material, and may foster a greater sense of urgency as a result of their daily structure and wider scope for audiences. Because of their self-regulatory nature and low cost structures, some companies offer free classifieds internationally. Other companies focus mainly on their local hometown region, while others blanket urban areas by using postal codes. Craigslist.org was one of the first online classified advertisement sites, and has grown to become the largest classified source, bringing in over 14 million unique visitors a month according to Comscore Media Metrix. The sex advertisement section of the site was probed by authorities until it was shut down indefinitely. A growing number of sites and companies have begun to provide specialized classified marketplaces online, catering to niche market products and services, such as boats, pianos, pets, and adult services, among others. Facebook marketplace provides classified-style services but prohibits the sale of firearms. 

A number of online services called aggregators crawl and aggregate classifieds from sources such as blogs and RSS feeds, as opposed to relying on manually submitted listings.

Additionally, other companies provide online advertising services and tools to assist members in designing online advertisements using professional advertisement templates and then automatically distributing the finished advertisements to the various online directories as part of their service. In this sense these companies act as both an application service provider and a content delivery platform. 

== Statistics ==
In 2022, the digital classifieds market generated around $21 billion in worldwide revenue, according to a report by Statista. 

Newspapers&#x27; revenue from classifieds advertisements is decreasing continually as Internet classifieds grow. Classified advertising at some of the larger newspaper chains dropped by 14% to 20% in 2007, while traffic to classified sites grew by 23%.

As the online classified advertising sector develops, there is an increasing emphasis toward specialization. Vertical markets for classifieds are developing quickly along with the general marketplace for classifieds websites. Like search engines, classified websites are often specialized, with sites providing advertising platforms for niche markets of buyers or sellers.

<text>Shlomo Kalo (; February 25, 1928 – August 30, 2014) was a writer and microbiologist. He published approximately 80 fiction and nonfiction books in Hebrew, some of which are published in translation internationally.

== Biography ==
Shlomo Kalo was born on 25 February 1928, in Sofia, Bulgaria. At the age of 12, Kalo joined the anti-Fascist underground in Bulgaria. Aged 15, when Bulgaria was under Nazi occupation, Kalo was imprisoned in an improvised concentration camp in Somovit.&quot;,
Aged 18, in 1946, he won a prize in a poetry competition and went to Prague, where he studied medicine at the Charles University, worked as a freelance journalist and wrote short stories.

When the state of Israel was founded in 1948, Shlomo Kalo joined the Mahal (&quot;Volunteers from abroad&quot;: individuals outside Israel who volunteered to fight together with the Israeli forces in its war of independence) and was trained as a pilot in Olomouc, Czechoslovakia. In 1949, at the age of 21 he immigrated to Israel. In 1958 he got his M.Sc. in microbiology at the Tel Aviv University. For 26 years till his retirement (in 1988) he worked as director of the medical laboratories of Kupat Holim Klalit health services, in Rishon-leZion. His first book in Hebrew, a collection of short stories, was published in 1954 by &quot;Sifriyat ha-Poalim&quot;.

In 1969, a sharp turn in his life occurred (described in the last pages of his autobiographic novel &quot;Erral&quot;). It affected his life, thoughts and literary activity ever since. Kalo wrote about it:
&quot;First Sunday of the year 1969 AD, twelve noon.
Body tensed like a bow-string. Not he.
Warmth rising from the region of the heart. Not he.
He stopped being what he was. He will no longer be as
he was, forever and ever, for all eternity.
He was, he is, he will be, forever and ever, for all
eternity.&quot; 
In 1979 an informal group known as &quot;DAAT&quot; (Hebrew acronym, meaning knowledge, standing for &quot;know yourself always&quot;) formed around Shlomo Kalo. This group had a varying number of members or supporters till it disbanded in 2009. Some well-known and influential journalists and artists (Shlomo Bar-Abba, Odetta Schwartz and Rivka Zohar, for example) were associated at times with the group.

In 2009, the Israeli newspaper Ha&#x27;aretz reported that rumours were persistent that Shlomo Kalo was among few Israeli writers who had been shortlisted as candidates for the Nobel Prize for Literature, similar reports were made by other news sites in 2010 and in 2011.

Shlomo Kalo was married to Rivka Zohar-Kalo, a prominent Israeli singer, who performs and records, among others, songs he has written (music and lyrics).
Shlomo Kalo died at his home on August 30, Shabbat morning. His wife said on a Channel 2 TV interview that his summarizing last words were: &quot;Everything is excellent to the one who is not subjugated&quot;.

== Literary activity ==
In the 1960s two other works of his were published by &quot;Am Oved&quot; and won great appreciation. In 1969 he established a publishing house named &quot;DAAT Publications&quot;, from which he retired after a few years, though he continued to publish most of his following titles there. During the 1970s he translated into Hebrew classical writings of Far-Eastern schools such as: Patanjeli&#x27;s Yoga verses, The Bhagavadgita, Budha&#x27;s Dhamapada, Tao-Te-Ching and others. During these years and later in the 1980s Kalo published several nonfiction titles dealing with philosophical, moral and spiritual topics (two out of his seven volumes of lectures were published in this decade). Some other titles were literary fiction about a philosophical issue (&quot;The Self as Fighter&quot;, &quot;The Gospel of the Absolute Free Will&quot; and the novel &quot;Like the Scarlet Thread&quot;). A lot of his music and songs were written in this period.

During the following two decades Kalo continued to write prolifically in a variety of genres and styles. In the 1990s his first titles written in a newly introduced genre (the so-called &quot;documented&quot; stories) were published: &quot;Forevermore&quot; and &quot;Moments of Truth&quot;, as well as his best-selling historical novel title &quot;The Chosen&quot;, printed in first edition. During these two decades translation rights of some of his books were sold over in 17 countries.

Short stories written by Shlomo Kalo were published in literary magazines in Israel, among them literary supplements of large newspapers. Some of his stories were included in various anthologies celebrating Israel&#x27;s Jubilee year and other occasions.
Prof. Gershon Shaked (Hebrew University) maintains in his Modern Fiction study (Indiana University, 2000; p 102-3) that Kalo&#x27;s book &quot;The Heap&quot; marked &#x27;two turning points in Hebrew Literary History; the beginning of modernist fiction in Israel, and the advent of Sephardi and Ashkenazi authors who wrote about the immigrant Sephardic community&#x27;. &quot;The Heap,&quot; prof. Shaked continues, &quot;has a special place in the history of Hebrew fiction because it is a neo-modernist social protest of an immigrant author&quot;. The novel is built around a number of immigrants who, reflecting their existential crisis, &#x27;embody the archetype of human failure&#x27;.

Some 40 out of Kalo&#x27;s 80 titles were published during the years 2000–2011.

== Other activities ==
1988 was the year when the extensive media exposure of Shlomo Kalo&#x27;s contemplative and spiritual lifework began. Since that time, messages and solutions to a variety of issues have been both aired by national TV and radio channels, and widely covered by the press.

During the Kosovo Crisis in 1999 Shlomo Kalo was the most prominent Israeli intellectual who publicly protested against US and NATO military attacks on Yugoslavia.

<text>Roy Lee Walford, M. D. (June 29, 1924 – April 27, 2004) was a professor of pathology at University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, a leading advocate of calorie restriction for life extension and health improvement, and a crew member of Biosphere 2.

==Career highlights==
Walford is credited with significantly furthering aging research by his discovery that laboratory mice, when fed a diet that restricted their caloric intake by 50% yet maintaining nutritional requirements, almost doubled their expected life span.

He received his medical degree from the University of Chicago in 1948. He completed his internship at Gorgas Hospital, Panama, and served his residency at the V.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. He then served two years in the US Air Force during the Korean War.

Walford joined the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1954. He became a Professor of Pathology at the UCLA School of Medicine in 1966. He became Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emeritus, for UCLA, when he left to join the crew of Biosphere 2 in 1991.

While at UCLA, Walford served in the following roles:
* Director of the Blood Bank and of the Hematology Division of the Clinical Laboratories (1959–1980)
* Director of the School of Medical Technology (1962–1972)
* Chairman of the Vivarium Committee (1965–1968)

In addition to his service at UCLA, he was an expert advisor in immunology for the World Health Organization from 1969 to 1984, was a senatorial delegate to the White House Conference on Aging in 1981, and a member of the National Institute on Aging.

His honors and awards include:
* Levine Award of the American Society of Clinical Pathology
* Research Award of the American Aging Association
* Kleemeier Award from the Gerontological Society of America
* Henderson Award from the American Geriatrics Society
* 1998 Longevity Prize of the Foundation IPSEN
* The Senator Alan Cranston Award
* Infinity Award of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine
* Asteroid #4629 was named after him by its discoverer (E. Helene) in 1986

Walford and his work were featured in print in dozens of articles in popular publications such as &quot;Omni&quot;, &quot;Discover&quot;, and &quot;Scientific American&quot;. During his life he also made dozens of featured appearances on various television shows.

==Roulette winnings==
In 1947, while on vacation during medical school, Walford and Albert Hibbs, a mathematics graduate student, used statistical analysis of biased roulette wheels to &quot;break the bank&quot; in Reno. They tracked the results of the spins, determined which wheels were biased, and then bet heavily on the ones which were unbalanced. The casinos eventually realized that Walford and his friend knew what they were doing and threw them out. A &quot;Life&quot; magazine photographer captured the pair drinking milk and counting their chips in a photograph published in the December 8, 1947 issue. Their methods were also mentioned in the roulette book &quot;The Eudaemonic Pie&quot; by Thomas Bass. Different sources have the pair winning anywhere from $6,500 to $42,000. The high end is more likely, as Walford was reputed to have paid for part of his medical school education and a house from his winnings. The pair also bought a yacht and sailed the Caribbean for over a year.

==Gerontix==
In 1981, Walford began a commercial collaboration with fellow researchers Richard Weindruch and Kathleen Yankee Hall, and her husband William Hall, a wealthy businessman. In her tribute after his death, Kathleen Hall wrote of Walford, &quot;we both threw in a few thousand dollars and started a small business together.&quot; Incorporated in California as Gerontix, the company was to sell supplements intended to improve health and increase life span. The first Gerontix product was butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), with lysine and zinc, which was sold in capsules and marketed as a treatment for herpes. Motivated by the success of the bestselling book Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach, by Durk Pearson and Sandy Shaw, the group intended to sell a package of products, called MaxiLife, which would capitalize on the release of Walford&#x27;s book, &quot;Maximum Life Span&quot;. It was expected that Walford, a highly publicized researcher, would experience the same success as Pearson and Shaw. Before Walford&#x27;s book was published and Gerontix started to manufacture its coordinated products, the manufacturer Twin Laboratories (Twinlab) began to sell a multi-ingredient supplement called MaxiLIFE, which the owners of Gerontix discovered in November 1982. Despite the potential for trademark conflict, the Gerontix group elected to proceed with plans to use the brand name MaxiLife. Twin Laboratories brought suit against Gerontix for trademark infringement, and the court issued a summary judgement in favor of Twin Laboratories on February 13, 1984. Before the resolution of the lawsuit, the Gerontix MaxiLife products were brought to market and sold poorly, partly because of the lackluster sales of Walford&#x27;s book. Lack of success in federal court and in health food stores led to the demise of Gerontix. Gerontix subsequently brought suit for legal malpractice against the attorneys whom Gerontix had hired to obtain the trademark right to the name MaxiLife, but on February 17, 1989 a summary judgement against Gerontix was entered by Los Angeles Superior Court judge Loren Miller, Jr. Gerontix eventually appealed the case to the California Supreme Court after losing an appeal in the California Court of Appeals.

In Appendix B of Walford&#x27;s &quot;Maximum Life Span&quot; he noted, &quot;Additional additives, such as antioxidants and some of the other materials I&#x27;ve listed in Chapters 7 and 8, can be obtained from Gerontix Biological Research Products...,&quot; but he did not disclose that he would profit from the sale of Gerontix products. The company&#x27;s MaxiLife product brochure, which refers to Walford and his research, also makes no mention of his connection to Gerontix.

==Biosphere 2==
Walford was one of the eight “crew members” who were sealed inside Biosphere 2 where they lived from September 26, 1991 to September 26, 1993. Walford served as the crew&#x27;s physician. During his stay in Biosphere 2, the crew found that they could not grow as much food as anticipated, so Walford convinced the crew to follow his calorie restriction diet. In November of the first year the crew decided to open a cache of emergency food supplies grown outside of the bubble to supplement their meager diets.

==Death==
At age 79, Roy Walford died of respiratory failure as a complication of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.

According to Walford&#x27;s friend and colleague, Kathleen Hall, his diagnosis of ALS came as a result of her urging him to see a physician when she noticed &quot;the strangeness in Roy&#x27;s gait.&quot; She says that before his death Walford &quot;continued writing, taking courses on film production. He had me all over New York and in Dallas for just the right production shots.&quot; Meanwhile, Hall remembers that &quot;Roy and I together with his daughter, Lisa, and his friends exhausted all the literature, looking for a cure, a solution. I found myself scouting the alleys of Chinatown in New York searching out a particular mushroom, looking for the best grass to help him through the pain.&quot; Even before developing ALS, Walford was no stranger to &quot;grass.&quot; In his book &quot;Eternity Soup: Inside the Quest to End Aging&quot;, Greg Critser says that Walford&#x27;s &quot;consumption of marijuana was legendary.&quot;

Walford was survived by his three children, Peter, Morgan, and Lisa Walford. Their mother was Martha Sylvia Schwalb, to whom Walford was married for 20 years before divorcing in the 1970s.

==Published works==
Walford authored several books, and set out his dietary beliefs in the bestseller &quot;Beyond the 120-Year Diet&quot;. In addition, he published at least 340 scientific papers, mainly focused on the biology of aging.

Walford authored or co-authored the following books:

<text>American Experience is a television program airing on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the United States. The program airs documentaries, many of which have won awards, about important or interesting events and people in American history.

The series premiered on October 4, 1988, and was originally titled The American Experience. It was shortened to American Experience during a rebrand and image update. The show has had a presence on the internet since 1995, and more than 100 &quot;American Experience&quot; programs are accompanied by their own internet websites, which provide background information on the subjects covered as well as teachers&#x27; guides and educational companion materials. The show is produced primarily by WGBH-TV in Boston, Massachusetts, though occasionally in the early seasons it was co-produced by other PBS stations such as WNET (Channel 13) in New York City.

Some programs considered part of the &quot;American Experience&quot; collection were produced prior to the creation of the series. &quot;&quot; was one of them, airing originally in 1983 after taking six years to assemble. Also, in 2006, &quot;American Experience&quot; rebroadcast &quot;Eyes on the Prize: America&#x27;s Civil Rights Years&quot;, the first half of the 1986 documentary series about the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s.

<text>The Briard () or (; plural: &quot;Bergers de Brie&quot;) is a French breed of large shepherd dog, traditionally used both for herding sheep and to defend them. It was first shown at the first Paris dog show, in 1863; the first Briard to be registered in the , the national stud-book, was Sans Gêne in 1885. It was in the past also known as the .

==History ==
The Briard originated in, and is named for, the Brie historic region of north-central France, where it was traditionally used both for herding sheep and to defend them. The first written mention of the shepherd dogs of Brie is thought to be in the &quot;Cours complet d&#x27;agriculture&quot; of Jean-Baptiste François Rozier, who in 1783 wrote that the &quot;chien de Brie&quot; was long-haired and usually black; that in the open plains there was little danger from wolves, and so the dogs were used more for herding than for defence; and that shepherd dogs had the task of preventing the sheep from straying into crops or vineyards where they might cause damage. Pierre Mégnin, writing in 1895, clearly distinguishes the short-haired Chien de Beauce – the modern Beauceron – from the long-haired Chien de Brie or Briard. In 1896, Mégnin was among those who founded the .

The Berger de Brie was first shown at the first Paris dog show in 1863, where a bitch named Charmant took a prize. The first Briard to be registered in the , the national stud-book, was Sans Gêne, winner of a gold medal at the Paris show in 1885. A breed standard was established in 1897, in which two varieties were described: one with a woolly or sheep-like coat, the other with a coat more similar to that of the goat; the woolly type later disappeared. In 1909, a breed society, Les Amis du Briard, was formed.

Breed numbers fell during the First World War; any dog thought suitable for military use was sent to the front. The breed society resumed its activities in 1923, and a rival breed association was formed at about the same time; in 1935, this last organised the first single-breed show for the Berger de Brie, with seventy-eight participants. Numbers again fell sharply under the Nazi occupation of France during the Second World War. After the war the two breed clubs merged under the name Club des Amis du Briard.

In 1954, the Berger de Brie was fully recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

Partly as a consequence of the mechanisation of agriculture and resulting rural depopulation of the post-War years, the Berger de Brie came to be commonly kept as a companion dog. In the 1970s and 1980s, its numbers increased substantially: annual registrations in the &quot;Livre des Origines Françaises&quot; rose from 317 in 1970 to 905 in 1975, to 4101 in 1980 and then to a peak of 6364 in 1986, after which they fell precipitously; at one point the breed club had over 6000 members, more than any other French breed association at any time. Disagreements within the association resulted in its expulsion from the Société Centrale Canine; a new breed society, the , was recognised in 1989. In 1996, ten European breed associations in nine different countries joined to form the .

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12.6 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

In 2001, blindness caused by a disease similar to Leber congenital amaurosis was partially reversed in three Briard puppies by researchers at Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania using gene therapy.

== Characteristics ==
The coat is long (no less than ), thick and harsh like that of a goat; it may be solid black, grey, blue or fawn, or fawn overlaid with black; greying is seen to a variable extent. Dogs stand at the withers, bitches about . An unusual characteristic of the breed is the double dewclaw on the hind legs; the breed standard specifies a single or absent dewclaw as a disqualifying fault.

<text>Gasterophilus, commonly known as botfly, is a genus of parasitic fly from the family Oestridae that affects different types of animals, especially horses, but it can also act on cows, sheep, and goats. A case has also been recorded in a human baby.

This parasite affects the animal gastrointestinal tract in order to give to their offspring an alimentary source.

Although not deadly, due to the usual low larva population that infests the animal, large larva populations can cause health issues to the host. For example, a typical horse can tolerate a hundred larvae without any effects.

==Species==

There are nine species of Gasterophilus:
*&quot;Gasterophilus flavipes&quot; – ranges Palaearctic and Afrotropical, primarily infects donkeys
*&quot;Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis&quot; (lip botfly) – ranges worldwide and primarily infects horses, mules, donkey and reindeer
*&quot;Gasterophilus inermis&quot; – an Old World species that infects horses, donkeys and zebra
*&quot;Gasterophilus intestinalis&quot; (horse botfly) – ranges worldwide and primarily infects horses, mules and donkeys
*&quot;Gasterophilus meridionalis&quot; – ranges Afrotropical and primarily infects zebra
*&quot;Gasterophilus nasalis&quot; (throat botfly) – especially Holarctic but ranges worldwide, primarily infects sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, zebra and sometimes cattle
*&quot;Gasterophilus nigricornis&quot; (broad-bellied horse bot) – ranges from the Middle East to China, infects duodenum of horses and donkeys
*&quot;Gasterophilus pecorum&quot; (dark-winged horse bot) – the most pathogenic species in the genus. Ranges through the Old World and infects the mouth, tongue, esophagus and stomach of horses, donkeys and zebras
*&quot;Gasterophilus ternicinctus&quot; – ranges Afrotropical and primarily infects zebra

== Taxonomy ==
=== Larva ===
In the third larval stage, the larvae have a length that can go from 1.27cm to 1.91 cm. They have a hooked mouthpart that allows them to attach into the gastrointestinal tract of the infected animal and a rounded body that is covered with spines in rows, of which quantity varies from different species.

After this stage, the larva is excreted with the animal feces in the form of a pupa.

=== Adult ===
The adults have a length that can be between 1.67 and 1.91 cm. During this phase they look similar to drone bumble bees; They have developed a pair of wings with brown patches and a body that is covered with yellow and black hairs.

Looking into the different species, G. haemorrhoidalis and G. nasalis can be identified because they have two rows of spikes on the ventral surface of the larval segments. G. intestinalis, on the other hand, has mouthparts that are not uniformly curved dorsally and the body spikes present have blunt-ended tips.

== Life cycle ==
The first stage: During the summer months, the full-grown Gasterophilus lays the eggs over the hair, face, and extremities of their future host (these eggs are laid on different portions of the body according to the various Gasterophilus species). Due to the animal grooming that starts after seven days from the egg being laid, the hatched larvae end up in the host mouth and tongue where they get attached for more than a month before being ingested.

During this process, the animal can suffer from inflammation of the oral mucosa.

The second stage: In this stage, the larvae have been ingested and are now in the gastrointestinal tract of the host where they attach themselves. Here, they mature and stay there from eight to nine months to pass the winter and are released in the spring. During this phase, the infection can manifest in the host&#x27;s digestive system resulting in gastritis or ulceration, which may result in perforations in the walls of the tract in severe cases and much more.

The third stage: The larvae are mature enough to develop their pupa, and once finished they are released with the animal feces during spring. After leaving, which occurs in about 3-10 weeks,(depending on the temperature) the adult bot fly emerges from the pupa and starts the cycle again.

== Treatment ==

The most efficient way known to avoid the infection of Gasterophilus is by deparasitizing the animals with products like trichlorphon and dichlorvos, by using hot water to scrub the areas where the eggs are laid to kill the larvae, and by cleaning the areas where the feces of the infected animal had been in order to avoid the adult formation.

<doc id="646571" wikidata="Q965415" url="?curid=646571" title="Performative utterance">
<text>In the philosophy of language and speech acts theory, performative utterances are sentences which not only describe a given reality, but also change the social reality they are describing.

In a 1955 lecture series, later published as &quot;How to Do Things with Words&quot;, J. L. Austin argued against a positivist philosophical claim that the utterances always &quot;describe&quot; or &quot;constate&quot; something and are thus always true or false. After mentioning several examples of sentences which are not so used, and not truth-evaluable (among them nonsensical sentences, interrogatives, directives and &quot;ethical&quot; propositions), he introduces &quot;performative&quot; sentences or illocutionary act as another instance.

==Austin&#x27;s definition==
In order to define performatives, Austin refers to those sentences which conform to the old prejudice in that they &quot;are&quot; used to describe or constate something, and which thus &quot;are&quot; true or false; and he calls such sentences &quot;constatives&quot;. In contrast to them, Austin defines &quot;performatives&quot; as follows:

*Performative utterances are not true or false, that is, not truth-evaluable; instead when something is wrong with them then they are &quot;unhappy&quot;, while if nothing is wrong they are &quot;happy&quot;. 
*The uttering of a performative is, or is part of, the doing of a certain kind of action (Austin later deals with them under the name illocutionary acts), the performance of which, again, would not normally be described as simply &quot;saying&quot; or &quot;describing&quot; something (cf. Austin 1962, 5).

The initial examples of &quot;performative sentences&quot; Austin gives are these:
* &quot;I do (&quot;sc.&quot; take this woman to be my lawful wedded wife)&quot; – as uttered in the course of a marriage ceremony.
* &quot;I name this ship the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;&quot;
* &quot;I give and bequeath my watch to my brother&quot; – as occurring in a will
* &quot;I bet you sixpence it will rain tomorrow&quot; (Austin 1962, 5)

As Austin later notices himself, these examples belong (more or less strikingly) to what Austin calls, &quot;explicit&quot; performatives; to utter an &quot;explicit&quot; performative sentence is to make explicit what act one is performing. However, there are also &quot;implicit&quot;, &quot;primitive&quot;, or &quot;inexplicit&quot; performatives. When, for instance, one uses the word &quot;Go!&quot; in order to command someone to leave the room then this utterance is part of the performance of a command; and the sentence, according to Austin, is neither true nor false; hence the sentence is a performative; – still, it is &quot;not&quot; an &quot;explicit&quot; performative, for it does not make explicit that the act the speaker is performing is a command.

As Austin observes, the acts purported to be performed by performative utterances may be socially contested. For instance, &quot;I divorce you&quot;, said three times by a man to his wife, may be accepted to constitute a divorce by some, but not by others.

Every performative utterance has its own procedure and risks of failure that Austin calls &#x27;infelicities&#x27;. He sees a sharp distinction between the individual text and the &#x27;total speech act situation&#x27; surrounding it. According to Austin, in order to successfully perform an illocutionary act, certain conditions have to be met (e.g. a person who pronounces a marriage must be authorized to do so). Besides the context, the performative utterance itself is unambiguous as well. The words of an illocutionary act have to be expressed in earnest; if not, Austin discards them as a parasitic use of language.

==John Searle==
Building on Austin&#x27;s thought, language philosopher John Searle tried to develop his own account of speech acts, suggesting that these acts are a form of rule-governed behaviour. On the one hand, Searle discerns rules that merely regulate language, such as referring and predicating. These rules account for the &quot;propositional content&quot; of sentences. On the other hand, he discerns rules that are constitutive in character and define behaviour (e.g. when making a promise). These rules are the conventions underlying performative utterances and they enable not only representation and expression, but also communication.

This focus on effect implies a conscious actor and Searle assumes that language stems from an intrinsic intentionality of the mind. These intentions set the prerequisites for the performance of speech acts and Searle sets out to map their necessary and sufficient conditions.

Searle argued in his 1989 article &quot;How Performatives Work&quot; that performatives are true or false just like constatives. Searle further claimed that performatives are what he calls &quot;declarations&quot;; this is a technical notion of Searle&#x27;s account: according to his conception, an utterance is a &quot;declaration&quot;, if &quot;the successful performance of the speech act is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true.&quot; Searle believes that this double direction of fit contrasts the simple word-to-world fit of .

==Performative text==
Building on the notion of performative utterances, scholars have theorized on the relation of a spoken or written text to its broader context, that is to say everything outside the text itself. The question whether a performative is separable from the situation it emerged in is relevant when one addresses for example the status of individual intentions or speech as a resource of power. There are two main theoretical strands in research today. One emphasizes the predetermined conventions surrounding a performative utterance and the clear distinction between text and context. Another emphasizes the active construction of reality through spoken and written texts and is related to theories of human agency and discourse. The ideas about performance and text have contributed to the performative turn in the social sciences and humanities, proving their methodological use for example in the interpretation of historical texts.

Early theories acknowledge that performance and text are both embedded in a system of rules and that the effects they can produce depend on convention and recurrence. In this sense, text is an instance of &#x27;restored behaviour&#x27;, a term introduced by Richard Schechner that sees performance as a repeatable ritual. The focus here is largely on individual sentences in the active first person voice, rather than on politics or discourse. The syntactical analyses are firmly anchored in analytical epistemology, as the distinction between the research object and its context is not conceived as problematic.

===Postmodernist theories===
The second set of theories on performance and text diverged from the tradition represented by Austin and Searle. Bearing the stamp of postmodernism, it states that neither the meaning, nor the context of a text can be defined in its entirety. Instead of emphasizing linguistic rules, scholars within this strand stress that the performative utterance is intertwined with structures of power. Because a text inevitably changes a situation or discourse, the distinction between text and context is blurred.

Austin and Searle thought in terms of demarcated contexts and transparent intentions, two issues that in the 1970s led Searle into polemics with postmodern thinker Jacques Derrida.

The postmodern philosopher Jacques Derrida holds with Austin and Searle that by illocutionary force, language itself can transform and effect. However, he criticizes the notion of &#x27;felicity conditions&#x27; and the idea that the success of a performative utterance is determined by conventions. Derrida values the distinctiveness of every individual speech act, because it has a specific effect in the particular situation in which it is performed. It is because of this effect or &#x27;breaking force&#x27; that Derrida calls the possibility of repeating a text &#x27;iterability&#x27;, a word derived from Latin &quot;iterare&quot;, to repeat.

According to Derrida, the effects caused by a performative text are in a sense also part of it. In this way, the distinction between a text and that what is outside it dissolves. For this reason it is pointless to try to define the context of a speech act.

Besides the consequential effects, the dissolution of the text-context divide is also caused by iterability. Due to the possibility of repetition, the intentions of an individual actor can never be fully present in a speech act. The core of a performative utterance is therefore not constituted by animating intentions, as Austin and Searle would have it, but by the structure of language.

The philosopher Judith Butler offers a political interpretation of the concept of the performative utterance. Power in the form of active censorship defines and regulates the domain of a certain discourse. Indebted to the work of Michel Foucault, Butler expounds how subjects are produced by their context, because the possibilities of speech are predetermined.

Notwithstanding such social restraints, Butler underscores the possibility of agency. The boundaries of a discourse need continuous re-demarcation and this is where speech can escape its constriction. The emphasis on the limits of what is allowed to be said also frames that what is silenced.
Performativity has a political aspect that consists in what Derrida has described as the breaking force, by which an utterance changes its context. Butler assigns an important role to what Austin has called infelicities and parasitic uses of language. Quotations, parodies and other deviations from official discourse can become instruments of power that affect society.

In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari define language as the totality of all performative utterances, which they call order-words. They write &quot;We call order-words, not a particular category of explicit statements (for example, in the imperative), but the relation of every word or every statement to implicit presuppositions, in other words, to speech acts that are, and can only be, accomplished in the statement. Order-words do not concern commands only, but every act that is linked to statements by a &quot;social obligation.&quot; Every statement displays this link, directly or indirectly. Questions, promises, are order-words. The only possible definition of language is the set of all order-words.&quot;

===Historical methodology===
The historian Quentin Skinner developed classical and postmodern theories on performative texts into a concrete research method. Using Austin&#x27;s vocabulary, he seeks to recover what historical authors were doing in writing their texts, which corresponds with the performance of illocutionary acts. According to Skinner, philosophical ideas are intertwined with claims of power. Every text is an act of communication that positions itself in relation to the status quo it seeks to change.

Skinner agrees with Derrida that contexts in their entirety are irretrievable but nevertheless states that there is a relevant context outside the text that can be described in a plausible way. Extensive research is required to relate historical texts to their contemporary discourses. According to Skinner &#x27;there is a sense in which we need to understand why a certain proposition has been put forward if we wish to understand the proposition itself&#x27;. He values agency over structure and stresses the importance of authorial intentions. Skinner therefore proposes to study historical sources in order to retrieve the convictions the author held, reflect on their coherence and investigate possible motives for the illocutionary act. This practical method seeks to deal with the blurred distinction between text and context and offer a meaningful way of interpreting historical reality.

==The receiving side==
Kent Bach and Robert Harnish claimed that performatives are successful only if recipients infer the intention behind the literal meaning, and that therefore the success of the performative act is determined by the receiving side.

==Performativeness as non-dichotomous variable==
Eve Sedgwick argued that there are performative aspects to nearly all words, sentences, and phrases.
Additionally, according to Sedgwick, performative utterances can be &#x27;transformative&#x27; performatives, which create an instant change of personal or environmental status, or &#x27;promisory&#x27; performatives, which describe the world as it might be in the future. These categories are not exclusive, so an utterance may well have both qualities. As Sedgwick observes, performative utterances can be revoked, either by the person who uttered them (&quot;I take back my promise&quot;), or by some other party not immediately involved, like the state (for example, gay marriage vows pre-legalisation).

==Performative writing==
The above ideas have influenced performative writing; they are used as a justification for an attempt to create a new form of critical writing about performance (often about performance art). Such a writing form is claimed to be, in itself, a form of performance. It is said to more accurately reflect the fleeting and ephemeral nature of a performance, and the various tricks of memory and referentiality that happen in the mind of the viewer during and after the performance.

<text>A krai () is a type of federal subject of the Russian Federation. The country is divided into 85 federal subjects, of which nine are krais. Oblasts, another type of federal subject, are legally identical to krais and the difference between a political entity with the name &quot;krai&quot; or &quot;oblast&quot; is purely traditional; both are constituent entities equivalent in legal status in Russia with representation in the Federation Council. During the Soviet era, the autonomous oblasts could be subordinated to republics or krais, but not to oblasts. Outside of political terminology, both words have a very similar general meaning (&quot;region&quot; or &quot;area&quot; in English) and can often be used interchangeably. When a distinction is desirable, &quot;krai&quot; is sometimes translated into English as &quot;territory&quot;, (closer to &quot;edge&quot; in literal translation, what is more related with the March meaning as a &quot;borderland&quot;) while &quot;oblast&quot; can variously be translated to &quot;province&quot; or &quot;region&quot;, but both of these translations are also reasonable interpretations of &quot;krai&quot;.

==Overview==
Each krai features a state government holding authority over a defined geographic territory, with a state legislature, the Legislative Assembly, that is democratically elected. The Governor is the highest executive position of the state government in a Krai, and is elected by people. Krais can be divided into raions (districts), cities/towns of krai significance, and okrugs. Krais previously featured autonomous okrugs until the formation of Zabaykalsky Krai on March 1, 2008, when the last remaining autonomous okrug of a krai was abolished.

The term &quot;krai&quot; or &quot;kray&quot; is derived from the Russian word for an edge, and can be translated into English as &#x27;frontier&#x27; or &#x27;territory&#x27;. The largest krai by geographic size is Krasnoyarsk Krai at and the smallest is Stavropol Krai at . The most populous krai is Krasnodar Krai at 5,404,300 (2010 Census) and the least populous is Kamchatka Krai at 322,079 (2010).

Historically, krais were massive first-level administrative divisions in the Russian Empire, divided into large (governorates). Following the numerous administration reforms during the Soviet era, the guberniyas were abolished and krais were reshaped into smaller, more numerous divisions. Eventually, krais and oblasts became almost totally equal as the top-level administrative division of the Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs), the constituent political entities of the Soviet Union, with the only difference being autonomous oblasts could be subordinated to krais but not to oblasts. The krais were unique to the Russian SFSR, and held very little autonomy or power, but when the Soviet Union dissolved into sovereign states along the lines of the SSRs, they became first-level administrative divisions of the Russian Federation and received much greater devolved power.

<text>Gasterophilus haemorrhoidalis (also called nose botfly or lip botfly) is a species of the genus &quot;Gasterophilus&quot; that lays eggs on the lips and around the mouth of horses, mules and donkeys. Their hatching is simulated by moisture from licking or feeding of hosts.

First instar development: Penetrate epidermis of the lips of hosts and migrate into mouth.

Second instar: move to stomach and duodenum(first section of small intestine)

Third instar: larvae become detached after some time and then pass to the rectum and re-attach themselves.

Appearance: Postsutural scutum with ground color uniformly brown or black legs yellowish brown, with femora distinctly darkened; abdomen ground color dark brown or black, with reddish-yellow or orangish setae posteriorl. Males possess a surstylus that abruptly tapers distally, with short surstylar setae that reach at most halfway to the sagittal plane. Regarding egg description, the pedicel is long and slender, with a width/length ratio of approximately 1/6 in lateral view, comprising 2/5 of the total egg length.

Egg Description: Pedicel long and slender, with width/length ratio around 1/6 in lateral view, accounting for 2/5 of the total egg length.

In Equidae, third-stage larvae attach to the stomach, but also to the rectum, sometimes in great numbers. Heavy infestation can cause anal prolapse in foals and mules.

They do not parasitise humans.

<text>Autonomous okrugs (; more correctly referred to as &quot;autonomous districts&quot; or &quot;autonomous areas&quot;) are a type of federal subject of the Russian Federation and simultaneously an administrative division type of some federal subjects. As of 2024, Russia has four autonomous okrugs of its 83 federal subjects. The Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is the only okrug which is not subordinate to an oblast. The Nenets Autonomous Okrug is a part of Arkhangelsk Oblast, the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug and the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug are parts of Tyumen Oblast.

According to the Constitution of the Soviet Union, in case of a union republic voting on leaving the Soviet Union, autonomous republics, autonomous oblasts, and autonomous okrugs had the right, by means of a referendum, to independently resolve whether they will stay in the USSR or leave with the seceding union republic, as well as to raise the issue of their state-legal status.

==History==
Originally called national okrug, this type of administrative unit was created in the 1920s and widely implemented in the 1930s to provide autonomy to Indigenous peoples of the North, like the Karelian National Okrug for the Tver Karelians. The 1977 Soviet Constitution changed the term &quot;national okrugs&quot; to &quot;autonomous okrugs&quot; in order to emphasize that they were indeed autonomies and not simply another type of administrative and territorial division. While the 1977 Constitution stipulated that the autonomous okrugs were subordinated to the oblasts and krais, this clause was revised on December 15, 1990, when it was specified that autonomous okrugs were subordinated directly to the Russian SFSR, although they still could stay in the jurisdiction of a krai or an oblast to which they were subordinated before.

==List of autonomous okrugs==
===Former autonomous okrugs===
==Recent developments==
In 1990, ten autonomous okrugs existed within the RSFSR. Between 2005 and 2008, the three autonomous okrugs in which the titular nationality constituted more than 30% of the population were abolished. Since then, three more have been abolished, leaving four. On 13 May 2020, the governors of Arkhangelsk Oblast and Nenets Autonomous Okrug announced their plan to merge following the collapse of oil prices stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. The process was subsequently scrapped on July 2 following public outcry to the merger.

The ten autonomous okrugs in 1990 were:

<text>The Rat Terrier is an American dog breed with a background as a farm dog and hunting companion. They share much ancestry with the small hunting dogs known as feists. Common throughout family farms in the 1920s and 1930s, they are now recognized by the United (UKC) and American Kennel Clubs (AKC) and are considered a rare breed. Rat Terriers are an intelligent and active breed that can be kept both for pest control and as a family pet.

==Description==

===Appearance===
The Rat Terrier ranges from about and stands at the shoulder. The miniature size— and under as defined by the UKC—has become more popular as a house pet and companion dog, but the miniature is still a hunting dog. The standard says &quot;small to medium&quot; and the miniature is small enough to go in and under those places where vermin like to hide. A larger strain, often in excess of , has been developed. Called the Decker or Decker Giant, it was named after breeder Milton Decker who created a larger hunting companion and are recognized by the National Rat Terrier Association (NRTA, see &quot;Breed recognition&quot; below). UKC and AKC do not recognize the Decker strain as another breed; they are merely considered a standard variety. The NRTA recognizes a Toy variety weighing or less. The NRTA continues to classify the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier as the Type B Rat Terrier. In the 1970s, a hairless mutation appeared in a single Rat Terrier and was propagated into a strain of the Rat Terrier. After a period of development this line resulted in the American Hairless Terrier, recognized as a separate breed by several registries.

The Rat Terrier comes in a variety of coat colors. The classic coloring is black tan point with piebald spotting (known as black tricolor), but chocolate, tan (varying in shade from pale gold to dark mahogany), blue, isabella (pearl), lemon, and apricot are all fairly common. They may be tricolor or bicolor, always with some amount of white present. Sable may overlay any of these colors. Creeping tan (often &quot;Calico&quot;), is also acceptable. Ticking is usually visible in the white parts of the coat, or in the underlying skin. Brindle, currently disallowed by the main breed standards, is considered by some to be a traditional Rat Terrier pattern, and there is a growing movement to have this pattern accepted into the breed. However, merle is widely considered to be the result of recent outcrosses and, because of associated health problems, is rejected by most Rat Terrier breeders. 

Ear carriage is erect, but can also be tipped, or button, all of which contribute to an intelligent, alert expression. The tail has been traditionally docked to about , but the bobtail gene is very common in Rat Terriers and can result in a variety of tail lengths. Today, some breeders prefer a natural, undocked tail, which is accepted in the breed standards.

Rat Terriers tend to be both intelligent and stubborn, knowing how to get what they want when they want it. They are also considered good family pets because of their energy and compatibility with kids. They are playful and require much exercise.

===Temperament===
The social sensitivity of Rat Terriers makes them very trainable and easier to live with for the average pet owner, but it also means that extensive socialization from an early age is critical. Proper socialization of a Rat Terrier puppy includes exposing the animal to a wide variety of people and places, particularly during the first three months of life. Like most active and intelligent breeds, Rat Terriers tend to be happier when they receive a great deal of mental stimulation and exercise. Rat terriers are usually loyal to their owners and are very respectful if they receive the proper amount of training at a young age.

==Health==
Due to regular outcrossings throughout the Rat Terrier&#x27;s history, overall it is a very hardy breed. However, with its growth in popularity in recent years some issues are becoming more common. The Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) recommends that Rat Terriers be tested for patellar luxation, cardiac abnormalities, pancreatic issues, hip dysplasia, and Legg–Calvé–Perthes syndrome. The average lifespan of a well-bred Rat Terrier is 16–19 years.

==History==
The earliest-known record of a rat-catching dog is that of &quot;Hatch&quot;, whose remains were recovered from the &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, the flagship of Henry VIII, sunk in 1545 and re-raised in 1982. Hatch is thought to have been a mongrel, and was brought on board to control the rat population.
The breed name comes from the occupation of its earliest ancestors brought to the US by working-class British migrants as the dogs were used in rat-baiting. However, they were, for the most part, bred for speed. Their speed is used for controlling vermin and hunting small game such as squirrels and hares. After the 1890s, as the breed type became popular in the United States, they were bred with beagles, Italian Greyhounds, and Manchester Terriers. Many of the foundation Rat Terriers were indistinguishable from small mixed-breed hunting dogs known as &quot;feists&quot;. The smaller varieties diverged from the Rat Terrier line very early on, with UKC registration for the Toy Fox Terrier beginning in 1936.

Rat Terriers were cherished as loyal hunting companions and efficient killers of vermin on 20th-century American farms: as a result, they were one of the most popular dog types from the 1920s to the 1940s. However, the widespread use of chemical pesticides and the growth of commercial farming led to a sharp decline in the breed from the 1950s onward. Breed loyalists maintained the bloodline, leading to the modern Rat Terrier.

The genetic diversity of the Rat Terrier has contributed to the overall health, keen intelligence, and soundness of the breed. Most modern breeds were developed from a few founding dogs and then propagated from a closed gene pool. In contrast, the Rat Terrier has benefited from a long history of refinement with regular outcrosses to bring in useful qualities and genetic variability.

In the current times, the Rat Terrier is becoming popular not only as a family pet but as a working dog in several fields.

Their affectionate and calm temperament along with small size has made them popular as service dogs in hospice, treatment for depression, in Assisted Living, and other human-care jobs.

Police departments have started using them as contraband search dogs as their intelligence level shortens training to as little as three weeks which is much shorter than for traditional police service breeds. Also, their small size allows search of cars, homes, and prison cells without causing the major damage a large German Shepherd or other traditional police service breed would do during a car search and lessening the chances of major financial settlements if there is nothing found during a search.

One source claims that during a competition in England, a single terrier killed 2,501 rats over a seven-hour period in a rat-infested barn - an average of one rat every ten seconds.

==Breed recognition==
Rat Terrier organizations exhibit the typical disputes over the course of action to be taken for the promotion and preservation of the breed. As usual among working breeds, points of departure are which dog type best represents the breed and whether the dog&#x27;s working qualities will be sacrificed to selection for conformation show competition.
The Rat Terrier Club of America is the official breed parent club for the American Kennel Club (AKC). Rat Terriers were accepted into the AKC&#x27;s terrier group June 2012. Rat terriers have been competing in the United Kennel Club events for over 15 years. UKC is a family-friendly group that promotes many different venues for dogs to compete. The National Rat Terrier Association is the largest independent registry and has maintained lineage records for decades. Feeling the working terrier nature of the breed will suffer, it is the most prominent of those clubs and associations opposed to Kennel Club closed-registry breeding rules.

The Decker Hunting Terrier Registry was created specifically for the Decker Giant. This registry&#x27;s mission is to keep all the qualities that set the Decker aside from the standard Rat Terrier, while retaining and improving upon the hunting ability.

The UKC officially recognized the breed on January 1, 1999. The AKC recognized the Rat Terrier as a breed on July 1, 2010; however, it allowed them to compete in companion events beginning January 1, 2006 in sanctioned AKC Companion events (Obedience, Agility, Rally). The first Rat Terrier to earn a title under AKC Sanctioning was in Agility on January 14, 2006 in Van Nuys, California by Harpur&#x27;s Giddy Upp &quot;Gigi&quot; and D. Davidson Harpur. AKC accepted the Rat Terrier into the Terrier Group in June 2012. The first AKC Champion Rat Terrier was &quot;Annie&quot; GCH GRCH King Pen RnB&#x27;s Queen Ann bred, owned by Sherry &amp; Dud Lee Hendrix of Modesto, California.

<text>Literary language is the register of a language used when writing in a formal, academic, or particularly polite tone; when speaking or writing in such a tone, it can also be known as formal language. It may be the standardized variety of a language. It can sometimes differ noticeably from the various spoken lects, but the difference between literary and non-literary forms is greater in some languages than in others. If there is a strong divergence between a written form and the spoken vernacular, the language is said to exhibit diglossia.

The understanding of the term differs from one linguistic tradition to another and is dependent on the terminological conventions adopted.

==Literary English==

For much of its history, there has been a distinction in the English language between an elevated literary language (written) and a colloquial or vernacular language (spoken, but sometimes also represented in writing). After the Norman conquest of England, for instance, Latin and French displaced English as the official and literary languages, and standardized literary English did not emerge until the end of the Middle Ages. At this time and into the Renaissance, the practice of aureation (the introduction of terms from classical languages, often through poetry) was an important part of the reclamation of status for the English language, and many historically aureate terms are now part of general common usage. Modern English no longer has quite the same distinction between literary and colloquial registers.

English has been used as a literary language in countries that were formerly part of the British Empire, for instance in India up to the present day, Malaysia in the early 20th century and Nigeria, where English remains the official language.

Written in Early Modern English, the King James Bible and works by William Shakespeare from the 17th century are defined as prototype mediums of literary English and are taught in advanced English classes. Furthermore, many literary words that are used today are found in abundance in the works of Shakespeare and as well as in King James Bible, hence the literary importance of early modern English in contemporary English literature and English studies.

==Other languages==
===Arabic===
Modern Standard Arabic is the contemporary literary and standard register of Classical Arabic used in writing across all Arabic-speaking countries and any governing body with Arabic as an official language. Many western scholars distinguish two varieties: the Classical Arabic of the Qur&#x27;an and early Islamic (7th to 9th centuries) literature; and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the standard language in use today. The modern standard language is closely based on the Classical language, and most Arabs consider the two varieties to be two registers of the same language. Literary Arabic or classical Arabic is the official language of all Arab countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages .

The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of diglossia—the use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts. Educated Arabic speakers are usually able to communicate in MSA in formal situations. This diglossic situation facilitates code-switching in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. In instances in which highly educated Arabic-speakers of different nationalities engage in conversation but find their dialects mutually unintelligible (e.g. a Moroccan speaking with a Kuwaiti), they are able to code switch into MSA for the sake of communication.

===Aramaic===

The Aramaic language has been diglossic for much of its history, with many different literary standards serving as the &quot;high&quot; liturgical languages, including Syriac language, Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, Samaritan Aramaic language and Mandaic language, while the vernacular Neo-Aramaic languages serve as the vernacular language spoken by the common people like Northeastern Neo-Aramaic (Sureth, Bohtan Neo-Aramaic, Hértevin language, Koy Sanjaq Syriac language, Senaya language), Western Neo-Aramaic, Northeastern Neo-Aramaic, Central Neo-Aramaic (Mlahsô language, Turoyo language), Neo-Mandaic, Hulaulá language, Lishana Deni, Lishanid Noshan, Lishán Didán, Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic, and Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic.

===Armenian===
The Armenian language was a diglossic language for much of its history, with Classical Armenian serving as the &quot;high&quot; literary standard and liturgical language, and the Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian dialects serving as the vernacular language of the Armenian people. Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian were eventually standardized into their own literary forms.

===Bengali===

Standard Bengali has two forms:

*Chôlitôbhasha ( ), the vernacular standard based on the elite speech of Kolkata.
*Shadhubhasha ( ), the literary standard, which employs more Sanskritized vocabulary and longer prefixes and suffixes.

Grammatically, the two forms are identical; differing forms, such as verb conjugations, are easily converted from one form to another. However, the vocabulary is quite different from one form to the other and must be learned separately. Among the works of Rabindranath Tagore are examples of both shadhubhasha (especially among his earlier works) and chôlitôbhasha (especially among his later works). The national anthem of India was originally written in the shadhubhasha form of Bengali.

===Chinese===
Literary Chinese () is the form of written Chinese used from the end of the Han dynasty to the early 20th century. Literary Chinese continually diverged from Classical Chinese, as the dialects of China became more disparate and as the classical written language became less representative of the spoken language. At the same time, Literary Chinese was based largely upon the Classical Chinese, and writers frequently borrowed from the classical language into their literary writings. Literary Chinese therefore shows a great deal of similarity to Classical Chinese, even though the similarity decreased over the centuries.

Starting from early 20th century, written vernacular Chinese () became the literary standard. This is mostly aligned with a standardized form of Mandarin Chinese, which however means there exists considerable divergence between written vernacular Chinese and other Chinese variants like Cantonese, Shanghainese, Hokkien and Sichuanese. Some of these variants have their own literary form, but none of them are currently used in official formal registers, although they may be used in legal transcription, and in certain media and entertainment settings.

===Finnish===
The Finnish language has a literary variant, literary Finnish, and a spoken variant, spoken Finnish. Both are considered a form of non-dialectal standard language, and are used throughout the country. Literary Finnish is a consciously created fusion of dialects for use as a literary language, which is rarely spoken at all, being confined to writing and official speeches.

===Georgian===
The Georgian language has a literary liturgical form, the Old Georgian language, while the vernacular spoken varieties are the Georgian dialects and other related Kartvelian languages like Svan language, Mingrelian language, and Laz language.

=== German ===
German differentiates between &quot;Hochdeutsch&quot;/&quot;Standarddeutsch&quot; (Standard German) and &quot;Umgangssprache&quot; (everyday/vernacular language). Amongst the differences is the regular use of the genitive case or the simple past tense &quot;Präteritum&quot; in written language. In vernacular German, genitive phrases (&quot;des Tages&quot;) are frequently replaced with a construction of &quot;von&quot; + dative object (&quot;von dem Tag&quot;) - comparable to English &quot;the dog&#x27;s tail&quot; vs. &quot;the tail of the dog&quot; - likewise the &quot;Präteritum&quot; (&quot;ich ging&quot;) can be substituted with the perfect (&quot;ich bin gegangen&quot;) to a certain degree. Nevertheless, the use of neither the &quot;Präteritum&quot; nor especially the genitive case is totally unusual in daily language, though it is considered rare, and might be dependent on a region&#x27;s dialect and/or the grade of education of the speaker. People of higher education use the genitive more regularly in their casual speech and the use of perfect instead of &quot;Präteritum&quot; is especially common in southern Germany, where the &quot;Präteritum&quot; is considered somewhat declamatory. The German &quot;Konjunktiv I / II&quot; (&quot;er habe&quot; / &quot;er hätte&quot;) is also used more regularly in written form being replaced by the conditional (&quot;er würde geben&quot;) in spoken language, although in some southern German dialects the &quot;Konjunktiv II&quot; is used more often. Generally there is a continuum between more dialectical varieties to more standard varieties in German, while colloquial German nonetheless tends to increase analytic elements at the expense of synthetic elements.

===Greek===
From the early nineteenth century until the mid-20th century, &quot;Katharevousa&quot;, a form of Greek, was used for literary purposes. In later years, &quot;Katharevousa&quot; was used only for official and formal purposes (such as politics, letters, official documents, and newscasting) while &quot;Dimotiki&quot;, &#x27;demotic&#x27; or popular Greek, was the daily language. This created a diglossic situation until in 1976, &quot;Dimotiki&quot; was made the official language.

===Hebrew===
During the revival of the Hebrew language, spoken and literary Hebrew were revived separately, causing a dispersion between the two. The dispersion started to narrow sometime after the two movements merged, but substantial differences between the two still exist.

===Italian===
When Italy unified in 1860, Italian existed mainly as a literary language. Different languages were spoken throughout Italy, almost all of which were Romance languages which had developed in every region, due to the political fragmentation of the time. Now, it is the standard language of Italy.

===Japanese===
Until the late 1940s, the prominent literary language in Japan was the , which is based on the language spoken in Heian period (Late Old Japanese) and is different from the contemporary Japanese language in grammar and some vocabulary. It still has relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived World War II are still written in &quot;bungo&quot;, although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). Bungo grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect, and fixed form poetries like Haiku and Tanka are still mainly written in this form.

In the Meiji period, some authors started to use the colloquial form of the language in their literature. Following the government policy after the World War II, the standard form of contemporary Japanese language is used for most literature published since the 1950s. The standard language is based on the colloquial language in Tokyo area, and its literary stylistics in polite form differs little from its formal speech. Notable characteristics of literary language in contemporary Japanese would include more frequent use of Chinese origin words, less use of expressions against prescriptive grammar (such as &quot;&quot;), and use of non-polite normal form (&quot;/&quot;) stylistics that are rarely used in colloquial language.

===Javanese===
In the Javanese language, alphabet characters derived from the alphabets used to write Sanskrit, no longer in ordinary use, are used in literary words as a mark of respect.

===Kannada===

Kannada exhibits a strong diglossia, like Tamil, also characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style, and a modern colloquial form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum.

The formal style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of Kannada literature and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio.

There are also many dialects of Kannada, Which are &quot;Dharwad Kannada&quot; of North Karnataka, Arebhashe of Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu, Kundakannada of Kundapura, Havyaka Kannada are major dialects.

=== Latin ===
Classical Latin was the literary register used in writing from 75 BC to the 3rd century AD, while Vulgar Latin was the common, spoken variety used across the Roman Empire. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to Gaul, Iberia, or Dacia was not identical to the Latin of Cicero, and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar. Some literary works with low-register language from the Classical Latin period give a glimpse into the world of early Vulgar Latin. The works of Plautus and Terence, being comedies with many characters who were slaves, preserve some early basilectal Latin features, as does the recorded speech of the freedmen in the &quot;Cena Trimalchionis&quot; by Petronius Arbiter. At the Third Council of Tours in 813, priests were ordered to preach in the vernacular language—either in the &quot;rustica lingua romanica&quot; (Vulgar Latin), or in the Germanic vernaculars—since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin.

===Malay===
The Malay language exists in a classical variety, two modern standard variety and several vernacular dialects.

===Maltese===
Maltese has a variety of dialects (including the Żejtun dialect, Qormi dialect and Gozitan amongst others) that co-exist alongside Standard Maltese. Literary Maltese, unlike Standard Maltese, features a preponderance of Semitic vocabulary and grammatical patterns; however, this traditional separation between Semitic and Romance influences in Maltese literature (especially Maltese poetry and Catholic liturgy on the island) is changing.

===Manchu===
Standard Manchu was based on the language spoken by the Jianzhou Jurchens during Nurhaci&#x27;s time, while other unwritten Manchu dialects such as that of Aigun and Sanjiazi were also spoken in addition to the related Xibe language.

===Mongolian===
The Classical Mongolian language was the high register used for religious and official purposes, while the various Mongolian dialects served as the low register, like Khalkha Mongolian, Chakhar Mongolian, Khorchin Mongolian, Kharchin Mongolian, Baarin Mongolian, Ordos Mongolian and the Buryat language. The Tibetan Buddhist canon was translated into Classical Mongolian. The Oirat Mongols who spoke the Oirat Mongol language and dialects like Kalmyk language or Torgut Oirat used a separate standard written with the Clear script.

The Mongolian language, based on Khalkha Mongolian, now serves as the high register in Mongolia itself while in Inner Mongolia a standard Mongolian based on Chakhar Mongolian serves as the high register for all Mongols in China. The Buryat language, which is seen by some as part of the Mongolian language, has been turned into a standard literary form itself in Russia.

===N&#x27;Ko===
N&#x27;Ko is a literary language devised by Solomana Kante in 1949 as a writing system for the Mande languages of West Africa. It blends the principal elements of the partially mutually intelligible Manding languages. The movement promoting N&#x27;Ko literacy was instrumental in shaping the Maninka cultural identity in Guinea, and has also strengthened the Mande identity in other parts of West Africa. N&#x27;Ko publications include a translation of the Qur&#x27;an, a variety of textbooks on subjects such as physics and geography, poetic and philosophical works, descriptions of traditional medicine, a dictionary, and several local newspapers.

===Persian===
Persian or New Persian has been used continually as the literary language of major areas in Western Asia, the Caucasus, Central Asia and South Asia. The language written today remains essentially the same as that used by Ferdowsi despite variant colloquial dialects and forms. For many centuries, people belonging to the educated classes from the Bosphorus to the Bay of Bengal would be expected to know some Persian. It was once the language of culture (especially of poetry), from the Balkans to the Deccan, functioning as a lingua franca. Until the late 18th century, Persian was the dominant literary language of Georgia&#x27;s elite. Persian was the second major vehicle after Arabic in transmitting Islamic culture and has a particularly prominent place in Sufism.

===Serbian===
Slavonic-Serbian (&quot;slavenosrpski&quot;) was the literary language of Serbs in the Habsburg monarchy used from the mid-18th century to 1825. It was a linguistic blend of Church Slavonic of the Russian recension, vernacular Serbian (Štokavian dialect), and Russian. At the beginning of the 19th century, it was severely attacked by Vuk Karadžić and his followers, whose reformatory efforts formed modern literary Serbian based on the popular language, known as Serbo-Croatian.

===Tagalog===
Tagalog was the basis of the Filipino language; both share the same vocabulary and grammatical system and are mutually intelligible. However, there is a significant political and social history that underlies the reasons for differentiating between Tagalog and Filipino.

Modern Tagalog is derived from Archaic Tagalog, which was likely spoken during the Classical period, it was the language of the Mai State, Tondo Dynasty (according to the Laguna Copperplate Inscription) and southern Luzon. It was written using Baybayin, a syllabary which is a member of the Brahmic family, before the Spanish Romanised the alphabet beginning in the late 15th century. Tagalog was also the spoken language of the 1896 Philippine Revolution.

The 1987 Constitution maintains that Filipino is the country&#x27;s national language and one of two official languages, alongside English. Today, Filipino is considered the proper term for the language of the Philippines, especially by Filipino-speakers who are not of Tagalog origin, with many referring to the Filipino language as &quot;Tagalog-based&quot;. The language is taught in schools throughout the country and is the official language of education and business. Native Tagalog-speakers meanwhile comprise one of the largest linguistic and cultural groups of the Philippines, numbering an estimated 14 million.

===Slavic languages===
Notably, in Eastern European and Slavic linguistics, the term &quot;literary language&quot; has also been used as a synonym of &quot;standard language&quot;.

===Tamil===
Tamil exhibits a strong diglossia, characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style and a modern colloquial form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum.

The modern literary style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of Tamil literature and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio.

===Tibetan===
Classical Tibetan was the high register used universally by all Tibetans while the various mutually unintelligible Tibetic languages serve as the low register vernacular, like Central Tibetan language in Ü-Tsang (Tibet proper), Khams Tibetan in Kham, Amdo Tibetan in Amdo, Ladakhi language in Ladakh and Dzongkha in Bhutan. Classical Tibetan was used for official and religious purposes, such as in Tibetan Buddhist religious texts like the Tibetan Buddhist canon and taught and learned in monasteries and schools in Tibetan Buddhist regions.

Now, Standard Tibetan, based on the Lhasa dialect, serves as the high register in China. In Bhutan, the Tibetan Dzongkha language has been standardised and replaced Classical Tibetan for official purposes and education, in Ladakh, the standard official language learned are now the unrelated languages Urdu and English, and in Baltistan, the Tibetan Balti language serves as the low register while the unrelated Urdu is the official language.

===Uzbek and Uyghur===
The Turkic Chagatai language served as the high register literary standard for Central Asian Turkic peoples, while the vernacular low register languages were the Uzbek language and Eastern Turki (Modern Uyghur). The Soviet Union abolished Chagatai as the literary standard and had the Uzbek language standardized as a literary language for, and the Taranchi dialect of Ili was chosen as the literary standard for Modern Uyghur, while other dialects like the Kashgar and Turpan dialects continue to be spoken.

===Yorùbá===
Standard Yoruba is the literary form of the Yoruba language of West Africa, the standard variety learnt at school and that spoken by newsreaders on the radio. Standard Yoruba has its origin in the 1850s, when Samuel A. Crowther, native Yoruba and the first African Anglican Bishop in Nigeria, published a Yoruba grammar and started his translation of the Bible. Though for a large part based on the Ọyọ and Ibadan dialects, Standard Yoruba incorporates several features from other dialects. Additionally, it has some features peculiar to itself only, for example the simplified vowel harmony system, as well as foreign structures, such as calques from English which originated in early translations of religious works. The first novel in the Yorùbá language was &quot;Ogboju Ode ninu Igbo Irunmale&quot; (&quot;The Forest of A Thousand Demons&quot;), written in 1938 by Chief Daniel O. Fagunwa (1903–1963). Other writers in the Yorùbá language include: Senator Afolabi Olabimtan (1932–1992) and Akinwunmi Isola.

<text>The Prince Edward Islands are two small uninhabited subantarctic volcanic islands in the southern Indian Ocean that are administered by South Africa. They are named Marion Island (named after Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, 1724–1772) and Prince Edward Island (named after Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, 1767–1820).

The islands in the group have been declared Special Nature Reserves under the South African Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act, No. 57 of 2003, and activities on the islands are therefore restricted to research and conservation management. Further protection was granted when the area was declared a marine protected area in 2013. The only human inhabitants of the islands are the staff of a meteorological and biological research station run by the South African National Antarctic Programme on Marion Island.

==History==

Barent Barentszoon Lam of the Dutch East India Company reached the islands on 4 March 1663 on the ship &quot;Maerseveen&quot;. They were named &quot;Dina&quot; (Prince Edward) and &quot;Maerseveen&quot; (Marion), but the islands were erroneously recorded to be at 41° South, and neither were found again by subsequent Dutch sailors.

In January 1772, the French frigate &quot;Le Mascarin&quot;, captained by Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, visited the islands and spent five days trying to land, thinking they had found Antarctica (then not yet proven to exist). Marion named the islands &quot;Terre de l&#x27;Espérance&quot; (Marion) and &quot;Ile de la Caverne&quot; (Prince Edward). After failing to land, &quot;Le Mascarin&quot; continued eastward, discovering the Crozet Islands and landing at New Zealand, where Marion du Fresne and some of his crew were killed by local Māoris.

Julien Crozet, navigator and second in command of &quot;Le Mascarin&quot;, survived the disaster, and happened to meet James Cook at Cape Town in 1776, at the onset of Cook&#x27;s third voyage. Crozet shared the charts of his ill-fated expedition, and as Cook sailed from Cape Town, he passed the islands on 13 December, but was unable to attempt a landing due to bad weather. Cook named the islands after Prince Edward, the fourth son of King George III; and though he is also often credited with naming the larger island Marion, after Captain Marion, this name was adopted by sealers and whalers who later hunted the area, to distinguish the two islands.

The first recorded landing on the islands was in 1799 by a group of French seal hunters of the &quot;Sally&quot;. Another landing in late 1803 by a group of seal hunters led by American captain Henry Fanning of the &quot;Catharine&quot; found signs of earlier human occupation. The islands were frequented by sealers until about 1810, when the local fur seal populations had been nearly eradicated. The first scientific expedition to the islands was led by James Clark Ross, who visited in 1840 during his exploration of the Antarctic, but was unable to land. Ross sailed along the islands on 21 April 1840. He made observations on vast numbers of penguins (&quot;groups of many thousands each&quot;), and other kinds of sea-birds. He also saw fur seals, which he supposed to be of the species &quot;Arctocephalus falklandicus&quot;. The islands were finally surveyed during the &quot;Challenger&quot; Expedition, led by Captain George Nares, in 1873.

The sealing era lasted from 1799 to 1913. During that period visits by 103 vessels are recorded, seven of which ended in shipwreck. Sealing relics include iron trypots, the ruins of huts and inscriptions. The occasional modern sealing vessel visited from Cape Town, South Africa, in the 1920s.

The islands have been the location of other shipwrecks. In June 1849 the brig &quot;Richard Dart&quot;, with a troop of Royal Engineers under Lt. James Liddell, was wrecked on Prince Edward Island; only 10 of the 63 on board survived to be rescued by elephant seal hunters from Cape Town. In 1908 the Norwegian vessel &quot;Solglimt&quot; was shipwrecked on Marion Island, and survivors established a short-lived village at the north coast, before being rescued. The wreck of the &quot;Solglimt&quot; is the best-known in the islands, and is accessible to divers.

The British government never officially claimed ownership of the islands, however it did manage economic activities on the islands in the early 20th century. In 1908, the British government granted a guano lease on Marion Island. Following the Second World War, technological advancements made the islands more strategically important, and as no further economic activity was taking place, the UK was concerned other countries might claim the islands. In late 1947 and early 1948, South Africa, with Britain&#x27;s agreement, annexed the islands and installed the meteorological station on Transvaal Cove on the north-east coast of Marion Island.

On 22 September 1979, a US surveillance satellite known as Vela 6911 noted an unidentified double flash of light, known as the Vela incident, in the waters off the islands. There was and continues to be considerable controversy over whether this event was perhaps an undeclared nuclear test carried out by South Africa and Israel or some other event. The cause of the flash remains officially unknown, and some information about the event remains classified. Today, most independent researchers believe that the 1979 flash was caused by a nuclear explosion.

In 2003, the South African government declared the Prince Edward Islands a Special Nature Reserve, and in 2013 declared of ocean waters around the islands a Marine Protection Area, thus creating one of the world&#x27;s largest environmental protection areas.

=== Marion Research Station ===

The 1948 research station on Marion Island was soon enlarged and today studies regional meteorology and the biology of the islands, in particular the birds (penguins, petrels, albatrosses, gulls) and seals.

A new research base was built from 2001 to 2011 to replace older buildings on the site. The access to the station is either by boat or helicopter. A helipad and storage hangar is located behind the main base structure.

In April 2017, scientists from McGill University, in collaboration with the South African National Antarctic Programme, launched a new astrophysical experiment on Marion Island called Probing Radio Intensity at high-Z from Marion (PRIZM), searching for signatures of the hydrogen line in the early universe. In 2018, another cosmology experiment was launched by the McGill team called Array of Long Baseline Antennas for Taking Radio Observation from Sub-Antarctic (ALBATROS). The new experiment aims to create very high-resolution maps of the low-frequency radio emission from the universe, and take first steps towards detecting the cosmological Dark Ages.

In April 2024, the South African National Antarctic Programme station on Marion Island was depicted in an ad for KFC South Africa directed by Kim Geldunhuys, Beyond the Sea, which depicted two hungry South Africans determined to get home for some fried chicken.

== Geography and geology ==
The island group is about south-east of Port Elizabeth in mainland South Africa. At 46 degrees latitude, its distance to the equator is only slightly longer than to the South Pole. Marion Island (), the larger of the two, is long and wide with an area of and a coastline of some , most of which is high cliffs. The highest point on Marion Island is Mascarin Peak (formerly State President Swart Peak), reaching above sea level. The topography of Marion Island includes many hillocks and small lakes, and boggy lowland terrain with little vegetation.

Prince Edward Island () is much smaller—only , long and wide—and lies some to the north-east of Marion Island. The terrain is generally rocky, with high cliffs () on its south western side. At the van Zinderen Bakker Peak north-west of the center, it reaches a height of .

There are a few offshore rocks along the northern coast of Prince Edward Island, like Ship Rock north of northernmost point, and Ross Rocks from the shore. Boot Rock is about off the northern coast of Marion Island.

Both islands are of volcanic origin. Marion Island is one of the peaks of a large underwater shield volcano that rises some from the sea floor to the top of Mascarin Peak. The volcano is active, with eruptions having occurred between 1980 and 2004. While Prince Edward Island may have erupted within the last 10 thousand years.

=== Climate ===
Despite being located inside the south temperate zone at 46 degrees latitude, the islands have a tundra climate. They lie directly in the path of eastward-moving depressions all year round and this gives them an unusually cool and windy climate. Strong regional winds, known as the roaring forties, blow almost every day of the year, and the prevailing wind direction is north-westerly. Annual rainfall averages from up to over on Mascarin Peak. In spite of its very chilly climate it is located closer to the equator than mild northern hemisphere climates such as Paris and Seattle and only one degree farther south than fellow southern hemisphere climates such as Comodoro Rivadavia in Argentina and Alexandra in New Zealand. Many climates on lower latitudes in the Northern hemisphere have far colder winters than Prince Edward Islands due to the islands&#x27; maritime moderation, even though temperatures in summer are much cooler than those normally found in maritime climates.

The islands are among the cloudiest places in the world; about 1300 hours a year of sunshine occur on the sheltered eastern side of Marion Island, but only around 800 hours occur away from the coast on the wet western sides of Marion and Prince Edward Islands.

Summer and winter have fairly similar climates with cold winds and threat of snow or frost at any time of the year. However, the mean temperature in February (midsummer) is and in August (midwinter) it is .

== Flora and fauna ==
The islands are part of the Southern Indian Ocean Islands tundra ecoregion that includes a small number of subantarctic islands. Because of the paucity of land masses in the Southern Ocean, the islands host a wide variety of species and are critical to conservation. In the cold subantarctic climate, plants are mainly limited to grasses, mosses, and kelp, while lichens are the most visible fungi. The main indigenous animals are insects (such as the seaweed-eating weevil &quot;Palirhoeus eatoni&quot;) along with large populations of seabirds, seals and penguins.

===Birds===

The islands have been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International for their significant seabird breeding populations. At least thirty different species of birds are thought to breed on the islands, and it is estimated the islands support upwards of 5 million breeding seabirds, and 8 million seabirds total. Five species of albatross (of which all are either threatened or endangered) are known to breed on the islands, including the wandering albatross, dark-mantled, light-mantled, Indian yellow-nosed and grey-headed albatross.

The islands also host fourteen species of petrel, four species of prion, the Antarctic tern, and the brown skua, among other seabirds. Four penguin species are found: king penguins, Eastern rockhoppers, gentoos and macaroni penguins.

===Mammals===
Three species of seal breed on the islands: the southern elephant seal, the Antarctic fur seal, and the Subantarctic fur seal. The waters surrounding the islands are often frequented by several species of whale, especially orcas, which prey on penguins and seals. Large whales such as southern rights and southern humpbacks, and leopard seals are seen more sporadically, and it remains unclear how large or stable their current local populations are, though it is thought their numbers are significantly down compared to the time of first human contact with the islands.

The area saw heavy sealing and whaling operations in the nineteenth century and continued to be subject to mass illegal whaling until the 1970s, with the Soviet Union and Japan allegedly continuing whaling operations into the 1990s. Currently, the greatest ecological threat is the longline fishing of Patagonian toothfish, which endangers a number of seabirds that dive into the water after baited hooks.

=== Invasive species ===
The wildlife is particularly vulnerable to introduced species and the historical problem has been with cats and mice. House mice arrived to Marion Island with whaling and sealing ships in the 1800s and quickly multiplied, so much so that in 1949, five domestic cats were brought to the research base to deal with them. The cats multiplied quickly, and by 1977 there were approximately 3,400 cats on the island, feeding on burrowing petrels in addition to mice, and taking an estimated 455,000 petrels a year. Some species of petrels soon disappeared from Marion Island, and a cat eradication programme was established. A few cats were intentionally infected with the highly specific feline panleukopenia virus, which reduced the cat population to about 600 by 1982. The remaining cats were killed by nocturnal shooting, and in 1991 only eight cats were trapped in a 12-month period.

It is believed that no cats remain on Marion Island today, and with the cats gone, the mouse population has sharply increased to &quot;plague like&quot; levels. In 2003, ornithologists discovered that in the absence of other food sources, the mice were attacking albatross chicks and eating them alive as they sat helplessly on their nests. A similar problem has been observed on Gough Island, where a mouse eradication programme began in 2021. A programme to eradicate invasive rats on South Georgia Island was completed in 2015, and as of 2016 the island appears to be completely rat free. The geography of Marion Island presents certain obstacles not found on either Gough or South Georgia islands, particularly its large size, high elevations and variable weather. An assessment of the island was completed in May 2015, led by noted invasive species ecologist John Parkes, with the general conclusion that an eradication programme is feasible, but will require precise planning.

Both Gough Island and the Prince Edward Islands also suffer from invasive procumbent pearlwort (&quot;Sagina procumbens&quot;), which is transforming the upland ecosystem and is now considered beyond control.

== Legal status ==

Marion Island and Prince Edward Island were claimed for South Africa on 29 December 1947 and 4 January 1948 respectively, by a South African Navy force from HMSAS &quot;Transvaal&quot; under the command of John Fairbairn. On 1 October 1948 the annexation was made official when Governor-General Gideon Brand van Zyl signed the Prince Edward Islands Act, 1948. In terms of the Act, the islands fall under the jurisdiction of the Cape Town Magistrate&#x27;s Court, and South African law as applied in the Western Cape applies on them. The islands are also deemed to be situated within the electoral district containing the Port of Cape Town; this is ward 115 of the City of Cape Town.

== Amateur radio ==
, Marion Island, prefix ZS8, was the third most wanted DXCC &quot;entity&quot; by the amateur radio community. By the end of 2014, it had dropped to 27th, after simultaneous activity by three licencees in the 2013/2014 team. However, their activity was mainly on voice. On Morse telegraphy, the Islands remain the second most wanted entity after North Korea, while on data they are sixth out of 340.

<text>Bacdafucup is the debut studio album by American hip hop group Onyx, released on March 30, 1993, by JMJ Records, Rush Associated Labels and Chaos Recordings. The album was produced by Randy Allen (Executive Producer), Chyskillz, Jam Master Jay and Kool Tee.

&quot;Bacdafucup&quot; peaked at number 17 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and number 8 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA on October 25, 1993. In 1994, the album was nominated as &quot;Rap/Hip-Hop New Artist&quot; on American Music Awards of 1994 and won &quot;Best Rap Album&quot; on 1994 Soul Train Music Awards.

The album features three of the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot;, &quot;Slam&quot; and &quot;Shifftee&quot;. The first single, &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot;, became a crossover radio hit. Their breakout single, &quot;Slam&quot;, which received heavy airplay on both radio and television (MTV and BET), leading the song to reach number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and get Platinum on August 10, 1993.

In 2005, the album is broken down track-by-track by Onyx in Brian Coleman&#x27;s book &quot;Check the Technique&quot;.

== Background ==
Fredro Starr, Big DS and Suave (also known as Sonny Seeza) met Jam Master Jay in a traffic jam at The Jones Beach GreekFest Festival on July 13, 1991. Jay gave them about two months to get a demo, but Suave and Big DS didn&#x27;t make it to the studio because they were stranded in Connecticut. So Jeff Harris, the manager of Onyx, asked Fredro to come to the studio with his cousin, Kirk Jones, who would join the group and be known as a group member as &quot;Sticky Fingaz&quot; who at the time was doing a solo career under the name Trop and working in the barbershop making a thousand dollars a week cutting high school. Fredro and Sticky Fingaz made two records, &quot;Stik &#x27;N&#x27; Muve&quot; and &quot;Exercise&quot;.
&quot;...When we went to the studio we made two records. One was called &#x27;Stick and Move&#x27; and the other was called &#x27;Exercise&#x27;. And they both were crazy! When Jay heard the songs he was like, &#x27;Yo, I love the group&#x27;.&quot; Jam Master Jay liked these songs and that&#x27;s how Sticky joined the group, because Jay said, “If Sticky ain&#x27;t in the group, it ain&#x27;t no group!”. Jay signed the group to his label, JMJ Records, for a single deal, then for an EP deal followed by an album deal because they did 10 songs on a budget of 6 songs.

== Recording and production ==
In 1991, despite the reproaches from Fredro, the Onyx&#x27;s music producer, B-Wiz, sold his drum machine SP-12 and went to Baltimore to sell crack, and eventually he was killed in Baltimore. Thus, all Onyx records were lost.
&quot;...When I met Jam Master Jay, I told B-Wiz, who was doin’ his thing, sellin’ drugs, goin’ to Baltimore. I said, “Yo, don’t go down South, I just met Jam Master Jay.” He went down south, he got murdered... When he got murdered, we lost that sound. When we lost that sound, that was the end.&quot;

So the group needed a new music producer. In Brian Coleman&#x27;s book &quot;Check the Technique&quot; Fredro described how Onyx met their future producer:&quot;...We met Chyskillz on Jamaica Avenue one day. We was buying weed at the weed spot and Chy was chasing my truck down the street, yelling, &#x27;I got beats!&#x27; His stuff back then was jazzy, on some Tribe Called Quest shit, but it was hot. I knew he could put beats together right away. We brought him into our zone and made him do some grimy shit.&quot;

Chyskillz was picked as the main producer of the album, he produced 16 of 18 songs. The first song that Chyskillz ever did for ONYX was &quot;Nigga Bridges&quot;.

Jam Master Jay attended the studios during the recording of absolutely every song and was guided by the group in the process of recording the album, applying his hand as a producer to many tracks. But despite this, he basically let Onyx and Chyskillz do their thing. Sticky says of the late great JMJ: “Jay was very hands-on, one hundred percent. He was always there in the studio with us. We learned everything from him. He was our mentor”.

Jam Master Jay&#x27;s friend, Kool Tee, also known as a member of rap groups Solo Sounds and The Afros, produced two songs on the album: &quot;Atak Of Da Bal-Hedz&quot; and &quot;Da Nex Niguz&quot;.

Jeff Harris was credited as the producer of the three songs on this album: &quot;Blac Vagina Finda&quot;, &quot;Nigga Bridges&quot; and &quot;Stik &#x27;N&#x27; Muve&quot;, but in fact he was just the group&#x27;s manager since the release of their first single in 1990, and after the release of Onyx&#x27;s first album, they grew apart.

The recording of the album began in September 1991 and ended in August 1992, when Fredro Starr acting in a movie &quot;Strapped&quot;, and from the set he went to the studio to record the album. The album was recorded in 7 different studios in New York.

During the recording of the album, Fredro Starr and Sticky Fingaz were still working at the Nu Tribe Barber Shop on Jamaica Avenue in Queens, New York City until they heard their song &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot; on the radio in November 1992.

Fredro drops a very interesting fact about the group&#x27;s mind state when recording Bacdafucup: &quot;...While we were recording the album, niggas was on LSD the whole time, straight up. We was dropping papers, taking meth tabs, during that whole album. That&#x27;s just the creative side of making music. We were like Jimi Hendrix. And that&#x27;s partially what kept our energy going at that high level. We had that battery pack. LSD was our secret weapon. It kept us creative.&quot;

Sticky Fingaz credits &quot;Bacdafucup&quot; with introducing slamdancing, grimy delivery, and bald head fashion to hip-hop.

== Conception of album title ==
The title track, &quot;Bacdafucup&quot;, was one of the first songs Onyx made, at first it was just a skit, from which they made an intro and filmed a video for it. Then they made a complete song, &quot;Onyx Is Here&quot;. Once they did this song, she gave them direction, she described what they was feeling: the whole industry gotta back the fuck up&quot;. &quot;...Bacdafucup was probably like one of the first joints we made, it turned out to be like a skit at first, then we did an intro and video to it. Then we did this song but once we did that song, that kind of like gave us our direction, it kind of described what we was feeling. The whole industry gotta back the fuck up. Das EFX gotta back the fuck up, Naughty By Nature gotta back the fuck up, Cypress Hill gotta back the fuck up&quot;

Spelling of &quot;Bacdafucup&quot; as well as &quot;United States Ghetto&quot; was made up by Suave (also known as Sonny Seeza).

In 2016, FreshPaintNYC revisiting the place of filming &quot;Bacdafucup&quot;: Shinbone Alley south, NoHo, Manhattan, NYC.

== Lyrics ==
Every song on &quot;Bacdafucup&quot; explains an aspect of life for these self-proclaimed Afficial Nastee Niguz. The first single, &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot;, signifies the Jamaican tradition of a gun salute as a show of respect to the men on the mic (&quot;buc buc like ya just don&#x27;t care&quot;).

&quot;USG&quot;, standing for United States Ghetto, stresses their belief that no matter what city you go to, you&#x27;ll find all ghettos in this country are similar. Onyx talk about the difficulties you face when you live in the ghetto. &quot;...We was talking about the life of &quot;United Statez Ghetto&quot; (&quot;U.S.G.&quot;), the hardship of the ghetto. We was speaking for the ghetto. It wasn&#x27;t just about sticking people up (*robbing people) because that&#x27;s what people doing in the ghetto, this is one part of this.&quot;

On another choice selection, Onyx modifies the old childhood jingle &quot;London Bridge&quot; to &quot;Nigga bridges falling down&quot;. &quot;Bichasbootleguz&quot; bluntly describes Onyx&#x27;s attitude towards the bootleg industry. &quot;Stik &#x27;n Move&quot; is on its way to becoming the stick up kids&#x27; national anthem. &quot;Atak of Da Bal-Hedz&quot; pretty much sums up Onyx&#x27;s method-behind-the-madness - get charged and wreck shit wide open.

Onyx used to change the spelling of words. For example, they had a song called &quot;Phat (&#x27;N&#x27; All Dat)&quot;. Sticky Fingaz invented the word &quot;phat&quot;. Russell Simmons took the word and made a clothing line Phat Farm around it.

The album contains a huge amount of profanity, which in itself prevented to playing the songs on the air of various radio stations. However, the song &quot;Slam&quot; sounded literally from everywhere, and a video for it, released 5 days earlier, was broadcast on all cable channels, including BET and MTV.

== Album cover ==
Sticky Fingaz came up with the idea to use Plexiglas for the album cover and for the video for &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot;. The group members stood on Plexiglas while the photographer, Gary Spector, took the pictures. Sticky wanted people to see the group from under their shoes.

== Singles ==
Four singles were released from this album: &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot;, &quot;Slam&quot;, &quot;Shifftee&quot; and &quot;Da Nex Niguz&quot;/&quot;Da Nex DingDong&quot;

The first single, &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot; was released, November 27, 1992. The song signifies the Jamaican tradition of a gun salute as a show of respect to the men on the mic. Produced by Chylow Parker, &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot; was a success and made it to four &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including #1 on the Hot Rap Singles for two weeks. The song achieved even greater success in the UK, where it peaked at #34 on the UK Top 40 in 1993. The song was used as a promo for the 18th season of the American animated sitcom South Park. The song was sampled by more than 50 rap artists including Jeru The Damaja, The Notorious B.I.G., Eminem, Vinnie Paz and A$AP Mob.

The second single, &quot;Slam&quot; was released, May 11, 1993. The song introduced slamdancing into hip-hop. &quot;Slam&quot; was Onyx&#x27;s breakthrough single, making it to number 4 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was the group&#x27;s second straight single to make it to number 1 on the Hot Rap Singles for two weeks. The single was first certified Gold on July 7, 1993, before being certified Platinum on August 10, 1993. According to Fredro Starr, for all time was sold about 5 million copies of the single. The song was sampled by more than 25 rap artists including GZA, Eminem, PMD, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Krazy Drayz of Das EFX.

The third single, &quot;Shifftee&quot; was released, August 30, 1993. The song was about being grimy and having that echo into a myriad of life situations. Produced by Chyskillz and Jam Master Jay, &quot;Shifftee&quot; was not as successful as the first two singles, but it still managed to make to five different &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, peaking at 2 on the Hot Rap Singles. The song was sampled by several rap artists including Mad Skillz, Raekwon, Marco Polo and Noreaga.

The fourth single, &quot;Da Nex Niguz&quot;/&quot;Da Nex DingDong&quot; was released, November 14, 1993. It was accompanied by the release of a video on it.

== 25th anniversary ==
Several different media have written articles dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the release of the album. Sha Be Allah of The Source said &quot;Onyx made their claim to fame with their trademark “mad face”, bald heads and all black everything. Many copycats came after these guys, but their mark on the game is definitely unparalleled. Salute to Fredro, Sticky, Seez, and a big RIP to DS.&quot;

Paul Meara of &quot;AmbrosiaForHeads&quot; said &quot;Leading up to the Bacdafucup‘s March 30 drop was their single “Throw Ya Guns,” released in November 1992. It exemplified ONYX&#x27;s violent and menacing musical style and became a precursor to perhaps the group&#x27;s most famous single ever in “Slam,” which eventually would make it all the way to #4 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 chart.&quot;

Vin Rican, the author of the program &quot;Wax Only&quot;, which appears on the YouTube channel of LA radio station KPWR, made a mix composed of the drums used to create the album &quot;Bacdafucup&quot;.

Bronx, NYC videographer Olise Forel made a hip-hop cover animation.

== Appearance in movies and on television ==

* &quot;Slam&quot; has been used in movies such as &quot;How High&quot; and TV shows such as &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; and &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;.
* Five songs from &quot;Bacdafucup&quot; were included in Forest Whitaker&#x27;s HBO drama &quot;Strapped&quot;: &quot;Throw Ya Gunz&quot;, &quot;Bichasniguz&quot;, &quot;Nigga Bridges&quot;, &quot;Bacdafucup&quot;, &quot;Attack of da Bal-Hedz&quot;.

==Critical response==

&quot;Bacdafucup&quot; was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote: &quot;Four baldheads from Queens, N.Y., with Jam Master Jay of Run-D.M.C. co-producing, these menaces crank up monolithic old-school noise, thick as a brick and iceberg cold.&quot; James Bernard of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the album an A−, saying &quot;...bare-knuckles hip-hop featuring raw beats and four manic MCs competing for center stage. Onyx&#x27;s confrontational attitude is so over-the-top that its enthusiasm becomes infectious...&quot; (&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine, Issue No. 165 – April 9, 1993, p. 54).

Ghetto Communicator of &quot;The Source&quot; gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying &quot;...an extremely dope vision of ugliness that is not for the sensitive...the lyrical chemistry between Sticky Fingaz and Fredro Starr combined with the phat production work of Chyskills (Large Professor&#x27;s old school homey) and Kool Tee blows shit into orbit and leaves you open for more...&quot; (&quot;The Source&quot; magazine, Issue #42 - March, 1993, p. 79).

&quot;Spin&quot; said &quot;...&#x27;Move back, muthafuckas! The Onyx is here!&#x27;...When the gentlemen of Onyx beseech this of you, it would be within your best interest to heed their desires and indeed withdraw as requested ...Onyx raps it hard like it is...&quot; (&quot;Spin&quot; magazine June, 1993, p. 18). Gil Griffin of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that Onyx&#x27;s lyrics about beat-downs, stickups and gun-toting may be more real than fantasy.

Steve &#x27;Flash&#x27; Juon of &quot;RapReviews&quot; gave the album eight out of ten, saying &quot;For the most part, the plusses on this album are many for fans of hardcore rap, with Sticky Fingaz providing the needed comic relief if and when things get too serious. Other than the six unnecessary skits and a couple of throwaway songs that don&#x27;t hold up to the high standard the group themselves set, &quot;Bacdafucup&quot; is a solid debut album for Onyx from beginning to finish.&quot; Deedub of &quot;Time Is Illmatic&quot; said &quot;Jam Master Jay insisting that Sticky Fingaz be added to Onyx. There is no question that the self-proclaimed “mad author of anguish” is the chief emcee and carries the lyrical load throughout BacDaFucUp. Led by Sticky, Onyx&#x27;s animated hyper-energy and horrorgangster rhymes mixed with quality and consistently dark production, make BacDaFucUp an overall solid album and very entertaining listen&quot;.

==Accolades==
In 1998, &quot;The Source&quot; selected the album as one of &quot;100 Best Albums&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Ego Trip&quot;″s editors ranked album in their list &quot;Hip Hop&#x27;s 25 Greatest Albums by Year 1993&quot; in &quot;Ego Trip&#x27;s Book of Rap Lists&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Complex&quot; put the album in their list &quot;Do It Again: When Rappers Redo Their Album Covers&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Complex&quot; put the album in their list &quot;The 50 Best Rap Album Titles Ever&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Spin&quot; put the album in their list &quot;The 50 Best Rap Albums from 1993&quot;.

<doc id="646611" wikidata="Q2418292" url="?curid=646611" title="Peripatus">
<text>Peripatus is a genus of velvet worms in the Peripatidae family. The name &quot;peripatus&quot; (unitalicised and uncapitalised) is also used to refer to the Onychophora as a whole, although this group comprises many other genera besides &quot;Peripatus&quot;. The genus &quot;Peripatus&quot; is found in Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America. This genus is viviparous, with mothers supplying nourishment to their embryos through a placenta.

== Description ==
Velvet worms in this genus may have as few as 24 or 25 pairs of legs (in &quot;P. antiguensis&quot; or &quot;P. dominicae&quot;, respectively) or as many as 36 leg pairs (in &quot;P. evelinae&quot;). Males in this genus bear crural tubercles on more than two pregenital leg pairs. The dorsal primary papillae in this genus feature an apical piece that is larger than the basal piece. 

==Species==
The genus contains the following species:
* &quot;Peripatus basilensis&quot; – Hispaniola (Haiti, Dominican Republic)
* &quot;Peripatus bouvieri&quot; – Colombia
* &quot;Peripatus brolemanni&quot; – Venezuela
* &quot;Peripatus danicus&quot; – Virgin Islands
* &quot;Peripatus darlingtoni&quot; – Hispaniola
* &quot;Peripatus dominicae&quot; – Dominica
* &quot;Peripatus evelinae&quot; – Brazil
* &quot;Peripatus haitiensis&quot; – Hispaniola
* &quot;Peripatus heloisae&quot; – Brazil
* &quot;Peripatus juanensis&quot; – Puerto Rico
* &quot;Peripatus juliformis&quot; – Saint Vincent Island
* &quot;Peripatus lachauxensis&quot; – Hispaniola

* &quot;Peripatus ruber&quot; – Costa Rica
* &quot;Peripatus sedgwicki&quot; – Venezuela
* &quot;Peripatus swainsonae&quot; – Jamaica

&quot;Peripatus antiguensis&quot; and &quot;Peripatus bavaysi&quot; are considered &quot;nomina dubia&quot; by Oliveira et al. 2012.

===Former species===
* &quot;Mongeperipatus solorzanoi&quot; , Solórzano&#x27;s velvet worm – Costa Rica
