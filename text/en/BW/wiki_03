<text>The doctrine of nondelegation (or non-delegation principle) is the theory that one branch of government must not authorize another entity to exercise the power or function which it is constitutionally authorized to exercise itself. It is or in all written constitutions that impose a strict structural separation of powers. It is usually applied in questions of constitutionally improper delegations of powers of any of the three branches of government to either of the other, to the administrative state, or to private entities. Although it is usually constitutional for executive officials to delegate executive powers to executive branch subordinates, there can also be improper delegations of powers within an executive branch.

In the United Kingdom, the non-delegation principle refers to the &quot;prima facie&quot; presumption that statutory powers granted to public bodies by Parliament can not be delegated to other people or bodies.

==Australia==

Australian federalism does not permit the federal Parliament or government to delegate its powers to state or territorial parliaments or governments, nor territorial parliaments or governments to delegate their powers to the federal Parliament or government, but does permit a state parliaments delegate its powers to the federal parliament by means of section 51 subsection (xxxvii) of the Constitution Act 1901.

==Canada==

Canadian federalism does not permit Parliament or the provincial legislatures to delegate their powers to each other. See: &quot;Attorney General of Nova Scotia v. Attorney General of Canada&quot;, [1951] S.C.R. 31

==United States==

In the Federal Government of the United States, the nondelegation doctrine is the theory that the Congress of the United States, being vested with &quot;all legislative powers&quot; by Article One, Section 1 of the United States Constitution, cannot delegate that power to anyone else. The scope of this restriction has been the subject of dispute. The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;J. W. Hampton, Jr. &amp; Co. v. United States&quot; (1928) that congressional delegation of legislative authority is an implied power of Congress that is constitutional so long as Congress provides an &quot;intelligible principle&quot; to guide the executive branch: Posner and Vermeule in 2002 further argued that the restriction is only that the legislature cannot delegate the authority to vote on legislation or execute other &quot;de jure&quot; powers of the legislature. Further, they argue that the grant of power to the executive branch is never a transfer of legislative power but rather an exercise of legislative power.

For example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is an agency in the executive branch created by Congress with the power to regulate food and drugs in the United States. Congress has given the FDA a broad mandate to ensure the safety of the public and prevent false advertising, but it is up to the agency to assess risks and announce prohibitions on harmful additives, and to determine the process by which actions will be brought based on the same. Similarly, the Internal Revenue Service has been given the responsibility of collecting taxes that are assessed under the Internal Revenue Code. Although Congress has determined the amount of the tax to be assessed, it has delegated to the IRS the authority to determine how such taxes are to be collected. The nondelegation doctrine has been used in such cases to argue against the constitutionality of expanding bureaucratic power. Some scholars argue the nondelegation doctrine has proven popular in state courts, but with two exceptions in 1935, legal scholars argue that the doctrine is not evident in federal courts. This trend began to reverse due to the views of Chief Justice John Roberts, who joined Justice Gorsuch&#x27;s dissenting opinion in &quot;Gundy v. United States&quot;. In &quot;Gundy&quot;, the Court upheld a provision of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act, authorizing the attorney general “to prescribe rules” concerning offenders who would have to register as sex offenders. However, Gorsuch argued that the statutory provision violated the nondelegation doctrine because it was not one of three exceptions to the nondelegation doctrine.

===Case law===

==== Pre-1935 ====
The origins of the nondelegation doctrine, as interpreted in U.S., can be traced back to at least 1690, when John Locke wrote:

The Legislative cannot transfer the Power of Making Laws to any other hands. For it being but a delegated Power from the People, they, who have it, cannot pass it over to others. ... And when the people have said, We will submit to rules, and be govern&#x27;d by Laws made by such Men, and in such Forms, no Body else can say other Men shall make Laws for them; nor can the people be bound by any Laws but such as are Enacted by those, whom they have Chosen, and Authorised to make Laws for them. The power of the Legislative being derived from the People by a positive voluntary Grant and Institution, can be no other, than what the positive Grant conveyed, which being only to make Laws, and not to make Legislators, the Legislative can have no power to transfer their Authority of making laws, and place it in other hands.
One of the earliest cases involving the exact limits of nondelegation was &quot;Wayman v. Southard&quot; (1825). Congress had delegated to the courts the power to prescribe judicial procedure; it was contended that Congress had thereby unconstitutionally clothed the judiciary with legislative powers. While Chief Justice John Marshall conceded that the determination of rules of procedure was a legislative function, he distinguished between &quot;important&quot; subjects and mere details. Marshall wrote that &quot;a general provision may be made, and power given to those who are to act under such general provisions, to fill up the details.&quot; In 1892, the Court in &quot;Field v. Clark&quot;, 143 U.S. 649, noted &quot;That congress cannot delegate legislative power to the president is a principle universally recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution&quot; while holding that the tariff-setting authority delegated in the McKinley Act &quot;was not the making of law,&quot; but rather empowered the executive branch to serve as a &quot;mere agent&quot; of Congress.

==== 1935 ====
During the 1930s, Congress provided the executive branch with wide powers to combat the Great Depression. The Supreme Court case of &quot;Panama Refining v. Ryan&quot;, 293 U.S. 388 (1935) involved the National Industrial Recovery Act, which included a provision granting the President the authority to prohibit the interstate shipment of petroleum in excess of certain quotas. In the &quot;Panama Refining&quot; case, however, the Court struck down the provision on the ground that Congress had set &quot;no criterion to govern the President&#x27;s course.&quot;

Other provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act were also challenged. In &quot;Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States&quot; (1935), the Supreme Court considered a provision which permitted the President to approve trade codes, drafted by the businesses themselves, so as to ensure &quot;fair competition.&quot; The Supreme Court found that, since the law sets no explicit guidelines, businesses &quot;may roam at will and the President may approve or disapprove their proposal as he may see fit.&quot; Thus, they struck down the relevant provisions of the Recovery Act.

==== Post-1935 ====
In the 1989 case &quot;Mistretta v. United States&quot;, the Court stated that:

The Supreme Court has never found a violation of the nondelegation doctrine outside of &quot;Panama Refining&quot; and &quot;Schechter Poultry&quot; in 1935. Exemplifying the Court&#x27;s legal reasoning on this matter, it ruled in the 1998 case &quot;Clinton v. City of New York&quot; that the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which authorized the President to selectively void portions of appropriation bills, was a violation of the Presentment Clause, which sets forth the formalities governing the passage of legislation. Although the Court noted that the attorneys prosecuting the case had extensively discussed the nondelegation doctrine, the Court declined to consider that question. However, Justice Kennedy, in a concurring opinion, wrote that he would have found the statute to violate the exclusive responsibility for laws to be made by Congress.

=== Major questions doctrine ===
The major questions doctrine is another doctrine that restricts Congressional delegation of legislative authority to agencies. It says that when a government agency seeks to decide an issue of &quot;vast economic or political significance,&quot; a vague or general delegation of authority from Congress is not enough. Rather, the agency must have clear statutory authorization to decide the issue.

The major questions doctrine serves as an exception to the &quot;Chevron&quot; doctrine, which ordinarily requires courts to defer to an agency&#x27;s interpretation of a statute it enforces, so long as the statute is ambiguous and the agency&#x27;s interpretation is reasonable. However, it goes further than just negating deference to the agency. Even if the most reasonable interpretation of the statute allows the agency to take an action, it will not be enough unless that delegation of authority is clearly stated.

In explaining the major questions doctrine in &quot;UARG v. EPA&quot; (2014), the Supreme Court explained that &quot;We expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast &#x27;economic and political significance.&#x27;&quot; Similarly, in &quot;Whitman v. American Trucking Associations&quot; (2001), the Court stated that Congress &quot;does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions—it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.”

The Supreme Court first explicitly embraced the phrase &quot;major questions doctrine&quot; in &quot;West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency&quot; (2022), the decision which held that the EPA&#x27;s Clean Power Plan, requiring energy producers to shift from fossil fuels to renewable sources, was not authorized by the Clean Air Act.

With the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, some commentators argued that Congress overruled the Court by clarifying that carbon dioxide is one of the pollutants covered by the 1970 Clean Air Act. However, the Supreme Court had already held that greenhouse gasses are pollutants in &quot;Massachusetts v. EPA&quot; (2007), and the Supreme Court did not overrule that holding in &quot;West Virginia v. EPA&quot;.

== United Kingdom ==
In general, powers granted by Parliament are presumed to only be exercisable by the body which is given those powers and can not be delegated. This is known as the &quot;non-delegation principle&quot; or the &quot;presumption against delegation&quot;.

For example, in &quot;Barnard v National Dock Labour Board&quot; [1953] 2 QB 18, the Court of Appeal held that the delegation of disciplinary powers originally granted to the London Dock Labour Board to the port manager was unlawful. In his judgment, Lord Denning argued that the power of suspension was a judicial function. The dock labour board had to receive reports from employers and investigate them, they had to inquire whether the accused was guilty of misconduct, and they had to decide the appropriate disciplinary action to take. And as &quot;[n]o judicial tribunal can delegate its functions unless it is enabled to do so expressly or by necessary implication&quot;, the delegation of the disciplinary powers was held to be unlawful.

=== Exceptions to the non-delegation principle ===

==== Consultation as opposed to delegation ====
English courts have made a distinction between seeking consultation and the delegation of powers, the former of which is deemed to be permissible as decision making does not happen within an &quot;institutional bubble&quot;. The important factor in deciding whether a public body is seeking consultation or whether they have delegated those powers is examining whether the powers are ultimately at the hands of the decision-maker in practice, as opposed to &quot;de jure&quot;.

In &quot;R (New London College) v Secretary of State for the Home Department&quot; [2013] UKSC 51, the Supreme Court held that the Home Secretary did not unlawfully delegate her powers to control entry into the UK to sponsoring institutions. Immigration rules dictated that all student visa applicants had to produce a &quot;Confirmation of Studies&quot; (CAS) which is produced by sponsoring institutions like universities. As part of the application process, institutions must make judgements whether they had an intention to study there. The Supreme Court rejected arguments that this was tantamount to the delegation of powers to sponsoring institutions. Lord Sumption, in his judgment, noted that &quot;a significant number of Tier 4 (General) migrants with a CAS are in fact refused leave to enter or remain on these grounds&quot;. This, according to the Supreme Court, showed that the Home Secretary &quot;de facto&quot; exercised powers of final decision and therefore was merely consulting sponsoring institutions, not delegating her powers.

==== The &quot;Carltona&quot; doctrine ====

The &quot;Carltona&quot; doctrine (or &quot;Carltona&quot; principle) is the idea that when powers are granted to departmental officials, they can be lawfully delegated to their civil servants.

<doc id="634099" wikidata="Q238361" url="?curid=634099" title="Della Reese">
<text>Della Reese (born Delloreese Patricia Early; July 6, 1931 – November 19, 2017) was an American singer, actress, television personality, author and ordained minister. As a singer, she recorded blues, gospel, jazz and pop. Several of her singles made the US Hot 100, including the number two charting song, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know?&quot; (1959). As a television personality and actress, she was the first black woman to host her own talk show and appeared on the highly-rated CBS television series &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;.

Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Reese sang in her church&#x27;s choir and was discovered by gospel entertainer, Mahalia Jackson, who took Reese on tour for several years. Reese then joined a gospel group called The Meditation Singers before turning her attention towards secular music. She won a local talent competition, which led to a multiple-week appearance at The Flame nightclub in New York City. The appearance helped Reese secure her first recording contract with Jubilee Records in 1954 where she recorded a series of albums. Her only commercial success at the label was the 1957 single, &quot;And That Reminds Me&quot;, which sold a million copies. Signing a contract the larger RCA Victor label, she had her greatest success as a singer with the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know&quot; and &quot;Not One Minute More&quot;. Several more LP&#x27;s were issued by RCA Victor including the top 40-charting album, &quot;Della&quot; (1960).

Reese began appearing on nationally-broadcast US television programs by the early 1960s, notably &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Her appearances led to the creation of her own talk show called &quot;Della&quot;, which ran for nearly 200 episodes between 1969 and 1970. She continued recording through the 1970s with albums issued by ABC–Paramount, Avco Embassy and LMI. During the 1970s, Reese started an acting career in films such as &quot;Psychic Killer&quot; and shows such as &quot;Chico and the Man&quot;. She returned to gospel music after forming the group, Brilliance, which released an album in 1985 and was later nominated by the Grammy Awards. Reese then appeared in Eddie Murphy&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; and the short-lived 1991 TV series co-starring Redd Foxx called &quot;The Royal Family&quot;.

Reese became an ordained minister during the 1980s decade and began regularly leading sermons. Reese then went on to star, in the lead role of Tess, in the CBS TV series, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, co-starring Roma Downey. Airing in 1994, the show became one of the top-rated and highest-watched shows for the CBS network for several years and Reese remained on the show until 2003. During the 1990s, Reese continued recording as well, releasing the Grammy-nominated gospel album, &quot;My Soul Feels Better Right Now&quot; (1998). She also released her autobiography in 1997 titled, &quot;Angels Along the Way&quot;. Four more books followed by Reese through 2012. She also starred in several CBS television films during the 2000s and appeared in the 2005 film &quot;Beauty Shop&quot;. Reese continued acting until her retirement in 2014.

==Early years==
Della Reese was born Delloreese Patricia Early on July 6, 1931, in the Black Bottom neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan to Richard Thaddeus Early (a steelworker) and Nellie Mitchelle (a cook). Her mother was alleged to have Cherokee ancestry. She also had five older sisters and one brother. From a young age, Reese and her mother would attend cinemas to watch popular films of the era. She often returned from the films acting out scenes at home. Reese also enjoyed singing from an early age, often singing at a high volume into the skylight of their home&#x27;s bathroom. According to Reese, her singing became so loud that her parents boarded up the skylight so she could not sing anymore.

Reese joined her local church choir at age six. At age 13, she was heard by gospel performer, Mahalia Jackson, who was impressed by her singing and chose her to replace another female vocalist in her road show. Reese toured with Jackson throughout the United States for three summers during her adolescent years. In her late teenage years, Reese joined a Detroit-based gospel group called the Meditation Singers. During this time she also attended Detroit&#x27;s Cass Technical High School where she graduated at age 15, and then majored in psychology at Wayne State University in 1949.

Reese ultimately dropped out of college after her mother died of a cerebral hemorrhage. She then had a falling-out with her father, which caused her to move out of the family home and support herself by working odd jobs. This included working as a truck driver and taxi cab driver. At the same time, she continued touring and performing with the Meditation Singers. However, Reese left the group after becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of money she was earning as a gospel performer. It was during this period that she changed her professional name to Della Reese.

She then turned her attention towards secular music, eventually finding employment at Detroit&#x27;s Oriel Bowling Alley, one of the first bowling alleys in the region to offer live entertainment. While working there, she entered a local talent show and won the program. As first-place-winner, Reese was given the opportunity to perform a one-week engagement at The Flame, a New York City nightclub known for elevating aspiring black performers. The one-week stint turned into an 18-week engagement that was heard by agent, Lee Magid. With Magid&#x27;s help, Reese joined the Erskine Hawkins orchestra in 1953.

==Music career==
===1954–1958: Early recordings and commercial success===
The first recordings Reese made were issued on the Great Lakes label, resulting in one 1954 single release: &quot;Yes Indeed&quot;. Magid then helped Reese sign her first official recording contract with an independent label named Jubilee Records. Her debut-label single was 1955&#x27;s &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot;, which sold 500,000 copies according to biographer Jessie Carney Smith. Additional mid-1950s releases included a cover of &quot;Time After Time&quot;, &quot;Years from Now&quot; and &quot;My Melancholy Baby&quot;. The latter served as the title tune to Reese&#x27;s 1956 debut Jubilee LP of the same name. Reese then recorded &quot;And That Reminds Me&quot;, an English adaptation of the Italian &quot;Autumn Concerto&quot; instrumental. It was her first charting single, reaching number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 15 in Australia and number five in Canada. It was also Reese&#x27;s first song to sell over one million copies.

Reese&#x27;s music career was further elevated by Ed Sullivan who featured her on his television show multiple times and exposed her to a national audience. She remained with the Jubilee label through 1959, recording a total of 15 singles and six albums. Her second studio LP was 1958&#x27;s &quot;Amen!&quot; a collection of gospel songs that included The Meditation Singers and was cut in her hometown. The label also issued her first live album titled &quot;A Date with Della Reese at Mr. Kelly&#x27;s in Chicago&quot; (1958). It was followed by a collection of blues standards titled &quot;The Story of the Blues&quot; (1959), which consisted of both songs and spoken word narration by Reese describing genre&#x27;s history. A studio album of ballads was then released in 1959 titled &quot;What Do You Know About Love?&quot; along with a compilation of her Jubilee singles, which was also called &quot;And That Reminds Me&quot;. Music publications of the era praised Reese&#x27;s distinctive vocal enunciation and &quot;emotional&quot; delivery on her LP&#x27;s.

===1959–1970: &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know?&quot; and peak commercial years===
Reese was signed in August 1959 to a long-term recording contract with the RCA Victor label and was paired with production team, Hugo &amp; Luigi. Her first RCA release was the 1959 single &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know?&quot;, which was adapted from &quot;Musetta&#x27;s Waltz&quot; in &quot;La bohème&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know?&quot; became Reese&#x27;s most commercially-successful single, reaching number two on the US Hot 100 and number one on the US R&amp;B sides chart. Selling over one million copies, it became Reese&#x27;s second disc to receive a gold certification. Her second RCA single, &quot;Not One Minute More&quot; (1960), rose to number 16 on the US Hot 100, number 12 on the US R&amp;B chart and number 14 in Australia. Both singles led to the release of her first RCA studio LP titled &quot;Della&quot; (1960), which featured cover tunes performed in both swing and pop styles. It featured arrangements made by Reese herself but they not officially credited to her. &quot;Della&quot; also became her first LP to make the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, peaking at number 35.

Reese reached her peak commercial success during this period leading to a variety of opportunities, including singing &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot; at the 1960 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The performance made Reese the first black music artist to perform at an All-Star game. RCA Victor continued issuing studio albums by Reese during the early 1960s, including another swing-inspired LP titled &quot;Special Delivery&quot;, which rose to number 113 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 1961. The latter featured arrangements made by Mercer Ellington (the son of Duke Ellington), whom Reese briefly married. Her 1962 studio LP, &quot;The Classic Della&quot;, was her third to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, rising to number 94. Consisting of vocal adaptations of classical pieces, it also included &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know?&quot;. It was then followed by a similarly-themed LP titled &quot;Waltz with Me, Della&quot; (1963). The label also issued Reese&#x27;s second and third live LP&#x27;s: &quot;Della on Stage&quot; (1962) and &quot;Della Reese at Basin Street East&quot; (1964). Both albums featured a variety of songs ranging from blues to gospel. RCA also continued issuing singles by Reese, none of which made the top 40 of the US charts. Her highest-peaking single of this period was her cover of &quot;Someday (You&#x27;ll Want Me to Want You)&quot;, which made the Hot 100 top 60 in 1960.

In 1965, Reese signed a new recording contract with ABC–Paramount, which strove to market her further in a pop direction. Her first label single was 1965&#x27;s &quot;After Loving You&quot;, which rose to number 95 on the US Hot 100 and number 21 on the US adult contemporary chart. Reese&#x27;s only other single to chart was a 1966 cover of &quot;It Was a Very Good Year&quot;, which peaked at number 99 on the Hot 100. The label also issued several studio LP&#x27;s that featured of variety of musical genres including pop, jazz and the blues: &quot;C&#x27;mon and Hear Della Reese!&quot; (1965), &quot;&quot;i like it like dat!&quot;&quot; (1966), &quot;Della on Strings of Blue&quot; (1967) and &quot;I Gotta Be Me...This Trip Out&quot; (1968).

During this period, Reese routinely toured nightclubs and theaters across the US. She also became a mainstay performer in Las Vegas, but often faced racial discrimination working there as a black entertainer. &quot;I could sing there but I could not eat there,&quot; she recalled in 2004. Nonetheless, Reese worked the Las Vegas strip for nine years. She also continued her recording career, signing a new contract in 1969 with Avco Embassy Records, a label that was presided over by Reese&#x27;s former RCA producers, Hugo &amp; Luigi. Her first Avco Embassy single was a cover of &quot;Games People Play&quot; (backed on the B-side with a cover of &quot;Compared to What&quot;). Both songs were Reese&#x27;s final to make the US charts, both reaching the Bubbling Under Hot 100 in 1970. They appeared on her first-label studio LP titled &quot;Black Is Beautiful&quot;, which was her only one to make the US R&amp;B albums chart. The label issued a second studio album in 1970 titled &quot;Right Now&quot;.

===1971–2006: Later recordings and return to gospel music===
Reese&#x27;s commercial success waned during the 1970s and she spent more time focused on an acting and television career. However, she continued performing clubs and toured regularly. She also continued a recording career, becoming one of the first artists to join Lee Magid&#x27;s LMI Records in 1973. The label issued a single by Reese titled &quot;(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Right&quot;. The label then issued Reese&#x27;s next studio album the same year titled &quot;Let Me in Your Life&quot;, which Magid produced himself. Reese then collaborated with the Jazz a La Carte Players for the 1979 live album, &quot;One of a Kind&quot;. The album was considered a return to her jazz roots, according to &quot;Stereo Review&quot;.

Reese joined Applause Records in 1982 and the label issued her next studio album called &quot;Sure Like Lovin&#x27; You&quot;. A one-time &quot;jam session&quot; with several musicians led Reese to return to gospel music and form a group called Brilliance. The group included O.C. Smith, Mary Clayton, Vermettya Royster, and Eric Strom. They signed a contract with Atlanta International Records and an album was issued in 1986 titled &quot;Della Reese and Brilliance&quot;. Co-produced by Reese herself, it was praised as &quot;an absolutely stunning album&quot; by &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1987 and a song from the collection (&quot;You Gave Me Love&quot;) received a nomination by the Grammy Awards for Best Female Gospel Soul Performance. Reese continued recording into the 1990s, appearing with a live album on her husband&#x27;s Lett label titled &quot;Some of My Best Friends Are the Blues&quot; in 1995. A second live album was issued in 1998 by Homeland called &quot;My Soul Feels Better Right Now&quot;. It was Reese&#x27;s third recording to receive a nomination by the Grammy Awards. Her final album project was a 2006 studio collection issued by the Spiritual Icon label titled &quot;Give It to God&quot;.

===Artistry===
Reese&#x27;s music has been classified into the genres of blues, jazz, gospel, pop and R&amp;B. Walt Friedwald of the book &quot;A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers&quot; classified Reese as a jazz artist whose repertoire had elements of swing as well. Meanwhile, AllMusic critic Lindsay Planer claimed she &quot;was never a hardcore jazz singer&quot; because she was not &quot;improvisation minded&quot; like that of Carmen McRae or Sarah Vaughan. Planer instead claimed that Reese&#x27;s musical style was centered more in pop, similar in style to that of Tony Bennett or Jo Stafford. Author James Lynwood Walker called Reese an &quot;outstanding contemporary blues singer&quot;, categorizing her with Lou Rawls and Al Hibbler. Reese cited Ethel Waters as her earliest musical influence and then cited Mahalia Jackson as an influence in her teen years. &quot;She taught me how to communicate with people—to sing so that people would appreciate it and get a feeling from it,&quot; Reese told &quot;Parade&quot; in 2014. Reese also cited Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald and Carmen McRae as influences on her singing as well.

==Television and acting career==
===1959–1974: National television stardom and &quot;Della&quot;===
Reese&#x27;s television career was launched by Ed Sullivan, who regularly featured her on his nationally-syndicated program, &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. During tapings, Reese routinely performed &quot;And That Reminds Me&quot; because it was a personal favorite of Sullivan and his wife. In the late 1960s, Reese focused more on television appearances as her nightclubs began to close and the music industry as changing. According to Reese, she was the first black music artist to &quot;sit down&quot; on televised talk show. She first appeared on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, which further elevated offers to appear on more major television programs. She then became friendly with Mike Douglas, who invited her to co-host his television show.

Reese was then approached by director Woody Fraser about hosting her own talk show on network television. According to Reese, Fraser was &quot;a kidder&quot; and she did not take his offer seriously until he came to her home three weeks later with a set designer. The &quot;Della&quot; talk show was launched in 1969, making Reese the first black woman to have her own talk show on prime time television. The show ran for nearly 200 episodes through March 1970 and aired on national television five days a week. During the show&#x27;s run, Reese performed songs herself and had guest performers on episodes. It was ultimately cancelled due to the cost of having a 16-piece orchestra. Reese was offered to cut the orchestra but she ultimately refused and decided to cancel it instead. She then ran into Johnny Carson in a television studio hallway and he invited her to guest-host his show. Reese agreed and in 1970, she became the first woman to guest-host &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

===1975–1993: Acting transition===

In addition to television roles, Reese also embarked on an acting career. &quot;It was just like one thing flowing into another. It was finding another rhythm so you could take the music out,&quot; she recalled in an interview. Although her first speaking role was in &quot;The Mod Squad&quot; (1969), it took several years for Reese to gain acceptance as an actress rather than as a singer. In 1975, Reese played the role of Mrs. Gibson in the thriller movie, &quot;Psychic Killer&quot;. She then had a recurring role in the television series &quot;Chico and the Man&quot; where she portrayed an owner of town diner. She remained on the show through 1978 when it was cancelled following the death of Freddie Prinze. Reese also appeared in theatrical productions during this period, including &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&quot; (1982) and &quot;Blues in the Night&quot; (1983).

Eddie Murphy did not have Reese in mind when he was looking for a female actress to play a madame in his upcoming movie. However, after auditioning, Murphy was &quot;shocked&quot; by her acting abilities, according to an article from &quot;Jet&quot;. In 1989, &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; was released featuring Murphy and Reese, along with Richard Pryor, Jasmine Guy, Arsenio Hall and Redd Foxx. The film was unsuccessful at the box office and was given negative reviews by film critics. Yet, the comedic chemistry between Foxx and Reese on &quot;Harlem Nights&quot; inspired Murphy to write &quot;The Royal Family&quot;, a TV show which aired on CBS in September 1991. One month later, Foxx suffered a heart attack during a filming of an episode. Reese thought Foxx was &quot;doing pratfalls&quot; and did not take it seriously until she saw him lying on the floor in pain. Foxx died the same day and the show attempted to return but it did not produce the same ratings as it did with Foxx there, leading to its cancellation in 1992.

===1994–2014: Success with &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; and final acting credits===

Reese was about to embark on a vacation with her husband when her agent offered her a lead role in an upcoming series called &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. At first, Reese declined the offer because of the stress associated from &quot;The Royal Family&quot; cancelling. Reese was offered a large sum of money to film the pilot and decided to &quot;talk to God&quot;, who ultimately told Reese to &quot;do this for me&quot;. Reese then shot the pilot, but it was not initially picked up by network television. However, executive producer, Martha Williamson, believed it could be successful if the pilot was retooled to focus more on religion. In 1994, &quot;Touched by An Angel&quot; officially aired on CBS. Costarring Roma Downey (a guardian angel) and Reese as the supervising angel named Tess, the premise of each episode focused on the angels helping people cross over from life into death. Reese sang the theme song which appeared at the beginning of each episode and was titled &quot;Walk with You&quot;.

Despite negative critical reviews and CBS threatening to take it off the air, the series attracted roughly 25 million viewers weekly and was one of the CBS network&#x27;s top rated shows for three seasons. Reese credited its success to audiences who felt inspired to &quot;change their minds and change their lives&quot;. During her time on the series, Reese contested her salary with CBS. Holding a press conference in 1997, Reese claimed that CBS had given Downey a 100 percent salary increase while she only received a 12.5 percent salary increase. &quot;They wanted to give everybody else a raise, and they didn&#x27;t want to give me a raise, and I couldn&#x27;t accept that. Just that simple,&quot; she explained in an interview. One year later, the dispute was settled when CBS agreed to increase her salary from $40,000 to $100,000 per episode. &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; ran for six more years until its ending in 2003.

Reese continued her acting career in the 2000s and 2010s decades. Reese and husband Franklin Lett filmed several television movies for CBS in the 2000s such as &quot;The Secret Path&quot; and &quot;Anya Bell&quot;. She appeared in a film about a black-owned hair salon starring Queen Latifah called &quot;Beauty Shop&quot; (2005). She then was featured in a film about the upbringing of Markus Redmond titled &quot;If I Had Known I Was a Genius&quot; (2007) alongside Whoopi Goldberg, Sharon Stone and Tara Reid. She also appeared in several Christmas-themed television films such as &quot;Christmas Angel&quot; and &quot;Dear Secret Santa&quot; on the Lifetime network Her last acting credits were on two episodes of the show &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered&quot; and then Reese retired from acting in 2014.

==Books and ministry==
Reese was the author of several books in addition to her acting and singing careers. Her first book was &quot;Angels Along the Way: My Life from Help Above&quot; was released by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons and was released in 1997. Co-written by Franklin Lett and Mim Eichler, the book was a biography of Reese&#x27;s life up to that point. In 1999, Reese released a fictional children&#x27;s book about spirituality called &quot;God Inside of Me&quot;. Her third book was released in 2001 titled &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot;, a series of passages and scriptures centered on love. A fourth book released the same year titled &quot;Strength Is the Energy of God!&quot; focused on discussing spiritual and inspirational strength. Her fifth and final book was released in 2012 titled &quot;Metaphysically Speaking: The Bible is the Greatest How-To Book Ever Written&quot;. Published by Reese&#x27;s own company, it provided guidance on how to find one&#x27;s own spirituality.

Reese stopped attending church in her 20&#x27;s after finding it did not agree with her spiritual beliefs. After a near-fatal accident in 1979, Reese became inspired by Reverend Johnnie Colemon, the founder of the non-denominational Universal Foundation for Better Living church. She started attending services and took theological course work at the Johnnie Colemon Institute. She then began hosting classes at her California home beginning in 1984. Reese officially became an ordained minister in 1987 and founded her own church called Understanding Principles for Better Living. The &quot;Up Church&quot; is under Colman&#x27;s Universal Foundation for Better Living. In her ministerial work, she was known as the Rev. Dr. Della Reese Lett.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===

Reese was married four times. Her first marriage was in 1952 to Vermont Taliaferro, a factory worker who was nineteen years older than her. The pair divorced in 1958. According to Reese, Taliaferro was abusive and with Ed Sullivan&#x27;s intervention, the marriage ended. Her second marriage was in 1959 to accountant, Leroy Gray, which ended 1961. Reese ended the marriage because Gray did not tell her that the divorce from his ex-wife was invalid. In 1961, Reese married Duke Ellington&#x27;s son, Mercer Ellington. However, the marriage was also annulled because he received an invalid Mexican divorce with his previous marriage. Reese then agreed not to get married again. However, she did marry for a final time to concert promoter, Franklin Lett. They remained married from 1983 until Reese&#x27;s death. Reese had two stepchildren from Lett&#x27;s previous marriage: Dominque Lett and Franklin Lett III. In a 2004 interview, Reese commented of her marriage to Lett, &quot;He&#x27;s my friend. He&#x27;s my lover. He&#x27;s my running buddy. He&#x27;s my husband. He&#x27;s my manager. He is absolutely my everything.&quot;

Reese adopted the daughter of her half-brother named Deloreese Daniel Owens. In the same 2004 interview, Reese stated that her brother and sister &quot;had five children that they were having a terrible time feeding and abortion was not as easily come by&quot;. Reese offered to adopt the child which her sister-in-law first agreed to. However, after giving birth, her sister-in-law chose to keep the baby. Two years later when Reese was working a club in Chicago, they brought the baby to her and reportedly told her, &quot;I should have given you the baby when I said I would.&quot; Reese then went on to officially adopt her. Owens died in March 2002 at 41 years old, which was said to be caused by a &quot;pituitary dysfunction&quot;, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

===Health challenges===
In September 1970, Reese was with her daughter playing in the swimming pool of her California home when she slipped and fell on a piece of tile. She subsequently fell through a plate glass window. Reese&#x27;s daughter found a neighbor (who also happened to be a doctor) to help her contact paramedics. According to the &quot;Tucson Daily Citizen&quot;, Reese had &quot;severe body lacerations&quot; when she arrived at the UCLA Medical Center. The newspaper also reported that she underwent a three-hour surgery to repair the injury and remained in the hospital for nearly one month. &quot;[Doctors said] I was gonna die so many times, I may not die at all&quot;. Ultimately, she received one thousand stitches and made a full recovery with the help of physical therapy.

While singing &quot;Little Boy Lost&quot; on a taping of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; in October 1979, Reese suffered a brain aneurysm According to Reese, she was taken to two Los Angeles hospitals, which assumed she had a drug &quot;overdose&quot; because she was &quot;Black and an entertainer&quot;. Reese&#x27;s son was a psychiatrist sent for her physician who &quot;came immediately&quot; to prove there were no drugs in Reese&#x27;s system. A test officially revealed the aneurysm and Reese was sent to a brain surgeon at a London, Ontario hospital. The surgeon ultimately performed a five-hour surgery on Reese before she lost vision in her left eye. She ultimately made a full recovery and credited her spiritual faith in helping her recover.

===Friendships===

In addition to working alongside Redd Foxx on &quot;The Royal Family&quot;, the pair were also friends. &quot;We were hungry together. We were out of work together. We shared sandwiches together. We were friends,&quot; Reese remembered in an interview. Reese was also close friends with &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; co-star, Roma Downey. In an interview following Reese&#x27;s death, Downey said she &quot;was like a mother to me&quot;. Downey considered her a &quot;second mother&quot; and made Reese the godmother to her daughter who was born in 1996. Reese also officiated Downey&#x27;s wedding to Mark Burnett. Downey was quoted as saying, &quot;I think I&#x27;ll just always remember the feel of her neck against my cheek when she hugs me and the love I know that she has for me and the love that I feel for her and the love that she has for God. To know Della is to know that she loves God.

===Death===
Reese was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes after collapsing on the set of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. At first it was controlled by medication and Reese stated that she had cut back on what she was eating. In 2016, shortly after her 85th birthday, Reese was said to be in poor health, and had undergone multiple surgeries. She stated that she had neglected her health for years, which had contributed to the disease getting gradually worse over time. She was using a wheelchair at times on and off during the last ten years of her life. Reese died at her home in the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles on November 19, 2017, at the age of 86. Reese was honored with a memorial service in December 2017 that included Roma Downey.

<text>The is a Japanese superhero team media franchise consisting of television series and films produced by Toei Company and Bandai, and aired by TV Asahi. The shows are of the &quot;tokusatsu&quot; genre, featuring live action characters and colorful special effects, and are aimed at children, teens and young adults. &quot;Super Sentai&quot; airs alongside the &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; series in the Super Hero Time programming block on Sunday mornings. In North America, the &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series is best known as the source material for the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series.
==Series overview==

In every &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series, the protagonists are a team of people who – using either wrist-worn or hand-held devices – transform into superheroes and gain superpowers – color-coded uniforms, signature weapons, sidearms, and fighting skills – to battle a group of otherworldly supervillains that threaten to take over the Earth. In a typical episode, the heroes thwart the enemies&#x27; plans and defeat an army of enemy soldiers and the monster of the week before an enlarged version of the monster confronts them, only to be defeated once again when the heroes fight it with their super robot mecha. 
For a time Sentai series chose to set in themselves in their own unique fictional universes; however, beginning in the 1990&#x27;s, incarnations have retroactively made it so nearly every Sentai Series has occurred within the same Universe with rare exceptions, and modern series now maintain that nearly all Sentai series (as well as a majority ot Toei&#x27;s other Tokusatsu hero series) occur in the same setting, just with the other series not commonly referenced when unneeded to allow a running series to tell the story its creators wish to without the need to actively factor decades of continuity in. Beginning with &quot;J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai vs. Gorenger&quot;, Various TV, video, and film specials as well as in-canon storyline episodes feature a team-up among two or more teams, often clarifying and maintaining the now-commonplace inter-series continuity, which makes it difficult to dis-associate the greater franchise&#x27;s entries from each-other unless a specific entry detaches itself from the greater majority. The Sentai Series &quot;Zenkaiger&quot; Proposed that both a standalone and unified perspective of Sentai Continuity is simultaneously true; that there are worlds where just any sentai series occurs in a standalone format, as well as the main timeline Toei&#x27;s series are set in where they all collectively occur; generally seen as a way for Toei to acknowledge their own longstanding inconsistencies and continuity errors with regards to the writing of teamup events and the changing expectaitons of storytelling over time.

The first two &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series were created by Shotaro Ishinomori, then known for the 1971–1973 &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; TV series and the long-running manga &quot;Cyborg 009&quot;. He developed &quot;Himitsu Sentai Gorenger&quot;, which ran from 1975 to 1977, and &quot;J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai&quot;, released in 1977. Toei Company put the franchise on hiatus in 1978, collaborating with Marvel Comics to produce a live-action &quot;Spider-Man&quot; series, which added giant robots to the concept of &quot;tokusatsu&quot; shows. The giant robot concept was carried over to Toei and Marvel&#x27;s next show, &quot;Battle Fever J&quot;, released in 1979, and was then used throughout the Super Sentai series. The next two series Denshi Sentai Denjiman and Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan had Marvel copyrights and co-productions, despite no influence. Subsequently, the remainder of the series has been solely produced by Toei Company.

==Distribution and overseas adaptations==

Although the Super Sentai series originated in Japan, various Sentai series have been imported and dubbed in other languages for broadcast in several other countries.

===United States===
After Honolulu&#x27;s KIKU-TV had success with &quot;Android Kikaider&quot; (marketed as &quot;Kikaida&quot;) and &quot;Kamen Rider V3&quot; in the 1970s, multiple Super Sentai series, including &quot;Himitsu Sentai Gorenger&quot; and &quot;Battle Fever J&quot;, were brought to the Hawaiian market, broadcast in Japanese with English subtitles by JN Productions. In 1985, Marvel Comics produced a pilot for an American adaptation of Super Sentai, but the show was rejected by the major US TV networks. In 1986, Saban Productions produced a pilot for an American adaptation of &quot;Choudenshi Bioman&quot; titled &quot;Bio Man&quot;. In 1987, some episodes of &quot;Kagaku Sentai Dynaman&quot; were dubbed and aired as a parody on the USA Network television show &quot;Night Flight&quot;.

In 1993, American production company Saban Entertainment adapted 1992&#x27;s &quot;Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger&quot; into &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; for the Fox Kids programming block, combining the original Japanese action footage with new footage featuring American actors for the story sequences. Since then, nearly every &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series that followed became a new season of &quot;Power Rangers&quot;. In 2002, Saban sold the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise to Disney&#x27;s Buena Vista division, who owned it until 2010, broadcasting &quot;Power Rangers&quot; on ABC Kids, ABC Family, Jetix, and Toon Disney. On 12 May 2010, Saban bought the franchise back from Disney, moving the show to the Nickelodeon network for 2011 with &quot;Power Rangers Samurai&quot;.

On 25 July 2014, Shout! Factory announced that they would release &quot;Zyuranger&quot; on DVD in the United States. They have since been the official distributor of &quot;Super Sentai&quot; in North America, and as of 2024 have released all subsequent series up to &quot;Dekaranger&quot;, plus &quot;Jetman&quot; and &quot;Fiveman&quot;. Shout! also provides episodes on demand via Shout! TV since 2016. &quot;Super Sentai&quot; episodes are also available to watch on the free streaming service, Tubi.

On 1 May 2018, toy company Hasbro announced they had acquired the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise from Saban Capital Group for $522 million.

===South Korea===
Super Sentai has been broadcast in South Korea, dubbed in Korean. The first such series was &quot;Choushinsei Flashman&quot; which aired as &quot;Jigu Bangwidae Flash Man&quot; (&quot;Earth Defence Squadron Flashman&quot;), released in video format in 1989 by the Daeyung Panda video company; this was followed by &quot;Hikari Sentai Maskman&quot; and &quot;Chodenshi Bioman&quot;. Throughout the 1990s, &quot;Dai Sentai Goggle Five&quot;, &quot;Dengeki Sentai Changeman&quot;, &quot;Choujyu Sentai Liveman&quot;, and &quot;Kousoku Sentai Turboranger&quot; were also released in video format. In the 2000s and early 2010s, Tooniverse (formerly Orion Cartoon Network), JEI-TV (Jaeneung Television), Champ TV/Anione TV (Daewon Broadcasting), Cartoon Network South Korea, and Nickelodeon South Korea have broadcast Super Sentai series a year following their original Japanese broadcast, but have changed the titles to &quot;Power Rangers&quot;.

==Merchandise==
, Bandai Namco has sold &quot;Super Sentai&quot; shape-changing model robots since 1979.

<text>The Leuchter report is a pseudoscientific document authored by American execution technician Fred A. Leuchter, who was commissioned by Ernst Zündel to defend him at his trial in Canada for distributing Holocaust denial material. Leuchter compiled the report in 1988 with the intention of investigating the feasibility of mass homicidal gassings at Nazi extermination camps, specifically at Auschwitz. He traveled to the camp, collected multiple pieces of brick from the remains of the crematoria and gas chambers (without the camp&#x27;s permission), brought them back to the United States, and submitted them for chemical analysis. At the trial, Leuchter was called upon to defend the report in the capacity of an expert witness; however, during the trial, the court ruled that he had neither the qualifications nor experience to act as such.

Leuchter cited the absence of Prussian blue in the homicidal gas chambers to support his view that they could not have been used to gas people. However, residual iron-based cyanide compounds are not a categorical consequence of cyanide exposure. By not discriminating against that, Leuchter introduced an unreliable factor into his experiment, and his findings were seriously flawed as a result. In contrast, tests conducted by Polish forensic scientists (who discriminated against iron-based compounds) confirmed the presence of cyanide in the locations, in accordance with where and how it was used in the Holocaust. In addition, the report was criticized as Leuchter had overlooked critical evidence, such as documents in the SS architectural office which recorded the mechanical operation of the gas chambers and others which verified the rate at which the Nazis could burn the bodies of those gassed.

==Background==
In 1985, Ernst Zündel, a German pamphleteer and publisher living in Canada, was put on trial for publishing Richard Verrall&#x27;s Holocaust denial pamphlet &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot;, which was deemed to violate Canadian laws against distributing false news. Zündel was found guilty, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. This led to a second prosecution.

Zündel and his lawyers were joined by Robert Faurisson, a French academic of literature and Holocaust denier, who came to Toronto to advise the defense, having previously testified as expert witness at the first trial. He was joined by David Irving, an English writer and Holocaust denier, who was to assist the defense and testify on Zündel&#x27;s behalf. Faurisson claimed that it was technically and physically impossible for the gas chambers at Auschwitz to have functioned as extermination facilities, based on comparisons with American execution gas chambers; he therefore suggested getting an American prison warden who had participated in executions by gas to testify. Irving and Faurisson therefore invited Bill Armontrout, warden of the Missouri State Penitentiary, who agreed to testify and suggested they contact Fred A. Leuchter, a Bostonian execution equipment designer. Faurisson reported that Leuchter initially accepted the mainstream account of the Holocaust, but after two days of discussion with him, he stated that Leuchter was convinced that homicidal gassings never occurred. After having met Zündel in Toronto and agreeing to serve as an expert witness for his defense, Leuchter traveled with them to spend a week in Poland. He was accompanied by his draftsman, a cinematographer supplied by Zündel, a translator fluent in German and Polish, and his wife. Although Zündel and Faurisson did not accompany them, Leuchter said that they were with them &quot;every step of the way&quot; in spirit.

After arriving in Poland the group spent three days at the former Auschwitz concentration camp site, and another at the former Majdanek concentration camp. At these, they filmed Leuchter illicitly collecting what he regarded to be forensic quality samples of materialsfrom the wreckage of the former gas extermination facilities, while his wife and the translator acted as lookouts. Drawings of where the samples were taken from, the film footage of their physical collection and Leuchter&#x27;s notebook detailing the work were surrendered to the trial court as evidence. Leuchter claimed that his conclusions were based on his expert knowledge of gas chamber operation, his visual inspection of what remained of the structures at Auschwitz, and original drawings and blueprints of some of the facilities. He said that the blueprints had been given to him by Auschwitz Museum officials.

==Report==
The compiled report was published in Canada as &quot;The Leuchter Report: An Engineering Report on the Alleged Execution Gas Chambers at Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Majdanek, Poland&quot;, by Zündel&#x27;s Samisdat Publications, and in England as &quot;Auschwitz: The End of the Line. The Leuchter Report: The First Forensic Examination of Auschwitz&quot; by Focal Point Publications, David Irving&#x27;s publishing house. However, the court accepted the report only as evidentiary display and not as direct evidence; Leuchter was therefore required to explain it and testify to its veracity in the trial.

Before Leuchter could do this, he was examined by the court. He admitted that he was not a toxicologist and dismissed the need for having a degree in engineering:

Leuchter admitted under oath that he only had a Bachelor of Arts degree and implicitly suggested that an engineering degree was unavailable to him by saying that his college did not offer an engineering degree during his studies. Boston University actually offered three different kinds of such qualification when he was a student there. When asked by the court if the B.A. he obtained was in a field that entitled him to operate as an engineer, he confirmed that this was so, even though his degree was in history. Similarly, Leuchter claimed that he obtained most of his research material on the camps (including original crematoria blueprints) from the Auschwitz and Majdanek camps&#x27; archives, and testified that these documents had a far more important role in shaping his conclusions than the physical samples he collected, yet after the trial the director of the Auschwitz museum denied that Leuchter had received any plans or blueprints from them.

Judge Ronald Thomas began to label Leuchter&#x27;s methodology as &quot;ridiculous&quot; and &quot;preposterous&quot;, dismissing many of the report&#x27;s conclusions on the basis that they were based on &quot;second-hand information&quot;, and refused to allow him to testify on the effect of Zyklon B on humans because he had never worked with the substance, and was neither a toxicologist nor a chemist. Judge Thomas dismissed Leuchter&#x27;s opinion because it was of &quot;no greater value than that of an ordinary tourist&quot;, and in regards to Leuchter&#x27;s opinion said:

When questioned on the functioning of the crematoria, the judge also prevented Leuchter from testifying because &quot;he hasn&#x27;t any expertise&quot;. Leuchter also claimed that consultation relating to sodium cyanide and hydrogen cyanide with DuPont was &quot;an on-going thing&quot;. DuPont, the largest American manufacturer of hydrogen cyanide, stated that it had &quot;never provided any information on cyanides to persons representing themselves as Holocaust deniers, including Fred Leuchter&quot;, and had &quot;never provided any information regarding the use of cyanide at Auschwitz, Birkenau or Majdanek.&quot;

==Claims and criticism==
The contents of the report, in particular Leuchter&#x27;s methodology, are heavily criticized. James Roth, the manager of the lab that carried out the analysis on the samples Leuchter collected, swore under oath to the results at the trial. Roth did not learn what the trial was about until he got off the stand. He later stated that cyanide would have only penetrated to a depth of around 10 micrometers, a tenth of the thickness of a human hair. The samples of brick, mortar and concrete that Leuchter took were of indeterminate thickness: not being aware of this, the lab ground the samples to a fine powder which thus severely diluted the cyanide-containing layer of each sample with an indeterminate amount of brick, varying for each sample. A more accurate analysis would have been obtained by analyzing the surface of the samples Leuchter collected. Roth offered the analogy that the investigation was like analyzing paint on a wall by analyzing the timber behind it.

===Prussian blue===
Leuchter&#x27;s opposition to the possibility of homicidal gassings at Auschwitz relies on residual cyanide remains found in the homicidal gas chambers and delousing chambers at Auschwitz. While both facilities were exposed to the same substance (Zyklon B), many of the delousing chambers are stained with an iron-based compound known as Prussian blue, which is not apparent in the homicidal gas chambers. It is not only this disparity that Leuchter cites, but accordingly from his samples (which included measurements of it) that he claims he measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the gas chambers, which he argues is inconsistent between the amounts necessary to kill human beings and lice. This argument is often cited by Holocaust deniers, and similar claims are also made by Germar Rudolf.

According to Richard J. Green:

In other words, Green states that Leuchter failed to show that Prussian Blue would have been produced in the homicidal gas chambers in the first place—meaning its absence is not in itself proof that no homicidal gassings took place.
The problem with Prussian blue is that it is by no means a categorical sign of cyanide exposure. One factor necessary in its formation is a very high concentration of cyanide. In terms of the difference between amounts measured in the delousing chambers and homicidal gas chambers, critics explain that the exact opposite of what deniers claim is true. Insects have a far higher resistance to cyanide than humans, with concentration levels up to 16,000 ppm (parts per million) and an exposure time of more than 20 hours (sometimes as long as 72 hours) being necessary for them to succumb. In contrast, a cyanide concentration of only 300 ppm is fatal to humans in a matter of minutes. This difference is one of the reasons behind the concentration disparity. Another exceedingly sensitive factor by which very small deviances could determine whether Prussian blue may form is pH. pH could be affected by the presence of human beings. Also, while the delousing chambers were left intact, the ruins of the crematoria at Birkenau had been exposed to the elements for over forty years by the time Leuchter collected his samples. This would have severely affected his results, because unlike Prussian blue and other iron-based cyanides, cyanide salts are highly soluble in water.

Since the formation of Prussian blue is not an unconditional outcome of exposure to cyanide, it is not a reliable indicator. Leuchter and Rudolf claim to have measured much more cyanide in the delousing chambers than in the homicidal gas chambers, but since they did not discriminate against an unreliable factor, Green maintains that instant bias is introduced into their experiments. Similarly, Rudolf acknowledges that Prussian blue does not always form upon exposure to cyanide and is thus not a reliable marker, yet continues to include the iron compounds in his analysis. Green describe this as &quot;disingenuous&quot;. Since a building that contains Prussian blue staining would exhibit much higher levels of detectable cyanides than one without any, Green writes that Leuchter&#x27;s and Rudolf&#x27;s measurements reveal nothing more than what is already visible to the naked eye.

====Polish follow-up investigation====
In February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, director of The Institute for Forensic Research (IFRC) in Kraków conducted an experiment where iron compounds were excluded. Given that the ruins of the gas chambers at Birkenau have been exposed to a cumulative 35 meters of precipitation based on climatological records since 1945, Markiewicz and his team were not optimistic at being able to detect cyanides so many years later; nevertheless, having the legal permission to obtain samples, they collected some from areas as sheltered from the elements as possible.

Leuchter&#x27;s report stated that the small amounts of cyanide he detected in the ruins of the crematoria are merely the result of fumigation. However the IFRC points out that the control samples they took from living areas which may have been fumigated only once as part of the 1942 typhus epidemic tested negative for cyanide, and that the typhus epidemic occurred before the crematoria at Birkenau even existed.
Accordingly, the IFRC demonstrated that cyanides were present in all of the facilities where it is claimed that they were exposed, i.e. all five crematoria, the cellars of Block 11 and the delousing facilities. Critics state that any attempt to demonstrate that the crematoria could not have functioned as homicidal gas chambers on the basis that they were not exposed to cyanide is unsuccessful, given that its presence in what remains of these facilities is incontrovertible, and write that all of the gas chambers were exposed to cyanide at levels higher than background levels elsewhere in the camp, such as living areas, where no cyanides at all were detected. In addition, tests conducted at Auschwitz in 1945 revealed the presence of cyanides on ventilation grilles found in the ruins of Crematorium II (thus also demonstrating that the Leuchter report was not the first forensic examination of the camp as purported in the title of the London edition). The historian Richard J. Evans argued that due to Leuchter&#x27;s ignorance of the large disparity between the amounts of cyanide necessary to kill humans and lice, instead of disproving the homicidal use of gas chambers, the small amounts of cyanide which Leuchter detected actually tended to confirm it.

===Other criticisms===
By order of Heinrich Himmler, the crematoria and gas chambers at Birkenau were destroyed by the SS in order to hide evidence of genocide. Nothing more than the bases of Crematoria IV and V can be seen: the floor plans of both facilities are indicated by bricks laid out across the concrete foundations, and Crematoria II and III are in ruins. Professor Robert Jan van Pelt labels Leuchter&#x27;s comment that the facilities have not changed at all since 1942 or 1941 as &quot;nonsense&quot;.

====Zyklon B====
Because hydrogen cyanide is explosive, Leuchter maintained that the gas chambers could never have been operated due to their proximity to the ovens of the crematoria. It is correct that hydrogen cyanide is explosive, but only at concentrations of 56,000 ppm and above – over 186 times more than the lethal dose of 300 ppm. Critics estimate conservatively that within 5 to 15 minutes, gas chamber victims were exposed to 450 – 1810 ppmv – again considerably lower than the lower explosion limit.

====Gas chamber ventilation====
Leuchter incorrectly assumed that the gas chambers were not ventilated. The basement gas chambers of Crematoria II and III were mechanically ventilated via motors in the roof space of the main crematorium structure capable of extracting the remaining gas and renewing the air every three to four minutes.

When ventilation was not used such as in Crematoria IV and V (although a ventilation system was later installed in Crematorium V in May 1944), Sonderkommando prisoners wore gas masks when removing the bodies. When presented in court with a document by the chief Auschwitz architect SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Karl Bischoff, Leuchter misconstrued aeration (&quot;Belüftung&quot;) and ventilation (&quot;Entlüftung&quot;) as part of the furnace blower systems, when they were actually in reference to the ventilation channels in the walls that straddle the gas chambers. These are visible on blueprints, and can still partly be seen in the ruined east wall of the Crematorium III gas chamber.

====Body disposal====
Leuchter was also prepared to act as expert witness regarding crematoria ovens despite admitting during cross examination that he had no expert knowledge. Leuchter presented his own estimate of 156 corpses as the total daily incineration capacity of the installations at Auschwitz. During cross-examination, he was presented with a letter written by the Auschwitz Central Construction Office (&quot;Auschwitz Zentralbauleitung&quot;) of June 28, 1943, from SS-&quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Jahrling to SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Hans Kammler stating that the five crematoria installations had a collective daily capacity of 4,756 corpses. Leuchter conceded that this was quite different from his own figure, and that he had never seen the document in question before.

A patent application by the makers of the ovens, (both of which were made during the war) and two independent testimonies confirmed the capacity of the crematoria. The 4,756 figure is evidence of the Nazis equipping a camp of a maximum of 125,000 prisoners with the facility to cremate 140,000 of them per month. Critics of Leuchter explain that this reveals extermination was the true purpose of Auschwitz: a camp with the capacity to reduce its entire population to ash on a monthly basis was not merely a benign internment camp.

At various times (such as in the summer of 1944 when the crematoria couldn&#x27;t keep up with the extermination rate), bodies were burnt in open-air pits. Accordingly, the capacity of the crematoria was never a limiting factor, and the pits yielded practically no limit to the number of corpses that could be burnt.

<text>Borsippa (Sumerian: BAD.SI.(A).AB.BAKI or Birs Nimrud, having been identified with Nimrod) is an archeological site in Babylon Governorate, Iraq, built on both sides of a lake about southwest of Babylon on the east bank of the Euphrates. It lies 15 kilometers from the ancient site of Dilbat. 

It is today one of the most vividly identifiable surviving ziggurats, identified in the later Arabic culture with the Tower of Babel due to King Nebuchadnezzar referring to it as the &quot;Tower of Borsippa&quot; or &quot;tongue tower&quot;, as stated in the stele recovered on site in the 19th century. However, modern scholarship concludes that the Babylonian builders of the ziggurat erected it as a religious edifice in honour of the local god Nabu, called the &quot;son&quot; of Babylon&#x27;s Marduk, as would be appropriate for Babylon&#x27;s lesser sister-city.

The tutelary god of Borsippa in the Ur III Empire in the late 3rd millennium BC was Tutu, who was syncretised with the god Marduk after the Old Babylonian period. Tutu was mentioned in the prologue of the Code of Hammurabi as the god of Borsippa. The goddesses Marat-E-zida and the god Mar-biti were also worshiped at Borsippa.

==History==
In the late 3rd millennium BC a great revolt arose against Naram-Sin ruler of the Akkadian Empire. One of the rebelling cities mentioned in his inscriptions was BAR.KI which some researchers have taken as Borsippa, though this has been challenged. If it was Borsippa, then Ilum-dan was governor (ENSI) of the city at that time and Dannum was the &quot;captain&quot; (NU.BANDA).

During the reign of Ur III ruler Ibbi-Sin (c. 2028–2004 BC) it is known that the governor of Borsippa (and nearby Babylon) was Puzur-Tutu. These are the closing years of the Ur III empire. A text from the ruler of Kazallu states that Puzur-Tutu changed sides at the end and supported Išbi-Erra (c. 2017—1986 BC) ruler of Isin. An alternative reading of that text makes Puzur-Tutu governor of Bad-Ziabba, which may or may not be Borsippa, and has Išbi-Erra returning his city to Puzur-Tutu after his victory.

In the Old Babylonian period, Borsippa is known from year names of rulers of Babylon Sumu-la-El (c. 1880-1845 BC) &quot;Year in which Sumulael entered Borsippa&quot; and Apil-Sin (c. 1830–1813 BC) &quot;Year Apil-Sin the king built the city wall of Borsippa&quot;. Borsippa was mentioned in the prologue of the Code of Hammurabi &quot;... beloved of Tutu, the one who makes exult Borsippa, the pious one who does not fail in his duties to the Ezida temple ...&quot;. A later inscription of Hammurabi (c. 1792–1750 BC) dedicates Ezida to Marduk, the god of Babylon, showing Tutu, the tutelary god of Borsippa, being absorbed by Marduk. Ezida later became home of Nabu, son of Marduk.

In the Kassite period,  Marduk-apla-iddina I (c. 1171–1159 BC), one of the last rulers of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon, rebuilt the E-Zida temple at Borsippa. Marduk-shapik-zeri (c. 1077–1065 BC), a ruler of the 2nd dynasty of Babylon, restored the E-Zida temple.

Borsippa is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Shabbat&quot; 36a, &quot;Avodah Zarah&quot; 11b) and other rabbinic literature. Borsippa was dependent upon Babylon and was never the seat of a regional power. From the ninth century BC, Borsippa was on the borderland south of which lay the tribal &quot;houses&quot; of Chaldea.

The Jewish historian, Josephus, mentions the city in relation to the war between Cyrus the Great and Nabonidus. The temple to Nabu at Borsippa was destroyed in 484 BC during the suppression of a revolt against the Achaemenid emperor, Xerxes I.

In the 1st millennium BC, the city had a large scribal class.

==Archaeology==

In 1854, work at Borsippa was conducted under the direction of Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, with most of the actual digging done by his subordinates. Rawlinson personally uncovered the foundation prisms from Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s restoration on the Nabu temple. Between 1879 and 1881 the site was excavated by Hormuzd Rassam for the British Museum.
He concentrated primarily on E-zida, the temple of Nabu. In the 1890s looters removed about 2000 cuneiform tablets, mostly from the Ezida. In 1902, Robert Koldewey worked at Borsippa during his main effort at Babylon also mainly on the Nabu temple. E-DIM-AN-NA, temple of the bond of heaven, built by Nebuchadrezzar for the god Sin in the court of E-zida was also excavated.

Between 1980 and 2003, the Austrian team from the Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck led by Helga Piesl-Trenkwalder and Wilfred Allinger-Csollich excavated for sixteen seasons at the site. Early work concentrated on the large ziggurat E-ur-imin-an-ki and later on the Nabu temple. Examinination determined that the ziggurat had a 60 by 60 meter core of unbaked brinks with a mantle of baked bricks (or Kassite and Neo-Babylonian origin) bringing the structure up to 78 by 78 meters. The mantle was covered by a layer of baked bricks bonded by bitumen. Reeds, ropes, and wooden beams were used to bond the layers together. It was found that the ziggurat had been partially hollowed out in Parthian times. Tablets of the Neo-Babylonian period were found.

Many legal administrative and astronomical texts on cuneiform tablets have originated at Borsippa and have turned up on the black market with the first large, around 2000, group of tablets being sold to the British Museum in 1894-1900. Archives began to be published in the 1980s. An inscription of Nebuchadnezzar II, the &quot;Borsippa inscription,&quot; tells how he restored the temple of Nabu, &quot;the temple of the seven spheres,&quot; with &quot;bricks of noble lapis lazuli.&quot; that must have been covered with a rich blue glaze. The Austrian archeologists have determined that Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s ziggurat encased the ruins of a smaller tower from the second millennium BC. When it was completed it reached a height of 70 meters, in seven terraces; even in ruin it still stands a striking 52 meters over the perfectly flat plain. An inscribed foundation stone has been recovered, which details Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s plan to have the Borsippa ziggurat built on the same design as that at Babylon, of which only the foundation survives. Nebuchadnezzar declared that Nabu&#x27;s tower would reach the skies, another inscription states. The reconstruction under the patronage of Bel-Marduk is summarized on a cylinder in Akkadian of Antiochus I, an example of the region&#x27;s remarkable cultural continuity.

In 2022 a test ground penetrating radar test was conducted over a 130 meter by 90 meter section at the site.

Since 2023, after a 20-year break in excavations, the Austrian archaeological team led by Sandra Heinsch and Walter Kuntner has resumed investigations in the ancient city of Borsippa. In addition to examining the ziggurat and the adjacent Ezida Temple to research the multi-period temple architecture, the excavations also focus on the extensive urban area to shed light on the cityscape of ancient Borsippa.

The adjacent area of Tell Ibrahim al-Khalil holds the city&#x27;s residential quarter.

<doc id="634135" wikidata="Q1217629" url="?curid=634135" title="The Cloud of Unknowing">
<text>The Cloud of Unknowing (Middle English: &quot;The Cloude of Unknowyng&quot;) is an anonymous work of Christian mysticism written in Middle English in the latter half of the 14th century. The text is a spiritual guide on contemplative prayer. The underlying message of this work suggests that the way to know God is to abandon consideration of God&#x27;s particular activities and attributes, and be courageous enough to surrender one&#x27;s mind and ego to the realm of &quot;unknowing&quot;, at which point one may begin to glimpse the nature of God.

==History==
&quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; draws on the mystical tradition of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Christian Neoplatonism, which focuses on the via negativa road to discovering God as a pure entity, beyond any capacity of mental conception and so without any definitive image or form. This tradition has reputedly inspired generations of mystics, from John Scotus Eriugena, Nicholas of Cusa, and John of the Cross. Prior to this, the theme of a passing cloud of ignorance (as opposed to the heavenly and eternal truth of God beyond the cloud) had appeared briefly in the &quot;Confessions&quot; of Saint Augustine (XIII, XV, 17–18) written around 398 AD. Concerning the placement of &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; in the trends of the Catholic Church at the approximate time of its writing, the work joins a broader medieval movement within Christianity toward a religious experience of a more individual and passionate view of relationship with God.

The author is unknown. The English Augustinian mystic Walter Hilton has at times been suggested, but this is generally doubted. It is possible the author was a Carthusian priest, though this is not certain.

A second major work by the same author, &quot;The Book of Privy Counseling&quot; (originally titled &quot;Prive Counselling&quot;), continues the themes discussed in the &quot;Cloud&quot;. It is less than half the length of the &quot;Cloud&quot;, appears to be the author&#x27;s final work, and clarifies and deepens some of its teachings. In this work, the author characterizes the practice of contemplative unknowing as worshiping God with one&#x27;s &quot;substance,&quot; coming to rest in a &quot;naked blind feeling of being,&quot; and ultimately finding thereby that God is one&#x27;s being. Experience, in keeping with the mystical tradition, is considered the ultimate means by which a Christian can and should relate to God, and the practice of contemplation in &quot;The Cloud&quot; is thus focused on the experience of God by the contemplative. This relationship between God and the contemplative takes place within continual conflict between the spirit and the physical. God is spirit in the purest sense; therefore, no matter how intense one&#x27;s desire or how fervent one&#x27;s love, the movement toward God by body-bound contemplatives will ever be halted by the cloud of unknowing that hides God from our understanding and prevents the fullest and truest experience of God&#x27;s being. The object of the contemplative experience is to know God, as much as possible, from within this cloud of unknowing.

==Contents==
&quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; is written specifically to a student, and the author strongly commands the student in the Prologue, &quot;do not willingly and deliberately read it, copy it, speak of it, or allow it to be read, copied, or spoken of, by anyone or to anyone, except by or to a person who, in your opinion, has undertaken truly and without reservation to be a perfect follower of Christ.&quot;

The book counsels the young student to seek God, not through knowledge and intellect (faculty of the human mind), but through intense contemplation, motivated by love, and stripped of all thought. Experience of a &quot;cloud of unknowing&quot; is introduced Chapter 3:

This is brought about by putting all thoughts and desires under a &quot;cloud of forgetting,&quot; and thereby piercing God&#x27;s cloud of unknowing with a &quot;dart of longing love&quot; from the heart. This form of contemplation is not directed by the intellect, but involves spiritual union with God through the heart:
As one pursues the beating of the cloud of unknowing as compelled by spiritual stirrings of love in the heart, the intellect and sinful stirrings will often pull the contemplative&#x27;s focus away from God and back to the things of physical world and of the self. The author thus enjoins the contemplative to &quot;vigorously trample on [any new thoughts or sinful stirrings] with a fervent stirring of love, and tread them down beneath your feet. And try to cover them with a thick cloud of forgetting, as if they had never been done by you or anyone else on earth. [...] Push them down as often as they rise.&quot;

The author draws a strong distinction in Chapters 16-22 between the active and contemplative Christian life. He illustrates the distinction by drawing heavily from the account of Mary and Martha in the Gospel of Luke, writing that &quot;[By] Mary all contemplatives are understood, so that they should model their way of life on hers; and similarly by Martha, all actives, with the same consequent resemblance.&quot; While the author holds Mary as the superior example in the passage as a &quot;model for all of us [who seek to be contemplatives],&quot; he clarifies that Martha&#x27;s activity in service to God was nonetheless &quot;good and beneficial for her salvation&quot; but not the best thing.

Chapter 23 of &quot;The Book of Privy Counseling&quot; glorifies experience over knowledge:

Chapters 39 and 40 recommend the focus on a single word as the means to invoke the fullness of God:
While the author presents many methods of his own for effective contemplation of God, he often leaves the teaching of method to God himself. In Chapter 40, for example, he advises a contemplative who is struggling with sin to &quot;[...] feel sin as a lump, you do not know what, but nothing other than yourself. And then shout continuously in spirit, &#x27;Sin, sin, sin! out, out, out!&#x27; This spiritual shout is better learned from God by experience than from any human being by word.&quot;

While the practice of contemplation in &quot;The Cloud&quot; is focused upon the experience of spiritual reality by the soul, the author also makes some provision for the needs of the body, going so far as to say that care for the body is an important element of spiritual contemplation if only to prevent hindrance of its practice. He writes in Chapter 41:

==Other works by the same author==
In addition to &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; and &quot;The Book of Privy Counseling&quot;, the &quot;Cloud&quot; author is believed to be responsible for a few other spiritual treatises and translations, including:

* &quot;Deonise Hid Divinity&quot;, a free translation of the &quot;Mystical Theology&quot; by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. A vernacular translation of the &quot;Mystical Theology&quot; was unprecedented; however, it was clearly not widely read, since only two manuscripts survive.
* &quot;A Letter of Prayer&quot; (&quot;A Pistle of Prayer&quot;), which survives in seven manuscripts. (Online);
* &quot;A Letter of Discretion of Stirrings&quot; (&quot;A Pistle of Discrecioun of Stirings&quot;). (Online, part VI of &quot;The Cell of Self Knowledge&quot;)
* It is possible, but doubtful, that he wrote &quot;A Treatise of Discernment of Spirits&quot; (originally titled &quot;A Tretis of Discrecyon of Spirites&quot;), a free translation of &quot;Sermones di Diversis&quot; nos 23–24, by Bernard of Clairvaux, (Online).
* It is possible, but doubtful, that he wrote &quot;A Treatise of the Study of Wisdom that Men Call Benjamin&quot; (also called &quot;Pursuit of Wisdom&quot;, and, in its original, &quot;A Tretyse of the Stodye of Wysdome that Men Clepen Beniamyn&quot;), an abbreviated and free translation of the &quot;Benjamin Minor&quot; by Richard of Saint Victor (Online).

==Manuscripts==

&quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; has 17 known manuscripts. The two best known are British Library Harley MS 2373 and Cambridge University Library Kk.vi.26. These contain all seven of the works attributed to the &quot;Cloud&quot; author, the former extensively glossed in Latin. Another important manuscript is British Library Harleian 2373, which contains all but &quot;Deonise Hid Divinity&quot;.

==Later influence==
Given its survival in only seventeen manuscripts, &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; was not as popular in late medieval England as the works of Richard Rolle or Walter Hilton, perhaps because the &quot;Cloud&quot; is addressed to solitaries and concentrates on the advanced levels of the mystical path. Two Latin translations of the &quot;Cloud&quot; were made in the late fifteenth century. One was made by Richard Methley, a Carthusian of the Charterhouse of Mount Grace in Yorkshire, and finished in 1491. The other is anonymous. Neither, however, enjoyed wide dissemination.

This work became known to English Catholics in the mid-17th century, when the Benedictine monk Augustine Baker (1575–1641) wrote an exposition on its doctrine based on a manuscript copy in the library of the monastery of Cambrai in Flanders. The original work itself, however, was not published until 1877. English mystic Evelyn Underhill edited an important version of the work in 1922.

The work has become increasingly popular over the course of the twentieth century, with nine English translations or modernisations produced in this period. In particular, &quot;The Cloud&quot; has influenced recent contemplative prayer practices. The practical prayer advice contained in &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; forms a primary basis for the contemporary practice of Centering Prayer, a form of Christian meditation developed by Trappist monks William Meninger, Basil Pennington and Thomas Keating in the 1970s. It also informed the meditation techniques of the English Benedictine John Main.

The contemplation method urged in &quot;The Cloud&quot; is similar to Buddhist meditation and modern transcendental meditation. For example, the last paragraph of chapter 7 says: If you want to gather all your desire into one simple word that the mind can easily retain, choose a short word rather than a long one. A one-syllable word such as &quot;God&quot; or &quot;love&quot; is best. But choose one that is meaningful to you. Then fix it in your mind so that it will remain there come what may. This word will be your defence in conflict and in peace. Use it to beat upon the cloud of darkness above you and to subdue all distractions, consigning them to the &quot;cloud of forgetting&quot; beneath you.

<doc id="634137" wikidata="Q3083207" url="?curid=634137" title="La nouvelle manga">
<text>Nouvelle Manga () is an artistic movement which gathers French and Japanese comic creators together. The expression was first used by Kiyoshi Kusumi, editor of the Japanese manga magazine &quot;Comickers&quot;, in referring to the work of French expatriate Frédéric Boilet, who lived in Japan for much of his career but has since returned to France in December 2008. Boilet adopted the term for himself and encouraged other artists to participate.

==History==
The Nouvelle Manga movement was born of several observations. Whereas European cinema often bases its theme on everyday life, French/Belgian &quot;bande dessinée&quot; has, for a long time, been restricted to stereotyped genres such as science fiction or westerns. Japanese authors on the other hand exploit daily life extensively – but these are often the least likely to be widely translated.

For the participants of Nouvelle Manga there are bridges to build between the comics of all nationalities, not least between the comics &quot;d&#x27;auteur&quot; in each country.

People often restrict Nouvelle Manga to the world of alternative comics, yet there are many examples of Nouvelle Manga authors publishing in all kinds of arenas. For instance, Boilet himself has been published in mainstream Seinen magazines like &quot;Big Comics&quot; in Japan as well as in alternative editorial structures such as &quot;Spore&quot; in Japan, Ego Comme X in France and, more recently, Fanfare / Ponent Mon in the US. 

Boilet prefers to refer to Nouvelle Manga as being in the French feminine form (&quot;la&quot;) as opposed to the French masculine form (&quot;le&quot;) which is used for the very mainstream action-oriented manga that is more usually published in France.

Examples of artists who are associated in varying degrees with the outputs and debates surrounding Nouvelle Manga are:
Moyoko Anno, Aurélia Aurita, David B., Matthieu Blanchin, Frédéric Boilet, Nicolas de Crécy, Étienne Davodeau, Yoji Fukuyama, Emmanuel Guibert, Kazuichi Hanawa, Daisuke Igarashi, Little Fish, Taiyō Matsumoto, Fabrice Neaud, Loïc Néhou, Benoît Peeters, Frédéric Poincelet, David Prudhomme, François Schuiten, Joann Sfar, Kiriko Nananan, Hideji Oda, Kan Takahama, Jiro Taniguchi, Yoshiharu Tsuge, Vanyda and Naito Yamada.

A great exhibition and a cycle of debates were held in Tokyo in September and October 2001, notably at the Tokyo Museum of Fine Arts and at the French-Japanese Institute.

Nouvelle Manga has extended to other media with Nouvelle Manga Digitale, a creation of the multimedia author Fred Boot.

<doc id="634139" wikidata="Q2355340" url="?curid=634139" title="Voluntary childlessness">
<text>Voluntary childlessness or childfreeness is the voluntary choice not to have children. Use of the word &quot;childfree&quot; was first recorded in 1901 and entered common usage among feminists during the 1970s. The suffix -&quot;free&quot; refers to the freedom and personal choice of those to pick this lifestyle. The meaning of the term &quot;childfree&quot; extends to encompass the children of others (in addition to one&#x27;s own children), and this distinguishes it further from the more usual term &quot;childless&quot;, which is traditionally used to express the idea of having no children, whether by choice or by circumstance. In the research literature, the term &quot;child-free&quot; or &quot;childfree&quot; has also been used to refer to parents not living with their children, for example because they have already grown up and moved out. In common usage, &quot;childfree&quot; might be used in the context of venues or activities wherein (young) children are excluded even if the people involved may be parents, such as a childfree flight or a childfree restaurant.

In most societies and for most of human history, choosing not to have children was both difficult and socially undesirable, except for celibate individuals. The availability of reliable birth control (which has severed the link between sexuality and reproduction), more opportunities for financial security (especially for women), better healthcare (which has extended human life expectancy), and the ability to rely on one&#x27;s own savings have made childlessness a viable option, even if this choice might still be frowned upon by society at large. Nevertheless, in some modern societies, being childfree has become not just more tolerated but also more common. In fact, various attempts by governments around the world to incentivize couples to have a child or to have more children have all failed, indicating that this is not a matter of economics but a cultural shift. In societies where children are seldom born out of wedlock, childfree individuals are likely to remain single as well.

==Reasons cited for being voluntarily childless==
Supporters of this lifestyle cite various reasons for their view. These reasons can be personal, social, philosophical, moral, economic, or a complex, nuanced combination of such reasons.
One such reason could be abuse by the hands of their own parents for some individuals. As such, they have little interest in parenthood, or the duplication of their family&#x27;s genes. They may also fear the continuation of the cycle of abuse or other defects in their styles of parenting. Indeed, fear is in general a major motivation for voluntary childlessness, and some are also concerned with disabilities, rendering childcare even more challenging; or that the children might grow up to be immoral people. However, childfree individuals are unlikely to have the fear of missing out on the alleged benefits of parenthood because there are parents who regret having children, leaving the childfree to deem the decision to &quot;just try&quot; to have children irresponsible. And parents can become less empathetic towards non-family members. Some people simply do not feel the &quot;biological clock&quot; ticking and have no parental drives. On the other hand, some meet the right partners at too advanced an age to safely bear children. Among some women, there is a fear or revulsion towards the physical condition of pregnancy (tokophobia), and the childbirth experience. Some are worried that an existing (and strained) romantic relationship or marriage might be damaged (beyond repair) with the arrival of children, and this could be the case if one partner does not want children. Among women, the mental health of those of reproductive years declines among mothers relative to those with no children, whose psychological well-being remains more or less stable during this period. In general, couples experience a drop in the level of happiness after having a baby, though the level depends on a variety of factors, including sex, age, and nationality.

For some, it is sufficient to spend time with their nephews, nieces or stepchildren, school children, or to provide childcare and babysitting services as part of an extended family or godparent, and to nourish existing friendships, which might falter if they were to become parents. Some are also taking care of elderly parents. Some childfree individuals consider themselves to be already working for the benefit of the next generation or of humanity as a whole by making charitable donations, or working as schoolteachers or pediatricians. In addition, one&#x27;s partner might already have children from a previous relationship and is unable or unwilling to have more. On the other hand, some people simply dislike children&#x27;s behavior, vulgar language, or biological processes.

Medical concerns constitute an entire class of reasons why some people do not want to have children. Some people carry genetic disorders, are mentally ill, or are otherwise too sick for parenthood, and children are vectors of numerous infectious diseases. But even among healthy couples, new parents are often sleep deprived. Pregnancy and childbirth might come with complications for the woman&#x27;s body and lasting effects on her health, including, but not limited to, weight gain, hemorrhoids, urinary incontinence, accelerated cellular aging, and even death. Substantial neurological changes during and following pregnancy could lead to sentiments of insecurity and inadequacy, postpartum depression, something men might also face. This information is traditionally not provided to parents in advance to avoid frightening them. In an agrarian society, children are a source of labor and thus income for the family. But as society shifts towards industries other than agriculture and as more people relocate to the cities, children become a net sink of parental resources. For this reason, people tend to have fewer children, or none at all. This change is known as the first demographic transition. The second demographic transition occurs when the cultural attitude towards children changes. In particular, this is when society shifts from traditional and communal values towards individualism, whereupon support for traditional gender roles declines and fewer people believe that they need to have children in order to be complete, successful, or happy. Whereas in the past, a woman typically had to get married and bear children in order to ensure her own survival, in a modern society, people—including women—have more choices, and they are increasingly aware that reproduction is an option, and not an obligation. Consequently, people who choose to have children tend to have fewer of them, and an increasing number prefer to be childfree. Moreover, contemporary young people, especially women, tend to be more ambitious and career-minded than their counterparts in the past, and for them, children count as a distraction, an unwanted expenditure, or an undesirable commitment. Childfree people could take advantage of other opportunities in life, such as pursuing a career, retiring early, making charitable donations, having more leisure, and being more active in the community. Some find themselves exhausted with work and are therefore in no position to be parents. Furthermore, the cost of raising a child tends to be quite high as a society industrializes and urbanizes. Simply reviewing the full financial expense of having a child can shift a person&#x27;s opinion on whether or not he or she should have one. But the cost of raising a child is, for most, not as important as the desire for personal growth and fulfillment. As parenthood loses its appeal, pets gain in popularity, at least among those who wish to have something or someone to care for. In South Korea, young couples of the 2010s are more likely to have pets, which are cheaper than children. In the English language, the phrase &quot;fur baby&quot; was first introduced in the 1990s and steadily became more commonplace afterwards as Millennials came of age. In the West, members of the countercultural or feminist movements in the 1960s and 1970s typically had no children. They disapproved of how women were treated differently from men. Some activists recall how their own mothers were treated when they were young. Among some activists, the traditional family is viewed &quot;a decadent, energy-absorbing, destructive, wasteful institution.&quot; Similarly, in China, a socially conservative and patriarchal country, women have become much less interested in marriage and children, viewing these as burdens.

The next group of reasons why people prefer to not have children is economic in nature. Childfree people reject the claim that their national economies are at risk just because they have no children. For many, existing burdens of taxes and debts are already great, and yet they are facing stagnant or falling wages and a high cost of living. But even among those who are not facing dire financial circumstances, not having a child means more savings and possibly early retirement. They realize that having children is not a guaranteed safety net for parent-child relations might be strained. For women, the lack of adequate support for working mothers is a major concern. But even in countries with generous programs to support couples with young children, such as Hungary or Norway, many women are still uninterested in having (more) children, due to concerns with their quality of life.

Some people face general existential angst due to the state of the world (pestilence, war, famine, economic recession, the breakdown of civilization, among other issues) or the politics of their countries, and therefore question whether having children really is such a positive contribution. The human population has grown significantly since the start of the Industrial Revolution, leading many to believe that overpopulation has become a serious problem and some to question the fairness of what in their view amounts to subsidies for having children—such as tax credits for parents (such as the Earned Income Tax Credit in the United States), paid parental leave, and public education—as well as social welfare programs that require more people to be born to ensure said programs can be funded by taxes. To this end, concerns over the impact of human activities on the environment—overpopulation, climate change, pollution, resource scarcity, and the ongoing Holocene Extinction—are a major reason behind voluntary childlessness.

Having fewer children or no children at all drastically reduces one&#x27;s carbon emissions compared to, for instance, owning a car with improved fuel efficiency, replacing incandescent light bulbs with more energy-efficient models (such as LEDs), or avoiding air travel. A subset of environmentalists opposes anthropocentrism and supports deep ecology, or putting non-human lives first. Some even call for the gradual and voluntary extinction of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, viewing it as not entirely a tragedy but rather an act of empathy and nobility. In their opinion, human existence inflicts harm not just upon humans themselves but also other species via predatory practices.

But these (misanthropic) perspectives are not unique to environmentalists. A school of philosophy known as antinatalism asserts that it is inherently immoral to bring people into the world. Antinatalists argue in favor of the asymmetry of pleasure and pain, viewing the absence of pleasure as neutral whereas the absence of pain is positive. For them, refraining from reproduction can be thought of as a form of compassion for the unborn. Moreover, since parents can never secure the consent of their unborn child, the decision to procreate would be an imposition of life, a source of suffering, and a form of narcissism. However, some childfree people explicitly reject antinatalism; they may even like the children of others, but just do not want any themselves.

Modern societies often have high expectations of parents, which some people consider distasteful. In English, the (pejorative) term &quot;soccer mom&quot; is used to described women obsessed with being mothers. In general, as a society becomes better developed, it is generally true that parental investment per child goes up, causing fertility rates to go down. In countries where having children out of wedlock is either highly unusual or socially ostracized, such as China, having trouble getting married is a reason why most choose to not have children.

Proponents of childfreeness posit that choosing &quot;not&quot; to have children is no more or less selfish than choosing to have children. Choosing to have children may be the more selfish choice, especially when poor parenting risks creating many long-term problems for both the children themselves and society at large. As philosopher David Benatar explains, at the heart of the decision to bring a child into the world often lies the parents&#x27; own desires (to enjoy child-rearing or perpetuate one&#x27;s legacy or genes), rather than the potential person&#x27;s interests. At the very least, Benatar believes this illustrates why a childfree person may be just as altruistic as any parent. They will also have more time to focus on themselves, which will allow for greater creativity and the exploration of personal ambitions. In this way, they may benefit themselves and society more than if they had a child, and describe the joys and freedoms of childfree living, freedoms such as travel previously associated with males in Western culture.

But simply not wanting children is the most important reason for many. Compared to the 1970s, social attitudes towards voluntary childlessness have been slowly changing from condemnation and hostility to greater acceptance by the 2010s.
==Challenges to and criticisms of remaining childfree==
Childfree people face not only social discrimination but political discrimination as well. Most societies place a high value on parenthood in adult life, so that people who remain childfree are sometimes stereotyped as selfish, self-absorbed, or unwilling to take on responsibility. As Rebecca Solnit explains in her book &quot;The Mother of All Questions&quot; (2017), &quot;The problem may be a literary one: we are given a single story line about what makes a good life, even though not a few who follow that story line have bad lives. We speak as though there is one good plot with one happy outcome, while the myriad forms a life can take flower—and wither—all around us.&quot; 

Some are deemed too career-focused, although this is not necessarily true. In line with policies of family-friendliness, governments and employers typically offer support for parents, even though people without children might have to care for invalid, disabled, or elderly dependents, commitments that entail significant financial and emotional costs. The &quot;life&quot; aspect of the work-life balance is often taken to mean parenting. Non-parents, including the childfree, are thus assumed to be career-focused and willing to work extra time, which is not necessarily the case. What they do with their free time is not considered as important. As such, childless individuals often work longer hours than parents. In fact, both parents and non-parents tend to think that parents are generally treated better at work. Some parents argue that they deserve special treatment for raising future workers and taxpayers. During the summer, requests for vacation leave from parents are typically approved quickly while the childfree are generally expected to stay behind to cover the workload. To alleviate friction and to maintain goodwill, some employers have offered everyone paid leave at the same time. More broadly, some human-resources departments and managers have introduced paid time off (PTO) to replace the traditional paid family leave, paid sick leave, or paid vacation leave.

It is traditionally held that womanhood must include motherhood and caregiving. Even today, these responsibilities fall largely on women. Historically, it has been a social taboo to discuss the negative aspects of pregnancy and childbirth, or to express regret for having had children, making it more challenging for the childfree to defend their decision. A number of religions—notably Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—place a high value on children and their central place in marriage. There are, however, some debates within religious groups about whether a childfree lifestyle is acceptable. Another view, for example, is that the biblical verse &quot;&quot; in Genesis 1:28, is really not a command but an expression of blessing. Alternatively, some Christians believe that Genesis 1:28 is a moral command but nonetheless believe that voluntary childlessness is ethical if a higher ethical principle intervenes to make child bearing imprudent in comparison. Health concerns, a calling to serve orphans, serving as missionaries in a dangerous location, etc., are all examples that would make childbearing imprudent for a Christian. A small activist group, the Cyber-Church of Jesus Christ Childfree, defends this view, saying &quot;Jesus loved children but chose to never have any, so that he could devote his life to telling the Good News.&quot;

Some have argued that the conscientiousness of childfree environmentalists is self-eliminating since they only aid in the deterioration of concern for the environment and future generations, though this argument assumes that attitudes are heritable.

People who express the fact that they have voluntarily chosen to remain childfree are frequently subjected discrimination or pressure to change their minds. The decision not to have children has been derided as &quot;unnatural&quot; or attributed to insanity, and frequently childfree people are subjected to unsolicited questioning by friends, family, colleagues, acquaintances and even strangers who attempt to force them to justify and/or change their decision, for example during holiday family gatherings. Some women interviewed by the BBC have argued that revealing their decision to not have children was akin to coming out as gay in the mid-20th century, while others avoided such conversations to avoid social pressure to change their decision. Childfree women might be told to first have a child before deciding whether or not they do not want one, to &quot;hurry up&quot; and lower their standards for suitable men, that they would make good mothers, that they have not yet met the &quot;right&quot; man, or are assumed to be infertile rather than having made a conscious decision not to make use of their fertility. Many parents pressure their children into producing grandchildren and threaten to or actually disown them if they do not. Some childfree people are accused of hating all children instead of just not wanting any themselves even though these people might still be willing to help others rear their children. When seeking approval to be sterilized, some childfree individuals, especially women, might face intrusive questions from skeptical doctors or be dismissed completely in case they regret the decision. Some doctors ask their unmarried female patients the hypothetical question of them meeting men who want children or tell married women to first seek permission from their husbands.

While parents are generally warmer towards other parents, childfree individuals are neutral towards each other. With being uninterested in having children as the only thing in common, childfree people generally find it more challenging to organize for a social or political cause, with the possible exception of when they, as voters, are collectively threatened with discriminatory policies or the loss of family-planning resources.

While the idea of a childfree flight has become popular in the 2020s, with individuals even willing to pay extra, it is unlikely to be instituted by a major airline for reasons of public relations, regulations, and profit. On the other hand, this is not an issue for certain other venues, such as restaurants.

In November 2024, Russia&#x27;s legislative body, the Duma, voted unanimously to ban &quot;childfree propaganda&quot; to boost birthrates in that country. Russia is the first nation in the world to pass such a law.

==Organizations and political activism==
Childfree individuals do not necessarily share a unified political or economic philosophy, and most prominent childfree organizations tend to be social in nature. Childfree social groups first emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, most notable among them the National Alliance for Optional Parenthood and No Kidding! in North America where numerous books have been written about childfree people and where a range of social positions related to childfree interests have developed along with political and social activism in support of these interests. The term &quot;childfree&quot; was used in a July 3, 1972 &quot;Time&quot; article on the creation of the National Organization for Non-Parents. It was revived in the 1990s when Leslie Lafayette formed a later childfree group, the Childfree Network.

The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT, pronounced &#x27;vehement&#x27;) is an environmental movement that calls for all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. Despite its name, the movement also includes those who do not necessarily desire human extinction but do want to curb or reverse human population growth in the name of environmentalism. VHEMT was founded in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became involved in the American environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth&#x27;s biosphere and humanity. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the movement&#x27;s view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The movement states that a decrease in the human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the movement as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.

In Russia, the movement Childfree Russia has been equated with extremism. Individuals like its founder, Edward Lisovskii, have also been persecuted by the government.

==Statistics and research==
===World===
The childfree lifestyle had become a trend by 2014, and the Internet has enabled people who pursue this lifestyle to connect, thereby making it more visible. Worldwide, higher educated women are statistically more often choosing to remain childless. In the developed world at least, one outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic, as can be seen from online discussions, is that people have become more willing to openly discuss the difficulties of parenting and to challenge the cultural assumptions about being childfree.

Research into both voluntary and involuntary childlessness and parenthood has long focused on women&#x27;s experiences, and men&#x27;s perspectives are often overlooked.

===Asia===
====China====
In China, the conflict between women&#x27;s work and family is a contributing factor to the nation&#x27;s low fertility rate. In the 1990s, the Chinese government reformed higher education in order to increase access, whereupon significantly more young people, a slight majority of whom being women, have received a university degree. Consequently, many young women are now more likely to be gainfully employed and financially secure. Traditional views on gender roles dictate that women be responsible for housework and childcare, regardless of their employment status. When there is a tense relationship between women&#x27;s internal expectations and external women&#x27;s rights and opportunities, the results are reflected in a decrease in women&#x27;s willingness to have children. Workplace discrimination against women (with families) is commonplace; for example, an employer might be more skeptical towards a married woman with one child, fearing she might have another (as the one-child policy was rescinded in 2016) and take more maternity leave. Consequently, there no strong incentive for young women to marry and have children. Not only women but also men who delay or refuse to have children because of the trade-off between work and family, are also heavily considered some respondents felt that they could not fully engage in work at home with underage children and that parental responsibility could neglect important work tasks and even affect promotion progress. Moreover, the cost of living, especially the cost of housing in the big cities, is a serious obstacle to marriage. The problem facing China&#x27;s current social situation is that &quot;the standard of living has improved, but the overall level is low and uneven.&quot; In recent years, Chinese society has been accompanied by rapid urbanization and rising per capita income, and the demand for housing has gradually increased. However, income disparities and inadequate policies have put enormous pressure on housing for young people. Based on the traditional Chinese concept of marriage, housing is often an important condition for marriage, especially for men. And the increase in housing pressure has led to the fatigue of young people&#x27;s marriage, which in turn has affected the desire to have children.

In the past two decades, the increase of the age of first marriage and the reduction of the interval between marriage and first childbirth have been the most important characteristics of China&#x27;s demographic changes. The traditional concept of marriage is no longer prevalent in China, and the younger generation&#x27;s view of marriage has changed dramatically. For example, traditional Chinese marriage aims at inheritance and can fulfill sexual needs under the premise of following social morality. Today, China&#x27;s socialization is evolving, and premarital sex is no longer considered shameful and unachievable, so the meaning of marriage is more likely to be accompanied by each other. This has led to a much lower perception of the importance of marriage. In addition, Chinese Millennials are less keen on tying the knots than their predecessors as a result of cultural change; many are now skeptical of the institution of marriage. Because this is a country where having children out of wedlock is quite rare, this means that many young people are foregoing children.

The &quot;lying flat&quot; movement, popular among Chinese youths, also extends to the domain of marriage and child-rearing. Over half of Chinese youths aged 18 to 26 said they were uninterested in having children because of the high cost of child-rearing, according to a 2021 poll by the Communist Youth League. While the Chinese economy has improved steadily, an explosive bloom of the real-estate market post-2008 has triggered an increase in house prices disproportionate to income. This is the commonly cited reason for childlessness and &quot;lying flat&quot; among the Chinese youth. A normal apartment unit in Beijing (with an average area of 112 square meters), for instance, costs on average ¥7.31 million ($1.15 million), and one would need to work non-stop for at least 88.2 years at Beijing&#x27;s average monthly income of ¥6906 ($1083.7) without any expenditures.

On the Internet, statements such as &quot;no marriage, no children will make life happier&quot; make obvious their negative views of marriage and reproduction.

As of 2021, the national fertility rate is about 1.5 or even lower. In the more developed regions of the country, the fertility rate has been even lower for over a decade, only slightly higher than giving birth to one child per couple, which is comparable to the world&#x27;s lowest fertility rate. This has been proven to be closely related to the aging population. China&#x27;s population is rapidly aging, so much so that this demographic transition far exceeds the capacity of elderly care facilities. It is expected that by the mid-21st century, more than one-third of the population will be over 60 years of age. Of whom, more than 100 million will be over the age of 80. This means that there will be fewer than two working adults per senior citizen.

====Taiwan====
In Taiwan, it has become much more affordable for young couples to own pets instead of having children. In addition, those who want children face obstacles such as short maternity leaves and low wages. By 2020, Taiwan has become home to more pets than children.

==== South Korea ====
South Korea&#x27;s low birth rate in recent years (2020s) is mostly due to people avoiding getting married and having children. That young people increasingly choose to remain single is influenced by a combination of not just economic factors but also cultural change. Among economic factors are the high cost of housing, the difficulty of finding a job, and job insecurity. In South Korea, social housing as non-state-owned, non-profit housing accounts for a small percentage of South Korean housing. This is because the Korean housing system is dominated by public housing. At the same time, the legal and economic infrastructure of social housing in Korean society is not perfect, which has led to a serious housing problem in Korea.As a result, many young people experience housing stress, which affects their willingness to marry and have children. In 2016, the average youth unemployment rate in South Korea was 9 to 10 percent. Unemployment can hurt mental health, and can even lead to depression, suicide, and so on. As a result, employment pressures have reduced young Koreans&#x27; hopes for marriage and childbirth.

As for cultural change, South Korean youths no longer deem marriage to be necessary, while contemporary young South Korean women are increasingly unwilling to sacrifice their own needs and aspirations in order to help their husbands to succeed in the labor market. South Korean women have a high percentage of higher education, yet they have very low graduation and employment rates. This is because the proportion of Korean women who have lost their jobs is very high. They have been married, given birth, and raised a child. At the same time, due to the lack of equal treatment in the workplace and at home, young Korean women&#x27;s desire to have children continues to decline, once becoming one of the lowest fertility rates. In addition, the heavy demands of Confucian family values have also led to a tense relationship between the rigid obligations of marital life and the socioeconomic reality of young people. Because in Korea, Confucian traditions have a great and lasting influence on women&#x27;s roles, deeply affecting Korean culture and society. Transitioning to a dual-income family means that young women will find it challenging to strike a balance between their responsibilities at work and at home. Married Korean women prefer to continue working and despite the new policies, there are still obstacles in achieving work-life balance. For this reason, working Korean women who choose to be mothers typically prefer to have very few children.

====Vietnam====
As Vietnam continues to industrialize and urbanize, many couples have chosen to have fewer children, or none at all, especially in better developed and more densely populated places, such as Ho Chi Minh City, where the fertility rate fell to 1.45 in 2015, well below replacement. Rising cost of living and tiredness from work are among the reasons why. By 2023, polls show that significant numbers of married Vietnamese are choosing to not have children in order to focus on their lives and careers, or because they are wary of the demands of parenthood.

===Europe===
In Europe, childlessness among women aged 40–44 is most common in Austria, Spain and the United Kingdom (in 2010–2011). Among surveyed countries, childlessness was least common across Eastern European countries, especially Turkey.

====Belgium====
By March 2020, some 11% of Belgian women and 16% of Belgian men between the ages of 25 and 35 did not want children.

====Netherlands====

By 2004, 6 in 10 childless women are voluntarily childless. It showed a correlation between higher levels of education of women and the choice to be childfree, and the fact that women had been receiving better education in the preceding decades was a factor why an increasing number of women chose to be childfree. The two most important reasons for choosing not to have children were that it would infringe on their freedom and that raising children takes too much time and energy; many women who gave the second reason also gave the first.

By March 2017, reports showed that 22% of higher educated 45-year-old men were childless and 33% of lower educated 45-year-old men were childless. Childlessness amongst the latter was increasing, even though most of them were involuntarily childless. The number of voluntarily childless people amongst higher educated men had been increasing since the 1960s, whilst voluntary childlessness amongst lower educated men (who tended to have been raised more traditionally) did not become a rising trend until the 2010s.

By March 2020, 10% of 30-year-old Dutch women questioned had not had children out of her own choice, and did not expect to have any children anymore either; furthermore, 8.5% of 45-year-old women questioned and 5.5% of 60-year-old women questioned stated that they had consciously remained childless.

Raising a child cost an average of €120,000 from birth to age 18, or about 17% of one&#x27;s disposable income as of 2019.

====Russia====
By October 2020, some 7% of population between the ages of 18 and 45 did not want children, and this figure reached 20% within Moscow population. Most often, educated, wealthy and ambitious people refuse to have children. They are unwilling to sacrifice their comfort and career for the sake of their children.

====Sweden====
According to a 2019 study amongst 191 Swedish men aged 20 to 50, 39 were not fathers and did not want to have children in the future either (20.4%). Desire to have (more) children was not related to level of education, country of birth, sexual orientation or relationship status.

Some Swedish men &#x27;passively&#x27; choose not to have children as they feel their life is already good as it is, adding children is not necessary, and they do not have to counter the same amount of social pressure to have children as childfree women do.

====United Kingdom====
A poll released in January 2020 revealed that among Britons who were not already parents, 37% told pollsters they did not want any children ever. 19% said they did not want children but might change their minds in the future and 26% were interested in having children. Those who did not want to be parents included 13% of people aged 18 to 24, 20% of those aged 25 to 34, and 51% aged 35 to 44. Besides age (23%), the most popular reasons for not having children were the potential impact on lifestyles (10%), high costs of living and raising children (10%), human overpopulation (9%), dislike of children (8%), and lack of parental instincts (6%).

Whereas in the past, it was taboo to declare that one does not want children, this decision is now increasingly common and accepted in British society.

===North America===
====Canada====

In 2010, around half of Canadian women without children in their 40s had decided to not have any from an early age. Among Canadian women aged 50 and over, about 17.2% had no biological children, as of 2022. A 2023 report states that over a third of Canadians aged 18 to 49 do not want to have children. Many are also delaying having children or want to have fewer children than their predecessors.

Pursuit of higher education, unaffordable housing, economic precariousness, and the rising cost of living are among the reasons why. These trends have accelerated in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. Like the case in other countries, there is a generational gap in attitudes towards reproduction. Baby Boomers are more likely to consider raising (grand) children to be a source of fulfillment or the glue that holds a marriage together. But not that many young Canadians share this view. Moreover, while Canadians today are more tolerant towards the idea of not having children, many seniors still struggle with this decision coming from their own family members.

In Canada, childfree venues are growing in popularity, including among parents who, despite loving their children, would like to spend some time away from them on occasions.

====United States====
Being a childfree American adult was considered unusual in the 1950s. However, the proportion of voluntarily childfree adults in the population has increased significantly since then. A 2006 study found that American women aged 35 to 44 who were voluntarily childless constituted 5% of all U.S. women in 1982, rising to 7% in 2002. These women had the highest income, prior work experience and the lowest religiosity compared to other women. Research revealed that childfree people tended to be better educated, to be professionals, to live in urban areas, to be less religious, and to have less conventional life choices.

During the COVID pandemic, unmarried women without children reported being unhappier. A 2022 survey conducted found that 25 and 30% childless married women and men reported being &quot;very happy&quot;, with 40% and 35% of married mothers and fathers reporting the same. In another survey, younger, childless couples between the ages 18 to 34 tended to be slightly happier than married parents, but the dynamic reverses in middle and old age. Generally the married mothers were ranked as happier than childless women. Unmarried childless people had the lowest rate of happiness after single mothers and fathers. This trend seems to be in contrast to 2012, where married childless couples had a slightly higher rate of happiness than their counterparts. in 2006-2008, only 60% of childless women were married, compared to 93% of mothers. The percentage of childless women who are unmarried has also increased.

During the late 2000s and early 2020s, the fertility rate of the United States fell noticeably, though some of this might have been involuntary. In 2010, about one of five American women exited their fertile years without having had a child, compared to one in ten in the 1970s. However, despite persisting discrimination against especially women who chose to remain childless, acceptance of being childfree was gradually increasing.
Overall, the importance of having children has declined across all age groups in the United States, especially the young. A cross-generational study comparing Millennials (graduating class of 2012) to Generation X (graduating class of 1992) revealed that among both genders the proportion of undergraduates who reported they eventually planned to have children had dropped in half over the course of a generation. In 1992, 78% of women planned to eventually have children. But by 2021, that number fell to 42%. The results were similar for male students. However, voluntary childlessness in the United States was more common among higher educated women, but not higher educated men. A 2021 survey found that the number of non-parents aged 18 to 49 who said they were not too likely or not at all likely to have children was 44%, up seven points compared to 2018. Among these people, 56% said they simply did not want to have children. A 2023 poll found that about 23% of people adults below the age of 30 thought that having children was important, 9 percentage points below those aged 65 and above. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only about 3% of American adults are involuntarily childless.

Student debts, a serious problem among Millennials and Generation Z in the United States, discourage many from having children. Close to a quarter of these cohorts do not want to have children. Some estimates also suggest that approximately one out of every four Americans are childfree, or three times the number of those who are childless. Although concerns over climate change and financial security are commonly cited as reasons, the most popular reasons, according to various surveys, are personal independence, more leisure time, and a preference to focus on one&#x27;s education and career. And by 2019, among single people, women without children made more money than men without children or men and women with children. Many Millennials have chosen to have pets in lieu of children, and they frequently refer to these animals as members of their families or their own children (&quot;fur babies&quot;).

In the U.S., although being voluntarily childless or childfree is not without its disadvantages, such as higher taxes, less affordable housing options, and concern of old age, parenthood continues to lose its appeal. After the Supreme Court decision &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; (2022), which returned the right to regulate aspects of abortion not covered by federal law to the individual states, the number of young and childfree adults seeking sterilization went up. Previously, it was usually middle-aged fathers who obtained vasectomies. Now, many young adults (aged 18 to 30) are seeking to be sterilized (vasectomies for men and tubal ligation for women). This uptick in sterilization was most pronounced in socially conservative states, where people are concerned that abortion, and even contraception and sterilization, could be restricted or banned.

===Oceania===
====New Zealand====
It is estimated that the share of childfree women grew from under 10% in 1996 to around 15% in 2013. Professional women were the most likely to be without children, at 16%, compared with 12% for manual workers. At least 5% of women were childfree by choice.

== In popular culture ==

The novel &quot;Olive&quot; (2020) by Emma Gannon includes several voluntarily childless characters.

One character, Rust Cohle, from the television series &quot;True Detective&quot; (2014–19), upholds the anti-natalist philosophy.

<text>A breeder is a person who selectively breeds carefully selected mates, normally of the same breed, to sexually reproduce offspring with specific, consistently replicable qualities and characteristics. This might be as a farmer, agriculturalist, or hobbyist, and can be practiced on a large or small scale, for food, fun, or profit.

==About==
A breeder can breed purebred pets such as cats or dogs, livestock such as cattle or horses, and may show their animals professionally in assorted forms of competitions. In these specific instances, the breeder strives to meet standards in each animal set out by organizations. A breeder may also assist with breeding animals in the zoo. In other cases, a breeder can be referred to an animal scientist who has the capabilities of developing more efficient ways to produce the meat and other animal products humans eat.

Earnings as a breeder vary widely because of the various types of work involved in the job title. Even in breeding small domestic animals, the earning differ. It mostly depends on the type of animal being bred and whether or not the breeder has a reputation of breeding champions. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that large animal breeders that work as veterinarians earned a median annual income of $61,029 in 2006. The other individuals employed in the field of animal science earned $47,800.

==Required education==
To breed small and domestic animals, no formal training or credentials are required, though it is recommended they familiarize themselves with the desired and standard characteristics of the breed they work with. For those who are seeking to breed more exotic animals, such as those in a zoo, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in veterinary science is needed. It is also recommended that an individual also goes onto graduate school and specializes in zoology. To breed agricultural animals, a 4-year degree in agricultural science is needed for most entry-level positions.

The CRD is one of several regional districts in British Columbia and had an official population of 415,451 as of the Canada 2021 Census.

The CRD encompasses the thirteen municipalities of Greater Victoria and three unincorporated areas: Juan de Fuca Electoral Area on Vancouver Island, Salt Spring Island Electoral Area, and Southern Gulf Islands Electoral Area. The CRD also acts as the local government for most purposes in the Electoral Areas. CRD headquarters is in the City of Victoria, although there are many office and operational facilities throughout the region. The total land area is .

The CRD was formed in 1966 as a federation of seven municipalities and five electoral areas to provide coordination of regional issues and local government in rural areas in the Greater Victoria region.

== Demographics ==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Capital Regional District had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===

*Note: Totals greater than 100% due to multiple origin responses.

== Political divisions ==
The CRD comprises the 13 municipalities of Greater Victoria, three electoral areas and 10 Indigenous reserves. The reserves have a relatively small portion of the population with 5,244 participating in the 2016 census. Some reserves did not participate; those that did are included in the population figures of the municipality or electoral area encompassing them, however the CRD regional government and local governments have no jurisdiction over reserves. Saanich and Victoria together have over 50 percent of the region&#x27;s population.
==Electoral Areas==

===Salt Spring Island Electoral Area===

The Salt Spring Island Electoral Area of the Capital Regional District (CRD) of British Columbia consists of unincorporated areas in the CRD located on Salt Spring Island. It is represented by one director on the CRD.

The major localities encompassed by the electoral area are:

===Juan de Fuca Electoral Area===
The Juan de Fuca Electoral Area is an Electoral Area of the CRD.
It consists of the District&#x27;s unincorporated land on Vancouver Island, including the neighbourhood of Willis Point (Greater Victoria) on the Saanich Inlet, Malahat, on the western shore of Saanich Inlet, and the Western Communities localities of East Sooke, Jordan River, Otter Point, Shirley, Port Renfrew, inclusive of the First Nations reserves of Gordon River 2 and Pacheena 1, which are within its territory. Its population of 5,531 is represented by a single director of the CRD. The total land area is 1,502.24 km2 (580.0 sq mi). Population figures do not included residents of Indian Reserves, whether band members or non-indigenous persons.

==Administrative role==
The board of directors are either directly elected officials or are appointed from within the region&#x27;s elected municipal councils.

The CRD&#x27;s responsibilities include recycling, operating the regional landfill, building and operating sewage treatment plants, a sewer source control program, regional water supply, funding for non-profit arts groups, regional planning, funding health facilities, and overseeing thirty regional parks, trails, and regional park reserves encompassing over 100 km2. The CRD is the sole shareholder of the Capital Region Housing Corporation, which owns and operates over 1200 rental housing units. In certain areas, the CRD can pass bylaws that are binding on a portion of the geographical area or the entire geographical area. These include a &quot;clean air bylaw&quot; smoking ban in all public places and patios in restaurants/pubs.

The CRD assumes responsibilities ordinarily undertaken by municipalities in unincorporated areas of the CRD. These responsibilities include animal control, building inspection, fire protection, and bylaw enforcement. Some of the region&#x27;s municipalities avail themselves of some of these services in a contractual arrangement with the CRD.

==Capital Regional Hospital District==
The CRHD&#x27;s primary responsibility is to provide the region&#x27;s share of capital funding for the region&#x27;s health facilities and equipment. The region&#x27;s health care delivery is the responsibility of the Vancouver Island Health Authority (VIHA). The CRHD shares the same Board of Directors with the CRD.

<doc id="634143" wikidata="Q866123" url="?curid=634143" title="Disk cloning">
<text>Disk cloning is the process of duplicating all data on a digital storage drive, such as a hard disk or solid state drive, using hardware or software techniques. Unlike file copying, disk cloning also duplicates the filesystems, partitions, drive meta data and slack space on the drive. Common reasons for cloning a drive include; data backup and recovery; duplicating a computer&#x27;s configuration for mass deployment and for preserving data for digital forensics purposes. Drive cloning can be used in conjunction with drive imaging where the cloned data is saved to one or more files on another drive rather than copied directly to another drive.

== Background ==

Disk cloning occurs by copying the contents of a drive called the source drive. While called &quot;disk cloning&quot;, any type of storage medium that connects to the computer via USB, NVMe or SATA can be cloned. A small amount of data is read and then held in the computer&#x27;s memory. The data is then either written directly to another (destination) drive or to a disk image. 

Typically, the destination drive is connected to a computer (Fig. 1). Once connected, a disk cloner is used to perform the clone itself. A hardware-based drive cloner can be used which does not require a computer. However, software cloners tend to allow for greater flexibility because they can exclude unwanted data from being duplicated reducing cloning time. For example, the filesystem and partitions can be resized by the software allowing data to be cloned to a drive equal to or greater than the total used space. Most hardware-based cloners typically require for the destination drive to be the same size as the source drive even if only a fraction of the space is used. Some hardware cloners can clone only the used space but tend to be much more expensive. 

== Applications ==

=== Deployment ===
A common use of disk cloning is for deployment. For example, a group of computers with similar hardware can be set up much quicker by cloning the configuration. In educational institutions, students are typically expected to experiment with computers to learn. Disk cloning can be used to help keep computers clean and configured correctly. Further, while installing the operating system is quick, installation of programs and ensuring a consistent configuration is time consuming. Thus, disk cloning seeks to mitigate this administrative challenge.

=== Digital forensics ===
One of the most common applications of disk cloning is for digital forensics purposes. This aims to ensure that data is preserved at the time it was acquired for later analysis. Techniques for cloning a disk for forensic purposes differ from cloning a drive for other purposes. Typically, the cloning process itself must not interfere with the data. Because software cannot be installed on the system, a hardware-based cloner is generally used to duplicate the data to another drive or image. Further, the hardware-based cloner also has write-blocking capabilities which intercepts write commands to prevent data being written to the drive.

=== Backup ===
Disk cloning can be used as a backup solution by creating a duplicate of data as it existed when the clone was started. The clone can be used to restore corrupted files such as corrupted databases. In modern software solutions, it is not uncommon for disk cloning techniques to be combined with disk imaging techniques to create a backup solution. 

=== Drive upgrade ===
Upgrading to a larger or faster drive can be facilitated by cloning the old drive to the new drive once it is installed into the system. This reduces the need to having to manually reinstall applications, drivers and the operating system. The procedure can be used when migrating from mechanical hard disk drives to solid state drives. Modern cloning software tends to communicate with storage devices through a common interface, which means, that any storage device can be cloned and migrated. Sometimes, booting from the destination drive can fail and require adjustments in the computer&#x27;s UEFI or BIOS to make the new clone bootable.

== Technical challenges ==
There are several technical challenges that need to be considered when planning to clone a drive.

=== Drive in use ===
Often, cloning software runs within the operating system which is running off of one of the drives being cloned. As a result, any attempt to clone the contents of the drive, even to a file, would result in data corruption. Consequently, the drive cloner must ensure that the data on the source drive remains in a consistent state at the time of reading. Further, in the case, that the user desires to clone to the computer&#x27;s system drive, this generally cannot be done while the operating system is running. 

A common solution to cloning a drive that is in use, which is utilized by software such as CloneZilla, is to boot from a Linux-based operating system so the drive can be copied and/or overwritten. This approach is not suitable for servers that need to be running all the time and cannot be shutdown routinely to perform the backup (or cloning) operation. Further, the Linux-based operating system must provide appropriate drivers for the system&#x27;s hardware. Drivers are also required for the source and destination drives and for any attached storage involved in facilitating the cloning operation such as USB, tape device and networking drivers.

Some server-based operating system incorporate mechanisms to allow the drive to be safely backed up while the system is running to overcome these challenges. For example, Windows Server 2003 (and later) includes volume shadow service (VSS). VSS takes a snapshot of the drive so that any changes are not written to the snapshot. The snapshot creates a virtual drive called a shadow volume that is backed up (or cloned) by the software.

=== Slow ===
Disk cloning can be time consuming, especially, for large disks because a true clone needs to copy all the data on the disk even if most data resides in unallocated drive space. Software solutions can determine the space in use and only copy the used data reducing the time needed to clone the drive. Some drive cloners make use of multithreading to further speed up the cloning operation.

<text>BBC South East Today is the BBC South East regional television news programme, serving Kent, East Sussex, part of West Sussex and a small part of Surrey. Prior to its launch on 3 September 2001, most of the viewers in the region received &quot;Newsroom South East&quot;, though some had been receiving &quot;South Today&quot;.

&quot;South East Today&quot; is produced and broadcast live from the BBC&#x27;s South East Regional Production Centre in Royal Tunbridge Wells with district reporters covering Brighton, Canterbury, Chatham, Dover and Hastings.

== Overview ==
Launched on 3 September 2001, &quot;South East Today&quot; airs with short programmes and bulletins at varying times.

The programme can be watched in any part of the UK (and Europe) on digital satellite on the BBC UK regional TV on satellite service.

Freeview viewers in Dartford, Sevenoaks, Gravesend, Crawley, Redhill, and most of East Grinstead receive better television signals from the Crystal Palace transmitter which broadcast &quot;London News&quot;. However, those areas are given &quot;South East Today&quot; on Channel 101 through satellite television such as Freesat as default via the towns&#x27; postcodes.

Most of West Sussex is served by &quot;South Today&quot; from Southampton. However, viewers in Shoreham, Haywards Heath, and Burgess Hill are covered by &quot;South East Today&quot;.

Launched with a sole main presenter Laurie Mayer, the programme was briefly the centre of a minor BBC scandal, after Mayer resigned amid accusations of management bullying.

The show then became double-headed, with Beverley Thompson (formerly the programme&#x27;s health correspondent) and Giles Dilnot presenting. In 2004, Geoff Clark joined the programme . Clark and Thompson presented the programme together for five years until their departure in September 2009. Long-serving weather presenter Kaddy Lee-Preston, who had been with South East Today since its launch left the programme in March 2012.

The main presenter is Natalie Graham with weather presenters Nina Ridge and Sara Thornton. The programme&#x27;s editor is Quentin Smith and the sports producer is Ben Moore. Rob Smith left the programme in November 2020.

The main transmitters that carry the regional news are Heathfield, Bluebell Hill and Dover, with associated relays including Hastings, Tunbridge Wells and Whitehawk Hill. As of 7 March 2012 (following digital switchover), the Whitehawk Hill relay transmitter (which serves the Brighton and Hove area) now carries BBC South East output instead of BBC South, and the region extends as far west as Worthing.

In 2020, the weekday lunchtime bulletin of South East Today merged with that of BBC London News to join forces with the latest on COVID-19 as BBC London and South East, hosted by the South East Today team in Tunbridge Wells. All other bulletins remained separate between the two regions. The two separate newsrooms were restored in September 2020. Very occasionally a joint bulletin will still be broadcast, usually due to staff shortages in one newsroom or the other. On 27 December 2021, South East Today merged with BBC London News and South Today to create BBC London, South and South East Today due to staff shortages over the 2021 Christmas holidays.

On 31 March 2023, South East Today merged with South Today to create BBC South and South East Today for one late night only.

<text>Greater Victoria (also known as the Greater Victoria Region) is located in British Columbia, Canada, on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. It is usually defined as the thirteen municipalities of the Capital Regional District (CRD) on Vancouver Island as well as some adjacent areas and nearby islands.

The Capital Regional District administers some aspects of public administration for the whole metro region; other aspects are administered by the individual member municipalities of Greater Victoria. Roughly, Greater Victoria consists of all land and nearby islands east of a line drawn from the southern end of Finlayson Arm to the eastern shore of Sooke Harbour, along with some lands on the northern shore of Sooke Harbour.

Many places, buildings, and institutions associated with Victoria such as the University of Victoria, Victoria International Airport, and BC Ferries Swartz Bay ferry terminal, are outside the City of Victoria itself, which has an area of just on the southern tip of Greater Victoria. Victoria is the locality indicated in the mailing addresses of several CRD municipalities and localities adjacent to Victoria. The central city of Victoria lends its name and cultural influence to many places and organizations in the metro region.

== Municipalities ==
There are 13 cities, towns, and district municipalities in Greater Victoria.

* Core municipalities
** The City of Victoria, the adjacent district municipalities of Saanich, Esquimalt and Oak Bay, and the town of View Royal.

* West Shore
** The cities of Colwood and Langford and the district municipalities of Highlands, Metchosin, and Sooke, which lie generally west of Esquimalt Harbour and Portage Inlet.

* Saanich Peninsula
** The district municipalities of Central Saanich, North Saanich, parts of Saanich, and the town of Sidney, which lie to the north of Victoria.

This breakdown is roughly mirrored by the three school districts in Greater Victoria.
* Greater Victoria School District #61 - (the core municipalities)
* Sooke School District #62 - (the Western Communities)
* Saanich School District #63 - (the Saanich Peninsula)

Greater Victoria is the southernmost urban area in Western Canada; it is located south of the 49th parallel.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
This list is similar to, but not identical with, that used by the Greater Victoria real estate sales industry. Neighbourhoods with official status are italicized. Others may have no official definition, hence other lists of neighbourhoods in the Victoria area may differ. Other sources may give different boundaries as well.

==Demographics==

The Greater Victoria region has a combined population of 397,237 according to the 2021 Canadian census. The region comprises two of the fifteen most populous municipalities in British Columbia (Saanich, at number seven, and Victoria at number thirteen). The Canadian census ranks Greater Victoria as the 12th largest population centre in Canada. The combined population of the cities, municipalities, unincorporated areas and First Nations reserves in the region are as follows:
# Saanich 117,735
# Victoria 91,867
# Langford 46,584
# Colwood 18,961
# Oak Bay 17,990
# Esquimalt 17,533
# Central Saanich 17,385
# Sooke 15,086
# Sidney 12,318
# North Saanich 12,235
# View Royal 11,575
# Juan de Fuca (Part 1) 5,132
# Metchosin 5,067
# Highlands 2,482
# New Songhees 1A 1,839
# East Saanich 2 1,790
# South Saanich 1 712
# Cole Bay 3 266
# T&#x27;Sou-ke 230
# Becher Bay 1 221
# Esquimalt 1 120
# Union Bay 4 109
===Ethnicity===

In comparison to the Lower Mainland (Vancouver and environs), the region does not have a great deal of racial diversity. Most of the population is of Euro-Canadian descent. A substantial community of those of Chinese descent has existed in Greater Victoria since the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858–60, which saw the first significant influx, arriving first via San Francisco then directly from China. There is also a substantial First Nations (Indigenous) population whose ancestors have lived in the area for thousands of years. Numerous First Nations reserves, forming distinct communities, exist in the region — primarily on the Saanich Peninsula, in Esquimalt, and in the Western Communities — although the majority of the First Nations population live off-reserve.

The largest ethnic groups in Greater Victoria, according to the 2016 census, are:
#English - 140,510
#Scottish - 98,475
#Canadians - 86,000
#Irish - 73,170
#German - 50,440
#French - 38,775
#Ukrainian - 19,410
#Chinese - 17,825
#Dutch - 17,790
#First Nations - 15,430
#Welsh - 14,140
#Polish - 13,610
#Norwegian - 12,130
#Italian - 11,665
#Swedish - 9,380
#Indian - 9,180
#Russian - 8,565
#American - 8,485
#Métis - 7,135
#Filipino - 6,650
The same information, although grouped more geographically, is below. The largest sub-grouping is included.

==Culture==

Many Victoria Region municipalities have their own fairs: Oak Bay&#x27;s Tea Party, Esquimalt&#x27;s Buccaneer Days, Sidney&#x27;s Sidney Days, Sooke&#x27;s Sooke Days, Western Communities&#x27; Luxton Rodeo, and Central Saanich&#x27;s Saanich Fair. The Saanich Fair is the oldest and largest of all the Greater Victoria local fair venues; it is considered a &quot;de facto&quot; regional fair because of its greater size, content, and famous reputation. The Saanich Fair has the largest number of attendees of all the Victoria area fairs.

There is a wide variety of entertainment and recreational facilities and activities. The mild coastal climate ensures less extreme weather changes. Outdoor and indoor recreational areas are abundant throughout the region. The Rifflandia Music Festival takes place in Downtown Victoria in mid to late September. The Victoria Tall Ships Festival showcase sailing vessels and the sailing life. The Victoria Symphony performs over 100 concerts a year, including the renowned Symphony Splash, an annual free concert in the Inner Harbour on the August Sunday preceding BC Day. The orchestra is on a barge playing to an audience of over 40,000. The Electronic Music Festival also takes place at Centennial Square where DJs can show off their music mixing skills.

These regional positive qualities, along with new transportation links, international high-profile events (2007 NATO meeting, 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, 1994 Commonwealth Games), could have helped produce a socio-economic effect in terms of: attractiveness as a place of residency, low unemployment, high real estate development potential for profit, increasing immigration of new people(s), and expanding opportunities for business or economic development. High-profile international attention performs its duty as a marketing, public relations, and sales catalyst for further activity. Boaters from around the world gather annually in the waters off of Vancouver Island for the Swiftsure Yacht Race.

An example of this economic opportunity also lies in Victoria&#x27;s geography. The April 19, 2008 the Victoria &quot;Times Colonist&quot; newspaper printed a section, sponsored by the Downtown Victoria Business Association, focusing on the area&#x27;s downtown selection of goods and service providers. As it was in the early days with merchants supplying and outfitting gold rush prospectors, today&#x27;s modern merchants supply outdoor recreation seekers before they head to other parts of Vancouver Island for surfing, kayaking, hiking, camping, swimming, cycling or whatever activities they seek.

In June 2010, the Royal Canadian Navy celebrated its 100th anniversary with a fleet review in the waters off of Greater Victoria, by Canada&#x27;s former Governor General Michaëlle Jean. The review was attended by warships from Canada, France, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, the United States along with United States Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard vessels. These celebration activities coincided with the Esquimalt Buccaneer Days Fair and the 2010 FIFA World Cup activities in local bars.

The 2010 Olympic Torch Relay started in Greater Victoria and proceeded to other communities across Canada. The conclusion of the torch relay began the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.

<text>Carlos Alberto Zambrano Matos (born June 1, 1981), nicknamed &quot;Big Z&quot; or &quot;El Toro&quot;, is a Venezuelan former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 2001 to 2012 for the Chicago Cubs and Miami Marlins. Zambrano, who stands and weighs , was signed by the Cubs as a free agent in 1997 and made his debut in 2001. 

After being used in both starting and relief duties, he enjoyed his first full season as a starter in 2003, finishing with a 13–11 record, 168 strikeouts and a 3.11 ERA.

Zambrano is known as one of the best hitting pitchers of recent times. He was a switch-hitter with a career .238 batting average with 24 home runs, 71 RBIs and a slugging percentage of .396. The 24 home runs are the most ever by a Cubs pitcher. He also tied with Ferguson Jenkins for the club record for home runs by a pitcher in a single season, hitting six in 2006. Zambrano was called on to pinch hit 20 times in his career and won a Silver Slugger Award three times for his hitting.

Zambrano was the only National League pitcher to win at least 13 games in each year from 2003 to 2008. In 2006, he became the first player from Venezuela to lead the National League in wins.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Cubs (2001–2011)===

====2001–02 seasons====
Zambrano was called up to the Cubs and pitched in his first game on August 20, 2001, starting against the Milwaukee Brewers at Wrigley Field in the second game of a double header. Zambrano started the game well, retiring nine of the first ten batters faced. He ran into difficulties in the fourth inning, and was removed before getting any outs in the fifth. He was charged with seven earned runs, walked four batters, and threw just 74 pitches.

One month later, on September 20, Zambrano earned his first big-league victory by finishing out the fifth inning against the Houston Astros. Zambrano pitched just two-thirds of an inning in relief of Juan Cruz, and was just 20 years old. He played 6 games making 1 start with a 1–2 record and a 15.26 ERA. Zambrano did not have any additional starts in the season, and the Cubs finished in third place with an 88–74 record.

Zambrano started the 2002 season at the Triple-A Iowa Cubs, but was quickly called up to the big leagues where he was dispatched to the bullpen and pitched in sixteen games during the first three months of the season. On July 1, 2002, Zambrano started against the Florida Marlins, taking a struggling Jason Bere&#x27;s spot in the rotation. Zambrano logged sixteen starts for the Cubs, recording four wins and eight losses. At times he showed immense potential, including eight innings of shutout ball against the Milwaukee Brewers on September 4. Zambrano did struggle with control, logging 63 walks in just over a hundred innings of work. Overall, he finished the season with a 4–8 record and a 3.66 ERA in 32 games (16 starts). The Cubs posted a disappointing 67–95 record for the season, finishing in fifth place.

====2003 season====
Zambrano maintained his position in the Cubs starting rotation in 2003 and started 32 games with a 3.11 ERA and 13 wins in the fourth spot in the rotation, behind Mark Prior, Kerry Wood, and Matt Clement. The Cubs won the National League Central division, and were one win away from going to the World Series before being defeated by the Florida Marlins. The following year, Zambrano improved his statistics by lowering his ERA to 2.75 and increasing his strikeout total to 188. His record was the best on the Cubs staff that year, compiling a 16–8 record.

On August 22, 2003, Zambrano started against Curt Schilling and the Arizona Diamondbacks. While Schilling pitched a strong game and recorded 14 strikeouts, it was Zambrano that received the attention as he took a no-hitter into the eighth inning. Zambrano got the first two batters out before Shea Hillenbrand broke up the no-hitter with an infield single down the third-base line. The play was very close at first, with TV replays indicating that the call may have been blown by first base umpire Bill Miller. Zambrano retired the next three batters (which would have been the final three outs) before giving up two more hits in the game. The previous no-hitter for the Cubs was thrown in 1972 by Milt Pappas.

Zambrano got his first post-season start on October 1 in Atlanta against the Braves in game two of the NLDS. He pitched innings, giving up eleven hits and three runs. The last hit by Rafael Furcal bounced off of Zambrano&#x27;s leg, and he was removed from the game as a precaution. The Cubs did come back to tie the game in the eighth inning, with Zambrano getting a no-decision. The Cubs won the series 3–2, with Zambrano seeing no additional action.

Zambrano was the starter in the first game of the NLCS at Wrigley Field on October 7. While the Cubs spotted him a first inning 4–0 lead, he was unable to hold it, giving up five earned runs in six innings, including three home runs in the top of the third inning. The Cubs did come back, with a dramatic two-run home run by Sammy Sosa in the bottom of the ninth to tie the game, but the Marlins won the game in 11 innings 9–8. Zambrano got his third chance for a post-season victory as the starter in the fifth game in Miami. Once again, Zambrano wasn&#x27;t sharp, giving up four walks, five hits, and two earned runs in just five innings, along with the loss. Josh Beckett for the Marlins had a magnificent outing, throwing a two-hitter sending the series back to Chicago. The Cubs would end up losing the series to the eventual-World Series champ Marlins after a deciding 7 games.

====2004 season====
On May 7, Zambrano produced another fantastic start, permitting only 2 hits against the Colorado Rockies. Zambrano retired the first 14 batters he faced until giving up a single to Matt Holliday. Only 97 pitches were thrown on the afternoon for the victory, with Colorado managing to hit just four of them out of the infield on a breezy, cold day at Wrigley. Zambrano continued his brilliance in his next start against the Dodgers, stringing together an additional eight innings without giving up an earned run.

Through his first fourteen starts of the season, Zambrano had posted an 8–2 record, with quality starts in twelve of the games. His early season performance also earned him his first trip to the All-Star game where he pitched one inning in relief.

Some of his most memorable starts have been against the rival St. Louis Cardinals. The first was on May 2 when he threw seven shutout innings, and Zambrano registered 12 strikeouts before being lifted in the 8th inning for a pinch hitter. The Cubs eventually lost, 1–0.

The next was on July 19, where he and Jim Edmonds built upon the rivalry between two Midwestern teams. In the first inning, Edmonds was hit by a pitch to load the bases. In the fourth inning, Edmonds connected for a home run, and watched the ball go over the fence from home plate. An agitated Zambrano yelled at Edmonds as he crossed the plate, but the night was far from over. In his next at bat in the sixth inning, Zambrano struck Edmonds out on three pitches, and wagged his finger at Edmonds on his way to the dugout. In the eighth inning with the score tied, Scott Rolen hit a two-out, two-run home run to break a 3–3 tie. Edmonds was the next batter, whom Zambrano immediately hit with a pitch and was ejected from the game. Zambrano indicated that it was not intentional, but Rolen and manager Tony La Russa did not agree.

Zambrano was awarded the NL Pitcher of the Month for September. In his five starts during the month, Zambrano posted a 4–0 record over 35 innings, giving up only four earned runs. It wasn&#x27;t enough for the Cubs as they finished with a late season losing streak, and missed the playoffs.

In 2004, Zambrano led his team in ERA (2.75, fourth in the league), won 16 games (tied with teammate Greg Maddux), collected 188 strikeouts, and led the league in hit batsmen (20). He was also selected as an All-Star for the first time in his career.

====2005 season====
With injuries to key starters, and Zambrano&#x27;s improving game, Zambrano was named the opening day starter for the Cubs. Zambrano was cautious about the opportunity, but was less cautious about arguing balls and strikes with home plate umpire Dale Scott after being pulled in the fifth inning and was eventually ejected. Two starts later, Zambrano gave up one hit but left in the eighth inning after throwing 111 pitches. He had cramps at the beginning of the game that concerned some Cubs fans still wondering about the other starters.

Continuing to build on the rivalry with the Cardinals, Zambrano turned in good performances once again in 2005. The first was on April 20, facing Jeff Suppan in St. Louis. Zambrano gained the victory pitching within one out of a complete game and had his first career triple. He returned to St. Louis again on July 22 to face ace Chris Carpenter. Zambrano turned in another excellent performance, striking out 12 and giving up only three hits over nine complete innings. St. Louis picked up the victory in extra innings on a David Eckstein squeeze play. The Cardinals made the trip to Chicago on August 12, starting Jason Marquis against Zambrano. Once again Zambrano gained the victory, this time pitching six shutout innings before leaving with tightness in his back A final start against the rivals was completed on September 18 as a rematch with Carpenter, with similar results as Zambrano pitched a complete game, giving up two earned runs and gaining the victory, his third of the season against the Cardinals. The final results for the four games: three victories, no defeats, four earned runs, and averaging over eight innings a start.

Zambrano witnessed a strange injury surface early in the season that was first diagnosed as &quot;tennis elbow&quot; but was later traced to his use of the internet to stay in contact with relatives in Venezuela.

On August 7, in just the fourth meeting of pitchers with the same last name since 2000, Víctor Zambrano of the New York Mets outdueled Carlos Zambrano in front of an attendance of 40,321 fans at Shea Stadium, pitching the New York Mets to a 6–1 win and a sweep of the three-game series. Both Zambranos entered with 42 career wins, the second time in Major League history that opposing starters with the same last name came in with matching victory totals, according to the &quot;Elias Sports Bureau&quot;. The other was on June 15, 1944, when Red Barrett of the Boston Braves and Dick Barrett of the Philadelphia Phillies each had 19 career wins. Like the Barretts, Víctor and Zambrano obviously share a double feat, but the similarities do not end there. The Zambranos were born in Venezuela, both throw with their right arm, both switch hit, and both wear No. 38. Beside this, it was the fourth time in modern Major League history that starting pitchers with a last name beginning with Z faced each other, according to &quot;ESPN&quot;. Víctor and Carlos Zambrano have both faced Barry Zito of the San Francisco Giants.

Zambrano had an excellent year hitting, with a .300 batting average and one home run.
Zambrano finished the season sixth in the National League in strikeouts (202), tenth in earned run average (3.26), and third in winning percentage (70%, with a record of 14–6), seventh in WHIP (1.15), tenth in strikeouts per nine innings (8.14), and ninth in innings pitched (223).

====2006 season====
For the second consecutive season, Zambrano was named the Cubs opening day starter, and with similar results from the previous year. In his first start of 2006, Zambrano was wild, issuing five walks, and five earned runs without getting through the fifth inning. The Cubs did score runs posting 16 in the victory.

After a poor opening game, the Cubs did not give Zambrano much offensive support in his next six starts, providing less than two runs a game. This led to Zambrano going winless until May 10, even though he pitched four quality starts in his first seven. On June 5, Zambrano made another bid for a no-hitter against the Astros in Houston. Zambrano had a perfect game go one out into the eighth inning before Preston Wilson hit a single.

In addition to an excellent pitching performance, Zambrano hit a three-run home run in the second inning, his first of the season.

Zambrano went to his second All-Star Game during the 2006 season. He was slated to pitch two innings in the game, however, he had to sit out the game after suffering a minor injury when he was accidentally hit by White Sox third base coach Joey Cora&#x27;s fungo bat during pre-game warmups. Zambrano peaked during the month of July, posting a perfect 6–0 record for the month, the first time a Cubs pitcher had recorded as many victories since 1979 when Rick Reuschel recorded seven in a month. He also was a star at the plate, hitting two home runs during the six games. Included in the month was a two-hit, ten strikeout, eight inning, 123 pitch performance against the Astros. Zambrano finished out the month with a 6–3 victory over the arch-rival Cardinals, where he bested Chris Carpenter. While the Cubs were far out of contention for a playoff spot, Zambrano continued with a positive attitude. Zambrano was rewarded with his second National League Pitcher of the Month award for his July efforts.

Wildness did impact Zambrano&#x27;s ability to throw complete games based on the number of pitches required to get deep into the game. On August 14, he shut out the Astros through eight innings on just four hits, but he also gave up seven walks, hit a batter, and recorded a wild pitch. He also needed 121 pitches to get through eight innings, and was replaced by closer Ryan Dempster in the ninth to finish the game.

In his 30th start of the season on September 4, Zambrano suffered a setback leaving the game early in the second inning with lower back stiffness, but an MRI indicated no significant disc injuries. Zambrano gave up four hits and four walks before leaving in the shortest start in his career. Zambrano avoided a trip to the disabled list, but was skipped in his next two starts. He pitched again on September 17 against the Reds. Cub fans were relieved to see him pitch seven scoreless innings, and not showing any signs of the injury from his previous outing.

He finished the 2006 season with a 16–7 record, 210 strikeouts, a 3.41 ERA, and an MLB-leading 115 walks. Despite the Cubs finishing with the worst record in the National League, 2006 was a transformative year for Zambrano, as he thrived under the pressure of assuming the number-one role in the Cubs&#x27; rotation as the former aces apparent, Mark Prior and Kerry Wood, were incapacitated for the vast majority of the season.

====2007 season====

Based on his tenure with the MLB, Zambrano was eligible for free agency at the end of the 2007 season. Originally, Zambrano indicated that he needed to have a new contract signed before the start of the season, but it appeared that a deal was almost in place, so his agent extended the deadline to go into the season. The contract was close to being done, but then the sale of the team was announced, and all talks were put on hold. Zambrano ultimately signed a five-year, US$91.5 million contract on August 17, 2007.

After his last start of the 2006 season where the Cubs dropped to 30 games below .500, Zambrano identified the need for quality pitching to be added before the next season. The Cubs management added Ted Lilly and Jason Marquis in the off-season as part of a $300 million spending spree. After the acquisitions, Zambrano speculated on the fortunes for the 2007 season, declaring that he was to win the Cy Young Award and the Cubs would win the World Series.

Zambrano and the Cubs start to the season was anything but predicted. In Zambrano&#x27;s first five starts, only one was a quality start with Zambrano posting a 6.91 ERA with 19 walks and 7 home runs allowed in just innings. The Cubs did not fare much better, posting a 10–14 record in April. After a difficult game against Cincinnati where they blew a big early lead, Cubs manager Lou Piniella began to show a little frustration on the inconsistency being shown early in the season by Big-Z and the team.

One cause for his struggles compared to previous years was trouble with the first inning. After giving up three first-inning runs in a loss on May 10, Zambrano described the challenge as being related to bad luck and control.

Zambrano made some changes in his delivery with Cubs pitching coach Larry Rothschild and turned in a stellar performance in New York yielding only one run while providing eight strong innings.
In his next start, Zambrano faced the cross-town rival White Sox at Wrigley. Zambrano did not get much support as Alfonso Soriano misplayed a foul ball in the second inning, extending the inning by an out which cost two runs, and Neal Cotts in the bullpen gave up a grand-slam in the seventh inning with two outs which charged back three addition runs. The official statistics looked poor as he was charged with seven earned runs, however it was not as poor of an outing as the box score recorded.

Zambrano continued to improve his performance in his following performance in Los Angeles against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He indicated his control issues were improving, and got ahead of hitters early in the count.
On June 1, 2007, Michael Barrett and Cubs pitcher Zambrano got into an altercation in the Cubs dugout. The dispute stemmed from a passed ball and errant throw (on the same play) by Barrett in the previous half inning that allowed a run to score and contributed to the unraveling of Zambrano who ended up allowing six earned runs on thirteen hits in five innings. Shortly after the controversy, he went on to win his next two starts. Zambrano came close to pitching a no hitter on June 16. However, he fell short of his goal in the eighth inning, when an infield single broke up the no-hitter. Zambrano would later lose the game 1–0 on a solo home run by the Padres&#x27; Russell Branyan.

He finished July with 5–1 record, which was the best in the league. He became the first pitcher to win fourteen games in 2007, and won the &quot;National League Pitcher of the Month&quot; in July. After winning the award, Zambrano began to struggle throughout August. He started the month by earning a no decision on August 3, after leaving the game early due to dehydration. He recorded his one thousandth strike-out during his subsequent start, but proceeded to lose the game. Zambrano went winless in August, despite signing a rich multi-year contract with the Cubs. He started September by failing to win a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Zambrano, who only lasted four innings, was booed by Wrigley Field&#x27;s audience as he left the field. In a post game interview, he retaliated at fans by stating, &quot;I thought these were the greatest fans in baseball, but they showed me today that they only care about themselves. That&#x27;s not fair, when you are struggling, you want to feel like you have their support. I don&#x27;t accept their reaction&quot;. He apologized for making the remarks the following day.

Despite failing to win the Cy Young Award as he predicted, Zambrano rebounded from a winless August with a 4–2 record in the final month of the season while solidifying his season ERA below 4.00 courtesy of consecutive scoreless outings in his final two starts. He finished the regular season with a career-high in both games started and wins, with a record of 18–13 in 34 starts while living up to his expectations as the staff&#x27;s workhorse by pitching at least 200 innings for the fifth consecutive season. He also led the NL with walks issued, totaling 101 walks.

Zambrano started Game 1 of the 2007 NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks but left after only six innings and 85 pitches because Cubs manager Lou Piniella planned to bring the right-hander back on three days’ rest in Game 4. It was a failed tactic, as the Cubs lost in three games, with Piniella&#x27;s Game 1 move to be &quot;questioned for years&quot;.

====2008 season====

Zambrano started the 2008 season by compiling a 12–4 record with a 2.76 ERA through July 27. At the plate, he had a batting average of .354 through September 14. Zambrano also had a four-hit game against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 23, making him the first Cubs pitcher since Lew Burdette in 1964 to accomplish this feat. On June 21, the Cubs placed Zambrano on the 15-day disabled list (retroactive to June 19), because of a right shoulder strain. In his return from the DL on July 4, Zambrano pitched six shutout innings and recorded the victory in the Cubs&#x27; 2–1 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. On July 7, Zambrano was one of seven Chicago Cubs players announced as participants of the 2008 MLB All-Star Game. On July 19 he set the club record for home runs by a pitcher, when he hit a seventh inning homer in Houston off Wandy Rodríguez. On August 26, Zambrano set two records for hitting proficiency by a pitcher. His fourth-inning RBI single gave him a 13-start hitting streak, breaking Johnny Sain&#x27;s record of 12, and also marked the eighth straight start in which he had an RBI, breaking the record of seven set by Wes Ferrell. (Note, however, that the hitting streak was not accrued over 13 consecutive starts, as the designated hitter rule was in effect in an interleague game during the streak.) Both streaks would end in his next start.

On September 14, in his first start back after missing two starts due to rotator cuff tendinitis, Zambrano no-hit the Houston Astros 5–0. The game was moved to Miller Park in Milwaukee because of damage in Houston due to Hurricane Ike, making it the first neutral site no-hitter. Zambrano only allowed two base-runners, as he walked Michael Bourn in the fourth inning and hit Hunter Pence in the fifth inning. It was the first no-hitter by a Cubs pitcher since Milt Pappas did so September 2, 1972, breaking the longest drought of any team to have already had a no-hitter. Zambrano gave up one walk and threw 10 strikeouts over 110 pitches in his 14th win of the season and his 95th all time.

====2009 season====
On May 27, 2009, Zambrano was ejected in the seventh inning of a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates after an argument with umpire Mark Carlson on a call of safe at home plate. With the Cubs up, 2–1, and Nyjer Morgan representing the tying run at third base, Zambrano&#x27;s pitch got away from Cubs catcher Geovany Soto. While Soto chased after the ball, Zambrano raced Morgan to the plate and tried to apply the tag, but Carlson called Morgan safe, contending that Morgan&#x27;s left hand got past Zambrano. After a brief argument, Zambrano appeared to bump Carlson and was ejected. Zambrano then threw a ball into left field, hurled his glove into the dugout and repeatedly struck a recently installed Gatorade dispenser in the dugout with a baseball bat, while Cubs manager Lou Piniella tried to calm him down. Zambrano was suspended six games without pay and fined $3,000 by Major League Baseball. Zambrano&#x27;s troubles continued when he missed the team&#x27;s flight to Atlanta. The issue was resolved internally, within the Cubs organization. During his next start, Zambrano struck-out seven batters, and hit the game-winning home run en route to his 100th career win. After the game, reporters began to inquire if Zambrano could possibly win 300 games during his career. He replied that he tentatively planned to retire when his contract with the Cubs expired, claiming, &quot;I want to help this team and do everything possible to win with this team. After five years, or four years, or whatever it is, that&#x27;s it. I just don&#x27;t want to play. I want to stay at home and see my daughters grow up and be with my family more.&quot;

====2010 season====
Zambrano&#x27;s opening day start was his sixth consecutive, a Cubs record; however, he gave up eight runs in one and one-third innings, including a three-run home run to Jason Heyward in his first career at-bat. He was charged with the loss as the Cubs lost the game, 16–5. Zambrano bounced back in his next start against the Cincinnati Reds, however. Zambrano pitched seven strong innings, giving up three earned runs, six hits, and striking out nine batters en route to his first victory of the season. On April 21, 2010, The Cubs moved Zambrano to the bullpen. On May 30, 2010, the Cubs decided to move Zambrano back to the rotation. He made his first start on June 4, against the Astros. In his first four starts after returning to the rotation, Zambrano was 2–2 with a 3.09 ERA.

On June 25, 2010, against the Chicago White Sox at U.S. Cellular Field, Zambrano allowed up four runs in the first inning. He then proceeded to mount a furious tirade in the Cubs&#x27; dugout. Cameras showed Zambrano appearing to yell at Derrek Lee, whom the pitcher apparently blamed for failing to field a sharply-hit ball off the bat of Juan Pierre, resulting in a lead-off double. The Cubs coaching staff had to separate the two players and manager Lou Piniella opted not to send Zambrano back to the mound in the second inning. Cubs general manager Jim Hendry announced that Zambrano would be suspended indefinitely for his behavior in the game. The next day, Lou Piniella announced that when Zambrano returned, he would be moved back to the bullpen. It was later confirmed that Zambrano would undergo anger management before returning with the team. The Cubs then returned Zambrano to the rotation for the second time where he did not give up more than two runs in any start since his return from the bullpen on August 9. Over that time, he allowed only 11 total runs (9 earned) in 50 innings, and pulled his ERA down to 3.75. On August 30, 2010 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Zambrano improved to 3–0 since his return to the pitching rotation, striking out seven. Additionally, he recorded his 21st career home run with a two-run shot, increasing his club record for home runs by a pitcher. On September 15 at Busch Stadium, he once again faced Cardinal&#x27;s ace Chris Carpenter and out-dueled him throwing 104 pitches over six innings giving up just 2 runs (1 earned). He has now won 5 consecutive starts and 6 decisions overall since returning to the rotation. Zambrano pitched for the first time with his mother present against the San Diego Padres at San Diego on Monday, September 27, 2010. He gave up no runs over 7 innings and won the game. His record now sits at 10–6 with a 3.36 ERA. Zambrano is now 7–0 in 9 starts with an ERA of 1.07 (seven earned runs in 59 innings) since his return to the rotation on Aug. 14. Zambrano finished the season 11–6 with an ERA of 3.33. He was 11–5 with an ERA of 3.19 in 20 starts and pitched 113 innings in those starts. He was 0–1 with a 4.32 ERA in 16 bullpen appearances spanning 16 and two-thirds innings. For the entire season, Zambrano gave up just seven home runs.

====2011 season====
Zambrano lost the role as the Chicago Cubs opening day starter to Ryan Dempster, but did record a quality start in his first outing as the Cubs number 2 starter going 6-plus innings and giving up three runs. He also experienced some cramps in this game, which led to a premature exit even though he had thrown 99 pitches. In his 4th start of the year, Zambrano dueled the San Diego Padres Tim Stauffer and pitched 8 scoreless innings at Wrigley Field. He displayed better than average control, giving up just one walk and striking out 10 with 3 hits. He received a no-decision for his efforts as the Cubs were unable to score while he was on the mound. The Cubs eventually won the game in the 10th inning on Tyler Colvin&#x27;s game-winning single. Zambrano&#x27;s 10-game overall win streak came to an end on Sunday, April 24 after a rough first inning against the Dodgers lead to 5 runs. Zambrano finished the game, giving up 6 runs on 8 hits in just 5 innings—his shortest outing of the season. Zambrano faced the Dodgers again on May 4, this time at Dodger Stadium. He pitched well; going 8 innings, allowing one run on 5 hits, and receiving the win. On the heels of a road win against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Zambrano&#x27;s road winning streak stood at 10. Another win against the Los Angeles Dodgers extended the streak to 11, but Zambrano was tagged for a loss against the Cincinnati Reds on May 16. On August 6, 2011, again against the Reds, Zambrano hit his 23rd career home run, making him tied for ninth on the list of MLB&#x27;s all-time leading home run-hitting pitchers.

On August 12, 2011, against the Atlanta Braves at Turner Field, Zambrano allowed five home runs. After the fifth home run he allowed, he threw two inside pitches at Chipper Jones. Zambrano was subsequently ejected from the game by home plate umpire Tim Timmons. This would turn out to be Zambrano&#x27;s final appearance with the Cubs. Following his ejection, Zambrano cleaned out his locker from the visiting team&#x27;s clubhouse, and told the team&#x27;s personnel that he was retiring. The next day, on August 13, the Cubs suspended Zambrano for 30 days, preventing him from performing or attending any activity with the club, as well as having his pay suspended for a period of 30 days. Zambrano later apologized to the Cubs and their fans, saying he wanted to &quot;remain a Cub for life&quot; and that his comments about retiring were said out of frustration. He appealed for a shorter suspension through the MLBPA. On September 2, the club announced that Zambrano would not participate for the remainder of the 2011 season. Cub teammates did not express sympathy for his plight, with veteran pitcher Ryan Dempster remarking, &quot;He&#x27;s made his bed. Let him sleep in it. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s something new.&quot; As Zambrano spent the rest of the 2011 season on the restricted list, he finished the year 9–7 with a 4.82 ERA in 24 starts.

===Miami Marlins===

On January 5, 2012, the Cubs traded Zambrano to the Miami Marlins in return for pitcher Chris Volstad.

His first start as a member of the Marlins was against the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched six innings with six strikeouts, allowed four hits, including a home run in a no decision. In that same game, Zambrano also got his first base hit as a Marlin. After an 0–2 start in his first four starts, Zambrano got his first win as a Marlin against the Houston Astros. He pitched a complete game shutout with nine strikeouts, a walk, and only three hits. Zambrano started the 2012 season 4-3 with a 2.81 ERA in his first 11 starts but later faltered down the stretch. In his last 9 starts, he was 1-6 with a 7.62 ERA, 38 walks, and 27 strikeouts in 41 innings. On July 30, 2012, the Marlins demoted Zambrano to the bullpen. Zambrano became a free agent after finishing the season 7-10 with a 4.49 ERA in 35 games (20 starts and 15 appearances out of the bullpen).

===Philadelphia Phillies===
On May 15, 2013, Zambrano signed a one-year minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies.
Despite a highly successful AAA stint, he was released on July 25 after going 4–2, with a 3.51 ERA.

On September 5, 2014, he officially announced his retirement from baseball.

===Leones de Yucatán (2018)===
On July 5, 2018, Zambrano came out of retirement to pitch for the Leones de Yucatán of the Mexican League. He made 7 starts, going 2–1 with a 5.18 ERA, before he was released on August 14, 2018.

===Chicago Dogs===
On April 16, 2019, Zambrano signed with the Chicago Dogs of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball.

In 35 games (5 starts) 61 innings he struggled going 4-1 with a 5.16 ERA with 51 strikeouts.
Zambrano again announced his retirement on January 17, 2020.

==Pitching style==
Zambrano had six pitches. His most-used pitch was a heavy sinker at 88–92 mph designed to get ground balls. His next-most used pitch was a cutter (88–91), followed by a splitter (80–85). He also threw a four-seam fastball (90–91), slider (79–82), and curveball (high 60s–low 70s). The only major variation in his approach to right-handers and left-handers was that he threw the splitter much more to lefties. That pitch was a favorite with two strikes against lefties, while he threw the cutter most often in those counts against righties.

The combative Zambrano was known for being highly emotive on the mound, often antagonizing opponents and teammates alike. He incurred lengthy team suspensions in June 2010 and August 2011 after unleashing tirades in the wake of bad pitching performances. In another incident, he was suspended six games and fined $3,000 by Major League Baseball for arguing with umpire Mark Carlson and firing a ball into the outfield. In other instances, he quarreled—and physically fought—with teammates for what Zambrano considered their poor effort or performance.

<text>The Ashtavakra Gita (Sanskrit: अष्टावक्रगीता; IAST: aṣṭāvakragītā) or Song of Ashtavakra is a classical Advaita text in the form of a dialogue between the sage Ashtavakra and Janaka, king of Mithila.

==Dating==
Radhakamal Mukerjee, an Indian social scientist, dated the book to the period immediately after the Hindu scripture Bhagavad Gita (600 BCE according to Mukerjee; commonly dated to ca. 2nd century BCE), at c. 500–400 BCE. J. L. Brockington, emeritus professor of Sanskrit at the University of Edinburgh, places the Ashtavakra Gita much later, supposing it to have been written either in the eighth century CE by a follower of Adi Shankara, or in the fourteenth century during a resurgence of Shankara&#x27;s teaching. Sri Swami Shantananda Puri suggests that since the book contains the seed of the theory of non-creation Ajata Vada developed later by Gaudapada in Mandookya Karika, this book comes from a period prior to that of Gaudapada (6th century CE) and hence prior to Shankara.

==Identification of Ashtavakra==
Ashtavakra is probably identical to the holy sage with the same name who appears in Mahabharata, though the connection is not clearly stated in any of the texts. Mukherjee identifies Janaka as the father of Sita and disciple of the sage Yajnavalkya in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad. Janaka is also depicted as a king who has attained perfection in vedas.

===Overview===

Ashtavakra Gita is a dialogue between Ashtavakra and Janaka on the nature of Self/Atman, reality and bondage. It offers a radical version of non-dualist philosophy. The Gita insists on the complete unreality of the external world and absolute oneness of existence. It does not mention any morality or duties, and therefore is seen by commentators as &#x27;godless&#x27;. It also dismisses names and forms as unreal and a sign of ignorance.

In a conversation between Janaka and Ashtavakra, pertaining to the deformity of his crooked body, Ashtavakra explains that the size of a temple is not affected by how it is shaped, and the shape of his own body does not affect himself (or Atman). The ignorant man&#x27;s vision is shrouded by names and forms, but a wise man sees only the Self:
===Structure===
The book comprises 20 chapters:
* I Saksi - Vision of the Self as the All-pervading Witness
* II Ascaryam - Marvel of the Infinite Self Beyond Nature

* XVII Kaivalya - Absolute Aloneness of the Self
* XVIII Jivanmukti - State of the being where the individual has attained salvation while being alive
* XIX Svamahima - Majesty of the Self
* XX Akincanabhava - Transcendence of the Self

==Appreciation==
The work was known, appreciated and quoted by Ramakrishna and his disciple Vivekananda, as well as Ramana Maharshi. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan refers to it with great respect. Osho called Ashtavakra Gita as Mahageeta. 

Ashtavakra Gita continues to inspire people. The first musical form of Ashtavakra Gita Saksi I (Chapter 1) was set in the raga Svadhya by Composer Rajan.

<doc id="634163" wikidata="Q1760852" url="?curid=634163" title="Salisbury District">
<text>Salisbury was a local government district in Wiltshire, England from 1974 to 2009. Its main urban area was the city of Salisbury.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 and the English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972, as a merger of the previous municipal boroughs of Salisbury and Wilton, along with Amesbury Rural District, Mere and Tisbury Rural District and Salisbury and Wilton Rural District.

On 1 April 2009, the district was abolished as part of the structural changes to local government in England, when its functions were taken over by the new Wiltshire unitary authority. At the same time, a parish council for Salisbury and its suburbs was formed, called Salisbury City Council.

== Political control ==

The political control of the council was as follows:

*1976–1979 NOC (no overall control)
*1979–1983 NOC
*1983–1987 NOC
*1987–1991 Conservative
*1991–1995 Conservative
*1995–1999 Liberal Democrat
*1999–2003 NOC
*2003–2007 Conservative
*2007–2009 NOC (administration by coalition of Liberal Democrat and Labour)

The political composition of the authority when it came to an end on 1 April 2009 was 22 Conservatives, 19 Liberal Democrats, ten Labour members, and four Independents.

== Composition ==

All members of the council were elected at an &quot;all out&quot; election held once every four years, on the first Thursday in May. 
;Notes
*LD is used to refer to predecessor parties, the Liberal Party and SDP–Liberal Alliance.
*OTH includes small groups such as Residents&#x27; association and Independents.
*Control is the party which had absolute numerical majority, rather than the party or parties that formed a coalition administration.

== Wards ==

In 1975 a statutory instrument established the wards to be used by Salisbury District Council. These boundaries would be in use from the 1976 council elections (with some minor alternations) until 2003, when new ward boundaries came into effect.
In 1998, the Local Government Commission for England began a review of ward boundaries in Salisbury district. After an initial draft proposal and a period of consultation it recommended a reduction in councillors from 58 to 55, and a redrawing of ward boundaries reducing the number to 28. Final recommendations for Salisbury were made in 1999, and were implemented under the District of Salisbury (Electoral Changes) Order 1999. The new boundaries were first used in the 2003 local elections and remained in use until 2009, when the council was dissolved.

<doc id="634172" wikidata="Q34067" url="?curid=634172" title="Svan language">
<text>Svan ( &quot;lušnu nin&quot;; ) is a Kartvelian language spoken in the western Georgian region of Svaneti primarily by the Svan people. With its speakers variously estimated to be between 30,000 and 80,000, the UNESCO designates Svan as a &quot;definitely endangered language&quot;. It is of particular interest because it has retained many features that have been lost in the other Kartvelian languages.

==Features==

===Familial features===
Like all languages of the Caucasian language family, Svan has a large number of consonants. It has agreement between subject and object, and a split-ergative morphosyntactic system. Verbs are marked for aspect, evidentiality and &quot;version&quot;.

===Distinguishing features===
Svan retains the voiceless aspirated uvular plosive, , and the glides and . It has a larger vowel inventory than Georgian; the Upper Bal dialect of Svan has the most vowels of any South-Caucasian language, having both long and short versions of plus , a total of 18 vowels (Georgian, by contrast, has just five).

Its morphology is less regular than that of the other three sister languages, and there are notable differences in conjugation.

==Distribution==
Svan is the native language of fewer than 30,000 Svans (15,000 of whom are Upper Svan dialect speakers and 12,000 are Lower Svan), living in the mountains of Svaneti, i.e. in the districts of Mestia and Lentekhi of Georgia, along the Enguri, Tskhenistsqali and Kodori rivers. Some Svan speakers live in the Kodori Valley of the de facto independent republic of Abkhazia. Although conditions there make it difficult to reliably establish their numbers, there are only an estimated 2,500 Svan individuals living there.

The language is used in familiar and casual social communication. It has no written standard or official status. Most speakers also speak Georgian. The language is considered endangered, as proficiency in it among young people is limited.

==History==
Svan is the most differentiated member of the four South-Caucasian languages and is believed to have split off in the 2nd millennium BC or earlier, about one thousand years before Georgian and Zan split from each other.

Soviet ethnologist Evdokia Kozhevnikova extensively documented the Svan language during her fieldwork in Svaneti in the 1920s and 1930s.

==Dialects==
The Svan language is divided into the following dialects and subdialects:
*Upper Svan (about 15,000 speakers)
**Upper Bal: Ushguli, Kala, Ipar, Mulakh, Mestia, Lenzer, Latal.
**Lower Bal: Becho, Tskhumar, Etser, Par, Chubekh, Lakham.
*Lower Svan (about 12,000 speakers)
**Lashkhian: Lashkh.
**Lentekhian: Lentekhi, Kheled, Khopur, Rtskhmelur, Cholur

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The consonant inventory of Svan is more or less the same as that of Old Georgian. That is, compared to Modern Georgian, it also has , and , but the labiodental fricative only appears as an allophone of in the Ln dialect. Furthermore, the uvular consonants and  are realized as affricates, i.e.  and .

=== Vowels ===
The vowel inventory of Svan varies between different dialects. For instance, Proto-Svan phonemic long vowels occur in the Upper Bal, Cholur and Lashkh dialects, but have been lost in the Lentekh and Lower Bal dialects. Compared to Georgian, Svan also has a central or back unrounded high vowel (realized as ), the low front (except for Lashkh) and the front rounded vowels and (also except for Lashkh). The front rounded vowels are often realized as diphthongs  and and are therefore sometimes not treated as separate phonemes.


===Alphabet===

The alphabet, illustrated above, is similar to the Mingrelian alphabet, with a few additional letters otherwise obsolete in the Georgian script:
* ჶ 
* ჴ 
* ჸ 
* ჲ 
* უ̂ 
* ჷ 
* ჱ 

These are supplemented by diacritics on the vowels (the umlaut for front vowels and macron for length), though those are not normally written. The digraphs 
* ჳი (&quot;wi&quot;) 
* ჳე (&quot;we&quot;) 
are used in the Lower Bal and Lentekh dialects, and occasionally in Upper Bal; these sounds do not occur in Lashkh dialect.

<text>Modřice (; ) is a town in Brno-Country District in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 5,700 inhabitants.

==Geography==
Modřice is located about south of Brno. It lies in the Dyje–Svratka Valley. It is situated on the right bank of the Svratka River.

==History==
The first written mention of Modřice is from 1141. There used to be a castle owned by the Olomouc bishops. In the 13th century, Germanic settlers came and mixed with the original Slavic population.

In the first half of the 20th century, Germans formed majority of the population. After the World War II, German inhabitants were expelled and the municipality was resettled by Czechs. Modřice became a town in 1994.

==Demographics==
==Transport==

The D2 motorway from Brno to Břeclav runs next to the town.

==Sights==
The Church of Saint Gotthard is the landmark of the town. The original Romanesque structure was completely rebuilt in the 1780s. It has preserved Romanesque core, Renaissance portal and late Baroque tower.

==Notable people==
*Christian Mayer (1719–1783), German astronomer
*Leander Czerny (1859–1944), Austrian entomologist
*Jiří Ventruba (1950–2021), neurosurgeon and politician

<text>Venpa or Venba (&quot;வெண்பா&quot; in Tamil) is a form of classical Tamil poetry. Classical Tamil poetry has been classified based upon the rules of metric prosody. Such rules form a context-free grammar. Every venba consists of between two and twelve lines. The venpa meter is used in songs of the types neṭu veṇ pāṭṭu (&#x27;long song in venpa meter&#x27;), kuṟu veṇ pāṭṭu &#x27;short song in venpa meter&#x27;, kaikkiḷai &quot;one-sided love,&quot; and paripāṭṭu &#x27;song that is quite accommodative&#x27; and in satirical compositions (aṅkatac ceyyuḷ).

== Popular books written in venba style ==
# All 1330 couplets from the Thirukkural, composed by Thiruvalluvar, are examples of venba. Tirukkural comes under a sub-category of venba called Kural venba, wherein each kural or couplet has only two lines.
# Nala venba1 is another classical work written in venba style.
# Niti venba2 is another venba style book that preaches values.
# Acharakkovai3 is another venba style book that preaches values

== Basic elements of meter in classical Tamil poetry ==
•Vowels and consonant-vowel compounds(such as ka, kā, ki, kī) in Tamil alphabet have been classified into ones with short sounds (&quot;kuril&quot;) and the ones with longer sounds (&quot;nedil&quot;). 

• &quot;Asai(Acai):&quot; Vowels and such vowel-consonant compound/s optionally followed by a consonant is known as asai(lit. move)&quot;. The Tamil word &quot;asai&quot; roughly corresponds to &quot;syllable/&quot;a group of syllables. &quot;Asai&quot; is of two types - Nēr(lit. linear/straightforward)&quot; &quot;asai&quot; and &quot;Nirai(lit.waves) asai&quot;. 

•Sīr or cīr: Sīr is the metrical foot in Tamil poetry. 

•&quot;Thalai(lit. binding):&quot; The juxtaposition of metrical foot patterns.

Note that the official terms for the different &quot;asai&quot;s are self-descriptive. For example, the word &quot;ner&quot; is itself classified as ner asai. And the word &quot;nirai&quot; is a nirai asai.

== Grammar for meter in Venba ==
A set of well defined metric rules define the grammar for venba. Such rules have been proved to form a context-free grammar.

One set of rules constrains the duration of sound for each word or &quot;cīr&quot;, while another set of rules defines the rules for the possible sounds at the beginning of a word that follows a given sound at the end of the preceding word. Any venbā should conform to both these sets of rules.

Following is the set of production rules corresponding to the first set of rules.

Following is the set of production rules corresponding to the second set of rules.

== Example ==
Following is a couplet from &quot;Tirukkural&quot;:

<doc id="634179" wikidata="Q5220012" url="?curid=634179" title="Danna Vale">
<text>Danna Sue Vale (née Ward; born 14 November 1944) is a former Australian politician. A member of the Liberal Party, she served as Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs in the Howard government from 2001 to 2004, the first woman to hold the position. She was a member of the House of Representatives from 1996 to 2010, holding the New South Wales seat of Hughes.

==Early life==
Vale was born in Sydney on 14 November 1944. She was the oldest of six children born to Albert and Delma Ward; her father was a World War II veteran and her maternal grandfather Donald Dempsey was killed in World War I, along with two of his brothers. She grew up in the suburb of Sylvania, leaving school at the age of 14 and working as an office girl. By working multiple jobs she saved money to take flying lessons, achieving a pilot&#x27;s licence at the age of 20. Following her marriage Vale was a stay-at-home mother for a number of years, eventually enrolling to study law at the University of Sydney in 1984. She graduated in 1988 with the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws, subsequently working as a solicitor until her election to parliament.

==Political career==
Vale joined the Liberal Party in 1993 and soon became president of the Gymea branch. She was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1996 federal election, defeating the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) member and Keating government minister Robert Tickner. She was subsequently re-elected on four occasions.

After serving on various House standing committees, Vale was elevated to the ministry in November 2001 as Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, as part of a reshuffle after the 2001 federal election. In 2003 her department released a review of veterans&#x27; entitlements, although she quickly rejected its recommendation to means-test the Repatriation Health Card. In October 2003 the South Australian branch of the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) passed a motion of no-confidence in Vale, citing &quot;a long standing problem of getting responses&quot; and her late arrival and early departure from its annual general meeting. She was removed as assistant defence minister in the same month, and was not retained in the ministry after the 2004 election.

In 2004, Vale unwittingly became involved in the &quot;cash for comment affair&quot; when she mistakenly faxed a letter of support, meant for radio talkback host Alan Jones of 2GB, to Jones&#x27; former station 2UE. At the time, questions were being raised about the impartiality of David Flint, the head of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, when a letter of praise from Flint to Jones was revealed after the ABA had cleared Jones of wrongdoing. Vale&#x27;s letter, urging Jones to &quot;stay brave and true&quot;, was lampooned by the ABC TV program &quot;Media Watch&quot;, which adopted &quot;Stay Brave and True&quot; as its unofficial motto.

After losing her ministry, Vale joined the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Science and Innovation established to look at the technology of geosequestration of carbon dioxide. The committee reported in August 2007. However, Vale was one of four MPs issuing a dissenting report in which they stated, &quot;We do not believe the evidence unequivocally supports the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming&quot;. Among the evidence cited in the dissenting report were claims of global warming on other planets including Mars, Jupiter, Pluto, Neptune and Triton (a moon of Neptune). Vale was ridiculed in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and the local media for her views.

In August 2009 Vale announced she would not re-contest her seat at the 2010 federal election.

===Political views===
Vale notably opposed several of the Howard government&#x27;s policies and proposals, often on local issues, in particular the proposed construction of a second Sydney airport at Holsworthy and a nuclear waste processing plant at Lucas Heights, both of which would have been located in her electorate. In the government&#x27;s second term, she spoke against mandatory sentencing of juveniles in the Northern Territory. In June 2009, Vale was one of four Liberal MPs to support a Labor move to abolish the practice of charging asylum seekers the cost of their detention.

In 2006, Vale suggested that Australia is going to become a Muslim nation, as a result of Australians &quot;aborting themselves out of existence&quot; She made these comments in supporting a Coalition-backed amendment to a bill on the abortion drug RU486, and expressing concern at the rate of abortion by Australian women.

==Personal life==
Vale raised four sons with her husband Bob.

<doc id="634183" wikidata="Q902174" url="?curid=634183" title="Radio spectrum">
<text>The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum with frequencies from 3 Hz to 3,000 GHz (3 THz). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called radio waves, are widely used in modern technology, particularly in telecommunication. To prevent interference between different users, the generation and transmission of radio waves is strictly regulated by national laws, coordinated by an international body, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

Different parts of the radio spectrum are allocated by the ITU for different radio transmission technologies and applications; some 40 radiocommunication services are defined in the ITU&#x27;s Radio Regulations (RR). In some cases, parts of the radio spectrum are sold or licensed to operators of private radio transmission services (for example, cellular telephone operators or broadcast television stations). Ranges of allocated frequencies are often referred to by their provisioned use (for example, cellular spectrum or television spectrum). Because it is a fixed resource which is in demand by an increasing number of users, the radio spectrum has become increasingly congested in recent decades, and the need to utilize it more effectively is driving modern telecommunications innovations such as trunked radio systems, spread spectrum, ultra-wideband, frequency reuse, dynamic spectrum management, frequency pooling, and cognitive radio.

==Limits==
The frequency boundaries of the radio spectrum are a matter of convention in physics and are somewhat arbitrary. Since radio waves are the lowest frequency category of electromagnetic waves, there is no lower limit to the frequency of radio waves. Radio waves are defined by the ITU as: &quot;electromagnetic waves of frequencies arbitrarily
lower than 3000 GHz, propagated in space without artificial guide&quot;. At the high frequency end the radio spectrum is bounded by the infrared band. The boundary between radio waves and infrared waves is defined at different frequencies in different scientific fields. The terahertz band, from 300 gigahertz to 3 terahertz, can be considered either as microwaves or infrared. It is the highest band categorized as radio waves by the International Telecommunication Union. but spectroscopic scientists consider these frequencies part of the far infrared and mid infrared bands.

Because it is a fixed resource, the &quot;practical&quot; limits and basic physical considerations of the radio spectrum, the frequencies which are useful for radio communication, are determined by technological limitations which are impossible to overcome. So although the radio spectrum is becoming increasingly congested, there is no possible way to add additional frequency bandwidth outside of that currently in use. The lowest frequencies used for radio communication are limited by the increasing size of transmitting antennas required. The size of antenna required to radiate radio power efficiently increases in proportion to wavelength or inversely with frequency. Below about 10 kHz (a wavelength of 30 km), elevated wire antennas kilometers in diameter are required, so very few radio systems use frequencies below this. A second limit is the decreasing bandwidth available at low frequencies, which limits the data rate that can be transmitted. Below about 30 kHz, audio modulation is impractical and only slow baud rate data communication is used. The lowest frequencies that have been used for radio communication are around 80 Hz, in ELF submarine communications systems built by a few nations&#x27; navies to communicate with their submerged submarines hundreds of meters underwater. These employ huge ground dipole antennas 20–60 km long excited by megawatts of transmitter power, and transmit data at an extremely slow rate of about 1 bit per minute (17 millibits per second, or about 5 minutes per character).

The highest frequencies useful for radio communication are limited by the absorption of microwave energy by the atmosphere. As frequency increases above 30 GHz (the beginning of the millimeter wave band), atmospheric gases absorb increasing amounts of power, so the power in a beam of radio waves decreases exponentially with distance from the transmitting antenna. At 30 GHz, useful communication is limited to about 1 km, but as frequency increases the range at which the waves can be received decreases. In the terahertz band above 300 GHz, the radio waves are attenuated to zero within a few meters due to the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by the atmosphere (mainly due to ozone, water vapor and carbon dioxide), which is so great that it is essentially opaque to electromagnetic emissions, until it becomes transparent again near the near-infrared and optical window frequency ranges.

==Bands==
A radio band is a small frequency band (a contiguous section of the range of the radio spectrum) in which channels are usually used or set aside for the same purpose. To prevent interference and allow for efficient use of the radio spectrum, similar services are allocated in bands. For example, broadcasting, mobile radio, or navigation devices, will be allocated in non-overlapping ranges of frequencies.

===Band plan===
For each radio band, the ITU has a band plan (or frequency plan) which dictates how it is to be used and shared, to avoid interference and to set protocol for the of transmitters and receivers.

Each frequency plan defines the frequency range to be included, how channels are to be defined, and what will be carried on those channels. Typical definitions set forth in a frequency plan are:

===ITU===
The actual authorized frequency bands are defined by the ITU and the local regulating agencies like the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and voluntary best practices help avoid interference.

As a matter of convention, the ITU divides the radio spectrum into 12 bands, each beginning at a wavelength which is a power of ten (10&quot;n&quot;) metres, with corresponding frequency of 3×108−&quot;n&quot; hertz, and each covering a decade of frequency or wavelength. Each of these bands has a traditional name. For example, the term &quot;high frequency&quot; (HF) designates the wavelength range from 100 to 10 metres, corresponding to a frequency range of 3 to 30 MHz. This is just a symbol and is not related to allocation; the ITU further divides each band into subbands allocated to different services. Above 300 GHz, the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is so great that the atmosphere is effectively opaque, until it becomes transparent again in the near-infrared and optical window frequency ranges.

These &quot;ITU radio bands&quot; are defined in the ITU Radio Regulations. Article 2, provision No. 2.1 states that &quot;the radio spectrum shall be subdivided into nine frequency bands, which shall be designated by progressive whole numbers in accordance with the following table&quot;.

The table originated with a recommendation of the fourth CCIR meeting, held in Bucharest in 1937, and was approved by the International Radio Conference held at Atlantic City, NJ in 1947. The idea to give each band a number, in which the number is the logarithm of the approximate geometric mean of the upper and lower band limits in Hz, originated with B. C. Fleming-Williams, who suggested it in a letter to the editor of &quot;Wireless Engineer&quot; in 1942. For example, the approximate geometric mean of band 7 is 10 MHz, or 107 Hz.

The band name &quot;tremendously low frequency&quot; (TLF) has been used for frequencies from 1–3 Hz (wavelengths from 300,000–100,000 km), but the term has not been defined by the ITU.

===IEEE radar bands===
Frequency bands in the microwave range are designated by letters. This convention began around World War II with military designations for frequencies used in radar, which was the first application of microwaves. There are several incompatible naming systems for microwave bands, and even within a given system the exact frequency range designated by a letter may vary somewhat between different application areas. One widely used standard is the &quot;IEEE radar bands&quot; established by the US Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.

===Waveguide frequency bands===

===Comparison of radio band designation standards===
The band name &quot;tremendously low frequency&quot; (TLF) has been used for frequencies from 1–3  Hz (wavelengths of 300,000–100,000 km), but the term has not been defined by the ITU.

== Applications ==
===Broadcasting===
Broadcast frequencies:
*Longwave AM Radio = 148.5 kHz – 283.5 kHz (LF)
*Mediumwave AM Radio = 520 kHz – 1700 kHz (MF)
*Shortwave AM Radio = 3 MHz – 30 MHz (HF)

Designations for television and FM radio broadcast frequencies vary between countries, see Television channel frequencies and FM broadcast band. Since VHF and UHF frequencies are desirable for many uses in urban areas, in North America some parts of the former television broadcasting band have been reassigned to cellular phone and various land mobile communications systems. Even within the allocation still dedicated to television, TV-band devices use channels without local broadcasters.

The Apex band in the United States was a pre-WWII allocation for VHF audio broadcasting; it was made obsolete after the introduction of FM broadcasting.

===Air band===
Airband refers to VHF frequencies 108 to 137 MHz, used for navigation and voice communication with aircraft. Trans-oceanic aircraft also carry HF radio and satellite transceivers.

===Marine band===
The greatest incentive for development of radio was the need to communicate with ships out of visual range of shore. From the very early days of radio, large oceangoing vessels carried powerful long-wave and medium-wave transmitters. High-frequency allocations are still designated for ships, although satellite systems have taken over some of the safety applications previously served by 500 kHz and other frequencies. 2182 kHz is a medium-wave frequency still used for marine emergency communication.

Marine VHF radio is used in coastal waters and relatively short-range communication between vessels and to shore stations. Radios are channelized, with different channels used for different purposes; marine Channel 16 is used for calling and emergencies.

===Amateur radio frequencies===
Amateur radio frequency allocations vary around the world. Several bands are common for amateurs worldwide, usually in the HF part of the spectrum. Other bands are national or regional allocations only due to differing allocations for other services, especially in the VHF and UHF parts of the radio spectrum.

===Citizens&#x27; band and personal radio services===
Citizens&#x27; band radio is allocated in many countries, using channelized radios in the upper HF part of the spectrum (around 27 MHz). It is used for personal, small business and hobby purposes. Other frequency allocations are used for similar services in different jurisdictions, for example UHF CB is allocated in Australia. A wide range of personal radio services exist around the world, usually emphasizing short-range communication between individuals or for small businesses, simplified license requirements or in some countries covered by a class license, and usually FM transceivers using around 1 watt or less.

===Industrial, scientific, medical===
The ISM bands were initially reserved for non-communications uses of RF energy, such as microwave ovens, radio-frequency heating, and similar purposes. However, in recent years the largest use of these bands has been by short-range low-power communications systems, since users do not have to hold a radio operator&#x27;s license. Cordless telephones, wireless computer networks, Bluetooth devices, and garage door openers all use the ISM bands. ISM devices do not have regulatory protection against interference from other users of the band.

===Land mobile bands===
Bands of frequencies, especially in the VHF and UHF parts of the spectrum, are allocated for communication between fixed base stations and land mobile vehicle-mounted or portable transceivers. In the United States these services are informally known as business band radio. See also Professional mobile radio.

Police radio and other public safety services such as fire departments and ambulances are generally found in the VHF and UHF parts of the spectrum. Trunking systems are often used to make most efficient use of the limited number of frequencies available. 
The demand for mobile telephone service has led to large blocks of radio spectrum allocated to cellular frequencies.

===Radio control===

Reliable radio control uses bands dedicated to the purpose. Radio-controlled toys may use portions of unlicensed spectrum in the 27 MHz or 49 MHz bands, but more costly aircraft, boat, or land vehicle models use dedicated radio control frequencies near 72 MHz to avoid interference by unlicensed uses. The 21st century has seen a move to 2.4 GHz spread spectrum RC control systems.

Licensed amateur radio operators use portions of the 6-meter band in North America. Industrial remote control of cranes or railway locomotives use assigned frequencies that vary by area.

===Radar===
Radar applications use relatively high power pulse transmitters and sensitive receivers, so radar is operated on bands not used for other purposes. Most radar bands are in the microwave part of the spectrum, although certain important applications for meteorology make use of powerful transmitters in the UHF band.

<text>Maria Vamvakinou () (born 4 January 1959) is an Australian politician. She is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) and has served in the House of Representatives since the 2001 federal election, representing the Division of Calwell in Victoria.

==Early life==
Vamvakinou was born in Lefkada, Greece, an island in the Ionian Sea. She arrived in Australia with her family in 1963 at the age of four, settling in Melbourne. She renounced her Greek citizenship in 2000 prior to standing for parliament. Vamvakinou was educated at public schools in Carlton and Brunswick before going on to attend Princes Hill High School.

Vamvakinou completed a Bachelor of Arts in Modern Greek and political science at the University of Melbourne. She went on to complete a diploma in education and worked as a high school teacher from 1982 to 1987, teaching Greek.

==Politics==
Vamvakinou held office in the Victorian Labor Party and worked as a political staffer for a number of years before entering parliament herself. She worked as an electorate officer to Andrew Theophanous (1988, 1990), executive assistant to Joan Kirner (1989), personal secretary to Andrew McCutcheon (1991), and electorate officer to Senator Kim Carr (1993–2001). She also served on the Northcote City Council from 1990 to 1992.

===Parliament===
Vamvakinou was elected to parliament at the 2001 federal election, regaining the Division of Calwell for the ALP against the incumbent MP Andrew Theophanous, who had resigned from the party in 2000 to sit as an independent. She is the first woman born in Greece to serve in federal parliament. She has been re-elected on seven further occasions, most recently at the 2022 federal election.

Vamvakinou has served on numerous House and joint committees during her time in parliament. She has had a long association with the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, serving two terms as chair (2010–2013, 2022–present) and one as deputy chair (2013–2016). She was also chair of the House Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovation from 2008 to 201 and has also served on the Speaker&#x27;s panel from 2010 to 2013 and again from 2016. She is a member of the ALP&#x27;s Socialist Left faction.

On 9 June 2024, Vamvakinou announced that she would retire at the 2025 Australian federal election. She endorsed Basem Abdo to replace her. Abdo is a former adviser and a fellow member of the ALP&#x27;s Socialist Left faction.

==Personal life==
Vamvakinou is married to Dr Michalis S. Michael, and has two children. she lived in Northcote, which lies outside her electorate.

<text>Barry Hugh Wakelin (7 May 1946 – 19 December 2023) was an Australian politician, who was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from March 1993 until November 2007, representing the Division of Grey, South Australia. He was born in Kimba, South Australia, and was a farmer and small businessman before entering politics. In 1993, he stood as the Liberal candidate in Grey, historically one of the few country seats where Labor consistently did well. He became only the fifth non-Labor member to win it, and the second in 50 years.

While Wakelin&#x27;s win was considered an upset, the election came at a very bad time for Labor in South Australia. The incumbent state Labor government was still reeling from the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia, and would be heavily defeated at the state election held later in 1993. At that latter election, Labor lost all but one seat within Grey&#x27;s borders.

In 1996, Wakelin became the first non-Labor member in 53 years to be re-elected to Grey. He picked up a large swing of over six percent amid that year&#x27;s decisive Coalition victory, turning Grey into a safe Liberal seat in one stroke. He held it without difficulty until his retirement in 2007.

He was father of &quot;Ten News&quot; reporter James Wakelin and father-in-law of &quot;Ten News&quot; presenter Rebecca Morse.

Barry Wakelin died on 19 December 2023 aged 77.

<text>Malcolm James Washer (born 12 August 1945), Australian politician, was a Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives from October 1998 to August 2013, representing the Division of Moore, Western Australia. He was born in Bunbury, Western Australia, and was educated at the University of Western Australia, graduating in 1970 with degrees in medicine and surgery. He was a general practitioner before entering politics.

He is considered a moderate Liberal in a very conservative state and is supportive of socially liberal issues such as same-sex marriage.
During 2010 and 2011 he was the contact for the Australian Parliamentary Group on Drug Law Reform (APGDLR), a cross party group of 100 MPs from Australian State and Commonwealth parliaments. The group was set up in 1993 after a meeting in Canberra convened by Michael Moore (ACT Assembly) and Ann Symonds (MLC, NSW).

In August 2011, he announced he would not be contesting the next federal election.

In March 2014, Washer announced his resignation as chair of the Alcohol and Other Drug Council of Australia. He said the reason was the &quot;ill-informed&quot; decision of Assistant Health Minister Fiona Nash to cut the organisation&#x27;s funding without notice, noting that her decision was &quot;a bloody tragedy&quot; which &quot;wasn&#x27;t subject to any review ... it was dumb advising dumber, and dumb won.&quot;

As at January 2018, Washer was chair of ASX-listed AusCann, a medical cannabis company.

<text>The Complete Guide to Middle-earth: from &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to &quot;The Silmarillionis a reference book for [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]&#x27;s fictional universe of [[Middle-earth]], compiled and edited by Robert Foster. It was first published in 1971 under the title A Guide to Middle-earth. A revised and enlarged edition under the title The Complete Guide to Middle-earth&quot; was published in 1978. It received a third edition in 2001.

== Author ==

Robert Foster (b. 1949, Brooklyn) earned a Ph.D. in English and Medieval Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, and taught subsequently in the English Department at Rutgers University. Foster begun work on this in the late sixties, consulting Tolkien works and letters.

== &quot;A Guide to Middle-earth&quot; ==

The 1971 &quot;A Guide to Middle-earth&quot; was the first published encyclopedic reference book for the fictional universe of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth, compiled and edited by Robert Foster. The book was published in 1971 by Mirage Press, a specialist science fiction and fantasy publisher, in a limited edition. A paperback edition was issued by Ballantine Books in 1974.

The author profile in the first edition describes Robert Foster as the then-&quot;Tengwar Consultant&quot; to the Tolkien Society of America. The book incorporates material previously published in the science fiction fanzine &quot;Niekas&quot;.

== &quot;The Complete Guide to Middle-earth&quot; ==

&quot;The Complete Guide to Middle-earth&quot;, published in 1978 was a major expansion of &quot;A Guide to Middle-earth&quot;, at almost twice its length, with coverage of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, which came out in 1977. However, as it does not include information on post-&quot;Silmarillion&quot; material (i.e. &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; and the history of composition series &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;), the 1978 edition contains some assertions supported by later publications, and some that are contradicted. For example, the Star of Elendil jewel (the Elendilmir) is identified with the Star of the Dúnedain given to Samwise Gamgee, something refuted by Christopher Tolkien. On the other hand, Foster proposes that Gandalf and Olórin are one and the same; this is stated directly by Gandalf in &quot;The Two Towers&quot;.

A revised edition () was published in 2001, in time for Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy.

A new hardback edition illustrated by Ted Nasmith, including standard and slipcased versions, was released in September 2022.

== Reception ==

Early editions of &quot;The Complete Guide to Middle-earth&quot; have been widely recognised as providing an excellent reference on Middle-earth. Lester del Rey praised the 1971 version for covering &quot;literally everything you wanted to know about Middle Earth and were unable to discover before.&quot; Christopher Tolkien commended it in 1980 as an &quot;admirable work of reference&quot;. in 2002, Charles W. Nelson, author of &quot;A Tolkien Bestiary&quot;, wrote that the guide was helpful for Tolkien students and enthusiasts, each new edition being a noticeable improvement over its predecessors in terms of comprehensiveness.

Dissenting, Adam Roberts, writing in &quot;The Times&quot; in 2022, calls the revised edition disappointing and &quot;woefully outdated&quot; in the face of the wealth of information on Tolkien now available on the Internet.

== Translations ==

A Polish edition, &quot;Encyklopedia Śródziemia&quot;, was published in 1998, and reprinted in 2002, 2003 and 2012. A German edition, &quot;Das Große Mittelerde-Lexikon&quot;, revised and translated by Helmut W. Pesch, was published in 2002.

<text>Kim Wilkie (born 3 June 1959) is a former Australian politician. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1998 to 2007, representing the Western Australian seat of Swan for the Australian Labor Party (ALP).

==Early life==
Wilkie was born in Perth on 3 June 1959. He worked a number of jobs before entering politics, including as a farmer, prison officer and employment officer with the YMCA in Victoria Park.

==Politics==
Wilkie served on the South Perth City Council from 1993 to 1998. He was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election, winning the seat of Swan for the Australian Labor Party (ALP) from the incumbent Liberal MP Don Randall.

In parliament, Wilkie was &quot;heavily involved in international affairs as a member of the Joint Standing Committee for Treaties and the Joint Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade&quot;. He was also a member of the speaker&#x27;s panel from 2002 to 2007. Wilkie reportedly supported Kevin Rudd against incumbent leader Kim Beazley in the 2006 Australian Labor Party leadership spill. In September 2006 he and Warren Snowdon were suspended from parliament in a heated debate on the Liberal government&#x27;s proposed abolition of the permit system used by remote Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.

Wilkie&#x27;s seat was marginal throughout his time in parliament. He won Swan by just over 100 votes at the 2004 election. The losing Liberal candidate Andrew Murfin had a request for a recount denied by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC). Wilkie was in turn defeated by Liberal candidate Steve Irons by just over 150 votes at the 2007 election. He was the only incumbent Labor MP defeated at the election.

==Later life==
In 2010, Wilkie was appointed chief executive of the Confederation of Meningitis Organizations.

<doc id="634201" wikidata="Q536945" url="?curid=634201" title="Francis Buchanan-Hamilton">
<text>Francis Buchanan (15 February 1762 – 15 June 1829), later known as Francis Hamilton but often referred to as Francis Buchanan-Hamilton, was a Scottish surgeon, surveyor and botanist who made significant contributions as a geographer and zoologist while living in India. He did not assume the name of Hamilton until three years after his retirement from India.

The standard botanical author abbreviation Buch.-Ham. is applied to plants and animals he described, though today the form &quot;Hamilton, 1822&quot; is more usually seen in ichthyology and is preferred by Fishbase.

==Early life==
Francis Buchanan was born at Bardowie, Callander, Perthshire where Elizabeth, his mother, lived on the estate of Branziet; his father Thomas, a physician, came in Spittal and claimed the chiefdom of the name of Buchanan and owned the Leny estate. Francis Buchanan matriculated in 1774 and received an MA in 1779. As he had three older brothers, he had to earn a living from a profession, so Buchanan studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating MD in 1783. His thesis was on &quot;febris intermittens&quot; (malaria). He then served on Merchant Navy ships to Asia, and served in the Bengal Medical Service from 1794 to 1815. He also studied botany under John Hope in Edinburgh. Hope was among the first to teach the Linnean system of botanical nomenclature, although he knew of several others having been trained under Antoine Laurent de Jussieu.

==Career in India==
Buchanan&#x27;s early career was on board ships plying between England and Asia. The first few years were spent as surgeon aboard the &quot;Duke of Montrose&quot; sailing between Bombay and China under Captain Alexander Gray and later Captain Joseph Dorin. He then served on the &quot;Phoenix&quot; along the Coromandel Coast again under Captain Gray. In 1794, he served on the &quot;Rose&quot;, sailing from Portsmouth to Calcutta, and reaching Calcutta in September, he joined the Medical Service of the Bengal Presidency. He was also a superintendent of the Institution for Promoting the Natural History of India&quot;.&quot; Buchanan&#x27;s training was ideal as a surgeon naturalist for a political mission to the Kingdom of Ava in Burma under Captain Symes (as replacement for the previously appointed surgeon Peter Cochrane). The Ava mission set sail on the &quot;Sea Horse&quot; and passed the Andaman Islands, Pegu, and Ava before returning to Calcutta.
In 1799, after the defeat of Tipu Sultan and the fall of Mysore, he was asked to survey South India, resulting in &quot;A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara and Malabar&quot; (1807). He also wrote &quot;An Account of the Kingdom of Nepal&quot; (1819).

He conducted two surveys, the first of Mysore in 1800 and the second of Bengal in 1807–14. From 1803 to 1804, he was surgeon to the governor general of India Lord Wellesley in Calcutta, where he also organized a zoo that was to become the Calcutta Alipore Zoo. In 1804, he was in charge of the Institution for Promoting the Natural History of India founded by Wellesley at Barrackpore.

From 1807 to 1814, under the instructions of the government of Bengal, he made a comprehensive survey of the areas within the jurisdiction of the British East India Company. He was asked to report on topography, history, antiquities, the condition of the inhabitants, religion, natural productions (particularly fisheries, forests, mines, and quarries), agriculture (covering vegetables, implements, manure, floods, domestic animals, fences, farms, and landed property, fine and common arts, and commerce (exports and imports, weights and measures, and conveyance of goods). He was accompanied on this survey by Bharat Singh, an accomplished botanical collector. Buchanan&#x27;s conclusions are reported in a series of treatises that are retained in major United Kingdom libraries; many have been reissued in modern editions. They include an important work on Indian fish species, entitled &quot;An account of the fishes found in the river Ganges and its branches&quot; (1822), which describes over 100 species not formerly recognised scientifically.

He also collected and described many new plants in the region, and collected a series of watercolours of Indian and Nepalese plants and animals, probably painted by Indian artists, which are now in the library of the Linnean Society of London.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in May, 1806, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in January 1817.

==Later life==
He succeeded William Roxburgh to become the superintendent of the Calcutta botanical garden in 1814, but had to return to Britain in 1815 due to his ill health. In an interesting incident, the notes that he took of Hope&#x27;s botany lectures in 1780 were lent to his shipmate Alexander Boswell during a voyage in 1785. Boswell lost the notes in Satyamangalam in Mysore and the notes went into the hands of Tipu Sultan, who had them rebound. In 1800, they were found in Tippu&#x27;s library by a major who returned them to Buchanan.

Buchanan left India in 1815, and in the same year inherited his mother&#x27;s estate and in consequence took her surname of Hamilton, referring to himself as &quot;Francis Hamilton, formerly Buchanan&quot; or simply &quot;Francis Hamilton&quot;. However, he is variously referred to by others as &quot;Buchanan-Hamilton&quot;, &quot;Francis Hamilton Buchanan&quot;, or &quot;Francis Buchanan Hamilton&quot;.

From 1814 until 1829 he was the official Keeper of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh succeeding William Roxburgh.

In 1822 he published his major work, &quot;An Account of the Fishes Found in the River Ganges and Its Branches&quot; The illustrations were most likely by a young Bengali artist, Haludar, whom Buchanan had trained in scientific illustration since the late 1790s, but about whom little else is known.

<doc id="634208" wikidata="Q17050313" url="?curid=634208" title="Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer's Guide">
<text>The Cabinet-Maker and Upholsterer&#x27;s Guide is an eighteenth-century reference book about furniture-making. Many cabinetmakers and furniture designers still use it as a reference for making period furniture or designs inspired by the late 18th century era. Historians of domestic life or the History of Technology use it for establishing context for their research. Original copies are also considered valuable as antiques.

The book was first published in 1788 by Alice Hepplewhite, the widow of the furniture-maker George Hepplewhite. She is referenced on the title page of the first edition as &quot;A. Hepplewhite and co.&quot; The subtitle on the original edition is &quot;Repository of Designs for Every Article of Household Furniture, in the Newest and Most Approved Taste&quot;. This may vary, depending on the edition and the printing.

It is not known if the designs in it are his own or copies from others, since (unlike Chippendale) he was not famous during his life and no piece of furniture can be traced with certainty back to his workshop. The neoclassical designs in it usually have tapered legs and a variety of contrasting veneers. On the whole this kind of furniture has a relatively delicate look. The designs cover the usual chairs, tables, desks and cabinets. They also cover clock cases, library steps and other objects which came out of the cabinet makers&#x27; shop of that era. The book was very influential on cabinet makers in the eastern parts of the US during the whole of the 19th century.

A second edition was published in 1788, and a third in 1794. The book continued to be reprinted several times over the centuries. One of the most common editions was made in elephant folio size by the Towse publishing company of New York, in 1942. There is also a Dover Books facsimile edition. At 28cm high the Dover edition is nearly half the size of the 47cm of the elephant folio sized Towse edition and much smaller than the 36cm of the original edition. The Towse edition also has 88 pages of photographs of furniture done according to the designs in the book. The 128 plates are all monochrome, as in the original.

<text>Christian John Zahra (born 8 April 1973) was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from October 1998 to October 2004, representing the regional seat of McMillan, Victoria.

==Early life==
Zahra was born in Malta and migrated to Australia with his family when he was three years of age. He grew up and was educated in Traralgon, Victoria. He holds a Bachelor of Economics from La Trobe University and a Master of Assessment and Evaluation from the University of Melbourne.

==Political office==
At the 2001 Federal Election, he was one of the few Australian Labor Party members to increase his share of the vote, gaining a 2PP swing to him of 1.9 per cent, after entering the election with a margin of less than 500 votes. After the election, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Minister for Communications. At that time, he was the youngest Federal MP ever to reach the status of parliamentary secretary. Additionally, Zahra served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Shadow Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development.

In the 2004 election, following a redistribution that turned the electorate of McMillan from a marginal Labor to a marginal Liberal seat, Zahra was defeated by Russell Broadbent. Zahra had a ten-point lead on Broadbent at the beginning of the campaign season, but Broadbent won the seat by more than five percent.

While in office, Zahra had been referred to as the &quot;work experience&quot; Parliamentary member and became known for &quot;combative rhetoric&quot;.

==Public service==
Before entering the Parliament, he was chief executive officer of the Aboriginal Health Service in Morwell, Victoria.

Since 2004, Zahra has served as a Director of the Victorian Energy Networks Corporation, Chair of the Victorian Government&#x27;s Sustainable Timber Industry Council and Chairman of the Australian Government&#x27;s $1 billion Regional Development Australia Fund Advisory Panel. He has also served as a Director of two Aboriginal organisations in the Kimberley, Waardi Limited and Nyimarr Limited. He was a Founding Director of the Regional Australia Institute and has served as its chair since 2021.

From January 2015 to January 2017, Zahra was chief executive officer of Wunan Foundation, a leading Aboriginal development organisation based in the East Kimberley. Before taking on this role he was a Director in the Strategy Group at KPMG Australia. Between 2017 and 2018, he was executive director of the National Catholic Education Commission.

Since 2017, Zahra has been Principal at Impact Partners Australia, a specialist policy and strategy consulting firm. In 2018 he rejoined the Board of Waardi Limited, a traditional owner economic development organisation based in Broome, Western Australia, as an Independent Non-Executive Director.

Zahra has been a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Company Directors since 2011.

In June 2018, Zahra was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for &quot;significant service to rural and regional development, to the advancement of Indigenous welfare, and to the Australian Parliament&quot;.

In July 2019, Zahra was appointed by the Victorian Government as a Member of the Panel of Administrators at South Gippsland Shire Council. The council was dismissed by the Victorian Government following the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry into the council. The Panel acted as the South Gippsland Shire Council from 24 July 2019 until the next election for the Council in 2021.

In 2023, he was appointed as a Member of the Panel of Administrators at Whittlesea City Council and, along with two fellow Administrators, he will serve in this role until the next Council election.

<doc id="634210" wikidata="Q5211555" url="?curid=634210" title="Dalmeny House">
<text>Dalmeny House ( ) is a Gothic revival mansion located in an estate close to Dalmeny on the Firth of Forth, in the north-west of Edinburgh, Scotland. It was designed by William Wilkins, and completed in 1817. Dalmeny House is the home of the Earl and Countess of Rosebery. The house was the first in Scotland to be built in the Tudor Revival style. It provided more comfortable accommodation than the former ancestral residence, Barnbougle Castle, which still stands close by. Dalmeny today remains a private house, although it is open to the public during the summer months. The house is protected as a category A listed building, while the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

==History==
In the 13th century, the estate was the property of the Mowbray family, who built Barnbougle Castle. In 1402 Sir John Mowbray of Barnbougle, Laird of Dalmeny, was knighted by Sir Thomas Erskine at the battle of Homildon Hill.

The estate was acquired in 1662 by Sir Archibald Primrose, whose son was created Earl of Rosebery in 1703. In 1774 Neil Primrose, 3rd Earl of Rosebery, commissioned Robert Adam to design a new house at Barnbougle, and in 1788 Robert Burn also provided designs. However, the Earl concentrated on the estate, carrying out woodland planting and constructing a walled garden. The son of the 3rd Earl, Archibald Primrose, commissioned further plans in the early 19th century: from William Atkinson (1805) and William Burn (1808). Again nothing was done until Archibald succeeded as 4th Earl of Rosebery in 1814. He then turned for a new house to Jeffrey Wyatt, who provided a Tudor Gothic design. Lord Rosebery approved, but wished to employ William Wilkins, with whom he had attended Cambridge. Wilkins was therefore asked for a Tudor Gothic design, which was eventually built in 1817. The design of the house draws on the 16th-century East Barsham Manor in Norfolk. From 1812 the designed landscape around the house was also laid out, to designs by Thomas White Jr.
The house was visited in 1927 by Queen Mary, and her daughter Mary, the Princess Royal.

==Interiors==
In contrast to the exterior, most of the principal rooms are in the Regency style, with the exception of the hammerbeam roof of the hall. The house contains many paintings and items of furniture from both the Rosebery and Rothschild collections, as a result of the 5th Earl&#x27;s 1878 marriage to Hannah, daughter and heir of Meyer de Rothschild. Much of the French furniture and porcelain came from the family&#x27;s English mansion, Mentmore, Buckinghamshire, following the latter&#x27;s sale in 1977. Dalmeny also holds one of Britain&#x27;s largest collections of Napoleonic memorabilia.

==Estate==
The house stands in a large wooded park and enjoys views across the Firth of Forth. A public path runs along the shore, from Queensferry in the west, to Cramond in the east, although a passenger ferry across the River Almond that used to connect the path to the village of Cramond has not operated since 2000. There is still a traditional agricultural estate of tenanted farms.

==Public opening==
The house is open to the public for guided tours only. Some of the rooms are available to hire for corporate and private events.

==Filming==
The house was used as a filming location for the fictional castle of &#x27;Dun Dunbar&#x27; in the 2021 film &quot;A Castle for Christmas&quot;.

<text>The celiac plexus, also known as the solar plexus because of its radiating nerve fibers, is a complex network of nerves located in the abdomen, near where the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and renal arteries branch from the abdominal aorta. It is behind the stomach and the omental bursa, and in front of the crura of the diaphragm, on the level of the first lumbar vertebra.

The plexus is formed in part by the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves of both sides, and fibers from the anterior and posterior vagal trunks.

The celiac plexus proper consists of the celiac ganglia with a network of interconnecting fibers. The aorticorenal ganglia are often considered to be part of the celiac ganglia, and thus, part of the plexus.

==Structure==
The celiac plexus includes a number of smaller plexuses:
Other plexuses that are derived from the celiac plexus:
== Terminology==
The celiac plexus is often popularly referred to as the solar plexus. In the context of sparring or injury, a strike to the region of the stomach around the celiac plexus is commonly called a blow &quot;to the solar plexus&quot;. In this case it is not the celiac plexus itself being referred to, but rather the region around it. A blow to this region may cause the diaphragm to spasm, resulting in difficulty in breathing—a sensation commonly known as &quot;getting the wind knocked out of you&quot;. It may also affect the celiac plexus itself, which can cause great pain and interfere with the functioning of the viscera. 

== Clinical significance ==
A blunt injury to the celiac plexus normally resolves with rest and deep breathing.

A celiac plexus block by means of fluoroscopically guided injection is sometimes used to treat intractable pain from cancers such as pancreatic cancer. Such a block may be performed by pain management specialists and radiologists, with CT scans for guidance. 

Intractable pain related to chronic pancreatitis may be an indication for celiac plexus ablation.

<doc id="634216" wikidata="Q3178207" url="?curid=634216" title="Hard problem of consciousness">
<text>In the philosophy of mind, the hard problem of consciousness is to explain why and how humans and other organisms have qualia, phenomenal consciousness, or subjective experience. It is contrasted with the &quot;easy problems&quot; of explaining why and how physical systems give a (healthy) human being the ability to discriminate, to integrate information, and to perform behavioral functions such as watching, listening, speaking (including generating an utterance that appears to refer to personal behaviour or belief), and so forth. The easy problems are amenable to functional explanation—that is, explanations that are mechanistic or behavioral—since each physical system can be explained (at least in principle) purely by reference to the &quot;structure and dynamics&quot; that underpin the phenomenon.

Proponents of the hard problem argue that it is categorically different from the easy problems since no mechanistic or behavioral explanation could explain the character of an experience, not even in principle. Even after all the relevant functional facts are explicated, they argue, there will still remain a further question: &quot;why is the performance of these functions accompanied by experience?&quot; To bolster their case, proponents of the hard problem frequently turn to various philosophical thought experiments, involving philosophical zombies (which, they claim, are conceivable) or inverted qualia, or the claimed ineffability of colour experiences, or the claimed unknowability of foreign states of consciousness, such as the experience of being a bat.

The terms &quot;hard problem&quot; and &quot;easy problems&quot; were coined by the philosopher David Chalmers in a 1994 talk given at The Science of Consciousness conference held in Tucson, Arizona. The following year, the main talking points of Chalmers&#x27; talk were published in &quot;The Journal of Consciousness Studies&quot;. The publication gained significant attention from consciousness researchers and became the subject of a special volume of the journal, which was later published into a book. In 1996, Chalmers published &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot;, a book-length treatment of the hard problem, in which he elaborated on his core arguments and responded to counterarguments. His use of the word &quot;easy&quot; is &quot;tongue-in-cheek&quot;. As the cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker puts it, they are about as easy as going to Mars or curing cancer. &quot;That is, scientists more or less know what to look for, and with enough brainpower and funding, they would probably crack it in this century.&quot;

The existence of the hard problem is disputed. It has been accepted by some philosophers of mind such as Joseph Levine, Colin McGinn, and Ned Block and cognitive neuroscientists such as Francisco Varela, Giulio Tononi, and Christof Koch. On the other hand, its existence is denied by other philosophers of mind, such as Daniel Dennett, Massimo Pigliucci, Thomas Metzinger, Patricia Churchland, and Keith Frankish, and by cognitive neuroscientists such as Stanislas Dehaene, Bernard Baars, Anil Seth, and Antonio Damasio. Clinical neurologist and skeptic Steven Novella has dismissed it as &quot;the hard non-problem&quot;. According to a 2020 PhilPapers survey, a majority (62.42%) of the philosophers surveyed said they believed that the hard problem is a genuine problem, while 29.72% said that it does not exist.

There are a number of other potential philosophical problems that are related to the Hard Problem. Ned Block believes that there exists a &quot;Harder Problem of Consciousness&quot;, due to the possibility of different physical and functional neurological systems potentially having phenomenal overlap. Another potential philosophical problem which is closely related to Benj Hellie&#x27;s vertiginous question, dubbed &quot;The Even Harder Problem of Consciousness&quot;, refers to why a given individual has their own particular personal identity, as opposed to existing as someone else.

==Overview==
Cognitive scientist David Chalmers first formulated the hard problem in his paper &quot;Facing up to the problem of consciousness&quot; (1995) and expanded upon it in &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot; (1996). His works provoked comment. Some, such as philosopher David Lewis and Steven Pinker, have praised Chalmers for his argumentative rigour and &quot;impeccable clarity&quot;. Pinker later said, in 2018, &quot;In the end I still think that the hard problem is a meaningful conceptual problem, but agree with Dennett that it is not a meaningful scientific problem. No one will ever get a grant to study whether you are a zombie or whether the same Captain Kirk walks on the deck of the Enterprise and the surface of Zakdorn. And I agree with several other philosophers that it may be futile to hope for a solution at all, precisely because it is a conceptual problem, or, more accurately, a problem with our concepts.&quot; Daniel Dennett and Patricia Churchland, among others, believe that the hard problem is best seen as a collection of easy problems that will be solved through further analysis of the brain and behaviour.

Consciousness is an ambiguous term. It can be used to mean self consciousness, awareness, the state of being awake, and so on. Chalmers uses Thomas Nagel&#x27;s definition of consciousness: &quot;the feeling of what it is like to be something.&quot; Consciousness, in this sense, is synonymous with &quot;experience.&quot;

=== Chalmers&#x27; formulation ===
The problems of consciousness, Chalmers argues, are of two kinds: the &quot;easy problems&quot; and the &quot;hard problem&quot;.

==== Easy problems ====
The easy problems are amenable to reductive inquiry. They are a logical consequence of lower-level facts about the world, similar to how a clock&#x27;s ability to tell time is a logical consequence of its clockwork and structure, or a hurricane being a logical consequence of the structures and functions of certain weather patterns. A clock, a hurricane, and the easy problems, are all the sum of their parts (as are most things).

The easy problems relevant to consciousness concern mechanistic analysis of the neural processes that accompany behaviour. Examples of these include how sensory systems work, how sensory data is processed in the brain, how that data influences behaviour or verbal reports, the neural basis of thought and emotion, and so on. They are problems that can be analyzed through &quot;structures and functions&quot;.

==== Hard problem ====
The hard problem, in contrast, is the problem of &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; those processes are accompanied by experience. It may further include the question of why these processes are accompanied by this or that particular experience, rather than some other kind of experience. In other words, the hard problem is the problem of explaining why certain mechanisms are accompanied by conscious experience. For example, why should neural processing in the brain lead to the felt sensations of, say, feelings of hunger? And why should those neural firings lead to feelings of hunger rather than some other feeling (such as, for example, feelings of thirst)?

Chalmers argues that it is conceivable that the relevant behaviours associated with hunger, or any other feeling, could occur even in the absence of that feeling. This suggests that experience is irreducible to physical systems such as the brain. This is the topic of the next section.

==== How the easy and hard problems are related ====
Chalmers believes that the hard problem is irreducible to the easy problems: solving the easy problems will not lead to a solution to the hard problems. This is because the easy problems pertain to the causal structure of the world while the hard problem pertains to consciousness, and facts about consciousness include facts that go beyond mere causal or structural description.

For example, suppose someone were to stub their foot and yelp. In this scenario, the easy problems are mechanistic explanations that involve the activity of the nervous system and brain and its relation to the environment (such as the propagation of nerve signals from the toe to the brain, the processing of that information and how it leads to yelping, and so on). The hard problem is the question of why these mechanisms are accompanied by &quot;the feeling of pain&quot;, or why these feelings of pain feel the particular way that they do. Chalmers argues that facts about the neural mechanisms of pain, and pain behaviours, do not lead to facts about conscious experience. Facts about conscious experience are, instead, further facts, not derivable from facts about the brain. An explanation for all of the relevant physical facts about neural processing would leave unexplained facts about what it is like to feel pain. This is in part because functions and physical structures of any sort could conceivably exist in the absence of experience. Alternatively, they could exist alongside a different set of experiences. For example, it is logically possible for a perfect replica of Chalmers to have no experience at all, or for it to have a different set of experiences (such as an inverted visible spectrum, so that the blue-yellow red-green axes of its visual field are flipped).

The same cannot be said about clocks, hurricanes, or other physical things. In those cases, a structural or functional description is a complete description. A perfect replica of a clock is a clock, a perfect replica of a hurricane is a hurricane, and so on. The difference is that physical things are nothing more than their physical constituents. For example, water is nothing more than H2O molecules, and understanding everything about H2O molecules is to understand everything there is to know about water. But consciousness is not like this. Knowing everything there is to know about the brain, or any physical system, is not to know everything there is to know about consciousness. Consciousness, then, must not be purely physical.

==== Implications for physicalism ====

Chalmers&#x27;s idea contradicts physicalism, sometimes labelled materialism. This is the view that everything that exists is a physical or material thing, so everything can be reduced to microphysical things. For example, the rings of Saturn are a physical thing because they are nothing more than a complex arrangement of a large number of subatomic particles interacting in a certain way. According to physicalism, everything, including consciousness, can be explained by appeal to its microphysical constituents. Chalmers&#x27;s &quot;hard problem&quot; presents a counterexample to this view and to other phenomena like swarms of birds, since it suggests that consciousness, like swarms of birds, cannot be reductively explained by appealing to their physical constituents. Thus, if the hard problem is a real problem then physicalism must be false, and if physicalism is true then the hard problem must not be a real problem.

Though Chalmers rejects physicalism, he is still a naturalist.

=== Historical precedents ===

The hard problem of consciousness has scholarly antecedents considerably earlier than Chalmers. Chalmers himself notes that &quot;a number of thinkers in the recent and distant past&quot; have &quot;recognised the particular difficulties of explaining consciousness.&quot; He states that all his original 1996 paper contributed to the discussion was &quot;a catchy name, a minor reformulation of philosophically familiar points&quot;.

Among others, thinkers who have made arguments similar to Chalmers&#x27; formulation of the hard problem include Isaac Newton, John Locke, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, John Stuart Mill, and Thomas Henry Huxley. Likewise, Asian philosophers like Dharmakirti and Guifeng Zongmi discussed the problem of how consciousness arises from unconscious matter. The Tattva Bodha, an eighth century text attributed to Adi Shankara from the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, describes consciousness being &quot;anubhati&quot;, or self-revealing, illuminating all objects of knowledge without itself being a material object.

=== Related concepts ===

==== The mind–body problem ====

The mind–body problem is the problem of how the mind and the body relate. The mind-body problem is more general than the hard problem of consciousness, since it is the problem of discovering how the mind and body relate in general, thereby implicating any theoretical framework that broaches the topic. The hard problem, in contrast, is often construed as a problem uniquely faced by physicalist or materialist theories of mind.

==== &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot; ====

The philosopher Thomas Nagel posited in his 1974 paper &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot; that experiences are essentially subjective (accessible only to the individual undergoing them—i.e., felt only by the one feeling them), while physical states are essentially objective (accessible to multiple individuals). So he argued we have no idea what it could mean to claim that an essentially subjective state just &quot;is&quot; an essentially non-subjective state (i.e., that a felt state is nothing but a functional state). In other words, we have no idea of what reductivism amounts to. He believes &quot;every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view, and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view.&quot;

==== Explanatory gap ====
In 1983, the philosopher Joseph Levine proposed that there is an &quot;explanatory gap&quot; between our understanding of the physical world and our understanding of consciousness.

Levine&#x27;s disputes that conscious states are reducible to neuronal or brain states. He uses the example of pain (as an example of a conscious state) and its reduction to the firing of c-fibers (a kind of nerve cell). The difficulty is as follows: even if consciousness is physical, it is not clear which physical states correspond to which conscious states. The bridges between the two levels of description will be contingent, rather than necessary. This is significant because in most contexts, relating two scientific levels of descriptions (such as physics and chemistry) is done with the assurance of necessary connections between the two theories (for example, chemistry follows with necessity from physics).

Levine illustrates this with a thought experiment: Suppose that humanity were to encounter an alien species, and suppose it is known that the aliens do not have any c-fibers. Even if one knows this, it is not obvious that the aliens do not feel pain: that would remain an open question. This is because the fact that aliens do not have c-fibers does not entail that they do not feel pain (in other words, feelings of pain do not follow with logical necessity from the firing of c-fibers). Levine thinks such thought experiments demonstrate an explanatory gap between consciousness and the physical world: even if consciousness is reducible to physical things, consciousness cannot be explained in terms of physical things, because the link between physical things and consciousness is a contingent link.

Levine does not think that the explanatory gap means that consciousness is not physical; he is open to the idea that the explanatory gap is only an epistemological problem for physicalism. In contrast, Chalmers thinks that the hard problem of consciousness does show that consciousness is not physical.

==== Philosophical zombies ====

Philosophical zombies are a thought experiment commonly used in discussions of the hard problem. They are hypothetical beings physically identical to humans but that lack conscious experience. Philosophers such as Chalmers, Joseph Levine, and Francis Kripke take zombies as impossible within the bounds of nature but possible within the bounds of logic. This would imply that facts about experience are not logically entailed by the &quot;physical&quot; facts. Therefore, consciousness is irreducible. In Chalmers&#x27; words, &quot;after God (hypothetically) created the world, he had more work to do.&quot; Daniel Dennett, a philosopher of mind, criticised the field&#x27;s use of &quot;the zombie hunch&quot; which he deems an &quot;embarrassment&quot; that ought to &quot;be dropped like a hot potato&quot;.

==== Knowledge argument ====

The knowledge argument, also known as &quot;Mary&#x27;s Room&quot;, is another common thought experiment: A hypothetical neuroscientist named Mary has lived her whole life in a black-and-white room and has never seen colour before. She also happens to know everything there is to know about the brain and colour perception. Chalmers believes that when Mary sees the colour red for the first time, she gains new knowledge — the knowledge of &quot;what red looks like&quot; — which is distinct from, and irreducible to, her prior physical knowledge of the brain or visual system. A stronger form of the knowledge argument claims not merely that Mary would lack subjective &quot;knowledge&quot; of &quot;what red looks like,&quot; but that she would lack knowledge of an objective &quot;fact&quot; about the world: namely, &quot;what red looks like,&quot; a non-physical fact that can be learned only through direct experience (qualia). Others, such as Thomas Nagel, take a &quot;physicalist&quot; position, disagree with the argument in its stronger and/or weaker forms. For example, Nagel put forward a &quot;speculative proposal&quot; of devising a language that could &quot;explain to a person blind from birth what it is like to see.&quot; The knowledge argument implies that such a language could not exist.

==Philosophical responses==
David Chalmers&#x27; formulation of the hard problem of consciousness provoked considerable debate within philosophy of mind, as well as scientific research.
The hard problem is considered a problem primarily for physicalist views of the mind (the view that the mind is a physical object or process), since physical explanations tend to be functional, or structural. Because of this, some physicalists have responded to the hard problem by seeking to show that it dissolves upon analysis. Other researchers accept the problem as real and seek to develop a theory of consciousness&#x27; place in the world that can solve it, by either modifying physicalism or abandoning it in favour of an alternative ontology (such as panpsychism or dualism).
A third response has been to accept the hard problem as real but deny human cognitive faculties can solve it.

PhilPapers is an organization that archives academic philosophy papers and periodically surveys professional philosophers about their views. It can be used to gauge professional attitudes towards the hard problem. As of the 2020 survey results, it seems that the majority of philosophers (62.42%) agree that the hard problem is real, with a substantial minority that disagrees (29.76%).

Attitudes towards physicalism also differ among professionals. In the 2009 PhilPapers survey, 56.5% of philosophers surveyed subscribed to physicalism and 27.1% of philosophers surveyed rejected physicalism. 16.4% fell into the &quot;other&quot; category. In the 2020 PhilPapers survey, 51.93% of philosophers surveyed indicated that they &quot;accept or lean towards&quot; physicalism and 32.08% indicated that they reject physicalism. 6.23% were &quot;agnostic&quot; or &quot;undecided&quot;.

Different solutions have been proposed to the hard problem of consciousness. The sections below taxonomizes the various responses to the hard problem. The shape of this taxonomy was first introduced by Chalmers in a 2003 literature review on the topic. The labelling convention of this taxonomy has been incorporated into the technical vocabulary of analytic philosophy, being used by philosophers such as Adrian Boutel, Raamy Majeed, Janet Levin, Pete Mandik &amp; Josh Weisberg, Roberto Pereira, and Helen Yetter-Chappell.

===Type-A Materialism===

Type-A materialism (also known as &quot;reductive materialism&quot; or &quot;a priori physicalism&quot;) is a view characterized by a commitment to physicalism and a full rejection of the hard problem. By this view, the hard problem either does not exist or is just another easy problem, because every fact about the mind is a fact about the performance of various functions or behaviours. So, once all the relevant functions and behaviours have been accounted for, there will not be any facts left over in need of explanation. Thinkers who subscribe to type-A materialism include Paul and Patricia Churchland, Daniel Dennett, Keith Frankish, and Thomas Metzinger.

Some type-A materialists believe in the reality of phenomenal consciousness but believe it is nothing extra in addition to certain functions or behaviours. This view is sometimes referred to as &quot;strong reductionism&quot;. Other type-A materialists may reject the existence of phenomenal consciousness entirely. This view is referred to as eliminative materialism or illusionism.

====Strong reductionism====
Many philosophers have disputed that there is a hard problem of consciousness distinct from what Chalmers calls the easy problems of consciousness. Some among them, who are sometimes termed &quot;strong reductionists&quot;, hold that phenomenal consciousness (i.e., conscious experience) does exist but that it can be fully understood as reducible to the brain.

Broadly, strong reductionists accept that conscious experience is real but argue it can be fully understood in functional terms as an emergent property of the material brain. In contrast to weak reductionists (see above), strong reductionists reject ideas used to support the existence of a hard problem (that the same functional organization could exist without consciousness, or that a blind person who understood vision through a textbook would not know everything about sight) as simply mistaken intuitions.

A notable family of strong reductionist accounts are the higher-order theories of consciousness. In 2005, the philosopher Peter Carruthers wrote about &quot;recognitional concepts of experience&quot;, that is, &quot;a capacity to recognize [a] type of experience when it occurs in one&#x27;s own mental life,&quot; and suggested that such a capacity could explain phenomenal consciousness without positing qualia. On the higher-order view, since consciousness is a representation, and representation is fully functionally analyzable, there is no hard problem of consciousness.

The philosophers Glenn Carruthers and Elizabeth Schier said in 2012 that the main arguments for the existence of a hard problem—philosophical zombies, Mary&#x27;s room, and Nagel&#x27;s bats—are only persuasive if one already assumes that &quot;consciousness must be independent of the structure and function of mental states, i.e. that there is a hard problem.&quot; Hence, the arguments beg the question. The authors suggest that &quot;instead of letting our conclusions on the thought experiments guide our theories of consciousness, we should let our theories of consciousness guide our conclusions from the thought experiments.&quot;

The philosopher Massimo Pigliucci argued in 2013 that the hard problem is misguided, resulting from a &quot;category mistake&quot;. He said: &quot;Of course an explanation isn&#x27;t the same as an experience, but that&#x27;s because the two are completely independent categories, like colors and triangles. It is obvious that I cannot experience what it is like to be you, but I can potentially have a complete explanation of how and why it is possible to be you.&quot;

In 2017, the philosopher Marco Stango, in a paper on John Dewey&#x27;s approach to the problem of consciousness (which preceded Chalmers&#x27; formulation of the hard problem by over half a century), noted that Dewey&#x27;s approach would see the hard problem as the consequence of an unjustified assumption that feelings and functional behaviors are not the same physical process: &quot;For the Deweyan philosopher, the &#x27;hard problem&#x27; of consciousness is a &#x27;conceptual fact&#x27; only in the sense that it is a : the mistake of failing to see that the physical can be had as an episode of immediate sentiency.&quot;

The philosopher Thomas Metzinger likens the hard problem of consciousness to vitalism, a formerly widespread view in biology which was not so much solved as abandoned. Brian Jonathan Garrett has also argued that the hard problem suffers from flaws analogous to those of vitalism.

The philosopher Peter Hacker argues that the hard problem is misguided in that it asks how consciousness can emerge from matter, whereas in fact sentience emerges from the evolution of living organisms. He states: &quot;The hard problem isn’t a hard problem at all. The really hard problems are the problems the scientists are dealing with. [...] The philosophical problem, like all philosophical problems, is a confusion in the conceptual scheme.&quot; Hacker&#x27;s critique extends beyond Chalmers and the hard problem, being directed against contemporary philosophy of mind and neuroscience more broadly. Along with the neuroscientist Max Bennett, he has argued that most of contemporary neuroscience remains implicitly dualistic in its conceptualizations and is predicated on the &quot;mereological fallacy&quot; of ascribing psychological concepts to the brain that can properly be ascribed only to the person as a whole. Hacker further states that &quot;consciousness studies&quot;, as it exists today, is &quot;literally a total waste of time&quot; and that &quot;the conception of consciousness which they have is incoherent&quot;.

====Eliminative materialism / Illusionism====
Eliminative materialism or eliminativism is the view that many or all of the mental states used in folk psychology (i.e., common-sense ways of discussing the mind) do not, upon scientific examination, correspond to real brain mechanisms. According the 2020 PhilPapers survey, 4.51% of philosophers surveyed subscribe to eliminativism.

While Patricia Churchland and Paul Churchland have famously applied eliminative materialism to propositional attitudes, philosophers including Daniel Dennett, Georges Rey, and Keith Frankish have applied it to qualia or phenomenal consciousness (i.e., conscious experience). On their view, it is mistaken not only to believe there is a hard problem of consciousness, but to believe phenomenal consciousness exists at all.

This stance has recently taken on the name of &quot;illusionism&quot;: the view that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion. The term was popularized by the philosopher Keith Frankish. Frankish argues that &quot;illusionism&quot; is preferable to &quot;eliminativism&quot; for labelling the view that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion. More substantively, Frankish argues that illusionism about phenomenal consciousness is preferable to realism about phenomenal consciousness. He states: &quot;Theories of consciousness typically address the hard problem. They accept that phenomenal consciousness is real and aim to explain how it comes to exist. There is, however, another approach, which holds that phenomenal consciousness is an illusion and aims to explain why it seems to exist.&quot; Frankish concludes that illusionism &quot;replaces the hard problem with the illusion problem—the problem of explaining how the illusion of phenomenality arises and why it is so powerful.&quot;

The philosopher Daniel Dennett was another prominent figure associated with illusionism. After Frankish published a paper in the Journal of Consciousness Studies titled &quot;Illusionism as a Theory of Consciousness,&quot; Dennett responded with his own paper humorously titled &quot;Illusionism as the Obvious Default Theory of Consciousness.&quot; Dennett had been arguing for the illusory status of consciousness since early on in his career. For example, in 1979 he published a paper titled &quot;On the Absence of Phenomenology&quot; (where he argues for the nonexistence of phenomenal consciousness). Similar ideas have been explicated in his 1991 book Consciousness Explained. Dennett argues that the so-called &quot;hard problem&quot; will be solved in the process of solving what Chalmers terms the &quot;easy problems&quot;. He compares consciousness to stage magic and its capability to create extraordinary illusions out of ordinary things. To show how people might be commonly fooled into overstating the accuracy of their introspective abilities, he describes a phenomenon called change blindness, a visual process that involves failure to detect scenery changes in a series of alternating images. He accordingly argues that consciousness need not be what it seems to be based on introspection. To address the question of the hard problem, or how and why physical processes give rise to experience, Dennett states that the phenomenon of having experience is nothing more than the performance of functions or the production of behavior, which can also be referred to as the easy problems of consciousness. Thus, Dennett argues that the hard problem of experience is included among—not separate from—the easy problems, and therefore they can only be explained together as a cohesive unit.

Eliminativists differ on the role they believe intuitive judgement plays in creating the apparent reality of consciousness. The philosopher Jacy Reese Anthis is of the position that this issue is born of an overreliance on intuition, calling philosophical discussions on the topic of consciousness a form of &quot;intuition jousting&quot;. But when the issue is tackled with &quot;formal argumentation&quot; and &quot;precise semantics&quot; then the hard problem will dissolve. The philosopher Elizabeth Irvine, in contrast, can be read as having the opposite view, since she argues that phenomenal properties (that is, properties of consciousness) do not exist in our common-sense view of the world. She states that &quot;the hard problem of consciousness may not be a genuine problem for non-philosophers (despite its overwhelming obviousness to philosophers).&quot;

A complete illusionist theory of consciousness must include the description of a mechanism by which the illusion of subjective experience is had and reported by people. Various philosophers and scientists have proposed possible theories. For example, in his book &quot;Consciousness and the Social Brain&quot; neuroscientist Michael Graziano advocates what he calls attention schema theory, in which our perception of being conscious is merely an error in perception, held by brains which evolved to hold erroneous and incomplete models of their own internal workings, just as they hold erroneous and incomplete models of their own bodies and of the external world.

===== Criticisms =====
The main criticisms of eliminative materialism and illusionism hinge on the counterintuitive nature of the view. Arguments of this form are called &quot;Moorean Arguments&quot;. A Moorean argument seeks to undermine the conclusion of an argument by asserting that the negation of that conclusion is more certain than the premises of the argument.

The roots of the Moorean Argument against illusionism extend back to Augustine of Hippo who stated that he could not be deceived regarding his own existence, since the very act of being deceived secures the existence of a being there to be the recipient of that deception.
In the Early-Modern era, these arguments were repopularized by René Descartes, who coined the now famous phrase &quot;Je pense, donc je suis&quot; (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;). Descartes argued that even if he was maximally deceived (because, for example, an evil demon was manipulating all his senses) he would still know with certainty that his mind exists, because the state of being deceived requires a mind as a prerequisite.

This same general argumentative structure is still in use today. For example, in 2002 David Chalmers published an explicitly Moorean argument against illusionism. The argument goes like this: The reality of consciousness is more certain than any theoretical commitments (to, for example, physicalism) that may be motivating the illusionist to deny the existence of consciousness. The reason for this is because we have direct &quot;acquaintance&quot; with consciousness, but we do not have direct acquaintance with anything else (including anything that could inform our beliefs in consciousness being an illusion). In other words: consciousness can be known directly, so the reality of consciousness is more certain than any philosophical or scientific theory that says otherwise. Chalmers concludes that &quot;there is little doubt that something like the Moorean argument is the reason that most people reject illusionism and many find it crazy.&quot;

Eliminative materialism and illusionism have been the subject of criticism within the popular press. One highly cited example comes from the philosopher Galen Strawson who wrote an article in the New York Review of Books titled &quot;The Consciousness Deniers&quot;. In it, Strawson describes illusionism as the &quot;silliest claim ever made&quot;, next to which &quot;every known religious belief is only a little less sensible than the belief that the grass is green.&quot; Another notable example comes from Christof Koch (a neuroscientist and one of the leading proponents of Integrated Information Theory) in his popular science book &quot;The Feeling of Life Itself&quot;. In the early pages of the book, Koch describes eliminativism as the &quot;metaphysical counterpart to Cotard&#x27;s syndrome, a psychiatric condition in which patients deny being alive.&quot; Koch takes the prevalence of eliminativism as evidence that &quot;much of twentieth-century analytic philosophy has gone to the dogs&quot;.

Frankish has responded to such criticisms by asserting that “qualia realists” have to conceive of qualia as being either observational or theoretical in nature. If conceived of as observational, then they cannot claim that illusionists are leaving anything out of their theories of consciousness, as such a claim would presuppose qualia as having certain theoretical components. If conceived of as theoretical, then illusionists are simply denying the theoretical components of qualia but not the mere fact that they exist, which is what they’re attempting to explain in the first place.

===Type-B Materialism===

Type-B Materialism, also known as &quot;Weak Reductionism&quot; or &quot;A Posteriori Physicalism&quot;, is the view that the hard problem stems from human psychology, and is therefore not indicative of a genuine ontological gap between consciousness and the physical world. Like Type-A Materialists, Type-B Materialists are committed to physicalism. Unlike Type-A Materialists, however, Type-B Materialists &quot;do&quot; accept inconceivability arguments often cited in support of the hard problem, but with a key caveat: that inconceivability arguments give us insight only into how the human mind &quot;tends to conceptualize&quot; the relationship between mind and matter, but not into what the true nature of this relationship actually is. According to this view, there is a gap between two ways of knowing (introspection and neuroscience) that will not be resolved by understanding all the underlying neurobiology, but still believe that consciousness and neurobiology are one and the same in reality.

While Type-B Materialists all agree that intuitions about the hard problem are psychological rather than ontological in origin, they differ as to whether our intuitions about the hard problem are innate or culturally conditioned. This has been dubbed the &quot;hard-wired/soft-wired distinction.&quot; In relation to Type-B Materialism, those who believe that our intuitions about the hard problem are innate (and therefore common to all humans) subscribe to the &quot;hard-wired view&quot;. Those that believe our intuitions are culturally conditioned subscribe to the &quot;soft-wired view&quot;. Unless otherwise specified, the term &quot;Type-B Materialism&quot; refers to the hard-wired view.

Notable philosophers who subscribe to Type-B Materialism include David Papineau, Joseph Levine, and Janet Levine.

====The &quot;hard-wired view&quot;====
Joseph Levine (who formulated the notion of the explanatory gap) states: &quot;The explanatory gap argument doesn&#x27;t demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of nature.&quot; He nevertheless contends that full scientific understanding will not close the gap, and that analogous gaps do not exist for other identities in nature, such as that between water and H2O. The philosophers Ned Block and Robert Stalnaker agree that facts about what a conscious experience is like to the one experiencing it cannot be deduced from knowing all the facts about the underlying physiology, but by contrast argue that such gaps of knowledge &quot;are&quot; also present in many other cases in nature, such as the distinction between water and H2O.

To explain why these two ways of knowing (i.e. third-person scientific observation and first-person introspection) yield such different understandings of consciousness, weak reductionists often invoke the &quot;phenomenal concepts strategy&quot;, which argues the difference stems from our inaccurate phenomenal concepts (i.e., how we think about consciousness), not from the nature of consciousness itself. By this view, the hard problem of consciousness stems from a dualism of concepts, not from a dualism of properties or substances.

====The &quot;soft-wired view&quot;====
Some consciousness researchers have argued that the hard problem is a cultural artifact, unique to contemporary Western Culture. This is similar to Type-B Materialism, but it makes the further claim that the psychological facts that cause us to intuit the hard problem are not innate, but culturally conditioned. Notable researchers who hold this view include Anna Wierzbicka, Hakwan Lau and Matthias Michel.

Wierzbicka (who is a linguist) argues that the vocabulary used by consciousness researchers (including words like &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot;) are not universally translatable, and are &quot;parochially English.&quot; Weirzbicka calls David Chalmers out by name for using these words, arguing that if philosophers &quot;were to use panhuman concepts expressed in crosstranslatable words&quot; (such as &quot;know&quot;, &quot;think&quot;, or &quot;feel&quot;) then the hard problem would dissolve. David Chalmers has responded to these criticisms by saying that he will not &quot;apologize for using technical terms in an academic article . . . they play a key role in efficient communication in every discipline, including Wierzbicka’s&quot;.

===Type-C Materialism===

Type-C materialists acknowledge a distinction between knowledge and experience without asserting a more complete explanation for the experiential phenomenon. One taking this view would admit that there is an explanatory gap for which no answer to date may be satisfactory, but trust that inevitably the gap will be closed. This is described by analogy to progression in other areas of science, such as mass-energy equivalence which would have been unfathomable in ancient times, abiogenesis which was once considered paradoxical from an evolutionary framework, or a suspected future theory of everything combining relativity and quantum mechanics. Similarly, type-C materialism posits that the problem of consciousness is a consequence of our ignorance but just as resolvable as any other question in neuroscience.

Because the explanatory question of consciousness is evaded, type-C materialism does not presuppose the descriptive question, for instance that there is any self-consciousness, wakefulness, or even sentience in a rock. Principally, the basis for the argument arises from the apparently high correlation of consciousness with living brain tissue, thereby rejecting panpsychism without explicitly formulating physical causation. More specifically this position denies the existence of philosophical zombies for which there is an absence of data and no proposed method of testing. Whether via the inconceivability or actual nonexistence of zombies, a contradiction is exposed nullifying the premise of the consciousness problem&#x27;s &quot;hardness&quot;.

Type-C materialism is compatible with several cases and could collapse into one of these other metaphysical views depending on scientific discovery and its interpretation. With evidence of emergence, it resolves to strong reductionism under type A. With a different, possibly cultural paradigm for understanding consciousness, it resolves to type-B materialism. If consciousness is explained by the quantum mind, then it resolves to property dualism under type D. With characterization of intrinsic properties in physics extending beyond structure and dynamics, it could resolve to type-F monism.

===Type-D Dualism===

Dualism views consciousness as either a non-physical substance separate from the brain or a non-physical property of the physical brain. Dualism is the view that the mind is irreducible to the physical body. There are multiple dualist accounts of the causal relationship between the mental and the physical, of which interactionism and epiphenomenalism are the most common today. Interactionism posits that the mental and physical causally impact one another, and is associated with the thought of René Descartes (1596–1650). Epiphenomenalism holds the mental is causally dependent on the physical, but does not in turn causally impact it.

In contemporary philosophy, interactionism has been defended by philosophers including Martine Nida-Rümelin, while epiphenomenalism has been defended by philosophers including Frank Jackson (although Jackson later changed his stance to physicalism). Chalmers has also defended versions of both positions as plausible. Traditional dualists such as Descartes believed the mental and the physical to be two separate substances, or fundamental types of entities (hence &quot;substance dualism&quot;); some more recent dualists, however, accept only one substance, the physical, but state it has both mental and physical properties (hence &quot;property dualism&quot;).

===Type-E Dualism===
===Type-F Monism===

Meanwhile, panpsychism and neutral monism, broadly speaking, view consciousness as intrinsic to matter. In its most basic form, panpsychism holds that all physical entities have minds (though its proponents take more qualified positions), while neutral monism, in at least some variations, holds that entities are composed of a substance with mental and physical aspects—and is thus sometimes described as a type of panpsychism.

Forms of panpsychism and neutral monism were defended in the early twentieth century by the psychologist William James, the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, the physicist Arthur Eddington, and the philosopher Bertrand Russell, and interest in these views has been revived in recent decades by philosophers including Thomas Nagel, Galen Strawson, Philip Goff, and David Chalmers. Chalmers describes his overall view as &quot;naturalistic dualism&quot;, but he says panpsychism is in a sense a form of physicalism, as does Strawson. Proponents of panpsychism argue it solves the hard problem of consciousness parsimoniously by making consciousness a fundamental feature of reality.

====Idealism and cosmopsychism====

A traditional solution to the hard problem is idealism, according to which consciousness is fundamental and not simply an emergent property of matter. It is claimed that this avoids the hard problem entirely. Objective idealism and cosmopsychism consider mind or consciousness to be the fundamental substance of the universe. Proponents claim that this approach is immune to both the hard problem of consciousness and the combination problem that affects panpsychism.

From an idealist perspective, matter is a representation or image of mental processes. Supporters suggest that this avoids the problems associated with the materialist view of mind as an emergent property of a physical brain. Critics argue that this then leads to a decombination problem: how is it possible to split a single, universal conscious experience into multiple, distinct conscious experiences? In response, Bernardo Kastrup claims that nature hints at a mechanism for this in the condition dissociative identity disorder (previously known as Multiple Personality Disorder). Kastrup proposes dissociation as an example from nature showing that multiple minds with their own individual subjective experience could develop within a single universal mind.

Cognitive psychologist Donald D. Hoffman uses a mathematical model based around conscious agents, within a fundamentally conscious universe, to support conscious realism as a description of nature—one that falls within the objective idealism approaches to the hard problem: &quot;The objective world, i.e., the world whose existence does not depend on the perceptions of a particular conscious agent, consists entirely of conscious agents.&quot;

David Chalmers calls this form of idealism one of &quot;the handful of promising approaches to the mind–body problem.&quot;

===New mysterianism===

New mysterianism, most significantly associated with the philosopher Colin McGinn, proposes that the human mind, in its current form, will not be able to explain consciousness. McGinn draws on Noam Chomsky&#x27;s distinction between problems, which are in principle solvable, and mysteries, which human cognitive faculties are unequipped to ever understand, and places the mind–body problem in the latter category. His position is that a naturalistic explanation does exist but that the human mind is cognitively closed to it due to its limited range of intellectual abilities. He cites Jerry Fodor&#x27;s concept of the modularity of mind in support of cognitive closure.

While in McGinn&#x27;s strong form, new mysterianism states that the relationship between consciousness and the material world can &quot;never&quot; be understood by the human mind, there are also weaker forms that argue it cannot be understood within existing paradigms but that advances in science or philosophy may open the way to other solutions (see above). The ideas of Thomas Nagel and Joseph Levine fall into the second category. Steven Pinker has also endorsed this weaker version of the view, summarizing it as follows:

And then there is the theory put forward by philosopher Colin McGinn that our vertigo when pondering the Hard Problem is itself a quirk of our brains. The brain is a product of evolution, and just as animal brains have their limitations, we have ours. Our brains can&#x27;t hold a hundred numbers in memory, can&#x27;t visualize seven-dimensional space and perhaps can&#x27;t intuitively grasp why neural information processing observed from the outside should give rise to subjective experience on the inside. This is where I place my bet, though I admit that the theory could be demolished when an unborn genius—a Darwin or Einstein of consciousness—comes up with a flabbergasting new idea that suddenly makes it all clear to us.

=== Commentary on the problem&#x27;s explanatory targets ===
Philosopher Raamy Majeed argued in 2016 that the hard problem is associated with two &quot;explanatory targets&quot;:
#[PQ] Physical processing gives rise to experiences with a phenomenal character.
#[Q] Our phenomenal qualities are thus-and-so.

The first fact concerns the relationship between the physical and the phenomenal (i.e., how and why are some physical states felt states), whereas the second concerns the very nature of the phenomenal itself (i.e., what does the felt state feel like?).

Wolfgang Fasching argues that the hard problem is not about qualia, but about the what-it-is-like-ness of experience in Nagel&#x27;s sense—about the givenness of phenomenal contents:

Today there is a strong tendency to simply &quot;equate&quot; consciousness with the qualia. Yet there is clearly something not quite right about this. The &quot;itchiness of itches&quot; and the &quot;hurtfulness of pain&quot; are qualities we are conscious &quot;of&quot;. So philosophy of mind tends to treat consciousness as if it consisted simply of the contents of consciousness (the phenomenal qualities), while it really is precisely &quot;consciousness&quot; of contents, the very givenness of whatever is subjectively given. And therefore the problem of consciousness does not pertain so much to some alleged &quot;mysterious, nonpublic objects&quot;, i.e. objects that seem to be only &quot;visible&quot; to the respective subject, but rather to the nature of &quot;seeing&quot; itself (and in today’s philosophy of mind astonishingly little is said about the latter).

==Relationship to scientific frameworks==
Most neuroscientists and cognitive scientists believe that Chalmers&#x27; alleged &quot;hard problem&quot; will be solved, or be shown to not be a real problem, in the course of the solution of the so-called &quot;easy problems&quot;, although a significant minority disagrees.

===Neural correlates of consciousness===

Since 1990, researchers including the molecular biologist Francis Crick and the neuroscientist Christof Koch have made significant progress toward identifying which neurobiological events occur concurrently to the experience of subjective consciousness. These postulated events are referred to as &quot;neural correlates of consciousness&quot; or NCCs. However, this research arguably addresses the question of &quot;which&quot; neurobiological mechanisms are linked to consciousness but not the question of &quot;why&quot; they should give rise to consciousness at all, the latter being the hard problem of consciousness as Chalmers formulated it. In &quot;On the Search for the Neural Correlate of Consciousness&quot;, Chalmers said he is confident that, granting the principle that something such as what he terms &quot;global availability&quot; can be used as an indicator of consciousness, the neural correlates will be discovered &quot;in a century or two&quot;. Nevertheless, he stated regarding their relationship to the hard problem of consciousness:

One can always ask why these processes of availability should give rise to consciousness in the first place. As yet we cannot explain why they do so, and it may well be that full details about the processes of availability will still fail to answer this question. Certainly, nothing in the standard methodology I have outlined answers the question; that methodology assumes a relation between availability and consciousness, and therefore does nothing to explain it. [...] So the hard problem remains. But who knows: Somewhere along the line we may be led to the relevant insights that show why the link is there, and the hard problem may then be solved.

The neuroscientist and Nobel laureate Eric Kandel wrote that locating the NCCs would not solve the hard problem, but rather one of the so-called easy problems to which the hard problem is contrasted. Kandel went on to note Crick and Koch&#x27;s suggestion that once the binding problem—understanding what accounts for the unity of experience—is solved, it will be possible to solve the hard problem empirically. However, neuroscientist Anil Seth argued that emphasis on the so-called hard problem is a distraction from what he calls the &quot;real problem&quot;: understanding the neurobiology underlying consciousness, namely the neural correlates of various conscious processes. This more modest goal is the focus of most scientists working on consciousness. Psychologist Susan Blackmore believes, by contrast, that the search for the neural correlates of consciousness is futile and itself predicated on an erroneous belief in the hard problem of consciousness.

===Computational cognition===
A functionalist view in cognitive science holds that the mind is an information processing system, and that cognition and consciousness together are a form of computation. Cognition, distinct from consciousness, is explained by neural computation in the computational theory of cognition. The computational theory of mind asserts that not only cognition, but also phenomenal consciousness or qualia, are computational. While the computation system is realized by neurons rather than electronics, in theory it would be possible for artificial intelligence to be conscious.

===Integrated information theory===

Integrated information theory (IIT), developed by the neuroscientist and psychiatrist Giulio Tononi in 2004 and more recently also advocated by Koch, is one of the most discussed models of consciousness in neuroscience and elsewhere. The theory proposes an identity between consciousness and integrated information, with the latter item (denoted as Φ) defined mathematically and thus in principle measurable. The hard problem of consciousness, write Tononi and Koch, may indeed be intractable when working from matter to consciousness. However, because IIT inverts this relationship and works from phenomenological axioms to matter, they say it could be able to solve the hard problem. In this vein, proponents have said the theory goes beyond identifying human neural correlates and can be extrapolated to all physical systems. Tononi wrote (along with two colleagues):

While identifying the &quot;neural correlates of consciousness&quot; is undoubtedly important, it is hard to see how it could ever lead to a satisfactory explanation of what consciousness is and how it comes about. As will be illustrated below, IIT offers a way to analyze systems of mechanisms to determine if they are properly structured to give rise to consciousness, how much of it, and of which kind.

As part of a broader critique of IIT, Michael Cerullo suggested that the theory&#x27;s proposed explanation is in fact for what he dubs (following Scott Aaronson) the &quot;Pretty Hard Problem&quot; of methodically inferring which physical systems are conscious—but would not solve Chalmers&#x27; hard problem. &quot;Even if IIT is correct,&quot; he argues, &quot;it does not explain why integrated information generates (or is) consciousness.&quot; Chalmers agrees that IIT, if correct, would solve the &quot;Pretty Hard Problem&quot; rather than the hard problem.

===Global workspace theory===
Global workspace theory (GWT) is a cognitive architecture and theory of consciousness proposed by the cognitive psychologist Bernard Baars in 1988. Baars explains the theory with the metaphor of a theater, with conscious processes represented by an illuminated stage. This theater integrates inputs from a variety of unconscious and otherwise autonomous networks in the brain and then broadcasts them to unconscious networks (represented in the metaphor by a broad, unlit &quot;audience&quot;). The theory has since been expanded upon by other scientists including cognitive neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene.

In his original paper outlining the hard problem of consciousness, Chalmers discussed GWT as a theory that only targets one of the &quot;easy problems&quot; of consciousness. In particular, he said GWT provided a promising account of how information in the brain could become globally accessible, but argued that &quot;now the question arises in a different form: why should global accessibility give rise to conscious experience? As always, this bridging question is unanswered.&quot; J. W. Dalton similarly criticized GWT on the grounds that it provides, at best, an account of the cognitive &quot;function&quot; of consciousness, and fails to explain its experiential aspect. By contrast, A. C. Elitzur argued: &quot;While [GWT] does not address the &#x27;hard problem&#x27;, namely, the very nature of consciousness, it constrains any theory that attempts to do so and provides important insights into the relation between consciousness and cognition.&quot;

For his part, Baars writes (along with two colleagues) that there is no hard problem of explaining qualia over and above the problem of explaining causal functions, because qualia are entailed by neural activity and themselves causal. Dehaene, in his 2014 book &quot;Consciousness and the Brain&quot;, rejected the concept of qualia and argued that Chalmers&#x27; &quot;easy problems&quot; of consciousness are actually the hard problems. He further stated that the &quot;hard problem&quot; is based only upon ill-defined intuitions that are continually shifting as understanding evolves:

Once our intuitions are educated by cognitive neuroscience and computer simulations, Chalmers&#x27; hard problem will evaporate. The hypothetical concept of qualia, pure mental experience, detached from any information-processing role, will be viewed as a peculiar idea of the prescientific era, much like vitalism... [Just as science dispatched vitalism] the science of consciousness will keep eating away at the hard problem of consciousness until it vanishes.

==Meta-problem==
In 2018, Chalmers highlighted what he calls the &quot;meta-problem of consciousness&quot;, another problem related to the hard problem of consciousness:

The meta-problem of consciousness is (to a first approximation) the problem of explaining why we think that there is a [hard] problem of consciousness.

In his &quot;second approximation&quot;, he says it is the problem of explaining the behavior of &quot;phenomenal reports&quot;, and the behavior of expressing a belief that there is a hard problem of consciousness.

Explaining its significance, he says:
Although the meta-problem is strictly speaking an easy problem, it is deeply connected to the hard problem. We can reasonably hope that a solution to the meta-problem will shed significant light on the hard problem. A particularly strong line holds that a solution to the meta-problem will solve or dissolve the hard problem. A weaker line holds that it will not remove the hard problem, but it will constrain the form of a solution.In other words, the &#x27;strong line&#x27; holds that the solution to the meta-problem would provide an explanation of our beliefs about consciousness that is independent of consciousness. That would debunk our beliefs about consciousness, in the same way that explaining beliefs about god in evolutionary terms may provide arguments against theism itself.

==In popular culture==
Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;The Hard Problem&quot;, first produced in 2015, is named after the hard problem of consciousness, which Stoppard defines as having &quot;subjective First Person experiences&quot;.

* -à (Catalan) feminine -ana &quot;of or from [a locality or place]&quot; (Català -Catalan); and also the name of a job (Manyà -irosmith), from Latin -ānus, -āna

* -aitis (Lithuanian) &quot;son of&quot;
** -aitė (Lithuanian) signifies an unmarried female
*** -aty Americanized form
* -aj (Albanian) (pronounced AY; meaning “of the&quot; ) It denotes the name of the family, which mostly comes from the male founder of the family, but also from a place, as in, Lash-aj (from the village Lashaj of Kastrat, MM, Shkodër). It is likely that its ancient form, still found in MM, was an [i] in front of the last name, as in ‘Déda i Lékajve’ (Déd of Lekës). For ease of use, the [i] in front of the last name, and the ending _ve, were dropped. If the last name ends in [a], then removing the [j] would give the name of the patriarch or the place, as in, Grudaj - j = Gruda (place in MM). Otherwise, removing the whole ending [aj] yields the name of founder or place of origin, as in Lekaj - aj = Lek(ë). Since the names are found most commonly in Malsi e Madhe (North) and Labëri (South), it is likely that this linguistic feature is very old. It must have been lost as a result of foreign influences brought into Albania by the invaders.

<text>Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, 1st Baronet, (6 July 1834 – 12 December 1890) was an Austrian-born British medallist and sculptor, best known for the &quot;Jubilee head&quot; of Queen Victoria on coinage, and the statue of the Duke of Wellington at Hyde Park Corner. During his career Boehm maintained a large studio in London and produced a significant volume of public works and private commissions. A speciality of Boehm&#x27;s was the portrait bust; there are many examples of these in the National Portrait Gallery. He was often commissioned by the Royal Family and members of the aristocracy to make sculptures for their parks and gardens. His works were many, and he exhibited 123 of them at the Royal Academy from 1862 to his death in 1890.

==Biography==

Boehm (originally &quot;Böhm&quot;) was born in Vienna of Hungarian parentage. His father, Josef Daniel Böhm, was a court medal maker and the director of the imperial mint in Vienna. From 1848 to 1851 Boehm studied in London at Leigh&#x27;s academy of art, the forerunner of the Heatherley School of Fine Art. He then returned to Vienna where he studied model making and medal design at the Academy of Fine Arts before working in Italy and then, from 1859 to 1862 in Paris. In 1856, in Vienna, he was presented with the First Imperial Prize for Sculpture.

In 1862, Boehm settled in London, where he exhibited coins and medals at the 1862 International Exhibition, opened a studio and had his first work, a terracotta bust, shown at the Royal Academy. Throughout the 1860s, Boehm, who became a British subject in 1865, devoted his time to the production of portrait busts plus equestrian statues and statuettes. His portrait subjects included John Everett Millais, Stratford Canning and Charles Thomas Newton and Franz Liszt. Boehm&#x27;s statuette of William Makepiece Thackeray, although completed after the author&#x27;s death, was considered such a good likeness that several copies were made including examples for the Garrick Club and for the Athenaeum.

Boehm was often commissioned by members of the aristocracy to make equestrian and equine sculptures for the parks and gardens of their stately homes. His large sculpture of the stallion King Tom (1874) was commissioned by Baron Mayer Amschel de Rothschild for his new mansion, Mentmore Towers in 1873, and moved to Dalmeny House near Edinburgh in 1982. His large animal works include the marble &quot;Young Bull and Herdsman&quot; (1887) and &quot;Saint George and the Dragon&quot; (1885), both of which were exhibited at the Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition during 1888 and 1889. Both remain in Australia, the former at The Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria, Melbourne. &quot;The Horse and His Master&quot; (1874), sometimes known as &quot;A Clydesdale Stallion Rearing&quot;, in Malvern and Brueton Park in Solihull was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1874 and at the 1878 Paris Universal Exposition. The work was bought by the grandson of Alfred Bird, Captain Oliver Bird for £300 in April 1944 and gifted to Solihull Council to place in one of their parks.

In 1869, Boehm&#x27;s work came to the attention of Queen Victoria and he rapidly gained favour with the royal court. In 1871, he executed a statue of Victoria, in marble for Windsor Castle, which with the monument of the Prince Edward in St. George&#x27;s Chapel in Windsor Castle, are considered his earliest great works. In total, throughout his career, Boehm completed over forty royal commissions. He won several commissions to create statues of Victoria to mark her Golden Jubilee, several of which were replica designs, which was a common and accepted practice at the time. Victoria made clear her approval of Boehm&#x27;s work by unveiling his statues of her at Windsor and Balmoral which added to the appeal of his work to the local and colonial authorities who typically commissioned such monuments.

During his career Boehm maintained a large studio in London and produced a significant volume of work, including at least fifty-seven public statues and monuments. In total over 350 sculptures have been attributed to Boehm. In 1874 Boehm completed a substantial statue of John Bunyan (1628–1688) which was unveiled on 10 June at St Peter&#x27;s Green, Bedford, by Lady Augusta Stanley, before a crowd of 10,000. There are many statues by Boehm in London. His equestrian statue of the Duke of Wellington at Hyde Park Corner, unveiled in 1888 was commissioned to compensate for the removal of the colossal sculpture of the Duke by Matthew Cotes Wyatt from the nearby Wellington Arch to Aldershot.

Boehm&#x27;s designs were used on a series of medals minted to mark events in the Queen&#x27;s reign. These included the Golden Jubilee, her Diamond Jubilee and for the Visit to Ireland Medal 1900. In 1887, Boehm designed and executed the model for the dies for a series of coins known as the Jubilee coinage, commemorating the 50th anniversary of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign. The coins are signed J.E.B. below the shoulder. This design was severely criticised by his peers as well as the public and was replaced in 1893. The coins depicted the royal arms in the Order of the Garter on the reverse. As a result, the sixpences were frequently gilded and passed off as gold half sovereigns. Therefore, the sixpence reverted to its standard design.

Boehm&#x27;s early portrait busts led, later in his career, to him undertaking a total of fifty-seven church monuments and memorial works, including several in British cathedrals. For the memorial to General Charles George Gordon in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, he carved an effigy of Gordon recumbent on a sarcophagus. On the death of Dean Stanley, Boehm was commissioned to execute his sarcophagus in Westminster Abbey. The Abbey also houses Boehm&#x27;s memorials to Lord Beaconsfield and to Viscount Canning, plus his marble statue of the Earl of Shaftesbury. His monument to Archbishop Tait is in Canterbury Cathedral. A number of Boehm&#x27;s sculptures were reproduced in popular small-scale bronze editions. These included the soldier figures from the Wellington monument and a &quot;St. George and the Dragon&quot; group piece.

Boehm became an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1878, was appointed sculptor-in-ordinary to the Queen in 1881 and was elected a full member of the Royal Academy in 1882. In 1889, he was created a baronet, of Wetherby Gardens in the Parish of St Mary Abbots, Kensington (from 1883 Boehm lived at 25 Wetherby Gardens, a house designed for him by Robert William Edis and built by William Willett). Boehm encouraged and supported several younger artists and sculptors, most notably Édouard Lantéri, Alfred Gilbert and Alfred Drury. Boehm was instrumental in Gilbert being awarded the commission for the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain in Piccadilly Circus while both Lantéri and Drury worked in Boehm&#x27;s studio for a time. Boehm&#x27;s most famous pupil was the Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, daughter of Queen Victoria. She was at his house, at 76 Fulham Road in London, when Boehm died suddenly on 12 December 1890, provoking press speculation about a sexual relationship between the two. According to historian Lucinda Hawksley, the two had a long-lasting love affair.

There is a memorial to Boehm in the crypt of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London.

<doc id="634233" wikidata="Q2878515" url="?curid=634233" title="Analytical hierarchy">
<text>In mathematical logic and descriptive set theory, the analytical hierarchy is an extension of the arithmetical hierarchy. The analytical hierarchy of formulas includes formulas in the language of second-order arithmetic, which can have quantifiers over both the set of natural numbers, formula_1, and over functions from formula_1 to formula_1. The analytical hierarchy of sets classifies sets by the formulas that can be used to define them; it is the lightface version of the projective hierarchy.

== The analytical hierarchy of formulas ==
The notation formula_4
indicates the class of formulas in the language of second-order arithmetic with number quantifiers but no set quantifiers. This language does not contain set parameters. The Greek letters here are lightface symbols, indicating the language choice. Each corresponding boldface symbol denotes the corresponding class of formulas in the extended language with a parameter for each real; see projective hierarchy for details.

A formula in the language of second-order arithmetic is defined to be formula_5 if it is logically equivalent to a formula of the form formula_6 where formula_7 is formula_8. A formula is defined to be formula_9 if it is logically equivalent to a formula of the form formula_10 where formula_7 is formula_12. This inductive definition defines the classes formula_13 and formula_14 for every natural number formula_15.

Kuratowski and Tarski showed in 1931 that every formula in the language of second-order arithmetic has a prenex normal form, and therefore is formula_13 or formula_14 for some formula_15. Because meaningless quantifiers can be added to any formula, once a formula is given the classification formula_13 or formula_14 for some formula_15 it will be given the classifications formula_22 and formula_23 for all formula_24 greater than formula_15.

== The analytical hierarchy of sets of natural numbers ==
A set of natural numbers is assigned the classification formula_13 if it is definable by a formula_13 formula (with one free number variable and no free set variables). The set is assigned the classification formula_14 if it is definable by a formula_14 formula. If the set is both formula_13 and formula_14 then it is given the additional classification formula_32.

The formula_33 sets are called hyperarithmetical. An alternate classification of these sets by way of iterated computable functionals is provided by the hyperarithmetical theory.

== The analytical hierarchy on subsets of Cantor and Baire space ==
The analytical hierarchy can be defined on any effective Polish space; the definition is particularly simple for Cantor and Baire space because they fit with the language of ordinary second-order arithmetic. Cantor space is the set of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s; Baire space is the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. These are both Polish spaces.

The ordinary axiomatization of second-order arithmetic uses a set-based language in which the set quantifiers can naturally be viewed as quantifying over Cantor space. A subset of Cantor space is assigned the classification formula_13 if it is definable by a formula_13 formula (with one free set variable and no free number variables). The set is assigned the classification formula_14 if it is definable by a formula_14 formula. If the set is both formula_13 and formula_14 then it is given the additional classification formula_32.

A subset of Baire space has a corresponding subset of Cantor space under the map that takes each function from formula_41 to formula_41 to the characteristic function of its graph. A subset of Baire space is given the classification formula_13, formula_14, or formula_32 if and only if the corresponding subset of Cantor space has the same classification. An equivalent definition of the analytical hierarchy on Baire space is given by defining the analytical hierarchy of formulas using a functional version of second-order arithmetic; then the analytical hierarchy on subsets of Cantor space can be defined from the hierarchy on Baire space. This alternate definition gives exactly the same classifications as the first definition.

Because Cantor space is homeomorphic to any finite Cartesian power of itself, and Baire space is homeomorphic to any finite Cartesian power of itself, the analytical hierarchy applies equally well to finite Cartesian powers of one of these spaces.
A similar extension is possible for countable powers and to products of powers of Cantor space and powers of Baire space.

== Extensions ==
As is the case with the arithmetical hierarchy, a relativized version of the analytical hierarchy can be defined. The language is extended to add a constant set symbol &quot;A&quot;. A formula in the extended language is inductively defined to be formula_46 or formula_47 using the same inductive definition as above. Given a set formula_48, a set is defined to be formula_49 if it is definable by a formula_46 formula in which the symbol formula_51 is interpreted as formula_48; similar definitions for formula_53 and formula_54 apply. The sets that are formula_49 or formula_53, for any parameter &quot;Y&quot;, are classified in the projective hierarchy, and often denoted by boldface Greek letters to indicate the use of parameters.

== Examples ==
* For a relation formula_57 on formula_58, the statement &quot;formula_57 is a well-order on formula_60&quot; is formula_61. (Not to be confused with the general case for well-founded relations on sets, see Lévy hierarchy)
* The set of all natural numbers that are indices of computable ordinals is a formula_62 set that is not formula_63.
**These sets are exactly the formula_64-recursively-enumerable subsets of formula_41. [Bar75, p. 168]
* A function formula_66 is definable by Herbrand&#x27;s 1931 formalism of systems of equations if and only if formula_67 is hyperarithmetical.
* The set of continuous functions formula_68 that have the mean value property is no lower than formula_69 on the hierarchy.
* The set of elements of Cantor space that are the characteristic functions of well orderings of formula_41 is a formula_62 set that is not formula_63. In fact, this set is not formula_73 for any element formula_48 of Baire space.
* If the axiom of constructibility holds then there is a subset of the product of the Baire space with itself that is formula_75 and is the graph of a well ordering of Baire space. If the axiom holds then there is also a formula_75 well ordering of Cantor space.

== Properties ==
For each formula_15 we have the following strict containments:

:formula_78,
:formula_79,
:formula_80,
:formula_81.

A set that is in formula_13 for some &quot;n&quot; is said to be analytical. Care is required to distinguish this usage from the term analytic set, which has a different meaning, namely formula_83.

<text>Highway 17 is a provincial highway in British Columbia, Canada. It comprises two separate sections connected by a ferry link. The Vancouver Island section is known as the Patricia Bay Highway and connects Victoria to the Swartz Bay ferry terminal in North Saanich. The Lower Mainland section is known as the South Fraser Perimeter Road and connects the Tsawwassen ferry terminal to Delta and Surrey, terminating at an interchange with Highway 1 in the Fraser Valley.

==Route description==

===Vancouver Island section===

The Island section of Highway 17 is known as the Patricia Bay Highway (locally abbreviated as the Pat Bay Highway) after nearby Patricia Bay, and is the main artery through the Saanich Peninsula, mostly travelling along its eastern coast. The highway is four lanes all the way from Victoria to Swartz Bay. The total length of the highway on the Island is . Highway 17 has had its present course through the area since 1978 when the Blanshard extension was completed.

In the south, Highway 17 begins at the intersection of Belleville and Oswego streets, at the entrance to the Victoria Harbour ferry terminal, which provides a ferry connection to Port Angeles, Washington. It travels east for , past the grounds of the British Columbia Parliament Buildings, to Douglas Street where it intersects the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1). It travels another east, where the highway turns north as Blanshard Street (a six lane divided city street) for through the city of Victoria before leaving the city at Tolmie Avenue and for another north through the district of Saanich to the Uptown Shopping Centre; Highway 17 then becomes the Pat Bay Highway and turns into a -long freeway, with three interchanges. After the third interchange at Royal Oak Drive, Highway 17 turns into a mix of divided four-lane arterial and expressway including an interchange at McTavish Road, until it reaches the town of Sidney. After exiting Sidney later, the Pat Bay once again becomes a freeway, with two more interchanges along its length, toward its northern terminus at the Swartz Bay ferry terminal another north.

===Ferry route===

At Swartz Bay, Highway 17 leaves Vancouver Island, and starts on a 44 km (24 nmi)-long ferry route through the Southern Gulf Islands and the Strait of Georgia. The ferry route between Swartz Bay and the Mainland is the oldest and most heavily used route in the B.C. Ferries system. After winding through the Gulf Islands, the route enters a small passage between Galiano and Mayne Islands, known as Active Pass. Active Pass is the midway point on the Highway 17 ferry route, but it is also the most hazardous part, as it has strong tidal currents, and has historically been the site of two maritime collisions involving BC Ferries vessels, as well as one incident of a ferry running aground. Consequently, ferries going through Active Pass have to sound their whistles upon entering and leaving the passage, and must adhere to a lower speed limit while transiting through it.

After Active Pass, the Highway 17 ferry heads due northeast across the Strait of Georgia. Halfway across the Strait, the route begins transiting United States waters for just under 9 km (5 nmi). It then crosses the 49th parallel back into Canadian waters just before landing at the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal.

===Mainland section===

On the Mainland, Highway 17 is known as the South Fraser Perimeter Road (SFPR), a component of the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation&#x27;s Gateway Program. It is a four-lane highway with a mix of freeway and expressway sections. The highway has a speed limit of over most of its length, connecting the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal and Highway 99 in Delta to Highway 1 at 176th Street in Surrey, and providing access to all five of the major Fraser River crossings in Metro Vancouver. The mainland section is notable for its extensive use of noise walls, split level construction through Delta and use in some urban sections of so-called Quiet Pavement to reduce traffic noise.

The South Fraser Perimeter Road is long. Beginning at the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal, it heads northeast on a long causeway to land on the Tsawwassen Peninsula, then continues northeast for to an interchange with Highway 17A. It then follows the CN Railway&#x27;s Deltaport chord and 72nd Street northeast for to an interchange with Highway 99. The road then runs through the west side of Burns Bog, but avoiding the conservation area, and past the south side of the Tilbury and Sunbury industrial areas for before it reaches the Fraser River at an interchange connecting to Highway 91 via Highway 91 Connector. It then proceeds east along the south bank of the Fraser River through North Delta and Surrey, passing under the Alex Fraser, Pattullo and Port Mann bridges, before turning southeast at Surrey Bend Regional Park to terminate at its junction with Highway 1 and Highway 15, from Highway 91 Connector.

==History==
=== Vancouver Island Section ===
Prior to 1978, the southern terminus of Highway 17 was at the present-day intersection of Highway 1 (Douglas Street) and Carey Road. In 1978, the highway was extended and aligned along Blanshard Street through Downtown Victoria to the Inner Harbour in an effort to improve traffic flow.

=== South Fraser Perimeter Road ===
Route 17 once followed what is now Route 17A and terminated at the Highway 99 interchange before the George Massey Tunnel. The provincial government proposed to build a new expressway, the South Fraser Perimeter Road (SFPR), linking the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal with the Trans-Canada Highway. According to the Ministry of Transportation, the South Fraser Perimeter Road will improve the movement of goods and people across the region while also alleviating truck traffic on municipal roads. West–east travel times across the region will also be significantly reduced.

The South Fraser Perimeter Road project was opposed by a number of groups, citing a variety of concerns. The SFPR alignment does not go through the Burns Bog Ecological Conservancy Area. However, the Burns Bog Conservation Society has stated they are concerned that it will affect surrounding hydrology, and have an adverse effect on the Conservancy Area.

The Burns Bog Conservation Society expressed concerns that the South Fraser Perimeter Road would endanger Burns Bog. In response to the mitigation measures proposed the Environmental Stewardship Branch of Environment Canada wrote that &quot;... the changes are not sufficient to alleviate its concerns related to the impacts of the Project on Pacific Water Shrew (PWS), hydrology, aerial deposition, and ecological integrity of Burns Bog.&quot; On November 24, 2010 the Burns Bog Conservation Society launched a lawsuit intend to force the re-routing or cancellation of the SFPR project. Burns Bog has been listed as threatened by the International Mire Conservation Group because of the impacts of the SFPR.

The Wilderness Committee and other groups have criticized the SFPR, and the Gateway Program in general, for increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In early 2011, a protest camp organized by StopThePave.org and the Council of Canadians occupied a SFPR construction site for almost two weeks.

The SFPR Project worked with the Burns Bog Scientific Advisory Panel to develop systems, which helped improve the existing drainage / hydrology of the bog.

A portion from 136 Street in Surrey to a junction with Highway 15 and Highway 1 was the first portion of the SFPR to be completed, opening on December 1, 2012. The remaining western segment of the road was completed on December 21, 2013. The former Mainland portion of Highway 17 north of the 28th Avenue overpass has been renamed to Highway 17A through Ladner. The total cost of building the SFPR was $1.26 billion.

On March 10, 2017, an announcement was made to address congestion at Highway 17 (Delta): an extension of westbound slip lane from Tilbury Connector (80th Avenue) intersection, replacement of the traffic light-controlled Highway 91 Connector with an interchange, and construction of a new interchange at River Road. This would make the road a freeway all the way to Tannery Road. Funding will come from the Canadian government, the BC Government, the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, and the Tsawwassen First Nation; the total cost is expected to be just over $245 million. Construction started in spring 2020 and the new River Road interchange opened on December 3, 2021. The new Highway 91 Connector interchange reached completion in November 2022.

==Future==
On Vancouver Island, there have been numerous studies to upgrade the Island portion of Highway 17 to freeway standard. This seems to be edging closer with the BC Government&#x27;s issuing of the Highway 17 Corridor Planning Strategy. This study envisions interchanges at Haliburton, Sayward, Keating Cross Road and/or Island View, Mt Newton Cross Road, McTavish Road (Complete April 9, 2011) and Beacon Avenue in Sidney. Construction of a flyover ramp from northbound Highway 17 to Keating Cross Road commenced in June 2023.

As part of the Pattullo Bridge replacement project, the initial plan included a new interchange to provide direct connections to and from Highway 17 to the bridge as well as an extension of Scott Road north of King George Boulevard to directly connect with Highway 17 to divert traffic from local streets in Surrey. However, the project was down-scaled as the study showed Highway 17 cannot handle increased traffic from induced demand and the significant traffic delay would be expected on the provincial road network. Under the final proposal tendered in 2020, the only direct connection from the Pattullo Bridge would be from eastbound Pattullo Bridge to westbound, while Highway 17 and Old Yale Road intersection will be closed and grade-separated.

<doc id="634238" wikidata="Q2191320" url="?curid=634238" title="Shove ha'penny">
<text>Shove ha&#x27;penny (or shove halfpenny), also known in ancestral form as shoffe-grote [&#x27;shove-groat&#x27; in Modern English], slype groat [&#x27;slip groat&#x27;], and slide-thrift, is a pub game in the shuffleboard family, played predominantly in the United Kingdom. Two players or teams compete against one another using coins or discs on a tabletop board.

==Board==
Shove ha&#x27;penny is played on a small, rectangular, smooth board usually made of wood or stone. A number of parallel lines or grooves run horizontally across this board, separated by about one-and-a-half coin diameters. The spaces between the lines (usually nine) are called the &quot;beds&quot;. Five British halfpenny coins &quot;ha&#x27;pennies&quot; (now obsolete pre-decimalisation coinage, diameter 1 inch; 25mm) or similarly-sized coins or metal discs are placed one-by-one at one end of the board slightly protruding over the edge and are shoved forward toward scoring lines, with a blow from the palm of the hand. 

In the opinionated (and rare) book &quot;The Shove Ha&#x27;penny Board Displayed&quot;, author Trelawney Dayrell-Reed asserted that the best boards are made of unvarnished walnut or mahogany. In parts of Southern England, primarily Somerset, Dorset and Hampshire, the board is made of slate and lubricated with arrowroot powder or French chalk, which makes the polished ha&#x27;pennies glide with a very light touch. 

The five-coin turns are alternate, and the coins are cleared between turns, so there is no nudging of opponents&#x27; coins. Indeed, both players use the same coins, and it is a serious mistake to move the coins back to the bottom of the board before one&#x27;s opponent has had a chance to check the scoring, as they may be distracted by drinking and so suspect one of cheating. Sometimes teams compete, playing in sequence, but scoring is as for single players. Experienced players (including Dayrell-Reed) conclude that merely placing the coins between the lines is too easy so that to score they must be placed almost exactly in the centre of the bed. An exact placement by a single shove, rather than by nudging into position by subsequent shots, is called a &quot;flopper&quot; and will command applause, especially if it is a winning shot. In competition games, a scoring placement is judged by a referee. In times past, considerable sums could be wagered on games of shove ha&#x27;penny, and influencing the referee – whether actual or suspected – could result in sudden and violent confrontations. Because of this, some public houses have a strong antipathy to games of shove ha&#x27;penny and will only allow trusted locals to play, sometimes keeping the board in a back room and denying its existence to strangers. This is particularly common in the case of the Dorset long board, making it difficult even for a shove ha&#x27;penny enthusiast to ascertain how many pubs still have this archaic board. 

The Dorset long board is a somewhat different game, employing a larger board marked with a four-square and semicircles rather than horizontal lines. This board can be viewed in a British Pathé newsreel. The short-board game was regularly featured in Yorkshire TV&#x27;s &quot;Indoor League&quot; programme during the 1970s.

==Gameplay==

A player shoves five coins or metal discs (ha&#x27;pennies) up the board in each turn. To prepare each coin to be pushed, the player positions the coin at the front of the board, with the rear of the coin just sticking over the edge of the board. Any part of the hand can then be used to strike the coin, shoving it up the board. If the coin does not reach the first line on the board, that coin does not count as having been played and can be shoved again.

At the end of the turn, each coin that is completely within a &quot;bed&quot; (between two horizontal lines and within the bordering vertical lines) scores a point for that player in that bed. The points are scored with chalk marks in the squares at either end of the bed on the edge of the board, one player owning the right side, the other, the left. The aim is to get three chalk marks in each of the squares - three scores in each of the nine beds. However, once three scores have been made in a bed, any further scores in that bed will be given to the opponent instead, unless the opponent already has three scores in the bed. The one exception to this is the winning point, which must be scored properly by the winning player, not given away.

Players will attempt to cause a coin to knock onto one or more previously pushed ha&#x27;pennies in an effort to improve their position, as well as trying to make a score with the ha&#x27;penny being played. A little thought is also required – it is not usually a good move to score the third coin in a bed until towards the end of a hand, so as to set up coins in positions that will increase the chances that later coins will score by coming up from below and stopping behind the earlier coins. This is particularly true in the &quot;progressive&quot; variant of the game, where, after a player&#x27;s hand of five coins is complete, any scoring coins are recorded and then pulled back to be replayed in the same turn. A player may try to place early coins not only to promote scoring using later coins, but also in such a way as to be pushed by the later coins into positions where further scoring opportunities may be created. Thus, in this version of the game, a very gifted (and/or lucky) player could theoretically win the game in a single turn.
The game has its own body of specialised jargon, providing a host of colourful names for particular scoring opportunities, shots and board features, as well as special rules of etiquette. Trelawney Dayrell-Reed asserts (tongue in cheek) that the appropriate penalty for someone unfortunately wetting the board with a drink ring (and thus compromising its playing surface) is to be &quot;painfully destroyed without benefit of clergy.&quot;

Another important etiquette is to wipe the scoring area, after completing a game, away from the playing area as the marking chalk is coarse and interferes with the lubrication of the surface. Indeed, the condition of the surface is considered so critical that a shortage of arrowroot from St. Vincent due to crop failures proved problematic, as supplies from alternative sources did not perform well.

<doc id="634240" wikidata="Q7992045" url="?curid=634240" title="Wheel theory">
<text>A wheel is a type of algebra (in the sense of universal algebra) where division is always defined. In particular, division by zero is meaningful. The real numbers can be extended to a wheel, as can any commutative ring.

The term &quot;wheel&quot; is inspired by the topological picture formula_1 of the real projective line together with an extra point ⊥ (bottom element) such that formula_2.

A wheel can be regarded as the equivalent of a commutative ring (and semiring) where addition and multiplication are not a group but respectively a commutative monoid and a commutative monoid with involution.

== Definition ==
A wheel is an algebraic structure formula_3, in which
* formula_4 is a set,
* formula_5 and formula_6 are elements of that set,
* formula_7 and formula_8 are binary operations,
* formula_9 is a unary operation,
and satisfying the following properties:
* formula_7 and formula_8 are each commutative and associative, and have formula_12 and formula_6 as their respective identities.
* formula_9 is an involution, for example formula_15
* formula_9 is multiplicative, for example formula_17
* formula_18
* formula_19
* formula_20
* formula_21
* formula_22
* formula_23

== Algebra of wheels ==
Wheels replace the usual division as a binary operation with multiplication, with a unary operation applied to one argument formula_24 similar (but not identical) to the multiplicative inverse formula_25, such that formula_26 becomes shorthand for formula_27, but neither formula_28 nor formula_29 in general, and modifies the rules of algebra such that
* formula_30 in the general case
* formula_31 in the general case, as formula_24 is not the same as the multiplicative inverse of formula_33.

Other identities that may be derived are
* formula_34
* formula_35
* formula_36
where the negation formula_37 is defined by formula_38 and formula_39 if there is an element formula_40 such that formula_41 (thus in the general case formula_42).

However, for values of formula_33 satisfying formula_44 and formula_45, we get the usual
* formula_46
* formula_47

If negation can be defined as above then the subset formula_48 is a commutative ring, and every commutative ring is such a subset of a wheel. If formula_33 is an invertible element of the commutative ring then formula_50. Thus, whenever formula_25 makes sense, it is equal to formula_24, but the latter is always defined, even when formula_53.

== Examples ==
=== Wheel of fractions ===
Let formula_54 be a commutative ring, and let formula_55 be a multiplicative submonoid of formula_54. Define the congruence relation formula_57 on formula_58 via
: formula_59 means that there exist formula_60 such that formula_61.
Define the &quot;wheel of fractions&quot; of formula_54 with respect to formula_55 as the quotient formula_64 (and denoting the equivalence class containing formula_65 as formula_66) with the operations
: formula_67 (additive identity)
: formula_68 (multiplicative identity)
: formula_69 (reciprocal operation)
: formula_70 (addition operation)
: formula_71 (multiplication operation)

In general, this structure is not a ring unless it is trivial, as formula_72 in the usual sense - here with formula_73 we get formula_74, although that implies that formula_57 is an improper relation on our wheel formula_4.

This follows from the fact that formula_77, which is also not true in general.
=== Projective line and Riemann sphere ===
The special case of the above starting with a field produces a projective line extended to a wheel by adjoining a bottom element noted ⊥, where formula_78. The projective line is itself an extension of the original field by an element formula_79, where formula_80 for any element formula_81 in the field. However, formula_82 is still undefined on the projective line, but is defined in its extension to a wheel.

Starting with the real numbers, the corresponding projective &quot;line&quot; is geometrically a circle, and then the extra point formula_82 gives the shape that is the source of the term &quot;wheel&quot;. Or starting with the complex numbers instead, the corresponding projective &quot;line&quot; is a sphere (the Riemann sphere), and then the extra point gives a 3-dimensional version of a wheel.

<text>Pieter Bleeker (10 July 1819 – 24 January 1878) was a Dutch medical doctor, ichthyologist, and herpetologist. He was famous for the &quot;Atlas Ichthyologique des Indes Orientales Néêrlandaises&quot;, his monumental work on the fishes of East Asia published between 1862 and 1877.

==Life and work==
Bleeker was born on 10 July 1819 in Zaandam. He was employed as a medical officer in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army from 1842 to 1860, stationed in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). During that time, he did most of his ichthyology work, besides his duties in the army. He acquired many of his specimens from local fishermen, but he also built up an extended network of contacts who would send him specimens from various government outposts throughout the islands. During his time in Indonesia, he collected well over 12,000 specimens, many of which currently reside at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden. Bleeker corresponded with Auguste Duméril of Paris. His work in ichthyology and tropical medicine was recognised by two doctorates honoris causa (Leyden University, 1846; Utrecht University, 1849).

After his return to the Netherlands in 1860, he started publishing the &quot;Atlas Ichthyologique des Indes Orientales Néêrlandaises&quot;, a comprehensive account of his studies done in Indonesia, featuring over 1,500 illustrations. It was published in 36 volumes between 1862 and his death in 1878. Between 1977 and 1983, the Smithsonian republished the work in 10 volumes.

Bleeker published more than 500 papers on ichthyology, describing 511 new genera and 1,925 new species.

He also worked in herpetology, describing at least 14 species of reptiles, most of them described in &quot;Reptilien van Agam&quot;.

In 1855, he became correspondent of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, department Natuurkunde (then Natural Sciences), and in 1862 a member. In 1856, he was elected correspondent for the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle in Paris. In January 1864 he received a French knighthood of the Légion d&#x27;honneur. He was president of the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies.

Bleeker died on 24 January 1878 in The Hague.

<doc id="634247" wikidata="Q706422" url="?curid=634247" title="Hank Thompson (musician)">
<text>Henry William Thompson (September 3, 1925 – November 6, 2007) was an American country music singer-songwriter and musician whose career spanned seven decades.

Thompson&#x27;s musical style, characterized as honky-tonk Western swing, was a mixture of fiddles, electric guitar, and steel guitar that featured his distinctive, smooth baritone vocals.

His backing band, The Brazos Valley Boys, was voted the top Country Western Band for 14 years in a row by &quot;Billboard&quot;. Thompson pursued a &quot;light&quot; version of the Western swing sound that Bob Wills and others played; the primary difference between his music and that of Bob Wills was that Thompson, who used the swing beat and instrumentation to enhance his vocals, discouraged the intense instrumental soloing from his musicians that Wills encouraged; however, the &quot;Hank Thompson sound&quot; exceeded Bob Wills in top-40 country hits.

Although not as prominent on the top country charts in later decades, Thompson remained a recording artist and concert draw well into his 80s.

The 1987 novel &quot;Crazy Heart&quot; by Thomas Cobb was inspired by Thompson&#x27;s life, specifically by his practice of picking up a local band to back him when he toured. In 2009, Cobb&#x27;s novel was turned into a successful film directed by Scott Cooper and starring Jeff Bridges in an Academy Award-winning performance.

==Biography==
===Life===
Born in Waco, Texas, United States, Thompson was interested in music from an early age, and won several amateur harmonica contests. He decided to pursue his musical talent after serving in the United States Navy in World War II as a radioman and studying electrical engineering at Princeton University before his discharge. He had intended to continue those studies on the GI Bill following his 1946 discharge, and return to Waco. Later that year, after having regional hits with his first single &quot;Whoa Sailor&quot; for Globe Records, Dallas (Globe 124) and almost simultaneously &quot;California Women&quot; for another Dallas label (Blue Bonnet 123), he chose to pursue a full-time musical career.

1952 brought his first number-one single, &quot;The Wild Side of Life&quot;, which contained the memorable line, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know God made honky-tonk angels&quot;. (This line inspired songwriter J. D. &quot;Jay&quot; Miller to write the 1952 answer song &quot;It Wasn&#x27;t God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels&quot;, which became the first hit single for pioneer female country vocalist Kitty Wells.) Other hits for Thompson followed in quick succession in the 1950s and 1960s.

Thompson began singing in a plaintive honky-tonk style similar to that of Ernest Tubb, but, desiring to secure more engagements in the dance halls of the Southwest, he reconfigured his band, the Brazos Valley Boys, to play a &quot;light&quot; version of the Western swing sound that Bob Wills and others made famous, emphasizing the dance beat and meticulous arrangements.

From 1947 to 1964, he recorded for Capitol Records, then joined Warner Bros. Records, where he remained from 1966 through 1967. From 1968 through 1980, he recorded for Dot Records and its successors, ABC Dot and MCA Records. In 1997, Thompson released &quot;Hank Thompson and Friends&quot;, a collection of solo tracks and duets with some of country music&#x27;s most popular performers. In 2000, he released a new album, &quot;Seven Decades&quot;, on the Hightone label. The title reflected his recording history from the 1940s to 2000s.

Thompson was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1989, and was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1997. He continued touring throughout the U.S. until shortly before he became ill. Often, he worked with a reconstituted version of the Brazos Valley Boys that included a few original members.

===Retirement and death===
Thompson&#x27;s last public performance was on October 8, 2007, in Waco, Texas, his birthplace. A smoker for most of his adult life, Thompson was admitted into a Texas hospital in mid-October for shortness of breath. He was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of lung cancer. On November 1, 2007, two days after being released, Thompson cancelled the rest of his 2007 &quot;Sunset Tour&quot; and retired from singing. He went into hospice care at his home in Keller, Texas, and died five days later, on November 6, 2007, aged 82.

According to Thompson&#x27;s spokesman, Tracy Pitcox, president of Heart of Texas Records, Thompson requested that no funeral be held. On November 14, a &quot;celebration of life&quot;, open to both fans and friends, took place at Billy Bob&#x27;s Texas, a Ft. Worth country and western nightclub that bills itself as the World&#x27;s Largest Honky-Tonk.

<doc id="634255" wikidata="Q7736742" url="?curid=634255" title="The Glee Club">
<text>The Glee Club is a chain of independent live stand-up comedy and live music venues in the UK. The first Glee Club was opened by Mark Tughan in Birmingham&#x27;s Chinese Quarter in 1994, the first dedicated comedy club to open in the United Kingdom outside London.

A second branch opened in Cardiff in 2001 with a third club opening in Oxford in April 2010 and a fourth, two room club debuted in Nottingham in September 2010.

The latest club to come online is The Glee Club Glasgow which opened in February 2019.

A number of major names cut their teeth playing at The Glee, including Jack Dee, Peter Kay, Lee Mack and Ross Noble.

The brand has been directly involved with numerous urban comedy festivals in their host cities, and also presented stand-up stages at major outdoor events, including V Festival from 2012-2017. The Glee Club Comedy Tent at V welcomed appearances from Sean Lock (V2012), Eddie Izzard and Josh Widdicombe (V2013), Alan Carr (V2014), Frankie Boyle and Russell Kane (V2016), and Joe Lycett (V2017).

==Comedy show==
The Glee&#x27;s regular comedy show consists of three acts from the UK and international comedy circuits introduced by a compère. The Saturday shows are often followed by a disco in some venues. All clubs also host tour shows by more established acts. Unlike many other comedy clubs, the seating for all comedy gigs is arranged in a theatre style and the clubs&#x27; bars close during the performances.

Professional comedians enjoy appearing at the clubs; as Tom Allen reported: &quot;The Glee Club people are excellent at creating an environment where people can enjoy themselves. There&#x27;s a science to getting the venue and night out right and they are great at attention to detail, everything from the welcome at the door to getting the lighting right. In the past comedy could be quite a macho environment and the Glee Clubs have been great at tackling that and making sure their bills feature diverse performers.&quot;

Many professional acts also opt to play secret or low-key tour warm-up shows at The Glee. Among those who&#x27;ve previewed largescale theatre and arena shows, and test out new material, are John Bishop, Lee Evans, Michael McIntyre, Sarah Millican and Jack Whitehall.

==Live music==
The Glee Clubs have presented live music since April 2001, and presently host gigs in Birmingham, Nottingham, Cardiff and Glasgow. Among the acts who have appeared include Adele and Mumford and Sons. Music was initially brought to the Glee Club by promoter Markus Sargeant.

==The Glee Birmingham==
Situated in Southside, Birmingham, The Glee&#x27;s original home opened in leisure development The Arcadian on 10 September 1994, and was the first dedicated comedy club to open in the UK outside London.

The 20th anniversary show, in 2014, was compered by Ross Noble.

The venue is home to several unique nights including &quot;Comedy Carousel&quot; and &quot;Rough Works&quot;. Hosted and created by comedian Andy Robinson, &quot;Comedy Carousel&quot; has won several awards including multiple What&#x27;s On Readers&#x27; Awards for Best Comedy Club Night and a Chortle Award for Best Comedy Club Show 2015, while actress and comedian Jo Enight&#x27;s &quot;Rough Works&quot; provides a platform for new and established acts try out new material. Also taking place at the club is &quot;The Birmingham Comedy Festival Breaking Talent Award&quot;, which recognises new and emerging talent from the West Midlands.

Many local comics have graced the Glee&#x27;s stage, including Jasper Carrott, Joe Lycett, Lenny Henry and Guz Khan.

==The Glee Cardiff==
A second branch opened in Cardiff in 2001 and is located in the Mermaid Quay development in Cardiff Bay. The opening night line-up included Mark Lamarr and was &quot;an instant hit&quot; with audiences.

The venue has a seated capacity of 440 and a standing capacity of 600. ITV Wales broadcast a series of eight stand up shows from the venue in 2006.

It won the Chortle Award for Best Venue (Wales and West) 10 times between 2002-2017.

==The Glee Oxford==
The third Glee Club opened in Hythe Bridge Street, Oxford in April 2010 with a one-off appearance from Shappi Khorsandi and Angelos Epithemiou, and went on to host appearances from Sarah Millican, Russell Kane, Ross Noble and Jack Whitehall.

Due to redevelopment of the area, the club relocated to The Bullingdon in Cowley Road, Oxford, on 14 January 2017.
Appearing on opening night were Tom Allen and Ellie Taylor. Tom described appearing as &quot;a big honour.&quot;

==The Glee Nottingham==
A fourth, two room club debuted in Nottingham on 15 September 2010.

Situated in the British Waterways Building, on The Waterfront development, the venue programmes comedy, music and special events. Hollywood actor and Academy Award winner Tim Robbins and his Rogues Gallery Band was the venue&#x27;s first music show, while a pre-fame Jake Bugg had a residency here in 2011.

The club also hosts regular cabaret and burlesque nights hosted by The Gilded Merkin.

==The Glee Glasgow==
The Glee Club Glasgow opened on 1 February 2019 in Renfrew Street, and featured a rare club appearance by Sean Lock, plus Gary Little, Geoff Norcott and MC Jay Lafferty.

The club was planned for several years, and is open for regular mixed bill comedy nights on Fridays and Saturdays, with touring shows at other times.

A mural in the entrance/ bar area depicts Scottish comedians Kevin Bridges, Billy Connolly and Frankie Boyle by local artist Michael Scott.

<doc id="634257" wikidata="Q232871" url="?curid=634257" title="Kaʻahumanu">
<text>Kaʻahumanu (March 17, 1768 – June 5, 1832) (&quot;the feathered mantle&quot;) was queen consort and acted as regent of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi as Kuhina Nui. She was the favorite wife of King Kamehameha I and also the most politically powerful, and continued to wield considerable power as co-ruler in the kingdom during reigns of his first two successors.

== Early life ==
Kaʻahumanu was born in a cave called Puu Kauiki in Hāna on the Hawaiian island of Maui. She was born on 17 March 1768. The present Kaahumanu Society celebrates the birthday of its namesake on March 17.
Her father was Keʻeaumoku Papaʻiahiahi, a fugitive aliʻi (noble) from the island of Hawaiʻi, and her mother was Nāmāhānaikaleleokalani, daughter of King Kekaulike Kalani-nui-Kui-Hono-i-Kamoku and the wife of her half-brother the late king of Maui, Kamehameha Nui. Through her mother she was related to many kings of Maui. Through her father, she was the third cousin of Kamehameha I, both sharing the common ancestor, Princess Kalanikauleleiaiwi of the island of Hawaiʻi. She was named after her father&#x27;s rival, Kahekilinuiʻahumanu because it was from him that her father was fleeing at the time.

Her siblings include Governor John Adams Kuakini of Hawaii island, Queen Kalākua Kaheiheimālie, and Governor George Keʻeaumoku II of Maui.
Her father became an advisor and friend to Kamehameha I, eventually becoming royal governor of Maui. He arranged for Kaʻahumanu to marry him when she was thirteen. Kamehameha had numerous wives but Kaʻahumanu would become a favorite and encouraged his war to unify the islands.

== Queen Regent ==
Kaʻahumanu was one of Kamehameha I&#x27;s favorite wives and his most powerful. Upon Kamehameha&#x27;s death on May 8, 1819, Kaʻahumanu announced that late king had wished that she share governance over the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi with his 22-year-old son Liholiho, who took the name of Kamehameha II. The council of advisors agreed and created the post of &quot;kuhina nui&quot; for her, which was similar to co-regent or modern-day prime minister. Her power base grew and she ruled as Queen Regent during the reigns of both Kamehameha II and Kauikeaouli, who assumed the throne as Kamehameha III.

In some ways Kaʻahumanu was ahead of her time and championed the rights of native Hawaiian women, although this was to her own advantage. In what became known as the &quot;&#x27;Ai Noa&quot; (free eating), Kaʻahumanu conspired with Keōpūolani, another of her late husband&#x27;s wives who was also Kamehameha II&#x27;s mother, to eat at the same table with the young king. Notably, she also convinced the &quot;Kahuna-nui&quot; (translatable to High Priest) of the kingdom, Hewahewa, to support her efforts to abolish the &quot;kapu&quot;. While breaking a major kapu was a death penalty offence, Kamehameha II refused to kill his mother, Keōpūolani; this event effectively broke the monarchy&#x27;s support of the &quot;kapu&quot;, and resulted in the system being outlawed.

== Kaumualiʻi of Kauaʻi ==
The island of Kauaʻi and its subject island Niʻihau had never been forcibly conquered by Kamehameha. After years of resistance they negotiated a bloodless surrender in the face of Kamehameha&#x27;s armada. In 1810 the island&#x27;s King, Kaumualiʻi, became a vassal to Kamehameha. When Kamehameha I died, Kamehameha II and Kaʻahumanu feared Kauaʻi would break away from the kingdom. To preserve the union they kidnapped Kaumualiʻi on October 9, 1821, and Kaʻahumanu married him by force. After Kaumualiʻi died in 1824, and a rebellion by Kaumualiʻi&#x27;s son Humehume was put down, she married his other son Kealiʻiahonui.

== Conversion to Christianity ==
In April 1824, Kaʻahumanu publicly acknowledged her conversion to Protestant Christianity and encouraged her subjects to be baptized into the faith. That same year, she presented Hawaiʻi with its first codified body of laws modeled after Christian ethics and values, and the Ten Commandments. Kaʻahumanu was baptized on December 5, 1825, at the site where Kawaiahaʻo Church stands today, taking the name “Elizabeth”.

Missionaries persuaded Kaʻahumanu that the Roman Catholic Church, which had established the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu, should be removed from the island nation. On July 7, 1827, she ordered the first Catholic missionaries to leave. In 1830, Kaʻahumanu signed legislation that forbade Catholic teachings and threatened to deport whoever broke the law.

In 1832, Kaʻahumanu visited Maui, and came to the site of what is now Kaʻahumanu Church, witnessing services being presided by Jonathan Smith Green. Upon seeing this, Ka‘ahumanu asked the Congregationalist mission to name the permanent church structure after her. However, this request was not honored until 1876, when Edward Bailey built the fourth and current structure on the site, naming it after the Queen.

== Banning Hula ==
As regent of Hawai&#x27;i after the death of her husband, King Kamehameha I, Ka&#x27;ahumanu took it upon herself to enforce Christian policies with her power, banning of the Hawaiian Dance hula in 1830. After her death in 1832, some chiefs ignored this ban, including King Kamehameha III. However it was not until King Kalakaua&#x27;s reign in 1886 that hula was celebrated openly once again: &quot;Hula is the language of the heart and therefore the heartbeat of the Hawaiian people.&quot; Ka&#x27;ahumanu&#x27;s policies on hula have had a ripple effect on the acceptability of the art form ever since.

== Establishing American relations ==
Kaʻahumanu and King Kamehameha III negotiated the first treaty between the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi and the United States in 1826, under the administration of President John Quincy Adams. The treaty assumed responsibility on behalf of native Hawaiians with debts to American traders and paid the bill with $150,000 worth of sandalwood; this won her the support of chiefs who owed money to the traders. The same document was also a free trade treaty, ensuring Americans had the right to enter all ports of Hawaiʻi to do business. Americans were also afforded the right to sue in Hawaiian courts and be protected by Hawaiian laws.

In 1827, after Kaʻahumanu returned from a tour of the windward islands, her health steadily declined. During her illness missionaries printed the first copy, bound in red leather with her name engraved in gold letters, of the New Testament in the Hawaiian language. She kept it with her until her death of intestinal illness, June 5, 1832, in the Mānoa Valley near Honolulu. Her funeral was held at Kawaiahaʻo Church, often referred to as the Westminster Abbey of Hawaiʻi. Services were presided by Hiram Bingham. She was laid to rest on ʻIolani Palace grounds but was later moved to the Royal Mausoleum. The monument of Kaumualiʻi in Waiola Church cemetery includes the inscription, &quot;Kaahumanu was his wife, Year 1822,&quot; leading some to mistakenly conclude that she is buried there.

== Notes ==
A portion of the Hawaii Belt Road, state highway 19, on the Big Island of Hawaiʻi is named in her honor. It connects the towns of Kailua-Kona and Kawaihae.
Often referred to by locals as &quot;the Queen K,&quot; it is used for the bicycle and running portions of the Ironman World Championship Triathlon. It also provides access to the Kona International Airport.

Queen Kaʻahumanu Center shopping mall is located at 275 West Kaʻahumanu Avenue (Hawai state route 32) in Kahului, Maui, .

Kaʻahumanu Society, a Hawaiian civics club, was founded and named in her honor in 1864 to celebrate her legacy, serve the poor and sick and promote the importance of Hawaiian female leadership.

<text>Events from the year 1922 in the United Kingdom.

Irish affairs occupied an important place in politics throughout this year. 1922 saw the establishment of the Irish Free State in the south and west of the island.

==Incumbents==
* Monarch – George V
* Prime Minister – David Lloyd George (Coalition) (until 19 October), Bonar Law (Conservative) (starting 23 October)

==Overview==

The social and political problems of most prominence in this year showed a further departure from those that chiefly occupied public attention during the Great War, and the country had by then almost returned to its normal condition. Prices continued to fall during the early part of the year, but very slowly as compared with the previous decline, and in the latter half of the year the fall ceased almost entirely, prices becoming comparatively stabilized at about 80% above the level of July 1914. Labour problems, which occupied so much attention during and after the war, were less constantly in the public eye. The principle of inevitable reductions in wages had been accepted by the working classes as a whole, and there were few strikes on a large scale, the worst being that in the engineering trade. Unemployment continued to be very great, but it was recognised that little more could be done by government measures for its alleviation, and the subject was much less prominent in the political world than it had been in the previous year. A further indication of the return to normal conditions was in the gradual decay of the coalition government. The combination of parties brought about in the presence of a common danger no longer worked in peacetime. Very early in the year signs of disintegration became manifest in the coalition. On several occasions the two wings threatened to fall apart, but the government was successfully held together by the personality of Prime Minister David Lloyd George until the last quarter of the year, when the internal dissensions of many months reached a bursting point, and the coalition collapsed.

<text>Hans Vilhelm (H. V.) Kaalund (27 June 1818 – 27 April 1885) was a Danish lyric poet.

==Early life==
He was the son of a customs officer. He grew in the border district near the walls of Copenhagen. He studied sculpture and painting, but his early attempts to be an artist were interrupted by a nervous disorder. After working in various occupations, he took a position as a teacher at a prison, where he was able to write in his free time.

== Career ==
His verses on the return of Thorvaldsen (1838) were positively received and convinced him to take up literature as a profession. His poems, “Kong Haldan den Stœrke” (1840), and “Valkyrien Göndul” (1842), were successful but not profitable. The same was true of his other works until the publication of his lyrics in the book &quot;Et Foraar&quot; (“A Spring,” 1858), a collection of his best pieces. In 1875 his drama &quot;Fulvia&quot; appeared, and another collection of poetry, &quot;En Eftervaar&quot; (“An After-Spring”), appeared in 1877. Apart from love poetry and political statements, &quot;Et Foraar&quot; and &quot;En Eftervaar&quot; contain a lot of thought lyrics, perhaps his most important legacy.

A characteristic element in Kaalund&#x27;s poetry is its demonstrative commitment to realities. Though a late romanticist, he continuously stresses the importance of building life upon a base of facts – without abandoning idealism. This is felt in poems like &quot;Jeg elsker den brogede Verden&quot; (“I love the colourful World” - 1858) and in his often sung &quot;Paa det Jevne&quot; (“On the Ground” - 1872). The latter was lauded as a typical Danish expression of matter-of-fact attitudes and criticised as just a typical lack of ambition. This split makes him a poet of transition between romanticism and realism. His best poems are still quoted.

Kaalund is known primarily for his &quot;Fabler for Børn&quot; (“Fables for Children,” 1845; illustrated by Johan Lundbye), a book of verses about animals. They are not fables, but small snapshots of animals. Some are sentimental, some humorous. The most famous is &quot;Den dræbte And&quot; - “The killed Duck”. Like the fairy tales of H. C. Andersen, they testify to the rising interest of children and nature in Danish literature and have several times been re-edited. Another collection for children was &quot;Fabler og blandede Digte&quot; (1844). Kaalund died 27 April 1885.

<doc id="634261" wikidata="Q485312" url="?curid=634261" title="Analytic set">
<text>In the mathematical field of descriptive set theory, a subset of a Polish space formula_1 is an analytic set if it is a continuous image of a Polish space. These sets were first defined by and his student .

== Definition ==

There are several equivalent definitions of analytic set. The following conditions on a subspace &quot;A&quot; of a Polish space &quot;X&quot; are equivalent:
*&quot;A&quot; is analytic.
*&quot;A&quot; is empty or a continuous image of the Baire space ωω.
*&quot;A&quot; is a Suslin space, in other words &quot;A&quot; is the image of a Polish space under a continuous mapping.
*&quot;A&quot; is the continuous image of a Borel set in a Polish space.
*&quot;A&quot; is a Suslin set, the image of the Suslin operation.
*There is a Polish space formula_2 and a Borel set formula_3 such that formula_4 is the projection of formula_5 onto formula_1; that is,
: formula_7
*&quot;A&quot; is the projection of a closed set in the cartesian product of &quot;X&quot; with the Baire space.
*&quot;A&quot; is the projection of a Gδ set in the cartesian product of &quot;X&quot; with the Cantor space 2ω.

An alternative characterization, in the specific, important, case that formula_1 is Baire space ωω, is that the analytic sets are precisely the projections of trees on formula_9. Similarly, the analytic subsets of Cantor space 2ω are precisely the projections of trees on formula_10.

Analytic subsets of Polish spaces are closed under countable unions and intersections, continuous images, and inverse images. 
The complement of an analytic set need not be analytic. Suslin proved that if the complement of an analytic set is analytic then the set is Borel. (Conversely any Borel set is analytic and Borel sets are closed under complements.) Luzin proved more generally that any two disjoint analytic sets are separated by a Borel set: in other words there is a Borel set including one and disjoint from the other. This is sometimes called the &quot;Luzin separability principle&quot; (though it was implicit in the proof of Suslin&#x27;s theorem).

Analytic sets are always Lebesgue measurable (indeed, universally measurable) and have the property of Baire and the perfect set property.

== Examples ==
When formula_4 is a set of natural numbers, refer to the set formula_12 as the difference set of formula_4. The set of difference sets of natural numbers is an analytic set, and is complete for analytic sets.

== Projective hierarchy ==

Analytic sets are also called formula_14 (see projective hierarchy). Note that the bold font in this symbol is not the Wikipedia convention, but rather is used distinctively from its lightface counterpart formula_15 (see analytical hierarchy). The complements of analytic sets are called coanalytic sets, and the set of coanalytic sets is denoted by formula_16. 
The intersection formula_17 is the set of Borel sets.

<text>FR-4 (or FR4) is a NEMA grade designation for glass-reinforced epoxy laminate material. FR-4 is a composite material composed of woven fiberglass cloth with an epoxy resin binder that is flame resistant (&quot;self-extinguishing&quot;).

&quot;FR&quot; stands for &quot;flame retardant&quot;, and does not denote that the material complies with the standard UL94V-0 unless testing is performed to UL 94, Vertical Flame testing in Section 8 at a compliant lab. The designation FR-4 was created by NEMA in 1968.

FR-4 glass epoxy is a popular and versatile high-pressure thermoset plastic laminate grade with good strength to weight ratios. With near zero water absorption, FR-4 is most commonly used as an electrical insulator possessing considerable mechanical strength. The material is known to retain its high mechanical values and electrical insulating qualities in both dry and humid conditions. These attributes, along with good fabrication characteristics, lend utility to this grade for a wide variety of electrical and mechanical applications.

Grade designations for glass epoxy laminates are: G-10, G-11, FR-4, FR-5 and FR-6. Of these, FR-4 is the grade most widely in use today. G-10, the predecessor to FR-4, lacks FR-4&#x27;s self-extinguishing flammability characteristics. Hence, FR-4 has since replaced G-10 in most applications.

FR-4 epoxy resin systems typically employ bromine, a halogen, to facilitate flame-resistant properties in FR-4 glass epoxy laminates. Some applications where thermal destruction of the material is a desirable trait will still use G-10 &quot;non flame resistant&quot;.

== Properties ==
Which materials fall into the &quot;FR-4&quot; category is defined in the NEMA LI 1-1998 standard. Typical physical and electrical properties of FR-4 are as follows. The abbreviations LW (lengthwise, warp yarn direction) and CW (crosswise, fill yarn direction) refer to the conventional perpendicular fiber orientations in the XY plane of the board (in-plane). In terms of Cartesian coordinates, lengthwise is along the x-axis, crosswise is along the y-axis, and the z-axis is referred to as the through-plane direction. The values shown below are an example of a certain manufacturer&#x27;s material. Another manufacturer&#x27;s material will usually have slightly different values. Checking the actual values, for any particular material, from the manufacturer&#x27;s datasheet, can be very important, for example in high frequency applications.
where:
; LW: Lengthwise
; CW: Crosswise
; PF: Perpendicular to laminate face

== Applications ==

FR-4 is a common material for printed circuit boards (PCBs). A thin layer of copper foil is typically laminated to one or both sides of an FR-4 glass epoxy panel. These are commonly referred to as copper clad laminates. The copper thickness or copper weight can vary and so is specified separately. 

FR-4 is also used in the construction of relays, switches, standoffs, busbars, washers, arc shields, transformers and screw terminal strips.

<doc id="634267" wikidata="Q4836910" url="?curid=634267" title="BYU Jerusalem Center">
<text>The Brigham Young University Jerusalem Center for Near Eastern Studies (often simply referred to as the BYU Jerusalem Center or BYU–Jerusalem, and locally known as the Mormon University), situated on Mount of Olives in East Jerusalem, is a satellite campus of Brigham Young University (BYU), the largest religious university in the United States. Owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), the center provides a curriculum that focuses on Old and New Testament, ancient and modern Near Eastern studies, and language (Hebrew and Arabic). Classroom study is built around field trips that cover the Holy Land, and the program is open to qualifying full-time undergraduate students at either BYU, BYU-Idaho, or BYU-Hawaii.

Plans to build a center for students were announced by LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball in 1979. By 1984, the church had obtained a 49-year lease on the land and had begun construction. The center&#x27;s prominent position on the Jerusalem skyline quickly brought it notice by the ultra-Orthodox Jews of Israel. Protests and opposition to the building of the center springing from the Haredi Jews made the issue of building the center a national and even international issue. After several investigative committees of Israel&#x27;s Knesset reviewed and debated the issue, Israeli officials decided to allow the center&#x27;s construction to continue in 1986. The center opened to students in May 1988 and was dedicated by Howard W. Hunter on May 16, 1989. It did not admit students from 2001 to 2006 due to security issues during the Second Intifada but continued to provide tours for visitors and weekly concerts.

== History ==

=== Before the center ===
The first LDS official to enter the city of Jerusalem was apostle Orson Hyde, who came in 1841 and dedicated the land for the gathering of the people of Israel, the creation of a Jewish state, and the building of an LDS temple at some future time. After his visit, LDS presence in the city was virtually non-existent. By 1971, the city saw enough LDS visitors for the church to lease a building in East Jerusalem for church services. BYU&#x27;s study abroad program to Jerusalem, which began in 1968, played a key role in the growth of LDS visitors to the area. The LDS presence in the area soon grew too large for the leased space to provide adequate space for worship, so the church began looking into building a center for students. In 1972, David B. Galbraith became the director of BYU&#x27;s program in Jerusalem. He remained in this position until 1987 when the church&#x27;s First Presidency asked him to organize the BYU Jerusalem Center.

On October 24, 1979, LDS Church president Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem to dedicate the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, located on the Mount of Olives. The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Israeli government were present at the occasion. It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church&#x27;s intent to build a center for BYU students in the city. Negotiations between the church and the Israeli government stretched from 1980 to 1984. The land the church wanted for the center, located at the northwestern margin of Mount of Olives, right next to the valley which separates it from Mount Scopus, had been occupied by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law. The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead. Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land. Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law. By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, building permits had been obtained, and construction on the building began.

=== Construction and controversy ===
The 1980s saw not only Mormons, but many Christian groups vying for representation and space in the city. These groups constantly faced opposition from a strong political minority of Orthodox Jews living in the city. Neither major political party in Israel (the Likud and Labor Parties) could achieve a majority vote in the Knesset without support from the more religious parties. Religious parties used this situation to pass laws in favor of Jewish Orthodoxy in exchange for their support on other issues. At the time, the conservative Jews, who made up the &quot;religious right&quot; in Israel, or the Haredim, constituted 27% of the population of Jerusalem, and was decidedly against the building of the BYU Jerusalem Center or any other similar Christian structure. Larger parties faced loss of a majority if they stood opposite on this issue. Many Israeli officials, however, such as the Mayor of Jerusalem at the time, Teddy Kollek, along with others in attendance at the Orson Hyde Memorial Garden dedication, supported the center because of what the church had done for the city. Kollek specifically stated that &quot;the Mormon church&#x27;s presence in Jerusalem can do a great deal of work in providing the bridge of understanding between the Arab and Jews...because its members look with sympathy and understanding at both sides.&quot; The land on which the center was built was then still considered Arab land by many, and many officials saw that its lease would add an image of religious tolerance to their government and increase Israeli control of the land.

Because of its prominent location in the Jerusalem skyline, construction was quickly noticed, and this sparked a major controversy in Israel and in the Jewish world as a whole beginning in 1985. The Haredim led the opposition, their main concern being that the building would be used not as a school, but as a center for Mormon proselyting efforts in Jerusalem. The Haredim warned of a &quot;spiritual holocaust&quot;. The LDS Church, they argued, had no local presence in the population of the Jerusalem area and no historical connections to the land. The group spread warnings through letters, newspapers, and television that Mormon missionaries would convert Jews throughout the city, saying that:

and that:

Warnings in the media led to street protests and demonstrations. Orthodox Jews marched on City Hall and to the construction site in 1986. Some even gathered at the Western Wall in a public prayer of mourning because of the center. They also gathered at the hotel at which the BYU President was staying at one point, carrying signs saying: &quot;Conversion is Murder!&quot; and &quot;Mormons, stop your mission now&quot;. Despite the intensity of the Haredi opposition, at no point did the protests become physically violent. In late 1985, the Haredim motioned for a no-confidence vote against the leading Labor Party. Prime Minister Shimon Peres organized a committee of eight, four for the center and four against, to debate the issue and come up with a solution either for or against the center&#x27;s presence. Another committee was formed to look into the allegation that the money the church had put into Jerusalem was a bribe to gain Mayor Kolleck&#x27;s support for the center (the committee found the church &quot;Not Guilty&quot;). A subcommittee of the Knesset requested that the LDS Church issue a formal promise not to proselytize Jews. Some Israelis considered this discriminatory, as no other Christian church had been asked to do this in Jerusalem. Church leaders, however, agreed to comply and sent a formally signed statement soon after. Some Jews in the area were still uneasy and doubted the church&#x27;s intent, believing that religious belief among Mormons would supersede adherence to the law. One protester stated that &quot;converting the sons of Judah, us, is a basic article of their faith. . . . They regard themselves as sons of Joseph and believe there will be no Second Coming for as long as we and they do not fuse.&quot;

In addition to the promise not to proselyte, BYU began a public relations campaign to inform the public of their intentions for the center as a school and a gathering place for those already of the LDS faith. Ads were purchased in local newspapers, magazines, and on television, and the center had personnel appear on radio talk shows. Government officials in favor of the center also began to speak out, saying that Jerusalem should deny no one a place to worship, Jew, Muslim, or Christian. The Minister for Economic
Planning, Gad Yaakobi said that the debate had &quot;already caused considerable damage to Israel&quot;, and Former Foreign Minister Abba Eban stated that the &quot;free exercise of conscience and dissent in a democratic society&quot; was at stake. The center also received support in the U.S., as former president Gerald Ford spoke for the center, as well the United Jewish Council of Utah, who wrote a letter stating that &quot;For over one hundred years, the Jewish and LDS communities have coexisted in the Salt Lake Valley in a spirit of true friendship and harmony. It has been our experience that when the leaders of the LDS Church make a commitment of policy, it is a commitment which can be relied upon. The stated commitment of Brigham Young University not to violate the laws of the state of Israel, or its own commitment regarding proselytizing in the state of Israel through the Jerusalem-based Brigham Young facility, is a commitment which we sincerely believe will be honored.&quot; The U.S. government also became an intermediary for BYU as 154 members of Congress issued a letter to the Knesset in support of the BYU Jerusalem Center. In 1986, the Knesset approved the completion of the center.
=== Opening and dedication ===
Students moved into the center on May 8, 1987. The school remained unfinished, but the dormitory levels had been completed. Students had formerly been housed at Kibbutz Ramat Rachel. In 1988, before the center&#x27;s dedication, a few Jerusalem locals complained that the arrangement of the windows at night looked like a Christian cross. The center purchased blinds and carefully arranged them over the windows so that no such sign would be seen. Members of the LDS Church do not use the symbol of the cross as other Christian denominations do, due to their focus on the resurrection, rather than the death, of Christ.

The center was dedicated on May 16, 1989, by Howard W. Hunter, the president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. The dedication ceremony was small, as the church decided not to announce it until a month later. The church did not want a large ceremony to cause concern among those in opposition to the center, who may have seen it as a religious gathering. Thomas S. Monson, then a second counselor in the First Presidency of the LDS Church, and Boyd K. Packer, another member of the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve, were among those in attendance, as well as BYU President Jeffrey R. Holland. Robert C. Taylor, director of the BYU Travel Study program was in attendance and stated in an interview with &quot;The Daily Universe&quot; that the dedication of the building was centered solely on the educational aspect of the school, as well as for &quot;whatever purposes [the Lord] has in store&quot; in the future. Taylor stated that the church would respect the laws of the land and their commitment not to proselyte.

=== Center closings ===
After the onset of the Second Intifada, security for BYU students became increasingly difficult to maintain, and the center closed indefinitely to students in 2000. During the fighting, BYU sources reported that the center&#x27;s staff remained on location and managed to maintain good relations on both Israeli and Palestinian sides. As negotiations to stop the fighting continued, one proposed settlement had the center placed within the borders of a proposed Palestinian state (this, however, was not the proposal ultimately agreed upon by the two sides). While closed to students, the center remained open for visitors and concerts.

On June 9, 2006, officials announced their intention to reopen the Jerusalem Center for the Fall 2006 semester. However, escalating violence in the area from the 2006 Israel-Lebanon Conflict frustrated these plans and raised new concerns about students&#x27; safety in the area. School officials deemed the center would remain closed until the conflict was resolved. During this time, some LDS members in Northern Israel were &quot;voluntarily relocated&quot; into the center, away from border missile strikes. BYU officials announced on October 9, 2006, that the center would be reopening for student academic programs for Winter Semester 2007. The initial program was limited to only 44 students. Currently, over 80 students participate each semester. The center remains open into future academic terms.

== Facilities and architecture ==

The center was designed in partnership with Frank Ferguson of FFKR Architects (Salt Lake City) and by Brazilian-Israeli architect David Resnick, who also designed the nearby campus of the Hebrew University. The center is situated on the western slope of the Mount of Olives, right where it connects to Mount Scopus, overlooking the Kidron Valley and the Old City. The , eight-level structure is set amid of gardens. The first five levels provide dormitory and apartment space for up to 170 students, each of these apartments having a patio overlooking the Old City. The sixth level houses a cafeteria, classrooms, computer facilities, and a gymnasium, while administrative and faculty offices are located on the seventh level, along with a 250-seat auditorium. The main entry is on the eighth level, which also contains a recital and special events auditorium with organ, lecture rooms, general and reserve libraries, offices, a domed theater, and a learning resource area. This auditorium is surrounded by glass on three sides, providing views of the city. The organ within it is a Scandinavian-made Marcussen organ. The aforementioned library on the same floor as the auditorium contains 10,000-15,000 volumes focusing largely on the Near East.

The center&#x27;s design reflects the architecture of the Near East. It is constructed of cast concrete. Hand-carved Jerusalem limestone adorn the building, according to local custom. The use of arches and domes closely models other building of Jerusalem and the gardens throughout the center contain many trees and other plants named in the Bible. The interior contains the arches and cupolas typical of the Near East, and large, windowed pavilions provide wide views of Jerusalem.

Over 400 micropiles were drilled into the Mount to secure the foundation in case of an earthquake. The building also contains, in adherence to Israeli law, bomb shelters capable of holding all faculty, staff, and students in case of emergency.

== Research and education ==
The Jerusalem Center played a role in the research of the Dead Sea Scrolls in cooperation with the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation of Jerusalem. They developed a comprehensive CD-ROM database of the contents of the Scrolls, enabling researchers worldwide the ability to study them.

The center provides a curriculum that focuses on Old and New Testament, ancient and modern Near Eastern studies, and language (Hebrew and Arabic). Classroom study is built around field trips that cover the Holy Land, and the program is open only to qualifying full-time undergraduate students at either BYU, BYU-Idaho, or BYU-Hawaii.

The center teaches classes in four-month semesters occurring three times per year. Each semester costs $10,815. Students are required to take a small orientation course online before entering the center and are interviewed individually. Application requirements state that students must have attended at least two semesters (including the semester immediately preceding the trip abroad) at BYU, BYU-Hawaii, or BYU-Idaho, have a GPA of at least 2.5, and sign an agreement not to proselytize. Married students are not allowed to attend.

== Mission ==

Members of the LDS Church believe that Jesus Christ will return in glory in his Second Coming. Howard W. Hunter, who was president of the church&#x27;s Quorum of the Twelve at the time of the center&#x27;s construction, pointed out that although there would be no proselytizing from the center, it still served a valuable purpose. One church member quoted him this way: &quot;Elder Hunter said that our mission was not to harvest, probably not even to plant, but to clear away a few more stones.&quot; Latter-day Saints often see the center as a way for them to show local Jews what the church is about by example, rather than by proselyting. This is done by the way students and faculty at the center live their lives, as well as through the hiring of both Israeli and Palestinian workers, as an example of what can be done through cooperation. During construction of the center, for example, the church hired as many as 300 workers at one time, with about 60% of them being Arab and the other 40% being Jewish. Similar cooperation continues today.

The center also strives to meet the goals of the BYU Mission statement, &quot;to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life&quot; as well as in their educational endeavors. The center aims to give students not only an educational experience by experiencing cultures and languages firsthand, but a spiritual experience by taking them to the sites of biblical events and encouraging them to live their lives in a Christian way.

<text>Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T. or SMART) is a monitoring system included in computer hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs). Its primary function is to detect and report various indicators of drive reliability, or how long a drive can function while anticipating imminent hardware failures.

When S.M.A.R.T. data indicates a possible imminent drive failure, software running on the host system may notify the user so action can be taken to prevent data loss, and the failing drive can be replaced and no data is lost.

== Background ==

Hard disk and other storage drives are subject to failures (see hard disk drive failure) which can be classified into two basic classes:

* &quot;Predictable failures&quot; which result from slow processes such as mechanical wear and gradual degradation of storage surfaces. Monitoring can determine when such failures are becoming more likely.
* &quot;Unpredictable failures&quot; which occur without warning due to anything from electronic components becoming defective to a sudden mechanical failure, including failures related to improper handling.

Mechanical failures account for about 60% of all drive failures.
While the eventual failure may be catastrophic, most mechanical failures result from gradual wear and there are usually certain indications that failure is imminent. These may include increased heat output, increased noise level, problems with reading and writing of data, or an increase in the number of damaged disk sectors.

PCTechGuide&#x27;s page on S.M.A.R.T. (2003) comments that the technology has gone through three phases:
===Accuracy===
A field study at Google covering over 100,000 consumer-grade drives from December 2005 to August 2006 found correlations between certain S.M.A.R.T. information and annualized failure rates:
* In the 60 days following the first uncorrectable error on a drive (S.M.A.R.T. attribute 0xC6 or 198) detected as a result of an offline scan, the drive was, on average, 39 times more likely to fail than a similar drive for which no such error occurred.
* First errors in reallocations, offline reallocations (S.M.A.R.T. attributes 0xC4 and 0x05 or 196 and 5) and probational counts (S.M.A.R.T. attribute 0xC5 or 197) were also strongly correlated to higher probabilities of failure. 
* Conversely, little correlation was found for increased temperature and no correlation for usage level. However, the research showed that a large proportion (56%) of the failed drives failed without recording any count in the &quot;four strong S.M.A.R.T. warnings&quot; identified as scan errors, reallocation count, offline reallocation, and probational count. 
* Further, 36% of failed drives did so without recording any S.M.A.R.T. error at all, except the temperature, meaning that S.M.A.R.T. data alone was of limited usefulness in anticipating failures.

== History and predecessors ==
An early hard disk monitoring technology was introduced by IBM in 1992 in its IBM 9337 Disk Arrays for AS/400 servers using IBM 0662 SCSI-2 disk drives. Later it was named Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) technology. It was measuring several key device health parameters and evaluating them within the drive firmware. Communications between the physical unit and the monitoring software were limited to a binary result: namely, either &quot;device is OK&quot; or &quot;drive is likely to fail soon&quot;.

Later, another variant, which was named IntelliSafe, was created by computer manufacturer Compaq and disk drive manufacturers Seagate, Quantum, and Conner. The disk drives would measure the disk&#x27;s &quot;health parameters&quot;, and the values would be transferred to the operating system and user-space monitoring software. Each disk drive vendor was free to decide which parameters were to be included for monitoring, and what their thresholds should be. The unification was at the protocol level with the host.

Compaq submitted IntelliSafe to the Small Form Factor (SFF) committee for standardization in early 1995. It was supported by IBM, by Compaq&#x27;s development partners Seagate, Quantum, and Conner, and by Western Digital, which did not have a failure prediction system at the time. The Committee chose IntelliSafe&#x27;s approach, as it provided more flexibility. Compaq placed IntelliSafe into the public domain on 12 May 1995. The resulting jointly developed standard was named S.M.A.R.T..

That SFF standard described a communication protocol for an ATA host to use and control monitoring and analysis in a hard disk drive, but did not specify any particular metrics or analysis methods. Later, &quot;S.M.A.R.T.&quot; came to be understood (though without any formal specification) to refer to a variety of specific metrics and methods and to apply to protocols unrelated to ATA for communicating the same kinds of things.

== Provided information ==
The technical documentation for S.M.A.R.T. is in the AT Attachment (ATA) standard. First introduced in 1994, the ATA standard has gone through multiple revisions. Some parts of the original S.M.A.R.T. specification by the Small Form Factor (SFF) Committee were added to ATA-3, published in 1997. In 1998 ATA-4 dropped the requirement for drives to maintain an internal attribute table and instead required only for an &quot;OK&quot; or &quot;NOT OK&quot; value to be returned. Albeit, manufacturers have kept the capability to retrieve the attributes&#x27; value. The most recent ATA standard, ATA-8, was published in 2004. It has undergone regular revisions, the latest being in 2011. Standardization of similar features on SCSI is more scarce and is not named as such on standards, although vendors and consumers alike do refer to these similar features as S.M.A.R.T. too.

The most basic information that S.M.A.R.T. provides is the S.M.A.R.T. status. It provides only two values: &quot;threshold not exceeded&quot; and &quot;threshold exceeded&quot;. Often, these are represented as &quot;drive OK&quot; or &quot;drive fail&quot; respectively. A &quot;threshold exceeded&quot; value is intended to indicate that there is a relatively high probability that the drive will not be able to honor its specification in the future: that is, the drive is &quot;about to fail&quot;. The predicted failure may be catastrophic or may be something as subtle as the inability to write to certain sectors, or perhaps slower performance than the manufacturer&#x27;s declared minimum.

The S.M.A.R.T. status does not necessarily indicate the drive&#x27;s past or present reliability. If a drive has already failed catastrophically, the S.M.A.R.T. status may be inaccessible. Alternatively, if a drive has experienced problems in the past, but the sensors no longer detect such problems, the S.M.A.R.T. status may, depending on the manufacturer&#x27;s programming, suggest that the drive is now healthy.

The inability to &quot;read&quot; some sectors is not always an indication that a drive is about to fail. One way that unreadable sectors may be created, even when the drive is functioning within specification, is through a sudden power failure while the drive is writing. Also, even if the physical disk is damaged at one location, such that a certain sector is unreadable, the disk may be able to use spare space to replace the bad area, so that the sector can be overwritten.

More detail on the health of the drive may be obtained by examining the S.M.A.R.T. Attributes. S.M.A.R.T. Attributes were included in some drafts of the ATA standard, but were removed before the standard became final. The meaning and interpretation of the attributes varies between manufacturers, and are sometimes considered a trade secret for one manufacturer or another. Attributes are further discussed below.

Drives with S.M.A.R.T. may optionally maintain a number of &#x27;logs&#x27;. The &quot;error log&quot; records information about the most recent errors that the drive has reported back to the host computer. Examining this log may help one to determine whether computer problems are disk-related or caused by something else (error log timestamps may &quot;wrap&quot; after 232 ms=49.71 days)

A drive that implements S.M.A.R.T. may optionally implement a number of self-test or maintenance routines, and the results of the tests are kept in the &quot;self-test log&quot;. The self-test routines may be used to detect any unreadable sectors on the disk, so that they may be restored from back-up sources (for example, from other disks in a RAID). This helps to reduce the risk of incurring permanent loss of data.

== Standards and implementation ==

===Lack of common interpretation===
Many motherboards display a warning message upon boot when a disk drive is approaching failure. Although an industry standard exists among most major hard drive manufacturers, issues remain due to attributes intentionally left undocumented to the public in order to differentiate models between manufacturers.
From a legal perspective, the term &quot;S.M.A.R.T.&quot; refers only to a signaling method between internal disk drive electromechanical sensors and the host computer. Because of this the specifications of S.M.A.R.T. are entirely vendor specific and, while many of these attributes have been standardized between drive vendors, others remain vendor-specific. S.M.A.R.T. implementations still differ and in some cases may lack &quot;common&quot; or expected features such as a temperature sensor or only include a few select attributes while still allowing the manufacturer to advertise the product as &quot;S.M.A.R.T. compatible.&quot;

===Visibility to host systems===
Depending on the type of interface being used, some S.M.A.R.T.-enabled motherboards and related software may not communicate with certain S.M.A.R.T.-capable drives. For example, few external drives connected via USB and FireWire correctly send S.M.A.R.T. data over those interfaces. With so many ways to connect a hard drive (SCSI, Fibre Channel, ATA, SATA, SAS, SSA, NVMe and so on), it is difficult to predict whether S.M.A.R.T. reports will function correctly in a given system.

Even with a hard drive and interface that implements the specification, the computer&#x27;s operating system may not see the S.M.A.R.T. information because the drive and interface are encapsulated in a lower layer. For example, they may be part of a RAID subsystem in which the RAID controller sees the S.M.A.R.T.-capable drive, but the host computer sees only a logical volume generated by the RAID controller.

On the Windows platform, many programs designed to monitor and report S.M.A.R.T. information will function only under an administrator account.

BIOS and Windows (Windows Vista and later) may detect S.M.A.R.T. status of hard disk drives and solid state drives, and give a prompt if the S.M.A.R.T. status is bad.

== In ATA ==

=== ATA S.M.A.R.T. attributes ===
Each drive manufacturer defines a set of attributes, and sets threshold values beyond which attributes should not pass under normal operation. Each attribute has:
* 1 byte for the ID (1 through 254).
* 1 byte for status flags.
* 1 byte of &quot;threshold value&quot;, which ranges from 0 to 254.
* 1 byte of &quot;normalized value&quot; aka &quot;current value&quot;, which ranges from 0 to 254 (higher is &quot;usually&quot; better, but vendors are allowed to vary; the &quot;threshold&quot; entry stored elsewhere describes which direction is better). The initial normalized value of attributes is 100 but can vary between manufacturer.
* 8 bytes &quot;vendor-specific&quot;.

In practice, however, the full &quot;vendor-specific&quot; field is not used as-is. Instead, one of the following occurs:
* In the 7-byte setup, the first byte of &quot;vendor-specific&quot; is used to store a &quot;worst&quot; normalized value, leaving 7 bytes for vendor data.
* In the 6-byte setup, the first byte of &quot;vendor-specific&quot; is used to store a &quot;worst&quot; normalized value and the last byte &quot;reserved&quot;, leaving 6 bytes.
* In the 8-byte setup, the &quot;normalized&quot; byte is added to the field while the last byte is reserved.

In any case, the vendor field, also commonly called a &quot;raw value&quot;, may be displayed as a decimal or hexadecimal number; its meaning is entirely up to the drive manufacturer (but often corresponds to counts or a physical unit, such as degrees Celsius or seconds).

If one or more attribute have the &quot;prefailure&quot; flag, and the &quot;current value&quot; of such prefailure attribute is smaller than or equal to its &quot;threshold value&quot; (unless the &quot;threshold value&quot; is 0), that will be reported as a &quot;drive failure&quot;. In addition, a utility software can send SMART RETURN STATUS command to the ATA drive, it may report three status: &quot;drive OK&quot;, &quot;drive warning&quot; or &quot;drive failure&quot;.

Manufacturers that have implemented at least one S.M.A.R.T. attribute in various products include Samsung, Seagate, IBM (Hitachi), Fujitsu, Maxtor, Toshiba, Intel, sTec, Inc., Western Digital and ExcelStor Technology.

==== Known ATA S.M.A.R.T. attributes ====
The following chart lists some S.M.A.R.T. attributes and the typical meaning of their raw values. Normalized values are usually mapped so that higher values are better (exceptions include drive temperature, number of head load/unload cycles), but higher &quot;raw&quot; attribute values may be better or worse depending on the attribute and manufacturer. For example, the &quot;Reallocated Sectors Count&quot; attribute&#x27;s normalized value &quot;decreases&quot; as the count of reallocated sectors &quot;increases&quot;. In this case, the attribute&#x27;s &quot;raw&quot; value will often indicate the actual count of sectors that were reallocated, although vendors are in no way required to adhere to this convention.

As manufacturers do not necessarily agree on precise attribute definitions and measurement units, the following list of attributes is a general guide only.

Drives do not support all attribute codes (sometimes abbreviated as &quot;ID&quot;, for &quot;identifier&quot;, in tables). Some codes are specific to particular drive types (magnetic platter, flash, SSD). Drives may use different codes for the same parameter, e.g., see codes 193 and 225.

=== Logs ===

==== SMART Command Transport ====

=== Threshold Exceeds Condition ===
Threshold Exceeds Condition (TEC) is an estimated date when a critical drive statistic attribute will reach its threshold value. When Drive Health software reports a &quot;Nearest T.E.C.&quot;, it should be regarded as a &quot;Failure date&quot;. Sometimes, no date is given and the drive can be expected to work without errors.

To predict the date, the drive tracks the rate at which the attribute changes. Note that TEC dates are only estimates; hard drives can and do fail much sooner or much later than the TEC date.

== In NVMe ==
NVMe specification has defined unified S.M.A.R.T. attributes for different drive manufacturers. The data is present in a log page of 512 bytes long.

=== Known NVMe S.M.A.R.T. attributes ===
== In SCSI ==
The SCSI standard does not mention the term &quot;S.M.A.R.T.&quot; except in one place, but the equivalent logging/failure-prediction functionality is available in standard log pages prescribed by SPC-4. There is also space for vendor-specific log pages. Log pages are variable-length.
SCSI has a specialized set of S.M.A.R.T. features for tape drives known as TapeAlert defined in SMC-2. SCSI offers self-testing, similar to ATA.

Information related to the reallocation of bad sectors is provided not via a log page, but via the READ DEFECT DATA command. In addition to a grand total, this command provides information about which specific sectors were allocated and why.

== Self-tests ==
S.M.A.R.T. drives may offer a number of self-tests:

;Short
: Checks the electrical and mechanical performance as well as the read performance of the disk. Electrical tests might include a test of buffer RAM, a read/write circuitry test, or a test of the read/write head elements. Mechanical test includes seeking and servo on data tracks. Scans small parts of the drive&#x27;s surface (area is vendor-specific and there is a time limit on the test). Checks the list of pending sectors that may have read errors, and it usually takes under two minutes.
;Long/extended
: A longer and more thorough version of the short self-test, scanning the entire disk surface with no time limit. This test usually takes several hours, depending on the read/write speed of the drive and its size. It is possible for the long test to pass even if the short test fails.
;Conveyance
: Intended as a quick test to identify damage incurred during transporting of the device from the drive manufacturer to the computer manufacturer. Only available on ATA drives, and it usually takes several minutes.
;Selective
: Some ATA drives allow selective self-tests of just a part of the surface. There is a dedicated log for selective test results, separate from the main self-test log.
; Background scan
: SCSI drives have the ability to schedule periodic full-surface self-tests known as a background media scan (BMS). The program may be used to adjust whether to run the scans () and various parameters for the scan (e.g. period, idle time before run). The drive remains operable during the test. There is a dedicated log for background scan results, separate from the self-test log.
; Offline data collection
: ATA drives may support a periodic short operation called &quot;offline data collection&quot;. Although this feature is marked &quot;obsolete&quot;, many modern hard drives retain this feature. The drive remains operable during collection and any result is reflected only in SMART attributes (some attributes only update when &quot;offline&quot;).

Drives remain operable during self-test, unless a &quot;captive&quot; option (ATA only) is requested.

The self-test logs for SCSI and ATA drives are slightly different.

The ATA drive&#x27;s self-test log can contain up to 21 read-only entries. When the log is filled, old entries are removed.

<text>Kei Ling Ha () is an area of Shap Sze Heung, on the Sai Kung Peninsula, in eastern New Territories of Hong Kong. Administratively, it is part of Tai Po District. It is a popular place for countryside visits, picnicking and bird watching.

==Location==
Kei Ling Ha is located at the coastal area near Sai Sha Road, at the junction of Ma On Shan Country Park and Sai Kung West Country Park. It is located in the innermost shore of Three Fathoms Cove which is known as Kei Ling Ha Hoi indigenously.

==Villages==


Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai () and Kei Ling Ha San Wai () are the two main villages within this area. Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai is a Hakka walled village. Both villages are occupied by members of the Ho () lineage.

The settlement of Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai probably dates back to the late 16th century. The New Village branched off from the &quot;old Wai&quot; around 1876. The combined population of the two villages was 135 in 1960.

As a walled village, Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai features an entrance gate and a Ho Ancestral Hall. A drystone wall marks the outer edge of the village platform on a piedmont site. The site faces almost directly north so that the wall has a most likely a geomantic as well as a practical function.

Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai and Kei Ling Ha San Wai are recognized villages under the New Territories Small House Policy.

==Ecology==
Kei Ling Ha is the site of a rocky shore. Mangrove can be found at Kei Ling Ha Lo Wai, and the site has been a Site of Special Scientific Interest since 1994. It is the habitat of fiddler crabs.

==Transport==
Kei Ling Ha is served by Sai Sha Road. The end of Stage 3 and start of Stage 4 of the MacLehose Trail is located at Shui Long Wo (), part of Kei Ling Ha.

<doc id="634294" wikidata="Q2560376" url="?curid=634294" title="John McClelland (doctor)">
<text>John McClelland or M&#x27;Clelland (1805 – 31 July 1883) was a British medical doctor with interests in natural history, who worked for the East India Company in India and Burma. He served as a temporary curator of the museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal just before a permanent curator was found in Edward Blyth.

McClelland is thought to have been born in Ireland, studied medicine and was admitted member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1828. He entered the service of the East India Company in the Bengal Medical Service on 7th April 1830. In 1835 he was sent on a mission (Tea Committee) to identify if tea could be grown in north-eastern India along with Nathaniel Wallich and William Griffith. This mission ran into troubles with the members of the group clashing with each other.

McClelland was appointed 1836 as the secretary of the &quot;Coal Committee&quot;, the forerunner of the Geological Survey of India (GSI), formed to explore possibilities to exploit Indian coal. He was the first to propose hiring professional geologists for the task. He was also involved in surveys of forests and his reports led to the establishment of the Forest Department in India. In 1838 he was a temporary curator of the museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. In 1839 he was offered the permanent post of curator of the museum of the Asiatic Society of Bengal but he rejected the offer because he did not accept the terms of two hours daily attendance at the museum and to produce monthly reports of progress. At the time he was deputy apothecary, assistant opium examiner as well as secretary to the coal and iron committee with the first position requiring his presence in office from eleven to four daily. The curator position was then filled by Edward Blyth. McClelland quit the Asiatic Society of Bengal and founded and edited the &quot;Calcutta Journal of Natural History, and Miscellany of the Arts and Sciences in India&quot; which ran from 1841 to 1847. McClelland was influenced by the quinarian system.

McClelland also served as an interim superintendent of the Calcutta Botanical Garden from 1846 to 1847. He was superintendent of forests in lower Burma from 1852 to 1856. In 1860 he became junior inspector general and in 1862, following the retirement of John Forsyth, he was made Inspector General and he retired on 24th November 1865. He died at Hastings and was buried at St. Leonards-on-Sea. The grave stone also records the death of his wife Sophie, &quot;wife of Henry Swaine and Widow of the above, John McClelland, Who died April 5, 1885, Aged 44 years.&quot;

==Work and legacy==
McClelland&#x27;s major botanical contribution was his editing of the work of William Griffith which was published posthumously as &quot;Notulae ad plantas asiaticas&quot;. In his original work as an ichthyologist he described many species and several genera of fish, among them &quot;Schistura&quot;. The Spotted codlet fish &quot;Bregmaceros mcclellandi&quot; is named after him. McClelland is commemorated in the name of the mountain bulbul, &quot;Ixos mcclellandii&quot; and a species of snake, &quot;Sinomicrurus macclellandi&quot;.

<text>The Honorable Dr John Macadam (29 May 1827 – 2 September 1865), was a Scottish-Australian chemist, medical teacher, Australian politician and cabinet minister, and honorary secretary of the Burke and Wills expedition. The genus &quot;Macadamia&quot; (macadamia nut) was named after him in 1857. He died at sea, on a voyage from Australia to New Zealand, aged 38.

==Early life==

John Macadam was born at Northbank, Glasgow, Scotland, on 29 May 1827, the son of William Macadam (1783-1853) and Helen, née Stevenson (1803-1857). His father was a Glasgow businessman, who owned a spinning and textile printing works in Kilmarnock, and was a burgess and a bailie (magistrate) of Glasgow. His fellow industrialists and he in the craft had developed, using chemistry, the processes for the large-scale industrial printing of fabrics for which these plants in the area became known.

John Macadam was privately educated in Glasgow; he studied chemistry at the Andersonian University (now the University of Strathclyde) and went for advanced study at the University of Edinburgh under Professor William Gregory. In 1846–47, he went on to serve as assistant to Professor George Wilson at the University of Edinburgh in his laboratory in Brown Square. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Scottish Society of Arts that year, and in 1848, a member of the Glasgow Philosophical Society. He then studied medicine at the University of Glasgow (LFPS, MD,1854; FFPSG,1855).

He was a member of what became a small dynasty of Scottish scientists and lecturers in analytical chemistry, which included, other than himself, his eldest half brother William Macadam, his immediate younger brother Stevenson Macadam (a younger brother Charles Thomas Macadam, although not involved as a scientist, was also indirectly involved in chemistry becoming a senior partner in a chemical fertiliser company) and nephews William Ivison Macadam and Stevenson J. C. G. Macadam, as well as the former nephew&#x27;s daughter, his great niece Elison A. Macadam.

On 8 June 1855, aged 28, Macadam sailed for Melbourne in the Colony of Victoria, Australia, on the sailing ship &quot;Admiral.&quot; He arrived on 8 September 1855.

==Australian academic career==

In 1855 he was a lecturer on chemistry and natural science at Scotch College, having been engaged for the position before leaving Scotland.

In 1857 he was awarded an MD &quot;ad eundem&quot; from the University of Melbourne in acknowledgment of his MD from the University of Glasgow.

In 1857-1858 he also taught at Geelong Church of England Grammar School (now Geelong Grammar School). In 1858, he was appointed the Victorian government analytical chemist. In 1860 he became health officer to the City of Melbourne. He wrote several reports on public health.

On 3 March 1862 he was appointed as the first lecturer in medicine (chemistry and practical chemistry) at the University of Melbourne School of Medicine. For the next few years he held classes for a small number of medical students in the Analytical Laboratory behind the Public Library. He was also a member of the Board of Agriculture.

==Political life==

Macadam became a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly of the self-governing Colony of Victoria as a radical and supporter of the Land Convention, representing Castlemaine.

Appointed postmaster-general of Victoria in 1861, Macadam resigned from the legislature in 1864. He had sponsored bills on medical practitioners and adulteration of food which became law in 1862 and 1863.

==Royal Society of Victoria==

Between 1857 and 1862, Macadam served as honorary secretary of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria, which then became the Royal Society of Victoria in 1860, and was appointed vice-president of it in 1863. He was editor of first five volumes of the society&#x27;s &quot;Transactions&quot;. He was active in erecting the Society&#x27;s Meeting Hall (their present building) and was involved in the institute&#x27;s initiative to obtain a royal charter. He saw both happen while he held office, when in January 1860, the Philosophical Institute became the Royal Society of Victoria and met in their new building.

===Burke and Wills expedition===

Between 1857 and 1865, Macadam served as honorary secretary to the Exploration Committee of the Royal Society of Victoria, which organised the Burke and Wills expedition.

The expedition was organised by the society with the aim of crossing the continent of Australia from the south to the north coasts, map it, and collect scientific data and specimens. At that time, most of the interior of Australia had not been explored by the European settlers and was unknown to them.

In 1860–61, Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke and William John Wills led the expedition of 19 men with that intention, crossing Australia from Melbourne in the south, to the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north, a distance around 2,000 miles.

Three men ultimately travelled over 3,000 miles from Melbourne to the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria and back to the Depot Camp at Cooper Creek. Seven men died in the attempt, including the leaders Burke and Wills. Of the four men who reached the north coast, only one, John King, survived with the help of the indigenous people to return to Melbourne.

This expedition became the first to cross the Australian continent. It was of great importance to the subsequent development of Australia and could be compared in importance to the Lewis and Clark Expedition overland to the North American Pacific Coast to the development of the United States.

After the heavy death toll of the expedition, initial criticism fell on the Royal Society, but it became clear that their foresight could not have prevented the deaths and this was then widely recognised when it became known that as Secretary of the Exploration Committee of the Burke and Wills expedition, Dr. Macadam had insisted on adequate provisions for their safety.

==Macadamia ==

The macadamia (genus Macadamia) nut was discovered by the European settlers, and subsequently the tree was named after him by his friend and colleague, Ferdinand von Mueller (1825-1896), Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. The tree gave his name to macadamia nuts. The genus &quot;Macadamia&quot; was first described scientifically in 1857 by Dr. Mueller and he named the new genus in honour of his friend Dr John Macadam. Mueller had done a great deal of taxonomy of the flora, naming innumerable genera but chose this &quot;...a beautiful genus dedicated to John Macadam, M.D. the talented and deserving secretary of our institute.&quot;

==Australian rules football==

On 7 August 1858, Macadam, along with Tom Wills, officiated at a game of football played between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar. This game was a predecessor to the modern game of Australian rules football and is commemorated by a statue outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The two schools have competed annually ever since, lately for the Cordner–Eggleston Cup.

==Family==

On 18 September 1856, a year after he arrived from Scotland, he married Elizabeth Clark in Melbourne, Australia. She had arrived three days before the wedding with her maid on the &quot;Admiral&quot;, the same ship on which he had travelled out a year earlier, which reached Hobson&#x27;s Bay (Melbourne&#x27;s port) on 15 September 1856, having set sail from London on 7 June 1856. Elizabeth Clark was probably born on 7 October 1832 in Barony parish Scotland, near Glasgow (her mother being Mary McGregor). She was the second daughter of John Clark, of Levenfield House in Alexandria, the Vale of Leven, a short distance north of Glasgow in West Dunbartonshire. His Levenfield Works were involved in similar work to Dr John Macadam&#x27;s father William Macadam in Kilmarnock in the then lucrative business of textile printing for domestic and European markets. The Clarks and Macadams must have become known to each other in Scotland because of their respective fathers&#x27; business connections. Elizabeth died in 1915, in Brighton, Victoria.

John and Elizabeth had two sons:

John Melnotte Macadam was born 29 August 1858 at Fitzroy, Melbourne, Australia, and died on 30 January 1859, aged 5 months (he was reburied with his father, whose monument bears the additional inscription: &quot;In memory of his only children John Melnotte Macadam Born August 29, 1858 Died January 30, 1859&quot; followed by an inscription to his second son below it).

William Castlemaine Macadam was born on 2 July 1860 and died 17 December 1865 at Williamstown, Victoria, Australia. He died aged five and had survived his father by a few months. The inscription on his father&#x27;s burial monument under &quot;His only children&quot; has him listed under his elder brother (above), who died in infancy, but does not for some reason give William&#x27;s date of death on it.

==Death==

In March 1865 Macadam sailed to New Zealand to give evidence at the trial of Captain W. A. Jarvey, accused of fatally poisoning his wife, but the jury did not reach a verdict. During the return voyage, Macadam fractured his ribs during a storm. He was advised, on medical grounds, not to return for the adjourned trial but did so and died on the ship on 2 September 1865. His medical-student assistant John Drummond Kirkland gave evidence at the trial in Macadam&#x27;s place, and Jarvey was convicted.

The &quot;Australian News&quot; commented, &quot;At the time of his death, Dr Macadam was but 38 years of age; there can be little doubt that the various and onerous duties he discharged for the public must be attributed in great measure the shortening of his days.&quot; The &quot;Australian Medical Journal&quot; stated, &quot;For some time it had been evident to his friends that his general health was giving way: that a frame naturally robust and vigorous was gradually becoming undermined by the incessant and harassing duties of the multifarious offices he filled.&quot; The inquest verdict (he died at sea) stated, &quot;His death was caused by excessive debility and general exhaustion.&quot;

==Funeral==

The funeral was large. The newspapers carried tributes and subsequently lengthier obituaries from learned societies were published, such as that in the &quot;Australian Medical Journal&quot; and elsewhere. The Melbourne &quot;Leader&quot; described the funeral: &quot;The coffin was drawn by four horses. Four mourning coaches contained the chief mourners and the more intimate friends of the deceased gentleman. A large procession followed, in which were several members of Parliament, the members of the Royal Society, the Chief Justice; the Mayor and corporation of the city of Melbourne. A number of private carriages and the public wound up the procession...At the University, the chancellor, the vice-chancellor, and a number of the students, all in their academic robes, met the funeral cortege, and proceeded the remainder of the distance&quot;. The chief mourner was his youngest brother, George Robert Macadam (1837-1918). John Macadam&#x27;s grave, surmounted by a marble obelisk, is in Melbourne General Cemetery.

==Widow remarried==

After John Macadam and her children&#x27;s deaths his widow, Elizabeth Clark, later remarried. She married the Reverend John Dalziel Dickie, who was pastor at Colac for 32 years. They married on 26 February 1868 They had four daughters. Elizabeth Dickie died aged 82 in 1915, in Brighton, Victoria, as the widow of the Rev. Dickie. Dickie had died 25 December 1909.

<doc id="634297" wikidata="Q336362" url="?curid=634297" title="William Wallace, Baron Wallace of Saltaire">
<text>William John Lawrence Wallace, Baron Wallace of Saltaire, (born 12 March 1941 in Leicester), is a British academic, writer, and Liberal Democrat politician, who was a Lord in Waiting from 2010 to 2015.

==Early life==
Wallace was educated at Westminster Abbey Choir School, where as a chorister he sang at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and St Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford. He went to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1959, reading History (BA). As an undergraduate at Cambridge, Wallace joined all three political clubs (Conservative, Labour, and Liberal). He decided that the Liberal Party was the most attractive and, in 1961, he was elected vice-president of the Cambridge University Liberal Club, later becoming its president.

After graduating from Cambridge Wallace travelled to the United States, where he spent three years working towards his PhD at Cornell University, finishing his thesis on the Liberal Revival of 1955–66 while in residence at Nuffield College, Oxford. During this time at Oxford, he met his future wife, Helen Sarah Rushworth, who was president of the Oxford University Liberal Club. They were married on 25 August 1968 and have two children, Harriet (born 1977) and Edward (born 1981), both of whom were, like their father, educated at Cambridge.

==Academic career==
Wallace began his academic career as a lecturer in the Department of Government at the University of Manchester where he taught between 1966 and 1977.

Wallace served as director of Studies of the Royal Institute of International Affairs 1978–1990.

From 1990 to 1995 Wallace was the Walter Hallstein Senior Research Fellow at St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford. He also served on the editorial board of &quot;Soviet Studies&quot;.

Between 1993 and 1996 he was a visiting professor at the Central European University where he was involved in setting up the International Relations Department.

In 1995 he moved to the London School of Economics and Political Science where he took up a position as reader in international relations in 1999, becoming a professor of international relations. He became an emeritus professor in 2005. He is chair of the advisory board of LSE IDEAS, a centre for the study of international affairs, diplomacy and grand strategy.

One of his many doctoral students was Olli Rehn.

He has also been a visiting fellow/professor at institutions in the US, Germany, France, Italy, Greece and Belgium.

==Politics==

He joined the Liberal Party whilst studying at Cambridge and served as vice-president and then president of the Cambridge University Liberal Club.

In the 1966 United Kingdom general election, Wallace served as the Liberal Party&#x27;s Assistant Press Officer, responsible for Jo Grimond&#x27;s press activities.

Remaining active in Liberal politics, Wallace unsuccessfully contested five parliamentary elections. He stood in Huddersfield West in 1970, Manchester Moss Side in both February 1974 and October 1974, and Shipley in 1983 and 1987.

He also served as a speechwriter for David Steel and as vice-chairman of the Standing Committee 1977–1987. He was co-author of the 1979 Liberal and 1997 Liberal Democrat election manifestos. During the Liberal-SDP Alliance, 1982–1987, he was a member of the joint party steering committee. In 2004 he became the president of the Yorkshire regional Liberal Democrat Party. In 2005 he returned to the Federal Policy Committee as the Lords representative, serving on several party policy groups.

He has also served as chair of the advisory board of the liberal think tank, CentreForum.

Lord Wallace is president of the Liberal Democrat History Group. He took over this position after the death of Conrad Russell in 2004.

In 1995 he was awarded the French Chevalier, Ordre du Mérite. In 2005 he was awarded the Légion d&#x27;Honneur in recognition of his long-standing efforts to promote the European Union.

In the summer of 2004, he travelled to Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia in the company of Anna Politkovskaya.

In April 2010, he courted controversy when he partially defended Jenny Tonge, another Liberal Democrat peer following an interview she gave to the Jewish Chronicle in which she called for an investigation into claims of Israeli organ harvesting in Haiti.

==Peerage==
Wallace was created a life peer on 19 December 1995, taking the title Baron Wallace of Saltaire, of Shipley in the County of West Yorkshire. He made his maiden speech on 17 January 1996 during a debate on education. He retains a house in Saltaire. From 1999 to 2005, parliamentarians from three chambers, Chris Leslie MP in the House of Commons, Lord Wallace of Saltaire in the House of Lords and Richard Corbett MEP in the European Parliament, all lived in Saltaire.

In 1997 Wallace became a member of the Select Committee on the European Communities and chairman of the Sub-Committee on Justice and Home Affairs 1997–2000. In 2001 he became the Liberal Democrats&#x27; main frontbench spokesperson in the House of Lords on foreign affairs and in November 2004 was elected joint Deputy Leader of the Liberal Democrat Peers.

<text>Arthur MacArthur Jr. (June 2, 1845 – September 5, 1912) was a lieutenant general of the United States Army. He became the military Governor-General of the American-occupied Philippines in 1900; his term ended a year later due to clashes with the civilian governor, future-U.S. President William Howard Taft.

His son, Douglas MacArthur, was one of only five men promoted to the five-star rank of General of the Army during World War II. In addition to their both being promoted to the rank of general officer, Arthur MacArthur Jr. and Douglas MacArthur also share the distinction of having been the first father and son to each be awarded a Medal of Honor.

==Early life==
MacArthur was born in Chicopee Falls, Massachusetts. His father was Arthur MacArthur Sr., a Scottish-born American lawyer, judge and politician who served as the fourth Governor of Wisconsin (albeit for only four days), a Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge in Milwaukee, and an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia.

His mother was Aurelia Belcher (1819–1864), the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, Benjamin B. Belcher. From his parents&#x27; marriage, he had one brother, Frank. After his mother&#x27;s death in 1864, his father remarried to Mary E. Willcut.

==Military career==
At the outbreak of the Civil War, MacArthur&#x27;s father attempted to secure him an appointment to the United States Military Academy, even so far as having a Wisconsin Senator take young MacArthur to appeal to President Abraham Lincoln at the White House, but was unsuccessful as all the available slots were filled.

===American Civil War===
On August 4, 1862, his father secured a commission for him as a first lieutenant and appointed as adjutant of the 24th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment, seeing action at Chickamauga, Stones River, Chattanooga, the Atlanta Campaign and Franklin.

At the Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863, during the Chattanooga Campaign, the 18-year-old MacArthur inspired his regiment during a largely uncoordinated and spontaneous frontal assault of Union forces against entrenched Confederate forces on a hilltop. During the charge the regimental flags were carried in front, so that every flag-bearer was constantly a target, causing immense casualty among them. MacArthur seized the flag from a fallen comrade and planted the regimental flag on the crest of Missionary Ridge at a particularly critical moment, shouting &quot;On, Wisconsin.&quot; For these actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. He was brevetted colonel in the Union Army the following year. Only 19 years old at the time, he became nationally recognized as &quot;The Boy Colonel&quot; (not to be confused with Henry K. Burgwyn, known as the &quot;Boy Colonel of the Confederacy&quot;).

MacArthur was severely wounded in the Battle of Franklin, receiving bullet wounds to the chest and leg from a rebel officer&#x27;s pistol, but would ultimately survive.

On January 25, 1864, he was promoted to major and about a year and a half later, on May 18, 1865, to lieutenant colonel – shortly before he was mustered out of service on June 10, 1865. In recognition of his gallantry in action he received brevets (honorary promotions) to lieutenant colonel and colonel dated March 15, 1865.

===American Indian Wars===
With the conclusion of the Civil War in June 1865, MacArthur resigned his commission and began the study of law. After just a few months, however, he decided this was not a good fit for him, so he resumed his career with the Army. He was recommissioned on February 23, 1866, as a second lieutenant in the Regular Army&#x27;s 17th Infantry Regiment, with a promotion the following day to first lieutenant. Because of his outstanding record of performance during the Civil War, he was promoted in September of that year to captain. However, he would remain a captain for the following two decades, as promotion was slow in the small peacetime army.

Between 1866 and 1884, MacArthur completed assignments in Pennsylvania, New York, Utah Territory, Louisiana, and Arkansas.

In 1884, MacArthur became the post commander of Fort Selden, in New Mexico. The following year, he took part in the campaign against Geronimo. In 1889, he was promoted to Assistant Adjutant General of the Army with the rank of major, and was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1897.

===Spanish–American War (1898)===
Following the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, MacArthur was serving as the adjutant general of the Third Army Corps in Georgia. In June 1898 he was brevetted to brigadier general in the volunteer army. He was appointed as commanding general of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Eighth Army Corps and led it to victory at the Battle of Manila on August 12, 1898. He was promoted to major general on August 13, 1898.

===Philippine–American War (1899–1902)===
He led the 2nd Division of Eighth Corps during the Philippine–American War at the Battle of Manila (1899), the Malolos campaign and the Northern Offensive. When the American occupation of the Philippines turned from conventional battles to guerrilla warfare, MacArthur commanded the Department of Northern Luzon. In January 1900, he was appointed brigadier general in the Regular Army and was appointed military governor of the Philippines with command of Eighth Corps, replacing General Elwell S. Otis.

He authorized the expedition, under General Frederick Funston, that resulted in the capture of Emilio Aguinaldo. MacArthur persuaded the captured Aguinaldo to cease fighting and to swear allegiance to the United States. He was promoted to major general in the Regular Army on February 5, 1901.

During the war, President William McKinley relieved Major General Elwell S. Otis of command and replaced him with MacArthur giving him the title of Military Governor of the Philippines on May 6, 1900. However, William Howard Taft was appointed to head the Philippine Commission by McKinley and arrived to Manila in June 1900 to effect the transition from military to civil government. MacArthur firmly opposed the timing of direct involvement by the Philippine Commission as he did not believe the Philippines was ready for civil rule yet. Both Taft and MacArthur, in separate correspondences, informed Secretary of War, Elihu Root, of the contention between each other and their differing views on the future of the Philippines. On February 27, 1901, shortly after promoting MacArthur to the rank of major general, Secretary Root informed Major General Adna R. Chaffee that he would succeed MacArthur as military governor in the Philippines. However, Chaffee would be subordinate to William Howard Taft, who would be appointed as Civilian Governor.

On June 21, 1901, Root&#x27;s War Department informed MacArthur that Chaffee was to replace him as military head in the Philippines with the change to take place on July 4, 1901. Taft decided, &quot;four, possibly five and two small parts of others&quot;, of the 27 organized provinces across the Philippines (16 additional provinces remained unorganized at the end of 1900), &quot;in which armed insurrection continues, will remain under the executive jurisdiction of the military governor and commanding general&quot;. The contentiousness between Taft and MacArthur seemed all too apparent as Taft stated publicly that neither his approach of municipal code nor the provincial government act under both Otis and MacArthur would form a perfect government, &quot;though it was possible to make the former much more complete than the latter&quot;. Taft further distanced himself and work by characterizing prior military efforts as &quot;two experiments in municipal government under the administrations of General Otis and General MacArthur before the [Philippine] Commission began its legislative work&quot;.

After the combined ceremony installing Taft and change of command from MacArthur to Chaffee on July 4, 1901, MacArthur packed his bags that same day and boarded a ship for the United States.

===Return to the United States===
In the several years that followed, he was assigned to serve at various times as commander of the Department of the Colorado, the Lakes, the East, and eventually the Pacific Division. When the Russo-Japanese War exploded in early 1904, eight American officers were promptly sent to the Manchurian front as observers. Chafing at the bit at his headquarters in Fort Mason, San Francisco, MacArthur requested that he also be assigned as a military observer upon hearing of the outbreak of war between Russia and Japan in 1904. He finally secured the appointment, but arrived in Manchuria in mid-March, 1905, just after the major fighting had ended with the Japanese triumph at the Battle of Mukden. When the Portsmouth Peace Conference was convened in August, MacArthur was sent to Tokyo as military attaché to the American legation.

During Secretary of War William Howard Taft&#x27;s 1905 trip to Japan, Taft also met with MacArthur, as he was now the United States military attaché to Japan, in Yokohama (likely at the Oriental Palace Hotel where MacArthur and his wife, Mrs. &quot;Pinky&quot; MacArthur, were staying). In the course of this meeting, it was decided 1st Lieutenant Douglas MacArthur would replace Captain Paul W. West as Maj. Gen. MacArthur&#x27;s aide-de-camp and accompany him on a &#x27;reconnaissance mission&#x27; to various Asian countries from November 1, 1905, through late June 1906 traveling over , per Douglas MacArthur vouchers.

On July 17, 1906, MacArthur, Mrs. MacArthur, and Douglas MacArthur sailed from Yokohama and arrived at San Francisco to resume his post at Fort Mason as Commander of the Pacific Division. In this capacity he was promoted to lieutenant general in September 1906, but though now the highest-ranking officer in the Army, was not elevated to chief of staff then or later. Brigadier General J. Franklin Bell had been made the chief of staff while MacArthur was in Asia on April 14, 1906, and subsequently promoted to major general on 3 January 1907.

In early 1907, MacArthur, after 47 years of devoted and distinguished service, was told by Taft&#x27;s War Department that he had been passed over for chief of staff of the Army. Instead of chief of staff, he was offered command of the Eastern department. MacArthur refused Taft&#x27;s offer of commanding the Eastern department, stating that it would mean a humiliating reduction in authority for him. MacArthur proposed that the War Department either accept his retirement or assign him to some &quot;special duty&quot; which would not be an affront to his honor. Shortly thereafter, MacArthur received orders to &#x27;proceed to Milwaukee, there to perform such duties as may hereafter be assigned&#x27;, but no further duties were given to him. Taft was inaugurated as President of the United States in March 1909, and MacArthur retired quietly from the Army on June 2, 1909.

MacArthur never did realize his dream of commanding the entire Army. He was one of the last officers on active duty in the Army who had served in the Civil War.

MacArthur was elected a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) in 1868 and was assigned insignia number 648. On May 6, 1908, he was elected commander of the Wisconsin Commandery of MOLLUS. He was elected as the Order&#x27;s senior vice commander in chief on October 18, 1911, and became the Order&#x27;s commander in chief upon the death of Rear Admiral George W. Melville on March 17, 1912. He held the office until his own death six months later.

==Personal life==
On May 19, 1875, MacArthur married Mary Pinkney &quot;Pinky&quot; Hardy (1852–1935), daughter of Thomas A. Hardy of Norfolk, Virginia. Together, they had three children:

* Arthur MacArthur III (1876–1923), a captain in the United States Navy who was awarded the Navy Cross in World War I.
* Malcolm MacArthur (1878–1883), who died young of measles.
* Douglas MacArthur (1880–1964), who was born at the Arsenal Barracks in Little Rock, Arkansas

On September 5, 1912, while addressing a reunion of the 24th Wisconsin veterans in Milwaukee, MacArthur was suddenly and fatally stricken by an apoplectic attack (now known as a stroke). As MacArthur recounted &quot;one of the most remarkable scouting expeditions of the war&quot;, he told his men, &quot;Your indomitable courage...&quot;, then halted his speech with the words, &quot;Comrades, I am too weak to go on&quot;. He sat back down and collapsed, dying moments later. A young medical intern, serving as a waiter at the banquet, pronounced him dead on the platform. Dr. William J. Cronyn, the Surgeon-General of the Grand Army of the Republic for the State of New York, and a veteran of the Civil War in the 30th Michigan, was also present and called Mrs. MacArthur but was unable to tell her of the General&#x27;s death over the phone.

Both Mrs. MacArthur and Major General Charles King, a retired officer and close friend of MacArthur, carried out MacArthur&#x27;s final wishes to not be dressed [buried] in his uniform and for the funeral service to be &#x27;utterly devoid&#x27; of military display. Except for MacArthur&#x27;s two sons, the only active military officer present at the funeral was a solitary colonel from a nearby fort. Finally, per MacArthur&#x27;s final wishes, he was interred in a cemetery in Milwaukee rather than in Arlington National Cemetery. He was originally buried in Milwaukee on Monday, September 7, 1912, but was moved to Section 2 Gravesite 856-A of Arlington National Cemetery in 1926. He is buried among other members of the family there, while his son Douglas chose to be buried in Norfolk, Virginia, the hometown of his mother, Mary Pinkney Hardy, and the site of the Hardy family home Riveredge.

The Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States prepared and printed a eulogy praising MacArthur&#x27;s military record and extolling &quot;his fervent patriotism, his unshaken loyalty, his silent and soldierly acceptance of conditions little looked for in view of his great services and exalted rank&quot;.

For some reason, Mrs. MacArthur was only granted a pension of merely $1,200.00/per year after MacArthur died September 5, 1912, whereas the widows of all other lieutenant generals were receiving $2,500.00/per year. Mr. James Flanders, a Milwaukee attorney and lifetime friend of MacArthur, led a long but successful fight to get Mrs. MacArthur&#x27;s pension raised to the amount equal to the widows of other lieutenant generals. William Howard Taft was President of the United States at that time (March 1909 - March 1913), Elihu Root was a Senator for New York at that time (March 1909 - March 1915), and the Bureau of Pensions administered pensions for military personnel from 1832 to 1930. The Bureau of Pensions had two duties: (1) assess and either approve or deny claims, and (2) pay approved benefits. During that same time period, the Bureau&#x27;s workload was significantly being reduced due to the death of many Civil War pensioners in the early 1900s.

Citation:

Just over eight decades later (1864–1945), his son, Douglas MacArthur, would also gain fame for leading U.S. forces to victory in the Philippines. Arthur MacArthur Jr. and Douglas MacArthur were the first father and son ever to each be awarded a Medal of Honor. To date, the only other father and son to be given this honor are former president Theodore Roosevelt and his son, Theodore Roosevelt Jr.
===Legacy===
Fort MacArthur, which protected the San Pedro, California, harbor from 1914 until 1974, was named after General Arthur MacArthur. Camp MacArthur, a World War I training camp in Waco, Texas, was also named for the General.

One of MacArthur&#x27;s fellow officers in the 24th Wisconsin was future United States Senator John L. Mitchell, the father of controversial Army aviator Major General Billy Mitchell. MacArthur&#x27;s son, General Douglas MacArthur, was a member of the younger Mitchell&#x27;s court martial in 1925.

The actor Tom Palmer (1912–1997) played Arthur MacArthur Jr. in the 1959 episode, &quot;The Little Trooper&quot;, of the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Child actor Bryan Russell (1952–2016) played Arthur&#x27;s four-year-old son, Douglas, the subject of the title of the episode, set at Fort Selden in the New Mexico Territory. Leonard Bremen (1915–1986) was cast as played Trooper Norkul, who takes a protective interest in young Douglas.

<text>Dame Emilie Rose Macaulay, (1 August 1881 – 30 October 1958) was an English writer, most noted for her award-winning novel &quot;The Towers of Trebizond&quot;, about a small Anglo-Catholic group crossing Turkey by camel. 

The story is seen as a spiritual autobiography, reflecting her own changing and conflicting beliefs. Macaulay&#x27;s novels were partly influenced by Virginia Woolf. She also wrote biographies, travelogues and poetry.

==Early years and education==
Macaulay was born in Rugby, Warwickshire the daughter of George Campbell Macaulay, a classical scholar, and his wife, Grace Mary (née Conybeare). Her father was descended in the male-line directly from the Macaulay family of Lewis. She was educated at Oxford High School for Girls and read Modern History at Somerville College at Oxford University. In 1906 her father, George Campbell Macaulay, moved to Southernwood, a grand house in Great Shelford, near Cambridge. She spent much of her time in the company of the poet Rupert Brooke, a family friend. During the First World War, she worked as a land girl in Shelford. Here she was inspired to write a collection of poems called &quot;On the Land 1916&quot; recalling the hard work and companionship of those days.

==Career==
Macaulay began writing her first novel, &quot;Abbots Verney&quot; (published 1906), after leaving Somerville and while living with her parents at Ty Isaf, near Aberystwyth, in Wales. Later novels include &quot;The Lee Shore&quot; (1912), &quot;Potterism&quot; (1920), &quot;Dangerous Ages&quot; (1921), &quot;Told by an Idiot&quot; (1923), &quot;And No Man&#x27;s Wit&quot; (1940), &quot;The World My Wilderness&quot; (1950), and &quot;The Towers of Trebizond&quot; (1956). Her non-fiction work includes &quot;They Went to Portugal&quot;, &quot;Catchwords and Claptrap&quot;, a biography of John Milton, and &quot;Pleasure of Ruins&quot;. Macaulay&#x27;s fiction was influenced by Virginia Woolf and Anatole France.

Her dystopian novel &quot;What Not&quot; (1918) deals with eugenics and misinformation in a fictional version of England. It was first published in 1918, then withdrawn and republished in 1919 with some passages removed.

During World War I Macaulay worked in the British Propaganda Department, after some time as a nurse and later as a civil servant in the War Office. She pursued a romantic affair with Gerald O&#x27;Donovan, a writer and former Jesuit priest, whom she met in 1918; the relationship lasted until his death, in 1942. During the interwar period she was a sponsor of the pacifist Peace Pledge Union; however, she resigned from the PPU and later recanted her pacifism in 1940. In the same period, she found new audiences through broadcasts on the BBC, and as a columnist in journals such as &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Listener&quot;, and &quot;Time and Tide.&quot; In January 1941, Macaulay wrote: &quot;The pageant of life is enormously enriched by the presence of so many foreigners in our midst...the uniforms of Polish soldiers mingle with those of the Czechs, Norwegians, Dutch and Free French...And not only foreigners. Driving in the country, you are continually hailed by the rich accents of young men in battle-dress from Alberta and Montreal, who seldom know where they are, and always want to go somewhere else. They are as a rule enormously charming&quot;. 

Her London flat was destroyed in the Blitz, and she had to rebuild her life and library from scratch, as documented in the semi-autobiographical short story, &quot;Miss Anstruther&#x27;s Letters&quot;, which was published in 1942.
&quot;The Towers of Trebizond&quot;, her final novel, is generally regarded as her masterpiece. Strongly autobiographical, it treats with wistful humour and deep sadness the attractions of mystical Christianity, and the irremediable conflict between adulterous love and the demands of the Christian faith. For this work, she received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1956.

==Personal life==

Macaulay was never a simple believer in &quot;mere Christianity&quot;, and her writings reveal a more complex, mystical sense of the Divine. That said, she did not return to the Anglican church until 1953; she had been an ardent secularist before and, while religious themes pervade her novels, previous to her conversion she often treats Christianity satirically, for instance in &quot;Going Abroad&quot; and &quot;The World My Wilderness&quot;.

Macaulay never married. She was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) on 31 December 1957 in the 1958 New Year Honours and died ten months later, on 30 October 1958, aged 77. She was an active feminist throughout her life.
