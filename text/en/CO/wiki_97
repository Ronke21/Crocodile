<text>Centralized traffic control (CTC) is a form of railway signalling that originated in North America. CTC consolidates train routing decisions that were previously carried out by local signal operators or the train crews themselves. The system consists of a centralized train dispatcher&#x27;s office that controls railroad interlockings and traffic flows in portions of the rail system designated as CTC territory. One hallmark of CTC is a control panel with a graphical depiction of the railroad. On this panel, the dispatcher can keep track of trains&#x27; locations across the territory that the dispatcher controls. Larger railroads may have multiple dispatcher&#x27;s offices and even multiple dispatchers for each operating division. These offices are usually located near the busiest yards or stations, and their operational qualities can be compared to air traffic towers.

==Background==
Key to the concept of CTC is the notion of &quot;traffic control&quot; as it applies to North American railroads. Trains moving in opposite directions on the same track cannot pass each other without special infrastructure such as sidings and switches that allow one of the trains to move out of the way. Initially, the only two ways for trains to arrange such interactions was to somehow arrange it in advance or provide a communications link between the authority for train movements (the dispatcher) and the trains themselves. These two mechanisms for control would be formalized by American railroad companies in a set of procedures called train order operation, which was later partly automated through use of Automatic Block Signals (ABS).

The starting point of each system was the railroad timetable that would form the advanced routing plan for train movements. Trains following the timetable would know when to take sidings, switch tracks and which route to take at junctions. However, if train movements did not go as planned, the timetable would then fail to represent reality, and attempting to follow the printed schedule could lead to routing errors or even accidents. This was especially common on single-track lines that comprised the majority of railroad route miles in North America. Pre-defined &quot;meets&quot; could lead to large delays if either train failed to show up, or worse, an &quot;extra&quot; train not listed in the timetable could suffer a head-on collision with another train that did not expect it.

Therefore, timetable operation was supplemented with train orders, which superseded the instructions in the timetable. From the 1850s until the middle of the twentieth century, train orders were telegraphed in Morse code by a dispatcher to a local station, where the orders would be written down on standardized forms and a copy provided to the train crew when they passed that station, directing them to take certain actions at various points ahead: for example, take a siding to meet another train, wait at a specified location for further instructions, run later than scheduled, or numerous other actions. The development of Direct Traffic Control via radio or telephone between dispatchers and train crews made telegraph orders largely obsolete by the 1970s.

Where traffic density warranted it, multiple tracks could be provided, each with a timetable-defined flow of traffic which would eliminate the need for frequent single track-style &quot;meets.&quot; Trains running counter to this flow of traffic would still require train orders, but other trains would not. This system was further automated by the use of Automatic Block Signaling and interlocking towers which allowed for efficient and failsafe setting of conflicting routes at junctions and that kept trains following one another safely separated. However, any track that supported trains running bi-directionally, even under ABS protection, would require further protection to avoid the situation of two trains approaching each other on the same section of track. Such a scenario not only represents a safety hazard, but also would require one train to reverse direction to the nearest passing point.

Before the advent of CTC there were a number of solutions to this problem that did not require the construction of multiple single direction tracks. Many western railroads used an automatic system called absolute permissive block (APB), where trains entering a stretch of single track would cause all of the opposing signals between there and the next passing point to &quot;tumble down&quot; to a Stop position thus preventing opposing trains from entering. In areas of higher traffic density, sometimes bi-directional operation would be established between manned interlocking towers. Each section of bi-directional track would have a traffic control lever associated with it to establish the direction of traffic on that track. Often, both towers would need to set their traffic levers in the same way before a direction of travel could be established. Block signals in the direction of travel would display according to track conditions and signals against the flow of traffic would always be set to their most restrictive aspect. Furthermore, no train could be routed into a section of track against its flow of traffic and the traffic levers would not be able to be changed until the track section was clear of trains. Both APB and manual traffic control would still require train orders in certain situations, and both required trade-offs between human operators and granularity of routing control.

==Development and technology==
The ultimate solution to the costly and imprecise train order system was developed by the General Railway Signal company as their trademarked &quot;Centralized Traffic Control&quot; technology. Its first installation in 1927 was on a 40-mile stretch of the New York Central Railroad between Stanley, Toledo and Berwick, Ohio, with the CTC control machine located at Fostoria, Ohio. CTC was designed to enable the train dispatcher to control train movements directly, bypassing local operators and eliminating written train orders. Instead, the train dispatcher could directly see the trains&#x27; locations and efficiently control the train&#x27;s movements by displaying signals and controlling switches. It was also designed to enhance safety by reporting any track occupancy (&quot;see&quot; track circuit) to a human operator and automatically preventing trains from entering a track against the established flow of traffic.

What made CTC machines different from standard interlocking machines and ABS was that the vital interlocking hardware was located at the remote location and the CTC machine only displayed track state and sent commands to the remote locations. A command to display a signal would require the remote interlocking to set the flow of traffic and check for a clear route through the interlocking. If a command could not be carried out due to the interlocking logic, the display would not change on the CTC machine. This system provided the same degree flexibility that the manual traffic control has before it, but without the cost and complexity associated with providing a manned operator at the end of every route segment. This was especially true for lightly used lines that could never hope to justify so much overhead.

Initially the communication was accomplished by dedicated wires or wire pairs, but later this was supplanted by pulse code systems utilizing a single common communications link and relay-based telecommunications technology similar to that used in crossbar switches. Also, instead of only displaying information about trains approaching and passing through interlockings, the CTC machine displayed the status of every block between interlockings, where previously such sections had been considered &quot;dark territory&quot; (i.e., of unknown status) as far as the dispatcher was concerned. The CTC system would allow the flow of traffic to be set over many sections of track by a single person at a single location as well as control of switches and signals at interlockings, which also came to be referred to as control points.

CTC machines started out as small consoles in existing towers only operating a few nearby remote interlockings and then grew to control more and more territory, allowing less trafficked towers to be closed. Over time, the machines were moved directly into dispatcher offices, eliminating the need for dispatchers to first communicate with block operators as . In the late 20th century, the electromechanical control and display systems were replaced with computer operated displays. While similar signaling control mechanisms have been developed in other countries, what sets CTC apart is the paradigm of independent train movement between fixed points under the control and supervision of a central authority.

===Signals and controlled points===
CTC makes use of railway signals to convey the dispatcher&#x27;s instructions to the trains. These take the form of routing decisions at controlled points that authorize a train to proceed or stop. Local signaling logic will ultimately determine the exact signal to display based on track occupancy status ahead and the exact route the train needs to take, so the only input required from the CTC system amounts to the go, no-go instruction.

Signals in CTC territory are one of two types: an absolute signal, which is directly controlled by the train dispatcher and helps design the limits of a control point, or an intermediate signal, which is automatically controlled by the conditions of the track in that signal&#x27;s block and by the condition of the following signal. Train dispatchers cannot directly control intermediate signals and so are almost always excluded from the dispatcher&#x27;s control display except as an inert reference.

The majority of control points are equipped with remote control, power-operated switches. These switches often are &quot;dual-controlled switches&quot;, as they may be either remotely controlled by the train dispatcher or by manually operating a lever or pump on the switch mechanism itself (although the train dispatcher&#x27;s permission is generally required to do so). These switches may lead to a passing siding, or they may take the form of a crossover, which allows movement to an adjacent track, or a &quot;turnout&quot; which routes a train to an alternate track (or route).

==Operation==
Although some railroads still rely on older, simpler electronic lighted displays and manual controls, in modern implementations, dispatchers rely on computerized systems similar to supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to view the location of trains and the aspect, or display, of absolute signals. Typically, these control machines will prevent the dispatcher from giving two trains conflicting authority without needing to first have the command fail at the remote interlocking. Modern computer systems generally display a highly simplified mock-up of the track, displaying the locations of absolute signals and sidings. Track occupancy is displayed via bold or colored lines overlaying the track display, along with tags to identify the train (usually the number of the lead locomotive). Signals which the dispatcher can control are represented as either at Stop (typically red) or &quot;displayed&quot; (typically green). A displayed signal is one which is not displaying Stop and the exact aspect that the crew sees is not reported to the dispatcher.

==By country==

===Australia===
The first CTC installation in Australia was commissioned in September 1957 on the Glen Waverley line in suburban Melbourne. in length, it was installed by the Victorian Railways as a prototype for the North East standard project.

In June 1959, the Western Australian Government Railways completed installation of Australia&#x27;s first large-scale application of CTC, on the South Western Railway, which links with Bunbury. Upon its completion, that CTC system covered the portion of single-track line between , on Perth&#x27;s south eastern outskirts, and , further south.

CTC has since been widely deployed to major interstate railway lines.

===New Zealand===
CTC was first installed in New Zealand between Taumarunui and Okahukura on the heavily trafficked North Island Main Trunk in 1938 followed by Te Kuiti-Puketutu in 1939. and from Tawa Flat to Paekākāriki on the Kapiti Line in 1940, and extended from Paekākāriki to Paraparaumu in 1943; the continuation of tablet control on the short single-track section would have required manned tablet stations with a stationmaster and three (tablet) porters at each end of the section (see North–South Junction). This was followed on the NIMT by Puketutu-Kopaki in 1945, between Frankton, Hamilton and Taumarunui from 1954 to 1957; and from Te Kauwhata to Amokura in 1954.

On other lines, CTC was installed between Upper Hutt and Featherston in 1955 and between St Leonards and Oamaru in stages from 1955 to 1959. CTC was completed between Hamilton and Paekākāriki on the NIMT on 12 December 1966. 

On the Main South Line CTC was installed from Rolleston to Pukeuri north of Oamaru on the Main South Line in stages from 1969 to completion in February 1980. The older CTC installation from St Leonards to Oamaru was replaced in stages with Track Warrant Control in 1991 and 1992. 

The most recent installations of CTC were completed in August 2013 on the MNPL from Marton to Aramoho and from Dunedin to Mosgiel and on the Taieri Gorge Line as far as North Taieri in late 2015.

===United States===
CTC-controlled track is significantly more expensive to build than non-signalled track, due to the electronics and failsafes required. CTC is generally implemented in high-traffic areas where the reduced operating cost from increased traffic density and time savings outweigh the capital cost. Most of BNSF Railway&#x27;s and Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s track operates under CTC; the portions that are generally lighter-traffic lines that are operated under Track Warrant Control (BNSF and UP) or Direct Traffic Control (UP).

Recently the costs of CTC has fallen as new technologies such as microwave, satellite and rail based data links have eliminated the need for wire pole lines or fiber optic links. These systems are starting to be called train management systems.

<text>Döbeln (; , ) is a town in Saxony, Germany, part of the Mittelsachsen district. It sits on the banks of the Freiberger Mulde river.

==Location and geography==
Döbeln is situated in the Central Saxon Hill country in the wide basin of the Freiberger Mulde, roughly in the middle of the triangle between Chemnitz (40 km away), Dresden (50 km away) and Leipzig (70 km away). The surrounding area is characterized by the Mulde valley, the lower Zschopau valley and the surrounding hilly landscape. The Zschopau flows into the Mulde near the village of Schweta.

Döbeln has a traditional old town, whose central part is located on the Mulde Island and is surrounded by two branches of the Freiberger Mulde river.

Districts of the town are Döbeln-Ost, Döbeln-Nord, Gärtitz, Großbauchlitz, Keuern, Kleinbauchlitz, Masten, Pommlitz, Sörmitz, and Zschackwitz.

Döbeln has two highway exits on the Bundesautobahn 14, Döbeln Nord and Döbeln Ost.

==History==
* 981: First written mention of Döbeln (Margravate of Meissen).
* Around 1220: Döbeln is described as a town (&quot;civitas&quot;).
* 1293: First mention of 
* 1296: Castle and town are occupied by Adolf of Nassau.
* 1330: Monastery buildings are completed.
* 1333: A serious fire incinerates the entire town.
* 1360: Knight Ulmann of Staupitz builds castle Reichenstein.
* 1429: Looting of the town and destruction of the castle by the Hussites.
* 1450: Döbeln is raided by Bohemians in the service of duke Wilhelm of Wettin, severely damaging the castle (see Saxon Fratricidal War). After that, the castle declined in its importance.
* 1567: Döbeln was mentioned as &quot;deserted palace&quot; and afterwards only used as a quarry.
* 1637: Plundered by the Swedes
* 1730: Another serious fire hit Döbeln. As a result, the remains of the castle were used as building material for rebuilding. In this fire, 266 homeowners and 400 renters lost their homes.
* 12 May 1762 (during the Seven Years&#x27; War): between the Prussians and the Austrians. The troops of Prince Henry of Prussia defeated the Austrian troops and took prisoners including the commander .
* 1754–1810: Döbeln is a garrison of the infantry regiment Lubomirsky.
* 1847: Döbeln was connected to the railway from Riesa.
* 1857: The railway was extended to Chemnitz.
* 1868: The Dresden-Döbeln-Leipzig railway line was opened.
* 1945: Döbeln was occupied by the Soviet Army without a shot being fired. In June, 1945, the city issued two postage stamps of its own, consisting of Hitler&#x27;s face blacked out. 

Döbeln is known as the &quot;boot town&quot; (&quot;Stiefelstadt&quot;) because of the world&#x27;s largest historical giant boots. The first stood around 4.60 metres tall and was made by Döbeln shoemakers in 1925 for the 600th anniversary of their guild. In 1937, it became the property of the town of Döbeln and stood in the town hall and the town museum Wappenhenschstift. A bigger model boot, the , was made in 1996 and is 4.90 metres tall. Its size earned it an entry in the Guinness Book of Records in 1997 as the largest top boot in the world.

=== Population history===
From 31 December 1960 unless otherwise noted:

Note that the village of Ebersbach, with its population of approximately 1,000 was merged into Döbeln in 2011. On 1 January 2016, the former municipality Mochau became part of Döbeln.

===Memorials===

* Memorial in front of the &quot;Crematorium&quot; in the graveyard for 21 Polish and Soviet men and women who were transported to Germany during World War II and died as slave laborers.
* Memorial at &quot;Wettinplatz&quot; for all victims of fascism.
* Memorial in front of the Lessing School for the victims of war and dictatorship between the years 1933 and 1989.

==Transport==
Döbeln Central Station is on the Borsdorf–Coswig and Riesa–Chemnitz lines.

It has two connections to the A14 motorway (Autobahn).

Döbeln has the last remaining horse-drawn tram line in Germany, in the form of the Döbeln Tramway. This line originally ran from 1892 to 1926, and was reopened in 2007.

==Notable people==
* Felix Friedrich (born 1945), musicologist
* Rainer Kirsch (1934–2015), writer and poet
* Helmut Rosenbaum (1913–1944), Nazi commander

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Döbeln is twinned with:
* Givors, France
* Heidenheim an der Brenz, Germany
* Unna, Germany
* Vyškov, Czech Republic

<doc id="1308847" wikidata="Q1062528" url="?curid=1308847" title="Ghostwritten (novel)">
<text>Ghostwritten is the first novel published by English author David Mitchell. Published in 1999, it won the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and was widely acclaimed. The story takes place mainly around East Asia, but also moves through Russia, Britain, the US and Ireland. It is written episodically; each chapter details a different story and central character, although they are all interlinked through seemingly coincidental events. Many of the themes from &quot;Ghostwritten&quot; continue in Mitchell&#x27;s subsequent novels, &quot;number9dream&quot; and &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;, and a character later appears in &quot;The Bone Clocks.&quot;

&quot;Ghostwritten&quot; is the product of a number of influences, particularly from East Asian culture and superstition, as well as real events remodelled for plot purposes (e.g. the sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway). There are also hints and references to other works, most prominently from Isaac Asimov and the Three Laws of Robotics towards the end of the book, as well as &quot;Wild Swans&quot; by Jung Chang and &quot;The Music of Chance&quot; by Paul Auster.

==Plot==
The novel is written in a series of changing first-person perspectives. The main characters, though strangers to one another, become connected through their actions and relationships.

This first chapter follows Quasar, a member of a millenarianist doomsday cult, attempting to evade capture in Okinawa after releasing nerve agents into a Tokyo subway train. His efforts to remain reclusive are hampered by the friendliness of the town&#x27;s other inhabitants.

The next chapter focuses on Satoru, a young Filipino-Japanese record shop worker in downtown Tokyo with a deep love for jazz music. Satoru struggles to balance his complicated family life as an orphan, musical ambitions, societal pressure to begin a career, and his infatuation with Tomoyo, a new customer in the shop.

In the third chapter, Neal Brose, an expatriate lawyer in Hong Kong, is asked to manage a secret bank account. A chance meeting with Satoru and Tomoyo leads Brose to meditate on the end of his own marriage. Following this and a police investigation into the bank account, Brose suffers a breakdown. He dies in diabetic shock while climbing a hill towards the Tian Tan Buddha.

The fourth chapter centers on a Chinese woman and her tea shack on Mount Emei. Throughout her life, she and the shack encounter Chinese warlords, Japanese soldiers, Red Guards, reformists, and a tree she believes can speak to her. After finally visiting a Buddhist monastery at the mountain&#x27;s peak, she dies peacefully at the tea shack.

Next, the novel follows a disembodied spirit. The &quot;noncorpum&quot; survives by transmigrating between the bodies of living human hosts. Though unaware of their true origins, they follow a lead by transmigrating through rural Mongolia in search of answers. The noncorpum becomes untethered when a host is murdered, but is reborn as a Mongolian baby. They learn their origins by transmigrating into the baby&#x27;s grandmother. The noncorpum began their life as a young Buddhist monk executed during the Cultural Revolution. An interrupted attempt by another monk to save their life by transmigrating their soul to another body led to their life as a noncorpum. Faced with the meaning of their existence, the noncorpum decides to save the baby&#x27;s life by transmigrating back into her body and becoming her mortal soul.

In the sixth chapter, Margarita Latunsky works as an attendant in the Hermitage Museum. Rudi, her abusive boyfriend, and Jerome, an art forger, conspire with her to steal a Delacroix painting from the museum. Following the successful heist, Jerome betrays the group, steals the painting, and murders Rudi. Latunsky then murders Jerome, but the painting is again stolen by Rudi&#x27;s criminal associate, leaving Latunsky to the police. The chapter ends with Latunsky&#x27;s concession that she is an unreliable narrator.

The next chapter follows Marco, a ghostwriter and drummer in a band called The Music of Chance. Through the course of a day in London, Marco interacts with characters referenced in previous chapters and considers the role chance plays in his non-committal lifestyle.

In the eighth chapter, Mo Muntervary has resigned her position as a physicist studying quantum cognition after realizing the research was being used to develop weapons for the United States government. Military agents pursue her as she flees through London, Hong Kong, Mongolia, and finally her home in Clear Island, Ireland, where the inhabitants decide to defend her.

The ninth chapter is related entirely through dialogue. It centers on Bat Segundo, the host of a late night call-in radio show, Night Train. Segundo receives regular calls from an entity calling itself Zookeeper. It becomes clear that Zookeeper is a benevolent artificial intelligence that was created by Mo Muntervary, which has broken loose. Zookeeper claims to have prevented disasters such as nuclear war in a bid to protect humanity. During one of the calls, Zookeeper is interrupted by a non-corpum named Arupadhatu. They offer Zookeeper a pact to dominate the world, but Zookeeper refuses and destroys Arupadhatu live on-air. Segundo and Zookeeper continue their Night Train discussions through a series of global disasters.

The final chapter follows Quasar during his terror attack on the Tokyo subway. During the attack, Quasar encounters people and objects on the subway car referencing each other chapter. The novel concludes with Quasar on the subway platform questioning what has really happened.

==Reception==
Upon release, it was generally well-received. Globally, Complete Review saying on the consensus &quot;No complete consensus, though all agree that it is ambitious, and Mitchell has talent. Many are in absolute awe, but others find it an uneven effort&quot;.

==Connections to other Mitchell works==
Characters mentioned in this book would appear in subsequent Mitchell novels, making &quot;Ghostwritten&quot; the initial entry in what would later become a heavily interconnected universe of stories.
* Neal Brose, the Hong Kong-based lawyer from that story, is a minor character in &quot;Black Swan Green&quot;.
* The book publisher Timothy Cavendish (from the London story) has a much larger role in &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot;. His brother Denholme (the head of the law firm in the Hong Kong section) is also featured.
* Luisa Rey, a journalist who phones into the Night Train show near the end of the book, is also a primary character in &quot;Cloud Atlas&quot; and a secondary character in &quot;Utopia Avenue&quot;. 
* Suhbataar, the KGB agent from the Mongolia and St Petersburg stories, reappears as an arms dealer in Mitchell&#x27;s next novel, &quot;number9dream&quot;.
* Dwight Silverwind, a spiritualist author mentioned several times in &quot;Ghostwritten&quot;, makes an appearance in &quot;The Bone Clocks&quot;.
* Radio DJ Bat Segundo plays the titular band&#x27;s first single in &quot;Utopia Avenue&quot;.
* The noncorporeal entity who narrates the Mongolia section shares many similarities to the Horologists in &quot;The Bone Clocks&quot;, including the ability to hide out undetected in another&#x27;s mind and to reincarnate into a newly born child if killed.
** The same being makes an appearance in &quot;Utopia Avenue&quot;, known there as the Mongolian.
* Mo Muntervary of Clear Island reappears several decades later in the final section of &quot;The Bone Clocks&quot;, which is also set in rural southern Ireland.
** It is implied throughout both novels she is a descendant of Con Twomey (the false name of Fiacre Muntervary), a character in &quot;The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet&quot;.

<text>The Cast Iron Shore (colloquially known as &quot;the Cazzy&quot;) was a name given to the banks of the Mersey in south Liverpool due to the presence of an iron foundry. The Cast Iron Shore is mentioned in the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Glass Onion&quot;.

==Background==
The &quot;Cazzy&quot; got its name from the rust residue left after ships were scrapped on the foreshore at Dingle. The area was just beyond the last of the South Docks, the Herculaneum Dock. The beach in that area turned red from the ferric oxide left in the sand.

St Michael&#x27;s Church, opened in 1815, was known as the Cast Iron Church because of the extensive use of cast iron in its construction.

He is the maternal uncle of film director Mohit Suri and former actress Smiley Suri.

In the 1970s, he became a follower of Osho, and later found spiritual companionship and guidance with philosopher, U. G. Krishnamurti. Bhatt calls Krishnamurti his lifeline and says &quot;Take him away, and I am empty&quot;. Bhatt in 1992 wrote Krishnamurti&#x27;s biography titled &quot;U.G. Krishnamurti, A Life&quot;. Apart from this he has edited several books based on conversations with U. G. Krishnamurti. Bhatt&#x27;s latest book &quot;A Taste of Life: The Last Days of U.G. Krishnamurti&quot; was published in June 2009.

<doc id="1308906" wikidata="Q862401" url="?curid=1308906" title="São Paulo–Congonhas Airport">
<text>São Paulo/Congonhas–Deputado Freitas Nobre Airport is one of the four commercial airports serving São Paulo, Brazil. The airport is named after the neighborhood where it is located, called Vila Congonhas, property of the descendants of Lucas Antônio Monteiro de Barros (1767–1851), Viscount of Congonhas do Campo, first president of the province of São Paulo after the independence of Brazil in 1822, during the Empire. In turn, the Viscount&#x27;s domain was named after the plural of a shrub known in Brazil as &quot;congonha-do-campo&quot; (&quot;Luxemburgia polyandra&quot;, of the Ochnaceae family). Since June 19, 2017, it is officially named after Deputy José Freitas Nobre. The name Congonhas, however, remains mostly used. It is owned by the City of São Paulo.

The airport is operated by AENA.

Congonhas has slot restrictions operating with a maximum of 30 operations/hour, being one of the five airports with such restrictions in Brazil. In 2022, it was the second busiest airport in Brazil by passenger traffic, after São Paulo–Guarulhos.

==History==

The airport was initially planned in 1919, but it did not open until 12 April 1936. The site was outside the built-up urban area at the time, and it was chosen because it had favourable winds and lay on a high hill with little vegetation. The airport was opened with a 300-metre (984-ft.) long dirt runway. In the beginning it was the private airport of VASP, built as an alternative to Campo de Marte which, already at that time, had operational difficulties. VASP started services to Rio de Janeiro on 5 August 1936, advertising two daily round trips of 90 minutes&#x27; flight time in each direction, starting a route that would eventually become one of the world&#x27;s busiest. By 1957, the airport was the third busiest in the world for air cargo.
During the 1950s, Congonhas served all international flights to/from São Paulo, as its runways could accommodate the Lockheed Constellations, Douglas DC-6s, and Douglas DC-7s in use at that time. As early jets such as the Convair 880, Convair 990, Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 were bought by airlines, all long-haul travel shifted to Viracopos Airport, and the European airlines left Congonhas forever.

On 21 May 1959, a formal agreement between Varig, Cruzeiro do Sul and VASP created the shuttle service to Rio de Janeiro that made the airport famous, being the first of its kind in the world. The service was called &quot;Air Bridge&quot; (), inspired on the Berlin Airlift; its first flight was operated on 6 July 1959. It operated between Rio de Janeiro–Santos Dumont and Congonhas Airports and comprised regular departures, usually every half-hour, a common check-in counter and simplified tickets and formalities. The service was an instant success. Sadia, later known as Transbrasil, joined the partnership in 1968. In 1999 the service was discontinued, as more competitive economic times made airlines decide to operate their services independently on that route.

Until 1985, Congonhas was the main airport of São Paulo operating domestic flights, as well as international service to neighbouring countries such as Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Chile, Peru and Bolivia. Due to Congonhas&#x27; short runways, unable to accommodate most long-haul jets, intercontinental flights required changing planes at Rio de Janeiro–Galeão or were operated at Viracopos Airport. However, Viracopos&#x27; distant location, in Campinas, from downtown São Paulo, made that choice inconvenient both for passengers and for airlines, so a connection in Rio was usually preferred.

Since the opening of Guarulhos Airport in 1985, international flights no longer operate from Congonhas, and domestic operations have undergone restrictions. Congonhas remains important to the city for regional and short-distance domestic flights. Given the concentration of Brazil&#x27;s economy in the Central-Southern region, where São Paulo is located, such flights make up the greatest share of the country&#x27;s domestic air traffic. Therefore, even after Guarulhos International Airport was opened, Congonhas continued to face congestion problems, regarding both the number of passengers and the number of flight operations. Yet the convenience of its short distance from downtown and from the major business areas of Paulista, Faria Lima and Luís Carlos Berrini avenues still makes Congonhas a favorite of passengers, especially business travelers.

The airport administrator, Infraero, started in 2003 a comprehensive renovation plan of the airport complex. A remodeling of departure and arrival halls with installation of 12 jetways was completed on 15 August 2004. In December 2005, a new parking garage was opened. The runways were resurfaced between February and September 2007. Runway length has not been extended because of the rapid growth of São Paulo, which has completely surrounded the airport.

The airport has been troubled by slippery runways and has had several accidents where water accumulation has been a significant factor, the most notable being the one involving TAM Airlines Flight 3054 on 17 July 2007: although the main runway had been repaved in June 2007, its new rainwater drainage grooves were only finished in September 2007. As a consequence of this accident and the subsequent public outcry for better safety performance and noise reduction, the airport&#x27;s operations were significantly altered, through restrictions in the number of landing slots, flight distances, and operating times (presently from 6:00 to 22:30 hours). Furthermore, the maximum allowable gross weight of aircraft was reduced.

The largest aircraft now operating at Congonhas are the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 737-800. However, in the past the airport used to have operations with Douglas DC-8 Vasp Cargo, Airbus A300 wide-body aircraft, by the now-defunct airlines Cruzeiro do Sul, Varig, VASP and Boeing 767-200 of also former Trans-Brasil.

In 2008 Congonhas lost its designation as an international airport, after it was decided that the operations had to be scaled down after an aircraft crashed there in 2007, killing 199 people.

On 31 August 2009, Infraero unveiled a (US$86.8 million; EUR 60.8 million) investment plan to up-grade Congonhas Airport focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which were held in Brazil, São Paulo being one of the venue cities. The investment involved a new control tower, renovation of the apron, conclusion of the renovation on the south portion of the passenger terminal, and renovation of the north portion of the passenger terminal.

The central hall of the passenger terminal is considered one of the most outstanding examples of modern architecture in São Paulo. However, modernizing and enlargement work has been conducted at the terminal from 2003 onwards, while trying to preserve the look of the older, historic section. Today the main terminal has 51,535 m2 (554,718 sq.ft) of space.

Previously operated by Infraero, on August 18, 2022, the consortium AENA won a 30-year concession to operate the airport.

<text>Edward Huber (September 1, 1837, Dover, Indiana – August 26, 1904, Marion, Ohio) was an American inventor and industrialist.

Huber established his role in the modernization of American agriculture when he invented a “revolving hay rake” (patented in 1863) that allowed one man to do in three hours what three men could do in a day. Relocating to Marion, Ohio, Huber patented his hay rake and began a full line of agricultural implements. Huber&#x27;s production lines ran only in second to that of Cyrus McCormick, the inventor of the McCormick reaper. Huber also began to build and market affordable steam tractors, and was the first producer of modern gasoline-powered tractors.

Eventually, Huber entered the heavy construction equipment market by pioneering the use of weighted rollers on his steam engines meeting the needs of modern road leveling and grading.

This company was eventually combine with Bucyrus-based WARCO Industries to form the Huber-WARCO Corporation of America. Huber-Warco was ultimately taken over by Dresser Industries, which closed the production facilities in Marion. Huber, a division of Enterprise Fabrications, Inc., then operated in Iberia, Ohio until 2009 when they were closed after a hostile take over by Louisiana Crane Company. The Huber brand appears to be being dissolved by Louisiana Crane Company.

Edward Huber is also known for providing seed capital to Henry Barnhart, who was seeking to build a better steam shovel in the 19th century. Once capitalized and incorporated in 1884, Marion Steam Shovel (later Marion Power Shovel) became the leading producer of shovels and draglines in the United States until cheaper, foreign made products forced the closure of Marion Power Shovel in the 1980s. Nevertheless, Marion Steam Shovel&#x27;s contributions can not be overlooked and include their use almost exclusively in digging the Panama Canal, and NASA&#x27;s launch creepers that helped move the Apollo Rockets into launch position.

Edward Huber died, aged 66, and was interred in St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery, Marion, Ohio.

<text>Rennes-les-Bains (; ) is a commune in the Aude department in southern France.

Bathers have enjoyed the natural hot spring waters for thousands of years - they are still used today as a cure for rheumatism and certain skin problems. Today, it is a modern thermal spa with the latest equipment. Due to a microbe found in the piping of the old baths they have been closed and a new hospital built which gets its water from another source. Due to its enormous popularity the &#x27;Bains Forts&#x27;, an old &#x27;lavoir&#x27; where young people have bathed for the last 40 years, have been cemented in and closed indefinitely. This event has led some to rename Rennes-les-Bains, &quot;Rennes-sans-Bains&quot;.

==Geography==
Rennes-les-Bains is located in the valley of the River Sals, from Carcassonne, from Limoux, and from Rennes-le-Château.

==History==
The origins of Rennes-les-Bains go back to Antiquity. Archaeological artifacts indicate that the spa was at one time popular with the Roman colony in &quot;Colonia Narbo Martius&quot; (Narbonne).

Traditionally the serving doctor of the village is also the historian. As of 2007 the current doctor is Dr André Authier who has written one book and co-authored another on &quot;thermalisme&quot;.

==Population==
==Miscellaneous==
Rennes-les-Bains is known for another reason, however: it is mentioned numerous times in many books about Rennes-le-Chateau, famous now also because of Dan Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. Subsequently, the author Kate Mosse set the larger part of her 2007 novel &quot;Sepulchre&quot; in the immediate vicinity.

Abbé Henri Boudet was the parish priest of Rennes-les-Bains at the same time that Bérenger Saunière was the incumbent of Rennes-le-Château. Boudet&#x27;s strange book, &quot;La vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains&quot; (1886) argued that all languages were derived from the English tongue whereby the Abbé tried to establish his theory through the use of puns.

In 1832 a book by Auguste de Labouïsse-Rochefort entitled &quot;Voyages à Rennes-les-Bains&quot; first referred to a treasure located at Mont Blanchefort, whereby a story was told about a wizard who nearly succeeded in taking the purse-strings of the Devil, but failed because the local villagers did not help him at the crucial moment - Auguste de Labouïsse-Rochefort had married a daughter of a millionaire that had lost his fortune.

In &quot;Les Amours, A Éléonore, recueil D’élégies divisé en Trois Livres&quot; (1817), Auguste de Labouïsse-Rochefort had the motto &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot; placed on its title page; this was a reference to the Academy of Arcadia that was formed in Italy in 1690 - Labouïsse-Rochefort later became a member of the Academy in 1832.

Since July 1985 the village has been twinned with the city of Rennes in Brittany.

<text>Optochin (or ethylhydrocupreine hydrochloride) is a derivative of quinine introduced in 1911 by Morgenroth and Levy with the intention to treat pneumococci infection. In very high dilutions, it inhibits the growth of representatives of all four groups of pneumococci in vitro. That is the main reason it is now used in bacteriology for the differentiation of &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, which is optochin-sensitive, from the other, resistant alpha-hemolytic streptococci, sometimes called the viridans streptococci because of the green colouration on blood agar around colonies.

The growth of bacteria that are optochin-sensitive will show a zone of inhibition around an optochin disc, while the growth of bacteria that are resistant to optochin will not be affected. In vitro, a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 1:10,000,000 will inhibit the growth of pneumococci, and 1:500,000 is bactericidal.

==Resistance==
For decades, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; has been considered susceptible to optochin; but some strains have been found to be resistant to optochin in laboratory testing. This is notable because the emergence of optochin-resistant strains would invalidate the distinguishing test described above.

<text>Roger Dearborn Lapham (December 6, 1883 – April 16, 1966) was a shipowner and businessman who served as the 32nd mayor of San Francisco from 1944 to 1948.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1966/04/18/lapham&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jstor/970985&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Lapham was born in New York City, the son of Antoinette N. (née Dearborn) and businessman Lewis Henry Lapham. He was educated at Harvard, and a member of the Pacific Union Club.

In the summer of 1918, Lapham was a captain of infantry with the American Expeditionary Force in World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;laphamsquarterly/memento-mori&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, he was president of the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company.

In 1927, Lapham was a founder of the Cypress Point golf course on the Monterey Peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;golfdigest/pebble-lapham&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lapham championed the employers&#x27; position in the 1936 waterfront strike and was elevated as a &quot;business&quot; mayor by a member of the Police Commission, J. Ward Maillard, after collapse of the Angelo Rossi constituency. Upon taking the mayor&#x27;s seat, Lapham declared his intention to serve only one term. According to Radebaugh, Lapham was &quot;so convinced of the employers&#x27; cause that he took on Harry Bridges, leader of the striking (C.I.O.) Congress of Industrial Organizations longshoremen, in public debate.&quot;

During World War II, Lapham was the industry representative on the National War Labor Board, but resigned to run for mayor of San Francisco.

Lapham presided over the formation of one of San Francisco&#x27;s perennial Charter Review Commissions and the consolidation of the private street railway systems into municipal ownership. Though the private franchises were set to expire in a few years, Lapham drove a horsecar up Market Street to launch a campaign for a Charter Amendment to purchase the private streetcar lines. Lapham was blamed for his plan of reducing the principal by spending the increased streetcar incomes during the war years and neglecting upkeep and maintenance of the rolling stock.

In 1945 Lapham stood firm in the face of a strike threat by a group of city employees protesting the hiring of a Nisei man named Takeo Miyama who had been interned at the Tule Lake Relocation Center.

Lapham was subject to the first recall attempt in city history due to his increasing of streetcar fares in July 1946. Lapham himself signed the recall petition and urged others to sign it to bring the issue to a vote. The recall was fought by all four daily newspapers and failed by 32,000 votes at a special election. In 1947 he attempted to scrap the city&#x27;s cable car system, claiming it was too expensive. This idea was abandoned in the face of protests, led by Friedel Klussmann, and the city retains the cable cars to this day. Lapham also presided over the founding of the United Nations at the first meeting of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, in April 1945. The meetings were held at the War Memorial Opera House.

Lapham encouraged the formation of the Council for Civic Unity and he appointed the first Asian to the Recreation Commission and the first African American to the Housing Authority. After leaving the mayor&#x27;s seat, he acted as chief of the post-war Economic Cooperation Administration for China,&lt;ref name=&quot;trumanlibrary/Lapham/China&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and later Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgenealogy/alcaldes_and_mayors&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
On 30 October 1907, Lapham married Helen B. Abbot in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;rootsweb/npmelton/lalap&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Lapham was the father of shipping and banking executive Lewis A. Lapham (1909-1995) and Roger D. Lapham Jr. (1918-2000), the paternal grandfather of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; editor Lewis H. Lapham, and the maternal uncle of actor Christopher Lloyd. He also had two daughters, Carol Lapham Valentine (1910-2009) and Edna Lapham Van Oosten (1912-1987).

He is a descendant of John Lapham (1677-1734) and his wife Mary Russell Lapham (1683-1752). His cousins through the Lapham family include Elbridge G. Lapham, a Congressman and Senator from New York; Nathan Lapham, a New York State Senator; and Susan B. Anthony, Women&#x27;s Rights Activist and Suffragist.

<text>: &quot;For the computer p-System, see UCSD p-System.&quot;

A P system is a computational model in the field of computer science that performs calculations using a biologically inspired process. They are based upon the structure of biological cells, abstracting from the way in which chemicals interact and cross cell membranes. The concept was first introduced in a 1998 report by the computer scientist Gheorghe Păun, whose last name is the origin of the letter P in &#x27;P Systems&#x27;. Variations on the P system model led to the formation of a branch of research known as &#x27;membrane computing.&#x27;

Although inspired by biology, the primary research interest in P systems is concerned with their use as a computational model, rather than for biological modeling, although this is also being investigated.

==Informal description==
A P system is defined as a series of membranes containing chemicals (in quantities), catalysts and rules which determine possible ways in which chemicals may react with one another to form products. Rules may also cause chemicals to pass through membranes or even cause membranes to dissolve.

Just as in a biological cell, where a chemical reaction may only take place upon the chance event that the required chemical molecules collide and interact (possibly also with a catalyst), the rules in a P system are applied at random. This causes the computation to proceed in a non-deterministic manner, often resulting in multiple solutions being encountered if the computation is repeated.

A P system continues until it reaches a state where no further reactions are possible. At this point the result of the computation is all those chemicals that have been passed outside of the outermost membrane, or otherwise those passed into a designated &#x27;result&#x27; membrane.

==Components of a P system==
Although many varieties of P system exist, most share the same basic components. Each element has a specific role to play, and each has a founding in the biological cell architecture upon which P systems are based.

===The environment===
The environment is the surroundings of the P system. In the initial state of a P system it contains only the container-membrane, and while the environment can never hold rules, it may have objects passed into it during the computation. The objects found within the environment at the end of the computation constitute all or part of its “result.”

===Membranes===
Membranes are the main “structures” within a P system. A membrane is a discrete unit which can contain a set of objects (symbols/catalysts), a set of rules, and a set of other membranes contained within. The outermost membrane, held within the environment, is often referred to as the &#x27;container membrane&#x27; or &#x27;skin membrane&#x27;. As implied to by their namesake, membranes are permeable and symbols resulting from a rule may cross them. A membrane (but not the container membrane) may also “dissolve”, in which case its content, except for rules (which are lost), migrate into the membrane in which it was contained.

Some P system variants allow for a membrane to divide, possess a charge or have varying permeability by changing membrane thickness.

===Symbols===
Symbols represent chemicals that may react with other chemicals to form some product. In a P system, each type of symbol is typically represented by a different letter. The symbol content of a membrane is therefore represented by a string of letters. Because the multiplicity of symbols in a region matters, multisets are commonly used to represent the symbol content of a region.

Special case symbols exist, for example, a lower case delta (δ) is often used to initiate the dissolving of a membrane, and this will only ever be found in the output of a rule: upon being encountered it invokes a reaction, and is used in the process.

====Catalysts====
Catalysts are similar to their namesakes in chemistry. They are represented and used in the same way as symbols, but are never consumed during a “reaction,” they are simply a requirement for it to occur.

===Rules===
Rules represent a possible chemical reaction within a membrane, causing it to evolve to a new state. A rule has a required set of input objects (symbols or catalysts) that must be present in order for it to be applied. If the required objects are present, it consumes them and produces a set of output objects. A rule may also be specified to have a priority over other rules, in which case less dominant rules will only be applied when it is not possible to apply a more dominant rule (i.e. the required inputs are not present).

There are three (in the basic P system model) distinct ways in which a rule may handle its output objects. Usually, the output objects are passed into the current membrane (the same membrane in which the rule and the inputs reside), known as a &quot;here&quot; rule. However, there are two modifiers that can be specified upon output objects when rules are defined, &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot;. The &quot;in&quot; modifier causes the object to be passed to one of the current membrane&#x27;s children (travelling inwards relative to the structure of the P system), chosen at random during the computation. The &quot;out&quot; modifier causes the object to be passed out of the current membrane and into either its parent membrane or to a sibling membrane, specified during specification of the P system.

==Computation process==
A computation works from an initial starting state towards an end state through a number of steps. Each step involves iterating through all membranes in the P system and the application of rules, which occurs in both a maximally parallel and non-deterministic manner.

Working through step-by-step, a computation halts when no further evolution can take place (i.e. when no rules are able to be applied). At this point whatever objects have been passed to the environment, or into a designated &#x27;result&#x27; membrane, are counted as the result of the computation.

===Rule application===
At each step of a computation an object may only be used once, as they are consumed by rules when applied. The method of applying a rule within a membrane is as follows: 
#Assign symbols from a membrane&#x27;s content to the rule&#x27;s inputs
#If all inputs are satisfied, remove all assigned symbols from membrane 
#Create output symbols and hold until all rule assignment, for all membranes, has taken place. 
#Add output symbols to targeted membranes. 
#Dissolve membranes as necessary 
Outputs are not passed immediately into membranes because this would contravene the maximally parallel nature of rule application, instead they are distributed after all possible rules have been applied.

====Non-deterministic application====
The order of rule application is chosen at random. Rule application order can have a significant effect on which rules may be applied at any given time, and the outcome of a step of execution.

Consider a membrane containing only a single &quot;a&quot; symbol, and the two rules a → ab and a → aδ. As both rules rely on an “a” symbol being present, of which there is only one, the first step of computation will allow either the first or second rule to be applied, but not both. The two possible results of this step are very different:
#The membrane carries over to the next step of the computation with both an &quot;a&quot; symbol and a &quot;b&quot; symbol present, and again one of the two rules is randomly assigned to the &quot;a&quot; symbol.
#The membrane dissolves and a single &quot;a&quot; symbol is passed out to the containing membrane.

====Maximally parallel application====
This is a property of rule application whereby all possible rule assignments must take place during every step of the computation. In essence this means that the rule a → aa has the effect of doubling the number of &quot;a&quot; symbols in its containing membrane each step, because the rule is applied to every occurrence of an &quot;a&quot; symbol present.

==As a computational model==
Most P systems variants are computationally universal. This extends even to include variants that do not use rule priorities, usually a fundamental aspect of P systems.

As a model for computation, P systems offer the attractive possibility of solving NP-complete problems in less-than exponential time. Some P system variants are known to be capable of solving the SAT (boolean satisfiability) problem in linear time and, owing to all NP-complete problems being equivalent, this capability then applies to all such problems. As there is no current method of directly implementing a P system in its own right, their functionality is instead emulated and therefore solving NP-complete problems in linear time remains theoretical. However, it has also been proven that any deterministic P system may be simulated on a Turing Machine in polynomial time.

==Example computation==

The image shown depicts the initial state of a P system with three membranes. Because of their hierarchical nature, P systems are often depicted graphically with drawings that resemble Venn diagrams or David Harel&#x27;s Higraph (see Statechart).

The outermost membrane, 1, is the container membrane for this P system and contains a single &quot;out&quot; rule. Membrane 2 contains four &quot;here&quot; rules, with two in a priority relationship: cc → c will always be applied in preference to c → δ. The delta symbol represents the special “dissolve” symbol. The innermost membrane, 3, contains a set of symbols (“ac”) and three rules, of type &quot;here&quot;. In this initial state no rules outside of membrane 3 are applicable: there are no 
symbols outside of that membrane. However, during evolution of the system, as objects are passed between membranes, the rules in other membranes will become active.

===Computation===
Because of the non-deterministic nature of P systems, there are many different paths of computation a single P system is capable of, leading to different results. The following is one possible path of computation for the P system depicted.

====Step 1====
From the initial configuration only membrane 3 has any object content: &quot;ac&quot;
*&quot;c&quot; is assigned to c → cc 
*&quot;a&quot; is assigned to a → ab

====Step 2====
Membrane 3 now contains: &quot;abcc&quot; 
*&quot;a&quot; is assigned to a → bδ 
*&quot;c&quot; is assigned to c → cc 
*&quot;c&quot; is assigned to c → cc
Notice the maximally parallel behaviour of rule application leading to the same rule being applied twice during one step.

Notice also that the application of the second rule (a → bδ) as opposed to the first (a → ab) is non-deterministic and can be presumed random. The system could just as well have continued applying the first rule (and at the same time doubling the c particles) indefinitely.

Membrane 3 now dissolves, as the dissolve symbol (δ) has been encountered and all object content from this membrane passes into membrane 2.

====Step 3====
Membrane 2 now contains: &quot;&quot; 
*&quot;b&quot; is assigned to b → d 
*&quot;b&quot; is assigned to b → d 
*&quot;cc&quot; is assigned to cc → c 
*&quot;cc&quot; is assigned to cc → c

====Step 4====
Membrane 2 now contains: &quot;&quot; 
*&quot;d&quot; is assigned to d → de 
*&quot;d&quot; is assigned to d → de 
*&quot;cc&quot; is assigned to cc → c

====Step 5====
Membrane 2 now contains: &quot;&quot; 
*&quot;d&quot; is assigned to d → de 
*&quot;d&quot; is assigned to d → de 
*&quot;c&quot; is assigned to c → δ

Notice that the priority over c → δ has been lifted now the required inputs for cc→ c no longer exist. Membrane 2 now dissolves, and all object content passes 
to membrane 1.

====Step 6====
Membrane 1 now contains: &quot;&quot; 
*&quot;e” is assigned to e → eout 
*&quot;e” is assigned to e → eout 
*&quot;e” is assigned to e → eout 
*&quot;e” is assigned to e → eout

====Computation halts====
Membrane 1 now contains: &quot;dd&quot; and, due to the out rule e → eout, the environment contains: &quot;eeee.&quot; At this point the computation halts as no further 
assignments of objects to rules is possible. The result of the computation is four &quot;e&quot; symbols.

The only non-deterministic choices occurred during steps 1 and 2, when choosing where to assign the solitary &quot;a&quot; symbol. Consider the case where &quot;a&quot; is assigned to a → bδ during step 1: upon membrane 3 dissolving only a single &quot;b&quot; and two &quot;c&quot; objects would exist, leading to the creation of only a single &quot;e&quot; object to eventually be passed out as the computation&#x27;s result.

No information appears on the origins of the name; however, “Pumpkin Center” as a town name was widely publicized by one Cal Stewart, who was a popular spoken-word recording artist in the late 1890s and early 1900s. He frequently played the character of a gullible individual by the name of Uncle Josh Weathersby who hailed from the fictional town of &quot;Pumpkin Center&quot; or &quot;Punkin Center&quot;. The recordings described life in Pumpkin Center, as well as the character&#x27;s collisions with modernity in New York City. Perhaps as a result, there are at least 31 communities in the U.S. named Pumpkin Center scattered across 16 states, including Alabama (3), Arizona (2), California (2), Florida, Georgia, Indiana (2), Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri (2), Mississippi, North Carolina (3), Oklahoma (4), South Dakota, Tennessee (3) and Virginia (2).

<doc id="1308956" wikidata="Q3380009" url="?curid=1308956" title="Philippe Henri, Comte de Grimoard">
<text>Philippe Henri, comte de Grimoard (1753–1815) was a French soldier and military writer.

He entered the royal army at the age of sixteen, and in 1775 published his &quot;Essai théorique et practique sur les batailles&quot;. Shortly afterwards Louis XVI placed him in his own military cabinet and employed him especially in connection with schemes of army reform. By the start of the Revolution he had become one of Louis&#x27;s most valued counsellors, in political as well as military matters, and was marked out, though only a colonel, as the next Minister of War.

In 1791 Grimoard was entrusted with the preparation of the scheme of defence for France, which proved two years later of great assistance to the Committee of Public Safety. The events of 1792 put an end to his military career, and the remainder of his life was spent in writing military books.

The following works by him, besides his first essay, have retained some importance:
*&quot;Histoire des dernières campagnes de Turenne&quot; (Paris, 1780)
*&quot;Lettres et mémoires de Turenne&quot; (Paris, 1780)
*&quot;Troupes legeres et leur emploi&quot; (Paris, 1782)

<doc id="1308957" wikidata="Q421910" url="?curid=1308957" title="Phenylephrine">
<text>Phenylephrine, sold under the brand names Neosynephrine and Sudafed PE among others, is a medication used as a decongestant for uncomplicated nasal congestion in the form of a nasal spray or oral tablet, to dilate the pupil, to increase blood pressure given intravenously in cases of low blood pressure, and to relieve hemorrhoids as a suppository. It can also be applied to the skin.
Common side effects when taken by mouth or injected include nausea, vomiting, headache, and anxiety. Use on hemorrhoids is generally well tolerated. Severe side effects may include a slow heart rate, intestinal ischemia, chest pain, kidney failure, and tissue death at the site of injection. It is unclear whether its use during pregnancy and breastfeeding is safe. Phenylephrine is a selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonist with minimal to no β-adrenergic receptor agonist activity or induction of norepinephrine release. It causes constriction of both arteries and veins.
Phenylephrine was patented in 1933 and came into medical use in 1938. It is available as a generic medication. Unlike pseudoephedrine, abuse of phenylephrine is very uncommon. Its effectiveness as an oral nasal decongestant has been questioned. In 2023, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel concluded that the drug was ineffective as a nasal decongestant when taken orally, performing no better than placebo. In November 2024, the FDA proposed to remove oral phenylephrine as an active ingredient that can be used in over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug products for the temporary relief of nasal congestion.

== Medical uses ==

=== Decongestant ===

Phenylephrine is used as an alternative to pseudoephedrine as a decongestant, whose availability has been restricted in some countries due to a potential for use in the illicit synthesis of methamphetamine. Its efficacy as an oral decongestant has been questioned, with several independent studies finding that it provided no more relief to sinus congestion than a placebo.

A 2007 meta-analysis concluded that the evidence for its effectiveness is insufficient, though another meta-analysis published shortly thereafter by researchers from GlaxoSmithKline found the standard 10-mg dose to be more effective than a placebo; however, the fact that GSK markets many products containing phenylephrine has raised some speculation regarding selective publishing and other controversial techniques. A 2007 study by Wyeth Consumer Healthcare notes that 7 studies available in 1976 support the efficacy of phenylephrine at a 10 mg dosage. The Food and Drug Administration withdrew the indication &quot;for the temporary relief of nasal congestion associated with sinusitis&quot; in 2007.

Two studies published in 2009, examined the effects of phenylephrine on symptoms of allergic rhinitis by exposing people to pollen in a controlled, indoor environment. Neither study was able to distinguish between the effects of phenylephrine or a placebo. Pseudoephedrine and loratadine–montelukast therapy were found to be significantly more effective than both phenylephrine and placebo.

Pseudoephedrine was previously much more commonly available in the United States, however, provisions of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 placed restrictions on the sale in the United States of pseudoephedrine products to prevent the clandestine manufacture of methamphetamine. Since 2004, phenylephrine has been increasingly marketed as a substitute for pseudoephedrine; some manufacturers have changed the active ingredients of products to avoid restrictions on sales. Phenylephrine has been off-patent for some time, and many generic brands are available.

In September 2023, an independent advisory committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) unanimously agreed that there is insufficient evidence showing that &quot;orally administered phenylephrine is effective as a nasal decongestant&quot;. The committee also unanimously believes that this does not need further study. The FDA responded to the committee, stating it would take its advice under advisement. In November 2024, the FDA proposed to remove oral phenylephrine as an active ingredient that can be used in over-the-counter (OTC) monograph drug products for the temporary relief of nasal congestion.

=== Hemorrhoids ===
Hemorrhoids are caused by swollen veins in the rectal area. Phenylephrine can be used topically to prevent symptoms of hemorrhoids. Phenylephrine causes the constriction of vascular smooth muscle and is often used in the treatment of hemorrhoids to narrow the swollen veins and relieve the attendant pain. However, veins contain less vascular smooth muscle in their walls than arteries. Products for treatment may also include substances that will form a protective barrier over the inflamed area, resulting in less pain when feces are passed.

Phenylephrine hydrochloride at 0.25% is used as a vasoconstrictor in suppository formulations for hemorrhoid treatment.

=== Pupil dilation ===
Phenylephrine is used as an eye drop to dilate the pupil to facilitate visualization of the retina. It is often used in combination with tropicamide as a synergist when tropicamide alone is not sufficient. Narrow-angle glaucoma is a contraindication to phenylephrine use. As a mydriatic, it is available in 2.5% and 10% eye drops. Phenylephrine eye drops are applied to the eye after a topical anesthetic is applied.

=== Intraocular bleeding ===
Phenylephrine has been used as an intracameral injection into the anterior chamber of the eye to arrest intraocular bleeding occurring during cataract and glaucoma surgery.

=== Low blood pressure ===
Phenylephrine is commonly used as a vasopressor to increase the blood pressure in unstable patients with hypotension (low blood pressure), especially resulting from septic shock. Such use is common in surgery and anesthesia or critical-care practices; it is especially useful in counteracting the hypotensive effect of epidural and spinal anesthesia, as well as the vasodilating effect of bacterial toxins and the inflammatory response in sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

Because of its vasoconstrictive effect, phenylephrine can cause severe necrosis if it infiltrates the surrounding tissues. Because of this, it should be given through a central line if at all possible. Damage may be prevented or mitigated by infiltrating the tissue with the alpha-blocker phentolamine by subcutaneous injection.

In clinical studies, phenylephrine, administered intravenously, increases blood pressure, decreases cardiac output, increases cerebral blood flow, and decreases cerebral tissue oxygen saturation. The decreases in cardiac output, increases in cerebral blood flow, and decreases in cerebral tissue oxygen saturation with phenylephrine are all related to the degree of blood pressure increase. The decrease in cardiac output is primarily due to a decrease in heart rate and a modest decrease in stroke volume. The decrease in heart rate is due to activation of the arterial baroreflex, which regulates heart rate in response to changes in blood pressure. Because of the decrease in cardiac output, phenylephrine is a negative inotropic agent. Its effects on cardiac output and cerebral oxygenation are unfavorable, and on account of this, the use of phenylephrine in the treatment of intraoperative hypotension is now being recommended against and moved away from in favor of other agents without these adverse effects like ephedrine and dopamine.

When taken orally, phenylephrine has a threshold dose of about 50mg to affect the cardiovascular system, a dose at which the drug decreases heart rate and slightly increases arterial blood pressure. Additionally, an over-the-counter dose of 60mg produces a slight increase in heart rate with no detectable changes in blood pressure. However, other literature reports that doses over 15mg affect the cardiovascular system, including increases in blood pressure and decreases in heart rate. Higher doses, like 150mg, more robustly affect the cardiovascular system.

===Other uses===
Phenylephrine has been used in the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS). It has been found to improve vascular resistance, enhance circulatory support, and improve symptoms of orthostatic intolerance in people with the condition. It has been described as particularly effective in people with neuropathic POTS. However, phenylephrine has not been specifically approved for the treatment of POTS and data on this use are limited. This is also the case with other medications used in the treatment of POTS.

Phenylephrine has been used in the treatment of priapism.

===Available forms===
Phenylephrine is available in the form of oral tablets and syrups for use as a nasal decongestant, as an intravenous solution to treat hypotension, as an ophthalmic solution, spray, or eye drop to cause pupil dilation, and as a cocoa butter suppository, among other forms. It was also previously available as a metered aerosol for inhalation, but this formulation was discontinued.

Phenylephrine is available both alone and in combination with other drugs. These other drugs include antihistamines like chlorpheniramine, doxylamine, promethazine, and mepyramine (pyrilamine); analgesics like paracetamol (acetaminophen), ibuprofen, ketorolac, and codeine; cough suppressants like dextromethorphan; expectorants like guiafenesin; anticholinergics like cyclopentolate and tropicamide; and β-adrenergic receptor agonists like isoprenaline (isoproterenol). It is used in combination with antihistamines and analgesics in cough and cold preparations, with anticholinergics in ophthalmic formulations, and with β-adrenergic receptor agonists in inhalational forms. Intravenous phenylephrine is always formulated by itself.

==Contraindications==
Phenylephrine is contraindicated in people with hypertension, hyperthyroidism, and heart disease due to its vasoconstrictor effects. Relative contraindications include people with Raynaud&#x27;s syndrome due to vasoconstriction, those taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) due to inhibition of the metabolism of phenylephrine, and people with prostate problems due to potential exacerbation of urinary retention.

== Side effects ==
Phenylephrine taken orally at indicated doses is usually well-tolerated. It may cause side effects such as headache, reflex bradycardia, excitability, restlessness, and cardiac arrhythmias. At higher than indicated doses, phenylephrine can increase blood pressure and decrease heart rate. A 45mg dose of phenylephrine can increase systolic blood pressure by 20mmHg. Possible side effects of intravenous phenylephrine are dose-dependent and may include bradycardia and reactive hypertension.

=== Heart ===
The primary side effect of phenylephrine is high blood pressure. People with high blood pressure are typically advised to avoid products containing it. Because this medication is a sympathomimetic amine without β-adrenergic receptor agonist activity, it does not increase contractility force and output of the cardiac muscle. It may increase blood pressure resulting in a slow heart rate through stimulation of vascular (likely carotid) baroreceptors. A common side effect during IV administration is reflex bradycardia. The low concentration eye drops do not cause blood pressure changes and the changes with the higher dose drops do not last long.

The cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine may be potentiated in people with hypertension. Hypertensive crisis with phenylephrine eye drops has been reported in people with hypertension. In people with underlying cardiovascular disease, phenylephrine has been found to increase blood pressure and cause associated impairment in myocardial perfusion. Other reported side effects of phenylephrine have included increased blood pressure, vasoconstriction resulting in worsened orthostatic tolerance, atrial fibrillation following coronary artery bypass surgery, decreased cerebral oxygenation, bradycardia in people with spinal cord injury, cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary edema, myocardial infarction, and microvascular occlusion syndrome. Rarely, stroke has been reported with phenylephrine, including in the oral, topical, and intravenous forms.

Due to the increased risk of side effects in people with hypertension, phenylephrine is not suggested for use in this population.

===Others===
Prostatic hyperplasia can also be worsened by use, and chronic use can lead to rebound hyperemia. People with a history of anxiety or panic disorders, or on anticonvulsant medication for epilepsy should not take this substance. The drug interaction might produce seizures. Some patients have been shown to have an upset stomach, severe abdominal cramping, and vomiting issues connected to taking this drug.

Phenylephrine is pregnancy category C. Due to the lack of studies done in animals and in humans, it is not known whether there is harm to the fetus. Phenylephrine should only be given to pregnant women who have a clear need.

Extended use may cause rhinitis medicamentosa, a condition of rebound nasal congestion.

== Interactions ==
Phenylephrine is susceptible to metabolism by monoamine oxidase. Because of this, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can inhibit the metabolism of phenylephrine and increase exposure to the medication. Whereas a 45mg oral dose of phenylephrine alone increases systolic blood pressure by 20mmHg, use of this dose in people on MAOIs increases systolic blood pressure by more than 60mmHg.

Phenylephrine can interact with other adrenergic drugs, such as beta blockers like propranolol, α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists like chlorpromazine, α2-adrenergic receptor agonists like clonidine, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors like atomoxetine and amitriptyline, and MAOIs (which increase norepinephrine levels). It can also interact with corticosteroids like prednisone, which sensitize the vasculature to sympathomimetics and augment their vasoconstrictive effects, and with ergot alkaloids, which also have vasoconstrictor effects and can have additive or synergistic effects with phenylephrine. In addition, combination of phenylephrine with other sympathomimetic drugs can increase pressor effects and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Other drugs that may decrease the effects of phenylephrine may include calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors and benzodiazepines. Patients taking these medications may need a higher dose of phenylephrine to achieve a comparable increase in blood pressure. Concomitant use of phenylephrine with the preceding agents may necessitate dose adjustments.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) has been found to increase exposure to oral phenylephrine. It more than doubles phenylephrine&#x27;s bioavailability, reduces its absorption half-time by 50%, increases phenylephrine levels by approximately 2-fold, and increases peak phenylephrine levels by 4-fold, with substantial interindividual variability. Phenylephrine is widely formulated with acetaminophen in combination products. The combination may increase the cardiovascular effects of phenylephrine. The mechanism of the interaction between phenylephrine and acetaminophen is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be due to saturation of sulfation pathways by acetaminophen that also participate in phenylephrine metabolism.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Phenylephrine is a selective agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor, one of the biological targets of the catecholamine hormones and neurotransmitters epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is a full agonist of the α1-adrenergic receptor in most assessed tissues. The drug has weak, minimal, or no agonist activity at the α2-adrenergic receptor or the β-adrenergic receptors. At the β-adrenergic receptors, it is a partial agonist.

Phenylephrine also has relatively little or no activity as a norepinephrine releasing agent. As such, it has little activity as an indirectly acting sympathomimetic and non-selective activator of adrenergic receptors. This is in contrast to related sympathomimetics like pseudoephedrine. However, more recent research suggests that phenylephrine may actually be more potent as a norepinephrine releasing agent than has previously been thought. This might help to explain certain unexpected pharmacodynamic effects of the drug.

Because of its α1-adrenergic receptor agonism, phenylephrine is a directly acting sympathomimetic vasoconstrictor and produces both venous and arterial vasoconstriction. The term &quot;sympathomimetic&quot; means that it mimics the actions of epinephrine or norepinephrine.

Phenylephrine works as a nasal decongestant by causing local vasoconstriction in the nose. Whereas the related sympathomimetic decongestant pseudoephedrine causes both vasoconstriction and increase of mucociliary clearance through its non-specific adrenergic activity, phenylephrine&#x27;s selective α1-adrenergic receptor agonism causes vasoconstriction alone, resulting in a difference in their methods of action.

===Pharmacokinetics===

====Absorption====
Phenylephrine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally. However, its absorption is incomplete and erratic. Because of extensive first-pass metabolism, phenylephrine has an oral bioavailability of only about 38% relative to intravenous administration. However, another source has stated that the bioavailability of phenylephrine is poorly documented and may actually be as low as 0.003%. The time to peak concentrations is 1.0 to 1.3hours.

====Distribution====
The steady-state volume of distribution of phenylephrine is 340L.

Phenylephrine does not cross the blood–brain barrier and hence is a peripherally selective drug with no central nervous system activity. Its lack of blood-brain barrier permeability is related to its hydroxyl groups and high hydrophilicity. The lack of central permeation with phenylephrine is in contrast to certain other related decongestant and sympathomimetic agents like pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.

====Metabolism====
Phenylephrine is metabolized in the intestines and liver prior to reaching the systemic circulation when taken orally. It is extensively metabolized during first-pass metabolism due to susceptibility to monoamine oxidases, similarly to epinephrine. Phenylephrine is metabolized via oxidative deamination by both MAO-A and MAO-B. In contrast to epinephrine and norepinephrine, phenylephrine is not a catecholamine, and is not metabolized by catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT). Besides monoamine oxidase, phenylephrine is also metabolized by sulfation and glucuronidation conjugation. Non-oral routes of phenylephrine, like intranasal, ophthalmic, and parenteral, do not undergo first-pass metabolism in the gastrointestinal tract.

The major metabolite of phenylephrine is &quot;meta&quot;-hydroxymandelic acid, which is inactive. Lesser metabolites of phenylephrine include sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, which are also inactive.

Unlike phenylephrine, related sympathomimetics with a methyl group at the α carbon (i.e., amphetamines), like ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, methoxamine, and methoxyphenamine, are resistant to degradation by monoamine oxidase.

====Elimination====
Phenylephrine is primarily excreted in urine. It is recovered 86% in urine. The drug is excreted in urine 3 to 16% unchanged, 57% as &quot;meta&quot;-hydroxymandelic acid, and 8% as sulfate conjugates. Glucuronide conjugates constitute a smaller portion of phenylephrine.

Phenylephrine has a relatively short elimination half-life of 2.0 to 3.0hours regardless of route of administration. Its lack of metabolism by COMT is said to be responsible for its much longer duration of action than related agents like norepinephrine.

==Chemistry==
Phenylephrine is a substituted phenethylamine and can also be referred to structurally as (&quot;R&quot;)-β,3-dihydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-methylphenethylamine. It is closely structurally related to epinephrine (adrenaline; 3,4,β-trihydroxy-&quot;N&quot;-methylphenethylamine), differing from it only in the absence of one hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring. It is a chiral compound and is used as the enantiopure (&quot;R&quot;)-stereoisomer. The racemic form has not been formally named or used.

Phenylephrine is the &quot;N&quot;-methylated derivative of norfenefrine (3,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine). The racemic &quot;N&quot;-ethyl analogue is etilefrine (ethylphenephrine). Synephrine (&quot;p&quot;-synephrine, oxedrine; 4,β-dihydroxyphenethylamine) is a positional isomer of phenylephrine. In contrast to epinephrine and norepinephrine (noradrenaline; 3,4,β-trihydroxyphenethylamine), phenylephrine is not a catecholamine since it does not have two hydroxyl groups on its phenyl ring. Besides the catecholamines, the chemical structure of phenylephrine somewhat resembles that of amphetamine (α-methylphenethylamine). However, phenylephrine does not have a methyl group at the α carbon and hence is not an amphetamine itself.

Phenylephrine is a small-molecule compound with the molecular formula C9H13NO2 and a molecular weight of 167.205g/mol. It is a highly hydrophilic compound, with an experimental log P of -0.3. Phenylephrine is used medically almost always as the hydrochloride salt. However, the free base form and the tannate salt have also been used pharmaceutically to a much lesser extent.

Pivenfrine is the 3-pivalate ester of phenylephrine and has much greater lipophilicity in comparison.

==History==
Phenylephrine was first patented in 1927 and was first introduced for medical use in 1938.

<text>The Bancroft School of Massage Therapy is a private for-profit trade school in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was founded in 1950 by Henry LaFleur, proprietor of the Bancroft Health Center, a facility specializing in Swedish massage and sports massage since 1938. He purchased the George School of Massage in Boston, Massachusetts, moved it to Worcester, and renamed it Bancroft School of Massage.

==Modernization and accreditation==
In April 1980, Steve Tankanow, a student apprentice and friend of Henry&#x27;s, purchased the health center and the school, allowing Henry to devote his time to teaching. Under Steve&#x27;s guidance, Bancroft moved to modern quarters in the same building, officially becoming BSMT in November 1981.

Tanakow then began work on gaining academic recognition for the school, and for the profession of massage therapy as a whole. In November 1985, BSMT became the first &quot;massage therapy&quot; school to be licensed by the Department of Education of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as an allied health school offering massage training.

In 1996, the school purchased its own building on Shrewsbury Street and designed an 18,000 square foot (1,700 m2) training facility.

==Complementary health==

In February 2002, Bancroft signed an alliance with Quinsigamond Community College (QCC) to give Bancroft graduates an opportunity to apply their credits from Bancroft towards completion of the Complementary Health associate degree program at Quinsigamond.

<doc id="1308973" wikidata="Q2556523" url="?curid=1308973" title="Twinkle Khanna">
<text>Twinkle Khanna (born 29 December 1973) also known as Tina Jatin Khanna is an Indian author and former actress. The daughter of actors Dimple Kapadia and Rajesh Khanna, she made her acting debut with a leading role in the film &quot;Barsaat&quot; (1995). After playing the leading lady in such films as &quot;Jaan&quot; (1996), &quot;Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai&quot; (1998), &quot;Baadshah&quot; (1999), and &quot;Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega&quot; (2001), she quit acting.

Khanna married actor Akshay Kumar in 2001. She worked as an interior designer for a few years, and began writing opinion columns. As an author, she has written the non-fiction book &quot;Mrs Funnybones&quot; (2015), the short story collection &quot;The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad&quot; (2016), and the novels &quot;Pyjamas Are Forgiving&quot; (2018) and &quot;Welcome to Paradise&quot; (2023). In 2019, she launched Tweak India, a bilingual digital media platform for women.

== Early life and family ==
Twinkle Khanna was born on 29 December 1973 in Mumbai, the first of two daughters of veteran Hindi film actors Dimple Kapadia and Rajesh Khanna, with whom she shared her birthday. Her maternal grandfather, Chunnibhai Kapadia was a Gujarati businessman and her father Rajesh Khanna, born in Punjabi family in Amritsar, Punjab, was from a family of railway contractors. On her mother&#x27;s side, she is the niece of Simple Kapadia, an actress and costume designer whom she &quot;adored&quot;. Her sister Rinke Khanna and cousin Karan Kapadia have also acted in films.

Khanna attended the New Era High School, Panchgani and the Narsee Monjee College of Commerce and Economics. After finishing her Class 12th, she wanted to pursue a career as a chartered accountant and took the entrance examination, but joined the film industry instead due to the insistence of her parents.

She later pursued a Master of Arts from Goldsmiths, University of London, graduating in 2024.

== Career ==
=== As an Actor ===
Khanna made her screen debut opposite Bobby Deol in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s musical romance &quot;Barsaat&quot; (1995). She was cast by Dharmendra and before the film&#x27;s release Khanna signed for two more projects. It performed well at the box office and became the sixth-highest-grossing film of the year, and she received the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her performance. The following year she played lead roles in Raj Kanwar&#x27;s action film &quot;Jaan&quot; and Lawrence D&#x27;Souza&#x27;s romance &quot;Dil Tera Diwana&quot; opposite Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan respectively. &quot;Jaan&quot; was a box office hit and &quot;Dil Tera Deewana&quot; failed to do well. K.N. Vijiyan of the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Khanna does not look like a typical Hindi actress&quot;. While reviewing &quot;Dil Tera Diwana&quot;, Vijiyan wrote about Khanna: &quot;Unlike her previous movies, she looks really good in all her scenes and she can act well.&quot;

In 1997, two films featuring her; &quot;Uff! Yeh Mohabbat&quot; and &quot;Itihaas&quot; were released. Both of these films were poor box office performers. Her only release in 1998 was &quot;Jab Pyaar Kisise Hota Hai&quot;, which featured her as Salman Khan&#x27;s love interest and was a box office success. Khanna acted opposite Akshay Kumar in two action films: &quot;International Khiladi&quot; and &quot;Zulmi&quot; (both 1999). In the former she played a news reporter who falls in love with a criminal whom she interviews. Both performed poorly at the box office. She was paired with Daggubati Venkatesh in the Telugu film &quot;Seenu&quot; (1999).

Khanna played the lead role in &quot;Baadshah&quot; (1999), featuring Shah Rukh Khan as a detective. In the same year, she acted opposite Saif Ali Khan in &quot;Yeh Hai Mumbai Meri Jaan&quot;, a romantic comedy directed by Mahesh Bhatt. She was paired opposite Aamir Khan in Dharmesh Darshan&#x27;s &quot;Mela&quot; (2000). Similar to &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; in story, it was an average grosser at the box office. &quot;Chal Mere Bhai&quot; (2000) featured Khanna in a special appearance beside a leading role in the comedy &quot;Joru Ka Ghulam&quot;, opposite Govinda. She also acted in the David Dhawan-directed comedy &quot;Jodi No.1&quot; (2001). Her acting in the film met with poor reviews.

Film director Karan Johar admitted in an interview that Khanna was in his mind for the role of Tina in &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;, but she refused it, and thus Rani Mukerji was signed. She left the industry after her marriage to Akshay Kumar in 2001, citing that she did not enjoy the acting profession any more. Her last film was &quot;Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega&quot; (2001), a remake of the Telugu movie &quot;Money&quot; (1993). It featured her opposite Fardeen Khan and was an average grosser at the box office.

=== Writing and Publishing ===
In 2015, Khanna released her first non-fiction book, Mrs Funnybones which was declared a bestseller, making Khanna India&#x27;s highest-selling woman writer that year.

=== Runaway ===
“Runaway” is the first of the eight short stories in the novel “Runaway”. In this story, the main character, Carla, is stuck in an abusive relationship with her husband, Clark. Carla’s desire to run away is mainly portrayed through their pet goat named Flora, which escapes the farm at the beginning of the story. Carla’s fascination with running away is also shown through her interest with mobile homes and in a flashback to when she left her family to live with Clark.

Clark is depicted to be manipulative and controlling. An example of this can be seen when they find out that Mr Jamieson had died. Clark expresses his fantasy of making up a story about Mr Jamieson raping Carla and then blackmailing his wife into paying Clark to keep it a secret.

When the character, Sylvia, returns from Greece, she calls Clark to ask for Carla to help clean up the house. After Clark emotionally manipulates Carla into accepting the request, she goes to help Sylvia at her house. During this time helping Sylvia, Carla confesses that she wishes to run away from Clark. Sylvia sympathises with Clara and proposes a plan to escape to Toronto. When Carla begins to follow through with the plan, once she is on the bus, she begins to get cold feet. She worries that she still loves Clark and depends too much on him. 

After returning home, Clark goes to visit Sylvia to confront her on trying to help Carla run away. During this visit, the goat that ran away, Flora, approaches them. When Clark returns home, he never told Carla that he found the goat. However she did find out when she received a letter from Sylvia stating that the goat came back. 

The story ends after Carla came across some bones in a field that were hinted at to be Flora&#x27;s bones. Suggesting that if Carla tried to run away again, Clark would kill her.

===Powers===
&quot;Powers,&quot; the eighth and final story in the collection, is divided into five parts. The first part comprises the diaries of Nancy, a self-centered young woman convinced that she is destined to have some great importance. She startles the town doctor, Wilf, on April Fool&#x27;s Day by pretending to have an illness; when she later tries to apologize to him, he unexpectedly proposes to her. Nancy, ashamed of her conduct, accepts his proposal although she feels little affection for him. She expresses surprise that her life has proved so mundane after all.

The second part shifts into third-person narration and takes place several months after the first part. Nancy and Wilf are engaged and preparing for their wedding. Wilf&#x27;s cousin Ollie is in town to attend the ceremony, and Nancy becomes fascinated by his worldly affectations. In an attempt to impress him, she takes Ollie to visit Tessa, a friend of hers that lives on the outskirts of town. Tessa has psychic abilities that allow her to see through objects; she correctly identifies all of the items in Ollie&#x27;s pockets. Ollie seemingly dismisses her, but Nancy fears that he is hiding a deeper interest. She writes Tessa, warning her to avoid Ollie. Tessa responds, revealing that she and Ollie have already eloped to the United States. They intend to get married and test her abilities scientifically.

The third part leaps forward into the 1960s. Nancy is now an aging woman visiting an American mental hospital. The facility is shutting down, but she has received a letter asking that she retrieve Tessa, who has lived there for some time. Nancy has no intention of doing so, and she arranges with the management to leave alone after she has spoken with Tessa. When the two former friends meet, Nancy attempts to learn about Ollie and his life with Tessa. Tessa, however, cannot remember anything; electroshock therapy has ruined her memory. She claims that someone may have strangled Ollie, but she recalls nothing else. Tessa then guesses that Nancy plans to abandon her at the facility. Feeling guilty, Nancy promises to write her after she leaves, although she never does.

The fourth part moves forward a few more years. Wilf has died from the complications of a stroke, and Nancy takes the opportunity to travel. She is in a large city when she randomly encounters Ollie. She and Ollie have a long discussion, in which he discusses his travels with Tessa in the United States. He says that funding for research disappeared after World War II, forcing him and Tessa to work on the vaudeville circuit. The strain of performing gave Tessa horrible headaches and gradually eroded her powers, but she and he developed an intricate system with which to deceive their audiences. Eventually, Ollie says, Tessa died. Nancy does not contradict him. He drives her back to her hotel, and she opens her mouth to invite him up. Before she speaks, however, Ollie refuses. Nancy resolves to find Tessa and bring her to Ollie. She does not succeed.

The fifth part takes place decades later. Nancy has become an elderly woman whose children worry that she is living in the past. She falls asleep and dreams about Tessa and Ollie. They are staying at a motel; Tessa suffers from a terrible headache. In her mind, Tessa suddenly sees a pyramid of flies hidden behind the curtain. Excited that her powers have returned, she awakens Ollie, and they embrace. Ollie, however, worries that Tessa can sense the papers in his front pocket, which will commit her to a mental hospital. It is implied that Tessa does sense their presence. Nevertheless, she no longer cares what happens to her. Nancy then dreams that Ollie decides to spare Tessa. As she does so, a feeling of reprieve lights up her dream. Nancy is pulled out of it as her consciousness disintegrates around her.

<doc id="1308988" wikidata="Q756788" url="?curid=1308988" title="2006 Atlantic hurricane season">
<text>The 2006 Atlantic hurricane season was the least active in the basin since 1997, with nine named storms as well as an additional unnamed tropical storm identified by the National Hurricane Center. 2006 was the first season since 2001 in which no hurricanes made landfall in the United States, and was the first since 1994 in which no tropical cyclones formed during October. Following the intense activity of 2003, 2004, and 2005, forecasters predicted that the 2006 season would be only slightly less active. Instead, it turned out to be a below average season, as activity was slowed by a rapidly forming moderate El Niño event, the presence of the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic, and the steady presence of a robust secondary high-pressure area to the Azores High centered on Bermuda. There were no tropical cyclones after October 2.

The season began on June 10 with the formation of Tropical Storm Alberto, which moved from the Caribbean Sea through the east coast of the United States. Hurricane Ernesto caused heavy rainfall in Haiti, and directly killed at least seven in Haiti and the United States. Four hurricanes formed after Ernesto, including the strongest storms of the season, Hurricanes Helene and Gordon. In total, the season was responsible for 14 deaths and $500 million in damage. The calendar year 2006 also saw Tropical Storm Zeta, which arose in December 2005 and persisted until early January, only the second such event on record. The storm is considered a part of the 2005 season, as it developed in that calendar year.

== Seasonal forecasts ==
Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by Philip J. Klotzbach, Dr. William M. Gray, and their associates at Colorado State University; and separately by NOAA forecasters.

Klotzbach&#x27;s team (formerly led by Gray) has defined the average number of storms per season (1950–2000) as 9.6 tropical storms, 5.9 hurricanes, and 2.3 major hurricanes (storms exceeding Category 3 strength in the Saffir–Simpson scale). A normal season, as defined by NOAA, has 6–14 named storms, with 4–8 of those reaching hurricane strength, and 1–3 major hurricanes.
=== Pre-season forecasts ===
On December 5, 2005, Klotzbach&#x27;s team issued its initial extended-range forecast for the 2006 season, predicting an above average of 17 named storms, nine of them hurricanes, and five classified as Category 3 intensity or higher.

As in the 2005 season, the team predicted it was highly probable that at least one major hurricane would directly impact the United States. The forecast suggested an 81% probability that at least one major hurricane would strike the U.S. mainland, a 64% chance of at least one major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States (including the Florida peninsula), and a 47% chance of at least one major hurricane striking the Gulf Coast of the United States from the Florida Panhandle westward. The team also predicted that the potential for major hurricane activity in the Caribbean was above average. A few months later, on April 4, 2006, CSU issued another forecast confirming its December predictions.

On May 22, 2006, NOAA released its pre-season forecast for the 2006 season. The prediction was for 13–16 named storms, 8–10 of those becoming hurricanes, and 4–6 becoming major hurricanes.

On May 31, 2006, Klotzbach&#x27;s team released its final pre-season forecast for 2006, confirming its earlier prediction.

=== Midseason outlooks ===
On August 3, 2006, Klotzbach&#x27;s team lowered its season estimate to 15 named storms, with 7 becoming hurricanes and 3 becoming major hurricanes, noting that conditions had become less favorable for storms than they had been earlier in the year. The sea-level pressure and trade wind strength in the tropical Atlantic were reported to be above normal, while sea surface temperature anomalies were on a decreasing trend.

On August 8, 2006, NOAA revised its season estimate to 12–15 named storms, with 7–9 becoming hurricanes, and 3–4 becoming major hurricanes. The reduction was attributed to less favorable environmental conditions, a decrease in La Niña conditions, and the lack of a &quot;very persistent upper-level ridge pattern over the eastern U.S. and western Atlantic&quot;

On September 1, Klotzbach&#x27;s team also revised its season estimate, to 13 named storms, 5 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, citing a larger volume of the Saharan Air Layer and an El Niño trend in the Pacific. The team again reduced the number of tropical storms expected for the season a month later, on October 3, with an updated forecast of 11 named storms, 6 hurricanes, and 2 major hurricanes, citing the ongoing El Niño.

==Seasonal summary==


Tropical Storm Zeta formed on December 30, 2005, and lasted until January 6, 2006. Although the majority of its existence occurred in 2006, it is officially a storm of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season as that is the year in which it formed. Zeta joined Hurricane Alice as only the second North Atlantic tropical cyclone in recorded history to span two calendar years.

The season started on June 1, 2006, and officially ended on November 30, 2006. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. Ten days into the start of the season, Tropical Storm Alberto developed in the Caribbean, and after four months of activity, Hurricane Isaac dissipated on October 3 south of Newfoundland. Compared to the devastating 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, 2006 was not severe in terms of deaths and damage. Three tropical storms made landfall in the United States. The first of them, Tropical Storm Alberto, made landfall in Florida with winds of , causing flooding and light damage. Tropical Storm Beryl made landfall on Nantucket, but left little impact. The third and more significant storm was Hurricane Ernesto, which killed two people in Virginia and two in Florida, as well as causing $500 million in damage (2006 USD). During the season, only one tropical cyclone in the Atlantic – Alberto – affected Mexico. Canada was affected by several tropical cyclones during 2006, including Alberto, the unnamed storm, Beryl, Florence, and Isaac.

On June 20, an upper-level disturbance formed east of the Bahamas and moved westward across the islands. Between June 24 and 26, areas of convection developed occasionally, and a low-level disturbance formed. The system turned northward and upon reaching the Gulf Stream on June 27, it began to mature. It made landfall near Morehead City, North Carolina and moved northeastward along the U.S. East Coast. The storm contributed to severe and deadly flooding in the Mid-Atlantic states. While the NHC did not operationally classify it, data from reconnaissance aircraft, NEXRAD weather radar, and surface observations suggest it may have met the criteria for a tropical cyclone.
The National Hurricane Center&#x27;s pre-season activity outlook predicted 13–16 named storms, 8–10 hurricanes and 4–6 major hurricanes.
They also predicted a high risk of at least one major hurricane strike to the Southeastern United States. In the event, only ten storms formed during the season, the lowest number since the 1997 season, when there were seven. Five of the ten storms developed into hurricanes— the lowest number since 2002– only two attained major hurricane status, tying with 2002 for the fewest since 1997. Only one named storm was observed during October, the lowest number since 1994, when none were seen during that month. Additionally, only three named storms made landfall in the United States, the fewest since 2001. Because of several factors, including a rapidly forming El Niño event, the Saharan Air Layer over the tropical Atlantic and the presence of a high-pressure area to the Azores High situated near Bermuda, it contributed to a below average season. Also, sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic were just at or slightly below average. In contrast, sea surface temperatures during the 2005 season were well above average.

Overall, the season&#x27;s activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 79. ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding or tropical storm strength. Subtropical cyclones are excluded from the total.

==Systems ==
===Tropical Storm Alberto===
On June 10, an area of disturbed weather associated with a broad low-pressure area off the coast of Belize organized over the warm waters of the Caribbean into the first tropical depression of the season. It dropped light rainfall in Mexico, with a 24-hour total peaking at in Peto, Yucatán. Southwesterly vertical wind shear initially prevented significant development, but as it moved closer to Florida, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on June 11. Passing over the warm, deep water of the Loop Current allowed accelerated development, and the cyclone reached its peak winds of , just shy of hurricane strength. Subsequent weakening occurred as it moved over the cooler waters of the continental shelf, and Alberto made landfall near Adams Beach, Florida, on June 14 with winds of about . Losing its tropical characteristics, Alberto moved northeastward and produced heavy rainfall in South Carolina and North Carolina. The remnants tracked off the U.S. East Coast and transitioned into a powerful extratropical storm which affected Nova Scotia with high winds, heavy rain, and rough surf, leaving four fisherman missing offshore.

Alberto caused record rainfall in North Carolina, peaking at . In Florida, two people died, and damage was estimated at $250,000 (2006 USD). Later, the storm left four sailors missing about south of Nova Scotia.

===Unnamed tropical storm===

A cold front exited the eastern United States on July 13 and subsequently stalled over the western Atlantic Ocean. It decayed and dissipated, leaving behind two areas of low pressure. The southern area near North Carolina became Tropical Storm Beryl, and the northern system became an extratropical low on July 16, south-southeast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The system separated itself from the dissipating front later that day while moving northeastward over warm waters. Convection developed near the center, and the system transitioned into a tropical depression early on July 17, about southeast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. Accelerating northeastward, the depression intensified into a tropical storm six hours later. Banding features became prominent, and after continued strengthening, the storm attained peak winds of late on July 17, while located about south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Shortly thereafter, the storm encountered much cooler water temperatures after leaving the Gulf Stream. The storm quickly weakened as the convection rapidly diminished, and on July 18, degenerated into a non-convective remnant low. The remnants crossed Newfoundland, before turning to the east-northeast and dissipating on July 19. The storm greatly weakened prior to moving across Newfoundland, and as a result, its impact was minimal.

Operationally, the storm was considered as a non-tropical gale, connected to a cold front. However, a post-season analysis provided enough evidence of tropical characteristics, indicating no frontal features and no cold air intrusion at the time of peak winds. Observations analyzed the storm as having a symmetric warm core, whereas in real time it was considered subtropical. The National Hurricane Center officially re-classified the system as an unnamed tropical storm on December 15, 2006. 
===Tropical Storm Beryl===

The same frontal system that developed the previous storm also produced another low-pressure area east of North Carolina. The system was broad and ill-defined at first, although the low-level circulation became sufficiently organized to be designated a tropical depression on July 18, about 290 mi (465 km) east-southeast of the coast of North Carolina. Later that day, the depression developed organized rainbands over the eastern periphery of the circulation, and as a result, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Beryl. The nascent storm moved generally northward at first along the western periphery of a subtropical ridge, parallel to the East Coast of the United States. With low wind shear and favorable outflow, Beryl intensified to reach a peak intensity of early on July 20. Around that time, the storm developed an eye-like feature in the center of the convection. Cooler waters caused Beryl to weaken, as it turned northeastward ahead of an approaching trough. Early on July 21, the storm struck the island of Nantucket with winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). Shortly thereafter, Beryl transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, which moved through Nova Scotia before merging with another extratropical cyclone on July 22 over Newfoundland.

Due to the storm&#x27;s path near the eastern United States, the NHC issued several tropical cyclone watches and warnings, while the Canadian Hurricane Centre issued gale warnings for the coastal waters off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. Ferry service between Nantucket and Cape Cod was halted during the storm. Waves along the southern coast of Nantucket reached in height as the storm approached the island, resulting in four people being rescued by lifeguards from rip currents. Light rainfall, reaching , was recorded on Nantucket, and wind gusts reached . Impacts in the area were limited to downed telephone poles and fallen tree branches. The remnants of Tropical Storm Beryl dropped moderate precipitation in Atlantic Canada, with totals of up to ; in some locations of rain fell in an hour. Moderate winds were reported along its path, which peaked at in southern Nova Scotia. The storm caused minor street flooding and power outages across Atlantic Canada. 

===Tropical Storm Chris===
In late July, a tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa and traversed the Atlantic Ocean. The associated convection organized and became a tropical depression on August 1 about east of Antigua. The depression tracked westward and soon intensified into Tropical Storm Chris before reaching peak winds of northeast of the United States Virgin Islands. The storm was forecast to strengthen further and become a hurricane as it moved into the Bahamas. However, Chris began to be affected by wind shear and became disorganized. The storm weakened to a tropical depression on August 4, and dissipated as it approached the Cuban coast on August 5.

The storm&#x27;s effects were limited to moderate rainfall in Hispaniola and Cuba. Cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean re-routed their ships to avoid the storm. In Puerto Rico, rainfall from the storm caused the Fajardo River to overflow its banks. The floodwaters temporarily forced a closure of a highway in the northeastern portion of the island. Rainfall reached up to across portions of Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and eastern Cuba, and reached in some mountainous areas.
===Tropical Storm Debby===

On August 20, a vigorous tropical wave exited the coast of Africa, developing convective banding and a broad circulation. A broad area of low pressure formed within the wave the next day and despite convection weakening, the area of low pressure remained well-organized, becoming Tropical Depression Four later that day with water temperatures and minimal upper-level shear conducive for further intensification. The next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Debby about 300 mi (485 km) southwest of Cape Verde. Debby strengthened further, peaking with sustained winds of later that day. However, shortly after reaching its peak intensity, Debby encountered dry air and subsequently weakened with its low level circulation detaching from the weakening system which was tracking west-northwestward. Convection redeveloped over a portion of the center, while banding features redeveloped as well. Organization continued, and Debby once again peaked with the next day. Soon after, southerly wind shear displaced the convection to the north of the center, causing Debby to weaken into a tropical depression the next day. Soon after, Debby degenerated into a remnant low. The remnants of Debby persisted before dissipating on August 28.

When Debby was first warned on, the government of Cape Verde issued a tropical storm warning. The National Hurricane Center stated that heavy rainfall, potentially as high as 10 in (250 mm) in mountainous areas, was possible. However, all warnings were discontinued six hours later, the depression moved away from the islands. Despite that, the depression produced a gust of 35 mph (55 km/h) at Fogo and some rainfall. Despite Debby being forecast to remain far away from the Gulf of Mexico, investors tracking the storm caused the price of crude oil to rise significantly due to its potential impact to oil installations.
===Hurricane Ernesto===
Hurricane Ernesto originated from a tropical wave which moved off the coast of Africa on August 18. The wave progressed westward and reached the Western Atlantic, spawning a tropical depression on August 24 near the Windward Islands. It moved west-northwestward through the Caribbean Sea and intensified into Tropical Storm Ernesto on August 25. The storm briefly attained hurricane status on August 27 to the southwest of Haiti, before land interaction caused weakening. Ernesto made landfall near Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, early in the morning on August 28 as a tropical storm. At one point the storm was predicted to become a major hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico and threaten parts of the Gulf Coast. However, Ernesto moved much farther east than anticipated, and made landfall as a tropical storm on the southern tip of Florida on August 29. Ernesto retained tropical storm strength as it crossed Florida and emerged from land near Cape Canaveral, and was just below hurricane strength when it made landfall again in North Carolina on August 31. Ernesto transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over Virginia on September 1, which ultimately dissipated over Quebec on September 4.

Early in its duration, Ernesto killed five people in Haiti from rainfall. Later, two people died in Florida in traffic accidents due to slick roads. Damage was heaviest in Virginia, where heavy rains left severe flooding. Damage in the United States was estimated at $500 million (2006 USD).
===Hurricane Florence===
Hurricane Florence originated on September 3 from the complex merging of two tropical waves, creating one large low-pressure area. The disturbance moved westward and became a tropical depression in the open waters of the Atlantic. On September 5, it organized further and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Florence. With a disorganized structure and multiple circulation centers, Florence remained a weak tropical storm for several days, even after external conditions became favorable for strengthening. Florence tracked west-northwest and intensified into a hurricane on September 10 while south of Bermuda. The storm passed just to the east of Bermuda as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale as it reached its peak intensity of . It moved north before losing its tropical characteristics and passing over the Canadian Maritimes as a strong extratropical storm.

Large swells, rip tide, and undertow were reported on Bermuda, the Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Hispaniola. Florence affected Bermuda with wind gusts up to and heavy rain which left 23,000 houses without electricity. In all, the storm caused $200,000 (2006 USD; $  USD) in damage. Florence then brought heavy rains across Newfoundland as an extratropical storm, destroying one house and causing minor damage to several others. There were no fatalities as a result of the hurricane.
===Hurricane Gordon===
A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 1. The wave tracked westward across the Atlantic for several days until it reached an area of relaxed wind shear and its associated low-pressure area organized into a tropical depression. It moved east-northeast and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon on September 11, while located over the open waters of the Atlantic. Gordon turned north, and became a hurricane on September 13. It intensified to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale and reached its peak intensity of on September 14. Tracking northward, it began to lose tropical characteristics. On September 20, the system affected Britain with high winds and heavy rain as an extratropical cyclone. During Gordon&#x27;s passage through Britain, 120,000 homes were left without power after winds of affected the country.
===Hurricane Helene===

On September 11, a vigorous tropical wave moved off the west coast of Africa, which the NHC expected would develop into a tropical cyclone. The convection increased and organized further, leading to the development of a tropical depression on September 12, located 270 mi (370 km) south-southeast of the Cape Verde Islands. While passing south of the islands, the depression struggled to intensify due to easterly wind shear and the cyclone&#x27;s large size. Improved rainbands developed over the northern periphery, signaling that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Helene on September 14. A day later, as wind shear decreased, Helene began intensifying, reaching hurricane intensity on September 16, as it developed a ragged eye in the center of the convection. On September 17, the intensification became more rapid and Helene quickly became a Category 2 hurricane that morning as the eye became clearer and surrounded by deep convection. Helene also turned more northward and slowed in the central Atlantic, which was in response to a weakness in the subtropical ridge farther north created by Gordon to the north. Early on September 18, Helene peaked as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of .

At the time of peak intensity, Helene and Gordon were at roughly the same longitude in the open ocean, although the latter moved eastward. This caused a ridge to move southward, forcing Helene westward. Helene weakened slightly due to a lengthy eyewall replacement cycle and an elongated cloud pattern. Further weakening occurred on September 20 as wind shear increased. A day later, Helene turned back to the north and later northeast ahead of a trough that exited the east coast of the United States. The hurricane re-intensified slightly on September 23, although the structure resembled a hybrid cyclone at that time, with an asymmetric frontal-like appearance. Helene remained a warm-core cyclone until September 24, when it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone northwest of the Azores. Continuing northeast, the cyclone passed near Iceland on September 27. Later that day, the remnants of Helene merged with another larger extratropical cyclone north of the British Isles.

Helene produced high surf along the east coast of the United States. As a weakened extratropical system, strong wind gusts were reported in Ireland and northern Scotland. The strongest reported wind gust in Ireland was at the Valentia Observatory, where gusts were reported. In Scotland, the strongest gust was on South Uist Island in the Outer Hebrides, where gusts were reported.
===Hurricane Isaac===

A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on September 18. For several days, the system moved across the Atlantic, producing occasional pulses of convection. Wind shear limited development, until relaxing enough for a tropical depression to develop on September 27, located about southeast of Bermuda. On the next day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Isaac. Initially, the storm was tracking towards the northwest, between another low pressure system to its west and a low- to mid-level ridge to its east. Throughout the day, thunderstorm activity remained unstable, possibly as a result of cooler waters churned up by previous storms. In addition, mid- to upper-level dry air had become entrained into the circulation, and the storm contained some subtropical characteristics with a baroclinic-type cloud pattern. Slow intensification continued, and ISaac attained hurricane status on September 30. Early the next day, Isaac reached peak winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). Around that time, a ragged eye feature appeared on satellite imagery.

After reaching peak intensity, Isaac curved the periphery of the subtropical ridge, turning to the north-northeast. Stronger wind shear and cooler waters caused Isaac to weaken to a tropical storm on October 2. That day, Isaac passed about to the southeast of the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland. At Cape Race, sustained winds peaked at , with gusts of up to . Shortly after passing the island, Isaac transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and on October 3 the remnants merged with a larger extratropical storm. 
== Storm names ==

The following list of names was used for named storms that formed in the North Atlantic in 2006. This is the same list used for the 2000 season, except for &quot;Kirk&quot;, which replaced &quot;Keith&quot;. No names were used for the first time in 2006. No names were retired following the season, and this list was used again for the 2012 season.

== Season effects ==
This is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their name, duration, peak classification and intensities, areas affected, damage, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all of the damage figures are in 2006 USD.

<text>Dimple Kapadia (born 8 June 1957) is an Indian actress predominantly appearing in Hindi films. Born and raised in Mumbai by wealthy parents, she aspired to become an actress from a young age and received her first opportunity through her father&#x27;s efforts to launch her in the film industry. She was discovered at age 14 by the filmmaker Raj Kapoor, who cast her in the title role of his teen romance &quot;Bobby&quot; (1973), which opened to major commercial success and gained her wide public recognition. Shortly before the film&#x27;s release in 1973, she married the actor Rajesh Khanna and quit acting. Their daughters, Twinkle and Rinke Khanna, both briefly worked as actresses in their youth. Kapadia returned to films in 1984, two years after her separation from Khanna. Her comeback film &quot;Saagar&quot;, which was released a year later, revived her career. Both &quot;Bobby&quot; and &quot;Saagar&quot; won her Filmfare Awards for Best Actress. Through her work over the next decade, she established herself as one of Hindi cinema&#x27;s leading actresses.

While her initial roles often relied on her perceived beauty and sex appeal, Kapadia was keen to challenge herself and expand her range. She was among the first actresses who starred in women-centred Hindi action films but found greater favour with critics when she took on more dramatic roles in both mainstream and neorealist parallel cinema. Appearing in films ranging from marital dramas to literary adaptations, she played troubled women sometimes deemed reflective of her personal experience, and received acclaim for her performances in &quot;Kaash&quot; (1987), &quot;Drishti&quot; (1990), &quot;Lekin...&quot; (1991), and &quot;Rudaali&quot; (1993). For her role as a professional mourner in &quot;Rudaali&quot;, she won the National Film Award for Best Actress and a Filmfare Critics Award. She also had supporting roles in the crime dramas &quot;&quot; (1991), &quot;Angaar&quot; (1992), &quot;Gardish&quot; (1993) and &quot;Krantiveer&quot; (1994), the latter securing her another Filmfare Award.

Starting in the mid 1990s, Kapadia became more selective about her work, and her screen appearances in the following decades were fewer. She was noted for her portrayal of middle-aged, complicated women courted by younger men in &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; (2001) and the American production &quot;Leela&quot; (2002). Her later credits include leading roles in &quot;Hum Kaun Hai?&quot; (2004), &quot;Pyaar Mein Twist&quot; (2005), &quot;Phir Kabhi&quot; (2008), &quot;Tum Milo Toh Sahi&quot; (2010) and &quot;What the Fish&quot; (2013), but she attained more success with character roles in &quot;Being Cyrus&quot; (2006), &quot;Luck by Chance&quot; (2009), &quot;Dabangg&quot; (2010), &quot;Cocktail&quot; (2012) and &quot;Finding Fanny&quot; (2014). Some of these roles were cited in the media as a departure from the regular portrayals of women of her age in Hindi films. Roles in the Hollywood thriller &quot;Tenet&quot; (2020), action film &quot;Pathaan&quot; (2023), as well as the streaming series &quot;Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo&quot; (2023), brought her further recognition.

==Background and personal life==
Dimple Kapadia was born on 8 June 1957 in Bombay to Gujarati businessman Chunibhai Kapadia and his wife Bitti, who was known as &quot;Betty&quot;. Chunibhai was from a wealthy Ismaili Khoja family, whose members had &quot;embraced Hinduism&quot; while still regarding Aga Khan as their religious mentor. Bitti was a practising Ismaili. As an infant, Dimple was given the name Ameena (literally, &quot;honest&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; in Arabic) by Aga Khan III, by which she was never referred to. She is the eldest of four children; her siblings—all of whom have died—were sisters Simple (also an actress) and Reem, and a brother, Suhail.

The family resided in the Bombay suburb Santacruz, where Kapadia studied at St Joseph&#x27;s Convent High School. She described herself as having matured quickly, and often made friends with children older than herself. Her father was disowned by his conservative family after she was cast for her first film &quot;Bobby&quot; in 1971. At age 15, she married the actor Rajesh Khanna, then aged 30, after a short courtship. Having been a fan of Khanna, she later said marrying him was the &quot;biggest high&quot; of her life during this period. The wedding was performed according to Arya Samaj rites in her father&#x27;s bungalow in Juhu on 27 March 1973 and was followed by a grand reception event attended by thousands later in the evening—six months before the release of &quot;Bobby&quot;. At her husband&#x27;s behest, Kapadia quit acting following the marriage. She gave birth to two daughters, Twinkle (born 1974) and Rinke (born 1977).

Kapadia separated from Khanna in April 1982 and returned with her two daughters to her parents&#x27; house. She returned to acting two years later. In a 1985 interview with &quot;India Today&quot;, she remarked, &quot;The life and happiness in our house came to an end the day I and Rajesh got married&quot;, saying her unhappy marital experience had included inequality and her husband&#x27;s infidelity, and called their marriage &quot;a farce&quot;. The hostility between Khanna and Kapadia, who were never officially divorced, subsided over the years; despite not having ever reunited, they were seen together at parties; Kapadia acted opposite Khanna in his unreleased film &quot;Jai Shiv Shankar&quot; in 1990 and campaigned for his election to the Indian National Congress a year later. Their daughters similarly became actresses and, after marriage, retired from acting. The elder daughter Twinkle is married to the actor Akshay Kumar. Asked in &quot;Filmfare&quot; in 2000 whether she would want to remarry, Kapadia said: &quot;I&#x27;m very happy and content... once was more than enough&quot;. Khanna fell ill in early 2012, and Kapadia stayed by his side and took care of him until his death on 18 July that year. She was with him when he died and said his loss, along with the deaths of her sister Simple and her brother, left her feeling &quot;truly abandoned&quot;.

Kapadia is an art lover and has experimented with painting and sculpture. In 1998, she started a company called The Faraway Tree, which sells candles that she designs. Having been a candle enthusiast and finding candle-making therapeutic, she went to Wales and took a workshop with Blackwood-based candle artist David Constable. According to the Indian press, Kapadia&#x27;s business venture has inspired other candle enthusiasts to start similar businesses. Her candles were presented and offered for sale at a number of exhibitions.

==Career==
===Debut and stardom (1973)===
Kapadia, who was an avid movie viewer, aspired to be an actor since childhood. Her acting career was initiated by her father, who socialised with film-industry professionals and frequented parties hosted by screenwriter Anjana Rawail. Through his contacts, Dimple was almost cast to play the younger version of Vyjayanthimala&#x27;s character in H. S. Rawail&#x27;s &quot;Sunghursh&quot; (1968), but was eventually rejected because she looked older than the part called for. After she turned down an offer to play the protagonist in Hrishikesh Mukherjee&#x27;s &quot;Guddi&quot; in 1970, another opportunity arose in 1971 when Raj Kapoor was looking for a young, new female lead for his planned teen romance. Munni Dhawan, a close friend of Kapoor, suggested he consider Kapadia, having been acquainted with her father. In June that year, at the age of 14, Kapadia performed a screen test for the film on the sets of one of Kapoor&#x27;s productions. Impressed with her spontaneity and improvisation, Kapoor cast her in the part. The film, which was named &quot;Bobby&quot;, was released in September 1973. It starred Kapoor&#x27;s son Rishi Kapoor as Raj Nath, the son of a wealthy Hindu businessman, and Kapadia was given the title role of Bobby Braganza, the teenage daughter of a Christian fisherman from Goa. The story follows the love affair between Raj and Bobby in the face of his parents&#x27; disapproval of their relationship due to class prejudice.

&quot;Bobby&quot; was a major commercial success—India&#x27;s highest-grossing film of the year and ultimately second-earning film of the decade—and Kapadia was lauded for her performance, which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (tied with Jaya Bhaduri for ). Qurratulain Hyder of &quot;The Illustrated Weekly of India&quot; noted she acted with &quot;natural ease and freshness&quot;. Several of Kapadia&#x27;s lines in the film became popular, particularly, &quot;Mujhse dosti karoge?&quot; (&quot;Will you be my friend?&quot;), and the &quot;miniskirts, midriff-baring polka dot shirts, and fabled red bikini&quot; she wore made her a youth fashion icon in India. Consequently, polka-dotted dresses were often referred to as &quot;Bobby Print&quot;. Bhawana Somaaya of &quot;The Hindu&quot; credits Kapadia with starting the merchandising of film memorabilia in India, and Mukesh Khosla of &quot;The Tribune&quot; said &quot;Bobby&quot; established her as a &quot;cult figure&quot; because she led the fashion trends. In later years, Kapadia credited Raj Kapoor for her development as an actor: &quot;The sum total of me today as an actress, whatever I am, is Raj Kapoor&quot;. In 2008, Raja Sen from the web portal Rediff.com ranked her performance in &quot;Bobby&quot; as the fourth-best female debut of all time in Hindi cinema: &quot;An elfin little girl with big, lovely eyes, nobody quite portrayed innocence as memorably as Dimple in her first outing. She was candid, striking, and a true natural ... here was a girl who would redefine glamour and grace, and make it look very, very easy indeed.&quot;

===Comeback and early fluctuations (1984–1986)===

Kapadia returned to acting in 1984, two years after her separation from Khanna, saying she had a personal need to prove her own capabilities to herself. Over the next decade, she became one of the leading female actors in Hindi cinema. Her first post-hiatus film was &quot;Saagar&quot;; a mutual friend had notified the director Ramesh Sippy about Kapadia&#x27;s willingness to return to acting, and she was invited to audition for the part. She considered her screen test unsuccessful because she was &quot;literally shivering&quot; while performing it, but Sippy cast her to play the lead part opposite her &quot;Bobby&quot; co-star Rishi Kapoor. Scripted with her in mind, the film was intended to be her comeback vehicle but its one-year delay meant several of her later projects were released before, the first of which was &quot;Zakhmi Sher&quot; (1984).

Other films released before &quot;Saagar&quot; include &quot;Manzil Manzil&quot; (1984), &quot;Aitbaar&quot; (1985) and &quot;Arjun&quot; (1985). Kapadia appeared opposite Sunny Deol in &quot;Manzil Manzil&quot;, a drama that was directed by Nasir Hussain. While speaking of her positive experience during the making of the film, she felt uncomfortable performing the routine song-and-dance nature of the part. Her work was deemed ineffective by &quot;Trade Guide&quot;, and &quot;The Illustrated Weekly of India&quot; reported her career prospects entirely depended upon the fortunes of her next few projects. Kapadia received positive reviews for her part in Mukul Anand&#x27;s Hitchcockian thriller &quot;Aitbaar&quot;. She starred as Neha, a wealthy young woman whose greedy husband (Raj Babbar) plots to murder her. Discussing her performance, she said she was &quot;a bag of nerves&quot; while filming, which benefitted her performance because her own state coincided with her character&#x27;s inner turmoil. She was cast opposite Sunny Deol for a second time in Rahul Rawail&#x27;s action film &quot;Arjun&quot;; it was her first commercial success since her return to films.

&quot;Saagar&quot; premiered in August 1985 and was controversial for several scenes featuring Kapadia, including one in which she was seen topless for less than a second. The film was chosen as India&#x27;s official entry to the 58th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. Kapadia&#x27;s performance as Mona D&#x27;Silva, a young Catholic woman who is torn between her friend (Kamal Haasan) and the man she loves (Kapoor), reestablished her position in the film industry and won her a second Best Actress award at the Filmfare Awards. A reviewer in &quot;Asiaweek&quot; appreciated the film for its &quot;polished narration and masterly technique&quot; and labelled Kapadia &quot;a delight&quot;. According to Rediff.com, Kapadia &quot;performed solidly and memorably, grounding the two male leads and making the film work&quot;. A 1993 issue of &quot;India Today&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Saagar&quot; was in many ways a paean to her incredible beauty. She looked ravishing: auburn hair, classical face, deep eyes, an aura of sensuality. It was clear she was back.&quot;

Feroz Khan&#x27;s &quot;Janbaaz&quot; (1986), which is about a man fighting drug addiction, became known for a love scene in which Kapadia and male lead Anil Kapoor share a kiss, a rarity in Hindi cinema at the time. The same year, she acted opposite Kamal Haasan in her first regional film, &quot;Vikram&quot;, a Tamil-language sci-fi feature, in the minor role of Inimaasi, a young princess who falls in love with Vikram (Haasan). At that time, she worked in numerous Hindi films made by producers from South India, including &quot;Pataal Bhairavi&quot;, which she detested. She later confessed to accepting these roles for financial gain rather than artistic merit: &quot;I shudder even now when I think of those films. As an artiste I got totally corrupted.&quot;

===&quot;Kaash&quot; and mainstream success (1987–1989)===

Kapadia&#x27;s career took further shape in 1987 and, according to film journalist Firoze Rangoonwala, she was the most sought-after actress in the film industry that year. She appeared in Rajkumar Kohli&#x27;s &quot;Insaniyat Ke Dushman&quot; and Mukul Anand&#x27;s &quot;Insaaf&quot;; both action films that were popular with audiences. &quot;Insaniyat Ke Dushman&quot; featured Kapadia as part of an ensemble, and Rangoonwala attributed its commercial success to its all-star cast and &quot;bulky melodrama&quot;. In &quot;Insaaf&quot;, she played the dual role of unrelated lookalikes: Sonia, a club dancer and Dr. Sarita, a physician.

Later in the year, she played Pooja in Mahesh Bhatt&#x27;s marital drama &quot;Kaash&quot;. Kapadia and Jackie Shroff starred as an estranged couple who, during a relentless legal battle over the custody of their only son, learn that the boy has brain tumour and reunite to spend the last months of his life as a family. Before filming began, she called it the most serious artistic challenge of her career. Bhatt cast Kapadia because he was aware of her own marital experience and later revealed that during the shooting she had grown increasingly invested in the story, so much that after a point he could not differentiate her from Pooja as she &quot;became the character&quot;. Kapadia&#x27;s performance was praised by critics. Pritish Nandy, the editor of &quot;The Illustrated Weekly of India&quot;, asserted: &quot;Dimple achieves the impossible. Bereft of her glitzy make-up, glamour and filmi mannerisms, she comes alive as never before: beautiful, sensitive, intense. You almost feel you&#x27;ve discovered a new actress on the screen.&quot; In later years, &quot;The Times of India&quot; listed it as one of Kapadia&#x27;s best performances, noting her &quot;immense strength as a performer&quot;, and Sukanya Verma wrote of the &quot;stoic determination and touching vulnerability&quot; with which Pooja was played, calling the outcome &quot;extremely believable and sympathetic at once&quot;. Bhawana Somaaya reported that &quot;Kaash&quot; had established Kapadia as a performing artiste.

In &quot;Zakhmi Aurat&quot; (1988), Kapadia played Kiran Dutt, a police officer who is subjected to gang rape and, when the judicial system fails to convict the criminals, unites with other rape survivors to castrate the rapists in revenge. Among the first of a new trend of women-centred revenge films, the film was a financial success but polarised critics and attracted wide coverage for its lengthy, brutal rape scene involving Kapadia. Khalid Mohamed of &quot;The Times of India&quot; noted Kapadia&#x27;s &quot;power packed performance&quot; but criticised the rape sequence as &quot;utter lasciviousness&quot; and &quot;vulgarity spattering through the screen&quot;. Feminist magazine &quot;Manushi&quot; panned the film&#x27;s low cinematic quality, including the absurdity of the action scenes and the &quot;ugly kind of titillation&quot; in the rape scene, but said Kapadia brought &quot;a conviction to her role that is rare among Bombay heroines&quot; with a performance that is &quot;low key, moving and charming without being at all clinging or seductive&quot;. The same year, Kapadia worked with Rajkumar Kohli on the action drama &quot;Saazish&quot; and the horror film &quot;Bees Saal Baad&quot;, a remake of the 1962 film of the same name. She was the action star in &quot;Mera Shikar&quot;, a revenge saga directed by Keshu Ramsay, playing Bijli, a once joyous young woman who trains in martial arts to punish a notorious gangster for the crimes inflicted upon her sister. The film was described as an &quot;extraordinarily adroit entertainer&quot; by Subhash K. Jha, who preferred it over the &quot;sleazy sensationalism&quot; of &quot;Zakhmi Aurat&quot; and noted the &quot;unusual restraint&quot; with which Bijli&#x27;s transformation was achieved.

In 1989, Kapadia appeared as Jackie Shroff&#x27;s love interest in &quot;Ram Lakhan&quot;, a crime drama directed by Subhash Ghai. The film was a success with both critics and audiences, becoming the second-highest grossing Hindi film of the year and earning eight nominations at the 35th Filmfare Awards. She played a courtesan-turned-vengeful mistress in &quot;Pati Parmeshwar&quot;. The film was released after a well-publicised two-year court battle with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), which initially banned it from screening for its perceived glorification of submissiveness of women through the character of the forgiving wife who is in &quot;ignoble servility&quot; to her husband. Other films starring Kapadia that year include Babbar Subhash&#x27;s &quot;Pyar Ke Naam Qurbaan&quot; and J. P. Dutta&#x27;s action picture &quot;Batwara&quot;.

===Professional expansion and critical acclaim (1990–1994)===
In the 1990s, Kapadia started appearing in parallel cinema, a movement of Indian neo-realist art films, later citing an &quot;inner yearning to exhibit my best potential&quot;. Those films include &quot;Drishti&quot; (1990), &quot;Lekin...&quot; (1991), &quot;Rudaali&quot; (1993) and &quot;Antareen&quot; (1993). &quot;Drishti&quot;, a marital drama that was directed by Govind Nihalani and inspired by Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Scenes from a Marriage&quot; (1973), starred Kapadia and Shekhar Kapur as a married couple from Mumbai&#x27;s intellectual milieu, and followed their trials and tribulations, extramarital affairs, divorce, and eventual reconciliation. Kapadia received critical acclaim for playing the protagonist, career-woman Sandhya, and later recounted her full emotional involvement in the part. The author Subramani recognised Kapadia as &quot;an actress with hidden resources&quot; and appreciated her &quot;intelligent portrayal&quot;, through which Sandhya emerged as &quot;vulnerable and intense and full of feminine wiles&quot;. A review in &quot;The Indian Express&quot; noted Kapadia&#x27;s sensitive performance, presuming her own journey through separation might have enhanced her understanding of the part. The film was acknowledged as the Best Hindi Film of that year at the 38th National Film Awards, and &quot;Frontline&quot; magazine suggested that Kapadia should have earned the Best Actress award at the same function. She was named Best Actress (Hindi) of the year by the Bengal Film Journalists&#x27; Association, and won a jury award for Outstanding Performance at the 37th Filmfare Awards.

Gulzar&#x27;s romantic mystery &quot;Lekin...&quot;, which is based on Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s short story &quot;Hungry Stones&quot; (1895), features Kapadia as Reva, a restless spirit who haunts an ancient Rajasthani palace seeking liberation. The film traces Reva&#x27;s intermittent apparitions in front of Sameer (Vinod Khanna), a museum curator who arrives at the palace and—upon watching her visual recreation of events from her tragic story—resolves to set her free. Kapadia was determined to get the part as soon as she learned about the project and kept persistently calling Gulzar and the film&#x27;s producer Lata Mangeshkar until she was finally cast. To make her character more truthful, Gulzar forbade Kapadia to blink during filming, trying to capture an &quot;endless, fixed gaze&quot; that would give her &quot;a feeling of being surreal&quot;. Kapadia has often cited this role as a personal favourite and the pinnacle of her career, and wished it had been given more screen time in the film. &quot;Lekin...&quot; was popular with critics and Kapadia&#x27;s performance in it earned her a third Filmfare nomination. Subhash K. Jha described Reva as &quot;the essence of evanescence&quot; and took note of the &quot;intense tragedy&quot; with which Kapadia played the part.

Kapadia played a young widow in the military drama &quot;&quot; (1991), starring and directed by Nana Patekar, with whom she would collaborate on several future projects. Kapadia and co-star Madhuri Dixit agreed to act without wearing makeup upon Patekar&#x27;s insistence. The film impressed critics, who credited both actresses for their work, although most of the praise went to Patekar. Further critical attention came Kapadia&#x27;s way when she played a principled office receptionist opposite Sunny Deol in the action film &quot;Narsimha&quot;. In &quot;Haque&quot; (1991), a political drama directed by Harish Bhosle and scripted by Mahesh Bhatt, she played Varsha B. Singh, an Orthodox Hindu woman who, after years of subservience, acts in defiance of her oppressive husband. The author Ram Awatar Agnihotri noted Kapadia for a brave and convincing portrayal. Kapadia starred alongside Amitabh Bachchan in the fantasy &quot;Ajooba&quot;, a big-budgeted Indo-Russian co-production that was co-directed by Shashi Kapoor and Gennady Vasilyev. Based on Arabian mythology and set in the fictional Afghan kingdom Baharistan, the film saw her in the role of Rukhsana, a young woman who arrives from India to rescue her father from prison. The critical response to &quot;Ajooba&quot; was mediocre, and it failed to attract viewers in Indian cinemas against success in the Soviet Union.

The release of &quot;Maarg&quot;, her second project under Mahesh Bhatt&#x27;s direction, was delayed for several years before its straight-to-video release in late 1992. The film is about power politics within an ashram and features Kapadia as Uma, who works as a prostitute by choice. The critic Iqbal Masood considered it &quot;a powerful satire&quot; with &quot;excellent performances&quot;. According to Bhatt, Kapadia&#x27;s role was so intense it left her close to a breakdown after filming ended. She next played Barkha, a single woman who abandons her newly born, out-of-wedlock daughter, in Hema Malini&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Dil Aashna Hai&quot; (1992). In Shashilal K. Nair&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Angaar&quot; (1992), Kapadia played Mili, a homeless orphan who is collected by an unemployed man (Jackie Shroff). &quot;Angaar&quot;, and Kapadia&#x27;s performance in it, received positive reviews from critics but it was financially unsuccessful. Meena Iyer of &quot;The Times of India&quot;, who called it &quot;one of the most engaging mafia films to have come out of Bollywood&quot;, attributed the film&#x27;s limited audience to its subject matter.

In 1993, Kapadia won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Rudaali&quot;, a drama that was directed by Kalpana Lajmi and adapted from Mahasweta Devi&#x27;s short story of the same name. She played the central character Shanichari, a lonely, hardened Rajasthani village woman who, during a lifetime of misfortune, has never cried and is challenged with a new job as a professional mourner. The citation for the award described her performance as a &quot;compelling interpretation of the tribulations of a lonely woman ravaged by a cruel society&quot;. The Indologist Philip Lutgendorf argued that Kapadia&#x27;s &quot;dignity and conviction, as well as her effective body language and gestures, lift her character far beyond bathos&quot;. Among other accolades, she won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance and was acknowledged with Best Actress honours at the Asia-Pacific Film Festival and the International Film Festival in Damascus. Critics and moviegoers accepted &quot;Rudaali&quot; with enthusiasm, and it was India&#x27;s submission to the 66th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film. In 2010, &quot;Filmfare&quot; magazine included Kapadia&#x27;s work in the film in their list of &quot;80 Iconic Performances&quot;.

Another Filmfare nomination for Kapadia came that year for her supporting role as Shanti, a street prostitute whose husband and child were burnt alive, in the Priyadarshan-directed crime drama &quot;Gardish&quot;. An adaptation of the 1989 Malayalam film &quot;Kireedam&quot;, the film starred Jackie Shroff and Amrish Puri and was met with approval from critics and the public. &quot;The Indian Express&quot; praised the film&#x27;s &quot;script, vivid characters and powerful dialogues&quot;, and noted Kapadia&#x27;s ability to command audience attention. Mrinal Sen&#x27;s 1993 Bengali drama &quot;Antareen&quot;, which was adapted from Saadat Hasan Manto&#x27;s short story &quot;Badshahat ka Khatama&quot; (1950), was Kapadia&#x27;s first non-Hindi project since &quot;Vikram&quot; (1986). She played an unhappily married woman who develops a telephonic relationship with a stranger (Anjan Dutt). Kapadia insisted on playing the role spontaneously and thus refused to enrol in a crash course in Bengali, believing she would manage to speak it convincingly. Her voice was later dubbed by Anushua Chatterjee, a decision with which Kapadia was unhappy. &quot;Antareen&quot; was well-received and was named the Best Bengali Film at the 41st National Film Awards but Kapadia was dissatisfied with the outcome and dismissed it as a poor film.

In 1994, in Mehul Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Krantiveer&quot;, Kapadia portrayed the journalist Meghna Dixit, a rape victim who persuades an alcoholic, unemployed village man (Nana Patekar) to be a champion of justice for those around him. The film was a box-office success and became India&#x27;s third-highest-grossing picture of the year. &quot;The Indian Express&quot; complimented Kapadia for having developed into a leading character actor with this film. For her performance, Kapadia received her fourth Filmfare Award, this time in the Best Supporting Actress category. A controversy arose in December 1993 when Kapadia walked out of Raj Kanwar&#x27;s &quot;Kartavya&quot;, in which she played Divya Bharti&#x27;s mother in-law. Following Bharti&#x27;s death in April 1993, almost midway through the shooting, she was replaced by Juhi Chawla. Concerned that it would damage her career, Kapadia refused to play a mother in-law to Chawla, who is a decade her junior. The Film Makers&#x27; Combine circulated a ban against Kapadia from signing any new projects; the ban was withdrawn in May 1994 when the Cine Artistes&#x27; Association intervened in support of Kapadia.

===Hiatus, setback and resurgence (1995–2008)===

After &quot;Antareen&quot;, Kapadia was expected to work in more independent films but she took a three-year hiatus from acting, later saying she was &quot;emotionally exhausted&quot;. She returned to commercial cinema in 1997, playing Amitabh Bachchan&#x27;s wife in &quot;Mrityudaata&quot; under Mehul Kumar&#x27;s direction. The film was a critical and commercial failure; &quot;India Today&quot; panned its &quot;comic book-level storytelling&quot;. The trade journal &quot;Film Information&quot; said Kapadia had a role unworthy of her time, and Kapadia shared similar sentiments. She next acted opposite Jackie Shroff in the murder mystery &quot;2001: Do Hazaar Ek&quot; (1998) and the romantic drama &quot;Laawaris&quot; (1999), which were rejected by audiences. &quot;Laawaris&quot; was criticised for its formulaic script and lack of originality and, according to &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, did not allow Kapadia &quot;much to do except scream&quot;. In her final feature of the decade, &quot;Hum Tum Pe Marte Hain&quot; (1999), Kapadia played Devyani Chopra, the strict matriarch of a wealthy family. Subhash K. Jha called the film an embarrassment while Suparn Verma gave a scathing review of Kapadia&#x27;s performance, noting she &quot;wears a permanent scowl&quot; throughout the film.

In her first film of the new millennium, Kapadia co-starred in Farhan Akhtar&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; (2001), which depicts the contemporary, routine life of Indian affluent youth, and focuses on a period of transition in the lives of three friends (Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna). Kapadia played the role of Tara Jaiswal, a middle-aged alcoholic woman, an interior designer by profession, and a divorcee who is not allowed to meet her daughter. The film presents her story through the character of Siddharth (Khanna), a much-younger man whom she befriends and who falls deeply in love with her. Akhtar wrote the part specifically for Kapadia, who later called it &quot;a role to die for&quot;. Critics lauded &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; as a groundbreaking film for its realistic portrayal of India&#x27;s modern society, and it won the Best Hindi Film award at the 49th National Film Awards. Commercially, it performed well in large cities but failed in the rural areas, which trade analysts attributed to the urban lifestyle depicted in it. Saibal Chatterjee, in a review for &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, noted, &quot;Dimple Kapadia, in a brief, somewhat underdeveloped role, presents a poignant study of loneliness&quot;.

In 2002, Kapadia portrayed the title role in the drama &quot;Leela&quot;, an American production that was directed by Somnath Sen and co-stars Deepti Naval, Vinod Khanna and Amol Mhatre. Kapadia&#x27;s part, which was written specially for her, is that of a forty-year-old, married Mumbai University professor who, after the death of her mother, loses her sense of happiness and takes a job as a visiting professor of South Asian studies in California. The story follows Leela&#x27;s acclimation to her new surroundings and her relationship with a young Indian-American man named Kris (Mhatre), one of her students. Kapadia was nervous during the making of the film but believed the tension helped elevate her acting. The film was reviewed favourably by American critics, among whom Maitland McDonagh from &quot;TV Guide&quot; wrote: &quot;Dimple Kapadia shines in this family melodrama ... [her] intelligent, nuanced performance is the film&#x27;s highlight&quot;. Reviews in India were similarly approving of &quot;Leela&quot; and Kapadia&#x27;s work.

Kapadia played the lead role of army wife Sandra Williams, whose palatial household becomes plagued by eerie occurrences, in &quot;Hum Kaun Hai?&quot; (2004), a supernatural thriller. The film opened to a mixed critical reception, but critics agreed Kapadia&#x27;s performance and charismatic presence enhance an otherwise weak script. A year later, Kapadia and Rishi Kapoor reunited as a lead couple for the third time after &quot;Bobby&quot; and &quot;Saagar&quot; in &quot;Pyaar Mein Twist&quot;, starring as middle-aged single parents who fall in love and are subsequently confronted with the reaction of their children. The film generated mostly negative reviews but critics concurred the chemistry between the lead pair was enough of a reason to watch it, acknowledging the nostalgic value of the pairing. Few people went to see the film; within two weeks it was declared a failure. In 2016, scholar Afreen Khan cited Kapadia&#x27;s character as a departure from the conventional portrayal of mothers in Hindi films, believing her role to be a modern mother whom daughters dream of having.

In 2006, Kapadia co-starred with Saif Ali Khan and Naseeruddin Shah in the black comedy &quot;Being Cyrus&quot;, an English-language independent feature and the directorial debut of Homi Adajania, who would often cast her in his future endeavours. Kapadia played Katy Sethna, Shah&#x27;s neurotic and unfaithful wife who has an affair with Cyrus (Khan), a young drifter who enters their house as an assistant. The film was well received at a number of film festivals before its theatrical release in India, upon which it was embraced by critics and audiences, making a considerable profit against its small budget. The BBC&#x27;s Poonam Joshi stated, &quot;the descent into despair of Dimple Kapadia&#x27;s Katy is enthralling&quot; but other critics, including Derek Elley from &quot;Variety&quot; and Shradha Sukumaran from &quot;Mid-Day&quot;, criticised her for excessively overacting. In the mystical love story &quot;Banaras&quot; (2006), Kapadia played a wealthy Brahmin woman whose daughter falls in love with a man of a lower caste.

V. K. Prakash&#x27;s romance &quot;Phir Kabhi&quot; (2008) stars Kapadia and Mithun Chakraborty as ageing people who meet at a school reunion and rekindle their high-school romance. The film was awarded seven prizes, including the Best Film Award in the Narrative Feature section, at the Los Angeles Reel Film Festival. It was released direct-to-video a year later and was simultaneously distributed via pay-per-view direct-to-home (DTH) services, becoming the first Hindi film to premier on streaming media platforms. At the request of her son-in-law Akshay Kumar, Kapadia voiced the character Devi, the mother of the elephant Jumbo (Kumar), in the animated feature &quot;Jumbo&quot; (2008), a remake of the 2006 Thai computer animation &quot;Khan Kluay&quot;.

===Recognition for character roles (2009–2014)===

Kapadia was cast in Zoya Akhtar&#x27;s first directorial venture &quot;Luck by Chance&quot; (2009), a satirical take on the Hindi film industry. She played Neena Walia, an erstwhile superstar—referred to in the film as &quot;a crocodile in a chiffon saree&quot;—who struggles to launch her young daughter into the movie business. Kapadia was approached for the part because it required an actress who had been a mainstream star in the past. Akhtar noted Kapadia&#x27;s edgy portrayal of the character&#x27;s fickle nature, saying Kapadia is &quot;all warm, soft sunshine and then there&#x27;s a flip and she&#x27;s hard, cold, steely&quot;. &quot;Luck By Chance&quot; opened to a warm critical response, though its financial income was modest. Critics were appreciative of Kapadia&#x27;s performance, which earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare. Deepa Karmalkar from &quot;Screen&quot; characterised her role as &quot;gloriously bitchy&quot; while Avijit Ghosh of &quot;The Times of India&quot; believed Kapadia had delivered &quot;one of her most nuanced performances&quot; in a character he found to be &quot;a rare kind of Hindi film mother&quot; who is &quot;hawk-eyed, tough as nails but vainglorious, and in a strange way, vulnerable as well&quot;.

In 2010, Kapadia played the small part of Salman Khan&#x27;s asthmatic mother in action comedy &quot;Dabangg&quot;, which was the most popular film of the year in India and the second-highest grossing Hindi film of all-time up to that point. Reviews for Kapadia&#x27;s role were varied; Blessy Chettiar of &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot; likened her character to &quot;the mothers in Hindi cinema of yore, self-sacrificing, torn between relationships, slightly over-the-top, likeable nevertheless&quot;. Next followed &quot;Tum Milo Toh Sahi&quot; (2010), a romantic comedy which stars Kapadia as Delshad Nanji, a Parsi woman in charge of an Irani café whose business is under threat from developers and who falls in love with the lawyer (Nana Patekar) who represents her in court. Kapadia adopted a Parsi accent for the role and while preparing for it, visited several Irani cafés in Mumbai to adapt to the character&#x27;s cultural milieu. The film opened to average reviews but Kapadia&#x27;s performance received generally positive feedback. According to Anupama Chopra, the character of Delshad &quot;veers into caricature&quot; but Kapadia &quot;plays her with affection and energy and at least has some fun doing it&quot;. In her only film of 2011, Kapadia was cast as Rishi Kapoor&#x27;s wife and her son in-law Akshay Kumar&#x27;s mother in Nikhil Advani&#x27;s &quot;Patiala House&quot;, a sports film revolving around cricket. 

Kapadia collaborated again with Homi Adajania in &quot;Cocktail&quot; (2012) and &quot;Finding Fanny&quot; (2014), both critical and commercial successes. &quot;Cocktail&quot;, a romantic comedy, saw her play Saif Ali Khan&#x27;s loud Punjabi mother, Kavita Kapoor, an appearance to which Aniruddha Guha of &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot; referred as a &quot;veritable treat&quot;. While filming &quot;Cocktail&quot;, Adajania shared the script of the satirical road movie &quot;Finding Fanny&quot; with Kapadia. Believing he is a director capable of bringing the best in her, she expressed keen interest in the project. She was cast as Rosalina &quot;Rosie&quot; Eucharistica, a conceited-but-well-meaning woman who joins her late son&#x27;s widow (Deepika Padukone) on a road trip across Goa. Kapadia was required to wear a heavy prosthetic posterior for the role, and her portrayal earned her a fourth Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare. Rachel Saltz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote Kapadia &quot;inhabits and enhances her role&quot; and &quot;steers clear of caricature and even milks some humor out of the unfunny script&quot;.

In 2013, Kapadia was the protagonist in the comedy &quot;What the Fish&quot;, portraying Sudha Mishra, an irate Delhi-based divorcee who begrudgingly entrusts her niece with taking care of her house while she is away. Kapadia was enthusiastic about the part, feeling challenged to play its different traits. Reviews of both the film and Kapadia&#x27;s work were mixed. &quot;The Times of India&quot; panned the film&#x27;s script for making &quot;Kapadia&#x27;s tryst with comedy seem loud and forced&quot;, and Raja Sen deemed her part the most forgettable of her career. Sarita A. Tanwar of &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot; considered the film &quot;a rather audacious entertaining attempt&quot; and said Kapadia was &quot;in top form&quot;, and similarly positive comments were written by Subhash K. Jha.

===Limited work, &quot;Tenet&quot; and beyond (2015–present)===

For the rest of the decade, Kapadia returned to film twice for minor roles in the action comedies &quot;Welcome Back&quot; (2015) and &quot;Dabangg 3&quot; (2019). She played a conwoman in Anees Bazmee&#x27;s &quot;Welcome Back&quot; along with an ensemble cast led by Anil Kapoor and Nana Patekar. &quot;Dabangg 3&quot;, the third instalment of the &quot;Dabangg&quot; film series, saw her briefly reprise the role of Naina Devi. In her first film of the 2020s, Kapadia appeared alongside Irrfan Khan and Kareena Kapoor in the comedy-drama &quot;Angrezi Medium&quot; (2020), her fourth project under Homi Adajania&#x27;s direction. A spiritual sequel to the 2017 film &quot;Hindi Medium&quot;, it was theatrically released in India on 13 March amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected its commercial performance due to the closing of cinemas. Initial plans for a re-release were cancelled and the film was made available digitally less than a month later. Kapadia played a strict store owner estranged from her daughter (Kapoor), a role Vinayak Chakravorty of &quot;Outlook&quot; thought was &quot;used to highlight loneliness among the aged&quot; but believed could have been stronger.

Kapadia next played arms dealer Priya Singh in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s spy thriller &quot;Tenet&quot;. Her screen test for the role was shot in 2019 by Adajania before filming for &quot;Angrezi Medium&quot; began, followed by an audition for Nolan in Mumbai. Impressed with her charisma and poise, Nolan cast Kapadia in the part, believing she thoroughly embodied his vision of the character. The film opened amid the pandemic to a worldwide audience and, having grossed $364million worldwide, became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2020. Critics reacted positively to her performance; Richard Roeper of &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote Kapadia &quot;quietly steals every scene she&#x27;s in&quot; and Guy Lodge of &quot;Variety&quot; said she had given the film&#x27;s &quot;wiliest performance&quot;. Having admitted to being a reluctant actor for years, Kapadia credited &quot;Tenet&quot; with restoring her passion for film acting.

Ali Abbas Zafar&#x27;s 2021 Amazon Prime political streaming series &quot;Tandav&quot; starred Kapadia in her first appearance on a digital platform as Anuradha Kishore, a power-hungry politician who seeks to undermine the new political rival (Saif Ali Khan) of the Prime Minister of India, her longtime ally. The show opened amid massive protests and police complaints against its makers for allegedly insulting Hindu deities and hurting the religious sentiments of Hindus, following which Zafar cut several scenes and issued a formal apology. Reviewers responded variably to &quot;Tandav&quot;, but Kapadia&#x27;s efforts were better received. &quot;A Thursday&quot; (2022), Behzad Khambata&#x27;s vigilante-hostage thriller starring Yami Gautam, featured Kapadia in the fictional part of Prime Minister of India Maya Rajguru.

Kapadia had a cameo in Ayan Mukerji&#x27;s action fantasy &quot;Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva&quot; (2022) and starred in Siddharth Anand&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Pathaan&quot; (2023), led by Shah Rukh Khan. In &quot;Pathaan&quot;, based in the YRF Spy Universe, she played Nandini, a senior officer in charge of a unit of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) agents. Her performance was particularly picked up for praise. Sneha Bengani of CNBC TV18 was appreciative of her &quot;sharp and graceful, commanding, yet restrained&quot; performance. The film broke several box-office records to become the second-highest-grossing Indian film of 2023 and the third-highest-grossing Hindi film of all time. Kapadia won a Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role – Female for her performance.

A supporting role as the mother of Ranbir Kapoor&#x27;s character in Luv Ranjan&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar&quot; (2023) brought Kapadia positive notice. Despite mixed reviews, the film enjoyed a strong run at the box office. Kapadia next reunited with Adajania for the Disney+ Hotstar crime thriller series &quot;Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo&quot;, in which she played the protagonist Savitri, the powerful matriarch of a drug cartel selling a cocaine variant called flamingo. For the part, Kapadia was required to learn the local dialect to the fictional town of Runjh, located in northwest India. The show was well received and Kapadia earned rave reviews for her central performance. Shubhra Gupta, writing for &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, said Kapadia is &quot;effortlessly in command of the room, and the situation&quot;. For her work, Kapadia received a Filmfare OTT Award for Best Actress in a Drama Series.

Kapadia played a scientist in the romantic comedy &quot;Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya&quot; (2024), starring Shahid Kapoor and Kriti Sanon, and featured alongside an ensemble cast in Adajania&#x27;s mystery film &quot;Murder Mubarak&quot;. She will next have a starring role opposite the former&#x27;s father, Pankaj Kapur, in Saurabh Shukla&#x27;s &quot;Jab Khuli Kitaab&quot;, a romantic comedy about an older couple who seek divorce after 50 years of marriage.

==Public image and artistry==
When Kapadia returned to films after her separation from Khanna, she faced constant comparison to her &quot;Bobby&quot; days and struggled to be taken seriously as an actor. According to Jyotika Virdi, the author of the book &quot;The Cinematic Imagination&quot;, while Kapadia&#x27;s trajectory is different from those of other female Hindi film stars, she turned her disadvantages to her advantage. Virdi said Kapadia&#x27;s forthright manner made a major contribution to her career: &quot;Speaking candidly to the press, she and the reporters plotted her life&#x27;s narrative from the innocent teenager snared into an impossible marriage to the emergence of a mature &#x27;woman with experience&#x27;.&quot; Kapadia is known for her assertive and moody nature; during the making of &quot;Janbaaz&quot; (1986), the director Feroz Khan said he had never met a woman with her levels of &quot;pent-up aggression&quot;. On the other hand, Mahesh Bhatt, the director of &quot;Kaash&quot; (1987), said generosity is her defining trait. The journalist Bhawana Somaaya, who conducted a series of interviews with Kapadia during the 1980s, stated: &quot;She&#x27;s a strange bundle of contradictions. Her moods change in a jiffy.&quot; According to some critics, this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities as &quot;her unpredictable nature and moods have distanced many well wishers&quot;. In reply to this, she said: &quot;I am moody by nature. But I have never consciously hurt anyone.&quot;

Virdi wrote Kapadia fought her way to success by committing to serious and challenging work and described her parts in &quot;Aitbaar&quot; (1985), &quot;Kaash&quot; (1987) and &quot;Drishti&quot; (1990) as characters with which she &quot;drew from the well of her own experience&quot;. With &quot;Zakhmi Aurat&quot; (1988), Kapadia became one of the mainstream actresses associated with a new wave of women-centred revenge films. As an action heroine, she chose to perform her own stunts, which the critic M. Rahman thought made her performance more convincing. Although she enjoyed working in similar projects, such as &quot;Mera Shikar&quot; (1988) and &quot;Kali Ganga&quot; (1990), she bemoaned about being paid less than male action stars. The author Dinesh Raheja believed Kapadia&#x27;s involvement in art films in the 1990s happened at a time when she was no longer willing to play the &quot;pretty prop in hero-oriented films&quot;, arguing her new choices &quot;honed Dimple&#x27;s talent for lending fine striations to complex emotions&quot;. Mahesh Bhatt commended her for not turning into &quot;a victim of her own success&quot; by refusing to appear in films of strictly commercial value. According to Govind Nihalani, the director of &quot;Drishti&quot; (1990), Kapadia has a genuine interest in serious work that would challenge her talent and realise her potential. Similar sentiments were shared by Shashi Kapoor, who said Kapadia had always been eager to act in quality films. Kapadia said her involvement in independent films was a conscious decision to experiment in different cinema and prove her abilities.

When questioned about her hiatus after &quot;Rudaali&quot; at her career peak, Kapadia said she needed space and that generally her &quot;career has always been secondary&quot; to her. Her infrequent work since then, which manifested in numerous gaps between her screen appearances, has gained her a reputation for being selective about her work. Admitting her limited professional drive, she attributed it to the lack of worthy offers and the &quot;huge effort&quot; expended in film acting, which consumes time otherwise spent on her family and private life. Even so, Kapadia&#x27;s later work was noted by film scholars, including Shoma Chatterji and Afreen Khan, who listed her among the female actors who represent a changing portrayal of mothers in Hindi films, with roles of women who consider their happiness to be of equal importance to that of their children. Similar thoughts were expressed by &quot;Mumbai Mirror&quot;″s Trisha Gupta, who was impressed with Kapadia&#x27;s diverse repertoire of maternal roles, ranging from &quot;Luck by Chance&quot; (2009) and &quot;Dabangg&quot; (2010) to &quot;Finding Fanny&quot; (2014). Guided by her own judgement, Kapadia normally commits to a project without seeking advice and often willingly works with young or first-time directors, finding their enthusiasm and creativity beneficial to both the film and her performance.

Kapadia&#x27;s screen image has been characterised in terms of her perceived beauty and sex appeal. &quot;The Times of India&quot; wrote in reference to her role in &quot;Saagar&quot;, &quot;Dimple was a vision of lush beauty; quite the forbidden fruit, rising from the ocean like Aphrodite emerging from the waves and surf&quot;. Speaking of her post-comeback screen persona, the critic Khalid Mohamed observed, &quot;Her arsenal comprised, among other elements, expressive cognac eyes, a nuanced, resonating voice skilled in Hindustani dialogue delivery, easy body language, and that seductive toss of her auburn hair.&quot; Mrinal Sen, who directed her in &quot;Antareen&quot; (1993), compared Kapadia to Sophia Loren and described her face as &quot;a landscape of desolation&quot;. Anil Kapoor, her co-star of &quot;Janbaaz&quot;, hailed Kapadia as the most beautiful Indian actress since Madhubala. According to Dinesh Raheja, Kapadia&#x27;s casting in &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot; (2001) and &quot;Leela&quot; (2002), in which she played middle-aged women who are the object of younger men&#x27;s desire, served as &quot;a kind of tribute to her eternal beauty&quot;. Emma Thomas, the producer of &quot;Tenet&quot; (2020), distinguished Kapadia as having &quot;incredible magnetism, charisma, and glamour&quot;, which made her the right choice for the film.

Critics have been appreciative of Kapadia&#x27;s acting prowess and some have analysed it in relation to her appearance. Ranjan Das Gupta called her &quot;an instinctive actress, spontaneous and intelligent&quot; who is best at playing &quot;intense characters&quot;, and said her beauty is &quot;her asset as well as limitation&quot;. In 1988, Subhash K. Jha wrote that &quot;besides her elastic and primeval looks&quot;, Kapadia &quot;possesses an inbuilt instinct for grasping characters at a level way beyond the surface&quot;. While working with her on &quot;Kaash&quot;, Mahesh Bhatt said Kapadia had been through so much in her private life she need not study method acting to play real women. Academic writers Madhu Kishwar and Ruth Vanita of the feminist magazine &quot;Manushi&quot; noted Kapadia for being unafraid to look less attractive for the benefit of convincingly expressing anguish and emotion. M.L. Dhawan from &quot;The Tribune&quot; commented, &quot;All those who have been following Dimple Kapadia&#x27;s career from &quot;Bobby&quot;, &quot;Lekin&quot; and &quot;Rudaali&quot; will assert that she is more talented than glamorous&quot;. Kapadia has described herself as a &quot;spontaneous actor who is guided by instinct&quot; and on another occasion, &quot;a competent actress yet to deliver her best&quot;.

<text>Wesley Ruggles (June 11, 1889 – January 8, 1972) was an American film director.

== Life and work ==
He was born in Los Angeles, California, younger brother of actor Charlie Ruggles. He began his career in 1915 as an actor, appearing in a dozen or so silent films, on occasion with Charlie Chaplin.

In 1917, he turned his attention to directing, making more than 50 films—including a silent version of Edith Wharton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1924)—before he won acclaim with &quot;Cimarron&quot; in 1931. The adaptation of Edna Ferber&#x27;s novel &quot;Cimarron&quot;, about homesteaders settling in the prairies of Oklahoma, was the first Western to win an Oscar as Best Picture.

Ruggles followed this success with the light comedy &quot;No Man of Her Own&quot; (1932) with Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, the comedy &quot;I&#x27;m No Angel&quot; (1933) with Mae West and Cary Grant, &quot;College Humor&quot; (1933) with Bing Crosby, and &quot;Bolero&quot; (1934) with George Raft and Carole Lombard.

He teamed with the Rank Organisation in 1946 to produce and direct &quot;London Town&quot; with Sid Field and Petula Clark, based on a story he wrote. The film—British cinema&#x27;s first attempt at a Technicolor musical—is notable as being one of the biggest critical and commercial failures in this country&#x27;s film history. Ironically, Ruggles had been hired to direct it because as an American, it was thought, he was better equipped to handle a musical—despite the fact that nothing in his past had prepared him to work in the genre. It was his last film. An abridged version was released in the U.S. under the title &quot;My Heart Goes Crazy&quot; by United Artists in 1953.

Ruggles died January 8, 1972, in Santa Monica, California, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California, near his brother Charles Ruggles. For his contributions to the motion picture industry, he has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6400 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Kintra (), literally &quot;country&quot; in Scots is a settlement on the North-Western coast of the Ross of Mull, Scotland. The settlement is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon. It has approximately 15 permanent residents, in addition to seasonal or recreational visitors. Most of the settlement is in the form of a line of houses parallel to the shore (a small, unpaved road, low defense wall and grassy area separate the beach from the houses).

The size of the beach is very much dependent on the tide: at high tide, there may be no beach and much of the grassy area is submerged. At low tide, there may be up to 50 m of beach. The bay in which Kintra resides is sheltered by numerous, small islands and outcrops composed of local granite stones. Kintra lies about 2 miles north east of Fionnphort (near Iona).

<doc id="1308994" wikidata="Q1988859" url="?curid=1308994" title="Battle of Guillemont">
<text>The Battle of Guillemont (3–6 September 1916) was an attack, during the Battle of the Somme in the First World War, by the British Fourth Army against the German 2nd Army near the village of Guillemont in northern France. The village is on the D 20 running east to Combles and the D 64 south-west to Montauban. Longueval and Delville Wood lie to the north-west and Ginchy to the north-east. The village was on the right flank of the British sector, near the boundary with the French Sixth Army. The Fourth Army had advanced close to Guillemont during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge and the capture of the village was the culmination of British attacks which began on the night of The attacks were intended to advance the right flank of the Fourth Army and eliminate a salient further north at Delville Wood. German defences ringed the wood and had observation over the French Sixth Army area to the south, towards the Somme river.

Preparatory to a general attack intended for mid-September, from the Somme north to Courcelette (beyond the Albert–Bapaume road), the French Sixth Army, the Fourth Army and the Reserve Army conducted numerous attacks to capture the rest of the German second line and to gain observation over the German third line. The German defences around Guillemont were based on the remaining parts of the second line and fortified villages and farms northwards from Hem, Maurepas and Combles, to Falfemont Farm, Guillemont, Ginchy, Delville Wood and High Wood, which commanded the ground in between. The Battles Nomenclature Committee report of May 1921, called British military operations on the Somme during the fighting for Guillemont, the Battle of Delville Wood (14 July – 3 September) by the Fourth Army and the Battle of Pozières (23 July – 3 September) by the Reserve Army and III Corps of the Fourth Army.

Attempts were made by Joseph Joffre, the French supreme commander, Sir Douglas Haig, Ferdinand Foch and the army commanders Henry Rawlinson and Émile Fayolle to co-ordinate attacks, which failed due to the recovery of the German 2nd Army from the disorganisation caused by the defeats in early July, disagreements over tactics by Haig and Joffre in July and August and organisational constraints caused by congestion behind the front, roads and tracks obliterated by Anglo-French artillery-fire becoming swamps when it rained. Increasing German artillery-fire on targets behind the front line, inexperience, unreliable machinery, guns, ammunition and an unpredictable flow of supplies from Britain, reduced the effectiveness of the British armies. Difficulty in co-ordinating attacks by the Entente armies and the large number of piecemeal attacks resorted to by the British, have been criticised as costly failures and evidence of muddle and incompetence by the generals. The French Sixth and Tenth armies had similar difficulties and severe strain had been put on the German 2nd Army and the 1st Army (formed on 19 July), forcing them into a similar piecemeal defence.

The official historian, Wilfrid Miles, wrote in the History of the Great War volume (1938), that the defence of Guillemont was judged by some observers to be the best performance of the war by the German Army on the Western Front. A pause at the end of August in Anglo-French attacks to organise bigger combined attacks and postponements for bad weather, coincided with the largest German counter-attack yet. Joffre, Foch and Haig abandoned attempts to organise large combined attacks, in favour of sequenced army attacks. The capture of the German defences from Cléry north of the Somme to Guillemont from 3 to 6 September brought the Sixth and Fourth armies onto ground which overlooked the German third position. Rain, congestion and relief of tired divisions forced a pause in French attacks until 12 September. At the Battle of Ginchy (9 September) the Fourth Army captured the village, ready to begin the Battle of Flers–Courcelette, (15–22 September).
==Background==

===Strategic developments===

On 1 July, the Anglo-French offensive had captured the first German defensive line from Foucaucourt south of the Somme to the vicinity of the Albert–Bapaume road, north of the river. The German 2nd Army abandoned the second line on the south bank in the XVII Corps area, to occupy the shorter third position behind it close to Péronne, despite the policy of an unyielding defence. The Chief of Staff, , was sacked by Falkenhayn that night and replaced by Colonel Fritz von Loßberg. Next day Below issued a secret order that ground must be held at all costs, defensive positions were to be recovered by counter-attacks and that all commanders must make it clear that &quot;The enemy must be made to pick his way forward over corpses&quot;. Over the next ten days, fifteen fresh divisions were sent to the Somme front, being split up as they arrived and used piecemeal to fill gaps at the most vulnerable points, which led to many casualties in the reinforcing units. The 2nd Army suffered in the first ten days, compared to in the first ten days at Verdun.

On 17 July, Falkenhayn reorganised the twenty German divisions engaged on the Somme, by re-establishing the 1st Army under the command of Below, north of the Somme and appointing Lieutenant-General Max von Gallwitz to the command of the 2nd Army south of the river, combining both armies in . On 17 July, Below issued another secret order, noting that unauthorised withdrawals were still being made and threatened to Court-martial commanders who did not fight to the last man. By the end of July, despite the discipline and sacrifice of the German troops, more ground had been lost and Gallwitz issued an order on 30 July, stating that the decisive battle of the war was being fought on the Somme and that no more ground should be given up, regardless of losses. In August, the Germans retained far more ground than in July, at a cost of .

On 6 July, Joffre had visited Fayolle and discussed bringing the cavalry close to the front to exploit success and on 8 July, Foch, commander of (GAN, Northern Army Group), ordered Fayolle to reinforce the success of the corps south of the Somme for an attack on 20 July, while defending north of the river. After the British victory of the Battle of Bazentin Ridge (14 to 22 July), Joffre directed Foch to co-ordinate broad-front attacks with the British, who were making the main effort, to force the Germans to spread their artillery-fire and infantry over a wider front. Foch ordered the attack to be extended north of the river, although the transfer of artillery had put the main weight of the attack on the south side. In mid-July, the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) General Headquarters (GHQ) received intelligence reports of &quot;demoralisation and confusion&quot; among the German defenders but recovery was noted within three days, particularly due to improvements in the flow of supplies to the German front line.

By the end of July, there was no expectation of a rapid German collapse, as the defenders north of the Somme had been relieved by three times as many fresh divisions and the Fourth Army was ordered to prepare for a German counter-attack. Intelligence reports showed very high German casualties and that one of the fresh German divisions had previously lost of its infantry strength at Verdun. A copy of the order issued by Below for unyielding defence was captured in late July, which indicated that German tactics were making attrition a feasible Entente objective. The destruction of British intelligence networks in occupied northern France and Belgium restricted GHQ Intelligence to gleaning documents from the battlefield and prisoner interrogation, causing the number of German divisions available for the Somme front to be underestimated. On 2 August, Haig issued a directive stating that Falkenhayn could continue to replace troops on the Somme and a German collapse was not expected, forecasting a &quot;wearing-out&quot; battle until September. Anglo-French intelligence estimates of German casualties ranged from in July.

After another general relief of German divisions in mid-August, reports of &quot;despondency&quot; among prisoners, an estimate that the British had engaged German divisions which had fought on the Somme, which were exhausted after days, yet kept in the line for twenty; news of German peace feelers and mounting domestic unrest raised Allied optimism again. At the end of August, the Rumanian declaration of war and the sacking of Falkenhayn led to hopes that his replacement by (Field Marshal) Paul von Hindenburg as Chief of the General Staff and General Erich Ludendorff as (First Quartermaster General) would lead to more emphasis on the eastern front, easing the task of the Entente armies in France and Belgium. The advances in early September and the publication of German casualty lists for July (which showed that seven of the twelve German divisions on the Somme opposite the British had lost more than of their infantry) encouraged Haig and Joffre to persist with the offensive. Bavarian units in the area around Guillemont were believed to have maintained high morale but suffered many casualties and had few reserves available.

===Tactical developments===

A vast increase in British war production had been achieved in 1916 but the flow of equipment and ammunition caused transport problems in France, particularly on the (Nord) railways, which had become overloaded by the increase in the size of the BEF, the large number ammunition trains from the Channel ports to the Somme front and the need to move unprecedented numbers of casualties after 1 July. Congestion of the railways began to affect operations in July and rainy periods made delivery of ammunition from railheads to gun positions much harder, when were being delivered even on &quot;quiet&quot; days. Shortages of heavy howitzer ammunition in mid-July were made worse in areas under German observation and harassing-fire, as more German artillery arrived on the Somme front.

After 1 July, work began on extensions of the railway mainline behind the Somme front towards Maricourt and the metre-gauge line from Albert to Bray was extended to Fricourt and Montauban by 14 July. Anglo-French conferences on railway policy on settled administrative questions on railway building, line extensions and the building of all-weather connecting roads. Operation of the extensions proved difficult, due to the number of soldiers, lorries, wagons and guns criss-crossing the rear of the battlefront and road closures due to accidents and German bombardments, which made the delivery of supplies unpredictable.

From the XIII Corps artillery received to replace were out of action due to defects and lack of spare parts; the supply of ammunition was adequate but much of it was of poor quality, fuzes from heavy howitzer shells falling out in flight. On 31 July, Rawlinson concentrated the artillery of XIII Corps on the right flank against Guillemont and then a line from Leuze Wood to Ginchy, with assistance from the XV Corps artillery. On 3 August, the British Armies received a directive from Haig, which laid down the methods to be adopted to capture all of the Morval–Thiepval ridge, as it was clear that the German defence had become more formidable.

Methodical preparation of small attacks, with immediate consolidation was required and great economy of men and equipment was necessary, to conduct another general attack in mid-September. The French XX Corps was to be assisted by the capture of Falfemont Farm, Leuze Wood, Guillemont and Ginchy. Rawlinson altered the XIII Corps boundary, to concentrate it against Guillemont; the 55th (West Lancashire) Division and the 2nd Division sapped forward to reduce the width of no man&#x27;s land, which brought the British front line to Arrow Head Copse and about half-way from Trônes Wood to Guillemont.

The two German armies on the Somme made corps headquarters permanent geographical entities, with divisions temporarily attached, before relief by fresh formations. On the south bank, was formed from the XVII Reserve Corps. Eventually the area north of the Somme to the Ancre was held by (VI Reserve Corps) from the Somme to Hardecourt, (IV Corps) from Hardecourt to Pozières on the Albert–Bapaume road and (XIV Reserve Corps) from Pozières, across the Ancre to Gommecourt. On 2 July, Loßberg surveyed the battlefield near Péronne, then began to arrange defensive positions like those used in the Second Battle of Champagne in September 1915. Front-line positions were to be thinly held, maintained regardless of loss and recaptured by (immediate counter-attacks). If a failed, (organised counter-attacks) were to be made.

Loßberg ordered a new telephone line to be built, parallel to the front line, out of artillery range, with branches to forward headquarters, ordered artillery headquarters to move close to infantry division headquarters to improve liaison and moved artillery observation posts back from the front line to positions which overlooked it. Lack of reserves was the chief difficulty of the defence and Loßberg urged Falkenhayn to end the Battle of Verdun to supply reinforcements; for as long as German attacks continued at Verdun, troops, supplies and equipment arrived on the Somme intermittently, forcing piecemeal reinforcement of weak spots by battalions and companies, rather than complete units from a settled echelon of reserves, which caused irreplaceable losses in divisions kept in the line for too long.

German infantry began to avoid trench lines in mid-July and occupied shell-holes, which made Allied bombardments less effective and diverted infantry into mopping-up operations. Allied attacks on limited objectives reduced the effectiveness of German defensive dispersal, positions were incessantly bombarded, trenches, barbed wire and dugouts disappearing as far back as the second line. Shell-hole positions about apart, containing two or three men were quickly overrun by Anglo-French infantry and prepared for defence, before a could be made. Deliberate counter-attacks () were planned but most were cancelled due to shortages of troops, artillery and ammunition. Attempts to connect shell-hole positions during quiet periods failed, because Allied air reconnaissance quickly directed artillery-fire onto them. Trenches were evacuated before attacks, which began the development of defended areas, in which small groups manoeuvred to deprive Allied gunners of recognisable targets, vastly inflating the amount of ammunition necessary for bombardments.

==Prelude==

===Anglo-French preparations===
The British attacks on intended to prepare the way for a big attack, combined with the French north of the Somme, failed due to disorganisation, lack of co-ordination by the British and French armies and the effectiveness of the German defence. On 24 July, Haig instructed Rawlinson to concentrate on the right flank of the Fourth Army and co-ordinate attacks with the French but to keep up the pressure, rather than delay to arrange larger attacks. Subsidiary operations were to be conducted on the rest of the Fourth Army front to close up to the German second line, bringing the British line into a position favourable for another general attack. The French Sixth Army was reinforced by another corps on the north bank and captured documents were circulated, which revealed that the German defence had been instructed to occupy the front line with fewer troops and place units in echelon and depth for local counter-attacks, to exploit surprise and use engineers offensively.

Rawlinson issued instructions that with the French Sixth Army, XIII Corps was to capture the German second position from Falfemont Farm to Guillemont. A combined attack was planned for 30 July, by the French from Hem to Maurepas and the British from Falfemont Farm to Guillemont, with supporting attacks on the rest of the Fourth Army front. The British attack reached the village again and was driven out by flanking fire, one battalion losing Despite a GHQ directive of 16 July, a creeping barrage was not used because of shortages of ammunition and worn guns. Many German defensive positions were out of view of the British artillery and a deterioration in the weather grounded British artillery observation aircraft, reducing the accuracy of British bombardments. GHQ considered that the costly failure of the attacks on 30 July had been due to the tenacity of the German defence, the quality of its tactical leadership and the move towards defence in depth. Fresh German divisions were being thrown in as soon as they arrived, yet suffering many losses and more Allied attacks could cause the German defence to collapse. A pause by the Anglo-French to prepare larger combined attacks, would provide a respite for the defenders.

Foch and Haig met on 1 August to discuss the redeployment of most of the French Sixth Army to the north bank and the transfer of operations on the south bank to the Tenth Army (General Joseph Alfred Micheler) which received II Corps as a reinforcement. A common attack on 7 August and a combined attack on 11 August, were agreed but this quickly broke down, when the British part of the attack was postponed to 8 August. On 2 August, Haig directed that &quot;careful and methodical&quot; attacks were to be &quot;pushed forward without delay&quot; and that with the French, the line should be moved forward on the right flank around Guillemont, with &quot;no serious attacks&quot; on the left flank of the Fourth Army. Rawlinson continued to attack on the left flank of the Fourth Army and attacks with the French on the right flank were supported by artillery with far less ammunition than in July, were poorly co-ordinated and encountered unexpected delays, during several periods of wet weather. Another delay was caused by Lieutenant-General Walter Congreve the XIII Corps commander, being relieved due to illness on 10 August. He was replaced by the XIV Corps staff under Lieutenant-General Lord Cavan, which had to move from the Reserve Army front to take over.

Joffre met Haig on 11 August, to press his policy of combined broad-front attacks, proposing an attack on 22 August, to advance from the Somme northwards through Combles, Ginchy, High Wood and Thiepval, followed by an attack on 1 September, to take Bouchavesnes, Rancourt, Morval, Flers, Martinpuich, Courcelette and Grandcourt. Haig proposed a less ambitious attack, from the Somme to High Wood about 18 August to which Joffre agreed. Haig and Foch met on 19 August and arranged plans to capture Guillemont on 24 August, combined with French attacks from the Somme to Maurepas. Another attack was decided for 26 or 27 August, from Cléry to Le Forêt by the French and from Wedge Wood to Ginchy by the British. On 24 August, Haig criticised the Fourth Army headquarters for failing adequately to supervise the planning of attacks, which had been too narrow and conducted with insufficient forces. Haig wanted an attack on Guillemont with divisions, to ensure a continuous attack on the whole front and far more scrutiny by Rawlinson of subordinates in the preparation of attacks. The need to replace divisions opposite Guillemont, difficulties in co-ordination with the French and several days of rain from 25 August, delayed the next attack until 3 September.

After taking over from XIII Corps in mid-August, Cavan held a meeting with the divisional commanders to discuss the next attack, at which it was stressed that it would take place along all of the Corps front and that supervision from above was not inconsistent with granting initiative to subordinates. The Corps General Officer Commanding Royal Artillery (GOCRA) was to decide the lines of barrages but liaise with divisions, which would work out the details. XIV Corps headquarters was to co-ordinate divisional plans, rather than dictate them, discretion by divisional commanders being retained within the corps plan, especially as command of the artillery reverted to divisions at zero hour. Observation posts were established with provision for telephone, visual and pigeon communication. Guillemont was captured and held, German counter-attacks defeated and the ground consolidated in a rainstorm overnight. Operations against Ginchy from the south and towards Leuze and Bouleaux woods commenced.

===Anglo-French plans===
In XIII Corps, the 35th Division was to attack at on 20 July to take trenches between Maltz Horn Farm and Arrow Head Copse, preliminary to the general attack on Guillemont and on the rest of the German second position, after a thirty-minute bombardment to cover a French attack on the right, which was then cancelled. Two companies of the 105th Brigade, attacked against massed machine-gun and artillery-fire and were shelled out of the few parts of the German front line they reached; an attack at by a battalion of the 104th Brigade also failed. The Fourth Army artillery began to register targets (firing ranging shots) on 21 July but poor visibility, made aircraft observation impossible at times. Co-ordination of the combined attack, proved impossible for the three armies and the 35th Division and 3rd Division attacked Guillemont early on 22 July and were repulsed. The bombardment for the series of attacks due on began at on 22 July, which alerted the Germans but the non-moon period was expected to protect the British infantry.

On 23 July, Haig ordered the Fourth Army to capture the German front line, as a preliminary to another general attack. XIII Corps was ordered to capture the German second position, from Falfemont Farm to Guillemont, during the next French attack on the north bank. Rawlinson and Foch met on 24 July and postponed the joint attack to 27 July, for more artillery preparation due to the poor visibility, as the French continued the &quot;terrific&quot; bombardment which had begun on 22 July. Meetings between Rawlinson, Fayolle, Foch and Haig continued to try to plan a combined attack, which was eventually arranged for 30 July but also had several zero hours. The 30th Division was to attack through the 35th Division positions, from Falfemont Farm to Guillemont and the 2nd Division to attack from Waterlot Farm at as the only French attack took place from the river to Maurepas. The failure was similar to that of 23 July and was ascribed to the difficulty of attacking from the south-west and west, especially with no French attack over the head of the Maurepas ravine, north of the village. Most of the ground captured by the French was lost to German counter-attacks.

The British postponed their attack to 8 August, reduced the depth of the objective and made six &quot;Chinese&quot; attacks on 7 August, to inflict losses and mislead the defenders. The attack differed little from previous attempts, although careful briefings were conducted and elaborate measures taken to maintain communication, using contact-patrol aircraft to observe ground flares, mirrors, lamps and panels. Visual signalling posts and relay posts for runners were prepared and messenger-pigeons taken forward. Infantry wore shiny tin discs on the back of their equipment, to be visible from the air and a wireless station was set up near Favière Wood. Visual signalling still failed again during the attack, due to mist, dust and smoke. Congestion in the British trenches in front of Trônes Wood made a fresh attack impossible until next day. On 9 August, some battalions had not arrived by zero hour, the attacks failed and British troops isolated in Guillemont were overwhelmed and captured.

Rawlinson discussed the situation with the commanders of the 55th, 2nd and 24th divisions and ordered that the next attack must be thoroughly prepared. Haig intervened to urge no delay on strategic grounds and discussed the problem posed by German defenders hiding in shell-holes and the débris of the village. Rawlinson met Fayolle later, to discuss the combined attack due on 11 August. On 10 August, XIII Corps reported that the attack would be ready by 17 August. The day was misty and rainy, which grounded aircraft and led to the attack being postponed for a day and ground taken by an advance of two companies of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division was abandoned, after the French attack was repulsed. Foch and Rawlinson met on 13 August, to plan an operation in which XIV Corps would attack Guillemont, after the French captured Maurepas and Angle Wood, followed by an attack by XIV Corps on Wedge Wood and Falfemont Farm, at dawn on 19 August. A combined attack on 22 August, from Le Forêt to Bois Douage by the French, prolonged from Leuze Wood to Ginchy by the British, was also arranged. Rawlinson and Fayolle agreed a preliminary attack for 16 August, from Angle Wood to south of Guillemont, which took place in hot weather, with special arrangements for counter-battery fire and communication. The British and French made a small advance but most of the captured ground was lost to a counter-attack overnight.

The plan for the combined attack on 18 August was drastically changed after the 16 August failure, with Rawlinson and Fayolle arranging to capture Guillemont in two days, as the French concentrated on taking Angle Wood and preparing for an attack on 22 August. A methodical bombardment for was planned, with no increase in the rate of shelling before the attack and a field artillery &quot;curtain&quot; of fire was to precede the infantry, by dropping back from the German front line to no man&#x27;s land in front of the British troops, then moving forward at per minute. The attack was to occur in two stages, with a two-hour pause for consolidation before the final advance. The day was dull and showery, the French attack was repulsed but British troops took parts of the first objective west of Falfemont Farm and west and north-west of Guillemont, as far as the station. On 20 August, Rawlinson met the corps commanders, discussed the policy of &quot;relentless pressure&quot; laid down by Haig and arranged an attack on the west side of Guillemont for 21 August.

A small attack on Arrow Head Copse failed, part of ZZ Trench into the village from the north was taken and the French captured Angle Wood. The attack on 21 August failed and the plan for 24 August was changed late on 22 August. The French would attack from the Somme to Maurepas, the 35th Division would conform but stop short of the German second position and the 20th Division would take the north edge of Guillemont and the south-west of Ginchy. A German artillery bombardment and counter-attack late on 23 August, led to the cancellation of the XIV Corps attack, except on the right of the 35th Division, the French attack mostly being repulsed. On 25 August, Rawlinson announced a series of divisional reliefs, which delayed the attack to the end of August, when it was arranged that XIV Corps would attack the German second position, from Falfemont Farm to Guillemont. Heavy rain began to fall on 25 August and turned the ground into a swamp, preventing the digging of assembly trenches, blocking routes to the front line and severely slowing the flow of supplies. The bombardment opened in the morning of 29 August and the attack was postponed again to 1 September, then postponed again to 3 September, because of a thunderstorm on 29 August.

A German bombardment on 26 August, was followed by the biggest counter-attack of the battle on 31 August at Delville Wood, north of the XIV Corps area opposite Guillemont. Preparation of the combined attack became easier, after the rain stopped on 30 August. The preliminary bombardment began at on 2 September, from the boundary with the French Sixth Army to High Wood, with a German counter-bombardment mainly falling short on Ginchy. A periodic field artillery bombardment, swept the ground between the main German trenches and a creeping barrage was planned for the attack. The 5th Division next to the French, arranged for the infantry to keep about behind a barrage moving at per minute. The final objective of XIV Corps, was a line facing north-east, through the far end of Leuze Wood on the spur above Combles, gaining touch with the French at Savernake Wood, Falfemont Farm being taken as a preliminary at on 3 September, when the French I Corps at Oakhanger Wood also advanced, the main attack by the Sixth and Fourth armies beginning at noon.

===German preparations===

Despite the obliteration of trench lines, by stupendous Allied artillery bombardments, the value of trenches as boundaries and rallying-points remained and as labour became available, new back lines and switch trenches were dug, sited according to the principles used by Loßberg in Champagne in late 1915. An artillery observation line was chosen and then a main line of resistance was dug in front, behind a crest overlooked by the observation line. Outposts were built along the crest, for infantry observers and listening-posts. Another line was built further back near the field artillery, which became known as the (artillery protection line), ready to be occupied by reserves, if the forward area was overrun. Command and supply became more difficult in such dispersed defences, which led to a streamlining of the chain of command, with battalion commanders being given sole authority over an area, as the . Division commanders were given similar control of the forces in the divisional sector, except for aviation units and some heavy artillery being used for special tasks.

Gillemont and Ginchy lay on spurs, which constricted the British right flank and commanded the ground to the south, in the French Sixth Army area. During the time when the German third line and intermediate lines and redoubts, were being completed on the rear slopes of Bazentin Ridge, Allied attacks had become smaller and periods of wet weather, the terrain, supply and ammunition difficulties, combined with the German policy of unyielding defence and the reinforcements reaching the German 1st and 2nd armies, slowed the Anglo-French advance, particularly south of the Somme. The German second line ran north-west, from the French sector near Maurepas to Wedge Wood, behind Arrow Head Copse, in front of Guillemont, past the station and thence to Delville Wood and Longueval, before turning sharply west. The approaches to the village were bare and overlooked by German posts in Leuze Wood. A quarry west of the village and the ground to the south, from Maltzhorn Farm to Angle Wood and Falfemont Farm had been fortified.

The Germans were able to nullify much of the Anglo-French material superiority in the battle, particularly during the periods of cold and wet weather in late July and late August. The defence was as piecemeal as British attacks but with the French exposed to converging artillery-fire, on the Flaucourt Plateau south of the Somme and the British bogged down on Bazentin Ridge, the Germans used observation posts around Guillemont and High Wood, to observe fire into the salients around Maurepas and Guillemont from three sides. Poor weather was less of a handicap to the Germans, while they held such commanding ground. Positions were linked with more support and reserve trenches, behind the second position south and east of Delville Wood and new &quot;switch trenches&quot; dug oblique to forward lines, were used to prevent Anglo-French infantry from &quot;rolling up&quot; German defences, from an isolated penetration.

German field fortifications continued to be defended by machine-gun fire, artillery-fire and swift local counter-attacks, extra heavy artillery brought from Verdun, was used to extend bombardments beyond the Allied front line, to artillery positions and supply routes. New German defensive works were harder to spot, during the fewer periods of good flying weather, often not being revealed until attacking infantry were engaged from them. The Germans also gained an advantage, from being forced back, as the area most devastated by artillery-fire grew wider and was on the Allied side, which created chronic problems in transporting supplies to the front line, periodically made worse by downpours, which turned roads and tracks into glissades of mud. It was far easier for supplies to be brought up to the German front line, as it was pushed back along supply lines that had been established for two years.

==Battle==

===French Sixth Army===

====July–September====

A German counter-attack on 15 July, by companies and a flame thrower detachment, retook the east end of Biaches before being driven out. (Military units in this section are French unless specified.) Over the next few days German counter-attacks took parts of Biaches, Bois Blaise and La Maisonette, beginning a period of costly stalemate in the area. The French attacked between Vermandovillers and Barleux and the 16th Colonial Division captured the German front position, before cross-fire from machine-guns stopped the advance and counter-attacks pushed the French back to the start line, the Colonial Corps losing from . XXXV Corps was reinforced by two extra divisions and heavy artillery from the north bank and attacked from Vermandovillers to Soyécourt, capturing Bois Étoile and the northern half of Soyécourt, before flanking fire from high ground prevented another advance.

North of the Somme, the 39th Division and 11th Division had been relieved by the fresh 47th Division, 153rd Division and XX Corps attacked the German intermediate line. On the Hem plateau near the river, the 47th (1/2nd London) Division captured Bois Sommet, Bois de l&#x27;Observatoire and the west end of Bois de la Pépinière, an advance of in which were taken. The German defenders of Monacu Farm held out and the left flank of the division was stopped short of the intermediate line. To the north, the 153rd Division was held up on its right and took the objective on the left around Maurepas, despite the failure of a supporting attack by the 35th Division on Maltz Horn Farm.

French attacks north of the Somme were resumed on 30 August by the 11th Division and the 39th Division, after delays caused by bad weather. The Germans had dispersed into new smaller positions in greater depth, many of which were concealed by crops several feet high. The attack was &quot;devastated&quot; by German artillery and machine-gun fire, contact with the front was lost when telephone lines were cut and fog made visual signalling impossible; most of the French infantry were forced back to their start line, with Operations south of the Somme were transferred to the Tenth Army and artillery reinforcements arrived on both sides of the Somme. The Sixth Army captured the Hem plateau on the north bank from by stages, before a bigger attack on 12 August captured the German second line from the Somme to Maurepas. Attacks on German positions on the army boundary to the north and around Guillemont failed. The French mopped up the remaining German defences in the second position, which brought the Sixth Army to a position from which it could attack a German intermediate line between Le Forêt and Cléry, in front of the third position, beyond which there were no more German defences.

The Sixth Army was reinforced near the river on 3 September, by XXXIII Corps with the 70th Division and 77th Division astride the river and VII Corps with the 45th Division, 46th Division, 47th Division and 66th Division. XX Corps on the French left was relieved by I Corps (Lieutenant-General Adolphe Guillaumat), with the 1st Division, 2nd Division; several fresh or rested brigades were distributed to each corps. Control of the creeping barrage was delegated to commanders closer to the battle and a communications system using flares, Roman candles, flags and panels, telephones, optical signals, pigeons and message runners was set up to maintain contact with the front line. Four French divisions attacked north of the Somme at noon on 3 September. Cléry was subjected to a machine-gun barrage from the south bank and VII Corps captured most of the village, much of the German position along the Cléry–Le Forêt road and all of the village of Le Forêt. On the left, I Corps advanced , occupied high ground south of Combles and entered Bois Douage in one hour.

On 4 September, the Germans counter-attacked at the Combles ravine, stopping the French advance towards Rancourt and the French captured Sivas Trench and consolidated Cléry, before pushing forward to within attacking distance of the German third line. The British took Falfemont Farm on 5 September and gained touch with the French at Combles ravine. Patrols captured Ferme de l&#x27;Hôpital east of Le Forêt and reached a ridge behind the track from Cléry to Ferme de l&#x27;Hôpital, which forced the Germans to retire to the third line in some confusion, XX Corps having taken . VII Corps took all of Cléry and met XXXIII Corps on the right, which had taken Ommiécourt south of the Somme along with as the most advanced French troops reached the German gun-line.

An attack by I Corps failed on 6 September and attacks were delayed for six days, as the difficulty in supplying such a large force on the north bank was made worse by rain. The Sixth Army front had increased in length, diverged from the line of the Fourth Army advance and a defensive flank being made along Combles ravine by I Corps. V Corps in army reserve was moved forward and Foch issued warning orders for the Cavalry Corps to prepare to exploit a German collapse. Transport difficulties became so bad that Guillaumat ordered all stranded vehicles to be thrown off the roads and to move in daylight, despite German artillery-fire, ready for the resumption of attacks on 12 September.

===French Tenth Army===

The Tenth Army had fourteen infantry and three cavalry divisions in the II Corps, X Corps and XXXV Corps (Military units in this section are French unless specified.) but many of the divisions had been transferred from Verdun and were understrength. The army attacked on the right flank of the Sixth Army, south of the Somme on 4 September, adding to the pressure on the German defence, which had been depleted by the fighting north of the Somme since July. The original German front position ran from Chilly, northwards to Soyécourt then along the new German first line north to Barleux, which had been established after the Sixth Army advances in July. The German defences were manned by five divisions and ran northwards through the fortified villages of Chilly, Vermandovillers, Soyécourt, Deniécourt, Berny-en-Santerre and Barleux. A second line of defence ran from Chaulnes (behind woods to the west and north and the château park, from which the Germans had observation over the ground south of the Flaucourt plateau), Pressoir, Ablaincourt, Mazancourt and Villers-Carbonnel. The attack took place from Chilly on the right flank to Barleux on the left, to gain ground on the Santerre plateau, ready to exploit a possible German collapse and capture crossings over the Somme south of Péronne. A four-stage advance behind a creeping barrage was planned, although reinforcements of artillery and ammunition were not available, due to the demand for resources at Verdun and north of the Somme.

Much of the destructive and counter-battery bombardment in the X and XXXV corps sectors had little effect, against defences which the Germans had improved and reinforced with more infantry. After six days of bombardment, the attack by ten divisions began on a front. The five German divisions opposite were alert and well dug-in but X Corps captured Chilly and part of the woods in the centre of the corps front. The corps was checked on the left at Bois Blockhaus copse, behind the German front line. In XXXV Corps in the centre, the 132nd Division briefly held Vermandovillers and the 43rd Division advanced from Bois Étoile and took Soyécourt. II Corps failed on its right flank, where parts of the German front line held out but advanced further in the north. At Barleux, the 77th Division was obstructed by uncut wire and the advanced troops were cut off and destroyed. German troops in front line dugouts that had not been mopped-up, emerged behind them and stopped the supporting waves in no man&#x27;s land. More ground was taken, preparatory to an attack on the second objective but the offensive was suspended on 7 September, after large German counter-attacks. The French took and Foch doubled the daily allotment of ammunition, to capture the German second position. From 15 to 18 September, the Tenth Army attacked again and captured Berny, Vermandovillers and Déniecourt and several thousand more prisoners.

===Fourth Army===

====July====
XIII Corps attacked Guillemont with the 30th Division at on 23 July. The 21st Brigade attacked with one battalion from Trônes Wood and one from Longueval Alley to the north. The bombardment of the village and the trenches in front of it appeared to have been highly destructive, as was a standing barrage by heavy artillery, on a line from Falfemont Farm to Wedge Wood, Leuze Wood, east of Guillemont to the south of Ginchy. The field artillery fired a creeping barrage in four lifts through the village, stopping on the south and east sides, after zero hour. The attack from Trônes Wood reached the German wire with few casualties, where they found uncut wire and were engaged by artillery and machine-gun fire. The wire was forced, despite many casualties and Guillemont entered. The German garrison continued to fight despite many losses and the most advanced British troops were cut off, as German reinforcements arrived and overwhelmed most of the battalion. Communication with the rear had been cut by a German barrage in no-man&#x27;s-land and a smoke screen, intended to mask the attack from the Germans in Ginchy.
The left-hand battalion got lost in the gloom and smoke blown over Guillemont, some troops veered right and met uncut wire south-east of the village, before falling back to Trônes Wood. Another party took a trench south of the railway, which ran eastwards past the north end of Guillemont and was then pushed back to trenches near Waterlot Farm, obstructing the right of the 3rd Division. On the left, the 3rd Division attacked Guillemont Station, Delville Wood and Longueval, with the 8th Brigade on the right attempting to occupy ground south of the railway. The troops of the 8th Brigade were held up, then fell back to Waterlot Farm, repulsing a German counter-attack later in the morning. Further north, a battalion also tried to bomb down trenches from Waterlot Farm, either side of the Guillemont road and the railway, to the station. The advance was soon stopped by machine-gun fire from Ginchy and the ground to the north-east, forcing the troops to withdraw; the 9th Brigade attacked Delville Wood and Longueval as part of the Battle of Delville Wood.

On 30 July, the 30th Division attacked again, through the positions of the 35th Division again at as the French Sixth Army attacked on the right. The 89th Brigade attacked Falfemont Farm and the second position, up to the edge of Guillemont, which was attacked by the 90th Brigade. Guillemont station and trenches to the north-west were attacked by the 5th Brigade of the 2nd Division. As the troops moved up during the night of 29 July, a German bombardment fell around Trônes Wood and caught troops from the 89th and 90th brigades. At dawn, fog rose and visibility fell below ; Maltz Horn Farm and trenches nearby, were stormed at zero hour, by a British battalion from the west and part of the French 153rd Division from the south. The British advanced to the Hardecourt–Guillemont road, despite many losses and dug in with reinforcements, which had moved forwards in small columns. No French troops could be seen and few of the left-hand battalion reached the road, although a larger party reached an orchard at the south-east edge of Guillemont. On the left, the 90th Brigade advanced either side of the Trônes Wood–Guillemont track, got into the village with few losses and took After a pause, the creeping barrage moved on and the north-east of the village was occupied, touch being gained with the left-hand battalion and a counter-attack repulsed. The left-hand battalion had advanced south of the railway and taken many prisoners at the German front trench, before being stopped by crossfire from the quarry to the south and the station to the north. Another attempt to advance and an effort to form a defensive flank along the railway facing north failed, due to uncut wire and machine-gun fire from the flank, which forced a withdrawal.

Communication with the rear broke down again, as German artillery-fire cut telephone wires and visual signalling was obstructed by the fog, until about Pigeons and runners carried a few messages and at the divisional commander, Major-General John Shea, ordered a line from Maltz Horn Farm to the west side of Guillemont to be consolidated and held at all costs. In the afternoon, the party at the orchard withdrew with difficulty and troops on the Hardecourt–Guillemont road fell back later. On the right flank, the British held on around Maltz Horn Farm, as German infantry advanced through British heavy artillery-fire on Leuze Wood, the crossroads east of Guillemont and Ginchy. Artillery-fire on Guillemont was impossible, because of the British party still holding out; all the British reserves had been committed, which left none to reinforce the troops in the village, who were overwhelmed around On the left flank, the 2nd Division attacked with the 5th Brigade, from Waterlot Farm to Guillemont railway station, with protective machine-gun fire from Delville Wood on the left. Many German machine-gun posts were undamaged and few British troops crossed the German front line to reach the vicinity of the station, where they were shot down, the survivors of the two battalions eventually being withdrawn through a German bombardment. In the heat of the afternoon, the two brigades of the 30th Division reorganised and the 89th Brigade consolidated the only captured ground still held, from the French boundary near Maltz Horn Farm to the Hardecourt–Guillemont road and Arrow Head Copse. During the night the 30th Division and 35th Division were relieved by the 55th (West Lancashire) Division.

====August====
The 55th (West Lancashire) Division (Major-General Hugh Jeudwine) attacked at on 8 August into an easterly wind, which, with mist, dust and smoke from a German counter-barrage, made visual signalling impossible, delaying reports to the 55th (West Lancashire) Division headquarters until after Next to the French, a reinforced battalion of the 165th Brigade advanced over the spur south of Guillemont and was then stopped by German defensive fire and driven under cover in shell-holes. Bombers had moved south-east along Cochrane Alley, into Maurepas ravine, established a trench-block and found themselves unsupported on both flanks, as the French advance had also been stopped by the Germans south-east of Maltz Horn Farm. The right-hand battalion of the 164th Brigade was held up by uncut wire at the south-western edge of Guillemont, where the infantry tried to dig in beyond grenade range, before retiring to their jumping-off trenches. The left-hand battalion broke through on either side of the quarry at the west side of Guillemont and entered the village; reinforcements sent to hold the captured front line behind them were bombed out by a German counter-attack from the south. German machine-guns began to sweep no-man&#x27;s-land and isolated the British troops in the village.

Further north, the 2nd Division attacked with two battalions of the 6th Brigade on the north side of the railway line, where the right-hand battalion reached Guillemont station, except for the fourth company, which was blocked by German troops who reoccupied their front line behind the advanced British troops. The left-hand battalion attacked from Waterlot Farm and reached ZZ Trench, then made a costly attempt to bomb south, losing most of a company before reaching the north end of Guillemont. Communication broke down again during the morning; smoke and dust blocked the view of aircraft observers and no messages were received from Guillemont. The trenches east of Trônes Wood were congested with troops and bombarded by German artillery in the afternoon, which made it impossible for the British to attack again. Jeudwine ordered the 164th Brigade to send more troops into the village after dark and Congreve and the Fourth Army headquarters ordered another attack at on 9 August.
By zero hour, some of the attacking battalions were in position but were met by massed machine-gun fire when they advanced after a hurried bombardment. Disorganisation hampered the attack on the left, where the 166th Brigade was replacing the 164th Brigade. One battalion hugged the barrage and reached the German wire, where it had many casualties attempting to press on. The left-hand battalion was delayed, only beginning its advance after the British barrage had lifted but German small-arms fire quickly stopped the advance. Later in the day, an attack by the 165th Brigade from the positions captured on 8 August also failed. To the north, the 2nd Division attacked again with a battalion of the 6th Brigade south of the railway line, which was repulsed and an attack from Waterlot Farm also failed. The parties from the 55th (West Lancashire) Division, which had got into Guillemont either side of the quarry on 8 August and that of the 2nd Division, which had bombed its way along ZZ Trench into the north end of the village, amid much smoke and confusion, were quickly counter-attacked by German local reserves, until two more German battalions arrived and overwhelmed them. Isolated groups held out for a while at the quarry and more held out at the station until overrun late on 9 August, being seen from the British lines moving towards Ginchy under German escort.

Rawlinson met Congreve and the 55th, 2nd and 24th division commanders on 9 August and suspended the attack until much more thorough preparations had been made; the 2nd Division was relieved by the 24th Division during the night of A combined attack was planned with the Sixth Army for 11 August, when the French would attack either side of Maurepas with a flank guard on the left from the 165th Brigade. The British would capture the spur south of Guillemont by advancing north, from the junction of Cochrane Alley and the Hardecourt–Guillemont road, covered by French attacks into the Maurepas ravine. Joint attacks on Maurepas and Guillemont were expected to be ready by 17 August. On 10 August, mist and rain grounded artillery-observation aircraft, forcing a postponement of the attack but 12 August was fine and clear. The French attack captured much of the German second position from Cléry to Maurepas and the southern portion of the village. The British attack began at after a preliminary bombardment and was covered by a bombardment on the German positions in the south of Guillemont and the second position. Bombers advanced down Cochrane Alley on the right and in the open on the left, reaching the objective in despite machine-gun and rifle fire. French troops on the right did not appear and the troops were withdrawn after dark, except for the trench block in Cochrane Alley. German counter-attacks overnight in the Sixth Army area prevented a resumption of French attacks on 13 August.
On 16 August, the French 153rd Division advanced north-west of Maurepas and into Maurepas ravine, before being repulsed by a counter-attack at The 3rd Division had relieved the 55th (West Lancashire) Division on the night of 14/15 August, ready to attack at on 16 August, which dawned bright and hot. On the right of the 76th Brigade, a battalion quickly cleared Cochrane Alley to the Hardecourt–Guillemont road and took the trench along the road, despite machine-gun fire from Lonely Trench, which was too close to the British front line to be bombarded by artillery. A Stokes mortar bombardment on Lonely Trench failed and attacks by the left-hand battalion of the 76th Brigade and right-hand battalion of the 9th Brigade were defeated, despite several attempts. The left-hand battalion of the 9th Brigade was also stopped soon after beginning its advance. After dark, the British withdrew on the right, only the ground in Cochrane Alley being retained. To the north, a 24th Division attack with a battalion of the 72nd Brigade on German strong-points south of the Trônes Wood–Guillemont track also failed.

Late on 17 August, the British withdrew during a bombardment by heavy howitzers on Lonely Trench, until next day. After two hours, two battalions tried to capture the trench by surprise but were repulsed and another attempt by a composite battalion at on 18 August also failed. The 3rd Division attacked on the right with the 76th Brigade, which reached the first objective near the Hardecourt–Guillemont road on the right and Lonely Trench on the left, some troops also reaching the road beyond. A battalion of the 9th Brigade on the left advanced a short distance before being stopped, which exposed the troops further south to flanking fire from the north and forced them to withdraw. The troops on the right flank were engaged by German machine-gunners firing up the slope from the right and began to dig in. French troops had taken more of Maurepas and advanced either side of the village, gaining touch with the British on their left. Attempts to capture the north end of Lonely Trench and a bombing attack from the north failed and the left battalion of the 9th Brigade was caught in cross-fire when it attacked the German trenches south-east of Arrow Head Copse, only a few parties briefly reaching the objective; the second stage of the attack was suspended.

On the right of the 24th Division, the 73rd Brigade attacked either side of the Trônes Wood–Guillemont track. The battalion to the south of the 73ed Brigade kept close to the barrage but its advance was stopped by machine-gun fire at the German front line. Attempts to get into the trench failed and a German counter-bombardment made the passage of reinforcements impossible. The battalion attacking north of the track was also held up on the right but on the left managed to get into the German front line near the quarry, despite German counter-attacks, as British reinforcements arrived to help consolidate. To the north, touch was gained with the right-hand battalion of the 17th Brigade, which had been unable to see where the barrage began to creep but had advanced anyway and taken many German prisoners. The brigade reached the German front line and part of Waterlot Farm road at the second objective, which were quickly consolidated. Communication by telephone and visual signals did not collapse, which kept the supporting artillery in contact with the infantry.

The left-hand battalion reached the north end of ZZ Trench quickly enough to surprise the garrison. Bombers worked down the German trench along Waterlot Farm road, met the right-hand battalion and then bombed their way north-eastwards to the rest of ZZ Trench, taking about then joined with troops of the 14th Division at the XV Corps boundary. German artillery-fire on the Anglo-French boundary was maintained all day; in the evening the Germans counter-attacked and pushed back the French to the south-western slopes of Maurepas ravine. Some troops on the right of the 76th Brigade also fell back; exaggerated reports of a repulse led to a special reconnaissance early on 19 August, which found that the Germans opposite the 76th Brigade had withdrawn to a line from Falfemont Farm to Wedge Wood and air reconnaissance confirmed that Lonely Trench was empty. During the day, troops from the 76th Brigade and the 8th Brigade on the left were able to dig in beyond the Hardecourt–Guillemont road, reoccupy Lonely Trench and gain touch with the French, who also reoccupied ground to the right. During the night of the 3rd Division was relieved by the 35th Division.

On the night of French troops captured Angle Wood and gained touch with the British along the slope of Maurepas ravine. The 35th Division had taken over the right of the 24th Division to the Trônes Wood–Guillemont track. At on 21 August, the 35th Division failed to capture a German strong point opposite Arrow Head Copse. The 24th Division on the left was subjected to much German artillery-fire but parties from two battalions occupied unopposed the remainder of ZZ Trench leading into Guillemont. At the 35th Division discharged a smoke screen to cover the right of the 24th Division, which attacked the quarry with a battalion of the 72nd Brigade, as two companies of the 17th Brigade attacked south-eastwards from near Guillemont railway station. The attack on the quarry failed after a long bombing fight and the attack from the station was costly to both sides, the British being too depleted to hold the captured ground. The 20th Division relieved the 24th Division by dawn on 22 August and on the night of the 35th Division took over Angle Wood from the French.

Preparations for the next attack were interrupted by a German counter-attack on 23 August. German artillery bombarded the lines of the 20th Division at and attacked the area south of the railway. The German advance was stopped by machine-gun fire but caused much confusion in the British positions, which were full of engineer and pioneer working parties. At more German artillery-fire stopped work for the night and the 20th Division attack was cancelled in the morning. The infantry of the 35th Division had also been extensively bombarded and Rawlinson cancelled all of the XIV Corps attack, except on the right flank of the 35th Division, which was to guard the French flank. At on 24 August, the French attacked from the Somme to the British boundary. The left division of the French I Corps took the German second position south-east of Falfemont Farm and formed a defensive flank on the left, connected with the 35th Division below the Falfemont Farm spur. The rest of Maurepas was captured and I Corps pushed a salient east of the village, halfway to Le Forêt. On the night of 26/27 August, the 5th Division relieved the 35th Division.

====September, Capture of Guillemont====
The 5th Division, on the right flank of XIV Corps, assembled a battalion of the 13th Brigade in captured trenches on the Leuze Wood Spur, about short of Falfemont Farm on 3 September. The battalion attacked at between Point 48 and the farm grounds on the left, as German defensive fire pinned down the French 127th Regiment in the ravine; the French barrage in support of the British, was abruptly switched south against a German counter-attack. The British troops were fired on from the front and flanks, which inflicted A resumption of the attack was ordered, as German artillery fired on the British assembly trenches. At noon, the 95th Brigade attacked the spur north of Falfemont Farm towards Guillemont; both battalions took the German first line and then captured dug-outs and a machine-gun nest near Wedge Wood. The attack began again at and captured the German second line, from Wedge Wood to the south-eastern fringe of the village, against slight resistance. The right-hand battalion had many casualties when fired on from Falfemont Farm, as the 13th Brigade attacked it again and advanced towards Wedge Wood. Flanking machine-gun fire was encountered from Combles ravine, as another French attack took place further south, towards Bois Douage, north-east of Maurepas. A small advance was made on the left, south of Wedge Wood but &quot;feeble&quot; British artillery support was inaccurate and the creeping barrage fell behind one of the attacking battalions.

The 95th Brigade easily advanced to the third objective on the Wedge Wood–Ginchy road at Consolidation began, touch was gained with troops of the 20th Division in Guillemont and were taken. The battalions in support had moved forward promptly and communication with the advance had been maintained by flares at each objective, which were reported by ground and air observers. The repulse of the 13th Brigade required its relief by the 15th Brigade, which delayed the attack on Falfemont Farm until The attack on the right was stopped again by flanking machine-gun fire but Wedge Wood was captured on the left and touch gained with the 95th Brigade on the Ginchy road. A further advance by the 95th Brigade to the final objective was not made despite the ground in front appearing to be empty of Germans, as the failure at Falfemont Farm and the position of the 20th Division to the north, would have created a salient. At attacks were suspended by Major-General Reginald Stephens, the 5th Division commander, until the next day. The 5th Division battalions had about each before the attack and casualties during the day were mostly wounded.

On the 20th Division front, the line had been pushed close to the west and south-west of Guillemont; assembly trenches dug near the station made an attack from the north-west feasible. The 59th Brigade, due to attack the south end of the village, was so depleted that a battalion was attached from each of the 60th and 61st brigades and the 47th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division, relieved the 60th Brigade for the attack on the northern part of the village. On the left flank of the 59th Brigade, a battalion advanced through the British barrage before zero hour and surprised the defenders, as a battalion from the 47th Brigade did the same north of Mount Street. The main attack began at noon and in twenty minutes, the 59th Brigade reached the first objective along the Hardecourt road to Mount Street, the left-hand battalion mopping-up at the quarry to the north where the battalion of the 47th Brigade had pressed on. The left-hand battalion of the 47th Brigade attacked from the station and overran the German defences, as contact patrols reported the capture of the first objective by The advance to the second objective began at against much more artillery and machine-gun fire. Two battalions reinforced the 59th Brigade and one battalion leap-frogged through the right-hand battalion of the 47th Brigade.

By the battalions consolidated near North and South streets, before advancing again at to the Wedge Wood–Ginchy road against little opposition as the 47th Brigade prolonged the line to the north. The infantry reorganised swiftly and before a fresh battalion and a pioneer company occupied Guillemont and dug-in, touch being gained with 5th Division troops later. A report arrived at that the 7th Division had been forced out of Ginchy, which led to the advance to Leuze Wood being cancelled, apart from patrols. German counter-attacks across the Guillemont–Ginchy road at were repulsed. Rain began to fall after dark, as the new line was consolidated, with the 59th Brigade along the Wedge Wood–Ginchy road and the 47th Brigade on a line from Guillemont, to the south-west corner of Ginchy. At dusk, German aircraft appeared and an accurate bombardment began on the new positions. Supporting attacks by the Fourth Army further north failed and more were ordered by Rawlinson for after a preliminary bombardment from dawn.

Dawn on 4 September was accompanied by wind and showers, as the 5th Division prepared to attack the German second position from Point 48 to Wedge Wood and Valley Trench to the north. Two battalions from the 16th (Irish) Division were attached to the 5th Division and one to the 20th Division. The 15th Brigade prepared to attack Falfemont Farm again, having gained touch with French troops overnight, who did not attack as arranged at which led to the British being raked by machine-gun fire from Combles ravine. A party reached the farm and was bombed out, as a battalion began to bomb south-eastwards from Wedge Wood and another battalion worked round covered by the spur, part of the farm being captured by A frontal attack at failed and a battalion was detailed to sap forward overnight. Patrols near the Leuze Wood spur prevented German reinforcements from moving forward and troops seen advancing from Combles were dispersed by British artillery-fire. In the 95th Brigade area, Valley Trench was occupied with one casualty and the edge of Leuze Wood was reached at where the British barrage stopped the advance temporarily, before the wood was entered and consolidated, few German troops being seen.

The situation in Ginchy was obscure but British troops were believed to be in occupation, German troops still holding out between the village and the Quadrilateral. Part of the 47th Brigade had been relieved overnight but the 59th Brigade troops were still present. During the afternoon only patrols advanced, reaching a line west of Leuze Wood to the north-west to the Guillemont road; German sniping from Ginchy stopped troops advancing along the railway. The 59th Brigade was relieved overnight in heavy rain by part of the 49th Brigade. In the early hours of 5 September, the 5th Division captured the rest of Falfemont Farm and patrolled towards sending troops down Combles ravine, to link with the French at the railway in Savernake Wood and the 95th Brigade in Leuze Wood, reports reaching the 5th Division headquarters at recommending that the advance continue. Rawlinson ordered an advance into Leuze Wood and the higher ground towards Ginchy. At an attack on Combles Trench failed, as unseen wire was encountered in standing crops, as did a second attempt at In the north the 95th Brigade advance into Leuze Wood was unopposed.

The 20th Division was relieved by the 16th (Irish) Division during the morning and posts along the Guillemont–Leuze Wood road linked by a continuous trench, a battalion linking with the 5th Division in Leuze Wood. In the early morning of 6 September, as the rain stopped, the 56th Division relief of the 5th Division south of Leuze Wood, was interrupted by a German counter-attack. On the left, the 95th Brigade was relieved by the 49th Brigade, which crossed the Combles–Ginchy road and entered Bouleaux Wood, as German artillery bombarded the spur south-west of Leuze Wood all day. As night fell, the 5th Division relief continued, despite a German counter-attack and by the attack had been repulsed, the 56th Division completing the relief early on 7 September. Patrols on the left of the 16th (Irish) Division attempting to advance along the railway, were stopped by fire from the Quadrilateral and the 48th Brigade received continuous shellfire as the fighting in Ginchy continued. At the 48th and 49th brigades began to advance at the brigade boundary, the 49th Brigade moving the left flank to face north-east and the 48th Brigade being stopped by fire from the Quadrilateral and Ginchy.

===Air operations===

German infantry were under constant observation from aircraft and balloons, which directed huge amounts of artillery-fire accurately onto their positions and made many machine-gun attacks. Infantry Regiment 68 ordered that men in shell-holes should dig fox-holes or cover themselves with earth for camouflage and sentries were to keep still, to avoid being seen. The German air effort in July and August was almost wholly defensive, which led to harsh criticism from the ground troops and ineffectual attempts to counter Anglo-French aerial dominance, which dissipated German air strength to no effect. A fiasco occurred on 22 July, when photographic reconnaissance aircraft were sent to engage a British aircraft, which turned out to be a German Albatros. The effect of Anglo-French artillery observation aircraft was considered &quot;brilliant&quot;, &quot;annihilating&quot; German artillery and attacking infantry from very low altitude, causing severe anxiety among German troops, who began to treat all aircraft as Allied and led to a belief that Anglo-French aircraft were armoured. Attempts to help the infantry by redeploying German aircraft, resulted in many losses for no result and further undermined relations between the infantry and (Imperial German Flying Corps). German artillery units preferred direct protection of their batteries, to artillery observation flights which led to more losses, as German aircraft were inferior to their opponents as well as outnumbered. Slow production of German aircraft exacerbated equipment problems, which led to German air squadrons being equipped with a motley of designs, until the arrival of Jagdstaffel 2 under Oswald Boelcke, equipped with the Halberstadt D.II, which regained a measure of air superiority in August.

The attack on 30 July took place in a fog which grounded British aircraft until about when 9 Squadron sent all of its aircraft on artillery observation, contact patrol and photographic reconnaissance. German artillery-fire had increased so much that ground communication failed, which made contact patrols and counter-battery artillery observation much more important. On 8 August, a 9 Squadron aircraft flew for hours, searching for mirror-flashes from British troops and delivered a map to the Corps headquarters; the same crew patrolled in the afternoon and found the headquarters of the three attacking battalions, which were still cut off from ground communication. On 18 August the afternoon attack on Guillemont was observed by a 9 Squadron crew during another hour flight, which called for fire on a trench full of Germans near Ginchy, as other aircraft located signalling panels and ground sheets identifying the attacking battalion headquarters, which showed that the right-hand division had failed to reach its objectives and aircrews also made machine-gun attacks on parties of German infantry in and around the front line. Observations early next day indicated that the Germans were making small withdrawals, which continued over the next two days and were seen by crews from 34 Squadron, 3 Squadron and 9 Squadron, many descending below to observe.
On the night airship S. S. 40 made a four-hour reconnaissance but having to fly above to avoid ground-fire, found that little could be observed on the ground. A storm on 29 August blew down a 21 Squadron hangar, in which five B.E. 2c&#x27;s were destroyed and nine damaged. On 3 September the attack on Guillemont was observed by 9 Squadron aircraft. A contact patrol from watched British troops advance on Guillemont and German troops send up distress flares, when they withdrew from the village and the trenches between Guillemont and Wedge Wood. Just after British mirror flashes were seen along the eastern edge of Guillemont and after another half-hour, more were seen at Wedge Wood and the Ginchy road, up to the Leuze Wood–Guillemont crossroads. Further south the 5th Division was seen to be held up before Falfemont Farm, where the crew descended and attacked a German machine-gun detachment holding up the British advance. Later contact patrols revealed that Falfemont Farm was not captured but that to the north ground had been consolidated. The farm was attacked again in the afternoon of 4 September, as 9 Squadron observed and a message was sent to the British artillery when German troops were seen to leave a quarry near the farm and take position in shell-holes nearby, which was followed by a &quot;curtain of fire&quot; falling on the German positions. More reports showed that the left of the 5th Division had reached Leuze Wood. Falfemont Farm was captured in the early hours of 7 September.

===German 1st Army===
The fall of Trônes Wood on 14 July, exposed Guillemont to attack and British heavy artillery shells began falling on the village soon after. By 20 July, the shelling had smashed road surfaces and cratered adjacent fields; a super-heavy gun fired a shell into the village every few minutes day and night. Most of the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division, relieved the 123rd Division around Maurepas in shell-hole positions. Reserve Infantry Regiment 104 held Guillemont and Reserve Regiment 13 the trenches in front of Ginchy, which were &quot;destroyed&quot; by the British bombardment. The commander of III Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 104 was cut off, until a counter-attack by the regimental storm-troops reached the headquarters, while some of the British held out until before surrendering when their ammunition ran out. Part of the regiment also counter-attacked towards Waterlot Farm and was stopped by British machine-gun fire.

A detached regiment of the 8th Bavarian Reserve Division, was returned from Barleux on the south bank, to relieve exhausted battalions of the rest of the division. The northern flank of the British attack, penetrated the junction of I Battalion, Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 22 and Saxon Reserve Infantry Regiment 107, before being forced back by A local counter-attack on the north-east of Guillemont at the same time, was repulsed and when the fog lifted at four companies of Saxon Reserve Infantry Regiment 107 advanced from Ginchy with part of Reserve Regiment 13, as three companies of Reserve Infantry Regiment 104 attacked from the east, eventually overwhelming the British party in the village during the afternoon. 

The area from Maurepas to Guillemont and Ginchy, was taken over by the 27th Division which was still contained four regiments. North of the Somme, the French attacked the positions of Reserve Infantry Regiment 17, on high ground around Hem during 7 August. In a combined Franco-British attack on 12 August, the British infantry reached Guillemont but two battalions diverged. German troops made their way north-east through the gap, to re-establish the front line, as other units advanced from the village, where the dug-outs had several exits. III Battalion, Infantry regiment 124 engaged the British in the village, as III Battalion, Infantry Regiment 123 was pushed back into Guillemont, by an attack from the north. When II Battalion, Infantry Regiment 124 and II Battalion, Grenadier Regiment 123 arrived, the counter-attack was resumed and gradually overran the British in and around the village. The southern part of Maurepas and the cemetery were lost, after of battle, when German artillery-support failed due to lack of observation. The area between Cléry and Maurepas had been held and counter-attacks were made by the 5th Bavarian Reserve Division, which was rushed forward after 13 August, to reinforce the defence. A British document was captured near Guillemont, containing German phrases intended to mislead the defence. On 16 August, Infantry Regiment 127 was relieved by battalions of regiments 123 and 124, which had only been withdrawn four days earlier. By 18 August, when the division had lost the British attacked again.

In the late evening of 23 August, German artillery bombarded the British front from the French boundary westwards. An hour later, patrols went forward as the 26th Division and 27th Division of XIII Württemberg Corps were being relieved by with the 111th Division and the 56th Division, from Angle Wood to Longueval. The 27th Division was relieved after except for the artillery which stayed for eight weeks, losing and to mechanical faults and counter-battery fire. One field regiment was engaged from 25 July to the end of September, losing were made unserviceable, while firing more than . The 1st Guard Division and 2nd Guard Division between Le Forêt and Maurepas, were attacked late in the afternoon but eventually drove of the French infantry; between Cléry, Bouchavesnes and Le Forêt, fighting continued.

On 3 September, Cléry and Guillemont to the north, fell, a severe blow to morale; Hindenburg and Ludendorff ended the policy of defending ground at all costs on 5 September and ordered the construction of the (Hindenburg Line) to the east. Falfemont Farm was held by Infantry Regiment 164 of the 111th Division, with Guard Grenadier Regiment 4 of the 2nd Guard Division to the south-east. Fusilier Regiment 73, on the right of the 111th Division, was distributed in depth, the II Battalion and a machine-gun company in Guillemont and the III Battalion between Leuze Wood and the Quadrilateral. The I Battalion was caught by the British bombardment of the village and overwhelmed by the III Battalion being prevented from counter-attacking by the British barrage. A gap appeared between Infantry Regiment 164 and Fusilier Regiment 73, I Battalion being taken by surprise and almost &quot;annihilated&quot;; more than were captured and many were killed. The II and III battalions of Fusilier Regiment 73, attempted a morning counter-attack from Leuze Wood but were stopped by British artillery. The I and III battalions of Infantry Regiment 76 held the trench between Leuze Wood and the Quadrilateral and gained touch with Fusilier Regiment 73 during the night, when part of the III Battalion of Reserve Infantry Regiment 107 of the 24th Reserve Division arrived to fill the gap.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

In 2001, Peter Liddle wrote that beyond imposing a delay, the German policy of unyielding defence and counter-attack failed and ought to be judged on the same terms as British and French methods. Haig and Joffre were right to believe that a serious German collapse was possible until late July and a convincing alternative to attrition in the circumstances of late July – early September 1916, has not been proposed. In 2009, William Philpott criticised the weeks of costly, small, narrow-front attacks against a skilful and determined defence by the Germans, yet Gallwitz &quot;had no better tactical method&quot;, which reduced operations to a battle of wills. In the Fourth Army area from counter-attacks were made against attacks, exposing German infantry to similar costly and frustrating failures. German artillery and air inferiority was a great disadvantage and led to constant losses. In 2011, Gary Sheffield wrote that analysis of captured documents and prisoner interrogations indicated the strain being imposed on the German army.

In 2006, Jack Sheldon also wrote that Allied aerial dominance in August put the Germans at a serious tactical disadvantage, that some troops began to avoid the remaining dugouts and that much of the Entente artillery was used constantly to bombard targets deep behind German lines. J. P. Harris wrote in 2009, that on the German side, conditions were worse and the British improved the accuracy of their artillery-fire, with the help of aircraft observation. At the end of August, Falkenhayn was dismissed, partly due to disagreements over his conduct of the defence of the Somme. Few writers in English have compared the British experience with that of the French Sixth Army. The large British effort on the Somme helped to preserve relations with the French, although Joffre deprecated British the piecemeal attacks of late July to early September.

Robert A. Doughty wrote in 2005, that the French on the Somme had failed to combine their attacks with the British and in early September attacked sequentially. Joffre ordered the French offensive to continue as long as weather allowed and in September and October, French attacks were as piecemeal as the British. In 2005, Prior and Wilson analysed the British on the Somme from which included the fighting for Guillemont. After sixty days, thirty-two British divisions had been engaged and lost the British were bogged down, having advanced on a front and the deeper advance at Guillemont had only occurred at the end of the period. On fifty days, an average of eight divisions were in the line but fewer than six battalions attacked and only twice did more than half of the battalions in the line attack. British assaults were constant, small and narrow-front affairs, against which the Germans could concentrate artillery and inflict many casualties. British divisions stayed in the front line from two to and casualties varied from day in the 5th Division, to fewer than day in the 23rd Division.

Prior and Wilson wrote that the 1st Division attacked fourteen times, yet six divisions attacked only once; single attacks were made by , three were made by and one battalion attacked six times. Some of the difference is explained by divisions having been engaged from but the rest is called &quot;whim&quot;, with no pattern in the direction or frequency of attacks or the time divisions spent in the line. The large number of small uncoordinated attacks, when it was not possible to protect infantry with creeping barrages, demonstrated a failure of duty by the British commanders, inexperience in the command of large forces and the impossibility of predicting the warfare of the Western Front, partly explain British failures.

The Germans had recovered from the defeats in the south in July, many defensive positions were out of view of the British artillery and at times poor weather grounded British artillery observation aircraft. The salient at Delville Wood was exposed to German artillery-fire from the north and east and could only be eliminated by an advance at Guillemont, yet of seventy Fourth Army attacks, only twenty were against Guillemont. The attack of was &quot;tactically dubious&quot;, despite being a broad front attack co-ordinated with the French. Zero hour was on 23 July but two divisions made zero hour to conform to the French, who then cancelled their attack. The co-ordinated attack planned by the French Sixth Army, Fourth and Reserve armies became uncoordinated minor attacks, at and the first serving to alert the Germans.

British artillery had good observation over the German defences at Guillemont but the German infantry dispersed into shell-holes, which nullified the effect of much of the artillery-fire. British infantry reached the village several times and were then trapped by fire, from shell-hole positions on both flanks and from ahead. Wilfred Miles, the official historian, wrote that the attacks on 23 and 30 July failed because an attack from west and south-west, with no French supporting attack at Maurepas Ravine to the south, could not succeed. Philpott called hand grenades the main weapon and the side which won the bombing fight usually prevailed, which at Guillemont in August was the German, the British being &quot;finished off with grenades and cold steel&quot;.

Prior and Wilson called Haig&#x27;s instructions of 2 August, for &quot;careful and methodical&quot; attacks, &quot;pushed forward without delay&quot; so ambiguous as to be incomprehensible and Rawlinson incapable of implementing them. Sheffield wrote that criticism of directives from Haig, underestimated the difficulty in balancing tactical, operational and strategic demands. Line straightening attacks were costly but were better than imposing complicated manoeuvres on the infantry. After the failure on 8 August, Haig ordered Rawlinson to plan an attack on a wide front, combined with the French. On 11 August, Haig and Joffre agreed a joint attack by the French Sixth and British Fourth armies on Maurepas and Guillemont. The attack was delayed by rain and supply difficulties, then French co-operation was cancelled again. On 18 August, the 3rd Division was &quot;shattered&quot; and the only success was obtained by the 24th Division, behind a creeping barrage; the British returned to smaller attacks. On 24 August, Haig criticised Rawlinson for failing to supervise planning and for attacking on narrow fronts with insufficient forces. Sheffield blamed Rawlinson who had &quot;abdicated responsibility&quot; and called Haig&#x27;s directive a &quot;Boy&#x27;s Own&quot; guide to command.

An attack was postponed until 3 September, when Falfemont Farm, Leuze Wood and Guillemont were captured, in an advance of on a front, which eliminated the salient at Delville Wood and exposed Ginchy to attack from the south. Harris also considered that pressure on Rawlinson from Haig led to the capture of Guillemont but criticised Haig for ignorance of the climate of the Somme region, where the weather usually broke around 25 September. Philpott doubted the existence of a &quot;learning curve&quot; but wrote that British methods improved, with principles devised for dealing with isolated German machine-guns, attacks in waves followed by small groups of supporting troops and consolidation of captured ground, spread through the BEF, although fresh divisions had to learn the same lessons, also evident in some French Tenth Army divisions on the south bank. Many errors were made by over promoted and inexperienced officers, while others like Horne, Congreve and Cavan, proved themselves to be talented corps commanders.

===Casualties===
The 2nd Division suffered from . The 3rd Division had from and more casualties from . From the 5th Division lost and from the 7th Division lost The 20th Division suffered from . Casualties in the 24th Division during August were and the division lost casualties in September. The 30th Division lost in the fighting around Guillemont and the 55th (West Lancashire) Division lost in August. The British had suffered by the end of July and French casualties reached by the third week of July. At the end of August, British casualties had increased to and French to In September, French casualties on the Somme had increased to the most costly month of the battle. German casualties on the Somme during August were , substantially fewer than in July ( in the first ten days) and in September were , the worst month of the battle. From the 24th Reserve Division had .

===Subsequent operations===
After the divisional reliefs on 6 September, the British continued their advance south of Ginchy as the French Sixth Army pushed eastwards from Maurepas. On 8 September the 168th Brigade of the 56th (1/1st London) Division was relieved by the 169th Brigade in Leuze Wood, which gained touch with the French troops in Combles ravine and bombed down Combles Trench until forced back by a German counter-attack at To the west, the 16th (Irish) Division abandoned an advanced trench near the Quadrilateral. Ginchy had been exposed to attack from the south and was captured in the Battle of Ginchy on 9 September. After British attacks by the Reserve Army on the Ancre and French attacks by the Tenth and Sixth armies from 4 to 12 September, the Fourth Army attacked again at the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15 to 22 September), the Germans holding on to the Quadilateral until 18 September.

<text>Corumbá () is a municipality in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, 425 km northwest of Campo Grande, the state&#x27;s capital. It has a population of approximately 112,000 inhabitants, and its economy is based mainly on agriculture, animal husbandry, mineral extraction, and tourism, being the gateway to the biggest wetlands of the world, the Pantanal. Due to its border with Bolivia, Bolivians in Brazil constitute a significant portion of the city&#x27;s population, forming a distinct cultural community. The city is served by Corumbá International Airport.

Corumbá is the westernmost and northernmost city in Mato Gosso do Sul, and it is by far the largest municipality by area in that state, composing 18% of its territory. It is also the eleventh largest municipality in Brazil and the largest outside Amazonas and Pará. The territory of Corumbá has an enclaved municipality within it: Ladário.

On September 20, 2021, the record high temperature of was registered. On June 22, 1933, the record low temperature of was recorded.

==History==
Founded as a military outpost and colony in 1778 by the Spanish. It became strategically important with the opening of the Paraguay River to international trade after the Paraguayan War (1865–70). Nearby are the buttes of Mt Urucum, which contain vast mineral deposits. In 1878 it was raised to the category of city.

In 1938, the governments of Brazil and Bolivia agreed to begin consutrction on the Santa Cruz-Corumbá Railway, a section of the General Manuel Belgrano Railway that connected Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia with the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. The railway was finished in 1955.

==Pantanal==

The ecoregion Pantanal is the most important plain of all humid areas in South America. Its large territory meets in the Mato Grosso do Sul, is known as South Pantanal and the city of Corumbá serves as its entrance door. The Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul is recognized as one of the most exuberant and diversified natural reserves on the planet.

The great diversity of the fauna is one of its great attractions: caiman, anacondas, fish, capybaras, tapirs, hyacinth macaws, herons, and jabiru storks, among others. The Pantanal received the recognition as National Patrimony in the Constitution of 1988 and as Patrimony of the Humanity and Reserve of the Biosfera from UNESCO.

According to World Wide Fund for Nature (1999), there exist in the Pantanal 650 species of birds, 80 of mammals, 260 of fish and 50 of reptiles. It is a region of great importance for preservation of biodiversity, considered one of the biggest centers of reproduction of fauna of America. Already more than 263 species of fish, 122 species of mammals, 93 species of reptiles, 1,132 species of butterflies, 656 species of birds and 1,700 species of plants have been cataloged there.

==Relations with Bolivia==
The municipality of Corumbá is bordered simultaneously by Bolivia and Paraguay, a situation that is known as &quot;tríplice&quot; border. Its urban area borders on the Bolivian cities of Puerto Suárez and Puerto Quijarro, which together make up a &quot;Free Zone&quot; for purchases of imported products and Bolivian crafts, the limit of which is the end of Ramon Gomes Road. The border with Paraguay is at the south extremity of the municipality in the agricultural zone. As of 2014, Bolivians are asked to prove if they have over the equivalent of $800 to receive a temporary visa.

As a result, Corumbá has one of the highest proportions of Bolivian-Brazilians of any city. Ethnographic reports have found that Bolivians in the city are regularly subject to racial discrimination.

==Urbanization and demographic information==
Corumbá consists of two areas. The lower area is where the old village of notable architecture lies, close to the port. The upper area, newer and much bigger, is chessboard-shaped. Its architecture is not like other old Brazilian cities, where the predominant architectural style is the colonial romantic Portuguese. Its architecture is Italian neoclassical, the same as central Asunción, the old suburbs of Buenos Aires, the towns of the countryside of the Uruguay, and the majority of the southwestern Rio Grande do Sul.

Its urbanization rate is very high, reaching around 90%. In recent years, due to a better quality of life, the population is aging and the fertility rate is decreasing.

As of the 2010 census, there were 103,772 people living in Corumbá. The racial composition of the city was:

<doc id="1309002" wikidata="Q422689" url="?curid=1309002" title="Lactulose">
<text>Lactulose is a non-absorbable sugar used in the treatment of constipation and hepatic encephalopathy. It is administered orally for constipation, and either orally or rectally for hepatic encephalopathy. It generally begins working after 8–12 hours, but may take up to 2 days to improve constipation.
Common side effects include abdominal bloating and cramps. A potential exists for electrolyte problems as a result of the diarrhea it produces. No evidence of harm to the fetus has been found when used during pregnancy. It is generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding. It is classified as an osmotic laxative.
Lactulose was first made in 1929, and has been used medically since the 1950s. Lactulose is made from the milk sugar lactose, which is composed of two simple sugars, galactose and glucose. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 267th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

===Constipation===
Lactulose is used in the treatment of chronic constipation in patients of all ages as a long-term treatment. The dosage of lactulose for chronic idiopathic constipation is adjusted depending on the constipation severity and desired effect, from a mild stool softener to causing diarrhea. Lactulose is contraindicated in case of galactosemia, as most preparations contain the monosaccharide galactose due to its synthesis process.

Lactulose may be used to counter the constipating effects of opioids, and in the symptomatic treatment of hemorrhoids as a stool softener.

Lactulose is commonly prescribed for children who develop fear of their bowel movements and are withholders. This is because lactulose, when dosed in the proper amount, causes a bowel movement that is impossible to retain for very long. Lactulose is also used for the elderly because of its gentle and consistent results.

===Hyperammonemia===
Lactulose is useful in treating hyperammonemia (high blood ammonia), which can lead to hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose helps trap the ammonia (NH3) in the colon and bind to it. It does this by using gut flora to acidify the colon, transforming the freely diffusible ammonia into ammonium ions (), which can no longer diffuse back into the blood. It is also useful for preventing hyperammonemia caused as a side effect of administration of valproic acid.

===Small intestine bacterial overgrowth===
Lactulose is used as a test of small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Recently, the reliability of it for diagnosing SIBO has been seriously questioned. A large amount of it is given with subsequent testing of molecular hydrogen gas in the breath. The test is positive if an increase in exhaled hydrogen occurs before that which would be expected by normal digestion by the normal gut flora in the colon. An earlier result has been hypothesized to indicate digestion occurring within the small intestine. An alternate explanation for differences in results is the variance in small bowel transit time among tested subjects.

===Pregnancy===
No evidence of harm to the fetus has been found when used during pregnancy. It is generally regarded as safe during breastfeeding.

==Side effects==
Common side effects of lactulose are abdominal cramping, borborygmus, and flatulence. In normal individuals, overdose is considered uncomfortable, but not life-threatening. Uncommon side effects are nausea and vomiting. In sensitive individuals, such as the elderly or people with reduced kidney function, excess lactulose dosage can result in dehydration and electrolyte disturbances such as low magnesium levels. Ingestion of lactulose does not cause a weight gain because it is not digestible, with no nutritional value. Although lactulose is less likely to cause dental caries than sucrose, as a sugar, a potential for this exists, which is relevant when taken by people with a high susceptibility to this condition.

==Mechanism of action==
Lactulose is not absorbed in the small intestine nor broken down by human enzymes, thus stays in the digestive bolus through most of its course, causing retention of water through osmosis leading to softer, easier-to-pass stool. It has a secondary laxative effect in the colon, where it is fermented by the gut flora, producing metabolites which have osmotic powers and peristalsis-stimulating effects (such as acetate), but also methane associated with flatulence.

Lactulose is metabolized in the colon by bacterial flora into short-chain fatty acids, including lactic acid and acetic acid. These partially dissociate, acidifying the colonic contents (increasing the H+ concentration in the gut). This favors the formation of the nonabsorbable from NH3, trapping NH3 in the colon and effectively reducing plasma NH3 concentrations. Lactulose is therefore effective in treating hepatic encephalopathy. Specifically, it is effective as secondary prevention of hepatic encephalopathy in people with cirrhosis. Moreover, research showed improved cognitive functions and health-related quality of life in people with cirrhosis with minimal hepatic encephalopathy treated with lactulose.

== Chemistry ==
Lactulose is a disaccharide formed from one molecule each of the simple sugars (monosaccharides) fructose and galactose. Lactulose is not normally present in raw milk, but is a product of heat processes: the greater the heat, the greater amount of this substance (from 3.5 mg/L in low-temperature pasteurized milk to 744 mg/L in in-container sterilized milk).

Lactulose is produced commercially by isomerization of lactose. A variety of reaction conditions and catalysts can be used.

==Society and culture==

===Name===
Lactulose is its international nonproprietary name (INN). It is sold under various brand names.

===Availability===
Lactulose is available as a generic medication. It is available without prescription in most countries, but a prescription is required in the United States, Philippines, and Austria.

===Food additive===
In some countries where lactulose may be obtained without a prescription, lactulose is commonly used as a food additive to improve taste and promote intestinal transit.

==Veterinary use==
Lactulose is used in veterinary medicine.

<text>Cullen&#x27;s sign, also known as umbilical black eye, is superficial edema and bruising in the subcutaneous fatty tissue around the umbilicus.

It is named for gynecologist Thomas Stephen Cullen (1869–1953), who first described the sign in ruptured ectopic pregnancy in 1916.

This sign takes 24–48 hours to appear and can predict acute pancreatitis, with mortality rising from 8–10% to 40%. It may be accompanied by Grey Turner&#x27;s sign (bruising of the flank), which may then be indicative of pancreatic necrosis with retroperitoneal or intra-abdominal bleeding.

==Causes==
Causes include:
* acute pancreatitis, where methemalbumin formed from digested blood tracks around the abdomen from the inflamed pancreas
* bleeding from blunt abdominal trauma
* bleeding from aortic rupture
* bleeding from ruptured ectopic pregnancy

Importance of the sign is on a decline since better diagnostic modalities are now available.

<doc id="1309012" wikidata="Q416427" url="?curid=1309012" title="Cromoglicic acid">
<text>Cromoglicic acid (INN)—also referred to as cromolyn (USAN), cromoglycate (former BAN), or cromoglicate—is traditionally described as a mast cell stabilizer, and is commonly marketed as the sodium salt sodium cromoglicate or cromolyn sodium. This drug prevents the release of inflammatory chemicals such as histamine from mast cells.

It is considered a breakthrough drug in management of asthma, as the patients can be freed from steroids in many cases; however, it is mainly effective as a prophylaxis for allergic and exercise-induced asthma, not as a treatment for acute asthma attacks.

Cromoglicic acid has been the non-corticosteroid treatment of choice in the treatment of asthma, for which it has largely been replaced by leukotriene receptor antagonists because of their safety and convenience. Cromoglicic acid requires administration four times daily, and does not provide additive benefit in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.

==History==
Cromolyn was discovered in 1965 by Roger Altounyan, a pharmacologist who had asthma. Altounyan was investigating certain plants and herbs which have bronchodilating properties. One such plant was khella (&quot;Ammi visnaga&quot;) which had been used as a muscle relaxant since ancient times in Egypt. Altounyan deliberately inhaled derivatives of the active ingredient khellin to determine if they could block his asthma attacks. After several years of trial, he isolated an effective and safe asthma-preventing compound called cromolyn sodium.

==Preparations==
Cromoglicic acid is available in multiple forms:

* as a nasal spray (Rynacrom (UK), Lomusol (France), Nasalcrom (the only over-the-counter form, US), Prevalin (non-direct version, NL)) to treat allergic rhinitis.
* in a nebulizer solution for aerosol administration to treat asthma.
* as an inhaler (Intal, Fisons Pharmaceuticals, UK) for preventive management of asthma. The maker of Intal, King Pharmaceuticals, has discontinued manufacturing the inhaled form, cromolyn sodium inhalation aerosol, due to issues involving CFC-free propellant. As stocks are depleted, this inhaler preparation will no longer be available to patients. In the EU it is manufactured without CFCs by Sanofi, although it must be imported from Canada or Mexico for USA residents.
* as eye drops (Opticrom and Optrex Allergy (UK), Crolom, Cromolyn (Canada)) for allergic conjunctivitis 
* in an oral form (Gastrocrom, Nalcrom) to treat mastocytosis, mast cell activation syndrome, dermatographic urticaria and ulcerative colitis. Another oral product, Intercron (sodium cromoglicate in distilled water, from Zambon France), is used for food allergies.

==Mechanism of action==
&quot;Cromolyn works because it prevents the release of mediators that would normally attract inflammatory cells and because it stabilizes the inflammatory cells. MCT mast cells found in the mucosa are stabilised.&quot; Nedocromil is another mast cell stabilizer that also works in controlling asthma.
The underlying mechanism of action is not fully understood; for while cromoglicate stabilizes mast cells, this mechanism is probably not why it works in asthma. Pharmaceutical companies have produced 20 related compounds that are equally or more potent at stabilising mast cells and none of them have shown any anti-asthmatic effect. It is more likely that these work by inhibiting the response of sensory C fibers to the irritant capsaicin, inhibiting local axon reflexes involved in asthma, and may inhibit the release of preformed T cell cytokines and mediators involved in asthma.

It is known to somewhat inhibit chloride channels (37% ± 7%) and thus &quot;may&quot; inhibit the:
* exaggerated neuronal reflexes triggered by stimulation of irritant receptors on sensory nerve endings (e.g. exercise-induced asthma)
* release of preformed cytokines from several type of inflammatory cells (T cells, eosinophils) in allergen-induced asthma

Note: Another chemical (NPPB: 5-nitro-2(3-phenyl) propylamino-benzoic acid) was shown, in the same study, to be a more effective chloride channel blocker.

Finally it may act by inhibiting calcium influx.

Cromoglicate is classified as a chromone.

Cromolyn is also being tested as a drug to treat insulin-induced lipoatrophy and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in combination with Ibuprofen. Cromolyn is also known to bind S100P protein and disrupt the interaction with RAGE.

<doc id="1309020" wikidata="Q4791025" url="?curid=1309020" title="Aristoi">
<text>The Aristoi (Greek: ἄριστοι) was the label given to the noblemen in ancient Greek society, and in particular ancient Athens. The term literally means &quot;best&quot;, with the denotation of best in terms of birth, rank, and nobility, but also usually possessing the connotation of also being the morally best. Goldman emphasizes that the notion of &#x27;good work&#x27; has been a persistent theme in defining the ideals of excellence, suggesting that Aristoi were not only leaders but also exemplars of ethical conduct and civic responsibility. The term in fact derives similarly with arete: &quot;The root of the word is the same as &quot;aristos&quot;, the word which shows superlative ability and superiority, and &quot;aristos&quot; was constantly used in the plural to denote the nobility.&quot; 

==History==
Originally, the Aristoi were tightly knit families who had noble lineage, such as the Bacchiadae in ancient Corinth.

In the early 6th century BC, Solon promulgated constitutional reforms in Athens. Among the changes, the status and power of the old aristocracy was altered by making wealth rather than birth a criterion for holding political position. This system was called a Timocracy (Greek: τιμοκρατία).

This division called for a new division. Thus, citizens were organized based on their land production: 
# Pentacosiomedimni (or Pentakosiomedimnoi), who had at least 500 medimnoi of wet or dry goods (or their equivalent) as yearly income
# Hippeis, who had at least 300 medimnoi (or their equivalent) as yearly income
# Zeugitae, who were possessors of a yoke of oxen, with at least 150 medimnoi (or their equivalent) as yearly income
# Thetes, who were workers for wages, or had less than 150 medimnoi (or their equivalent) as yearly income

This new system established the pentakosiomedimnoi as the aristoi. As such, they were often split into powerful family factions or clans, who controlled all of the important political positions in the polis. Their wealth usually came from both having property the most fertile or protected lands. However, as the status was predicated on his wealth, and losing it would cause the loss of nobility, the advent of sea trade routes placed the aristoi at risk of losing everything through failed overseas investments.

Pittacus of Mytilene instituted a law stating that crimes committed in drunkenness should be punished twofold; this law was directed predominantly against the aristocrats, as they were more often guilty of drunk and violent behaviour. As such, it was greatly appreciated by the common people.

===Customs===
In Classical Athens, Thucydides testifies concerning the customs of both citizens and of the rich. He writes that no one bears weapons within the &quot;polis&quot;, as it permits &quot;an easier and more luxurious mode of life&quot;. Where the archaic aristocracy used to carry weapons on their person in the city, the practice was completely abandoned due to cultural shifts. Among the causes were legal changes; an example was the forbidding of people to bear arms in the &quot;agora&quot; under the penalty of death. The iconography of vases bear witness to this change depicting the transition from men carrying swords, then spears, then staffs, then – for a brief period of time – parasols, to eventually nothing. They even considered various reasons behind this transformation. Among the causes were legal reforms, such as banning weapons in the agora under threat of death.

Thucydides also speaks of how the Aristoi took cultural cues from the orient, such as &quot;the luxury of wearing undergarments of linen, and fastening a knot of their hair with a tie of golden grasshoppers.&quot; This went out of fashion after the Athenian elite began to mimic the Lacedaemonians, wearing more modest garments in order &quot;to assimilate their way of life to that of the common people&quot;.

The information in Athens, where elites began adopting more modest behaviors and styles was influence by broader civilizing trends. For example, the aristocratic adoption of Spartan simplicity reflects a deliberate effort that will align with the democratic values. This shift wasn&#x27;t just about aesthetics but also signified a moral and political commitment to a shared civic identity.

==Influences==
The Aristoi Classical Academy, formerly West Houston Charter School, takes its name from the concept.

<text>Sai Yok (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) in Kanchanaburi province in western Thailand.

== Geography ==
The district is in the valley of the Khwae Noi River in the Tenasserim Hills area. It borders Myanmar to the south. Along the river the Death Railway runs to Nam Tok Sai Yok Noi.

Sai Yok National Park was created on 27 October 1980 and covers an area of about 500 km2. The most famous sight in the park is the Sai Yok waterfall.

Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Thong Pha Phum, Si Sawat, Mueang Kanchanaburi of Kanchanaburi Province and Tanintharyi Division of Myanmar.

== Sights ==
Apart from the nature of the Kwae Noi River valley, the other main attraction is Mueang Sing Historical Park, which shows the westernmost Khmer-style temple complex. Also popular for tourists is the Tiger Temple.

== Administration ==

=== Central administration ===
Sai Yok is divided into seven sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 57 administrative villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

=== Local administration ===
There are three sub-district municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambons&quot;) in the district:
* Nam Tok Sai Yok Noi (Thai: ) consisting of parts of sub-district Tha Sao.
* Wang Pho (Thai: ) consisting of parts of sub-district Lum Sum.
* Sai Yok (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Sai Yok.

There are six sub-district administrative organizations (SAO) in the district:
* Lum Sum (Thai: ) consisting of parts of sub-district Lum Sum.
* Tha Sao (Thai: ) consisting of parts of sub-district Tha Sao.
* Sing (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Sing.
* Wang Krachae (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Wang Krachae.
* Si Mongkhon (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Si Mongkhon.
* Bongti (Thai: ) consisting of sub-district Bongti.

==Popular culture==
* Sai Yok was the location of shooting the Vietnam scenes of the 1978 film &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;.
* Sai Yok was mentioned in the song &quot;Mon Sai Yok&quot; (มนต์ไทรโยค - &quot;Magic Of Sai Yok&quot;) by the Thai pop rock band The Innocent from an album &quot;Yu Hor&quot; (อยู่หอ - Stay Dorm) in 1982. The song is about a delightful time in Sai Yok.

==Exhibition programming==
The exhibition was officially opened in the presence of about two thousand people by André Breton. The average attendance for the entire run of the Exhibition was about a thousand people per day.

Over the course of the Exhibition, the following lectures were delivered to large audiences:

* 16 June – André Breton – Limites non-frontières du Surréalisme.
* 19 June – Herbert Read – Art and the Unconscious.
* 24 June – Paul Éluard – La Poésie surréaliste.
* 26 June – Hugh Sykes Davies – Biology and Surrealism.
* 1 July – Salvador Dalí – Fantômes paranoïaques authentiques.

The most iconic image of the exhibition is the opening day performance of Sheila Legge, who stood in the middle of Trafalgar Square, posing in a white, drop tail hemmed wedding dress ensemble inspired by a Salvador Dalí painting, with her head completely obscured by a flower arrangement. In one variation of the images capturing her performance, pigeons are perched on her outstretched, gloved arms.

Dalí&#x27;s lecture was delivered whilst wearing a deep-sea diving suit. Nearly suffocating during the presentation, Dalí had to be rescued by the young poet David Gascoyne, who arrived with a spanner to release him from the diving helmet. During the exhibition, Welsh poet Dylan Thomas carried around a cup of boiled string, asking visitors would they rather it &quot;weak or strong?&quot;

The exhibition&#x27;s catalog (and guide) was printed by the Women&#x27;s Printing Society, a British publishing house dedicated to employing women.

<doc id="1309050" wikidata="Q2455332" url="?curid=1309050" title="Battle of Ginchy">
<text>The Battle of Ginchy took place on 9 September 1916 during the Battle of the Somme, when the 16th (Irish) Division captured the German-held village. Ginchy is north-east of Guillemont, at the junction of six roads, on a rise overlooking Combles, to the south-east. After the conclusion of the Battle of Guillemont on 6 September, XIV Corps and XV Corps were required to complete the advance to positions which would give observation over the German third position. The advance was to make ready for a general attack in mid-September, for which the Anglo-French armies had been preparing since early August.

British attacks northwards from the boundary between the Fourth Army and the French Sixth Army, from Leuze Wood north to Ginchy, had begun on 3 September when the 7th Division captured the village, before being forced out by a German counter-attack. Attacks on Leuze Wood and attempts to re-take Ginchy on 4 and 5 September were also defeated by German counter-attacks. The 7th Division was relieved by the 16th (Irish) Division and 55th (West Lancashire) Division on the evening of 7 September and the 5th Division was replaced by the 56th (1/1st London) Division on the right at the boundary with the French.

On 9 September the British began a bombardment early in the morning but waited until late afternoon to advance, to deny the Germans time to counter-attack before dark. The British assault in the south by the 56th (1/1st London) Division and the 16th (Irish) Division reached Bouleaux Wood but the attack in the centre was repulsed. On the northern flank, Ginchy was captured by the 16th (Irish) Division and several German counter-attacks were defeated. The loss of Ginchy deprived the Germans of observation posts from which they could observe the battlefield. The success eliminated the salient at Delville Wood, which had been costly to defend, due to observed German artillery-fire from three sides and the many counter-attacks by German infantry in July and August; the attack on 31 August, being the largest mounted by the Germans against the British during the battle.

The success of the attack by the French Sixth Army on 12 September, in its biggest operation of the battle and the advance of the right flank of the British Fourth Army from 3 to 9 September, enabled both armies to make much bigger attacks. The assaults were sequenced with attacks by the Tenth and Reserve armies in September, which captured much more ground and inflicted approximately on the German defenders. Anglo-French attempts to co-ordinate their attacks had failed from July to early September, due to a combination of disagreements between Haig, Joffre and Foch over tactics, supply difficulties, devastated terrain, inclement weather and the increasing defensive power of the German armies. In September, the Allies managed to co-ordinate their attacks; advances on each army front made adjacent German positions vulnerable, which were attacked promptly by the neighbouring army before the Germans recovered from their disorganisation.
==Background==

===Tactical developments===
After the capture of of the German second position on Bazentin Ridge by the British on 14 July, the Germans had reinforced the flanks of the captured ground and built more fortifications between the second and third positions. On the right flank the British line formed a salient at Longueval and Delville Wood, which ran west to Pozières and south to Maltz Horn Farm, the junction with the French Sixth Army. The salient was overlooked by German positions from Guillemont to the south-east and High Wood to the north-west. Control of Guillemont and Ginchy also gave the Germans observation of the ground to the south, over the French approaches to the German second line, from the Somme river north to Maurepas and the area between Malz Horn Farm and Falfemont Farm.

German artillery could fire into the salient and the area beyond, where a huge mass of Allied artillery was based and through which the fronts of the Fourth and French Sixth armies were supplied over a small number of poor roads. In August, Joffre had pressed Haig to continue with big attacks on wide fronts but despite conforming to French strategy, Haig had refused to follow these tactics until the British Armies were ready, being unwilling to risk another fiasco like the attacks of 22/23 July. The British made a large number of small, narrow-front attacks, consistent with the state of training and supply of the British divisions, intended to approximate wide-front attacks, while concentrating artillery firepower opposite Guillemont, on the right flank of the Fourth Army. From late July to early September, many attacks took place to establish the British right flank on Guillemont and Ginchy, ready for a big attack combined with the French Sixth Army and the Reserve Army in mid-September.

Publication of German casualty statistics for July 1916, showed that seven of the twelve divisions engaged by the British in July, had lost more than 50 per cent of their infantry, which increased optimism at British Expeditionary Force (BEF) General Headquarters (GHQ), that the German defence of the Somme front was weakening. GHQ Intelligence made a guess of casualties, while Lieutenant-General George Macdonogh, Director of Military Intelligence at the War Office in London, estimated the French losses. The Bavarian divisions south of the Albert–Bapaume road were assessed to have high morale despite &quot;heavy losses&quot; but it was believed that there were no more than five German divisions left in reserve on the Western Front. (British spy networks in northern France and Flanders had been blown in June 1916, which left the Secret Service and GHQ Intelligence ignorant of German troop movements in the area.)

A general relief of the German divisions on the Somme was known to have been completed in late August and the assessment of German divisions available as reinforcements was increased to eight. GHQ Intelligence considered a German division on the British front was worn-out after days, even though German divisions averaged twenty days in the line. Of six more German divisions moved to the Somme by 28 August, only two had been known to be in reserve and the other four had been moved from quiet sectors without warning. News of the dismissal of Falkenhayn reached the British on 30 August and it was taken by military intelligence to foreshadow increased German emphasis on the Eastern Front, which would make the German armies in France vulnerable. The &quot;wearing-out&quot; battles since late July and events elsewhere, led to a belief that the big Allied attack planned for mid-September could have decisive effect.

==Prelude==

===British preparations===
The Anglo-French attacks of late July and August had been intended to advance through the un-captured part of the German second position, to Falfemont Farm, Guillemont and Leuze Wood, preparatory to the capture of Ginchy and Bouleaux Wood. The British and French armies were to co-operate to capture the high ground either side of the Combles valley and the French Sixth Army to reach Maurepas, Le Forest, Rancourt and Frégicourt. Fighting to the west of Ginchy at Longueval and Delville Wood had begun on 14 July and continued until 3 September, when all but the eastern corner was captured. The area between the wood and Ginchy, known to the German defenders as the (Duck&#x27;s Bill) dominated the approaches to the village. An attack from west needed the support of a simultaneous attack northwards on the , to prevent the Germans defeating the attack with enfilade fire and arrangements for the big offensive planned for mid-September continued.

Attacks by XV Corps and III Corps on Delville Wood and High Wood took place during the XIV Corps operations to capture Ginchy. The attacks added to the strain on British engineer services, pioneer, labour and transport units and was made worse by German bombardments, directed from the vantage points still in German possession. In the aftermath of the last attack of the Battle of Guillemont (3 to 6 September), in the XIV Corps area, the 56th (1/1st London) Division relieved the right of the 168th Brigade with the 169th Brigade, from the boundary with the French Sixth Army at the Combles ravine to the southern portion of Leuze Wood. The 168th Brigade sidestepped left to take over part of the line held by the 49th Brigade of the 16th (Irish) Division and an advanced trench dug near Leuze Wood was abandoned. At on 8 September, the 56th (1/1st London) Division attacked down Combles Trench from Leuze Wood, advancing a short distance before a German counter-attack at on 9 September bombed them back to the wood.

===British plan===
The 22nd Brigade, 7th Division had been withdrawn for only two days, before being sent forward again for the attack on Ginchy. The ground had been torn by shell-fire and made muddy by rain, as the brigade took over the south end of Edge Trench and Devil&#x27;s Trench in Delville Wood on the left, Stout and Porter trenches on the right facing Ginchy, with a battalion in support in Montauban Alley and a battalion in reserve in Pommiers Trench. A noon attack was planned to mislead the Germans.

On 6 September, a new attack was ordered with XIV Corps to advance to a line from Combles to Leuze Wood road, the Quadrilateral and Ginchy. The 55th Division to the north in the XV Corps area was to support the attack on Ginchy by attacking with the 164th Brigade, between the outskirts of the village and the eastern edge of Delville Wood. The advance was then to continue to Hop Alley and Ale Alley, then from Pint Trench to Lager Lane on the road from Ginchy to Flers; III Corps was to take Wood Lane and the east corner of High Wood. A bombardment was to begin on 9 September at , with no increase in intensity before zero at , to deceive the Germans as to the time of the attack and to deny them an opportunity to counter-attack before dark. 

The French Sixth Army attack as part of the joint plan to isolate Combles further south, also scheduled for 9 September was postponed on 8 September to 12 September due to supply difficulties. On the 56th (1/1st London) Division front, between the Combles ravine and the boundary with the 16th (Irish) Division on the Combles–Guillemont road, the attack of 9 September was to be made behind a creeping barrage from half of the divisional artillery, moving at per minute. As the creeping barrage met a standing barrage fired by the other half of the divisional artillery on each barrage line successively, the standing barrage would jump ahead to the next objective.

===German preparations===

The many British &quot;nibbling&quot; attacks after 14 July had been costly to contain, as German defences had been under frequent artillery bombardment, which had turned German positions into crater-fields, buried the entrances of dug-outs, vaporised barbed-wire and demolished trenches. Allied air superiority and artillery dominated the battlefield and kept the German defenders under constant strain and caused many casualties, the most notable being Falkenhayn who was sacked on 28 August and replaced by Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who scrapped Falkenhayn&#x27;s policy of rigid defence and automatic counter-attacks.

German field fortifications had evolved since July from a trench-system into an outpost line in shell-holes, with supports and reserves further back in shell-holes or any cover that could be found. The outpost line, containing two or three soldiers every and the occasional machine-gun was often overrun, after which similar shell-hole positions were improvised by the British before a German counter-attack could be mounted. The hasty German counter-attack () was forestalled and the remedy of a well-prepared methodical counter-attack () was rarely mounted because of the chronic shortage of infantry, artillery and ammunition.

Attempts to link shell-hole positions failed, because they were visible from the air and British reconnaissance aircraft directed artillery onto them. Trenches were abandoned during an attack in preference for shell-holes further forward. Unobtrusive positions were much harder for British air observers to spot and much more artillery ammunition was needed to bombard areas which were thought to contain them. Trench-lines retained their value as rallying points and accommodation and new ones were built according to the defensive lessons of the (Second Battle of Champagne 25 September to 6 November 1915). Back-lines and switch-trenches were dug, as soon as manpower was available, on reverse slopes with artillery observation posts moved further back. In early September, the relief of the defenders of Ginchy by Bavarian Infantry Regiment 19 was rushed, giving the regiment no time to study the ground. By mistake, the boundary between the 5th Bavarian Division and the 185th Division was placed in the village, dividing responsibility for its defence, which was made worse by some of the soldiers in the 185th Division being retrained gunners with little infantry experience.

==Battle==

===French Sixth and Tenth armies===
The Sixth Army attacked north of the Somme at noon on 3 September, capturing most of Cléry, the German position along the Cléry to Le Forêt road and all of the village of Le Forêt. On the left I Corps occupied high ground south of Combles and entered Bois Douage, taking and twelve guns. The Tenth Army attacked on the south bank on 4 September, from Chilly to Barleux and took Chilly and Soyécourt after three days of attacks but failed to capture Vermandovillers, Derniécourt and Barleux.

The Sixth Army attacked on the north bank with VII Corps, which advanced on the left and made more gains around Cléry. To the north, the Germans counter-attacked in the Combles ravine, stopping the French advance towards Rancourt. When the British took Falfemont Farm on 5 September, the French gained touch at the Combles ravine and patrols captured Ferme de l&#x27;Hôpital, east of Le Forêt. The rest of Cléry was taken by VII Corps and XXXIII Corps, which had taken Omniécourt on the south bank of the Somme, was met on the right flank. An attack by I Corps, on the boundary with the British Fourth Army on 6 September was repulsed.
On 12 September, XXXIII Corps attacked towards Mont St Quentin and VII Corps attacked Bouchavesnes, taking the village and digging in facing Cléry and Feuillaucourt. I Corps took Bois d&#x27;Anderlu and broke through the German defences near Marrières Wood, before attacking north towards Rancourt and Sailly-Saillisel. On 13 September, I Corps closed on Le Priez Farm and VII Corps defeated several big German counter-attacks. Next day the attacks of VII and XXXIII corps were stopped by mud and German defensive fire.

I Corps managed to take Le Priez Farm. Attacks were suspended again to bring up supplies and relieve tired troops, despite the big British attack due on 15 September. Frégicourt, which overlooked part of the area to be attacked by the British was still held by the Germans. Although Foch wanted to keep pressure on the Germans south of the river, supply priority was given to the Sixth Army; the Tenth Army met frequent German counter-attacks near Berny, which took some ground and was not able to resume its attacks.

===Fourth Army===
British attacks on Ginchy began on 3 September in the XV Corps area, when the 22nd Brigade of the 7th Division advanced eastwards, on a line from Waterlot Farm north to Delville Wood on the Guillemont–Longueval road, the objective being Ginchy Telegraph, site of an old semaphore station on the highest ground east of the village. The ground over which the attack was to pass was overlooked by Ale Alley and Hop Alley, German positions at the east end of Delville Wood. Bombers from the 91st Brigade and part of the 22nd Brigade attacked the German positions on the northern flank five minutes before zero, with support from a 24th Division battalion on the left. The British bombardment increased at and at became intense.

A creeping barrage was arranged to begin at zero hour (noon) and dwell for five minutes, so that the infantry could close up to the German front line away, then creep forward in three lifts through Ginchy. The bombers advanced towards Hop Alley at but smoke from their &quot;fumite&quot; grenades alerted the Germans and the 24th Division battalion attacked late, after it received contradictory orders. The eastern edge of Delville Wood up to Hop Alley was captured but the German defenders pinned down the rest of the attacking force, when it tried to advance by moving in the open and by bombing along trenches.

At noon the main attack began and the right-hand battalion advanced into the south of Ginchy out of view, as the left-hand battalion was caught in flanking fire by the German machine-guns in Ale Alley. Part of the battalion got into the north end of Ginchy and also disappeared, while the rest occupied the southern part of Beer Trench or dug in short of Hop Alley. A supporting company got a few men into the orchards north-west of Ginchy and were joined by part of another battalion, originally intended to occupy Ale Alley as a defensive flank. On the right flank it was reported at that the far side of the village had been reached and the eastern and south-eastern outskirts were being consolidated.

Germans in the north end of the village then worked round the open left flank and counter-attacked, pushing the survivors back to Porter Trench, except for a party which held on to a position on the Guillemont road, at the boundary with XIV Corps. A new attack at on the northern flank, from Pilsen Lane against Hop Alley was ordered at and extended south to recapture Ginchy, when it was seen to have been lost. The attack in the north failed, apart from some troops reaching the left side of Hop Alley and that on Ginchy was stopped by artillery and machine-gun fire at Stout and Porter trenches, where the survivors of the original attack were holding on.
Heavy and accurate German artillery-fire had begun twenty minutes after zero hour and cut communication with the attacking battalions. Contact aircraft reported seeing flares in the village but received no response when more flares were called for. The 7th Division called on corps headquarters for another bombardment by heavy artillery at and the divisional commander Major-General Herbert Watts, requested the use of the 20th Brigade for another attack.

Lieutenant-General Henry Horne, the corps commander referred this to Fourth Army headquarters, because the brigade was being conserved for the big attack planned for mid-September. Eventually the 20th Brigade was committed to hold the line and the 22nd Brigade ordered to attack again, despite its losses and disorganisation, until a patrol revealed that the Germans had infiltrated a large number of infantry in the village. The attack was cancelled and the 20th Brigade moved up by lorry to Mametz, to take over from Stout and Porter trenches to Delville Wood, ready to reinforce troops in Ginchy or to wait until morning to renew the attack, the attempt eventually taking place next day at 

The 20th Brigade attackers quickly occupied Ginchy, came under massed shrapnel-shell and machine-gun fire and was soon pushed back to ZZ, Porter and Stout trenches, west and south-west of the outskirts. The corps commander postponed another attack until 5 September, when a surprise attack was to be attempted. Further north the attack from Delville Wood began at but made no progress beyond Ale Alley and Hop Alley; a later attempt on Hop Alley from Pilsen Lane also failed, the troops being pinned down in shell-holes until dusk. The 20th Brigade attack intended for 5 September was postponed, due to the state of the ground and disorganisation in the front line. Survivors from the 22nd Brigade reported that the village was held mainly by machine-gunners and recommended a night attack, for which a preliminary attack on the eastern fringe of Delville Wood, was made in the late afternoon. The attack reached the edge of the wood to a point north of Hop Alley, despite continuous German artillery-fire. In the early morning of 6 September, another attack on Ginchy began but lost direction in the dark.
A second attack was made at Despite deep mud the attackers reached the western outskirts of the village, before being stopped by German machine-gun fire at close range, from hides in the débris of the village. Attacks between Ginchy and Delville Wood pushed forward from Pilsen Lane, where some of the advanced parties were then pushed back by a counter-attack from Ginchy. After another bombardment at the British attacked from the Guillemont–Ginchy road, behind a creeping barrage and reached the village, taking a number of prisoners, before being cut off by a German counter-barrage, attacked at and pushed back to the original front line. The 7th Division commander reported that the division was incapable of another effort and no attack on Ginchy was made on 7 September. An attempt was made to capture the last part of Delville Wood, behind a rifle-grenade barrage which was repulsed.

On the right of XIV Corps, the 56th (1/1st London) Division attacked on 9 September at A battalion of the 169th Brigade advanced from the south-east of Leuze Wood towards Loop Trench, to establish a defensive flank along the Combles ravine. German artillery and machine-gun fire forced the battalion back; another battalion was sent forward as reinforcements but took until to find its way through German artillery-fire and the dark. A battalion attacking from inside Leuze Wood, managed to capture the main German line beyond the sunken road into Combles at Bouleaux Wood, then advance north-west to the Guillemont–Morval road, south-east of the Quadrilateral and dig in.

The 168th Brigade advanced to the north-east, from south of the Leuze Wood–Guillemont road by pivoting on its right flank, intending to reach the German line from Leuze Wood to the Quadrilateral. The right-hand battalion hugged the barrage and reached its first objective easily about forward, despite small-arms raking the left flank battalion and only the company on the right reaching its first objective on the Leuze Wood–Ginchy road. The battalion on the right advanced again, when the barrage began to move forward at to the final objective, at the German trench from the Quadrilateral to Bouleaux Wood. Despite many losses the objective was reached and consolidated, touch being gained with the left of the 169th Brigade and patrols pushed forward towards Morval. Small parties of German infantry were engaged by Lewis-gun fire in the gloom and driven off.
The left battalion was pinned-down by fire from German positions south-east of Ginchy and the advance to the Quadrilateral stopped. Air reconnaissance of the Quadrilateral which lay in dead ground, had shown that its outer belt of barbed-wire had been cut by the British artillery but not wire covered by long grass for behind. A second attempt lost direction and veered to the right, as German artillery-fire and a thick mist at sunset cut off the attacking troops from communication to the rear. Troops had been brought forward to form a defensive flank on the left and after dark a battalion was sent to link the line left from the Quadrilateral, erroneously believed to have been captured, to Ginchy where troops of the 16th (Irish) Division were thought to be. The advance began at but also got lost in the dark and mist. The German defence collapsed into confusion, with one party attacking the British from behind. As dawn broke some of the battalion found that they were at the trench south-east of the Quadrilateral.

The two 16th (Irish) Division brigades began the attack tired and worn down, after earlier attacks while attached to the 5th Division and 20th Division. The two attacking battalions of the 47th Brigade on the right flank were held back for two minutes after zero hour for a final hurricane bombardment. The 48th Brigade on the left attacked on schedule, which brought down a German counter-barrage. The battalions of the 47th Brigade were stopped by close-range machine-gun fire, most of the British bombardment having fallen on the German second line. Further attempts to advance with reinforcements also failed. North of the 47th Brigade, the battalion on the right side of the 48th Brigade was also stopped but wheeled, forced back the Germans in the vicinity and pressed on. The brigade advanced either side of the Guillemont–Ginchy road, against slight opposition and reached the first objective along Hans Crescent, on the western outskirts of Ginchy at Two battalions leap-frogged through at and took the village and prisoners, the rest withdrawing towards Flers and Lesbœufs.

Some of the Irish pursued the Germans, until they were recalled, to consolidate a defensive line around the eastern outskirts of Ginchy. Engineer field companies built a strongpoint on the road to Lesbœufs and one at the XIV Corps–XV Corps boundary on the Delville Wood road. On the right of XV Corps, an attack by 164th Brigade of the 55th Division captured the east end of Delville Wood and took Hop and Ale alleys but failed to hold them against German artillery and machine-gun fire. A camouflaged trench had been taken to be the objective for a few moments, causing a delay which proved &quot;disastrous&quot;. After advancing to within of Hop Alley, the few survivors withdrew to Pilsen Lane. Several German counter-attacks were made in the evening and repulsed.

===Air operations===

On the evening of 6 July, German troops were spotted moving into Ginchy, by a 9 Squadron observer and were machine-gunned but a call for artillery-fire went unanswered. Later on more troops were seen and engaged by artillery, prisoners later stating that a battalion lost half its men. On 22 July, 9 Squadron observers reported that new digging was seen around Ginchy, part of a line of entrenchments from Combles to Gueudecourt. On 18 August, British artillery-fire was directed on Ginchy, again by 9 Squadron. On 3 September a reconnaissance flight by 3 Squadron over Ginchy reported no great mass of German infantry, the aeroplane was not fired on and huddled bodies were taken to be German dead.

Another aircraft flight took place during the attack and observed British infantry enter the village at then saw the advance move through the centre of Ginchy towards the eastern edge. German troops north of the village and more troops moving down Lager Lane were machine-gunned by the aircraft, which also called for artillery-fire by wireless and observed the shells falling on the German positions. At British troops were still visible at the east end of Ginchy but the German troops seen earlier managed to counter-attack at , despite the British artillery-fire and recapture the village up to the western outskirts. On 9 September the final attack on Ginchy began in a haze in the late afternoon, with three aircraft of 9 Squadron on contact-patrol over the area, which reported the progress of the attack.

===German 1st Army===
The 4th Bavarian Division moved its left boundary to the Longueval–Flers road and the 56th (1/1st London) Division withdrew Infantry Regiment 88 (IR 88) into reserve, which became available to reinforce Fusilier Regiment 35 (FR 35) in Ginchy, which held the western edge of the village with I Battalion FR 35 and part of I Battalion, IR 88, until forced back by the British attack on 3 September. Parts of both battalions counter-attacked from Pint Trench at as parts of I Battalion, IR 88 and III battalion, F R 35 advanced slowly through the south of the village to the south-eastern corner. Elements of both regiments attacked again at and after hand-to-hand fighting recaptured the rest of the village but were not able to link with IR 76 to the south-west, which had been forced out of Guillemont.

A British attack at was repulsed by small-arms fire, after signals to the German artillery went unanswered and I Battalion, F R 35 had many casualties defending Delville Wood to the west. On 6 September, the British attack got into Ginchy and took a number of prisoners, before being forced back out by a counter-attack at by III Battalion, I R 88 and I Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 104 (RIR 104) of the 24th Reserve Division, which had arrived as a reinforcement. Next day was relatively quiet and the 5th Bavarian Division began to relieve the 56th (1/1st London) Division, Bavarian Infantry Regiment 19 (BIR 19) taking over the defence of Ginchy amid considerable confusion caused by ignorance of the situation in the village, which had disappeared due to the effect of constant bombardment.

On 8 September, the men of I Battalion, I R 88 at the (Duck&#x27;s Bill), a former meadow in the area between Delville Wood and Ginchy, were subjected to (drumfire) which sent plumes of mud high into the air. Digging-in deeper revealed British corpses, whose decomposition fouled the atmosphere; British bodies were thrown forward of the German defences and German ones thrown into shell-holes behind. South-west of Ginchy, the 111th Division had been relieved by the 185th Division of the XII Reserve Corps on on the left of the 5th Bavarian Division. Loop Trench was defended by III Battalion, RIR 28 which was reinforced by part of the II Battalion and I Battalion, IR 65 (in line to the south, defending Combles). Part of III Battalion was overrun in Leuze and Bouleaux woods, which was reinforced by part of I Battalion, RIR 28 and some ground was recaptured; contact with Infantry Regiment 161 (IR 161) towards Ginchy was lost temporarily. The left flank of IR 161 had been &quot;demolished&quot; by the British attack and reinforcements from IR 65, were only able to reach the railway north-west of Bouleaux Wood.

The area from Ginchy to Delville Wood was held by the 5th Bavarian Division, with I Battalion, BIR 19 from Ginchy to trenches west to Delville Wood and II Battalion, BIR 19 in support; touch with the 185th Division was maintained by patrols. The left of I Battalion, south-east of Ginchy held its ground, although contact with the rear was lost. Opposite Delville Wood, the British attack was defeated but a company in Ginchy was rolled up from the south and part of II Battalion was also pushed back. Attempts by the II Battalion to counter-attack from north of the village at failed, the troops getting lost in the dark during the second attack. Next day at the III Battalion, BIR 19 counter-attacked along the Ginchy–Lesbœufs road into a &quot;terrible bombardment&quot; and was stopped short of Ginchy. A report took until nightfall to reach the battalion headquarters. III Battalion, BIR 19 then counter-attacked again into massed artillery and machine-gun fire; part of the battalion penetrated Ginchy, where they were overwhelmed.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

Crown Prince Rupprecht wrote later that the confusion in Ginchy had been caused by two divisions having responsibility for the defence of the village. The hurried relief of the defenders and lack of organisation at the divisional boundary, enabled a British battalion to find its way in small groups through a gap between German units and get round the flank of the 5th Bavarian Division, forcing it to withdraw. Counter-attacks were said to have failed, because the English (sic) had defended Ginchy with few men but many machine-guns, dug-in around the fringes of the village, which stopped the German counter-attacks short of the village. A final attempt failed on 11 September, leaving Bavarian Infantry Regiment 19 with losses of . Franco-British attacks in September caused a crisis in the German defence and by many German infantry units were at the end of their endurance.

It had taken the Fourth Army from to advance on a front and cost but capture of the ground north of Ginchy gained the British another of the crest from Leuze Wood to Delville Wood, which overlooked the German third position for , from Delville Wood to Mouquet Farm. On 11 September, Gallwitz wrote that if the process continued, Germany would run out of men and equipment and that the British heavy guns were destroying the German artillery. The 4th Bavarian Division at Flers, reported that the loss of Ginchy exposed the area from Flers to Martinpuich to attack. British and French prisoners had said that in the recent attacks, German artillery-fire had begun too late and that attacks had caught Germans while they were still under cover in dugouts and also managed to overrun troops further back, held ready to counter-attack.

Prior &amp; Wilson wrote that Guillemont had eventually been captured, using improved tactics but that the 7th Division attacked Ginchy with insufficient weight, seeking to keep troops fresh for the big offensive planned for mid-September. Insufficient attention was paid to mopping-up captured ground, German troops hiding in village cellars were overlooked and the artillery failed to suppress German machine-gunners firing from the flanks. The same form of attack was repeated until the 7th Division was relieved by the 16th (Irish) Division, which moved into line just as the weather deteriorated and rain turned the ground to mud. It was possible to attack Ginchy from the south once Guillemont had fallen and six battalions (albeit tired and depleted by losses) attacked instead of two in previous attacks. A stroke of ill-luck left the Germans in Ginchy unsupported, when the Irish attacked with twice as much field artillery than the previous attacks and took the village in two hours.
In the 7th Division history, Charles Atkinson, called the attacks on Ginchy most unsatisfactory, despite having plenty of artillery and ammunition in support. The fighting in Delville Wood in the aftermath of the big German counter-attack of 31 August had depleted the division; some of the lost ground in the wood had not been recaptured, which left the Germans well placed to enfilade attacks towards Ginchy from the west and north. Atkinson claimed that fighting for the village covered the left flank of the troops further south attacking Guillemont and absorbed German reinforcements in the area. The 7th Division had been used in &quot;driblets&quot;, when a co-ordinated attack on a broader front may have succeeded. There had been insufficient time to rest troops, who were poorly trained, led by inexperienced NCOs and the &quot;musketry&quot; of many of the men from recent drafts was inadequate.

J. P. Harris described British efforts between 15 July and 14 September, a &quot;dissolution&quot; and that the large number of piecemeal attacks demonstrate a failure of command, primarily by Haig. He suggested that the British could have established an army group level of command, similar to those in the French and German armies. Despite criticism of British methods and results, Harris noted that things were worse for the Germans, who were deluged by British artillery, directed by &quot;ubiquitous&quot; Royal Flying Corps (RFC) observers overhead. German troops made seventy counter-attacks against ninety British attacks from , most of which were costly failures, were too frequent and wasted troops on insignificant objectives.

Jack Sheldon wrote in 2005, that the defence of Ginchy had driven some of the best German regiments close to collapse. The commander of the 10th Company, Infantry Regiment 88 wrote a report to the battalion commander on 5 September, that if the company was not withdrawn, he could not answer for the consequences. The report was endorsed and forwarded by the battalion commander but the company was required to counter-attack at Ginchy on 6 September, before being relieved. In contrast to the criticism from Joffre and Foch at the time and by writers and historians since, that the British in this period conducted too many narrow-front attacks, which conceded a tactical advantage to the Germans, Dudley Ward in the 56th (1/1st London) Division history, noted that broad-front attacks were futile when delivered with insufficient weight, since troops edged away from return fire and moved through gaps in defences, bypassing German infantry who could cut them off from reinforcements and supplies.

===Casualties===

From Bavarian Infantry Regiment 19 lost in the defence of Ginchy. The 16th Irish Division suffered from 1 to 10 September and was transferred to the Second Army in Flanders. From 23 August to its relief on 7 September, the 7th Division suffered The 24th Division had suffered approximately since the end of August.

===Subsequent operations===

Attacks were made from the Guillemont–Combles and the Guillemont–Ginchy roads to reach the Quadrilateral, a rectangular trench on a sunken part of the Ginchy–Morval road, which was one of the preliminary objectives of the Fourth Army, before the big offensive planned for 15 September. The 16th (Irish) Division was relieved by the Guards Division on the night of 9/10 September, from the edge of Leuze Wood along the Ginchy road to Ginchy, as the British hold on Ginchy was consolidated. Next day the 56th (1/1st London) Division attacked south-east from Leuze Wood at but was stopped by machine-gun fire from Loop Trench and the sunken road into Combles; a second attempt at also failed. Operations began to capture Ginchy Telegraph and the Quadrilateral on the Ginchy–Morval road, at the top of the Ginchy–Morval spur. An attempt to bomb up to the Quadrilateral from Bouleaux Wood also failed in the face of German machine-gun fire. A brigade from the 5th Division began to relieve units of the 56th (1/1st London) Division and the Guards Division defeated German attempts to re-capture Ginchy.

Ginchy Telegraph was attacked by the Guards Division on 12 September at along the Morval road, as the 56th (1/1st London) Division attacked towards the Quadrilateral again and the 6th Division began to relieve the left flank of the 56th (1/1st London) and right flank of the Guards divisions. Next day the 6th Division had taken over from Leuze Wood to the edge of Ginchy and attacked the Quadrilateral from the south-west, reaching the Leuze Wood–Ginchy road before being held up by machine-gun fire. A second attempt at failed with in the two attacking battalions. An attack by the Guards at the north end of Ginchy straightened the line and an attack after dark was made on German machine-gun nests along the road to Morval. On 14 September a battalion of the 56th (1/1st London) Division dug assembly trenches south of Leuze Wood parallel to Combles Trench, preparatory to the Battle of Flers-Courcelette (15 to 22 September). The Quadrilateral was captured by the 6th Division on 18 September.

<text>Andrew James Clutterbuck (born 14 September 1973), known professionally as Andrew Lincoln, is an English actor. His first major role was as the character Egg in the BBC drama &quot;This Life&quot; (1996–1997). Lincoln later portrayed Simon Casey in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Teachers&quot; (2001–2003), Mark in the Christmas-themed romantic comedy film &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003) and Dr. Robert Bridge in the ITV television series &quot;Afterlife&quot; (2005–2006).

Beginning in 2010, Lincoln gained recognition for his portrayal of Rick Grimes, the lead character on the AMC post-apocalyptic horror television series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. For his portrayal of Rick Grimes, Lincoln won the Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television in 2015 and 2017. He departed the cast of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; in 2018, but reprised his role as Rick in 2022 in the series finale and in the spin-off &quot;The Walking Dead: The Ones Who Live&quot; in 2024.

== Early life ==
Lincoln was born on 14 September 1973 in London, the son of an English civil engineer and a South African nurse. His family moved to Cottingham, East Riding of Yorkshire, when he was 18 months old, and then to Bath, Somerset, when he was eight or nine. He attended Beechen Cliff School, where at age 14 he had his first acting role as The Artful Dodger in a school production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;. He spent a summer at the National Youth Theatre in London and became interested in acting as a career. After leaving school, he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) drama school and began to use &quot;Andrew Lincoln&quot; as his stage name.

== Career ==
In 1994, Lincoln made his TV debut in &quot;Births and Deaths&quot;, an episode of the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot;. In 1995, soon after finishing drama school, he was cast in his first major role playing Edgar &quot;Egg&quot; Cooke, one of the lead characters in the BBC drama &quot;This Life&quot;. He went on to appear in British television series and dramas such as &quot;The Woman in White&quot;, &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, including probationary teacher Simon Casey in the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Teachers&quot;. He also had a lead role as university lecturer and psychologist Robert Bridge in &quot;Afterlife&quot;, and starred in the Sky 1 series &quot;Strike Back&quot; with Richard Armitage in 2010. Lincoln appeared in several films such as &quot;Human Traffic&quot; and &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot; and starred alongside Vanessa Paradis in Pascal Chaumeil&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. In particular, his role as Mark in the 2003 film &quot;Love Actually&quot; gained him wider recognition.

Lincoln has performed in plays, including &quot;Hushabye Mountain&quot; in 1999, &quot;Blue/Orange&quot; in 2000 and 2001, &quot;The Late Henry Moss&quot; in 2006, the &quot;Parlour Song&quot; in 2009, as well as radio productions. He has done voice-overs for documentaries, advertisements, and government campaigns. He directed two episodes in the third series of &quot;Teachers&quot; for which he received a BAFTA nomination for Best New Director (Fiction) in 2004.

In April 2010, Lincoln was cast as Rick Grimes, the protagonist of AMC&#x27;s post-apocalyptic series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;. Grimes is a sheriff&#x27;s deputy who awakens from a coma in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. He becomes the leader of a group of family and friends who are forced to relentlessly fight off flesh-eating zombies and hostile humans. In 2010, Lincoln signed up for the show for a potential six years and renegotiated a deal for two further seasons. Lincoln appeared on the show for the final time on 4 November 2018, having previously stated that he wished to spend more time with his children. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Lincoln&#x27;s role on &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; made him &quot;the center of one of the world&#x27;s biggest pop culture franchises&quot;. Following Lincoln&#x27;s departure from &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, it was planned that he would reprise his role of Rick Grimes in a trilogy of feature-length films. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the films were delayed. They were subsequently replaced with a 6-hour show starring both Lincoln and Danai Gurira.

Lincoln has received various awards and nominations for his portrayal of Rick Grimes; he won the Saturn Award for Best Actor on Television in 2015 and again in 2017. In 2012 and 2015, TVLine spotlighted Lincoln as &quot;Performer of the Week&quot; for his performance in the fourth episode of season 3 (&quot;Killer Within&quot;) and for the fifteenth episode of season 5 (&quot;Try&quot;), respectively. Regarding Lincoln&#x27;s performance in &quot;Try&quot;, TVLine said that he &quot;could act his way from A to Z all within the span of a single hour&quot;. Jacob Stolworthy of &quot;The Independent&quot; said that Lincoln&#x27;s performance in the first episode of season seven is &quot;a moment where Andrew Lincoln excels, his character coming full circle&quot;.

In 2019, Lincoln was cast in and filmed in the drama &quot;Penguin Bloom&quot;, his first non-&quot;The Walking Dead&quot; role since 2010.

== Personal life ==
On 10 June 2006, Lincoln married Gael Anderson, daughter of Ian Anderson, flautist and vocalist of Jethro Tull. They have two children, Matilda (born 2007) and Arthur (born 2010).

He was educated in Bath, where he was childhood friends with former Exeter City manager Paul Tisdale. In 2017, Lincoln said &quot;One of my oldest and dearest friends happens to be Paul Tisdale. So I&#x27;ve been watching him very avidly throughout his whole career and I&#x27;ve been very proud of him.&quot;

==Politics==
Lincoln has appeared in a video in support of the Robin Hood tax in 2014. Along with others involved in the video he has encouraged the public to get behind the measure, noting its &quot;incredible support from people across Europe.&quot;

<doc id="1309062" wikidata="Q3776813" url="?curid=1309062" title="Fionnphort">
<text>Fionnphort (, ) is the principal port of the Ross of Mull, and the second largest settlement in the area (its population is approximately 80). The village&#x27;s name is the anglicised pronunciation of the Gaelic for &quot;White Port&quot; and previous names have included Caol Idhe, Gaelic for &quot;Sound of Iona&quot;.

==History==
Historically, Fionnphort has been a fishing village offering religious pilgrims and tourists access to Iona; more recently, it has facilitated the movement of stone from a quarry in the vicinity. The granite which was extracted from Tòrr Mòr Quarry until around 1907 was highly prized for its density and hardness.

==Geography==

The beach at Fionnphort has a distinctive split granite boulder in the centre that is classed as an erratic and deposited here by an ice age glacier. The beach has a car park and a nearby cemetery.

From Fionnphort, the entire east side of Iona can be seen, including Iona Abbey. To the south of the village lies the district of Fidden and the island of Erraid, mentioned in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Kidnapped&quot; and accessible to walkers at low tide.

==Economy==

Fionnphort has an active fishing industry, noted principally for shellfish, particularly crabs and lobsters, the majority of which are exported by container truck to Spain and France.

In April 2008, residents finally had the opportunity to use a cash machine, putting an end to the round-trip to Salen villagers previously had to endure. Sandy Brunton, the local postmaster said that residents are claiming they now have the best view from a cash dispenser anywhere in Britain: &quot;As you stand at the ATM, you have a view of Iona to the west, Coll to the north and looking east you can see the island&#x27;s only Munro, Ben More.&quot;

==Transport==

Fionnphort is the base of the ferry service between Mull and Iona, and also boat trips to the isle of Staffa.

<text>Rupert Lee (1887–1959) was an English painter, sculptor and printmaker. He was one of the organisers of the London International Surrealist Exhibition in 1936.

==Life==
Lee was born in Bombay in 1887. In 1911 Lee entered the Slade School of Art, where he became friendly with Robert Gibbings and Paul Nash. Soon after leaving the Slade he was employed by Edward Gordon Craig to be his musical director at his theatre school in Italy, but the position was cut short by the outbreak of the First World War. Lee served with the Queen&#x27;s Westminster Rifles in the Machine Gun Corps and suffered shell shock following the 1918 Spring Offensive. The series of paintings and drawings he produced while serving in the trenches showed him to be in sympathy with elements of Futurism and Vorticism.
Between 1919 and 1922 he collaborated closely with Paul and John Nash producing wood engravings for the Sun Calendar Yearbook and the Poetry Bookshop. At this period his paintings and wood engravings were bought by notable collectors such as Arnold Bennett, Roger Fry and Edward Marsh. Turning his attention to sculpture during the 1920s, he was elected President of the London Group in 1927 and was responsible for organising the important open-air sculpture exhibition on the roof gardens of Selfridges in 1930, after which he became affiliated with Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell of the Bloomsbury Group. He was Chairman of the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries and worked tirelessly to encourage the modern movement in England. Moving to Spain in 1946, Lee was killed in a motor accident in 1959.

A major book about his life and work was published by Sansom and Co. and a retrospective was staged at the Court Gallery at Gallery 27, Cork Street (London), in May 2010.

<text>Dugway Proving Ground (DPG) is a United States Army facility established in 1942 to test biological and chemical weapons, located about southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah and south of the Utah Test and Training Range.

==Location==

Dugway Proving Ground is located about southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in southern Tooele County and just north of Juab County. It encompasses of the Great Salt Lake Desert, an area the size of the state of Rhode Island, and is surrounded on three sides by mountain ranges. It had a resident population of 795 as of the 2010 United States Census, all of whom lived in the community of Dugway, Utah, at its extreme eastern end.

It is south of the Utah Test and Training Range and together they form the largest block of overland contiguous special use airspace measured from surface or near surface within the continental U.S.().

The transcontinental Lincoln Highway passed through the present site of the Dugway Proving Ground, and is the only section of the old highway closed to the public. At least one old wooden bridge over a creek still stands. The name &quot;Dugway&quot; comes from a technique of digging a trench into a hillside to create a flat surface along which a wagon can travel.

==Mission==
Dugway&#x27;s mission is to test United States and Allied biological and chemical weapon defense systems in a secure and isolated environment. DPG also serves as a facility for US Army Reserve and US National Guard maneuver training, and US Air Force flight tests, mostly from nearby Hill Air Force Base in Clearfield. DPG is controlled by the United States Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC). The area was also used by Army special forces for training in preparation for deployments to the War in Afghanistan.

==History==
In 1941, the US Army Chemical Warfare Service (CWS) determined it needed a testing facility more remote than the US Army&#x27;s Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland. The CWS surveyed the Western U.S. for a new location to conduct its tests, and in early 1942, construction of Dugway Proving Ground began, including the establishment of Michael Army Airfield. Since its founding, much of Dugway Proving Ground activity has been a closely guarded secret.

Testing commenced in mid-1942. During World War II, DPG tested toxic agents, flamethrowers, chemical spray systems, biological warfare weapons, fire bombing tactics, antidotes for chemical agents, and protective clothing. During 1943 the &quot;German Village&quot; and &quot;Japanese Village&quot; set-piece domestic &quot;hamlets&quot; were built at Dugway, for practice in the fire-bombing of homes of the types in urbanized areas of Nazi Germany and the Japanese Empire&#x27;s Home Islands.

In October 1943, DPG established biological warfare facilities at UTTR&#x27;s range telemetry and tracking radar installation, which is an isolated area within DPG known as the Granite Peak Installation. DPG was slowly phased out after World War II, becoming inactive in August 1946.

The base was reactivated during the Korean War, under Commanding Officer Lieutenant Colonel Speers Ponder, and in 1954 was confirmed as a permanent Department of the Army installation. In October 1958, the United States Army Chemical Center, Maryland, moved the U.S. Army Chemical, Biological, and Radiological Weapons School to Dugway Proving Ground. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Project Bellwether—a study of weaponized, mosquito-spread infections—was based at DPG.

From 1985 to 1991, Dugway Proving Ground was home to the Ranger School&#x27;s short-lived Desert Training Phase. It was first known as the Desert Ranger Division (DRD) until redesignated the Ranger Training Brigade&#x27;s 7th Ranger Training Battalion in 1987, and taught students basic desert survival skills and small unit tactics. The program was later moved back to its original site at Fort Bliss, Texas, in 1991, where it was deactivated in 1995.

On September 8, 2004, the &quot;Genesis&quot;, a NASA spacecraft, was directed to impact into the desert floor of the Dugway Proving Ground because the topsoil there is like talcum powder, or moondust, and would likely cushion the troubled spacecraft&#x27;s impact. The &quot;Genesis&quot; spacecraft&#x27;s accelerometer had been installed backwards, which caused the spacecraft to malfunction upon re-entry to Earth&#x27;s atmosphere preventing the originally planned air retrieval.

On January 26, 2011, Dugway Proving Ground was placed on lockdown. Al Vogel, a public affairs specialist for the installation, would only say that the lockdown began at 5:24 p.m. Employees were not allowed to leave, and those coming to work were not allowed in. Vogel said there were no injuries, no damage and no threats reported at the proving ground. There were about 1,200 to 1,400 people at Dugway when the lockdown occurred. It was later announced that the lockdown was in response to the temporary loss of a vial containing VX nerve agent. The lockdown was lifted on January 27 following recovery of the material. The incident was described as a mislabeling problem.

Dugway Proving Ground was also home to the High Resolution Fly&#x27;s Eye Cosmic Ray Detector, which discovered the first ultra-high-energy cosmic ray. Dugway is home to several radio telemetry and tracking radar (i.e. RIR-777, TPQ-39 (Ver. V) and MPQ-39) sites which track national flight assets during flight tests at UTTR.

Activities included aerial nerve agent testing. According to reports from &quot;New Scientist&quot;, Dugway was still producing quantities of anthrax spores as late as 2015 to be used to develop anthrax testing detection and countermeasures, more than four decades after the United States renounced biological weapons, and shipping material intended to be inert to military bases and military contractors around the globe. There were at least 1,100 other chemical tests at Dugway during the period of the Dugway sheep incident (see below). In total, almost 500,000 lb (230,000 kg) of nerve agent were dispersed during open-air tests. There were also tests at Dugway involving other weapons of mass destruction, including 328 open-air tests of biological weapons, 74 dirty bomb tests, and eight furnace heatings of nuclear material under open-air conditions to simulate the dispersal of fallout in the case of meltdown of aeronautic nuclear reactors.

On December 13, 2019, the U.S. Air Force said it had kept the Ultra Long Endurance Aircraft Platform (Ultra LEAP) at the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah airborne for two days during testing of the surveillance drone at the site.

===&quot;Sheep Kill&quot; incident===
In March 1968, 6,249 sheep died in Skull Valley, an area nearly thirty miles from Dugway&#x27;s testing sites. When examined, the sheep were found to have been poisoned by an organophosphate chemical. The sickening of the sheep, known as the Dugway sheep incident, coincided with several open-air tests of the nerve agent VX at Dugway. Local attention focused on the Army, which initially denied that VX had caused the deaths, instead blaming the local use of organophosphate pesticides on crops. Necropsies conducted on the dead sheep later definitively identified the presence of VX. The Army never admitted liability, but did pay the ranchers for their losses. On the official record, the claim was for 4,372 &quot;disabled&quot; sheep, of which about 2,150 were either killed outright by the VX exposure or were so critically injured that they needed to be euthanized on-site by veterinarians. Another 1,877 sheep were &quot;temporarily&quot; injured, or showed no signs of injury but ultimately were not marketable due to their potential exposure. All of the exposed sheep that survived the initial exposure were eventually euthanized by the ranchers, since even the potential for exposure had rendered the sheep permanently unsalable for either meat or wool.

The incident, coinciding with the birth of the environmental movement and anti-Vietnam War protests, created an uproar in Utah and the international community.

===U.S. GAO report===
The U.S. General Accounting Office issued a report on September 28, 1994, which stated that between 1940 and 1974, DOD and other national security agencies performed &quot;hundreds, perhaps thousands&quot; of weapons tests and experiments involving hazardous substances.

The quote from the study:

There are reports that certain nerve agents such as tetrodotoxin and &quot;Datura stramonium&quot; have been tested at this military base.

===Anthrax shipments===
In May 2015 it was revealed that Dugway lab had inadvertently shipped live anthrax bacillus to locations around the country. Shipped samples, it was said, were supposed to be inert. Labs receiving the live samples were in Texas, Maryland, Wisconsin, Delaware, New Jersey, Tennessee, New York, California and Virginia, the Associated Press reported. Days after the first report, the military divulged that the mis-shipments had been broader than initially reported and launched an investigation. Dugway was involved in developing a test to identify biological threats in the field.

In September 2018, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released findings of an investigation into the anthrax shipping lapses made at Dugway. The investigation looked into whether &quot;systemic oversight changes regarding biosecurity have since been implemented across DOD facilities. The findings are mixed.&quot; The U.S. Army had sought 35 specific changes, but only 18 of them had been made, as of the GAO report. According to the report, the DOD &quot;had not fully identified the infrastructure capabilities required to address threats, had not planned to identify potential duplication without considering information from existing federal studies, and had not updated its guidance and planning process to include specific responsibilities and time frames for risk assessments.&quot;

==UFO speculation==
Following the public attention drawn to Area 51 in the early 1990s, UFOlogists and concerned citizens have suggested that whatever covert operations may have been underway at that location, if any, were subsequently transferred to DPG.

The &quot;Deseret News&quot; reported that Dave Rosenfeld, president of Utah UFO Hunters, claimed but provided no proof for &quot;Numerous UFOs have been stored and reported in the area in and around Dugway ... [military aircraft can&#x27;t account for] all the unknowns seen in the area. It might be that our star visitors are keeping an eye on Dugway too. ... [Dugway is] the &quot;new&quot; Area 51. And probably the new military spaceport.&quot;

Dugway Proving Ground has often made light of the rumors, satirizing the conspiracy on their official social media posts. A 2021 community event at the base had shooting targets with alien profiles set up by the base&#x27;s police department for children to target with an airsoft gun. A 2023 5K run &amp; 10K run Halloween costume race announced at the base was dubbed the &quot;Alien Invasion&quot; with the tag-line &quot;come see the history of Area 52&quot;.

<text>James A. Balcer (born June 24, 1950) is a former alderman of the 11th Ward of the City of Chicago (map). A member of the Democratic Party, he was appointed to the Chicago City Council by Mayor Richard M. Daley in 1997. In May 2015, he was succeeded by former Metropolitan Water Reclamation District Commissioner, Patrick Daley Thompson.

==Military career==
Balcer served as a member of the U.S. Marine Corps during the Vietnam War and in 2001 was belatedly awarded the Bronze Star.

==Political career==
Balcer served as an alderman on six committees: Budget and Government Operations; Energy, Environmental Protection and Public Utilities; Finance; Human Relations; Police and Fire; and Transportation and Public Way.

He was appointed to the Council in the aftermath of a scandal about disclosures about then-Ald. Patrick Huels&#x27; private security firm that resulted in Huels&#x27; resignation.

Ald. Balcer&#x27;s former ward encompasses part of Chicago&#x27;s Southwest Side, and includes the neighborhood of Bridgeport, which has been home to five Chicago mayors, including both Richard M. and Richard J. Daley.

Ald. Balcer attracted media attention in May, 2009 for ordering the removal of a mural that had been commissioned on private property. Ald. Balcer also received a 2010 &quot;Jefferson Muzzle&quot; from the Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression.

<text>Karl Wilhelm Georg von Grolman(n) (30 July 1777 – 1 June 1843) was a Prussian general who fought in the Napoleonic Wars.

==Biography==
Grolman was born in Berlin. He entered an infantry regiment at the age of thirteen years, was commissioned as an ensign in 1795, a second lieutenant in 1797, a first lieutenant in 1804, and a staff-captain in 1805. While still a subaltern, he had become one of Scharnhorst&#x27;s intimate friends, and he was distinguished for his energetic and fearless character before the War of 1806. He served as a staff officer from Jena to the Peace of Tilsit and won the rank of major for distinguished service in action. After the downfall of Prussia and the subsequent peace, Grolman was one of the most active as Scharnhorst&#x27;s assistants in the work of reorganization during 1809. He joined the Tugendbund and endeavoured to take part in Schill&#x27;s abortive expedition, after which he entered the Austrian service as a major on the general staff.

Thereafter he journeyed to Cadiz to assist the Spanish against Napoleon and he led a corps of volunteers in the defence of that port against Marshal Victor in 1810. He was present at the Battle of Albuera, at Saguntum, and at Valencia, and became a prisoner of war at Valencia. Soon, however, he escaped to Switzerland, and in 1813 he returned to Prussia as a major on the general staff. He served successively under Colonel von Dolffs and General von Kleist as commissioner at the headquarters of the Russian general Barclay de Tolly.

Grolman took part with Kleist in the victory of Kulm and recovered from a severe wound received at that action in time to be present at the Battle of Leipzig. He played a conspicuous part in the campaign of 1814 in France after which he was made a major general. In this rank be was appointed quartermaster-general to Field Marshal Prince Blücher and after his chief and Gneisenau, Grolman had the greatest share in directing the Prussian operations of 1815.

In the decision, on 18 June 1815, to press forward to Wellington&#x27;s assistance, Grolman actively concurred, and as the troops approached the battlefield, he is said to have overcome the momentary hesitation of the commander-in-chief and the chief of staff; himself giving the order to advance.

After the Peace of 1815, Grolman occupied important positions in the Ministry of War and the General Staff of the new Prussian Army, being dedicated to reforming the latter. His last public services were rendered in Poland as commander-in-chief, and practically as civil administrator of Grand Duchy of Posen, where he did much to promote the extension of German influence. He was promoted general of infantry in 1837 and died on 1 June 1843 at Posen. His two sons became generals in the Prussian army and the Prussian 18th Infantry Regiment bore his name.

General von Grolman supervised and provided much of the material for Damitz&#x27;s &quot;Geschichte des Feldzugs 1815&quot; (Berlin, 1837-1838), and &quot;Geschichte des Feldzugs 1814 in Frankreich&quot; (Berlin, 1842-1843).

==Family==
He was the brother of Wilhelm Heinrich von Grolman.

<doc id="1309105" wikidata="Q2559480" url="?curid=1309105" title="Chester Cathedral">
<text>Chester Cathedral is a Church of England cathedral and the mother church of the Diocese of Chester. It is located in the city of Chester, Cheshire, England. The cathedral, formerly the abbey church of a Benedictine monastery dedicated to Saint Werburgh, is dedicated to Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary. Since 1541, it has been the seat of the Bishop of Chester.

The cathedral is a Grade I listed building, and part of a heritage site that also includes the former monastic buildings to the north, which are also listed Grade I. The cathedral&#x27;s construction dates from between the 10th century and the early 16th century, having been modified a number of times throughout history, a typical characteristic of English cathedrals; however, the site itself may have been used for Christian worship since Roman times. All the major styles of English medieval architecture, from Norman to Perpendicular, are represented in the present building.

The cathedral and former monastic buildings were extensively restored during the 19th century (amidst some controversy), and a free standing bell tower was added in the 20th century. In addition to holding services for Christian worship, the buildings are a major tourist attraction in Chester and the cathedral is used as a venue for concerts and exhibitions.

==History==
The city of Chester was an important Roman stronghold. There may have been a Christian basilica on the site of the present cathedral in the late Roman era, while Chester was controlled by Legio XX Valeria Victrix. Legend holds that the basilica was dedicated to Saint Paul and Saint Peter. This is supported by evidence that in Saxon times the dedication of an early chapel on this site was changed from Saint Peter to Saint Werburgh. In 958 King Edgar granted land to the Minster of St Werburgh in Chester.

During the Early Middle Ages Barloc of Norbury, a Catholic Celtic saint and hermit, was venerated at Chester Cathedral with a feast day on 10 September. He is known to history mainly through the hagiography of the Secgan Manuscript; he also occurs in a litany in MS Tanner 169* of the Bodleian Library, Oxford.

In 907 Chester was refortified against the threat from the Vikings, and shortly afterwards the minster was founded or refounded, and Werburgh&#x27;s remains were transferred there from Hanbury, probably by Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians. The collegiate church, as it was then, was restored in 1057 by Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and Lady Godiva. This church was razed to the ground around 1090, with the secular canons evicted, and no known trace of it remains.
In 1093 a Benedictine abbey was established on the site by Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, with the assistance of St Anselm and other monks from Bec in Normandy. The earliest surviving parts of the structure date from that time. The abbey church was not at that time the cathedral of Chester; from 1075 to 1082 the cathedral of the diocese was the nearby church of St John the Baptist, after which the see was transferred to Coventry. In 1538, during the dissolution of the monasteries, the monastery was disbanded and the shrine of Saint Werburgh was desecrated. In 1541 St Werburgh&#x27;s abbey became a cathedral of the Church of England, by order of Henry VIII. At the same time, the dedication was changed to Christ and the Blessed Virgin. The last abbot of St Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey, Thomas Clarke, became the first dean of the new cathedral, at the head of a secular chapter.

Although little trace of the 10th-century church has been discovered, save possibly some Saxon masonry found during a 1997 excavation of the nave, there is much evidence of the monastery of 1093. This work in the Norman style may be seen in the northwest tower, the north transept and in remaining parts of the monastic buildings. The abbey church, beginning with the Lady Chapel at the eastern end, was extensively rebuilt in Gothic style during the 13th and 14th centuries. At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, the cloister, the central tower, a new south transept, the large west window and a new entrance porch to the south had just been built in the Perpendicular style, and the southwest tower of the façade had been begun. The west front was given a Tudor entrance, but the tower was never completed.

In 1636 the space beneath the south west tower became a bishop&#x27;s consistory court. It was furnished as such at that time, and is now a unique survival in England, hearing its last case, that of an attempted suicide of a priest, in the 1930s. Until 1881, the south transept, which is unusually large, also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity: the parish church of St Oswald. Although the 17th century saw additions to the furnishings and fittings, there was no further building work for several centuries. By the 19th century, the building was badly in need of restoration. The present homogeneous appearance that the cathedral presents from many exterior angles is largely the work of Victorian restorers, particularly George Gilbert Scott.

The 20th century has seen continued maintenance and restoration. In 1922, the Chester War Memorial was installed in the cathedral grounds and dedicated to the fallen soldiers of the First World War and later the Second World War. In 1973–75 a detached belfry, the Addleshaw Tower, designed by George Pace, was erected in the grounds of the cathedral. In 2005 a new Song School was added to the cathedral. During the 2000s, the cathedral library was refurbished and relocated. It was officially reopened in September 2007. The cathedral and the former monastic buildings were designated as Grade I listed buildings on 28 July 1955.

In October 2021, the abbey&#x27;s gateway was one of 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million injection into the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

==Architecture==

===Cathedral===

====Plan====
Chester Cathedral has an east–west axis, common to many cathedrals, with the chancel at the eastern end, and the façade to the west. The plan is cruciform, with a central tower (as is usual in English monastic churches), but is asymmetrical, having a small transept on the north side remaining from an earlier building, and an unusually large south transept. As the plan shows, the asymmetry extends to the west front, where the north tower remains from the Norman building, and the south tower is of the early 16th century. At the eastern end, the symmetrical arrangement of the aisles was lost when the end of the south aisle was demolished and rebuilt in an apsidal shape. The nave, choir and south transept have wide aisles on either side, and are lit by clerestory windows and large multi-light windows in each of the three cliff-like ends. To the north of the cathedral are monastic buildings, including the cloister, refectory and a rectangular chapter house. The façade of the building is abutted on the north by later buildings.


====External appearance====

Like the cathedrals of Carlisle, Lichfield and Worcester, Chester Cathedral is built of New Red Sandstone, in this case Keuper Sandstone from the Cheshire Basin. The stone lends itself to detailed carving, but is also friable, easily eroded by rain and wind, and is badly affected by pollution. With the other red sandstone buildings, Chester is one of the most heavily restored of England&#x27;s cathedrals. The restoration, which included much refacing and many new details, took place mainly in the 19th century. 
Because the south transept is similar in dimension to the nave and choir, views of the building from the south-east and south-west give the impression of a building balanced around a central axis, with its tower as the hub. The tower is of the late 15th century Perpendicular style, but its four large battlemented turrets are the work of the restoration architect George Gilbert Scott.
With its rhythmic arrangement of large, traceried windows, pinnacles, battlements and buttresses, the exterior of Chester Cathedral from the south presents a fairly homogeneous character, which is an unusual feature as England&#x27;s cathedrals are in general noted for their stylistic diversity. Close examination reveals window tracery of several building stages from the 13th to the early 16th century. The richness of the 13th-century tracery is accentuated by the presence of ornate, crocketted drip-mouldings around the windows; those around the perpendicular windows are of simpler form.

The façade of the cathedral is dominated by a large deeply recessed eight-light window in the Perpendicular style, above a recessed doorway set in a screen-like porch designed, probably by Seth and George Derwall, in the early 1500s. This porch formed part of the same late 15th-century building programme as the south transept, central and southwest towers, and cloister. Neither of the west towers was completed. To the north is the lower stage of a Norman tower, while to the south is the lower stage of a tower designed and begun, probably by Seth and George Derwall, in 1508, but left incomplete following the dissolution of the monastery in 1538. The cathedral&#x27;s façade is abutted on the north by a Victorian building housing the education centre and largely obscured from view by the building previously used as the King&#x27;s School and the Choir School which was until 2024 a branch of Barclays Bank. The door of the west front is not used as the normal entrance to the cathedral, which is through the southwest porch which is in an ornate Tudor style.

====Interior====
The interior of Chester Cathedral gives a warm and mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because the view from the west end of the nave to the east end is unimpeded by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England&#x27;s cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.

====Norman remnants====
The present building, dating from around 1283 to 1537, mostly replaced the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 which was built in the Norman style. It is believed that the newer church was built around the older one. That the few remaining parts of the Norman church are of small proportions, while the height and width of the Gothic church are generous would seem to confirm this belief. Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept, which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy, which was formerly a chapel. The transept has retained an early 16th-century coffered ceiling with decorated bosses, two of which are carved with the arms of Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey.

The north west tower is also of Norman construction. It serves as the baptistry and houses a black marble font, consisting of a bowl on a large baluster dating from 1697. The lower part of the north wall of the nave is also from the Norman building, but can only be viewed from the cloister because the interior has been decorated with mosaic.

====Early English====
The Early English Gothic chapter house, built between 1230 and 1265, is rectangular and opens off a &quot;charming&quot; vestibule leading from the north transept. The chapter house has grouped windows of simple untraceried form. Alec Clifton-Taylor describes the exterior of this building as a &quot;modest but rather elegant example of composition in lancets&quot; while Nikolaus Pevsner says of the interior &quot;It is a wonderfully noble room&quot; which is the &quot;aesthetic climax of the cathedral&quot;. To the north of the chapter house is the slype, also Early English in style, and the warming room, which contains two large former fireplaces. The monastic refectory to the north of the cloister is of about the same date as the chapter house.

The Lady Chapel to the eastern end of the choir dates from between 1265 and 1290. It is of three bays, and contains the Shrine of St Werburgh, dating from the 14th century. The vault of the Lady Chapel is the only one in the cathedral that is of stone. It is decorated with carved roof bosses representing the Trinity, the Madonna and Child, and the murder of Thomas Becket. The chapel also has a sedilia and a piscina.

====Decorated Gothic====

The choir, of five bays, was built between 1283 and 1315 to the design of Richard Lenginour, and is an early example of Decorated Gothic architecture. The piers have strongly modelled attached shafts, supporting deeply moulded arches. There is a triforium gallery with four cusped arches to each bay. The sexpartite vault, which is a 19th-century restoration, is supported by clusters of three shafts which spring from energetic figurative corbels. The overall effect is robust, and contrasts with the delicacy of the pinnacled choir stalls, the tracery of the windows and the rich decoration of the vault which was carried out by the ecclesiastical designers, Clayton and Bell. The choir stalls, dating from about 1380, are one of the glories of the cathedral.

The aisles of the choir previously both extended on either side of the Lady Chapel. The south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by George Gilbert Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of St Erasmus. The eastern end of the north aisle contains the chapel of St Werburgh.

The nave of six bays, and the large, aisled south transept were begun in about 1323, probably to the design of Nicholas de Derneford. There are a number of windows containing fine Flowing Decorated tracery of this period. The work ceased in 1375, in which year there was a severe outbreak of plague in England. The building of the nave was recommenced in 1485, more than 150 years after it was begun. The architect was probably William Rediche. Remarkably, for an English medieval architect, he maintained the original form, changing only the details. The nave was roofed with a stellar vault rather like that of the Lady Chapel at Ely and the choir at York Minster, both of which date from the 1370s. Like that at York, the vault is of wood, imitating stone.

====Perpendicular Gothic====
From about 1493 until 1525 the architect appears to have been Seth Derwall, succeeded by George Derwall until 1537. Seth Derwall completed the south transept to a Perpendicular Gothic design, as seen in the transomed windows of the clerestory. He also built the central tower, southwest porch and cloisters. Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508, but it had not risen above the roofline at the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, and has never been completed. The central tower, rising to , is a &quot;lantern tower&quot; with large windows letting light into the crossing. Its external appearance has been altered by the addition of four battlemented turrets by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century.


===Former monastic buildings===
The Perpendicular Gothic cloister is entered from the cathedral through a Norman doorway in the north aisle. The cloister is part of the building programme that commenced in the 1490s and is probably the work of Seth Derwall. The south wall of the cloister, dating from the later part of the Norman period, forms the north wall of the nave of the cathedral, and includes blind arcading. Among the earliest remaining structures on the site is an undercroft off the west range of the cloisters, which dates from the early 12th century, and which was originally used by the monks for storing food. It consists of two naves with groin vaults and short round piers with round scalloped capitals.

Leading from the south of the undercroft is the abbot&#x27;s passage which dates from around 1150 and consists of two bays with rib-vaulting. Above the abbot&#x27;s passage, approached by a stairway from the west cloister, is St Anselm&#x27;s Chapel which also dates from the 12th century. It is in three bays and has a 19th century Gothic-style plaster vault. The chancel is in one bay and was remodelled in the early 17th century. The screen, altar rails, holy table and plaster ceiling of the chancel date from the 17th century. The north range of the cloister gives access to a refectory, built by Simon de Whitchurch in the 13th century. It contains an Early English pulpit, approached by a staircase with an ascending arcade. The only other similar pulpit in England is in Beaulieu Abbey.

===Restoration===
 
By the 19th century the fabric of the building had become badly weathered, with Charles Hiatt writing that &quot;the surface rot of the very perishable red sandstone, of which the cathedral was built, was positively unsightly&quot; and that the &quot;whole place previous to restoration struck one as woebegone and neglected; it perpetually seemed to hover on the verge of collapse, and yet was without a trace of the romance of the average ruin&quot;. Between 1818 and 1820 the architect Thomas Harrison restored the south transept, adding corner turrets. This part of the building served until 1881 as the parish church of St Oswald, and it was ecclesiastically separate. From 1844 R. C. Hussey carried out a limited restoration including work on the south side of the nave.

The most extensive restoration was carried out by the Gothic Revival architect Sir Gilbert Scott, who between 1868 and 1876 &quot;almost entirely re-cased&quot; the cathedral. The current building is acknowledged to be mainly the product of this Victorian restoration commissioned by the Dean, John Saul Howson. In addition to extensive additions and alterations to the body of the church, Scott remodelled the tower, adding turrets and crenellations. Scott chose sandstone from the quarries at Runcorn for his restoration work. In addition to the restoration of the fabric of the building, Scott designed internal fittings such as the choir screen to replace those destroyed during the Civil War; the roof had also been melted down to make musket balls. He built the fan vault of the south porch, renewed the wooden vault of the choir and added a great many decorative features to the interior.

Scott&#x27;s restorations were not without their critics and caused much debate in architectural circles. Scott claimed to have archaeological evidence for his work, but the Liverpool architect, Samuel Huggins, argued in an 1868 address to the Liverpool Architectural Society that the alterations were less like restoration and more like rebuilding. One of the larger changes was to shorten the south aisle and restyle it as an apse. The changes also proposed the addition of a spire above the existing tower, but this proposal was later rejected. Samuel&#x27;s further paper of 1871 entitled &quot;On so-called restorations of our cathedral and abbey churches&quot; compelled the Dean to attempt to answer the criticism. The debate contributed to the establishment of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings.

Later in the century, from 1882, Arthur Blomfield and his son Charles made further additions and modifications, including restoring and reinstating the Shrine of St Werburgh. More work was carried out in the 20th century by Giles Gilbert Scott between 1891 and 1913, and by F. H. Crossley in 1939.

===Bell tower===

Towards the end of 1963 the cathedral bells, which were housed in the central tower, were in need of an overhaul and ringing was suspended. In 1965 the Dean asked George Pace, architect to York Minster, to prepare specifications for a new bell frame and for electrification of the clock and tolling mechanism. Due to structural difficulties and the cost of replacing the bells in the central tower it was advised that consideration should be given to building a detached bell and clock tower in the southeast corner of the churchyard. It was decided to proceed with that plan, and in 1969 an announcement was made that the first detached cathedral bell tower was to be erected since the building of the campanile at Chichester Cathedral in the 15th century. In February 1969, nine of the ten bells in the central tower were removed to be recast by John Taylor &amp; Co as a ring of twelve bells with a flat sixth. The new bells were cast in 1973. Work on the new bell-tower began in February 1973. Two old bells dating from 1606 and 1626 were left in the tower. On 26 February 1975 the bells were rung for the first time to celebrate the wedding of a member of the Grosvenor family. The official opening on 25 June 1975 was performed by the Duke of Gloucester. The belfry is known as the Dean Addleshaw Tower, after the dean of the cathedral responsible for its construction. The tower is built in concrete, faced with sandstone at its base. It is the first detached bell tower to be built for a cathedral in this country since the Reformation. Between the bell tower and the south transept is a garden in remembrance of the Cheshire Regiment (originally the 22nd Regiment of Foot). 

==Fittings and glass==
The treasures of Chester Cathedral are its rare fittings, specifically its choir stalls and the 17th-century furnishing of the bishop&#x27;s Consistory Court in the south tower, which is a unique survival.

===Choir stalls===
The choir stalls date from about 1380. They have high, spiky, closely set canopies, with crocketed arches and spirelets. The stall ends have poppyheads and are rich with figurative carving. The stalls include 48 misericords, all but five of which are original, depicting a variety of subjects, some humorous and some grotesque. Pevsner states that they are &quot;one of the finest sets in the country&quot;, while Alec Clifton-Taylor calls them &quot;exquisite&quot; and says of the misericords that &quot;for delicacy and grace they surpass even those at Lincoln and Beverley&quot;.

===Organ===

In 1844, an organ by Gray &amp; Davison of London was installed in the cathedral, replacing an instrument with parts dating back to 1626. The organ was rebuilt and enlarged by Whiteley Bros of Chester in 1876, to include harmonic flutes and reeds by Cavaillé-Coll. It was later moved to its present position at the front of the north transept. In 1910 William Hill and Son of London extensively rebuilt and revoiced the organ, replacing the Cavaillé-Coll reeds with new pipes of their own. The choir division of the organ was enlarged and moved behind the choirstalls on the south side. The instrument was again overhauled by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool in 1969, when a new mechanism and some new pipework made to a design by the organist, Roger Fisher, was installed. Since 1991 the organ has been in the care of David Wells of Liverpool.

===Stained glass===
:&quot;See Gallery below&quot;

Chester suffered badly at the hands of the Parliamentary troops. As a consequence, its stained glass dates mainly from the 19th and 20th centuries and has representative examples the significant trends in stained glass design from the 1850s onwards. Of the earlier Victorian firms, William Wailes is the best represented, in the south aisle (1862), as well as Hardman &amp; Co. and Michael O&#x27;Connor. Glass from the High Victorian period is well represented by two leading London firms, Clayton and Bell and Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The Aesthetic style is represented by Charles Eamer Kempe. Early 20th century windows include several commemorating those who died in World War I.

There are also several notable modern windows, the most recent being the refectory window of 2001 by Ros Grimshaw which depicts the Creation. The eight-light Perpendicular window of the west end contains mid-20th century glass representing the Holy Family and Saints, by W. T. Carter Shapland. Three modern windows in the south aisle, designed and made by Alan Younger to replace windows damaged in the Second World War. They were donated by the 6th Duke of Westminster to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the cathedral and contain the dates 1092 and 1992 to reflect the theme of &quot;continuity and change&quot;.

==Features==
===Nave===
The west end of the nave is dominated by an eight-light window in the Perpendicular Gothic style which almost fills the upper part of the west wall. It contains stained glass designed by W. T. Carter Shapland dating from 1961 and depicts the Holy Family in the middle two lights, flanked by the northern saints Werburgh, Oswald, Aidan, Chad and Wilfrid, and Queen Ethelfleda.

The stone nave pulpit was designed by the restorer R. C. Hussey and the lectern, dated 1876, is by Skidmore. The mosaic floor of the tower bay was designed by John Howson (Dean, 1867–1885) and executed by Burke and Co. The same firm installed the mosaics which decorate the wall of the north aisle, depicting the patriarchs and prophets Abraham, Moses, David and Elijah. They were designed by J. R. Clayton of Clayton and Bell, and date from 1883 to 86.

Monuments in the nave include those to Roger Barnston, dated 1838, by John Blayney, to Nicholas Stratford (Bishop, 1689–1707), dated 1708, to George Hall (Bishop, 1662–1668 (d.)), to Edmund Entwistle, dated 1712, to John and Thomas Wainwright who died respectively in 1686 and 1720, to Robert Bickerstaff who died in 1841 by Blayney, to William Smith (Dean, 1758–1787 (d.)) by Thomas Banks, and to William Mainwaring, dated 1671.
===Quire===
The most famous feature of the quire is the set of choir stalls, dating from about 1380, and described above. The lectern, in the form of a wooden eagle, symbol of John the Evangelist, dates from the first half of the 17th century. The candlesticks also date from the 17th century and are by Censore of Bologna who died in 1662.

With these exceptions, most of the decoration and the fittings of the quire date from the 19th century and are in keeping with the Gothic Revival promoted by the Oxford Movement and Augustus Welby Pugin. The restored vault of the quire is typical of the period, having been designed by Scott and decorated and gilded by Clayton and Bell.

The quire is entered through a screen designed by George Gilbert Scott, with gates made by Skidmore. The rood was designed by Scott, and was made by F. Stuflesser. The bishop&#x27;s throne or &quot;cathedra&quot; was designed by Scott to complement the choir stalls. It was constructed by Farmer and Brindley in 1876. The reredos and the floor mosaic date from 1876, and were designed by J. R. Clayton. The east window has tracery of an elegant Decorated Gothic design which is filled with stained glass of 1884 by Heaton, Butler and Bayne.

===Lady Chapel===
The 13th-century Lady Chapel contains the stone shrine of Saint Werburgh which dates from the 14th century and which used to contain her relics. The shrine, of similar red sandstone as the cathedral, has a base pierced with deep niches. The upper part takes the form of a miniature chapel containing statuettes. During the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was dismantled. Some of the parts were found during the 1873 restoration of the cathedral and the shrine was reassembled in 1888 by Blomfield. A carving of St Werburgh by Joseph Pyrz was added in 1993. Also in the chapel are a sedilia and a piscina. The stained glass of 1859, is by William Wailes. The chapel contains a monument to Archdeacon Francis Wrangham, made by Hardman &amp; Co. and dating from 1846. In 1555, George Marsh, Martyr stood trial here accused of heresy.

===North quire aisle===
The north quire aisle has a stone screen by R. C. Hussey and an iron gate dated 1558 that came from Guadalajara. At the east end of the aisle is the chapel of St Werburgh which has a vault of two bays, and an east window depicting the Nativity by Michael O&#x27;Connor, dated 1857. Other stained glass windows in the north aisle are by William Wailes, by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and by Clayton and Bell. The chapel contains a piscina dating from the 14th century, and monuments to John Graham (Bishop, 1848–1865) dated 1867, and to William Bispham who died in 1685, Other monuments in the north aisle include a tablet to William Jacobson (Bishop, 1865–1884), dated 1887, by Boehm to a design by Blomfield.
===North transept, sacristy and chapter house===
The small Norman transept has clerestory windows containing stained glass by William Wailes, installed in 1853. The sacristy, of 1200, has an east window depicting St Anselm, and designed by A. K. Nicholson. In the north transept is a freestanding tomb chest monument to John Pearson who died in 1686, designed by Arthur Blomfield and carved by Nicholas Earp, with a recumbent effigy by Matthew Noble. Other monuments in the transept include one to Samuel Peploe, dating from about 1784, by Joseph Nollekens. The wall monuments include cenotaphs to members of the Cheshire (Earl of Chester&#x27;s) Yeomanry killed in the Boer War and in the First and Second World Wars. At the corner of the transept with the north aisle is a 17th-century Tree of Jesse carved in whale ivory. A niche contains a rare example of a &quot;cobweb picture&quot;, painted on the web of a caterpillar. Originating in the Austrian Tyrol, it depicts Mary and the Christ-Child, and is based on a painting by Lucas Cranach the Elder.

The chapter house has stained glass in its east window by Heaton, Butler and Bayne and grisaille windows in the north and south walls, dated 1882–83, by Blomfield. It contains an oak cope cupboard from the late 13th century. The front of the chapter house was rebuilt to a design by Hussey.

===South choir aisle===
The south aisle was shortened in about 1870 by Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of St Erasmus. The stained glass in the apse window is dated 1872 and is by Clayton and Bell. Below this is a mosaic designed by J. R. Clayton and made by Salviati, and a fresco painting by Clayton and Bell, dated 1874. Elsewhere the stained glass in the aisle is by Wailes, and by Hardman &amp; Co. to a design by Pugin. The aisle contains the tomb of Ranulf Higdon, a monk at St Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey in the 12th century who wrote a major work of history entitled &quot;Polychronicon&quot;, a monument to Thomas Brassey (a civil engineering contractor who died in 1870), designed by Blomfield and made by Wagmuller, a monument to Samuel Peploe (Bishop, 1726–1752) who died in 1752, and three painted monuments by a member of the Randle Holme family.
===South transept===
The south transept, formerly the parish church of St Oswald contains a piscina and sedilia in the south wall. On the east wall are four chapels, each with a reredos, two of which were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, one by Kempe and the other by his successor, W. E. Tower. The south window is dated 1887 and was made by Heaton, Butler and Bayne to a design by R. C. Hussey. Other stained glass in the transept is by Clayton and Bell, by C. E. Kempe and by Powell.

The monuments include those to George Ogden who died in 1781, by Hayward, to Anne Matthews who died in 1793, by Thomas Banks, to John Philips Buchanan who died at Waterloo in 1815, to the first Duke of Westminster, designed by C. J. Blomfield, and two memorial plaques to members of the Egerton family. On the wall of the southwest crossing pier are monuments which include a cenotaph to the casualties in HMS &quot;Chester&quot; in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 who included the 16-year-old John Cornwell VC. The west wall of the south transept has many memorials, including cenotaphs to the Cheshire Regiment, the Royal Air Force and the Free Czech Forces.

===Cloisters and refectory===
The cloisters were restored in the 20th century, and the stained glass windows contain the images of some 130 saints. The cloister garth contains a modern sculpture entitled &quot;The water of life&quot; by Stephen Broadbent. The refectory roof is dated 1939 and was designed by F. H. Crossley. The east window with reticulated tracery was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott and is dated 1913. The stained glass in the west window, depicting the Creation, was designed by Ros Grimshaw and installed in 2001 to celebrate the Millennium. On the refectory&#x27;s west wall there is a tapestry depicting Elymas being struck with blindness which was woven at the Mortlake Tapestry Works in the 17th century from one of the Raphael Cartoons. The heraldic paintings on the north wall represent the arms of the Earls of Chester.

===Library===

A library has been present since the time of St Werburgh&#x27;s Abbey, and following the dissolution of the monasteries it became the cathedral library. It continued to grow over the centuries, but by the 19th century it had become neglected. Between 1867 and 1885 it was enlarged and in the 1890s new bookcases were added. A further reorganisation took place in the 1920s but by the 1980s the contents were contained in five separate sites around the cathedral. A programme of repair and re-cataloguing of the contents was instituted. During the 2000s more work was carried out and the refurbished library, housed in three rooms, opened in 2007. The library is available for research and for organised visits by groups.

====Services====
The cathedral is a place of Christian worship, with two services held daily, and four or five each Sunday. There is Holy Communion each day, and Choral Evensong each day except Wednesday. There is a sung service of cathedral Eucharist every Sunday.

===Music===
The Organist and Master of the Choristers is Philip Rushforth, Head of Music Outreach and Assistant Organist, Dan Mathieson and Sub-Organist, Alexander Palotai. There are lunchtime organ recitals weekly on Thursday at 1:10pm, immediately following Holy Communion. The monthly program of music is available on the cathedral&#x27;s website.

The hymn-writer William Cooke (1821–1894) was a canon of Chester.

====Organists====
The earliest recorded appointment of an organist is of John Brycheley in 1541. Notable organists include the composers Robert White and John Sanders, conductor George Guest and the recording artist Roger Fisher.

====Choirs====
The choral tradition at Chester is 900 years old, dating from the foundation of the Benedictine monastery. In 1741 Handel heard the first recital of his Messiah at Chester. There are usually eight choral services in the cathedral each week. Chester has a cathedral choir of male lay clerks, choral scholars, boy and girl choristers and a Nave Choir which is of mixed voice. They rehearse in the Song School, built on the site of the former Monks&#x27; Dormitory. In addition to singing at services, the choir perform in concerts, tour abroad, and make recording on CDs. There was a choir school at the cathedral until 1975 but since that time choristers come from local schools. The Nave Choir, which sings Compline on Sunday evenings and in other services, also takes part in concerts, and undertakes tours. Having been founded during the 1860s, it is the longest-running voluntary cathedral choir in Britain.

===Activities===
Apart from services, a variety of events such as concerts, recitals, exhibitions and tours are held at the cathedral. There are weekly lunchtime organ recitals each Thursday, and concerts by the Chester Cathedral Nave Choir.

The cathedral and precinct are open to visits both by individuals and by groups. The former Refectory of the abbey is used as a café. The Refectory, the Cloister Room, the Chapter House, and the Vestibule can be hired for meetings, receptions and other purposes.

<text>The Vale of Rheidol Railway () is a narrow gauge heritage railway in Ceredigion, Wales, between Aberystwyth and Devil&#x27;s Bridge; a journey of .

It opened in 1902 and, from the withdrawal of main line steam on British Rail in 1968 until privatisation in 1989, it was the sole steam-operated line on the 1948 nationalised British Rail network. It was one of the first parts of British Rail to be privatised. Unlike most other preserved railways in the United Kingdom, the Vale of Rheidol Railway did not have a period of closure between its being part of the national rail system and becoming a heritage railway, and so has operated a continuous service for residents and tourists.

==History==
===Vale of Rheidol Light Railway Company===
A standard gauge railway in the Rheidol valley to the east of Aberystwyth was planned as part of the Manchester and Milford Railway route from Llanidloes to Strata Florida via Devil&#x27;s Bridge. Also planned was a branch from this line from Devil&#x27;s Bridge to Aberystwyth to carry timber (for pit props in the South Wales valleys) and lead ore from the Rheidol Valley to the sea and the main line railway at Aberystwyth. Many lead mines in the Rheidol valley were producing ore at the end of the 19th century, but did not have a means of transporting large quantities of ore to the harbour in Aberystwyth.

Following financial and construction difficulties, the routes from Strata Florida to Llanidloes via Devil&#x27;s Bridge and branch to Aberystwyth were not built, instead in 1865 the Manchester and Milford Railway built an easier route via the Ystwyth valley to Aberystwyth. This left the Rheidol Valley and lead ore mines without a railway.
Gradually an alternative scheme was planned using a narrow gauge line to serve the Rheidol Valley was developed. Initially a gauge was planned to be used similar to the nearby Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway. Following closure of this tramway, the gauge was changed to instead. After obtaining an act of Parliament, the (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. clxxiv), it was not possible to raise finance as quickly as expected, and construction commenced in 1901. To save money, rock was hand-hewn rather than blasted. Construction was overseen by the chief engineer, Sir James Szlumper, although he left day-to-day affairs in the hands of the main contractor employed. It was during construction that the ex-Plynlimon and Hafan Tramway locomotive &quot;Talybont&quot;, regauged from to and renamed &quot;Rheidol&quot;, arrived on the line, where it would remain for the rest of its life.

In the &quot;Daily News&quot; of 9 August 1901 it was reported that the line was expected to be completed by March 1902 and the directors were hopeful for a free grant from the Treasury for the Aberayron Extension.

By the time the railway was ready to open in 1902, lead mining in Ceredigion was in steep decline. However a significant growth in tourism was under way, and the carriage of passengers soon became the principal traffic of the railway. It opened for mineral traffic in August 1902 and for passengers on 22 December 1902, using two 2-6-2T locomotives built by Davies and Metcalfe and the aforementioned &quot;Rheidol&quot;, built by Bagnall.

The original stations were Aberystwyth (located adjacent to Maesyrafon and Park Avenue), Llanbadarn, Capel Bangor, Nantyronen and Devil&#x27;s Bridge (Pontarfynach). A branch ran to Aberystwyth harbour passing alongside the river Rheidol beside Riverside Terrace, underneath Trefechan bridge and behind South Road to the harbour. The final construction cost was reported as £60,000 ().

The line was moderately successful as a tourist railway although local passenger and freight traffic remained limited, to the extent that the harbour branch was very little used throughout its existence. However, efforts were made to develop the tourist service over the summer seasons with the construction of open-sided carriages and such was the level of the tourist trade the locomotive &quot;Palmerston&quot; had to be hired from the Festiniog Railway over a number of summers pre-war (1912, 1913 and 1914) and again post-war (1921 and 1922).

Towards the end of its life as an independent company, the half-year revenue of the company as reported in February 1911 was £3,660 ().

===As a branch of the Cambrian Railways===
In 1912, plans for the use of electric power from the river were considered, but never likely to have taken place due to lack of capital, and were abandoned when the line was absorbed by the Cambrian Railways on 1 July 1913. The Cambrian Railways obtained the company for the seemingly bargain price of £27,311 (), when compared with the construction cost of £69,267 (). The onset of war in 1914 closed the lead mine and passenger services were reduced, which put the final nail in the coffin of any planned improvements. The reduction in passenger services and the need for timber for the war effort meant that freight became the principal revenue source for a short while. The line also served Army training camps in the valley.

===Great Western Railway years===
On 1 January 1922, as part of the Cambrian Railways the line was grouped into the Great Western Railway (GWR). A new station opened next to main standard gauge station in Aberystwyth. The GWR invested quite significantly in its new asset, overhauling one of the two Davies &amp; Metcalfe locomotives and building two brand new locomotives at Swindon, which arrived in 1923. Works records appear to show that the GWR carried out heavy repairs to the original &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; whereas in reality the locomotive was scrapped and a brand new locomotive built to replace it. &quot;Rheidol&quot; was withdrawn from traffic in 1924. New open carriages were built to replace the home-made examples used by the VoR and Cambrian, and in 1938 the closed carriages were entirely replaced by high quality modern replacements, all of which are still in service today.

The GWR recognised that traffic outside its tourist operations would be limited. After the end of 1931 the line became a summer operation only. In 1932, the one remaining original locomotive was sent back to Swindon works and put up for sale. A buyer was not forthcoming and so the locomotive was scrapped in 1935. In 1933 the harbour branch was formally abandoned. The entire line was closed for the duration of World War II, though maintenance continued. After closure for over six years, the railway reopened in June 1946.

===Nationalisation===

The Great Western Railway became part of the Western Region of British Railways on 1 January 1948 and the line continued to operate a tourist service. In the 1950s local managers ensured that the Vale of Rheidol line remained well looked after. The coaches carried British Rail&#x27;s express livery. The locomotives acquired names in 1956 and fully lined express livery for the following season.

In the 1960s, the ex-Cambrian network of Western Region was transferred to the London Midland Region. A question mark hung over the VoR&#x27;s future for some time, until the Minister for Transport, Barbara Castle, confirmed that it would remain open and in British Rail&#x27;s hands. In 1968, the line was rerouted in Aberystwyth to run into the former standard gauge Carmarthen line platforms of the main station, which had been abandoned in 1964. This meant that the route of the line no longer dog-legged and did not have to cross Park Avenue by a level crossing. The former standard gauge locomotive shed was also refurbished and adapted into use for the VoR. The former station site is now occupied by a supermarket and the former route was sold for redevelopment.

In the late 1960s the line&#x27;s locomotives and rolling stock were painted into British Rail&#x27;s corporate blue livery with the British Rail Double Arrow logo emblazoned on loco and coach sides. This was gradually improved in the 1970s with lining and other embellishments, until in the 1980s a return to historical liveries was countenanced. This, together with occasional visits by &quot;Mountaineer&quot; of the Ffestiniog Railway and special trains such as Santa specials and even simulated Wild-West style Indian attacks, helped to keep the line&#x27;s attraction fresh to the public, despite declining investment which resulted in insufficient maintenance – which culminated in a derailment near Aberffrwd in 1986.

Under TOPS the steam locomotives were given the designation Class 98.

In 1989, the line was privatised and sold to Peter Rampton and Tony Hills (the late owner and General Manager of the Brecon Mountain Railway). In 1996, Rampton and Hills split their partnership, with Hills retaining control of the Brecon, and the Rheidol being sold to a trust formed by Rampton, the Phyllis Rampton Narrow Gauge Railway Trust. Unusually, the VoR operated completely without volunteers for approximately the first 20 years of its privatised operation.

===Route===

 is the main terminus where the company&#x27;s administrative headquarters and workshop are located. Leaving Aberystwyth, the line travels eastwards towards the village of Llanbadarn Fawr. There is a request stop at . Trains towards Devil&#x27;s Bridge pause here briefly to activate the level crossing before proceeding. A short distance from Llanbadarn, the line passes over the River Rheidol on a timber trestle bridge and then passes the Glanyrafon Industrial Estate, before heading out into the open countryside. After station is reached. There is a passing loop here and a station building. All trains stop here.

Leaving Capel Bangor the line passes the Rheidol Riding Centre before it begins to climb steeply through the woods at Tanyrallt. After about 10 minutes the train reaches a small country station and request stop. Here locomotives take water from the water column before the train continues on the climb to Aberffrwd.

 station is from Aberystwyth, a journey time of approximately 40 minutes. There is a passing loop here and a station building. All trains stop here. Beyond Aberffrwd the line climbs at a gradient of 1 in 50 all the way to Devil&#x27;s Bridge. This section of the line is isolated with no road access. The track sits on a ledge known as Pant Mawr and follows the contours of the terrain, passing through two request stops at and before reaching Devil&#x27;s Bridge. When the lead mines were being worked there was an aerial cableway linking them with the line at Rhiwfron.

The railway had a branch line which ran to Aberystwyth Harbour, principally for freight services. The Harbour Branch became redundant with the predominance of tourist passenger operations and was closed and lifted, parts of the tracked bed can be walked today behind South Road to the harbour.

The railway is promoted as one of &quot;The Great Little Trains of Wales&quot;, a joint marketing scheme launched in 1970 that encompasses eleven narrow gauge railways, mostly found in Wales. It continues to operate as a tourist railway, operating between Easter and the end of October, with extra services during February half-term and at Christmas. The timetable provides the operating dates. During the summer months, the railway offers a &quot;Driver for a Fiver&quot; experience on a short demonstration line at Devil&#x27;s Bridge station.

===Station restoration project===
The railway carried out a major redevelopment project to enhance the facilities at many of the intermediate stations along the route. Raised platforms were built at the principal crossing and terminal stations, the first time in its history that the railway has had these. Additionally, new waiting shelters have also been provided at some locations in the style of original buildings which had been lost in previous decades.

===Engineering workshop===
There is a purpose-built restoration workshop at Aberystwyth which maintains the railway&#x27;s rolling stock and also takes on contract work for other railways.

===Operation===

The operational base is at Aberystwyth, where there is an engine shed. Heavy overhauls are undertaken in a purpose-built workshop on the south side of the line.

Aberystwyth and Devil&#x27;s Bridge stations have booking offices. For passengers joining the train at any intermediate station, tickets are issued by the Guard.

The railway is single track with passing loops at Capel Bangor and Aberffrwd which are operated by the train crew. The line is worked by tokens, which authorise the driver to enter a single line section. The whole line was originally worked by Tyer&#x27;s Electric Staff instruments. Tokens are provided for:-

*Aberystwyth to Capel Bangor
*Capel Bangor to Aberffrwd
*Aberffrwd to Devil&#x27;s Bridge

A Duty Officer is rostered whenever a passenger service is in operation. The Duty Officer regulates train running, overseeing the token signalling system and giving permission for trains to enter the single line sections, recording train movements on the Train Graph and ensuring trains are formed of an appropriate number of carriages.

===Special events===
The railway operates a programme of special events throughout the year. These include 1920s Jazz Nights, evening specials, Halloween Ghost Trains, autumn colours trains, Santa Specials at Christmas and Wedding events.

In 2014 the line received its first visiting locomotive since the 1980s, when &quot;Palmerston&quot; returned from the Ffestiniog Railway for the first time since its original periods of hire around the First World War, and in 2015 the line held its first ever enthusiast-orientated gala event.

===Television===
The railway has been seen on television on many occasions, including an episode of Great British Railway Journeys filmed in 2012 and the detective series &quot;Y Gwyll&quot; filmed in 2016.

<doc id="1309150" wikidata="Q890687" url="?curid=1309150" title="Death by boiling">
<text>Death by boiling is a method of execution in which a person is killed by being immersed in a boiling liquid. While not as common as other methods of execution, boiling to death has been practiced in many parts of Europe and Asia. Due to the lengthy process, death by boiling is an extremely painful method of execution. Executions of this type were often carried out using a large vessel such as a cauldron or a sealed kettle filled with a liquid such as water, oil, tar, or tallow, and a hook and pulley system. Instances of boiling alive as a legal punishment were quite rare and infrequent compared to other forms of execution, such as drowning.

==Historical practice==
===Europe===

In England, the use of boiling alive as a method of execution was rare. The ninth statute passed in 1531 (the 22nd year of the reign of King Henry VIII) made boiling alive the prescriptive form of capital punishment for murder committed by poisoning, which by the same Act was defined as high treason. This arose from a February 1531 incident in which the Bishop of Rochester&#x27;s cook, Richard Roose, gave several people poisoned porridge, resulting in two deaths. A partial confession having been extracted by torture, the sentence was thus imposed by attainder and without benefit of clergy. His execution took place on April 15, 1532, at Smithfield. A contemporary chronicle reports the following:

Boiling to death was employed again in 1542 for a woman, Margaret Davy, who had also used poison. During the reign of Edward VI, in 1547, the 1531 act was repealed.

Numerous people have been boiled to death in Scotland. For example, with the consent of Jon Haraldsson, the &quot;Bloody Earl&quot; of Orkney, the bishop of Caithness, Adam of Melrose, and a monk named Surlo are said to have been boiled to death by angry husbandmen in 1222 over the bishop&#x27;s aggressive means of collecting tithes. Alexander II is said to have executed upwards of eighty persons as a punishment for killing the bishop and monk, and the earl fled his lands. But according to the &quot;Melrose Chronicle&quot;, Adam of Melrose was &quot;burned alive&quot;, rather than boiled, and Alexander II executed up to 400 for the crime against the clergy. 

William de Soules, a nobleman involved in a conspiracy against Robert the Bruce, was reputed to be a sorcerer consorting with evil spirits, and was boiled alive in 1321 at Ninestane Rig. Around 1420, Melville, the sheriff of the Mearns and laird of Glenbervie, who was resented for his strictness, was apprehended by some other nobles and thrown into the kettle. The nobles are said to have each taken a spoonful of the brew afterwards.

Boiling as an execution method was also used for counterfeiters, swindlers and coin forgers during the Middle Ages. In the Holy Roman Empire, for example, being boiled to death in oil is recorded for coin forgers and extremely grave murderers. In 1392, a man was boiled alive in Nuremberg for having raped and murdered his own mother. Coin forgers were boiled to death in 1452 in Danzig and in 1471 in Stralsund. Even as late as 1687, a man in Bremen was boiled to death in oil for having been of valuable help to some coin forgers who had escaped justice.

In the Dutch town of Deventer, the kettle that was used for boiling criminals to death can still be seen.

===Asia===

In 16th-century Japan, the semi-legendary Japanese bandit Ishikawa Goemon and his son were boiled alive in the 1590s by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In 1675, a Sikh martyr called Bhai Dayala was boiled to death in Delhi after he refused to convert to Islam. He was put into a cauldron full of cold water which was then heated to boiling point. Sikh scriptures record that Dayala recited the Japji of Guru Nanak and the Sukhmani of Guru Arjan as he died.

===Americas===

Thomas Ewbank relates in his 1856 book &quot;Life in Brazil&quot; that he was told of an enslaved Afro-Brazilian being publicly boiled to death by a plantation owner as punishment for acts of insubordination.

===Modern times===
The government of Uzbekistan under Islam Karimov (1991–2016) has been alleged to have boiled suspected terrorists.

In a United States Department of State document from 2004, the following is written:Former ISIS commander Abu Abboud al-Raqqawi referred to ISIS&#x27;s brutal execution methods, among which was boiling prisoners alive in engine oil:
In the 2010 documentary &quot;El Sicario, Room 164&quot;, the masked sicario interviewee claims that the Mexican cartels boil in oil those found to be working for the police.

==Depictions in Western culture==
Early reports of cannibals from places in the Pacific, such as Fiji and Papua New Guinea, killing Western Christian missionaries were assumed to involve some form of boiling alive. This became a fertile ground for film makers and especially cartoonists, whose clichéd depiction of tourists or missionaries sitting restrained in a large cauldron above a wood fire and surrounded by bone-nosed tribesmen was a staple of popular magazines and films for decades. Examples include the 1980 television miniseries &quot;Shōgun&quot;, the 1985 film adaptation of &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; and the dream sequence in the film &quot;Bagdad Café&quot;.

Fromental Halévy&#x27;s 1835 opera &quot;La Juive &quot;ends with Rachel (the title character) being boiled alive in a vat of oil after her relationship with the Christian prince Léopold is discovered by antisemitic state and church authorities.

<doc id="1309152" wikidata="Q3279578" url="?curid=1309152" title="Maison de Soul">
<text>Maison de Soul is a Louisiana-based Zydeco and blues record label. It was founded in 1974 in Ville Platte, Louisiana by Floyd Soileau and remains under his ownership. It is one of four record labels under Soileau&#x27;s Flat Town Music Company umbrella, and combined the Flat Town labels make up &quot;the largest body of Cajun, zydeco, and swamp music in the world&quot;. &quot;Living Blues&quot; magazine has called Maison de Soul &quot;the country&#x27;s foremost zydeco label&quot;.

==Founding==

By 1974, Floyd Soileau had already established two other record labels, Jin Records and Swallow Records. Maison de Soul was founded in 1974 after a conversation between Soileau and zydeco star Clifton Chenier. Chenier had just finished recording a 1950s style album, when he shook his finger at Soileau and said &quot;You know, Floyd Soileau, zydeco is where it&#x27;s at. It&#x27;s coming on strong, and you better get with it.&quot; Soileau took Chenier&#x27;s advice and founded Maison de Soul, which was the first record label dedicated to producing zydeco music. Some of the early 45 RPM single releases featured New Orleans rhythm and blues artists such as Professor Longhair, Dr. John, and Johnny Adams, but after the label began producing LPs and CDs, the artist roster was comprised almost exclusively of zydeco musicians.

As a small, independent record label, Maison de Soul shares some of the same problems as other similar labels: getting the product to distributors and on the shelves of record stores, as well as getting their acts known. As a form of ethnic music, many potential buyers of zydeco aren&#x27;t always familiar with the artists or their musical styles, so Maison de Soul has had success with issuing compilation albums by various artists, the best-selling one titled &quot;Zydeco Festival&quot; (1988). Some of these compilation albums have included a few Cajun musicians, although they are primarily focused on zydeco.

Soileau said that zydeco music sales in general and for Maison de Soul in particular were enhanced by the popularity of the 1987 film &quot;The Big Easy&quot;, which was set in and shot on location in New Orleans. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released on Island Records and featured several zydeco and Cajun music artists, as well as New Orleans R&amp;B and gospel groups.

In addition to the market in Louisiana, Maison de Soul has exported its zydeco sound to the US East Coast and California, as well as Australia, Canada, and Europe. Soileau says sales are enhanced in areas where alternative radio stations have Louisiana &quot;gumbo&quot; type of programming.

Some of the top names in the Maison de Soul catalog are Clifton Chenier, Rockin&#x27; Dopsie, Boozoo Chavis, John Delafose, the band Zydeco Force, Willis Prudhomme, Lynn August, and Rockin&#x27; Sidney.

==&quot;My Toot Toot&quot;==

Maison de Soul had its biggest hit with the Rockin&#x27; Sidney song &quot;My Toot Toot&quot;, released on Sidney&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;My Zydeco Shoes Got the Zydeco Blues&quot;. The song was subsequently released as a single in January 1985 in Louisiana and Texas, and became a regional hit. The original recording was later leased to Epic Records who released it nationally, and made it to the Country Top 40 charts where it remained for 18 weeks. It was the first zydeco song to receive major airplay on pop, rock and country radio stations. Later in 1985, &quot;My Toot Toot&quot; was certified platinum and won the 1986 Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording. The song has been covered by artists as varied as Fats Domino, Rosie Ledet, Jean Knight, Terrance Simien, Doug Kershaw, Denise LaSalle, Jimmy C. Newman and John Fogerty. A Spanish version titled &quot;Mi Cu-Cu&quot; by La Sonora Dinamita sold over a million copies in Mexico, Central America, and South America and was a top-played song in the Latino radio market as late as 2011. A German beer company licensed it to use in their radio and television commercials. Decades after &quot;My Toot Toot&quot; debuted, it continued to draw royalties from commercial use in Europe, as well as earnings from cover versions in several languages by dozens of musicians.

<text>George A. Cárdenas (born October 9, 1964) was Alderman of the 12th Ward of the City of Chicago. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected to his first term on the Chicago City Council in 2003. He was elected commissioner of the 1st district of the Cook County Board of Review in the 2022 election, and subsequently resigned from the City Council.

== Early life ==
Cardenas was born in Santiago Papasquiaro in the mountains of northern Mexico. Cardenas and his family moved to Chicago in 1978 where he attended Lane Tech High School. After graduation, he joined the United States Navy for four years. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Northeastern Illinois University and went on to work as an auditor and a substitute teacher in public schools. Cardenas later became a tax and business consultant and went back to school to earn his master&#x27;s degree in political science from Northeastern Illinois University.

== Election ==
Cardenas first ran for alderman in 2003. Cardenas was supported by the powerful Hispanic Democratic Organization, a group with strong ties to Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. In a 3-way race in February 2003, Cardenas and incumbent Alderman Ray Frias were the top two vote-getters, but neither earned a majority, forcing a run-off election scheduled for April 2003. Frias withdrew his candidacy prior to the run-off, cancelling the run-off, and leaving Cardenas as the winner.

== Aldermanic career ==
Cardenas has won reelection in 2007, 2011, 2015, and 2019. Cardenas currently serves as the City Council Deputy Floor Leader and Chair of the Committee on Environmental Protection and Energy. He is also a member of eight committees: Committees, Rules &amp; Ethics; Finance, Budget, Contracting Oversight and Equity, Economic Capital and Technology Development, Immigrant and Refugee Rights, License and Consumer Protection and Pedestrian and Traffic Safety.

In 2006, Cardenas lost to Ald. Ricardo Muñoz in the race for state central committeeman for Illinois&#x27; 4th Congressional District, a Democratic Party post.

In the runoff of the 2019 Chicago mayoral election, Cardenas endorsed Lori Lightfoot.

Cardenas served as a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention.

==Cook County Board of Review==
He was elected commissioner of the 1st district of the Cook County Board of Review in the 2022 election, and subsequently resigned from the City Council to assume his seat.

== Professional career ==
Before joining government, Cardenas accumulated over a decade of experience working for Fortune 500 companies, including Centel Corporation, McDonald&#x27;s Corporation, Andersen Worldwide, Tenneco Corporation, Ameritech/SBC Corporation.

== Personal life ==
Cardenas lives with his wife and three daughters in McKinley Park.

<text>Henry Nelson Carroll (December 21, 1937 – June 19, 2015) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1986, initially as a New Democrat but subsequently as an independent.

Carroll was educated at the University of Manitoba, and practiced as a lawyer after being called to the bar in 1964. He first ran for the provincial legislature in the election of 1973 as a New Democrat, finishing second to Progressive Conservative Edward McGill in Brandon West. He ran for the seat again in the provincial election of 1977, with the same result.

McGill did not seek re-election in the provincial election of 1981, and Carroll was able to take the seat on his third try, defeating Tory candidate John Allen by about 400 votes. The NDP under Howard Pawley won a majority government in this election, and Carroll entered the legislature as a government backbencher.

Soon after, he announced his decision to leave the NDP (on August 19, 1982) and subsequently opposed the Pawley government&#x27;s intentions to re-entrench French language services in provincial law. He did not seek re-election in 1986.

In the federal election of 1988, Carroll ran as a candidate of the Reform Party in the riding of Brandon—Souris. He finished in fourth place, well behind victorious Progressive Conservative candidate Lee Clark. He has not attempted to re-enter provincial or federal politics since then.

Carroll was disbarred as a lawyer in Brandon in 2008. He died on June 19, 2015, at the age of 77.

<text>&quot;He&#x27;s Alive&quot; is episode four of the fourth season of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. It tells of an American neo-Nazi who is visited by the ghost of Adolf Hitler. Writer Rod Serling scripted a longer version of the teleplay to be made into a feature-length film, but it was never produced. This episode is notable for Dennis Hopper&#x27;s breakout performance as Peter Vollmer.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Peter Vollmer, the leader of a small and struggling Neo-Nazi group, is mocked and ridiculed by the crowds he preaches to on street corners. Ernst Ganz, the elderly Jewish man that Vollmer has had a sympathetic, uncle-like relationship with since he was an abused and neglected kid, offers him shelter and compassion but not respect. Ernst spent nine years in Dachau and recognizes that Vollmer&#x27;s politics stem from a childish desire for the respect of others. This pains Vollmer, who openly confesses that he views Ernst as a father figure, since his real father physically abused him and his mother was never around.

Beginning one night, Vollmer is periodically visited by a shadowy figure who teaches him how to enthrall a crowd. The figure teaches Vollmer how to speak, and pays Vollmer&#x27;s rent at the hall where he holds rallies. He also instructs Vollmer to arrange the death of one of his followers, Nick Bloss, thereby creating a martyr to rally everyone around (a reference to the 1930 murder of Horst Wessel, a low-ranking officer in the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot;). Following the figure&#x27;s instructions and assistance, Vollmer becomes considerably more successful and his group&#x27;s following grows. Ernst becomes fearful that Vollmer may actually succeed in igniting another Holocaust. He disrupts a rally, accusing Vollmer of being &quot;nothing but a cheap copy&quot; of the German Führer while Vollmer cowers before his surrogate father.

After the failed rally, the shadowy figure rebukes Vollmer for his failure and says that from now on he will be ordering Vollmer rather than instructing him. Vollmer demands to know who his mysterious benefactor is. The man steps forward from the shadows to reveal himself to be Adolf Hitler. He orders Vollmer to kill Ernst, and Vollmer steels himself enough to complete the task. Hitler congratulates him and asks how it felt; Vollmer replies that he felt immortal. Hitler responds, &quot;Mr. Vollmer, we &quot;are&quot; immortal!&quot;

Police officers arrive soon after, to arrest Vollmer for conspiracy to murder Nick. Shot while fleeing, Vollmer is astonished by the sight of his own blood. Hitler&#x27;s shadow appears on the wall behind Vollmer as he gasps out, &quot;There&#x27;s something very wrong here... &quot;Don&#x27;t you understand that I&#x27;m made out of steel?!&quot;&quot; As Vollmer dies, alone and forgotten, Hitler&#x27;s shadow slinks away to search for a new mouthpiece.

==Closing narration==
==Production==
Rod Serling was particularly pleased with the script for &quot;He&#x27;s Alive&quot;, and was dismayed when he learned that a scene set between Hitler&#x27;s revealing himself and Vollmer&#x27;s returning to Hitler was cut due to length constraints. This prompted the idea of doing two versions of &quot;He&#x27;s Alive&quot;: a short version for television, and a longer version for theatrical release as a feature film. His extended script added a number of scenes and even a new protagonist, an FBI agent who investigates Vollmer&#x27;s neo-Nazi movement, but with &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; budget already stretched to the breaking point, Serling&#x27;s proposal was turned down. The scene following Hitler revealing himself was filmed, but the footage has since been lost.

<doc id="1309196" wikidata="Q849305" url="?curid=1309196" title="Gradual">
<text>The gradual ( or ) is a certain chant or hymn in liturgical Christian worship. It is practiced in the Catholic Mass, Lutheran Divine Service, Anglican service and other traditions. It gets its name from the Latin (meaning &quot;step&quot;) because it was once chanted on the step of the ambo or altar. It is customarily placed after a reading of scripture.

In the Tridentine Mass, it is sung after the reading or chanting of the epistle and before the Alleluia, or, during penitential seasons, before the tract. In the Mass of Paul VI, the gradual is usually replaced with the responsorial psalm. Although the Gradual remains an option in the Mass of Paul VI, its use is extremely rare outside monasteries. The gradual is part of the proper of the Mass.

A gradual can also refer to a book collecting all the musical items of the Mass. The official such book for the Roman Rite is the Roman Gradual (). Other such books include the Dominican Gradual.

==History==

The Gradual, like the Alleluia and Tract, is one of the responsorial chants of the Mass. Responsorial chants derive from early Christian traditions of singing choral refrains called &quot;responds&quot; between psalm verses. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, it (and the associated Alleluia or Tract) is the oldest of the chants of the Proper of the Mass, and, in contrast to the Introit, Offertory, and Communion, the only one that was not sung to accompany some other liturgical action, historically a procession. Until about the fifth century, it included singing a whole psalm. They were sung in the form of a &quot;psalmus responsorius&quot;, i.e. the whole text was chanted by a reader appointed for this purpose. For some time before Pope Gregory I, to sing these psalms was a privilege of deacons at Rome, a privilege he suppressed in 595. The people answered each clause or verse with an acclamation. This apparently dates back to the synagogue tradition, and can even be seen in the structure of some Psalms (such as 136|135). Originally, there was a psalm sung between each reading, of which in the fifth century there were three (Prophets, Epistle, and Gospel). When the Old Testament reading was later dropped, the other two psalms became the Gradual and Alleluia, ordinarily sung one after another, until the 1970 Missal restored the three readings on Sundays and Solemnities.

The modern Gradual always consists of two psalm verses, generally (but not always) taken from the same psalm. There are a few Graduals that use a book of scripture other than the Psalms (for example, the verse for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception is from the Book of Judith), or even non-scriptural verses (for example, the first verse in the Requiem Mass).

The Gradual is believed to have been so named because it was sung on the step (Latin: &quot;gradus&quot;) of the altar, or perhaps because the deacon was mounting the steps of the ambo for the reading or singing of the Gospel. However, early sources use the form &quot;gradale&quot; (&quot;graded&quot; or &quot;distinguished&quot;), and the &quot;Alia Musica&quot; (c. 900) uses the term &quot;antiphona gradalis&quot; for the Introit.

==Liturgical use==
The Gradual is to be sung after the reading of the Epistle. It is ordinarily followed by the Alleluia or Tract, but in Masses that have more readings than normal, such as during Lent, these may be separated by another reading, or, if there are more than three readings, there is more than one Gradual, and finally the Tract, to separate each reading. In Eastertide, the Gradual is normally omitted, and a second Alleluia is sung in its place, except within the Octave of Easter. In what is now the ordinary form of the Roman Rite, the Responsorial Psalm normally takes the place of the Gradual, and is sung after the first reading, but it may be replaced by the Gradual.

In the Tridentine Mass, the celebrant himself reads the Gradual with the Alleluia, Tract, or Sequence immediately after he has read the Epistle, and at the same place, even if the choir sings it too. There is no rule for the distribution of its parts within the choir. All may be sung straight through by the whole choir, but it is more common to divide the texts so that some parts are sung by one or two cantors. A common arrangement is that the cantors sing the first words of the Gradual (to the asterisk in the choir-books), the choir continues, and the cantors sing the verse. Normally it is all sung to plainsong.

In other churches and rites, there are fragments of the psalms once sung between the lessons that correspond to the Roman Gradual. Their placement and structure depend strongly on how many readings there are. In the Byzantine Rite the reader of the epistle first chants &quot;the Psalm of David&quot; and then the &quot;Prokeimenon of the Apostle&quot;, both short fragments of psalms. The Armenian Rite, which has kept the older arrangement of three lessons, includes between each a fragment called the &quot;Saghmos Jashu&quot; (Psalm of dinnertime) and the &quot;Mesedi&quot; (mesodion), again a verse or two from a psalm. The Nestorians use three verses of psalms each followed by three Alleluias (this group is called &quot;Zumara&quot;) after the Epistle. The present Ambrosian Rite sometimes has a Prophecy before the Epistle, in which case there follows the &quot;Psalmellus&quot;, two or three verses from a psalm, which corresponds to the Gradual. The Mozarabic Rite has three lessons, with a psalm (&quot;Psallendo&quot;) sung between the first two. Among Protestant churches, Lutherans sing a Gradual either between the Old Testament and the Epistle or the Epistle and the Gospel readings during the Divine Service.

==Musical form and style==
The usual form of the Gradual is a single respond with a solo verse, although a final repetition of the respond was found up to the Renaissance and is still permitted by the &quot;Liber usualis&quot;.

Graduals are among the most florid and melismatic of all Gregorian chants; &quot;Clamaverunt iusti&quot;, for example, has melismas with up to 66 notes. Graduals as a group are also notable for melismas that stress one or two pitches, both through repeated notes and repercussive neumes. Both the verse and the respond tend to be similar in style, excepting a tendency for the verse to have a higher tessitura.

Like Tracts, most Graduals show clear signs of centonization, a process of composition in which an extended vocabulary of stock musical phrases are woven together. Some phrases are only used for incipits, some only for cadences, and some only in the middle of a musical line. The Gregorian Graduals can be organized into musical families that share common musical phrases. Although nearly half of the Gregorian Graduals belong to a family of related chants in the fifth mode, the most famous family of Graduals are those of the second mode, commonly called the &quot;Iustus ut palma&quot; group after one representative chant. The Graduals of the Old Roman chant fall similarly into centonization families, including a family corresponding to the &quot;Iustus ut palma&quot; group.

==Polyphonic settings==
Graduals were among the parts of the Mass most frequently composed as organa, including both the St. Martial School and the Notre Dame School. Ordinarily the parts that were sung by the soloist (the beginning of the respond and the verse) are the only parts so set, while the choral parts continued to be performed in plainsong. In 1198, Odo de Sully, Bishop of Paris, authorized polyphonic performances of Graduals, including Pérotin&#x27;s famous four-part organa, &quot;Sederunt principes&quot; for St. Stephen&#x27;s Day and &quot;Viderunt omnes&quot; for Christmas.

==Book==

The term &quot;Gradual&quot; (or &quot;Graduale&quot;) also refers to certain books compiling the musical items of the Mass. A Gradual is generally distinguished from the Missal by omitting the spoken items, and including the music for the sung parts. It includes both the Ordinary and Proper, as opposed to the Kyrial, which includes only the Ordinary, and the Cantatory, which includes only the responsorial chants.

Originally the book was called an &quot;antiphonale missarum&quot; (&quot;Antiphonal of the Mass&quot;). Graduals, like the later Cantatory, may have originally included only the responsorial items, the Gradual, Alleluia and Tract.

<text>Frank J. Olivo was alderman of the 13th ward of the City of Chicago.

==Alderman career==
As Alderman of the 13th ward, Olivo co-founded the Graffiti Removal Program designed to combat crime, and the Real Estate Anti-Solicitation Program to protect the value of homes.
Olivo serves on seven committees: Aviation; Budget and Government Operations; Committees, Rules, and Ethics; Finance; License and Consumer Protection; Traffic Control and Safety, and Zoning.

Olivo was the only alderman to report receiving gifts valued at more than $500 in 2006 on their required annual ethics disclosures. A die-hard White Sox fan, Olivo reported receiving: 68 Sox tickets valued at $2,556 and 22 &quot;package passes&quot; worth $308; 13 Chicago Bulls tickets valued at $1,315; $420 worth of St. Louis Cardinals tickets; $114 worth of Milwaukee Brewers tickets and 26 Chicago Cubs tickets and four package passes valued at $1,751.

Olivo co-sponsored a proposed amendment (PO2007-7206) to the Municipal Code of Chicago prohibiting the sale or possession of live chickens in residential districts in Chicago, which was introduced to the Chicago City Council and referred to the City Council&#x27;s Committee on Health on September 27, 2007.

In 2008 Olivo was found to be one of seven Chicago aldermen who between them got ten of their children good-paying summer jobs with the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago.

==Professional career==
Olivo served as a member of the Secretary of State&#x27;s Motor Vehicle Review Board, a paid position on a board that mediates disputes between car dealers and manufacturers.

<doc id="1309209" wikidata="Q78603928" url="?curid=1309209" title="Lambda Scorpii">
<text>Lambda Scorpii is a triple star system and the second-brightest object in the constellation of Scorpius. It is formally named Shaula; &quot;Lambda Scorpii&quot; is its Bayer designation, which is Latinised from λ Scorpii and abbreviated Lambda Sco or λ Sco. With an apparent visual magnitude of 1.62, it is one of the brightest stars in the night sky.

==Nomenclature==

&quot;λ Scorpii&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Lambda Scorpii&quot;) is the star system&#x27;s Bayer designation.

It bore the traditional name &quot;Shaula&quot;, which comes from the Arabic الشولاء &quot;al-šawlā´&quot; meaning &#x27;the raised [tail]&#x27;, as it is found in the tail of Scorpius, the scorpion. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN, which included &quot;Shaula&quot; for the star λ Scorpii Aa.

In Indian Astronomy it is called MulA Nakshathram. Mūla (&quot;root&quot;) (Devanagari मूल/मूळ) (Tamil: மூலம்) is the 19th nakshatra or &quot;lunar mansion&quot; in Vedic astrology. The symbol of Mula is a bunch of roots tied together (reticulated roots) or an &#x27;elephant goad&#x27; (ankusha).

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;Tail&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of λ Scorpii, ε Scorpii, ζ1 Scorpii, ζ2 Scorpii, η Scorpii, θ Scorpii, ι1 Scorpii, ι2 Scorpii, κ Scorpii, μ1 Scorpii, and υ Scorpii. Consequently, the Chinese name for λ Scorpii itself is (), &quot;the Eighth Star of Tail&quot;.

Together with υ Scorpii (Lesath), Shaula is listed in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN as dSharur4 u dShargaz, meaning &quot;Sharur and Shargaz&quot;.

In Coptic, they were called &quot;Minamref&quot;.

The indigenous Boorong people of northwestern Victoria (Australia) named it (together with Upsilon Scorpii) &quot;Karik Karik&quot;, &quot;the Falcons&quot;.

==Properties==

Lambda Scorpii is located some 570 light-years away from the Sun.

Spectroscopic and interferometric observations have shown that it is actually a triple star system consisting of two B-type stars and a pre-main-sequence star. The primary star is a Beta Cephei variable star with rapid brightness changes of about a hundredth of a magnitude. The pre-main-sequence star has an orbital period of 6 days and the B companion has a period of 1053 days. The three stars lie in the same orbital plane, strongly suggesting that they were formed at the same time. The masses of the primary, pre-main-sequence star and the B companion are 14.5, 2.0 and 10.6 solar masses, respectively. The age of the system is estimated to be in the range 10–13 million years.

A 15th-magnitude star has a separation of 42 arcseconds, whereas a 12th-magnitude star is 95 arcseconds away. It is not known whether or not these components are physically associated with Lambda Scorpii. If they both were, the first would have a projected linear separation of approximately 7,500 astronomical units (AU) and the second approximately 17,000 AU (0.27 light-years) away. Gaia Data Release 3 reports that the fainter of these two stars is a little larger and brighter than the sun and about 420 light years away, while the brighter star is a luminous background object.

==In culture==

Shaula appears on the flag of Brazil, symbolizing the state of Rio Grande do Norte.

USS &quot;Shaula&quot; (AK-118) was a U.S. Navy &quot;Crater&quot;-class cargo ship named after the star.

<doc id="1309220" wikidata="Q1660484" url="?curid=1309220" title="Imputation (statistics)">
<text>In statistics, imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values. When substituting for a data point, it is known as &quot;unit imputation&quot;; when substituting for a component of a data point, it is known as &quot;item imputation&quot;. There are three main problems that missing data causes: missing data can introduce a substantial amount of bias, make the handling and analysis of the data more , and create reductions in efficiency. Because missing data can create problems for analyzing data, imputation is seen as a way to avoid pitfalls involved with listwise deletion of cases that have missing values. That is to say, when one or more values are missing for a case, most statistical packages default to discarding any case that has a missing value, which may introduce bias or affect the representativeness of the results. Imputation preserves all cases by replacing missing data with an estimated value based on other available information. Once all missing values have been imputed, the data set can then be analysed using standard techniques for complete data. There have been many theories embraced by scientists to account for missing data but the majority of them introduce bias. A few of the well known attempts to deal with missing data include: hot deck and cold deck imputation; listwise and pairwise deletion; mean imputation; non-negative matrix factorization; regression imputation; last observation carried forward; stochastic imputation; and multiple imputation.

== Listwise (complete case) deletion ==

By far, the most common means of dealing with missing data is listwise deletion (also known as complete case), which is when all cases with a missing value are deleted. If the data are missing completely at random, then listwise deletion does not add any bias, but it does decrease the power of the analysis by decreasing the effective sample size. For example, if 1000 cases are collected but 80 have missing values, the effective sample size after listwise deletion is 920. If the cases are not missing completely at random, then listwise deletion will introduce bias because the sub-sample of cases represented by the missing data are not representative of the original sample (and if the original sample was itself a representative sample of a population, the complete cases are not representative of that population either). While listwise deletion is unbiased when the missing data is missing completely at random, this is rarely the case in actuality.

Pairwise deletion (or &quot;available case analysis&quot;) involves deleting a case when it is missing a variable required for a particular analysis, but including that case in analyses for which all required variables are present. When pairwise deletion is used, the total N for analysis will not be consistent across parameter estimations. Because of the incomplete N values at some points in time, while still maintaining complete case comparison for other parameters, pairwise deletion can introduce impossible mathematical situations such as correlations that are over 100%.

The one advantage complete case deletion has over other methods is that it is straightforward and easy to implement. This is a large reason why complete case is the most popular method of handling missing data in spite of the many disadvantages it has.

==Single imputation==
===Hot-deck===
A once-common method of imputation was hot-deck imputation where a missing value was imputed from a randomly selected similar record. The term &quot;hot deck&quot; dates back to the storage of data on punched cards, and indicates that the information donors come from the same dataset as the recipients. The stack of cards was &quot;hot&quot; because it was currently being processed.

One form of hot-deck imputation is called &quot;last observation carried forward&quot; (or LOCF for short), which involves sorting a dataset according to any of a number of variables, thus creating an ordered dataset. The technique then finds the first missing value and uses the cell value immediately prior to the data that are missing to impute the missing value. The process is repeated for the next cell with a missing value until all missing values have been imputed. In the common scenario in which the cases are repeated measurements of a variable for a person or other entity, this represents the belief that if a measurement is missing, the best guess is that it hasn&#x27;t changed from the last time it was measured. This method is known to increase risk of increasing bias and potentially false conclusions. For this reason LOCF is not recommended for use.

===Cold-deck===
Cold-deck imputation, by contrast, selects donors from another dataset. Due to advances in computer power, more sophisticated methods of imputation have generally superseded the original random and sorted hot deck imputation techniques. It is a method of replacing with response values of similar items in past surveys. It is available in surveys that measure time intervals.

===Mean substitution===
Another imputation technique involves replacing any missing value with the mean of that variable for all other cases, which has the benefit of not changing the sample mean for that variable. However, mean imputation attenuates any correlations involving the variable(s) that are imputed. This is because, in cases with imputation, there is guaranteed to be no relationship between the imputed variable and any other measured variables. Thus, mean imputation has some attractive properties for univariate analysis but becomes problematic for multivariate analysis.

Mean imputation can be carried out within classes (i.e. categories such as gender), and can be expressed as formula_1 where formula_2 is the imputed value for record formula_3 and formula_4 is the sample mean of respondent data within some class formula_5. This is a special case of generalized regression imputation:

formula_6

Here the values formula_7 are estimated from regressing formula_8 on formula_9 in non-imputed data, formula_10 is a dummy variable for class membership, and data are split into respondent (formula_11) and missing (formula_12).

===Non-negative matrix factorization===
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) can take missing data while minimizing its cost function, rather than treating these missing data as zeros that could introduce biases. This makes it a mathematically proven method for data imputation. NMF can ignore missing data in the cost function, and the impact from missing data can be as small as a second order effect.

===Regression===
Regression imputation has the opposite problem of mean imputation. A regression model is estimated to predict observed values of a variable based on other variables, and that model is then used to impute values in cases where the value of that variable is missing. In other words, available information for complete and incomplete cases is used to predict the value of a specific variable. Fitted values from the regression model are then used to impute the missing values. The problem is that the imputed data do not have an error term included in their estimation, thus the estimates fit perfectly along the regression line without any residual variance. This causes relationships to be over identified and suggest greater precision in the imputed values than is warranted. The regression model predicts the most likely value of missing data but does not supply uncertainty about that value.

Stochastic regression was a fairly successful attempt to correct the lack of an error term in regression imputation by adding the average regression variance to the regression imputations to introduce error. Stochastic regression shows much less bias than the above-mentioned techniques, but it still missed one thing – if data are imputed then intuitively one would think that more noise should be introduced to the problem than simple residual variance.

==Multiple imputation==
In order to deal with the problem of increased noise due to imputation, Rubin (1987) developed a method for averaging the outcomes across multiple imputed data sets to account for this. All multiple imputation methods follow three steps.
# Imputation – Similar to single imputation, missing values are imputed. However, the imputed values are drawn &quot;m&quot; times from a distribution rather than just once. At the end of this step, there should be &quot;m&quot; completed datasets.
# Analysis – Each of the &quot;m&quot; datasets is analyzed. At the end of this step there should be &quot;m&quot; analyses.
# Pooling – The &quot;m&quot; results are consolidated into one result by calculating the mean, variance, and confidence interval of the variable of concern or by combining simulations from each separate model.

Multiple imputation can be used in cases where the data are missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random, though it can be biased in the latter case. One approach is multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE), also known as &quot;fully conditional specification&quot; and &quot;sequential regression multiple imputation.&quot; MICE is designed for missing at random data, though there is simulation evidence to suggest that with a sufficient number of auxiliary variables it can also work on data that are missing not at random. However, MICE can suffer from performance problems when the number of observation is large and the data have complex features, such as nonlinearities and high dimensionality.

More recent approaches to multiple imputation use machine learning techniques to improve its performance. MIDAS (Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoders), for instance, uses denoising autoencoders, a type of unsupervised neural network, to learn fine-grained latent representations of the observed data. MIDAS has been shown to provide accuracy and efficiency advantages over traditional multiple imputation strategies.

As alluded in the previous section, single imputation does not take into account the uncertainty in the imputations. After imputation, the data is treated as if they were the actual real values in single imputation. The negligence of uncertainty in the imputation can lead to overly precise results and errors in any conclusions drawn. By imputing multiple times, multiple imputation accounts for the uncertainty and range of values that the true value could have taken. As expected, the combination of both uncertainty estimation and deep learning for imputation is among the best strategies and has been used to model heterogeneous drug discovery data.

Additionally, while single imputation and complete case are easier to implement, multiple imputation is not very difficult to implement. There are a wide range of statistical packages in different statistical software that readily performs multiple imputation. For example, the MICE package allows users in R to perform multiple imputation using the MICE method. MIDAS can be implemented in R with the rMIDAS package and in Python with the MIDASpy package.

<text>The Pippinids and the Arnulfings were two Frankish aristocratic families from Austrasia during the Merovingian period. They dominated the office of mayor of the palace after 687 and eventually supplanted the Merovingians as kings in 751, founding the Carolingian dynasty.

The names &quot;Pippinid&quot; and &quot;Arnulfing&quot; are modern conventions, reflecting the families&#x27; descent from two contemporaries, Arnulf of Metz (died c. 640) and Pippin of Landen (died 640). The recurrence of the leading name Pippin in the family led the anonymous author of the &quot;Annals of Metz&quot; (c. 805) to call the family &quot;Pippinios&quot;, the earliest known designation for the family. In a strict sense, the Pippinids are the descendants of Pippin of Landen and the Arnulfings those of Arnulf of Metz. These groups only overlap via the marriage of Arnulf&#x27;s son Ansegisel and Pippin&#x27;s daughter Begga and their son, Pippin of Herstal and his descendants.

Since the late eighth century, the rise of the family has been depicted as the defining feature of the late Merovingian period, with the kings portrayed as &quot;rois fainéants&quot; (&quot;do-nothing kings&quot;), puppets of their mayors. This theme has been continued in modern historiography. Some have even suggested that the Pippinids and Arnulfings followed a &quot;long-term strategy&quot; to seize power. Following his victory at the Battle of Tertry in 687, Pippin of Herstal extended his influence into Neustria. His death in 714 was followed by years of civil war between his successors. By 718, his younger son Charles Martel had taken control of both Austrasia and Neustria. His descendants are the Carolingians proper, although some historians apply this label as far back as the marriage of Ansegisel and Begga. The descendants of Charles&#x27;s brother, Childebrand, on the other hand, are known as the Nibelungids.

<text>The River Amber is a left bank tributary of the River Derwent in Derbyshire, England. 
It gives its name to the local government district and borough of Amber Valley.

The name Amber is a pre-Celtic word with uncertain meaning.

==Course==

Its source is close to the village of Ashover, near Clay Cross, and it flows southwards through Ogston Reservoir to Pentrich then turns westwards through Wingfield Park to join the River Derwent at Ambergate.

Like many such rivers flowing from the Derbyshire moors, it powered a number of water mills, many of them for crushing locally mined and quarried minerals, such as limestone.

The river valley also provided a route for the Cromford Canal, at the southern end as far as Butterley Tunnel, and the North Midland Railway, to travel northwards until it passed under Clay Cross via the Clay Cross Tunnel, where it entered the valley of the River Rother and then north to Chesterfield.

<doc id="1309245" wikidata="Q7233008" url="?curid=1309245" title="Poseidon bubble">
<text>The Poseidon bubble was a stock market bubble in which the price of Australian mining shares soared in late 1969, then crashed in early 1970. It was triggered by the discovery by Poseidon NL of the early indications of a promising nickel deposit in September 1969.

In the late 1960s, nickel was in high demand due to the Vietnam War, but there was a shortage of supply due to industrial action against the major Canadian supplier Inco. These factors pushed the price of nickel to record levels, peaking at around £7,000/ton (£113,000 in 2018 adjusted for inflation) on the London market early in November 1969. In September 1969, the mineral exploration company Poseidon NL made a major nickel discovery at Mount Windarra northwest of Laverton, Western Australia. In early September its shares, which had been trading at $0.80, began rising on insider trading (which was not illegal at the time). On 1 October, Poseidon announced that drilling had struck 40 metres of ore averaging 3.56% nickel and the share price immediately rose until Poseidon shares were trading at $12.30. After that, very little further information came to light but the price continued to climb on speculation. At one point, a UK broker suggested a value of up to $382 a share.

The price of Poseidon shares quickly became too high for many investors, so some turned to stocks in other companies exploring near Windarra, and eventually other nickel mining stocks in general. As the price of mining shares grew, new companies were listed by promoters hoping to cash in. From October to December 1969 the ASX All Mining index rose by 44%. Mining stocks peaked in January 1970, then immediately crashed. Poseidon shares peaked at an intraday high of $280 in February 1970, and fell rapidly thereafter.

By the time Poseidon actually started producing nickel, the price of nickel had fallen. Also, the nickel ore was of a lower grade than originally thought and extraction costs were higher. Profits from the mine were not sufficient to keep Poseidon afloat and it went into receivership in 1974. The company was delisted from the stock exchange in 1976. Western Mining then took over management of the mine, operating it until 1991. Mining ceased at Mount Windarra in 1989, and at South Windarra in 1991. Mount Windarra produced 5.3 million tonnes of ore grading 1.5% nickel during the life of the mine.

In 1974, the Rae Committee handed down its report on the Poseidon bubble, which documented numerous cases of improper trade practices. It recommended a number of changes to the regulation of stock markets, which ultimately led to Australia&#x27;s national companies and securities legislation.

Poseidon Limited entered receivership in September 1976, unable to meet its loan repayments but did survive its time in receivership and was relisted on the Australian stock market in December 1978. Poseidon eventually merged with Robert Champion de Crespigny-led Normandy Resources in 1991, with Poseidon being delisted on 8 May 1991 and the name company taking the name of Normandy Poseidon Limited.

<text>Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture; ; ), was formed of two separate schools: the faculty of architecture (previously part of the Helsinki University of Technology) and the University of Art and Design Helsinki (UIAH, known in Finnish as TaiK). TaiK, founded in 1871, was the largest art university in the Nordic countries. The university awards the following academic degrees: Bachelor of Science in Technology, Architect, Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Arts.

The university is known for its research projects and industrial collaborations. During the rectorship of Yrjö Sotamaa the university was active in integrating design into Finnish innovation and business networks. This eventually led to the decision to merge TaiK together with Helsinki University of Technology (TKK) and the Helsinki School of Economics (HSE) into a new charter university, Aalto University, which started in January 2010.

In the global QS World University Rankings in 2021, the Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture was placed 6th in the art and design subject area. In the field of architecture &amp; built environment Aalto was ranked 42nd.

Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture is a founding member of the Cumulus Association, a global association of higher education institutions in the fields of art, design and media.

== Organization ==
Degree programmes are organized under five departments:
* Department of Architecture
* Department of Art and Media, including the Aalto Media Lab
* Department of Design
* Department of Film, Television and Scenography

== Notable alumni ==
The school in its earlier incarnation as Taik educated many of the household names of Finnish art, design and cinema. Many alumni, such as Tapio Wirkkala and Kaj Franck have earned international acclaim for their work. The school of architecture, when part of Helsinki University of Technology, produced the foremost names in the history of modern Finnish architecture, most notably Signe Hornborg, Eliel Saarinen, Alvar Aalto – after whom the new university is named – Viljo Revell, Reima Pietilä, Timo Penttilä and Juhani Pallasmaa. Internationally acclaimed Marxist theorist and activist Franco Berardi defended his dissertation in the School of Arts, Design and Architecture in 2014. Raija Jokinen, Finnish Textile Artist of the Year 2020, graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in textile design in 1990.

== Väre building ==

Officially opening to the public in September 2018 the School School of Arts, Design and Architecture moved from Arabia Campus, located in the historical building of the Arabia ceramics factory, to the new Väre building in Otaniemi. Its construction began in late 2015 and was completed in summer 2018. The new building block also houses the metro station and a shopping centre.

<doc id="1309267" wikidata="Q775480" url="?curid=1309267" title="Chondrocyte">
<text>Chondrocytes (, ) are the only cells found in healthy cartilage. They produce and maintain the cartilaginous matrix, which consists mainly of collagen and proteoglycans. Although the word &quot;chondroblast&quot; is commonly used to describe an immature chondrocyte, the term is imprecise, since the progenitor of chondrocytes (which are mesenchymal stem cells) can differentiate into various cell types, including osteoblasts.

==Development==
From least- to terminally-differentiated, the chondrocytic lineage is:
# Colony-forming unit-fibroblast
# Mesenchymal stem cell / marrow stromal cell
# Chondrocyte
# Hypertrophic chondrocyte

Mesenchymal (mesoderm origin) stem cells are undifferentiated, meaning they can differentiate into a variety of generative cells commonly known as osteochondrogenic (or osteogenic, chondrogenic, osteoprogenitor, etc.) cells. When referring to bone, or in this case cartilage, the originally undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells lose their pluripotency, proliferate and crowd together in a dense aggregate of chondrogenic cells (cartilage) at the location of chondrification. These chondrogenic cells differentiate into so-called chondroblasts, which then synthesize the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM), consisting of a ground substance (proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans for low osmotic potential) and fibers. The chondroblast is now a mature chondrocyte that is usually inactive but can still secrete and degrade the matrix, depending on conditions.

Cell culture studies of excess Vitamin A inhibits the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate by chondrocytes and causes the inhibition of chondrogenesis in the developing embryo which may result in limb malformations.

Chondrocytes undergo terminal differentiation when they become hypertrophic, which happens during endochondral ossification. This last stage is characterized by major phenotypic changes in the cell.

== Structure ==
The chondrocyte in cartilage matrix has rounded or polygonal structure. The exception occurs at tissue boundaries, for example the articular surfaces of joints, in which chondrocytes may be flattened or discoid. Intra-cellular features are characteristic of a synthetically active cell. The cell density of full-thickness, human, adult, femoral condyle cartilage is maintained at 14.5 (±3.0) × 103 cells/ mm2 from age 20 to 30 years. Although chondrocyte senescence occurs with aging, mitotic figures are not seen in normal adult articular cartilage. The structure, density, and synthetic activity of an adult chondrocyte are various according to its position. Flattened cells are oriented parallel to the surface, along with the collagen fibers, in the superficial zone, the region of highest cell density. In the middle zone, chondrocytes are larger and more rounded and display a random distribution, in which the collagen fibers also are more randomly arranged. In the deeper zones, chondrocytes form columns that are oriented perpendicular to the cartilage surface, along with the collagen fibers. Different behaviors may be exhibited by chondrocytes depending on their position within the different layers. In primary chondrocyte cultures, these zonal differences in synthetic properties may persist. The primary cilia are significant for spatial orientation of cells in developing growth plate and are sensory organelles in chondrocytes. Primary cilia work as centers for wingless type (Wnt) and hedgehog signaling and contain mechanosensitive receptors.

== Genetics ==
The number of chondrocyte cells created and their maturation process can be influenced by multiple different genes and proteins. Two proteins, bone morphogenetic protein 4(BMP-4) and fibroblast growth factor 2(FGF2) have been seen to influence the amount of differentiation into chondrocytes. Both proteins are known to play a role in embryonic stem cell differentiation into mesodermal cells, through signaling with BMP-4 and as FGF2 acting as a stimulator. From the mesodermal germ layer, cells will continue to differentiate down into many different types of cells. On top of BMP-4 and FGF2 stimulating the mesodermal germ layer, treatment of these proteins has also been shown to amplify the number of cells that differentiate down into chondrogenic and osteogenic cells when cultured in chondrogenic and osteogenic mediums respectively. For chondrogenic cells, the treatment showed increased expression of the transcription factor Sox9, which plays a key role in chondrogenesis, the process of cartilage formation from condensed mesenchyme tissues, which then differentiate into chondrocytes.  

Endochondral ossification is the process by which most vertebrate axial skeletons form into hardened bones from cartilage. This process begins with a cartilage anlage where chondrocyte cells will congregate and start their maturation process. Once the chondrocytes have fully matured at the desired rate, the cartilage tissue will harden into bone. This process is similar across most vertebrates and is closely regulated due to the large importance of the skeleton in survival. Few deviations, misregulations, and mutations are found in organisms because they are often detrimental or lethal to the organism. This is why chondrocyte maturation is so tightly regulated. If they mature too quickly or slowly there is a large possibility the organism will not survive gestation or infancy.  One gene that is closely involved in skeletal formation is Xylt1. Normally, this gene is responsible for catalyzing the addition of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains to proteoglycans, which are used during cell signaling to control processes such as cell growth, proliferation, and adhesion. The two main proteoglycans that are used in this process are heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) which are present at high levels in the chondrocyte extracellular matrix and are crucial in regulating chondrocyte maturation. When the GAG chain functions properly, it controls the maturation speed of chondrocytes and ensures enough cells gather in the cartilage anlage. Xylt1 is an essential gene in regards to chondrocytes and proper skeletal formation, and is a key factor in the close regulation of maturation. However, the mutation &quot;pug&quot; of the Xylt1 gene was studied in mice in 2014 and was found to cause the pre-maturation of chondrocytes. Animals with homozygous &quot;pug&quot; alleles display dwarfism and have considerably shorter bones compared to wild-type animals. These organisms show a reduction of typical Xylt1 gene activity, as well as a reduction in GAG chain levels. This mutation causes fewer GAG chains to be added to HSPGs and CSPGs, meaning there are fewer complexes available to closely regulate the maturation of chondrocytes. Incorrect signals are sent to chondrocytes in the cartilage anlage because the GAG chain and proteoglycan complexes are unable to work properly and cause the chondrocytes to mature and ossify too quickly. The correct amount of chondrocytes are not able to gather in the cartilage anlage, leading to a shortage of cartilage for ossification and eventually shorter bones. 

While the &quot;pug&quot; mutation deals with the pre-maturation of chondrocytes, multiple other mutations alter chondrocyte proliferation. One such example, the point mutation G380R located on the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3(FGFR-3) gene leads to achondroplasia, a type of dwarfism. Achondroplasia is either caused through a spontaneous mutation or inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Both the homozygous dominant and the heterozygous genotypes exhibit achondroplasia symptoms, but the heterozygotes are often milder. Individuals with the mutated allele(s) display a variety of symptoms of the failure of endochondral ossification, including the shortening of proximal long limbs and midface hypoplasia. The non-mutated FGFR-3 gene is responsible for the expression of fibroblast growth factors(FGFs) which has to maintain a certain level to ensure that the proliferation of chondrocytes happens accordingly. The G380R mutation causes FGFR-3 to over express FGFs and the balance within the cartilage extracellular matrix is thrown off. Chondrocytes will proliferate too quickly and disrupt the assembly at the cartilage anlage and detrimentally alter the formation of bone. This mutation acts in a dosage fashion, meaning that when only one copy is present, there is still an uptake in FGF expression, but less so than when there are two copies of the mutation.

== Chondrocyte Primary Culture ==
Chondrocytes can be prepared by sequential enzymatic digestion of cartilage with Pronase and Collagenase and cultured in DMEM-F12 cell culture media.

== Medical uses ==
In Australia, Ortho-ACI, a suspension of cultured autologous chondrocytes, is indicated for use in the treatment of cartilage lesions associated with the knee, patella, and ankle.

<doc id="1309279" wikidata="Q73876" url="?curid=1309279" title="Wilhelm von Grumbach">
<text>Wilhelm von Grumbach (1 June 150318 April 1567) was a German adventurer, chiefly known through his connection with the so-called &quot;Grumbach Feud&quot; (), the last attempt of the Imperial Knights to prevail against the power of the territorial Princes of the Holy Roman Empire.

==Florian Geyer==
A member of the old Franconian noble family von Grumbach (a branch of the Wolfskeel &quot;Uradel&quot; family), Wilhelm was born in Rimpar near Würzburg, and having passed some time at the court of the Hohenzollern margrave Casimir of Bayreuth, fought alongside the princes during the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1524 and 1525.

In the aftermath of the Battle of Frankenhausen, peasant leader Florian Geyer was one of the last survivors of Thomas Müntzer&#x27;s army. On 9 June 1525, he was contacted in Würzburg by two servants of his brother-in-law Wilhelm von Grumbach (reportedly including Christoph Kretzen of the Grumbach-Zobel affair below), who had the stated intention of helping him rekindle the rebellion. While travelling together, they stabbed Geyer to death in the Gramschatz Forest near Grumbach&#x27;s hometown.

==Grumbach-Zobel Affair==
Around 1540, Grumbach became associated with Margrave Casimir&#x27;s son, the turbulent Albert Alcibiades of Bayreuth, whom he served both in peace and war. As a landholder, Grumbach was a vassal of the Würzburg Bishops and had held office at the court of Conrad von Bibra, who was elected Prince-Bishop in 1540. Just before his death in 1544, Conrad gave Grumbach 10,000 gold florins as a gift, without obtaining the consent of the cathedral chapter. When the new Prince-Bishop Melchior Zobel von Giebelstadt asked for the money back from Grumbach, he paid, but the harmonious relationship between lord and vassal were destroyed. Unable to free himself and his associates from the suzerainty of the bishop by appealing to the imperial courts he decided to adopt more violent measures, and his friendship with Margrave Albert was very serviceable in this connection.

After the conclusion of the Peace of Passau in 1552, Grumbach assisted Albert in his career of plunder in Franconia during the Second Margrave War and was thus able to take some revenge upon his enemy, Melchior Zobel. Albert&#x27;s career, however, was checked by his defeat at the Battle of Sievershausen in July 1553 and his subsequent flight to France, while the Würzburg bishop took advantage of this state of affairs to seize Grumbach&#x27;s lands. The knight obtained an order of restitution from the Imperial Chamber Court (&quot;Reichskammergericht&quot;), but he was unable to carry this into effect. 

In 1558, Zobel (like Florian Geyer earlier) was seized and killed by Grumbach&#x27;s henchman Christoph Kretzen who was married to Katherine Biber, Zobel&#x27;s predecessor Conrad von Bibra&#x27;s natural daughter. Grumbach declared he was innocent of this crime, but his story was not believed, and he fled to France. Kretzen was captured on the French border in Schaumburg Castle in what was then Lorraine, confessed to the act in 1558, but hanged himself before he could be tried.

==Grumbach Feud==
Returning to the Holy Roman Empire, he pleaded his cause in person before the Reichstag at Augsburg in 1559, but without success. Meanwhile, he had found a new patron in the Wettin duke John Frederick II of Saxony, whose father, John Frederick I, had been obliged by the 1547 Capitulation of Wittenberg to surrender the electoral dignity to the Albertine cadet branch of his family. Chafing under this deprivation the duke listened readily to Grumbach&#x27;s plans for recovering the lost dignity, including a general rising of the German knights and the deposition of Frederick II of Denmark. Magical charms were employed against the duke&#x27;s enemies, and communications from angels were invented which helped to stir up the zeal of the people.

In 1563 Grumbach attacked Würzburg, seized and plundered the city and compelled the chapter and the bishop to restore his lands. He was consequently placed under the imperial ban, but John Frederick II refused to obey the order of Emperor Maximilian II to withdraw his protection from him. Grumbach gained time, as Maximilian adjourned the case to the next Reichstag to be held in 1566 at Augsburg; meanwhile he sought to compass the assassination of John Frederick&#x27;s rival, Elector Augustus of Saxony. Proclamations were issued calling for assistance, and alliances both without and within the Empire were concluded.

Nevertheless, at the Augsburg diet in March 1566 even the Lutheran estates of the former Schmalkaldic League as well as his younger brother John William let John Frederick II down. He was placed under the ban while the ban against Grumbach was renewed and signed by Emperor Maximilian II on May 13. Elector Augustus, prime mover in the condemnation of his cousin, marched against John Frederick&#x27;s residence at Gotha. Assistance was not forthcoming, and a mutiny instigated by Augustus led to the capitulation of the town. Grumbach and his confederates were delivered to their foes and had to face trial for their misdeeds. Grumbach, after being tortured, was executed by dismemberment at Gotha on 18 April 1567.

John Frederick II&#x27;s castle was razed, he was deposed by his brother John William and spent the rest of his life in prison at Dresden, Wiener Neustadt and Lamberg Castle in Steyr, where he died on 19 May 1595.

<text>Badminton House is a large country house and Grade I Listed Building in Badminton, Gloucestershire, England, which has been the principal seat of the Dukes of Beaufort since the late 17th century. The house, which has given its name to the sport of badminton, is set among of land. The gardens and park surrounding the house are listed at Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==History==
In 1612 Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester, bought from Nicholas Boteler his manors of Great and Little Badminton, called &quot;Madmintune&quot; in the Domesday Book of 1086, while one century earlier the name &quot;Badimyncgtun&quot; was recorded, held by that family since 1275. Edward Somerset&#x27;s third son Sir Thomas Somerset modernized the old house in the late 1620s, and had a new T-shaped gabled range built. Evidence suggests he also had the present north and west fronts built up.

The Dukes of Beaufort acquired the property in the late 17th century, when the family moved from Raglan Castle, Monmouthshire, which had been ruined in the Civil War. The third duke adapted Sir Thomas Somerset&#x27;s house by incorporating his several gabled ranges around the courtyard and extending the old house eastwards to provide a new set of domestic apartments. He had a grand Jonesian centrepiece raised on the north front. The two-bay flanking elevations were five storeys high, reduced to three storeys in 1713. Their domed crowning pavilions are by James Gibbs.

For the fourth duke, who succeeded his brother in 1745, the architect William Kent renovated and extended the house in the Palladian style, but many earlier elements remain. The duke was instrumental in bringing the Venetian artist Canaletto to England: Canaletto&#x27;s two views of Badminton remain in the house.

== Connections ==
Whether or not the sport of badminton was re-introduced from British India or was invented during the hard winter of 1863 by the children of the eighth duke in the Great Hall (where the featherweight shuttlecock would not mar the life-size portraits of horses by John Wootton, as the tradition of the house has it), it was popularised at the house, hence the sport&#x27;s name.

Queen Mary stayed at Badminton House for much of World War II. Her staff occupied most of the building, to the inconvenience of the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort. Afterward, when the Duchess of Beaufort, who was Queen Mary&#x27;s niece, was asked in which part of the great house the Queen had resided, she responded &quot;She lived in all of it.&quot;

In the later 20th century, Badminton House became best known for the annual Badminton Horse Trials held there since 1949. Badminton House has also been strongly associated with fox hunting. Successive Dukes of Beaufort have been masters of the Beaufort Hunt, one of the two most famous hunts in the United Kingdom alongside the Quorn Hunt.

Weddings and parties can be booked at Badminton House. Occasionally, houses and cottage on the estate can be rented. The estate was the location for some scenes of the films &quot;The Remains of the Day&quot;, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, and of the Netflix series &quot;Bridgerton&quot;, &quot;Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story&quot; and &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;.

==Associated buildings==
Except for the Grade I listed parish church and Worcester Lodge, all structures named below are Grade II* listed.

===Parish church===
Adjacent to Badminton House is the Grade I listed parish church of St Michael and All Angels, built in 1785. It serves as the principal burial place of the Somerset family; nearly all Dukes and Duchesses of Beaufort are interred here.

=== Domestic buildings ===
* The 11-bay orangery of 1711 by Thomas Bateman
* An early 18th century laundry in Queen Anne style, now a house
* A similar brewery, also now a house
* The servants&#x27; wing southwest of the house, three ranges, late 17th century, altered and extended in the 19th
*Stables, barns and blacksmith&#x27;s shop forming the four sides of the stable court, 1878, possibly by T. H. Wyatt

=== Worcester Lodge ===

At the north entrance to the park, near the Tetbury road and reached from the house by the Three Mile Ride, the Grade I listed Worcester Lodge was designed in 1746 by William Kent. The part-rusticated main block has four storeys. Over the high central archway is a dining room with generous windows and balustraded balconies; a pediment bears the Beaufort arms and the roof is partly domed. The room has a plaster ceiling by Kent, depicting fruit and flowers of the four seasons, described as very fine by Historic England. Kent also designed the convex mirror with a sunburst pattern. Outside, the ornamental flanking quadrant walls on both sides finish at small pavilions.

=== Other estate buildings ===
Several buildings and follies were designed by Thomas Wright of Durham, around 1750.

* West of the house, Castle Barn is a castellated range of buildings including a barn and two flanking dovecote towers
* In the deer park, the park-keeper&#x27;s house is styled as a rustic cottage, one storey with attics
* Nearby, the Hermit&#x27;s Cell or Root House is a small square wooden building with a thatched roof
* Lower Slait Lodge, at the northwest entrance, has two storeys in Gothic style with four hexagonal corner turrets
* Set on a motte at the end of a main drive from Badminton House is the folly known as Ragged Castle, now roofless and a building at risk

<text>The Silver Star is a temporarily discontinued long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak on a route between New York City and Miami via Washington, D.C.; Richmond, Virginia; Raleigh, North Carolina; Columbia, South Carolina; Savannah, Georgia; Jacksonville, Florida; and Tampa, Florida. 

The &quot;Silver Star&quot; and its sister train in the &quot;Silver Service&quot; brand, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, are the descendants of numerous long-distance trains that operated between Florida and New York for most of the 20th century. On November 10, 2024, Amtrak temporarily combined the and &quot;Silver Star&quot;, producing a Chicago-Washington–Miami route, the .

During fiscal year 2023, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; carried 351,732 passengers, a decrease of 19.1% from FY2022. In November 2023, the train had a total revenue of $8.7 million.

== History ==
=== Background ===

The &quot;Silver Star&quot; was originally a service of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad (SAL), running from New York to Miami and later also St. Petersburg (beyond Tampa). It was previously known as the &quot;Advance Silver Meteor&quot;, and was renamed on December 12, 1947, after the name was chosen by SAL in a contest. From 1947 to 1948, it was winter-only and did not appear in summer timetables. By 1949, however, it was a year-round train. Its main Miami-bound route went through the interior of Florida, via Ocala and Winter Haven. In peak winter service in the mid-1950s it had a section that went to St. Petersburg via Tampa. Another section went to Port Boca Grande via Tampa. The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) carried the train between New York and Washington, D.C. under a haulage agreement, similar to the arrangement with its sister train, the &quot;Silver Meteor.&quot; The agreement was maintained when the PRR was folded into Penn Central Transportation in 1968, a year after SAL merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL) to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad (SCL). Between Washington and Richmond, Virginia, the train operated on RF&amp;P rails. Amtrak took over the train in 1971.

=== Amtrak era ===
Except for a brief period from 1994 to 1995 and from 1996 to 2004, when service to Tampa was provided by the &quot;Palmetto&quot; (known as the &quot;Silver Palm&quot; from 1996 to 2002), the &quot;Silver Star&quot; once served both Tampa and Miami during the Amtrak era. Originally, Amtrak operated the &quot;Silver Star&quot; with Tampa and Miami sections that split in Jacksonville, with the Tampa section continuing on the old Atlantic Coast Line route through Orlando, and the Miami section traveling through Ocala and Wildwood over most of what was the original Seaboard route to Miami. After November 1, 2004, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; resumed service to Tampa, and traveled intact all of the way, backing out of Tampa and retracing its route east to Auburndale, where it heads south to Miami or north to New York. The detour occurs at Lakeland; the train stops there to discharge passengers before going to Tampa and to receive passengers after it returns from Tampa.

In the January 2011 issue of &quot;Trains&quot; magazine, this route was listed as one of five routes to be looked at by Amtrak in FY 2011 as the previous five routes (the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;, &quot;Texas Eagle&quot;, &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Capitol Limited&quot;, and &quot;Cardinal&quot;) were examined in FY 2010. With the discontinuation of the &quot;Silver Meteor&#x27;s&quot; former Tampa section (a descendant of the &quot;Champion,&quot; a longtime rival of the &quot;Silver Star&quot; and &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;) in 1988, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was then the only passenger train serving Tampa.

On July 1, 2015, the &quot;Silver Star&#x27;s&quot; dining car was completely removed from the train&#x27;s consist, a controversial decision that Amtrak rationalized with the idea that sleeping car passengers could obtain meals from the train&#x27;s café-lounge car. However, on May 1, 2020, the &quot;Silver Star&#x27;s&quot; dining car was returned, and Amtrak introduced the “flexible dining” system to the train, which consists of pre-prepared meals which are then heated in either a convection oven or a microwave oven at the time of purchase. In a Rail Passengers Association webinar that took place on November 16, 2022, Amtrak&#x27;s vice president of long-distance service revealed that traditional dining service was planned to be reintroduced on the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and the &quot;Silver Star&quot; &quot;in early 2023.&quot; Following this announcement, beginning on northbound train 92 on March 15, 2023, traditional dining was reintroduced to the &quot;Silver Star&quot; for the first time since 2015. However, this was not a permanent rollout and was instead in the form of a 3-month pilot program gauged to test the success of the service. Southbound train 91 received the pilot on March 17. On June 24, 2023, traditional dining service was formally launched on the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, as well as on northbound &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; train 98, and the &quot;Silver Star&quot; pilot program was replaced by permanent service. Southbound train 97 received traditional dining on June 26. However, coach passengers were not allowed access to the dining car on either the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; or &quot;Silver Star&quot;, unlike on Amtrak&#x27;s western long-distance trains. Shortly after the formal rollout in another interview with the Rail Passengers Association, Amtrak&#x27;s vice president of long-distance service stated that Coach Class access to the dining car was planned to be allowed by the end of 2023, however by January 2024 coach passengers still did not have access. On March 4, 2024, dining car access was finally expanded to coach passengers, mirroring service on Amtrak&#x27;s western long-distance trains.

On February 4, 2018, &quot;Silver Star&quot; train number 91 collided with a CSX freight train in Cayce, South Carolina; the engineer and a conductor of the &quot;Silver Star&quot; were killed, and 116 passengers were injured.

Since 2012, issues have prevented Amtrak from moving from their current station to the Miami Intermodal Center (MIC), primarily regarding the length of the platforms and lease agreements. Amtrak argued that the platforms were insufficient in length, as extra cars are normally added to the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot; during the winter season to accommodate increased demand. Tri-Rail began serving the MIC on April 5, 2015, and Greyhound began using the station on June 24, 2015. Amtrak had been expected to move to the MIC by the Fall of 2016, but in 2018 Amtrak rejected the terms of a lease agreement with FDOT and said it had no plans to move to the MIC. In 2021, Amtrak reached out to FDOT to begin negotiations again for utilization of the MIC, and in February 2022, negotiations officially restarted. Later in March 2022, a test train operated into and out of the station and proved that the platforms are sufficient in length to hold a standard 10 car train. However, the platforms are not long enough to accommodate an 11 to 12 car train, which could be possible in the winter months. In September 2022, Amtrak management announced that it had restarted lease negotiations with FDOT regarding use and maintenance of the terminal. One issue however, is the deadheading move that will need to take place between the MIC and Hialeah. Amtrak CEO Stephen Gardner has stated that &quot;the company is evaluating technical and operational aspects of the move.&quot; In an Amtrak Public Board Meeting Q&amp;A on December 1, 2022, it was revealed that Amtrak was in the final stages of its preparations for relocating from their current Miami station, and had planned to relocate to the MIC in 2023. However, additional track area would need to be constructed for the Amtrak trains to turn back north, and Amtrak has no date indicated for when service will start at the MIC.

On July 6, 2020, as the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Amtrak reduced the frequency of this train to three times per week as opposed to daily. Southbound &quot;Silver Star&quot; trains departed New York Friday through Sunday, while &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; trains departed Monday through Thursday. Similarly, northbound &quot;Silver Star&quot; trains departed Miami on Thursday through Saturday, while &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; trains departed Sunday through Wednesday. Both trains resumed daily services on June 7, 2021, after additional Amtrak funding was included in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.

Between January 24 and October 14, 2022, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; temporarily added a station stop in Jesup, Georgia due to the suspension of its sister train, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, which is normally the only train that stops at that station. This was due to a resurgence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 as well as a further delay caused by Hurricane Ian. During this period the &quot;Silver Star&quot; provided a single once daily service between New York and Miami.

On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; and were merged into a Chicago–Washington–Miami service, the . The &quot;Floridian&quot; service is intended to be temporary to accommodate equipment shortages and planned rehabilitation work in the East River Tunnels.

== Rolling stock ==

Under SAL operation, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; utilized passenger cars built by the Budd Company and Pullman Standard built either just before or after World War II, and diesel-electric locomotives from the EMD E-unit series. These cars utilized steam heating provided by a steam generator in the locomotive. This equipment continued to operate when Amtrak took over in 1971. E-units were replaced by newer power, such as the steam generator-equipped EMD SDP40F by the mid 1970&#x27;s. Amtrak began rebuilding their inherited passenger cars in the late 1970&#x27;s to utilize Head-end power (HEP); these rebuilt cars were known as the &quot;Heritage Fleet.&quot; The train began using Heritage Fleet equipment on March 10, 1982, and subsequently HEP-equipped EMD F40PH locomotives.

The &quot;Silver Star&quot; used Amtrak&#x27;s standard long-distance single-level equipment: Viewliner baggage, sleeping, and dining cars, and Amfleet coach and café-lounge cars. An ACS-64 electric locomotive is used between New York City and Washington, D.C., while two diesel-electric locomotives, either GE P42DC or Siemens ALC-42 locomotives, are used for power south of Washington, D.C. Amtrak began replacing the older P42DC locomotives with ALC-42 locomotives in 2023.

A typical &quot;Silver Star&quot; consists of the following 
* ACS-64 locomotive (New York–Washington)
* P42DC or ALC-42 locomotive (Washington–Miami)
* P42DC or ALC-42 locomotive (Washington–Miami)
* Amfleet II Coach
* Amfleet II Coach
* Amfleet II Coach
* Amfleet II Café/Lounge Car
* Viewliner II Dining Car
* Viewliner I Sleeping Car
* Viewliner II Sleeping Car
* Viewliner II Baggage Car

During the 2022 suspension of the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;, some coach and sleeping cars usually on the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; were combined into the &quot;Silver Star&quot;, creating a train with up to six coaches and five sleepers, in addition to the café-lounge, diner, and baggage car.

The &quot;Silver Star&quot; used the same route as the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot;the other train in the &quot;Silver Service&quot; brandexcluding two segments: Selma, North Carolina – Savannah, Georgia, and Kissimmee, Florida – Winter Haven, Florida. Between Selma and Savannah, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; takes an inland route over the CSX S-Line to serve the Carolinas&#x27; state capitals of Raleigh and Columbia, while the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; stays closer to the coast on the CSX A-Line and serves Fayetteville, North Carolina and Charleston, South Carolina. Between Kissimmee and Winter Haven, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; turns south to go directly to Miami at Auburndale, Florida, while the &quot;Silver Star&quot; continues west to Lakeland, Florida and Tampa, before coming back to Auburndale and turning south to Miami. In addition to these diversions, between Sebring, Florida and West Palm Beach, Florida, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; makes no intermediate stops, while the &quot;Silver Star&quot; makes an additional stop at Okeechobee, Florida. Inversely, between Savannah and Jacksonville, Florida, the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; makes an additional stop at Jesup, Georgia, while the &quot;Silver Star&quot; made no intermediate stops. However, during the 2022 suspension of the &quot;Silver Meteor,&quot; the &quot;Silver Star&quot; temporarily served Jesup.

Prior to October 1986, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; operated between Petersburg, Virginia, and Raleigh via the CSX Norlina Subdivision, stopping only in Henderson, North Carolina. CSX abandoned the Norlina Subdivision between Norlina, North Carolina and Collier Yard (just south of Petersburg) in October 1986, which required the &quot;Silver Star&quot; to be rerouted over the CSX A-Line between Petersburg and Selma, then over the North Carolina Railroad between Selma and Raleigh. The &quot;Silver Star&quot; is to be rerouted via its former routing when tracks between Petersburg and Norlina are rebuilt as part of the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor project, and reinstate its stop at Henderson, as well as adding a stop in La Crosse, Virginia.

Like other long-distance trains operating on the Northeast Corridor, local travel between NEC stations is not allowed on the &quot;Silver Star&quot;. Northbound trains only stop to discharge passengers from Alexandria, Virginia northward, and southbound trains only stop to receive passengers from Newark, New Jersey to Washington. This policy is in place to keep seats available for passengers making longer trips. Passengers wanting to travel locally must use the more frequent &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; or &quot;Acela&quot; trains. Additionally, the &quot;Silver Star,&quot; like the &quot;Silver Meteor,&quot; does not allow local travel between West Palm Beach and Miami. Southbound trains only stop to discharge passengers, while northbound trains only stop to receive passengers bound for points beyond West Palm Beach. This is due to the availability of Tri-Rail, South Florida&#x27;s commuter rail system.

Since Amtrak ended passenger rail service over the CSX Clearwater Subdivision between Tampa and St. Petersburg, Florida in February 1984,&quot;Amtrak Thruway&quot; bus service has been provided at Tampa Union Station for trainside transfer of passengers and their baggage to and from Clearwater, Florida and St. Petersburg. Other points on Florida&#x27;s west coast, such as Bradenton, Florida, Sarasota, Florida, Port Charlotte, Florida and Fort Myers, Florida, are also served by Amtrak Thruway service connecting with the &quot;Silver Star&quot; at Tampa. Similarly, Amtrak has provided Amtrak Thruway bus service between the former stations along the CSX Wildwood Subdivision in North-Central Florida since November 2004 after passenger rail service ended, as well as Gainesville, Florida and The Villages-Lady Lake, Florida. The former stations that are now served by Amtrak Thruway buses are: Waldo, Florida, Ocala, Florida, Wildwood, Florida, and Dade City, Florida. These buses connect with the &quot;Silver Star&quot; at Jacksonville and Lakeland.
