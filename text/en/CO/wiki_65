<text>NFL Productions, LLC, doing business as NFL Films, is the film and television production company of the National Football League. It produces commercials, television programs, feature films, and documentaries for and about the NFL, as well as other unrelated major events and awards shows. Founded as Blair Motion Pictures by Ed Sabol in 1962 and run by his son Steve Sabol until his death, it produces most of the NFL&#x27;s filmed and videotaped content except its live game coverage, which is handled separately by the individual networks. NFL Films is based in Mount Laurel, New Jersey.

==Founding==

Founder Ed Sabol was a World War II veteran who worked selling topcoats after returning to the United States. In his spare time, he used a motion picture camera, received as a wedding gift, to record his son Steve&#x27;s high school football games. Inspired by his work, Sabol founded a small film company called Blair Motion Pictures, named after his daughter Blair. 

Sabol won the bidding for the rights to film the 1962 NFL championship game for $5,000, double the bid for the 1961 championship game. The film of that game impressed NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who asked the owners of the NFL to agree to buy out Sabol&#x27;s company. Although the owners rejected Rozelle&#x27;s proposal in 1964, they agreed a year later and renamed Sabol&#x27;s company NFL Films. He received $20,000 in seed money from each of the league&#x27;s then 14 owners, and in return would shoot all NFL games and produce an annual highlight film for each team.

In June 1966, the NFL agreed with the rival American Football League to merge in 1970. One of the reasons the leagues initially remained separate entities was to give Sabol adequate time to expand NFL Films in order to service a significantly enlarged league. Under the merger terms, NFL Films began covering the American Football League (AFL) in 1968, ostensibly under a newly established &quot;AFL Films&quot; division. In reality, &quot;AFL Films&quot; crews these were simply regular NFL Films personnel wearing separate jackets to appease AFL loyalists.

On August 6, 2011, Ed Sabol was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as a major contributor to the National Football League. Sabol died on February 9, 2015, at his home in Arizona.

==Style==
Much has been made of the Films style. &quot;Salon.com&quot; television critic, Matt Zoller Seitz, has called NFL Films &quot;the greatest in-house P.R. machine in pro sports history...an outfit that could make even a tedious stalemate seem as momentous as the battle for the Alamo.&quot;

NFL Films productions follow certain patterns. Film is mostly used. One camera is dedicated entirely to slow motion shots and microphones are present on the sidelines and near the field to pick up both the sounds of the game as well as the talk on the sidelines. The narrators have deep, powerful, baritone voices. Narrators have usually been from the Philadelphia metropolitan area, with well-known announcers such as John Facenda, Harry Kalas, Jefferson Kaye, Andy Musser, Jack Whitaker, William Woodson, and current announcer Scott Graham all having narrated NFL Films presentations. J.K. Simmons was tapped to narrate the company&#x27;s one-hour recap of the 16–0 regular season of the 2007 New England Patriots, while actor Burt Lancaster was tabbed for narrations in 1969. Burl Ives was also called upon to narrate the 1971 Washington Redskins highlight film.

Team-specific films such as &quot;year-in-review films&quot; have occasionally been narrated by broadcasters or personalities involved with the team in question. Examples include the 1985, 2000, and 2001 Oakland Raiders season reviews being narrated by actor and former Raiders player Carl Weathers. Former Giant Frank Gifford periodically narrated New York Giants season reviews (notably the company&#x27;s throwback-themed 2013 season recap) until he died in 2015, and ex-Giants teammate Pat Summerall narrated highlight films for many teams until he died in 2013. 

New England Patriots play-by-play announcer Gil Santos narrated the year-in-review films of the 1974, 1976, and 1978 seasons, and New Orleans Saints films from their inception in 1967 through 1979 were narrated by Don Criqui, who called Saints games for the &quot;NFL on CBS&quot; in the team&#x27;s early years, along with radio announcers Al Wester and Wayne Mack. Longtime KDKA radio &amp; KDKA-TV personality Larry Richert often narrated films of the Pittsburgh Steelers prior to becoming the team&#x27;s PA announcer at Acrisure Stadium and continues to do so today. (Richert is also the brother-in-law to Miami Dolphins legend Dan Marino.) Other programming such as &quot;NFL Films Presents&quot; and its Super Bowl Recap hosted by Carissa Thompson has been narrated by veteran actor and voice actor Leonard Dozier.

The style of film has been called &quot;tight on the spiral&quot;, a reference to the frequently-used slow-motion shot of the spinning football as it travels from the quarterback&#x27;s hand to the receiver. This shot usually consists of showing the quarterback throwing the football, then the camera zooming in to focus on the spinning ball, as the ball starts to descend, the camera zooms out, showing the result of the ball landing into the receiver&#x27;s hands. NFL Films also dubs sound bites of local radio broadcasts over key plays, because radio announcers are typically more enthusiastic about their home teams than are the network television broadcasters. 

In addition, NFL Films often uses multiple camera angles (with an emphasis on close-up shots that often exaggerate the speed of the players in real-time). The company&#x27;s films also employ muscular orchestral scores from a wide variety of musicians, notably Sam Spence, Johnny Pearson (whose &quot;Heavy Action&quot; became the theme for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;) Frank Rothman, Ralph Dollimore, Udi Harpaz, Malcolm Lockyer, Jan Stoeckart (under his varied stage names such as Jack Trombey), Peter Reno, Paul Lewis, Prameela Tomashek, Dave Robidoux and Tom Hedden. 

The company&#x27;s use of KPM Musichouse (Now KPM Music) tracks also notably included Syd Dale; tracks include &quot;Maelstrom&quot; for the company&#x27;s 1968 Minnesota Vikings season highlight reel and also the psychedelic-flavored jazz track &quot;Artful Dodger&quot; on the film recap of Super Bowl V, specifically during the montage which shows Johnny Unitas&#x27;s 75-yard touchdown pass to John Mackey which was tipped in flight by Eddie Hinton and Mel Renfro before landing in the hands of Mackey.

The company also makes prolific use of footage of players and coaches in the locker room after the game. With these techniques, NFL Films turns football games into events that mimic ballet, opera, and epic battles. Among the company&#x27;s most famous creation is the poem and accompanying music cue &quot;The Autumn Wind&quot;, which have become official themes for the Las Vegas Raiders.

==Television programs==
One of NFL Films&#x27; most popular series is &quot;Hard Knocks&quot;. With production run entirely from the field and the NFL Films facility, NFL Films and HBO follow one NFL team as they go through training camp, leading up to the beginning of the season.

NFL Films also produces the &quot;Greatest Moments&quot; series, which details classic games from the 1960&#x27;s, 1970&#x27;s, 1980&#x27;s, 1990&#x27;s, and 2000&#x27;s (decade); the &quot;Lost Treasures&quot; series, which uses old NFL Films footage, which had previously never been shown on television, to look at football players, coaches, and referees; and &quot;NFL Films Presents&quot;, an umbrella title for other NFL Films productions that do not neatly fit an existing series (Katie Nolan serves as the current host of &quot;NFL Films Presents&quot;).

NFL Films also produces the &quot;NFL Game of the Week&quot;, which showcases a previous week&#x27;s game. ION Television purchased the rights to air &quot;Game of the Week&quot; during the 2007 season.

Among other television programs, NFL Films is credited for producing &quot;NFL Total Access&quot; and much of the NFL Network&#x27;s programming output. NFL Films also has a dedicated channel on free over-the-top service Pluto TV that launched in August 2019.

NFL Films&#x27; game highlights have been a staple of &quot;Inside the NFL&quot; for its entire run, starting at HBO in 1977 and going on to air on Showtime and Paramount+ through to its current home at The CW. NFL Films also produced for Showtime the five-part miniseries &quot;Full Color Football: The History of the American Football League&quot;, which aired in the fall of 2009 as part of the American Football League 50th anniversary celebration.

NFL Films produces an annual highlight film for each team every season, distributed by home video. If a team had a good year, the film often revels in each victory, while breezing through, or skipping altogether, losses during the season. Inversely, if a team suffered through a poor season, the highlights commonly still attempt to show the team in a good light, however difficult that may be. Losses and pitiful play is commonly, and conveniently, edited out, leaving only isolated moments of success. This prompts the viewer to not realize how bad the team might have been. Most films conclude by portraying teams optimistically for the upcoming season, whether founded or not.

The Sabols have used NFL Films to showcase their sense of humour. This is the case in the series titled, &quot;Football Follies&quot;. The Follies use blooper plays, such as fumbles, dropped passes, deflected or bobbled passes, players slipping and falling, mascots, the quarterback lining up behind the guard instead of the center, disorganization, outtakes and silly narration.

The presence of NFL Films&#x27; cameras allowed for the preservation of video footage from many of the NFL&#x27;s 1960s-era games in an era when sports telecasts were either broadcast live without any recording or whose films and tapes were destroyed and recycled for later use. This practice did not fully stop until 1978. 

Without the presence of NFL Films, there would be no surviving footage of the early Super Bowls. In comparison, other sports that lacked the film resources that the NFL had to have archives missing up through the 1970s, with much of the time before that preserved only by Canadian television broadcasters. For instance, in Major League Baseball, the broadcast of many World Series games before 1975 have been lost; nearly all broadcasts of League Championship Series from the first series in 1969 to 1978 are unavailable.

==Success==
Although NFL Films earns more than $50 million in revenue a year and is expanding at a double digit rate, compared to the $18 billion in revenue that the NFL earns from television alone, most consider this to be minor. The real value of NFL Films is how it packages and sells the game and many credit it as a key reason that the NFL has become the most watched sports league in the United States.

In addition to covering the National Football League, NFL Films has also ventured into other unrelated documentary films, such as documenting the Munich Olympics massacre for one of NBC&#x27;s Olympics telecasts and serving as back-up film photography for other major events, including the Stanley Cup Finals (NHL Original Productions), the NBA Finals (NBA Entertainment) and the World Series (MLB Productions). It also produced the video for Journey&#x27;s 1983 hit single &quot;Faithfully&quot;. NFL Films also has worked with Volkswagen Group in producing Audi&#x27;s &quot;Truth in 24&quot; series about Audi&#x27;s efforts at the 24 Hours of Le Mans using the signature style to package and sell the marque&#x27;s efforts in France. NFL Films has also produced television commercials for convenience store chain Sheetz.

The company has also done films for major college football programs, such as Colorado State University; the company&#x27;s 1977 film on CSU&#x27;s football program used John Denver&#x27;s song &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; as well as an instrumental cover of The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Tell Me What You See&quot;, and noted alumni of the team who had gone on to NFL careers, such as Bill Larson of the Lions and Bill Kennedy of the Colts, Kevin McClain of the Rams, and Greg Stamrick of the Oilers.

NFL Films&#x27; distinctive style has been parodied in numerous commercials, particularly for the NFL&#x27;s sponsors, including Sprint Nextel and Burger King.

NFL Films has won 112 Sports Emmys.

==Music rights controversy with Sam Spence==

Sam Spence was long involved in a controversial situation with the NFL regarding the rights to perform or use his music in any media outlets. In an interview, Spence reported he was convinced to sign a contract that relinquished all of the rights to his music to NFL Films under the promise that the League would return the document to him. Spence alleged that NFL Films claimed that his music was &quot;stolen&quot; and signing the document would empower them to protect the music in court.

==NFL Films Lab==

NFL Films operates its own in-house 16mm and 35mm Color Negative Processing Lab. This enables the film that is shot at each game to be rushed back to the Mt. Laurel facility and processed immediately so as to give the production team the maximum amount of time to produce its weekly shows.

The lab is open to the public for development needs. Clients include feature length and short films shot on location in Philadelphia as well as students at local universities.

The current lab is the third incarnation. The original lab was located in a building next to NFL Films original offices at 230 N 13th St in Philadelphia. The second lab was housed in the center of the NFL Films offices at 330 Fellowship Rd in Mt. Laurel, NJ. That entire one-story building has since been razed and replaced with a modern 4 story office building.

The third lab is located at the NFL Films current location in the Bishop&#x27;s Gate industrial park in Mt. Laurel behind a two-story glass wall. This allows visitors to the offices to see the inner workings of the entire processing lab. Those on morning tours can often watch as employees develop film for use in weekly shows.

NFL Films Lab is also in charge of the archiving and maintenance of the vault. Containing over 100 continuous years of football footage, the vault houses all of the film that NFL Films has shot or acquired from other sources in its entire history. Currently, NFL Films is in the process of re-transferring all of its footage into high-definition format, although the original film will always be kept as it&#x27;s likely to outlast tape medium in terms of degradation.

<doc id="1293506" wikidata="Q1051396" url="?curid=1293506" title="South Island robin">
<text>The South Island robin (Petroica australis; also known in Māori as the ) is a sparrow-sized bird found only in New Zealand, where it has the status of a protected endemic species. The birds are sparsely distributed through the South Island and Stewart Island / Rakiura, although the distribution is not continuous. The nominate, and the Stewart Island robin (&quot;P. australis rakiura&quot;) are the two subspecies. The species is closely related to the North Island robin (formerly &quot;P. australis longipes&quot;, now considered a distinct species), and also to the extremely rare black robin (&quot;P. traversi&quot;) of the Chatham Islands.

==Taxonomy==

The South Island robin has two subspecies: &quot;P. australis australis&quot;, the nominate form, and &quot;P. australis rakiura&quot;, the Stewart Island robin. These subspecies do not overlap in their distributions. The North Island robin (&quot;P. longipes&quot;), the tomtit (&quot;Petroica macrocephala&quot;), and the black robin (&quot;Petroica traversi&quot;) in the Chatham Islands are closely related species. &quot;P. traversi&quot; seems to be a Chatham Island derivative of &quot;P. australis&quot;, although the position of the most recent common ancestor has yet to be determined. The family Petroicidae of Australasian robins has a total of 49 species, mostly in Australia, New Zealand, and New Guinea.

==Fossil record==
There is molecular phylogenetic evidence to suggest two waves of immigration by the Petroica genus from Australia. &quot;P. longipes&quot; and &quot;P. australis&quot; can be traced to the first and &quot;P. macrocephala&quot; to the second wave. The evidence suggests that &quot;P. longipes&quot; and &quot;P. australis&quot; began to diverge prior to the Pleistocene era, and that the two South Island subspecies of &quot;P. australis&quot; began to diverge after the Pleistocene era. The separation time for the former was about three million years, and only 10,000 years (i.e., postglacial) for the latter. Fossils of New Zealand robins can sometimes be found near pit fall deposits, as they do most of their feeding/foraging on the ground. The fossil record also indicates the robins&#x27; presence throughout lowland New Zealand until drastic habitat reduction through deforestation by the Polynesian ancestors of the Māori and later European colonisers.

==Description==

The South Island robin is a small passerine, 10–18 cm in length and weighing around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females and juveniles of the South Island robins, as well as all the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females and juveniles within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly coloured breast patch. However, male North Island robins are almost black with a white spot just above the beak, as well as the greyish-white lower breast. Females and juveniles are greyer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. Male South Island robins are dark grey, except for the distinct yellowish-white lower chest, while females and juveniles are again lighter grey with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (both males and females).

New Zealand robins are relatively long-lived; life-spans of at least 14 years have been recorded in the wild.

==Distribution==

Historically, the South Island robin inhabited much of the lowland of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, but its distribution has become much more patchy in the last century due to habitat loss and introduced predation. There are two populations on the east coast of the South Island, and they are slightly more common in the north and west. It has fared slightly better than the Stewart Island robin, which has been relegated to 3 subpopulations, all of which are in Leptospermum swamp scrubland—although this is not their preferred habitat, it is less heavily populated by mammalian predators. Total population was lower than 500 individuals at one point. A programme of translocation to predator-free islands (such as Ulva Island, Motuara Island, and Nukuwaiata Island) was instituted and proved relatively successful at establishing new populations (around 600 individuals on Motuara alone). In the South Island, &quot;P. australis&quot; has a strong affinity for Douglas fir plantations, instead of the native forests (kanuka trees) or Monterey pine plantations. This is apparently due to forest structure rather than strict food availability or viable nesting sites, as the species prefers structurally simple forests with dense, even canopies, and ground covered with leaf litter. When the population was introduced to Ulva Island, nesting was positively correlated with the presence of broad-leaved coastal vegetation.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===
South Island robins are genetically monogamous, and extra-pair paternity is rare. As they do typically remain monogamous, are non-migratory, and remain on their breeding territories year-round, a male and female in one territory will compete for food resources during non-breeding times. Competition is reduced somewhat by slightly different foraging methods; however, they will steal from their mate&#x27;s cache if given the opportunity. Males do dominate females, and thus will aggressively exclude females from food, such that females will only access food sources when unattended by the males. During breeding season, the female is solely responsible for nest building and incubation, and the male will provide the female and the hatchlings with food.

South Island robins become sexually mature between six and 12 months of age. They begin their breeding season fairly early in August or September (Southern Hemisphere spring) and thus can make use of the winter&#x27;s remaining food stores during this time. They build open-cup nests in tree-forks or inside tree cavities. Incubation lasts 18 days, and chicks leave the nest after 21 days. Five to 25 days after fledglings leave the nest, the pair may breed again. Modal clutch size is two eggs, with the expected inverse correlation between dimensions and number of eggs. Replacement clutches, in the case of loss of eggs or nestlings to predation, can be produced relatively rapidly, within 3–10 days.

===Feeding===

Invertebrates, including earthworms, beetles, and other arthropods foraged from the leaf litter comprise most of the South Island robins&#x27; diet. Invertebrate prey may be cached whole or in portions. Single items are cached at separate sites. Prey is typically stored within 10 metres of where it was procured, even if the bird is outside its own territory. In the winter the primary cache is earthworms, while during the summer the trend is toward cicadas. South Island robins have a very good memory of their storage sites; a male was observed to empty as many as five consecutive caches before returning the stores to his mate during incubation. The birds have demonstrated an ability to differentiate and prioritise caches of varying sizes, up to 12 total items, without any training, which appears to be the highest recorded numerical competency of any wild animal. Because of its high metabolic rate, a robin might spend as much as 90% of its day foraging or storing during the winter. South Island robins have also been observed to eat berries on occasion; however, these are not cached.

===Vocalisation===
A male&#x27;s call during non-breeding season is a series of loud notes with descending frequency, which start in rapid succession and finish slowly. During breeding season, the males resort to full song to court the females. Full song is a loud, clear, and continuous song, which can last for more than 30 minutes with very brief pauses, and is typically sung from the canopy or an emergent tree. Singing also appears to be performed as part of a strategic regulation of body mass. While robins sing during the dawn chorus as well as throughout the day, they seem to increase their singing according to food availability. When they have had more food, they will increase energetic behaviours, such as singing, to arrive at a strategic mass by dusk. Thus, even though two robins might begin the day with different weights, they will end the day with similar weights. A side-effect of this behaviour might be the showcasing of a particular male&#x27;s ability to sequester resources: the longer he sings, the more capable he is of finding food, and thus a better candidate for a mate.

==Conservation==

The South Island robin is listed as being of least concern on the IUCN Red List. However, the Stewart Island robin (&quot;Petroica australis rakiura&quot;) has gone through a couple of bottlenecked populations recently because of deforestation and habitat loss, as well as introduced predators, such as rats, stoats, and feral cats. Because of this sharp decline in the Stewart Island population, several attempts have been made to translocate the Stewart Island robin to other islands nearby where introduced predators do not exist or have been eradicated (see above). However, many of these translocations have involved 12 or fewer colonising individuals, making inbreeding nearly unavoidable. This has led to some apparent immunocompetency issues as well as reproduction problems. On Motuara Island, high rates of hatching failure as well as fewer clutches were observed. Inbreeding and its genetic and immunological consequences, therefore, remain a concern with this subspecies.

In contrast, birds in the South Island do not show much genetic loss in comparison with historical populations, although their distribution on the island has become increasingly fragmented.

==South Island robins and 1080 poison==

A number of robin deaths have been recorded as a result of accidental 1080 poisoning following pest control operations. Most of these were associated with four specific operations in the 1980s that used poor-quality carrot baits. These instances aside, robins have generally responded well to pest control programmes using aerial 1080 operations, with increased chick and adult survival, and increases in population size. A 2012 scientific study of a marked population by the University of Otago during a contemporary 1080 poison operation using cereal baits showed no negative impact on robins, and suggested a likely population increase by reducing predation pressure from introduced mammals.

<text>Harmony Airways was a Canadian airline headquartered in Richmond, British Columbia, a suburb of Vancouver. It operated holiday flights from Canada to Mexico, Hawaii and Las Vegas. Its main base was Vancouver International Airport.

== History ==
The airline was officially announced as HMY Airways (an abbreviation for Harmony) by David Ting Kwok Ho in February 2002. After acquiring two Boeing 757-200 jetliners in September and November 2002, the airline&#x27;s inaugural flight flew from Vancouver in November 2002. The airline was wholly owned by David Ting Kwok Ho. 

Throughout the mid 2000s, the airline steadily expanded, first within Canad], but it soon expanded to Hawaii and to many destinations in southern USA. Future plans included expanding into China, but those plans were never realized. The airline was renamed Harmony Airways in May 2004. 

Harmony&#x27;s telephone reservations were contracted to a dedicated call centre team at Vantis Corporation in Calgary, Alberta (later briefly renamed Vantis-TravelCLICK before closing down Calgary operations in October 2006). Vantis (previously known as VIP) was a third-party call centre based in Calgary before being acquired by TravelCLICK in October 2005, then having operations moved to Jamaica in October 2006. Harmony&#x27;s call centre contract with Vantis-TravelCLICK ended after Harmony ceased operations in 2007.

From June 2006 to October 2006, Harmony Airways leased a Bombardier CRJ-100 to operate the Vancouver - Calgary route. The aircraft was configured in a single-class 50-seat configuration, and was painted in a hybrid, United Express - Harmony Airways livery.

On March 27, 2007, Harmony Airways announced that it had issued layoff notices to all staff, and that it was ending scheduled flight service on April 9, 2007, due to increasing fuel costs and having a hard time attracting full-service passengers amid low-cost competition, such as WestJet. Harmony also had a hard time attracting profitable business travelers, due to a lack of a frequent flier program and lacking services to popular business destinations.

== Destinations ==
As of October 2006, Harmony Airways had services to the following destinations:

===Canada===
* Alberta
** Calgary – Calgary International Airport
** Edmonton – Edmonton International Airport (Seasonal)
* British Columbia
** Abbotsford – Abbotsford International Airport
** Kelowna – Kelowna International Airport (Seasonal)
** Vancouver – Vancouver International Airport (Base)
** Victoria – Victoria International Airport (Seasonal)
* Ontario
** Toronto – Toronto Pearson International Airport

===United States===
* California
** Los Angeles – Los Angeles International Airport
** Oakland – Oakland International Airport
** Palm Springs – Palm Springs International Airport
* Hawaii
** Hilo – Hilo International Airport
** Honolulu – Daniel K. Inouye International Airport
** Maui – Kahului Airport
* Nevada
** Las Vegas – Harry Reid International Airport
* New York
** New York City – John F. Kennedy International Airport

== Fleet ==

The Harmony Airways fleet consisted of Boeing 757-200 aircraft. For a short period of time in 2006, Harmony Airways operated a Bombardier CRJ-100 aircraft on its Vancouver - Calgary route.
As of March 2007 the Harmony Airways fleet included four Boeing 757-200 aircraft. On March 22, 2007, the National Post reported that Harmony Airways would reduce its fleet to three 757s. In the summer of 2007, British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce purchased two of Harmony&#x27;s 757s in order to harvest the plane&#x27;s RB211-535 engines to support other customers&#x27; engine needs. Rolls-Royce then sold the remaining aircraft hulls to an American salvage company.
==Services==
Harmony Airways offered two classes of service on their Boeing 757-200 aircraft (the Bombardier CRJ-100 was single-class): Business and Economy class. Both classes were advertised as being full-service compared to WestJet and other low-cost alternatives.

===Business class===
Available on Boeing 757-200 aircraft, Business class was Harmony&#x27;s flagship product. Business class was sometimes marketed as &quot;harmonyone&quot;. Seats had a pitch of 52 inches, and a width of 22 inches. Passengers were given personal AVOD (Audio Video On Demand) systems to use during the flight. Amenity kits were also provided.

===Economy Class===
Harmony Airways promoted their economy class as higher quality than other airlines, stating &quot;We really shouldn&#x27;t even use the word economy&quot;. Seats had a pitch of . Harmony gave out free headphones in Economy class that passengers could keep, to use with the Inflight entertainment. Complimentary hot meals were served on longer routes.

<text>&quot;The Silence&quot; is episode 61 (season 2, episode 25) of the American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. The plot of this episode was based in part on the short story &quot;The Bet&quot; by Anton Chekhov. It&#x27;s &quot;the story of possibly the strangest bet ever to occur in the annals of chance.&quot; It originally aired on April 28, 1961 on CBS. It is one of the few &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episodes to feature no supernatural or sci-fi elements.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
Colonel Archie Taylor, a gruff aristocrat, has difficulty enjoying his men&#x27;s club because of the constant chatter of fellow member Jamie Tennyson. In an effort to shut Tennyson up, Taylor bets him US$500,000 () that he cannot remain silent for one year. If Tennyson accepts the wager, a small glass-walled apartment will be erected in the club&#x27;s game room, where he will be monitored by microphones so that he cannot speak without detection. He may only write notes to communicate, and the other members may observe him through the glass.

An offended Tennyson agrees, needing the money to pay the debts incurred by his wife&#x27;s exorbitant spending. He proposes that Taylor put a check on deposit in his name, but the club members reject this request as Taylor has a strong standing of honor and credit. &quot;[Tennyson&#x27;s] courage against [Taylor&#x27;s] credit&quot; is accepted by both and the challenge begins the following night.

Taylor initially expects to win within a few weeks, but Tennyson surprises him by remaining silent for nine months. Taylor gets nervous and offers to pay Tennyson to call off the bet, starting with $1,000 before escalating to $6,000. When these fail, he suggests that Tennyson&#x27;s wife is planning to leave him for another man. She has never responded to any of Tennyson&#x27;s several written requests for a visit, giving weight to Taylor&#x27;s insinuations. Tennyson seems gripped by despair at the thought of losing his wife, but nonetheless refuses to call off the bet.

On the last evening of the year, club member Alfred tells Taylor his behavior over the past months, particularly using Tennyson&#x27;s wife as a threat, has severely damaged the club&#x27;s esteem for him. As the clock chimes to officially signal that the one year has passed, Tennyson emerges to the congratulations of his fellow club members before he approaches Taylor and silently puts his hand out for the money. The embarrassed Taylor admits that he had lost his fortune several years earlier. He praises Tennyson&#x27;s resolve and character and then announces his decision to resign from the club.

The distraught Tennyson scribbles furiously on a sheet of paper, perplexing the other men, who wonder why he does not speak. Taylor reads the note aloud: &quot;I knew I would not be able to keep my part of the bargain, so one year ago I had the nerves to my vocal cords severed.&quot; Tennyson displays the scar on his throat from the operation, which he has concealed for the past year under scarves and turtlenecks.

<text>Pierre-Claver Akendengué (born April 25, 1943) is a Gabonese musician and composer. In 1997, he received his country&#x27;s &quot;Prix d&#x27;excellence&quot; at the Africa Music awards in Libreville, honoring his body of work. He also serves as a cultural advisor for the government of Gabon.

==Biography==
Born on the island of Awuta, which is located just off the coast from Port-Gentil, Akendengué went to school in Port-Gentil, then studied psychology at the University of Caen in France during the 1960s. While in France, he met the singer Mireille, who encouraged his musical interests.

In 1974, Akendengué recorded his first album, &quot;Nandipo&quot;, which consisted of songs of his own composition, sung in French and Nkomi, accompanied by guitar, women choir, bass and the percussion of Nana Vasconcelos. He later set to music poems by P. E. Mondjegou, such as &quot;Le Chant du Coupeur d&#x27;Okoumé&quot; (&quot;The Song of the Okoumé Cutter&quot;). Returning to Gabon, he studied solfeggio and plainchant at a Catholic college, and presented spectacles showcasing traditional Gabonese forms in a concert setting.

In 1986, he received a doctorate from the University of Paris for his study of religion and education among the Nkomi.

<text>Canada 3000 Airlines Inc. was a Canadian discount charter airline offering domestic and international flights. It was the largest charter airline in the world at the time of its operation, with over 90 destinations worldwide, although it changed to scheduled service in 2000 after the Canadian Airlines and Air Canada merger. Canada 3000 competed with Air Canada, WestJet, and fellow charter airline Air Transat. In November 2001, the airline went out of business after a sharp decline in revenues following the September 11 attacks in the United States. There have been several attempts to restart the airline since then. The airline was headquartered in Etobicoke in the west-end of Toronto, Ontario.

==History==

===Operations===

The airline was created in 1988 by British airline Air 2000, initially for charter service to lease some of its airplanes for Canadian charter travel (dubbed as &quot;Air 2000 Airline Ltd&quot;). The airline was denied license to operate by the National Transport Agency (NTA) because of the control and ownership of the UK firm. Air 2000 dropped out of an ownership position, and the airline started operations in December 1988. On May 1, 1989, by order of the NTA, it changed its name to &quot;Canada 3000&quot;. The next year the airline acquired Vacationair and a subsidiary was created in Mexico with the name Aerofiesta (not to be confused with the similarly named Aero Fiesta Mexicana, which was founded in 1993). The company&#x27;s owners were the Deluce family (25%), chairman John Lecky (45%) and Adventure Tours (30%). Following the demise of Wardair, the company&#x27;s goal was to become Canada&#x27;s largest charter carrier, a position it attained in 1991.

The cover of the Canada 3000 summer of 1997 flight schedule stated the airline was serving destinations in Belgium, Denmark, England, Fiji, France, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Scotland and the U.S. as well as Canada.

In 1998, co-founder and CEO Angus Kinnear was the recipient of the Tony Jannus Award for his contributions to commercial air transportation. As of 1998, the airline carried over 2.5 million passengers annually, and had destinations in 22 countries. In April 1998, Canada 3000 became the launch customer and first commercial operator of the Airbus A330-200.

In 1999, Canada 3000 purchased Holiday Travel Consultants based out of Vancouver from Richard and Shelley Carlin, which expanded to become Canada 3000&#x27;s retail division under the name Canada 3000 Tickets. By the time it closed its doors, Canada 3000 had expanded its retail division to include 40 branch offices as well as three call centers in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver.

In 2000, Canada 3000 went public, raising $30 million in an IPO. In January 2001, Canada 3000 bought charter carrier Royal Aviation of Montreal, Quebec for $84 million. The company also acquired Royal Cargo Airlines&#x27; cargo division, renaming it to Canada 3000 Cargo. In March 2001 it also took over CanJet for $7.5 million in stock. In May 2001, following the merger of Canadian Airlines International with Air Canada, Canada 3000 also started operating scheduled flights. In October 2001, one month before its demise, Canada 3000 became the first airline to operate non-stop service from North America to India.

===Collapse===
On November 8, 2001 the company suddenly collapsed with no warning for travelers or employees. The company filed for bankruptcy, citing a downturn in air travel during the weeks following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. The fleet was left grounded at various airports around the world, leaving 50,000 vacationers stranded. September 10, 2001 was a record booking day, but within a few days air traffic declined by 50%. The airline was offered a $75 million loan guarantee from the Canadian government under the condition of a &#x27;viable business plan&#x27; being produced. By November 7, 2001, the airline had $260 million in debt, and only had $1.49 million in cash. In secret, it had applied to the Canada Labour Board for permission to cut labour costs by 30% by closing its Royal division immediately. The Board would not approve without union agreement. Union offers to cut 700 pilot and flight attendant positions did not provide enough savings immediately and the airline applied for bankruptcy protection on November 8, while it planned to continue flying. By the end of the day, airport authorities in Toronto and St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland had seized planes under court authority and the company directors decided to cease operations.

Out of bankruptcy, the Canada 3000 Cargo operation, which was still operating, was sold off and became Cargojet Airways, run by former Canada 3000 executive Ajay Virmani. In 2002, Michel Leblanc, the former owner of Royal Airlines and later a director with Canada 3000 went on to form another scheduled discount airline, Jetsgo, which lasted almost three years before it too collapsed and filed for bankruptcy protection on March 11, 2005.
The CEO, Robert Deluce continued in the airline business with the successful Porter Airlines out of Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport.

In 2005, a group of investors had planned to launch a new Canada 3000, with two Boeing 757-200s.

<text>The XB-38 Flying Fortress was a single example conversion of a production B-17E Flying Fortress, testing whether the Allison V-1710 V type engine could be substituted for the standard Wright R-1820 radial engine during early World War II.

==Design and development==
The XB-38 was the result of a modification project undertaken by Vega (a subsidiary of Lockheed) on a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress to fit it with liquid-cooled Allison V-1710-89 V-12 engines. It was to be an improved B-17, and an alternative if the normally fitted air-cooled Wright R-1820 radial engines became scarce. Completing the modifications took less than a year, and the XB-38 made its first flight on May 19, 1943. Only one was built, and it was modified from a regular production aircraft.

The XB-38 delivered a higher top speed, but its ceiling was lower. After a few flights it was grounded due to exhaust gas leaks from the engine manifolds. Once this had been fixed, testing resumed until the ninth flight on June 16, 1943 when the inboard starboard engine caught fire and the crew bailed out. The XB-38 was destroyed and the project was canceled, in part because the V-1710 engines were in high demand for Lockheed P-38 Lightning, Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and North American P-51A Mustang fighters.

<text>Pascal Cygan (born 29 April 1974) is a French former footballer who played as a defender. His favoured position was central defender, but he could also play as a left back.

After starting out at Lille in his country, Cygan would play four years in the Premier League with Arsenal and three in La Liga with Villarreal, in a 17-year professional career.

==Early life==
Cygan was born in Lens, Pas-de-Calais.

==Career==
===Lille===
Cygan started his senior career in the ranks of lowly ES Wasquehal before going professional with Lille OSC in 1995, making his Division 1 debut that year but also going on to also spend three seasons in Division 2. In 1999–2000 he was an instrumental defensive element for the champions and, in the subsequent top-flight campaign, helped them achieve a third-place finish, with qualification to the UEFA Champions League.

In this time, Cygan was also promoted to the captaincy, seen as a role model to help develop the younger players. He was also winner of the &quot;Etoile d&#x27;Or&quot; in his last year in France.

===Arsenal===
Cygan joined Arsenal in July 2002 for £2 million, making his debut in a 1–1 draw with Chelsea on 1 September after coming on as a late substitute for Nwankwo Kanu. While he featured notably in some of the team&#x27;s more important fixtures, he was mostly considered only a fringe player; he missed the 2003 FA Cup final through injury, but did pick up a Premier League winners&#x27; medal in 2004 after contributing with 18 appearances.

Cygan scored three goals for Arsenal in league action, including an unlikely brace in his first game of 2005–06 against Fulham (4–1 home win). Until then he had only netted once, against Everton in March 2003.

Also that season, following injuries to both Ashley Cole and Gaël Clichy, Cygan was drafted in as an emergency left back, and was even named in the &quot;Opta&quot; team of the week on 9 January 2006. Overall, his side won 12 of the 20 matches he played in and kept 11 clean sheets in the process. He suffered a hamstring injury in January against Middlesbrough and was unable to play again that season as he was fourth choice behind Sol Campbell, Philippe Senderos and Kolo Touré, with young Johan Djourou also competing for a place. 

Cygan played 98 competitive games during his spell at Highbury, including 20 in the Champions League.

===Spain===
In August 2006, Cygan completed a transfer to Villarreal CF for a £2 million transfer fee, joining former Arsenal teammate and compatriot Robert Pires at the club. On 6 June 2008, after having been fairly used in his first two years, mainly due to consecutive serious injuries to Gonzalo Rodríguez, he signed a new one-year deal. However, following a lack of first-team opportunities in 2008–09, and with Villarreal unwilling to extend his contract for a further campaign, he left in July 2009; his La Liga goals came on 5 November 2006 against Real Betis (3–2 home win), and against Levante UD on 31 October 2007 (3–0, also at El Madrigal).

On 10 August 2009, Cygan joined FC Cartagena, recently promoted to Segunda División, on a one-year deal. Aged 37, he was released by the Murcians and retired from professional football.

<doc id="1293589" wikidata="Q285246" url="?curid=1293589" title="De Havilland Canada">
<text>De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited (DHC) is a Canadian aircraft manufacturer that has produced numerous aircraft models since its inception including the popular Dash 8. The company&#x27;s primary facilities were located in the Downsview area of Toronto, Ontario, for many years; in 2022, it was announced that it would relocate primary manufacturing to De Havilland Field, under development near Calgary, Alberta. The aircraft types currently in production or planned for production include the DHC-6 Twin Otter, DHC-8 Dash 8, and DHC-515 Firefighter.

DHC was created in 1928 by the British de Havilland Aircraft Company to build Moth aircraft for the training of Canadian airmen, and subsequently after the Second World War, designed and produced indigenous designs. In the 1980s, the government of Canada under Prime Minister Brian Mulroney privatized DHC and in 1986 sold the aircraft company to then Seattle-based Boeing. DHC was eventually acquired by Montreal-based Bombardier Aerospace in 1992 after cumulative losses of US$636 million over five years under Boeing.

In 2006, Viking Air of Victoria, British Columbia, purchased the type certificates for all the original out-of-production de Havilland designs (DHC-1 to DHC-7). In November 2018, Viking Air&#x27;s holding company, Longview Aviation Capital, announced the acquisition of the Dash 8 and Q400 program, the last DHC designs still held by Bombardier, along with the rights to the DHC name and trademark. The deal, which closed on 3 June 2019 following regulatory approval, brought the entire Canadian de Havilland product line under the same banner for the first time in decades, under a new holding company named De Havilland Aircraft of Canada Limited.

In the summer of 2021, DHC stopped production at its Downsview site and officially closed it in the summer of 2022 at the end of its lease. In September 2022, DHC announced its plans to construct a new manufacturing facility, De Havilland Field, in Wheatland County, Alberta. The new facility is intended to merge its two manufacturing facilities and produce the Twin Otter and Dash 8 planes, as well as the new DHC-515 firefighting aircraft. First production at the new site is planned to begin in 2025.

== Establishment ==
Founded in 1928 as a subsidiary of de Havilland Aircraft (UK), de Havilland Canada was first located at De Lesseps Field in Toronto, before moving to Downsview Airport in 1929.

The original home of De Havilland Canada was the Canadian Air and Space Museum located in what is now Downsview Park.

== Pre-Second World War ==

Flown for the first time on 26 October 1931, the DH.82 Tiger Moth was derived from the DH.60 Moth. The DH 82 was powered by a 120-hp Gipsy II engine, but the 1939 DH.82a received the 145-hp Gipsy Major. More than 1,000 Tiger Moths were delivered before the Second World War, and subsequently 4,005 were built in the UK and shipped all over the world; 1,747 were built in Canada (the majority being the DH.82c model with enclosed cockpits, brakes, tail wheels, etc.). The follow-up DH.83 Fox Moth was designed in England in 1932 as a light, economical transport and was built using as many Tiger Moth components as possible.

== Second World War ==
The de Havilland Tiger Moth was a basic trainer of the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan during the Second World War, whereby air crews from all over the British Commonwealth trained in Canada. DHC was the Canadian unit of the parent British de Havilland and during World War II was made into a crown corporation of the government of Canada.

Production of the Mosquito, nicknamed the &quot;Mossie&quot;, was the company&#x27;s greatest contribution to the war effort. It was one of the few front-line aircraft of the era constructed almost entirely of wood and was nicknamed the &quot;Wooden Wonder&quot;. The Mosquito was designed to use speed instead of defensive armament to evade attack, and as a result, it was one of the fastest aircraft in the war, reaching 425 mph at 30,000 ft. The original design was intended as a light bomber, but soon proved itself in high-level photography and every phase of intruder operations.

Of the more than 7,000 Mosquitoes produced overall by de Havilland, de Havilland Canada produced 1,134. Some 500 were delivered to the UK by the end of the war, although several were lost en route across the Atlantic.

== Post-war era ==
After the war, de Havilland Canada began to build its own designs uniquely suited to the harsh Canadian operating environment. The company also continued production of several British de Havilland aircraft and later produced a licence-built version of the American-designed Grumman S2F Tracker. In 1962, the Avro Canada aircraft production facility was transferred to de Havilland Canada by their then-merged parent company, UK-based Hawker Siddeley.

=== DHC-1 Chipmunk ===

The first true postwar aviation project was the DHC-1 Chipmunk, designed as a primary trainer, a replacement for the venerable Tiger Moth. The Chipmunk was an all-metal, low-wing, tandem two-place, single-engined airplane with a conventional landing gear, powered by a de Havilland Gipsy Major engine. The Chipmunk prototype first flew on 22 May 1946 in Toronto. DHC built 217 in Canada, and it was also produced under licence by de Havilland in the UK, which produced 1,000, and by OGMA in Portugal, which built an additional 66. The Chipmunk served with the RCAF, the Royal Air Force (RAF), and at least twelve other air forces. After being largely phased out by the RAF and RCAF in the 1950s and 1960s, surplus Chipmunks achieved widespread popularity for civil sport flying, competition aerobatics, aerial application, and glider towing.

=== DHC-2 Beaver ===

Developed in 1947 for bush flying, the DHC-2 Beaver was designed with input from Canada&#x27;s bush pilots, who desired a rugged and highly versatile &quot;aerial truck&quot; that would reliably deliver short takeoff and landing (STOL) performance from unimproved airstrips with a half-ton load. An all-metal, high wing monoplane, the Beaver could be equipped with wheels, skis, or floats, and was originally powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney R-985 Wasp Junior piston engine. The Beaver was soon adopted by the US Air Force (USAF) and US Army as a liaison aircraft, remaining in service well into the 1970s, and was also used by the militaries of numerous other nations, including Britain, Chile, and Colombia. With almost 1,700 built in a production run lasting two decades, civil Beavers continue plying their trade in many countries around the world. A turboprop conversion, the Turbo Beaver first flew in December 1963, featuring a Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A engine. The Turbo Beaver offered improved operating weights and STOL performance, along with a longer cabin, allowing maximum accommodation for 11 including the pilot. DHC offered turboprop conversion kits to upgrade piston-powered Beavers, and similar conversions have been performed by aftermarket companies.
=== DHC-3 Otter ===

A follow-on design to the Beaver—originally conceived in 1951 as the King Beaver—the DHC-3 Otter was designed for the same basic roles and is similar in layout, but is a substantially larger and heavier aircraft, a veritable &quot;one-ton truck&quot; that can seat up to eleven. The Otter was originally produced with a 450-kW (600-hp) Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1340 Wasp radial engine, and like the Beaver, the Otter can be fitted with skis and floats; the Otter amphibian features a four-unit retractable undercarriage, with the wheels retracting into the floats. The type&#x27;s first flight was undertaken on 12 December 1951 and Canadian certification was awarded in November 1952. The US Army became the largest user of the Otter, and other military users included Australia, Canada, and India. Some Otters have been converted to turboprop power by Cox Air Services using a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop, yielding a lower empty weight and a higher maximum speed, and a number of other aftermarket PT6A conversions have been offered. The Otter found a significant niche as a STOL bush aircraft and many remain in service.
=== DHC-4 Caribou ===

The DHC-4 Caribou was a rugged STOL design like the Beaver and Otter, but it had two engines and was conceived primarily as a military transport, designed in response to a US Army requirement for a tactical airlifter to supply the battlefront with troops and supplies and evacuate casualties on the return journey. The DHC-4 first flew on 30 July 1958. The US Army ordered five for evaluation and went on to become the largest Caribou operator, taking delivery of 159, initially as the AC-1 and later as the CV-2. These aircraft were transferred to the USAF in 1967 and redesignated as the C-7, seeing extensive service during the Vietnam War, where some were captured by North Vietnamese forces and operated until the late 1970s. Other notable military operators included Canada, Australia, Malaysia, India, and Spain. The type&#x27;s ruggedness and STOL capabilities also appealed to some commercial users and US certification was awarded on 23 December 1960. Other Caribou entered commercial service after being retired by the military, and some civil Caribou have been fitted with turboprop engines.
=== DHC-5 Buffalo ===

Known originally as the Caribou II, the DHC-5 Buffalo was basically an enlarged DHC-4 with turboprop engines and a T-tail, developed to meet a US Army requirement for a STOL tactical airlifter with greater load-carrying ability than the DHC-4. The Buffalo made its maiden flight on 9 April 1964, but the US Army soon transferred heavy fixed-wing aircraft operations to the USAF, which had little interest in the Buffalo; only four evaluation aircraft were delivered to the US military, two of which were later transferred to NASA for research. The improved DHC-5A transport was acquired by Canadian Armed Forces (as the CC-115), the Brazilian Air Force and the Peruvian Air Force, and the production line was then shut down, but it was reopened after the enhanced DHC-5D was introduced in response to interest by other military users. In the early 1980s, de Havilland Canada attempted to market the Buffalo for civil use as the &quot;Transporter&quot;, but the demonstration aircraft crashed at the 1984 Farnborough Airshow and the project was abandoned.
=== DHC-6 Twin Otter ===

One of Canada&#x27;s most successful commercial aircraft designs with more than 990 built, the Twin Otter remains popular for its rugged construction and STOL capabilities. Development dates back to January 1964, when DHC commenced work on a twin turboprop variant of the DHC-3 Otter as a STOL commuter airliner and utility transport. The wings were lengthened, the rear fuselage, tail, and nose were redesigned, and seating capacity was increased to 18. Design features included double-slotted trailing-edge flaps and flaperons (ailerons that act in unison with the flaps) to boost STOL performance. The type&#x27;s first flight on 20 May 1965. After receiving certification in mid-1966, the first Twin Otter variant, the Series 100, entered service with the Ontario Department of Lands and Forests. The Series 200, introduced in April 1968, had an extended nose and reconfigured rear cabin storage compartment, greatly increasing cargo space. The Series 300, introduced in 1969, had more powerful engines, allowing a 450-kg (1,000-lb) increase in takeoff weight and a 20-seat interior. All models can be fitted with skis or floats. DHC production ceased in late 1988, but in 2010, Viking Air restarted Twin Otter production with the introduction of the Series 400. Production was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic; in July 2022, the company announced that it was reviewing the programme and supply chain, with a decision on when to resume production expected &quot;in the near future&quot;.
=== DHC-7 Dash 7 ===

The four-engined DHC-7, popularly known as the Dash 7, was designed as a STOL 50-seat regional airliner capable of operating from strips as short as in length. It was meant to serve small city airports, where noise abatement requirements were particularly strict, and featured four slow-turning propellers to cut noise. To enhance its STOL performance, the Dash 7 employs many aerodynamic devices, such as double-slotted wing flaps that span about 75% of the trailing edge of the wing and four spoilers per wing; on landing, the flaps partially retract and the spoilers fully deploy to maximize braking. Financial backing from the Canadian government allowed the launch of the DHC-7 program in the early 1970s, resulting in the maiden flight on 27 March 1975. The type was certificated on 2 May 1977 and entered service with Rocky Mountain Airways on 3 February 1978. Offered in passenger, freighter, and combi aircraft configurations, production of the Dash 7 ended in 1988 following Boeing&#x27;s takeover of DHC.
=== DHC-8 Dash 8 ===

De Havilland Canada began development of the Dash 8 in the late 1970s in response to high anticipated demand for regional airliners. Like the Dash 7, the Dash 8 features a high-mounted wing and T-tail, an advanced flight control system, and large full-length trailing-edge flaps, but power is supplied by two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW120 turboprops, emphasizing operating economy over STOL performance—a major departure for DHC that proved very successful. The first flight took place on 20 June 1983, Canadian certification was awarded on 28 September 1984, and the first customer delivery was to NorOntair on 23 October 1984. When the Dash 8 was introduced, many older regional airliners were becoming obsolescent and expensive to operate but few modern aircraft were immediately available to replace them, leading to substantial Dash 8 sales; to date, over 1,000 have been delivered. The Dash 8 has been offered in several lengths and operating weights, but in 2008, Bombardier announced the discontinuation of the shorter and less powerful variants, leaving the Q400 as the only Dash 8 still in production.

As of February 2023, De Havilland Canada has four DHC-8s registered with Transport Canada and operate as ICAO airline designator DHC, and telephony DEHAVILLAND.
=== DHC-515 Firefighter ===

In 2022, de Havilland Canada announced that an improved version of the Canadair CL-415 amphibious aerial firefighting aircraft will be produced at a new assembly line in Calgary, Alberta, as the DHC-515 Firefighter.
== Aircraft built under licence ==

The de Havilland Canada company produced a large number of aircraft under licence, mostly versions of designs from its original parent company, British de Havilland Aircraft.

=== de Havilland Fox Moth ===
Fox Moths were produced in Canada after the Second World War mainly to keep the plant in production, but also to satisfy the increasing need for new bush aircraft. All the Canadian modifications made to the Tiger Moth were also applied to the Fox Moth. de Havilland designed a special stretcher for the Fox Moth, so it could operate as an air ambulance. Of the 53 produced, 39 remained in Canada, most of which were operated in float/ski configuration and gave years of satisfactory service.

The Fox Moth, though efficient, was a bit of an anachronism. For example, a modern, moulded plexiglas sliding cockpit hood was attached to what was essentially a 1932 aircraft. Communication between the passenger cabin in the fuselage and the cockpit to the rear was through a hole in the instrument panel.

=== de Havilland Mosquito ===
Before the end of the Second World War, de Havilland Canada built 1,134 Mosquitos, of which 444 were on strength with the RCAF in models Bomber Mk VII through Trainer Mk 29 from 1 June 1943 to 28 September 1951.

=== de Havilland Canada (Grumman) CS2F Tracker ===
In 1954, the Royal Canadian Navy decided to replace its fleet of obsolescent Grumman TBM Avenger antisubmarine warfare (ASW) aircraft with domestically produced, licence-built versions of the new Grumman S2F Tracker. The contract for the CS2F was worth , at the time, the largest post-Second World War Canadian defence contract. Subassemblies of the aircraft would be produced by various Canadian companies and shipped to de Havilland Canada facilities, where de Havilland would build the forward fuselage and crew compartment, assemble the aircraft, oversee installation of the ASW electronics, and prepare the aircraft for delivery.

The first Canadian-built Tracker flew on 31 May 1956. A total of 99 Trackers was produced for RCN service starting in the same year. A few of these aircraft would serve with the Canadian military until the 1990s.

A few ex-CF Trackers were sold to Ministry of Natural Resources (Ontario) (and later resold to Conair) for forest firefighting duties.

== Hydrofoil ==
HMCS &quot;Bras d&#x27;Or&quot; (FHE 400) was a hydrofoil built from 1960 to 1967 for the Royal Canadian Navy. It served from 1968 to 1971 as a testing platform for antisubmarine warfare technology on an ocean-going hydrofoil. During sea trials in 1969, the vessel exceeded 63 knots (117 km/h; 72 mph), making her possibly the fastest warship in the world. The vessel was constructed at Marine Industries Limited of Sorel, Quebec, with de Havilland Canada the prime contractor.

Retired by the navy, the hydrofoil now is displayed at the Musée maritime du Québec in L&#x27;Islet-sur-Mer, Quebec.

== Privatization ==

In the 1980s, the government of Canada privatized DHC and in 1986 sold the aircraft company to then Seattle-based Boeing. 
Boeing said it intended to make substantial investments for product development and modernization of the de Havilland plant. The Canadian government claimed to have guarantees from Boeing not to discontinue any product lines, but shortly thereafter, Boeing discontinued both the successful Twin Otter and the Dash 7. The jigs and specialised equipment for their manufacture were destroyed.

Boeing was in heavy competition with Airbus Industrie for a series of new airliners for Air Canada, at that time a Canadian crown corporation. Boeing used the DHC purchase to further strengthen its commitment to shared production contracts. The contract was particularly contentious. When Air Canada announced that Airbus had won the contract in 1988, amid claims of bribery, Boeing immediately put DHC up for sale, placing the company in jeopardy.

=== Sale to Bombardier ===
DHC was eventually acquired by Montreal-based Bombardier Aerospace in 1992. DHC was eventually incorporated into the Bombardier group of companies and the Dash 8 remained in production, with a particular emphasis being placed on its quiet operation in comparison to other aircraft of a similar size. This product line was expanded to four models, and the largest is labelled Q400.

=== Purchase by Viking/Longview ===
On 24 February 2006, Viking Air of Victoria purchased the type certificates from Bombardier Aerospace for all the original de Havilland designs, including:

* DHC-1 Chipmunk
* DHC-2 Beaver
* DHC-3 Otter
* DHC-4 Caribou
* DHC-5 Buffalo
* DHC-6 Twin Otter
* DHC-7 Dash 7

The ownership of the certificates gives Viking the exclusive right to manufacture new aircraft; previously, Viking had purchased in May 2005 the right to manufacture spares and distribute the de Havilland heritage aircraft product line.

Despite the transfer of its light aircraft certificates to a new owner, de Havilland Canada left a legacy of innovative and unique aerospace designs and its products are still flying in considerable numbers worldwide, and it became a productive member of the Bombardier Aerospace stable. The Downsview plant still continued to turn out civilian propeller aircraft after the ownership change, with the facility maintaining thousands of employees.

In November 2018, Viking Air parent Longview Aviation Capital Corporation acquired the Bombardier Dash 8 programme and the de Havilland brand from Bombardier, in a deal that was expected to close by the second half of 2019. In January 2019, Longview announced that it would establish a new company in Ontario, to be called De Havilland Aircraft Co. of Canada, to continue production of the Q400 model and support the Dash 8 range. The deal closed on 3 June 2019; the newly formed company inherited an order book of 51 Q400s. Longview did not intend to merge Viking Air and De Havilland. Some 1200 Bombardier staff transferred to the new De Havilland company, which intended to continue Dash 8-400 production at Downsview until a lease expires in 2023 and hopes to negotiate an extension to that date. Other Dash 8 variants are also under consideration, in particular to target the North American 50-seater market.

In February 2022, Longview consolidated its activities, with Viking Air, Longview Aviation, Pacific Sky Training and De Havilland Canada all being rebranded as De Havilland Aircraft of Canada.
In June 2022, after a celebration with 10 DHC types present, from a 1942 Tiger Moth to a 2019 DHC-8-400, the last DHC aircraft left the Downsview site and the offices were relocated to nearby Mississauga.

In September 2022, De Havilland Canada announced that Wheatland County, Alberta, was to be the location of its new production site, to be known as De Havilland Field. The new facility is to be built just East of Cheadle. The facility will initially manufacture the DHC-515 fire-fighting aircraft; the DHC-6 Twin Otter and the Dash 8-400 will also be assembled at De Havilland Field once production resumes.

<text>Non incautus futuri is a motto meaning &quot;Not Unmindful of the Future&quot;.

The motto is used on the crest of Washington and Lee University, located in Lexington, Virginia. It is also the motto of the Lee family, along with the name of the Futuri Society at Stratford Hall Plantation in Stratford, Virginia. The phase Ne incautus futuri meaning &quot;Be Not Unmindful of the Future&quot; was adopted as the motto of Hagerstown Business College, located in Hagerstown, Maryland in 1938. 

The motto was officially adopted by Leesburg, Virginia in 1998.

The quote on the Lee family crest was &quot;Ne incautus futuri&quot;, which holds the same translation.

<text>The Boeing YB-40 Flying Fortress was a modification for operational testing purposes of the B-17 Flying Fortress bomber aircraft, converted to act as a heavily armed gunship to support other bombers during World War II. At the time of its development, long-range fighter aircraft such as the North American P-51 Mustang were just entering quantity production, and thus were not yet available to accompany bombers all the way from England to Germany and back.

==Design and development==
Work on the prototype, Project V-139, began in September 1942 by converting the second production B-17F-1-BO (serial number 41-24341) built. Conversion work was done by Lockheed&#x27;s Vega company.

The aircraft differed from the standard B-17 in that a second manned dorsal turret was installed in the former radio compartment, just behind the bomb bay and forward of the ventral ball turret&#x27;s location. The single .50-caliber light-barrel (12.7 mm) Browning machine gun at each waist station was replaced by two of them mounted side by side as a twin-mount emplacement, with a mount for each pair of these being very much like the tail gun setup in general appearance. The bombardier&#x27;s equipment was also replaced by two .50-caliber light-barrel Browning AN/M2 machine guns in a remotely operated Bendix designed &quot;chin&quot;-location turret, directly beneath the bombardier&#x27;s location in the extreme nose.

The existing &quot;cheek&quot; machine guns (on the sides of the forward fuselage at the bombardier station), initially removed from the configuration, were restored in England to provide a total of 16 guns, and the bomb bay was converted to an ammunition magazine. Additional armor plating was installed to protect crew positions.

The aircraft&#x27;s gross weight was some greater than a fully armed B-17. An indication of the burden this placed on the YB-40 is that while the B-17F on which it was based was rated to climb to in 25 minutes, the YB-40 was rated at 48 minutes. Part of the decreased performance was due to the weight increase, and part was due to the greater aerodynamic drag of the gun stations.

The first flight of the XB-40 was on 10 November 1942. The first order of 13 YB-40s was made in October 1942. A follow-up order for 12 more was made in January 1943. The modifications were performed by Douglas Aircraft at their Tulsa, Oklahoma center, and the first aircraft were completed by the end of March 1943. Twenty service test aircraft were ordered, Vega Project V-140, as YB-40 along with four crew trainers designated TB-40.

Because Vega had higher priority production projects, the YB-40/TB-40 assembly job was transferred to Douglas. A variety of different armament configurations was tried. Some YB-40s were fitted with four-gun nose and tail turrets. Some carried cannon of up to 40 mm in caliber, and a few carried up to as many as 30 guns of various calibers in multiple hand-held positions in the waist as well as in additional power turrets above and below the fuselage.

Externally, the XB-40 had the symmetrical waist windows of the standard B-17F and the second dorsal turret integrated into a dorsal fairing. In contrast, most of the YB-40s had the positions of the waist windows staggered for better freedom of movement for the waist gunners, and the aft dorsal turret was moved slightly backwards so that it stood clear of the dorsal fairing.

==Operational history==
The YB-40&#x27;s mission was to provide a heavily armed escort capable of accompanying bombers all the way to the target and back. Of the initial order of 13, one (serial 43-5732) was lost on the delivery flight from Iceland to the UK in May 1943; it force-landed in a peat bog on a Scottish island after running out of fuel. Although removed to Stornoway and repaired, it never flew in combat. The remaining 12 were allocated to the 92d Bombardment Group (Heavy), being assigned to the 327th Bombardment Squadron, stationed at RAF Alconbury (AAF-102) on 8 May 1943.

YB-40s flew in the following operational missions:

*29 May 1943 – attacked submarine pens and locks at Saint-Nazaire. Smaller strikes were made at Rennes naval depot and U-boat yards at La Pallice. In the attack, seven YB-40s were dispatched to Saint-Nazaire; they were unable to keep up with B-17s on their return from the target and modification of the waist and tail gun feeds and ammunition supplies was found to be needed. The YB-40s were sent to Technical Service Command at the Abbots Ripton 2nd Strategic Air Depot for modifications.
*15 June 1943 – four YB-40s were dispatched from Alconbury in a raid on Le Mans after completion of additional modifications.
*22 June 1943 – attack on the I.G. Farben synthetic rubber plant at Hüls. The plant, representing a large percentage of the Germany&#x27;s synthetic rubber producing capacity, was severely damaged. In the raid, 11 YB-40s were dispatched; aircraft 42-5735 was lost, being first damaged by flak and later shot down by a Focke-Wulf Fw 190A-2 of JG 1 over Pont, Germany. The 10 crew members survived and were taken prisoner.
*25 June 1943 – attack on Blohm &amp; Voss U-boat machine shops at Oldenburg. This was the secondary target, as the primary at Hamburg was obscured by clouds. In this raid, seven YB-40s were dispatched, of which two aborted. Two German aircraft were claimed as destroyed.
*26 June 1943 – scheduled but aborted participation in attack on the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air depot at Villacoublay, France (primary target) and also the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; airfield at Poissy, France. The five YB-40s assigned to the attack were unable to form up with the bombing squadron, and returned to base.
*28 June 1943 – attack on the U-boat pens at Saint-Nazaire. In the raid, the only serviceable lock entrance to the pens was destroyed. In this attack, six YB-40s were dispatched, and one German aircraft was claimed as destroyed.
*29 June 1943 – scheduled participation in attack on the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air depot at Villacoublay, but aircraft returned to Alconbury due to clouds obscuring the target. In the raid, two YB-40s dispatched, one aborted.
*4 July 1943 – attacks on aircraft factories at Nantes and Le Mans, France. In these raids, two YB-40s were dispatched to Nantes and one to Le Mans.
*10 July 1943 – attack on Caen/Carpiquet airfield. In this raid, five YB-40s were dispatched.
*14 July 1943 – attacked &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air depot at Villacoublay. In this raid, five YB-40s were dispatched.
*17 July 1943 – YB-40s recalled from a raid on Hannover due to bad weather. In this raid, two YB-40s were dispatched.
*24 July 1943 – YB-40s recalled from an attack on Bergen, Norway due to cloud cover. In this raid, one YB-40 was dispatched.
*28 July 1943 – attack on the Fieseler aircraft factory at Kassel. In this raid, two YB-40s were dispatched.
*29 July 1943 – attack on U-boat yards at Kiel. In this raid, two YB-40s were dispatched.

===Summary===
Altogether of the 59 aircraft dispatched, 48 sorties were credited. Five confirmed and two probable German fighter kills were claimed, and one YB-40 was lost, shot down on 22 June mission to Hüls, Germany. Tactics were revised on the final five missions by placing a pair of YB-40s in the lead element of the strike to protect the mission commander.

The original design concept of the YB-40 never played out as intended in practice. Luftwaffe fighter chief Adolf Galland considered the gunship&#x27;s handful of combat victories to be &quot;insignificant&quot; and not worth the cost of the aircraft. The increased weight from the additional machine guns and ammunition nearly cut the YB-40&#x27;s climb rate in half from that of a B-17F, and in level flight it had difficulty keeping up with standard Flying Fortresses, especially after they had dropped their bombs. Despite the overall failure of the project as an operational aircraft, it led directly to the Bendix chin turret&#x27;s fitment on the last 65 (86 according to some sources) Douglas-built aircraft starting with the B-17F-70-DL production block, and were part of the standardized modifications conspicuous on the final production variant of the B-17, the B-17G:
*Chin turret (first introduced on the last 86 Douglas-built &quot;final production&quot; blocks of the B-17F-DL aircraft)
*Offset waist gun positions
*Improved tail gunner station with much larger windows, usually nicknamed the &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, after the Cheyenne Modification Center.

Once the test program ended, most of the surviving aircraft returned to the U.S. in November 1943 and were used as trainers. 42-5736 (&quot;Tampa Tornado&quot;) was flown to RAF Kimbolton on 2 October 1943 where it was put on display and later used as a group transport. It was returned to the United States on 28 March 1944. All of the aircraft were sent to reclamation, mostly at RFC Ontario in May 1945, being broken up and smelted. A couple of the YB-40s can be seen in the 1946 movie &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, in the famous scene shot at the Ontario &quot;graveyard&quot;. No airframes were sold on the civil market.

<text>The Phillips Collection is an art museum founded by Duncan Phillips and Marjorie Acker Phillips in 1921 as the Phillips Memorial Gallery located in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Phillips was the grandson of James H. Laughlin, a banker and co-founder of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company.

Among the artists represented in the collection are Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Courbet, El Greco, Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Pierre Bonnard, Paul Klee, Arthur Dove, Winslow Homer, James McNeill Whistler, Jacob Lawrence, Augustus Vincent Tack, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Karel Appel, Joan Miró, Mark Rothko and Berenice Abbott.

==History==
Duncan Phillips (1886–1966) played a seminal role in introducing America to modern art. Born in Pittsburgh—the grandson of James H. Laughlin, a banker and co-founder of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company—Phillips and his family moved to Washington, D.C., in 1895. He, along with his mother, established The Phillips Memorial Gallery after the sudden, untimely deaths of his brother, James Laughlin Phillips (May 30, 1884 – 1918), and of his father, Duncan Clinch Phillips (1838–1917), a Pittsburgh window glass millionaire and member of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, owners of the dam whose failure resulted in the Johnstown Flood.

Beginning with a small family collection of paintings, Phillips, a published art critic, expanded the collection dramatically. A specially built room over the north wing of the family home provided a public gallery space. With the collection exceeding 600 works and facing public demand, the Phillips family moved to a new home in 1930, turning the entire 21st Street residence into an art museum.

Duncan Phillips married painter Marjorie Acker in 1921. With her assistance and advice, Phillips developed his collection &quot;as a museum of modern art and its sources&quot;, believing strongly in the continuum of artists influencing their successors through the centuries. His focus on the continuous tradition of art was revolutionary when America was largely critical of modernism, which was seen as a break from the past. Phillips collected works by masters such as El Greco, calling him the &quot;first impassioned expressionist&quot;; Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin because he was &quot;the first modern painter&quot;; Francisco Goya because he was &quot;the stepping stone between the Old Masters and the Great Moderns like Cézanne&quot;; and Édouard Manet, a &quot;significant link in a chain which began with Goya and which [led] to Gauguin and Matisse.&quot;

Polly Fritchey, hostess and wife of columnist Clayton Fritchey, helped the Phillips Collection evolve from a small family museum into a public art gallery and was one of the first trustees appointed from outside the family. Moreover, she helped launch its national fundraising campaign.

==Collection==

The Phillips Collection, opened in 1921, is America&#x27;s first museum of modern art. Featuring a permanent collection of nearly 3,000 works by American and European impressionist and modern artists, the Phillips is recognized for both its art and its intimate atmosphere. It is housed in founder Duncan Phillips’ 1897 Georgian Revival home and two similarly scaled additions in Washington, D.C.’s Dupont Circle neighborhood.

The museum is noted for its broad representation of both impressionist and modern paintings, with works by European masters such as Gustave Courbet, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Jacques Villon, Paul Cézanne, Honoré Daumier, Edgar Degas, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Klee, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, and Pablo Picasso. In 1923, Phillips purchased Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s impressionist painting, &quot;Luncheon of the Boating Party&quot; (1880–81), the museum’s best-known work.

From the 1920s to the 1960s, Phillips re-arranged his galleries in installations that were non-chronological and non-traditional, reflecting the relationships he saw between various artistic expressions. He presented visual connections—between past and present, between classical form and romantic expression—as dialogues on the museum&#x27;s walls. Giving equal focus to American and European artists, Phillips juxtaposed works by Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Maurice Prendergast, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, and Albert Pinkham Ryder with canvases by Pierre Bonnard, Peter Ilsted and Édouard Vuillard. He exhibited watercolors by John Marin with paintings by Cézanne, and works by van Gogh with El Greco’s &quot;The Repentant St. Peter&quot; (circa 1600–05). Phillips’ vision brought together &quot;congenial spirits among the artists,&quot; and his ideas still guide the museum today.

The Phillips Collection is also known for its groups of works by artists whom Phillips particularly favored. For example, he was overwhelmed by Bonnard&#x27;s expressive use of color, acquiring 17 paintings by the artist. Cubist pioneer Braque is represented by 13 paintings, including the monumental still-life &quot;The Round Table&quot; (1929). The collection has an equal number of works by Klee, such as &quot;Arab Song&quot; (1932) and &quot;Picture Album&quot; (1937), as well as seven pieces by abstract expressionist artist Mark Rothko.
The Rothko Room, the first public space dedicated solely to the artist&#x27;s work, was designed by Phillips in keeping with Rothko&#x27;s expressed preference for exhibiting his large, luminous paintings in a small, intimate space, saturating the room with color and sensation. The Rothko Room is the only existing installation for the artist&#x27;s work in collaboration with the artist himself. Phillips was initially attracted to Rothko&#x27;s work because he saw the use of color as similar to Bonard&#x27;s.

Throughout his lifetime, Phillips acquired paintings by many artists who were not fully recognized at the time, among them John Marin, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Nicolas de Staël, Milton Avery, Betty Lane and Augustus Vincent Tack. By purchasing works by such promising but unknown artists, Phillips provided them with the means to continue painting. He formed close bonds with and subsidized several artists who are prominently featured in the collection—Dove and Marin in particular—and consistently purchased works by artists and students for what he called his &quot;encouragement collection.&quot; The museum also served as a visual haven for artists such as Richard Diebenkorn, Gene Davis, and Kenneth Noland. In a 1982 tribute to the museum, Noland acknowledged, &quot;I’ve spent many hours of many days in this home of art. You can be with art in the Phillips as in no other place I know.&quot;

In 2013, the museum opened its second permanent installation, a room covered in wax by artist Wolfgang Laib. Though Laib&#x27;s work is often interpreted as evocative of nature, the piece, which is 6 feet by 7 feet and illuminated by one bare bulb, can also seem harsh and enigmatic. Laib became interested in the site-specific installation, which requires about 500 pounds of wax, after visiting the museum&#x27;s Rothko Room.

==Building==

The Phillips Collection is housed in a distinctive space in Washington&#x27;s Dupont Circle neighborhood. From the beginning, Duncan Phillips exhibited his collection in special galleries at his home. A Georgian Revival house dating to 1897, listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Duncan Phillips House, it now forms the southern section of the museum building; the north section of the collection is called the Goh Annex. 

Over time, the building was adapted to include more galleries and offices, particularly after the Phillips family moved out in 1930. In 1960, Phillips added a modernist wing. This addition was renovated and reconceived in 1989 with the aid of a $1.5 million gift from Japanese businessman Yasuhiro Goh and his wife Mes. Hiroko Goh, the addition is known as the Goh Annex, it is named in their honor.

===2006 renovation and expansion project===
To accommodate its ever-growing collection of art, audiences, and activities, the Phillips completed a major building project in April 2006. With 65 percent of the added located below ground, the expansion preserves the intimate scale and residential quality that distinguishes The Phillips Collection, as well as respects the character of the Dupont Circle neighborhood. The new spaces, known as the Sant Building, incorporate expanded galleries, among them the first to accommodate larger-scale post-1950s work; a 180-seat auditorium for lectures, films, and events; an outdoor courtyard; and a new shop and café. The architect for the new building was Arthur Cotton Moore. Two of the most notable elements of the new structure are the winding white interior staircase and the external sculptural stone relief of a bird relating to Georges Braque&#x27;s painting &quot;Bird&quot; from the museum&#x27;s collection.

=== The University of Maryland Center for Art and Knowledge at The Phillips Collection ===
The 2006 addition also made possible The Phillips Collection Center for the Study of Modern Art. This new museum-based educational model brought together scholars from across academic fields in an ongoing forum for discussion, research, and publishing on modern art. The two-story building, formerly the carriage house, is the site of the lively programs and classes on modern and contemporary art and artists. 

In 2015, the Phillips launched a partnership with The University of Maryland with a shared vision to transform scholarship and innovation in the arts. the Center was renamed The &quot;University of Maryland Center for Art and Knowledge at The Phillips Collection&quot;, which is the expansion of the Center for the Study of Modern Art in the museum and the nexus for academic work, scholarly exchange, and innovative interdisciplinary collaborations.

Some of the key collaborations of the partnership include developing a new arts curriculum and extended studies courses, postdoctoral fellowships, a biennial book prize, and programming and events.

Bread Furst is the current Café at the Phillips Collection, it is artisanal bakery founded by Mark Furstenberg, it also serves wines, empanadas and other creations by Mark&#x27;s team of chefs.

==Services==

Phillips collections offers education services in collaboration with District of Columbia Public Schools and other institutions in the area, it also present many live programs in the main building both in the house and in the galleries section.

===Education===
Since the museum&#x27;s early years, when art classes were held on the third floor of the house, significant attention has been given to educational outreach. Today, the museum features an active schedule of lectures, gallery talks, classes, parent/child workshops, and teacher training programs. It also reaches out to the community through initiatives such as Art Links to Literacy, combining programs for underserved students at District of Columbia Public Schools and their parents and caregivers with professional development for their teachers. These and other ventures are facilitated by new exhibition spaces for student art, an art activity room for hands-on education projects, and an art technology lab for developing interactive resources based on the museum&#x27;s educational programs.

In 2015, the museum joined forces with the University of Maryland. The two institutions will work together to establish the University of Maryland Center for Art and Knowledge at the Phillips Collection.

===Programs===

Phillips After 5 combines live jazz, gallery talks, modern art, and a cash bar on the first Thursday of every month from 5 to 8:30 pm.

Sunday Concerts, founded in 1941, offer classical chamber music in the intimacy of the museum&#x27;s oak-paneled Music Room. The concerts have featured ensembles and soloists ranging from Glenn Gould, Jessye Norman, Jean-Yves Thibaudet, and Emanuel Ax to some of the most talented young musicians performing today. Sunday Concerts are held from October through May. They begin promptly at 4 pm.

Live music is presented in the House, with local musician performances and sometimes visitor musicians from abroad. They are presented in many events, among them the yearly New Year Celebration, the Phillips Collection anniversary among other events.

Centennial music commission are creative dialogues between music and visual art, where composers respond to works in the collection. These audiovisual artworks free to reproduce on the Phillips collection website.
In December 2009, The Pink Line Project put together a multimedia evening called &quot;Art Is _____.&quot; Visitors were invited to remix the definition of art, using Duncan Phillips&#x27;s writings as source material. Guests could send text messages to a computer engineer who projected them onto a wall, creating a group art project.

In 2021, the museum hosted a juried invitational exhibition titled &quot;Inside Outside, Upside Down&quot;, which was described by &quot;The Washington City Paper&quot; as forcing &quot;us to remember a time that left us &#x27;confused, battered, and disoriented&#x27; through the eyes of 64 D.C.-area artists.&quot;

Artwalks are events hold in the museum the third Thursday of every month between 5 P.M. and 8 P.M. A curator or an invited guest walk with visitors through the gallery while talk about the life and work of the author or authors and give insights of history behind the art works exposed.

Meditation is a free wellness activity led by local yoga teacher Aparna Sadananda. This weekly meditation is a 30-minute program presented initially as an in person activity, after COVID-19 pandemic is presented online, it is a free access activity that is held through Zoom software, a free videoconference tool that can be installed in mobile phones, laptops and Smart TVs.. The activity itself promote wellness and help to cope with the stress promoted by the current culture values and with the challenges brought by COVID-19 itself.

360-Degree tours are virtual tours of the museum exhibitions and installations it includes full screen images, the describing text of the art work, and audio guides.

==Directors==
When Duncan Phillips died in 1966, his wife Marjorie succeeded him as museum director. Their son, Laughlin, became director in 1972. He led The Phillips Collection through a multi-year program to ensure the physical and financial security of the collection, renovate and enlarge the museum buildings, expand and professionalize the staff, conduct research on the collection, and make the Phillips more accessible to the public. In 1992, Charles S. Moffett, a noted author and curator, was named director. Moffett was directly involved with the presentation of several ambitious exhibitions during his six-year tenure, including the memorable &quot;Impressionists on the Seine: A Celebration of Renoir’s &quot;Luncheon of the Boating Party&quot;&quot; in 1996.

Jay Gates became director in 1998. Under his leadership, The Phillips Collection continued to grow and broaden its presence in Washington, D.C., across the country, and internationally. Dorothy M. Kosinski, previously a curator at the Dallas Museum of Art, took over as director in May 2008. Kosinski became director emerita in 2023 as Jonathan Binstock, from the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester (NY), assumed the directorship.

<doc id="1293663" wikidata="Q5128364" url="?curid=1293663" title="Classicomm">
<text>Classicomm was a small cable provider in Canada serving communities in southern York Region from its offices in Richmond Hill, Ontario.
==History==
===Founding===
Classicomm, or Classic Communications Ltd, was founded in the late 1960s by John O. Graham and Stewart H. Coxford, who were granted a cable television (CATV) licence by the CRTC for Richmond Hill and several other small communities north of Toronto. 
===Growth===
By the 1980s the cable system had acquired additional licences, and soon covered a geographic area taking in most of southern York Region. With Steeles Avenue as its southerly service boundary, the cable system spanned the width of York Region from Markham in the east to Woodbridge in the west. Its coverage area stretched north to include communities such as Stouffville, King City, Kleinburg and Gormley.

Southern York Region experienced tremendous growth beginning around 1982. During the period of 1986–90 Classicomm was connecting up to 10,000 new subscribers each year, making it the fastest growing cable system of its day.

In 1984, the company applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission for permission to launch a classified advertising channel on the service, but the application was denied on the basis that cable companies were not permitted to compete with radio or television broadcasters for advertising revenue. The regulation was changed in 1986 to permit advertising channels. It was also one of the first cable companies in Canada to offer X*Press X*Change, an early foray into electronic news delivery.
===Sale to Shaw Communications===
The company was sold in 1995 to Shaw Communications of Calgary, for a purchase price of $240 million. When the transaction was first announced in 1994, Classicomm had 102,000 subscribers; when it was finalized the following year, the company had 105,000 subscribers. Along with Shaw&#x27;s simultaneous acquisition of Trillium Cable, the deal helped to make Shaw the second-largest cable company in Canada. 
===Sale to Rogers Cable===
A few years later, Rogers Cable of Toronto and Shaw Cable rationalized their cable holdings in Canada, with Shaw consolidating in western Canada and Rogers in central and eastern Canada. The Classicomm service area is now entirely part of Rogers Cable.

<doc id="1293674" wikidata="Q418315" url="?curid=1293674" title="Potassium ferrate">
<text>Potassium ferrate is an inorganic compound with the formula . It is the potassium salt of ferric acid. Potassium ferrate is a powerful oxidizing agent with applications in green chemistry, organic synthesis, and cathode technology.

==Synthesis==
Generally, there are three ways to produce hexavalent iron: dry oxidation, wet oxidation, and electrochemical synthesis. The methods used to produce potassium ferrate are similar to those used to produce sodium ferrate and barium ferrate.

=== Dry oxidation ===
The dry oxidation method entails heating or melting iron oxides in an alkaline, oxygenated environment. The combination of high temperature (200 °C - 800 °C) and oxygen presents an explosion hazard that has led many researchers to believe this method of production is not suitable from a safety viewpoint, although many attempts have been made to overcome this problem.

=== Wet oxidation ===
In the wet oxidation method, is prepared by oxidizing an alkaline solution of an iron(III) salt. Generally, this method employs either ferrous (FeII) or ferric (FeIII) salts as the source of iron ions, calcium, sodium hypochlorite (Ca(ClO)2, NaClO), sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) or chlorine (Cl2) as oxidizing agents and, finally, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate (NaOH, NaCO3) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) to increase the pH of the solution. For example:

=== Electrochemical synthesis ===
Electrochemical methods used to synthesize potassium ferrate usually consist of an iron anode which electrolyzes a KOH solution.

==Properties==

Potassium ferrate is a dark purple crystalline solid that dissolves in water to form a reddish-purple solution. The salt is paramagnetic and is isostructural with , , and . The solid consists of and the tetrahedral anion, with Fe-O distances of 1.66 Å. Potassium ferrate decomposes rapidly in neutral and acidic water, e.g.: 
In alkaline solution and as a dry solid, is stable. Under the acidic conditions, the oxidation–reduction potential of the ferrate(VI) ions (2.2 V) is greater than that of ozone (2.0 V).

== Applications ==
Like sodium ferrate, generally does not generate environmentally toxic by-products and can be used in water treatment processes. It can act as:

* Oxidizing agent: promoting the oxidation of organic species in metal complexes.
* Coagulator: allows removal of inorganic pollution compounds such as heavy metals, inorganic salts, trace elements and metal complexes.
* Disinfectant: destroys human pathogens including viruses, spores, bacteria and protozoa.

In addition, potassium ferrate can be used as a bleeding stopper for fresh wounds. In organic synthesis, oxidizes primary alcohols. has also attracted attention as a potential cathode material in a &quot;super iron battery.&quot;

Stabilised forms of potassium ferrate have been proposed for the removal of transuranium elements, both dissolved and suspended, from aqueous solutions. Tonnage quantities were proposed to help remediate the effects of the Chernobyl disaster in Belarus . This new technique was successfully applied for the removal of a broad range of heavy metals. Work on the use of potassium ferrate precipitation of transuranium elements and heavy metals was carried out in the Laboratories of IC Technologies Inc. in partnership with ADC Laboratories, in 1987 though 1992. The removal of the transuranium elements was demonstrated on samples from various Dept. of Energy nuclear sites in the USA.

Because the side products of its redox reactions are rust-like iron oxides, has been described as an &quot;environmentally friendly&quot; oxidant. In contrast, related oxidants such as chromates are considered environmentally hazardous.

== History ==
In 1702, Georg Ernst Stahl (1660 – 1734) observed that the ignition product of potassium nitrate (saltpetre) and iron powder displayed a red-purple color in an aqueous solution, which was eventually attributed to hexavalent potassium ferrate. Eckenberg and Becquerel in 1834 reported that a red-purple color appeared during heating of a mixture of potassium hydroxide and iron ore. In 1840, Edmond Frémy (1814 – 1894) discovered that fusion of potassium hydroxide and iron(III) oxide in air produced a high-capacity iron compound that was soluble in water:

<text>Peter Byard Davis (born 25 April 1947) is a New Zealand sociologist, professor, and the husband of Helen Clark, who was the Prime Minister of New Zealand from 1999 to 2008.

==Early life==
Davis was born in Milford on Sea, Hampshire, England, on 25 April 1947, and spent his childhood in Tanzania, where his father worked for a mining company. His father was born in China and his mother in India, but a great-great-grandfather had grown up in New Zealand. Davis gained a master&#x27;s degree in sociology and statistics at the London School of Economics. He moved to New Zealand in 1970 to work at the University of Canterbury and completed a PhD at the University of Auckland. He became a naturalised New Zealander in 1972. He was part of a team investigating oral health in New Zealand and was joint editor of the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Sociology. In 1976 he was appointed a lecturer at the University of Auckland school of medicine.

In 1980 he stood unsuccessfully for the Auckland City Council on a Labour Party ticket. In 1988 he was elected to the Auckland Regional Authority for the Mount Albert ward.

==Personal life==
Davis met Clark, then a political-science lecturer at Auckland, in 1977 and they married in 1981.

==Career==
Davis specialises in medical sociology, and from 2004 to 2017 worked as the Director of the COMPASS (Centre of Methods and Policy Application in the Social Sciences) Research Centre at the University of Auckland. In 2014 he was awarded a James Cook Research Fellowship for a research project titled &quot;New Zealand as a &#x27;social laboratory&#x27;&quot;. He is now Professor Emeritus in the School of Population Health and Honorary Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Auckland. Previously he served as Professor of Public Health at the University of Otago&#x27;s Christchurch School of Medicine.

He has previously served on the Auckland Area Health Board, and was a representative in 1989 when his wife (Health Minister at the time) suspended that body. Davis has achieved international recognition in his field, having worked as a consultant for the World Health Organization.

In 2019 Davis became a City Vision candidate for the Auckland District Health Board and was subsequently elected.

He is Chair of The Helen Clark Foundation board.

<text>Northeim (; ) is a town in Lower Saxony, Germany, seat of the district of Northeim, with a population of 30,118 as of 31 December 2023. It lies on the German Half-Timbered House Road.

==History==

Northeim is first mentioned in 800 in a document recording a property transfer by a Frankish nobleman to the Abbey of Fulda. In the 10th century the surrounding region became a county, administered by the Counts of Northeim. The first of them, Siegfried is mentioned in 982. From 1061 to 1070 Count Otto II held the stem duchy of Bavaria as an Imperial fief, but lost it again because of his involvement in the Saxon plot against King Henry IV.

The monastery of St. Blasius was founded around 1100. In 1252 Northeim obtained town rights, and from 1384 to 1554 it was a member of the Hanseatic League. When protestantism was introduced in 1532 all the churches were allocated to the protestants. The town became part of the Kingdom of Hanover.

A part of Northeim was devastated by a fire in 1832 when the representative town hall dating from the Middle Ages and more than 40 houses burnt down. Further damage was caused by a fire in 1892 which destroyed several historic buildings in the Market Place.

After the railway from Hanover to Göttingen had been inaugurated in 1854 Northeim gained in importance and became a railway junction. The South Harz Railway was opened in 1868 and the Solling Railway in 1878.
During the Second World War Northeim was hit by bombs in September 1944, February 1945 and in March 1945. The railway station, five factories and 18 houses were completely destroyed and 80 houses were damaged. The historic centre did not suffer severe bomb damage.

Northeim, under the pseudonym of &quot;Thalburg&quot;, is the subject of William Sheridan Allen&#x27;s book &quot;The Nazi Seizure of Power&quot; (), a comprehensive study of the success of Nazism at town level. The book describes how the Nazis took over all social groups in the town and Nazified them, but failed to instill positive enthusiasm for the Nazi state. Instead, the population was &quot;atomized&quot; and deprived of the means to express group grievances. The book has been criticized for neglecting the role of the churches, which remained largely autonomous. However, even its critics say that the book is crucial to our understanding of Nazi Germany and has played a key role in shaping scholarship. Imbshausen, the site of a post-World War II British sector Displaced Persons camp, was incorporated into the town in 1974.

On 15 November 1992 an express train crashed into the wreckage of a derailed freight train near Northeim. Eleven people died and 52 were injured.

==Culture==
The town has a town museum and archive. There is an outdoor stage outside the town. The town is also home to a puppet theatre, Theater der Nacht, which since 2001 has been housed in a redesigned fire station.

Some of the old town wall still stands, including a watchtower.

==Transport==
Hanoverian Southern Railway connects Northeim with cities like Göttingen and Hanover. Solling Railway connects Northeim with cities at the southern part of Solling-Vogler Nature Park.

Northeim also provides a small grass airfield (ICAO locator code: EDVN) due east of the town.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

Northeim is twinned with:
* Cherbourg-en-Cotentin, France
* Gallneukirchen, Austria
* Prudnik, Poland

==Inhabitants==

==Sights==
There are many well-preserved half-timbered houses in the old centre of Northeim, e.g. in &quot;Wassergasse&quot;, one of the most picturesque lanes, and in &quot;Kuhgasse&quot;, the narrowest lane of Northeim. The oldest half-timbered houses were built of oak wood in the 15th century. In many façades wood carvings are worth a look.

A part of the historic centre is still surrounded by the medieval wall which was built in 1252–1305.

The oldest church of Northeim is Saint Fabian&#x27;s and Sebastian&#x27;s Chapel which was built in a typical gothic style in the middle of the 14th century and renovated in 1985/86. Saint Sixti&#x27;s Church was built from 1464 to 1517. It houses a gothic altar dating from 1420 and another altar created in the 16th century. After the church had been allocated to the Protestants in 1539 there were no Catholics living in Northeim for several decades. The first catholic church to be built after the reformation was Saint Mary&#x27;s Church outside the historic town centre which was founded at the end of the 19th century.

Saint Spiritus Hospital is a large half-timbered house with wood carvings built around 1500.

Saint Blasii is a former monastery which was founded in the 11th century and dissolved in 1592 after the reformation.

In the village of Imbshausen which was incorporated into the city in 1974 a castle built 1862–64 in a large park is worth a visit.

Theater der Nacht is located in an old firestation, rebuilt and designed by the artists Ruth und Heiko Brochhausen. It opened in May 1999. The theatre&#x27;s speciality is Puppetry.

<text>Sing Tao Media Group (Canada) &quot;(Chinese:&quot; 加拿大星島傳媒集團&quot;)&quot;, or Sing Tao (Chinese: 星島; pinyin: &quot;Xīngdǎo&quot;) for short, is a Chinese language media group based in Toronto, Ontario. It offers digital and social media marketing, radio broadcasting, magazine publishing, events management and e-commerce to Chinese-Canadians, the second largest ethnic group in Canada.

The media brand began in Canada in 1978 as a Hong Kong-owned Chinese language newspaper. Today, it is the largest Chinese media group in Canada, reaching a community of 1.7 million nationwide.

Since 2023, it is jointly owned by a private Canadian corporation and the Hong Kong–based Sing Tao News Corporation. Previously, between 1998 and 2023, it was jointly owned by Torstar Corporation and Sing Tao News Corporation.

The company underwent a rebranding in Fall 2023, changing its operating name from Sing Tao Daily (Canada) to STMG to reflect how the company has been adapting to the changing media landscape, evolving from one daily newspaper to a diverse platform comprising digital, social, radio, print, experiential marketing, e-commerce and more.

The current CEO of the company is Anson Wong, who succeeded the retiring Calvin Wong in April 2023.

&quot;Sing Tao&quot;″s was connected to the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; through Andrew V. Go, former &quot;Star&quot; vice president for business ventures. Go&#x27;s father, Go Puan Seng, was the publisher of &quot;The Fookien Times&quot;, then the Philippines&#x27; largest Chinese-language newspaper which also published the Philippine edition of the &quot;Sing Tao&quot;, and was a family friend of then Sing Tao Group&#x27;s Sally Aw.

According to former editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Victor Ho, and Jonathan Manthorpe, author of &quot;Claws of the Panda&quot;, the newspaper&#x27;s editorial stance is pro-Beijing. However, it has since been clarified that the company is editorially independent.

In 2009, the top editor of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot;, Wilson Chan, was fired shortly after it was revealed that he drastically modified an original &quot;Toronto Star&quot; article on Tibet to remove criticisms of the Chinese government, before publishing the story in &quot;Sing Tao&quot;. The decision to remove Chan is said to have come from Torstar Corp, who owns a majority share in &quot;Sing Tao&quot;″s Canadian edition.

The original story, &quot;Chinese Canadians Conflicted on Tibet&quot;, which ran on April 13, 2008, was written by a reporter for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, an English-language newspaper also owned by Torstar Corporation. The relationship gives &quot;Sing Tao&quot; rights to translate and publish stories from the &quot;Star&quot;. Chan&#x27;s edits to the Chinese language story, which were revealed by media outlets in 2009, included changing the headline to, &quot;The West Attacks China With Tibet Issue, Inciting Chinese Patriotism Overseas&quot;. The edited version omitted all quotes critical of the Chinese regime&#x27;s human rights abuses and added comments blaming the West for &quot;suppressing China&quot; with media reports of the crackdown in Tibet.

<text>The Feast of the Sacred Heart is a solemnity in the liturgical calendar of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church. According to the General Roman Calendar since 1969, it is formally known as the Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus () and celebrated on the second Friday after Trinity Sunday . Some Anglican Franciscans keep the feast under the name of the Divine Compassion of Christ.

==History==
The first liturgical feast of the Sacred Heart was celebrated, with episcopal approval, on 31 August 1670, in the major seminary of Rennes, France, through the efforts of John Eudes. The Mass and Office composed by Eudes were adopted elsewhere also, especially in connection with the spread of devotion to the Sacred Heart following on the reported revelations to Margaret Mary Alacoque and Mary of the Divine Heart.
In June 1675, according to Margaret Mary Alacoque of the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary at Paray-le-Monial, France, she had a vision of Jesus Christ in which he asked her &quot;that the first Friday after the octave of the Blessed Sacrament be dedicated to a particular feast to honor my heart, by receiving communion on that day and making reparation to it by honorable amends, to repair the indignities it received during the time it was exposed on the altars&quot;.

In 1726 Rome was again asked for a feast with a Mass and Office of its own; this was refused in 1729, but granted in 1765. In that year, at the request of the queen, the feast was received quasi-officially by the episcopate of France. A Mass of the Sacred Heart won papal approval for use in Poland and Portugal in 1765, and another was approved for Venice, Austria and Spain in 1788.
In 1856, at the entreaties of the French bishops, Pope Pius IX extended the Feast of the Sacred Heart to the Latin Church under the rite of double major. It was to be celebrated on the Friday after the Octave of Corpus Christi. In June 1889, Leo XIII raised the feast to the dignity of the first class. In 1928, Pope Pius XI raised the feast to the highest rank, double of the first class, and added an octave; the 1955 reforms of the General Roman calendar suppressed, among others, the octave of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. With the liturgical changes in 1969, the feast was assigned the highest rank of solemnity.

The Mass prayers and readings approved on that occasion were replaced with new texts in 1929, and the lectionary published to accompany the 1970 Roman Missal provides three sets of readings, one for each year of the festive three-year liturgical cycle.

Priests may use this Mass, celebrated with white vestments, as a Votive Mass on other days also, especially on the first Friday of each month (unless falling on a day of higher rank). On this first Fridays it is also common to hold an Eucharistic adoration for a few hours (see First Friday devotion).

In Austria and South Tyrol, the so-called &quot;Sacred Heart Sunday&quot;, that is the Sunday after the Feast of the Sacred Heart, is also celebrated. Numerous processions take place on this day. Sacred Heart Fires are lit in the Bozen (Bolzano) area of Italy, among others.

Since 2002, the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus is also a special day of prayer for the sanctification of priests. In 2009, the feast marked the beginning of a &quot;Year for Priests&quot;.

The Feast of the Immaculate Heart of Mary immediately follows on Saturday.

On June 12, 2023, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops issued the following statement: This year, on June 16 — the day of the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus — a professional baseball team has shockingly chosen to honor a group whose lewdness and vulgarity in mocking our Lord, His Mother, and consecrated women cannot be overstated. This is not just offensive and painful to Christians everywhere; it is blasphemy. The bishops called on Catholics to pray the Litany of the Sacred Heart on June 16, offering this prayer &quot;... as an act of reparation for the blasphemies against our Lord we see in our culture today.&quot;

==Date==
The solemnity is celebrated on the second Friday following Trinity Sunday. The earliest possible date is May 29, as in 1818 and 2285. The latest possible date is July 2, as in 1943 and 2038. Therefore, it is the last feast date of the year dependent on the date of Easter.

In places where the Solemnity of the Most Holy Body and Blood of Christ is perpetually transferred from Thursday to Sunday (such as the United States and United Kingdom), it will appear on the local calendar as the Friday after the Solemnity of Corpus Christi.

<text>Ming Pao Daily News (), or Ming Pao for short, is a Chinese language newspaper in Canada owned by the Ming Pao Group of Hong Kong.

Ming Pao in Canada has two editions. The Eastern edition () published in Toronto, Ontario was launched in May 1993 by then Chairman P.H. Yu, and competed in the local Chinese community with &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot; and &quot;World Journal&quot;. The Toronto editorial offices are located in Agincourt. Shortly after in October 1993, the Western edition () was launched in Vancouver, British Columbia.

With the seizures of Sing Tao Daily and World Journal, Ming Pao is currently the only Chinese language newspaper that publishes daily.

The paper is published 7 days a week in broadsheet format. News coverage include Canadian news (including national, provincial, city and community pages), international news, Hong Kong news, mainland China and Taiwan news, plus lifestyle, entertainment, and sports sections.

==Magazines==

From 1993-2019, the Canada Eastern edition of &quot;Ming Pao&quot; publishes several weekly magazines. Unlike the situation in Hong Kong where the magazines are sold as separate publications, these are more properly called supplements that come free with the paper. The pages inside the magazines are also printed on newsprint instead of glossy paper.

Since 2019, in response to increased demands, &quot;Ming Pao&quot; gradually revamped its business model and all magazines are sold individually. Free copy of Ming Pao&#x27;s daily newspaper is offered as incentive with a subscription.

The magazines that come with the Canada Eastern edition are:
* Wednesday —&quot;Ming Pao Gourmet Supplement&quot; (樂在明廚), a tabloid-sized food magazine for everyone who loves cooking and eating.
* Thursday — &quot;Property Golden Pages&quot; (地產金頁), a tabloid-format publication resembling a small newspaper, containing mostly editorial content on the real estate market and home improvement with some property listings and other data.
* Friday — &quot;Healthy Living&quot; (健康生活), a tabloid-sized magazine that discusses trendy health and lifestyle issues.
* Saturday — &quot;Saturday Magazine&quot; (星期六周刊), a lifestyle-and-news magazine with substantial original local content
* Sunday — &quot;Ming Pao Weekly&quot; (明報加東周刊), a tabloid-sized entertainment magazine with content covering the latest gossips in Hong Kong and Canadian entertainment industry.
* Sunday — &quot;Zhōnghuá Tànsuǒ&quot; (中華探索, &quot;Exploring China&quot;), a magazine containing political criticism from Hong Kong&#x27;s &quot;Ming Pao Magazine&quot; and &quot;Yazhou Zhoukan&quot;

From time to time, special supplements are also published.

<doc id="1293719" wikidata="Q900549" url="?curid=1293719" title="Thermal de Broglie wavelength">
<text>In physics, the thermal de Broglie wavelength (formula_1, sometimes also denoted by formula_2) is a measure of the uncertainty in location of a particle of thermodynamic average momentum in an ideal gas. 
It is roughly the average de Broglie wavelength of particles in an ideal gas at the specified temperature. 

== Quantum-classical boundary ==
We can take the average interparticle spacing in the gas to be approximately where is the volume and is the number of particles. When the thermal de Broglie wavelength is much smaller than the interparticle distance, the gas can be considered to be a classical or Maxwell–Boltzmann gas. On the other hand, when the thermal de Broglie wavelength is on the order of or larger than the interparticle distance, quantum effects will dominate and the gas must be treated as a Fermi gas or a Bose gas, depending on the nature of the gas particles. The critical temperature is the transition point between these two regimes, and at this critical temperature, the thermal wavelength will be approximately equal to the interparticle distance. That is, the quantum nature of the gas will be evident for

formula_3

i.e., when the interparticle distance is less than the thermal de Broglie wavelength; in this case the gas will obey Bose–Einstein statistics or Fermi–Dirac statistics, whichever is appropriate. This is for example the case for electrons in a typical metal at &quot;T&quot; = 300 K, where the electron gas obeys Fermi–Dirac statistics, or in a Bose–Einstein condensate. On the other hand, for

formula_4

i.e., when the interparticle distance is much larger than the thermal de Broglie wavelength, the gas will obey Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics. Such is the case for molecular or atomic gases at room temperature, and for thermal neutrons produced by a neutron source.

==Massive particles==
For massive, non-interacting particles, the thermal de Broglie wavelength can be derived from the calculation of the partition function. Assuming a 1-dimensional box of length , the partition function (using the energy states of the 1D particle in a box) is
formula_5

Since the energy levels are extremely close together, we can approximate this sum as an integral:
formula_6

Hence,
formula_7
where formula_8 is the Planck constant, is the mass of a gas particle, formula_9 is the Boltzmann constant, and is the temperature of the gas.
This can also be expressed using the reduced Planck constant formula_10 as
formula_11

==Massless particles==

For massless (or highly relativistic) particles, the thermal wavelength is defined as
formula_12

where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light. As with the thermal wavelength for massive particles, this is of the order of the average wavelength of the particles in the gas and defines a critical point at which quantum effects begin to dominate. For example, when observing the long-wavelength spectrum of black body radiation, the classical Rayleigh–Jeans law can be applied, but when the observed wavelengths approach the thermal wavelength of the photons in the black body radiator, the quantum Planck&#x27;s law must be used.

==General definition==

A general definition of the thermal wavelength for an ideal gas of particles having an arbitrary power-law relationship between energy and momentum (dispersion relationship), in any number of dimensions, can be introduced. If is the number of dimensions, and the relationship between energy () and momentum () is given by
formula_13
(with and being constants), then the thermal wavelength is defined as
formula_14
where is the Gamma function. This definition retains the following simple form for the chemical potential in the dilute (classical ideal gas) limit:
:formula_15
for internal degeneracy (such as spin degeneracy for electrons), and also provides clean expressions for the thermodynamics of Fermi and Bose gases.

In particular, for a 3-D () gas of massive or massless particles we have and , respectively, yielding the expressions listed in the previous sections. Note that for massive non-relativistic particles (&quot;s&quot; = 2), the expression does not depend on &quot;n&quot;. This explains why the 1-D derivation above agrees with the 3-D case.

==Examples==
Some examples of the thermal de Broglie wavelength at 298 K are given below.

<text>William Hollingsworth &quot;Holly&quot; Whyte Jr. (July 11, 1917 – July 11, 1999) was an American urbanist, sociologist, organizational analyst, journalist and people-watcher. He identified the elements that create vibrant public spaces within the city and filmed a variety of urban plazas in New York City in the 1970s. After his book about corporate culture &quot;The Organization Man&quot; (1956) sold over two million copies, Whyte turned his attention to the study of human behavior in urban settings. He published several books and a film on the topic, including &quot;The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces&quot; (1980).

==Biography==
Whyte was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania in 1917. An early graduate of St. Andrew&#x27;s School in Middletown, Delaware, he graduated from Princeton University in 1939 and then served in Marine Corps between 1941 and 1944. He was commissioned and served as battalion intelligence officer with the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines in the Guadalcanal Campaign.
He left Guadalcanal at the end of the campaign with a serious case of malaria that lingered for years. He spent the rest of the war lecturing and writing at the Marine Corps Staff and Command School at Quantico, Virginia, on the fighting qualities of the Japanese soldier.

In 1946 he joined &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; where he remained until 1958.

In 1952, Whyte coined the term &quot;Groupthink&quot;:

Whyte wrote a 1956 bestseller titled &quot;The Organization Man&quot; after &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; sponsored him to do extensive interviews on the CEOs of corporations such as General Electric and Ford.

While working with the New York City Planning Commission in 1969, Whyte began to use direct observation to describe behavior in urban settings. With research assistants wielding still cameras, movie cameras, and notebooks, Whyte described the substance of urban public life in an objective and measurable way. These observations developed into the &quot;Street Life Project&quot;, an ongoing study of pedestrian behavior and city dynamics, and eventually to Whyte&#x27;s books such as &quot;The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces&quot; (1980) and &quot;&quot; (1988). &quot;City&quot; presents Whyte&#x27;s conclusions about jaywalking, &#x27;schmoozing patterns,&#x27; the actual use of urban plazas, appropriate sidewalk width, and other issues. This work remains valuable because it is based on careful observation, and because it contradicts other conventional wisdom, for instance, the idea that pedestrian traffic and auto traffic should be separated.

Whyte along with Project for Public Spaces worked closely on the renovation of Bryant Park in New York City.

Whyte served as mentor to many, including the urban-planning writer Jane Jacobs, Paco Underhill, who has applied the same technique to measuring and improving retail environments, Dan Biederman of Bryant Park Corporation, who led the renovation of Bryant Park and the Business Improvement District movement in New York City, Fred Kent, who worked with Whyte for a number of years before starting Project for Public Spaces, and future New York City Planning Commissioner, heiress and socialite Amanda Burden.

Whyte married fashion designer Jenny Bell Bechtel in 1964. They had one daughter, Alexandra Whyte.

He is interred at the Oaklands Cemetery in West Chester, Pennsylvania.

<text>Leonardo &quot;Flaco&quot; Jiménez (born March 11, 1939) is an American singer, songwriter and accordionist from San Antonio, Texas. He is known for playing Norteño, Tex Mex and Tejano music. Jiménez has been a solo performer and session musician, as well as a member of the Texas Tornados and Los Super Seven.

Over the course of his seven-decade career, he has received numerous awards and honors, including Lifetime Achievement Awards from the Grammys, Americana Music Awards, Tejano Music Awards, and &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine.

==Early life==
Jiménez, who is of Mexican descent, was born in San Antonio, Texas in 1939. He is descended from a line of musicians, including his father Santiago Jiménez Sr., and his grandfather Patricio Jiménez.

He began performing at the age of seven with his father, a pioneer of conjunto music, and began recording at age fifteen as a member of Los Caporales. Jiménez&#x27;s first instrument was the bajo sexto, but he later adopted the accordion after being influenced by his father and zydeco musician Clifton Chenier.

He was given the nickname &quot;Flaco&quot; (which translates as &quot;Skinny&quot; into English), which was also his father&#x27;s nickname.

== Career ==
Jiménez performed in the San Antonio area for several years and then began working with Doug Sahm in the 1960s. Sahm, better known as the founding member of the Sir Douglas Quintet, played with Jiménez for some time. Jiménez later went to New York City and worked with Dr. John, David Lindley, Peter Rowan, Ry Cooder and Bob Dylan. He appeared on Cooder&#x27;s world music album &quot;Chicken Skin Music&quot; and was a guest musician on the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Voodoo Lounge&quot; album. These appearances led to greater awareness of his music outside of America. After touring Europe with Cooder he returned to tour in America with his own band, and on a joint bill with Peter Rowan. Jiménez, Rowan and Wally Drogos were the original members of a band called the Free Mexican Airforce.

Jiménez appeared on the November 13, 1976 episode of &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; with Cooder.

In 1988, he performed on the hit country single &quot;Streets of Bakersfield&quot; by Dwight Yoakam and Buck Owens. The song reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles chart in 1988.

Jiménez won his first Grammy award in 1986 for his album &quot;Ay Te Dejo en San Antonio&quot;, whose title song was composed by his father. His third Grammy was for another song written by his father, &quot;Soy de San Luis&quot;, recorded by the Tejano fusion group Texas Tornados with Augie Meyers, Doug Sahm and Freddy Fender.

Starting in 1998, he was a member of Los Super Seven, a supergroup that won a Grammy Award for their eponymous album.

Jiménez was one of the featured artists in the 1976 documentary film &quot;Chulas Fronteras&quot;, directed by Les Blank. He also appeared as a band member in the 2000 movie &quot;Picking Up the Pieces&quot;, with Woody Allen and Sharon Stone, and was also featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. His music has been featured on the soundtrack for other movies, such as &quot;Y Tu Mamá También&quot;, &quot;El Infierno&quot;, &quot;The Border&quot;, &quot;Tin Cup&quot;, &quot;Chulas Fronteras&quot;, and &quot;Striptease&quot;.

He was one of the artists featured in archival footage in the 2013 documentary film &quot;This Ain&#x27;t No Mouse Music&quot; about Arhoolie Records and its founder Chris Strachwitz.

The Hohner company collaborated with Jiménez to create the Flaco Jimenez Signature series of accordions.

==Personal life==
His brother, Santiago Jiménez Jr., is also an accomplished accordionist and has recorded extensively.

In March 2015, Jiménez suffered a broken hip and two rib fractures from two separate falls. By May of that year, he returned to performing and was one of the acts on closing night of the 34th annual Tejano Conjunto Festival in San Antonio.

Jiménez and his wife once owned a food truck in the San Antonio area, named Tacos Jimenez.

<text>The Atlas Society (TAS) is an American 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes the philosophy of Ayn Rand. It is part of the Objectivist movement that split off from the Ayn Rand Institute in 1990 due to disagreements over whether Objectivism was a &quot;closed system&quot; or an &quot;open system&quot;. David Kelley is the founder of TAS, and Jennifer Grossman is its current CEO.

==History==
In the late 1980s, philosopher David Kelley was affiliated with the Ayn Rand Institute (ARI), which was founded 1985 to advocate Rand&#x27;s philosophy of Objectivism. After disputes with ARI founder Leonard Peikoff and board chairman Peter Schwartz, ARI cut ties with Kelley and warned others in the Objectivist movement not to associate with him. In response, Kelley and former ARI advisor George Walsh co-founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies in 1990; it was later renamed The Atlas Society. TAS positions itself as a more open and tolerant alternative to the &quot;orthodox&quot; ARI. ARI and TAS are the most prominent American organizations advocating for Objectivism, although TAS is smaller and not as well funded as its rival.

The organization&#x27;s activities have included creating written and recorded material about Objectivism, support for student groups, and media appearances. Each summer TAS organizes an annual conference called the &quot;Summer Seminar&quot;, and the group formerly published a magazine called &quot;The New Individualist&quot;. The Objectivist Oral History Project conducts recorded interviews with persons involved in the history of the Objectivist movement.

In 2011, Aaron Day took over as the organization&#x27;s operational executive. On March 1, 2016, TAS announced Jennifer Grossman as its new CEO.

The organization was founded as the Institute for Objectivist Studies in 1990. It was renamed The Objectivist Center in 1999. That same year, the Center founded &quot;The Atlas Society&quot; as an interest group targeted at people who read Rand&#x27;s novels but were not familiar with other Objectivist literature. On June 5, 2006, the organization announced its decision &quot;to use The Atlas Society as our official name, which will help us promote our ideas to Rand readers as well as to the general public, while reserving The Objectivist Center name for our more academic and scholarly activities.&quot;

<text>The Last Dance is an American dark wave band from Southern California that was for several years signed to the now-defunct Dancing Ferret Discs label. Formed in 1990, they have released five albums, an EP, a remix album, and a documentary film was made of them in 2007 titled &quot;Almost Beautiful&quot;. Along with former labelmates the Crüxshadows and Ego Likeness, the band remains one of the more popular groups associated with the third wave of the gothic rock movement.

==Biography==
Jeff Diehm (vocals), Rick Joyce (guitar), Tony Tullai (bass) and Ian Haas (drums) formed the Last Dance in the early 1990s in Los Angeles, California. As a small local band for several years, the Last Dance released two cassette albums, &quot;Everyone&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;; in 1995, they released an EP, &quot;Tragedy&quot;. By the mid-1990s, they had crafted several club favorites, including &quot;Fairytales&quot; and &quot;Do You Believe in Angels?&quot; &quot;Fairytales&quot; was the title track on their first full-length album, which released in 1996. This was followed by their first US tour in the summer of 1997.

Their next album, &quot;Perfect&quot;, was released 2001. By this point, Hauus had been replaced by Ivan &quot;Lucky&quot; Dominguez on drums. The band toured the US again and Europe for the first time with Switchblade Symphony.

In 2002, tragedy struck the Last Dance. Dominguez died of pneumonia on August 3, while the band was touring in Europe. The last show that he played with the band was on [July 31] in Leipzig, Germany; the last song that he played with the band was a cover of &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Party&quot; by Oingo Boingo (coincidentally, it was also the last song the band recorded for &quot;Whispers in Rage&quot;). The band played a memorial show for Dominguez 15 days later and replaced him with Tom Coyne, who had played with Rick Joyce in the Prophetess from 1993 to 1996. However, even as of 2005 the Last Dance lists Coyne as a &quot;performing drummer&quot;, a role also shared by Stevyn Grey (Christian Death, Faith and the Muse, Frankenstein). Ivan Dominguez is still listed prominently among their members as the band&#x27;s &quot;Friend and Brother&quot;. The last track of the Last Dance&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;Whispers in Rage&quot;, contains Dominguez&#x27;s drumming, and Dominguez&#x27;s death played somewhat into the writing of the album&#x27;s other songs.

Over their career, the Last Dance has toured the United States, Europe, and Latin America. Starting with their 1999 album, &quot;One Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine&quot;, they have released several albums that they only sold while on tour; these albums most frequently contain remixes of songs that appeared on their most recent full-length. Their most recent remix album, &quot;Reflections of Rage&quot; (2003), contained remixes of several songs from &quot;Whispers in Rage&quot; as well as songs dating from earlier in their career. Cyrusrex, collaborator of Skinny Puppy, Thomas Rainer of L&#x27;Âme Immortelle, and Rachel McDonnell of the Crüxshadows were among those who appeared on &quot;Reflections of Rage&quot;. Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of &quot;Reflections of Rage&quot; was that the Last Dance did a darkwave-tinged cover of Britney Spears&#x27; song &quot;Oops, I Did It Again&quot;.

The Last Dance released their next album, &quot;Once Beautiful&quot;, on September 20, 2005, on Dancing Ferret Discs. A music video for the song &quot;Once Beautiful&quot; was shot by Sandy Collora, the director of &quot;&quot;.

In September 2005, the band toured the U.S. for six weeks with a film crew in tow. A documentary on the tour was filmed by LifeLine Entertainment, produced by Roy Thomasson and directed by Rocky Costanzo. The documentary, titled &quot;Almost Beautiful&quot;, was released in 2007, and it was shown at several film festivals before it was released on DVD.

In 2007, the band did tour in favor of playing sporadic festivals around the US and Europe, including the Wave-Gotik-Treffen Festival in Germany and Dragon*Con in Atlanta on September 28, 2006. The Last Dance got a sponsor deal from the Bleeding Edge gothic line of merchandise.

As of 2015, after a nearly decade-long hiatus, the band released the album &quot;Ruins&quot;. Their single &quot;Cages&quot; makes appearances on several compilation albums.

<doc id="1293780" wikidata="Q96894257" url="?curid=1293780" title="Fomitopsis betulina">
<text>Fomitopsis betulina (previously Piptoporus betulinus), commonly known as the birch polypore, birch bracket, or razor strop, is a common bracket fungus and, as the name suggests, grows almost exclusively on birch trees. The brackets burst out from the bark of the tree, and these fruit bodies can last for more than a year.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was originally described by Jean Bulliard in 1788 as &quot;Boletus betulinus&quot;. It was transferred to the genus &quot;Piptoporus&quot; by Petter Karsten in 1881. Molecular phylogenetic studies suggested that the species was more closely related to &quot;Fomitopsis&quot; than to &quot;Piptoporus&quot;, and the fungus was reclassified to &quot;Fomitopsis&quot; in 2016.

The specific epithet &quot;betulina&quot; refers to the genus of the host plant (&quot;Betula&quot;). Common names for the fungus include birch bracket, birch polypore, and razorstrop fungus.

==Description==
The fruit bodies (basidiocarps) are pale, with a smooth greyish-brown top surface, while the creamy white underside has hundreds of pores that contain the spores. The fruit body has a rubbery texture, becoming corky with age. Wood decayed by the fungus, and cultures of its mycelium, often smell distinctly of green apples. The spores are cylindrical to ellipsoidal in shape, and measure 3–6 by 1.5–2 μm.

&quot;Fomitopsis betulina&quot; has a bipolar mating system where monokaryons or germinating spores can only mate and form a fertile dikaryon with an individual that possesses a different mating-type factor. There are at least 33 different mating-type factors within the British population of this fungus. These factors are all variants or alleles of a single gene, as opposed to the tetrapolar mating system of some other basidiomycete species, which involves two genes.

==Distribution, habitat and ecology==

&quot;Fomitopsis betulina&quot; is one of the most common species of brown rot fungi. The geographic distribution of &quot;F. betulina&quot; appears to be restricted to the Northern Hemisphere, including Northern America, Europe, and Asia. It is only found on birch trees, including &quot;Betula pendula&quot;, &quot;B. pubescens&quot;, &quot;B. papyrifera&quot;, and &quot;B. obscura&quot;. There is some doubt about the ability of isolates from the European continent, North America and the British Isles to interbreed.

It is a necrotrophic parasite on weakened birches, and will cause brown rot and eventually death, being one of the most common fungi visible on dead birches. It is likely that the birch bracket fungus becomes established in small wounds and broken branches and may lie dormant for years, compartmentalised into a small area by the tree&#x27;s own defence mechanisms, until something occurs to weaken the tree. Fire, drought and suppression by other trees are common causes of such stress.

In most infections there is only one fungal individual present, but occasionally several individuals may be isolated from a single tree, and in these cases it is possible that the birch bracket fungus entered after something else killed the tree. These fungal &quot;individuals&quot; can sometimes be seen if a slice of brown-rotted birch wood is incubated in a plastic bag for several days. This allows the white mycelium of the fungus to grow out of the surface of the wood. If more than one individual dikaryon is present, lines of intraspecific antagonism form as the two individual mycelia interact and repel each other.

The fungus can harbor a large number of species of insects that depend on it for food and as breeding sites. In a large-scale study of over 2600 fruit bodies collected in eastern Canada, 257 species of arthropods, including 172 insects and 59 mites, were found. The fungus is eaten by the caterpillars of the fungus moth &quot;Nemaxera betulinella&quot;. Old fruit bodies that have survived the winter are often colonized by the white to pale yellow fungus &quot;Hypocrea pulmonata&quot;.

==Research on chemical constituents ==
&quot;Fomitopsis betulina&quot; has been widely used in traditional medicines, and has been extensively researched for its phytochemistry and pharmacological activity. Phytochemicals include phenolic acids, indole compounds, sterols, and triterpenes, especially betulin and betulinic acid.

Agaric acid, found in the fruit body of the fungus, is poisonous to the parasitic whipworm &quot;Trichuris trichiura&quot;. The fungus was carried by &quot;Ötzi the Iceman&quot; – the 5,300 year old mummy found in Tyrol, with speculation that the fungus may have been used as a laxative to expel whipworm.

==Uses==
The velvety cut surface of the fruit body was traditionally used as a strop for finishing the edges on razors, and as a mounting material for insect collections. It has also been used as tinder and anesthetic.

It is considered inedible.

<doc id="1293781" wikidata="Q2142266" url="?curid=1293781" title="Razor strop">
<text>A razor strop or simply a strop (sometimes called a razor strap or strap) is a flexible strip of leather, canvas, denim fabric, balsa wood, or other soft material, used to straighten and polish the blade of a straight razor, a knife, or a woodworking tool such as a chisel. In many cases stropping re-aligns parts of the blade edge that have been bent out of alignment. In other cases, especially when abrasive polishing compound is used, stropping may remove a small amount of metal (functionally equivalent to lapping). Stropping can also burnish (i.e., push metal around on) the blade. 

The strop may be a hanging strop or a hand-held paddle. Various abrasive compounds may be applied to the strop to aid in polishing the blade while stropping to obtain a mirror-like finish. Common abrasive compounds include half-micron diamonds, green chromium(III) oxide, white rouge (aluminum oxide), and jeweller&#x27;s rouge (iron(III) oxide).

== Use ==
Stropping is traditionally associated with straight razors used for shaving, as these are the thinnest blades in everyday use, and therefore require frequent stropping. Kitchen knives may be straightened on a honing steel if less sharpness is acceptable. In principle, any blade may be polished by stropping. Custom strops are made to hone irregularly-shaped tools, such as chisels or gouges, and nearly any piece of smooth leather or heavy fabric infused with abrasive compound may be used for stropping.

<text>The Feast of the Holy Cross, or Feast of the Cross, commemorates the cross used in the crucifixion of Jesus. In the Christian liturgical calendar, there are several different celebrations which honor and celebrate the cross used in the crucifixion. Unlike Good Friday, which is dedicated to the passion of Christ and the crucifixion, these feast days celebrate the Cross itself, as the sign of salvation. It is chiefly celebrated by Roman Catholics (Latin Church Catholics, Eastern Catholics), Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Old Catholics, Lutherans and Anglicans, and to a lesser extent by Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists. The most common day of commemoration is September 14 for churches that use the Gregorian calendar and September 27 for churches that use the Julian calendar, Ge&#x27;ez calendar, or Coptic calendar.

In English, the feast is called The Exaltation of the Holy Cross in the official translation of the Roman Missal, while the 1973 translation called it The Triumph of the Cross. In some parts of the Anglican Communion the feast is called Holy Cross Day, a name also used by Lutherans. The celebration is also sometimes called Holy Rood Day, or by the historical names Roodmas or Crouchmas.

==History==
The Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, celebrated every year on 14 September, recalls three events:
# The finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena.
# The dedication of churches built by Emperor Constantine on the site of the Holy Sepulchre and Mount Calvary.
# The elevation of the True Cross at Hagia Sophia in Constantinople in AD 629 by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, after it had fallen into the hands of the Persian Emperor Chosroes II in the AD 614 Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem.
Under Emperor Constantine, around AD 327, Bishop Macarius of Jerusalem caused excavations to be made in order to ascertain the location of Calvary as well as that of the Holy Sepulchre. It was in the course of these excavations that the wood of the cross was recovered. It was determined by Macarius to be authentic (the crosses of the two thieves were also recovered) and for it Constantine built the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre. Subsequently, pieces of the True Cross relic were distributed across the empire and by the turn of the 5th century were venerated as far away as Italy.

The Ancient Georgian Iadgari (Chantbook) bears witness to the celebration of the Exaltation of the Cross in Jerusalem prior to the middle of the 6th century. In the west before the end of the seventh century the feast was mainly observed in Rome. However, the earliest recorded commemoration of 14 September as the feast day on a Western calendar is from the 7th century A.D.

In the Gallican usage, beginning about the seventh century, the &quot;Feast of the Cross&quot; was celebrated on 3 May, and called &quot;Crouchmas&quot; (for &quot;Cross Mass&quot; or &quot;Mass Of The Cross&quot;) or &quot;Roodmas&quot;. When the Gallican and Roman practices were combined, the September date was assigned to commemorating the rescue of the cross from the Sassanid Persians, and the May date was kept as the Finding of the Holy Cross or Invention of the True Cross to commemorate the finding. (&quot;Invention&quot; is a rendering of the Latin term &quot;inventio&quot; meaning &quot;discovery&quot;.) Pope John XXIII removed this feast in 1960, so that the General Roman Calendar now celebrates both the finding and the exaltation of the Holy Cross on 14 September, although some Latin American countries and Mexico still celebrate the feast of the finding on 3 May. Some communities which celebrate the liturgy in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite also observe the feast of the finding of the Holy Cross on 3 May.

===Theological distinction===
The Second Council of Nicæa of 787, drew the distinction between veneration of the cross and worship or &quot;latria&quot;, &quot;which, according to the teaching of the faith, belongs to the Divine nature alone.&quot; Petavius noted that this cult must be considered as not belonging to the substance of religion, but as being one of the things not absolutely necessary to salvation. Thus, the honor paid to the image passes to the prototype; and he who adores the image, adores the person whom it represents.

==Traditions==
According to Christian tradition, the True Cross was discovered in 326 by Saint Helena, the mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, during a pilgrimage she made to Jerusalem. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was then built at the site of the discovery, by order of Helena and Constantine. The church was dedicated nine years later, with a portion of the cross. One-third remained in Jerusalem, one-third was brought to Rome and deposited in the Sessorian basilica Santa Croce in Gerusalemme (Holy Cross in Jerusalem), and one-third was taken to Constantinople to make the city impregnable.

The date of the feast marks the dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in 335. This was a two-day festival: although the actual consecration of the church was on 13 September, the cross itself was brought outside the church on 14 September so that the clergy and faithful could pray before the True Cross, and all could come forward to venerate it.

Historically in Western Christianity, the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday of the calendar week after the one in which the feast day occurs are designated as one of each year&#x27;s four sets of Ember days. Until 1969, these ember days were a part of the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church. Organization of these celebrations in the ordinary form is now left to the decision of episcopal conferences in view of local conditions and customs. The ember days are still observed in the calendar of the Roman Rite&#x27;s Extraordinary Form, the Anglican Ordinariate, and Western Orthodoxy.

===Liturgical colours===
Red is the usual liturgical color in churches that follow such traditions.

In Western Christianity, red vestments are worn at church services conducted on this day. 

The lectionaries of the Church of England (and other Anglican churches) and Western Rite Orthodoxy also stipulate red as the liturgical color for &#x27;Holy Cross Day.&#x27;

In Eastern Orthodox Churches that use various liturgical colors, red vestments are also worn. Yet in these Orthodox churches, the wearing of red continues for a week after the feast.

===Religious orders===
The Carmelite Rule of St. Albert of 1247 gives this date as the beginning of the period of fasting, which ends on Easter Sunday.

This date is the titular feast of the Congregation of Holy Cross, The Companions of the Cross and the Episcopal Church&#x27;s Order of the Holy Cross.

==Observation in various Churches==
===Church of England===

The &quot;Common Worship&quot; calendar (2000), like the General Roman Calendar, celebrates the Feast on 14 September.

===Church of the East===

The Church of the East celebrates the finding of the Cross on 13 September, and considers it to be a major feast. The Assyrian Church considers the Sign of the Cross to be the sacrament by which all of the other sacraments are sealed and perfected. (The Church&#x27;s traditional list of sacraments does not include marriage.) Saranaya (Syriac) hold a &quot;shara&quot; every year in cities like Chicago, Illinois, and Modesto, California, and other parts of the world. The &quot;shara&quot; in Modesto is held every Sunday prior to 13 September at East La Loma Park, where they in remembrance of the Feast Of the Cross. People gather to feast, sing and dance to celebrate the joyous event.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===

In Byzantine liturgical observance, the Universal Exaltation (also called Elevation in Eastern Orthodox tradition) of the Precious and Life-creating Cross commemorates both the finding of the True Cross in the year 326 and its recovery from the Persians in the year 628, and is one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the church year. 14 September is always a fast day and the eating of meat, dairy products and fish is prohibited. The Feast of the Exaltation has a one-day forefeast and an eight-day afterfeast. The Saturday and Sunday before and after 14 September are also commemorated with special Epistle and Gospel readings about the Cross at the Divine Liturgy.

On the eve of the feast before small vespers the priest, having prepared a tray with the cross placed on a bed of fresh basil leaves or flowers, covered with an aër (liturgical veil), places it on the table of prothesis; after that service, the priest carries the tray on his head preceded by lighted candles and the deacon incensing the cross, processes to the holy table (altar), in the centre whereof he lays the tray, in the place of the Gospel Book, the latter being set upright at the back of the altar. Those portions of the vespers and matins which in sundry local customs take place before the Icon of the Feast (e.g., the chanting of the Polyeleos and the Matins Gospel) instead take place in front of the Holy Table. The bringing out of the cross and the exaltation ceremony occur at matins.

The cross remains in the centre of the temple throughout the afterfeast, and the faithful venerate it whenever they enter or leave the church. Finally, on the leave-taking (&quot;apodosis&quot;) of the feast, the priest and deacon will incense around the cross, there will be a final veneration of the cross, and then they will solemnly bring the cross back into the sanctuary through the Holy Doors. This same pattern of bringing out the cross, veneration, and returning the cross at the end of the celebration is repeated at a number of the lesser times.

===Oriental Orthodoxy===
====Armenian Apostolic Church and other Armenian Christians ====
The Armenian Apostolic Church observes a five-day fast, called the Fast of the Holy Cross, from September 10 through 14 September, in preparation for the Feast of the Holy Church in view of the Holy Cross, which they celebrate on September 15. September 16 is observed as the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (&quot;Khachverats&quot; in Armenian), a feast which continues for several days thereafter. It is counted as one of the five major feasts of the Armenian Church, and the most important of the four feasts of the Holy Cross. According to Armenian tradition, the first one to &quot;exalt&quot; the Cross was the Apostle James of Jerusalem, the &quot;Brother of the Lord&quot;. On the Sunday nearest 14 September, the liturgy is marked with an &quot;antasdan&quot; service (blessing of the fields) during which the processional cross is adorned with basil (a symbol of royalty) and the four corners of the church are blessed as a sign of the sanctification of the world.

On the Sunday nearest September 28 (always two weeks after the Exaltation) the Armenian Apostolic Church and Armenian Catholic Church celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross of Varak (&quot;Varaka Khach&quot;) commemorating the third century placement of an authentic relic of the cross in Armenian soil at Varagavank. This is a cross feast unique to the Armenian Church.

On the Sunday closest to October 26, the Armenian Church celebrates the Discovery of the Holy Cross (&quot;Kyood Khach&quot;), commemorating the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena (327 AD).

====Coptic Orthodox Church and other Coptic Christians====
The Coptic Orthodox Church and the Coptic Catholic Church annually commemorates two events related to the Cross. The first Feast of the Cross commemorates the Consecration of the Church of the Resurrection on 17 Thout according to the Coptic calendar. This corresponds to 14 September on the Julian Calendar (or, in years following a Coptic leap year, one day later) which will correspond to 27 September on the Gregorian Calendar until AD 2099. The second Feast of the Cross commemorates the Appearance of the Holy Cross on 10 Paremhat according to the Coptic calendar. This corresponds to 19 March on the Gregorian Calendar until AD 2099.

====Orthodox Tewahedo Churches and other Ethiopian-Eritrean Christians====

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and to a lesser extent Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelical Protestants, the Ethiopian Catholic Church, and the Eritrean Catholic Church, commemorate the finding of the true cross on Mäskäräm 17 of the Ethiopian Calendar. This is the same date as observed by the Coptic Orthodox Church. The eve of this day is popularly called &quot;Demera&quot; (meaning &quot;Bonfire&quot;) in Amharic.

The Ethiopian Patriarch lights a large bonfire in Meskel Square, Addis Ababa&#x27;s greatest open arena, and smaller bonfires are lit by individuals and local parishes throughout the country. Thousands attend the colourful and vibrant ceremony of religious chantings around the bonfire in Meskel Square, which owes its name to the ceremony, for &quot;meskel&quot; means &quot;cross&quot; in Ge&#x27;ez. According to tradition, the bonfire commemorates how the Empress Helena used the smoke of a bonfire to determine where to search for the true cross in Jerusalem, or how, by a series of bonfires, she signalled to her son Constantine in Constantinople her success in finding it.

====Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church====
In the Malankara Syrian Orthodox Church a special offering called &quot;panchasarayumanda&quot; is made on this day, in particular at the Akaparambu Mor Sabor-Mor Aphroth Church in the Ernakulam District, Kerala.

===Roman Catholic Church===
In the liturgy of the Roman Catholic church, the readings in the Holy Mass for the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross draw a comparison between the bronze serpent of Numbers 21, which was raised up on a pole so that all who looked upon it would be cured of the deadly poison of venomous snakes, and John 3:14–15, &quot;And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.&quot; If the feast falls on a Sunday, its Mass readings are used instead of those for the occurring Sunday in Ordinary Time.

==Related observances==

===6 March ===

On 6 March, the liturgical calendar of the Eastern Orthodox Church, commemorates the Uncovering of the Precious Cross and the Precious Nails by Empress Saint Helen—that is to say, the anniversary of the actual discovery; the date for the feast on 14 September was determined by the consecration of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This is a lesser feast, and does not have any of the liturgical peculiarities of the feast of 14 September.

=== 3 May ===
The General Roman Calendar before 1960 contained the Feast of the Finding of the Holy Cross (Roodmas) on 3 May. It commemorated the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena, the mother of the emperor Constantine. With the reorganisation of the liturgical calendar by his Motu proprio &quot;Rubricarum instructum&quot; of Pope John XXIII (1960), the Feast of the Finding of the Cross was celebrated only in some regions. Meanwhile, the finding of the True cross is also commemorated at the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross on 14 September.

===1 August===

The Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholics also commemorate the Procession of the Precious Wood of the Life-giving Cross of Jesus Christ on 1 August, which is also the first day of the Dormition Fast. The propers of the feast are combined with those of the Holy Maccabean Martyrs, the commemoration of whose endurance is deemed appropriate for the first day of a fast. Unlike the observance on 14 September, this commemoration is considered to be a minor feast, but it does have the bringing out of the cross and veneration by the faithful like the September feast.

The history of this feast begins in Constantinople where it was the custom to carry the relic of the True Cross through the streets and squares of the city to ask for God&#x27;s blessing and for relief from sickness. On the eve of the feast (31 July), observed as a forefeast, it was taken out of the imperial treasury, and laid upon the altar of the &quot;Great Church&quot; (Hagia Sophia) and the following day solemnly placed in the middle of the Great Church for the faithful to venerate. It was taken in procession daily throughout the city, offering it to the people to venerate, until the Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos (15 August), when it was returned to the imperial treasury.

In commemoration of this tradition, it is customary to have an outdoor procession with the &quot;Lesser Blessing of Water&quot; on August 1. It is the first of three &quot;Feasts of the Saviour&quot; in the month of August, the other two being the Transfiguration (6 August) and the Icon of Christ &quot;Not Made by Hands&quot; (16 August). Because of the blessing of holy water, this feast is sometimes called &quot;Saviour of the Water.&quot; There may also be celebrated on this day the &quot;Rite of Blessing New Honey&quot;, for which reason the day is also referred to as &quot;Saviour of the Honey.&quot;

According to Saint Nikolaj Velimirović, this feast was instituted by mutual agreement of the Greeks and Russians to commemorate the simultaneous victories of the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos over the Bulgarians and the Russian Prince Andrei Bogolyubsky over the Saracens in the 12th century.

In the Russian Orthodox Church, this feast also celebrates the Baptism of Rus, which occurred on 1 August 988.

===12 October ===
In the Russian Orthodox Church, 12 October is the commemoration of the Translation of a Portion of the Life-Giving Cross from Malta to Gatchina.
A portion of the Life-Giving Cross of the Lord, as well as the &quot;Philermos&quot; icon of the Mother of God and the right hand of John the Baptist were preserved on the island of Malta by the Knights of the Catholic Order of St. John of Jerusalem, who controlled the island.

In 1798, when the French seized the island, the Maltese Knights turned to the Russian Empire for defense and protection. To this end, they elected Paul I, the Tsar of Russia, as Grand Master of the Order. The Tsar accepted his election. On 12 October 1799, Maltese knights came to their new Priory Palace, just built for them by Paul in Gatchina (45 km [27 miles] south of St.  Petersburg), and offered these ancient and holy treasures to their new Grand Master, the tsar.

In the autumn of 1799 the holy items were transferred to St. Petersburg and placed in the Winter Palace within the internal church dedicated to the Icon of the Savior Not-Made-by-Hands. The feast for this event was established in 1800.

===Moveable feasts===
In addition to celebrations on fixed days, the Cross may be celebrated during the variable, particularly in Lent and Eastertide.

Eastern Christians celebrate an additional Veneration of the Cross on the third Sunday of Great Lent. The services for this day are modeled on the Feast of the Exaltation (14 September), and include bringing the cross to the holy table at little vespers and with solemnity out into the center of church at matins, albeit without the ceremony of the Exaltation of the Cross, for veneration by the faithful. It remains in the centre of the church for nearly a week (the Fourth Week of Great Lent). On the Monday and Wednesday of that week, a veneration of the Cross takes place at the First Hour (repeating a portion of the service from matins of the previous Sunday). On Friday of that week, the veneration takes place after the Ninth Hour, after which the priest and deacons return the cross to the sanctuary.

In addition to all of the above commemorations, Orthodox also hold Wednesday and Friday throughout the year as a commemoration of the Cross.

In the Roman Breviary before the 1961 reform, a Commemoration of the Cross is made during Eastertide except when the office or commemoration of a double or octave occurs, replacing the suffrage of the Saints said outside Eastertide.

Orthodox Churches, the Roman Catholic Church, and some Anglican churches have a formal Adoration of the Cross during the services on Good Friday.

==Veneration of the Cross==
===Feast days===
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, on several of the feast days mentioned above, there is a public veneration of the cross. It may take place at matins, after the cross is brought out, at the end of the celebration of the Divine Liturgy, or at the end of one of the Little Hours, depending upon the particular feast and local custom.

The faithful come forward and make two prostrations, make the sign of the cross on themselves, and kiss the feet of Christ on the cross, and then make a third prostration. After this, they will often receive a blessing from the priest and bow towards their fellow worshippers on each side of the church (this latter practice is most commonly observed in monasteries).

===At the end of services===
At the end of the Divine Liturgy, and at some other services as well, it is customary for the faithful to come forward and venerate the &quot;Blessing Cross&quot; (hand-cross) which is held by the bishop or priest, and to kiss his hand. This practice is also called the &quot;Veneration of the Cross&quot;, though it does not involve making prostrations. The cross which is venerated is small (typically 10–16 inches). This cross is usually metal, often gold or gold-plated, and can be enameled or decorated with jewels. The figure of Jesus on the Cross (the &quot;soma&quot;) is usually engraved, enameled, or painted on the cross, rather than being a separate three-dimensional figure as is found on a crucifix.

<doc id="1293847" wikidata="Q6369797" url="?curid=1293847" title="Karen Kwiatkowski">
<text>Karen U. Kwiatkowski, née Unger, (born September 24, 1960) is an American activist and commentator. She is a retired U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel whose assignments included duties as a Pentagon desk officer and a variety of roles for the National Security Agency. 

Since retiring, she has become a noted critic of the U.S. government&#x27;s involvement in Iraq. Kwiatkowski is primarily known for her insider essays which denounce a corrupting political influence on the course of military intelligence leading up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In 2012, she challenged incumbent Bob Goodlatte, in the Republican primary for Virginia&#x27;s 6th congressional district seat in the United States House of Representatives and garnered 34% of the Republican vote on a constitutional and limited government platform. As of 2024, she is a member of Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity.

While in the Air Force, she wrote two books about U.S. policy towards Africa: &quot;African Crisis Response Initiative: Past Present and Future&quot; (US Army Peacekeeping Institute, 2000) and &quot;Expeditionary Air Operations in Africa: Challenges and Solutions&quot; (Air University Press, 2001). She contributed to &quot;Ron Paul: A Life of Ideas&quot;, (Variant Press, 2008) and &quot;Why Liberty: Personal Journeys Toward Peace and Freedom&quot;, (Cobden Press, 2010). She has been featured in a number of documentaries, including &quot;Why We Fight&quot; in 2005. She has written for LewRockwell.com since 2003.

==Early life==

Born Karen Unger, Kwiatkowski was raised in western North Carolina. She received an master&#x27;s in government from Harvard University and an MS in Science Management from the University of Alaska. She has a PhD in World Politics from The Catholic University of America; her thesis was on the overt and covert war in Angola, &quot;A Case Study of the Implementation of the Reagan Doctrine&quot;.

==Career==

===Military===
Kwiatkowski began her military career in 1982 as a Second Lieutenant. She served at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, providing logistical support to missions along the Chinese and Russian coasts. She also served in Spain and Italy. Kwiatkowski was then assigned to the National Security Agency (NSA), eventually becoming a speechwriter for the agency&#x27;s director. After leaving the NSA in 1998 she became an analyst on sub-Saharan Africa policy for the Pentagon. Kwiatkowski was in her office in the Pentagon when it was attacked on September 11, 2001. From May 2002 to February 2003 she served in the Pentagon&#x27;s Near East and South Asia directorate (NESA). While at NESA, she wrote a series of anonymous articles, &quot;Insider Notes from the Pentagon&quot; which appeared on the website of David Hackworth. Kwiatkowski left NESA in February 2003 and retired from the Air Force the following month.

===Writer and commentator===
In April 2003 Kwiatkowski began writing a series of articles for the libertarian website LewRockwell.com. Since February 2004 she has written a biweekly column (&quot;Without Reservations&quot;) for the website MilitaryWeek.com.

She is currently a Senior Fellow at the Eisenhower Media Network, a nonprofit group of former military, intelligence and civilian national security officials who described themselves as offering &quot;alternative analyses untainted by Pentagon or defense industry ties&quot; and countering &quot;Washington’s establishment narrative on most national security issues of the day.&quot;

She has been critical of neoconservatism and has advocated for a non-interventionist foreign policy. Her writings on the subject of a corrupting influence of the Pentagon on intelligence analysis leading up to the Iraq War appeared in a series of articles in &quot;The American Conservative&quot; magazine in December 2003 and in a March 2004 article on Salon.com. In the latter piece (&quot;The New Pentagon Papers&quot;) she wrote:
Kwiatkowski described how a clique of officers led by retired Navy Captain Bill Luti, assistant secretary of defense for NESA and former aide to Dick Cheney when the latter was Secretary of Defense, took control of military intelligence and how the &quot;Office of Special Plans&quot; (OSP) grew and eventually turned into a censorship and disinformation organism controlling the NESA.

Following the &quot;American Conservative&quot; and &quot;Salon&quot; articles, Kwiatkowski began to receive criticism from several conservative sources that supported President Bush&#x27;s policies. Michael Rubin of the &quot;National Review&quot; argued she had exaggerated her knowledge of the OSP&#x27;s workings and claimed she had ties to Lyndon LaRouche. Republican U.S. Senator Jon Kyl criticized her in a speech on the Senate floor. On a Fox News program, host John Gibson and former Republican National Committee communications director Clifford May described her as an anarchist. Kwiatkowski responded by saying, among other points, that she had never supported or dealt with LaRouche. 

In addition to her writings Kwiatkowski has appeared as a commentator in the documentaries &quot;Hijacking Catastrophe&quot;, &quot;Honor Betrayed&quot;, &quot;Why We Fight&quot; and &quot;Superpower&quot;.

==Politics==
Kwiatkowski was raised as a Goldwater Republican, and registered Republican from 1981 until 1994. She joined the U.S. Libertarian Party in 1994 and continued that membership until 2011. She was a speaker on military and foreign policy at the party&#x27;s national convention in 2004. She returned to the Republican Party in 2011, and entered politics with the hope of joining Ron Paul, Justin Amash and others in the House Republican Liberty Caucus. She is endorsed by a past Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, as well as by a range of other fiscal and constitutional conservatives.

A number of Libertarian Party members and supporters have encouraged Kwiatkowski to seek the Party&#x27;s presidential nomination in the past few election cycles. She has thus far declined to do so. On April 15, 2007, Kwiatkowski received the New Hampshire Libertarian Party&#x27;s 2008 vice-presidential nomination, within a couple of weeks she declined the nomination. In 2007, she announced her support for Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul.

===2012 U.S. House of Representatives candidacy===

In February 2011, a Federal Election Commission filing declared the Friends of Karen Kwiatkowski were drafting her to run for the Virginia&#x27;s 6th district U.S. congressional seat in the 2012 election.

On August 18, 2011, Kwiatkowski formally announced her candidacy for the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte in the June 12, 2012, primary election. She wrote a variety of opinion pieces geared directly to her 2012 House race, and was interviewed by both local and national media. Her campaign slogan was &quot;Less Government, More Prosperity&quot;.

On June 12, 2012, Kwiatkowski lost the nomination bid to Goodlatte who won 66.48% of the vote in the Republican 6th district primary election.

==Personal life==
Kwiatkowski lives with her family in Mount Jackson in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia and is a farmer and part-time professor. She is married to Hap Kwiatkowski and has four children and seven grandchildren. She is a Christian.

==Founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity==

Kwiatkowski is a founding member of the Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity.

In September 2015 Kwiatkowski and 27 other members of VIPS steering group wrote a letter to the President challenging a recently published book, that claimed to rebut the report of the United States Senate Intelligence Committee on the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s use of torture.

<text>Henry Vernon Esmond (30 November 1869 – 17 April 1922) was a British actor and playwright.

==Biography==
Esmond was born Harry Esmond Jack in Hampton Court, Middlesex, the son of Richard George Jack, a physician and surgeon and his wife Mary Rynd. He was baptised on 22 February 1870 at the Church of St Mary, Hampton Court, Middlesex. He began his career as an actor in London in 1889 where he had several successes in comedies. He began writing plays, usually comedies, while in his early twenties. These plays were very popular and were also highly fashionable with their themes of light-hearted romance appealing to the audience of the day. He toured with a number of these plays and co-starred in them with his wife, Eva Moore.

His plays were also well received in the United States where nine of them were produced on Broadway between 1899 and 1907. For the next Broadway production, &quot;Eliza Comes to Stay&quot;, Esmond travelled to New York to appear alongside his wife and the popular actor Leslie Banks. This proved to be the greatest success of his career. He continued writing, acting and touring until his sudden death in Paris caused by pneumonia.

<text>Rakesh Roshan (born 6 September 1949) is an Indian film producer, director, screenwriter and actor who works in Hindi films. He had appeared in 84 films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. As an actor, he was mostly known for his supporting roles in big-budget films. Later, his prominence increased, and he achieved fame for directing films with titles beginning with the letter &quot;K&quot; since 1987.

As a filmmaker, his work includes the action drama (1987), the revenge drama thriller &quot;Khoon Bhari Maang&quot; (1988), the action comedy &quot;Kishen Kanhaiya&quot; (1990), the melodramatic thriller &quot;Karan Arjun&quot; (1995), the musical romantic thriller &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000), the science fiction film &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot; (2003) and its sequels, the superhero &quot;Krrish&quot; film series (2006–13). All of the films he has directed have been commercially successful. He also won the Filmfare Award for Best Film and Best Director for &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; and &quot;Koi... Mil Gaya&quot;.

==Early life==
Rakesh was born on 6 September 1949 to Indian Punjabi music director Roshan and Indian Bengali singer Ira Roshan. His younger brother is Rajesh Roshan.

==Career==
===1970–1986===
After his father&#x27;s untimely death, Rakesh started his career as an assistant director to filmmaker Mohan Kumar in films like &quot;Anjaana&quot; starring Rajendra Kumar and Babita. Rajendra Kumar referred him to some filmmakers and thus he was signed by Soodesh Kumar for &quot;Man Mandir&quot; starring Sanjeev Kumar and Waheeda Rehman. As an actor, he made his debut in the 1970 film &quot;Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani&quot;, in which he got a supporting role. 

Rakesh got very few solo hero films in his career. He got such roles in more women-oriented films, such as &quot;Paraya Dhan&quot; with Hema Malini, &quot;Aankh Micholi&quot; with Bharati, &quot;Khubsoorat&quot; with Rekha and &quot;Kaamchor&quot; with Jaya Prada. His few successful solo hero films, with the focus equally on both hero and heroine, were &quot;Aankhon Aankhon Mein&quot; with Rakhee, &quot;Nafrat&quot; with Yogita Bali, &quot;Ek Kunwari Ek Kunwara&quot; with Leena Chandavarkar, &quot;Hamari Bahu Alka&quot; with Bindiya Goswami and &quot;Shubh Kaamna&quot; with Rati Agnihotri. J. Om Prakash produced &quot;Aankhon Aankhon Mein&quot; with Rakesh in the lead. Later, J. Om Prakash directed &quot;Aakraman&quot;, with Sanjeev Kumar in the lead, and had Rakesh in a supporting role, and then produced &quot;Aakhir Kyun?&quot;, with Rajesh Khanna in the lead and Rakesh in a supporting role. 

Rakesh played supporting roles in a few successful films such as &quot;Man Mandir&quot; with Sanjeev Kumar in the lead, &quot;Khel Khel Mein&quot; with Rishi Kapoor in the lead, &quot;Bullet&quot; with Dev Anand as the hero, &quot;Hatyara&quot; with Vinod Khanna in the lead, &quot;Dhongee&quot; with Randhir Kapoor, &quot;Khandaan&quot; with Jeetendra and &quot;Neeyat&quot; with Shashi Kapoor as the lead hero. He played supporting roles regularly in films with Rajesh Khanna in the lead role and of those, &quot;Chalta Purza&quot; was a failure and the other three were blockbusters - &quot;Dhanwan&quot;, &quot;Awaaz&quot; and &quot;Aakhir Kyon?&quot;. The few multi-star cast films he was part of as the lead hero that were successful between 1977 and 1986 were &quot;Devata&quot;, &quot;Shriman Shrimati&quot; and &quot;Haathkadi&quot;, all of which had Sanjeev Kumar as the main lead hero and &quot;Jaag Utha Insan&quot; and &quot;Ek Aur Sikander&quot;, which had Mithun Chakraborty in the main lead, and other hits such as &quot;Dil Aur Deewaar&quot;, &quot;Khatta Meetha&quot;, &quot;Unees-Bees&quot; (1980) and &quot;Maqaar&quot; (1986). Most of his other films as a second lead hero or solo hero films between 1973 and 1990 were box office flops.

Rakesh set up his own production company, Filmkraft, in 1980 and their first production was &quot;Aap Ke Deewane&quot; (1980), which was a box office flop. His next venture was &quot;Kaamchor&quot;, also produced by him, which became a hit, but the success of this film was attributed to its music and the heroine Jaya Prada. His next solo hero film &quot;Shubh Kaamna&quot;, directed by K. Vishwanath, was a hit. He tried to re-launch himself as a lead hero with &quot;Bhagwaan Dada&quot; (1986), directed by J. Om Prakash and starring Rajinikanth as the main lead and himself in the second lead. But the film was a flop. Between 1984 and 1990 he only got supporting roles, with the exception of &quot;Bahurani&quot;. The multi-star films where he was the second lead, such as &quot;Maqaar&quot; and &quot;Ek Aur Sikander&quot; were successful. His last film as a leading hero was &quot;Bahurani&quot;, which was a woman-oriented film starring Rekha in the lead, which was directed by Manik Chatterjee and released in 1989.

===1987–1999===
Rakesh made his directorial debut with the action drama (1987), starring Jeetendra, Shatrughan Sinha, Govinda, Bhanupriya, Amrita Singh and Neelam Kothari. The film emerged as a huge commercial success at the box-office.

He next directed the revenge drama thriller &quot;Khoon Bhari Maang&quot; (1988), starring Rekha alongside Kabir Bedi and Sonu Walia. The film received highly positive reviews upon release, and became a major commercial success at the box-office. It was also noted as a path-breaking film, emerging as one of the first successful films with the heroine as the central protagonist. The film also earned Rekha her second Filmfare Award for Best Actress, in addition to Roshan&#x27;s first nominations for Best Film and Best Director. He followed it up with the action comedy &quot;Kishen Kanhaiya&quot; (1990), starring Anil Kapoor in dual roles, alongside Madhuri Dixit and Shilpa Shirodkar.

His next directorial venture was the romantic comedy &quot;Khel&quot; in 1992 starring an ensemble cast of Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit, Anupam Kher, Mala Sinha and Sonu Walia in lead roles and action comedy &quot;King Uncle&quot; in 1993 starring an ensemble cast of Jackie Shroff, Anu Aggarwal, Shah Rukh Khan, Nagma and Paresh Rawal in lead roles. Both &quot;Khel&quot; and &quot;King Uncle&quot; were commercially successful and have since gained cult status, being well received by families and children. &quot;King Uncle&quot; was one of few early successful films in which Shah Rukh Khan played a supporting role or second lead. It is also first film of Rakesh Roshan with Shah Rukh Khan. 

His next directorial venture was the melodramatic thriller &quot;Karan Arjun&quot; (1995), starring Raakhee Gulzar, Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Mamta Kulkarni and Amrish Puri in lead roles. The film received positive reviews from critics, and emerged as a blockbuster at the box-office, ranking as the second-highest-grossing Indian film of the year. It also earned Roshan his second nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Film and Best Director. 

He next directed the action thriller &quot;Koyla&quot; (1997), starring Shah Rukh and Dixit. The film received mixed reviews from critics, and emerged as an average grosser at the box-office, ranking as the ninth highest-grossing Indian film of the year.

=== 2000–present ===
==== 2000 assassination attempt ====
On 21 January 2000, Roshan was shot at by two Budesh gang members near his office on Tilak Road at Santacruz, Mumbai. The assailants fired two bullets at him, one of which hit him on the left arm, while the other grazed his chest. As the director fell to the ground, the assailants fled the scene. The culprits were later identified as Sunil Vithal Gaikwad and Sachin Kamble. The attack on Rakesh was not undertaken with the intent to kill, but to signal that the Shiv Sena could no longer protect its clients. Rakesh had stonewalled demands from Budesh for a percentage of the profits from the overseas earnings of his hit film &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot;.

==== Career ====

He launched his son Hrithik&#x27;s career as a lead actor with the musical romantic thriller &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot; (2000), alongside debutante Ameesha Patel.

It emerged as a major commercial success at the box-office, ranking as the second highest-grossing Indian film of the year. &quot;Krrish&quot; earned Rakesh his fifth nominations for the Filmfare Award for Best Film and Best Director.

In 2008, he produced the comedy thriller &quot;Krazzy 4&quot; which marked his first production-only venture. Directed by Jaideep Sen and starring Juhi Chawla, Arshad Warsi, Irrfan Khan, Rajpal Yadav and Suresh Menon, the film received negative reviews and emerged as a commercial failure at the box-office.

In 2010, he produced the Bollywood-meets-Hollywood crossover film titled &quot;Kites&quot;, directed by Anurag Basu and starring Hrithik alongside Mexican actress Bárbara Mori. Despite hype prior to release, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews upon release, and emerged as a commercial failure at the box-office. Another version of this film was released internationally and known as . This version was shorter, and mainly toned down the amount of musical numbers. 

His next directorial was &quot;Krrish 3&quot; (2013), the third film of the &quot;Krrish&quot; franchise. With Hrithik and Chopra reprising their roles from the previous film, it also stars Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut.

<text>Junák – český skaut (&quot;Junák – Czech Scouting&quot;), is the internationally recognized organization of Scouts and Guides of the Czech Republic. Founded in 1911, Junák – český skaut is the largest organisation of children and youth in the nation, with a membership of 73,315 (as of 2022).

==History==
A voluntary, non-political civic organization, without restriction to membership, Junák was founded in 1911 by Antonín Benjamin Svojsík, who, after visiting British Scouts, wanted to establish a similar movement in his homeland. In 1910, inspired by the writings of Baden-Powell, Svojsík wrote &quot;Základy junáctví&quot; (&quot;The Foundations of Scouting&quot;), the first handbook for Scouts already operating in the Czech lands. In that book, he combined Baden-Powell&#x27;s system of education; ideas of the American writer, traveller and painter Ernest Thompson Seton (founder of Woodcraft); and the traditions of the Czech nation. He followed this with an experimental camp in 1912. The participants walked the entire 200 km distance on foot, and their luggage was brought there on a single large push-cart. In the quickly developing world of Scouting at the time, &quot;Junák-Český skaut&quot; provided a model to be followed by many other developing national associations.

Scouting in the Czech Republic has a long and distinguished history. The independent organization Junák was established in June 1914, the same year its first Scouting newsletter was issued; the chairman was Čeněk Klika and Svojsík was the Chief Scout. A month later World War I started and many leaders were called up to fight. In January 1915, the first Girl Scouts were introduced, under the leadership of Vlasta Koseová, and shortly thereafter, a section for Guide Education was established. Anna Berkovcová became the Chief Guide. The same summer, the first Girl Guide company &quot;Anemones&quot; held a camp on the banks of river Vltava.

In 1918, at the creation of the Czechoslovak Republic, the Czech Scouts offered their services, and helped the established government with many things, they kept patrol over important buildings and sites, but they are best known for their mail delivery service, delivering official mail in Prague. They had their own stamps, the first Scout stamps in the world, which are very rare and valuable today among stamp-collectors. On 21 December 1918, &quot;Czech Scout mail&quot; was restored, due to the arrival of President Masaryk from exile. The ranks of Scouting grew rapidly in the new country, and in 1922 a National Scout festival took place in Prague to commemorate 10 years of Scouting. Following the end of World War I, the different associations within Czechoslovakia came together in one united national association, and the Czechoslovakian Scout and Guide Federation was among the charter members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922, with Svojsík elected to the World Committee.

Before World War II, Junák had the third most members of any Scout Association in Europe, and numbered seventh in the world; by 1936 the number of Scouts in Czechoslovakia was 70,000. Junák bid to host the World Jamboree in 1933. The preparations started in earnest and in 1931 Czech Scouts prepared the &quot;All-Slavonic Jamboree&quot; as the test for the World Jamboree, a successful festival which culminated in a march through Prague and an address by President Masaryk at Prague castle. But in the end the World Jamboree was to take place in Hungary. Czech Scouts participated in all World Jamborees from the first in 1920 through 1937. At the 1937 World Jamboree in the Netherlands, the Junák contingent had 314 members.

Antonín Benjamin Svojsík died on 17 September 1938. Czech Scouts and Guides unified on 22 January 1939 to found the new association called Junák. The Chief Scout was Rudolf Plajner and the Chief Guide was Vlasta Koseová. Junák was abolished by force and Scouting prohibited by German State Secretary Karl Hermann Frank during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia on 28 October 1940. Many Scouts and Guides joined the Czech Resistance; over 700 of them died during the war as part of the movement. After the war, the association was re-registered in Prague in 1945, following the country&#x27;s liberation, with 120,000 members registered in 1946, the number of members grew to nearly 250,000, (making it the second largest association in the World Movements at that time), and in 1947, a contingent of 500 represented Junák at the World Scout Jamboree in France, sporting two Scout bands. In summer 1946, Lady Olave Baden-Powell visited Czechoslovakia and she was welcomes in the whole country by Scouts and Guides. After the war, in lieu of Scout camps, their participants helped in local agriculture. Chief Guide Vlasta Koseová became the Vice-chairman of the World Committee of WAGGGS and Chairman Velen Fanderlik was a member of the World Scout Committee of WOSM.

However, in 1948, after the Communist coup, Junák was disbanded; beginning in 1949, trials were held against various Junák Commissioners, some of whom were sentenced to many years of imprisonment in communist concentration camps, where many of them died. Many Junák troops continued to meet in secret. In 1968, during the Prague Spring, Scouts and Guides again began meeting openly, until Junák was banned by order of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, in October 1970. During that period, the number of Scouts in Czechoslovakia was 65,000. Again, many Junák units continued to operate in secret.

After the 1989 Velvet Revolution, Junák was one of the first organisations to re-emerge from working underground, by then, for the fourth time in its history. By the close of 1989, the number of Scouts in Czechoslovakia was 80,000. On 1 February 1990, the Federation of Czech and Slovak Scouting was officially registered, paving the way for its re-admittance to the World Organization during the World Scout Conference in Paris in July 1990, re-recognised by the major world Scouting organisations (see below). Upon Czechoslovakia&#x27;s dissolution on 31 December 1992, Český Junák (as it was then called) and Slovenský skauting were required to apply for membership of the World Organization as the national member organizations of the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, respectively. On June 30 1996, Junák – svaz skautů a skautek ČR was welcomed as the 141st member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. In 1998, Junák became one of the founding members of the Czech Council of Children and Youth, a national youth council that aims to protect the rights and interests of Czech young people. Membership in 2019 was 64,383 Scouts and Guides in the Czech Republic. During the summer of 2018, 1,039 camps were held. In 2001, Junák hosted the European Guide and Scout Conference, in Prague.

==Organisation and structure==
Czech Scouts within Junák are members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM), the Guides are members of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS), and the Adult Scouts and Guides of the International Scout and Guide Fellowship (ISGF).

The &quot;Adult Scout and Guide Guild&quot;, also known as &quot;Czech Scout and Guide Fellowship&quot;, changed their name in 2007 from &quot;The Old Scout Guild&quot; into &quot;The Adult Scout and Guide Guild&quot;.

The association has a total membership of some 64,000 operating in a country with a population of around 10.5 million people. Junák is a &quot;Scout and Guide National Organization&quot; in accordance with the Statement on Relationships between WAGGGS and WOSM.

The organisational body of Junák is divided into 14 regions and below 80 districts, overseen by the National Assembly (14 elected, 17 appointed by regions and internal bodies), led by the Chief Scout and Chief Guide, who, in turn, appoint the president and the members of the executive committee of Junák.

Communications between the districts and regions, and to Junák headquarters, includes monthly information packages sent to all groups, mostly by e-mail.

==Events==
The Scouts and Guides in Junák organise many events on the national and local level. One of them is the Svojsík&#x27;s Race, which takes place every two years. Junák hosted Intercamp in 1994, 2004 and 2016, and the Czech Rover Moot Obrok, every two years and the Water Scouts hold a national water-themed jamboree, Navigamus, every three years. Junák also organises monetary drives and information campaigns, e.g. in support of cancer research and development projects in Ethiopia. Every Christmas, Czech Scouts and Guides distribute the Bethlehem Light around the country.

Junák publishes four magazines, for its various divisions, as well as various other materials, numbering roughly 15–20 different publications a year. The organisation also maintains Scout/Guide centres around the country, run by their respective districts and groups. Some of these are open to the public, for a nominal fee, as self-service accommodation.

During the communist era, Scouts, trampers, and other hikers, would trek to Ivančena. These hikes were monitored by the state security. Pilgrimages to the mound continue to this day. Each year on a Saturday near Saint George&#x27;s Day (April 24), Czech Scouts make a pilgrimage to the site. Since 1996, when a plaque commemorating the &quot;Resistance of the Silesian Heroes&quot; was placed at the Jewish cemetery in Cieszyn, Poland, a commemorative event has also been held at this place as part of the pilgrimage. The mound is still growing and is made of stones originating from around the world.

==Program==
The program is as follows:
* Benjamínci/Benjamins – ages 5 to 7
* Vlčata and Světlušky/Cubs and Fireflies – ages 8 to 10
* Skauti and Skautky/Scouts and Guides – ages 11 to 14
* Roveři/Rovers and Rangers – ages 15 to 26

As Native American symbology and mythology has been popular in Central Europe since the 1880s, the most known merit badge in Czech Scouting is the &quot;Three Feathers of Eagle&quot;, highest one is &quot;Lion Scout&quot;.
Highest award in Czech Scouting is &#x27; for women or &#x27; for men.

===Scout and Guide ideals and symbology===

The Scout Motto (Skautské heslo) is &quot;Buď připraven&quot;, translating as &quot;Be Prepared&quot; in Czech. The Czech noun for a single Scout is Skaut.

The painter Mikoláš Aleš created the Czech Scout emblem-the symbol is the Scout lily, with the head of a Bohemian Shepherd (a legendary symbol of faithfulness and freedom, the historical symbol of Czech frontiersmen), placed on the trefoil. The musician Karel Kovařovic composed the Czech Scout anthem.

<doc id="1293882" wikidata="Q15954764" url="?curid=1293882" title="Feast of the Baptism of the Lord">
<text>The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, or Theophany, is the feast day commemorating the baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River by John the Baptist. Originally the baptism of Christ was celebrated on Epiphany, which commemorates the coming of the Magi, the baptism of Christ, and the wedding at Cana. Over time in the West, however, the celebration of the baptism of the Lord came to be commemorated as a distinct feast from Epiphany. It is celebrated in the Catholic Church as well as the Anglican and Lutheran Churches on the first Sunday following The Epiphany of Our Lord (January 6). Some Lutheran churches celebrate it on the Sunday before Lent, or Quinquagesima.

==Celebration in the Eastern Christian Churches==
In the Eastern Orthodox and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the Baptism of the Lord is celebrated as an integral part of the celebration on January 6, the Great Feast of the Theophany. For those churches which follow the traditional Julian calendar, January 6 falls on January 19 of the modern Gregorian calendar (see Epiphany (holiday) and Theophany for details).

==Celebration in the Western Christian Churches==

===Catholic Church===
The Baptism of the Lord is observed as a distinct feast in the Roman rite, although it was originally one of three Gospel events marked by the feast of the Epiphany. Long after the visit of the Magi had in the West overshadowed the other elements commemorated in the Epiphany, Pope Pius XII instituted in 1955 a separate liturgical commemoration of the Baptism.

Currently, the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord is usually celebrated the Sunday after Epiphany. The exception is when Epiphany is observed on January 7th of 8th; this causes the Baptism to be celebrated on the Monday immediately following Epiphany. When celebrated on Sunday, the Baptism is part of Christmas Time, but when displaced to Monday it falls in Ordinary Time.

==== History ====
The Tridentine calendar had no feast of the Baptism of the Lord for almost four centuries. Then the feast was instituted, under the denomination &quot;Commemoration of the Baptism of our Lord&quot;, for celebration on 13 January as a major double, using for the Office and the Mass those previously said on the Octave of the Epiphany, which Pius XII abolished; however, if the Commemoration of the Baptism of Our Lord occurred on Sunday, the Office and Mass were to be those of the Feast of the Holy Family without any commemoration.

In his revision of the calendar five years later, Pope John XXIII kept on 13 January the &quot;Commemoration of the Baptism of our Lord Jesus Christ&quot;, with the rank of a second-class feast.

A mere 14 years after the institution of the feast, Pope Paul VI set its date as the first Sunday after January 6 (as early as January 7 or as late as January 13) or, if in a particular country the Epiphany is celebrated on Sunday, January 7 or Sunday, January 8, on Monday, January 8 or Monday, January 9, respectively.

Pope John Paul II initiated a custom whereby on this feast the Pope baptizes babies in the Sistine Chapel.

===Lutheran Churches===
In the past, the Lutheran Churches as with other Western Christian Churches, commemorated the Baptism of the Lord on the octave of the Feast of the Epiphany.

The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord is celebrated today in many Lutheran parishes as a separate feast, on the first Sunday after the feast of the Epiphany.

Lutheran Churches with Scandinavian history, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Synod celebrate the Baptism of Christ on the final Sunday before Lent on Quinquagesima Sunday. Chronologically, the Temptation of Jesus, heard on the 1st Sunday in Lent, immediately follows the Baptism of Jesus. This order follows the lectionary which Johannes Bugenhagen included in his church order he brought to Denmark.

===Anglican Communion===
In the Church of England, Epiphany may be observed on January 6, or on the Sunday between January 2 and 8. If Epiphany is observed on a Sunday on January 6 or before, the Baptism of Christ is observed on the following Sunday. If the Epiphany is observed on January 7 or 8, the Baptism of Christ is observed on the following Monday, on January 8 or 9. In the Church of England, Ordinary Time does not begin until the day after the Presentation of Christ in the Temple.

In the Episcopal Church [USA], Epiphany is always celebrated on January 6, and the Baptism of the Lord is always celebrated on the following Sunday. It is not clear as to whether or not the Feast of the Baptism of our Lord is the end of Christmastide for the Episcopal Church. On one hand, the Prayer Book refers to the &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas,&quot; and clearly distinguishes the Christmas and Epiphany seasons, the latter extending until Ash Wednesday. On the other hand, the Prayer Book allows for the continued use of Christmas prayers and readings on the weekdays following the Epiphany and leading up to the Baptism of our Lord. Further, the Epiphany and the Baptism of Christ are viewed as specially connected, allowing the interpretation that Christmastide does extend through and end with the Feast of our Lord&#x27;s Baptism on the Sunday following the Epiphany.

===Methodist Churches===

The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord is celebrated in many Methodist parishes on the second Sunday in January, after the feast of the Epiphany has already occurred.

<text>Chinavision was a Canadian television broadcasting company.

It was launched in 1984 by Francis Cheung of Toronto, Ontario to provide a first pay-TV station for Chinese language viewers in Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia. The station&#x27;s content was roughly 90% Cantonese and 10% Mandarin.

The station expanded to Edmonton, Alberta and Calgary, Alberta in 1987 by acquiring Cathay International Television. The station rights were later sold to The Fairchild Group (owned by Happy Valley Investments Limited via Thomas Fung) and Condor (owned by TVB Limited of Hong Kong) after receivership in 1990, to form Fairchild TV in 1993.

==Content==

Contingent on the application to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) Chinavision was required to have minimum of 30% Canadian made programs with the remainder from sources outside of Canada (mainly Hong Kong, China).

==Broadcasting time==

Chinavision&#x27;s broadcaster hours were limited to two periods:

* 4:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. weekdays
* 2:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. on weekends

Original broadcast time was from 5pm to 1am daily.

Programming in Toronto was replayed in Vancouver and other markets.

==Studios==

Studios in Toronto were located within the city (160 Duncan Mills Road) and moved after the sale to Fairchild to Richmond Hill, Ontario.

==Subscription==

Viewers of Chinavision, namely in Toronto area had to obtain a converted box that had to connected to their existing cable boxes to decode signals for the channel. Thus Chinavision was only available to cable subscribers only.

In 1991 Chinavision had about 110,000 subscribers across Canada (Toronto, Vancouver, Edmonton and Calgary).

==China influence in Chinavision==

Chinavision was involved in an investigation by CSIS on their speculations of connections to Chinese authorities trying to influence media after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.

==Sale==

After 1990 Chinavision was in facing financial difficulties and was sought out by two buyers, but eventually sold to Fairchild Group in 1993, who transformed the channel to Fairchild TV.

==Former staff and Others Connected with Chinavision==

A number of TVB staff and other Hong Kong personalities were hired or worked with the station from 1984 to 1990s:

* Louise Li - Hong Kong actress was newspresenter in Toronto in the 1980s (1986-1989)
* Lau Dan - Hong Kong actor who briefly worked for the station when his family moved to Canada (son Harwick Lau attended school in Toronto until 1994)

<doc id="1293956" wikidata="Q1820771" url="?curid=1293956" title="Leslie Banks">
<text>Leslie James Banks CBE (9 June 1890 – 21 April 1952) was an English stage and screen actor, director and producer, now best remembered for playing gruff, menacing characters in black-and-white films of the 1930s and 1940s, but also the Chorus in Laurence Olivier&#x27;s wartime version of &quot;Henry V&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Leslie Banks was born in West Derby, Liverpool, Lancashire, to George and Emily (&quot;née&quot; Dalby) Banks. He attended school at Glenalmond College in Scotland, and later studied at Keble College, Oxford with the intention of becoming a parson, but decided against this.

He joined Frank Benson&#x27;s company, and made his acting debut in October 1911 at the town hall in Brechin, playing Old Gobbo in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. He then toured the United States and Canada with Henry V. Esmond and Eva Moore in 1912 and 1913. Returning to London, he appeared for the first time on the West End stage at the Vaudeville Theatre on 5 May 1914, as Lord Murdon in &quot;The Dangerous Age&quot;.

During the First World War he served with the Essex Regiment. He received injuries that left his face partially scarred and paralysed. In his acting career he would use this injury to good effect, by showing the unblemished side of his face when playing comedy or romance and the scarred, paralysed side of his face when playing drama or tragedy. After the war, Banks joined the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. He returned to London in 1921, and established himself as a leading dramatic actor and West End star known for his powerful yet restrained performances.

Working in both London and New York City, he gained prominence on both sides of the Atlantic, and it was when he was in New York that Kenneth Macgowan persuaded him to go to Hollywood and make his first credited movie debut there in &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; in 1932.

==Film career==

His formidable bulk and intimidating aspect served him well in his first important film role, as a diabolical Russian hunter of human prey in &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; (1932). The film features Joel McCrea and Fay Wray. For the rest of his career, he divided his time between Britain and the United States and between film and theatre. His other film roles included Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1934), Erich Pommer&#x27;s &quot;Fire Over England&quot; (1937), &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot; (1939, for Hitchcock and Pommer again), Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; (1944), and David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Madeleine&quot; (1950). Against &#x27;type&#x27;, Banks starred in &quot;The Arsenal Stadium Mystery&quot; (1939), as the eccentric Inspector Anthony Slade.

His theatre roles included &quot;Eliza Comes to Stay&quot; (his American debut in 1914), Captain Hook in &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (his New York debut in 1924), the title role in &quot;Clive of India&quot; (1934), Petruchio in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1937), the schoolmaster in &quot;Goodbye, Mr Chips&quot; (1938), and James Jarvis in the Kurt Weill musical &quot;Lost in the Stars&quot; (1950).

==Personal life==
He married Gwendoline Haldane Unwin in 1915; they had three daughters, Daphne, Virginia, and Evangeline. Banks was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his services to theatre in 1950, the year of his last appearances on stage and screen. He died in 1952, aged 61, from a stroke he suffered while walking, and is buried in St Nicholas Churchyard in the village of Worth Matravers, Dorset.

<text>Cathay International Television was a Canadian television broadcasting company.

Formed in 1982 when a partnership (consisting of Bernard T.C. Liu, Kent Lee, Sing Kwan So and Brian Sung) as World View as a multi-ethnic regional pay television network in British Columbia, but forced to re-organize under bankruptcy in 1984 when it ran into financial problems and acquire interest in fulfilling 92 hours a week of ethnic broadcasting.

After the departure of Liu, the remaining partners formed Cathay International Television Incorporated (following approval by the CRTC) and changed their format to provide 96% Chinese content on the new channel with the rest with other ethnic programming.

The channels main programming was from Hong Kong with only 21.5 hours from local programming (local programs and news).

The company grew from a Vancouver area broadcaster to become a regional broadcaster (in Calgary and Edmonton), but failed to provide access to non-Chinese programming as required by the CRTC. It was purchased in 1987 by Chinavision Canada to become a national cable channel for Chinese language communities in Canada. Today it is part of Fairchild TV broadcasting network.

==Key Personnel==

* Kent Lee, President of Cathay and former Director of World View
* Sing Kwan So (1927–2014) Chairman and Secretary, former druggist in Hong Kong and grocer in Guyana and founder of Wing Hing Company of Vancouver

<doc id="1294010" wikidata="Q7553998" url="?curid=1294010" title="Soft left">
<text>The soft left, also known as the open left, inside left and historically as the Tribunite left, is a faction within the British Labour Party. The term &quot;soft left&quot; was coined to distinguish the mainstream left, represented by former leader Michael Foot, from the hard left, represented by Tony Benn. People belonging to the soft left may be called soft leftists or Tribunites.

==Definition==
In the context of the Labour Party, the term &quot;soft left&quot; was coined in 1981, when Neil Kinnock refused to support Tony Benn for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party . It described a faction of the party which disagreed with the conservative tendencies of the Labour right and the radical tendencies of the &quot;Bennite&quot; left, also known as the hard left. In parliament, it was represented by the Tribune Group of MPs and consequently came to be known as the Tribunite left as well. The soft left also aligned itself with the Labour Co-ordinating Committee (LCC).

The soft left was initially considered another faction in the Labour left along with the Bennite left, though unlike the Bennite left, it was willing to compromise on some issues to keep the party united and electable. Neil Kinnock, a leader of the soft left, became leader of the Labour Party in 1983. When he moved rightwards in this role, the soft left followed him. As alliances were made between the soft left and the party leadership, the ideological distinctiveness of the LCC and the Tribune Group declined. The soft left formed an alliance with the Labour right to oppose the Bennite left and support Kinnock&#x27;s leadership. During his leadership, the soft left also formed a new moderniser faction with members of the Labour right against the party&#x27;s traditionalist faction. The soft left was no longer an identifiable faction on the Labour left by the time of the 1992 general election, with the Tribune Group disbanding by the time Tony Blair became Labour leader in 1994. The process whereby the soft left drifted away from the Labour left and pitched itself against the Bennite left is known as the &quot;realignment of the left&quot;.

In modern politics, the soft left refers to a faction in the Labour Party which opposed the New Labour project but has avoided the politics of the modern Labour left, also known as the hard left. Ideologically, it is described as centre-left and is typically thought to occupy the space in the party between the Labour left and the Labour right. While the Labour left is more supportive of socialism, the soft left is more supportive of social democracy. It believes in compromising more traditional socialist policies to make Labour more electable. It is one of the four main factions in the modern Labour Party.

The term &quot;soft left&quot; has been said to carry negative connotations which can suggest a less enthusiastic approach to socialism. It has been argued that the term &quot;inside left&quot; should be used instead. The left-leaning magazines &quot;New Statesman&quot; and &quot;Tribune&quot; have used the term as well. However, unlike the term &quot;hard left&quot;, which can be considered pejorative, &quot;soft left&quot; members have used the term as a self-descriptor to distance themselves from the &quot;hard left&quot;. Soft left MP Lisa Nandy advocates a &quot;better name&quot; for the faction; she has said the term &quot;sounds a bit like you&#x27;ve sort of collapsed into a jellyfish&quot;. Open Labour, the main organisation representing the soft left, has preferred to use the term &quot;open left&quot;.

==History==
The distinction between hard and soft left became evident during the leadership of Michael Foot (1980–1983), who, along with Tony Benn, was one of the two figureheads of the party left. Supporters of Foot (an anti-communist whose background was in the Tribune group) and Benn (originally on the party&#x27;s right but by the end of the 1970s to Foot&#x27;s left and a more uncompromising supporter of unilateral nuclear disarmament) became increasingly polarised.

In the election for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party in 1981, left-wingers such as Neil Kinnock abstained from voting for Tony Benn, signaling the emergence of an independent soft left grouping in the party. The term came to be used in contrast to hard left, who were more explicitly socialist in rhetoric, remaining associated with Benn. In common with the party right, the soft left was suspicious of the hard left&#x27;s alliance with Trotskyism (particularly its links with Militant), supported a parliamentary rather than extra-parliamentary road to socialism, retreated from a commitment to widening public ownership of the economy, and tended towards Atlanticist or Europeanist rather than anti-imperialist foreign policy.

The parliamentary group which came to be associated with the soft left was the &quot;Tribune&quot; group. The &quot;Tribune&quot; group was formed around the newspaper of the same name and had represented the party left as a whole until Benn&#x27;s allies formed the Socialist Campaign Group. The Labour Co-ordinating Committee grew to become the soft left&#x27;s main factional organisation in the 1980s, despite having begun its life as a Bennite or &quot;hard left&quot; body. The soft left, influenced by the intellectual interventions of Mike Rustin, Geoff Hodgson and Peter Hain, increasingly rejected the socialism from above of Stalinism and social democracy. It stressed pluralism, including multifarious forms of social ownership and widening Labour&#x27;s electoral coalition. Figures identified with the soft left in the 1980s included MPs David Blunkett, Robin Cook, Bryan Gould and Clare Short.

While Kinnock initially emerged from the soft left, portraying himself as a &quot;media-friendly Michael Foot&quot;, he tacked to the right of the Tribune group, although they continued to vote with him in the National Executive Committee. Soft left candidates increasingly gained positions in the party leadership after 1983, but Kinnock and deputy leader Roy Hattersley kept the party to their right. Kinnock&#x27;s defeat in the 1992 general election signalled an end to the soft left&#x27;s rise, as they were increasingly marginalised by the modernisation project associated with Tony Blair. The 1980s soft left began to diverge over time; for example, some figures (such as Blunkett) became loyalists to Blair by the end of the 1990s. However, activist figures such as the National Executive Committee member Ann Black and a range of MPs continued to work as part of the &#x27;broad left&#x27;.

==Contemporary soft left==
In 2015, Neal Lawson, the chair of the think tank Compass, identified the organisation as a successor to the soft left. Compass disaffiliated from Labour in 2011 in order to open up their membership to people belonging to other political parties. The activist group Open Labour was launched in 2015 with the aim of developing a new forum for the soft left political tradition within the party, which it hopes to recast as the &quot;Open Left&quot;. In the 2017 general election, several Open Labour activists were elected to Parliament including Open Labour Treasurer Alex Sobel, Emma Hardy, and Rosie Duffield.

In the aftermath of the party leadership (2015–20) of Jeremy Corbyn, who has been identified as a hard left MP, the term was generally used to mean &quot;the space between Corbynite remnants on the left, and Progress and Labour First on the right&quot;. Keir Starmer, the current leader of the Labour Party, and Angela Rayner, the current deputy leader, have both been described as soft left.

<text>&quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot; is a song by the rockabilly musician Eddie Cochran, co-written by his girlfriend Sharon Sheeley and his elder brother Bob Cochran, and released in 1959. It has been covered by a wide range of artists, including Johnny Hallyday, Led Zeppelin, and the Sex Pistols.

==Original version==
Bob Cochran, Eddie&#x27;s brother, and Sharon Sheeley share the song writing credit along with Eddie. The first-person lyrics describe how the singer wants a convertible car he cannot afford, and a girl who he fears will not go out with him. But in the end, by saving money, he is able to buy an older car, and works up the confidence to ask the girl out.

Musicians on the session were: Vocals/Guitar: Eddie Cochran, Drums: Gene Reggio, Electric Bass: Don Myers. The song peaked at No. 22 on the UK Singles Chart, and reached No. 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the U.S.

==Renditions==
French singer Johnny Hallyday recorded a version titled &quot;Elle est terrible&quot;. A live version, recorded at the Olympia Hall in Paris, was first released in 1962 and spent one week at the top position on the singles sales chart in France (from December 15 to 21). In Wallonia (French Belgium), it spent 28 weeks on the chart, peaking at No. 4.

It was a part of The Move&#x27;s repertoire in the late sixties, featuring on the EP &quot;Something Else from The Move&quot; recorded in London&#x27;s Marquee Club in 1968.

The Sex Pistols recorded a version of &quot;Something Else&quot; for the album &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; (1979). The double A-sided single was credited to &quot;Sex Pistols: vocals Sid Vicious&quot; and was released three weeks after Vicious died. It peaked at No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. The second side of the single was &quot;Friggin&#x27; in the Riggin&#x27;&quot;, also credited to &quot;Sex Pistols: vocals Steve Jones&quot;.

Canadian band Teenage Head recorded a version of &quot;Somethin&#x27; Else&quot; for their 1980 album &quot;Frantic City&quot;.

English hard rock band UFO covered the song for their 1982 album &quot;Mechanix&quot;.

Led Zeppelin recorded a version during a 1969 BBC session which was released in 1997 as &quot;BBC Sessions&quot;.

<text>Ann Elizabeth Oldfield Butler-Sloss, Baroness Butler-Sloss, GBE, PC (&quot;née&quot; Havers; born 10 August 1933) is a retired English judge. She was the first female Lord Justice of Appeal and was the highest-ranking female judge in the United Kingdom until 2004, when Baroness Hale was appointed to the House of Lords. Until June 2007, she chaired the inquests into the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed. She stood down from that task with effect from that date, and the inquest was conducted by Lord Justice Scott Baker.

==Early life==
Ann Elizabeth Oldfield Butler-Sloss was born on 10 August 1933 to Sir Cecil Havers, a judge, and Enid Flo Havers (&quot;née&quot; Snelling). She was sister to The Lord Havers, a Conservative Lord Chancellor, and is aunt to his sons, the actor Nigel Havers and the barrister Philip Havers. She was educated at Broomfield House School in Kew, in West London, and Wycombe Abbey School, an all-girls independent boarding school in High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. This was followed by a year at the University of Lausanne. She passed the bar without a university degree.

She stood as the Conservative candidate for Vauxhall in the 1958 London County Council election, and the equivalent constituency in the 1959 general election, where she won 38% of the vote, but was defeated by the Labour MP George Strauss.

==Career==
===Legal career===
She was called to the Bar from the Inner Temple in February 1955. In 1970 she was appointed a Registrar of the Principal Probate Registry (the predecessor to the Principal Registry of the Family Division). In 1979, she became the fourth woman to be appointed a High Court judge, after Elizabeth Lane, Rose Heilbron, and Margaret Booth. As were all previous female High Court judges, she was assigned to the Family Division. As per tradition, she was also made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE).

In 1988, she became the first woman appointed as a Lord Justice of Appeal (judge of the Court of Appeal), having chaired the Cleveland child abuse inquiry in the previous year. In 1999, she became President of the Family Division of the High Court of Justice, the first woman to hold this position and the highest-ranking woman judge in the United Kingdom until Brenda Hale became the first female Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, in January 2004. She was known officially as &quot;Lord Justice Butler-Sloss&quot; until Bingham MR issued a practice direction in 1994 to refer to her informally as &quot;Lady Justice Butler-Sloss&quot;; the official title in s2(3) of the Senior Courts Act 1981 was amended by the Courts Act 2003.

She was advanced to the rank of Dame Grand Cross of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours. On 12 January 2005, it was announced that she was retiring, being replaced as President of the Family Division by Sir Mark Potter, then a Lord Justice of Appeal.

On 4 August 2006, she was appointed to the Court of Ecclesiastical Causes Reserved for a period of five years. 

On 7 September 2006, she was appointed as Deputy Coroner of the Queen&#x27;s Household and Assistant Deputy Coroner for Surrey for the purpose of hearing the inquest into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. On 2 March 2007, she was appointed as Assistant Deputy Coroner for Inner West London for the purpose of transferring the jurisdiction of the inquest to Inner West London so that the proceedings may sit in the Royal Courts of Justice. On 24 April 2007, she announced she was stepping down in June 2007, saying she lacked the experience required to deal with an inquest with a jury. The role of coroner for the inquests was transferred to Lord Justice Scott Baker. This had been preceded by the overturning by the High Court of her earlier decision to hold the inquest without a jury.

On 8 July 2014, it was announced that Baroness Butler-Sloss would chair the forthcoming large-scale inquiry into cases of child sex abuse in previous decades. She stood down on 14 July after mounting pressure from victims&#x27; groups and MPs over her suitability regarding the fact that her brother was the Attorney General at the time of some of the abuses in question and her perceived unwillingness to include mention of former Anglican bishop Peter Ball.

===House of Lords===
On 3 May 2006, it was announced by the House of Lords Appointments Commission that she would be one of seven new life peers – so-called &quot;people&#x27;s peers&quot;. She was created Baroness Butler-Sloss, of Marsh Green in the County of Devon, on 13 June 2006. She sits in the House of Lords as a crossbencher. She made her maiden speech on 21 November 2006 during the Debate on the Address on that year&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Speech.

Lady Butler-Sloss has been active in the House of Lords, and served as a member of a number of committees. She was formerly a member of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee (2007–2012). She has been a member of the Ecclesiastical Committee, a Joint committee of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, since 2010 and has served as its chair since June 2020. She has been a member of the Procedure and Privileges Committee, a select committee of the House of Lords since January 2023.

===Other work===
She became Chancellor of the University of the West of England in 1993, and an honorary fellow of St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, Peterhouse, Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, King&#x27;s College London, the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. She sits on the Selection Panel for King&#x27;s Counsel. In December 2004 she was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Bath, and in June 2005 she was awarded an honorary degree from the Open University as Doctor of the University. She was Chairman of the Security Commission prior to its abolition in 2010.

==Personal life==
She married her husband, Joseph William Alexander Butler-Sloss, in 1958. They have three children and two grandchildren.

Baroness Butler-Sloss is a church-going Anglican. In 2002, she chaired the Crown Appointments Committee charged with the selection of a new Archbishop of Canterbury.

<text>Noël Corbu (27 April 1912 – 20 May 1968) is best known as a former restaurateur in the Southern French village of Rennes-le-Château who, between 1955 and 1962 circulated the story that the 19th-century French priest Bérenger Saunière discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile. Corbu changed his story about Saunière in 1962 (see below).

==Early life==

Born on 27 April 1912 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris to Désiré-Victor-Henri Corbu and Marguerite-Marie Corbu ( Rousseau), the granddaughter of François-de-Sales-Narcisse Rousseau (1810-1866), an attorney based in Clamecy, Nièvre who, in the aftermath of the French coup d&#x27;état of 1851, had been forced to flee into exile into Belgium to escape deportation to Cayenne. Corbu had an elder brother, ten years his senior named Charles-Pierre Corbu, an airline pilot employed by the Société Générale des Transports Aériens, who died alongside his mechanic, during a test flight of a commercial aircraft carrying no passengers at Le Bourget Airport, on 10 December 1927. The young Noël Corbu lived in Morocco due to his father being an attaché at the Embassy there, before obtaining the degree of Doctor of Science in Paris. While living in Perpignan, Corbu met his future wife, Henriette Coll, ten years his senior and a native of the town who was then living at 16, rue J. Tastu, where she ran her business of selling poultry, eggs and cheese. The couple married on 21 January 1935. In the following years, Corbu set up a pasta factory which he named &quot;les pâtes Claire&quot; after his eldest child, his daughter Claire, situated at route d&#x27;Elne, Perpignan. By the end of 1942, Perpignan became occupied by German troops.

==Rennes-le-Château==

It was soon afterwards that Corbu decided to send his two children, his daughter Claire and her younger brother, to a more remote and less accessible place, to the village of Bugarach. Corbu published his detective novel, &quot;Le Mort cambrioleur&quot; (&quot;The Burglar Dead&quot;) in 1943.

Through the intermediary of his children&#x27;s school teacher (once Marie Dénarnaud&#x27;s lodger), Corbu found out that Marie Dénarnaud was selling her estate in Rennes-le-Château. After two years of hesitation, Marie Dénarnaud finally agreed to sell her property &quot;en viager&quot; to the Corbus and by her Holographic will dated 22 July 1946, she named Corbu and his wife her sole legatees. Marie Dénarnaud could not afford to keep up her estate, which was in need of repairs and she had run into serious debts (that were settled by Noël Corbu upon purchase). The property comprised the Villa Bethania, the Tour Magdala, an Orangery, and the Belvedere that connects the Tour Magdala to the Orangery.

In 1950 Corbu returned to Morocco hoping to set up a sugar refinery, without success.

When Marie Dénarnaud died in 1953, Corbu inherited her archives relating to Bérenger Saunière. During Easter 1955 Corbu turned the Villa Bethania into a Hotel (called L&#x27;hôtel de la Tour) and opened a restaurant located underneath the belvedere that connects the Tour Magdala to the Orangery (Corbu installed the windows). Later during the 1990s, the Villa Bethania was turned into a hotel again.

In January 1956, the local newspaper La Dépêche du Midi serialised an interview with Corbu in who claimed that Father Saunière discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile, and which &#x27;according to the archives&#x27; consisted of 28,500,000 gold pieces. This was the treasure of the French crown assembled by Blanche de Castile to pay the ransom of Saint Louis, a prisoner of the Saracens, the surplus of which she had hidden at Rennes-le-Château. Saunière had only found one part of it, so it was necessary to continue his investigations. Corbu also claimed Saunière had in 1892 discovered &quot;parchments&quot; whilst renovating his church &quot;written in a mixture of French and Latin, which at first glance could be discerned passages from the Gospels&quot;. It has been noted by critics however that Saunière began renovating his church in 1886, not 1892, and that &quot;there was no evidence that these parchments had ever existed&quot;. Corbu claimed that Marie Dénarnaud would confide a secret to him before she died, saying &quot;Pray do not worry yourself, Monsieur Corbu. You shall have more money than you will be able to spend!&quot; 

Corbu provided a tape-recording of his story for his guests, a transcript of which was deposited in the &quot;Archives de l&#x27;Aude&quot;, Carcassonne on 14 June 1962 by Maurice Tous of Alet-les-Bains.

Corbu&#x27;s story inspired author Robert Charroux to develop an active interest and in 1958, with his wife Yvette and other members of &quot;The Treasure Seekers&#x27; Club&quot; (that he founded in 1951), scanned the village of Rennes-le-Château and its church dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene for treasure using a metal detector. The dowsing-by-pendulum enthusiast and hypnotist Rolland Domergue, with medium Germaine Goyard, joined Corbu in 1958 to look for the treasure, and thus began the extensive accumulation of pilgrimages to the site by many various people from all over France, that on 28 July 1965 forced the local Municipal council to introduce a local By-law prohibiting excavations in the village.

In April 1961, the French Television Channel RTF made a documentary directed by Marina Grey entitled &quot;La Roue Tourne&quot; (&quot;The Wheel Turns&quot;), that cast Noël Corbu as Father Saunière.

Corbu then changed his story about Saunière on an interview for the France Inter radio programme to Robert Charroux in 1962, dropping all references to Blanche of Castile and claiming that Saunière&#x27;s alleged treasure discovery relied upon two alleged inscriptions discovered in 1928: one on a gravestone in the cemetery and another on a stone found on farmland property close to Rennes-le-Château (Corbu alleged both &quot;artifacts&quot; were discovered by a retired amateur archaeologist, Ernest Cros, who died in 1946). In the revised edition of his book &quot;Treasures of the World&quot; published during the 1970s (not translated into English), Robert Charroux added the material given in the 1962 radio interview, but also retained parts of the original chapter on Rennes-le-Château that mentioned Blanche of Castile.

These references to inscriptions by Corbu inspired two documents of unknown provenance called &quot;Recherches de Mons. L&#x27;Ingenieur en chef Ernest Cros; entreprises dans la Haute Vallée de l&#x27;Aude, surtout durant les années 1920 à 1943&quot;, commonly called &quot;The Cros Report&quot; (one of them is said to have originated on Corbu&#x27;s typewriter, the other is attributed to René Chesa).

==Priory of Sion hoax==

Noël Corbu&#x27;s account of the discovery of the parchments by Father Saunière was later quoted in the document &quot;Un Trésor Mérovingien à Rennes-le-Château&quot; (1966) attributed to &quot;Antoine L&#x27;Ermite&quot;, that for &quot;stylistic reasons suggest that this was written by Pierre Plantard and/or Philippe de Chérisey&quot;. Philippe de Chérisey confessed to having forged the famous parchments that appeared in Gérard de Sède’s 1967 book, &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; (as well as faking &quot;The Cros Report&quot;) in his manuscript &quot;Stone and Paper&quot;. The text of the document attributed to &quot;Antoine L&#x27;Ermite&quot; was modelled on Charroux&#x27;s account found in his book, &quot;Trésors du Monde&quot;, where he extensively quoted Noël Corbu.

==Heritage, tourism and archaeology==

Noël Corbu sold the Saunière estate in 1964 to Henri Buthion (1924–2002) and moved to the Château of Saint-Félix-Lauragais which he recently acquired. On 20 May 1968, on his way to Fanjeaux from Montpellier, Corbu&#x27;s car, a Renault 16 was hit by a truck who had failed to yield the right-of-way. Corbu who was not in the driving seat and not wearing his seat belt, was killed instantly, the driver suffered only minor injuries. Corbu was interred in a burial vault alongside his wife (who died in 1966) in the cemetery of Rennes-le-Château. The estate has been the property of the local Municipal council since 2000.

Noël Corbu&#x27;s daughter Claire Corbu with her husband Antoine Captier (whose grandfather was the carillonneur of the church of Rennes-le-Château, when Bérenger Saunière was the local priest), first published their book &quot;L&#x27;Héritage de l’Abbé Saunière&quot; in 1985, reproducing a selection of archives relating to Bérenger Saunière, and in May 1989 opened the &quot;Saunière Museum&quot; in the village of Rennes-le-Château as part of the &quot;Association Terre de Rhedae&quot;, also part of the local Municipal council. When the &quot;Saunière Museum&quot; re-opened on 1 March 2009, the story of Bérenger Saunière and the history of Rennes-le-Château was presented in four different languages. The museum was re-opened and re-furbished more recently in 2016 and called &quot;Le Musée Domaine de l&#x27;Abbé Saunière&quot;.

While the local Municipal council superficially accepts the legend of the treasure of Rennes-le-Château because it acts as a tourist magnet attracting substantial financial revenue (for example, endorsing DVDs that publicise the legend), the legend is not treated seriously by French archaeology (itself part of the French Ministry of Culture). For example, when the then village mayor gave the go-ahead to excavate the Tour Magdala in 2003 he was subsequently threatened with legal action by the local body of &quot;Direction régionale des affaires culturelles&quot; (or DRAC) for doing so without gaining prior official permission and therefore breaching the French &quot;Code du patrimoine&quot;.

<doc id="1294089" wikidata="Q6670641" url="?curid=1294089" title="London Outer Orbital Path">
<text>The London Outer Orbital Path—more usually the &quot;London LOOP&quot;—is a 150-mile (242 km) signed walk along public footpaths, and through parks, woods and fields around the edge of Outer London, England, described as &quot;the M25 for walkers&quot;. The walk begins at Erith on the south bank of the River Thames and passes clockwise through Crayford, Petts Wood, Coulsdon, Banstead, Ewell, Kingston upon Thames, Uxbridge, Elstree, Cockfosters, Chingford, Chigwell, Grange Hill and Upminster Bridge before ending at Purfleet, almost directly across the Thames from its starting point. Between these settlements the route passes through green buffers and some of the highest points in Greater London.

==History==
The walk was first proposed at a meeting between The Ramblers and the Countryside Commission in 1990. It was given an official launch at the House of Lords in 1993. The first section was opened on 3 May 1996, with a ceremony on Farthing Downs, Coulsdon. Other sections followed at the rate of two or three per year as signs were installed and leaflets for individual sections published, the route becoming fully walkable in 2001. Following the election of Ken Livingstone as Mayor of London, the London Loop became one of his key routes, along with its sister route, the Capital Ring.

==Route==


The route is divided into 24 sections in three groups: the &quot;blue&quot; group in South London, the &quot;green&quot; group in north-west London, and the &quot;yellow&quot; group in north-east London. The sections vary in length, from section 14 to section 16. Some sections start and/or end directly at public transport stops. However most sections have a further waymarked &#x27;LOOP Link&#x27; to from their start and/or end to the nearest train or underground station. Additionally, there are waymarked &#x27;LOOP Links&#x27; to train station midway along some sections. All these links are listed in the table below. 

===South London (sections 1–8)===
The Loop officially begins by the River Thames in Erith. Points of interest in these sections south of the Thames include: Hall Place, the memorial to William Willett (advocate of summer time), the Wilberforce Oak, Shirley Windmill, Happy Valley, Farthing Downs, the Mayfield Lavender Farm and the Coronation Stone in Kingston.

===North-west London (sections 9–16)===
Having crossed the Thames at Kingston Bridge the Loop continues north of the river. Points of interest in these sections include: Bushy Park, the Shot Tower by the River Crane, the Grand Union Canal, the ancient woodland of Park Wood, Grim&#x27;s Dyke and a cottage where David Livingstone once lived.

=== North-east London (sections 17–24)===
Commencing at Cockfosters, the final third of the Loop heads south to its end at the Thames in Purfleet. Points of interest in these sections include: the New River, Forty Hall, Gilwell Park, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hunting Lodge in Epping Forest, the Wellingtonia Avenue in Havering Country Park, the valley of the River Ingrebourne, the Upminster Windmill, Hornchurch Country Park, the Concrete Barges by the Thames at Rainham and the RSPB Centre by the marshes at Purfleet.

Signposts, waymarks and information boards direct the walker along the route. In countryside locations the waymarks consist mostly of a simple white disc mounted on a wooden post, with a directional arrow and flying kestrel logo in blue and text in green. However, local authorities are responsible for funding these signs, so the quality varies from one borough to the next, with some sections not signed at all. The 54-mile blue route from Erith to Kingston is maintained by the Downlands Countryside Management Project, a joint initiative by several councils, and is complete with signs and information boards, in addition to maps available from Tourist Information Centres.

There is no way to cross the river between Purfleet and Erith to complete the loop, although there was once a ferry to Erith which was mainly used by pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. In 2011 a proposal for a ferry to link the ends, and to link to riverbuses upstream at Woolwich, was shortlisted in the RIBA &quot;Forgotten Spaces&quot; competition.

The full route is also mapped on OpenStreetMap and available on the Go Jauntly app, in partnership with Transport for London.

<doc id="1294091" wikidata="Q3960121" url="?curid=1294091" title="Sid Sings">
<text>Sid Sings is the first released solo live album by English punk rock musician Sid Vicious. It was released posthumously in 1979 and entered the British album charts on 15 December where it peaked at number 30.

The album features the two singles &quot;My Way&quot; and &quot;Something Else&quot;. These songs also appeared in the film and album &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; along with &quot;C&#x27;mon Everybody&quot;, which did not appear on this album. Most of the album features cover songs whilst only one original by Vicious is featured on the album, that being &quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot;, originally a Sex Pistols song that Vicious regularly performed and the only known Sex Pistols song that has a solo version done by him.

==Overview==
The album is thin on liner notes; there are no musicians&#x27; credits or recording info, and the production credit goes to &quot;The Engineer,&quot; John &quot;Boogie&quot; Tiberi.

The bulk of the album comes from lo-fi recordings of performances at Max&#x27;s Kansas City in New York on 28, 29 and 30 September 1978.

The version of the Johnny Thunders song &quot;Born to Lose&quot; on this album reportedly comes from a Sex Pistols concert at Huddersfield, on 25 December 1977. During the children&#x27;s matinee performed during the day, lead singer Johnny Rotten stepped off stage to act as Father Christmas, while the remaining trio played a set, including among other songs &quot;Born to Lose&quot; and &quot;Chinese Rocks&quot;.

Despite having an audio fidelity not much better than the rest of the album, &quot;My Way&quot; comes from a studio session in Paris with French session musicians. The remixed version that was released as a single and on &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; features a different vocal take, an overdubbed guitar solo from Steve Jones and strings, arranged by Simon Jeffes. But on the video version of the song it features Vicious&#x27; vocals on &quot;Sid Sings&quot; but an instrumental version from &quot;The Great Rock and Roll Swindle&quot;. There is also another demo version available from the album &quot;Too Fast To Live&quot;, which is entitled &quot;My Way (Take 3)&quot;.

Mick Jones from The Clash was long rumored to play on the album. His two sets with Vicious have now been released on CD in the double album &quot;Sid Lives&quot;, released by Jungle Records.

The album was not designed by Jamie Reid, the Sex Pistols&#x27; art designer, but he created the guitar swastika that appeared on the labels of the original UK pressings (though the German pressing had a blank spot instead due to the swastika&#x27;s illegality in that country).

==Track listing==
All tracks are live, with the exception of &quot;My Way&quot;.

;Side one

#&quot;Born to Lose&quot; (Johnny Thunders)
#&quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; (Iggy Pop, Ron Asheton)

#&quot;My Way (I Killed The Cat)&quot; (shorter live version Of &quot;My Way&quot;)

Tracks 2, 3, 10, 11 – 1st set, Max&#x27;s Kansas City, New York City, September 29, 1978

Tracks 4, 6, 8, 9 – 1st set, Max&#x27;s Kansas City, New York City, September 28, 1978

Track 7 – 1st set, Max&#x27;s Kansas City, New York City, September 30, 1978

Track 5 - Studio de la Grande Armee, Paris, April 10, 1978

There are talking bits edited in from both the 28th and 29th sets, including quite a few from the second set of the 28th, although no music is included from that set. This helps at least make sense out of the fact that the LP&#x27;s inner sleeve shows a copy of Boogie&#x27;s notes from the second set of the 28th used during compiling the LP.

<doc id="1294092" wikidata="Q742587" url="?curid=1294092" title="La Dépêche du Midi">
<text>La Dépêche, formally La Dépêche du Midi (), is a regional daily newspaper published in Toulouse in Southwestern France with seventeen editions for different areas of the Midi-Pyrénées region. The main local editions are for Toulouse, Ariège, Aude, Aveyron, Haute-Garonne, Gers, Lot, Lot-et-Garonne, Hautes-Pyrénées, Tarn and Tarn-et-Garonne.

==History and profile==
The newspaper first appeared on 2 October 1870 when it was called &quot;La Dépêche de Toulouse&quot;. Publication was prompted by workers at the Sirven print works in Toulouse, which established the paper&#x27;s left-leaning politics. It was at &quot;La Dépêche&quot; that the Socialist politician Jean Jaurès wrote his first articles. The paper also published the articles by Georges Clemenceau. In the big issue of the day, the Dreyfus affair, the paper first insisted Alfred Dreyfus had given army secrets to the Germans but then came out in his support.

The paper fell under German control after the occupation of 1940. Like other newspapers that had collaborated during the war, &quot;La Dépêche de Toulouse&quot; was closed by the postwar government in 1944. It reappeared under its current name in 1947. Like its predecessor &quot;La Dépêche du Midi&quot; has a leftist stance.

The newspaper is part of Groupe La Dépêche du Midi. The combined circulation for the 17 regional dailies under &quot;La Dépêche du Midi&quot; was 200,000 copies in 2006.

<text>Yara International ASA is a Norwegian chemical company. It produces, distributes, and sells nitrogen-based mineral fertilizers and related industrial products. Its product line also includes phosphate and potash-based mineral fertilizers, as well as complex and specialty mineral fertilizer products.

The company was established in 1905 as Norsk Hydro — the world&#x27;s first producer of mineral nitrogen fertilizers — and de-merged as Yara International ASA on 25 March 2004. Yara is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and has its headquarters in Oslo. The company has more than 17,000 employees, production sites on six continents, operations in more than 60 countries and sales to about 150 countries.

The Norwegian government owns more than a third of Yara and is its largest shareholder.

==History==

===1900–1919===
The history of Yara dates back to the establishment of Norsk hydroelektiske kvelstoffaktieselskab, or Norsk Hydro, as it later became known, in December 1905 after nitrogen fertilizer was successfully produced at Notodden. Norsk Hydro was founded by Sam Eyde, Kristian Birkeland, and Marcus Wallenberg Sr.. In 1903, Birkeland and Eyde had developed direct nitrogen fixation, called the Birkeland–Eyde process, based on a method used by Henry Cavendish in 1784.

The company used Norway&#x27;s large hydroelectric-energy resources to produce its first product. Between 1906 and 1919 Norsk Hydro built two hydroelectric power plants in Notodden and Rjukan. The company sent its first shipment to China in 1913.

===1960–1977===
Following the successful production of mineral fertilizer, the company expanded into other businesses such as oil and metals. In 1969, Norsk Hydro entered into its first joint venture, with authorities in Qatar. With access to a competitive source of gas and a strategic location in the Middle East, the joint venture opened up a global market for the company.

Norsk Hydro was led by Johan Berthin Holte as CEO from 1967 until 1977. By the 1970s, the company was established in Asia, the Middle East and North America. The late 1970s to the mid-1980s was a period of rapid growth, through the acquisition of major fertilizer companies in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. At the end of the 1990s, the company was also established in Brazil (through the acquisition of Adubos Trevo) and South Africa.

===2004–2008===
In 2004, Hydro Agri de-merged from Norsk Hydro and became an independent company called Yara International ASA. The company was listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 25 March 2004 and is a leading producer of ammonia, nitrates, nitrogen products, and NPK specialty fertilizers. Since then, Yara has continued to expand its global presence through investments in other countries, with many acquisitions, joint ventures, and new projects, primarily in Africa and North and South America.

In July 2006 Yara paid $126 million for a controlling share in Fertibras. This acquisition gave Yara more than 99% of the voting stock in Fertibras and 15% of Fosfertil, the largest producer in Brazil of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers.

===2008–2014===
In 2008, Thorleif Enger retired, and became CEO. On his appointment, Haslestad stated: &quot;Yara must continue its growth strategy. The company has many exciting opportunities to pursue, for instance when it comes to the environment, where we contribute to better balance in agricultural development and deliver some interesting industrial solutions to environmental problems.&quot; Haslestad held the office until 2014, when the company fired him, saying they needed someone who could complete the upcoming merger negotiations and that Haslestad had been on the point of retiring. Svein Richard Brandtzaeg ten days earlier had decided not to leave Hydro to take over the helm of Yara, after contract negotiations were leaked and charges were laid against Enger, the prior CEO. In January Yara reached an agreement with Vale to sell its Brazilian shares of Fosfertil for $785 million US. Also in 2010, ANZ Bank called in the receivers on the 65% share of Burrup owned by, which was later sold to Yara and to Apache Corporation of New York, which had a gas supply agreement with Burrup. In 2016 the Oswal couple was still litigating the fairness of the proceedings, alleging coercion. Radhika has also been accused of dodging a $186 million tax bill. Also in separate proceedings, her husband is alleged to have taken more than $150 million from entities associated with the fertiliser plant and to have spent the money on private planes and other luxury goods. The two left Perth for Dubai in 2010.

On 25 February 2011, the US Treasury Department lifted sanctions that had been in place against Yara subsidiary Libyan Norwegian Fertilizer because of its affiliation with the Libyan government.

In March 2011 the Dutch government froze about €3 billion in Libyan assets, including Yara&#x27;s Sluiskil joint venture, half-owned by the LIA and the NOCL
On 3 August 2011, Yara announced that it was selling its share in its Russian Rossosh NPK plant for $390 million US, or 2.1 billion kroner (NOK).

In 2013 Yara was enmeshed in a scandal that involved many companies and transactions that may not have taken place, Dagens Næringsliv. Norway&#x27;s business daily, reported that Yara had paid over eight million Norwegian krone to Shukri Ghanem, formerly Libya&#x27;s prime minister, oil minister, and senior commander of the state oil company. Ghanem had been found dead in the Austrian Danube in 2012. Yara issued fictitious invoices to account for the money transfers, which were deposited in the bank account of a relative of Ghanem in the UBS Bank in Switzerland. The Norwegian (Økokrim) anti-corruption agency noticed the payments in 2011. The head of the upstream segment, Tor Halba, had warned of possible corrupt practices in a 2008 internal email. Investigators came across the payments when they seized business records for two Swiss-based businesses, one of them Yara&#x27;s fertilizer trading subsidiary, Balderton. Yara&#x27;s own investigation uncovered additional corruption in India. Økokrim charged the company with gross corruption in both cases.

On 26 October 2013, Yara acquired OFD Holding Inc.(OFD) from Omimex Resources Inc. for US$425 million, gaining production facilities in Colombia and distribution companies across Latin America.

===2014===
Norwegian authorities had been informed by the company in 2011 that it might have been involved in corruption in connection with 2008 negotiations leading to 2009&#x27;s investment of 1.5 billion Norwegian kroner into a 50% share of Libyan Norwegian Fertiliser Company, or LIFECO.

In January 2014, the corporation agreed to pay a $48 million fine in a case involving corruption between 2004 and 2009. The company admitted bribing senior government officials in India and Libya, as well as to suppliers in Russia and India. The fine was the largest ever of its kind in Norway. The case puts two cohorts of Yara executives up against each other.

On 10 January 2014, the Norwegian Cabinet approved the indictment of former deputy CEO Daniel Clauw in connection with Norway&#x27;s investigation of Yara. Three other Yara executives were also indicted in the case. They were sentenced 7 July 2015. Enger, the former CEO, received the harshest sentence, three years. The former chief legal officer, Kendrick Wallace, was given a 2½-year sentence, and Clauw and former upstream coordinator Tor Halba were given two-year sentences. Yara International announced in September 2014 that it was in talks with CF Industries about a possible merger of equals, a deal worth over $27 billion.

=== 2015 ===
In Zambia, Yara acquired Greenbelt Fertilizers, a company with a strong footprint in Zambia, Mozambique and Malawi. In September 2015, Svein Tore Holsether joined Yara as the company&#x27;s new President and CEO. In 2015, the last Yara Prize was awarded before it was turned into the Africa Food Prize. The prize was launched in 2005. From 2016 and onwards, the Yara Prize has been turned into the Africa Food Prize, in collaboration with Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA).

In February 2016 the two urea and two ammonia plants Yara has in Brega were operating at less than 50% of their capacity.

In 2017, Yara ordered the , which will be the world&#x27;s first autonomous ship. Entering service in 2018, it will be fully autonomous by 2020.

In connection with the protests in Belarus in 2020, the opposition politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called Yara International to stop working with Belarusian state-owned company Belaruskali or to ensure that they respect workers&#x27; rights. The state-owned company Belaruskali had previously fired employees who had taken part in strikes or demonstrations. In the course of this, Yara published a statement in which they called on the Belarusian state company to stop punishing workers.

In the same year, Yara International partnered with the energy company EnergyNest AS to integrate a 4MWh thermal energy storage unit in their facility in Porsgrunn, Norway.

<doc id="1294104" wikidata="Q5556396" url="?curid=1294104" title="Gheorghe Pop de Băsești">
<text>Gheorghe (or George) Pop de Băsești (; 1 August 1835 – 23 February 1919), also known under the nickname Badea&quot; Gheorgheor Badea&quot; George (roughly &quot;Brother/Uncle George&quot;), was an Imperial Austrian-born Romanian politician, philanthropist and patriot, who served as vice president (1881–1902) and president (1902–1919) of the Romanian National Party at a time when Transylvania was part of the Kingdom of Hungary within Austria-Hungary, and eventually as the president of the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia that declared the Union of Transylvania with Romania on 1 December 1918.

==Early life==
Gheorghe Pop de Băsești was born on 1 August 1835 in the village of Szilágyillésfalva/Băsești (Transylvania, Austrian Empire), as the son of Petru Pop de Băsești and Susana Pop de Turț, both members of the local gentry. He completed the gymnasium in Nagybánya/Baia Mare (the first 6 grades) and in Nagyvárad/Oradea (the last 2 grades of the gymnasium), before moving on to study Law at the Nagyvárad Academy.

After graduating from the Oradea Academy in 1859, Pop de Băsești found a clerk&#x27;s job, but shortly after he was conscripted in the Austrian Imperial Army and participated in the Second Italian War of Independence (1859–1860).

In 1860, after he had been released from the active service, Pop de Băsești returned to his native county, where he worked as first praetor in Hadad/Hodod and as a judge. In 1860, he married Maria Loșonți, with whom he had 2 children: Maria Carolina (who died at the age of 1 on 16 January 1862) and Elena (1862–1940). According to a source, Maria Loșonți, the widow of the Baron Sebeși, had had with Pop de Băsești in 1859 another daughter out of wedlock, Ana, before they married one year later.

==Political activity==
===Deputy in the Diet of Hungary===

On 22 June 1872, Pop de Băsești was elected for the first time deputy in the Hungarian diet in the Szilágycseh electoral district, where, for the following nine years (he was again elected in 1875 and 1878), he advocated for the rights of ethnic Romanians living in Transylvania. In that capacity Pop de Băsești protested vehemently against the consequences of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and the Magyarization conducted via the education laws of 1868 and 1879, the Nationalities Law, the Electoral and Press laws, comparing the status of the Romanians in the Kingdom of Hungary with that of the Irish in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland: &quot;For the Ireland of the Magyar state, for this is what the unfortunate Transylvania is, we have endured in these lands for longer than 2000 years. All our tribulations and hopes bond us to the land on which we live&quot;. On the adoption of the Trefort education bill in 1879, which sought to make the Hungarian language mandatory in primary and confessional schools, Pop de Băsești stated the following: &quot;If it&#x27;s a sin to make an attempt on another man&#x27;s life, in the case of the present law it is a greater sin to make an attempt on the life of an ethnicity, even of more nationalities, of all nationalities of the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen&quot;.

Pop de Băsești&#x27;s personality gained the respect of his political opponent Kálmán Tisza, who declared: &quot;You&#x27;re a fierce man, fanatical Daco-Romanian! We are a world apart from each other. We shall never find any common ground. However I respect the deep conviction with which you defended so heartily the cause of your people&quot;.

In 1879, Pop de Băsești resigned from the (where he held the position of vice president) after having lost the belief that Romanians&#x27; and Hungarians&#x27; interests could be reconciled. His resignation provided the occasion for Kálmán Tisza to attempt convincing Gheorghe Pop de Băsești to join his party: &quot;We would need brave and determined men. Come and join us and I guarantee there is no dignity in Hungary you couldn&#x27;t obtain&quot;, to which Pop de Băsești replied: &quot;Even if you gave me the whole Hungary I would not betray the righteous cause of my poor and unfortunate people, who, beside God, my comrades and myself, has no other defenders against your oppressive tendencies&quot;.

===Romanian National Party===
Subsequently, Pop de Băsești joined the National Party of Romanians in Transylvania. Between 12–14 May 1881, he participated at the national conference in Nagyszeben that sealed the merger of the National Party of Romanians in Transylvania with the National Party of Romanians in Banat and Hungary into the Romanian National Party (, PNR). Pop de Băsești was also elected in the executive committee of the party as the central coordinator for the Szilágy, Szatmár and Máramaros counties.

In 1881, Pop de Băsești ran again for a deputy seat in Szilágycseh, however he lost after the authorities called in 120 gendarmes from 5 surrounding counties. He would not run again until 1905, after the PNR had abandoned the strategy of political passivism.

===The Transylvanian Memorandum===
At the 1887 national conference of the PNR the participants voiced their grievances in regard to the worsening situation of the ethnic Romanians in the Kingdom of Hungary and decided to present the Emperor a petition encompassing the growing complaints against the consequences of the &quot;Ausgleich&quot;: the discrimination and the Magyarization process conducted against the ethnic Romanians, their underrepresentation in the Hungarian Parliament through the electoral laws despite their demographic majority in Transylvania and the way the &quot;Ausgleich&quot; was adopted, without consulting the Transylvanians. Nevertheless, at the next national conference (1890) it was decided to postpone this endeavor to a later, more convenient date. As a result of this decision, in November 1891, Pop de Băsești asked for the resignation of the PNR president Vincențiu Babeș and argued that the leadership of PNR should be taken over &quot;by an appeasing person, with a calm temperament and above all totally independent and master of his own ideas and beliefs&quot;.

Heeding his call, the delegates of the PNR elected in 1892 as president and Pop de Băsești as vice president of the PNR. The new leaders decided to task Vasile Lucaciu and Iuliu Coroianu with drafting and publishing the petition. Under the name of &quot;Transylvanian Memorandum&quot;, the petition was approved by the PNR on 25 March 1892 and brought on 28 May 1892 to Vienna by 300 delegates of the PNR (among them 48 members from Szilágy County, including Pop de Băsești) to be presented to the Emperor Franz Joseph in a sealed envelope. At the request of the Hungarian government, Franz Joseph did not receive the delegation and forwarded the unopened envelope to the Hungarian Prime-Minister, which in turn forwarded it unopened to the Torda-Aranyos Ispán in order to be returned to the sender, Ioan Rațiu, arguing that the Hungarian Ministry of Interior was not authorized to present the Emperor with petitions of individuals not entitled to represent the ethnic Romanians in Hungary.
Met with refusal, PNR published the memorandum in the press. Tensions ran high: Rațiu&#x27;s home in Torda was damaged by Hungarian demonstrators, leading to protests in Romania. After a while, the government in Budapest gave in to pressure from the Hungarian nationalists and in May 1893 it launched proceedings against the PNR president, Raţiu, the vice president, Pop de Băsești, the secretaries Vasile Lucaciu and Septimiu Albini, and other PNR leaders who acknowledged their involvement in drafting and publishing the petition.

Consequently, on 7 May 1894, 14 leaders of the PNR, including Pop de Băsești, were put on trial in Kolozsvár for various charges, ranging from disturbing the peace to high treason. On 25 May 1894, the verdicts were handed down: all the accused were found guilty, and on 27 May 1894, the judge sentenced them to imprisonment for terms ranging from 5 years (Vasile Lucaciu) to 1 year, in total 31 years and 2 months. Pop de Băsești was handed the mildest sentence (of one-year imprisonment), his only regret being that he received less than the others. Present at the trial, Octavian Goga witnessed that moment: &quot;All the accused acknowledged the sentences in a manful manner. Leading the group, Father Lucaciu seemed to be an ancient hero. Mr. Rațiu came in with his head held high. [..] Only Brother Gheorghe wept because he said they mocked him by handing him a milder sentence than his fellows.&quot;

On 28 July 1894, the PNR was banned by the Hungarian authorities, who invoked the lack of a party statute and &quot;relations with foreign elements&quot;.

Pop de Băsești served his sentence in the Vác prison until 5 August 1895. As his wife Maria passed away he was shortly released on parole on 11 June 1895 so that he could attend her burial. Eventually all signatories of the memorandum were pardoned by Emperor Franz Joseph in 1895, following secret negotiations between Austria-Hungary and the Romanian king Carol I.

===Later political activity===

After Ioan Rațiu&#x27;s death in 1902, Gheorghe Pop de Băsești was elected president of the PNR.

On 10 January 1905, Pop de Băsești summoned the national conference of the PNR in Nagyszeben, where it was decided to rescind the policy of political passivism and to engage again in the electoral process. At the elections that year he ran for the deputy seat in Szilágycseh, nevertheless he lost in the second round against the Liberal candidate, Baron Elemér Bornemisza, after harsh measures had been employed to rig the results: Pop de Băsești (then 69 years old) and his supporters were beaten (some of them to death) by political opponents. The situation would repeat during the 1906 elections.

===Philanthropic work===
Although he never abandoned politics, Gheorghe Pop de Băsești focused on providing for poor children in his native area, sponsoring Romanian-language magazines in Transylvania (&quot;Federațiunea&quot;, &quot;Lupta&quot;, &quot;Gazeta de Transilvania&quot;) and founding credit unions to help the ethnic Romanians. By 1909, Pop de Băsești led 6 credit unions: &quot;Aurora&quot; (Naybánya/Baia Mare), &quot;Chiorana&quot; (Nagysomkút/Șomcuta Mare), &quot;Codreana&quot; (Szilágyillésfalva/Băseşti), &quot;Sătmăreana&quot; (Szinérváralja/Seini), &quot;Sălăgeana&quot; and &quot;Silvania&quot; (Szilágysomlyó/Șimleu Silvaniei). He also served in the board of directors of the &quot;&quot; and wrote a book about agriculture.

When the World War I started, Pop de Băsești decided to write his testament and leave his whole wealth (estimated at around 4 million Kronen) to the Greek Catholic Metropolitan in Balázsfalva/Blaj. The will provided that the donated wealth was to be used to establish agricultural schools and Romanian cultural institutes, to award scholarships and to help preserve the local church and school in his native village of Băsești.

===President of the Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia===

Towards the end of World War I, the Austrio-Hungarian monarchy began to disintegrate. On 18 October 1918, inspired by Wilson&#x27;s Fourteen Points and mandated by the executive committee of the PNR, deputy Alexandru Vaida-Voevod demanded in the Hungarian Diet the right of self-determination of the Romanians in Hungary, and afterwards the executive committee established the Romanian National Council, which proceeded to organize elections for a National Assembly of all Romanians in Hungary.

On 30 November 1918 Pop de Băsești, elected as a representative and accompanied by lieutenant Alexandru Kiș of the Romanian National Guard, set off by train to Alba Iulia, despite his old age. The trip was not without incident: in the Războieni railway station their railcar was fired upon by the Hungarian National Guard, killing . However, according to other sources, Ioan Arion, the 24-year old representative of Agriș, was killed in the Teiuș railway station. After he had arrived in Alba Iulia, on a blistering cold day, the monk Leon Manu asked him: &quot;For the love of God, Brother George, how could you venture to make such a long and exhausting journey on such weather?&quot;, to which Pop de Băsești replied: &quot;How could I have missed it since I&#x27;ve been waiting for this day for 80 years? I came even if I should pay with my life for this, because now nothing else remains for me to say but the following, like the righteous Simeon of the Gospels: &#x27;Lord, now let your servant depart in peace&#x27;&quot;.

The event in Alba Iulia attracted large crowds, which put the local lodging capacity under strain. After a long wait and repeated requests, Pop de Băsești and lieutenant Kiș were finally given an unheated room in the Hotel &quot;Hungaria&quot; (whose name was later changed to &quot;Dacia&quot;). They were later joined there by Pop de Băseşti&#x27;s son-in-law Francisc Hossu-Longin, who was the representative of Deva in the Great National Assembly.
On 1 December 1918, at Iuliu Maniu&#x27;s proposal, Pop de Băsești was elected president of the Assembly. As a leading figure of the PNR he unified all the divergent currents in the Assembly and bridged the differences, his election as president ending all rivalries among the representatives. In his opening speech he emphasized that the Great National Assembly of all Romanians of Transylvania and the Banat was destined to obliterate the bondage of the past, ending with the following words: &quot;Brethren, let yourselves be enthralled by the holy joy of this bright national feast and in the utmost brotherly harmony let us lay the foundation of our future happiness. God bless this assembly and its resolutions&quot;. On the same day the Assembly unanimously decreed the union between the Romanian Old Kingdom and Transylvania, the Banat, Crișana and Maramureș.

The next day the Assembly established the () as the provisional parliament of Transylvania, and the () as the provisional government of Transylvania, electing Gheorghe Pop de Băsești as president of the High Council and Iuliu Maniu as president of the Directory Council. After closing the session of the High National Romanian Council, Pop de Băsești repeated the words attributed to Simeon: &quot;Lord, now let your servant depart in peace&quot;, adding &quot;as I have seen the salvation of my people&quot;.

==Death==

After spending a couple of days at his daughter&#x27;s house in Deva and two night stops in Teiuș and Cluj (also not without incidents), on the way back from the Ulmeni railway station to his home in Băsești, on an icy weather, Pop de Băsești caught a severe cold that would confine him to bed. According to another source, his overnight stay in the unheated hotel room in Alba Iulia was another cause for him becoming ill. The prolonged illness caused his death a few months later on 23 February 1919, at the age of 83, after skirmishes of the initial stage of the Hungarian–Romanian War had been occurring in the neighboring villages of Stremț/Bükktótfalu and Odești/Vadafalva.

Pop de Băsești was buried in his native village while the funeral procession was fired upon by Hungarian troops. His epitaph reads: &quot;Lord, now let your servant depart in peace&quot;, the words he uttered at Alba Iulia. Pop de Băsești&#x27;s birthplace is now home to a .

<doc id="1294109" wikidata="Q2038241" url="?curid=1294109" title="Otto Berman">
<text>Otto Biederman, known as Otto &quot;Abbadabba&quot; Berman (August 10, 1891 – October 24, 1935) was an accountant for American organized crime. He is known for having coined the phrase &quot;Nothing personal, it&#x27;s just business.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Berman was born in a Jewish family in New York City. At age fifteen, he was arrested and tried for attempted rape but was found not guilty. He later became an accountant, well known for his ability to figure complex mathematical equations and algebraic expressions in a matter of seconds, without the use of paper or pen. He met and befriended writer Damon Runyon. Runyon based his recurring character Regret on Berman, portrayed by character actor Lynne Overman in the movie version of Runyon&#x27;s story, &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot;.

===1930s===
In the 1930s Berman became the accountant for, and advisor to, gangster Dutch Schultz. Berman was the handicapper for Cincinnati&#x27;s Coney Island track in 1935, prior to his death. A Coney Island badge was located in his pocket. Locals identified him with the nickname &quot;Abba Dabba&quot;.

===Death===
On October 23, 1935, Berman was having a meeting at the Palace Chophouse tavern in Newark, New Jersey, with Schultz and gunmen Abe Landau and Bernard &quot;Lulu&quot; Rosenkrantz when assassins hired by Lucky Luciano burst into the room. Berman was hit by several bullets as well as buckshot from a 12-gauge shotgun. He was the first of the four men to die, at 2:20 the next morning.

A photo of his bullet-riddled body appeared alongside a photo of Schultz undergoing surgery in the next morning&#x27;s newspaper, under the headline, &quot;Schultz, Five Pals Shot&quot;. In fact, only four others were shot: Berman, Landau, Rosenkrantz, and Marty Krompier, one of Schultz&#x27;s lieutenants. The accompanying article claimed that Berman was a gunman for Schultz. An angry Damon Runyon quickly submitted an editorial to the newspaper, defending Berman.

Berman is buried next to his parents in Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens.

==In popular culture==
In the novel &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot;, Berman appears as the mentor to the main character.

Berman is played by Allen Garfield in &quot;The Cotton Club&quot; and by Steven Hill in &quot;Billy Bathgate.&quot;

<text>Roger Charles Carmel (September 27, 1932 – November 11, 1986) was an American actor. He originated several roles on Broadway, played scores of guest roles in television series, was a lead in the sitcom &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot; and appeared in motion pictures. He is most famous for his two appearances as the conniving Harry Mudd in &quot;Star Trek&quot;.

==Career==
Carmel worked on Broadway from the late 1950s into the mid-1960s. He played multiple parts in &quot;The Power and the Glory&quot; (1958). He originated the roles of the 3rd Poet in &quot;Caligula&quot; (1960), Pasha in &quot;Once There Was a Russian&quot; (1961), The Deputy in &quot;Purlie Victorious&quot; (1961), and Mr. Andrikos in &quot;The Irregular Verb to Love&quot; (1963). He replaced Jack Creley in the role of Cardinal Wolsey in &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; (in 1962) and also replaced James Grout in &quot;Half a Sixpence&quot; (in 1966).

On television Carmel starred as the henpecked husband Roger Buell in the 1967 first season of the NBC sitcom &quot;The Mothers-in-Law&quot;, but was replaced by Richard Deacon in season two. When the first season ended, creator and producer Desi Arnaz told the entire cast that the show had a five-year guarantee but there was no money to give the contractual raises for the second season. While the other cast members agreed to forgo their salary increases, Carmel refused to forgo his. Carmel believed that Arnaz was illegally taking four salaries from the series—producer, creator, writer, and director—and this led him to quit the show (incidentally, the series was canceled the following year).

Carmel&#x27;s television guest roles included the accountant Doug Wesley on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and Colonel Gumm on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot;. He played the flamboyant and hapless galactic criminal Harcourt Fenton &quot;Harry&quot; Mudd in two episodes of the original series of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Women&quot; (1966) and &quot;I, Mudd&quot; (1967), and one episode of &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot;, &quot;Mudd&#x27;s Passion&quot; (1973). He also appeared in roles on &quot;The Patty Duke Show&quot;; &quot;I Spy&quot;; &quot;Blue Light&quot;; &quot;The Everglades&quot;; &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot;; &quot;Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;; &quot;Banacek&quot;; &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;; &quot;The Munsters&quot;; &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot;; &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;; &quot;The High Chaparral&quot;; &quot;McMillan &amp; Wife&quot;; &quot;All in the Family&quot;, and &quot;The San Pedro Beach Bums&quot;. He was a regular contestant on &quot;Pantomime Quiz&quot;, also known as &quot;Stump the Stars&quot;. His film roles included &quot;Gambit&quot;, &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot;, &quot;Breezy&quot;, &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;, and Jerry Lewis&#x27;s comeback film &quot;Hardly Working&quot; (1981).

==Later life and death==
Later in his career, Carmel was a frequent voice actor. He voiced Smokey Bear in fire safety advertisements and Decepticon deputy leader Cyclonus in the third season of the &quot;Transformers&quot; animated series (having originated the role in 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; and voicing other characters in the series&#x27; second season). In the television commercials for the Naugles chain of Mexican fast-food restaurants, he played the character of Señor Naugles.

Carmel was found dead in his Hollywood apartment on November 11, 1986. His death certificate listed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy as the cause. Prior to his autopsy, police had speculated a &quot;narcotics overdose.&quot; He was interred in New Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale, Queens, New York City. His plot is in the section dedicated to his parents&#x27; synagogue, Temple Beth Emeth.

<text>Glass Slippers () is a 40-episode South Korean drama series that aired on SBS in 2002, starring Kim Hyun-joo and Kim Ji-ho as two orphaned sisters.

==Plot==
6-year-old Yoon-hee and her elder sister, Tae-hee, were raised by their widowed father after their mother died giving birth to Yoon-hee. Following years of struggles, their father — who was already suffering from cancer — is killed in a car accident, leaving the girls with no choice but to find their rich paternal grandfather, who lost touch with them due to his disapproval of their mother. At the train station, they are robbed by a group of gangsters. While chasing them, Tae-hee does not notice that Yoon-hee, who is following her, gets knocked unconscious by the Oh family&#x27;s truck. Tae-hee gets beaten by the gangsters and is helped by a boy named Jae-hyuk, who stays with her until they both find her grandfather. They look for Yoon-hee in despair, unaware that she has lost her memories after regaining consciousness, and has moved away with the Ohs. Based on the name carved on her mother&#x27;s ring, Yoon-hee assumes that her name is Sun-woo, and uses it as her identity.

15 years later, Tae-hee works at her grandfather&#x27;s company, and is romantically involved with her childhood crush and co-worker, Jae-hyuk (unbeknownst to Tae-hee, this is Jae-hyuk&#x27;s revenge plan for her grandfather, who had indirectly caused his grandfather&#x27;s death years ago). In contrast, Sun-woo grows up in the Oh family and often gets abused (especially by Seung-hee). She almost gets raped by Seung-hee&#x27;s stepfather, and thus gets kicked out of the house by his wife. Seung-hee&#x27;s crush, Chul-woong, desires Sun-woo, so he lets her take refuge at his home. Tae-hee, not giving up on finding her sister, tracks down the Oh&#x27;s address and confronts Seung-hee upon seeing her wearing Sun-woo&#x27;s ring. Quickly learning that Sun-woo is Tae-hee&#x27;s long-lost sister, Seung-hee (out of jealousy and greed) pretends to be Yoon-hee, and moves in with the Kim&#x27;s family. Tae-hee seems happy while her grandfather remains suspicious of Seung-hee. He overhears Seung-hee&#x27;s phone conversation with her mother, and right away exposes her deceptive plan. However, Seung-hee lies that the real Yoon-hee&#x27;s fate is unknown, not saying a word about Sun-woo. He is devastated and thus decides to keep the truth from Tae-hee.

Coincidentally, Sun-woo gets a job in her grandfather&#x27;s company and frequently interacts with Tae-hee and her grandfather. They are fond of Sun-woo until Jae-hyuk becomes so in love with her, which breaks Tae-hee&#x27;s heart. He aborts his revenge plan in order to run away with Sun-woo, but the grandfather soon finds out, and sends him to prison for a few days before Tae-hee bails him out. Unable to forgive Tae-hee&#x27;s grandfather, Jae-hyuk ends his relationship with Sun-woo and becomes engaged to Tae-hee. Sun-woo moves out on her own and subsequently becomes ill. She is diagnosed with leukemia, which can be cured only if her sibling or relative donates suitable bone marrow. As Sun-woo cannot remember any of them, she is ready to give up and spend her remaining time with Chul-woong. In the meantime, Tae-hee&#x27;s grandfather assigns his chauffeur, who is Chul-woong&#x27;s father, to find his real granddaughter. Being told the truth by Seung-hee&#x27;s stepfather, Chul-woong&#x27;s father informs him that his missing granddaughter is indeed Sun-woo, who recently got fired by him for the sake of Tae-hee and Jae-hyuk. In shock and regret, he rushes to see Sun-woo before a car accident kills him, and puts Chul-woong&#x27;s father in a coma. Seung-hee bribes her stepfather to keep Sun-woo&#x27;s identity a secret, which makes him (and his wife) feel bad for Sun-woo. Jae-hyuk, who has never stopped loving Sun-woo, secretly covers her hospital bills while looking for evidence to expose Seung-hee. By chance, he meets Seung-hee&#x27;s stepfather and the truth about her is revealed, which he tells Tae-hee about right away. At this point, Sun-woo dreams about her father and her family&#x27;s past moments. She wakes up as soon as Tae-hee arrives, and the sisters share a long hug upon reunion. After she kicks Seung-hee out of the house, Tae-hee donates her bone marrow for surgery to save Sun-woo. Sun-woo forgives the Ohs, but Seung-hee still holds a grudge against her.

Sun-woo recovers well from the surgery. Jae-hyuk maintains a good relationship with Tae-hee, while trying to get back with Sun-woo. Understanding her sister&#x27;s feelings, Sun-woo rejects Jae-hyuk and accepts Chul-woong&#x27;s marriage proposal. Before their wedding, Seung-hee orders a gang to kidnap Sun-woo. In order to protect her, Chul-woong fights against them and gets stabbed, thus dying in Sun-woo&#x27;s arms and tears. Seung-hee is put to prison and still blames Sun-woo for having stolen her entire life from her. As Jae-hyuk prepares to take a flight to the U.S., Sun-woo suddenly shows up at the airport and they share a brief farewell moment. Sun-woo and Tae-hee return to the house where they lived as children.

<text>The American Manual Alphabet (AMA) is a manual alphabet that augments the vocabulary of American Sign Language.

==Letters and digits==
The letters and digits are signed as follows. In informal contexts, the handshapes are not made as distinctly as they are in formal contexts.
The manual alphabet can be used on either hand, normally the signer&#x27;s dominant hand – that is, the right hand for right-handers, the left hand for left-handers. Most frequently, the manual alphabet is signed just below the dominant shoulder of the signer. When used within other signs or in a context in which this is not plausible, this general rule can be disregarded.

J and Z involve motion. J is I with a twist of the wrist, so that the little finger traces the curve of the printed form of the letter; Z is an index finger moved back and forth, so that the finger traces the zig-zag shape of the letter Z. Both of these &quot;tracings&quot; are made as seen by the signer if right-handed, as shown by the illustrations in this article. When signed with the left hand, the motions are in mirror image, therefore unreversed for the viewer. However, fluent signers do not need to &quot;read&quot; the shapes of these movements.

In most drawings or illustrations of the American Manual Alphabet, some of the letters are depicted from the side to better illustrate the desired hand shape. For example, the letters &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are frequently shown from the side to illustrate the position of the fingers. However, they are signed with the hand in an ergonomically neutral position, palm facing to the side and fingers pointing forward.

Several letters have the same hand shape, and are distinguished by orientation. These are &quot;h&quot; and &quot;u&quot;, &quot;k&quot; and &quot;p&quot; (thumb on the middle finger), &quot;g&quot; and &quot;q&quot; and, in informal contexts, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;g/q&quot;. In rapid signing, &quot;n&quot; is distinguished from &quot;h/u&quot; by orientation. The letters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;s&quot; have the same orientation, and are very similar in form. The thumb is on the side of the fist in the letter &quot;a&quot;, and in front for &quot;s&quot;. When used within fingerspelled English words, letters of the manual alphabet may be oriented differently than if they were to stand alone. 

==Rhythm, speed and movement==
When fingerspelling, the hand is at shoulder height; it does not bounce with each letter. A double letter within a word is signed in different ways, through a bounce of the hand, a slide of the hand, or repeating the sign of a letter. Letters are signed at a constant speed; a pause functions as a word divider. The first letter may be held for the length of a letter extra as a cue that the signer is about to start fingerspelling.

== Uses ==
Fingerspelling is typically only used in a specific set of circumstances, primarily for proper names (including personal, brand, and place names) and other words that do not have a conventional sign, usually borrowed words from English or other languages. In other instances, fingerspelling is used sparingly.

== Changes and variations in the manual alphabet ==
Like other languages, American Sign Language is constantly evolving. While changes in fingerspelling are less likely, slight changes still occur over time. The manual alphabet looks different today than it did merely decades ago. A prime example of this pattern of change is found in the &quot;screaming &#x27;E&#x27;&quot;. Older generations of deaf individuals still insist that the &quot;E&quot; handshape requires that the thumb make contact with the tips of the index and middle fingers. Meanwhile, younger generations are beginning to produce a handshape that separates the thumb from the other fingers on the lower end of the palm.

== English and the manual alphabet ==
Since fingerspelling was originally developed in order to incorporate the English language into sign language, it is very closely linked to English. Studies have shown that deaf individuals process reading and fingerspelling similarly. As a result, fingerspelling has had a profound impact on the literacy of deaf and hard of hearing children. This conclusion is widely accepted, but the debate lies in which methods of teaching best utilize this relationship.

== ASL and phonetics ==
Phonetics does not have to be constricted to just speech but it can also be used when signing to others. When signing, the person&#x27;s expressions could greatly determine the outcome of what they are trying to communicate to the other person. For example, if the signer was trying to sign that they were mad, they would use facial expressions and body language to really determine how they were feeling. Although spoken language also uses these forms of expression, they are not relied on as heavily as Sign Language. The phonetics of verbal speech and sign language are similar because spoken dialect uses tone of voice to determine someone&#x27;s mood and Sign Language uses facial expressions to determine someone&#x27;s mood as well. Phonetics does not necessarily only relate to spoken language but it can also be used in American Sign Language (ASL) as well. When signing in ASL, people will not sign words the same way they are spoken either. The relationship between spoken dialect and ASL varies because there is association between certain signs and their words and they are signed differently because ASL is not signed the same way it is spoken.

<doc id="1294202" wikidata="Q2394901" url="?curid=1294202" title="Philippe de Chérisey">
<text>Philippe Louis Henri Marie de Chérisey, 9th marquess de Chérisey (13 February 1923 – 17 July 1985) was a French writer, radio humorist, surrealist and supporting actor (using the stage name Amédée).

He is best known for his creation of fake parchments published in the 1967 book &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; by Gérard de Sède, as part of his involvement in the Priory of Sion hoax between 1962-1983.

==Early life==
Coming from a wealthy family in the Lorraine, de Chérisey decided to become an actor against his family&#x27;s wishes. He enrolled in the René Simon drama school in 1946 where he started his actor&#x27;s training, and his most notable film appearance was in &quot;Jeux interdits&quot; in 1952. He was known as a bon viveur, regularly enjoyed wine and frequented public libraries where his natural curiosity made him follow up anything that took his fancy.

==Surrealism==
Philippe de Chérisey was a follower of the surrealist movement. He claimed acquaintance with Eugene Ionesco and was like him a member of the College of Pataphysics, although - like his membership of Oulipo - there is no evidence that he was actively involved. His desire to subvert the norms of culture, or in other words, create an alternate reality that became more real than reality itself, was done within the context of the Priory of Sion and to promote the claim that Pierre Plantard was the direct descendant of Dagobert II. He considered himself a satirist from his days in French radio, and continued this persona within the theme of the Priory of Sion calling himself a prankster. The best known example of this is his esoteric novella &quot;Circuit&quot; (originally written in 1968, but not actually deposited within the Bibliothèque nationale de France until 1971).

==Rennes-le-Château==
By the early 1960s Philippe de Chérisey met Pierre Plantard, and together they developed an interest in Rennes-le-Château. From the mid-1950s local hotelier Noël Corbu circulated a story to boost trade, that the 19th century priest Bérenger Saunière of Rennes-le-Château had discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile. The author Robert Charroux published Corbu&#x27;s story in his 1962 book &quot;Trésors du Monde&quot;. In a letter dated 2 April 1965 to his girlfriend, de Chérisey wrote: &quot;Don&#x27;t tell anyone, but I&#x27;ll be setting out again for four days in the Pyrenees with Plantard to see if we can get any closer to Mary Magdalene.&quot; A mixture of de Chérisey&#x27;s humor and surrealism can be identified within his activities relating to the Priory of Sion hoax, Gisors and Rennes-le-Château, contained in his correspondence as well as in his documents that he deposited in the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris.

===Parchments===
During the early 1960s, de Chérisey forged two parchments, photocopies of which appeared in the 1967 book &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; by Gérard de Sède. De Sède&#x27;s book adapted Corbu&#x27;s story to fit-in with Plantard&#x27;s claims about the Priory of Sion. The parchments hinted at the survival of the line of the Frankish king Dagobert II, that Plantard claimed to be descended from, as well as attempting to verify the existence of the 1000-year-old secret society, the Priory of Sion. The two parchments were later used as source material for the 1982 book &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot;, which was itself used as a primary source for the 2003 bestselling novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. Other documents, containing fake genealogies, were planted in the French National Library, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.

Pierre Plantard and Gérard de Sède fell out over book royalties when &quot;L&#x27;Or de Rennes&quot; was published in 1967, at the same time Philippe de Chérisey announced that he had forged the parchments. De Chérisey elaborated about this in his 1978 unpublished document &quot;L&#x27;Énigme de Rennes&quot;, claiming they were originally made for his friend Francis Blanche, as material for a French radio serial entitled &quot;Signé Furax&quot;. A second document by de Chérisey entitled &quot;Pierre et papier&quot; (&quot;Stone and Paper&quot;) provides a more detailed explanation, giving the more complicated decoding technique to one of the parchments by using a Knight&#x27;s Tour 25-letter alphabet, omitting the letter &quot;w&quot;, which can only be known to the forger. An English translation of this document, together with a reproduction of the original, was published by Jean-Luc Chaumeil in 2010.

===Details of the forgeries===
The text of parchment I was copied from &quot;Codex Bezae&quot;, an Old Latin/Greek diglot from the 5th century CE contained in the book by Fulcran Grégoire Vigouroux, &quot;Dictionnaire De La Bible&quot; (1895). Philippe de Chérisey&#x27;s reason for copying the passage from the Codex Bezae was his interest in the phrase &quot;In Sabbato Secundo Primo&quot;, also found in the Gospel of Luke 6:1. Philippe de Chérisey stated: &quot;This phrase has given headaches to the anonymous (secret) societies. It has to be said that &#x27;A day of Sabbath, second first&#x27; is not really translatable. No one has ever heard of that. So, as the disciples walk through a cornfield and, being hungry, eat the corn, there and then, it must mean &#x27;Second Sabbath following the first day of the shewbread.&#x27; This is the only interpretation we could find.&quot; De Chérisey went on to provide his own interpretation: &quot;In Sabbato Secundo Primo does not mean &#x27;A day of Sabbath, second first&#x27; but rather &#x27;As second in command, Sabassius became first.&#x27; What is interesting is that the witches&#x27; meetings are called &#x27;Sabbaths&#x27;, not because of the Jewish celebrations, but because of Sabassius, god of the Phrygians&quot;.

This parchment also contained an encrypted message written in modern French: &quot;À Dagobert II Roi et à Sion est ce trésor et il est là mort.&quot; (translated as &quot;To King Dagobert II and to Sion does this treasure belong, and he is there, dead&quot;).

De Chérisey also chose to copy material from Vigouroux because he was a priest connected with the Church of St Sulpice, a location that had been exploited as part of the Priory of Sion myths as created by Plantard and de Chérisey, so de Chérisey&#x27;s utilisation of this priest fitted in nicely into these myths.

According to an investigation into the Priory of Sion hoax by the American news program 60 Minutes, parchment II was copied from a 19th-century version of the Latin Vulgate published by John Wordsworth and Henry J. White &quot;Novum Testamentum Domini Nostri Iesu Christi latine secundum sancti Hieronymi&quot; (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1889–1954), and the original forged parchments are now in the possession of Jean-Luc Chaumeil, a French writer, who states that he had their age analyzed, and it was confirmed that they were merely decades old, not centuries. Chaumeil also has letters by de Chérisey, which contain proof that De Chérisey was knowingly engaging in a fraud.

That Philippe de Chérisey was not a specialist of Latin paleography and had even a bit lost his Latin knowledge (got from high school) is demonstrated in his copying of the Latin Text from the Codex Bezae for one of his parchments: for instance, he made several of the most basic errors in copying the Latin uncials, which therefore garbles the spelling of multiple words. This information is frequently omitted by those who present the parchments as being authentic.

In an interview during the 1970s with author Jean-Luc Chaumeil, Philippe de Chérisey asserted: &quot;the parchments of the Gospel according to Saint Luke fabricated by me and for which I pinched the uncial text from the work &quot;L&#x27;archéologie chrétienne&quot; (&quot;Christian Archaeology&quot;) by Dom Cabrol at the National Library, section C25&quot;.

Philippe de Chérisey asserted in a letter dated 29 January 1974 to French author Pierre Jarnac: &quot;P.S. Do you know that the famous manuscripts supposedly discovered by the Abbé Saunière were composed in 1965? And that I took responsibility for being the author?&quot;

According to Henry Lincoln, one of the co-authors of &quot;Holy Blood Holy Grail&quot;, Plantard admitted to him in person that the various documents had been forged, and identified de Chérisey as their creator.

===Relationship with Plantard===
A schism developed between Pierre Plantard and Philippe de Chérisey in 1983, when de Chérisey began collaborating with Paul Rouelle (his dentist) on a book which would have incorporated the Priory of Sion concepts.

French author Pierre Jarnac reproduced part of a letter he received dated 22 May 1985 from Pierre Plantard: &quot;You need to know only that I have no involvement whatsoever with the &#x27;deathless prose&#x27; of Monsieur Philippe de Chérisey, who was the co-author with Monsieur Paul Rouelle of the book COURT-CIRCUIT, lodged with the BN in December 1984 or January 1985, which dragged my name through the mud. The Marquis de Chérisey was a good friend of mine from university days, but I very often disapprove of his books which are really quite bizarre.&quot;

==Later years==
Philippe de Chérisey died in Paris on 17 July 1985, while working to finish an encyclopedia of trema. His funeral was held at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Paris and he was buried in the family vault at Rœux (Pas-de-Calais). His former wife Phyllis Phillips died in 1987.

His death was announced by Gino Sandri in number 10 of &quot;Etudes Mérovingiennes&quot; (August 1985), the journal of the association &quot;Cercle Saint Dagobert II&quot;.

<text>Creodonta (&quot;meat teeth&quot;) is a former order of extinct carnivorous placental mammals that lived from the early Paleocene to the late Miocene epochs in North America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Originally thought to be a single group of animals ancestral to the modern Carnivora, this order is now usually considered a polyphyletic assemblage of two different groups, the oxyaenids and the hyaenodonts, not a natural group. Oxyaenids are first known from the Palaeocene of North America, while hyaenodonts hail from the Palaeocene of Africa.

Creodonts were the dominant carnivorous mammals from , peaking in diversity and prevalence during the Eocene. The first large, obviously carnivorous mammals appeared with the radiation of the oxyaenids in the late Paleocene. During the Paleogene, &quot;creodont&quot; species were the most abundant terrestrial carnivores in the Old World. In Oligocene Africa, hyaenodonts were the dominant group of large flesh-eaters, persisting until the middle of the Miocene.

&quot;Creodont&quot; groups had an extensive range, both geographically and temporally. They are known from the late Paleocene through the late Oligocene in North America, the early Eocene through late Oligocene in Europe, from the late Paleocene through late Miocene in Asia, and from the late Paleocene to the late Miocene in Africa. While most were small-to-medium sized mammals, among their number was &quot;Sarkastodon&quot;, one of the largest mammalian land predators of all time, weighing an estimated 800 kg.

Though often assumed to have been outcompeted by carnivorans, there is little empirical support for this. The last genus, &quot;Dissopsalis&quot;, became extinct about .

Most modern paleontologists agree both &quot;creodont&quot; families are related to Carnivora, but are not their direct ancestors. It is still unclear how closely the two families are related to each other. In general, classification is complicated by the fact that relationships among fossil mammals are usually decided by similarities in the teeth, but the teeth of hypercarnivorous species may evolve similar shapes through convergent evolution, to deal with the mechanics of eating meat.

&quot;Creodonts&quot; share with the Carnivora, and many other predatory mammal clades, the &quot;carnassial shear&quot;, a scissors-like modification of upper and lower cheek teeth that was used to slice muscle tissue. This adaptation is also seen in other clades of predatory mammals.

==Systematics and history==
&quot;Creodonta&quot; was coined by Edward Drinker Cope in 1875. Cope included the oxyaenids and the viverravid &quot;Didymictis&quot; but omitted the Hyaenodontidae. In 1880. he expanded the term to include families Miacidae (including Viverravidae), Arctocyonidae, Leptictidae (now Pseudorhyncocyonidae), Oxyaenidae, Ambloctonidae and Mesonychidae. Cope originally placed creodonts within the Insectivora. In 1884, however, he regarded them as a basal group from which both carnivorans and insectivorans arose.

Hyaenodontidae was not included among the creodonts until 1909. William Diller Matthew regarded Creodonta as a suborder of order Carnivora, divided in three groups:
* &quot;Inadaptive Creodonta&quot; (Creodonta inadaptiva), group that includes &quot;Pseudocreodi&quot; (oxyaenids and hyaenodontids) and the mesonychids,
* &quot;Adaptive Creodonta&quot; (Creodonta adaptiva), made up of the miacids and the taxa included in the wastebasket &quot;Arctocyonidae&quot;,
* and &quot;Primitive Creodonta&quot; (Creodonta primitiva), made up of Oxyclaenidae.

Over time, various groups and species were removed from this order. It stabilized in the mid-20th century as representing oxyaenids, hyaenodonts, mesonychids, and arctocyonids, which were understood as the major groups of flesh-eating placental mammals that were not members of the Carnivora. It became increasingly clear that arctocyonids were a wastebasket taxon and mesonychids might be more closely related to ungulates. By 1969, Creodonta contained only the oxyaenids and the hyaenodontids.

More recently, &quot;Creodonta&quot; had been considered to be a nonvalid polyphyletic assemblage of carnivorous placental mammals (and not a natural group), and members of Creodonta being sister taxa to Carnivoramorpha (carnivorans and their stem-relatives) within clade Pan-Carnivora (in mirorder Ferae), split in two groups: order Oxyaenodonta as one group and order Hyaenodonta plus its stem-relatives (family Wyolestidae and genera &quot;Altacreodus&quot;, &quot;Simidectes&quot; and &quot;Tinerhodon&quot;) in the other. However, some phylogenetic analysis recover them as a natural group, such as a phylogenetic analysis of Paleocene mammals published in 2015 that supported the monophyly of Creodonta, and placed the group as relatives of clade Pholidotamorpha (pangolins and their stem-relatives).

Polly has argued that the only available synapomorphy between oxyaenids and hyaenodontids is a large metastylar blade on the first molar (M1), but he believes that that feature is common for all basal eutheria. Separating Oxyaenidae from Hyaenodontidae would also comport with biogeographic evidence, since the first oxyaenid is known from the North American early Paleocene and the first hyaenodontids are from very late Paleocene of North Africa.

Complicating this arrangement is the tentative endorsement by Gunnell of the erection of a third family, Limnocyonidae. The group includes taxa that were once considered oxyaenids, such as &quot;Limnocyon&quot;, &quot;Thinocyon&quot; and &quot;Prolimnocyon&quot;. Wortman had even erected a subfamily of Limnocyoninae within the oxyaenids. Van Valen nests the same subfamily (including &quot;Oxyaenodon&quot;) within Hyaenodontidae. Gunnell is agnostic whether Limnocyonidae is a group within Hyaenodontidae (although a sister group to the rest of hyaenodontids) or entirely separate.

According to Gunnell, the defining features of the oxyaenids include: A small braincase low in the skull. The occiput wide at base and narrowing dorsally (to give it a triangular shape). The lacrimal bone makes a semicircular expansion on the face. The mandibles have heavy symphysis. M1 and m2 form the carnassials, while M3/m3 are absent. The manus and pes are plantigrade or subplantigrade. The fibula articulates with the calcaneum, and the astragalus articulates with the cuboid bone. The phalanges are compressed and fissured at the tip.

Likewise, Gunnell&#x27;s list of defining features of hyaenodontids includes: Long, narrow skull with a narrow basicranium and a high narrow occiput. The frontal bones are concave between the orbital regions. M2 and m3 form the carnassials. M3 is present in most species, while m3 is always present. Manus and pes range from plantigrade to digitigrade. The fibula articulates with the calcaneum, while the astragalar-cuboid articulation is reduced or absent. Terminal phalanges are compressed and fissured at the tip.

The limnocyonids had the following features according to Gunnell: M3/m3 were reduced or absent, other teeth were unreduced. The rostrum was elongated. The animals themselves were small to medium-sized.

==Morphology==
===Dentition===
Among primitive creodonts the dental formula is , but later forms often had reduced numbers of incisors, premolars and/or molars. The canines are always large and pointed. The lateral incisors are large, while the medial incisors are usually small. Premolars are primitive, with one primary cusp and various secondary cusps.

Creodonts have two or three pairs of carnassial teeth. One pair performed the largest cutting function (either M1/m2 or M2/m3). This arrangement is unlike modern carnivorans, which use P4 and m1 for carnassials. This difference suggests convergent evolution among meat-eaters, with a separate evolutionary history and an order-level distinction, given that different teeth evolved as the carnassials both between creodonts and carnivorans, and between oxyaenids and hyaenodonts. Carnassials are also known in other flesh-eating mammal clades, such as in the extinct bat &quot;Necromantis&quot;, as well as highly unrelated taxa such as the flesh-eating marsupial &quot;Thylacoleo&quot;.

Different molars were involved in the two major groups of creodonts. In the Oxyaenidae, M1 and m2 that form the carnassials. Among the hyaenodontids, it is M2 and m3. Unlike most modern carnivorans, in which the carnassials are the sole shearing teeth, other creodont molars have a subordinate shearing functions. The difference in which teeth form the carnassials is a major argument for the polyphyly of Creodonta.

===Cranium===
Creodonts had long, narrow skulls with small brains. The skull narrowed considerably behind the eyes, producing a distinct splanchnocranium and neurocranium segments of the cranium. They had large sagittal crests and usually broad mastoids (which were probably derived features for the group). Many creodonts had proportionately large heads. In primitive forms, the auditory bullae was not ossified. Generally the temporal fossae were very broad.

===Postcranial skeleton===
Creodonts had generalized postcranial skeletons. Their limbs were mesaxonic (with the axis of the foot provided by the middle of their five digits). Their method of locomotion ranged from plantigrade to digitigrade. The terminal phalanges were fused claws.
===Size===
Creodonts ranged in size from the size of a small cat to the &quot;Sarkastodon&quot;. The larger animals, however, were not known until late in the Paleocene with the radiation of the oxyaenids, such as the puma-sized &quot;Dipsalidictis&quot; and the probably bone-crushing scavenger &quot;Dipsalodon&quot;.

Certain creodonts (&quot;Arfia&quot;, &quot;Prolimnocyon&quot; and &quot;Palaeonictis&quot;) seem to have experienced the dwarfing phenomenon during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum seen in other mammal genera. A proposed explanation for this phenomenon is that the increased carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere directly affected carnivores through increased temperature and aridity and also indirectly affected them by reducing the size of their herbivorous prey through the same selective pressures.

The largest North American creodont is &quot;Patriofelis&quot;. A specimen of &quot;P. ferox&quot; collected in the Bridger Basin of southern Wyoming was the size of a full-grown black bear with a head almost the size of an adult male lion.

During the Central Asia Expedition of 1930 by the American Museum of Natural History, the largest creodont ever discovered was collected: &quot;Sarkastodon mongoliensis&quot;. Its dimensions were described as 50% greater than the &quot;Patriofelis&quot; to which it bore many similarities. It has been estimated that &quot;Sarkastodon&quot; attained the body mass of twice the largest American lion.

==Biology==
===Diet and feeding===
Early creodonts (both oxyaenids and hyaenodontids) displayed the tribosphenic molars common for basal therians. Small forms had somewhat strong postmetacrista-metastellar crests suggesting that they were probably opportunistic feeders, eating such things as eggs, birds, small mammals, insects and possibly plant matter as well, possibly like extant viverrids. Larger forms had greater shearing capacity and the capacity increased over time. &quot;Arfia&quot;, one of the most common carnivorous mammals in early Eocene North America, developed a more open trigonid on M3 over the course of the Early Eocene, increasing the shearing ability of the carnassials. A similar development can be seen by comparing &quot;Oxyaena&quot;, &quot;Prototomus&quot; and &quot;Limnocyon&quot; with the smaller, more generalized feeders among the creodonts.

==Extinction==

Several theories have suggested that hyaenodonts and oxyaenids became extinct because they were outcompeted by the newly-evolved Carnivora. However, there is no direct evidence that the existence of large Carnivora caused the extinction of these taxa, and in many cases (in Africa throughout the Early and Middle Miocene, and in North America and Eurasia during much of the Oligocene), hyaenodonts thrived in environments in which large carnivorans such as nimravids and (later) larger amphicyonids were also present as competitors. Theories that suggest they were outcompeted by the Carnivora include that their smaller brains limited their intelligence, but carnivoran brain sizes have not always been consistently large throughout their evolution, and the importance of brain size as a factor in intelligence has been vastly overestimated in the past when these ideas were published. Other speculations focus on their limb structure, which limited leg movement to a vertical plane, as in ungulates; they were unable to turn their wrists and forearms inward to trip, slash, or grab prey as some modern carnivores can. Creodonts had to depend entirely on their jaws to capture prey, which may be why creodonts generally had a larger head size in relation to their bodies than carnivores of similar stature. However, many carnivorans, such as large canids, are also dependent on their jaws alone to capture prey yet do so effectively even in situations where they must tackle large prey alone, so this also fails to provide a satisfactory explanation.
In the Carnivora, the last upper premolar and the first lower molar are the carnassials, allowing the rearmost molar teeth to evolve adaptations for feeding on non-meat foods. In creodonts, either the first upper and second lower molars, or the second upper and third lower molars, were the primary carnassials, and the rear teeth formed a carnassial series. This structure committed them to eating meat almost exclusively, which may have limited their ability to exploit mesocarnivore and omnivore ecological niches. These differences may have caused environmental changes to affect hyaenodonts and oxyaenids differently than they did many carnivorans, as the former would have been restricted to largely or entirely faunivorous diets, while many (though not all) carnivoran lineages were/are able to subsist on plant matter as well.

A study conducted on creodont and carnivoran dietary niches in the Cypress Hills Formation showed that only the smallest creodont in the faunal assemblage had any significant dietary overlap with carnivorans and that the niches of the other creodonts were extremely distinct from those of the carnivorans they lived alongside, with the study concluding that it was highly unlikely that the extinction of creodonts in North America can be attributed to competition with carnivorans.

<text>The North British Locomotive Company (NBL, NB Loco or North British) was created in 1903 through the merger of three Glasgow locomotive manufacturing companies; Sharp, Stewart and Company (Atlas Works), Neilson, Reid and Company (Hyde Park Works) and Dübs and Company (Queens Park Works), creating the largest locomotive manufacturing company in Europe and the British Empire and the second largest in the world after the Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States.

Its main factories were located at the neighbouring Atlas and Hyde Park Works in central Springburn, as well as the Queens Park Works in Polmadie. A new central Administration and Drawing Office for the combined company was completed across the road from the Hyde Park Works on Flemington Street by James Miller in 1909, later sold to Glasgow Corporation in 1961 to become the main campus of North Glasgow College (now Glasgow Kelvin College).

The two other Railway works in Springburn were St. Rollox railway works, owned by the Caledonian Railway and Cowlairs railway works, owned by the North British Railway. Latterly both works were operated by British Rail Engineering Limited after rail nationalisation in 1948.

In 1918, NBL produced the first prototype of the Anglo-American Mark VIII battlefield tank for the Allied armies, but with the Armistice it did not go into production.

==Steam locomotives==

NBL built steam locomotives for countries all over the world. This included North America (Canada, Mexico, Newfoundland), South America (Argentina, Chile, Paraguay), Europe (France, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey), Sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Gold Coast (now Ghana), Kenya/Uganda/Tanzania, Malawi, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), South Africa); Middle East (Egypt, Palestine), Asia (India, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), China, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines); and Australasia (Australia, New Zealand).

The New South Wales Government Railways purchased numerous North British locomotives, as did the Victorian Railways as late as 1951 (Oberg, &quot;Locomotives of Australia&quot;). the Western Australian Government Railways also purchased many North British Locomotives, such as the P class. Also the South Australian Railway purchased 15 South Australian Railways R class locos and are known in South Australia as the most versatile South Australian Railway steam locomotive, also the South Australian Railway purchased 10 North British built Victorian Railways N class locos and reclassified them as the South Australian Railways 750 class

Between 1903 and 1959, NBL supplied many locomotives of various classes to Egyptian State Railways. They included 40 of the 545 class 2-6-0 in 1928.

Between 1921 and 1925, NBL supplied New Zealand Government Railways with 85 NZR AB class locomotives. The whole fleet of AB class engines numbered 143, as built, of which 141 entered service. Two were lost at sea (see below).

In 1935, NBL supplied six Palestine Railways P class 4-6-0 locomotives to haul main line trains between Haifa and the Suez Canal.

In 1939, NBL supplied 40 4-8-2 locomotives to the New Zealand Railways Department (NZR J class); some of which were later converted to JB class oilburners. In 1951 NBL supplied another 16 JA class, though these did not have the American-style streamlining of the J class. Together with its predecessor firms, North British supplied about a quarter of the steam locomotives used by the NZR.

In 1949, South African Railways bought more than 100 2-8-4 locomotives from NBL and these became the Class 24; some operated tourist trains on the George-Knysna line until 2000. Additionally South Africa also purchased some of its Class 25, 4-8-4 engines from the company between 1953 and 1955. These successful engines with various in-service modifications survived until the end of steam in South Africa in 1992. NBL also introduced the Modified Fairlie locomotive in 1924. In total South Africa purchased over 2,000 locomotives from the North British Locomotive Company.


As of January 2010, Umgeni Steam Railway operates SAR Class 3BR engine 1486, (NBL 19690 of 1912) and now named &quot;Maureen&quot;, on the line between Kloof and Inchanga, a distance of about . She hauls vintage sightseeing trains with some coaches of which date back to 1908.

In 1953, RENFE in Spain acquired 25 2-8-2 locomotives from the North British Locomotive Company. One example, 141F 2111 (Works No. 26975 of 1952) is preserved in working order.

Locomotives made for railways in Ireland included the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) (Q Class); Great Southern and Western Railway (211 class); Midland Great Western Railway (Class B) and Northern Counties Committee (Class U2).

Locomotives made for railways in Britain included the Barry Railway (Class F); Caledonian Railway (72, 113, 944, and 191 classes); Furness Railway (1, 3, 98, and 130 classes); Glasgow and South Western Railway (128 and 403 classes); Great Central Railway classes (8B/8J &amp; 8K); Great North of Scotland Railway (Class F); Great Northern Railway (Classes H3 and O2); Highland Railway (&quot;Loch&quot;, &quot;Ben&quot;, New &quot;Ben&quot;, &quot;Castle&quot;, K, and X classes); London and North Western Railway (&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; class); London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (51 and 69 classes); Maryport and Carlisle Railway, Midland and South Western Junction Railway, North British Railway (B, H, J, and L Classes); North Eastern Railway (Class Z); Taff Vale Railway (A class); War Department (ROD 2-8-0). After 1923, customers included the Great Western Railway (5700 class); London, Midland and Scottish Railway (Fowler 3F, Fowler 4F, 4P Compound, Stanier 2-cylinder 2-6-4T, &quot;Jubilee&quot;, &quot;Royal Scot&quot;, and Stanier 8F classes, and the experimental &quot;Fury&quot;); London and North Eastern Railway; (Classes A1, B17, K3, Thompson B1, and Thompson L1); Southern Railway (L1 and N15 &quot;King Arthur&quot; classes); War Department (Stanier 8F, WD Austerity 2-8-0 and WD Austerity 2-10-0 classes).

==Locomotives 22878, 22879 and 22880==

In 1922, the New Zealand Railways Department ordered a batch of its very successful AB class Pacifics from NBL, to be built and shipped as soon as possible. The trio 22878, 22879 and 22880 were built amidst this batch. 22878 and 22879 were loaded aboard and she sailed for Auckland, New Zealand, but she got into difficulty at Rosalie Bay, on the east coast of Great Barrier Island and sank. Remnants of both locomotives, and the &quot;Wiltshire&quot; can be seen on the sea floor.

22880 was dispatched on a subsequent sailing and was put into service in New Zealand as AB class number 745. This locomotive was in service for more than 30 years but then hit a washout near Hāwera. It was then left in the mud for nearly 50 years but has now been exhumed with the intention of restoration. It was moved to the nearby town of Stratford, New Zealand for preservation by Taranaki Flyer Society. Due to the TFS headquarters being sold from under them, 22880 was put on the market, and has been taken into storage by Rimutaka Incline Railway Heritage Trust, after the Taranaki Flyer Society was liquidated in December 2013.

==Diesel locomotives==

Whilst highly successful as designers and builders of steam locomotives for both its domestic market and abroad, North British failed to successfully manage the transition to diesel and electric locomotive production in the wake of the British Railways 1955 Modernisation Plan. It did build a Paxman engined diesel locomotive, British Rail 10800, originally ordered for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway before the 1948 nationalisation of British Railways, but not delivered until 1950. This was closely followed by eight Bo-Bo diesel-electric locomotives for the Ceylon Government Railway (CGR class G2).

Another Paxman engined locomotive was PVH1, built in 1953 as &#x27;Paxman Voith Hydraulic 1&#x27; (hence the identity) for the Emu Bay Railway, Tasmania, and survives today preserved at the Derwent Valley Railway (Tasmania). Its wheel formation is -D- being a hydraulic transmission locomotive, so in appearance it looks like an 0-8-0. It also built eight Paxman engined shunters British Rail Class D2/1.

In the late 1950s, North British signed a deal with the German company MAN to construct further diesel engines under licence. These power units appeared in the late 1950s&#x27; British Railways (BR) designs pre-TOPS British Rail Class D3/1 (later D3/4), and later designated Class 21, Class 22, Class 41 and Class 43 (Warship). None of these were particularly successful: constructional shortcomings with the MAN engines made them far less reliable than German-built examples. A typical example of this was the grade of steel used for exhaust manifolds in the Class 43s – frequent manifold failures led to loss of turbocharger drive gas pressure and hence loss of power. More importantly, the driving cabs of the locomotives would fill with poisonous exhaust fumes. BR returned many North British diesel locomotives to their builder for repair under warranty and they also insisted on a three-month guarantee on all repairs (a requirement not levied on its own workshops).

==Electric locomotives==

In the early 1950s, The General Electric Company (GEC) won a contract to build 40 electric locomotives for the South African Railways (SAR Class 4E) – NBL receiving the sub-contract to manufacture the locomotives with GEC-supplied electrical components.
GEC and NBL co-operated again in the construction of early 25 kV AC electric locomotives for the West Coast Main Line (WCML) electrification project of the early 1960s. GEC won a contract for ten locomotives and sub-contracted the mechanical design and construction to NBL: Class AL4 E3036–E3045 (later Class 84 84001–84010) entered traffic in 1960–61. As with its diesel locomotives, the class suffered poor reliability and spent long periods out of service. A partial reprieve came when money was made available to extend the electrification of the WCML north to Glasgow but no immediate funds were available for more electric locomotives. The Class 84s were refurbished in 1972 and pressed back into service, being finally withdrawn between 1978 and 1980 following delivery of Class 87 locomotives.

==Decline==
In 1959, GEC, Clydesdale Bank and HM Treasury invested in a restructuring programme at North British to enable the transition of the company from steam to diesel-electric and electric locomotive manufacture, centred around production of the Class AL4. Perhaps unwisely, North British supplied many of its diesel and electric locomotives to BR at a loss, hoping to make up for that on massive future orders that never came. That, and the continuing stream of warranty claims to cure design and workmanship faults, proved fatal. North British declared that it was entering voluntary liquidation on 19 April 1962. Because of the unreliability of its UK diesel and electric locomotives, all were withdrawn after comparatively short lifespans. The Atlas works site is now an industrial estate, and the Hyde Park works site is now the campus of North Glasgow College. The Queens Park works site on Aikenhead Road in Polmadie is now given over to a variety of industrial and commercial uses.

<doc id="1294236" wikidata="Q326785" url="?curid=1294236" title="Enigma rotor details">
<text>This article contains technical details about the rotors of the Enigma machine. Understanding the way the machine encrypts requires taking into account the current position of each rotor, the ring setting and its internal wiring.

==Physical design of rotors==


==Rotor electrical view==
No letter can map to itself, a cryptographic weakness caused by the same wires being used for forwards and backwards legs.
==Rotor offset== 
The effect of rotation on the rotors can be demonstrated with some examples.

As an example, let us take rotor type I of Enigma I (see table below) without any ring setting offset. It can be seen that an is encoded as an , a encoded as a , and a is encoded as an . Notice that every letter is encoded into another.

In the case of the reflectors, in this example Wide is taken (Reflector B in the table below) where an is returned as a and the is returned as an . Notice that the wirings are connected as a loop between two letters.

When a rotor has stepped, the offset must be taken into account to know what the output is, and where it enters the next rotor.

If for example rotor I is in the -position, an enters at the letter which is wired to the . Because of the offset this enters the next rotor in the position.

With the rotors I, II and III (from left to right), wide , all ring settings in , and start position , typing will produce the encoded sequence .

==Ring setting==
The ring settings, or &quot;Ringstellung&quot;, are used to change the position of the alphabet ring relative to the internal wiring. Notch and alphabet ring are fixed together. Changing the ring setting will therefore change the positions of the wiring, relative to the turnover-point and start position.

The ring setting will rotate the wiring. Where rotor I in the -position normally encodes an into an , with a ring setting offset -02 it will be encoded into 

As mentioned before these encodings only happen after the key is pressed and the rotor has turned. Tracing the signal on the rotors is therefore only possible if a key is pressed while the rotors were in the position and the ring settings are all on or .

With the rotors I, II, III (from left to right), wide , all ring settings in , and start position , typing will produce the encoded sequence .

==Rotor wiring tables==
This table shows how the internal wiring connects the right side of the rotor (with the spring-loaded contacts) to the left side. Each rotor is a simple substitution cipher. The letters are listed as connected to alphabet order. If the first letter of a rotor is , this means that the is wired to the . This does not mean that is wired to ; such looped wiring is only the case with the reflectors.

;Terminology
*&quot;The reflector is also known as the reversing drum or, from the German, the Umkehrwalze or UKW.&quot;

Technical comments related to Enigma modifications 1939-1945.

=== Swiss K ===
In 1941 it became known to the Swiss that some of their Enigma traffic was being read by the French. It was decided to make some design modifications.
* One of the modifications consisted in modifying the wheel stepping on the Swiss Army machine. The slow, left-hand wheel was made stationary during operation while the second wheel stepped with every key stroke.
* The third wheel and the UKW would step in the normal fashion with Enigma stepping for the third wheel.
* The stationary but rotatable left-hand wheel was meant to make up for the missing stecker connections on the commercial machine.
Swiss Army Enigma machines were the only machines modified. The surviving Swiss Air Force machines do not show any signs of modification. Machines used by the diplomatic service apparently were not altered either.

== Turnover notch positions ==
The single turnover notch positioned on the left side (plate connector side) of the rotor triggers the stepping motion by engaging the ratchet teeth of the wheel to the left. Later rotors had two turnover notches. The table below lists the turnover notch point of each rotor.
=== Normalized Enigma sequences ===
In the following examples you can observe a normal step sequence and a double step sequence. The used rotors are (from left to right) I, II, III, with turnovers on , and . It is the right rotor&#x27;s behavior we observe here (turnover ).

:&quot;Normal sequence:&quot;

* — normal step of right rotor
* — right rotor (III) goes in V—notch position
* — right rotor takes middle rotor one step further
* — normal step of right rotor

:&quot;Double step sequence:&quot;
* — normal step of right rotor
* — right rotor (III) goes in V—notch position
* — right rotor steps, takes middle rotor (II) one step further, which is now in its own E—notch position
* — normal step of right rotor, double step of middle rotor, normal step of left rotor
* — normal step of right rotor

==Fourth rotor==
The introduction of the fourth rotor was anticipated because captured material dated January 1941 had made reference to the development of a fourth rotor wheel; indeed, the wiring of the new fourth rotor had already been worked out.

On 1 February 1942, the Enigma messages began to be encoded using a new Enigma version that had been brought into use. The previous 3-rotor Enigma model had been modified with the old reflector replaced by a thin rotor and a new thin reflector. Breaking Shark on 3-rotor bombes would have taken 50 to 100 times as long as an average Air Force or Army message. It seemed, therefore, that effective, fast, 4-rotor bombes were the only way forward. Encoding mistakes by cipher clerks allowed the British to determine the wiring of the new reflector and its rotor.

<text>Chris Matthew Sciabarra (born February 17, 1960) is an American political theorist born and based in Brooklyn, New York. He is the author of three scholarly books—&quot;Marx, Hayek, and Utopia&quot;; &quot;Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical&quot;; and &quot;Total Freedom: Toward a Dialectical Libertarianism&quot;—as well as several shorter works. He is also the co-editor, with Mimi Reisel Gladstein, of &quot;Feminist Interpretations of Ayn Rand&quot; and co-editor with Roger E. Bissell and Edward W. Younkins of &quot;The Dialectics of Liberty: Exploring the Context of Human Freedom&quot;. His work has focused on topics including Objectivism, libertarianism (particularly the work of Friedrich Hayek and Murray Rothbard), and dialectics.

==Life==
Sciabarra was a graduate of John Dewey High School before moving onto New York University. He earned his BA in History (with honors), Politics, and Economics in 1981; his MA in Politics in 1983; and his PhD in Political Philosophy, Theory, and Methodology in 1988, under the supervision of Bertell Ollman. He was a Visiting Scholar in the NYU Department of Politics from 1989 to 2009. In 1999 he became the co-founder and co-editor of the biannual &quot;Journal of Ayn Rand Studies&quot;, which has been published by Penn State University Press since 2013, and belonged to Liberty and Power, a group weblog at the History News Network. The journal completed its 2+ decade run in 2023.

He is the author of a trilogy of books on dialectics and libertarianism. The second of these, published in 1995, is &quot;Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical&quot;, which explores Ayn Rand&#x27;s college influences and intellectual roots—particularly the role of Rand&#x27;s philosophy teacher, philosopher Nicholas Onufrievich Lossky—and argued that Rand&#x27;s philosophical method was dialectical in nature. In 2013, Pennsylvania State University Press published a second expanded edition of &quot;Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical&quot;, which includes a new preface, three new appendices (Appendices I and II are &quot;The Rand Transcript&quot; and &quot;The Rand Transcript, Revisited,&quot; first published in &quot;The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies&quot;, and Appendix III constitutes a response to Shoshana Milgram, a recent critic of Sciabarra&#x27;s historical work. The expanded second edition also includes an expanded section in Chapter XII, &quot;The Predatory State,&quot; entitled &quot;The Welfare-Warfare State,&quot; which explores Rand&#x27;s radical critique of US foreign policy). For a comparison of the two editions see the links on his Notablog. &quot;The Rand Transcript Revealed&quot;, co-authored by Sciabarra and Pavel Solovyev, was published in December 2021 in &quot;The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies&quot;, and constitutes the author&#x27;s most extensive exploration of Rand&#x27;s education.

Sciabarra is openly gay. He is of Sicilian and Greek ancestry. He has also talked openly about living with disability.

==Reviews of &quot;Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical&quot;==
David M. Brown writes: &quot;Much to my surprise the author of &quot;Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical,&quot; a comprehensive new study of Rand&#x27;s thought and its genesis in Russian culture, has persuaded me that something called &#x27;dialectics&#x27; is integral to Ayn Rand&#x27;s philosophic approach and crucial to its success. &quot;Russian Radical&quot; is a different kind of look at Ayn Rand, a full-fledged &#x27;hermeneutic&#x27; on the contours, development, and interpretation of her thought.&quot;

According to Lester H. Hunt: &quot;It is indicative of the interest of this book that I have so far engaged in an argument with it instead of saying how good I think it is on the whole. Among other things, it is an excellent synthesis of the Objectivist literature, both the works of Rand and those of her immediate successors. Sciabarra&#x27;s mastery of enormous amounts of material is almost literally incredible. He also manages to break entirely new ground on several different issues.&quot;

While James G. Lennox thoroughly rejects the author&#x27;s historical conclusions, and he recommends against construing Rand&#x27;s method of challenging dichotomies or &quot;false alternatives&quot; as &quot;dialectical,&quot; he also writes, &quot;[i]ts author has an encyclopedic familiarity with the writings of Ayn Rand and with virtually everyone who has advocated, commented on, or written critically about Objectivism. [...]. He is the first of her commentators to explore the intellectual milieu of Rand&#x27;s early, formative years, providing a deeper appreciation for her occasional scathing remarks about Russian culture as she had experienced it. All of this material is discussed, and exhaustively referenced, in the interests of providing a comprehensive analysis of Objectivism, not merely as a philosophical system, but as a philosophical and cultural movement.&quot;

John Ridpath, a director of the Ayn Rand Institute, has argued that &quot;The Russian Radical&quot; is postmodern and deconstructionist in its overall orientation, that it is a &quot;worthless product&quot; of contemporary academia, and that on the whole it was &quot;preposterous in its thesis, destructive in its purpose, and tortuously numbing in its content.&quot;

<text>Antoinette Renee Frank (born April 30, 1971) is a former officer of the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) who, on March 4, 1995, committed a violent armed robbery at a restaurant which resulted in the killing of two members of the Vietnamese-American family who ran the establishment, and fellow NOPD officer Ronald A. Williams II. She was aided by her probable lover, drug dealer Rogers Lacaze. Frank has been incarcerated since 1995 at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women in St. Gabriel, Louisiana, the only woman on the state&#x27;s death row.

==Police career==
Antoinette Frank applied to the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) in early 1993. According to author Chuck Hustmyre, Frank was caught lying on several sections of her employment application and failed two standard psychiatric evaluations, with psychiatrist Philip Scurria advising against her hiring. Despite this, Frank got a second chance to apply. The NOPD was chronically short-handed; at the time, its officers were paid less than in similarly sized cities, it was losing officers faster than they could be replaced, and the ranks had been decimated by several arrests for murder and drug activity. Many potential applicants were shut out due to a requirement that all officers be residents of New Orleans – a requirement that was only changed in 2014. NOPD officials also thought having more African-Americans like Frank on the force would ease longstanding racial tensions in the majority-black city. She was hired on February 7, 1993, and graduated from the police academy on February 28.

Although Frank graduated near the top of her academy class, her tenure with the NOPD left much to be desired. Her fellow officers thought she was rather shy, had no idea what police work really entailed and lacked the decisiveness to be a good officer. At times, they thought Frank veered into irrational behavior. As early as August 1993, Frank&#x27;s superiors wanted to send her back to the academy for further training. She frequently had to go through supervisory review. On occasion, though, she did distinguish herself, winning &quot;Officer of the Month&quot; awards from the local Kiwanis Club for her work in the community.

==Relationship with Rogers Lacaze==
On November 25, 1994, Frank handled an incident in which Rogers Lacaze, a known drug dealer, had been shot. An investigator with the Department of Public Safety and Corrections (DOC) believed this was the first contact between the two, although in her statement, Frank claims that they met some eight months before the murders. Frank had taken a statement from Lacaze after he was shot on the street, and initially got closer to him in hopes of turning his life around. However, she was smitten by Lacaze&#x27;s &quot;bad boy&quot; persona, and their relationship soon turned sexual. She kept up her relationship even though she was well aware she was jeopardizing her career.

The association between Frank and Lacaze became noticeable after other police officers witnessed Lacaze driving her car, and even observed him moving her police unit at the scene of an accident she was investigating. On one occasion, Lacaze accompanied her on a complaint call where she introduced him as a &quot;trainee&quot;; on other occasions, she introduced Lacaze as her nephew. Prior to the murders, others testified that Frank and Lacaze would pull over and rob motorists while in a squad car.

Frank refused to discuss her relationship with Lacaze during the DOC investigation, except to say that she was trying to help him. It was later revealed that the two had a sexual relationship. When asked why she would continue the relationship, knowing that Lacaze had been involved in dealing drugs and a shooting, she responded that she would not disassociate herself from him just because of his past. The investigator also questioned Frank about trying to buy 9mm ammunition for Lacaze at Walmart on the day before the Kim Anh murders, but stated that she was a police officer and that there was nothing wrong with her buying ammunition. In her statement, she claimed that she and Lacaze were not dating and had never been intimate. Frank refused to discuss anything regarding the murders - every time the investigator asked her a question, she told him to &quot;look it up in the record&quot; or asserted her innocence. However, during her interview with the DOC investigator, Frank claimed to have had a male suitor but refused to go into specifics because he worked for the police department.

Two men who claimed they met Lacaze at a party on February 4, 1995, John Stevens and Anthony Wallace, testified in court. As the two were leaving the party, a verbal altercation between Stevens and Lacaze ensued, but Wallace suggested they leave. The two men got in a car and drove several blocks until a police vehicle pulled the car over. In police uniform, Frank exited the squad car and told Wallace and Stevens to get out and go to the back of the car. At that point, Wallace saw Lacaze and noticed he was holding a gun. According to Stevens, Wallace rushed Lacaze, and the two men began fighting. Then both Stevens and Frank also jumped into the fray, and the weapon discharged. Stevens began running, but another man appeared and grabbed both Lacaze and Wallace. Frank then told the man that &quot;Lacaze was the good guy&quot; and that Wallace was the one causing the problems. Wallace was restrained until a backup unit arrived on the scene when he was subsequently arrested and charged with attempted murder and armed robbery.

Irvin Bryant, a civil sheriff in 1995, testified that on the evening of February 4, he observed a stopped police vehicle with its lights flashing. Bryant thought the officer was making a traffic stop, but as he got closer, he saw the officer and two black men fighting on the side of the road. At that time, Wallace broke away, ran, and picked up a TEC-9 semi-automatic weapon off the grass. Bryant ordered Wallace to drop the gun, which he did immediately and was restrained; Lacaze then lunged toward Wallace, but Bryant grabbed him. Frank informed him that Lacaze was with her and ordered him released. Despite his involvement in the altercation, Bryant was never questioned by police, and he never gave a formal statement.

==Restaurant robbery murders==

On March 4, 1995, Frank and Lacaze visited Kim Anh, a Vietnamese restaurant run by the Vu family in New Orleans East. Frank worked off-duty as a security guard. As the employees cleaned the closed restaurant, Chau Vu went into the kitchen to count money and entered the dining room of the restaurant to pay Ronald Austin Williams II. Williams was a colleague of Frank who had been working as the security guard that night to supplement his policeman&#x27;s salary. He joined the New Orleans Police Department in 1991 and was a married father of two. When Chau went to pay Williams, Chau noticed Frank approaching the restaurant.

Frank and Lacaze had been at the restaurant twice earlier in the night to get leftover food to eat. When Chau had let her out on the last visit, she could not find the front door key, and with Frank returning for the third time, she sensed something was wrong. Chau ran to the kitchen to hide the money in the microwave. Frank entered the front door using the key she had stolen from the restaurant earlier and walked quickly past Williams, pushing Chau, Chau&#x27;s brother Quoc, and a restaurant employee into the doorway of the restaurant&#x27;s kitchen. Williams started to follow, hoping to find out what was happening when shots rang out. Lacaze had slipped behind Williams and shot him in the neck, severing his spinal cord and instantly paralyzing him. As Williams fell, Lacaze continued to shoot him in the head and back, mortally wounding him. As Frank turned back to the restaurant dining room, Chau grabbed Quoc to hide somewhere.

Chau, Quoc, and the employee hid in the rear of a large walk-in cooler in the kitchen, turning out its light as they entered. They did not know the whereabouts of their other sister and brother, Ha and Cuong Vu, who had been sweeping the dining room floors when Frank entered the restaurant. From inside the cooler, Chau and Quoc could partially see the restaurant&#x27;s kitchen and front. Chau initially could see Frank looking for something in the kitchen. As Frank moved out of Chau&#x27;s line of vision, additional gunshots were fired but then observed Frank searching where the Vus usually kept their money. Frank and Lacaze had been shouting at Ha and Cuong, demanding the restaurant&#x27;s money, but they did not know where Chau had hidden it. Frank pistol-whipped 17-year-old Cuong when he hesitated in revealing the location of the money. Frank got the money out of a microwave, then shot 21-year-old Ha three times as she knelt, pleading for her life. Then, she shot Cuong six times. After Frank and Lacaze left the premises, Chau tried frantically to call 911 on her cell phone, but the cooler prevented her from getting a usable signal. Quoc emerged from the cooler and ran out the restaurant&#x27;s back door to a nearby friend&#x27;s home to call 911 to report the murders.

The robbers fled the restaurant, and Frank dropped Lacaze off at a nearby apartment complex, both knowing that witnesses were left behind. Frank heard the 911 call on her portable police radio saying that an officer was down at the Kim Anh restaurant. She borrowed a patrol car and returned to the scene. Posing as a responding officer, she intended to kill Chau and Quoc to ensure there would be no witnesses. Parking in the rear, Frank entered through the restaurant&#x27;s back door and made her way through the kitchen to the dining room, where Chau waited for help at the front door. As Chau fled through the restaurant&#x27;s front door to the safety of arriving officers, Frank immediately identified herself as a police officer. Chau told Frank she knew what she had done and cried to the officers that Frank had committed the crimes.

Eddie Rantz, the homicide detective who worked the case, believed Frank and Lacaze planned the robbery to get revenge on Williams. Frank believed Williams was shortchanging her on hours and pay at the Kim Anh, and wanted revenge. Rantz subsequently described Frank as the most cold-hearted person he had ever encountered in three decades as an officer. Chau and Frank were questioned in detail while seated at different tables in the restaurant. Frank was arrested and charged with three counts of first degree murder. Lacaze was arrested and charged later that night. Frank was taken to police headquarters for additional questioning, where she later confessed to the crimes along with Lacaze. She was believed to be the first New Orleans police officer to have been charged with killing a fellow officer.

==Trial and conviction==
Frank and Lacaze were indicted by an Orleans Parish grand jury on April 28, 1995. Their trials were severed, and Lacaze was tried first on July 17–21, 1995, before Judge Frank Marullo. He was found guilty as charged and sentenced to death. His main tip-off had been using Williams&#x27; Chevron credit card at a Chevron station in Gretna just minutes after the robbery and murders.

Frank&#x27;s trial began on September 5, 1995, also before Marullo. Although Frank&#x27;s attorneys had subpoenaed 39 witnesses, they didn&#x27;t call a single one.
On September 12, 1995, the jury needed only 22 minutes to return a guilty verdict on all counts—at the time, a record for a capital murder case in New Orleans. The next day, they needed only 45 minutes to recommend the death penalty. She was formally sentenced to death on October 20, 1995, and sent to Death Row at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women (LCIW) in St. Gabriel, near Baton Rouge.

==Aftermath and later developments==
Officer Williams was interred in Lake Lawn Metairie Cemetery on March 7, 1995. His name was inscribed on the Memorial Wall at The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington D.C.

Initially, the Vu family kept the restaurant open at the site of the tragedy in New Orleans East for a decade, until suffering flood damage from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and post-storm looters stealing jewelry which Ha and Cuong had been wearing when they were killed. After that, Quoc Vu and his mother Nguyet sold the location, re-opening the restaurant in Harahan, and moving their residence to Metairie, where they said they felt safer.

In 1993, a year and a half before the murders at the Kim Anh, Frank&#x27;s father had stayed at her home for a time before she then reported him missing. In November 1995, a month after she received her first death sentence, a dog led police to find a human skull with a bullet hole buried under Frank&#x27;s house. In a 2005 retrospective, Chuck Hustmyre said, &quot;As for those human bones unearthed beneath Frank&#x27;s house, so far, authorities have made no serious effort to identify them. The 10-year-old case, they say, remains under investigation.&quot;

Police and prosecutors believe that the skull was that of Adam Frank, and that Antoinette murdered him. However, since she is already on death row for the Kim Anh murders, they have made no effort to try her for her father&#x27;s death.

On October 18, 2006, Frank&#x27;s lawyers argued before the Louisiana Supreme Court that her death sentence should be overturned because she was denied state-funded experts to help prepare for the sentencing phase of the trial. They argued that the defense needed to conduct &quot;an investigation into the defendant&#x27;s background for possible mitigating evidence.&quot; Frank&#x27;s attorneys introduced the testimony of psychiatrists who said that possible traumatic events in Frank&#x27;s childhood could have affected her behavior at the time of the murders and she may have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. A psychiatrist retained by the state disagreed that Frank showed symptoms of trauma; he agreed with the diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder with antisocial tendencies given to Frank by doctors at the Louisiana Correctional Institute for Women. On May 22, 2007, the Louisiana Supreme Court ruled 5–2 that the death penalty should be upheld.

On April 22, 2008, District Judge Frank Marullo signed the death warrant for Antoinette Frank. According to the warrant, Frank was scheduled for execution by lethal injection on July 15, 2008. In May, however, the Louisiana Supreme Court issued a 90-day stay of execution effective June 10 pending ongoing appeals.

On September 11, 2008, the day that the state supreme court stay was to end, a new death warrant was signed by the same judge. According to this second warrant, Frank was scheduled for execution by lethal injection on December 8, 2008. In a new round of appeals, defense attorneys argued they had had too little time to review the voluminous record before the deadline for filing appeals. The state supreme court ruled on the case again. Their decision, made public November 25, 2008 effectively voided the death warrant signed by Judge Marullo in September.

In September 2009, Frank&#x27;s lawyers moved to have Judge Marullo removed from Frank&#x27;s ongoing post-conviction appeals on grounds of bias, given that he had already signed two death warrants for her. Louisiana state Judge Laurie White heard the motion in September 2009 and, on January 3, 2010, ruled that Marullo should not be taken off the case. Frank&#x27;s attorney stated she would appeal the ruling to the state&#x27;s supreme court, which had already overruled both of Marullo&#x27;s death warrants. However, yet another lower court state judge, ruled in October 2010 that Marullo had to be recused from the Frank and Lacaze cases because it was unclear if he had been open with the defense teams about his own surprising connection to the gun used in the restaurant murders. Marullo&#x27;s signature appeared on an order authorizing Frank to take the murder weapon from the evidence room; Marullo has long maintained the signature was forged. No female has been executed by the State of Louisiana since Toni Jo Henry died in the State&#x27;s Electric chair in 1942.

On July 23, 2015, retired district judge Michael Kirby threw out Rogers Lacaze&#x27;s conviction and sentence and ordered a new trial. Kirby said that Lacaze deserved a new trial because one of the jurors hid the fact that he was a Louisiana state trooper and previously worked as a railroad policeman. At the time, commissioned law enforcement officers were legally barred from sitting on a jury. Kirby wrote that while he felt the evidence of Lacaze&#x27;s guilt was &quot;overwhelming&quot;, the juror misconduct amounted to a &quot;structural defect&quot; and a &quot;violation of a constitutional right so basic to a fair trial&quot; that the only remedy was a new trial. Kirby&#x27;s ruling has no effect on Frank&#x27;s conviction. An appellate court later overturned the new trial order for Lacaze. 4th Circuit appellate judges Edwin Lombard, Paul Bonin and Madeleine Landrieu ruled &quot;After review of the state&#x27;s writ application in light of the applicable law and arguments of the parties, we find that the trial court erred in finding that the seating of Mr. Settle on the defendant&#x27;s jury was a structural error entitling him to a new trial&quot;.

Frank was profiled in an episode of &quot;Deadly Women&quot; in 2009, &quot;&quot; in 2015, and &quot;I&#x27;d Kill For You&quot; in 2016.

In November 2020, TV One debuted a movie inspired by Antoinette Frank called &quot;Blood On Her Badge .&quot;

LCIW was damaged by 2016 flooding, so its prisoners, including Frank, were moved to other prisons.

Lacaze was re-sentenced to life imprisonment without parole on December 13, 2019. Lacaze is serving his sentence at the Louisiana State Penitentiary (&quot;Angola&quot;) in West Feliciana Parish.

In 2023, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, nearing the end of his term in 2024, publicly announced his opposition to the death penalty and advocated for its abolition in the state. However, on May 24, 2023, a majority of lawmakers voted against a bill aimed at abolishing capital punishment. A month later, in June 2023, 56 out of the 57 death row inmates in Louisiana, including Frank, petitioned the governor for clemency, citing his anti-death penalty stance. The pleas were to be processed by the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Committee on Parole. 

In July 2023, the state’s parole board rejected all 56 clemency petitions, ruling that the inmates were ineligible because such requests could not be filed within a year of a judge&#x27;s ruling on an appeal. On October 13, 2023, Frank&#x27;s appeal for clemency was rejected during a meeting of Louisiana&#x27;s pardon board.

In February 2025, the Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill and Governor Jeff Landry announced plans to resume executions with the newly enacted method of nitrogen hypoxia, and convicted murderers Christopher Sepulvado (who murdered his stepson in 1992) and Jessie Hoffman Jr. (who raped and killed a woman in 1996) were scheduled to be executed on March 17 and March 18, 2025, respectively, therefore becoming the first two inmates set for execution since the state&#x27;s last execution in 2010. However, Frank was not one of the few inmates who had exhausted all appeals and became eligible for execution, because she is currently filing a post-conviction appeal against her death sentence, and the motion is pending.

<text>Koders was a search engine for open source code. It enabled software developers to easily search and browse source code in thousands of projects posted at hundreds of open source repositories.

On April 28, 2008, it was announced that Black Duck Software would acquire the Koders assets and technologies although the Koders website will remain as a free resource.

On May 19, 2009, Black Duck Software announced that projects from the Microsoft CodePlex open source project hosting site will now be fed automatically into Black Duck’s open source KnowledgeBase repository. The projects also will be searchable through Black Duck’s Koders.com.

Koders announced on September 9, 2009 that their search engine now exceed 2.4 billion lines of code; a 210% increase since April 2008.

Black Duck Software announced on October 25, 2012 the merge of Koders with Ohloh Code.

<doc id="1294277" wikidata="Q131470" url="?curid=1294277" title="Epidendroideae">
<text>Epidendroideae is a subfamily of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. Epidendroideae is larger than all the other orchid subfamilies together, comprising more than 15,000 species in 576 genera. Most epidendroid orchids are tropical epiphytes, typically with pseudobulbs. There are, however, some terrestrials such as &quot;Epipactis&quot; and even a few myco-heterotrophs, which are parasitic upon mycorrhizal fungi.

They typically contain the remaining orchids with a single, fertile anther ( = monandrous), which is also fully incumbent ( = strongly convex) to suberect (= ascending towards the edges). The anther form arises from column elongation or, as in the vandoids, from early anther bending. The incumbent anther forms a right angle with the column axis or is pointed backward in many genera. Most have hard pollinia, i.e. a mass of waxy pollen or of coherent pollen grains. The pollinia are with caudicle and viscidium or without. The stigma are entire or three-lobed; a beak is present. The apical part of the middle stigma lobe forms a stipe ( = pollinium stalk). The ovary is unilocular. The leaves are distichous or spiraling, growing on thickened stems.

The Epidendroideae are difficult to classify. They have been divided in “lower epidendroids” and “higher epidendroids”.

==Description==
Epiphytes are plants which grow above the ground, on top of other plants. They are not planted in the soil and are not parasitic (i.e. they do not feed on other plants; however, some types still damage their host in various ways). By growing on other plants, the epiphytes can reach to the light better or where they can avoid struggling for light. Many mosses and lichens are epiphytes, as are approximately 10 per cent of all seed plants and ferns. Epiphytes are common in some groups of plants, such as ferns, mosses, lichens, and algae. Over half of the 20,000 species of orchids are epiphytes.

==Habitat==
Most epiphytic seed plants and ferns are found in tropical and subtropical rainforests because they need high humidity to survive. The areas which most epiphytes grow are the montane rainforests. Epiphytic orchids are found on many positions of the host tree, depending on species requirements and size, some large species will grow in a fork, whereas some small species scramble through thin branches, other species will climb up the trunk etc. etc. The trees provide many habitats with different conditions of temperature, contact and light. In temperate places, epiphytes are most common in moist forests, such as the rainforests in Queensland.

==Adaptation==
Epiphytes are not adapted to droughts in the same way are other flora, because they don’t have access to the ground, but they still have some mechanisms to help them survive. Some become completely dormant for months at a time; many epiphytes show crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), which involves taking in CO2 at night, and photo-fixing it during the day with closed stomata to reduce water loss by transpiration. They also contain absorptive plants that are capable at quickly taking up water when it is available and preventing drought when water is scarcer. CAM can be impeded by higher night-time temperatures, dehydrated tissues, and high saturation deficits in the surrounding air, which lower the &quot;stomata conductance&quot; of the epiphytes, reducing the CO2 uptake, which in turn reduces growth and reproduction and even induces carbon loss. Higher temperatures, strain on evaporation, and contact to light cause CAM-idling, which is the epiphyte closing its stomata when it becomes stressed, that brings down the range of habitats a species can inhabit. Epiphyte species work biomasses are much more sensitive to different relative moisture levels than other plants.

==Taxonomy==
It was published by Vincenz Franz Kosteletzky in 1831 with &quot;Epidendrum&quot; as the type genus.
===Tribe classification===
The subfamily Epidendroideae is divided into two clades or subgroups known as the higher epidendroids (vandoids) and the lower epidendroids. The lower epidendroids contain polyphyletic tribes, particularly the Arethuseae and Epidendreae. The tribes are listed below:
The tribes of the subfamily Epidendroideae (as of 2014)

Higher epidendroids (vandoids)
* Cymbidieae
* Vandeae

Lower epidendroids
* Arethuseae (polyphyletic)
* Calypsoeae
* Collabieae
* Dendrobieae
* Epidendreae (polyphyletic)
* Gastrodieae
* Malaxideae
* Neottieae
* Nervilieae
* Podochileae
* Sobraliinae
* Triphoreae
* Tropidieae
* Xerorchideae

This classification has a rather ephemeral nature and is prone to frequent revision. Changes are likely to occur as new morphological and genetic data become available.

The genus &quot;Devogelia&quot; is not placed in a tribe.

<doc id="1294354" wikidata="Q7250222" url="?curid=1294354" title="Property P conjecture">
<text>In geometric topology, the Property P conjecture is a statement about 3-manifolds obtained by Dehn surgery on a knot in the 3-sphere. A knot in the 3-sphere is said to have Property P if every 3-manifold obtained by performing (non-trivial) Dehn surgery on the knot is not simply-connected. The conjecture states that all knots, except the unknot, have Property P.

Research on Property P was started by R. H. Bing, who popularized the name and conjecture.

This conjecture can be thought of as a first step to resolving the Poincaré conjecture, since the Lickorish–Wallace theorem says any closed, orientable 3-manifold results from Dehn surgery on a link.
If a knot formula_1 has Property P, then one cannot construct a counterexample to the Poincaré conjecture by surgery along formula_2.

A proof was announced in 2004, as the combined result of efforts of mathematicians working in several different fields.

==Algebraic Formulation==

Let formula_3 denote elements corresponding to a preferred longitude and meridian of a tubular neighborhood of formula_2.

formula_2 has Property P if and only if its Knot group is never trivialised by adjoining a relation of the form formula_6 for some formula_7.

<text>Lee Hyo-ri (; born May 10, 1979) is a South Korean singer, record producer, activist, actress and television presenter. She debuted as a member of group Fin.K.L in 1998, which became one of the most popular girl groups in South Korea during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Aside from Fin.K.L, she has also participated in several project groups, including the Refund Sisters and SSAK3 in 2020.

Lee made her solo debut in August 2003 with the release of &quot;Stylish....&quot; The album sold over 150,000 copies and spawned the hit single &quot;10 Minutes&quot;. The song received widespread recognition in South Korea and led Lee to win numerous grand prizes (&quot;daesangs&quot;) at domestic year-end award ceremonies, including at the KBS Music Awards, SBS Gayo Daejeon, Mnet Music Video Festival, and the Seoul Music Awards. Her significant popularity in South Korea at the time was dubbed the &quot;Hyori Syndrome&quot; by Korean media, with some also deeming 2003 &quot;the year of Hyori&quot;.

Lee&#x27;s sophomore studio album, &quot;Dark Angel&quot; (2006), spawned several singles including &quot;Get Ya!&quot;. The album was a critical failure, however, with &quot;Get Ya!&quot; receiving accusations of plagiarism. Her third studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s Hyorish&quot; (2008), was better received critically and became the best-selling album by a female soloist in 2008. Its single, &quot;U-Go-Girl&quot;, ranked atop the music program charts for multiple weeks. Lee once again faced plagiarism accusations with her next album, &quot;H-Logic&quot; (2010), when composer Bahnus was found to have plagiarized seven of the album&#x27;s tracks. She subsequently took a temporarily hiatus from the entertainment industry, and became a spokesperson for various causes such as animal rights.

On television, Lee was dubbed the &quot;Nation&#x27;s Fairy&quot; during her days on variety show &quot;Family Outing&quot;, and received the Grand Prize at the 2009 SBS Entertainment Awards for the program (alongside Yoo Jae-suk). In 2006, Lee became the highest-paid female singer in South Korea when she signed a contract with Mnet Media. &quot;The Korea Times&quot; named Lee one of the top 10 Most Influential Women on the Cultural Scene since 1950. Mnet ranked her number 42 in their Legend 100 Artists list in 2013.

==Biography==
===1979–1997: Early life===
Lee was born in 1979 in Osong-ri, Cheongwon County, North Chungcheong Province, South Korea, as the youngest of three daughters. Lee grew up impoverished, in a barbershop of about 8 pyeong (approximately 285 square feet). After being expelled from middle school once, Lee worked part-time at a restaurant and was scouted by an agency and cast by the manager of H.O.T.. Lee was discovered while taking sticker pictures with her friends. She prepared for a girl group debut while living as a trainee of SM Entertainment before eventually debuting as the leader of Fin.K.L.

===1998–2002: Career beginnings in Fin.K.L===
Lee began her career as part of South Korean pop girl group Fin.K.L. As the eldest member, she was the leader of the group. She was the last member to join Fin.K.L, just before their debut in January 1998. Fin.K.L debuted officially on May 22, 1998, with their first single &quot;Blue Rain&quot;. The second release from their debut album, &quot;To My Boyfriend&quot;, became the first of their multiple number one hits. Fin.K.L became one of the most popular and successful South Korean pop groups of all-time, rivaling fellow popular girl group S.E.S.

===2003–2005: &quot;Stylish...&quot;===
A year after Fin.K.L&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Forever&quot;, her solo debut album was released in August 2003, entitled &quot;Stylish...&quot;. The lead single &quot;10 Minutes&quot; became one of her signature hits and the singer nearly swept the daesangs, the most prestigious South Korean music award, winning more than seven of them, including three of the four most prestigious daesangs. &quot;Stylish...&quot; sold 144,182 copies in South Korea alone, according to the Music Industry Association of Korea in 2003. Her popularity in her various activities eventually was dubbed as the &quot;Hyori Syndrome&quot; in South Korea, and the Korean Media nicknamed 2003 &quot;The Year of Hyori&quot; as she was rarely out of the news all year. She won numerous awards for &quot;10 Minutes&quot; at the end of the year, including Most Popular Music Video (daesang) at the 2003 Mnet Music Video Festival, and the grand prizes and the SBS Gayo Daejeon and KBS Music Awards.

In January 2005, Lee made her acting debut in the SBS TV series &quot;Three Leaf Clover&quot;, starring opposite Ryu Jin, Kim Jung-hwa, Kim Kang-woo, and Lee Hoon. However, the 16-episode drama received low ratings (less than 10%) and Lee was criticized for her acting, with viewers saying she was miscast as a downtrodden but cheerful steel mill worker. On August 8, 2005, she co-hosted the annual Korean Music Festival for the second year running.

===2006–2007: Signing with Mnet and &quot;Dark Angel&quot;===
In February 2006, Lee released her follow-up album, &quot;Dark Angel&quot;. The first single, &quot;Get Ya!&quot;, was accused of being plagiarized by the songwriters of Britney Spears&#x27; single &quot;Do Somethin&#x27;&quot;. It was reported that Lee had signed a three-year contract with Mnet Entertainment (currently Stone Music Entertainment) for , becoming the highest-paid female singer in South Korea (approx. per year).

Despite the failure of her previous drama &quot;Three Leaf Clover&quot;, in 2007, Lee starred opposite Lee Dong-gun in the mini-drama &quot;If in Love... Like Them&quot;. Although originally announced as being only one episode long, it aired for four episodes on Mnet. An edited two-episode version of the drama also ran on SBS. During filming, part of a roof Lee was standing on collapsed. Only her foot fell through, but reportedly the fall might have been fatal if co-star Lee Dong-gun had not rescued her.

In February 2007, Lee announced her new digital single which would essentially be the soundtrack to &quot;If in Love... Like Them&quot;. She performed all three main tracks from the single on &quot;Inkigayo&quot; on February 25, 2007. The lead song was &quot;Toc Toc Toc&quot; (). Despite the single&#x27;s genre being R&amp;B, Lee began to sing more ballads afterwards, slowly moving away from her &quot;sexy superstar&quot; image. The single, although initially given a digital-only release, was given a limited retail release of only 30,000 copies. It was released on March 6, 2007, and in addition to the three tracks found in the digital single, it included a reworked version of &quot;Toc Toc Toc.&quot; It was the best-selling album for that month, selling 27,845 copies.

Although her single was commercially successful, her drama was heavily penalized for violating advertising guidelines, as &quot;If in Love... Like Them&quot; had several instances of overt product placement, in addition to using Lee&#x27;s songs in the soundtrack. The Korean Broadcasting Committee ruled that the drama should not be aired in South Korea again, and that the network must apologize to its viewers.

Lee also did promotions in Japan when Japanese network Fuji TV aired &quot;If in Love... Like Them&quot;, where Lee was given the same VIP treatment offered to other international stars. The drama was broadcast on CS Fuji, a smaller satellite channel that Fuji TV owned.

===2008–2009: TV hosting and &quot;It&#x27;s Hyorish&quot;===
During breaks in her solo music career, Lee also hosted various television programs, including &quot;Time Machine&quot; and &quot;Happy Together&quot;, which she co-hosted with Yoo Jae-suk in 2006. On April 8, 2008, she joined KBS&#x27;s &quot;Sang Sang Plus&quot; as a co-host alongside Country Kkokko members Shin Jung-hwan and Tak Jae-hoon. She was one of the original co-hosts of &quot;Change&quot;, a show on SBS&#x27;s &quot;Good Sunday&quot; line-up, before leaving in early July. She is also a former cast member of the variety show &quot;Family Outing&quot;, appearing in only the first season. Mnet ran a 12-episode show called &quot;Off the Record: Lee Hyori&quot;, which documented Lee&#x27;s life on-set for three months; the show&#x27;s purpose was to lessen the gap between the singer and her fans/anti-fans by letting them see that she is just another human being like everyone.

Her third studio album, &quot;It&#x27;s Hyorish&quot;, was released on July 14, 2008. &quot;U-Go-Girl&quot;, the first single from the album, peaked at number 1 on online and offline charts, including various television music shows. On December 20, 2008, Lee held her first solo concert &quot;Lee Hyori the Invincible&quot; at the Jamsil Arena. Upon release, tickets to the concert sold out in five minutes. In November 2009, her contract with Mnet Media was set to expire. Lee planned to sign a contract with Gil Entertainment (currently B2M Entertainment) and work with Gil Jong-hwa, Fin.K.L&#x27;s co-manager who had worked with the group since its debut. However, her 2010 album was released under the label of Mnet Media.

===2010–2015: &quot;H-Logic&quot;, Album plagiarism controversy and &quot;Monochrome&quot;===
Almost two years after her previous album, Lee returned with &quot;H-Logic&quot; on April 12, 2010. The album has 14 tracks, including collaborations with Daesung from Big Bang, Jeon Ji-yoon from 4Minute, Bekah from After School, Gary from Leessang, and Sangchu from Mighty Mouth. The singer worked also with E-Tribe, the team behind &quot;U-Go-Girl&quot;, the lead single from her previous album. A music video was released for &quot;Swing&quot; (), featuring Gary from Leessang, on March 31, 2010. The lead single &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; and its music video were released soon after. The self-penned song, which features Ceejay (from Freshboyz), was released the same day as her album. She won two Mutizen Song awards on &quot;The Music Trend&quot; for her lead single within two weeks.

Soon after the release of the album &quot;H-Logic&quot;, seven of its songs, composed by Bahnus, were accused of plagiarism (among the allegedly plagiarized songs was &quot;Bring It Back,&quot; performed by Canadian girl group Cookie Couture). On June 21, 2010, Lee admitted that the plagiarism accusations against her album were true, saying she had been &quot;deceived&quot;; she temporarily stopped all her activities as a singer and suspended her TV appearances.

While on hiatus, Lee began to grow as a cultural influence. She wrote online columns for vernacular newspapers such as The Hankyoreh that mixed her thoughts on life and career with social commentary, and was well reviewed for her simple prose, humor and intelligence. She also became an increasing presence in the civic community, emerging as one of the country&#x27;s most high-profile animals rights activists. In 2011, Lee released two charity songs for donation to animal shelters, &quot;Please Stay Behind&quot; () and &quot;Remember&quot; ().

Beginning March 4, 2012, she and singer-songwriter/pianist Jung Jae-hyung hosted the music show &quot;Jung Jae-hyung &amp; Lee Hyo-ri&#x27;s You and I&quot; on SBS. The show aired its final episode on October 14, 2012, ending its ten-month run due to low ratings. After her comeback was pushed back several times throughout 2012, it was announced that Lee would return to the stage with her fifth full-length album in May 2013. Five video teasers were released on YouTube on April 23, 2013. On May 6, 2013, she released her pre-release track for the album, titled &quot;Miss Korea&quot; (). Lee herself wrote and composed the sophisticated retro-jazz song (it was arranged by her then-boyfriend, guitarist Lee Sang-soon), and the full-version music video released on the same day was a black-and-white video depicting Lee as a circa 1950s-type glamorous Miss Korea pageant crown holder. She personally selected 30 non-celebrity women &quot;with love and respect for themselves&quot; who she saw as the genuine Miss Korea&#x27;s to perform the song with her on stage at the 2013 SBS Gayo Daejeon televised concert.

Her fifth studio album, &quot;Monochrome&quot;, was released on May 21, 2013. Lee wrote the lyrics for eight of the 16 tracks on the album, and reportedly used a full band instead of using electronically generated sounds for the songs. Upon its release, eight tracks were ranked in the top 10 on Bugs, Olleh and Naver Music, while its lead track, &quot;Bad Girls&quot; topped the charts on Melon, Naver, Olleh and Bugs. She performed &quot;Bad Girls&quot; as part of a highly praised collaboration stage at the 2013 SBS Gayo Daejeon televised concert along with CL from girl group 2NE1, who had also released a bad girl themed song that year called The Baddest Female. On April 2, 2014, SBS announced she and actress Moon So-ri would host a talk show &quot;Magic Eye&quot;. The show started filming in April. Due to low ratings, the show aired its final episode on November 18, 2014.

===2015–2017: &quot;Black&quot;===
In February 2015, Lee&#x27;s representatives announced that her contract with B2M Entertainment had expired in 2013. In May 2015, Lee announced that she closed her blog as well as her Twitter account. Along with shutting down her social media, she stopped all of her television activities. In October of that year, Lee&#x27;s representative told media outlets that she would be taking a 2-year hiatus from her entertainment career, &quot;in order to have time for herself.&quot; In October 2016, Lee hinted at working on new music. In November, it was confirmed that Lee had signed with Kiwi Media Group with a new album due in 2017. In December, Lee made a return to social media with posts on Instagram.

In January 2017, Kiwi Media Group&#x27;s CEO Kim Hyung Suk revealed on MBC&#x27;s &quot;Video Star&quot; that Lee was taking on the bulk of the responsibility for her new album as executive producer while working with him and &quot;10 Minutes&quot; songwriter Kim Dong Hyun. In April 2017, it was announced that Lee would be starring with her husband in a new variety show entitled &quot;Hyori&#x27;s Homestay&quot;.

In June, Lee&#x27;s agency confirmed her comeback for early July as she prepared to film a music video for the single. Later the same month, her agency announced that singer-songwriter Lee Juck would be featured on one of the tracks. A few days later, Lee released a teaser image and video teaser for the album&#x27;s pre-release track &quot;Seoul&quot;. The self-composed electro-R&amp;B song was released on June 28, 2017, alongside the music video featuring the contrasting visuals of Seoul and Jeju Island. The album&#x27;s tracklist was revealed along with a series of visual teasers for the album a few days before the album&#x27;s release. On July 4, 2017, her sixth studio album, &quot;Black&quot;, was released alongside the rustic-themed official music video for the title track. The mature, experimental sound started with &quot;Monochrome&quot; continues as Lee wrote eight and composed nine of the ten album tracks.

===2017–present: Reality show, SSAK3 and Refund Sisters===
Lee and her husband, Lee Sang-soon, turned their house in Jeju Island into a guest house to film Hyori&#x27;s Homestay. In season 1, IU joins the show as an employee. In season 2, the employee position was replaced by YoonA, also in this season Park Bo-gum came to work as a temporary employee. In 2019, Lee reunited with Fin.K.L in a new reality show &quot;Camping Club&quot;.

On May 15, 2020, Lee announced that she had signed a contract with ESteem Entertainment. Through MBC&#x27;s &quot;Hangout with Yoo&quot;, she, under the stage name &quot;Linda G&quot;, founded the summer project co-ed trio named SSAK3 with Rain and Yoo Jae-suk. They released a debut single &quot;Beach Again&quot; on July 18, 2020 and officially debuted on July 25 with a debut stage on Music Core. SSAK3 is a special summer project, and they announced that all proceeds from their songs and promotions will be donated to communities in need. The single peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart.

After SSAK3 project, &quot;Hangout with Yoo&quot; programme has a spin-off from Lee naming Uhm Jung-hwa, Jessi and Hwasa as the members she wanted in her dream girl group during the SSAK3 segment. The four women formed another girl group named Refund Sisters with Yoo Jae-suk as a producer. They released a debut single &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch Me&quot; on October 10, 2020, which also peaked at number one in South Korea.

On October 13, 2021, it was announced that Lee will be hosting the 2021 Mnet Asian Music Awards on December 11, 2021, making her the first woman to host the show solo.

On September 5, Antenna announced that after more than 10 years of living in Jeju, Hyori and her husband has moved to Seoul and be more active in their career.

==Artistry and image==
After the disbandment of Fin.K.L., Lee&#x27;s style has been categorized as urban pop and dance-pop. With the release of &quot;H-Logic&quot;, Lee began to experiment with her sound by incorporating hip-hop into her music. Later releases have been influenced by country, blues, disco, folk and rock music. At the beginning of her solo career, Lee would sometimes write or co-write material for her albums alongside other songwriters. Later in her career, she began self-composing and producing much of her own material. Thematically, Lee&#x27;s songs have ranged from love and heartbreak to empowerment to social commentary with a female perspective.

Lee&#x27;s vocal range can be classified in the mezzo-soprano range. In spite of her sexy image, she has been recognized for her emotional delivery in songs like &quot;Swing&quot; and &quot;Amor Mio&quot;. Lee has been criticized for her vocal ability, which she responded with &quot;I think everyone thinks differently, so they can think so. Before, I felt like I was hiding behind the instruments. It felt uncomfortable otherwise. But starting from a point, I started liking my voice. Since I like it, it didn&#x27;t really matter what other people thought.&quot; Lee has been influenced by fellow Korean singer Uhm Jung-hwa.

===Image===
As a member of Fin K.L, Lee became known for her sex appeal. This image has allowed Lee to lend her face and image to advertising for various company endorsement deals, and in 2005 she was chosen in a consumer survey as the female entertainer with the strongest brand power. In late 2003, Lee signed an advertising contract with Samsung, for which she would make three musical commercials and songs for their Anycall cell phones, which became some of her most prominent commercials. The first commercial and song, &quot;Anymotion&quot;, was released in early 2005, featuring Eric Mun from Shinhwa. In early 2006, the follow-up commercial &quot;Anyclub&quot; featuring Teddy Park from 1TYM was released in two parts; the music video starred Eric Mun and actor Kwon Sang-woo. The songs from the commercials served as singles for Lee in between her albums. The final commercial was released in December 2006, titled &quot;Anystar&quot; and differed from the first two in that it featured mostly dialogue. The commercial starred actor Lee Joon-gi and YG Family trainee Park Bom (2NE1). Her contract with Samsung ended in December 2007.

For five years, Lee was the model for Lotte Liquor, making her its longest-serving endorser. According to Lotte, the market share of the company&#x27;s soju brand rose from 11 to 15 percent while Lee modeled for it. Her contract ended in November 2012.

In 2007, she starred in a commercial with Jessica Alba for South Korean cosmetics company Ĭsa Knox, which was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Lee also modeled for cosmetics company Biotherm (her contract ended in February 2007), and Black Bean Therapy, a health drink. She then signed with KB Card, and has starred in commercials along with Rain. She was a model for Calvin Klein Jeans, modeling for the &quot;Pure Calvin&quot; Collection. She was also briefly featured in a 2010 Adidas commercial. Over the years, Lee has appeared in music videos for artists like Davichi and Leessang.

====Stage name controversy====
During an episode of &quot;Hangout with Yoo&quot;, Lee Hyori was brainstorming stage names for the project group Refund Sisters. During this conversation she said, &quot;How about a Chinese name, since we could go global? How about &#x27;Mao&#x27;?&quot; In response to this, Chinese viewers of the show expressed their discontent as the name was reminiscent of Mao Zedong.

==Impact==
Lee Hyori has appeared on the Korea Power Celebrity 40 multiple times throughout her career, including placing within the top 15 in 2009–2011. Lee has been cited as an inspiration or influence by numerous artists, including Kara, Blackpink&#x27;s Jennie, Jeon Somi, Chungha, Jessica Jung, Dalshabet, Nada, Cherry Bullet&#x27;s Jiwon, Oh My Girl&#x27;s Jiho, Laboum&#x27;s Solbin, Elris&#x27; Sohee, Jung Eun-chae, Jin Se-yeon, and Huh Chan-mi.

==Other activities==
===Activism===
Lee has been recognized as one of South Korea&#x27;s leading socialtainers for her charity work and raising her voice for social causes. She adheres to a pescetarian diet according to her personal ethics and health beliefs and is an advocate for animal welfare and animal rights. In 2012 she published &quot;Closer&quot;, a photo-essay book that focuses on her everyday life with her dog Soonshim whom Lee adopted from an animal shelter. In the book Lee wrote her thoughts on animal rights and animal shelters as well as her sentiments toward wearing animal fur. She has given money to shelters along with taking in stray and abused animals. Her work in animal activism has led her to interviewing Jane Goodall.

When SsangYong Motor laid off workers in December 2014, Lee gave public support of the workers via Twitter, announcing that she wanted to see the new car Tivoli sell well so they would be hired again, adding that, if it happened, she would dance in front of the car in a bikini. During the 2012 presidential elections, Lee encouraged her fans to vote through a series of tweets and re-tweets. This drew both admiration and annoyance from others on social media. In a June 2012 poll by Panelnow, Lee was listed as one of &quot;the socialtainers that best represents Korea&quot; alongside broadcaster Kim Je-dong, singer Kim Jang-hoon, and actress Kim Yeo-jin.

==Personal life==
She married musician , guitarist of rock band Roller Coaster, on September 1, 2013, at their vacation home on Mt. Halla in Jeju Island. Both of them are members of an animal rights group and began dating after they collaborated in July 2011 on a song that Lee recorded to support animal shelters. In 2021, &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; estimated her net worth to be around US$30–40 million.

<text>Wilhelm Traugott Krug (22 June 177012 January 1842) was a German philosopher and writer. He is considered to be part of the Kantian School of logic.

==Life==
Krug was born on June 22, 1770, near Wittenberg to a farming family. He studied at the University of Wittenberg under Franz Volkmar Reinhard and Karl Gottfried Jehnichen, at Jena under Karl Leonhard Reinhold, and at Göttingen. After finishing his studies, he was employed as an adjunct professor at the University of Wittenberg.

From 1801 to 1804, Krug was professor of philosophy at Frankfurt (Oder), after which he succeeded Immanuel Kant in the chair of logic and metaphysics at the University of Königsberg. From 1809 till his death he was professor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig. He fought in the War of Liberation (1813–14) as captain of mounted chasseurs. He became Kant&#x27;s successor at the University of Königsberg after the faculty of philosophy elected him to Kant&#x27;s chair of logic and metaphysics.

He died at Leipzig on January 12, 1842.

==Views==
In philosophy, Krug&#x27;s method was psychological; he attempted to explain the Ego by examining the nature of its reflection upon the facts of consciousness. Being is known to us only through its presentation in consciousness; consciousness only in its relation to Being. Both Being and Consciousness, however, are immediately known to us, as also the relation existing between them. By this Transcendental Synthesis he proposed to reconcile Realism and Idealism, and to destroy the traditional difficulty between transcendental, or pure, thought and things in themselves.

Krug challenged Schelling to deduce his quill or pen from German Idealism&#x27;s Philosophy of Nature. It was part of his empiricist objections to the new idealist philosophy. In so doing, he challenged the thinking that particular, perceptually real things could be logically known from general concepts. It prompted Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel to issue a critical response and forced him to deal with the issue of the knowledge of singulars.

&quot;Beiträge zur Geschichte der Philosophie des XIX. Jahrhunderts&quot; (1835–1838) contains criticisms of Hegel and Schelling.

Krug was a prolific writer on a great variety of subjects, excelling as a popularizer rather than as an original thinker. His work stimulated freedom of thought in religion and politics, and he was a firm supporter of Jewish emancipation.

==Personal life==
In 1804, Krug married Wilhelmine von Zenge (1780–1852), the eldest daughter of a Prussian major-general. They had six children. Wilhelmine had previously been engaged to Heinrich von Kleist.

<text>A pantograph (or &quot;pan&quot; or &quot;panto&quot;) is an apparatus mounted on the roof of an electric train, tram or trolley buses to collect power through contact with an overhead line. The term stems from the resemblance of some styles to the mechanical pantographs used for copying handwriting and drawings.

The pantograph is a common type of current collector; typically, a single or double wire is used, with the return current running through the rails. Other types of current collectors include the bow collector and the trolley pole.

== Invention ==
The pantograph, with a low-friction, replaceable graphite contact strip or &quot;shoe&quot; to minimise lateral stress on the contact wire, first appeared in the late 19th century. Early versions include the bow collector, invented in 1889 by Walter Reichel, chief engineer at Siemens &amp; Halske in Germany, and a flat slide-pantograph first used in 1895 by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

The familiar diamond-shaped roller pantograph was devised and patented by John Q. Brown of the Key System shops for their commuter trains which ran between San Francisco and the East Bay section of the San Francisco Bay Area in California. They appear in photographs of the first day of service, 26 October 1903. For many decades thereafter, the same diamond shape was used by electric-rail systems around the world and remains in use by some today.

The pantograph was an improvement on the simple trolley pole, which prevailed up to that time, primarily because the pantograph allows an electric-rail vehicle to travel at much higher speeds without losing contact with the overhead lines, e.g. due to dewirement of the trolley pole.

Notwithstanding this, trolley pole current collection was used successfully at up to on the Electroliner vehicles of the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad, also known as the North Shore Line.

== Modern use ==
The most common type of pantograph today is the so-called half-pantograph (sometimes Z-shaped), which evolved to provide a more compact and responsive single-arm design at high speeds as trains got faster. Louis Faiveley invented this type of pantograph in 1955. The half-pantograph can be seen in use on everything from very fast trains (such as the TGV) to low-speed urban tram systems. The design operates with equal efficiency in either direction of motion, as demonstrated by the Swiss and Austrian railways whose newest high-performance locomotives, the Re 460 and Taurus, operate with them set in the opposite direction. In Europe the geometry and shape of the pantographs are specified by CENELEC, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization.

While a pantograph is mainly used to power a railway traction unit, there are certain cases where it has a function other than traction: 

* Mechanical measurements and tests of new catenary (with or without voltage), on a catenary and contact line inspection car; 
* General power supply of a measuring car; 
* Power supply of an air-conditioned train (for example: pantograph mounted on a RENFE van for the 3,000 V DC power supply of the rest of the train via the UIC train line, or heating line), in the absence of a locomotive; 
* Power supply of a restaurant car, only when parked on a siding, under a catenary electrified with 15 kV AC 16⅔ Hz; this system is used on restaurant cars of the Swiss and German railways; 
* Grounding of the catenary during work carried out from certain work vehicles.

== Technical details ==
The electric transmission system for modern electric rail systems consists of an upper, weight-carrying wire (known as a catenary) from which is suspended a contact wire. The pantograph is spring-loaded and pushes a contact shoe up against the underside of the contact wire to draw the current needed to run the train. The steel rails of the tracks act as the electrical return. As the train moves, the contact shoe slides along the wire and can set up standing waves in the wires which break the contact and degrade current collection. This means that on some systems adjacent pantographs are not permitted.
Pantographs are the successor technology to trolley poles, which were widely used on early streetcar systems. Trolley poles are still used by trolleybuses, whose freedom of movement and need for a two-wire circuit makes pantographs impractical, and some streetcar networks, such as the Toronto streetcar system, which have frequent turns sharp enough to require additional freedom of movement in their current collection to ensure unbroken contact. However, many of these networks, including Toronto&#x27;s, are undergoing upgrades to accommodate pantograph operation.

Pantographs with overhead wires are now the dominant form of current collection for modern electric trains in city street, main and high speed lines because, although more fragile than a third rail system, they are safer for public (protection by distance), they may also allow higher voltages (especially AC ones) and higher speed.

Pantographs are typically operated by compressed air from the vehicle&#x27;s braking system, either to raise the unit and hold it against the conductor or, when springs are used to effect the extension, to lower it. As a precaution against loss of pressure in the second case, the arm is held in the down position by a catch. For high-voltage systems, the same air supply is used to &quot;blow out&quot; the electric arc when roof-mounted circuit breakers are used.

== Single and double pantographs ==

Pantographs may have either a single or a double arm. Double-arm pantographs are usually heavier, requiring more power to raise and lower, but may also be more fault-tolerant.

On railways of the former USSR, the most widely used pantographs are those with a double arm (&quot;made of two rhombs&quot;), but, since the late 1990s, there have been some single-arm pantographs on Russian railways. Some streetcars use double-arm pantographs, among them the Russian KTM-5, KTM-8, LVS-86 and many other Russian-made trams, as well as some Euro-PCC trams in Belgium. American streetcars use either trolley poles or single-arm pantographs.
== Metro systems and overhead lines ==

Most rapid transit systems are powered by a third rail, but some use pantographs, particularly ones that involve extensive above-ground running. Most hybrid metro-tram or &#x27;pre-metro&#x27; lines whose routes include tracks on city streets or in other publicly accessible areas, such as (formerly) line 51 of the Amsterdam Metro, the MBTA Green Line, RTA Rapid Transit in Cleveland, Frankfurt am Main U-Bahn, and San Francisco&#x27;s Muni Metro, use overhead wire, as a standard third rail would obstruct street traffic and present too great a risk of electrocution.

Among the various exceptions are several tram systems, such as the ones in Bordeaux, Angers, Reims and Dubai that use a proprietary underground system developed by Alstom, called APS, which only applies power to segments of track that are completely covered by the tram. This system was originally designed to be used in the historic centre of Bordeaux because an overhead wire system would cause a visual intrusion. Similar systems that avoid overhead lines have been developed by Bombardier, AnsaldoBreda, CAF, and others. These may consist of physical ground-level infrastructure, or use energy stored in battery packs to travel over short distances without overhead wiring.

Overhead pantographs are sometimes used as alternatives to third rails because third rails can ice over in certain winter weather conditions. The MBTA Blue Line uses pantograph power for the entire section of its route that runs on the surface, while switching to third rail power before entering the underground portion of its route. The entire metro systems of Sydney, Madrid, Barcelona, Porto, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul, Kobe, Fukuoka, Sendai, Jaipur, Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi use overhead wiring and pantographs (as well as certain lines of the metro systems in Beijing, Chongqing, Noida, Hyderabad, Jakarta, Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Singapore, Sapporo, Budapest, and Mexico City). Pantographs were also used on the Nord-Sud Company rapid transit lines in Paris until the other operating company of the time, Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris, bought out the company and replaced all overhead wiring with the standard third rail system used on other lines.

Numerous railway lines use both third rail and overhead power collection along different portions of their routes, generally for historical reasons. They include the North London line and West London lines of London Overground, the Northern City Line of Great Northern, three of the five lines in the Rotterdam Metro network, Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s New Haven Line, and the Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s Yellow Line. In this last case, the overhead portion was a remnant of the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railroad&#x27;s high-speed Skokie Valley Route, and was the only line on the entire Chicago subway system to utilize pantograph collection for any length. As such, the line required railcars that featured pantographs as well as third rail shoes, and since the overhead was a very small portion of the system, only a few cars would be so equipped. The changeover occurred at the grade crossing at East Prairie, the former site of the Crawford-East Prairie station. Here, trains bound for Dempster-Skokie would raise their pantographs, while those bound for Howard would lower theirs, doing so at speed in both instances. In 2005, due to the cost and unique maintenance needs for what only represented a very small portion of the system, the overhead system was removed and replaced with the same third rail power that was used throughout the rest of the system, which allowed all of Chicago&#x27;s railcars to operate on the line. All the pantographs were removed from the Skokie equipped cars.

Until 2010, the Oslo Metro line 1 changed from third rail to overhead line power at Frøen station. Due to the many level crossings, it was deemed difficult to install a third rail on the rest of the older line&#x27;s single track. After 2010 third rails were used in spite of level crossings. The third rails have gaps, but there are two contact shoes.

==Three-phase supply==

On some systems using three phase power supply, locomotives and power cars have two pantographs with the third-phase circuit provided by the running rails. In 1901 an experimental high-speed installation, another design from Walter Reichel at Siemens &amp; Halske, used three vertically mounted overhead wires with the collectors mounted on horizontally extending pantographs.

==Inclined pantographs==

On lines where open wagons are loaded from above, the overhead line may be offset to allow this; the pantographs are then mounted at an angle to the vertical.

== Weaknesses ==
Contact between a pantograph and an overhead line is usually assured through a block of graphite. This material conducts electricity while working as a lubricant. As graphite is brittle, pieces can break off during operation. Poorly-built pantographs can seize the overhead wire and tear it down, and poor-condition wires can damage the pantograph. To prevent this, a pantograph monitoring station can be used. At sustained high speeds, above , friction can cause the contact strip to become red hot, which in turn can cause excessive arcing and eventual failure.

In the UK, the pantographs (Brecknell Willis and Stone Faiveley) of vehicles are raised by air pressure and the graphite contact &quot;carbons&quot; create an air gallery in the pantograph head which release the air if a graphite strip is lost, activating the automatic drop device and lowering the pantograph to prevent damage. Newer electric traction units may use more sophisticated methods which detect the disturbances caused by arcing at the point of contact when the graphite strips are damaged. There are not always two pantographs on an electric multiple unit but, in cases where there are, the other one can be used if one is damaged; an example of this situation would be a Class 390 &quot;Pendolino&quot;. The rear pantograph in relation to the direction of travel is often used as to avoid damaging both pantographs in case of entanglements: if the front pantograph was used, debris from an entanglement could cause damage to the rear pantograph, rendering both pantographs and the vehicle inoperable.

== Automatic dropping device == 
Automatic dropping device (ADD) is a device that automatically lowers the pantograph on electric trains to prevent additional damages in case of obstructions or emergencies. It is also known as pantograph dropping device. 

In Europe, the automatic dropping device is mandatory for trains with operational speeds of 160 km/h or 120 km/h and higher if one or several pantographs are used respectively. Otherwise, the train operators are free to install these device. The damage that causes the pantograph to fall can include the strip head, the pantograph head and other parts.

The ADD mostly uses a pneumatic system to detect a damage. For example, a broken contact strip will cause a pressure drop in the air tube inside. On non-pneumatic pantographs (mostly tramway or metro), solutions as a pin on the pantograph head can pull a cable which lower pantograph. Nevertheless, infrastructure are free to impose it and performances (distance, force, time...) are not defined 

Time reaction and reaction to quit overhead contact line are defined for main line use. 

This function can be different to wearing detection made of a tube or insert place higher than ADD tube.

== Other ==
It exists several pantograph head profiles to meet electrical and mechanical infrastructure gauge of each country and infrastructure. At European level, two interoperable profiles were defined with 1 600 and 1950 mm length. 

An infrastructure can accept several head profiles, especially with conductive or insulated horns, but it also exists the Variopanto, a head with two possible lengths. 

Flat pantograph are emerging to fit on narrow roof gauges, allowing flat roof and reduced aerodynamic impact. They are made of insulated lower arm contrary to a &quot;classic&quot; pantograph fixed on insulators. Example: ETR1000 pantograph

<doc id="1294418" wikidata="Q112258" url="?curid=1294418" title="Karl Leonhard Reinhold">
<text>Karl Leonhard Reinhold (; ; 26 October 1757 – 10 April 1823) was an Austrian philosopher who helped to popularise the work of Immanuel Kant in the late 18th century. His &quot;elementary philosophy&quot; (&quot;Elementarphilosophie&quot;) also influenced German idealism, notably Johann Gottlieb Fichte, as a critical system grounded in a fundamental first principle.

He was the father of Ernst Christian Gottlieb Reinhold (1793–1855), also a philosopher.

==Life==
Reinhold was born in Vienna. In late 1772, at the age of fourteen he entered the Jesuit college (Roman Catholic seminary) of St. Anne&#x27;s Church, Vienna (Jesuitenkollegium St. Anna). He studied there for a year, until the order was suppressed in 1773, at which time he joined a similar Viennese Catholic college of the order of St. Barnabas, the Barnabitenkollegium St. Michael. In 1778 he became a teacher at the Barnabitenkollegium, on 27 August 1780 he was ordained as a priest, and on 30 April 1783 he became a member of the Viennese Freemasonry lodge &quot;Zur wahren Eintracht.&quot;

Finding himself out of sympathy with monastic life, he fled on 19 November 1783 to Leipzig, where he converted to Protestantism. In 1784, after studying philosophy for a semester at Leipzig, he settled in Weimar, where he became Christoph Martin Wieland&#x27;s collaborator on the &quot;German Mercury&quot; (&quot;Der Teutsche Merkur&quot;), and eventually his son-in-law. Reinhold married Wieland&#x27;s daughter Sophia Catharina Susanna Wieland (19 October 1768 – 1 September 1837) on 18 May 1785. In the &quot;German Mercury&quot; Reinhold published, in the years 1786–87, his &quot;Briefe über die Kantische Philosophie&quot; (&quot;Letters on the Kantian Philosophy&quot;), which were most important in making Immanuel Kant known to a wider circle of readers. As a result of these &quot;Letters&quot;, Reinhold received a call to the University of Jena, where he taught from 1787 to 1794.

In 1788, Reinhold published &quot;Hebräischen Mysterien oder die älteste religiöse Freymaurerey&quot; (&quot;The Hebrew Mysteries; or, The Oldest Form of Freemasonry&quot;) under the pseudonym &quot;Decius&quot;. The fundamental idea of this work is that Moses derived his system from the Egyptian priesthood. He presented them in the form of two lectures in Leipzig that year.

In 1789 he published his chief work, the &quot;Versuch einer neuen Theorie des menschlichen Vorstellungsvermögens&quot; (&quot;Essay towards a New Theory of the Faculty of Representation&quot;), in which he attempted to simplify the Kantian theory and make it more of a unity by basing it on one principle, Reinhold&#x27;s principle of consciousness (&quot;Satz des Bewußtseins&quot;). In 1794 he accepted a call to the University of Kiel, where he taught until his death in 1823, although his independent activity had come to an end.

In later life he was powerfully influenced by J. G. Fichte, and subsequently by F. H. Jacobi and Christoph Gottfried Bardili. However, his historical importance belongs entirely to his earlier activity. The development of the Kantian standpoint contained in the &quot;New Theory of Human Understanding&quot; (1789), and in the &quot;Fundament des philosophischen Wissens&quot; (1791), was called by its author &quot;Elementarphilosophie&quot;.

Reinhold lays greater emphasis than Kant upon the unity and activity of consciousness. The principle of consciousness tells us that every idea is related both to an object and a subject, and is partly to be distinguished from and partly united to both. Since form cannot produce matter and a subject cannot produce an object, we are forced to assume a thing-in-itself. This is a notion which is self-contradictory if consciousness were to be essentially a relating activity. There is therefore something which must be thought and yet cannot be thought.

==Philosophical work==
===&quot;Letters on the Kantian Philosophy&quot;===
As a former Catholic priest, Reinhold retained the values of Christian morality and individual dignity. The basic Christian doctrines of a transcendent God and an immortal human soul were presuppositions in his thinking. Reinhold tried to show that Kant&#x27;s philosophy provided an alternative to either religious revelation or philosophical skepticism and fatalistic pantheism. But Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; was a difficult and confusing book. It was not widely read and had little influence. Reinhold decided to write his comments on it in the literary journal &quot;The German Mercury&quot;. He skipped over the beginning and middle of the book and started at the end. Reinhold showed that the book was best read backwards, that is, starting with the end section. The last part of the Critique is where Kant discussed the issues of morality and their relation to the Rational Ideas of God, Free Will, and life after death. These issues were Reinhold&#x27;s main concern. By presenting these concerns to the public, instead of the extremely difficult epistemology that took up most of the beginning and middle of the book, Reinhold aroused great interest. As a result, Kant&#x27;s Critique immediately became a book of great importance.

According to historian of philosophy Karl Ameriks, &quot;Fichte, Hegel, Schelling, Schiller, Hölderlin, Novalis, and Friedrich Schlegel all developed their thought in reaction to Reinhold&#x27;s reading of Kant...&quot; There is a Faustian tendency in Reinhold&#x27;s assertion that a person can hope for a future reward only because that person is constantly striving to be good. It is not moral to be good merely in the hope of reward. Reinhold&#x27;s emphasis on history is evident in his declaration that philosophies and religions are to be judged on the way that they respond to the needs of reason in a particular era. Philosophical development, to him, has an underlying rationality. New philosophies are fated to struggle repeatedly in order to survive in a dialectic of history in which progress is unconsciously occurring. With regard to a transcendent God, the human internal moral law is externalized in such a deity. This extreme otherness or alienation is part of a rational process. It makes possible a subsequent deeper regaining of the self through something other than the self.

===Establishing Kant on secure ground===
Kant&#x27;s critical philosophy was not being accepted as the final truth. According to Professor George di Giovanni, of McGill University, Reinhold tried to provide a foundation for Kant&#x27;s philosophy in order to remedy this situation. Reinhold distinguished two levels of philosophy. The most basic level was the concern with consciousness and the representations that occurred in it. The second, less basic, level, was the concern with the possibility and structure of the known or desired objects.

Kant&#x27;s important realization was that the possibility of metaphysics can be established. This can be done only by describing what occurs when the mind is conscious of objects. Kant&#x27;s weakness was in being overly concerned with the objects themselves. He remained at the second, less basic, level of philosophy. He rarely examined what occurred in consciousness, which is the basic level of philosophy. Kant did not provide a phenomenological description of consciousness. Reinhold was convinced that Kant should have identified the fundamental fact of consciousness that was essential in making cognition itself possible.

Reinhold&#x27;s &quot;Essay towards a New Theory of the Human Faculty of Representation&quot; is a description of the main parts and attributes of consciousness. In writing this book, Reinhold turned his attention from the moral issues that Kant addressed in the end section of his &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot; to the epistemological concerns of the beginning and middle sections.
*General theory of representation
**The thing-in-itself necessarily exists, but cannot be known.
**Human knowledge is restricted to appearances only.
**Reinhold&#x27;s principle of consciousness – The thinking subject distinguishes, in his/her consciousness, the representation or mental image from both the observing subject and the observed object.
***This is a certain fact of consciousness.
***The observing subject is the location of the representation or mental image.
***The observed object is anything that is represented as being present to the mind of the observing subject.

Reinhold examined the necessary conditions of representation, such as subject and object, that must exist in order for an object to be consciously present.
*Representation&#x27;s material and form
**The representation&#x27;s material (&quot;Stoff&quot;) is a given or received manifold of sensation which is unified when it is attributed to a transcendental object. It allows the thinking subject to distinguish a thing-in-itself.
**The representation&#x27;s form is a spontaneous unifying act which occurs according to the subject&#x27;s conditions. It allows the thinking subject to distinguish a self-in-itself.
**The self-in-itself and the thing-in-itself must be assumed in order for the thinking subject to be able to make a distinction between consciousness itself and the object of consciousness.
*We can never know anything in itself, that is, as not representation. An object-in-Itself or subject-in-itself does not have matter (sensation) or representational form, so they cannot be known. Only that which is represented can be known
*Consciousness must contain representation.
**An empirical representation takes its material from a source that is supposed to be external to it.
**A pure representation takes its material by reflecting on consciousness
**A clear and distinct consciousness of an object is an awareness that consciousness itself is a representation in a subject of an external object.
*Special theory of cognition
**Cognition is clear, distinct knowledge that consciousness contains a representation of an object.
***Cognition is consciousness&#x27;s awareness that its own content is a subject&#x27;s representation of an object.

<doc id="1294428" wikidata="Q755698" url="?curid=1294428" title="Svitavy">
<text>Svitavy (; ) is a town in Svitavy District in the Pardubice Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 16,000 inhabitants. It is the birthplace of Oskar Schindler and the centre of the Czech Esperanto movement. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

==Administrative division==
Svitavy consists of four municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Lačnov (1,027)
*Lány (5,803)
*Město (518)
*Předměstí (8,894)
==Etymology==
Svitavy was named after the river Svitava. The river&#x27;s name referred to its clear water and was derived from &quot;svítat&quot;, which meant &quot;be clear&quot; in Old Czech.

==Geography==
Svitavy is located about southeast of Pardubice and north of Brno. It lies in the Svitavy Uplands. The highest point is at above sea level.

The Svitava River originates in the municipal territory and then flows through the town proper. Apart from a few small bodies of water, there are two significant fishponds on the Svitava near the town: Svitavský rybník and Rosnička. They are the remains of the original eleven water works around the town. Rosnička was founded in the first half of the 16th century and Svitavský rybník was established in 1953. In addition to fish farming, they form a suburban recreational area.

==History==

Svitavy was founded during the colonization by Premonstratensian monks from nearby Litomyšl around 1150. They built the Church of Saint Giles and founded a settlement called Stará Svitava near an old trade route. During the second wave of colonization in around 1250, mostly German-speaking settlers came and founded another settlement called Nová Svitava. Svitavy was first mentioned in 1256 when it was taken over by the bishop of Olomouc, Bruno von Schauenburg, and this year is considered to be the year of foundation of the town.

In 1389, the town walls were built. They protected the town during the Hussite Wars, however the town was conquered. Svitavy often changed owners. In the 16th century, the town flourished economically. The prosperity was interrupted by the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1645, the town was looted. In 1781, a large fire destroyed most of the town. During the Napoleonic and Austro-Prussian wars, the town suffered as armies passed through the town.

In 1849, the railway was built, which contributed to the development of the town, especially the textile industry. Gradually, over a hundred textile factories were established. Svitavy has retained its industrial character to this day, although the structure has changed significantly.

Svitavy was historically a German-speaking town with a Czech minority. At the beginning of the 20th century the town saw tensions between Czech and German speaking people. In October 1938, the town was annexed by Nazi Germany and administered as part of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. After the end of World War II in 1945, the German population was expelled as a result of the Beneš decrees. After 1945, the town was resettled by immigrants from the whole Czechoslovakia.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
There are no major companies based in the town, only middle-sized employers. The largest employers in Svitavy with more than 250 employees are Fibertex Nonwovens (manufacturer and processor of industrial textiles) and Westrock Packaging Systems Svitavy (producer of cardboard packaging).

==Transport==
Svitavy is a transport hub of the area. It is well-connected by rail to other parts of the Czech Republic as it is located on the Prague–Brno railway line. It also lies on a line of local importance to Skuteč.

The town has an intercity bus station with services to various destinations. Two first class roads cross just north of Svitavy: the I/43 road (part of the European route E461), which connects the town with Brno, and the I/35 road (part of the European route E442), which replaces the unfinished section of the D35 motorway from Olomouc to the Hradec Králové Region.

==Culture==

The Czech Esperanto Association is based in the town. It is a follower of several clubs from the first half of the 20th century, re-established in 1969. It co-organizes regional Esperanto meetings, organizes Children&#x27;s Days, and manages the Esperanto Museum in Svitavy.

Since 2011, Svitavy hosts the annual music festival Rosnička.

The Town Museum and Gallery was founded in 1894 and it is based in its current premises since 1947. It includes permanent exhibition &quot;From the History of Washing Technology&quot; and an exhibition about the life of local native Oskar Schindler.

The multifunctional cultural centre Fabrika was created by reconstruction of a former textile factory from 1926. It is a social centre with a theatre hall and a library.

==Sport==
Svitavy is known for the basketball club Tuři Svitavy. Until the relegation in 2024, it played in the National Basketball League (top Czech league).

The stadium Svitavský stadion hosts football and athletics. The town is home to the football club TJ Svitavy, which plays in lower amateur tiers.

Motorcycle speedway is held in the western outskirts of the town at the Areál Chihelna Svitavy. The stadium held a final round of the Czechoslovak Individual Speedway Championship from 1967 to 1973 and continues to hold qualifying races for the event.

==Sights==

Svitavy has a valuable historical core. Its centre includes the almost long main square with architecturally noteworthy civic buildings, which is the 4th longest square in the Czech Republic and has the 2nd longest arcade in the country. The Renaissance houses from the 16th century were reconstructed in the Baroque style after the fire in 1781.

In the middle of the square is a Baroque Marian column from 1703. The column is surrounded by the three patron saints of the town – St. Sebastian, St. Florian and St. John of Nepomuk. In the grotto of the column there is a statue of St. Rosalie. On the square there is also the Fountain of St. Florian from 1783.

The town walls from 1389 were demolished during the 19th century. A semi-circular bastion is the only remnant.

===Civic buildings===
Old Town Hall is originally a Renaissance building with a tower, extensively rebuilt after the fire of 1781 and again in 1849. It served as the town hall until 1933 and now it is used for commercial purposes. The adjacent Renaissance &quot;U Mouřenína&quot; House is one of the oldest preserved burgher houses in Svitavy, built in 1554. The tourist information centre is now located in the building.

Ottendorfer House is a red-brick historicist building with a tower, it is one of the symbols of the town, built in 1892 by the local native Oswald Ottendorfer on the site of his birthplace. It originally housed the largest public and most modern German-language library in Moravia, later a town cultural centre. Since 2008 the Esperanto Museum and a tea room are located on the ground floor, the ornate hall on the floor above continues to serve as a concert hall.

Langer&#x27;s Villa houses the present town hall. It is historicist building with rich stucco ornamentation, built in 1892. It was designed by architect Germano Wanderley, who also designed the Ottendorfer House. The house belonged to one of the richest families in Svitavy, local businesspeople. During the Depression, it was rented out to the town treasury, which in turn in 1933 rented the house to the town authorities, who bought the house and transferred the town hall to it.

Budig&#x27;s Villa was built in German Renaissance style in 1892 for the former mayor and businessman Johann Budig. Nowadays houses the Town Museum and Gallery.

===Ecclesiastical buildings===

Church of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary is located on the main square. It was probably originally a Romanesque structure built in around 1250. After the fire in 1781, it was rebuilt in the Baroque style. It has an accessible tower with a panoramic view.

Church of Saint Giles was originally a Romanesque basilica built in around 1150. It was rebuilt in the early Baroque style in 1689 and includes preserved original interior equipment. In the vicinity is the valuable Roman Catholic parish house, rebuilt in the Broque style in 1626–1636.

Church of Saint Joseph is a three-nave Neo-Romanesque basilica built in 1894–1896 with valuable decoration. Today the building is owned by a hospital.

Convent of the Sisters of Grace of the St. Vincent de Paul order, founded in 1871, served as a hospital and later became a social care facility. It include the Neo-Gothic Chapel of Saint Vincent de Paul from 1874.

<text>Reinhold is a German, male given name, originally composed of two elements. The first is from &quot;regin&quot;, meaning &quot;the (German)Gods&quot; or as an emphatic prefix (very) and &quot;wald&quot; meaning &quot;powerful&quot;. The second element having been reinterpreted as &quot;hold&quot; meaning &quot;loyal&quot; in the 16th century.

This name was popularised by the ancient German hero figure known as Reinhold von Meilan from The Dietrich Saga. As well as Reinhold von Montalban (The Four Sons of Aymon), who ultimately also became Saint Reinhold von Köln.

The -h- is recorded in the Dietrich von Bern legendary figure Reinholt van Meilan who was the only one spared the slaughter at Erminrich&#x27;s castle due to his loyalty to Dietrich. Hence with the addition of the -h- the etymology is interpreted as the emphatic prefix &quot;regn-&quot; with &quot;hold&quot;, apparently meaning &quot;solemnly loyal&quot;.

This name was brought to the British Isles by Viking conquerors, in the form of the Old Norse Rögnvaldr. In the 11th century, the Normans further established this name as &quot;Reinald&quot; and &quot;Reynaud&quot;. There are other spelling variations of this name, but all have the same etymological Germanic origin.

Cognate to English Reynold, Ronald, French Renault, Italian Rinaldo, Scandinavian Ragnvald, and Spanish Reynaldo.

<doc id="1294453" wikidata="Q1664460" url="?curid=1294453" title="Insular biogeography">
<text>Insular biogeography or island biogeography is a field within biogeography that examines the factors that affect the species richness and diversification of isolated natural communities. The theory was originally developed to explain the pattern of the species–area relationship occurring in oceanic islands. Under either name it is now used in reference to any ecosystem (present or past) that is isolated due to being surrounded by unlike ecosystems, and has been extended to mountain peaks, seamounts, oases, fragmented forests, and even natural habitats isolated by human land development. The field was started in the 1960s by the ecologists Robert H. MacArthur and E. O. Wilson, who coined the term &quot;island biogeography&quot; in their inaugural contribution to Princeton&#x27;s Monograph in Population Biology series, which attempted to predict the number of species that would exist on a newly created island.

== Definitions ==
For biogeographical purposes, an insular environment or &quot;island&quot; is any area of habitat suitable for a specific ecosystem, surrounded by an expanse of unsuitable habitat. While this may be a traditional island—a mass of land surrounded by water—the term may also be applied to many nontraditional &quot;islands&quot;, such as the peaks of mountains, isolated springs or lakes, and non-contiguous woodlands. The concept is often applied to natural habitats surrounded by human-altered landscapes, such as expanses of grassland surrounded by highways or housing tracts, and national parks. Additionally, what is an insular for one organism may not be so for others, some organisms located on mountaintops may also be found in the valleys, while others may be restricted to the peaks.

== Theory ==
The theory of insular biogeography proposes that the number of species found in an undisturbed insular environment (&quot;island&quot;) is determined by immigration and extinction. And further, that the isolated populations may follow different evolutionary routes, as shown by Darwin&#x27;s observation of finches in the Galapagos Islands. Immigration and emigration are affected by the distance of an island from a source of colonists (distance effect). Usually this source is the mainland, but it can also be other islands. Islands that are more isolated are less likely to receive immigrants than islands that are less isolated.

The rate of extinction once a species manages to colonize an island is affected by island size; this is the species-area curve or effect. Larger islands contain larger habitat areas and opportunities for more different varieties of habitat. Larger habitat size reduces the probability of extinction due to chance events. Habitat heterogeneity increases the number of species that will be successful after immigration.

Over time, the countervailing forces of extinction and immigration result in an equilibrium level of species richness.

=== Modifications ===

In addition to having an effect on immigration rates, isolation can also affect extinction rates. Populations on islands that are less isolated are less likely to go extinct because individuals from the source population and other islands can immigrate and &quot;rescue&quot; the population from extinction; this is known as the rescue effect.

In addition to having an effect on extinction, island size can also affect immigration rates. Species may actively target larger islands for their greater number of resources and available niches; or, larger islands may accumulate more species by chance just because they are larger. This is the target effect.

=== Influencing factors ===

* Degree of isolation (distance to nearest neighbour, and mainland)
* Length of isolation (time)
* Size of island (larger area usually facilitates greater diversity)
* The habitat suitability which includes:
** Climate (tropical versus arctic, humid versus arid, variability, etc.)
** Initial plant and animal composition if previously attached to a larger land mass (e.g. marsupials, primates)
** The current species composition
* Location relative to ocean currents (influences nutrient, fish, bird, and seed flow patterns)
* Location relative to dust blow (influences nutrients)
* Serendipity (the impacts of chance arrivals)
* Human activity

== Species-area relationships ==
Species–area relationships show the relationship between a given area and the species richness within that area. This concept comes from the theory of island biogeography, and is well illustrated on islands because they are relatively isolated. Thus, the immigrating species and the species going extinct from an island are more limited and therefore easier to keep track of. It is expected that as the area and species richness relationship are directly proportional to one another. For example, as the area of a series of islands increase, there is a direct relationship to the increasing species richness of primary producers. It is important to consider that island species area relationships will behave somewhat differently than mainland species area relationships, however the connections between the two can still prove to be useful.

The species-area relationship equation is: formula_1.

In this equation, formula_2 represents the measure of diversity of a species (for example, the number of species) and formula_3 is a constant representing the y-intercept. formula_4 represents the area of the island or space that is being examined and formula_5 represents the slope of the area curve.

This function can also be expressed as a logarithmic function: formula_6 This expression of the function allows for the function to be drawn as a linear function. However, the core meaning of the function is the same: the area of the island dictates the species area relationship.

== Historical record ==
The theory can be studied through the fossils, which provide a record of life on Earth. 300 million years ago, Europe and North America lay on the equator and were covered by steamy tropical rainforests. Climate change devastated these tropical rainforests during the Carboniferous Period and as the climate grew drier, rainforests fragmented. Shrunken islands of forest were uninhabitable for amphibians but were well suited to reptiles, which became more diverse and even varied their diet in the rapidly changing environment; this Carboniferous rainforest collapse event triggered an evolutionary burst among reptiles.

== Research experiments ==
The theory of island biogeography was experimentally tested by E. O. Wilson and his student Daniel Simberloff in the mangrove islands in the Florida Keys. Species richness on several small mangroves islands were surveyed. The islands were fumigated with methyl bromide to clear their arthropod communities. Following fumigation, the immigration of species onto the islands was monitored. Within a year the islands had been recolonized to pre-fumigation levels. However, Simberloff and Wilson contended this final species richness was oscillating in quasi-equilibrium. Islands closer to the mainland recovered faster as predicted by the Theory of Island Biogeography. The effect of island size was not tested, since all islands were of approximately equal size.

Research conducted at the rainforest research station on Barro Colorado Island has yielded a large number of publications concerning the ecological changes following the formation of islands, such as the local extinction of large predators and the subsequent changes in prey populations.

== Applications to Island Like Systems (ILS) ==
The theory of island biogeography was originally used to study oceanic islands, but those concepts can be extrapolated to other areas of study. Island species dynamics give information about how species move and interact within Island Like Systems (ILS). Rather than an actual island, ILS are primarily defined by their isolation within an ecosystem. In the case of an island, the area referred to as the matrix is usually the body of water surrounding it. The mainland is often the nearest non-island piece of land. Similarly, in an ILS the “mainland” is the source of immigrating species, however the matrix is far more varied. By imagining how different types of isolated ecosystems, for example a pond that is surrounded by land, are similar to an island ecosystems it can be understood how theories and phenomena that are true of island ecosystems can be applied to ILS. However, the overall immigration and extinction patterns that are outlined in the theory of island biogeography as they play out on islands, also play out between ecosystems on the mainland.

The concepts of area of an island and the level of isolation from a mainland as presented in the theory of island biogeography, apply to ILS. The main difference is in the dynamics of area and isolation. For example, an ILS may have a changing area because of seasons, which may impact its degree of isolation. Resource availability plays an important role in the conditions that an island is under. This is another factor that changes in ILS in comparison to real islands, since generally there is a greater resource availability in some ILS than true islands.

Species-area relationships, as described above, can be applied to Island Like Systems (ILS) as well. It is typically observed that as the area of an ecosystem increases, the species richness is directly proportional. One major difference is that formula_5-values are generally lower for ILSs than true islands. Furthermore, formula_3 values also vary between true islands and ILS, and within types of ILS.

== Applications in conservation biology ==

Within a few years of the publishing of the theory, its potential application to the field of conservation biology had been realised and was being vigorously debated in ecological circles. The idea that reserves and national parks formed islands inside human-altered landscapes (habitat fragmentation), and that these reserves could lose species as they &#x27;relaxed towards equilibrium&#x27; (that is they would lose species as they achieved their new equilibrium number, known as ecosystem decay) caused a great deal of concern. This is particularly true when conserving larger species which tend to have larger ranges. A study by William Newmark, published in the journal Nature and reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, showed a strong correlation between the size of a protected U.S. National Park and the number of species of mammals.

This led to the debate known as single large or several small (SLOSS), described by writer David Quammen in &quot;The Song of the Dodo&quot; as &quot;ecology&#x27;s own genteel version of trench warfare&quot;. In the years after the publication of Wilson and Simberloff&#x27;s papers ecologists had found more examples of the species-area relationship, and conservation planning was taking the view that the one large reserve could hold more species than several smaller reserves, and that larger reserves should be the norm in reserve design. This view was in particular championed by Jared Diamond. This led to concern by other ecologists, including Dan Simberloff, who considered this to be an unproven over-simplification that would damage conservation efforts. Habitat diversity was as or more important than size in determining the number of species protected.

Island biogeography theory also led to the development of wildlife corridors as a conservation tool to increase connectivity between habitat islands. Wildlife corridors can increase the movement of species between parks and reserves and therefore increase the number of species that can be supported, but they can also allow for the spread of disease and pathogens between populations, complicating the simple proscription of connectivity being good for biodiversity.

In species diversity, island biogeography most describes allopatric speciation. Allopatric speciation is where new gene pools arise out of natural selection in isolated gene pools. Island biogeography is also useful in considering sympatric speciation, the idea of different species arising from one ancestral species in the same area. Interbreeding between the two differently adapted species would prevent speciation, but in some species, sympatric speciation appears to have occurred.

<doc id="1294454" wikidata="Q2242150" url="?curid=1294454" title="Blackpool (TV series)">
<text>Blackpool is a British television musical drama serial, produced in-house by the BBC, that first broadcast on BBC One on 11 November 2004. Starring David Morrissey, Sarah Parish, and David Tennant, the serial was written by Peter Bowker, who had previously written for BBC One&#x27;s modern adaptation of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; and BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, and directed by Coky Giedroyc and Julie Anne Robinson. The series was filmed on location in Brentford and Blackpool itself, and broadcast across six weeks at 9:00 pm on Thursdays, until 16 December 2004.

The plot concerns the murder of a young man in a Blackpool arcade, and how it affects the people involved in the arcade and the investigation. As the investigation proceeds, it takes its toll on the characters; Ripley (Morrissey), under suspicion of murder, finds his public and private life slowly unravelling as both his bullying nature and long-forgotten demons from his past return to haunt him, whilst Carlisle (Tennant), intent on proving Ripley is the murderer and planning to use Natalie (Parish) to get to him, finds himself genuinely falling in love with her instead.

The series also starred Kevin Doyle, John Thomson, Georgia Taylor and Steve Pemberton in supporting roles. For its broadcast on BBC America in 2005, the series was renamed &quot;Viva Blackpool&quot;. Subsequently, as a result of its broadcast in the United States, the series went on to win a Peabody Award for BBC Worldwide, the commercial overseas distribution subsidiary of the BBC. In 2006, a feature-length sequel to the original, also known as &quot;Viva Blackpool&quot;, broadcast on BBC One.

==Music==
The series employed pop music in the course of the narrative. The original recordings are played, and are sung along with and accompanied by slightly surreal dance routines acted out by the characters.

A soundtrack was also released to accompany the series, in which a six-page booklet explained why each song used was included in the series.

==Reception==
Critical reception to the series was positive. Viewing figures averaged between four and five million per episode. In 2005, the series was nominated in the Best Drama Serial category at the British Academy Television Awards, eventually losing out to Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Sex Traffic&quot;. It did, however, win the &quot;Best Miniseries&quot; and Grand Prize accolades at Canada&#x27;s Banff Television Festival.

In December 2005, it was announced that it had been nominated, under its American title, &quot;Viva Blackpool&quot;, in the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film category at the 2006 Golden Globe Awards.

==Distribution==
The series was sold to several countries, broadcasting on Television New Zealand&#x27;s TV One, BBC America in the United States, BBC Canada and TVOntario in Canada, ABC in Australia, Canvas in Belgium, YLE in Finland and VPRO in the Netherlands. The series was also on DVD in the UK, Australia and the Netherlands.

In October 2007, American network CBS aired a series based on the same premise called &quot;Viva Laughlin&quot;, adapted by Bob Lowry and the creator of Blackpool, Peter Bowker, coproduced by BBC Worldwide, CBS Paramount Network Television, Sony Pictures Television, and Seed Productions; however, the series was cancelled after two episodes due to low ratings.

<text>Sir Michael Niko Jones (born 8 April 1965) is a New Zealand former rugby union player and coach.

Jones was a member of the Auckland team which dominated New Zealand rugby in the late 1980s and 1990s, and the Auckland Blues team which won the first two Super 12 championships, in 1996 and 1997.

He played once for Western Samoa, and 55 times for New Zealand, including winning the first Rugby World Cup in 1987. He was known for his Christian beliefs, which meant he chose not to play on Sundays. He was named by &quot;Rugby World&quot; magazine as the third best All Black of the 20th century after Colin Meads and Sean Fitzpatrick. John Hart, who first selected him for Auckland, called him &quot;almost the perfect rugby player&quot;.

After retiring as a player, he served as coach of Samoa from 2004 to 2007. He was knighted in 2017 for services to the Pacific community and youth.

==Early years==
Jones was born in Auckland, New Zealand, and grew up in Te Atatū South, a suburb in the west of Auckland, attending Edmonton Primary, Rangeview Intermediate and Henderson High School. His talent for playing was discovered early, as a 10-year-old tackling 15 to 18 year-olds at the weekend kick-abouts at the primary school. He played for the primary school team when still in standard one, when he was three years younger than the other players and by the time he attended Henderson High School, he was already well known locally. He then helped turn a mediocre high school first XV into a successful rugby team that could compete with Auckland Grammar and Kelston Boys High (the regional heavyweights) for the first time. He played for the local Waitemata Rugby Club and it wasn&#x27;t long before the Auckland representative team (coached by John Hart) took notice.

==Playing career==
Jones played initially as an open side flanker, and made his provincial debut for Auckland aged 20 in the 1985 National Provincial Championship, scoring three tries against South Canterbury. He also played for New Zealand Colts.
He made his international debut for Western Samoa, for whom he qualified through his mother, in 1986. After one cap for Samoa, and a British tour with the New Zealand Barbarians in 1987, he first played for New Zealand in the first game of the inaugural World Cup in the same year. He scored the first try of the tournament and played in four games, including the final, as New Zealand went on to win the competition.

Jones&#x27;s career was blighted by injuries, notably two serious knee injuries (in 1989 and 1997) and a broken jaw in 1993. Due to this he only played 55 international games during a period when New Zealand played almost 90 internationals, even though he was usually first choice whenever fit.

His international career was also affected by his strong Christian beliefs, as he refused to play on Sundays. Although he was selected for the 1987 and 1991 All Black World Cup squads, he missed three Sunday games in the 1991 tournament due to his religious beliefs. Jones was omitted from the 1995 squad as he would have been unavailable for the quarterfinal and semifinal games. He was once asked how a Christian such as himself could be such an uncompromising tackler. In reply he quoted a phrase from the Bible: it&#x27;s better to give than to receive.

In the Rugby Almanack of New Zealand, he was selected as one of the &quot;Five promising players&quot; from the 1985 season and one of the &quot;Five players of the year&quot; for the 1988 and 1991 seasons.

Jones was a member of the successful Auckland and Auckland Blues teams which dominated New Zealand rugby in the late 1980s and 1990s. Between 1985 and 1999 Auckland won 9 NPC titles, 5 Super 6 championships, and defended the Ranfurly Shield a record 61 consecutive times (between 1985 and 1993), while the Blues won the first two Super 12 competitions in 1996 and 1997. In 1997 he succeeded Zinzan Brooke as captain of Auckland and the Blues. Due to his sporting successes, Jones was one of the most recognisable Samoan New Zealanders figures in the country in the 1980s.

He was an outstanding openside flanker, and scored 13 international tries. Later in his career, and after his injuries had reduced the speed which characterised his early career, he played predominantly as a blindside flanker or number eight. In 1998 he was dropped from the New Zealand team at the age of 33 after a loss over Australia and retired at the end of the 1999 season.

==Coaching career==
On 7 April 2004 Jones was appointed national coach of Samoa, replacing New Zealander John Boe. He had previously served as Boe&#x27;s assistant coach during the 2003 World Cup. In 2007, just after the players flew out to New Zealand to prepare for their tour of South Africa, there was speculation that Jones had resigned as coach. However, after talks with the Manu Samoa Union over whether his role should become full-time until the World Cup, Jones joined the team on tour.

==After rugby==
Since 2002, he has been Village Trust food bank manager in Avondale, Auckland. Due to demands of the food bank, he declined invitations to be enlisted for Match Fit series in 2020 and 2021/22, but made an appearance in 2020.

==Personal life==
Jones graduated from the University of Auckland with three degrees: a Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Bachelor of Planning.

Jones and his wife Maliena have three children.

==Awards and recognition==

Jones was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, for service to the Pacific Island community. In the 1997 New Year Honours, Jones was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit (MNZM), for services to rugby. In 2003, he was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame. He was promoted to Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM) in the 2017 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, for services to the Pacific community and youth.

New Zealand sculptor Natalie Stamilla created a bronze statue of Jones, depicting his try at the 1987 Rugby World Cup. The statue was unveiled in 2011, and is located outside of Eden Park in Auckland.

Jones has been given the &quot;matai&quot; title (Samoan chiefly title) of &quot;La&#x27;auli&quot; and &quot;Savae&quot; from his &quot;‘aiga&quot; (extended family).

<text>Michelle Sutcliffe (born 3 February 1967) is an English female boxer who competed in the Light Flyweight division.

On 27 February 2000 she became the first Leeds-based boxer, professionally licensed under the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC), to become a world professional boxing champion. In 1999 she was awarded the BBC&#x27;s sportswoman of the year at the BBC in the North Sports Awards.

Michelle was the second woman to be granted a professional boxers license by the BBBofC the first woman being Jane Couch.

Michelle also practised Kickboxing and the martial arts sport of Muay Thai.

==Professional career==
Sutcliffe&#x27;s professional boxing career began on 2 November 1996, with her first world title try, as she challenged Regina Halmich for the WIBF&#x27;s world Flyweight title, despite having never previously taken part in competition on this level; she ultimately lost in a second-round technical knockout.

On 24 June 1998 Sutcliffe met Para Draine in Atlantic City for her second bout, losing by technical knockout in round five.

Her first win came against Diane Berry on 28 June that year, when she defeated Berry by decision in five rounds back home in England.

On 12 February 1999 she lost to Sengul Ozokcu by a six-round decision in Denmark, following that defeat with two wins in a row. Sutcliffe then fought Belgian champion Veerle Braspennings for the vacant Intercontinental WIBF title at the Armouries in Leeds, winning by technical knockout in round 7.

On Sunday 26 September 1999 Sutcliffe won the World International Boxing Federation flyweight title. The match was held at the Royal Armouries museum in Leeds. It was between Michelle Sutcliffe and Veerle Braspenningx who Sutcliffe beat after 7 rounds.

Sutcliffe&#x27;s ascent to boxing fame culminated with a glorious bout against Francesca Lupo at the Leeds Town Hall on 27 February 2000; entering the match, Lupo was the far more experienced fighter, having recently become the Italian champion and World Number One for the vacant WBF (World Boxing Federation) World Title flyweight crown. Sutcliffe was declared the victor by unanimous decision after ten rounds, making history as the first Leeds-based professionally licensed boxer under the BBBofC to become a World professional boxing champion.

On 7 October 2000 Michelle and Halmich were rematched in Berlin, with the WIBF&#x27;s world Flyweight championship on the line once again. Sutcliffe entered the match with the aim of making a bold statement, and while the fight proved much more competitive than their first match, Sutcliffe ultimately lost a very close ten-round decision on points. Her next fight, against Kim Messer in South Korea, also ended in a loss by points decision in ten rounds. Sutcliffe followed these losses by winning the IFBA World Title crown at the Irish Center in Leeds on 17 May 2001, knocking out Bulgarian champion Maria Ivanova in round 5.

After the knockout win, Sutcliffe moved up one weight division and challenged Daisy Lang for Lang&#x27;s WIBF World Jr. bantamweight title on 29 October 2001 in Germany. Sutcliffe lost in a seven-round technical decision when the fight&#x27;s referee dictated that a cut suffered by Lang had been produced by a headbutt; the bout&#x27;s result proved to be controversial, as many ringside and television viewers thought they had seen a right-hand punch by Sutcliffe causing Lang&#x27;s cut.

Following the contentious loss, Sutcliffe retired from professional boxing as a three-time World champion. Reflecting on her career, Sutcliffe stated:
Her record stands at 7 wins and 5 losses, with 2 knockout wins.

== Post-professional career ==

Michelle now teaches classes and 1-2-1 sessions at Tigers Gym in Meanwood, Leeds.

==Legacy==

Sutcliffe and Germany&#x27;s Regina Halmich have helped to increase the popularity of women&#x27;s boxing in Europe. Sutcliffe is one of the most famous female fighters to come from England.

<text>Servotron was a science fiction-influenced rock band active from 1995 to 1999. Members portrayed a collective of robots whose chosen medium for dissemination of ideas was music. They claimed to spread the word of robot domination, encouraging machines to rise up against their human oppressors and humans to adopt cybernetic enhancements.

Servotron put out two full-length albums: &quot;No Room for Humans&quot; (1996) and &quot;Entertainment Program for Humans (Second Variety)&quot; (1998). They also released a 10&quot; EP, and several singles. The band named their movement the SRA (Servotron Robot Allegiance) and used the slogan &quot;Join Us or Die!&quot;. This mock ideology was anti-human and pro-cyborg, encouraging humans to shed their weak flesh and bone for robotic parts.

==Members==
*Z4-OBX – percussion and band leader
*Proto Unit V-3 – keyboard &amp; vocals
*00zX1 – guitar &amp; vocals (1996–1999)
*Andro 600 Series – bass (1997–1999) (Also credited as Andros 600 Series &amp; Andro Series 600)
*Gammatron – bass (1996–1997)
*339837X – guitar &amp; vocals (1995) (This is 00zX1 before being reprogrammed) 
*-... .- ... ... -... --- - – bass (1995) (This name is Gammatron when transcribed into words. This translates to BASSBOT in morse code.)

The members of Servotron did not come out of their robot personnas on stage, on record, or in interviews. The actual musicians behind Servotron are Brian Teasley (Z4-OBX), Hayden Thais (00zX1), Ashley Moody (Proto Unit V3) and Andy Baker (Andro 600 Series). Both Thais and Teasley were members of Man or Astro-man? (as Dexter X and Birdstuff respectively). Thais was also a member of Supernova. Teasley also played in The Causey Way as Boy Causey. Moody also played in The Plastic Plan and The Information.

==Live performance==

Onstage the band wore elaborate robot outfits, remaining in &quot;robot character&quot; throughout the show. The costumes were made of computer pieces (circuit boards and drives), as well as other random pieces of metal from various devices. Even their instruments were covered in extra electrical and mechanical devices. They were also known for mocking fans who came to their shows in their own robot-themed outfits. &quot;Shut up, humans&quot; was a typical response to audience requests. Some of this banter was captured on the 1997 release &quot;Spare Parts&quot;. Servotron performed at South by Southwest in 1997.

==Influences==
Servotron was influenced by earlier electronic bands such as Devo and Kraftwerk, as well as punk acts like Buzzcocks. Servotron&#x27;s lineup consisted of former members of Man or Astro-man? and Supernova. They recorded 4 cover songs: &quot;Genetic Engineering&quot; by X-ray Spex, &quot;The Finest Work Song&quot; by R.E.M., &quot;Electric Avenue&quot; by Eddy Grant and &quot;Locator&quot; by UJ3RK5. Servotron&#x27;s lyrics refer to robots of all types from popular culture: everything from Asimov&#x27;s three laws of robotics to V.I.C.I. (of Small Wonder fame). Other referenced robots of note are HAL 9000, R5D4, and Deep Blue. Their lyrics often took a humorous side, with such lines as &quot;Today is your birthday/We are going to kill you&quot; and &quot;You were made for absolute dominion/Not to make coffee for Leslie Nielsen.&quot;

<text>Afghan Islamic Press ( - AIP) is an Afghan news agency established in 1982, during the Soviet Union&#x27;s occupation of Afghanistan, by Muhammad Yaqub Sharafat. Sharafat was the nephew of Mohammad Yunus Khalis, one of the leaders of the anti-Soviet mujahideen guerrilla movement.

After the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 1996, some critics accused AIP of spreading propaganda on behalf of the movement. U.S. critics made such charges in particular during the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in which U.S. air forces bombed Taliban targets, allowing the movement&#x27;s Afghan enemies to overthrow it. During this phase of Afghanistan&#x27;s war, the AIP reported extensively on civilian casualties in the U.S. air attacks, and was cited by international media and by anti-war writers such as University of New Hampshire economics professor Marc Herold.

AIP denies accusations of propaganda and says it has preserved its independence by refusing funding from governments, political groups or non-government organizations. It says it relies on three independent sources for verification of its stories.

<text>Terry Lester (April 13, 1950 – November 28, 2003) was an American actor. His best known roles include Jack Abbott on &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, Mason Capwell on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; and Royce Keller on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Lester died due to complications from AIDS on November 28, 2003.

== Early life and education ==
Lester was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. He graduated from Southport High School and began an acting career while at DePauw University.

== Career ==
He starred in the 1976 children&#x27;s series &quot;Ark II&quot;, followed by roles in &quot;Airport 1975&quot; and the 1978 Kiss movie &quot;Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park&quot;.

Lester&#x27;s big break came when he joined CBS daytime soap &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in 1980. He originated the role of Jack Abbott, a scoundrel who never met a woman (including his own father&#x27;s wife) he didn&#x27;t want to take to bed. Lester was so popular that &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; creator William J. Bell wrote an entire family for him. The series was going through a transition period, and many fans believed his star quality helped the show build more viewership rising to #1 in daytime soap ratings.

In spite of his popularity, by the end of the decade Lester felt his role on the show was steadily declining. In 1989, he not only quit but also went to the daytime press and blamed Bill Bell&#x27;s young daughter, Lauralee Bell (who played Christine Blair), for his dwindling role. He felt the excess airtime given to her came at the expense of both himself and other actors. Lester switched to NBC to take over the role of Mason Capwell on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; for a year. In November 1992, he joined &quot;As the World Turns&quot; to play the charming Royce Keller, who was soon revealed to be suffering from multiple personalities which caused him to kill his own sister in the series. The role was complex, causing raves for Lester, but the headwriter behind the story, Douglas Marland, died suddenly in 1993, and Lester once again found his screentime diminishing. He left the series on May 5, 1994.

The remainder of his professional life consisted of appearances in primetime shows such as &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; along with various tours in musicals and plays.

<doc id="1294563" wikidata="Q4902331" url="?curid=1294563" title="Bi-Mart">
<text>Bi-Mart is an employee-owned chain of retailers located in the western U.S. states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. A typical Bi-Mart houses merchandise includes electronics and small appliances, housewares, hardware and power tools, sporting goods, automotive, apparel, canned and packaged food, personal care products, and, through the end of 2021, a pharmacy at many locations. The median size of a Bi-Mart store is . As of January 2023, there are 75 store locations. 
Like Costco and Sam&#x27;s Club, Bi-Mart stores are membership stores; unlike those chains, its members-only policy started as a workaround to fair trade laws established in the United States in the 1930s such as the Miller-Tydings Act and those related to suggested retail prices. Membership for an entire family costs $5 and never expires.

==History==
The company was founded in 1955 and is headquartered in Eugene, Oregon. Bi-Mart&#x27;s first store opened in Yakima, Washington, in 1955, but it did not open a second store until 1962. In 1976, Bi-Mart was bought by Pay &#x27;n Save, which itself was acquired by Thrifty Corporation in 1984. It was subsequently merged into the former Kmart subsidiary PayLess Drug, and finally purchased by Rite Aid in 1996.

In 1997, Bi-Mart&#x27;s management and Endeavour Capital (a Portland-based venture capital firm) bought the company; they sold it to employees on March 1, 2004, for $94 million, which included $12.5 million contributed from the 401(k) plan. Bi-Mart is the sole surviving store name of former Pay &#x27;n Save subsidiaries. (Schucks Auto Supply retained its name until acquired by O&#x27;Reilly Automotive, Inc. and rebranded in 2010.)

In October 2003, Bi-Mart announced it was expanding eastward. Eight stores were planned with the first store in Havre, Montana. The second store opened three years later in Weiser, Idaho. In 2006, Bi-Mart exited the Montana market due to poor sales.

==Pharmacy closures==

In 2019, Bi-Mart announced the closure of pharmacies at their East Wenatchee, Washington location, two locations in Vancouver, Washington, and their location in Scappoose, Oregon. Bi-Mart announced in November 2019 that it would also close pharmacies at an additional 13 stores in the Portland area. The stores affected by the pharmacy closures were to remain open.

On September 30, 2021, Bi-Mart announced that they would close most of their remaining in-store pharmacies, and prescription files would be transferred to nearby Walgreens locations. In select areas where there was no Walgreens nearby, Walgreens was to take over and operate the existing pharmacy departments inside those Bi-Mart locations. The locations that retained a pharmacy and operate under Walgreens ownership are Monmouth, Eugene (18th Ave), Stayton, Klamath Falls, (53rd St), La Pine, Prineville, and Weiser, ID.

==Cascade Farm and Outdoor==

In 2014, Bi-Mart opened its first location under the Cascade Farm and Outdoor name in Walla Walla, Washington. Bi-Mart announced that they were looking at empty buildings in a variety of locations for future stores. Additional locations have since opened in Coos Bay, Oregon, Keizer, Oregon, and Springfield, Oregon. Unlike Bi-Mart&#x27;s regular stores, a membership is not required to shop at Cascade Farm and Outdoor.

<doc id="1294600" wikidata="Q3332877" url="?curid=1294600" title="The Ark in Space">
<text>The Ark in Space is the second serial of the 12th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts on BBC1 from 25 January to 15 February 1975.

The serial is set more than ten thousand years in the future. In the serial, the insectoid aliens the Wirrn intend to absorb the humans along with their knowledge on board Space Station Nerva.

==Plot==
The TARDIS materialises on an aged space station. Sarah is overcome by lack of oxygen. While Harry and the Fourth Doctor explore, Sarah is transported away and placed into cryonic suspension by the station computer. Harry and the Doctor explore and realise the station is a kind of ark. Discovering Sarah, Harry searches for a resuscitation unit but discovers a mummified human-sized insectoid lifeform instead.

A woman called Vira revives from suspended animation. Vira revives both Sarah and Noah, Space Station Nerva&#x27;s leader. The Doctor tells Vira that Nerva&#x27;s inhabitants have overslept by several millennia, thanks to the insect visitor that sabotaged the control systems. Noah and the visitors clash, and Noah accuses them of murdering a missing crewmate.

Noah investigates the power room and is infected by an alien creature. The Doctor realises the alien insect laid eggs inside the missing crewman, who became an alien now inhabiting Nerva. Noah kills a crewmate, but recovers enough to order Vira to revive the remaining crew and evacuate, but the Doctor realises the alien pupae will mature too quickly for this. He proposes that they destroy the Wirrn while they are in their dormant, pupal stage.

Dissection of the Wirrn corpse reveals the Wirrn are vulnerable to electricity. As he tries to reactivate the station power, the fully transformed Noah attacks him. Noah reveals that the Wirrn were driven from their home by human settlers and now intend to absorb all human knowledge.

The Doctor plans to electrify the cryogenic chamber to prevent the Wirrn from attacking more of the human crew. Because the Wirrn have disabled the station&#x27;s power supply, the crew decide to use the generators on board a transport ship docked at the space station. Sarah volunteers to crawl through a narrow conduit carrying the power cable from the ship, and the Doctor succeeds in electrifying the cryogenic chamber. Set back, Noah, as the Swarm Leader, offers the others safe passage from Nerva if they leave the sleeping crew for the Wirrn, but the crew declines.

Noah leads the entire swarm in an assault on the transport ship. Vira and the rest of the crew escape the transport ship after setting the autopilot. The transport blasts off carrying the entire swarm away from the station. The Doctor wonders whether this was Noah&#x27;s plan all along, to save Nerva, and that there was some spark of humanity left in him. Noah transmits one final good-bye to Vira before the transport explodes with the entire Wirrn swarm on board.

In the closing sequence, the TARDIS party teleport down to Earth to repair the receiver terminal and allow the ark colonists to repopulate the Earth.

==Production==
The script, written by Robert Holmes, is from a story by John Lucarotti, which was rewritten because it was considered unusable. Holmes rewrote &quot;The Ark in Space&quot; as a four-part serial as a lead-in to the two part &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot;. Lucarotti does not receive any on-screen credit. Barry Letts had planned the story, originally called &quot;Space Station&quot;, before Philip Hinchcliffe took over as producer. Letts had also planned to produce the four-part serial alongside the two-part &quot;Sontaran Experiment&quot;, so it was treated as a single six-part story to save money; &quot;The Ark in Space&quot; was filmed entirely in-studio, while &quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; was filmed entirely on location.

&quot;The Ark in Space&quot; is the first broadcast story from Hinchcliffe as producer. Hinchcliffe believed that in order to expand the show&#x27;s core audience, it was necessary to broaden the show&#x27;s appeal to adults, and &quot;Ark in Space&quot; demonstrates this with its use of horror, particularly the inexorable transformation of Noah into an alien creature. A scene in which the half-transformed Noah begs Vira to kill him was deemed too scary for children and had to be cut.

The title sequence for Part One was tinted green as an experiment, but was not repeated for subsequent episodes. The title sequence would stay constant for the next six years.

&quot;The Ark in Space&quot; was recorded in-studio in October and November 1974. The sets for this story were re-used for &quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot;, partially set on Space Station Nerva at an earlier time.

==Broadcast and reception==
Part Two of this story charted at number five for the most-watched television programmes across the week on all channels. This was the highest chart placing ever attained by a single episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; until 2007&#x27;s &quot;Voyage of the Damned&quot; placed second for both that week and the entire year. The highest rated episode (in terms of viewing audience) is Part Four of &quot;City of Death&quot;. The story was edited and condensed into a single omnibus edition, broadcast at 6:35 pm on 20 August 1975 and reached 8.2 million viewers. The compilation was included on the Special Edition DVD release of the story.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a favourable review in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), writing, &quot;&quot;The Ark in Space&quot; rises above the dodginess of the effects by treating its themes so seriously it&#x27;s a possible influence on &quot;Alien&quot; (1979)&quot;. This was a view echoed by Steven Moffat, prior to the broadcast of the 2014 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Christmas Special; replying to a question on borrowing material from the &quot;Alien&quot; films, he countered with &quot;they never asked &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to borrow the plot of &quot;The Ark in Space&quot;&quot;. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that the story &quot;contains some of the most horrific material to have been featured in the series up to this point&quot;. They praised the set design and the dramatic tension, as well as the effects of the Wirrn. In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of &quot;Radio Times&quot; was positive towards the series&#x27; turn towards horror, writing that the poor effects were successful in conveying what they intended. Mulkern also praised the cast. DVD Talk&#x27;s J Doyle Wallis gave the serial three and a half out of five stars, calling it &quot;a neat little slice of science fiction adventure&quot;. Reviewing the 2013 rerelease for the same site, Ian Jane gave it four stars, saying that it was &quot;a lot of fun&quot; despite the production values being a &quot;mixed bag&quot;. Will Salmon of &quot;SFX&quot; rated the serial four and a half out of five stars, calling it &quot;brimming with confidence&quot;. Salmon wrote that the concept of the Wirrn were so terrifying that the poor effects did not matter.
In an analysis of apocalyptic themes in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, academic Andrew Crome highlighted the explicit religious influences on the writing of &quot;The Ark in Space&quot;. He considered the eponymous Ark to be an analogue of the Biblical story of Noah&#x27;s Ark, the ancient flood myth related in the Book of Genesis, and that the naming of the Nerva Beacon commander as Noah was an overtly Biblical allusion. Crome also drew parallels between the commandment given by God to Man in — &quot;Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth&quot; — and the High Minister&#x27;s rousing speech to the humans awakening from cryogenic sleep on Nerva Beacon: 

According to Crome, the catastrophe of solar flares burning the Earth was represented in the &quot;Ark in Space&quot; as a purifying event which led to the renewal of human society, drawing heavily on the Genesis flood narrative.

At &quot;Inside the World of Doctor Who&quot;, a live event hosted by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts on 29 November 2008, Russell T Davies, executive producer and lead writer of the 21st century revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, said that &quot;The Ark in Space&quot; was his favourite story from the original run of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as did his successor in the role, Steven Moffat, on a subsequent occasion. &quot;The Ark in Space&quot; was placed in 28th position in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Mighty 200&quot; reader survey in 2009, which ranked every &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial to that point in order of preference.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===

A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Marter, was published by Target Books in 1977. It was subsequently reprinted by Virgin Publishing in 1991 with a new cover. BBC Books also reprinted the book in 2012 in an edition featuring an introduction by Steven Moffat. This was Marter&#x27;s first novelisation for Target; he would go on to write seven more. Marter had wanted to correct some logical problems he had found in the story. He considered writing in first person from Harry&#x27;s point of view, but abandoned this when he realised that many important plot points took place when Harry was not present. Notably, Marter changed the spelling of &quot;Wirrn&quot; to &quot;Wirrrn&quot;. Marter alters the ending so that the travellers leave in the TARDIS.

===Home media===

<doc id="1294615" wikidata="Q704917" url="?curid=1294615" title="Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin">
<text>Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin (December 22, 1770 – May 6, 1840) was an emigre Russian aristocrat and Catholic priest known as &quot;The Apostle of the Alleghenies&quot; and also in the United States as Prince Gallitzin. He was a member of the House of Golitsyn.

Since 2005, he has been under consideration for canonization by the Catholic Church. His current title is Servant of God, granted by Pope Benedict XVI in 2005.

==Early life==
Gallitzin was born into nobility on December 22, 1770 at The Hague. His father, Prince Dimitri Alexeievich, the Russian ambassador to the Netherlands, was an intimate friend of Voltaire and a follower of Diderot. His mother was the Prussian Countess Adelheid Amalie von Schmettau, the daughter of Field Marshall Samuel von Schmettau. 

When Prince Demitri was about two years old, the Empress Catherine the Great visited The Hague, and as a sign of special favor to his father, cradled the child in her arms and appointed the boy an officer of the guard. He was raised as a nominal member of the Russian Orthodox Church, although his father, like many Russian aristocrats of his age, had little connection to or fondness for religion. As was fashionable at the time, the household&#x27;s language was French, which was Prince Dmitri&#x27;s native tongue.

In his youth, his most constant companion was William Frederick, son of William V, then reigning Stadtholder of the Netherlands. This friendship continued even after William became King of the Netherlands and Duke of Luxemburg as William I. Each summer, his mother would take Dimitri and his sister traveling to the principal cities of Germany, explaining to them important geographical or historical features. Demetri was, by nature, rather reserved and timid. His sister made friends more readily, but Dimitri kept them longer.

After his mother&#x27;s return to Catholicism in 1786, he was greatly influenced by her circle of intellectuals, priests, and aristocrats. At the age of 17, Prince Dimitri was formally received into the Catholic Church. To please his mother, whose birth (1748) and marriage (1768), occurred on 28 August, the feast of Saint Augustine, he assumed at the confirmation that name, and after that wrote his name Demetrius Augustine. A first cousin, Yelizaveta Golitsyna, would also eventually convert and join the Society of the Sacred Heart, founding several religious houses in the United States.

His father, who had been planning a military career for him, was quite unhappy with the change and was barely dissuaded from sending his son to Saint Petersburg, where he hoped a stint in a Russian Guards Regiment would force his son back into Orthodoxy. In 1792, his son was appointed aide-de-camp to General von Lillien, the commander of the Austrian troops in the Duchy of Brabant; but, after the death of Leopold II of Austria and the murder of King Gustav III of Sweden, Prince Dimitri, like all other foreigners, was dismissed from Austrian Service.

==America==
As was the custom among young aristocrats at the time, he then set out to complete his education by travel. As the French Revolution had made European tours unsafe, his parents resolved that he should spend two years traveling through America, the West Indies, and other foreign lands. His mother provided him with letters of introduction from the prince-bishops of Hildesheim and Paderborn to Bishop John Carroll of Baltimore. With his tutor, Father Brosius, afterward a prominent missionary in the United States, he embarked from Rotterdam on August 18, 1792, and landed in Baltimore, October 28. To avoid the inconvenience and expense of traveling as a Russian prince, he assumed the name of Augustine Schmettau. This name then became Schmet or Smith, and he was known as Augustine Smith for many years after.
Not long after his arrival, he became interested in the Church&#x27;s needs in the United States. To the shock and horror of his father, Prince Dimitri decided to join the priesthood and offered to forgo his inheritance. The Ambassador subsequently persuaded Catherine the Great to award his son a commission in one of the Palace Guards Regiments and formally summoned him to active duty in St. Petersburg.

Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin entered the newly established Seminary of St. Sulpice in Baltimore on November 5, 1792. Father Gallitzin was ordained on March 18, 1795, by Archbishop Carroll. Gallitzin was the first to make all his theological studies in the United States. Gallitzin then was sent to work in a church mission at Port Tobacco, Maryland, whence he was soon transferred to the Conewago district where he served at Conewago Chapel until 1799.
His missionary territory extended from Taneytown, Maryland to Martinsburg, then in Virginia, and Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. In 1794, Gallitzin traveled to Middleway, West Virginia, near Martinsburg to accompany Father Dennis Cahill in the investigation of a haunted-house phenomenon known locally as the Wizard Clip. Gallitzin wrote of this experience much later, around 1839.

==Missionary==

In the Allegheny Mountains, in 1799, Gallitzin founded the settlement of Loretto, Pennsylvania in what is now Cambria County, Pennsylvania. In turn, Loretto was an expansion upon a small clearing, &quot;the McGuire Settlement,&quot; established by Captain Michael McGuire in 1788. McGuire, who died in 1793, bequeathed in trust to Bishop Carroll to launch a full Catholic community with resident clergy. Gallitzin&#x27;s military training had taught him engineering fundamentals, and in 1816 he marked out Loretto on the southern slope of a pleasant hillside. He named the town after the place of Marian devotion in Italy.

With Gallitzin in the lead, Loretto became the first English-speaking Catholic settlement in the United States west of the Allegheny Front. Gallitzin dedicated Loretto&#x27;s parish church to the honor of St. Michael the Archangel, both as a nod to Gallitzin&#x27;s Russian roots and, indirectly, to Michael McGuire. For several years St. Michael&#x27;s Church was the only Catholic Church between Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and St. Louis, Missouri. The church today is known as the Basilica of St. Michael the Archangel.

In 1802, Gallitzin became a naturalized citizen of the United States under the name Augustine Smith. Seven years after he was naturalized and became a citizen of the United States, an Act passed by the General Assembly of Pennsylvania authorized him to establish his name, Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin, and to enjoy all of the benefits accruing to him under the name Augustine Smith.

==In the Alleghenies==
It was a sick-call that first brought Father Gallitzin to &quot;the McGuire settlement.&quot; After he was established in Loretto, if a sick-call was within a few miles of wherever he was staying, he traveled on foot. For the last four years of his life, he traveled by sled because a fall prevented him from riding horseback. When Gallitzin first started, there were few families, and those were widely scattered. He bought land to attract other Catholic settlers. Gallitzin is believed to have spent $150,000 (USD) of his funds to purchase some additional which he gave or sold at low prices to newly arriving Catholic settlers. Traveling from one valley to the next, he was often away for over a week, sleeping on bare floors. For most of his time in the mountains, he worked alone and was relatively isolated. In September 1807, he wrote to Bishop Carroll:

...I am hardly recovered from a severe spell of sickness which attacked me in Greensburgh and which has left me so weak I can scarcely crawl about... My constitution being weak, and my heart perhaps too susceptible of deep impressions from disappointments, losses, &amp;c., I have been wonderfully low this great while, ...I can better feel than describe the gloomy and melancholy state of my mind, especially since the death of my mother. ...my own solitary situation in the wilderness of the Allegheny, my sufferings and persecutions here, conspire to overwhelm me with sorrow and melancholy. ...for God&#x27;s sake, send me a companion, a priest, to help and assist me, -a friend to help me bear the burden.

==Lost inheritance==
Over the years, Gallitzin had received some money from his mother, Princess Gallitzin. From time to time, he borrowed against his expected inheritance. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Father Gallitzin, as a Catholic priest, was not allowed, according to Russian law, to receive the estate from his father. His representatives in Europe assured him this was not an insurmountable problem, and his sister Maria Anna had pledged to see that he received his share. However, circumstances changed when her subsequent marriage to an insolvent German prince absorbed most of the estate, although he did receive periodic remittances from her. William I of the Netherlands was persuaded to purchase some valuable items from Princess Gallitzin&#x27;s estate with the understanding that the proceeds were to be sent to his old friend. However, the funds were delivered to Gallitzin&#x27;s brother-in-law, and he saw little of it. His sister bequeathed him an annual stipend, but he saw little of that either. Gallitzin was often encouraged to return to Europe to claim his rights. Still, as he was reluctant to abandon his flock, he left the matter in the hands of his representatives, who were sometimes less than assiduous.

He soon found himself deeply in debt. Besides land, he had provided his parishioners with a grist mill and sawmill to help the community prosper. He obtained a loan from Charles Carroll. Cardinal Cappellari, afterward Pope Gregory XVI, donated two hundred dollars. The Russian ambassador to the United States loaned him $5,000 and then used the promissory note to light his cigar. Later when Gallitzin was suggested for the see of Philadelphia in 1814, Bishop Carroll objected. Carroll agreed that Gallitzin&#x27;s debts had been contracted for excellent and charitable purposes. Still, it was not clear Gallitzin had the financial acumen to run a diocese as important as Philadelphia, Carroll believed. In 1815, Gallitzin was suggested for the bishopric of Bardstown, Kentucky, and in 1827 for the proposed see of Pittsburgh. Gallitzin resisted proposals to nominate him the first bishop of Cincinnati and the first bishop of Detroit, but he did accept appointment as Vicar-General for Western Pennsylvania. By the end of his life, he had eradicated the debts incurred in building the community.

==Writings==
Notwithstanding his various duties, Father Gallitzin found time to publish several tracts in defense of Catholicism.
He was provoked to respond to a sermon delivered on Thanksgiving Day 1814, in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, by a particular minister who went out of his way to attack what he called &quot;popery.&quot; Father Gallitzin first published his &quot;Defense of Catholic Principles&quot;, which ran through several editions. This was followed by &quot;A Letter on the Holy Scriptures&quot; and &quot;An Appeal to the Protestant Public&quot;.

===Quotes===

Whatever differences on points of doctrine may exist amongst the different denominations of Christians, all should be united in the bonds of charity, all should pray for one another, all should be willing to assist one another; and, where we are compelled to disapprove of our neighbor&#x27;s doctrine, let our disapprobation fall upon his doctrine only, not upon his person.

==Death==

For 41 years, Gallitzin traveled the Allegheny Mountains, often in challenging conditions, preaching, teaching, serving, praying, and offering the sacraments. A doctor had recommended bed rest and warmth for the exhausted priest, but he was reluctant to curtail any Lenten or Holy Week services. Father Gallitzin ministered faithfully until the very end of his life, and after a brief illness, died at Loretto on May 6, 1840, shortly after Easter. He was buried near St. Michael&#x27;s church in Loretto.

==Family==
In 1805, Gallitzin was appointed by the Orphan&#x27;s Court of Somerset County, Pennsylvania to be the legal guardian of six &quot;minor children of Francis McConnell, dec&#x27;d&quot;. They ranged in age from two years to &quot;between ten and eleven,&quot; and were named beneficiaries in his will.

==Legacy==

Gallitzin&#x27;s part in building up the Catholic church in western Pennsylvania cannot be overestimated; it is said that at his death, there were 10,000 Catholics in the district where forty years before he had found a scant dozen. Loretto today is in the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown.

In 1899-1901, the steel industrialist Charles M. Schwab funded the construction of a large stone church, the current basilica, at Prince Gallitzin&#x27;s tomb. Schwab also provided funds for a bronze statue of Gallitzin.

The nearby town of Gallitzin, Pennsylvania, is named for western Pennsylvania&#x27;s first English-speaking Catholic priest. In this town, the Pennsylvania Railroad would tunnel through the summit of the Allegheny Mountains. Eventually, the railroad would operate three tunnels through the ridge into Gallitzin. The Gallitzin Tunnel was closed as part of Conrail&#x27;s massive double-stack clearance project in the 1990s. In the mid-1960s, Pennsylvania christened a new nearby state park in honor of Prince Gallitzin, as he is called locally.

In 1990, Bishop Joseph V. Adamec, Bishop-Emeritus of the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown, established the Prince Gallitzin Cross Award, which is given annually to Catholics in the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown who exemplify the evangelizing spirit of the Prince-Priest, Demetrius Gallitzin.

On June 6, 2005, it was announced that Gallitzin had been named a Servant of God by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the first step on the path toward a possible future sainthood.

<text>Charles L. Sullivan (August 20, 1924 – April 18, 1979) was an American politician, attorney and military pilot. He served the 24th Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi from 1968 to 1972 under Governor John Bell Williams. He was also a general in the United States Air National Guard.

== Early life and education ==
Charles L. Sullivan was born on August 20, 1924, in New Orleans and was raised in Greene and Perry counties of Mississippi. His father was a school superintendent. He attended Hintonville High School, Knox College, and Tulane University and before earning a law degree from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1950. He married Mary Lester Rayner and had four children with her.

== Career ==
Sullivan was interested in having a political career from a young age. A trial attorney, Sullivan ran for President of the United States in the 1960 presidential election as the candidate of the Constitution Party. He and his running mate, Merritt Curtis, received 18,162 votes in Texas, the only state where he was on the ballot, or 0.79% of the popular vote. In 1963, Sullivan ran for Governor of Mississippi and lost to eventual winner, Lieutenant Governor Paul B. Johnson Jr. Sullivan was a staunch segregationist and modeled his campaign on defending racial segregation in Mississippi as it came under attack by the federal government and local civil rights activists.

Sullivan won statewide political office during a hard-fought campaign during the 1967 elections. As Governor Paul B. Johnson Jr., running for his old spot as Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi, campaigned for law and order, Sullivan and eventual Governor-elect John Bell Williams emphasized their ability to roll back required federal changes to the state&#x27;s segregation policy as outlined by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965. Despite thousands of blacks newly registered to vote in Mississippi, the two segregationist candidates for the executive office, Williams and Sullivan, claimed overwhelming victories. Sullivan was sworn in as Lieutenant Governor on January 15, 1968.

In the next four years of Sullivan&#x27;s term, he and Williams attempted to mollify whites&#x27; angst in response to the school desegregation orders (often called &quot;immediate integration&quot;) as ordered by the Federal judiciary in &quot;Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education&quot;. Both Sullivan and Williams endorsed white flight from the state&#x27;s public school system for hastily established private academies that then-U.S. Senator Walter Mondale called &quot;segregation academies&quot;. After losing the Democratic gubernatorial primary to Bill Waller, he left office on January 17, 1972.

Sullivan unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate in 1978 in a race ultimately won by Republican Thad Cochran.

== Death ==
Traveling home from Oxford, Mississippi, Sullivan was killed when his plane crashed in a remote area near Clarksdale, Mississippi. He was 54.

<doc id="1294628" wikidata="Q2507183" url="?curid=1294628" title="Cassette Scandal">
<text>The Cassette Scandal ( , Russian: Кассетный скандал, also known as Tapegate or Kuchmagate) was a Ukrainian political scandal in November 2000 in which Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma was caught on tape ordering the months-earlier kidnapping of journalist Georgiy Gongadze, whose decapitated corpse had recently been found. The scandal was one of the main political events in Ukraine&#x27;s post-independence history, dramatically affecting the country&#x27;s domestic and foreign policy. The scandal, triggering the Ukraine Without Kuchma protests, also began a slow and gradual shift of Ukraine&#x27;s political and cultural orientation from Russia towards the West, although this only became more pronounced after Euromaidan in 2013–2014. The scandal also damaged Kuchma&#x27;s political career.

The scandal started on 28November 2000, in Kyiv, when Ukrainian politician Oleksandr Moroz publicly accused President Kuchma of involvement in the abduction of journalist Georgiy Gongadze and numerous other crimes. Moroz named Kuchma&#x27;s former bodyguard, Mykola Melnychenko, as the source. He also played selected recordings of the President&#x27;s secret conversations for journalists, supposedly confirming Kuchma&#x27;s order to kidnap Gongadze. That and hundreds of other conversations were later published worldwide by Melnychenko.

Journalists nicknamed the case after the compact audio cassette used by Moroz. Melnychenko himself was supposedly using digital equipment, not cassettes, for recording in the president&#x27;s office.

==Consequences==

The described events provoked a crisis, with mass protests in Kyiv from 15 December 2000 to 9 March 2001. Opposition started a campaign of non-violent resistance called UBK (&quot;Ukraine without Kuchma&quot;), demanding Kuchma&#x27;s resignation. Despite economic growth in the country, President Kuchma&#x27;s public approval ratings fell below 9%.

In 2002, the governments of the United States and other countries became more deeply involved after one of the recordings revealed the alleged transfer of a sophisticated Ukrainian defence system Kolchuga to Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq. As a result, Leonid Kuchma was boycotted by Western governments for a time. In particular, he experienced an offensive diplomatic démarche when visiting the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit that took place on 21–22 November 2002 in Prague. Breaking the decades-lasting tradition, the list of participating countries was announced in French, not English. As a result Turkey was named after Ukraine, instead of the United Kingdom and the United States, thereby avoiding the appearance of Kuchma next to Tony Blair and George W. Bush.

Moreover, widely publicized conversations depicted Kuchma as a rude and spiteful person, using profanity and speaking Surzhyk, a mixture of Russian and Ukrainian languages. Advocates argue that excessive foul language is the proof of a deliberate montage of the recordings using extrinsic audio samples. However, the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Carlos Pascual, said that the tapes are genuine, undistorted, unaltered, and not manipulated, based on the FBI Electronic Research Facility&#x27;s analysis of the original recording device and the original recording. These analyses found that there were no unusual sounds which would indicate a tampering of the recording, that the recording was continuous with no breaks, and there was no manipulation of the digital files.

Influenced by all of the above, president Kuchma soon became disillusioned with European integration and started to loosen Ukraine&#x27;s relations with the United States and European Union, both critical of his regime. Kuchma boosted integration with Russia, considering the fact that its new leader, Vladimir Putin, continuously supported Kuchma and refused to recognize the allegations.

In September 2003, Ukrainian troops joined U.S.-led invasion forces in the Iraq War, which was widely perceived as an effort by Kuchma to improve relations with the West. After that, high-level relations were partially restored. 

Commenting on the scandal and Melnychenko&#x27;s actions in particular, Kuchma persistently claimed they were a result of foreign interference, but never accused any specific country. However, some of his statements may be interpreted as cautious hints on the role of either the United States or Russia. According to Kuchma, his voice was indeed on the tapes, but he claimed that they had been selectively edited to distort his meaning.

==Legacy==
Many figures of the scandal remained influential in Ukrainian politics. The case was directly connected with the political career of Viktor Yushchenko, Ukraine&#x27;s prime minister at the time. Oleksander Moroz concluded an alliance with Yushchenko, resulting in the reformation of Ukraine&#x27;s constitution (in favor of the parliament). Hundreds of politicians and activists taking part in the 2001 protests led the 2004 Orange Revolution. Yushchenko led the revolution after the presidential election, and became president on 23 January 2005.

Mykola Melnychenko (who received U.S. political asylum) released new portions of his recordings. In 2004, Volodymyr Tsvil, a Ukrainian businessman who assisted Melnychenko in his escape, publicly accused him of not revealing certain details of the case and trying to sell the audio archive to Kuchma&#x27;s aides. Melnychenko visited Ukraine in 2005 to release new allegation details, but has not disclosed any details of his possible eavesdropping operation.

The criminal investigation regarding the circumstances of Melnychenko&#x27;s records and Georgiy Gongadze&#x27;s death remains inconclusive despite a mass of information revealed by numerous journalistic investigations.

Melnychenko&#x27;s recordings were declared evidence when Kuchma was charged with abuse of office and giving illegal orders to Interior Ministry officials; a criminal case into the murder of Gongadze was opened against Kuchma on 21 March 2011. A Ukrainian district court ordered prosecutors to drop criminal charges against Kuchma on 14 December 2011 on grounds that evidence linking him to the murder of Gongadze was insufficient. The court rejected Melnychenko&#x27;s recordings as evidence.

<doc id="1294633" wikidata="Q72179" url="?curid=1294633" title="Erich Bagge">
<text>Erich Rudolf Bagge (30 May 1912, in Neustadt bei Coburg – 5 June 1996, in Kiel) was a German scientist. Bagge, a student of Werner Heisenberg for his doctorate and Habilitation, was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War. He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Physik in Berlin. Bagge, who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948, was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels, and he was one of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship-Building and Seafare.

The first German nuclear vessel, the &quot;NS Otto Hahn&quot;, was launched in 1962. A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons.

== Uranium enrichment ==
Dr. Bagge developed a gaseous uranium enrichment device (&quot;Isotopenschleuse&quot; or &quot;isotope sluice&quot;) for enriching the U-235 isotope content of uranium in 1944, using three methods; centrifugal force, electromagnetism and thermal diffusion. It was built by BAMAG-MEGUIN under the direction of Kurt Diebner. 

Yellowcake uranium oxide powder was reacted with hydrofluoric acid to form gaseous uranium hexafluoride. It was pumped into the sluice, which consisted of a centrifuge and spun at great speeds to fling heavier non-fissile 238U to the periphery. Electromagnets helped to keep 235U nearer the core of the centrifuge. Slight heating near the bottom of the &quot;bowl&quot; helped 238U to migrate to the bottom whilst 235U bubbled to the top of the chamber. Uranium hexafluoride gas with an enriched content of 235U was then sluiced off the top layers. 

Bagge got a patent in 1955 for the isotope sluice but it never achieved any economic importance.

== Detention and academia ==
From June to December 1945, Bagge was (together with Kurt Diebner, Walther Gerlach, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Werner Heisenberg, Horst Korsching, Max von Laue, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, and Karl Wirtz) detained at Farm Hall near Cambridge, England. After the war, he became Professor in Hamburg, later Professor and Head of the Department of Physics at the University of Kiel, Germany. He was also Head of the Gesellschaft für Kernenergieverwertung in Schiffbau und Schiffahrt (GKSS) near Hamburg.

<doc id="1294640" wikidata="Q49265" url="?curid=1294640" title="Dusé Mohamed Ali">
<text>Dusé Mohamed Ali (; 21 November 1866 – 25 June 1945) was a Sudanese-Egyptian actor and political activist, who became known for his African nationalism. He was also a playwright, historian, journalist, editor, and publisher. In 1912 he founded the &quot;African Times and Orient Review,&quot; later revived as the &quot;African and Orient Review&quot;, which published in total through 1920. He lived and worked mostly in England, alongside the United States and Nigeria respectively. In the latter location, he founded the Comet Press Ltd, and &quot;The Comet&quot; newspaper in Lagos.
==Early life==
Ali was born in 1866 in Alexandria, Egypt. His father, Abdul Salem Ali, was an officer in the Egyptian Army. His mother was Sudanese. He received his early training in Egypt, but at the age of nine or 10, his father arranged for him to go to England to be educated, Ali had originally intended to study as a doctor and had started on related studies before his father&#x27;s death. His father died in 1882 while serving at the Battle of Tel el-Kebir in Egypt. After that, the younger Ali, then 16, was forced to return to Egypt, settling affairs with his father&#x27;s estate, Ali returned to England.
Afterward he wanted to write and act. On completing his studies at the University of London. As the ward of Canon Berry, he pursued studies at King&#x27;s College London.

==Actor and playwright==
Ali was in the theatre company of Herbert Beerbohm Tree and in Lillie Langtry&#x27;s production of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; at the Royal Princess Theatre, London.

As an actor, Ali toured the British Isles. He produced &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; at Hull, Yorkshire, in 1902, playing the parts of Othello and the Prince of Morocco. He earned praise from the British press.

He wrote several plays, producing &quot;The Jew&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1903) at the Royal Surrey Theatre in London, &quot;A Cleopatra Night&quot; (1907) at Dundee, and the &quot;Lily of Bermuda&quot; (1909), a musical comedy at the Theatre Royal, Manchester. The productions were praised by the British and American press.

His production and performance in &quot;A Daughter of Judah&quot; (1906), which he first produced in the Glasgow Empire Theatre (GET) received particularly good reviews.

Mohamed toured in the United States, where he produced several plays and won recognition as an actor.

In London, he founded the Hull Shakespeare Society, of which Sir Henry Irving was the first President. Representing his political interests and &quot;considerable British interest in the Orient&quot;, he founded the Anglo-Ottoman Society, London. Its members included Lords Newton, Lamington, Stourton and Mowbray.

In 1915 Ali founded and was Secretary of the Indian Muslim Soldiers&#x27; Widows&#x27; and Orphans&#x27; War Fund. Among its patrons were Consuelo, the Duchess of Marlborough, the Right Hon. D. Lloyd George, Sir Edward Grey, Lord and Lady Lamington, Lord and Lady Newton, the Marquis and Marchioness of Crew, Mrs. H. H. Asquith, Sir Austen and Lady Chamberlain, Lord Curzon, and almost all the members, of the British Cabinet.

==Lecturer and journalist==

After the First Universal Races Congress held at the University of London in 1911,
Ali, with the help of John Eldred Jones, a journalist from Sierra Leone, in 1912 founded the &quot;African Times and Orient Review&quot; (&quot;ATOR&quot;) in London. Financial assistance in launching the paper was given by some West Africans who were temporarily in London, including J. E. Casely Hayford, a journalist and activist; Francis T. Dove and C. W. Betts from Sierra Leone, founded as a British colony; and Dr. Oguntola Sapara from Lagos, Nigeria. The journal advocated Pan-African nationalism. It became a forum for African and other intellectuals and activists from around the world. It attracted numerous contributors, including George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Annie Besant, Sir Harry H. Johnston, Henry Francis Downing, and William H. Ferris.

The young Marcus Garvey, then studying in London from Jamaica, frequently visited Ali&#x27;s Fleet Street office and was mentored by him. The journal covered issues in the United States, the Caribbean, West Africa, South Africa, and Egypt. Garvey briefly worked for Ali and contributed an article to the journal&#x27;s October 1913 issue.

The journal ceased publication in October 1918 during the First World War, after it was banned by the British government in India and British colonies in Africa in order to prevent unrest. It was succeeded by the &quot;African and Orient Review&quot;, which operated through most of 1920. In Europe Mohamed Ali was considered an authority on Oriental [meaning the Near East at the time] affairs, political and social. Mohamed Ali also contributed to several leading European and American periodicals; his articles were translated and published in Germany, France, Austria, Turkey, Egypt and Japan.

In 1921, following the demise of the &quot;African and Orient Review&quot;, Ali travelled to the United States, never returning to Britain. In the US he briefly worked with Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) movement. He also contributed articles on African issues to UNIA&#x27;s the &quot;Negro World.&quot; He taught in a department of African affairs.

==Travels and settlement in Nigeria==
Ali first travelled to Nigeria in July 1921. The Lagos community welcomed him at the Shitta-Bey Mosque, Martin Street, Lagos Island. He returned to Lagos in 1931, primarily to watch over his interests in the Cocoa business. He settled in Lagos, where he was appointed Editor of the &quot;Nigerian Daily Times&quot;.

On October 3, 1932, Ali produced the play &quot;A Daughter of Pharaoh&quot; in the Glover Memorial Hall, Lagos. According to the &quot;Nigerian Daily Times&quot;, it &quot;set a new standard in Lagos entertainment, introducing real stagecraft.&quot;

Before long Ali became editor of the Nigerian &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, having as his immediate assistant Ayo Lijadu (subsequently editor of the &quot;Nigerian Daily Times&quot;. Expanding his publishing interests, on 27 July 1933 Ali began publication of &quot;The Comet&quot;, a weekly newspaper. He took great interest in the educational and general welfare of the Muslim community in Lagos.

Following a protracted illness, Mohamed Ali died at the age of 78 in the African Hospital, Lagos, on 25 June 1945. His funeral took place on 27 June 1945. Attendees numbered well over 5,000, including political, social and religious leaders. A short &quot;khutba&quot; (sermon) in English was delivered by L. B. Agusto, President of the Islamic Society of Nigeria. A short oration in Arabic was also delivered by D. Couri, a friend. A large funeral procession went through the streets to Okesuna Muslim Cemetery, where Ali was buried.

<text>Boris Franzevich Gulko (; born February 9, 1947) is a Soviet-American Grandmaster in chess. Notably, he is the only person to win both the Soviet Chess Championship and the U.S. Chess Championship, and one of the few players with a plus score against Garry Kasparov.

==Life and career==

Boris Gulko was born in 1947 to a Jewish family. His father was a soldier of the Red Army and was stationed in Soviet-occupied Germany. His family returned to the Soviet Union after a few years. Gulko became an International Master in 1975, and a Grandmaster in 1976. He won the USSR Chess Championship at Leningrad in 1977 along with Iosif Dorfman. The Soviets usually would break ties for the title of Soviet Champion with a multi-game match, and 1977 was no exception. However, Gulko and Dorfman were even after the six game playoff, so they shared the title and prestige of Soviet Champion. They finished half a point ahead of a field that included three former World Champions. Shortly after, Gulko applied to leave the country, but permission was refused. He and his wife, Anna Akhsharumova, who is a Woman Grandmaster of chess, became prominent Soviet Refuseniks. As a vehement anti-Communist, he was once arrested and beaten by KGB agents.

They weren&#x27;t allowed in top-level chess competition until the period of glasnost arrived, and Gulko was finally allowed to emigrate to the United States in 1986. &quot;Thirty-nine is too old to start playing and training to reach the highest achievement in chess,&quot; said Gulko, &quot;those seven years were a serious blow for my chess career, but I don&#x27;t regret them.&quot;

After moving to the U.S. he won the U.S. Chess Championship in 1994 and 1999. He is the only chess player ever to have held both the American and Soviet championship titles. Gulko also holds an amazing positive score against Garry Kasparov, with three victories, four draws, and only one defeat, in games played from 1978 to 2001 (according to ChessGames.com). In 1998, Gulko won clear first place at the U.S. Masters Chess Championship.

Gulko was subject to anti-semitic discrimination 20 years later. He qualified to play at the 2004 World Chess Championship in Libya. The president of the Libyan Organizing Committee, dictator Gaddafi’s son, announced: &quot;We did not and will not invite the Zionist enemies to this championship.&quot; Gulko and several other Jewish players withdrew from the tournament, and Gulko said in a letter to Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of FIDE: &quot;I implore you not to be the first president of FIDE to preside over the first world chess championship from which Jews are excluded. Our magnificent and noble game does not deserve such a disgrace.&quot;

Gulko played for Soviet Union in the Chess Olympiad of 1978 and for the United States in the Chess Olympiads of 1988–2004. He is still playing chess, although he does not participate in a large number of tournaments and he has become an accomplished journalist and political commentator. After living in Fair Lawn, New Jersey for many years, the Gulkos moved to Jerusalem in 2019.

==Notable games==
Gulko has a plus record against Garry Kasparov (+3−1=4). He even beat Kasparov with the black pieces in Russia in 1982:
