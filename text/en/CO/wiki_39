<text>Ottakar&#x27;s was a chain of bookshops in the United Kingdom founded in 1987 by James Heneage. Following a takeover by the HMV Group in 2006, the chain was merged into the Waterstone&#x27;s brand.

==History==
James Heneage established the Ottakar&#x27;s chain in 1987, taking inspiration from &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; book &quot;King Ottokar&#x27;s Sceptre&quot;. He saw a lucrative market in small towns that lacked a Waterstones branch and opened stores in Loughborough, Brighton, Banbury, Salisbury and Trowbridge. A number of Ottakar&#x27;s stores drew on the Tintin connection and had walls painted with scenes from the series. The Ottakar store in Bromley, London had a large rocket taken from the Tintin novels so that children could play inside it. Above the rocket was a cartoon picture of the night sky to add to the effect.

The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1998 and expanded rapidly, making a number of acquisitions including small bookstores in the West Country, eight branches of James Thin Booksellers in 2002, and twenty-four branches of Hammicks Bookshops Ltd, a company with 35 years of bookselling history, in April 2003. By mid-2006, the chain had shops in 141 locations throughout the United Kingdom.

In an attempt to compete with online booksellers, Ottakar&#x27;s established an online ordering service. After turning a loss, the service was withdrawn in 2001, but by 2006, the company had hoped to relaunch their internet arm before the takeover by HMV.

Ottakar&#x27;s was well known in the book trade for the exceptionally high morale and commitment of its staff. Damien Horner, from the advertising agency &quot;Mustoes&quot; commented that Ottakar&#x27;s &quot;was more like a religious cult than a business&quot;.

Ottakar&#x27;s was also very popular with book buyers. A customer survey in 2004 revealed that many people believed that their local branch of Ottakar&#x27;s was an independent bookshop. This was viewed as a vindication of
the Ottakar&#x27;s head office policy of giving branches as much local autonomy as possible. However, some suggested that Ottakar&#x27;s had a weak national brand, which was vulnerable to changing market conditions.

===Children&#x27;s Book Prize===

The Ottakar&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Book Prize was an annual award given to a work of children&#x27;s literature published during the previous year. First awarded in 2005, the purpose of the prize was &quot;to uncover hidden talent in children&#x27;s writing&quot; and was therefore open only to authors who have published no more than three books. When all Ottakar&#x27;s stores were rebranded as Waterstone&#x27;s following the HMV Group takeover of the Ottakar&#x27;s chain, the prize also changed its name to become the Waterstone&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Book Prize.

==Takeover==
In August 2005, amid rumours of a forthcoming takeover attempt by HMV Group plc, the owners of Ottakar&#x27;s (founders James Heneage and Philip Dunne backed by private equity firm Phoenix Equity Partners) made a management buyout offer which was initially accepted by Ottakar&#x27;s independent directors, some of whom had only recently joined the company. When a higher offer was made by HMV, the owners switched their recommendation to accept the HMV bid.

The Office of Fair Trading was due to decide whether to approve the buyout of Ottakar&#x27;s by Waterstone&#x27;s on 2 December 2005. On 6 December the OFT referred the case to the Competition Commission. The Competition Commission provisionally cleared HMV Group, through Waterstone&#x27;s, for takeover of the Ottakar&#x27;s group on 30 March 2006. The Commission stated that the takeover would &quot;not result in a substantial lessening of competition&quot;, and was &quot;not likely to affect book prices, range of titles offered or quality of service.&quot; Through extensive research they also found that &quot;contrary to widespread perception, Waterstone&#x27;s, like Ottakar&#x27;s, operates a book-buying system which mixes central and local input on stock selection.&quot;

Waterstone&#x27;s then announced that it had successfully negotiated a takeover of Ottakar&#x27;s on 31 May 2006 with an agreed cash offer of £62.8 million. HMV chief executive Alan Giles said in a statement: &quot;A combined Waterstone&#x27;s and Ottakar&#x27;s business will create an exciting, quality bookseller, able to respond better to the increasingly competitive pressures of the retail market.&quot; Ottakar&#x27;s chairman Philip Dunne said: &quot;Over the last year the book market has undergone a significant change with new levels of competition from the supermarkets and online retailers impacting all specialist booksellers and in particular those with insufficient scale to compete on equal terms.&quot;

By Christmas 2006, all stores were converted and rebranded as Waterstone&#x27;s; Ottakar&#x27;s name was discarded after the takeover.

<text>Santa Luzia (Portuguese for Saint Lucy) is a parish in the municipality of Angra do Heroísmo on the island of Terceira, in the Azores. The population in 2011 was 2,755, in an area of 1.26 km2. It is the smallest parish in Angra do Heroísmo.
Part of its territory integrates the historical center of the city of Angra do Heroísmo classified as UNESCO World Heritage. Its built heritage includes the monument Memória a D. Pedro IV, the mansion Madre de Deus, the Church of Santa Luzia and Angra do Heroísmo Cultural and Congress Center.

==History==
Of the five civil parishes that constitute the urban area of Angra do Heroísmo, Santa Luzia is the most recent, founded in the first years of the Iberian Union (on 18 August 1595). It was Bishop Manuel de Gouveia (then bishop of Angra) who proposed the creation of the ecclesiastical parish from a portion of Sé, that included: the &quot;Rua de Paulus Gomes&quot; the two bands until the home of George de Lemos de Betancor, down to the fountain and forward to the house of the sheriff, from there to the Castle and from there to the Serra cut by the ravine and mills with all the residents that exist within those limits. He justified it owing to the large faith community, the need to control transit on the island&#x27;s port and the necessity to have access to health care services (at the time administered by the church).

At the time of its creation the parish of Santa Luzia had only about 300 homes, with four per capita, the population only consisted of between 1200 and 1500 souls. There already existed a hermitage to the invocation of Santa Luzia, simplifying the de-annexation of the parish; it was constructed originally by a pious couple at the limits of their property, João vaz Merens and Catarina Lourenço Fagundes, although their selection of Saint Lucia is unclear.

In a documented dated in 1551, Joana Fernandes ou Rodrigues, a widow, donated lands in order to raise a church to Santa Luzia, reformulate or expand the existing hermitage (ostensibly for the founders and not for a future church) at the end of the 16th century.

<text>Shiny Entertainment, Inc. was an American video game developer based in Laguna Beach, California. Founded in October 1993 by David Perry, Shiny was the creator of video games such as &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, &quot;MDK&quot; and &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;. Perry sold the company to Interplay Productions in 1995, which sold the studio to Infogrames, Inc. in 2002. After Foundation 9 Entertainment acquired Shiny in 2006, the company was merged with The Collective in October 2007, creating Double Helix Games.

== History ==

=== Background and formation (1980s–1993) ===
David Perry, a video game programmer from Northern Ireland, created his first video game in 1982, when he was 15, for the Sinclair ZX81 that he had at home. This led him to move to London, England, shortly following his 17th birthday, where would work with several early video game developers on games for the ZX Spectrum. One of these companies was Probe Software, where Perry worked on &quot;The Terminator&quot;, published by Virgin Games. By 1991, Perry had moved to Irvine, California, to work for the internal development studio of Virgin Games&#x27; American branch. At Virgin Games, Perry worked on three successful promotional games: &quot;Global Gladiators&quot; for McDonald&#x27;s, &quot;Cool Spot&quot; for 7 Up, and &quot;Disney&#x27;s Aladdin&quot;. All three games were profitable enough that Perry, after two years at Virgin Games, opted to leave the company.

At the time, he had received employment offers from the Sega Technical Institute and Playmates Toys; the latter was a toy company that had produced toys based on the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; license and was looking to move into video games from that same license. Perry turned down both offers, instead working out an agreement with Playmates that would see the company fund an independent studio with several million dollars, in exchange for the publishing rights to the first three games developed by that studio. Playmates agreed, and Perry, once he had gained lawful permanent resident status in the U.S., set up Shiny Entertainment using Playmates&#x27; funds in October 1993. Offices for the company were set up in Laguna Beach, California, and Perry was appointed as the company&#x27;s president. Several developers formerly of Virgin Games followed Perry and joined Shiny, bringing its employee count to &quot;around nine&quot;. The name &quot;Shiny&quot; was taken from the song &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; by R.E.M., which was popular around the time of the company&#x27;s inception, while the &quot;Entertainment&quot; suffix was chosen because Perry believed that, should the studio attempt to co-operate with Hollywood film production companies, such companies would rather work with an &quot;entertainment&quot; company than with a &quot;games&quot; company. Despite this precaution, Shiny was often mistaken for a pornography production company.

=== &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; and acquisition by Interplay (1994–1995) ===
According to Perry, the young Shiny was not sure what to do, having neither a game project, nor a business plan. However, since Playmates was new to the video game industry, Playmates Interactive, the publishing arm set up by the toy company, had no high expectations. Playmates aided Shiny in finding licenses for potential game projects, and Shiny came close to developing a game based on the &quot;Knight Rider&quot; TV series, but eventually settled on creating an original game. When the company was about to hire Doug TenNapel, an animator formerly of DreamWorks, TenNapel demonstrated his skills by creating a sketch for a game character that would later become Earthworm Jim. The character&#x27;s abilities were worked out by Perry and TenNapel, and the surrounding game, also called &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, became Shiny&#x27;s first development project. To help with the game&#x27;s promotion, Playmates set out to create &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot; toys, but required that a TV series should be produced to market the toys. Perry subsequently met with executives of Universal Studios, who agreed to produce the series if there were toys to accompany it. The deadlock was resolved when Perry invited the heads of Universal and Playmates for dinner, agreeing each party would fulfill their part of the deal. The game was released on console in 1994 to much success, spawning several sequels, spin-offs and ports to other platforms.

Following a sequel to &quot;Earthworm Jim&quot;, &quot;Earthworm Jim 2&quot;, Shiny ought to produce a game with 3D computer graphics, however, Perry was concerned that his team, which had only worked on 2D games, would find it difficult to produce a 3D game. Seeking help from other companies, Perry was offered deals by Nintendo and Sony to exclusively develop for these companies&#x27; console, but he instead agreed to sell Shiny to another video game publisher, Interplay Productions. The deal was announced by Interplay at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 1995, with Shiny retaining their identity and management under the new ownership. Following this buy-out, half of Shiny&#x27;s employees, including TenNapel, left Shiny to form The Neverhood, Inc., another game developer. Meanwhile, Perry instituted a strict no-sequels policy at Shiny to ensure that new games developed by the studio would be surprising and associated with the developer, rather than with a franchise.

=== Further games (1996–2001) ===
The next game produced by Shiny was &quot;MDK&quot;, produced fully in 3D. The studio&#x27;s team successfully switched from 2D to 3D development, and &quot;MDK&quot;, released in 1997, became a very successful game. Aside from being used as a benchmark test for new graphics cards by various magazines, Shiny scored between 40 and 60 deals to include support for peripherals, including joysticks and 3D glasses, as well as deal with Apple Inc. that saw &quot;MDK&quot; pre-installed on every first-generation iMac. Perry believed that selling Shiny because he was unconfident of his team&#x27;s ability to produce a 3D game was the worst mistake he had ever made. After &quot;MDK&quot; shipped, Shiny employees Nick Bruty and Bob Stevenson left the company to form Planet Moon Studios with the same development principles as Shiny. Further Shiny games—&quot;Wild 9&quot;, &quot;R/C Stunt Copter&quot;, &quot;Messiah&quot;, and &quot;Sacrifice&quot;—were developed in parallel at the company, leading to what Perry said was simultaneously diluting focus and talent, and none of the games sold as well as &quot;MDK&quot;.

=== Sale to Infogrames and Foundation 9, and merger (2002–2007) ===
In April 2002, during financial instability at Interplay, Shiny was sold off to Infogrames, Inc. (later renamed Atari, Inc.) for . &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot;, which was in development at Shiny at time, also changed hands to the buyer. Under Atari, Perry conceptualized a game named &quot;Plague&quot;, which Atari forced him to significantly size down to meet budget requirements. This led Perry to leave the company on February 16, 2006. He was succeeded by Michael Persson, who became the studio&#x27;s studio head. Perry went on to found GameConsultants.com, a consultancy firm for video game investors, in May 2006, and by September had joined Acclaim Games and was working on a massively multiplayer online game called &quot;2Moons&quot;.

Shortly following Perry&#x27;s resignation, Atari announced that it was reducing its staff count by 20% and sell all of its internal studios, both actions also affecting Shiny. Perry&#x27;s role as not an employee of Atari meant that he could aid Shiny find the best possible buyer. Thus, on October 2, 2006, Atari agreed to sell Shiny to Foundation 9 Entertainment under the terms that Shiny would at some point co-locate with The Collective, another Foundation 9 studio. On October 9, 2007, Foundation 9 announced that Shiny and The Collective were being merged; both studios had relocated their teams to new offices in Irvine, California, from where the merged company would operate under the lead of Persson. In March 2008, the new studio was named Double Helix Games.

<doc id="1281455" wikidata="Q3373850" url="?curid=1281455" title="Peak signal-to-noise ratio">
<text>Peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise that affects the fidelity of its representation. Because many signals have a very wide dynamic range, PSNR is usually expressed as a logarithmic quantity using the decibel scale.

PSNR is commonly used to quantify reconstruction quality for images and video subject to lossy compression.

== Definition ==
PSNR is most easily defined via the mean squared error (&quot;MSE&quot;). Given a noise-free &quot;m&quot;×&quot;n&quot; monochrome image &quot;I&quot; and its noisy approximation &quot;K&quot;, &quot;MSE&quot; is defined as
: formula_1

The PSNR (in dB) is defined as
: formula_2

Here, &quot;MAXI&quot; is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. More generally, when samples are represented using linear PCM with &quot;B&quot; bits per sample, &quot;MAXI&quot; is 2B − 1.

=== Application in color images ===
For color images with three RGB values per pixel, the definition of PSNR is the same except that the MSE is the sum over all squared value differences (now for each color, i.e. three times as many differences as in a monochrome image) divided by image size and by three. Alternately, for color images the image is converted to a different color space and PSNR is reported against each channel of that color space, e.g., YCbCr or HSL.

== Quality estimation with PSNR ==
PSNR is most commonly used to measure the quality of reconstruction of lossy compression codecs (e.g., for image compression). The signal in this case is the original data, and the noise is the error introduced by compression. When comparing compression codecs, PSNR is an &quot;approximation&quot; to human perception of reconstruction quality.

Typical values for the PSNR in lossy image and video compression are between 30 and 50 dB, provided the bit depth is 8 bits, where higher is better. The processing quality of 12-bit images is considered high when the PSNR value is 60 dB or higher. For 16-bit data typical values for the PSNR are between 60 and 80 dB. Acceptable values for wireless transmission quality loss are considered to be about 20 dB to 25 dB.

In the absence of noise, the two images &quot;I&quot; and &quot;K&quot; are identical, and thus the MSE is zero. In this case the PSNR is infinite (or undefined, see Division by zero).

== Performance comparison ==
Although a higher PSNR generally correlates with a higher quality reconstruction, in many cases it may not. One has to be extremely careful with the range of validity of this metric; it is only conclusively valid when it is used to compare results from the same codec (or codec type) and same content.

Generally, when it comes to estimating the quality of images and videos as perceived by humans, PSNR has been shown to perform very poorly compared to other quality metrics.

== Variants ==
PSNR-HVS is an extension of PSNR that incorporates properties of the human visual system such as contrast perception.

PSNR-HVS-M improves on PSNR-HVS by additionally taking into account visual masking. In a 2007 study, it delivered better approximations of human visual quality judgements than PSNR and SSIM by large margin. It was also shown to have a distinct advantage over DCTune and PSNR-HVS.

<doc id="1281467" wikidata="Q2191577" url="?curid=1281467" title="Hildegard Neumann">
<text>Hildegard Neumann (born 4 May 1919) was a chief overseer at several Nazi concentration, transition and detention camps during the last year of World War II. She was born in Deutsch Gabel, Czechoslovakia.

==Camp work==
Neumann came to the Ravensbrück concentration camp in October 1944, where she became an &quot;Oberaufseherin&quot; (Chief Wardress) soon after. Because of her good conduct, the Nazis sent her to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and ghetto in Czechoslovakia in November 1944 as Head Female Overseer. Neumann was known as a cruel female guard.

She oversaw between ten and thirty female police and over 20,000 female Jewish prisoners. Neumann also aided in the deportation of more than 40,000 women and children from the camp to the Auschwitz and Bergen Belsen camps, where most were killed. The tasks of the female overseers in Theresienstadt was to guard women prisoners at work on &quot;labour kommandos,&quot; during transports to other camps, and in the ghetto itself. Most were cruel and abusive, especially Caecilia Rojko, who was nicknamed the &quot;Prisoners&#x27; Fright&quot;, and Hildegard Mende, nicknamed &quot;The Beast&quot;.

== Escape from prosecution ==
Neumann fled the camp in May 1945 and was not seen again. She was never prosecuted for war crimes, even though more than 100,000 Jews were deported from Theresienstadt and were murdered or died there, and 55,000 died in the camp itself.

It is claimed that she may have died on 5 November 2010.

<text>Manea Mănescu (9August 191627February 2009) was a Romanian communist politician who served as Prime Minister for five years (27February 197429March 1979) during Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s Communist regime.

His father was a Communist Party veteran from Ploiești, who in the early 1920s supported the transformation of the Socialist Party into the Romanian Communist Party (PCR). Mănescu joined the PCR in 1938, while he was a student at the Academy of Economic Studies in Bucharest. In 1944, after the 23 August coup d&#x27;état, he worked together with Nicolae Ceaușescu, his future brother-in-law, in the Union of Communist Youth. In 1951, Mănescu was appointed as head of the Department of Economics at the University of Bucharest and Director General of the Central Directorate of Statistics. He served as Finance Minister from 1955 until 1957.

In December 1967 he was appointed Chairman of the Economic Council. He was promoted to full membership of the Executive Committee of the PCR in December 1968 and, after holding various positions in the party and government, he became Prime Minister in March 1974, a position he held until 1979, when he retired, reportedly due to ill health. Also in 1974 he became titular member of the Romanian Academy.

Mănescu stayed close to Ceaușescu and his wife, Elena Ceaușescu up until the Romanian Revolution of 1989. He left the Central Committee&#x27;s building by helicopter together with them on 22 December, though he had to disembark at Snagov due to too much weight in the craft. He was arrested shortly afterward and taken to the airbase at Deveselu, where he was kept in detention until 31 December. Tried in early 1990 together with Emil Bobu, Ion Dincă, and Tudor Postelnicu, Mănescu was sentenced to life in prison for participation in genocide; on appeal, his sentence was reduced to 10 years. He served two years in prison, and was set free on 12 November 1992 due to poor health. Because of his conviction, he was stripped of his membership in the Romanian Academy.

He died in 2009, aged 92, and was buried at Bellu Cemetery in Bucharest.

==Family==
Mănescu&#x27;s wife, Maria Munteanu Mănescu, was a well known pediatrician. In December 1973, she was named Vice Chairman of the Romanian Red Cross Society. She was also named a member of the (Romanian) National Council of Women in April 1978. It is not clear if the Mănescus had any children.

<text>Thomas Hyde (29 June 163618 February 1703) was an English linguist, historian, librarian, classicist, and orientalist. His chief work was the 1700 [&quot;On the Ancient Religion of the Persians&quot;], the first attempt to use Arab and Persian sources to correct the errors of Greek and Roman historians in their descriptions of Zoroastrianism and the other beliefs of the ancient Persians, in addition to producing translations of some Zoroastrian texts.

==Life==

He was born at Billingsley, near Bridgnorth in Shropshire, on 29 June 1636. He inherited his taste for linguistic studies, and received his first lessons in some of the Eastern tongues, from his father, who was rector of the parish.

Hyde was educated at Eton College, and in his sixteenth year entered King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. There, under Abraham Wheelock, professor of Arabic, he made rapid progress in Oriental languages, so that, after only one year of residence, he was invited to London to assist Brian Walton in his edition of the Polyglott Bible. Besides correcting the Arabic, Persic and Syriac texts for that work, Hyde transcribed into Persic characters the Persian translation of the Pentateuch, which had been printed in Hebrew letters at Constantinople in 1546. To this work, which Archbishop Ussher had thought well-nigh impossible even for a native of Persia, Hyde appended the Latin version which accompanies it in the Polyglott.

In 1658 he was chosen Hebrew reader at Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, and in 1659, in consideration of his erudition in Oriental tongues, he was admitted to the degree of M.A. In the same year he was appointed under-keeper of the Bodleian Library, and in 1665 librarian-in-chief. Next year he was collated to a prebend at Salisbury, and in 1673 to the archdeaconry of Gloucester, receiving the degree of D.D. shortly afterwards. As librarian, Hyde was responsible for the publication of the &quot;Catalogus impressorum Librorum Bibliothecae Bodleianae&quot; (1674) [Catalog of the Printed Books in the Bodleian Library], the third published catalogue of the Bodleian collections.

In 1691 the death of Edward Pococke opened up to Hyde the Laudian professorship of Arabic; and in 1697, on the deprivation of Roger Altham, he succeeded to the Regius chair of Hebrew and a canonry of Christ Church.

Under Charles II, James II and William III, Hyde discharged the duties of Eastern interpreter to the court. He resigned his librarianship in 1701, giving as a reason, &quot;my feet being left weak by the gout, I am weary of the toil and drudgery of daily attendance all times and weathers.&quot; He died at Oxford on 18 February 1703, aged 66.

==Works==
Hyde was an assiduous classical scholar and linguist who helped popularize Orientalism and the study of Asian history in Britain. He learned Chinese from the Chinese Jesuit Michael Shen and wrote in and translated Turkish, Arabic, Syriac, Persian, Hebrew, and Malay. His chief work was the 1700 [&quot;On the Ancient Religion of the Persians&quot;], the first attempt to use Arab and Persian sources to correct the errors of Greek and Roman historians in their descriptions of Zoroastrianism and the other beliefs of the ancient Persians. He identified Zoroaster as a religious reformer. Like Engelbert Kaempfer, he is sometimes mistakenly credited with coining the word &quot;cuneiform&quot;. He is similarly sometimes credited with coining &quot;dualism&quot;.

His writings and translations include:
* , a translation of the c. 1438 &quot;Zij-i Sultani&quot;
* , a combination of the separate translations of the Dutchmen A.C. Ruyl, J. Van Heurn, and J. Van Hasel with an English foreword by Hyde introducing the Malay language, its orthography, and its grammar.
* , a translation of Abraham Farissol&#x27;s 1524 &quot;Iggeret Orḥot &#x27;Olam&quot;.
* .

In parts of the , he relates his understanding of various Chinese games as explained to him by Michael Shen. These include &quot;coan ki&quot; and a confused account of &quot;weiqi&quot; (i.e., go) which includes the first Latin mention of the game&#x27;s concept of &quot;eyes&quot;. The was republished by Hunt and Costard in 1760. The other worksincluding some previously unpublished manuscriptswere collected, edited, and published by Gregory Sharpe in 1767 under the title . Sharpe also provided a biography of Hyde in his work.

He attended St Dominic&#x27;s College, Penrith until year 11 (1981) then went on to complete year 11 (again) and year 12 at Patrician Brothers&#x27; College, Fairfield he played for the Australian Schoolboys rugby league team in 1983. He was later signed on as a junior to his local club side the Penrith Panthers.

==Professional career==
===Penrith Panthers===
Alexander made his first-grade debut for the Panthers in the 1984 season as a half-back. His talent quickly became clear and by the end of the season he took out the Rookie of the Year award. The following year Greg continued his good form throughout the season tallying up 194 points (a club record at the time) and earning himself the 1985 Dally M. player of the year award. Greg continued playing with the Panthers for the next several years and become known for his unique ability to score and set up tries, his excellent attacking kicking and his solid defence.

At the end of the 1986 NSWRL season, he went on the 1986 Kangaroo tour, gaining selection after Parramatta winger Eric Grothe was controversially ruled out with a knee injury. Alexander would go on to play in 10 matches on tour with the Kangaroos, scoring 10 tries and kicking 5 goals. Alexander and test hooker Royce Simmons became the first Panthers selected for a Kangaroo Tour. 1989 saw him rise to selection for New South Wales in the 1989 State of Origin series, being one of the few Blues players regarded as playing well in a series won 3-0 by Queensland, before being selected as the first choice halfback for Australia&#x27;s mid-season tour of New Zealand. After making his test debut in the 26-6 first test win against New Zealand at the Queen Elizabeth II Park in Christchurch, and playing in the 8-0 second test win at Rotorua, Alexander lost his place in the side with coach Bob Fulton preferring his 1987 premiership winning halfback from Manly-Warringah, Des Hasler, in the position for the third and final test.

During the 1989 NSWRL season, his pace and skill had made Penrith the second most dangerous attacking team in the competition behind the eventual premiers, the Canberra Raiders and Alexander was the Panthers leading try and point scorer and for much of the year led the league in try-scoring – scoring ten tries in eight games at one point, eventually finishing with 15 tries from 18 games for the season. Alexander would eventually finish second on the try-scoring list finishing behind Canberra fullback Gary Belcher who scored 17 tries. Alexander finished ahead of other noted try scorers including Andrew Ettingshausen (Cronulla), Ricky Walford (St George) and Phil Blake (South Sydney). Penrith&#x27;s form saw them reach the finals for the first time since his rookie year in 1984, reaching the knockout Minor Semi-Final before ending their season with a 27–18 loss to Canberra.

With Alexander in great form at both halfback and fullback for the Panthers, the club made it to their first ever Grand Final in 1990 against the defending premiers Canberra. The Panthers went down 18–14 to the Raiders and despite a solid performance, Alexander&#x27;s goalkicking let him down on the day, only kicking one of his four attempts compared to Canberra captain Mal Meninga who landed all three of his attempts. Despite his good form, Alexander was only selected to the bench for game 3 of the 1990 State of Origin series and missed selection in Australia&#x27;s mid-season tests against France and New Zealand.

At the end of the season he was selected for his second Kangaroo Tour as the back up fullback to Canberra and Queensland custodian Gary Belcher and went on to be selected for every game on tour, although unlike Terry Lamb who played in every game on the 1986 tour, Alexander, along with the Kangaroos&#x27; other replacements that day (David Gillespie, Des Hasler and Mark Sargent), did not get off the bench in the 14–10 second test win against Great Britain at Old Trafford that kept The Ashes series alive. Alexander was the leading point scorer for the Kangaroos on tour, playing 17 games (7 from the bench including 3 of the 5 Tests on tour), scoring 14 tries and kicking 50 goals for a total of 156 points. The closest a team mate got in points was team captain Mal Meninga who scored 64 points (8 tries, 16 goals) from his 11 games. He scored a record 46 points in the tour match against France B (5 tries, 13 goals) in Lyon and continued that form into the first Test against France 3 days later in Avignon when after coming on to replace an ill Ricky Stuart at halfback early in the game he went on to score 3 tries and kick 7/8 goals in the Kangaroos 60–4 win giving him a personal haul of 28 points, just two points shy of 1986 Kangaroos team mate Michael O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Kangaroos Test record 30 points in a World Cup game against Papua New Guinea in 1988.

In the 34–10 second test win a week later at the Stade Gilbert Brutus in Perpignan, a hamstring injury ruled out Laurie Daley. This saw Dale Shearer move from the wing to the centres with coach Bob Fulton selecting Brandy on the wing (he had played on the wing against Widnes, as well as earlier in the tour playing 60 minutes on the wing against Castleford). In his only Test on the flank, Brandy kicked 3 goals to go along with his memorable try where he evaded French fullback David Fraisse who had earlier shown great pace to run down Kangaroos speedsters Shearer and Andrew Ettingshausen and prevent both from scoring. Brandy&#x27;s subsequent first half try resulted in a gymnastics style backflip celebration. He had performed the backflip several times at training while in England (claiming it was something he had learned in gymnastics while still in school) and had wanted to do it after scoring a try in a game, saying he almost did almost done so after scoring against 1989 World Club Champions, Widnes. But, with Australia in a battle to retain The Ashes, he felt the circumstances were never right. However, as the second test against the French was also the final game of the Kangaroo tour and there being little chance of a French win, he allowed himself the luxury of the backflip in front of the TV cameras.

Alexander captained the Panthers to their maiden premiership in 1991, the Panthers reversing the result of the 1990 Grand Final with a 19–12 win over Canberra. From halfback, Alexander took control of the game in the 2nd half with his kicking game which included a 38-metre field goal to give Penrith a 13–12 lead following a Brad Izzard try under the posts which were converted by Alexander. Later a majestic sideline conversion of Royce Simmons&#x27; 2nd try of the game sealed the win for the Panthers. The Phil Gould coached Panthers never fell below 4th on the ladder for the season (Round 2) and never lost the competition lead after regaining it following Round 14 of the 22 round season. From Round 14 the Panthers only loss of the season was a 14–12 away loss to Cronulla-Sutherland in Round 20.

During the season he was selected at fullback for NSW in Games I and III of the 1991 State of Origin series, only missing Game II at the Sydney Football Stadium through injury. Despite his good form for Penrith and NSW and the absence of Gary Belcher through injury, Alexander was overlooked for the first test of mid-season Trans-Tasman Test series against New Zealand in favour of boom Brisbane and Qld fullback Paul Hauff, while he also missed selection in the final two games when selectors chose Andrew Ettingshausen. With Origin halfbacks Ricky Stuart and Allan Langer also in good form (Langer played) and Des Hasler in the team as a utility reserve, Alexander was only considered a chance of playing fullback in the tests. Following the Panthers Grand Final win over Canberra, Alexander was selected for Australia&#x27;s 5 game tour to Papua New Guinea but withdrew through injury. He recovered from injury in time to lead the Panthers to England in October for the 1991 World Club Challenge, which was lost to Wigan 21–4 at the Anfield Stadium.

1992 was a year of huge expectation for Alexander and the reigning premiers Penrith. While the Panthers form was up and down at the beginning of the season, Alexander was named as captain and fullback of the City Origin side, ahead of incumbent NSW captain Benny Elias. This led to Alexander being the favourite to take over the Blues captaincy for that year&#x27;s State of Origin series against Queensland. However, a knee injury lead to Alexander being withdrawn from the match, and Country Origin captain Laurie Daley would go on to successfully captain the NSW side to a 2–1 series win, with Alexander missing all three games due to his knee injury. Selectors stuck with Stuart at half and Ettingshausen at the back.

====Ben Alexander&#x27;s death====
On 21 June 1992, his younger brother and fellow Panthers teammate Ben Alexander was killed in a car accident. The tragic loss of the younger Alexander had an adverse effect on the close-knit Panthers club and the team&#x27;s form dropped off in the second half of the year which saw them miss the finals. Greg Alexander, who had been sidelined with a knee injury since April of that year, missed the majority of fixtures that year, playing only 9 games for the season (including two from the bench) and following his brother&#x27;s death would not return to the side until their Round 20 match against Manly-Warringah at Brookvale Oval in August. After his return, he continually fell below his usual playing weight of 84 kg and ended the season ten kilograms lighter than usual.

===Auckland Warriors===
At the end of the 1994 season after playing in just 13 games for the Panthers (mostly at fullback as the club had signed New Zealand test halfback Gary Freeman from Easts), Alexander joined the Auckland Warriors ahead of their inaugural season in the league as a way of dealing with his grief over Ben&#x27;s death. He spent most of the first half of his first season for the Warriors at halfback and began to recapture some of his previous form. In the latter half of the season he moved between fullback, halfback and five-eighth due to the depth the Warriors had in the halves – with Gene Ngamu, Stacey Jones, Phil Blake and Frano Botica all spending some time at halfback or five-eighth. In his second season with the club, he was awarded the captaincy after Dean Bell retired, and again began the season at halfback. However, after he was injured in Round 10, New Zealand halfback Stacey Jones regained the halfback role, and upon returning to the side Alexander was moved to the fullback position – where he would remain for most of the remaining season.

===Return to the Panthers===
Alexander eventually returned to Penrith in 1997 after his stint in New Zealand and stayed on until his retirement in 1999. His early-season form for the Panthers in the new Super League competition saw him selected at halfback for his first game for NSW since 1991 in the Super League Tri-series. After starring in NSW&#x27;s 38–10 win over Queensland in the first game of the series.

In total, Alexander played 228 games for the Panthers, scored 100 tries, kicked 343 goals and 14 field goals, tallying 1,100 career points for the club. To date, he is one of only seven players ever score over 100 tries and over 1,000 points for a single club in top grade Australian rugby league. The others being Terry Lamb (Canterbury-Bankstown), Ryan Girdler (Penrith Panthers), Hazem El Masri (Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs), Darren Lockyer (Brisbane Broncos), Luke Burt (Parramatta Eels) and Jarrod Croker (Canberra Raiders).

==Life after football==
After his retirement from football in 1999, Alexander embarked on a media career in both radio and television. He currently works as a host for Foxtel&#x27;s Fox Sports station. He also hosts the nightly Sports Today program with John Gibbs on Sydney radio station 2UE.

On 24 October 2000, he was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his rugby league achievements.

On 25 June 2016, he was inducted into the Penrith Panthers hall of fame alongside Grahame Moran, Royce Simmons, and Craig Gower. On 28 August 2023, Alexander was informed by the NSWRL board that his contract would not be renewed as advisor to the New South Wales coaching staff. Alexander had been in the role since 2018.

==Personal life==
Alexander is the brother-in-law of fellow former Penrith, NSW and Australian teammate Mark Geyer, and of former Penrith, Western Reds and Newcastle second rower, Peter Shiels, both of whom married his sisters. He is also the brother-in-law of former St. George Illawarra Dragons hooker Cameron King, who is the younger brother of his wife Tanya. He is uncle to Penrith Panthers second rower Mavrik Geyer.

Alexander has appeared in several road safety awareness campaigns with his former Penrith teammate Brad Fittler.

As of 2024, Alexander&#x27;s son Braith plays for the Sydney Roosters in the New South Wales Cup.

<text>Newburgh is a coastal village in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The village dates to 1261 AD, when William St. Clair, 6th Baron of Roslin, wanted to establish a chapel in the area. Originally built as a school, somewhat later the chapel of Holy Rood was established.

==Geography==

Newburgh is on the Ythan Estuary and near the Sands of Forvie. Near the estuary mouth, the presence of tern colonies is notable, since there are several distinct species that utilise the north banks of the Ythan Estuary, and comprise a meaningful percentage of the breeding pairs of terns in the United Kingdom. In the summer terns can be observed feeding in their characteristic diving patterns approximately inland from the estuary. The Forvie Nature Reserve is very near and to the north, where there is said to be the largest eider duck colony in the world. Beside the beach is an eighteen-hole golf course with its bird shaped clubhouse and the Udny Arms restaurant.


==History==
During the nineteenth century, Newburgh was a main sea port for the nearby town of Ellon. A number of clipper ships sailed to destinations all over the globe to deliver tea and other cargoes and coal barges sailed up the east coast to offload at the quayside. Several of the wealthier clipper sea captains built houses in the village and named them after their most frequent ports of call. Hence several imposing properties exist in the village such as Shanghai house, Santa Cruz and Sydney house.

Newburgh was a victim of bombing in World War 2. Just past the eastern end of the Ythan Bridge, is a bomb crater left by an attacking German aircraft, the bomb, aimed at the wharf, skipped over the bridge and exploded on the embankment beside the Cruden Bay Road. Other bombs fell beside a mill at the south of the village (12 January 1942) and several dropped in the estuary whilst trying to attack buildings on the quayside.

A pillbox was located at the Ythan bridge; although this bridge has been demolished, the pillbox remains.

The beach was classed as a high invasion threat from German units based on Norway. A number of pillboxes along with barbed wire, anti-tank blocks and scaffolding poles (that ran almost to Aberdeen along the coast) were installed.

Landmines were also planted in areas between Newburgh estuary and Aberdeen, in December 2012 a landmine was found in the dunes. It&#x27;s unclear how it got there, as the listed minefield were at Forvie and Menie. Mines have been known to be dragged along the coast by currents.
2005 saw a sudden expansion in housing in the village, with houses being built just west of the local school, and near the Ythan Hotel, at the southernmost point of the village. Whilst the houses at the west end of Newburgh were a marketing success, residents were fairly critical of the properties going up next to the Ythan, dubbing the area too swampy for the foundations.

==Local information==
Public transport, providing services to Aberdeen, Peterhead, Ellon and Dyce Airport, are presently run by Stagecoach North Scotland.

Education is served by Newburgh Mathers School, named after John Mathers, who, just before his death, left the residents of Newburgh enough money to set up a school in the local area for, as he put it, &quot;the education and clothing of twenty poor fishermen&#x27;s sons of Newburgh&quot;. In terms of secondary education, Newburgh is within the catchment area for Ellon Academy.

The tallest point of Newburgh is the knoll Gallows Hill. 

The police station in Newburgh no longer exists: in its place stands a house; however, the presence of a cell, in the past, is given away by the bars in one of the windows. Also, in the front of the house are the words &quot;police station&quot; engraved in the stone.

==Tourist attractions==
The ruined Knockhall Castle is near Newburgh and was inhabited for a century by Clan Udny.

Coastal and country walks/cycling, bird watching, Sands of Forvie reserve, sea trout angling available. Newburgh on Ythan Golf Club, a links course. Wind/kite surfing in the area. Sand dunes and sandy beaches.

<text>Majlis Bachao Tehreek (English: Save Majlis Movement) is a political party in the Indian state of Telangana.

== History ==
Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT) was founded by Mohammed Amanullah Khan as a result of differences with AIMIM President Sultan Salahuddin Owaisi. He formed the MBT (Save Majlis Movement) in 1993 after he was suspended for protesting against the stance taken by AIMIM during the demolition of the Babri Masjid. Later, he launched a campaign against the demolition. He raised crucial issues including lack of internal democracy in the AIMIM primarily nepotism, political patronage and corruption.

Amanullah Khan initially joined the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen in 1960. He emerged as a leader in the MIM, serving as a MIM floor leader.

Mumtaz Ahmed Khan was also a member of MBT until 1999.

Before MBT, the AIMIM had 4 legislators in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly. After the split, MBT took Chandrayangutta and Yakutpura constituencies. The AIMIM won only 1 seat, Charminar. The 4th seat, Asifnagar was lost to both parties due to the division of votes among AIMIM Candidate Virasat Rasool Khan and MBT Candidate Mohammed Vizarat Rasool Khan, both brothers. Congressman D Nagender won Asif Nagar three times in 1994, 1999, 2004.

===2000s===
Mohammed Amanullah Khan died on 10 November 2002. The party continued its struggle, while keeping alive his spirit of social service. Adam Malik, a close aide of Aman Ullah Khan, was President of the MBT and served till his death. Dr. Khayam Khan, eldest son of the late Aman Ullah Khan, was elected as President of the MBT and served until his death.

In the Lok Sabha election 2004 MBT launched Majeed Ullah Khan who had earlier lost as a candidate from Yakutpura constituency in 1999, in the Hyderabad constituency. Khan received 47,560 votes (4.78% of the votes in that constituency). Most of the votes came from the Chandrayangutta area, where Khan got 28,746 votes (20.6% of the votes).

In the Andhra Pradesh state legislative assembly elections 2004. MBT had launched seven candidates, out of whom five contested against AIMIM candidates. No MBT candidate was elected.

MBT had two out of a hundred seats in the last sitting Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. Amjed Ullah Khan (youngest son of Amanullah Khan) was one of the corporators from Chanchalguda division with the wife of Saleh Ba Hamed winning from Barkas area. In the newly formed Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation, Amjad Ullah Khan (Khaled) won as corporator from the newly redistricted Azampura division.

In the 2009 assembly and Lok Sabha elections, the MBT fielded Dr. Khayam Khan from Chandrayangutta and Hamza Bin Omer (alias Zafar Pehlwan) from Yakutpura, while providing support to Zahid Ali Khan (Editor of Siasat News Daily) in his attempt at the Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat on the Telugu Desam (TDP) ticket.

Majeedullah Khan, alias Farhat Khan, was elected 5 June 2016 President of MBT Party. He is the son of late Amanullah Khan, founder of Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT)

<text>Constantin Dăscălescu ( , ; 2 July 1923 – 15 May 2003) was a Romanian communist politician who served as Prime Minister of Romania during the communist rule of Nicolae Ceaușescu, from 21 May 1982 until the Romanian Revolution in 22 December 1989.

He was born in Breaza de Sus, Prahova County, to Nicolae and Stanca Dăscălescu. From 1937 to 1941 he trained as a metal lathe operator at a vocational school in his hometown, after which he started working at the Astra Română company in Câmpina.

<text>The are a set of 863 Chinese characters known as &quot;name kanji&quot; in English. They are a supplementary list of characters that can legally be used in registered personal names in Japan, despite not being in the official list of &quot;commonly used characters&quot; (kanji). &quot; kanji&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the characters in both the and lists because some Japanese names do not require the specified kanji and are written entirely in kanji. Hence, kanji can also be viewed as a subset of kanji.

A ministerial decree of 1946 limited the number of officially sanctioned kanji for public use to the 1,850 kanji. Only kanji on this list were acceptable as registered names, despite the fact that the list excluded many kanji frequently used in names up to that point. However, on May 25, 1951, the cabinet extended the set of characters usable in names by specifying the first 90 kanji.

Over the years, the Minister of Justice has increased the number of name kanji, and has a plan for further addition in response to requests from parents. As of April 30, 2009, there were 985 kanji, but this number was reduced to 861 in late 2010 when 129 characters were transferred to the kanji list, and 5 characters were transferred from the kanji list to characters. In 2015 and 2017, 2 kanji in total were added to the list, making the total number 863.

In Japan, name kanji are taught at the junior-high level.

==History==
Below is a list of changes made to the kanji list since its creation in 1951.

===May 25, 1951===
The first 92 characters of kanji were published:
This would include seven kanji which would become part of the original kanji in 1981: 
With the last one (dragon, traditional version) also being simplified to (dragon, simplified version).

This would also include fifteen kanji which would be transferred to the kanji in 2010:

===July 30, 1976===
28 kanji were added, for a total of 120 characters.

One would become part of the original kanji in 1981: .

===October 1, 1981===
The kanji list was introduced, which included seven of the original 92 kanji from 1951 (mentioned above), plus one of the 28 new kanji from 1976 (also mentioned above); those eight were thus removed from the kanji list.
54 other characters were added for a total of 166 name characters.

===March 1, 1990===
118 kanji were added for a total of 284 characters.

===December 3, 1997===
1 kanji was added, for a total of 285 characters.

===February 23, 2004===
1 kanji was added, for a total of 286 characters.

===June 7, 2004===
1 kanji was added, for a total of 287 characters.

===June 11, 2004===
No addition to the kanji was made on this date. However, a plan for 578 additions was put forward to the council on kanji of the legislative council of the Ministry of Justice. The list included certain characters in strong demand by parents for use in their children&#x27;s names, such as:
* (, &quot;strawberry&quot;)
* (, &quot;distant&quot;, traditional variant)
* (, &quot;scintillating&quot;)
* (, &quot;fang&quot;)

Many others were included not for their potential uses in names (as is noted), but rather because of their frequent use and being easy to read and write. Examples include:

* (, &quot;excrement&quot;)
* (, &quot;curse&quot;)
* (, &quot;corpse&quot;)
* (, &quot;cancer&quot;)

At this same council, the decision was made to call for suggestions on characters to be included or excluded via the Ministry of Justice website, until July 9, 2004.

===July 12, 2004===
3 kanji were added, for a total of 290 characters.

===July 23, 2004===
No additions were made. After sharp protests, the council decided to withdraw nine characters from the 489 whose inclusion had been discussed. These nine characters were:
* (, &quot;excrement&quot;)
* (, &quot;curse&quot;)
* (, &quot;corpse&quot;)
* (, &quot;cancer&quot;)
* (, &quot;rape, seduction&quot;)
* (, &quot;obscene&quot;)
* (, &quot;resentment&quot;)
* (, &quot;hemorrhoids&quot;)
* (, &quot;concubine&quot;)

The 480 other characters still remained under consideration for inclusion, with one additional character added to them, namely (, &quot;to draw up water with one&#x27;s hands&quot;).

===September 27, 2004===
484 characters and variant forms of 209 kanji were added, bringing the total number of the kanji to 983.

===April 30, 2009===
2 more characters were added for a total number of 985 characters.

===November 30, 2010===
In late 2010, the Japanese government added 196 characters to the kanji list. The list now includes 129 characters previously classified as kanji, 11 of which are currently used in Japanese prefectures or nearby countries:

* ( in , Ibaraki Prefecture)
* ( in , Ehime Prefecture)
* ( in , Shizuoka Prefecture)
* ( in , South Korea)
* ( in , Kumamoto Prefecture)
* ( or ) in , Saitama Prefecture)
* ( in , Tochigi Prefecture)
* ( in , Nara Prefecture)
* ( in , Yamanashi Prefecture)
* ( in , Osaka)
* ( in , Gifu Prefecture)

At the same time, 5 characters deleted from the kanji list were added to the kanji list, making the total number of kanji 861:
* ( (), an old unit of measure approx. 18ml in volume, or 0.033m2 in area)
* ( () or (), a spindle or weight)
* ( (), pig iron)
* ( () or (), to swell or bulge; mostly used in the compound , normally rewritten with instead)
* ( (), a unit of weight approx 3.75g)

===January 7, 2015===
1 kanji was added, for a total of 862 characters.

* ( (), spiritual medium, oracle, shaman, shrine maiden)

===September 25, 2017===
1 kanji was added, for a total of 863 characters.

==List of kanji==
The list is split into two parts: 
* 633 characters which do not appear in the list of kanji (regular-use kanji). 18 of these have a variant, bringing the number of character forms to 651.
* 212 characters which are traditional forms () of characters present in the list of kanji.

=== kanji not part of the kanji===
Variants are given in parentheses.

Below are the 18 characters that are variant forms of characters in the list above. For each variant form, the corresponding standard form (&quot;non-variant&quot; form) is in parentheses.

===Traditional variants of kanji===
The modern form (), which appears in the kanji list, is given in brackets.

===Actual usage in names===
Usage of the kanji in Japanese names varies widely. For example, , is used in over 6,000 names, and the 53 kanji used most commonly in names are all in over 500 names each.

<doc id="1281503" wikidata="Q826866" url="?curid=1281503" title="Bernt Balchen">
<text>Bernt Balchen (23 October 1899 – 17 October 1973) was a Norwegian pioneer polar aviator, navigator, aircraft mechanical engineer and military leader. A Norwegian native, he later became an American citizen and was a recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross.

His service in the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II made use of his Arctic exploration expertise to help the Allies over Scandinavia and Northern Europe. After the war, Balchen continued to be an influential leader with the U.S. Air Force, as well as a highly regarded private consultant in projects involving the Arctic and aviation.

==Early years==
The son of a country doctor, Balchen was born at the farm Myren in Tveit, just outside Kristiansand, Norway. After having finished Norwegian middle school in 1916, he attended a Forestry School from 1917 to 1918. Next he enrolled in the French Foreign Legion, and his unit was assigned to the Verdun front in World War I. In 1918, before seeing action, Balchen was recalled to Norway. He transferred to the Norwegian Army, and was sent to an artillery school, where he graduated shortly after.

Under an assumed name, Balchen fought as a cavalryman with the White Guards in the Finnish Civil War that followed the end of major hostilities. During a cavalry charge, his horse was shot from under him and he was left for dead on the battlefield. Having received serious wounds that required a lengthy convalescence, Balchen turned to an early interest in athletics and trained strenuously as a boxer to represent Norway in the 1920 Olympics. Besides being a championship boxer, he was also an expert marksman and an accomplished skier. Balchen was very knowledgeable about wilderness and northern survival, skills that he would later exploit.

While waiting for his acceptance as an Olympian, Balchen received word that he also qualified for flight training, resulting in his decision to become a pilot in the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service in 1921.

==Aviation==

===Amundsen-Ellsworth Relief Expedition===
Gaining recognition as an accomplished pilot, the Norwegian Defense Department selected Balchen in 1925 to become part of the Amundsen-Ellsworth Relief Expedition, a rescue mission for the missing explorer Roald Amundsen under the command of Flight Lieutenant Lützow-Holm. The expedition consisting of two seaplanes, was sent to Spitsbergen on the Svalbard archipelago. This assignment would make Amundsen, already a family friend, a lifelong friend and confidant.

During the next year, Balchen became part of a ground party led by Lieutenant J. Höver, providing technical services for the Roald Amundsen, Lincoln Ellsworth and Umberto Nobile Arctic Expedition, ultimately a successful attempt to fly the lighter-than-air airship, &quot;Norge&quot;, over the North Pole from Svalbard to Teller, Alaska. Although he was a highly regarded mechanic, Balchen&#x27;s main role was to provide survival training to the Italian crew members as well as to teach them to ski. In a last-minute decision by Amundsen, he was not chosen to be on the record-breaking dirigible flight as Nobile was in charge of picking the crew, which already had a complement of 23.

===Support of Byrd&#x27;s North Pole flight===
After observing the crash of the Fokker trimotor, &quot;Josephine Ford&quot;, belonging to one of his competitors, Lieutenant Commander Richard E. Byrd of the U.S. Navy, Amundsen asked Balchen to help in preparing the airplane for a flight to the North Pole. Under Balchen&#x27;s supervision, the damaged aircraft skis were repaired with improvised wooden supports from a lifeboat&#x27;s oars and some survival gear was loaned to Byrd for the flight. This enabled Byrd and his pilot, Floyd Bennett to continue with their attempt to fly to the North Pole and back on 9 May 1926.

In 1926, under the sponsorship of Joseph Wanamaker, Balchen officially joined the Byrd party, as the co-pilot and navigator, with the pilot Floyd Bennett, flying the &quot;Josephine Ford&quot; on a tour to more than 50 American cities, thereby promoting commercial aviation as a safe, reliable and practical means of transportation. Following this tour Balchen was hired by Anthony Fokker as a test pilot for the Fokker Aircraft Company at the Teterboro Airport, New Jersey.

===Trans-Atlantic Flight===
On 29 June 1927, Balchen, as the co-pilot with the chief pilot Bert Acosta; the flight engineer, George Otto Noville and the navigator and air flight organizer, Commander Byrd, flew a U.S. Post Office airmail aircraft, Fokker trimotor &quot;America&quot;, across the Atlantic Ocean from Roosevelt Field on Long Island.

Due to Acosta&#x27;s reported lack of ability to successfully fly via aircraft instruments, and the foul weather for most of this flight, Balchen did most of the flying. Bad weather and low visibility over France made landing at the Paris airport impractical, despite their repeated attempts. When their aircraft was running low on aviation gasoline, Balchen decided to fly back to the western coast of France, and there he landed the Fokker Trimotor —-which was not designed for a water landing —- on the ocean with no injury to the occupants.

===&quot;Bremen&quot; rescue===
In late April 1928 the three-man crew of the aircraft &quot;Bremen&quot; was stranded on Greenly Island, Canada following the first east to west non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean from Europe. Balchen and Floyd Bennett flew a Ford Trimotor to provide relief to the downed pilots. Bennett had developed pneumonia following a previous crash. Bennett succumbed to his fever while in flight on 25 April. Balchen flew the remaining eight hours, and he was paid $10,000 for the effort. Balchen donated the money to Bennett&#x27;s widow.

===South Pole flight===

On 28–29 November 1929, as the pilot of a modified Ford 4-AT Trimotor named &quot;Floyd Bennett&quot;, Balchen became one of the first four men to fly over the South Pole. Balchen was the chief pilot, and he was accompanied by Harold June, his co-pilot and radio operator; Ashley McKinley, the flight&#x27;s photographer; and Commander Richard E. Byrd, the plane&#x27;s navigator and leader of his First Antarctic Expedition. The flight was considered one of the greatest aviation achievements in history.

===Amelia Earhart===
Due to his reputation as a polar, transatlantic and aviation expert, Balchen was hired in 1931 by Amelia Earhart as a technical adviser for a planned solo transatlantic flight. In an attempt to throw off the press, Earhart turned over her repaired Lockheed Vega to Balchen who was assumed to be planning an Antarctic flight. Balchen flew the Vega to the Fokker Aircraft Company plant at Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. There, he and the mechanics Frank Nagle and Eddie Gorski reconditioned the Vega for the upcoming record flight. Its fuselage was strengthened to carry extra fuel tanks that were added to provide a 420-gallon capacity, and some additional flight instruments were also installed. After modifications had been made, Earhart flew this Lockheed Vega across the Atlantic Ocean on 20 May 1932, landing in Ireland.

===Norway===
In the mid-1930s, Balchen returned to Norway to work with the Norwegian Airlines. Later, he was part of a team to create a Nordic Postal Union, and as war seemed inevitable in Europe, Balchen helped negotiate an aviation treaty with the United States. Balchen also worked with the airplane, The Valkyrien.

==World War II==
In 1939, Balchen was in Helsinki, working on a contract to provide U.S. fighter aircraft to Finland, when the Soviet attack on Finland took place. Enlisting with the Norwegian Air Force, he made his way to the United States on a crucial mission to negotiate &quot;matters pertaining to aircraft ordnance and ammunition with the question of the Norwegian Government&#x27;s possible purchase of such materials in the United States of America.&quot;

With his status of holding dual Norwegian and American citizenship and his extensive contacts in the aviation industry, his instruction from the Norwegian Government-in-exile in London changed to a new directive: to set up a training camp and school for expatriate Norwegian airmen and soldiers in Canada. Balchen negotiated directly with Canadian government officials to obtain an agreement to use available airport facilities at the Toronto Island airport on Lake Ontario known as &quot;Little Norway&quot;. During the war, over 2,500 Norwegian aviators of all categories: pilots, navigators and mechanics, were trained in the various bases of &quot;Little Norway&quot;.

During 1940, with the &quot;Little Norway&quot; facilities under construction and his administrative duties taken over by others, Balchen requested permission from the Norwegian Air Force to fly ferrying missions for the British, teaming with Clyde Pangborn, a contemporary record-breaking pilot of the era. In early 1941, while engaged in a ferrying mission, and on a layover in the Philippines, a representative of General Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold sought out Balchen. Arnold asked Balchen to join the US Army Air Forces as a colonel to oversee the establishment of the USAAF polar airfields at Qaanaaq, and Sondre Stromfjord Greenland. These highly secretive bases would serve to ferry fighter aircraft across the Atlantic by air, rather than having to disassemble them and send them overseas by cargo ship. The airfields also served as bases from which long-range Consolidated B-24 Liberator patrol aircraft could fly far out over the North Atlantic Ocean in search of the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; U-boats that were menacing American, British, and Canadian ships taking war supplies and troops across the ocean in preparation for the then undecided location of the cross-channel invasion of Europe. This latter air base had the code name &quot;Bluie West Eight&quot; during its operational life.
Between September 1941 and November 1943, Balchen trained his personnel in cold weather survival skills and rescue techniques which enabled them to carry out many rescues of downed airmen on the Greenland icecap. On 25 May 1943, flying in a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Balchen led a bombing raid that destroyed the only German outpost remaining on Greenland, a forward station at Sabine Island on the eastern coast of that island. This destruction hindered the ability of the German armed forces to maintain a presence on Greenland that not only had been used to send deceptive radio messages to Allied aircraft as well as establishing a weather station required to provide accurate weather reports for the German forces operating in the North Atlantic.

Balchen then was posted to the European Theatre to run &quot;Operation Where and When&quot;, based at &quot;Luleå-Kallax&quot; Air Base in northern Sweden. Balchen commanded a clandestine air transport operation, using 10 Douglas C-47s and helped to set up an escape route between the United Kingdom and Sweden that enabled numerous important diplomats and others to flee the Nazis. From March to December 1944, Balchen&#x27;s &quot;Operation Balder&quot; using six B-24s manned with OSS crews, safely evacuated at least 2,000 Norwegians, 900 American internees and 150 internees of other nationalities from Sweden. Norwegian police troops were also airlifted from Sweden to Finnmark.

The air operation also shipped strategic freight; from July to October 1944, 64 tons of operational supplies such as ammunition were transported from Scotland to the underground in occupied Norway. Life necessities like bales of hay and fodder for livestock were brought to areas in the north of Sweden and Norway, once even paradropping a hospital complete with a doctor and nurse. Between November 1944 and April 1945, Balchen also transported 200 tons of Arctic equipment and operational supplies from England to Sweden that were used to make secret overland transport from Sweden to Norway possible. During winter 1945, Balchen shipped communications equipment into northern Norway that was of inestimable value to the Allied Expeditionary Force&#x27;s intelligence operations. The leading Norwegian wartime ace Sven Heglund was acting military attaché and served with Balchen, later writing about his time at Kallax. Another Norwegian at Kallax during the same period, who became a good friend, was marine biologist and explorer-to-be Thor Heyerdahl, later of &quot;Ra I and II&quot; and &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; fame.

==Postwar activities==

From November 1948 to January 1951, Balchen commanded the 10th Rescue Squadron of the U.S. Air Force, which was located in southern Alaska but which operated across all of Alaska and northern Canada rescuing crashed airmen. Balchen led this squadron in the development of the techniques that became widely used in cold weather search and rescues. He was also directly responsible for persuading the U.S. Air Force to purchase the de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver bush aircraft, one that became an important search and rescue aircraft for the Arctic. On 23 May 1949, while commanding the 10th Rescue Squadron, Balchen flew a Douglas C-54 Skymaster from Fairbanks, Alaska, via the North Pole to Thule Air Base, Greenland.

Balchen was primarily responsible for the pioneering and development of the strategic air base at Thule, Greenland, built secretly on his recommendation, in 1951 under severe weather conditions which, by extending the range of the Strategic Air Command, increased the capabilities that made the SAC a significant deterrent to Soviet aggression during the Cold War.

==Post-retirement==
After retiring from the U.S. Air Force in 1956, Colonel Balchen continued to serve the Air Force on special assignments and aviation and energy industries as a consultant. He joined General Precision Laboratories as a consultant in 1959, as well as working with a host of other companies including Hughes Aircraft, General Dynamics, Canadair and the Electric Boat Company. Working for Canadair in 1966, then the parent company, General Dynamics, from 1966 to 1971, Balchen had authority over projects as diverse as ice-breakers, tankers, new epoxy materials for submarine construction, seagoing electronic weather systems and over-snow vehicles. In 1962, he also worked with the USAF presenting a proposal on the Apogee Intercept Defense System (AIDS) in 1962 and later, was the leading advocate for &quot;Project Iceman&quot;, a proposed system of intermediate range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) stationed in Greenland.

Colonel Balchen was among 27 passengers on board the first circumnavigation of the Earth over both poles. The aircraft was a brand-new, chartered Flying Tiger Line Boeing 707-349C jet with U.S. registration N322F, which had been modified with additional fuel tanks installed in the front passenger cabin. The route taken, between 14 and 17 November 1965, was from Honolulu, over the North Pole, to London; Lisbon; Buenos Aires; before flying over the South Pole and continuing on to the last refueling stop at Christchurch before returning to Honolulu. Balchen was the only passenger allowed into the cockpit when the four pilots, who were all qualified Boeing 707 captains, performed four 360-degree loops over the South Geographic Pole. As well as being the first such flight, this would remain the fastest until succeeded by Pan Am Flight 50, a Boeing 747SP with U.S. registration N533PA, on October 28–30, 1977. (October 28, 1977 was the 50th anniversary of Pan Am&#x27;s first (airmail) flight, from Key West, Florida to Havana, Cuba: about 90 miles.)
As one of the world&#x27;s foremost Arctic experts, Balchen was sought out by numerous companies and government agencies including Canada and Norway. Balchen was hired as a consultant by Hercules Oil, then Phillips Petroleum and Moran Towing on plans to extract oil from Alaska using pipelines. According to a 1972 article in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, Balchen asserted that &quot;a general warming trend over the North Pole is melting the polar ice cap and may produce an ice-free Arctic Ocean by the year 2000.&quot;

In his native Norway, Balchen was a driving force in the establishment of &quot;Det Norske Luftfartselskap&quot; (D.N.L.) (&quot;The Norwegian Airline Company&quot;), with which he pioneered commercial Europe–US airline flights across the North Pole. D.N.L. later merged with Danish and Swedish airlines into the major carrier Scandinavian Airlines.

==Death and burial==

Balchen continued to work in consultancy until his death. In his final year, he was diagnosed with bone cancer, and he died at Mount Kisco, New York in 1973. Balchen was buried at the Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. He is buried in Section 2, Grave 4969, next to Admiral Richard E. Byrd.

==Honors and tributes==
Balchen received the Congressional Gold Medal in 1930 and the Harmon Trophy in 1956, both for his pioneering in aviation. He became honorary member of American Polar Society in 1966. The annual &quot;International Aviation Snow Symposium&quot;, sponsored by the Northeast (U.S.) Chapter of the American Association of Airport Executives, created the Bernt Balchen Award in his memory in 1976 to recognize airports excelling in snow and ice control. In 1973, Balchen was inducted in the National Aviation Hall of Fame In 1974, Mount Balchen in Alaska was named after him, and there is a Mount Balchen in Antarctica also named in his honor. In 1976, Balchen was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame. October 23 1999, the centenary of Balchen&#x27;s birthday, king Harald V unveiled a statue of Balchen in his home town Kristiansand. The Royal Norwegian Air Force’s school in Kjevik has a bronze relief of Balchen, a gift from Sons of Norway. In 2012, when the Norwegian Air Force celebrated their 100 year anniversary, «Norsk Militær Luftmakt 100 år», the first airshow was held at Kjevik outside Kristiansand and named «Bernt Balchen Airshow».

<text>The Ourthe (; Walloon: &quot;Aiwe d&#x27; Oûte&quot;) is a long river in the Ardennes in Wallonia, Belgium.

==River==
It is a right tributary to the river Meuse. The Ourthe is formed at the confluence of the &quot;Ourthe Occidentale&quot; (Western Ourthe) and the &quot;Ourthe Orientale&quot; (Eastern Ourthe), west of Houffalize.

The source of the &quot;Ourthe Occidentale&quot; is near Libramont-Chevigny, in the Belgian province Luxembourg. The source of the &quot;Ourthe Orientale&quot; is near Gouvy, also in the Belgian province Luxembourg, close to the border with Luxembourg.

After the confluence of the two Ourthes at Lake Nisramont, the Ourthe flows roughly in north-west and later in northern direction. Near Noiseux it flows for a short distance through the province of Namur. After the municipality of Durbuy it flows into Liège Province. Eventually it flows into the river Meuse in the city of Liège. The most important tributaries of the river Ourthe are the Amblève and the Vesdre. Towns along the Ourthe are Houffalize (Ourthe Orientale), La Roche-en-Ardenne, Hotton, Durbuy, Hamoir and Esneux.

Near Hotton, the caves of Hotton are located. In these caves runs a subterranean river which flows in the Ourthe. 

Near Esneux lies the Roche aux Faucons. This is a vantage point located on a high cliff, above a meander of the Ourthe. In the south, near Marcourt, there is another high cliff where the Hermitage and chapel of Saint-Thibaut is located. 

Around 1820, William I of the Netherlands demanded the creation of the Ourthe channel. Via the Ourthe, this channel would have connected the Meuse basin with the Moselle basin. Belgium&#x27;s independence in 1830 put an end to these plans. The main remnant of these works is the unfinished channel tunnel in Bernistap (province of Luxembourg).

<text>La Cenicienta (&quot;Cinderella&quot;) is an opera in three acts composed by Chilean artist Jorge Peña Hen (1928–1973), to a libretto by the Chilean author, Oscar Jara Azocar (1910–1988).

This opera is one of the few operas in the world composed with the aim to be sung, acted and played exclusively by children. It was written in 1966 and played by Jorge Peña Hen&#x27;s first Symphonic Orchestra of Children at the Theater of the Girls Public School in La Serena, a city in the northern region of Coquimbo.

In 1967, a production of &quot;La Cenicienta&quot; went on a tour through several cities in Chile: Valparaíso, Viña del Mar, Concepción and Santiago, the capital. Its debut was considered a great success.

In 1986, a new version of this children&#x27;s opera was played in Colombia.

In 1998, 25 years after Jorge Peña Hen&#x27;s assassination by Chile&#x27;s military coup officials, another version was re-made in La Serena.

In 2004, a new staging by Fondazione Teatro La Fenice, and in 2005 by University of Chile&#x27;s Theatre in Santiago, Chile.

The plot of the opera is based on Charles Perrault&#x27;s classic fairy tale &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

<text>The Morley Academy is a mixed secondary school located in Morley, West Yorkshire, England.

The school forms part of the Gorse Academies Trust which also includes The Farnley Academy, The Ruth Gorse Academy and the Elliott Hudson College.

==History==
===1906–1930: Morley Secondary School===

The school was established as Morley Secondary School on 17 September 1906. The school was temporarily situated within the Sunday school premises of St Mary in the Wood Church, before moving to a permanent location on Fountain Street in 1909. The school&#x27;s foundation stone was laid by Alderman Samuel Rhodes, the Mayor of Morley, in 1907. The first head teacher was John Robinson Airey (1868–1937), a nationally renowned mathematician. 

During the First World War pupils at Morley Secondary School raised £5,000 to pay for school uniforms for struggling families in the school. In total, 17 school pupils died during the war. After the war, the school raised over £1,200 to pay for a memorial organ commemorating those who had died.

===1930–1975: Morley Grammar School===
Morley Secondary School became Morley Grammar School in 1930.

In 1963, the school was extended to include a kitchen, main hall, dining room, and sports changing rooms.

===1975–2011: Morley High School===
Morley Grammar School became a mixed comprehensive in 1975, under headmaster J. R. (Ralph) Carr.

In 1996, the school&#x27;s Assembly Hall was destroyed by fire. Two Second World War plaques were saved from the fire, and re-dedicated in 1999.

===2011–present: The Morley Academy===
In early 2011, Morley High School became The Morley Academy, under the Academies Act 2010.

On 25 June 2012, The Morley Academy hosted the Olympic Torch during its tour of the United Kingdom.

Between 2014 and 2016, The Ruth Gorse Academy operated from temporary facilities within the grounds of The Morley Academy.

In early 2015, the school caused controversy when head teacher Leanne Griffiths announced by letter that the school would withdraw all privileges, such as trips, from pupils where &quot;personal or insulting comments&quot; had been made by their parents on social media, or where there had been any &quot;breakdown in rapport&quot; with the school and that the school was working with police to stop this.

The Morley Academy stopped taking students into its sixth form provision in September 2015 due to the opening of Elliott Hudson College, a dedicated sixth form centre.

==Ofsted==
An Ofsted inspection in 2006 found the school Grade 3 (Satisfactory) for overall effectiveness, and in 2009, Grade 1 (Outstanding). Ofsted re-evaluated the school with the same Grade 1 rating in 2013.

==Awards and recognition==
In July 2001, the Arts Council awarded the Morley High School the Silver Level Artsmark. The school was one of three in Leeds and of only thirteen in Yorkshire to be so recognised. The Morley Academy is a Specialist Technology College.

The school is one of only 200 schools in the country that have been awarded Teaching School Status.

The Morley Academy was awarded the British Council&#x27;s International School Award in 2014, after forming a partnership with Buffelsdale Secondary School in Durban, South Africa.

<text>Gila Katsav (, born 1948) is an Israeli public figure who served as the First Lady of Israel from 2000 until 2007 as the wife of former President Moshe Katsav. 

==Biography==
Gila Katsav was born in Tel Aviv. She is of Polish-Jewish and Ukrainian-Jewish ancestry. One of her grandfathers was among the founders of Bnei Brak. In 1969, she married Moshe Katsav. The couple has five children, four sons and a daughter, and two grandchildren.

Katsav is involved in personal volunteer activities for children who come from disadvantaged families as part of the efforts of “The Council for the Sheltered Child. She also volunteered for the Rehabilitation Department of Yad Sarah, a voluntary organization which specializes in providing home care and lending medical equipment without charge.

Katsav served as the First Lady of Israel from 2000 until 2007 during the tenure of her husband. In May 2005, Katsav led U.S. First Lady Laura Bush on a tour of the Yad Vashem and a controversial visit to the Western Wall. 

Gila Katsav publicly defended her husband, then-President Moshe Katsav, against allegations of rape and sexual harassment. In September 2006, she told journalists attending an exhibition at the Jerusalem Theater, &quot;I have no doubt that my husband is innocent. I&#x27;m certain that the truth will come to light...We are undergoing difficult times, but we&#x27;re alright and will get through them.&quot; President Katsav resigned from office in 2007 as part of a plea deal, but was convicted of rape and obstruction of justice in 2010. She accompanied her husband upon his release from Ma&#x27;asiyahu Prison in December 2015.

<text>Donnie Munro (Scottish Gaelic: Donaidh Rothach /dɔnɪ rɔhəx/) (born 2 August 1953) is a Scottish musician and politician, best known as the former lead singer of the band Runrig. Munro served as the bands lead vocalist during their most commercially successful period, 1987–1995, particularly with the release of their album &quot;The Cutter and the Clan&quot; and the 1995 single &quot;An Ubhal as Àirde (The Highest Apple)&quot; which made chart history by becoming the first song to be performed in Scottish Gaelic to chart in the United Kingdom. &quot;Mara&quot; (1995) served as the last album released by Runrig to feature Munro on lead vocals, leaving the band in 1997 to pursue a career in politics. 

Following his departure from Runrig, he turned down the opportunity to stand as the parliamentary candidate for Scottish Labour for the Glasgow Shettleston constituency was considered the &quot;safest Labour seat in Scotland&quot;, instead standing as the parliamentary candidate for the Ross, Skye and Inverness West constituency at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election, coming second to Liberal Democrat John Farquhar Munro. His 2006 solo album, &quot;Heart of America&quot;, won Album of the Year at the 2006 Scots Trad Music Awards. As a native speaker of Scottish Gaelic, much of his work is performed in the language.

==Early life==
Munro was born in Uig, Isle of Skye, in the Inner Hebrides. He attended Gray&#x27;s School of Art in Aberdeen and obtained a postgraduate degree in teaching from Moray House in Edinburgh.

==Career==
===Runrig (1973–1997)===
He first witnessed Runrig&#x27;s performance in 1973 and was approached a year later to join the band. As the lead singer of Runrig, Munro gained recognition as a prominent Gaelic music performer in the 1980s and 1990s. They released their debut album, &quot;Play Gaelic&quot;, in April 1978, followed by the albums &quot;The Highland Connection&quot; (1979), &quot;Recovery&quot; (1981) and &quot;Heartland&quot; (1985). The band achieved moderate breakthrough commercial success in 1987 upon the release of &quot;The Cutter and the Clan&quot;, which yielded the singles &quot;Worker for the Wind&quot; / &quot;Alba&quot; and &quot;Protect and Survive&quot;, which peaked just outside the Top 100 of the UK Singles Chart. &quot;News from Heaven&quot; was released as the lead single from their sixth album &quot;Searchlight&quot; (1989), which peaked at number ninety on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;Searchlight&quot; reached a peak of number eleven on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified Silver in the United Kingdom and marked the beginning of a period of commercial success for the band across Europe. 

The early 1990s continued a period of success for the band, particularly in the British and German music markets. &quot;The Big Wheel&quot; (1991) and &quot;Amazing Things&quot; (1993) both reached the top five of the UK Albums Chart, whilst &quot;Amazing Things&quot; gave the band their debut appearance on the German Albums Chart following a peak position of number forty-seven. &quot;Flower of the West&quot; was released as the only single from &quot;The Big Wheel&quot; and peaked just outside the UK Top 40 Singles Chart, whilst &quot;Wonderful&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Flame&quot; which were the two singles to be released from &quot;Amazing Things&quot; gave the band their first appearance in the UK Top 40. 

In 1996, Runrig released a cover version of &quot;Rhythm of My Heart&quot; by Rod Stewart which was included on their compilation album &quot;Long Distance&quot;. The single reached number twenty-four on the UK Singles Chart, and was followed by the release of a remixed version of &quot;The Greatest Flame&quot; which reached number thirty in the United Kingdom. &quot;Long Distance&quot; achieved considerable commercial success across Europe, reaching number thirteen in the United Kingdom, six in Denmark, sixty in Germany and number one in their native Scotland, whilst achieving both Gold certifications in the United Kingdom and Denmark.

In 1997, Munro left Runrig to pursue a career in politics. His farewell concert took place at Stirling Castle on 29 August, marking his final performance with the band. Munro was replaced as lead singer of the band by Canadian musician Bruce Guthro in 1998.

===Solo career (1999–present)===

Munro released a solo album titled &quot;Heart of America&quot;, in collaboration with fellow Skye songwriters Blair Douglas and Richard Macintyre. The album won Album of the Year at the Scots Trad Music Awards in 2006. Currently, Munro holds the position of Director of Development at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, Scotland&#x27;s National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture, located on the Isle of Skye.

Munro completed a series of live shows titled &#x27;An Turas – The Journey&#x27;, featuring a forty-piece ensemble. Additionally, he is preparing for the release of a live album recorded at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow during Celtic Connections 2008.

For Runrig&#x27;s 40th anniversary at the Black Isle show ground at Muir of Ord on 10 August 2013, Munro appeared as a special guest and performed three songs. For Runrig&#x27;s farewell concert, &quot;The Last Dance&quot; in City Park, Stirling, on 18 August 2018, Munro appeared as a special guest, performing two songs.

===Political career (1991–1999)===
Munro was elected as Rector of the University of Edinburgh in 1991, a position he held until 1994. His political aspirations necessitated his leaving the band, which he did in 1997. His reasons for departure occasioned lengthy private discussion over a two-year period but were not made public. He contested the UK Parliamentary seat of Ross, Skye and Inverness West for Labour in the 1997 General Election but was defeated by Charles Kennedy (Liberal Democrat). He then contested the Scottish Parliament seat of Ross, Skye and Inverness West for Labour at the 1999 Scottish Parliament election but was defeated narrowly by John Farquhar Munro, also of the Liberal Democrats, in what was traditionally a Liberal Democrat stronghold. Munro was said to have rejected the offer of a &#x27;safe&#x27; Labour seat in Central Scotland in the 1999 election as he had already been adopted as a candidate for his native Highland constituency.

<text>Vera Weizmann (née Chatzman) (; November 27, 1881 – September 24, 1966), wife of Chaim Weizmann, the first president of the State of Israel, was a medical doctor and a Zionist activist.

==Biography==

Vera Chatzman was born in the town of Rostov-on-Don, in the Russian Empire, the daughter of Isaiah and Feodosia Chatzman. She initially studied music before taking up medical training in Geneva, Switzerland. There she met Chaim Weizmann at Geneva University&#x27;s Zionist Club.

In 1906 she married Weizmann at Zoppot, Prussia, today called Sopot, in Poland, and later that year they settled in Manchester, England. There they had two sons, Benjamin born in 1907, and Michael born in 1916. The Weizmann family lived in Manchester for thirty years, from 1906 until 1937. In 1913, Vera Weizmann received her English medical license and worked as a doctor in the public health service at clinics for infants, developing advanced techniques for infant supervision and nutrition.

The elder son, Benjamin (Benjie) Weizmann (1907–1980), settled in Ireland and became a dairy farmer. The Weizmanns’ younger son, Michael, served as a pilot in the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War and was killed on active service when his plane was shot down over the Bay of Biscay.

==Volunteer work ==

In 1916, Weizmann gave up her work as a pediatrician when she joined her husband upon his appointment as the scientific adviser in chemistry to the British Admiralty during the First World War. In 1920, she was one of the founding members of the Women&#x27;s International Zionist Organization (WIZO), and served as its president, alternating with Lady Sieff, for forty years. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, she devoted all of her efforts to Youth Aliyah (&quot;Aliyat Hanoar&quot;), an organization that she established in England and continued to head as honorary president while living in Israel.

During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Weizmann focused on the treatment and rehabilitation of wounded soldiers. Immediately after the war, she established the Association of the War of Independence Handicapped Veterans and served as its president. She also established two centers for the rehabilitation of wounded soldiers, Beit Kay in Nahariya and the Department of Rehabilitation at Sheba—Tel Hashomer Hospital.

In addition to her activity in these organizations, Weizmann gave her support to many voluntary organizations such as ILAN, Magen David Adom, for which she served as president, and dozens of other private and institutional charitable endeavors.

==Weizmann House==
As first lady, Weizmann had the interior of the house built for the couple at Weizmann Institute redesigned. All of the furniture and art was original, mostly imported from England and France.

<doc id="1281559" wikidata="Q718322" url="?curid=1281559" title="Kenji Hatanaka">
<text> (28 March 1912 – 15 August 1945) was a Japanese military officer and one of the chief conspirators in the Kyūjō incident, a plot to seize the Imperial Palace and to prevent the broadcast of Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s surrender speech to mark the end of World War II.

== Military career ==

Hatanaka served in the Military Affairs Section of the Japanese Ministry of War at the end of World War II. As one of the leaders of a group of Japanese officers determined to prevent the acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration and therefore the surrender of Japan, Hatanaka attempted a coup d&#x27;état on 14–15 August 1945. Failing to obtain the support of the War Minister, General Korechika Anami, Hatanaka organised a number of other officers and succeeded in occupying the Imperial Palace and Imperial Household Ministry.

Still needing high-level support for his cause, he tried to enlist Lieutenant General Takeshi Mori, commander of the 1st Imperial Guard Division. Mori was non-committal and a frustrated Hatanaka shot and killed him. Hatanaka and his men then spent several hours searching for the recording that had been made of the Emperor&#x27;s speech announcing the surrender of Japan, and which was meant for public broadcast. When he failed to locate the recordings, he occupied the NHK Building in an attempt to prevent the speech from being broadcast. However, still without high level support and the recordings, Hatanaka abandoned his coup after receiving direct orders to do so from Eastern District Army Headquarters.

Following the failure of the coup, Hatanaka traveled to the plaza fronting the Imperial Palace. Along with his fellow conspirator, Lieutenant Colonel Jirō Shiizaki, he shot himself. In Hatanaka&#x27;s pocket was found his death poem:

==In popular culture==
*In the 1967 film &quot;Japan&#x27;s Longest Day&quot;, Hatanaka was portrayed by actor Toshio Kurosawa
*In the 2015 film &quot;The Emperor in August&quot;, Hatanaka was portrayed by actor Tori Matsuzaka

<text>The Bunker Tragedy was an atrocity committed by the staff at the Herzogenbusch concentration camp (also known as &quot;Kamp Vught&quot;) in the Netherlands, in January 1944 during World War II.

==Events==
When one woman from barrack 23B was locked up in the camp prison (the &#x27;bunker&#x27;), other women protested against it. At the encouragement of Hermann Wicklein, the commandant Adam Grünewald, as a punishment, had as many women as possible incarcerated in one cell. Eventually, 74 women were pressed together in cell 115, which had a floor area of 9m2 and hardly any ventilation. After 14 hours of confinement, the inmates were released from the cell. Ten women did not survive the night.

The incident soon became known outside the camp and was written about in resistance newspapers. The occupying power was not pleased with the fact that the news had leaked. Grünewald and Wicklein were both court-martialed for excessive cruelty. They were both convicted of manslaughter; Grünewald was sentenced to 3.5 years in prison and Wicklein was sentenced to six months in prison. They were both pardoned after serving a month in prison. However, Grünewald was then demoted and ordered to fight on the Eastern front, where he was killed in combat in January 1945.

, one of the bunker victims, wrote:
&#x27;When the lights went off, a great panic rose among the women. It was a strange swelling sound, which sometimes would diminish, but soon swell up again. It was caused by praying, screaming and yelling women. Some tried to yell over it to calm the women down, so they could save oxygen. Sometimes it would help a bit, but then it would start again. It would not stop, it continued the whole night. It diminished, though, because the heat was suffocating.&#x27;

This event is being remembered annually in closed circle.

<doc id="1281569" wikidata="Q7254450" url="?curid=1281569" title="Pseudo-transparency">
<text>Pseudo-transparency is a term used for X Window System clients that simulate the appearance of translucency or transparency by manipulating the same pixmap that has been drawn on the root window, or by instructing the X Server that the Background Pixmap should be inherited from the window&#x27;s parent.

==Purpose==
Traditionally, the X Window System has lagged behind other windowing systems in adding purely eye candy or aesthetic features, such as window translucency. This has encouraged developers to develop kludges to overcome this limitation.

This pseudo-transparency, so called as the background pixmap of the root window is visible (analogous to desktop wallpaper) rather than any obscured windows, allows users to make windows look less imposing (such as Terminal emulators, which usually comprise large chunks of text), and to integrate the appearance of windows with their desktop themes.

==Implementation==
There are three common methods for achieving pseudo-transparency using Xlib, each with its own advantages and drawbacks.

===Parental-relative===
The &quot;parental-relative&quot; method uses codice_1 to inherit the parent window&#x27;s background image. Unfortunately, using this method, the X server permits very few operations to be performed on the background pixmap (such as XOR), preventing clients from implementing any sort of advanced image filtering.

===_XROOTPMAP_ID and ESETROOT_PMAP_ID properties===
These properties are used to inform the window where it can find the pixmap used on the root window. Using this information, a client can paint a section of the image (corresponding to the size and position of the window) onto its background, achieving the effect of transparency. This method uses the most memory, but has the advantage of allowing clients to perform any operation, such as tinting or shading, on the image data.

===XCopyArea===
&quot;XCopyArea&quot; can achieve a more realistic transparency effect in that it can include obscured windows, but with the significant disadvantage that it is only usable with modal windows. This method simply uses the codice_2 function to take a partial screenshot for use as the window&#x27;s background pixmap.

==Future==
Recent technologies such as DirectFB, Direct Rendering Infrastructure, and hardware compositing via OpenGL allow X client applications to utilize true alpha transparency.

<text>Super Sport, or SS, is the signature performance option package offered by the Chevrolet division of General Motors on a limited number of its vehicles. All SS models come with distinctive &quot;SS&quot; markings on their exterior. The SS package was first made available for the 1961 Impala. Some of the other models bearing the SS badge include the Camaro, Chevelle, El Camino, Impala, Monte Carlo, Nova and Chevrolet Pickup Trucks. Current SS models are produced by the GM Performance Division.

General Motors&#x27;s also offered SS models through its Australian subsidiary Holden in its range of Holden Commodore sedans and sportwagons, and also in the Holden Ute range of two-door coupé utilities.

== History ==

In December 1956, Chevrolet unveiled a show car based on the first generation (C1) Corvette called the Corvette Super Sport. In early 1957, the Chevrolet Corvette SS debuted — a custom built racing sports car that was the first Chevrolet to wear the &quot;SS&quot; badge.

In 1961, the SS &quot;kit&quot; (known as a sport and appearance package) was offered on any Impala for just $53.80. The package included Super Sport trim for both the interior and exterior, chassis reinforcements, stronger springs and shocks, power brakes, spinner wheel covers, and narrow-band whitewall tires. The car&#x27;s dashboard received a Corvette style passenger hand bar and a steering column mounted 7000-rpm tachometer. Chevrolet built 491,000 Impalas that year and 453 had the SS package, of which 311 received the 348 cid and 142 received the 409 cid. Since 1994, the SS package has been used on a variety of GM vehicles, including pickup trucks, four-door sedans, and front wheel drive cars.

Both historically and today, the Super Sport package has typically included high-performance tires, heavy-duty suspension, and increased power, along with a variety of other performance and appearance upgrades.

==Concept car==

In 2003, Chevrolet released a concept car they named the SS. A rear wheel drive sports car with a modern 430 hp small-block V8 engine and race-tuned suspension, it was billed as &quot;a modern interpretation of Chevrolet&#x27;s Super Sport heritage&quot;. Though never intended for production, the vehicle was used as a show car and to hint at what was ahead for Chevrolet sports car design.

==Collectors market==
It is usually easy to visually differentiate an SS from a &quot;plain-Jane&quot; model. However, it is more difficult to tell the difference between a genuine SS and a &quot;clone&quot;, a non-SS vehicle that has been altered to look like an SS. Because of the number of SS clones in the marketplace, potential buyers are advised to do their research and contact their local car clubs for help to ensure that the vehicle is a true SS by running the VIN codes and casting numbers on the engine (this also includes the vehicle&#x27;s build sheet especially if the SS package was a factory option). Other non-SS vehicles altered to appear like them only use trim panels rather than aftermarket mechanical parts.

<text>The Semois (; &quot;Simwès&quot; in Walloon, often under elided form &quot;Smwès&quot;; &quot;Semoy&quot;, &quot;Sesbach&quot; in German, &quot;Setzbaach&quot; in Luxembourgish of Arlon; and known as the &quot;Semoy&quot; in France) is a river flowing from the Ardennes uplands of Belgium and France towards the Meuse, of which it is a right tributary.

The source of the Semois is in Arlon, Wallonia, in the Belgian province of Luxembourg, close to the border with the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Flowing in a roughly westerly direction, it enters France after passing through the Belgian village of Bohan-sur-Semois and forms about of the Belgian–French border. It joins the Meuse further downstream in Monthermé. The total length of the river is .

Other places on the banks of the Semois are Chiny, Florenville, Herbeumont, Bouillon (including the localities of Dohan and Poupehan), and Vresse-sur-Semois (all in Belgium).

The earliest documentation of the name, as , is dated from the 2nd century AD. That was before that region was influenced by significant Germanic immigration. Medieval forms include &quot;Sesomirs&quot; (664), &quot;Sesmarus&quot; (950), &quot;Sesmoys&quot; (1104), and &quot;Semoir&quot; (1244).

The river has given its name to a variety of tobacco grown in the area.

<doc id="1281592" wikidata="Q4944039" url="?curid=1281592" title="Boots 'N' All">
<text>Boots &#x27;N&#x27; All is a Sky Sports-televised rugby league, weekly magazine programme, focusing on the Super League, Championship, League 1 and amateur game that ran until the end of 2015. Originally focusing on the lighter side of the game, the programme was the foremost rugby league programme on United Kingdom television and was broadcast every week during the regular rugby league season.

==International Syndication==
&quot;Boots &#x27;N&#x27; All&quot; is an original British television concept, but an Australian version of the show was broadcast on the Nine Network, hosted by Andrew Voss and Phil Gould. It regularly featured chairman of Bye Supporters club Tim Andrews, and Sydney Roosters mascot Brian the Rooster.

==Presenters==
The programme was anchored by Eddie Hemmings, Sky Sports regular Super League presenter and commentator, who was usually joined by two studio guests. They were usually two of: Paul Cullen, Phil Clarke, Terry O&#x27;Connor, Barrie McDermott, John Kear, Tony Rea, Jon Wells and Brian Carney.

Bill Arthur, Rod Studd and Angela Powers also provided featured reports.

==Content==
The week&#x27;s tries, plus player and coaching interviews. Traditionally broadcast on a Wednesday night, the programme was switched to a Thursday to incorporate live matches from the National Leagues during the 2007 season. The programme reverted to a Wednesday the following season and continued to broadcast live at 6pm, with regular repeats during the proceeding 24 hours.

The show usually featured a round up of the weeks news, followed by a discussion of the news. Highlights from a Championship match and previews of the weeks upcoming television matches were included. Furthermore, interviews with players, coaches and leading figures from the game often featured.

==Online==
In 2007, an online version of &quot;Boots &#x27;N&#x27; All&quot; has been available on the Sky Sports website and Sky Anytime every week during the regular Super League season. Presented by either Bill Arthur or Angela Powers, the programme consisted solely of a review of the previous weekend&#x27;s Super League action, with analysis from Terry O&#x27;Connor or Barrie McDermott.

This programme now airs on Sky Sports television under the name of Super League Full Time.

<doc id="1281601" wikidata="Q267485" url="?curid=1281601" title="Ed Vaizey">
<text>Edward Henry Butler Vaizey, Baron Vaizey of Didcot, (born 5 June 1968) is a British politician, media columnist, political commentator and barrister who was Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries from 2010 to 2016. A member of the Conservative Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Wantage from 2005 to 2019.

==Early life==
Vaizey was born in June 1968 in St Pancras, London. He is the son of the late John Vaizey, a Labour (later Conservative) life peer, and the art historian Marina Vaizey (The Lady Vaizey ). His father&#x27;s family is from South London. His mother&#x27;s family, of Polish Jewish descent, is from New York City. He spent part of his childhood in Berkshire. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London before reading history at Merton College, Oxford. Elected Librarian of the Oxford Union, he graduated with an upper second class degree. After leaving university, Vaizey worked for the Conservative MPs Kenneth Clarke and Michael Howard as an adviser on employment and education issues. He practised as a barrister for several years, in family law and child care.

==Political career==
Vaizey first stood for Parliament at the 1997 general election, when he was the Conservative Party candidate for Bristol East. In the 2001 general election, he acted as an election aide to Iain Duncan Smith. He unsuccessfully stood at the 2002 local elections for the safe Labour ward of Harrow Road (based around the area of that name) in the City of Westminster.

He is regarded as a moderniser within the Conservative Party, contributing in both policy and image terms. He was a speechwriter for Michael Howard, the then Leader of the Conservative Party, until December 2004, and editor of the &quot;Blue Books&quot; series which looked into new approaches to Conservative policy in areas such as health and transport.

Vaizey was one of Michael Howard&#x27;s inner circle of advisers and a member of a group of Young Conservatives somewhat disparagingly referred to as the &quot;Notting Hill Set&quot; along with David Cameron—elected party leader in December 2005—George Osborne, Michael Gove, Nicholas Boles and Rachel Whetstone. Like Gove and Boles, he is a fellow of the Henry Jackson Society, and also a vice-chairman of Conservative Friends of Poland.

===Member of Parliament===
In 2002, Vaizey was selected by Wantage Conservative Association to be its candidate for the 2005 general election to succeed the sitting MP, Robert Jackson, who subsequently crossed the floor to Labour. Vaizey won a two-thirds majority in the final ballot of members and was elected as MP in that election, receiving 22,394 votes. His majority was 8,017 over the Liberal Democrats; this represented 43% of the voters and a 1.9% swing from the Liberal Democrats to the Conservatives.

When first elected to the House of Commons, Vaizey became a member of the Standing Committee on the Consumer Credit Bill. Before being appointed to the Opposition frontbench he was a member of the Modernisation and Environmental Audit Select Committees and was Deputy Chairman of the Conservative&#x27;s Globalisation and Global Poverty Policy Group.

In November 2006, Vaizey was appointed to the Conservative frontbench as a Shadow Minister for Culture, overseeing Arts and Broadcasting policy.

In 2009, Ed Vaizey was reported to have claimed expenses for high-end furniture initially delivered to his London home, but intended for his constituency residence in Wantage. He later repaid the costs, acknowledging that some items were of higher quality than necessary, and stated he had not made similar claims before or since.

In the 2010 general election he received a vote of 29,284, which was 52% of the votes cast, winning an increased majority of 13,457. While the Conservative Party was in negotiations with the Lib Dems in the days after 6 May 2010, Vaizey was appearing regularly on television putting forward the Conservative viewpoint. In the 2015 general election Vaizey increased his majority to 21,749. In the 2017 general election Vaizey&#x27;s majority was reduced but his share of the vote increased to 54.2%.

Vaizey was one of the group of 21 MPs who had the Conservative Whip removed in September 2019, sitting as an independent politician until having the whip restored on 29 October 2019. On 6 November 2019 Vaizey announced his decision not to stand for re-election in the 2019 general election.

=== Ministerial career ===
In 2010, Vaizey was appointed as Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries with responsibilities in the Departments for Culture, Media and Sport and for Business, Innovation and Skills. Vaizey was the longest serving Minister of Culture since the post was created in 1964, serving a total of 2,255 days, exceeding the total set by the first incumbent, Jennie Lee, by 186 days. In 2013 the professional association for librarians, CILIP, passed a motion of no confidence in his tenure of the post at its AGM. 

Upon leaving office, over 150 senior figures from the arts and creative industries wrote to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; to express their thanks for his service as Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy. In 2011 he was mistakenly informed that he was to be Trade Minister, a post actually intended for Ed Davey.

Vaizey supported continued membership of the European Union in the 2016 referendum and is supportive of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom).

As a minister, Vaizey upheld the policy of free entry to the UK&#x27;s national museums. Towards the end of his tenure, the Treasury introduced tax credits for theatre, orchestras and museums. Vaizey also secured £150 million in capital funding from the Treasury to help reform museum storage.

He oversaw the separation of English Heritage into two arms – a regulator, now known as Historic England, and a charity, English Heritage. Vaizey also held responsibility for the creative industries and ensured the continuance of the film tax credits, as well as the introduction of tax credits for video games, television and visual effects. As a result, the film industry became the second highest contributor to growth in the service sector in 2017, growing by 72.4% since 2014, compared to European growth of 8.5%. During his tenure, the creative industries grew at three times the rate of the UK economy as a whole. He was dismissed as a minister by Theresa May on 14 July 2016, and returned to the backbenches. He was appointed a member of the Privy Council in July 2016.

=== Peerage ===
It was announced on 31 July 2020 that Vaizey was to be raised to the peerage in the 2019 Dissolution Honours. He was created Baron Vaizey of Didcot, &quot;of Wantage in the County of Oxfordshire&quot; in the afternoon of 1 September.

==Media career==
Vaizey has been a regular commentator for the Conservative Party in the broadcast and news media. He wrote regular comment pieces for &quot;The Guardian&quot; between 1998 and 2005 and has contributed articles to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. He briefly wrote editorials for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. Vaizey is also a regular broadcaster, having appeared on Fi Glover&#x27;s and Edwina Currie&#x27;s shows on BBC Radio 5 Live, as a regular panelist on Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;, BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Despatch Box&quot; and &quot;Westminster Hour&quot;, and occasionally presented &quot;People and Politics&quot; on the BBC World Service. Vaizey is a regular contributor on ITV’s Good Morning Britain, and since December 2022, Vaizey has been a regular presenter on Times Radio.

On 24 September 2010, Vaizey was named tenth in the 2010 &quot;Guardian&quot; Film Power 100 list. He played a cameo role as an Oxfordshire MP in the 2012 film &quot;Tortoise in Love&quot;.

==Other work==
Subsequent to leaving office as Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, Vaizey became a trustee of the National Youth Theatre and the international charity BritDoc, which supports long-form documentary making, both of which roles are unpaid. Vaizey is also a trustee of London Music Masters, a charity which provides children from disadvantaged backgrounds access to a high quality music education.

He was appointed the unpaid chairman of Creative Fuse NE, a programme overseen by five universities in North East England to look at the importance of fusing creativity and technology.

Vaizey took a role with LionTree Advisors who paid a salary of £50,000 for one day&#x27;s work per week. The Advisory Committee on Business Appointments approved his application to work for the investment bank, which specialises in media and technology mergers and acquisitions, despite Vaizey&#x27;s having met the firm on &quot;official business&quot; three times in his final months as minister.

He is a past president of the &quot;Old Pauline Club&quot;, the alumni association of St Paul&#x27;s School which he attended as a pupil.

== Personal life ==

<doc id="1281604" wikidata="Q498696" url="?curid=1281604" title="László Kovács (cinematographer)">
<text>László Kovács (; 14 May 1933 – 22 July 2007) was a Hungarian-American cinematographer, known for his influential work in the development of the American New Wave of films in the 1970s, he collaborated with many known directors, especially Peter Bogdanovich and Richard Rush.

Kovács was the recipient of numerous awards, including three Lifetime Achievement Awards. He was also an active member of the American Society of Cinematographers and a member of the organization&#x27;s board of directors.

==Early life==
Born in Cece, Hungary, to Julianna and Imre Kovács, Kovács studied cinema at the Academy of Drama and Film in Budapest between 1952 and 1956. Together with Vilmos Zsigmond, a fellow student and lifelong friend, Kovács secretly filmed the day-to-day development of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 on black and white 35 mm movie film, using an Arriflex camera borrowed from their school. In November that year, they smuggled the of film into Austria to have it developed, and they arrived in the United States in March 1957 to sell the footage. By that time, however, the revolution was no longer considered newsworthy and it was not until some years later, in 1961, that it was screened on the CBS television network, in a documentary narrated by Walter Cronkite.

Kovács decided to settle in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1963. He worked at several manual labor jobs, including making maple syrup and printing microfilm documents in an insurance office, before making several &quot;no-budget&quot; and &quot;low-budget&quot; films with Vilmos Zsigmond, including &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot;. At the time Kovács would be credited as Leslie Kovacs and Zsigmond as William Zsigmond.

==Film career==
Kovács&#x27; breakthrough came with the 1969 film &quot;Easy Rider&quot;, starring and directed by Dennis Hopper. Kovács was reluctant to work on this film at first, having already worked on a number of B movie biker films, such as &quot;Hells Angels on Wheels&quot;. Hopper ultimately convinced Kovács that this film would be different and Kovács signed on as the film&#x27;s director of photography. He earned second place for the Best Cinematographer Golden Laurel at the 1970 Laurel Awards. In 1970, he again worked with Hopper on the film &quot;The Last Movie&quot;. That same year, Kovács filmed &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot;, for which he received the third place Golden Laurel for Best Cinematographer.

Kovács filmed more than 70 motion pictures. Among these were six films for director Peter Bogdanovich: &quot;Targets&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, &quot;Paper Moon&quot;, &quot;At Long Last Love&quot;, &quot;Nickelodeon&quot;, and &quot;Mask&quot;. Bogdanovich worked with Kovács more times than any other cinematographer.

Other notable films Kovács photographed include &quot;For Pete&#x27;s Sake&quot;, &quot;Shampoo&quot;, &quot;New York, New York&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Ruby Cairo&quot;, &quot;Say Anything...&quot;, &quot;Radio Flyer&quot;, &quot;My Best Friend&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, and &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;. He also did additional photography on &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; and &quot;The Rose&quot;.

When working on &quot;The Last Waltz,&quot; camera operators were instructed to turn their cameras off at different intervals, in order to save battery life. One of these instances was during Muddy Waters&#x27; set, but Waters&#x27; outstanding performance led director Martin Scorsese to spontaneously change his mind, and ordered all cameras to be turned on. Because the cameras took several minutes to fully warm up, most caught only the last few bars of Waters&#x27; performance. Kovács, however, either did not hear or disregarded orders to shut down his camera, and was the only cameraman on set who managed to film Waters&#x27; entire performance.

Kovács&#x27; final work appears in &quot;Torn from the Flag&quot;, a 2006 feature documentary about the 1956 Hungarian Revolution which incorporates original footage he and Zsigmond shot as film students before fleeing to the United States.

==Personal life==
On July 22, 2007, Kovács died at his home in Beverly Hills, California at the age of 74. At the time of his death, Kovács had been married for 23 years to his wife, Audrey. He had two daughters, Julianna and Nadia, and a granddaughter, Mia.

==Awards and honors==
In 1995 he was a member of the jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.

Kovács was honored with Lifetime Achievement Awards from Camerimage (1998), WorldFest (1999), and the American Society of Cinematographers (2002). The Lifetime Achievement Award from the ASC is the organization&#x27;s highest honor. In addition, Kovács received an Excellence in Cinematography Award from the 1999 Hawaii International Film Festival and a Hollywood Film Award at the 2001 Hollywood Film Festival.

The American Society of Cinematographers dedicated the 2008 Heritage Award for top student filmmakers in memory of Kovács.

The 2008 documentary film &quot;No Subtitles Necessary: Laszlo &amp; Vilmos&quot; explores the 50-year friendship between Kovács and Zsigmond and their influence on filmmaking. Film critic Leonard Maltin said that, without Kovács and fellow cinematographer Zsigmond, &quot;the American New Wave of the late 1960s and early &#x27;70s wouldn’t have flowered as it did.&quot;

<text>The San Francisco cable car system is the world&#x27;s last manually operated cable car system and an icon of the city of San Francisco. The system forms part of the intermodal urban transport network operated by the San Francisco Municipal Railway, which also includes the separate E Embarcadero and F Market &amp; Wharves heritage streetcar lines, and the Muni Metro modern light rail system. Of the 23 cable car lines established between 1873 and 1890, only three remain (one of which combines parts of two earlier lines): two routes from downtown near Union Square to Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf, and a third route along California Street. 

While the cable cars are used to a certain extent by commuters, the vast majority of the millions of passengers who use the system every year are tourists, and as a result, the wait to get on can often reach two hours or more. They are among the most significant tourist attractions in the city, along with Alcatraz Island, the Golden Gate Bridge, and Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf. 

San Francisco&#x27;s cable cars are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is one of only two street railways to be named a National Historic Landmark, along with the St. Charles Streetcar Line in New Orleans.

==History==
===Beginnings===
In 1869, Andrew Smith Hallidie had the idea for a cable car system in San Francisco, reportedly after witnessing an accident in which a streetcar drawn by horses over wet cobblestones slid backwards, killing the horses. Hallidie solicited financial support in 1871 and 1872, and his primary backers were Henry L. Davis, Joseph Britton, and James Moffit.

The first successful cable-operated street running train was the Clay Street Hill Railroad, which had its inaugural run on August 2, 1873. The promoter of the line was Hallidie, and the engineer was William Eppelsheimer; both Hallidie and Eppelsheimer obtained several patents for their work on the Clay Street line. The line involved the use of grip cars, which carried the grip that engaged with the cable, towing trailer cars; the design was the first to use grips. The term &quot;grip&quot; became synonymous with the operator.

The line started regular service on September 1, 1873, and its success led it to become the template for other cable car transit systems. It was a financial success, and Hallidie&#x27;s patents were enforced on other cable car promoters, making him wealthy.

Accounts differ as to the precise degree of Hallidie&#x27;s involvement in the inception of the line, and to the exact date on which it first ran. According to the franchise granted by the city, operations were required to begin by August 1, 1873. A retrospective published in 1895 stated that a single car was run over the line at 4 am on the morning of August 1 with few witnesses to ensure the franchise would not expire. Eppelsheimer would later bring a suit against Hallidie and the Clay Street Hill RR in June 1877 over patents, but dismissed it voluntarily the following March.

===Expansion===

The next cable car line to open was the Sutter Street Railway, which converted from horse operation in January 1877. This line introduced the side grip, and lever operation, both designed by Henry Casebolt and his assistant Asa Hovey, and patented by Casebolt. This idea came about because Casebolt did not want to pay Hallidie royalties of $50,000 a year for the use of his patent. The side grip allowed cable cars to cross at intersections.

In 1878, Leland Stanford opened his California Street Cable Railroad (Cal Cable). This company&#x27;s first line was on California Street, and is the oldest cable car line still in operation. In 1880, the Geary Street, Park &amp; Ocean Railway began operation. The Presidio and Ferries Railway followed two years later, and was the first cable company to include curves on its routes. The curves were &quot;let-go&quot; curves, in which the car drops the cable and coasts around the curve on its own momentum.

In 1883, the Market Street Cable Railway opened its first line. This company was controlled by the Southern Pacific Railroad and would grow to become San Francisco&#x27;s largest cable car operator. At its peak, it operated five lines, all of which converged on Market Street to a common terminus at the Ferry Building. During rush hours, cars left that terminus every 15 seconds.

In 1888, the Ferries and Cliff House Railway opened its initial two-line system. The Powell–Mason line is still operated on the same route today; their other route was the Powell–Washington–Jackson line, stretches of which are used by today&#x27;s Powell–Hyde line. The Ferries &amp; Cliff House Railway was also responsible for the building of a car barn and powerhouse at Washington and Mason, and this site is still in use today. In the same year, it also purchased the original Clay Street Hill Railway, which it incorporated into a new Sacramento–Clay line in 1892.

In 1889, the Omnibus Railroad and Cable Company became the last new cable car operator in San Francisco. The following year the California Street Cable Railroad opened two new lines, these being the last entirely new cable car lines built in the city. One of them was the O&#x27;Farrell–Jones–Hyde line, the Hyde section of which still remains in operation as part of the current Powell–Hyde line.

In all, twenty-three lines were established between 1873 and 1890.


===Evolution of motive power===
Originally, the cables were powered by stationary steam engines. For its initial three cables, the Ferries &amp; Cliff House Railway constructed a three-story structure to house two coal-burning steam engines. The building was complete with a smokestack to vent away the heavy black smoke created by the Welsh anthracite coal that the company burned. Expansion of service required two additional coal-fired steam engines in 1890. Coal consumption in 1893 was about 10 tons per day. The system was converted from coal to oil burning in 1901, and the lessened amount of smoke allowed the smokestack to be shortened to . This shortened smokestack still stands at Washington-Mason car barn today.

Electric energy was introduced in 1912, when a General Electric motor came online. By 1926, all steam operation of the cable ended when a second electric drive was installed, a General Electric motor. With the reduction in the number of cable car lines, the single 750-horsepower electric motor was eventually able to take over the job of running all of the lines. The limitation with that configuration was that if one cable car on one line broke down, all lines had to be stopped. Consequently, during the 1984 reconstruction, each of the four cables (California, Hyde, Mason and Powell) was separately powered by its own electric motor.

===Decline===
The first electric streetcars in San Francisco began operation in 1892 under the auspices of the San Francisco and San Mateo Electric Railway.

By the beginning of 1906 many of San Francisco&#x27;s remaining cable cars were under the control of the United Railroads of San Francisco (URR), although Cal Cable and the Geary Street Company remained independent. URR was pressing to convert many of its cable lines to overhead electric traction, but this was met with resistance from opponents who objected to what they saw as ugly overhead lines on the major thoroughfares of the city center.

Those objections disappeared after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The quake and resulting fire destroyed the power houses and car barns of both the Cal Cable and the URR&#x27;s Powell Street lines, together with the 117 cable cars stored within them. The subsequent race to rebuild the city allowed the URR to replace most of its cable car lines with electric streetcar lines. By 1912, only eight cable car lines remained, all with steep grades impassable to electric streetcars. In the 1920s and 1930s, these remaining lines came under pressure from the much-improved motor buses of the era, which could now climb steeper hills than the electric streetcar. By 1944, five of those cable car lines had survived: the two Powell Street lines – by then under municipal ownership, as part of Muni – and the three lines owned by the still-independent Cal Cable.

===Fight to remain open===
In 1947, Mayor Roger Lapham proposed the closure of the two municipally owned lines. In response, a joint meeting of 27 women&#x27;s civic groups, led by Friedel Klussmann, formed the &quot;Citizens&#x27; Committee to Save the Cable Cars&quot;. In a famous battle of wills, the citizens&#x27; committee eventually forced a referendum on an amendment to the city charter, compelling the city to continue operating the Powell Street lines. This passed overwhelmingly, by 166,989 votes to 51,457. Klussman led another campaign in 1948 to have the city acquire Cal Cable, but the referendum fell short of the required majority, with 58% in favor of acquisition; a second referendum in 1949, requiring a simple majority, passed and the city began negotiations with Cal Cable.

In August 1951, the three Cal Cable lines were shut down when the company was unable to afford insurance. The city purchased and reopened the lines in January 1952, but another referendum that would have funded maintenance for the California Street tracks and the powerhouse and car barn at Hyde and California failed in November 1953. The amendment to the city charter did not protect the newly acquired Cal Cable lines, and the city proceeded with plans to replace them with buses; in addition, businesses in Union Square and downtown began advancing plans to convert O&#x27;Farrell to automobile traffic, which would remove service through the Tenderloin district via the inner section of the O&#x27;Farrell Jones &amp; Hyde line. The result was a compromise that formed the current system: the California Street line from Cal Cable, the Powell–Mason line already in municipal ownership, and a third hybrid line formed by grafting the Hyde Street section of Cal Cable&#x27;s O&#x27;Farrell-Jones-Hyde line onto a truncated Powell–Washington–Jackson line, now known as the Powell–Hyde line.

This solution required some rebuilding to convert the Hyde Street trackage and terminus to operation by the single-ended cars of the Powell line, and also to allow the whole system to be operated from a single car barn and power house. Despite the changes, much of the systems infrastructure remained unchanged from the time of the earthquake.

===Rebuild===

By 1979, the cable car system had become unsafe; it needed to be closed for seven months for urgently-needed repairs. A subsequent engineering evaluation concluded that it needed comprehensive rebuilding at a cost of US$60 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Mayor Dianne Feinstein, who took charge of the effort, helped win federal funding for the bulk of the rebuilding job. In 1982, the cable car system was closed for the rebuild which involved the replacement of 69 city blocks&#x27; worth of tracks and cable channels, a rebuilding of the car barn and powerhouse within the original outer brick walls, new propulsion equipment, and the repair or rebuild of 37 cable cars. The Historic Trolley Festival was launched the following June as an expected-to-be-temporary substitute tourist attraction during the long closure. The system reopened on June 21, 1984, in time to benefit from the publicity that accompanied San Francisco&#x27;s hosting of that year&#x27;s Democratic National Convention.

===Recent history===

Since 1984, Muni has continued to upgrade the system. Work has included rebuilding historic cars, building brand new replacement cars, building a new terminal and turntable at the Hyde and Beach terminus, and a new turntable at the Powell and Market terminus.

Between 2017 and 2019, the system received a second, but less extensive rebuild. Over the two-year project, Muni rehabilitated the cable car system&#x27;s gearboxes, which had been in service since the last rebuild in 1984.

The system was shut down in March 2020 to protect operators during the COVID-19 pandemic, as cable cars do not offer a compartment separating them from passengers (unlike Muni buses, which kept running). Limited service on all three lines resumed on August 2, 2021. Full revenue service began on September 4. On September 9, a valve failure caused the fire suppression system in the carbarn to activate, shutting down electric power to the powerhouse. Service resumed on September 18.

=== Controversies ===
The cable cars are an iconic part of San Francisco, but they are not without their critics. Most complaints center around the high cost of operating a system that mostly serves tourists, and the large number of accidents involving the cable cars.

The cable car lines serve around seven million passengers per year, but the vast majority are tourists, rather than commuters. The area where the cable cars operate is well-served by a large number of buses and trolleybuses that often give residents better options for their trips. Also, during busy times, the wait to board a cable car can often reach two hours or more. 

While Muni does allow monthly passholders to ride the cable cars at no additional charge, single-ride fares are more than triple the fares charged on other Muni routes. The high fares led the San Francisco Chronicle to describe the cable cars in 2017 as a &quot;cash cow&quot; for Muni, yielding a yearly revenue of around $30 million. Still, according to Mission Local, the cable car system had a $46 million operating deficit in 2019. In 2006, then-Mayor Gavin Newsom reported that he had observed several conductors pocketing cash fares from riders without receipt. The following year, the San Francisco auditor&#x27;s office reported that the city was not receiving the expected revenue from cable cars, with an estimated 40% of cable car riders riding for free. Muni&#x27;s management disputed this figure and pointed out that safe operation, rather than revenue collection, is the primary duty of conductors. In 2017, after an audit showing that some conductors were &quot;consistently turn[ing] in low amounts of cash&quot;, as well as a sting operation, one conductor was arrested on charges of felony embezzlement.

Among U.S. mass transportation systems the cable cars have the most accidents per year and per vehicle mile, with 126 accidents and 151 injuries reported in the 10 years ending 2013. In the three years ending 2013 the city paid some $8 million to settle four dozen cable car accident claims.

==Operation==
===Cables and grip===
The cable cars are pulled by a cable running below the street, held by a grip that extends from the car through a slit in the street surface, between the rails. Each cable is in diameter, running at a constant speed of , and driven by a electric motor located in the central power house (see below), via a set of self-adjusting sheaves. Each cable has six steel strands, with each strand containing 19 wires, wrapped around a sisal rope core (to allow easier gripping). The cable is coated with a synthetic lubricant to reduce wear and friction. Historically, pine tar was used to lubricate the cable. To start and stop the movement of the car, the grip operator (see below) closes and opens the grip around the cable (similar to the clutch of a conventional car). The grip&#x27;s jaws exert a pressure of up to on the cable. Due to wear and tear, a grip&#x27;s dies have to be replaced after three days of usage.

There are four separate cables: one length and one length for the Hyde and Mason segments, a length for their common Powell section, and one length for the California Street line.
=== Brakes ===
Apart from the cable itself (which limits the speeds of cars when going downhill), the cable cars use three separate braking systems:
* Metal brake shoes on the wheels. The single-ended cars used on the Powell–Mason and Powell–Hyde lines have a foot pedal, controlled by the grip operator, that applies the brakes on the front wheels and a handle, operated by the conductor, that applies the brakes on the rear wheels. On the double-ended cars used on the California St. line, there are pedals near both grips, one controlled by the grip operator, the other by the conductor.
* Wooden brake blocks pressed against the track when the gripman pulls a lever. The four blocks are made of Monterey Fir and can produce a smell of burning wood when in operation. They have to be replaced after just a few days.
* An emergency brake consisting of a piece of steel, around thick and long, suspended beneath the car and pushed into the track slot when the gripman pulls a red lever. It wedges tightly into the slot and often has to be removed with a cutting torch.

=== Electrical system ===
Over the years, the cable cars have been retrofitted with several electrical components, including headlights, interior lighting, a GPS tracking system and cameras. However, unlike most modern trains, the cable cars have no method to generate power on board and instead must use large batteries that are recharged in the car barn. In 2018, the incandescent bulbs used for the headlights and interior lighting were replaced with LED bulbs which increased visibility for operators and had a lower drain on the batteries.

===Network===
The current cable car network consists of three routes:

* The Powell–Mason (Line 59 or PM)&lt;ref name=&quot;59/60 Maps&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; line, follows a common route with the Powell–Hyde line, running north and steeply uphill from a terminal at Powell and Market Streets, before crossing the California Street line at the crest of the hill. Once California Street has been crossed, cars coast downhill, off the cable, for three and a half blocks until the lines split as they turn left onto Jackson Street (as this is one-way, cable cars in the opposite direction use the parallel Washington Street). This line turns North, merges, and continues downhill along Mason Street, briefly half left along Columbus Avenue, and then down Taylor Street to a terminal at Taylor and Bay. This terminus is two blocks south of Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf and is the closest to Pier 39. As with the Powell–Hyde line, there are manually-powered turntables at each end to reverse the cars. The Powell–Mason line has been in operation since 1888.
* The Powell–Hyde (Line 60 or PH) line, follows a common route with the Powell–Mason line, running north and steeply uphill from a terminal at Powell and Market Streets, before crossing the California Street line at the crest of the hill. Once California Street has been crossed, cars coast downhill, off the cable, for three and a half blocks until the lines split as they turn left onto Jackson Street. As this section is one-way, cable cars in the opposite direction use the parallel Washington Street. The cars on this line continue uphill on Jackson/Washington to a crest at Hyde Street. Here the line turns North past the &quot;crooked&quot; Lombard Street, then runs steeply downhill (at 21%, the steepest grade in the cable car system) along Hyde Street, to the Hyde and Beach terminal, which is adjacent to the waterfront at the San Francisco Maritime Museum and Ghirardelli Square. As with the Powell–Mason line, there are manually-powered turntables at each end to reverse the cars. The line was spliced together in 1957 using portions of the O&#x27;Farrell, Jones &amp; Hyde line and the Washington–Jackson line. Because this line offers iconic views of Alcatraz Island, passes Lombard Street and terminates near popular tourist destinations, it is the most popular with tourists and often has long waits to board.
* The California Street (Line 61 or C) line runs east and west on California Street from a terminal at California and Market Streets, close to the famed Embarcadero to Van Ness Avenue. The California Street cable cars use double-ended cars with &quot;grip&quot; levers at either end of the longer cars which are operated in each direction without the cars being turned at the ends of the line, where the double tracks converge into a single &quot;stub-end&quot; track. The line once ran a much longer distance from Presidio Avenue to Market Street but service west of Van Ness Avenue was discontinued in 1954. Calls to restore the route to its original length are heard from time to time but nothing serious towards this end has been proposed. This route runs only on California Street, running at first uphill to the summit of Nob Hill, then more gently downhill to a terminus at Van Ness Avenue. This line is used to a greater extent by commuters, with the majority of passengers on weekdays being commuters.

There is also a set of non-revenue tracks from the California Street line along Hyde Street to join the Powell–Hyde line at Hyde and Washington. This connection exists to enable California Street cars to reach the car barn.

A small signal tower controls the crossing of the lines at the intersection of California Street and Powell Street. It has been rebuilt in 1907, 1937, 1967, and 2020–2021.

===Fares===

As of January 1, 2020, riding a cable car costs $8 for a single ride, except for seniors riding before 7 am or after 9 pm when the fare is $4. Cable car rides are included in monthly Muni passes, as well as 1-day, 3-day, 7-day passes, and the CityPASS program. Passes loaded on a Clipper card can be read by the conductor with a mobile device. Transfers or fare receipts are not accepted. In the 1960s, the fare for a single ride was 15 cents.

===Cars===
There are 27 cars in rotation when the system is operating. They come in two kinds:

* Single-ended cars serve the Powell–Hyde and Powell–Mason lines. These cars have an open-sided front section, with outward-facing seats flanking the gripman and a collection of levers that actuate the grip and various brakes. The rear half of the car is enclosed with seats facing inward and entrances at each end, and the car has a small platform at the rear. These cars are long and wide and weigh . They have a passenger capacity of 60, 29 of them seated. These cars must be rotated to reverse direction at each end of the line, an operation performed on turntables. Most of these cars were built or rebuilt at Muni&#x27;s Woods Carpentry Division.
* Double-ended cars serve the California Street line. These cars are somewhat longer, having open-sided grip sections at both ends and an enclosed section in the middle. These cars are long and wide and weigh . They can hold 68 passengers, 34 of them seated. The California Street line lacks turning capabilities at each end, resulting in the necessity of the double-ended cars. Some of these cars are former O&#x27;Farrell, Jones, and Hyde Street cable cars, while some cars were built at Muni&#x27;s Woods Carpentry Division.

There are 28 single-ended cars available for operation on the Powell lines and 12 double-ended cars on the California Street line. 

Both types of car ride on a pair of four-wheel trucks, to fit the track&#x27;s narrow gauge. The term &quot;California Street car&quot;, as in a car running on the California Street line, should not be confused with the term &quot;California Car&quot;. The latter term applies to all the cable cars currently operating in San Francisco and is a historical term distinguishing this style of car from an earlier style where the open grip section and the enclosed section were separate four-wheel cars (known as the grip car and trailer).

The cable cars are occasionally replaced with new or restored cars, with the old cars being moved to storage for later restoration. There are two historic cable cars in storage in the cable car museum: car numbers 19 and 42, which were used on the Sacramento-Clay and O&#x27;Farrell, Jones and Hyde Street lines, respectively.

===Car barn, power house, and museum===
The cable-car barn is located between Washington and Jackson Streets just uphill of where Mason Street crosses them. Cars reverse into the barn off Jackson Street and run out into Washington Street, coasting downhill for both moves. To ensure that single-ended cars leave facing in the correct direction, the car barn contains a fourth turntable. Cars are moved around the car barn with the assistance of a rubber-tired tractor.

As of 2018, the cable-car barn was staffed with 17 mechanics, six custodians, three carpenters, two painters, two supervisors and one superintendent.

The car barn is situated directly west of the power house and the Cable Car Museum. The museum&#x27;s entrance is at Washington and Mason. It contains several examples of old cable cars, together with smaller exhibits and a shop. Two galleries allow the visitor to overlook the main power house, and also to descend below the junction of Washington and Mason Streets and see the large cavern where the cables are routed out to the street via huge sheaves.

===Crew===
The car is driven by the &quot;grip&quot;, whose job requires strength, coordination, and balance. The grip must smoothly grip and release the cable, know the points at which the grip must be released to coast over intersecting lines or places where the cable does not follow the tracks, and maintain clearance from other traffic. The &quot;conductor&quot; collects fares, manages crowding, and controls the rear-wheel brakes on some hills.

On the second or third Thursday of each July, a cable car bell-ringing contest is held in Union Square between cable car crews, following a preliminary round held during the second to last or the last week of June. The preliminary round determines which contestants go on to the finals in Union Square, by a process of points awarded by a panel of judges.

<doc id="1281608" wikidata="Q940733" url="?curid=1281608" title="Christiansborg Palace">
<text>Christiansborg Palace (; ) is a palace and government building on the islet of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen, Denmark. It is the seat of the Danish Parliament (&quot;&quot;), the Danish Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, and the Supreme Court of Denmark. Also, several parts of the palace are used by the Danish monarch, including the Royal Reception Rooms, the Palace Chapel and the Royal Stables.

The palace is thus home to the three supreme powers: the executive power, the legislative power, and the judicial power. It is the only building in the world that houses all three of a country&#x27;s branches of government. The name Christiansborg is thus also frequently used as a metonym for the Danish political system, and colloquially it is often referred to as Rigsborgen (&#x27;the castle of the realm&#x27;) or simply Borgen (&#x27;the castle&#x27;).

The present building, the third with this name, is the last in a series of successive castles and palaces constructed on the same site since the erection of the first castle in 1167. Since the early fifteenth century, the various buildings have served as the base of the central administration; until 1794 as the principal residence of the Danish kings and after 1849 as the seat of parliament.

The palace today bears witness to three eras of Danish architecture, as the result of two serious fires. The first fire occurred in 1794 and the second in 1884. The main part of the current palace, finished in 1928, is in the historicist Neo-baroque style. The chapel dates back to 1826 and is in a neoclassical style. The showgrounds were built from 1738 to 1746, in a baroque style.

Christiansborg Palace is owned by the Danish Government, and is run by the Palaces and Properties Agency. Several parts of the palace are open to the public.

==History==
===Absalon&#x27;s Castle===
The first castle on the site was Absalon&#x27;s Castle, built in 1167 by the bishop Absalon. According to the Danish chronicler Saxo Grammaticus, Bishop Absalon of Roskilde built a castle in 1167 on a small island outside Copenhagen Harbour. The castle was made up by a curtain wall, encircling an enclosed courtyard with several buildings, such as the bishop&#x27;s palace, a chapel and several minor buildings.

At the death of Absalon in 1201, possession of the castle and city of Copenhagen passed to the bishops of Roskilde. A few decades later, however, a bitter feud erupted between crown and church, and for almost two centuries the ownership of the castle and city was contested between kings and bishops. Furthermore, the castle was frequently under attack, for example by Wend pirates and the Hanseatic cities, and during the years 1249 to 1259 it was occupied and plundered.

In 1370, King Valdemar IV of Denmark was defeated in a conflict with the Hanseatic League, who ordered the castle to be demolished. They sent 40 stonemasons to demolish the castle stone by stone. The castle had long been a terrible nuisance to the Hanseatic cities&#x27; trade in the Sound, and the time had now come to remove it.

===Copenhagen Castle===
During the years after the demolition of Bishop Absalon&#x27;s castle by the Hansa League in 1369, the ruins on the island were covered with earthworks, on which a new stronghold, Copenhagen Castle, was built. This was completed in the late 14th century. The castle had a curtain wall and was surrounded by a moat and with a large, solid tower as an entrance gate.

The castle was still the property of the Bishop of Roskilde until King Eric VII usurped the rights to the castle in 1417. From then on the castle in Copenhagen was occupied by the king. In the middle of the 15th century, the castle became the principal residence of the Danish kings and the centre of government.

The castle was rebuilt several times. In the 1720s, Frederick IV entirely rebuilt the castle, but it became so heavy that the walls began to give way and to crack. It became therefore evident to Christian VI, Frederik IV&#x27;s successor, immediately after his accession to the throne in 1730, that an entirely new castle had to be built.

The demolition of the overextended and antiquated Copenhagen Castle was commenced in 1731 to make room for the first Christiansborg. The ruins of Absalon&#x27;s castle and Copenhagen Castle were excavated at the start of the 20th century and can be seen today in the subterranean excavations under the present palace.

===First Christiansborg===
King Christian VI commissioned architect Elias David Häusser to build the first Christiansborg Palace (Danish, &quot;Christiansborg Slot&quot;), and in 1733 work started on a magnificent baroque palace. By 1738, work on the main palace had progressed so far that it was possible to start on the other buildings included in the total project. The palace included show grounds and chapel. Most of the palace complex was completed in 1745 and was the largest palace in northern Europe at the time.

The palace and church were ruined by a fire in 1794, but the showgrounds were saved.

===Second Christiansborg===

While the royal family lived in temporary accommodations at Amalienborg Palace, the master builder of Altona, architect Christian Frederik Hansen, was called to Copenhagen to resurrect the palace. Hansen started building the second Christiansborg in 1803 in a French Empire style. By the time the palace was finished in 1828, King Frederick VI had decided he did not want to live there after all, and he only used the palace for entertainment. King Frederick VII was the only monarch to live in the palace. This was between 1852 and 1863.

After the introduction of the constitutional monarchy with the Constitution of 1849, the south wing of the palace became the meeting place of the two houses of the first Danish Parliament (the Rigsdagen).

The second Christiansborg burned down in 1884. The showgrounds, including the Riding School, court theatre and Hansen&#x27;s chapel were saved. The ruins remained in place for the following 23 years due to political fighting.

===Third Christiansborg===

Thorvald Jørgensen won an architecture competition to decide who would design the third (and current) Christiansborg, which was built from 1907 to 1928. The palace was to contain premises for the royal family, the legislature and the judiciary, and was built in Neo-baroque style in reinforced concrete with granite-covered facades. Fragments from C.F. Hansen&#x27;s palace were preserved in the north facade facing Prince George&#x27;s Yard (&quot;Prins Jørgens Gård&quot;). The original roof was tiled, but after a national collection, the tiles were replaced with copper in 1937–1938. A weather vane with two crowns was later added to the tower, and at 106 meters became the tallest tower in the city.

During the digging work, they came across the ruins of Absalon&#x27;s Castle and Copenhagen Castle. It was decided to make them publicly accessible, and the ruins under the current palace, and the historical exhibition opened to the public in 1924.

==Christiansborg Palace today==

The palace is roughly divided in the middle, with the Parliament located in the southern wing and the Royal Reception Rooms, the Supreme Court and the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office in the northern wing.

Several parts of the palace are open to the public after published schedule with guided tours available, for a substantial fee. It is centrally located in Copenhagen&#x27;s Indre By (&quot;City Center&quot;) district.

===Royal Reception Rooms===
The Royal Reception Rooms at Christiansborg Palace are located on the ground floor and first floor in the northern half of the palace. The Rooms are used for official functions of the monarch such as banquets, state dinners, the New Year&#x27;s levée, diplomatic accreditations, audiences and meetings of the council of state.

The Reception Rooms are richly adorned with furniture and works of art rescued from the two earlier palaces, as well as decorations by some of the best Danish artists, such as Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard, Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg, Laurits Tuxen, Joakim Skovgaard and Bjørn Nørgaard.

To reach the Royal Reception Rooms one goes through the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Gate&quot; (Dronningeporten), and through the &quot;Hall of the Halberdiers&quot; (Drabantsalen) to the &quot;King&#x27;s Stairway&quot; (Kongetrappen). At the foot of the stairs are the &quot;Audience Chamber&quot; (Audiensgemakket) and the &quot;State Council Room&quot; (Statsrådssalen). The King holds an audience every other Monday and attends Council with the government as required – usually on Wednesdays. The King in Council signs new Acts after their adoption in Parliament. The Audience Chamber and the State Council Room are the only Royal Reception Rooms that are closed to the public.

The King&#x27;s Stairway gives access to the &quot;Tower Hall&quot; (Tårnsalen). The Tower Hall displays a series of tapestries with motifs from Danish folk songs, woven after cartoons painted by Joakim Skovgaard.

Facing the Palace Square is the oval &quot;Throne Room&quot; (Tronsalen) where foreign ambassadors present their credentials to King Frederik X. The Throne Room gives access to the balcony where the Danish monarchs are proclaimed. The Throne Room is decorated with a large ceiling painting by Kræsten Iversen, depicting how the Danish flag, Dannebrog, fell from the sky in Estonia in 1219.

The Royal Reception Rooms also include the &quot;Fredensborg Hall&quot; (Fredensborgsalen), with Laurits Tuxen&#x27;s painting of King Christian IX and his whole family together at Fredensborg Palace, and parts of the Queen&#x27;s Library.
The Great Hall is the largest and most spectacular of the Royal Reception Rooms. The Hall is 40 metres long with a ceiling height of 10 metres, and a gallery runs all the way around the room. The Hall seats 400 guests and is used for banquets, state dinners and receptions.

The Great Hall was renovated on the occasion of Queen Margrethe II&#x27;s 60th birthday when artist Bjørn Nørgaard&#x27;s 17 tapestries recounting the history of Denmark were hung on the walls. The tapestries were a gift from the Danish business community on the occasion of Queen Margrethe II&#x27;s 50th birthday.

The &quot;Alexander Hall&quot; (Alexandersalen) is named for Bertel Thorvaldsen&#x27;s marble frieze &quot;Alexander the Great Enters Babylon&quot;. The frieze was made for the second Christiansborg Palace, and parts of it survived the fire. It was later restored and mounted in this room. The Hall is used for smaller receptions and official dinners, often in connection with state visits.

===Parliament Wing===


The first floor of the Parliament Wing is structured around the Lobby. At both ends of Lobby are the chambers of Rigsdagen, the former bicameral parliament; the Folketing chamber is located at the far end and the Landsting located at the other (the far chamber has been the only one in use since the Folketing became the sole legislative assembly in 1953). Along the hall are various rooms such as the Speaker&#x27;s office and offices for the administration.

===Ruins under the palace===
Under the present palace lie the ruins of Bishop Absalon&#x27;s Castle and Copenhagen Castle. When the foundations of the present Christiansborg Palace were being cast, workers came across ruins of several buildings and parts of a curtain wall.

Experts were called in from the National Museum of Denmark and the ruins, which lay beneath the inner palace yard, were unearthed. Public interest in these ruins, which dated back to around the year 1167, was tremendous. It was therefore decided that the ruins should not be covered over again but preserved for posterity. The reinforced concrete structure erected to cover the ruins was the biggest of its kind in Denmark when it was built in 1908.

The ruins beneath the palace square were excavated in 1917 and a cover was also built over them. The ruins have been open to the public since 1924. The Ruins Exhibition was renovated during the period 1974–77 and has remained more or less untouched since then.

===The Palace Chapel===
Christiansborg Palace Chapel is a part of the palace which is at the disposal of the Danish monarch. It is used for religious ceremonies for members of the Danish royal family, most notably baptisms, confirmations and official lying in state. It is also used by the Danish Parliament for the Church service in connection with the opening of parliament.

The history of Christiansborg Palace Chapel goes back to the first Christiansborg Palace, which was built by the contractor general Elias David Häusser from 1733 to 1745. King Christian VI was keen on architecture, and he commissioned a talented young architect in the King&#x27;s building service, Nicolai Eigtved, to design the palace chapel (1738–42). Eigtved seized the opportunity and designed one of the most distinguished Rococo interiors in Denmark.

In 1794 fire ravaged the palace and it was decided to demolish the ruins completely. The demolition, however, never took place.

Architect Christian Frederik Hansen, who resurrected the palace between 1803 and 1828, was also commissioned to rebuild the palace chapel in 1810. Work commenced in 1813, using the existing foundations and masonry as far as possible. The church and main palace were built in strict neo-classical style, with a dome construction on top of a central church interior. The palace chapel was inaugurated on Whit Sunday, 14 May 1826, to mark the 1,000 anniversary of the introduction of Christianity to Denmark.

The second palace fire in 1884 spared the church, as the fire was stopped in the buildings linking it to the palace. However, fate finally caught up with the church on 7 June 1992. The church burned to the ground, probably set ablaze by fireworks set off during the Whitsun carnival.

During the 1992 church fire, the roof, dome and dividing floor were burned down and the inventory severely damaged. Shortly afterwards, the Danish Ministry of Finance&#x27;s Palaces and Properties Agency began rebuilding the chapel in collaboration with Erik Møller&#x27;s Drawing Studio A/S and Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings Jens Fredslund. No drawings existed of the dome and roof, but a systematic exercise in building archaeology registered the charred remains of the building, and made it possible to recreate the dome and roof. Historically accurate building methods were also used throughout the rebuilding process.

Danish craftsmen were unable to undertake the difficult work of restoring and recreating the interior&#x27;s scagliola. One of Germany&#x27;s leading experts, Manfred Siller, took charge and taught the venerable technique to Danish stucco workers.

The rebuilt church was inaugurated on 14 January 1997 to celebrate Queen Margrethe II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. The rebuilding was awarded the prestigious Europa Nostra prize.

===Riding Ground Complex===
The Show Grounds are now all that remain of the first Christiansborg Palace. They consist of two symmetrical wings with a straight, low and narrow stable building followed by a high broad building and narrow, curved stables, after which a one-story narrow end building closes off the wings at the Frederiksholm Canal end.

In 1742, the north wing became the first one to be finished. Building work on the south wing started in June 1740 but ground to a halt by the autumn due to difficulties in obtaining supplies. Work did not recommence until January 1744, now under the supervision of the young architect Nicolai Eigtved. In 1746, 87 hunting horses and 165 carriage horses moved into the new stables, the largest number ever.

In 1766–67, the architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin built a court theatre on the floor above the big stables. It now houses the Theatre Museum.

The Royal Stables are home to the horses and carriages used to perform the ceremonial transport for the Danish royal family during state events and festive occasions. In 1789 the number of horses reached a peak with 270 horses stabled. Today, there are about 20 horses left, and some parts of the original stable buildings have been converted into offices and garages.

From 2007 to 2009 the Royal Stables underwent a thorough renovation to meet the requirements of current animal welfare law.
A Riding School is located in the northern wing of the Riding Ground Complex, opposite the Court Theatre. The Riding School is used for horse shows and to exercise the horses of the Royal Stables. On occasion it is also used for various cultural events such as opera or theatre performances.

The interior is more or less unchanged since the construction in the 1740s. It is equipped with a balcony and a royal box to allow audiences the possibility to attend exercises and performances. The royal box is unique as it is the only royal room preserved from the first palace.

====The Court Theatre====
The Court Theatre is located over the stables in the southern wing of the Riding Ground Complex, opposite the Riding School. Since 1922 the Court Theatre has housed the collection of the Theatre Museum. The auditorium is often used for theatre performances, lectures and television programmes.

Already at the Copenhagen Castle, one of the wings was fitted out as a theatre. However, the first Christiansborg Palace was constructed without a theatre. During the early reign of King Christian VII it became customary to have theatre performances in the Banqueting Hall, and in 1766 it was decided to construct a proper court theatre. A harness storeroom was adapted to an auditorium. The theatre was designed by the French architect Nicolas-Henri Jardin and inaugurated by King Christian VII and Queen Caroline Matilda in January 1767. Little remains of this original theatre as it was reconstructed in 1842 following the designs of architect Jørgen Hansen Koch. In time the Court Theatre came to function as an annex to the Royal Danish Theatre. In 1881 the theatre was closed as performance venue following the tragic fire of the Ringtheater in Vienna which underlined the dangers involved in the continued use of old theatres.

===The Tower===

In June 2014, a viewing platform in the Tower, still the tallest in the city, was made accessible to the public, while the interior of the Tower was refurbished and a restaurant opened in place of what was once a storage room. Access to the viewing platform is free, though passing through a security check is required due to the official nature of the building. There is a comfortable lift giving access to upper levels.

====The View====

The View, an observation deck of the Tower, gives an opportunity to enjoy the views of the following buildings:

===Other features===

====The Marble Bridge and the pavilions====

In Häusser&#x27;s original project from the first Christiansborg, the two wings of the palace were linked by a gatehouse at the Frederiksholm Canal end, and a drawbridge led over the canal. The Palace Building Commission was not completely satisfied with the proposal and asked two young architects working for the royal building authority, Nicolai Eigtved and Lauritz de Thurah, to come up with an alternative suggestion.

Their proposal included a permanent bridge over Frederiksholm Canal forming the main entrance to the palace and two portal pavilions flanking an open drive and closing the complex off between the two wings. Both bridge and pavilions were in the new rococo style.

Responsibility was transferred to Eigtved, who was the prime mover behind the project.

The bridge was extremely elegant— sandstone covered with medallion decorations by the sculptor Louis August le Clerc. The pavements were paved with Norwegian marble, hence the name the Marble Bridge (&quot;Marmorbro&quot;), and the roadway paved with cobblestones.

The pavilions were every bit as magnificent as the bridge. They were covered with sandstone from Saxony, and the sculptor Johan Christof Petzoldt richly decorated the concave roofs with the royal couple&#x27;s back-to-back monograms and four figures on each roof symbolising the royal couple&#x27;s positive traits. The interior decoration was by the court&#x27;s master stonemason Jacob Fortling. The bridge and pavilions were finished in 1744.

In 1996, when Copenhagen was European Capital of Culture, the Palaces and Properties Agency finished a restoration of the Showgrounds that had taken many years. The Marble Bridge and Pavilions were restored between 1978 and 1996 by architect Erik Hansen and the Show Grounds from 1985–1996 by Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings Gehrdt Bornebusch.

====King Christian IX&#x27;s equestrian statue====

A collection was started for the construction of a monument to King Christian IX shortly after his death in 1906. The following year four artists were invited to compete for the commission. There was no discussion about the position of the statue. It would be erected on Christiansborg Riding Ground Complex as a pendant to the statue of King Frederick VII on the Palace Square.

Sculptor Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen, the wife of composer Carl Nielsen, won the competition with her proposal for a new equestrian statue. In the proposal, the statue was shown on a high pedestal, on the sides of which were reliefs depicting a procession of the leading men of the day, including industrialist Carl Frederik Tietgen, politician Jakob Brønnum Scavenius Estrup and poets Jens Peter Jacobsen and Holger Drachmann. The reliefs were later axed, and the architect Andreas Clemmensen designed the pedestal that bears the horse today.

The sculptor sought throughout the country for the right horse to stand as a model, but found it in Hanover in Germany. This gave rise to a good deal of displeasure among Danish horse breeders.

The monument took a long time to complete, but in 1927, 21 years after the king&#x27;s death, it was unveiled on the Riding Ground Complex.

<text>Andrew Voss (born 7 September 1966) is an Australian rugby league commentator and radio and television personality who works for Fox League.

Voss previously worked for the SKY Network Television as a commentator, and at the Nine Network, including &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;NRL Footy Show&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Footy Show&quot; and &quot;The Sunday Roast&quot;. He and Eddie Hemmings are the two commentators for the video game Rugby League Live 4.

==Career==
In the 1990s and 2000s, Voss hosted several of the Nine Network&#x27;s rugby league-related TV shows. He began appearing on &quot;The Footy Show&quot; in 1997 as a regular guest, starring in different sketches and in group discussions.

In time, he was the Nine&#x27;s Network&#x27;s number-two rugby league caller behind Ray Warren. In 2012, he was demoted to the number-three caller behind Ray Hadley. This occurred after Hadley strongly and personally criticised Voss for jokingly questioning on-air the likeness of a statue of Warren erected in Warren&#x27;s hometown of Junee, New South Wales. Voss then sued Hadley for defamation, and the matter was settled out of court. It was revealed in 2011 that Voss had had a long-running feud with Hadley, dating back to 1994 when they both worked at Sydney radio station 2UE.

Voss has covered various other sporting events, including the Sydney Olympic Games, Melbourne Commonwealth Games and the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games. He travelled to London to cover the 2012 Summer Olympics.

In 2006, Voss was the lead commentator on &quot;Torvill and Dean&#x27;s Dancing on Ice.&quot;

In 2009, Andrew was a fill-in sports presenter on the Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; between Mondays and Thursdays, in addition to presenting every Friday in place of Cameron Williams.

Also in 2009, Voss hosted &quot;Australia&#x27;s Greatest Athlete&quot; for the Nine Network, a program which screened on Saturday afternoons.

He joined UK Premier Sports as the lead commentator for their coverage of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, telecast in Australia on 7mate. In 2013, he also called the New Zealand Warriors&#x27; games for Sky Sport in New Zealand. Voss has made the term &quot;let&#x27;s have some fun&quot; his own. He mainly uses the term at the start of most matches.

From 2018, Voss started a show called &quot;The Fan&quot; on Fox League, which runs on Tuesday nights.

<text>The Desert of Wales, or Green Desert of Wales, is an archaic term for an area in central Wales, so called for its lack of roads and towns, and its inaccessibility. The term was coined by English travel writers in the nineteenth century and has no equivalent in the Welsh language. The area corresponds roughly to the upland area called in Welsh.

The word &quot;desert&quot; is used figuratively, to describe the lack of biodiversity due to overgrazing of sheep and human clearing, which, over time, has destroyed the native temperate rainforest, and the lack of human settlement or infrastructure in the region. The area has high rainfall and much of it is covered by peat overlain with purple moor grass and heather moorland, or by plantations of non-native conifers. The soil tends to be acidic. There is no exact definition of the extent of the Desert of Wales, but it is bordered to the east by the A470 and the town of Rhayader, to the south by the A483 from Builth Wells to Llanwrda, to the west by the A482 from Llanwrda to Pumpsaint, and from there northwards by a series of country roads up to Tregaron. The northern boundary is generally taken to be the A44 between Ponterwyd and Llangurig, although the substantial area of moorland to the north of this road, including the reservoirs of Nant y Moch and Llyn Clywedog, has similar topography.

The term &#x27;Cambrian Desert&#x27; is also used to describe the region.

==History==
The term was first recorded in 1836 when the following was written by Joseph Downes: Affording us water and trees, and yielding a dim and remote picture, wrapped in purple sunset haze, of some fine country far far down, where a chasm of hills gave egress to the water, it appeared quite an oasis to us travellers of this Desert of Wales.

The English terminology has no Welsh equivalent, although the area roughly corresponds to the ancient commote of Elenydd. This Welsh name means the &quot;territory adjoining the river Elan&quot;, with the river name itself meaning fawn or hind. Travel is limited to narrow roads, forestry tracks, footpaths and bridleways. It is a sparsely populated area, consisting largely of rolling hills, gorges and steep valleys with ancient native Welsh oak forest.

===Ruins===
The ruins of Strata Florida Abbey are located on the road from Tregaron.

==Wildlife==
The area supported the last native red kites in the United Kingdom until their reintroduction and widespread revival in the 1980s.

==Water resources==
The area has many lakes and reservoirs, some of which supply drinking water to north Ceredigion from Teifi Pools, to the English West Midlands from Elan Valley group of reservoirs, and to populations along the River Severn valley with water stored in Llyn Clywedog and released into the river for later abstraction. 

===Drainage===
It is drained by the Afon Claerwen, Afon Teifi, Afon Cothi, Afon Tywi, Afon Irfon, Elan Valley, Afon Gwy, Afon Ystwyth, Afon Mynach, Afon Rheidol

<text>Godefroid Kurth (1847–1916) was a Belgian historian and pioneering Christian democrat. He is known for his histories of the city of Liège in the Middle Ages and of Belgium, his Catholic account of the formation of modern Europe in &quot;Les Origines de la civilisation moderne&quot;, and his defence of the medieval guild system.

==Life==
;Early life
Godefroid Kurth was born on 11 May 1847 in Arlon, the capital of the Belgian province of Luxembourg. His father, a former soldier from Cologne who was naturalized as a Belgian in 1842, became a police commissioner in Arlon but died in 1850. The family spoke Luxembourgish at home, and he learned French in primary school. He was educated at the Athénée royal d&#x27;Arlon and the Liège Normal school, where he completed his studies in 1869. That same year he was appointed French master at the Athénée royal de Liège.

;Academic career

In 1873, Kurth became the first person to be awarded the &quot;special doctorate in historical sciences&quot;, for a dissertation on Cato the Elder. The same year, he became chair of Medieval History and Belgian History at the University of Liège. One of his students, Henri Pirenne, became a noted historian. Léon-Ernest Halkin considered them the founders of the scientific method of history in Belgium. Kurth modeled his pedagogy on that instituted by the German historian Leopold von Ranke at the University of Berlin. On 7 May 1894 he was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium. He was a member of the committee that organized the Exposition de l&#x27;art ancien au Pays de Liège for the 1905 International exposition in Liège.

In 1906, Kurth was promoted to emeritus status and left the university to take up the position of director of the Belgian Historical Institute in Rome. In 1908, a Festschrift was published in his honor, &quot;Mélanges Godefriod Kurth&quot; (Université de Liège, 1908). Halkin said of him, &quot;Godefroid Kurth [was] the last of the romantic historians and the first of the &#x27;technical&#x27; historians in Belgium.&quot;

;Political and social thought
In Liège, Kurth encountered difficulties because of his strongly held Catholic views, which were considered ultramontane by his contemporaries. He was an active member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. In 1873, he was elected president of the &quot;Cercle catholique de l&#x27;Est&quot;, one of the predecessor bodies to the Catholic Party, which Kurth played a role in founding. He was also a pioneer of Christian democracy, helping organize the Social Congresses held in Liège in 1886, 1887, and 1890 that gave shape to Catholic social teaching. His study of the medieval guild system brought an increased appreciation for the principles of charity, brotherhood, and justice. Published in 1886, &quot;Les Origines de la civilisation moderne&quot; brought him an international reputation but was controversial in drawing a direct connection between the &quot;civilizing principle&quot; of Christianity and the development of modern civilization.

;Death
Kurth, who had strong links with the German Centre Party and with German colleagues, was repulsed by the German invasion of Belgium and the accompanying atrocities. Over the summer and autumn of 1915, he gathered testimony of the atrocities, including the killings at Aarschot, but was placed in detention by the Germans in an unheated location. He contracted pneumonia and died at Asse on 4 January 1916. He was provisionally buried in Asse, and later exhumed and reburied in Arlon at St Martin&#x27;s Church. There are streets named after him in both Arlon, Asse and Liège.

His work on the atrocities was published posthumously as &quot;Le Guet-apens prussien en Belgique&quot; (&quot;The Prussian Ambush in Belgium&quot;). Cardinal Désiré-Joseph Mercier wrote in the preface that Kurth, whose family origins were German, was &quot;overwhelmed by the invasion, its iniquity, its atrocities, its sham&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
* Prix quinquennal des Sciences historiques (1891)
* Commander in the Order of St Gregory the Great (1906)
* Commander in the Order of Leopold (1907)
* Honorary Doctorate of the Catholic University of Leuven (1912)

==Works==
Godefroid Kurth wrote over 500 books and journal articles, including contributions to the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;. His &quot;style is consciously literary, lively, and flamboyant. However, Kurth&#x27;s version of history is notably technical, founded on rigorous principles of historical criticism, extensive mastery of philology and profound knowledge of the sources and other works.&quot; His &quot;Clovis&quot; (1895), &quot;Notger de Liège&quot; (1905), and &quot;La cité de Liège au Moyen-âge&quot; (1909–1910) remain indispensable reference works.

<doc id="1281624" wikidata="Q1144657" url="?curid=1281624" title="Tōyō kanji">
<text>The are those kanji listed on the , which was released by the Japanese on 16 November 1946, following a reform of kanji characters of Chinese origin in the Japanese language. The intention of the list was to declare which kanji could be used in official government documents.

The 1,850-character list was not meant to be exhaustive, as many characters that were in common use at the time, and are today, were not included. It was meant as a baseline for satisfactory functional literacy in Japanese at a secondary education level, as all of the listed characters were to be taught nationwide in compulsory education.

They were replaced in 1981 by the kanji, which initially included 1,945 characters, but was expanded to 2,136 characters in 2010 following several revisions.

==Reform==

Thousands of kanji characters were in use in various writing systems, leading to great difficulties for those learning written Japanese. Additionally, several characters had identical meanings but were written differently from each other, further increasing complexity.

After World War II, the Ministry of Education decided to minimize the number of kanji by choosing the most commonly used kanji, along with simplified kanji (see ) commonly appearing in contemporary literature, to form the kanji. This was an integral part of the postwar reform of Japanese national writing.

This was meant as a preparation for re-introducing their previous unsuccessful reform abolishing Chinese characters. Although the postwar timing meant no public debate was held on the future of the Japanese written language, the defenders of the original kanji system considered and accepted the kanji as a reasonable compromise. Since this compromise could not then be withdrawn in favour of more radical reform, discussion of kanji abolition ended. Thirty-five years passed before further reforms were brought to the Japanese written form.

The table of the pronunciations of the kanji was published in 1948 and the exposition of altered character forms () in 1949.

In 1981, the Ministry of Education decided to replace the kanji with a more flexible system, leading to the publication of the kanji. This rendered the kanji obsolete.

==Applications and limitations==

In addition to a list of the standardized kanji, the reform published by the Ministry for Education in 1946 also contains a set of guidelines for their use.

Regarding provenance and scope, the foreword of the document states that:
* The table of kanji put forth therein, are the selection of kanji recommended for use by the general public, including legal and governmental documents, newspapers, and magazines.
* The presented kanji are selected as an approximate set of those characters found to be of no insignificant utility in the lives of today&#x27;s Japanese citizens.
* Concerning proper nouns, there is a wide range of usage beyond what may be formulated as rules, and consequently they are treated as outside the scope of this standard.
* The simplified character forms from modern custom are taken as the proper form, and their original forms are provided alongside them for reference.
* A systemization of the character forms and their readings is still under consideration (this referring to the later 1948 and 1949 publications that addressed these points in detail).

Regarding guidelines for use, it continues:
* If the kanji set forth in this standard do not suffice for the writing of a word, then either a different word should be substituted, or else the word shall be written in kana.
* Write pronouns, adverbs, conjunctions, interjections, auxiliary verbs, and particles using kana as much as possible (normally hiragana is used for these).
* Foreign placenames and people&#x27;s names are to be written in kana, except that traditional usage examples such as (beikoku, &quot;America&quot;) or (eikoku, &quot;England&quot;) are permitted.
* Words of foreign origin are to be written in kana (katakana is customarily used, but exceptions occur).
* Names of plants and animals should be written in kana (katakana is frequently but not ubiquitously used for these).
* (words like (tamago, &quot;egg&quot;) and (tabun, &quot;probably&quot;) that use the characters for their sounds, ignoring meaning) are to be written in kana. (This rule is not widely followed in practice.)
* As a general rule, furigana should not be used.
* Concerning technical and specialized terminology, it is hoped that the list of characters prescribed by the list of kanji will serve as a template for further standardization (acknowledging that the list may be insufficient for these applications, but should be used to guide more complete de facto standards).

(In the above, parenthetical remarks are used for exposition and do not reflect text that is present in the document.)

Because the majority of character-based words are composed of two (or more) kanji, many words were left with one character included in the kanji, and the other character missing. In this case, the recommendation was to write the included part in kanji and the excluded part in kana, e.g. for and for . These words were called .

<doc id="1281628" wikidata="Q5244553" url="?curid=1281628" title="De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde">
<text>The De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde (; ), also known as DLS-CSB or Benilde, is a private, Catholic secondary and tertiary education institution established by the De La Salle Brothers, located in the Malate district of Manila, Philippines. It operates four campuses, all of which are located within the vicinity of Malate, Manila. The college is a member institution of De La Salle Philippines (DLSP), a network of 16 Catholic Lasallian institutions. Benilde is also a member of a 350-year-old international network of over 1,200 Lasallian educational institutions globally established by the De La Salle Christian Brothers in 82 countries.

The college was established in 1980 during the administration of Br. Andrew Gonzalez, FSC as the College of Career Development, a night school for working students at De La Salle University-Manila. In 1988, it was renamed the De La Salle University–College of Saint Benilde after the Vatican&#x27;s Patron Saint of Vocations – Saint Bénilde Romançon, a Christian Brother who taught in France during the 19th century. In 1994, the college became autonomous. In 2004, along with a restated vision and mission, received its present name, dropping the &quot;University&quot; and becoming De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde.

The college uses &quot;learner-centered instruction&quot; to offer degree and non-degree programs in the arts, design, management, service industries, computer applications in business, and special fields of study. It is the first in the Philippines to offer degrees in AB Animation, AB Film, AB Production Design, AB Multimedia Arts, AB Fashion Design and Merchandising, BPA Dance and AB Photography.

The college&#x27;s sports teams, known as the Saint Benilde Blazers, compete in the National Collegiate Athletic Association with La Salle Green Hills representing the junior division. Since joining the league in 1998, the college has won five general championships, first in the 2005 season, back-to-back in the 2007 and 2008 seasons and another back-to-back win in 2013 and 2014 seasons.

==History==

===Early history (1980–1987)===
In 1980, De La Salle University-Manila opened an academic unit known as the College of Career Development, an evening school for working students. It was Saint Benilde Romancon, FSC who pioneered the development of evening classes for adult working students for continuing education hundreds of years ago. In 1984, the Preparatory Studies Department (PSD) was established to allow students to cope with the requirements of subsequent degree-oriented courses in regular undergraduate colleges. In 1985, the college was renamed the Community College. In May 1987, the PSD was phased out and replaced by the Arts and Business Studies Area (ABSA). The ABSA offered two courses: a Bachelor of Arts degree in management with emphasis on human resources management and a Bachelor of Science degree in business administration, major in computer applications.

===Under De La Salle University (1988–1994)===
The Community College was officially renamed De La Salle University–College of Saint Benilde in 1988, after the establishment of the De La Salle University System. Saint Bénilde Romançon was selected as the namesake to symbolize its objective of providing innovative education for the verbally but not numerically gifted, late bloomers, disabled, as well as artists. Bénilde made room for his students in Clermont-Ferrand, regardless of their age or their mental capabilities. He also learned sign language to instruct a deaf-mute boy for his first Holy Communion.

The ABSA was renamed as the Arts and Business Studies Department (ABSD) and became the day program of the college, while the Career Development Department (CDD) remained as the college&#x27;s evening program. Because of the need for more space, the college moved to its own campus at 2544 Taft Avenue in 1989. A third major program, a Bachelor of Arts degree in Interdisciplinary Studies, was offered, undertaken in consortium with the College of Liberal Arts. In 1991, the college offered certificate programs in Accounting and Bookkeeping for the deaf, and a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Design.

===As an autonomous college (1994–2005)===

Benilde became an autonomous member of the De La Salle University System in April 1994. It ratified its proposed Constitution and By-Laws and identified Benildean core values in November 1994. The Night College, a scholarship program, was transferred from De La Salle University-Manila to the college in 1995. In the same year, the School of Design and Arts (SDA) was established, and the following degrees were offered: Bachelor of Arts in Animation, Bachelor of Arts in Film, Bachelor of Arts in Photography, Bachelor of Arts in Music Production, Bachelor of Arts in Theater Arts, Bachelor of Arts in Production Design, Bachelor of Arts major in Fashion Design and Merchandising, Bachelor of Performing Arts major in Dance, Bachelor of Science in Industrial Design, Bachelor of Science in Interior Design.

In 1996, the School of Hotel, Restaurant, and Institution Management was formed, and groundbreaking ceremonies for the Angelo King International Center building were held. The following degrees were first offered in the same year: Bachelor of Science in Business Administration, Major in Export Management; Bachelor of Science in Hotel, Restaurant, and Institution Management; Bachelor of Arts major in Fashion Design and Merchandising; Bachelor of Arts major in Consular and Diplomatic Affairs, and the Bachelor of Arts in Applied Deaf Studies. The college also established the Certificate Program Center (CPC) which offered short courses, and the Grants-in-Aid Program to provide financial assistance to students in need.

In 1997, the administration of the vocational programs of the Night College of the De La Salle University was passed on to the college in June and was renamed as the Blessed Arnould Study Assistance Program in September. In October 1997, the college held its first graduation rites independent from De La Salle University. In the same year, the college established the School of Special Studies for deaf students. In March 1998, the NCAA accepted the college&#x27;s application for membership to the sports league along with La Salle Green Hills athletes as its high school representatives. In 1999, the School of Design and Arts offered the Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Arts degree, the first of its kind in the country. Later that year, the construction of the Angelo King International Center was completed, which then housed the School of Hotel, Restaurant, and Institution Management.

In 2000, the college won its first Men&#x27;s Basketball Championship title in the NCAA, marking the fastest win of any new school in the league since World War II. The college offered a BSBA degree in Information Management and a Bachelor of Arts in Music Production degree, a first of its kind. In the same year, the college held bidding for the architect of the proposed School of Design and Arts building. In 2001, the School of Special Studies was renamed as the School of Deaf Education and Applied Studies (SDEAS). A year later, the SDEAS was invited to become a member of the Post-Secondary Education Network-International.

In 2004, the non-university members of the DLSU System — Canlubang, and Medical and Health Sciences Campus — removed the term &quot;University&quot; from their names. The college then restated its mission and vision and was renamed De La Salle–College of Saint Benilde. Construction for the 14-storey School of Design and Arts campus was started in this year. The Certificate Program Center was expanded and renamed into the School of Professional and Continuing Education. In 2005, the college became overall champions for the first time in NCAA Season 81.

===Recent history (2006–present)===
In 2006, the college became a district school of De La Salle Philippines, the successor of the DLSU System. Br. Edmundo Fernandez FSC, Brother Visitor of the De La Salle Brothers Philippine District, became the college&#x27;s interim president. The college became the host for the NCAA Season 82, and landed in second place for the General Championship rankings.

In 2007, the School of Design and Arts opened four new degree programs: the Bachelor of Arts degrees in Animation, Digital Filmmaking, and Photography, the first of their kind in the country, and Architecture That same year, the new 14-storey School of Design and Arts Campus opened in May in time for the start of the school year 2007–2008. The college inaugurated its first Brother President, Br. Victor Franco FSC in September.

In 2008, the School of Management and Information Technology (SMIT), in partnership with the School of Design and Arts, announced its intention to offer a new degree in game design and development, pending approval of the Commission on Higher Education. At the end of NCAA Season 83, the college again became the overall champions, winning their second title after two years.

On August 12, 2008, East Timor President, José Ramos-Horta visited the college and gave a talk entitled &quot;United in Faith, Partners in Nation-Building&quot; held at the School of Design and Arts Campus during a four-day state visit to the Philippines, which marked the first time that a foreign head of state visited the college.

In 2009, the college opened three new degree programs, the Bachelor of Science in International Hospitality Management for SHRIM, which partnered with Vatel International Hospitality School in France, the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, Major in Game Design and Development for SMIT, the first IT program anchored in game design and development in the Philippines, and Bachelor of Science in Architecture for the SDA. The college won its third championship title in the NCAA, and became back-to-back general champions for NCAA Season 84.

Groundbreaking of a new building commenced in 2017. The building would serve as a sports center for the Benilde Blazers and a dormitory for scholars. It was inaugurated as the Benilde Sports and Dorm Building and opened in 2020. A five-story building, the complex stands on a lot in San Isidro Drive corner Dominga Street with the Taft and SDA Campuses as neighbors.

In 2022, SDA had been divided into three new autonomous clusters housed under the newly renamed Design and Arts (D+A) Campus: the School of New Media Arts (SNMA), the School of Culture, Arts, and Performance (SACP), and the School of Environmental Design (SED). The decision was made in light of further strengthening creative industry systems and qualifications within the college.

==Campuses==
The college has four campuses: the Taft Campus, the Angelo King International Center, the School of Design and Arts, and the Atrium, all in Malate, Manila. The Taft Campus is a block from De La Salle University beside St. Scholastica&#x27;s College and the LRT-1 Vito Cruz Station. The college is surrounded by dormitories, condominiums, and restaurants. To travel between campuses, students may either walk or ride cycle rickshaws stationed near the campuses or the electric jeepney shuttle service provided by the college.

Other properties include the Blessed Hilario Hall on Dominga Street which functions as the college&#x27;s retreat house. Beside it is the Blessed Scubilion Hall, a residence for student-athletes. The Solomon Guest House on C. Ayala Street is a restaurant and meeting area used as a hands-on workplace for selected SHRIM students where they handle the operation of the establishment.

In 2018, Benilde Antipolo opened its new building in the Antipolo city proper. The campus is the new home of the tertiary programs from La Salle College Antipolo. The school offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Marketing Management, Accountancy, Hospitality Management, Tourism Management, Psychology, Communication Arts, and Education.

===Taft Campus===
The Taft Campus stands on a 6,380-square-meter lot that stretches from Taft Avenue to the next parallel street, Leon Guinto. The land was acquired from LBP Leasing Corporation, a subsidiary of the Land Bank of the Philippines. The campus is a square lot made up of four interconnected buildings: St. Benilde Hall, Duerr Hall, Blessed Solomon Hall, and St. Mutien Marie Hall. The Duerr Hall has a different alignment from the rest of the buildings, requiring the need for stairs and a ramp on its intersections with the Blessed Solomon Hall.

The Plaza Villarosa, named after architect Rogelio Villarosa, is on this campus&#x27; second level. It is decorated by lush plants and palm trees and has a basketball court, an elevated platform, and several cabañas with stone benches. The plaza is used as a study area and venue for events and activities such as those of student organizations. Bazaars and food establishments also temporarily set up stalls in the plaza during such events. The statue of Saint Benilde, originally located on the campus&#x27;s old front gate, was moved to the plaza after its completion. Behind the statue is an 18-bell carillon, built as a memorial to the Lasallian Christian Brothers who were massacred and murdered at the De La Salle College Taft campus during World War II by 20 plus Japanese soldiers. The names of the brothers are inscribed on the bells of the carillon. The carillon and the statue, when taken together, stand as the visual representation of the college.

====St. Benilde Hall====
The first building of the college, named after Saint Bénilde Romançon, was opened on August 11, 1989. It is located at the back of the campus and was designed by Gines Rivera. The building has four levels, holding numerous lecture rooms and computer laboratories, a cafeteria, a clinic, and the office of the Information Technology Center. It also houses the offices of the School of Deaf Education and Applied Studies and the School of Management and Information Technology, as well as the Student Grants Unit and the Center for Counseling Services.

====Duerr Hall====
Br. Crescentius Richard Duerr FSC, president of De La Salle University from 1961 to 1966, was a visionary teacher and administrator of La Salle schools in Manila, Bacolod and Iligan City, doing missionary work for 31 years before returning to New York. He was instrumental in the transformation of De La Salle University-Manila becoming a pillar of Philippine education.

The second building of the campus, originally called &quot;South Wing&quot; because of its location at the southern side of the campus, was blessed on August 10, 1992, and cost 30 million pesos. It houses the Accounting Office, Faculty and Administrative offices of the School of Multidisciplinary Studies, several offices of the programs of the School of Management and Information Technology, and laboratories of the School of Deaf Education and Applied Studies. It has several classrooms and computer laboratories, and an auditorium. It also has a badminton court located on the fifth floor. The on-campus bookstore is located on the first level of the hall near the Career and Placement Office. The Duerr Hall formerly held the Multimedia and Fashion Design laboratories of the School of Design and Arts, prior to the completion of the SDA campus.

The Chapel of the Resurrection is located on the second-floor intersection of Duerr and Solomon Hall. It features glass doors, a stenciled drawing of the praying hands, a sacristy, a confessional room, and an altar showing Napoleon Abueva&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Resurrection.&quot;

====St. Mutien Marie Hall====

Saint Mutien Marie Wiaux was a devoutly religious Brother who made a tremendous influence on the students under his charge through his patience and piety. He taught in Malonne for 58 years, teaching music and arts alongside Catholic dogma. He was canonized in 1989.

Construction of the third and fourth wings of the campus was approved by the Board of Trustees on January 6, 1993. Groundbreaking ceremonies were made in March 1994, while actual construction began on April 16 of the same year. The Mutien Marie Hall and the Blessed Solomon Hall were blessed at October 29, 1996. Both buildings were designed by Rogelio Villarosa and construction cost 120 million pesos.

The General Administrative Services Office occupies the first floor while the Br. Fidelis Leddy Learning Resource Center occupies the whole second level of the building. The third floor up to the fifth consists of lecture rooms. There is also a case room for thesis defense located on the third floor. The gymnasium is located on the topmost level of the building. Most of the classrooms in this building are equipped with LCD and OHP projectors, television sets with VHS players, and computers. The Mutien-Marie Hall formerly held the drafting rooms, Industrial Design laboratory, and the head office of the School of Design and Arts.

====Blessed Solomon Hall====

Blessed Solomon Leclerq was martyred in 1792 after refusing to swear an oath that forced the French clergy of the time to support the state. Before that, he was a teacher, director, and bursar, and was known for his love for people and for his work. He was beatified in 1926, the first Lasallian brother to be given that honor.

The main entrance of the campus is located at the first level of the Blessed Solomon Hall facing Taft Avenue. The Admissions Office and the Office of Student Behavior can be found on the ground floor, and near the vehicle, entrance is the waiting lounge, popularly known as &quot;The Airport&quot; because the fixed seats resemble an airport departure lounge. The Office of the Registrar, as well as other Executive offices, is housed on the second level of the building while the Office of Student Affairs, Office of Culture and Arts, Social Action Office, Sports Development Office, Student Publications Office, and the Student Involvement Office are all located on the third level. On the fourth level is the Center for Learning and Performance Assessment, and a dance room and multipurpose room for Physical education classes. On the top level of Solomon Hall is the Augusto-Rosario Gonzalez Theater, named after the parents of the late Br. Andrew Gonzalez FSC.

===Angelo King International Center===

The Angelo King International Center (AKIC or the CSB Hotel-International Conference Center) is a fully operational four-star hotel on a 2,100-square-meter lot at the corner of Estrada Street and Arellano Avenue, two blocks from the main campus. It was envisioned to be the first operational hotel school in the Philippines where students will be able to experience learning in a real-world environment. Groundbreaking rites for the building were held in 1996 but actual construction began in 1998 and was finished a year after. It was formally opened in August and named after De La Salle alumnus – Dr. Angelo King, who gave financial assistance to the construction of the building.

Sharing the space at the building is the Hotel Benilde, which has 46 guest rooms and two dormitory-type rooms, a conference hall, a fine dining rooftop restaurant and lobby lounge, a cafeteria, a library, transport services office, parking space for 126 vehicles, and two guest elevators. The first, second, eleventh, and twelfth floors are used by the CSB Hotel, and the third to fifth floors are for interior parking while the SHRIM occupies the fifth to ninth floors.

The School of Hotel, Restaurant, and Institution Management occupy four floors with 14 classrooms, a tiered demonstration kitchen, demonstration bar, institutional hot, cold, and baking/pastry kitchens with adequate cold and dry storage areas, two basic food laboratories, two computer laboratories, a nutrition laboratory, conference rooms, a clinic, and a chapel. The School of HRIM is served by two passenger elevators and one service elevator. Occupying the roof deck is Vatel Restaurant Manila, a fine dining restaurant operated by selected SHRIM students.

Near the AKIC building is the Solomon Guest House, which is operated by selected SHRIM students, who are involved in marketing meal preparation and service. The SGH also has three rooms and a suite that could be used as venues for private meetings and gatherings.

===Design and Arts Campus – D+A Campus===

The Design and Arts Campus (D+A Campus), formerly the School of Design and Arts (SDA) Campus, is a 14-story academic complex with of usable floor space designed by Lor Calma Design and Associates, with Eduardo Calma as the design principal. It was built on a 4,560 m2 lot that was formerly used as parking space for the college, located at 950 Pablo Ocampo Street, and about 500 meters away from the Taft Campus. It was originally planned to open in January 2006, but due to construction delays, the opening was moved to May 2007. It is the third, largest, and most advanced campus of the college which houses its largest and busiest school, the School of Design and Arts. While the exact budget for the building is classified, an estimated amount of 1.2 billion pesos was said to be allotted for the whole building project.

The building was dubbed by then De La Salle University System president, Br. Armin Luistro FSC as the &quot;jewel in the crown of the De La Salle University System schools,&quot; as well as one of De La Salle&#x27;s most ambitious projects. The building features an architectural design never before used, with a sophisticated façade and all-glass backside and designed in a way that only the floor from the tenth are visible. Calma relates that the building will feature louvers which, when illuminated at night, will appear like lanterns, and considering the location, the lighting effects would set the building apart from its surroundings.

The opening date of the building was moved to September 2006 when the January 2006 opening could not be achieved, but due to construction delays again, a September opening was not possible and the administration opted for a May 2007 opening instead. The building was delayed due to the intricacy of the architectural design, implementation of the complicated plans, and other problems encountered with the Project Manager and the Contractor. The architectural plans presented design issues that made them difficult to implement at a steady rate. The construction management encountered conflicts in approach and principles with the onsite technical team. Construction, however, gained a steady pace after October 2006 and the building was completed and inaugurated in April 2007.

The building has four floors of above-level parking space and ten floors of workspace served by two service and five-passenger elevators and five sets of stairs. It features a Building Management System with intelligent controls for air conditioning; smoke detection and fire alarms; CCTV surveillance security systems; and has its own sewage management plant. The building is also fully Wi-Fi enabled and the first building in the Philippines to be equipped with 10 Gigabit Ethernet. Among its notable facilities is a three-story, 558-seat theater which is cantilevered four stories above the ground and the Museum of Contemporary Art and Design, a contemporary art museum which was envisioned to be the first of its kind in the Philippines. Inside, its corridors can double as exhibition spaces. Every classroom is air-conditioned and configured for better acoustics. The building also has a cafeteria, a chapel, and a two-floor library in addition to the lecture, computer, and seminar rooms. There are also video, animation, and sound production laboratories as well as a photography studio and a greenscreen TV and film production studio with motion capture equipment, and a 105-seat cinema.

===Atrium===
The Atrium is the newest building of the college. A 10-storey building, it was designed by architect Daniel Lichauco, the principal and managing partner of Archion Architects. It was constructed by D.M. Consunji Inc., a pioneer of advanced engineering technology. The new campus will house The School of Diplomacy and Governance, the School of Management and Information Technology, and the School of Professional and Continuing Education. Features of the building include an open-air cafeteria located at the topmost floor, and escalators every two floors that are designed to lessen the load of the elevators. The building also houses the Learning Resource Center dedicated to the students of the Benilde Deaf School as well as various departments, offices, conference rooms, initiative learning studios, and classrooms.

==Academics==

The college uses Howard Gardner&#x27;s theory of multiple intelligences, where each person is said to possess varying levels of different intelligence which determine his or her cognitive profile. The theory is implemented through learner-centered instruction where classes are taught according to the student&#x27;s understanding of the subject and recognizes the uniqueness of each learner. Learner-centered also refers to a learning environment that pays attention to the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs that learners bring to the educational setting.

The college has eight schools that offer degree and non-degree programs designed for the development of professionals in the arts, design, management, service industries, computer applications in business, and special fields of study.

===School of Deaf Education and Applied Studies===
The School of Deaf Education and Applied Studies (SDEAS) was first established in 1991 as a vocational program offering courses in accounting and bookkeeping for the Deaf. The vocational program became the School of Special Studies with the addition of the Bachelor in Applied Deaf Studies (BAPDST) degree five years later. The school was restructured and renamed the School of Deaf Education and Applied Studies in 2000. The BAPDST course was refined and began offering specialization tracks in Multimedia Arts and Business Entrepreneurship. The SDEAS is one of only six institutions in the Philippines that offer postsecondary education to the deaf.

In 2001, the SDEAS partnered with the Postsecondary Education Network-International, a global partnership of colleges and universities funded by the Nippon Foundation of Japan that aims to provide deaf students the appropriate postsecondary education for them to achieve their full potentials. Two learning centers were established since the partnership: The PEN-Multimedia Learning Center (2003) and the PEN-Learning Center (2006), both at Duerr Hall.

===School of New Media Arts===

In June 2002, Team St. Benilde under the Multimedia Arts program of the School of Design and Arts, has first taken the championship in the First Philippine Animation Competition with their entry, &quot;Fiesta Karera&quot;, a fully 3D animated short of a futuristic rendition of carabao races usually held in festivals in the Philippines.

In 2022, following the new clusters split off from the School of Design and Arts (SDA), which was established in 1995, the School of New Media Arts (SNMA) consists of four Bachelor of Arts degrees in Animation (ABANI), Film (ABFILM), Multimedia Arts (ABMMA), and Photography (ABPHOTO).

===School of Culture, Arts, and Performance===

The School of Culture, Arts, and Performance (SACP) consists four Bachelor of Arts degree programs namely, Creative Industries Management (ABCIM), Music Production (ABMP), Production Design (AB-PRD), and Theater Arts (ABTHA); a Bachelor of Performing Arts degree program: Major in Dance (BPA-D), and a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree program: Major in Culture-Based Arts (BFA CBA).

===School of Environmental Design===

The School of Environmental Design houses three Bachelor of Science degree programs namely Architecture (BS-ARCH), Industrial Design (IND), and Interior Design (ID); a Bachelor of Arts degree program in Fashion Design and Merchandising (AB-FDM); and a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in Textile Design (BTD).

===School of Hotel, Restaurant and Institution Management===
The School of Hotel, Restaurant and Institution Management (SHRIM) was established in 1996 and aims to provide the hotel and restaurant industry with graduates who possess the requisite knowledge, skills, knowledge, and values to become successful entrepreneurs and to train students to become &quot;industry-ready&quot; for hotel and restaurants in the country and abroad. It offers the Bachelor of Science degree in Hotel, Restaurant and Institution Management (BS-HRIM), which integrates theory and practice to provide students with a strong management and service orientation as well as a global perspective of hotel and restaurant operations. It has three tracks, the Culinary Arts track, Hospitality Management track, and Tourism Management track.

The school is housed at the Angelo King International Center, a four-star hotel school at the corner of Arellano Avenue and Estrada Street. Students are given their first on-the-job training at the Hotel Benilde regardless of their tracks. Students are deployed at either of its subsidiaries: the Solomon Guest House, a restaurant and lodge fully student-managed and operated, and the Chefs&#x27; Station, a food stall at the cafeterias of the college.

In 2009, the SHRIM partnered with the Vatel International Hospitality School in Paris. With this educational cooperation, the school is concurrently known as Vatel Manila and is included in the Vatel international network. Under the Vatel partnership, the school offers the Bachelor of Science in International Hospitality Management (BS-IHM).

===School of Management and Information Technology===
The School of Management and Information Technology (SMIT) offers degrees based on emerging profitable disciplines. It offers Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) degrees majoring in Computer Applications (BSBA-CA), Export Management (BSBA-EM), Human Resource Management (BSBA-HRM) and Bachelor of Science degrees in Information Systems (BS-IS), Real Estate Management (BS-REM) and Interactive Entertainment and Multimedia Computing majoring in Game Development and Game Art (BSIEMC). The SMIT continues the college&#x27;s Career Development Program by offering BSBA degrees in Business Management (BSBA-BM) and Marketing Management (BSBA-MM) as night programs for working students.

In 2005, the SMIT, along with the SHRIM, was given accreditation by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities. In 2009, the SMIT partnered with the Singapore-based online graduate school Universitas 21 Global. Part of the agreement includes an elective in Electronic Business for the Computer Applications and Information Systems programs. Students enrolled in the elective will have access to Universitas 21 Global&#x27;s resources, and will be trained by its staff.

===School of Diplomacy and Governance===
The School of Diplomacy and Governance (SDG) handles the general education curriculum of all programs offered by the college. It provides the students a strong foundation in the languages, social and natural sciences, theology, and philosophy. Until 2020, it offered the Bachelor of Arts in Consular and Diplomatic Affairs (CDA) degree to develop practitioners in international relations. In January 2020, SDG Dean Gary Ador Dionisio announced that the CDA degree would be replaced with the Bachelor of Arts in Diplomacy and International Affairs (AB-DIA) degree, while a new program entitled the Bachelor of Arts in Governance and Public Affairs (AB-GPA) would be offered, starting August that year.

The Consular and Diplomatic Affairs program has networked with various government (e.g. Department of Foreign Affairs, international and Philippine embassies and consulates abroad) and non-government organizations to provide the relevant exposure to students as well as to provide job opportunities to graduates.

Consular and Diplomatic Affairs program has entered into agreements with non-profit institutions like Alliance Française de Manille and Instituto Cervantes de Manila to provide the needed foreign language learning and cultural exposures to students.

Most of the professors in the CDA program were former diplomats, namely Rosario Manalo (former Philippine ambassador to Belgium, Sweden, France, and Special Envoy of the Philippines to the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights), Minerva Jean Falcon (former Philippine Consul General to Toronto, former Philippine Ambassador to Turkey, Switzerland, and Germany), Antonio Rodriguez (former DFA Undersecretary, former Philippine Ambassador to Thailand), Franklin Ebdalin (former DFA Undersecretary and Philippine ambassador to Hungary), José del Rosario Jr. (former Philippine ambassador to India and Jordan), Monina Estrella Callangan-Rueca (former Philippine ambassador to Hungary), Luz Palacios (former DFA Assistant Secretary for European Affairs), and Marilyn Alarilla (former Philippine ambassador to Laos and Turkey).

Linkages were also created with different international institutions handling the Model United Nations Assembly (MUNA) abroad (e.g. MUNA USA, China, Switzerland, Germany, Hong Kong, Czech Republic, France, and Canada). Through this, students are able to attend the MUNA as official delegates representing assigned countries.

===School of Professional and Continuing Education===
The School of Professional and Continuing Education (SPaCE) provides post-baccalaureate diploma programs for graduates seeking continuing education in various business-related fields. Formerly held by the SMIT, the SPaCE now handles the Career Development Program (CDP) which offers BSBA degrees in Business Management and Marketing Management. The Career Development Program gives adult students the opportunity to gain a degree program while at work through a streamlined program and format which caters to their busy lifestyle.

==Athletics==

Freshmen students are oriented by upperclassmen about the school&#x27;s policies, the facilities of the campus as well as what to expect during their stay in the college. In September, the Student Involvement Unit organizes the SI week (Student Involvement week), when the student organizations can recruit new members from the freshmen. The College Week is held during August, where the feast day of Saint Benilde is celebrated through various activities and several masses. Every Friday, a vacant period given from 11 a.m to 2:30 p.m., known as C-Break (College Break), can be used by organizations to hold seminars and workshops, training period for the performing groups, or to hold special events and activities. The Plaza Villarosa is usually used for activities, where the basketball court can be used for training sessions or sports activities, the performing stage for concerts, and the cabañas for bazaars.

<text>Hill is a small lunar impact crater that is located to the west of the prominent crater Macrobius, near the eastern edge of the Sinus Amoris. Its diameter is 16 km. It was named after American astronomer George William Hill. It was previously designated Macrobius B. It lies just to the north-northeast of Carmichael, another renamed satellite crater of Macrobius.

This is a circular, bowl-shaped crater with an inner wall that has a relatively high albedo compared to the surrounding terrain. The inner walls are symmetrical in form, and slope gently down to the small floor at the midpoint, a surface about one-fourth the diameter of the crater. This formation is not significantly eroded, and is otherwise indistinguishable from many similar craters on the Moon.

<text>The Rais massacre, of August 28, 1997, was one of Algeria&#x27;s bloodiest massacres of the 1990s. It took place at the village of Rais, near Sidi Moussa and south of Algiers. The initial official death toll was 98 people killed and 120 wounded; CNN said that hospital workers and witnesses gave a toll of at least 200, and up to 400. The figure given by the Algerian government to the UN Commission on Human Rights was 238. The BBC later quoted the figure of 800 killed.

In 1997, Algeria was at the peak of a brutal civil conflict that had begun after the military&#x27;s cancellation of 1992 elections set to be won by the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). The poor farming village of Rais had mostly voted for FIS and had a history of supporting Islamist guerrillas in the region, but (according to a villager quoted by PBS) had recently stopped providing them with food and money.

== Massacre ==
The hooded attackers arrived about 1 am in trucks and cars, armed with shotguns, knives, axes, and bombs. They continued killing the village&#x27;s men, women, children, and even animals until dawn (about 6 am), cutting throats and taking the time to burn corpses; young women, however, were abducted instead of being killed. In some cases, they left severed heads on doorsteps. They mutilated and stole from the dead, and committed atrocities against pregnant women. They burned and bombed some houses. The villagers tried to flee or hide. Army units stayed outside the village, shooting at fleeing villagers, but not attempting to enter the village until after the attackers, carrying away some 20 young women, left at dawn.

Responsibility was claimed for this, as for the Bentalha massacre, by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA). In &quot;An Inquiry into the Algerian Massacres&quot; (a book arguing that the GIA had become a tool of the state) two survivors are quoted as reporting that the killers were dressed like &quot;Afghans&quot;, with turbans, covered faces, beards (some false), and uniforms, that the attackers were also cursing God throughout, and that among them were a few women, wearing hijab over a uniform. These accounts (which can be read below) appear not to be corroborated by major media outlets.

The government vowed to &quot;continue to struggle without mercy against the barbarous criminals until their eradication&quot;, announcing a massive manhunt and new measures to reinforce rural security. Amnesty International expressed concern regarding the government response, noting that &quot;the massacre site is surrounded by army barracks and security forces posts, located between a few hundreds metres and a few kilometers away&quot;, including an army barracks 100 metres away, and quoting a survivor as saying &quot;The army and the security forces were right there; they heard and saw everything and did nothing, and they let the terrorists leave.&quot; AI interviewed another survivor and they mentioned how &quot; in addition to the security forces barracks nearby, security forces’ units were also stationed just outside the village, and were aware that the massacre was being committed because those who were able to flee at the
beginning of the attack had gone to seek help and refuge with the nearby security forces.&quot; The Prime Minister, Ahmed Ouyahia, retorted to ITN that &quot;the army, the national guard intervened, intervened as quickly as it was possible.&quot; The authorities cited concern regarding the possible presence of mines and ambushes; however, a rescue worker interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that the first gendarmes there had not taken any precautions against possible mines as they drove in.

The Algerian government told the UN Commission on Human Rights (E/CN.4/2000/3/Add.1 ) that &quot;A judicial inquiry was opened by the Larbâa court and the four perpetrators of the massacre identified. Search warrants were issued by the examining magistrate on 30 May 1998.&quot; How four attackers killed 238 people is not made clear.

The village&#x27;s population had already dropped from 1000 before the conflict began to 200 after the massacre; many of the remainder left following this massacre. Some of those who remained were given arms by the government for future self-defense, according to &quot;La Tribune&quot;, which quotes residents opposing Abdelaziz Bouteflika&#x27;s amnesty to certain members of the armed groups (the Law of National Reconciliation), fearing that it would include murderers like those who killed their neighbors.

==Eyewitness quotes==
A few recounts of the massacre allow us to step into the shoes of the victims and hear the events that unfolded on August 28, 1997.

Mrs. Bachiri, a victim of the Rais massacre, testified on the deaths of her sixteen brothers and their children before members of the Algerian League for the Defence of Human Rights (LADDH):

&quot;They slaughtered him along with his seven children. They slit their throats. He is blind the
poor guy… a blind man… what could he have done to deserve this? He is married to a lady who is
not totally fit mentally. She gave him two sons and two daughters. The sons were dragged outside
with their father and had their throats slit, whereas the daughters were taken away. One was twentyeight years old, the other was twenty-four. &#x27;why would they want to kill me? What did I do? They told him: &#x27;come out, we want a word with you&#x27;. When he came out they were there… with military uniforms and toting their guns. There were a few women with them. The women were wearing the hijab over a military uniform.

One of the soldiers cut the finger of one of Amara’s daughters and said to his colleague: &#x27;take the
gold, take the gold&#x27;. Amara’s 2-year-old granddaughter was found burnt in the oven. His old daughter
[the guest], was slaughtered too… she was lying on the ground… they put one of her sons on her
right arm, another son on the left arm and they shouted &#x27;Allah Akfar&#x27;… We say: Allah Akbar [Allah
is the Greatest]&#x27; but they were saying &#x27;Allah Akfar&#x27; [Allah is the worst of the unbelievers]. They came
in cars, in Landrovers… People who stayed at home were slaughtered, and those who went out were
shot dead.&quot;

Quote from an unnamed survivor of the Rais massacre to Amnesty International:

“Why did this happen? Why didn’t anyone stop it? There is no law any more.
The army and the security forces were right there; they heard and saw everything
and did nothing, and they let the terrorists leave... They [the army] waited for the
terrorists to finish their dirty task and then they let them leave. What does this
mean to you? ... I had been threatened by the fundamentalists but I almost got
killed by the army. Even my friends in the army don’t understand anything
anymore these days...”.

<text>Ways of Seeing is a 1972 television series of 30-minute films created chiefly by writer John Berger and producer Mike Dibb. It was broadcast on BBC Two in January 1972 and adapted into a book of the same name.

The series was intended as a response to Kenneth Clark&#x27;s &quot;Civilisation&quot; TV series, which represents a more traditionalist view of the Western artistic and cultural canon, and the series and book criticise traditional Western cultural aesthetics by raising questions about hidden ideologies in visual images. According to James Bridle, Berger &quot;didn&#x27;t just help us gain a new perspective on viewing art with his 1972 series &quot;Ways of Seeing&quot; – he also revealed much about the world in which we live. Whether exploring the history of the female nude or the status of oil paint, his landmark series showed how art revealed the social and political systems in which it was made. He also examined what had changed in our ways of seeing in the time between when the art was made and today.&quot;

The series has had a lasting influence, and in particular introduced the concept of the male gaze, as part of Berger&#x27;s analysis of the treatment of the nude in European painting. It soon became popular among feminists, including the British film critic Laura Mulvey, who used it to critique traditional media representations of the female character in cinema.

==Episodes==

==Book==
The book &quot;Ways of Seeing&quot; was written by Berger and Dibb, along with Sven Blomberg, Chris Fox, and Richard Hollis. The book consists of seven numbered essays: four using words and images; and three essays using only images. 

Now described as &quot;revolutionary&quot;, the book has contributed to feminist readings of popular culture, through essays that focus particularly on how women are portrayed in advertisements and oil paintings. &quot;Berger ... has had a profound influence on the popular understanding of art and the visual image,&quot; according to sociologists Yasmin Gunaratnam and Vikki Bell.

== Reception and legacy ==
The book and television series were considered groundbreaking. A 1994 critic noted:

<text>The Llanberis Lake Railway () is a narrow gauge heritage railway that runs for along the northern shore of Llyn Padarn in north Wales in the Snowdonia National Park. The starting point is the village of Llanberis at the eastern end of the lake (), with the western terminus at Pen Llyn in the Padarn Country Park (). The return journey takes around 60 minutes.
The railway is one of the Great Little Trains of Wales. 
== History ==

=== Early proposals ===

The Llanberis Lake Railway runs along part of the trackbed of the defunct Padarn Railway, a gauge line which connected the quarry with Y Felinheli (Port Dinorwic) on the Menai Strait. The Padarn Railway closed in October 1961 and was lifted between 16 May 1962 and February 1963. Following the closure of the Padarn Railway, various plans were made to open a gauge tourist railway on the trackbed. The first serious attempt was made by G. Ward, a local resident, who proposed a railway that would circle Llyn Padarn using the trackbeds of the British Rail Llanberis branch and the Padarn Railway. This plan would have utilized track and locomotives from the Dinorwic slate quarry, but the company did not pursue the proposal.

=== Quarry closure and formation of the railway company ===

In July 1966, A. Lowry Porter of Southend-on-Sea proposed a shorter railway running from the quarry company&#x27;s workshops at Gilfach Ddu near Llanberis to Penllyn, along the easternmost three miles of Padarn Railway trackbed. Negotiations were progressing with the company, when in July 1969 the quarry closed at short notice. The quarry&#x27;s workshops at Gilfach Ddu were purchased by the Gwynedd County Council with the intention of creating a Country Park.

The quarry&#x27;s land and equipment were put up for auction, and Lowry Porter&#x27;s fledgling railway company purchased three steam locomotives and one diesel locomotive for use on the planned lake railway. In June 1970 the County Council purchased the trackbed of the Padarn Railway and agreed to allow its use for the lake railway.

The Ruston diesel locomotive was quickly put into service laying track. Meanwhile, the first steam locomotive, &quot;Dolbadarn&quot;, was restored to working order. The new railway was built to narrow gauge instead of the more unusual narrow gauge used in the quarries. This required all the rolling stock to be regauged, including the locomotives. Tracklaying progressed during 1970 using track recovered from several sources, including some originally used on the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway.

New carriages were built using the chassis of bogie wagons. These initial efforts at creating passenger stock proved unsatisfactory – they had a tendency to derail due to their very rigid construction. This caused a delay in opening, and a subsequent rapid redesign of the carriages.

=== Early years ===

The railway officially opened on 28 May 1971 but because of the need to redesign the carriage stock, the first public trains did not run until 19 July 1971. By the end of the first season, more than 30,000 passengers had been carried. In the winter of 1971 the railway was extended to its current terminus at Penllyn. For the beginning of the 1972 season, a second steam locomotive &quot;Red Damsel&quot; was returned to service with a new name: &quot;Elidir&quot;. The locomotive roster was expanded that year to include &quot;Maid Marian&quot; (now operating on the Bala Lake Railway) and an 0-4-0 tank locomotive built by Jung in Germany.

=== Llanberis extension ===

In June 2003 the railway was extended to the town of Llanberis, with a new station close to the start of the Snowdon Mountain Railway. The original terminus at Gilfach Ddu is now a through station serving both the National Slate Museum and the nearby Dolbadarn Castle. On the return journey from Pen Llyn, passengers may alight at Cei Llydan station, where a picnic site is available with views of the Snowdonian mountains above Llanberis Pass.

== Operations ==

The railway uses three steam locomotives (&quot;Elidir&quot;, &quot;Dolbadarn&quot; and &quot;Thomas Bach&quot;) all of which ran on the internal gauge lines of the Dinorwic Quarry. There are also several diesel locomotives which are used for works trains and when the steam locomotives are unavailable for passenger trains.

When the Quarry closed down in 1969 the lakeside section of the trackbed was utilised for the current Llanberis Lake Railway, originally running from the National Slate Museum at Gilfach Ddu to Pen Llyn. Gilfach Ddu was the main engineering workshop of the Dinorwic Quarry and provided repair facilities for all of the steam locomotives of the quarry system.

== Locomotives ==

===Current locomotives===

===Former locomotives===

These are locomotives that ran on the Llanberis Lake Railway in the past, but have now moved to other locations.

===Locomotives formerly on site===

These are locomotives that were stored at the Llanberis Lake Railway in the past, that have now moved to other locations. They did not run on the LLR during their stay.

<text>Macrobius is a prominent lunar impact crater located to the northwest of the Mare Crisium. Its diameter is 63 km. It was named after ancient Roman writer Macrobius. It lies on the southeast edge of the Lacus Bonitatis, a small lunar mare. The somewhat smaller crater Tisserand lies just to the east. 
The outer wall of Macrobius has a multiply d inner surface, with some slumping along the top of the rim. The small satellite crater Macrobius C lies across the western rim, but the wall is otherwise relatively free of significant wear. In the center of the floor is a central mountain complex. There is a low ridge in the western interior, but the remainder of the floor is relatively level.

Macrobius is a crater of Lower (Early) Imbrian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Macrobius.
The following craters have been renamed by the IAU.
* Macrobius A — &quot;See&quot; Carmichael.
* Macrobius B — &quot;See&quot; Hill.
* Macrobius D — &quot;See&quot; Fredholm.
* Macrobius L — &quot;See&quot; Esclangon.

<text>Nina Katzir (; née Gottlieb; October 4, 1914 – March 12, 1986) was the wife of the President of the State of Israel Ephraim Katzir, and an English teacher at &quot;Tichon meuhad&quot; high school in Rehovot.

==Biography==
Born in Mogilev to the Gottlieb family. At the age of 16, she made Aliya to Mandatory Palestine alone and settled on the Rehovot, at her grandfather&#x27;s house. After graduating from the Beit Hakerem seminary in Jerusalem, she worked as a teacher. She taught Hebrew in Ulpan for new immigrants and taught English in schools. As an English language teacher, she became famous for the modern teaching methods she developed.

She had a column in the Jerusalem Post devoted to foreign language teaching problems. In 1973 she wrote the tourist information book &quot;Hebrew with a smile&quot; which was published by the Ministry of Tourism.

As the wife of the President, she initiated meetings between children&#x27;s writers and children. On her own initiative, International Children&#x27;s Week was celebrated in Israel, as part of its activities, wife of diplomats talk about Israel to children in their country of origin.

After the Yom Kippur War, she created a minor scandal, when she initiated the distribution of thousands of &quot;Playboy&quot; booklets to the soldiers at the front due to a request from soldiers.

The Katzir couple had three children: one son, Meir Kaczelski, who serves as a professor of mathematics at the Technion, and two daughters who died at a young age: daughter Nurit died in a gas inhalation accident and daughter Irit who committed suicide.

She acted as part of the &quot;Nurit Foundation&quot; in memory of her daughter, and organized activities for the teenagers. In 1978, the &quot;Nurit Katzir Municipal Theater Center&quot; in Jerusalem was established in her memory. Other institutions were inaugurated in her daughter name, including the MDA Youth Club and the Nursing School at Assaf Harofeh Hospital.

<text>The are those kanji listed on the , officially announced by the Japanese Ministry of Education. The current list of 2,136 characters was issued in 2010. It is a slightly modified version of the kanji, which was the initial list of secondary school-level kanji standardized after World War II. The list is not a comprehensive list of all characters and readings in regular use; rather, it is intended as a literacy baseline for those who have completed compulsory education, as well as a list of permitted characters and readings for use in official government documents. Due to the requirement that official government documents make use of only kanji and their readings, several rare characters are also included due to their use in the Constitution of Japan, which was being written at the same time the original 1,850-character kanji list was compiled.

The 2,136 kanji in the kanji consist of:
* 1,026 kanji taught in primary school (Grade 1-6) (the kanji)
* 1,110 additional kanji taught in secondary school (Grade 7-9)

==List==
==Changes from the kanji==
In 1981, the kanji replaced the kanji as the standardized list of common kanji. The differences between the two consisted of 95 additional characters, and the simplification of as .

==History==
*1923: The Ministry of Education specified 1,962 kanji and 154 simplified characters.
*1931: The former kanji list was revised and 1,858 characters were specified.
*1942: 1,134 characters as standard kanji and 1,320 characters as sub- kanji were specified.
*1946: The 1,850 characters of kanji were adopted by law &quot;as those most essential for common use and everyday communication&quot;. This list included 881 &quot;basic requirement&quot; kanji for elementary school.
*1981: The 1,945 characters of kanji were adopted, replacing the list of kanji.
*2010: The list was revised on 30 November to include an additional 196 characters and remove 5 characters (, , , , and ), for a total of 2,136. The amendment also made changes to the readings of &quot;kanji&quot; present in the previous kanji list. Twenty-eight &quot;kanji&quot; gained new readings, three &quot;kanji&quot; lost obscure readings and the of was changed from to . The 196 additional characters are:
: Note: Characters in bold are used in the names of prefectures. kanji followed by a character in brackets are not included in JIS X 0208; the character in brackets is the unofficial print variant JIS X 0208 does have. JIS X 0208 also lacks , but does include the official variant . The kanji , , , and also have official variants.
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology instructed teachers to start teaching the new characters in fiscal 2012, so that junior high school students would be able to read them and high school students would be able to write them. High schools and universities started using the characters in their entrance exams in the 2015 academic year.

<doc id="1281665" wikidata="Q6808592" url="?curid=1281665" title="Megamarketing">
<text>Megamarketing is a term coined by U.S. marketing academic, Philip Kotler, to describe the type of marketing activity required when it is necessary to manage elements of the firm&#x27;s external environment (governments, the media, pressure groups, etc.) as well as the marketing variables; Kotler suggests that two more Ps must be added to the marketing mix: public relations and power.

The public relations element of Megamarketing focuses primarily on businesses familiarizing themselves with the surrounding community, prior to actually entering a desired market. Of note, the negotiations that occur as a consequence of this particular form of marketing are often far more rigorous than those associated with conventional marketing; as such, it is difficult to adequately satisfy both parties in an equitable manner. Marketers who choose to pursue these foreign environments must also look to appease the general public, as they can have a significant impact on the continuing profitability of their businesses. One important element comprising the general public involves the local media, as they can heavily influence the perception associated with newly emerging companies.
Contrarily, the power variable also proposed by Philip Kotler deals more so with the power to persuade third parties. This includes offering the correct incentives to entice expansion into foreign markets, in doing so, allowing for a controlling position when conducting business. Kotler&#x27;s framework for power elucidates the importance of establishing strong ties with powerful political members in external markets; this, in turn, should enable ease of access to engage in commerce with these particular countries. Furthermore, this particular aspect of Megamarketing examines the means by which marketers go about incentivizing third parties, such as government organizations, in order to circumvent entry barriers.
If businesses are to successfully adopt this nuanced marketing strategy, it is important that they diversify their business operations and broaden their business scope within the marketplace. This, of course, must be executed whilst continuing to meet the demands of the consumers in the various markets. Additionally, Megamarketing success can be attained through acquiring employees with the correct skill sets; likewise, having a desirable mix of resources on hand at the companies disposal. This broadened form of marketing is typically associated with a long-decision making process; this can be attributed to the fact that it takes a substantial amount of time to coordinate meetings at the same time requiring larger sums of money in an attempt to finance these augmented business endeavors.
Megamarketing is different from traditional marketing in that its primary objective is grounded in expanding operations into external markets. This, in turn, makes it conducive to companies seeking foreign expansion to introduce new products and services to broaden consumer demands. In essence, it seeks to transform the types of industries that are prevalent in an existing market, however, these changes can often come at the expense of over imposing on others. So much so, in fact, that many Megamarketers run the risk of being perceived in a more negative light

<text>ARTEXPRESS, also written ArtExpress, is an art exhibition which is a showcase of Higher School Certificate Visual Arts Examination artworks from across New South Wales, Australia.
==History== 
ArtExpress began in the late 1950s in Sydney, exhibiting at the Art Gallery of NSW since 1983.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (2020–2021), ArtExpress put its exhibitions online.

==Description==
It is a partnership between the NSW Education Standards Authority and NSW Department of Education in association with the Art Gallery of New South Wales. It began in the late 1950s in Sydney, exhibiting at the Art Gallery of NSW since 1983.

Whilst usually perceived as an exhibition of &quot;the best&quot; artworks, this is not necessarily true as the chosen artworks are merely representative of the broad diversity of different artworks submitted for that year&#x27;s HSC. Although students are not so restricted in the works that are produced for the HSC, ARTEXPRESS works must have a &quot;G&quot; rating.

ARTEXPRESS occurs annually in the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney Olympic Park and ten other art galleries in New South Wales. The works selected for ArtExpress reflect trends in the galleries who select the works, therefore they may not represent the exemplar works from the Visual Arts Examination, but the needs of the gallery showing the work. Works selected may reflect trends in cost cutting, so less complex works with fewer components and often less challenging (or engaging) works for the audience are given focus.

==Past exhibitors==
*McLean Edwards (1990)
* Melissa Chiu (1990)
*Ben Quilty (1992)
* David Griggs (1994)
* Jasper Knight (1996)

<text>Hornsby is a tiny lunar impact crater in the western part of the Mare Serenitatis, a lunar mare in the northeast quadrant of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after British astronomer Thomas Hornsby. It is a solitary formation that is located at least 100 kilometers from any significant craters, although the curiously shaped depression Aratus CA lies about 50 km to the west-northwest. To the north-northwest is Linné, a feature notable for its skirt of high-albedo material. To the west of Hornsby is the wrinkle ridge Dorsum Von Cotta.

<text>The ; abbreviated as ) is an advocacy group with international links, based in the Netherlands, which represents the interests of the Dutch entertainment industry and is organised under the Dutch law through the legal form of &quot;stichting&quot;. It is notable for launching court proceedings against copyright infringement in the country and for engaging in lobbying in order to create legal precedents of global significance.

==Participants==
BREIN brings together organizations or rights holders in the entertainment industry, such as film and recording studios. Those are amongst others:
* Buma/Stemra
* Nederlandse Vereniging van Producenten en Importeurs van Beeld- en Geluidsdragers
* Motion Pictures Association

* Bridge Entertainment Group B.V.
* Nederlandse Vereniging van Bioscoopexploitanten
* Stichting Videma
* Nederlandse Vereniging van Entertainment Retailers
* Nederlandse Uitgeversverbond
* members of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry

==History==

Tim (Timotheus Jacobus) Kuik, a law graduate of the University of Amsterdam (1982), oversaw the activities of BREIN from its inception. He assumed leadership of BREIN in 1999 after returning to his native Netherlands from Los Angeles, where he had headed the Motion Picture Association&#x27;s global anti-piracy programme from 1996. He had originally worked for CIC Video, a joint venture between Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures which represented a change in policy from attempts to ban VHS, and led MPA&#x27;s anti-piracy activities in Europe from 1992, which included interventions in Hungary and Bulgaria. Before leaving Los Angeles, on 21 February 1998 he presented a paper titled &quot;How the East Was Won: Legal Aspects of the Entertainment Business in Russia&quot; at a conference there. By the time of its publication in summer 1999 under the changed title &quot;Piracy in Russia: An Epidemic&quot;, Kuik was listed as the General Director of BREIN.

On 30 July 2009, an Amsterdam civil law court ruled in favour of BREIN in its lawsuit over copyright infringement against the three alleged operators of The Pirate Bay (TPB), who were not officially summoned by the court.

In August 2009, Kuik addressed the Hacking at Random conference on the future of copyright laws and was confronted by TPB&#x27;s founder Gottfrid Svartholm over his allegations that TPB is run for profit. Kuik was unable to substantiate his claims.

In October 2012, BREIN won a landmark case in The Hague against the Dutch hosting service provider XS Networks, which had refused to shut down a torrent-based file sharing site at BREIN&#x27;s request and hand over the personal details of its owner to BREIN. The court found XS Network liable for damages for copyright infringement and ordered it to disclose information about the site owner. The ruling was seen as a precedent in that it held hosting providers legally responsible for not complying with requests of industry interest groups in advance of a court order.

In October 2020, BREIN won its ten-year-long lawsuit against three internet service providers (ISPs) – Ziggo, KPN and XS4ALL – when a Lelystad court ordered the ISPs to block The Pirate Bay. In March 2021, the BREIN employee Bastiaan van Ramshorst sent a copy of the blocking order against TPB to Google, although the company had not been named in it.

In November 2021, BREIN and the Dutch Copyright Federation concluded an official covenant-type agreement with six ISPs (Ziggo, KPN, Delta Fiber, T-Mobile, Canal+ and NLConnect), negotiated with the support of the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security, in which all the participating operators agreed to block a website if one of them received a blocking order against it. BREIN was charged with updating the domain lists of blocked websites, while the ISPs agreed to bear technical costs of enforcing the blocks.

By November 2021 Google voluntarily complied with enforcing the block against TPB, an action that was reported to be unprecedented on its part. BREIN claimed that Google found itself in &quot;the same situation&quot; as the Dutch ISPs who had signed the recent covenant. BREIN subsequently reported further collaboration with Google entailing removing blocked domains from local search results.

In March 2024, BREIN obtained a court order from the Rotterdam District Court for a Dutch ISP to block the Library Genesis and Anna&#x27;s Archive shadow libraries, thus expanding the existing blocklist under the 2021 covenant. The court issued a dynamic blocking order covering all future domains.

In April 2024, Kuik retired and was replaced by Bastiaan van Ramshorst, a business law graduate (2000) and a member of the International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property, who joined BREIN around 2010 and whom Kuik had prepared as his successor over the previous ten years. In an interview given on the occasion of his retirement, Kuik admitted that the business model behind Netflix, Spotify and Napster largely derives from the copyright-infringing streaming services BREIN has sought to close down.

==Shutdowns of alleged piracy sites==
BREIN is known for shutting down Dutch eDonkey 2000 link giant ShareConnector in December 2004. Due to controversy over the legality of links to illegal content, and a lack of quality in the evidence provided by BREIN, the case was not put to trial for several years. After being offline for two years, ShareConnector reopened in December 2006 but on November 12, 2007, Shareconnector went offline again.

On March 16, 2010 the Amsterdam Court of Appeal ruled that sites that offer hash links (like .torrent links) were facilitating copyright infringement, an unlawful behavior. Shareconnector did not make the content available to the public because they did not have control over the content itself and they did not interfere in the up- and downloading process. However, the Court of Appeal ruled that the site was illegal because their procedure made it easier for users to retrieve the illegal content from the eDonkey network.

On October 23, 2007 BREIN, together with IFPI, BPI, Dutch police, and other organizations shut down prominent Bittorrent tracker Oink&#x27;s Pink Palace.

In a civil court case which BREIN filed in the Netherlands against the founders of The Pirate Bay, on 22 October 2009 the Amsterdam District Court ruled that The Pirate Bay was not making a direct infringement but its facilitating activities amount to an unlawful act. The Court ordered The Pirate Bay to remove a list of torrents that link to copyright-protected works in the Netherlands and to make these torrents on its websites inaccessible for Internet users in the Netherlands. The Pirate Bay ignored the verdict.

In January 2012 BREIN announced that a Dutch court had ordered Ziggo and XS4ALL to block all access to The Pirate Bay. On May 10, 2012 this judgement was followed by a court order of the District Court in The Hague against UPC, KPN, T-Mobile and Tele2 to also block The Pirate Bay for their customers.

Ziggo and XS4ALL appealed this verdict and won, with BREIN being ordered to pay 326,000 Euro as a compensation for process costs.

On March 23, 2024, the Dutch pirate site blocklist has been reported to now include Anna&#x27;s Archive and Library Genesis, based on a request by BREIN.

==Lawsuit by FTD==
After a series of allegations that Usenet community Fill Threads Database (FTD) was acting illegally, the Dutch FTD started a lawsuit against BREIN in May 2009. BREIN president Tim Kuik alleged in a Dutch newspaper that &quot;Although they [FTD] are not carrying illegal content on their servers, what FTD does is simply criminal&quot;. FTD is suing for a retraction of this libelous statement and demands a declaration from the courts that its activities are entirely within the law.

On February 9, 2011, the Dutch District Court of Haarlem ruled, that FTD had acted unlawfully and issued an injunction. FTD was obliged to ban all references to files of BREIN members.

The court also ruled that Tim Kuik was free to expose the conduct of FTD and communicate the opinion of BREIN. The request for rectification was therefore rejected by the court.

FTD ceased all its operations a few weeks after the verdict.

==Alleged attack on BREIN website==
On 1 June 2009 Tim Kuik published an online article claiming BREIN&#x27;s website was &quot;broken&quot; by hackers performing DDoS attacks. He speculated about a possible connection with the intended court summons against The Pirate Bay. Several independent sources reported the site&#x27;s deep links were still available (only the frontpage was inaccessible) and as such BREIN&#x27;s claim of having been attacked was false. Brein responded claiming the attacks had stopped and that the site&#x27;s year old backup had been used to recover the site. Because the backup was dated, the website was now under construction.

Internet blog Geenstijl purportedly discovered BREIN&#x27;s server was still fully operational and there had been no attack whatsoever - the complete news archive was still available. (A password was later added to BREIN&#x27;s news archive to prevent further checks on availability.)

On 23 June 2009 The Pirate Bay announced a lawsuit against Tim Kuik on libel charges, claiming The Pirate Bay had nothing to do with the alleged DDoS attack.

==Criticism==
In September 2009 BREIN CEO Tim Kuik attracted controversy when in a news conference he stated he was using a laptop confiscated from a &quot;pirate&quot; and given to him by someone involved with the case.

BREIN attracted controversy again when several suspicious aspects of their lawsuit against The Pirate Bay and Reservella were revealed, including evidence that documents used to link Fredrik Neij of The Pirate Bay to Reservella were faked. Peter Sunde and the Dutch Pirate Party filed criminal felony charges against both Tim Kuik and BREIN for fraud and forgery.

In January 2011, BREIN targeted one of the Internet&#x27;s largest warez piracy topsites. The site, known as Swan, was taken down by hosting provider WorldStream and without judicial process BREIN seized its servers. The owners of the servers retaliated by seizing them back and may sue BREIN for breach of privacy and property rights as BREIN is a private organization and has no special legal or investigative authority.

<text>The Swiss Football Association (, , , ) is the governing body of football in Switzerland. It organizes the football league, the Swiss Football League and the Switzerland national football team. It is based in Bern.

It was formed in 1895, was a founder member of FIFA in 1904 and joined UEFA during its foundation year, 1954. FIFA is based in Zurich. Also UEFA is based in the Swiss city of Nyon.

ASF-SFV is the abbreviation of the associations name in three of the national languages of Switzerland. ASF stands for both French (&quot;Association Suisse de Football&quot;) and Italian (&quot;Associazione Svizzera di Football&quot;), while SFV is the German (&quot;Schweizerischer Fussballverband&quot;).- Romansh - It is abbreviated as ASB (&quot;Associaziun Svizra da Ballape&quot;).

==Origins==
Switzerland was the first country in Continental Europe to adhere to football, which was introduced in the 1860s by Anglo-Saxon students and teachers from Swiss private schools in the French-speaking part of the country around Lausanne and Geneva, forming teams that initially played a mixture of rugby and football. There is documentation from Geneva that football was played at the Château de Lancy and La Châtelaine institutes in the 1860s. Another club founded by English students was the Lausanne Football and Cricket Club, which was established in 1860, thus being the first football club in Continental Europe, being only three years younger than Sheffield; however, it is likely that Lausanne initially played cricket and only began to practice football in the 1870s.

The oldest Swiss club still in existence, FC St. Gallen, was founded in 1879, by locals from the embroidery industry in German-speaking Switzerland, who had learned about the game from English students; it was followed in 1886 by the Grasshopper Club Zurich. In 1895, Lausanne FCC, St. Gallen, and the Grasshopper Zurich clubs, were among the founding members of the Swiss Football Association. The SFV was one of the seven national associations that founded the world football association FIFA in 1904.

<doc id="1281684" wikidata="Q5928459" url="?curid=1281684" title="Hudson's">
<text>The J. L. Hudson Company (commonly known simply as Hudson&#x27;s) was an upscale retail department store chain based in Detroit, Michigan. Hudson&#x27;s flagship store, on Woodward Avenue in Downtown Detroit (demolished October 24, 1998), was the tallest department store in the world in 1961, and, at one time, claimed to be the second-largest department store, after Macy&#x27;s, in the United States, by square footage.

==Growth==
Founded in 1881 by Joseph Lowthian Hudson, the store thrived during the record growth of Detroit and the auto industry in the first half of the 20th century. In 1909, J.L. Hudson invested in a start-up automobile manufacturer which was named the Hudson Motor Car Company in his honor. The Hudson Motor Car Company eventually became part of the American Motors Corporation and later Chrysler. Hudson operated the store until his death in 1912, when his four nephews (James, Joseph, Oscar, and Richard Webber) assumed control. The third generation of the family assumed control in 1961, when Joseph L. Hudson, Jr., became president of the company.

Over time, the store grew from its beginnings in the Detroit Opera House to a 25-story building with and occupying an entire city block.

==Policies==
Hudson&#x27;s was known for customer satisfaction and its liberal return policy that would include even merchandise that customers had purchased years earlier but never used.

In 1952, Hudson&#x27;s total sales were $175 million but issued refunds totaling $25 million. Store executives felt that to be a small price to pay for customer loyalty.

In addition to cultivating loyalty through sales policies, Hudson&#x27;s was involved in the community. In 1924, two years prior to rival Macy&#x27;s, it staged its first Thanksgiving Parade, which continues today. In 1923, it unveiled the world&#x27;s largest flag, which covered of the Woodward facade of the building. The flag was displayed annually until it was replaced, in 1949, by a larger flag. In 1959, the store began sponsorship of the annual fireworks display that was part of the International Freedom Festival.

==Locations==
Hudson&#x27;s Budget Store occupied two full basement levels of the downtown store as well as several branches. It had an independent staff of buyers, carried its own line of merchandise, and was considered the greatest competition to the big store.

Hudson&#x27;s expanded into suburban Detroit, starting with the anchor store at Northland Center in nearby Southfield, Michigan, the largest shopping center in the United States when it opened, in 1954. Similar suburban malls followed (Eastland Center in 1957 and Westland Center in 1965) as well as other locations throughout the tri-state region. The Dayton Co. of Minneapolis acquired The J.L. Hudson Co. in 1969 to form the Dayton–Hudson Corporation, the predecessor to Target Corporation, but &quot;The J.L. Hudson Co.&quot; continued to operate as a semiautonomous entity. Dayton–Hudson eventually acquired and sold several other department store chains.

==Decline==
Though customers flocked to the suburban locations, the downtown store still accounted for half of Hudson&#x27;s business in 1961, but demographic changes continued to erode sales. Store officials even considered closing the store as early as 1971, citing $9,000,000 in pilferage, but decided to remain for fear of the potential backlash of city officials and customers. By 1978, they agreed to construct a smaller store of as part of a proposed downtown shopping center.

Lack of interest from other retailers and funding problems shelved the center, and after many years of declining sales and consolidating selling space, the flagship Hudson&#x27;s store closed January 17, 1983, at nearly the lowest point of Downtown Detroit&#x27;s decline.

After closure, Hudson&#x27;s maintained its headquarters staff of about 1,100 in the downtown store. In May 1984, The J.L. Hudson Co. formally merged into The Department Store Division of the Dayton Hudson Corp., but Hudson&#x27;s stores continued to carry the Hudson&#x27;s name until 2001. All executive and buying positions transferred to Minneapolis, and other staff moved to space at the Northland store in Southfield. The last corporate department in the downtown Detroit building, credit operations, moved in October 1986. Dayton Hudson sold the building in December 1989, and it was imploded on October 24, 1998. 

Hudson&#x27;s operated a large warehouse complex in an area bounded by Madison, Brush, Adams and Beacon Streets in Downtown Detroit. The buildings were constructed between the 1920s and the 1950s and averaged between four and six floors. In the early 1980s, Building 3 was sold and renovated into Madison Center, home for the 36th District Court. The remaining buildings in the complex closed in the late 1990s to make room for the new 65,000-seat stadium, Ford Field. Ford Field partially incorporated one of the warehouses into its design.

The vacant site in Detroit between Woodward and Farmer Street and between E. Grand River and Gratiot was turned into an underground parking garage with supports in place for a future building. The address of the first Hudson&#x27;s building on the lot was on Farmer, not at 1206 Woodward, the building&#x27;s later and better-known address. In 2018 the parking garage at the former Hudson&#x27;s site was demolished to make way for two new buildings on the former Hudson&#x27;s site. One of these new buildings will be the second tallest building in Michigan upon its completion, project height of .

In 2000, Dayton–Hudson Corporation took the name of its most successful operation, becoming Target Corporation, and one year, it later re-branded all Hudson&#x27;s and Dayton&#x27;s locations with the Marshall Field&#x27;s moniker, an operation purchased by Dayton–Hudson in 1990. After being briefly owned by May Department Stores, the former Hudson&#x27;s stores were acquired by Federated Department Stores in 2006 and all Marshall Field&#x27;s stores were incorporated into the Macy&#x27;s chain. Target still maintains a common law trademark in the use of Daytons.com and Hudsons.com, which both redirect to the Target website.

<text>The are kanji which Japanese elementary school students should learn from first through sixth grade. Also known as , these kanji are listed on the . The table is developed and maintained by the Japanese Ministry of Education (MEXT). Although the list is designed for Japanese students, it can also be used as a sequence of learning characters by non-native speakers as a means of focusing on the most commonly used kanji.

 kanji are a subset (1,026) of the 2,136 characters of kanji.

==Versions of the list==
*1946 created with 881 characters
*1977 expanded to 996 characters
*1989 expanded to 1,006 characters
*2017 expanded to 1,026 characters
**The following 20 characters, all used in prefecture names, were added in 2017.
**&#x27; (Ibaraki), &#x27; (Ehime), &#x27; (Shizuoka, Okayama and Fukuoka), &#x27; (Niigata), &#x27; (Gifu), &#x27; (Kumamoto), &#x27; (Kagawa), &#x27; (Saga), &#x27; (Saitama), &#x27; (Nagasaki and Miyazaki), &#x27; (Shiga), &#x27; (Kagoshima), &#x27; (Okinawa), &#x27; (Fukui), &#x27; (Okinawa), &#x27; (Tochigi), &#x27; (Kanagawa and Nara), &#x27; (Yamanashi), &#x27; (Ōsaka), &#x27; (Gifu)

# The does not contain readings or meanings of each kanji.
# Many kanji have complex meanings and nuances, or express concepts not directly translatable into English. In those cases, the English meanings mentioned here are approximate.
# In the readings, readings after - (hyphen) are okurigana.
# A - (hyphen) at the end of the -yomi corresponds to a small tsu in kana, which indicates that the following consonant is geminated.

==Special characters==
 are characters originally created in Japan; two of them are kanji:
 (Grade 4) and (Grade 3). There are also 8 within the secondary-school kanji and 16 within the kanji.
The character and some others are also used in Chinese now, but most are unknown outside Japan.
 are characters and combinations of characters that have different meanings in Japanese and Chinese

For example, the character combination means &#x27;letter&#x27; in Japanese, but &#x27;toilet paper&#x27; in Chinese. However, the isolated characters have the same meaning in both languages: (Grade 1) means &#x27;hand&#x27;, and (Grade 2) means &#x27;paper&#x27;.

==Simplified characters and their traditional forms==

===Differences in simplification between China and Japan===

China and Japan simplified their writing systems independently from each other. After World War II, their relations were hostile, so they did not cooperate. Traditional Chinese characters are still officially used in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Korea (Hanja supplemented Hangul, but are now mainly historical), and by many overseas Chinese.

In Chinese, many more characters were simplified than in Japanese; some characters were simplified in only one language; other characters were simplified in the same way in both languages, and other characters were simplified in both languages but in different ways. This means that those who want to learn the writing systems of both languages must sometimes learn at least three different variations of one character: traditional Chinese, simplified Chinese, and modern Japanese (for example ). Some others have more variations, such as (), some of which are considered the older forms of Chinese characters and variations of different Chinese regions, and the older forms of Japanese characters ().

===Traditional characters that may cause problems displaying===
Note that within the kanji, there are 26 characters; the old forms of which may cause problems displaying:

* Grade 2 (2 kanji): 
* Grade 3 (8 kanji): 
* Grade 4 (6 kanji): 
* Grade 5 (1 kanji): 
* Grade 6 (9 kanji): 
* Within the kanji, the same is true for 36 secondary-school kanji, so, in total, 62 of the 2,136 kanji have traditional forms that may cause problems displaying.

These characters are Unicode CJK Unified Ideographs for which the old form () and the new form () have been unified under the Unicode standard. Although the old and new forms are distinguished under the JIS X 0213 standard, the old forms map to Unicode CJK Compatibility Ideographs which are considered by Unicode to be canonically equivalent to the new forms and may not be distinguished by user agents. Therefore, depending on the user environment, it may not be possible to see the distinction between old and new forms of the characters. In particular, all Unicode normalization methods merge the old characters with the new ones.

===List of simplified kanji===

For example, is the simplified form of .
Note that is used to simplify three different traditional characters (, , and ).
*

==The kanji and their Chinese equivalents==

The characters are sorted by the radicals of the Japanese kanji. The two and , which have no Chinese equivalents, are not listed here. See also the section above.

===Same form in Chinese and Japanese===

The following kanji are characters of Group 1 (not simplified in either language, e.g. ). For characters of Group 2 (same simplification in China and Japan, but a traditional form exists, e.g. ), see above.

===Different forms in Chinese and Japanese===
The order is &quot;Modern Japanese -Traditional Chinese - Simplified Chinese&quot;, e.g. . Some characters were simplified the same way in both languages, the others were simplified in one language only.

<doc id="1281696" wikidata="Q1162350" url="?curid=1281696" title="Vṛddhi">
<text>Vṛddhi (also rendered vr̥ddhi) is a technical term in morphophonology given to the strongest grade in the vowel gradation system of Sanskrit and of Proto-Indo-European. The term is derived from Sanskrit वृद्धि &quot;vṛddhi&quot;, , &#x27;growth&#x27;, from .

==Origins==
Vṛddhi itself has its origins in proto-vṛddhi, a process in the early stage of the Proto-Indo-European language originally for forming possessive derivatives of ablauting noun stems, with the meaning &quot;of, belonging to, descended from&quot;. To form a vṛddhi-derivative, one takes the zero-grade of the ablauting stem (i.e. removes the vowel), inserts the vowel *&quot;e&quot; in a position which does not necessarily match that of the original vowel, and appends an accented thematic vowel (or accents any existing final thematic vowel). For example:

However, in a later stage of the language this appears to have extended to non-ablauting noun stems that already contained &quot;*e&quot;, which would contract with the inserted vowel to form a lengthened &quot;*ē&quot;:

The above example also displays the stressing of the thematic vowel when it already exists. It is this later version of proto-vṛddhi which is displayed in Sanskrit&#x27;s lengthened vṛddhi grade.

==Vṛddhi in Sanskrit==

The general phenomenon of vowel gradation, including vṛddhi formation, has been extensively studied and documented as part of Sanskrit&#x27;s vigorous grammatical tradition, most importantly in the &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot; of the grammarian Pāṇini.

For example:
* &quot;carried&quot; (zero grade)
* &quot;burden&quot; (first grade, full grade, or guṇa)
* &quot;to be carried&quot; (second grade, lengthened grade, or vṛddhi)

The full pattern of vowel gradation can be observed as follows:

==Vṛddhi in Indo-European==
In modern Indo-European linguistics it is used in Pāṇini&#x27;s sense and applied to the Indo-European languages in general. The feature is considered to have been inherited from the Proto-Indo-European language.
* (zero grade of the reconstructed verb meaning &quot;to carry&quot;)
* (full grade)
* (vṛddhi, lengthened grade)

<doc id="1281708" wikidata="Q466166" url="?curid=1281708" title="The Adventure of the Dying Detective">
<text>&quot;The Adventure of the Dying Detective&quot;, in some editions simply titled &quot;The Dying Detective&quot;, is one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories that were written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. It was originally published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in the United States on 22 November 1913, and &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in December 1913. Together with seven other stories, it was collected in &quot;His Last Bow&quot; (published 1917).

==Plot==
Dr. Watson is called to tend Holmes, who is apparently dying of a rare tropical disease, Tapanuli fever, contracted while he was on a case. Watson is shocked, not having heard about his friend&#x27;s illness. Mrs. Hudson says that Holmes has neither eaten nor drunk anything in three days.

Holmes instructs Watson not to come near him, because the illness is highly infectious. In fact, he scorns to be treated by Watson and insults his abilities, astonishing and hurting the doctor. Although Watson wishes to examine Holmes himself or call in a specialist, Holmes demands that Watson wait several hours before seeking help. While Watson waits, he examines several objects in Holmes&#x27;s room. Holmes grows angry when Watson touches a small ivory box, ordering Watson to put it down and sit still.
At six o&#x27;clock, Holmes tells Watson to turn the gaslight on, but only half-full. He then instructs Watson to bring Mr Culverton Smith of 13 Lower Burke Street to see Holmes, but to make sure that Watson returns to Baker Street before Smith arrives.

Watson goes to Smith&#x27;s address. Although Smith refuses to see anyone, Watson forces his way in. Once Watson explains his errand on behalf of Sherlock Holmes, Smith&#x27;s attitude changes drastically. Smith agrees to come to Baker Street within a half hour. Watson excuses himself, saying that he has another appointment, and returns to Baker Street before Smith&#x27;s arrival.

Believing that they are alone, Smith is frank with Holmes. It emerges, to the hiding Watson&#x27;s horror, that Holmes has been sickened by the same illness that killed Smith&#x27;s nephew Victor Savage. Smith then sees the little ivory box, which he had sent to Holmes by post, and which contains a sharp spring infected with the illness. Smith pockets it, removing the evidence of his crime. He then resolves to stay there and watch Holmes die.

Holmes asks Smith to turn the gas up full, which Smith does. Smith then asks Holmes if he would like anything else, to which Holmes replies - no longer in the voice of a man near death - &quot;a match and a cigarette.&quot; Inspector Morton then enters, as the full gaslight was the signal to move in. Holmes tells Morton to arrest Culverton Smith for the murder of his nephew, and perhaps also for the attempted murder of Sherlock Holmes. Smith points out that his word is as good as Holmes&#x27; in court, but Holmes then calls for Watson to emerge from behind the screen, to present himself as another witness to the conversation.

Holmes explains his illness was feigned as a ruse to induce Smith to confess to his nephew&#x27;s murder. Holmes was not infected by the little box; he has enough enemies to know that he must always examine his mail carefully before he opens it. Starving himself for three days and the claim of the &quot;disease&#x27;s&quot; infectious nature was to keep Watson from examining him and discovering the ruse, since, as he clarifies, he has every respect for his friend&#x27;s medical skills.

==Analysis==
In the story, the killer Culverton Smith&#x27;s motive for killing his nephew, Victor Savage, is mentioned in an offhand remark by Holmes that Savage stood between &quot;this monster [Smith] and a reversion.&quot; &quot;The New Annotated Sherlock Holmes&quot; has a note for this word:

The setting date may be inferred from Watson&#x27;s mention of it being &quot;the second year of my marriage&quot;, the first having been 1889. Inspector Morton is referred to in a familiar fashion but this is his only appearance in canon. Canonical scholar Leslie S. Klinger wondered if Morton was the companion to Inspector Brown in &quot;The Sign of the Four&quot;.

Tropical disease specialist William A. Sodeman Jr., proposed that &quot;Tapanuli fever&quot; was melioidosis, a conclusion supported by physician Setu K. Vora. Vora raised the possibility that Conan Doyle read the first report of melioidosis published in 1912 before writing his short story in 1913.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Adventure of the Dying Detective&quot; was published in the US in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; on 22 November 1913, and in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in December 1913. The story was published with three illustrations by Frederic Dorr Steele in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, and with four illustrations by Walter Paget (Sidney Paget&#x27;s brother) in the &quot;Strand&quot;. The story was included in the short story collection &quot;His Last Bow&quot;, which was published in the UK and the US in October 1917.

==Adaptations==

===Film and television===
* A 1921 short film adaptation was released in the Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood as Holmes.
* A 1951 TV episode of &quot;We Present Alan Wheatley as Mr Sherlock Holmes in...&quot; was adapted from the story, starring Alan Wheatley as Holmes, Raymond Francis as Dr. Watson and Bill Owen as Inspector Lestrade. The episode is now lost.
* A 1994 TV episode of &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes, Edward Hardwicke as Watson, and Jonathan Hyde as Culverton Smith was adapted from the story. This version is faithful to the original short story but greatly expanded. It features much more detail on Smith&#x27;s nephew, who is instead portrayed as Smith&#x27;s cousin, and replaces the infected spring with a pair of tacks. Unlike the original story, where Culverton Smith is arrested, a fight ensues after Watson reveals himself where Smith ends up pricking himself on the nails which is implied to later cause his death.
* The story was adapted as a 1999 episode of the animated television series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot; titled &quot;The Adventure of the Deranged Detective&quot;.
* A 2012 TV episode of &quot;Elementary&quot; starring Jonny Lee Miller as Holmes, which is the ninth episode of the first season, mirrors many elements from the story, albeit with Holmes simply ill from a more conventional disease that thus limits his ability to conduct fieldwork.
* A 2017 episode of &quot;Sherlock&quot; includes the character Culverton Smith, portrayed by Toby Jones. The title of the episode, &quot;The Lying Detective&quot;, is a play on the title of the original story. Unlike the original tale, where Culverton Smith is only suggested to have committed one murder, &quot;The Lying Detective&quot; presents him as a wealthy philanthropist who has arranged for a particular room in a hospital he sponsors to have a secret passage that he can use to sneak in and kill anyone being treated in it. Alerted to Smith&#x27;s true nature by his apparently psychotic daughter as part of an unknown agenda, Sherlock uses this as an opportunity to create a dangerous situation that John Watson can save him from to fulfill Mary Watson&#x27;s last request to save John from his grief after her death, deliberately falling off the wagon and reverting to an old drug habit so that he can be regarded as simply delusional, attacking Culverton and accusing him of being a serial killer so that he will be sent to Smith&#x27;s hospital for treatment. This gives Sherlock a chance to hear Culverton&#x27;s confession via a recording device hidden in John&#x27;s old cane, which he had predicted John would leave with him after he was sent to hospital. Although the original confession is ruled inadmissible as Sherlock basically acquired it through entrapment, Culverton subsequently willingly confesses his crimes to Lestrade, gleefully musing that he will be even more famous now.

===Radio===
* &quot;The Dying Detective&quot; was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. The episode, which aired in 1931, featured Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. Other productions of the story aired in 1935, with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson, and 1936, with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson.
* An episode titled &quot;The Riddle of the Dying Detective&quot; aired in 1939 in the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson. Another episode titled &quot;The Adventure of the Dying Detective&quot; aired in 1943. The story was also adapted into a 1947 radio episode of the series, with Tom Conway as Holmes and Bruce as Watson. This version features Inspector Lestrade instead of Inspector Morton.
* A 1954 radio adaptation with John Gielgud as Holmes and Ralph Richardson as Watson aired on the BBC Light Programme. Hugh Manning played Inspector Morton. Along with other Sherlock Holmes radio adaptations with Gielgud and Richardson, the production aired on NBC radio in 1955.
* The story was adapted for BBC radio in 1967 by Michael Hardwick, as part of the 1952–1969 radio series starring Carleton Hobbs as Holmes and Norman Shelley as Watson.
* A 1994 BBC Radio 4 adaptation dramatised by Robert Forrest aired as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Edward Petherbridge as Culverton Smith and Alex Jennings as Savage. 
* In 2010, the story was adapted as an episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

===Books===
It was adapted into one of the books of the Hong Kong children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Great Detective Sherlock Holmes&quot;, as &quot;The Dying Detective&quot; (瀕死的大偵探). It is Book #19 of the original Chinese version, and book #14 of the English version.

<text>Horrebow is a lunar impact crater that is located along the northern shore of Mare Frigoris, just to the south of the walled plain J. Herschel. To the west of Horrebow is the crater Robinson.

The crater is named after Danish astronomer Peder Horrebow.

Horrebow is roughly circular, but it has a narrower inner wall along the east and southeast sides than elsewhere around the perimeter. The inner walls have slumped, forming a ledge around the base of the slope. The interior floor is circular, but is offset to the east due to the asymmetry of the wall. The rim of the crater is sharp-edged, and is not significantly eroded.

The crater overlies the southwest part of a similar-sized crater with the designation Horrebow A. This satellite crater also joins the southeast rim of J. Herschel.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Horrebow.

<text>Dhaka Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) is a public medical college and hospital located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Established in 1946, the college houses a medical school as well as a tertiary care hospital on its campus.
==History==
===Site during pre-college years===
The college&#x27;s original building was built prior to the Partition of Bengal of 1905. In 1904, the building was being used as the secretariat (headquarters) of the newly formed provinces of East Bengal and Assam.

In 1921, it was turned over to the University of Dhaka, which was founded that year. Part of the building was used as the university&#x27;s medical center, another as the students&#x27; dormitory, and the rest as the office of the administrative wing of the Arts faculty.

In 1939, the Dhaka University Council requested the British government to establish a separate medical college in Dhaka. The proposal was postponed because of the onset of the Second World War.

During World War II, the medical center building became an American armed forces hospital. The Americans vacated the building at the end of the war.

===Establishment of the college===
In 1946, due to the partition of India, all the advanced students (From K-4 to K-1) as well as many lecturers and professors were transferred from Calcutta Medical College to start academic studies and maintain hospital facilities in the newly established Dhaka Medical College. Academic classes started on 10 July, which is celebrated as DMC Day.

Major William John Virgin, the head of the committee formed to establish the Dhaka Medical College, was the first principal. In the beginning, there were only four departments: medicine, surgery, gynecology and otolaryngology (ENT).

Since the college did not initially have anatomy or physiology departments, the students at first attended those classes at Mitford Medical School (now the Sir Salimullah Medical College), also in Dhaka; but after a month, Professor of Anatomy Pashupati Basu and Professor of Physiology Hiralal Saha joined the staff, and their specialties were taught in ward no. 22 of the hospital.

===Expansion===
After the construction of new academic buildings in 1955, a lecture hall and a dissection gallery were built in the college. The college and hospital premises were expanded with temporary sheds, some of which were built for outdoor services of the hospital and some for student housing. New buildings for housing, college, and hospital were constructed in phases: a dormitory for girls in 1952, a dormitory for male students in 1954–55, a new complex of academic buildings in 1955, and a dormitory for internee doctors in 1974–75. The new academic and hospital building, Dhaka Medical College Hospital-2, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 3 October 2013. The country&#x27;s first ever autologous bone marrow transplant took place in its bone marrow transplant unit.

=== Origin of &#x27;K&#x27; ===
Every student batch, or class, of Dhaka Medical College is tagged with the prefix K along with a number. The first year, the beginning batch of the college, was named K-1, likewise the second year as K-2, the third year as K-3, the fourth year as K-4, and the fifth year as K-5. In 2021, DMC hosted its 78th batch, hence branded as K-78. Many theories exist about the origin of the letter K, the most popular being that K stands for Kolkata, as many students of DMC&#x27;s earlier batches migrated from Calcutta Medical College. Although Kolkata was officially known as Calcutta until 2001, the city was widely pronounced as Kolkata/Kolikata in Bengali. Though the first ten medical schools did not follow this tradition, yet another theory proposes that, as the institute was the 11th medical school in the Indian subcontinent, K, the 11th letter of the English alphabet, is used to represent that.

==Undergraduate course==
A countrywide combined medical admission test for the MBBS course is held every year under the supervision of DGHS. 139,217 eligible students sat for the entrance exams in 2023. Students after passing Higher Secondary School Certificate or equivalent examinations with the required grades can apply for the admission test. In 2023, a total of 230 seats, 226 general seats and 4 seats for the freedom fighter quota, were allocated for the MBBS course in Dhaka Medical College.

The qualified candidates, according to their preferences, get the opportunity to study at Dhaka Medical College. Foreign candidates from both SAARC and non-SAARC countries are selected by DGHS and MOHFW as per required qualifications.

The college runs a 5-year MBBS course according to the curriculum developed by BMDC. A student studies anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, forensic medicine, community medicine, medicine &amp; allied subjects, surgery &amp; allied subjects and gynecology and oObstetrics during the course period.

The course is divided into 4 phases. Four professional examinations, one at the end of each phase, are held under the University of Dhaka. After passing the fourth or final professional examination, a student is awarded an MBBS degree. Course curriculum follows percentage system grading. Pass mark for the college&#x27;s internal as well as professional examinations is 60 percent. Students shall have to pass written (MCQ + SAQ + formative), oral, practical and clinical examinations separately.

== Postgraduate courses ==
The college offers MD, MS, Diploma, MPhil in 50 different subjects in affiliation with University of Dhaka and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University.

The college also runs three fellowship courses of the Bangladesh College of Physicians and Surgeons in different disciplines.

==Principals==

== Hospital wing ==
=== Facilities and services ===
Dhaka Medical College has a 2600-bed teaching hospital as Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) within the same compound, with 92 wards. It is a tertiary referral hospital. It has a 300-bed facility dedicated for burn and plastic surgery. It was the largest burn unit of the country until Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn and Plastic Surgery was set.

With over 500 admissions per day, 1300 emergency visits per day and 5000 patients at OPD per day at the hospital, it has an occupancy rate of 133%. It also includes about 50 Operation Theatres that perform about 50,000 major operations and about 35,000 minor operations per year.

In 2015, the Hospital&#x27;s Out-Patient Department provided services to 799,896 patients. More 346,580 patients attended at the emergency and 149,122 patients got admitted in different facilities of the hospital in 2015. The surgical staffs performed 58,355 surgeries in 2015. Expansion plan to turn the hospital into a 5000-bed facility has been contemplated.

Country&#x27;s first bone marrow transplant center was set in this hospital in October 2013 in collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital. This unit conducted first ever successful autologous bone marrow transplant in the country in March 2014. The unit also introduced allogeneic bone marrow transplant on 3 July 2019, the first in the country.

=== Clinical teaching ===
It is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country. Bedside teaching and clinical examinations of the undergraduate as well as postgraduate students take place at the hospital wing.

==Role in national politics==

===Bengali Language Movement (1948-1952)===
The college dormitories that were known as barracks were at the heart of the Bengali Language Movement from 1948 to 1952. The barracks were formerly situated at the current location of the Shaheed Minar.

There were about 20 tin shed barracks where the medical students resided. Because they were close to the Parliament of East Pakistan (presently Jagannath Hall of Dhaka University), the medical dormitories were chosen as the center of the student movement.

In the early hours of 21 February 1952, all the students of Dhaka Medical College gathered in front of the medical college dormitories. In the afternoon the group headed for the parliament which was in session. No procession was allowed due to the imposition of Section 144 (a section of the penal code that prohibited unlawful assembly). The students decided to defy Section 144 at 4:00 PM at the historic &quot;Aam-tola&quot; (which was situated beside the present day Emergency gate).

The police fired at the procession, resulting in the deaths of Salam, Barkat, Rafique, Jabbar and Shafiur.
After sunset on 21 February, at the site of the deaths, the students of Dhaka Medical College decided to build a monument. Badrul Alam and Sayed Haider the then students of Dhaka Medical College planned and designed the structure. They worked continuously on 22 and 23 February and finished the construction, using bricks, gravel and cement reserved for the hospital. A paper with Shaheed Smritistambha written on it was attached on the monument. It was inaugurated by the father of Shofiur Rahman, a martyr of language movement. However, the monument was demolished by government forces on 26 February 1952.

===Independence War (1971)===
Many staff and students took part in the 1971 Bangladesh War of Independence, as fighters or in treating the injured. DMC&#x27;s doctors, teachers and students laid their lives in the war. Many eminent physicians and academics were abducted from home and killed during the war.

<text>A bark beetle is the common name for the subfamily of beetles Scolytinae. Previously, this was considered a distinct family (Scolytidae), but is now understood to be a specialized clade of the &quot;true weevil&quot; family (Curculionidae). Although the term &quot;bark beetle&quot; refers to the fact that many species feed in the inner bark (phloem) layer of trees, the subfamily also has many species with other lifestyles, including some that bore into wood, feed in fruit and seeds, or tunnel into herbaceous plants. Well-known species are members of the type genus &quot;Scolytus&quot;, namely the European elm bark beetle &quot;S. multistriatus&quot; and the large elm bark beetle &quot;S. scolytus&quot;, which like the American elm bark beetle &quot;Hylurgopinus rufipes&quot;, transmit Dutch elm disease fungi (&quot;Ophiostoma&quot;). The mountain pine beetle &quot;Dendroctonus ponderosae&quot;, southern pine beetle &quot;Dendroctonus frontalis&quot;, and their near relatives are major pests of conifer forests in North America. A similarly aggressive species in Europe is the spruce ips &quot;Ips typographus&quot;. A tiny bark beetle, the coffee berry borer, &quot;Hypothenemus hampei&quot; is a major pest on coffee plantations around the world.

== Life cycle and morphology ==
Bark beetles go through four stages of life: egg, larvae, pupae, and adult, with the time to develop often relying on the species as well as the current temperature. While there is variation among species, generally adults first bore into a tree and lay their eggs in the phloem of the tree. This usually occurs in mid to late summer. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae then live in the tree, feeding on the living tissues below the bark, often leading to death of the tree if enough larvae are present. At the end of the larval stage, chambers are usually constructed for the pupae to overwinter until they are ready to emerge as an adult.

Bark beetles are distinct in their morphology due to their small size and cylindrical shape. Bark beetles also have small appendages, with antennae that can be folded into the body and large mandibles to aid in the excavation of woody tissue. The legs of most bark beetles are very short and can be retracted or folded into the body. The combination of their shape and appendages greatly helps in the excavation of woody tissue. The eyes are also flattened and hypothesized to help see in low-light conditions.

==Description and ecology==
Bark beetles feed and breed between the bark and the wood of various tree species. While some species, such as the mountain pine beetle (&quot;Dendroctonus ponderosae&quot;), do attack living trees, many bark beetle species feed on weakened, dying, or dead spruce, fir, and hemlock. Most restrict their breeding area to one part of the tree: twig, branch, stem, or root collar. Some breed in trees of only one species, while others in numerous species of tree. In undisturbed forests, bark beetles serve the purpose of hastening the recycling and decomposition of dead and dying wood and renewing the forest. However, a few species are aggressive and can develop large populations that invade and kill healthy trees and are therefore known as pests.

Bark beetles often attack trees that are already weakened by disease, overcrowding, conspecific beetles, or physical damage. In defense, healthier trees may produce sap, resin or latex, which often contains a number of insecticidal and fungicidal compounds that can kill, injure, or immobilize attacking insects. Sap is one of the first lines of defense of pines against bark beetles. Released sap or resins can plug bored holes of bark beetles and seal wounds. Resins also trap insect pests making some initial entry by bark beetles unsuccessful. Chemical compounds can also be induced by tree species that bind with amino acids in the gut of bark beetles, reducing their ability to process woody materials. When in large quantities, the sheer number of beetles can overwhelm the tree&#x27;s defenses with resulting impacts on the lumber industry, water quality, fish and wildlife, and property values.

The oldest known member of the group is &quot;Cylindrobrotus&quot; from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) aged Lebanese amber. A species of the extant mostly Neotropical genus &quot;Microborus&quot; is also known from the Cenomanian aged Burmese amber of Myanmar.

=== Prey relationships ===
Bark beetles are preyed upon by birds such as woodpeckers, other beetles such as the black-bellied clerid (&quot;Enoclerus lecontei&quot;) and certain other members of family Cleridae, flies such as the long-legged flies (Dolichopodidae), and certain phoretic mites. Phoretic mites use the bark beetle to move from one location to the next, but some of these mite species also prey on the eggs or larvae of the bark beetles or act as parasites.

=== Parasitoids ===
The braconid wasp &quot;Spathius canadensis&quot; is known to parasitize the native elm bark beetle &quot;Hylurgopinus rufipes&quot;.

=== Ambrosia beetles ===
Some bark beetles form a symbiotic relationship with certain Ophiostomatales fungi, and are named &quot;ambrosia beetles&quot;. The ambrosia beetles (such as &quot;Xyleborus&quot;) feed on fungal &quot;gardens&quot; cultivated on woody tissue within the tree. Ambrosia beetles carry the fungal spores in either their gut or special structures, called mycangia, and infect the trees as they attack them. Once a beetle chooses a tree, they release spores of this fungus along tunnels within the tree. These spores grow and eventually produce fruiting structures to be consumed by the beetles. This can allow for ambrosia beetles to indirectly feed from more tree species due to the reliance on the fungi for food and the fungi&#x27;s ability to overcome some of the plant&#x27;s chemical defenses. While the majority of ambrosia beetles infect dead trees, several species will infect trees considered healthy or under stress.

== Biochemistry ==

The bark beetle&#x27;s pheromones, including kairomones, can attract other insects. The pheromones distinguished as kairomones are hormones, pheromones, or allomones of bark beetles, which in turn are used as a locator by insects that are attracted by it, such as flies, which may intend to harm the bark beetle itself. These chemicals interact with pine trees as the bark beetle&#x27;s host, based on the behavioral, physiological, and biochemical effects of monoterpenes.

Monoterpenes are a chemical fragrance that plays a significant role in tree-insect interactions, specifically within pine trees. It is an aggregation pheromone that attracts insects to the plant/ tree host, including the bark beetle. Monoterpenes has also been known to prevent fungal growth and are also toxic to bark beetles at high vapor concentrations. This latter process demonstrates a defense of pines using monoterpenes against the bark beetle.

== Taxonomy ==
There are around 6,000 described species of bark beetles in 246 genera, placed into 26 distinct tribes.

== As invasive species ==
Bark beetles are most commonly recognized by their impact on the lumber industry. Massive outbreaks of mountain pine beetles in western North America after about 2005 have killed millions of acres of forest from New Mexico to British Columbia. Bark beetles enter trees by boring holes in the bark of the tree, sometimes using the lenticels, or the pores plants use for gas exchange, to pass through the bark of the tree. As the larvae consume the inner tissues of the tree, they often consume enough of the phloem to girdle the tree, cutting off the spread of water and nutrients. Ambrosia beetles are also known to aid in the spread of pathogens, such as diseases that can cause cankers, further damaging the trees they infect. Like many other insects, Scolytinae emit pheromones to attract conspecifics, which are thus drawn to trees already colonized by bark beetles. This can result in heavy infestations and eventually death of the tree. Many are also attracted to ethanol produced as a byproduct of microbial growth in the dead woody tissues. Increases in international trade, as well as the use of wood containers for storage, has aided numerous species of bark beetle in spreading across the world. They are also extremely adaptable and able to quickly spread through new environments, as seen in France with eleven different species. Bark beetle infestations are also predicted to increase with global warming, meaning infestations will most likely increase in frequency as temperatures rise. Besides the fact that these rising temperatures provide the optimal conditions for larval growth, the development time that the larvae need to become an adult also drops, from 8–9 weeks to 6–7 weeks. As a third the result of global warming, the breeding season of the bark beetle is extended, meaning that number of generations per year will increase. All these factors contribute to an increasing amount of bark beetles and will thus likely result in an increasing frequency of infestations. In the past, fire has been suggested as potential mechanism for controlling bark beetle populations; however, most studies of wildfire after beetle outbreaks have found no effect of beetle-caused tree mortality on wildfire size or severity.

Bark beetles can also be transporters of different plant pathogens such as cankers. The transport of the pathogens also result in the increase of fungi, mites and nematodes within the tree.

<doc id="1281725" wikidata="Q2896579" url="?curid=1281725" title="Federal Protective Service (United States)">
<text>The Federal Protective Service (FPS) is a federal law enforcement agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It is also &quot;the federal agency charged with protecting and delivering integrated law enforcement and security services to facilities owned or leased by the General Services Administration (GSA)&quot;—over 9,000 buildings—and their occupants.
FPS is a federal law enforcement agency which employs approximately 900 law enforcement officers who receive their initial training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC). FPS provides integrated law enforcement and security services to U.S. federal buildings, courthouses, and other properties administered by the GSA and the DHS.

In support of their mission, FPS contracts with private security firms to provide a further 13,000 armed protective security officers (PSO) providing access control and security response within federal buildings. These PSOs are not federal law enforcement officers but private security employees trained by FPS. FPS also protects non-GSA properties as authorized and carries out various other activities for the promotion of homeland security as the Secretary of Homeland Security may prescribe, to include providing a uniformed police response to National Special Security Events, and national disasters. 

The FPS was a part of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement until October 2009, when it was transferred to the National Protection and Programs Directorate. As part of the NPPD&#x27;s transformation into the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the FPS was further moved to the department&#x27;s Management Directorate.

==Description==
The Federal Protective Service is a branch of the Management Directorate and a component of the DHS, functioning as the police force of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The FPS is responsible for policing, securing and ensuring a safe environment in which federal agencies can conduct their business. The service does this by investigating threats posed against over 9,000 federal facilities nationwide and has personnel deployed at 2,300 of them.

The FPS&#x27;s work focuses directly on the interior security of the nation and the reduction of crimes and potential threats to federal facilities throughout the nation. Uniformed FPS officers/inspectors and special agents respond to calls for assistance, conduct investigations and provide crime prevention tips, as well as assist in emergency planning by the departments and agencies occupying the buildings for which the agency is responsible.

All federal facilities under FPS control receive a thorough building security assessment on a recurring schedule. During this assessment representatives of all agencies in the facility are interviewed to gather information on the specific mission they perform within the facility, and intelligence and crime statistics for the area are reviewed, as are existing security countermeasures. Based on the findings and working with the agencies housed in the facility, security countermeasures are added or adjusted. This allows for tailored security for each individual facility versus a one-size-fits-all approach.

==Role==
===Primary protective services===
* Conducting facility security assessments
* Designing countermeasures for tenant agencies
* Maintaining uniformed law enforcement presence
* Maintaining armed contract security guards
* Performing background suitability checks for contract employees
* Monitoring security alarms via centralized communication centers

===Additional protective services===
* Conducting criminal investigations
* Sharing intelligence among local/state/federal agencies
* Protecting special events
* Working with FEMA to respond to natural disasters
* Offering special operations including K-9 explosive detection
* Training federal tenants in crime prevention and Occupant Emergency Planning

==Training==
Newly hired sworn FPS law enforcement personnel attend a uniform police training program for 13 weeks, followed by FPS add on training for an additional 13 weeks at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center location in Glynco, Georgia. Furthermore, following graduation, new FPS law enforcement officers undergo additional post academy training, as well as career-continuous training, and are assigned to an FPS office in one of eleven regions throughout the country. FPS law enforcement officers also undergo additional training, depending on their assignment to special units within the service.
==History==
The origins of FPS date to 1790 (a year after the US Marshals Service), with the enactment of the Residence Act, authorizing President George Washington to appoint three commissioners to create a federal territory for a permanent seat of federal government. Prior to the formal establishment of Washington &amp; the District of Columbia, commissioners hired six night watchmen to protect designated buildings the government was intended to occupy. FPS traces its origins to the appointment of these six night watchmen.

FPS has resided in a number of different agencies over the years. The act of June 1, 1948, authorized the federal administrator to appoint special policemen for duty in connection with the policing of all buildings owned and occupied by the United States. In 1949, Congress enacted the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, which consolidated real property functions within the newly created GSA. The FPS force, known at the time as the United States Special Police, came under the supervision of the Protection Division of the Public Building Service. In 1971, the Administrator of GSA signed an order formally establishing the Federal Protective Force, later known as FPS, and the Civil Service Commission authorized the special classification title of federal protective officer.

Initially, the main function of FPS was protection, as an integral part of building operations. For the most part, the force held fixed posts and performed duties that would be considered safety functions today, such as: eliminating fire and safety hazards, patrolling buildings, detecting fires, and providing the first line of defense in fighting fires; and answering visitor questions, assisting citizens, rendering first aid, and directing traffic when necessary. By 1960, the mission of FPS had become the first line of defense against bomb threats, bombings, vandalism, mass demonstrations, and violence against Federal buildings.

In 1980, Fidel Castro instigated a wave of emigration from Cuba to the United States using the harbor town of Mariel for debarkation. The thousands of refugees were eventually distributed to military installations in several states (Fort Chaffee, AR, Fort McCoy, WI, Fort Indiantown Gap, PA) and Puerto Rico to await permanent resettlement. The Immigration and Naturalization Service and Border Patrol were understaffed to provide civilian law enforcement officers needed to maintain order within the installations. The Federal Protective Service, then administratively placed under the General Service Administration&#x27;s Public Building Service, was among several federal authorities asked to provide additional on-site officers for the duration of the event. Federal Protective Officers from across the country frequently served in the camps, and also during the riot at Fort Chaffee.
More recently, the role of the FPS officer has undergone further changes. The FPS has shifted its emphasis from the fixed guard post concept of security to a mobile police patrol and response. FPS contracts private security companies to guard fixed posts. FPS officers perform all duties attendant to the normal interpretation of a police officer function including maintaining law and order, preventing or deterring disturbances, and investigating both felonies and misdemeanors. The Civil Service Commission developed standards for FPS applicants, which included background investigations, and physical examinations.

Officers of the Federal Protective Service arrested civil rights movement historian Randy Kryn and 10 others who were protesting in a demonstration at the Kluczynski Federal Building in downtown Chicago during the 1996 Democratic National Convention.

===21st century===
Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, FPS was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security and retained its responsibilities for protecting the buildings, grounds, and property owned, occupied, or secured by the federal government under GSA&#x27;s jurisdiction. In addition to GSA facilities, the Act also provides FPS with the authority to protect properties held by DHS components that were not under GSA jurisdiction. FPS was moved from GSA, Public Building Services, to DHS, effective March 1, 2003. Within DHS, FPS became a part of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). On October 28, 2009, President Barack Obama signed legislation that transferred FPS from ICE to the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Today, FPS is responsible for policing, securing, and ensuring a safe environment in which federal agencies can conduct business by reducing threats posed against approximately 9,000 federal government facilities throughout the United States.


On December 26, 2007, President George W. Bush signed H.R. 2764 Omnibus spending bill into law which included a provision that FPS maintains, by July 31, 2008, not fewer than 1,200 full-time staff and 900 full-time Police Officers, Inspectors, and Special Agents who, while working, are directly engaged on a daily basis protecting and enforcing laws at Federal buildings. This amendment to H.R. 2674 was introduced by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and was successfully included in the bill and signed into law largely due to the efforts of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 918-FPS and the grassroots efforts of its membership.

In March 2008, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, chair of the responsible House of Representatives subcommittee, said, &quot;We&#x27;re seeing the near collapse of the Federal Protective Service&quot;. A GAO report, which included incidents that occurred before H.R. 2764 passed, documented lapses that had occurred on federal government property, including the theft of a trailer of surveillance equipment from an FBI parking deck. A GAO investigator said that budget cuts were causing reduced effectiveness. The service has seen its budget and staff cut since it became a part of the Department of Homeland Security in March 2003.

In 2009, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security issued reports that were highly critical of the Federal Protective Service for relying on low-wage contract personnel to provide security at federal buildings. See GAO-09-0859T and OIG-09-51. Both documented that the contractors lacked the necessary skills or training to handle their duties, which threatened the security of all federal employees and visitors. The GAO report made national headlines in July 2009 as it cited frequent lapses, including failure to prevent investigators from carrying weapons into several key federal installations. It also displayed a photograph of a contract security guard asleep at his guard post.

On October 28, 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama, signed legislation which effectively transferred the Federal Protective Service from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to the National Protection and Programs Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security.

On June 17, 2019, a lone gunman by the name of Brian Issack Clyde opened fire on the Earle Cabell Federal Building and Courthouse in Dallas, Texas. Since FPS officers are charged with protecting federal courthouses, they were present at the shooting. Three FPS officers engaged the shooter, fatally wounding him.

On May 30, 2020, Dave Patrick Underwood, a contract security officer for the Federal Protective Service, was shot and killed in Oakland, California. The attack occurred amid the George Floyd protests, which broke out into unrest in Oakland. Two suspects, one of whom had killed a Santa Cruz County deputy in a subsequent attack on police, were arrested in June; they were found to have had ties to the far-right boogaloo movement.

Starting in July 2020, the Federal Protective Service was the main agency involved in the deployment of federal forces to the city of Portland, Oregon. These forces included many officers from other agencies, but they acted under the jurisdiction of FPS. Their operations centered around the two downtown Portland federal buildings on 3rd Ave, and the ICE building in South Waterfront.

FPS law enforcement personnel derive their law enforcement authority from Section 1315 of Title 40 of the United States Code (40 USC 1315):

==Labor organization==
The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) National Local 918 is the exclusive representative of all bargaining unit eligible Federal Protective Service employees which include non-supervisory Police Officers, Inspectors, Special Agents and support personnel. Citation: AFGE NL#918

==Protective Investigations Program==

The Protective Investigations Program was established in early 2004, to ensure the safety of DHS and FPS protectees and facilities. The objective of the program is to prevent an attack on persons and facilities designated as FPS protectees.

The program integrates the following aspects of the FPS mission: the initial patrol response by FPS uniformed police officers; full investigation by FPS special agents; prosecution by the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office or State Prosecutor&#x27;s Office; physical security enhancements and countermeasures; security briefings and workplace violence seminars administered by FPS law enforcement personnel; suspicious surveillance detection initiatives designed to detect pre-incident indicators of threats to federal employees, facilities and protectees; a monthly Operations Security Bulletin; and protection details for high-ranking officials within DHS. FPS Headquarters developed a Memorandum of Understanding, in collaboration with the U.S. Capitol Police, enabling the two entities to use each other&#x27;s resources to effectively, efficiently and professionally respond to and investigate threats and inappropriate communications directed at members of Congress, their families and staff when outside the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.

FPS collaborates with other components within DHS and has established liaisons with agencies having a protective and investigative mission such as the U.S. Secret Service—National Threat Assessment Center, Social Security Administration (SSA), U.S. Marshals Service, FBI, U.S. Postal Inspection Service and various state and local police agencies throughout the country.

FPS special agents have made arrests and conducted investigations of subjects charged with making inappropriate communications and threats to members of the U.S. Congress (House and Senate) or their staff, the director of Federal Emergency Management Agency, FPS Director, members of the military reserve, SSA, the Department of Veteran Affairs and other federal employees. Many of these investigations resulted in convictions for making threats to do physical harm and threats to bomb federal facilities. FPS special agents investigated threats delivered in person, via telephone, e-mail and U.S. Postal Service mail.

FPS special agents also oversee an outreach program designed to educate the community and tenant agencies and provide them with a point of contact to report suspicious behavior and incidents that threaten FPS protectees, facilities, or visitors.

==Explosive Detection Dog Teams==
The mission of the Explosive Detector Dog (EDD) Teams is the protection of life and property and providing a strong visible and psychological deterrent against criminal and terrorist acts. Prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the FPS had a minimal program of 10 EDD Teams located in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Since that time, the FPS EDD program has expanded to more than 60 teams nationwide.

The EDD Teams conduct routine explosive searches of office areas, vehicles, materials, packages and persons housed in federally owned or leased facilities. The EDD Teams respond to bomb threats and suspicious packages or items and are used to assist in clearing identified areas.

===Deployment===
The FPS EDD Teams are deployed in their area of assignment as well as frequent deployment to National Special Security Events such as the Olympic games, the Republican and Democratic National Conventions, and the G-8 Summit. The EDD Teams provide their vital capabilities to state and local law enforcement authorities under emergency conditions when local EDD Teams are unavailable.

===Training===
The FPS Canine Training Academy is located in San Antonio, Texas, and is conducted in partnership with the Transportation Security Administration Canine Detection Training Center. Each handler and respective canine attends the mandatory 12-week EDD Handler Training Course. The handlers and their canine partners graduate from the course as a team.

The EDD Teams are on call 24 hours a day and serve a crucial role as part of a greater network of first responders in a growing national network of federal task force officers.

==Hazardous Response Program==
The FPS Hazardous Response Program (HRP) was created to support the mission of FPS in response to credible chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRNE) threats or incidents.

HRP includes initial investigations of suspicious or threatening CBRNE incidents; completion of CBRNE threat assessments; confirmations of unauthorized presence of CBRNE agents and materials; and the conduction of emergency operations. HRP also provides: evacuation support during CBRNE incidents and some training assistance. The program is compliant with OSHA and NFPA guidance and regulations. The HRP consists of five main elements: Awareness, Prevention, Preparedness, Response, and Recovery.

==Mega Centers==
In 2000, FPS transitioned all alarm monitoring and dispatching capabilities from several regional control centers to four MegaCenters. Currently, each MegaCenter monitors multiple types of alarm systems, closed-circuit television, and wireless dispatch communications within federal facilities throughout the entire nation. The centers located in Battle Creek, Michigan; Denver, Colorado; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, are equipped with state-of-the-art communication systems and in operation 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

<doc id="1281728" wikidata="Q140486" url="?curid=1281728" title="Ukrainian Association of Football">
<text>The Ukrainian Football Association ( ; UAF) is the governing body of football in Ukraine. Before 2019, it was known as the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU; ). As a subject of the International Olympic Movement, UAF is a member of the National Olympic Committee of Ukraine. UAF is also member of international football organizations such as UEFA and FIFA.

The Ukrainian Football Association governs all sport events and organizations associated with the game of football including irregular competitions of beach football, mini-football, street football and others. Its main features include football competitions including the Ukrainian Professional League, the Ukrainian Cup, the Amatory, the competitions among the youth (under-18), and also the Ukraine national football team. It also sets the regulations to the Premier League and the Professional Football League.

It is headquartered in the national capital, Kyiv near the Olimpiyskiy National Sports Complex at the House of Football.

The organization was established in 1991. Between 1932 and 1991 with the Football Federation of the Soviet Union there existed its direct predecessor, Football Federation of Ukraine (Ukrainian SSR). The Soviet federation of Ukraine also conducted own championship, cup competitions, competitions among amateur teams (collectives of physical culture), as well as had own national team which participated exclusively in Soviet competitions such as the Spartakiad of Peoples of the USSR.

==History==

===Organizations&#x27; names===
* All-Ukrainian Football Union (1918)
* Football Section of the Ukrainian SSR (1932–1959)
* Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR (1959–1991)
* Football Federation of Ukraine (1991– May 2019)
* Ukrainian Football Association (May 2019 – present)
====First steps in football sport administration====
The first governing body was created in summer of 1918 in Kharkiv as All-Ukrainian Football Union by its constituent assembly. The chairman of the Union became V. Agiton, while a secreatary-treasurer – B. Shifrin.

After the Bolshevik&#x27;s occupation, in 1932 there was created the All-Ukrainian Football Section in Kharkiv and was part of the Ukrainian Council of Physical Culture that administered all types of sports. The first elected president was a Kharkiv football referee Oleksandr Yakovych Levitin who published a book &quot;Game rules of football in questions and answers&quot; (). In 1934 after the capital of the Ukrainian SSR was transferred from Kharkiv to Kyiv, there was moved the Council of Physical Culture along with its football section. Levitin was replaced for not being not really a correct person with another Kharkiv football specialist Ivan Serhiyovych Kosmachov.

On 27 December 1934, on resolution of the All-Union Council of Physical Culture (VSFK) of the Soviet Union, there was established Football-Hockey section as the higher public organization in administration of football in the country and had to help the VSFK. During that period there started a struggle between people&#x27;s commissariats and trade union for the right to lead the physical culture movement. Trade unions started actively create volunteer sports societies (the first were &quot;Spartak&quot; and &quot;Lokomotiv&quot;). However, already in 1936 took place big changes when the VSKF that existed at the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union was liquidated and instead at the Council of People&#x27;s Commissariats (Sovnarkom) was created the All-Union Committee in affairs of Physical Culture and Sports (VKFK) which also contained a department of football and hockey as well as the public Football Section. In Ukraine was created the Ukrainian Committee in affairs of Physical Culture and Sports (UKFK) at the Ukrainian Council of People&#x27;s Commissars and quartered in Kyiv. The committee supervised 15 oblasts committees along with the Committee of Moldavian ASSR quartered in Tiraspol.

At the end of February 1937, at the Ukrainian Committee in affairs of Physical Culture and Sports was established the Football-Hockey Section which in mass media was better known as Football Section. The head of the section was appointed Samuyil Izepilyovych Khavchyn. With the Nazi Germany invasion of the Soviet Union, all Soviet government institutions were evacuated or liquidated. The Football-Hockey Section was reinstated in 1944 and headed by Stepan Dmytrovych Romanenko. In 1946 the VKFK was renamed into the Goskomsport (State Committee in affairs of Physical Culture and Sports) and a similar analogy took place in the Ukrainian SSR. In 1946 there took place a huge event when the Football-Hockey Section of Goskomsport of the Soviet Union was finally admitted to FIFA. In 1947 the Football Section separated from the Football-Hockey Section. In 1953 the Goskomsport was transferred to the Ministry of Healthcare as the Main Administration of Physical Culture and Sports, but the next year was reinstated once again. Due to such rapid changes, almost none of union republic were able adopt them therefore no changes ever took place at republican level.

In 1954, the Football Section became a founding member of the Union of European Football Associations. Within the Goskomsport, the football department was renamed into the Football Administration. In 1955 to the presidium of Football Section from the Ukrainian SSR was admitted Mykola Balakin.

====Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR====
===Foundation in independent Ukraine===
On 6 March 1991 due to the efforts of Viktor Maksymovych Bannikov was established and legally reformed the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU) as part of the Football Federation of the Soviet Union (FFSU). However, it fully was still controlled and subordinated to the Moscow&#x27;s main governing body.

On 24 August 1991 the Ukrainian parliament (Verkhovna Rada) by its Act of Declaration of Independence of Ukraine expressed its intent of casting away from Soviet Union and creation of a sovereign state – Ukraine. After these events the executive committee of Football Federation of the Ukrainian SSR made the decision to have a plenum in the beginning of December where the future of the growth of the national sport would be defined.

However, until then the following events took place that contribute to a certain degree of confusion.
* In the beginning of the September a joined conference of the governing body of the federation and the national football society took place where it was announces to establish internal institutes which would subordinate to Moscow.
* In October a meeting between Viktor Bannikov and the president UEFA, Lennart Johansson, took place. The president of the European football union promised to fully support Ukraine of joining the European football organization.
About the fact that on the world map appeared a new nation the world society realized on 1 December 1991 after the conduction of the All-national referendum.
After all that, on 13 December in the big hall of the State Committee of Physical Culture and Sport (also later known as Ministry in affairs of the Youth, Sport, and Tourism) the Council of federations in one voice accepted the following declaration:

13 December is the day when the Football Federation of Ukraine was established.

Some time at the end of February 1992 the Agence France-Presse spread information that the FIFA without waiting for its congress granted a status of provisional members to national federations of Ukraine, Georgia, Slovenia, and Croatia. According to its commentary, that was made in order for the associations of those four countries in advance build their relations with football unions of other countries, and their footballers participate in friendlies of national team levels. Soon at address of the Football Federation of Ukraine arrived relevant official documents not only from FIFA, but from UEFA that were signed by general secretaries of those organizations, Sepp Blatter and Gerhard Aigner. In his interview in that regard the FFU first president Viktor Bannikov noted, &quot;The relate to the powers of our federation on implementing of all transferring rights and participation of national and club teams in international competitions. Questions about such powers were placed before the relevant authorities during my stay in Zürich in mid February. On 24 February we sent a request to the FIFA asking for an answer. The returning fax did not make us wait long.&quot;

On 16 February 1992 there kicked off the 1992 Ukrainian Cup which became the first football tournament among professional teams since Ukraine revived its independence. The first round of the 1992 Higher League was scheduled on 6–7 March 1992. On 29 April 1992 the FFU scheduled its first international friendly with the Hungary national football team.

The head coach of the national team was originally planned to appoint Valeriy Lobanovskyi, who at that time headed the UAE national football team. Viktor Bannikov did not fail to inform that to the shores of Persian Gulf was sent an invitation on the address of the Maître of domestic coaching corps, and Lobanovskyi gave a prior agreement. But he will be ready to lead the Ukraine national football team only at the end of the term of current contract, to which at that tie remained about a month. Thereby the first coach of national team had to be picked from the members of coaching council that included Anatoliy Puzach (Dynamo), Yevhen Kucherevskyi (Dnipro), Yevhen Lemeshko (Torpedo), Yukhym Shkolnykov (Bukovyna), Viktor Prokopenko (Chornomorets), and somewhat later they were joined by Valeriy Yaremcheko (Shakhtar).

As mentioned by Yevhen Kotelnykov (vice-president at that time), the Ukrainian diaspora played a key role in helping the federation and the national team in particular from very beginning. It was diaspora that made possible for the national to play games in the United States.

In 1992 the FFU delegation received an invitation to participate in the 48th FIFA Congress that was scheduled to take place in Zürich in the beginning of July. At that forum in particular was to be reviewed an issue of accepting Ukraine and some other newly created countries as permanent members of the International federation. The relevant documents were already reviewed in the FIFA headquarters and approved with minor remarks on some four points. Sometime later arrived a personal invitation for Viktor Bannikov to participate in extraordinary session of the UEFA Executive Committee along with the committee on conducting continental tournaments. It was about granting our country a possibility already in the next season to present one team in each of Eurocups subject to the terms presented by the European Union, creation of own league, availability of appropriate infrastructure to hold games of such levels, ensuring security while they are being held.

In his turn the FFU president offered the International federation not to grant Russia a right automatically inherit the place of CIS national football team in qualification cycle of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and hold an additional tournament between national teams of former Soviet republics for the place in already formed during a draw the Group 5. The proposal was supported by Georgia and Armenia, but from Russians it caused an extremely negative reaction. For example, the RFU general secretary Vladimir Radionov accused the Ukrainian federation in scheming and regarded the idea of such tournament as a legally unreasonable attempt &quot;run ahead of a locomotive&quot;. At the same time those neighbors of Ukraine were convinced that rights of former Union federation must be transferred to them. As the result, so it happened, although until the last moment, particularly the FIFA Executive Committee meeting in Stockholm and the congress, Viktor Bannikov tried to stand his ground.

During the winter of 1995 new elections took place at the 2nd conference and against Bannikov ran former goalkeeper Hennadiy Lysenchuk, but he lost.

At the XXII Congress in Zaporizhzhia, the Football Federation of Ukraine was renamed into the Ukrainian Association of Football. For that decision voted 79 Congress delegates.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===
The association announced the suspension of the Ukrainian Premier League on 24 February 2022, the day of Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

==Structure==

===Main governing institutions===
The main decisions of all-national importance are discussed at the meetings of the Congress of Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU). Congress also elects the president and vice-presidents (presidential cabinet) of federation and confirms several football government bodies such as presidium, executive committee, appellation committee, and others. The congress is more of a legislative body of government and sets goals and directions for the development of football in the country. All official meetings of various football government institutions take place at the &quot;Building of Football&quot; (Budynok futbolu) in Kyiv.

All structural and organizational issues are executed by the Executive Committee (Vykonkom). The executive committee consists of about 30 people and includes the presidential cabinet of federation. To assist the executive committee there exists a presidium which organizes the meetings of the Vykonkom. The presidium composed of 16 people, among which are all the members of the presidential cabinet as well.

===Committees and collective members===
The federation also has two judicial bodies of government: the control disciplinary committee (KDK) and the appellation committee. Those are small committees and are confirmed by the congress of Football Federation of Ukraine.

Aside of the above-mentioned organizations there are numerous other committees and directorates that supplement in the organization of football events in Ukraine. Among the most important are the Committee of professional football, the Committee of national teams, the Committee of referees, the Expert Commission, the Council of a strategic development of professional football, and many others.

There are also collective members of federation that include various public organizations such as regional federation, student associations, independent leagues, travel agencies, others.

==Congresses==
The list of recent congress meetings. Congresses take place every year. Each FFU collective member sends three delegates.

On 18 December 2014, in Kyiv took place the UAF Congress which expressed its vote of no confidence to president Anatoliy Konkov with &quot;aye&quot; 36 out of 47 collective members including 20 regional associations. The general director of FC Hoverla Uzhhorod, Ivan Shits, commented that some &quot;collective members&quot; are organizations of unknown origin.

Following another congress in 2015, the general director of FC Shakhtar Donetsk Serhiy Palkin called it &quot;a fake&quot; explaining that among collective members is a random traveling agency that has as many delegates to the congress as the Ukrainian Premier League.

== Fighting corruption ==
After German weekly news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; published its investigation titled &quot;How did the UEFA payments get to the British Virgin Islands?&quot; the UAF addressed the State Bureau of Investigations, Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office and the Internal Ministry of Ukraine filing a claim that Hryhorii Surkis, former president of the Football Federation of Ukraine, has committed a criminal offence stealing hundreds of millions Euro.

According to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, starting from 1999 (that is for almost 15 years) the UEFA has been transferring the money (in general €380 million) allocated for the Football Federation (now Ukrainian Association of Football) to Newport management Ltd. – an offshore entity.

This company is registered in the British Virgin Islands and, according to the publication, is controlled by Hryhorii Surkis, who had been chairing the FFU from 2000 till 2012, and who&#x27;s been a member of the UEFA executive committee for more than 10 years until February 2019).

In March 2018 at the FFU Executive Committee the FFU first vice-president Oleksandr Bandurko was accused of wasting 2 million euros back in 2003 when he along with Hryhoriy Surkis announced construction of a training center for national team in suburb of Kyiv, Horenychi.

On 19 February 2020 Andriy Pavelko was forced to sign his letter of resignation as a chairman of the FIFA Disciplinary Committee.

In October 2022, owner of FC Rukh Lviv, Hryhoriy Kozlovskyi, accused the UAF president in the collapse of Ukrainian football.

On 29 November 2022 both the UAF president Andriy Pavelko and general secretary Yuriy Zapisotskyi were placed in jail on the order of the Pecherska District Courty of Kyiv City. Their bond was set to 9,880 thousands hryvnias.

On 17 February 2023 the Pechersk District Court of Kyiv City granted the request for removal from office the UAF president Andriy Pavelko. Earlier on 29 November 2022, Mr.Pavelko has been issued arrest by the court in connection with the disappearance of a million euros on a scheme with the construction of a factory of artificial coverings for football fields. Between 2018 and 2020, there were opened 12 criminal proceedings against Pavelko, but none were finalized. Coincidently Pavelko&#x27;s lawyer is &quot;kindred&quot; (godparenting) with Artem Sytnyk (former National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine director).

On 13 March 2023, the Pechersk District Court of Kyiv City extended suspension of the Pavelko&#x27;s powers as a president of UAF. Unlike the previous court order that was adopted earlier in February and later was appealed, the new one was adopted to be executed immediately. Later the suspension for Pavelko was extended by the Shevchenko District Court of Lviv City.

On 9 October 2023, the Zaporizhia Oblast Association of Football requested removal of Anatoliy Demyanenko from the office of UAF first vice-president and appointment of acting UAF general secretary. Soon thereafter two more regional football organizations (Zakarpattia Oblast and Kirovohrad Oblast) supported the request.

The Ukrainian Association of Football posted couple of explanatory articles about its offshore company and its factory in Kramatarosk.

<text>Georges Aleka Damas (18 November 1902 – 4 May 1982) was a Gabonese politician who served as President of the National Assembly of Gabon from April 1964 to April 1975. He also composed Gabon&#x27;s national anthem, &quot;La Concorde&quot;.

==Life and career==
A Mpongwe born in Libreville and educated at the Ecole Montfort, he worked as a bank clerk from 1924 to 1939, then as head bookkeeper for the Compagnie Maritime des Chargeurs Réunis until 1959.

He first came to public attention in 1934, with a series of letters to the &quot;Etoile de l&#x27;AEF&quot; opposing special rights for the &quot;métis&quot;. In 1943, the Free French appointed him to represent Gabon in the governor-general&#x27;s administrative council, a role which lasted until 1946, then from 1948 to 1954 was an advisor to the governor of Gabon. He was also active in the formation of labor unions, the CGT-Force Ouvrière, and in the politics of the territory.

He was elected to the municipal commission of Libreville in 1956, a post he held until 1963, and in 1959 represented Gabon in the Economic and Social Council of the French Community. From 1961 to 1964 he served as ambassador to the European Common Market, to the Benelux countries, and to West Germany.

In April 1964 Damas was elected to the National Assembly of Gabon, and its members selected him as President of the National Assembly, a role in which he served until April 1975. On 29 May 1968 he was named president of the Bureau of the newly formed Gabonese Democratic Party, the country&#x27;s sole legal party, and was later its treasurer-general. His final role before his retirement was as advisor to President Omar Bongo, from April 1975 to 1977.

He was honored on a 90-franc postage stamp of Gabon in 1985, with his portrait in front of the score to &quot;La Concorde&quot;.

<doc id="1281737" wikidata="Q36508" url="?curid=1281737" title="Merya language">
<text>Merya or Meryanic () is an extinct Finno-Ugric language, which was spoken by the Meryans. Merya began to be assimilated by East Slavs when their territory became incorporated into Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 10th century. However some Merya speakers might have even lived in the 18th century. There is also a theory that the word for &quot;Moscow&quot; originates from the Merya language. The Meryan language stretched to the western parts of Vologda Oblast and Moscow.

== Classification ==
There is no general agreement on the relationship of Merya with its neighboring Uralic languages.

* A traditional account places Merya as a member of the Volga-Finnic group, comprising also the Mordvinic and Mari languages. However, Volga Finnic is today considered obsolete.
* T. Semenov and Max Vasmer believed Merya to be a close relative of Mari. Vasmer saw that many Merya toponyms have Mari parallels.
*One hypothesis classifies the Merya as a western branch of the Mari people rather than as a separate tribe. Their ethnonyms are basically identical, &quot;Merya&quot; being a Russian transcription of the Mari self-designation, &quot;Мäрӹ (Märӛ)&quot;. According to , the ethnonym &quot;Merya&quot; in toponyms becomes &quot;Mari&quot; moving to the east.
* Eugene Helimski supposed that the Merya language was part of a &quot;northwest&quot; group of Finno-Ugric, including also Balto-Finnic and Sami. Helimski argued that even though there are Mari parallels, they do not justify a close relationship with Mari and could be due to adjacency of the language areas.
* Gábor Bereczki supposed that the Merya language was a part of the Balto-Finnic group.
*Mordvinian author Aleksandr Sharonov claimed that Merya is an Erzyan dialect; however this is not well supported.

Rahkonen (2013) argues that the likewise unattested and unclassified-within-Uralic Muromian language was a close relative of Merya, perhaps even a dialect of Meryan.

A probable characteristic of the Merya language, which some researchers have noted, is the plural &quot;-k&quot;, as in Hungarian, while most Uralic languages use &quot;-t&quot; for the plural.

== Reconstruction ==
There have been attempts to re-construct Merya based on toponyms, onomastics and words in Russian dialects by O. B. Tkachenko, Arja Ahlqvist and A. K. Matveev among others. The first reconstructions were done in 1985 by O. B. Tkachenko. The latest book about Merya reconstructions was published in 2019. As an example: in Russian toponyms around where Merya was spoken, an ending () is regularly seen in names relating to lakes. This also resembles, but does not exactly match, the words for &#x27;lake&#x27; in western Uralic languages, such as Finnish , Northern Sami , Erzya (&#x27;), Meadow Mari () (from a common proto-form ). From these it can be inferred that likely continues the Meryan word for &#x27;lake&#x27;, which may have had a shape such as 

According to Rahkonen, in Merya areas there is a word , which is probably cognate with the Komi word () &#x27;middle river&#x27;, and similar also to an element which appears in Finnish toponyms. From Merya toponyms it can also be seen that words such as &#x27;down&#x27; (Finnish: ), &#x27;give&#x27; () existed in the Merya language. From this it can be concluded that Finnish corresponds to or in the Merya language. Another thing that can be observed is the Finnish sound &quot;a&quot; corresponding to a Merya &quot;o&quot;, for example a hydronym can be seen, which can be compared to Finnish &#x27;fish&#x27;. In the Muroma-Merya territory a word can be observed, which can be compared to Finnic *ülä ‘upper’.
== Phonology ==
Meryan phonology has been studied only in general terms, relying on Russian dialects in the Kostroma and Yaroslavl regions. Helimski suggests that Merya likely developed massive reduction of word-final syllables. The Merya language only allowed one consonant at the beginning of words, and likely placed stress on the first syllable of the word. It likely did not feature vowel harmony. The vowels /ö/, /ä/ and /y/ likely existed in the Merya language.

<text>The Federal Guard Service of the Russian Federation ( (Federal&#x27;naya sluzhba okhrany Rossiyskoy Federatsii)), also known as the FGS of Russia (), is a federal government agency concerned with the tasks related to the protection of several high-ranking state officials, mandated by the relevant law, including the President of Russia, as well as certain federal properties. It traces its origin to the USSR&#x27;s Ninth Chief Directorate of the KGB and later Presidential Security Service (SBP) led by KGB general Alexander Korzhakov.

On May 27, 1996, the law &quot;On State Protection&quot; reorganized the GUO (Glavnoye Upravlenie Okhrani) into the FSO (Federal Protection Service). Under article 7 of the law, &quot;the President of the Russian Federation, while in office, shall not be allowed to forego state protection.&quot;

FSO includes the Russian Presidential Security Service. The FSO includes an estimated 50,000 troops and controls the Russian nuclear briefcase (Cheget) that can be used in the event of nuclear war. It reportedly uses advanced domestic technical developments.

==Structure and command==
Since May 18, 2000, and until May 26, 2016, the agency was headed by General Evgeny Murov; since May 26, 2016, the head of the service is General Dmitry Kochnev. The FSO has roughly 50,000 uniformed personnel plus several thousand plain-clothed personnel. It controls the Cheget that can be used in the event of a global nuclear war. It also operates a secure communications system for senior government officials. The FSO is a powerful institution with a range of rights and powers, including the right to conduct searches and surveillance without warrants, make arrests, and give orders to other state agencies.

The FSO is organized into the following services:

* Management (Director, Deputies)
* Presidential Security Service
* Security Service
* Commandant&#x27;s Office of the Moscow Kremlin
** Kremlin Regiment
*** Regiment HQ
*** Presidential Band of the Russian Federation
*** 1st Battalion
*** 2nd Battalion
*** 3rd Battalion
*** Presidential Cavalry Escort Battalion
*** 4th Operational Reserve Battalion
* Special Communications Service of Russia
* Engineering Support Service
* Housekeeping Service
** Special Purpose Garage
* Administrative service
* Security service in the North-West Federal District (St. Petersburg)
* Security service in the Caucasus (Sochi)
* Security service in Crimea (Simferopol)
* Office of central subordination
* Units of the FSO at official residences 
* Office of Special Communications and Information in the Federal Districts
** Centers of special communications and information 
* Special communications centers 
* Educational and research institutions, federal unitary enterprises
** Academy of the Federal Security Service of Russia (Oryol)
* Public Relations Center

One of the FSO units is the Kremlin Regiment. A more recent addition to the FSO infrastructure is the Special Communications Service of Russia (Spetsviaz) which was incorporated as a structural sub unit on August 7, 2004.

<doc id="1281741" wikidata="Q17051962" url="?curid=1281741" title="Réveillon">
<text>A réveillon () is a long dinner held in the evening preceding Christmas Day and New Year&#x27;s Eve. Its name descends from the word &quot;réveil&quot; (meaning &quot;waking&quot;), because participation involves staying awake until morning, as the meal finishes.

The practice is observed in Belgium; France; Brazil; Romania; the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Manitoba, Ontario, Alberta and New Brunswick; the US city of New Orleans; and some other French-speaking places. In Portuguese-speaking countries, it is also a designation for the party preceding New Year&#x27;s Day. In the United States, the &quot;réveillon&quot; tradition is still observed in New Orleans due to the city&#x27;s strong French-Creole heritage, with a number of the city&#x27;s restaurants offering special &quot;réveillon&quot; menus on Christmas Eve. It is also observed by many Franco-American families throughout New England.

The term is first documented in 18th-century France, and was used by the French as a name for the night-long party dinners held by the nobility. Eventually the word began to be used by other courts (amongst them the Portuguese courts) and after the French Revolution it was adopted as a definition of the New Year&#x27;s Eve.

==Food==
The food consumed at &quot;réveillons&quot; is generally exceptional or luxurious. For example, appetizers may include lobster, oysters, escargots or foie gras, etc. One traditional dish is turkey with chestnuts. Réveillons in Quebec will often include some variety of tourtière.

Dessert may consist of a Yule log, known as a &quot;bûche de Noël&quot;. In Provence, the tradition of the thirteen desserts is followed: 13 desserts are served, almost invariably including &quot;pompe à l&#x27;huile&quot; (a flavoured bread), dates, etc.

Quality wine is usually consumed at such dinners, often with champagne or similar sparkling wines as a conclusion.

==Differences==
There are certain traditional differences of character between the Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Day &quot;réveillons&quot;.

Christmas is traditionally a Christian occasion, celebrated within the family, and this family character is retained even among non-believers.

The New Year&#x27;s Eve, or &quot;Saint-Sylvestre&quot;, &quot;réveillon&quot;, on the other hand, is commonly a party with friends, etc. People may also go out to a cabaret show, or watch live relays of such shows on television.

==Name in others countries==
* In Italy, it is called &quot;Cenone di Natale&quot; for Christmas and &quot;Cenone di Capodanno&quot; for New Year. 
* In Poland, it is called &quot;Wigilia&quot; for Christmas.
*In Portugal and Brazil, it is called &quot;Ceia de Natal&quot; for Christmas, and &quot;Ceia de Ano Novo&quot; for New Year. Additionally, the word réveillon (alternatively called &quot;virada do ano&quot; in Brazil) refers nationally to the New Year&#x27;s Eve.
*In Lithuania, it is called &quot;Kūčios&quot; for Christmas.

<text>Helmut Poppendick ( – ) was a Nazi physician in the SS during World War II. After the war he was a defendant in the 1947 Doctors&#x27; Trial and accused of war crimes relating to human experimentation; he was acquitted on these charges, but convicted for his SS membership and sentenced to 10 year imprisonment. He was released in 1951.

== Education and Nazi activities ==
Poppendick studied medicine from 1919 to 1926 in Göttingen, Munich, and Berlin. Poppendick received his medical license on 1 February 1928. Then, he worked for four years as a clinical assistant at the First Medical Clinic of Charité in Berlin. From June 1933 to October 1934 he was the assistant medical director at Virchow Hospital in Berlin.

He was an internist and worked in the Medical Doctorate, as Chief of the Personal Staff of the &quot;Reich&quot; Physician SS and Police.

In 1935, he completed training as an expert for &quot;race hygiene&quot; at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology, Human Genetics and Eugenics. After this, he became the adjutant of the ministerial director Arthur Gütt at the &quot;Reich&quot; Ministry of the Interior. He was also the Chief of Staff at the SS Office for Population Politics and Genetic Health Care, which in 1937 became the SS Main Race and Settlement Office. Poppendick was departmental head and staff leader of the Genealogical Office.

At the beginning of World War II, he was drafted as an adjutant to a medical department of the army and took part in the attack on Belgium, France and the Netherlands. In November 1941, Poppendick was accepted into the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. In 1943, Ernst-Robert Grawitz of the &quot;Reich&quot; Physician SS appointed him to lead his personal staff. Poppendick joined the NSDAP in 1932 (party member No. 998607) and the SS (No. 36345). He reached the rank of &quot;Oberführer&quot; in the SS.

== War crimes, Doctors&#x27; Trial, and release ==
Poppendick was implicated in a series of medical experiments done on concentration camp prisoners, including the medical experiments done in Ravensbrück concentration camp. At the American Military Tribunal No. I on 20 August 1947, he was acquitted from being criminally implicated in medical experiments. However, the court ruled in several instances, there was substantial evidence that Poppendick was aware of illegal human experimentation taking place. Poppendick was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for being a member of the SS, which had been deemed a criminal organization by the International Military Tribunal.

On 31 January 1951, Poppendick&#x27;s sentence was commuted to time served, and he was released from prison the next day. Later on, Poppendick managed to get his medical services paid by insurance, in Oldenburg.

<text>SeaWiFS (Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor) was a satellite-borne sensor designed to collect global ocean biological data. Active from September 1997 to December 2010, its primary mission was to quantify chlorophyll produced by marine phytoplankton (microscopic plants). Many of the objectives have been continued with other projects, such as the Terra MODIS, Aqua MODIS, Sentinel-3, and PACE mission.

==Instrument==

SeaWiFS was the only scientific instrument on GeoEye&#x27;s OrbView-2 (AKA SeaStar) satellite, and was a follow-on experiment to the Coastal Zone Color Scanner on Nimbus 7. Launched August 1, 1997 on an Orbital Sciences Pegasus small air-launched rocket, SeaWiFS began scientific operations on September 18, 1997 and stopped collecting data on December 11, 2010, far exceeding its designed operating period of 5 years. The sensor resolution is 1.1 km (LAC, &quot;Local Area Coverage&quot;) and 4.5 km (GAC, &quot;Global Area Coverage&quot;). The sensor recorded information in the following optical bands:

The instrument was specifically designed to monitor ocean characteristics such as chlorophyll-a concentration and water clarity. It was able to tilt up to 20 degrees to avoid sunlight from the sea surface. This feature is important at equatorial latitudes where glint from sunlight often obscures water colour. SeaWiFS had used the Marine Optical Buoy for vicarious calibration.

The SeaWiFS Mission is an industry/government partnership, with NASA&#x27;s Ocean Biology Processing Group at Goddard Space Flight Center having responsibility for the data collection, processing, calibration, validation, archive and distribution. The current SeaWiFS Project manager is Gene Carl Feldman.

==Chlorophyll estimation==

Chlorophyll concentrations are derived from images of the ocean&#x27;s color. Generally speaking, the greener the water, the more phytoplankton are present in the water, and the higher the chlorophyll concentrations. absorbs more blue and red light than green, with the resulting reflected light changing from blue to green as the amount of chlorophyll in the water increases. Using this knowledge, scientists were able to use ratios of different reflected colors to estimate chlorophyll concentrations. 

Many formulas estimate chlorophyll by comparing the ratio of blue to green light and relating those ratios to known chlorophyll concentrations from the same times and locations as the satellite observations. The color of light is defined by its wavelength, and visible light has wavelengths from 400 to 700 nanometers, progressing from violet (400 nm) to red (700 nm). A typical formula used for SeaWiFS data (termed OC4v4) divides the reflectance of the maximum of several wavelengths (443, 490, or 510 nm) by the reflectance at 550 nm. This roughly equates to a ratio of blue light to green light for two of the numerator wavelengths, and a ratio of two different green wavelengths for the other possible combination.

The reflectance (R) returned by this formula is then plugged into a cubic polynomial that relates the band ratio to chlorophyll.

formula_1

This formula, along with others, was derived empirically using observed chlorophyll concentrations. To facilitate these comparisons, NASA maintains a system of oceanographic and atmospheric data called SeaBASS (SeaWiFS Bio-optical Archive and Storage System). This data archive is used to develop new algorithms and validate satellite data products by matching chlorophyll concentrations measured directly with those estimated remotely from a satellite. These data can also be used to assess atmospheric correction (discussed below) that also can greatly influence chlorophyll concentration calculations.

Numerous chlorophyll algorithms were tested to see which ones best matched chlorophyll globally. Various algorithms perform differently in different environments. Many algorithms estimate chlorophyll concentrations more accurately in deep clear water than in shallow water. In shallow waters reflectance from other pigments, detritus, and the ocean bottom may cause inaccuracies. The stated goals of the SeaWiFS chlorophyll estimates are &quot;… to produce water leaving radiances with an uncertainty of 5% in clear-water regions and concentrations within ±35% over the range of 0.05–50 mg m-3.&quot;. When accuracy is assessed on a global scale, and all observations are grouped together, then this goal is clearly met. Many satellite estimates range from one-third to three times of those directly recorded at sea, though the overall relationship is still quite good. Differences arise when examined by region, though overall the values are still very useful. One pixel may not be particularly accurate, though when averages are taken over larger areas, the values average out and provide a useful and accurate view of the larger patterns. The benefits of chlorophyll data from satellites far outweigh any flaws in their accuracy simply by the spatial and temporal coverage possible. Ship-based measurements of chlorophyll cannot come close to the frequency and spatial coverage provided by satellite data.

==Atmospheric correction==

Light reflected from the sub-surface ocean is called water-leaving radiance and is used to estimate chlorophyll concentrations. However, only about 5–10% of light at the top of the atmosphere is from water-leaving radiance. The remainder of light is reflected from the atmosphere and from aerosols within the atmosphere. In order to estimate chlorophyll concentrations this non-water-leaving radiance must be accounted for. Some light reflected from the ocean, such as from whitecaps and sun glint, must also be removed from chlorophyll calculations since they are representative ocean waves or the angle of the sun instead of the subsurface ocean. The process of removing these components is called atmospheric correction.

A description of the light, or radiance, observed by the satellite&#x27;s sensor can be more formally expressed by the following radiative transfer equation:

formula_2

Where LT(λ) is total radiance at the top of the atmosphere, Lr(λ) is Rayleigh scattering by air molecules, La(λ) is scattering by aerosols in the absence of air, Lra(λ) is interactions between air molecules and aerosols, TLg(λ) is reflections from glint, t(Lf(λ) is reflections from foam, and LW(λ)) is reflections from the subsurface of the water, or the water-leaving radiance. Others may divide radiance into some slightly different components, though in each case the reflectance parameters must be resolved in order to estimate water-leaving radiance and thus chlorophyll concentrations.

==Data products==
Though SeaWiFS was designed primarily to monitor ocean concentrations from space, it also collected many other parameters that are freely available to the public for research and educational purposes. These parameters aside from include reflectance, the diffuse attenuation coefficient, particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration, particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) concentration, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) index, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and normalized fluorescence line height (NFLH). In addition, despite being designed to measure ocean chlorophyll, SeaWiFS also estimates Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which is a measure of photosynthesis on land.

==Data access==

SeaWiFS data are freely accessible from a variety of websites, most of which are government run. The primary location for SeaWiFS data is NASA&#x27;s OceanColor website , which maintains the time series of the entire SeaWiFS mission. The website allows users to browse individual SeaWiFS images based on time and area selections. The website also allows for browsing of different temporal and spatial scales with spatial scales ranging from 4 km to 9 km for mapped data. Data are provided at numerous temporal scales including daily, multiple days (e.g., 3, 8), monthly, and seasonal images, all the way up to composites of the entire mission. Data are also available via ftp and bulk download.

Data can be browsed and retrieved in a variety of formats and levels of processing, with four general levels from unprocessed to modeled output. Level 0 is unprocessed data that is not usually provided to users. Level 1 data are reconstructed but either unprocessed or minimally processed. Level 2 data contain derived geophysical variables, though are not on a uniform space/time grid. Level 3 data contain derived geophysical variables binned or mapped to a uniform grid. Lastly, Level 4 data contain modeled or derived variables such as ocean primary productivity .

Scientists who aim to create calculations of chlorophyll or other parameters that differ from those provided on the OceanColor website would likely use Level 1 or 2 data. This might be done, for example, to calculate parameters for a specific region of the globe, whereas the standard SeaWiFS data products are designed for global accuracy with necessary tradeoffs for specific regions. Scientists who are more interested in relating the standard SeaWiFS outputs to other processes will commonly use Level 3 data, particularly if they do not have the capacity, training, or interest in working with Level 1 or 2 data. Level 4 data may be used for similar research if interested in a modeled product.

==Software==
NASA offers free software designed specifically to work with SeaWiFS data through the ocean color website. This software, entitled SeaDAS (SeaWiFS Data Analysis System), is built for visualization and processing of satellite data and can work with Level 1, 2, and 3 data. Though it was originally designed for SeaWiFS data, its capabilities have since been expanded to work with many other satellite data sources. Other software or programming languages can also be used to read in and work with SeaWiFS data, such as Matlab, IDL, or Python.

==Applications==

Estimating the amount of global or regional chlorophyll, and therefore phytoplankton, has large implications for climate change and fisheries production. Phytoplankton play a huge role in the uptake of the world&#x27;s carbon dioxide, a primary contributor to climate change. A percentage of these phytoplankton sink to ocean floor, effectively taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and sequestering it in the deep ocean for at least a thousand years. Therefore, the degree of primary production from the ocean could play a large role in slowing climate change. Or, if primary production slows, climate change could be accelerated. Some have proposed fertilizing the ocean with iron in order to promote phytoplankton blooms and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Whether these experiments are undertaken or not, estimating chlorophyll concentrations in the world&#x27;s oceans and their role in the ocean&#x27;s biological pump could play a key role in our ability to foresee and adapt to climate change.

Phytoplankton is a key component in the base of the oceanic food chain and oceanographers have hypothesized a link between oceanic chlorophyll and fisheries production for some time. The degree to which phytoplankton relates to marine fish production depends on the number of trophic links in the food chain, and how efficient each link is. Estimates of the number of trophic links and trophic efficiencies from phytoplankton to commercial fisheries have been widely debated, though they have been little substantiated. More recent research suggests that positive relationships between and fisheries production can be modeled and can be very highly correlated when examined on the proper scale. For example, Ware and Thomson (2005) found an r2 of 0.87 between resident fish yield (metric tons km-2) and mean annual concentrations (mg m-3). Others have found the Pacific&#x27;s Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (chlorophyll density of 0.2 mg m-3) to be defining feature in loggerhead turtle distribution.

<doc id="1281753" wikidata="Q726183" url="?curid=1281753" title="Turkish Football Federation">
<text>The Turkish Football Federation (; TFF) is the governing body of association football in Turkey. It was formed on 23 April 1923, and joined FIFA the same year and UEFA in 1962. It organizes the Turkey national football team, the Turkish Football League and the Turkish Cup.

==Governed competitions==
===Leagues===

The Turkish football league system is divided into eight tiers, ranging from the top-tier Süper Lig to local amateur divisions.

===Cups===

The Turkish Cup changed its name to the Federation Cup (Turkish: &quot;Federasyon Kupası&quot;) in the 1980–81 season, then back to Turkish Cup in 1992–93.

==History==
===Hosting bids===

Turkey have bid five times to host the UEFA European Championship.

Turkey submitted a joint bid with Greece for UEFA Euro 2008, which failed. Their bid for UEFA Euro 2012 was also unsuccessful, with the competition going to Poland and Ukraine. The federation also submitted a bid to host UEFA Euro 2016, but UEFA announced that Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. Turkey were also bidding for UEFA Euro 2024, competing against Germany. Germany were announced the hosts. Turkey will host the UEFA Euro 2032, alongside Italy (both previously bid against each other for 2016), given Turkey to finally host a UEFA Euro on their fifth attempt.

Turkey had already hosted the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final, the 2023 UEFA Champions League Final, and the 2009 UEFA Cup Final all played in Istanbul. At the youth-level, they hosted the UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship in 2008, after first hosting the event back in 1993.

===Controversies===
====Non-recognition of past national championships====

The TFF organized a nationwide championship as early as 1924. That year the Turkish Football Championship (Turkish: &quot;Türkiye Futbol Şampiyonası&quot;) was held in order to bring forth a national football champion. The championship format was based on a knockout competition, contested between the winners of each of the country&#x27;s regional leagues. Some years later, in 1937, the first national league called Millî Küme was introduced. The league was held until 1950, one year before the Turkish Football Championship was also abolished.

Even though both competitions were organized by the TFF and were official championships respectively, they are not acknowledged and counted by the very same federation which held them. Until today no official reason or motive was given for the unparalleled and irregular denial. All other football associations in Europe without exception consequently acknowledge their former national championships. The Turkish Federation is the only one with such a stance.

As a result, Ankara Demirspor became the first club to officially demand that the federation acknowledge their championship title won in 1947, but received no answer at all to date. Club president Nuğman Yavuz stated that he contacted the Turkish Federation twice, but the federation did not respond in any way. Similarly, Fenerbahçe also requested proper acknowledgement of these national championship titles, and faced the same unconstructive reaction. Having won a total of nine titles in both former championships, the club demands to have those official titles rightfully acknowledged.

In addition to requesting acknowledgement of the titles, Fenerbahçe&#x27;s kit for the 2023-24 season includes a badge with 5 stars above which can&#x27;t be worn in league matches because it is against the regulations of the federation and they did not give permission to play with them, likely in the hopes that the TFF will recognize their pre-1959 championships, also notably on the club&#x27;s website the 28 championships are listed as if they were official likely as an act of protest against the TFF&#x27;s lack of recognition of the pre-1959 titles.

For instance, Mehmet Demirkol, a renowned sports writer and commentator, stated that Beşiktaş won their 20th championship title overall in the 2016–17 season, not their 15th. Numerous other sports writers, persons of authority, politicians, and officials also openly expressed their opinions on this issue and reinforced the view that the Turkish federation should unambiguously acknowledge and count the former championship titles. Among them is also historian and headmaster of the Galatasaray High School Vahdettin Engin.

According to historians&#x27; analysis of the 2002 Turkish Football Federation Conciliation Board decision, which stated that the Turkish League Championships began before 1959 and the championships before 1959 cannot be left uncounted.

====2023 melee during MKE Ankaragücü-Çaykur Rizespor match====

On 11 December 2023, a melee occurred during a match between MKE Ankaragücü and Çaykur Rizespor, in which fans being invaded the playing field&#x27;s pitch. Six people, including MKE Ankaragucum club President Faruk Koca, were arrested for assaulting a referee. The referee, Halil Umut Meler, was hospitalized following the assault. 

The next day, Koca resigned from MKE Ankaragucu, and the Turkish Football Federation decided to suspend all league games in Turkey indefinitely. Meler, who suffered a minor facial facture and eye injury, was discharged from the hospital on 13 December. The same day, it was announced that the suspension of league games would end on 19 December 2023.

On 14 December 2023, the TFF announced that Koca had been banned permanently for punching Meler. Ankaragücü were fined two million lira (£54,000) and ordered to play five home games without any fans.

Koca stood trial on 9 January 2024 on charges of injuring a public official, threatening an official, and violating a law relating to the prevention of violence in sports. On 11 November, Koca was convicted and sentenced to 3.5 years&#x27; imprisonment.

<doc id="1281756" wikidata="Q5161160" url="?curid=1281756" title="Conjugate vaccine">
<text>A conjugate vaccine is a type of subunit vaccine which combines a weak antigen with a strong antigen as a carrier so that the immune system has a stronger response to the weak antigen.

Vaccines are used to prevent diseases by invoking an immune response to an antigen, part of a bacterium or virus that the immune system recognizes. This is usually accomplished with an attenuated or dead version of a pathogenic bacterium or virus in the vaccine, so that the immune system can recognize the antigen later in life.

Most vaccines contain a single antigen that the body will recognize. However, the antigen of some pathogens does not elicit a strong response from the immune system, so a vaccination against this weak antigen would not protect the person later in life. In this case, a conjugate vaccine is used in order to invoke an immune system response against the weak antigen. In a conjugate vaccine, the weak antigen is covalently attached to a strong antigen, thereby eliciting a stronger immunological response to the weak antigen. Most commonly, the weak antigen is a polysaccharide that is attached to strong protein antigen. However, peptide/protein and protein/protein conjugates have also been developed.

== History ==
The idea of a conjugate vaccine first appeared in experiments involving rabbits in 1927, when the immune response to the &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; type 3 polysaccharide antigen was increased by combining the polysaccharide antigen with a protein carrier. The first conjugate vaccine used in humans became available in 1987. This was the &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type b (Hib) conjugate, which protects against meningitis. The vaccine was soon incorporated with the schedule for infant immunization in the United States. The Hib conjugate vaccine is combined with one of several different carrier proteins, such as the diphtheria toxoid or the tetanus toxoid. Soon after the vaccine was made available the rates of Hib infection dropped, with a decrease of 90.7% between 1987 and 1991. Infection rates diminished even more once the vaccine was made available for infants.

== Technique ==
Vaccines evoke an immune response to an antigen, and the immune system reacts by producing T cells and antibodies. The B memory cells remember the antigen so that if the body encounters it later, antibodies can be produced by B cells to break down the antigen. For bacteria with a polysaccharide coating, the immune response creates B cells independent of T cell stimulation. By conjugating the polysaccharide to a protein carrier, a T cell response can be induced. Normally, polysaccharides by themselves cannot be loaded onto the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of antigen presenting cells (APC) because MHC can only bind peptides. In the case of a conjugate vaccine, the carrier peptide linked to the polysaccharide target antigen is able to be presented on the MHC molecule and the T cell can be activated. This improves the vaccine as T cells stimulate a more vigorous immune response and also promote a more rapid and long-lasting immunologic memory. The conjugation of polysaccharide target antigen to the carrier protein also increases efficiency of the vaccine, as a non conjugated vaccine against the polysaccharide antigen is not effective in young children. The immune systems of young children are not able to recognize the antigen as the polysaccharide covering disguises the antigen. By combining the bacterial polysaccharide with another antigen, the immune system is able to respond.

== Approved conjugate vaccines ==
The most commonly used conjugate vaccine is the Hib conjugate vaccine. Other pathogens that are combined in a conjugate vaccine to increase an immune response are &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; (see pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) and &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; (see meningococcal vaccine), both of which are conjugated to protein carriers like those used in the Hib conjugate vaccine. Both &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot; are similar to Hib in that infection can lead to meningitis.

In 2018, World Health Organization recommended the use of the typhoid conjugate vaccine which may be more effective and prevents typhoid fever in many children under the age of five years.

In 2021, Soberana 02, a conjugate COVID-19 vaccine developed in Cuba, was given emergency use authorisation in Cuba and Iran.

<doc id="1281761" wikidata="Q5707112" url="?curid=1281761" title="The Hellecasters">
<text>The Hellecasters (1998-2002) was an American guitar group composed of prominent session musicians and a core trio of guitarists, Will Ray, John Jorgenson and Jerry Donahue. 
==History==
In 1990, Donohue ran into Ray at the Palomino and proposed that they play a set together at an open-mic session at the same club. Ray suggested that they ask Jorgenson to join them so as to have three-part harmonies. The band&#x27;s name was coined by Jorgenson. 

Michael Nesmith attended the April 1991 show and signed them to his record label. Their first two albums, &quot;The Return of the Hellecasters&quot; and &quot;Escape from Hollywood&quot;, were released by Nesmith&#x27;s Pacific Arts Audio label.

<doc id="1281767" wikidata="Q315527" url="?curid=1281767" title="Hamburg Ravensbrück trials">
<text>The Hamburg Ravensbrück trials were seven trials for war crimes during the Holocaust against camp officials from the Ravensbrück concentration camp that the British authorities held in their occupation zone in Germany in Hamburg after the end of World War II. These trials were heard before a military tribunal; the three to five judges at these trials were British officers, assisted by a lawyer. The defendants included concentration camp personnel of all levels: SS officers, camp doctors, male guards, female guards (&quot;Aufseherinnen&quot;), and a few former prisoner-functionaries who had tortured or mistreated other inmates. In total, 38 defendants were tried in these seven trials; 21 of the defendants were women. One of the defendants died during the trial. Twenty of the defendants received death sentences. One defendant was reprieved while two others committed suicide before they could be executed. The remaining 17 death sentences relating to these trials were carried out on the gallows at Hamelin Prison by British hangman Albert Pierrepoint.

All seven trials took place at the &quot;Curiohaus&quot; in the Hamburg quarter of Rotherbaum.

== First ==
The first Ravensbrück trial was held from December 5, 1946 until February 3, 1947, against 16 Ravensbrück concentration camp staff and officials. All of them were found guilty. One died during trial. The death sentences (except for Salvequart) were carried out on May 2 and 3, 1947.

Percival Treite, a half-British medical doctor at Ravensbrück, was defended by a dozen former female prisoners, including Special Operations Executive agent, Yvonne Baseden, who wrote letters to the court favorable to him. Ex-prisoner Mary Lindell testified in favor of Treite at the trial saying that Treite &quot;was the only man who was human, the only man who looked after the sick people as a doctor should look after them.&quot; The outspoken Lindell also criticized the judge advocate, &quot;who was partial and objectionable, had taken on the cross examination of witnesses himself and prevented other questions from being put which might have been [answered] in favour of the accused.&quot; Nevertheless, Triete was sentenced to death.

Three more defendants, the camp leader, &quot;Lagerkommandant&quot; Fritz Suhren, along with &quot;work leader&quot; Hans Pflaum and &quot;Schneidermeister&quot; Friedrich Opitz (below, see the Second Ravensbrück trial), escaped from prison prior to the first trial. The first two of them were apprehended under assumed names in 1949. They were handed over to French authorities, who were conducting another Ravensbrück trial in Rastatt at that time; both men were sentenced to death in that trial and executed by firing squad on June 12, 1950. Opitz faced trial in November 1947.


== Second ==
In the second Ravensbrück trial, which lasted from November 5 to 27, 1947, the only defendant was Friedrich Opitz age 49, a clothing factory leader in the camp employed there from June 1940 till April 1945. He was recaptured after his earlier escape from prison along with Fritz Suhren and Hans Pflaum (see above). During trial, he was convicted of beating women with truncheons, belts and fists, starving them for missing the quota, keeping them outside in very long roll-calls, and sending them to the gas chamber for (what he called) &quot;being useless&quot;, as well as of kicking at least one Czech female inmate, causing death. He also encouraged his guards to do the same. Opitz received a death sentence, which was carried out on January 26, 1948.

== Third ==
In the third Ravensbrück trial, the so-called &quot;Uckermark trial&quot; which took place from April 14 to 26, 1948, five female camp officials of the satellite Uckermark concentration camp, were indicted for the mistreatment of women and the participation in the selection of women for the gas chamber.

The Uckermark subcamp was located about one mile from the Ravensbrück concentration camp. It was opened in May 1942 as a prison or parallel concentration camp for teenage girls aged 16 to 21 dubbed criminal or &quot;difficult&quot; by the SS. Girls who reached the upper age limit were transferred back to the Ravensbrück women&#x27;s camp. Camp administration was provided by the Ravensbrück main camp. In January 1945, the prison for juveniles was closed although the gassing infrastructure was subsequently used for the extermination of &quot;sick, no longer efficient, and over 52 years old women&quot; from Ravensbrück.
Braach and Toberentz were acquitted because they had worked at &quot;Uckermark&quot; only while it was still a juveniles camp, and there were no Allied women there at that time; the camp was exclusively for German girls, whose fate or treatment was outside the remit of the tribunal.

== Fourth ==
The fourth trial was held from May to June 8, 1948. The accused were all members of the medical staff of the camp at Ravensbrück, including one inmate who had worked as a nurse. The charges again centered on mistreatment, torture, and sending to gas chambers of women of Allied nationality.

== Fifth ==
In the fifth trial, three SS members were accused of having killed Allied inmates. It lasted from June 16 to 29, 1948. The judgments were handed down on July 15.
== Sixth ==
This trial lasted from July 1 to 26, 1948. Both defendants were accused of having mistreated Allied inmates.
== Seventh ==
Finally, six &quot;Aufseherinnen&quot; (female camp wardens) were tried from July 2 to 21, 1948. The charges were mistreatment of inmates of Allied nationality and participation in the selection of inmates for the gas chamber.

<text>Ibn Battuta is a small lunar impact crater on the Mare Fecunditatis, a lunar mare in the eastern part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It lies to the southwest of the crater Lindbergh, and northeast of the prominent Goclenius.

The crater is circular and symmetrical, with a wide interior floor. The sloping inner walls have a slightly higher albedo than the surrounding mare, but the interior floor is the same dark shade as the exterior of the crater. There is a small crater on the floor near the western rim, but otherwise no significant markings.

The mare to the south and west of Ibn Battuta contains a number of ghost crater formations, consisting of crater rims that have been submerged by lava flows and now form ring-shaped projections in the surface. These are best observed under conditions of oblique lighting, when the terminator still lies on or near the Mare Fecunditatis.

This crater was formerly designated Goclenius A before being given its current name by the IAU. It is named after the Moroccan traveller and writer Ibn Battuta.

<text>The Ohio Ballot Board is a committee that writes the official wording of ballot questions submitted statewide to voters in Ohio.

The board consists of the Ohio Secretary of State and four appointed members, no more than two of whom shall be from the same party. One is appointed by the President of the Ohio State Senate, one by the minority leader of the Ohio State Senate, one by the Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives, and one by the minority leader of the Ohio House. Members hold four-year appointments. A vacancy is filled in the same manner as the original appointment and must be filled with a person from the same party as the former member. The Secretary of State is the chairman and has the same vote as each of the other members. Three members of the board are a quorum.

The board prepares information on statewide questions and distributes it through boards of elections and public libraries.

See Ohio Revised Code sections 3505.061 and 3505.062 here. Title 35 of the ORC deals with elections.

The board&#x27;s wording for 2024 Ohio Issue 1 was condemned by the group which initiated the measure, which alleged it was a leading question designed to induce a No vote.

<text>Kirch is a small lunar impact crater in the eastern part of the Mare Imbrium, a large lunar mare in the northwest quadrant of the Moon. It was named after German astronomer Gottfried Kirch. This is a relatively solitary formation with the nearest comparable crater being Piazzi Smyth to the northeast. Notable features in the vicinity are the Montes Spitzbergen mountains to the south and the solitary peak Mons Piton to the east-northeast. Kirch is circular and bowl-shaped, with a dark interior having the same albedo as the surrounding terrain.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Kirch.

Very little is known about the language, but it was probably closely related to the Mordvinic languages Moksha and Erzya. Muromian probably became extinct in the Middle Ages around the 10th century, as the Muromians were assimilated by the Slavs. The Muromian language is unattested, but is assumed to have been Uralic, and has frequently been placed in the Volga-Finnic category.

== Toponymy ==
A. K. Matveyev identified the toponymic area upon Lower Oka and Lower Klyazma, which corresponds with Muroma. According to the toponymy, the Muroma language was close to the Merya language. A few words have been reconstructed in the Muroma language, based on toponyms, such as: &quot;*juga&quot; &#x27;river&#x27;, &quot;*vi̮ksa&quot; ‘river connecting two bodies of water&#x27;, and &quot;*voht(V)&quot; ‘neck of land between two bodies of water’.

<text>An active volcano is a volcano that has erupted during the Holocene (the current geologic epoch that began approximately 11,700 years ago), is currently erupting, or has the potential to erupt in the future. A volcano that is not currently erupting but could erupt in the future is known as a dormant volcano. Volcanoes that will not erupt again are known as extinct volcanoes.

== Overview ==
There are 1,350 potentially active volcanoes around the world, 500 of which have erupted in historical time. Many active volcanoes are located along the Pacific Rim, also known as the Pacific Ring of Fire. An estimated 500 million people live near active volcanoes.

&quot;Historical time&quot; (or recorded history) is another timeframe for &quot;active&quot;. The span of recorded history differs from region to region. In China and the Mediterranean, it reaches back nearly 3,000 years, but in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada, it reaches back less than 300 years, and in Hawaii and New Zealand it is only around 200 years. The incomplete &quot;Catalogue of the Active Volcanoes of the World&quot;, published in parts between 1951 and 1975 by the International Association of Volcanology, uses this definition, by which there are more than 500 active volcanoes. , the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Global Volcanism Program recognizes 560 volcanoes with confirmed historical eruptions.

Countries with the most Holocene volcanoes, according to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Global Volcanism Program ():

# United States: 165
# Japan: 122
# Russia: 117
# Indonesia 117
# Chile: 91

Countries with the most volcanoes active since 1960 ():

# Indonesia: 55
# Japan: 40
# US: 39 (mostly volcanic areas in and around Hawaii, Alaska, and Pacific territories)
# Russia: 27
# Chile: 19
# Papua New Guinea: 13
# Ecuador: 12

As of 2013, the following are considered Earth&#x27;s most active volcanoes:
* Kīlauea, the famous Hawaiian volcano, was in nearly continuous, effusive eruption (in which lava steadily flows onto the ground) between 1983 through 2018, and had the longest-observed lava lake.
* Mount Etna and nearby Stromboli, two Mediterranean volcanoes. 
* Piton de la Fournaise, in Réunion, erupts frequently enough to be a tourist attraction.

, the longest ongoing (but not necessarily continuous) volcanic eruptive phases are:
* Mount Yasur, 111 years
* Mount Etna, 110 years
* Stromboli, 108 years
* Santa María, 101 years
* Sangay, 94 years

Other highly active volcanoes include:

* Mauna Loa in Hawaii is the largest active volcano in the world. Its summit is more than above sea level, and above its base in the sea floor.
* Mount Nyiragongo and its neighbor, Nyamuragira, are Africa&#x27;s most active volcanoes.
* Erta Ale, in the Afar Triangle, has maintained a lava lake since at least 1906.
* Mount Erebus, in Antarctica, has maintained a lava lake since at least 1972.
* Mount Merapi
* Whakaari / White Island, has been in a continuous state of releasing volcanic gas since before European observation in 1769.
* Ol Doinyo Lengai
* Ambrym
* Arenal Volcano
* Pacaya
* Klyuchevskaya Sopka
* Sheveluch

Holocene volcanoes with large populations within :

Michoacan-Guanajuato volcano in Mexico and Tatun Volcanic Group in Taiwan both have more than 5 million people living within of the volcano. Campi Flegrei in Italy and Ilopango in El Salvador both have populations of over 2 million people living within of the volcanoes. Hainan Volcanic Field in China, San Pablo Volcanic Field in the Philippines, Ghegham Volcanic Ridge in Armenia, Dieng Volcanic Complex, in Indonesia, and Auckland Volcanic Field in New Zealand all have over 1 million people living within of each volcano.

<text>The persecution of Christians from 1989 to the present is part of a global pattern of religious persecution. In this era, the persecution of Christians is taking place in Africa, the Americas, Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

The number of anti-Christian persecutions has increased on a global scale, leading the United Kingdom&#x27;s Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to release a report which highlights this trend in 2019. According to this report, the number of countries where Christians face persecution for their faith rose to 144 in 2016. Data collected by the PEW organization between 2007 and 2017 showed that Christians experienced harassment in 144 countries, either by government forces or social groups. The United States compiles an annual report on religious freedom, detailing instances of persecution gathered from U.S. embassies worldwide, in collaboration with various governmental and non-governmental organizations. 

Instances of persecution occur across Africa, with countries like Algeria, Angola, Burkina Faso, and others experiencing varying degrees of religious intolerance and violence against Christians. The Americas, Asia, and the Middle East reported significant instances of persecution, from the destruction of Christian churches in Canada to severe restrictions and violence against Christians in countries like China, North Korea, and Pakistan. The situation in the Middle East is difficult, with former Lebanese President Amine Gemayel stating in 2011 that Christians had become the target of genocide following deadly attacks in Egypt and Iraq. Overall, there has been a global increase in anti-Christian persecutions, with governments and extremist groups imposing restrictions and committing acts of violence against Christians, often under the guise of law enforcement or religious purity.

== Prevalence ==
A July 2019 report, in support of persecuted Christians, released by the UK&#x27;s Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, states that the number of countries where Christians suffer because of their faith, rose from 125 in 2015 to 144 in 2016. The review prepared by the Bishop of Truro, states that in some regions the level and nature of persecution, is arguably coming close to meeting the International definition of genocide, according to the Genocide Convention, adopted by the United Nations. 

Between 2007 and 2017, the PEW organization found that &quot;Christians experienced harassment by governments or social groups in 144 countries.&quot; The United States submits an annual report on religious freedom to Congress, also containing data on religious persecution, that it has collected from U.S. embassies around the world in collaboration with the Office of International Religious Freedom and other relevant U.S. government and non-governmental institutions. The data is listed by country and is available online.

==Africa==
There are 54 countries in Africa, with many, but not all, experiencing some type of religious persecution.

===Algeria===
In Algeria, the official religion is Sunni Islam, and &quot;those engaged in religious practice other than Sunni Islam, including Ahmadi Muslims, reported that they had experienced threats and intolerance. The police charged five Christians from Bouira Province with &#x27;inciting a Muslim to change his religion&#x27; and &#x27;performing religious worship in an unauthorized place.&#x27; In March 2018 a court in Tiaret convicted and fined two Christian brothers for carrying more than 50 Bibles in their car. In May another court convicted a church leader and another Christian of proselytizing, sentenced them to three months in prison, and fined them 100,000 dinars. Authorities closed eight churches and a nursery associated with the Protestant Church of Algeria (EPA). Media outlets reported vandalism of two Christian cemeteries.&quot;

===Angola===
In Angola, about two-fifths of the population is Roman Catholic, two-fifths is Protestant, and some one-tenth adheres to traditional beliefs or other religions. All religious groups are required to register with the government in order to operate legally. In October 2018, the government required all unregistered religious groups to submit registration documents; 94 submitted their files. On 6 November, the government launched a nationwide law enforcement campaign against which included closing down unlicensed associations. The operation closed more than 900 houses of worship, including eight mosques.

===Burkina Faso===
In Burkina Faso society is religiously diverse with a 60.5% Muslim majority. A number of terrorist groups operated in the country throughout the year of 2018. In April they kidnapped a public schoolteacher in the Sahel Region, because &quot;French is the language of infidels and all education should be conducted in Arabic.&quot; In September they burned and vandalized several schools and teachers&#x27; houses in the East Region, warning against secular teaching. They kidnapped a Catholic catechist and a Christian pastor in the Sahel Region in May and June. In September unidentified individuals vandalized a Catholic church, removing the heads of religious statues in the southwest area of the country.

===Burundi===
Burundi 2018 &quot;laws regulating nonprofit organizations and religious denominations require them to register with the Ministry of the Interior. Religious groups that do not seek or receive registration may face scrutiny, and at times harassment or prosecution, by government officials and ruling party members.&quot;

===Cameroon===
In Cameroon, Islam, Christianity, and Traditionalist are the three main religions. Religious groups must register with the government but the government has not allowed registrations for eight years. In 2018, religious leaders said security forces killed three clerics, interrupted church services, and prevented people from getting to their places of worship. On 18 January, soldiers reportedly burned down the presbytery of St. Paul&#x27;s Catholic Church, Kwa-Kwa, Southwest Region. During the year, the government suspended church executives who had been elected by their churches and closed places of worship. Boko Haram attacked civilians, invaded churches, burned churches, killed and kidnapped both Muslims and Christians, and stole and destroyed property including private homes. Unidentified gunmen in the Southwest Region killed a local chief in a church and assassinated a priest. Separatists threatened pastors, kidnapped priests, and sometimes limited Christians&#x27; ability to attend services. There were reports that more than 90 students were kidnapped from Presbyterian schools in two incidents in October and November.

===Central African Republic===
In 2018, the Central African Republic is a majority Christian country that is also religiously diverse. In 2018, the government has limited control as the country is mostly controlled by the Christian anti-Balaka and the Muslim ex-Séléka militia forces who occupy territories in the western and northern parts of the country. The police and the gendarmerie (military police) failed to stop or punish killings, physical abuse, religion-based and gender-based violence committed by these militias. Sectarian clashes between the militias and the rest of the population included attacks on churches and mosques and the deaths at those places of worship.

In April and May, a joint government and UN operation to disarm a militia group in Bangui&#x27;s predominantly Muslim PK5 neighborhood sparked violence. On 1 May, militia gunmen attacked and killed one priest, 26 worshipers, and injured more than 100 civilians. The following day, anti-Balaka elements burned two mosques in Bangui. On 15 November, a suspected ex-Seleka militia group set fire to the Catholic cathedral and an adjoining internally displaced person (IDP) camp in the city of Alindao, killing Bishop Blaise Mada and Reverend Delestin Ngouambango and more than 40 civilians.

===Chad===
Chad in 2018 is 51–58% Muslim, 40–45% Christian, with small populations of animists and unaffiliated individuals. During the inauguration of the new government, two Christian ministers refused to swear the required oath of office in the name of Allah; one minister who refused to take any oath in the name of Allah was immediately fired by President Idriss Déby.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
The Democratic Republic of the Congo is approximately 45 percent Roman Catholic, 40 percent Protestant (including evangelicals), 5 percent Church of Jesus Christ on Earth through the Prophet Simon Kimbangu (Kimbanguist), and 5 percent Muslim. International NGOs, media, and religious organizations have reported that the government subjected religious organizations and leaders, most prominently Catholic, to intimidation, arbitrary arrest, and in some cases violence. Due to the political nature of many of the CLC&#x27;s activities and practices; however, it is difficult to establish the government&#x27;s response as being solely based on religious identity.

===Egypt===

According to official estimates, 90% of the population of Egypt are Muslim, with the majority Sunni, and 10% Christian. Sunni Islam is the state religion, but the government also officially recognizes Christianity and Judaism and allows their adherents to publicly practice their religion. According to multiple sources, prosecutors arrested a disproportionate number of Christians for blasphemy and criticizing religion. On 2 November, armed assailants attacked three buses carrying Christian pilgrims to a monastery in Minya in Upper Egypt, killing seven and wounding 19. There were also attacks on Christians and Christian-owned property, as well as on churches in the Upper Egypt region. On 26 May, seven Christians were injured in the village of Shoqaf while defending a church from attack by Muslim villagers.

===Eritrea===
The population of Eritrea is equally divided between the predominantly Christian high plateau (Asmara), and the Muslim lowlands and coast. The government recognizes four officially registered religious groups: the Eritrean Orthodox Church, Sunni Islam, the Roman Catholic Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Eritrea. Unregistered groups can be subjected to additional security service scrutiny. The government appoints the heads of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and the Sunni Islamic community. International NGOs and media reported that members of all religious groups were subjected to government abuses and restrictions. Members of unrecognized religious groups reported instances of imprisonment and deaths in custody, and detention without explanation. NGOs reported the government continued to detain 345 church leaders and officials without charge or trial, while estimates of detained laity ranged from 800 to more than 1,000. Authorities detained 53 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses for conscientious objection.

===Ethiopia===
Ethiopia has 43.5% Ethiopian Orthodox Christians, 33.9% Muslim, 18.6%, Protestants, and 2.6% traditional beliefs population. There is also a small Jewish community and some adherents of the Baháʼí Faith. In January 2018, security forces fired tear-gas on a group of youth singing politically charged messages in Woldia town during Epiphany celebrations. The local Human Rights Council (HRCO) reported that security forces shot and killed eight Orthodox Church members; this was followed by further protests and more killings. On 4 August, in the Somali region, an organized group of Muslim youth reportedly killed six priests and burned down at least eight Ethiopian Orthodox churches during widespread civil unrest in Jijiga. On 25 August, in Bure town, followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church stoned a man to death after accusing him of attempting to set a church on fire.

===Kenya===
Kenya in 2018 is religiously diverse: 47.4% of the total population are varieties of Protestant, 20.6% are Roman Catholic, 11.1 percent are Islamic, and 16% are Baháʼí, Buddhist, Hindu and traditional religionists. Kenya also has the highest number of Quakers of any country in the world, with around 119,285 members. The Eastern Orthodox Church has over 650,000 members making it the third largest Orthodox Church in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Somalia-based terrorist group Harakat al-Shabaab al-Mujahideen (al-Shabaab) carried out attacks in Mandera, Wajir, Garissa, and Lamu Counties saying they had targeted non-Muslims. In September, al-Shabaab reportedly stopped a bus in Lamu County and killed two Christian travelers. In October a group of residents in Bungale, Magarini Sub County, burned and demolished a Good News International Ministries church. There were reports of religiously motivated threats, such as members of Muslim communities threatening individuals who converted from Islam to Christianity. According to religious leaders, some Muslim youths vandalized properties of local Christians.

===Libya===
Sunni Islam is the state religion and sharia is the principal source of legislation. Non-Muslim activity remains curtailed by legal prohibitions. Circulation of non-Islamic religious materials, missionary activity, or speech considered &quot;offensive to Muslims&quot; is prohibited. Multiple international human rights organizations said Christians faced a heightened risk of physical assault, including sexual assault and rape than other migrants and refugees at government detention centers. Some detainees reported they were tortured and abused. Domestic human rights activists continued to report a restrictive environment, especially toward women, imposing restrictions on women&#x27;s dress and movement and punishing men for behavior they deemed un-Islamic. The East operated under a separate, unrecognized governmental administration, with security provided by the Libyan National Army (LNA) and LNA-aligned Salafist armed groups. Militias continued to operate and control territory throughout the country, including in Benghazi, parts of Tripoli, and Derna, where there were numerous reports of armed groups restricting religious practices, enforcing compliance with sharia, and targeting those viewed as violating their standards. According to Open Doors USA, Islamic militant groups and organized crime groups targeted religious minorities, including Christian migrants, converts to Christianity, and foreign residents for physical attacks, sexual assaults, detentions, kidnappings, and killings. Foreign terrorist organizations that included Ansar al-Sharia, al-Qaida in the Maghreb (AQIM), and ISIS continued to operate within the country. In December the Reuters news service reported local authorities said they had exhumed from a mass grave near Sirte the bodies of 34 Ethiopian Christians executed by ISIS in 2015. According to international media, former Muslims faced intense social and economic pressure to renounce their Christian faith and return to Islam.

===Somalia===
Christians in Somalia face persecution associated with the ongoing civil war in that country.
In September 2011 militants sworn to eradicate Christianity from Somalia beheaded two Christian converts. A third Christian convert was beheaded in Mogadishu in early 2012.

===Sudan===
Some interpretations of Muslim law in Sudan refuse to recognize conversions out of Islam, considering apostasy a crime, and refuse to recognize marriages to non-Muslims. Sudan is one of the nations where being a Christian is hardest in the world. Freedom of religion and belief are systematically violated.

== Americas ==

=== Bolivia ===
The Bolivian government has been criticized for not adequately protecting the rights of religious minorities, including Christians, and for failing to prosecute those responsible for attacks. There have been incidents of property damage and theft directed towards Christian organizations and individuals. The country also has a history of religious tolerance and diversity, and many Christians live and worship freely without incident.

===Canada===
In 2021, Christian churches in Canada were subject to numerous acts of arson and vandalism that resulted in the damage and destruction of 68 churches across the country.

Harsha Walia, the executive director of the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, responded to reports of fires at indigenous Catholic parishes with a tweet on June30 that read &quot;burn it all down&quot;. The Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs expressed support for her without mentioning the controversial tweet.

===Chile===
Since 2015, twelve churches have been burned in southern Chile, 10 Catholic ones and two Protestant ones. Attacks were supposedly from the Mapuche indigenous people, who are campaigning to reclaim ancestral lands, according to authorities.

A note declaring &quot;We are going to burn all churches&quot; was found at the ruins of the Christian Union Evangelical church in Ercilla, Chile, after an arson attack on 31 March 2016.

===Cuba===
In Cuba, government regulations are aimed at curbing the growth of Christian house churches.

===Mexico===
Mexico is 83% Catholic, 5% Protestant, with some indigenous persons adhering to indigenous beliefs, 0.5% Jewish and an even smaller number of Muslims and others. In March, authorities in San Miguel Chiptic, Chiapas State, threatened three indigenous families for converting from Catholicism to the Seventh-day Adventist Church and did significant damage to their properties. On 23 May, local police in San Miguel Chiptic arrested two Seventh-day Adventist men for preaching beliefs other than Catholicism. Evangelical Protestant leaders in the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca said local indigenous leaders pressured them to financially support and/or participate in Catholic events, convert or return to Catholicism. In September Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported representatives from Rancheria Yocnajab, located in the Comitan de Dominguez municipality of Chiapas, did not allow the burial of an evangelical Protestant in the community public cemetery because she had not done so. The Catholic Multimedia Center reported that unidentified individuals killed seven priests and kidnapped another. In most cases, attacks on and killings of Catholic priests generally reflect criminal activity rather than religious persecution. In August, the CMC asserted that Mexico was the most violent country for priests in Latin America for the 10th year in a row. In March unidentified individuals detonated two homemade bombs in two Catholic churches in Matamoros, Tamaulipas. Christian Solidarity Worldwide reported unidentified individuals killed four non-Catholic clergy.

==Asia==
===Afghanistan===
In Afghanistan in 2006, Abdul Rahman, a 41-year-old citizen, was charged with rejecting Islam because he converted to Catholicism, a crime which is punishable by death under Sharia law. Under intense pressure from Western governments, he was allowed to leave Afghanistan at the end of March 2006 and since then, he has been living in exile in Italy.
In 2008, the Taliban killed a British charity worker, Gayle Williams, &quot;because she was working for an organization which was preaching Christianity in Afghanistan&quot; even though she was extremely careful and she did not try to convert Afghans to Christianity.

===China===

In the Xi Jinping era, some estimates put the number of Christians in China at 100 million, but it has been claimed in 2019 that 20 million of them faced persecution, including crackdowns, raids and church closures. Claims of persecution of Chinese Christians occurred in both official and unsanctioned churches.

===India===
There have been instances of religious intolerance and persecution of Christians in India, particularly in certain areas of the country. In recent years, there have been reports of violence and discrimination against Christians, as well as forced conversions, mainly by Hindu nationalist groups. The Indian government has been criticized by some international human rights organizations and religious groups for not doing enough to protect the rights of religious minorities, including Christians.

===Indonesia===
Indonesia is the world&#x27;s largest Muslim-majority country, and while the constitution guarantees freedom of religion, there have been instances of religious intolerance and persecution of religious minorities, including Christians. In some areas of the country, particularly in more conservative regions, local laws and regulations have been used to restrict the religious freedom of minority groups. Additionally, there have been incidents of violence and intimidation directed at religious minorities, including Christians, by extremist groups. However, the overall situation varies widely across the country, with some areas being relatively peaceful while others experience significant religious tension.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, although Islam is the official religion, Christianity is tolerated under Article 3 and Article 11 of the Malaysian constitution. But at some point, the spread of Christianity is a particular sore point for the Muslim majority, the Malaysian government has also persecuted Christian groups who were perceived to be attempting to proselytize Muslim audiences. Those showing interest in the Christian faith or other faith practices not considered orthodox by state religious authorities are usually sent either by the police or their family members to state funded &quot;Faith Rehabilitation Centres&quot; () where they are counseled to remain faithful to Islam and some states have provisions for penalties under their respective Shariah legislations for apostasy from Islam.

It has been the practice of the church in Malaysia to not actively proselytize to the Muslim community. Christian literature is required by law to carry a caption &quot;for non-Muslims only&quot;. Article 11(4) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia allows the states to prohibit the propagation of other religions to Muslims, and most (with the exception of Penang, Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territories) have done so. There is no well-researched agreement on the actual number of Malaysian Muslim converts to Christianity in Malaysia. According to the latest population census released by the Malaysian Statistics Department, there are none, according to Ustaz Ridhuan Tee, they are 135 and according to Tan Sri Dr Harussani Zakaria, they are 260,000. See also Status of religious freedom in Malaysia.

There are, however, cases in which a Muslim will adopt the Christian faith without declaring apostasy openly. In effect, they are practicing Christians, but legally Muslims.

===North Korea===

The government of North Korea is officially atheist, and any religious practices are strictly controlled and heavily monitored by the state. Those who are found to be practicing Christianity or any other religion can face severe punishment, including imprisonment, torture, and execution. The government also actively seeks to root out and punish individuals who are suspected of being involved in underground Christian activities. The country is considered as one of the worst places in the world for religious freedom by several human rights and Christian organizations.

===Pakistan===
Christians in Pakistan are a minority, making up 1.6% of the population, and religious minorities are frequently discriminated against. The Pakistan blasphemy law mandates that blasphemy of the Qur&#x27;an is to be punished. Critics of the laws say that Christians like Asia Bibi are sentenced to death with only hearsay for evidence of alleged blasphemy. At least a dozen Christians have been given death sentences, and half a dozen of them have been murdered after being accused of violating blasphemy laws. In 2005, 80 Christians were behind bars due to these laws.

Christians in Pakistan have been murdered in outbreaks of communal violence, such as the 2009 Gojra riots, and they have been targeted by militant groups, with the Peshawar church attack killing 75 Christians in Peshawar in 2013, and the Lahore church bombings killing 15 Christians in 2015. The campaign of violence by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan has been described as a genocide.

===Sri Lanka===

Christians in Sri Lanka are a minority, making up around 7.4% of the population as of the 2011 census. The Christian population faces sporadic outbreaks of violence and hostility by extremists. Churches have been vandalized by mobs organized by supporters of religious nationalist groups, such as Hindu supporters of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Buddhist supporters of Bodu Bala Sena and Islamist supporters of National Thowheeth Jama&#x27;ath.

==Middle East==

Former Lebanese president Amine Gemayel stated in 2011 that Christians had become the target of genocide after dozens of Christians were killed in deadly attacks in Egypt and Iraq.

According to Israeli ambassador to the United States Michael Oren, in the hundred years leading up to 2010 the Middle East&#x27;s Christian population dwindled from 20% to less than 5%. Oren argues that with the exception of Israel, Christians in the Middle East have endured severe political and cultural hardships: in Egypt, Muslim extremists have subjected Coptic Christians with massacres from terrorist attacks, resulting in the exodus of Copts from their homes; in Iraq, 1,000 Christians were killed in Baghdad between the years 2003 and 2012 and 70 churches in the country were burned; in Iran, converts to Christianity face the death penalty and in 2012 Pastor Yousef Nadarkhani was sentenced to death; in Saudi Arabia, private Christian prayer is against the law; in the Gaza Strip, half of the Palestinian Christian population has fled since Hamas seized power in 2007 and Gazan law forbids public displays of crucifixes; in the West Bank, the Christian population has been reduced from 15% to less than 2%.

===Egypt===

In Egypt, the government does not recognize religious conversions from Islam to Christianity. Foreign missionaries are allowed in the country if they restrict their activities to social improvements and refrain from proselytizing. The Coptic Pope Shenouda III was internally exiled in 1981 by President Anwar Sadat, who then chose five Coptic bishops and asked them to choose a new pope. They refused, and in 1985 President Hosni Mubarak restored Pope Shenouda III, who had been accused of fomenting interconfessional strife. Particularly in Upper Egypt, the rise in extremist Islamist groups such as the Gama&#x27;at Islamiya during the 1980s was accompanied by increased attacks on Copts and on Coptic Orthodox churches; these have since declined with the decline of those organizations, but still continue. The police have been accused of siding with the attackers in some of these cases.

In April 2006, one person was killed and twelve injured in simultaneous knife attacks on three Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria.

Since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Egypt&#x27;s Coptic Christians have been the target of increasing opposition and discrimination. In 2011, anti-Christian activity in Egypt included church burnings, protests against the appointment of a Coptic Christian governor in Qena, and deadly confrontations with the Egyptian army. On television Islamists referred to Christians as heretics and said they should be made to pay the jizya tax. A Coptic priest accused Islamists in the country of massacring uninfected pigs predominantly owned by Copts during a swine flu scare: &quot;They killed these innocent pigs just because they thought they violated their religion in some way.&quot; In October 2011 a draft resolution passed by the European Parliament accused Egypt of persecuting the country&#x27;s Christian population. By mid-2012 10,000 Christians had fled the country.

In July 2012, Dahshur&#x27;s entire Christian community, which some estimate to be as many as a hundred families, fled to nearby towns due to sectarian violence. The violence began in a dispute over a badly ironed shirt, which in turn escalated into a fight in which a Christian burned a Muslim to death, which in turn sparked a rampage by angry Muslims, while the police failed to act. At least 16 homes and properties of Christians were pillaged, some were torched, and a church was damaged during the violence.

From 2011 to 2013, more than 150 kidnappings, for ransom, of Christians had been reported in the Minya governorate. 

There is a long-running tension between Christians and Muslims in areas like Minya over whether churches may appear in the village. It is possible, legally speaking, for Christians to get a permit for built churches. However, civilian mobs are liable to attack the building if one&#x27;s house is thought of as an unlicensed or not-yet-licensed church, or if one is thought to be building a new church. Some Muslim villagers see churches as unclean.

In 2016, Egyptian poet Fatima Naoot was convicted of contempt of religion and sentenced to three years in jail for a 2014 Facebook post criticising animal killing during Eid. Four Coptic Christian juveniles were convicted of contempt of religion the next month, with three of them sentenced to five years in prison.

===Iraq and Syria===
The consolidation of power in the hands of Shiite Islamists in Iraq since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime has been detrimental to Iraq&#x27;s Assyrian and Armenian Christian communities. Friction between rival sects in Iraq has frequently resulted in acts of violence against Christians in the country. Consequently, Christians have fled from some areas of Iraq and emigrated to Europe and the United States. Since 2003, hundreds of thousands of Christians have fled from Iraq, and as a result, the Christian population, which may have numbered as high as 1.4 million prior to the Iraq War, has dropped to 500,000, and the number of Christians who are currently living in Iraq is continuing to decline. Between 2003 and 2012, more than 70 churches were bombed. In 2007, Al Qaeda militants killed a young priest in Mosul, and in 2010, gunmen massacred 53 Assyrian Christians in a Baghdad church.

During the Syrian Civil War and its spillover into Iraq, the persecution of Christians by ISIL and other militant groups has been ongoing. The Fall of Mosul and the fall of the Assyrian town of Qaraqosh during the 2014 ISIL advance in Iraq caused the displacement of an estimated 100,000 Assyrian Christian civilians. After the fall of Mosul, ISIL decreed that if the Assyrian Christians who lived in the city did not convert to Islam or pay tribute, they would be executed. ISIL begun marking homes of Christian residents with the letter &quot;nūn&quot; for (&#x27;Christian&#x27;). Thousands of Christians, Yazidis (the latter were only given the choice of conversion or death) and other, mostly Shi&#x27;a Muslims (who ISIL considers apostates) have abandoned their homes and land. One of the cultural heritage sites which was destroyed by ISIL was Mosque of the Prophet Jonah, a site which is considered holy by adherents of all Abrahamic faiths.

===Israel===


In Jerusalem, there have been instances of Christian churches and monasteries being vandalized with spray-painted offensive remarks against Christianity, including death threats. These are believed to be price tag attacks by extremist settlers.

In Tel Aviv in 2008, three teenagers burned hundreds of Christian Bibles.

A number of Ultra-Orthodox/Haredi youth have reportedly spat at Christian clergymen. Archbishop Aris Shirvanian, of Jerusalem&#x27;s Armenian Patriarchate, says he personally has been spat at about 50 times in the past 12 years. The Anti-Defamation League has called on the chief Rabbis to speak out against the interfaith assaults. Father Goosan, Chief Dragoman of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, stated that, &quot;I know there are fanatical Haredi groups that don&#x27;t represent the general public but it&#x27;s still enraging. It all begins with education. It&#x27;s the responsibility of these men&#x27;s yeshiva heads to teach them not to behave this way&quot;. 

In January 2010, Christian leaders, Israeli Foreign ministry staff, representatives of the Jerusalem municipality and the Haredi community met to discuss inter-faith tolerance. The Haredi Community Tribunal of Justice published a statement condemning harassment of Christians, stating that it was a &quot;desecration of God&#x27;s name&quot;. Several events were planned in 2010 by the Orthodox Yedidya congregation to show solidarity with Christians and improve relations between the Haredi and Christian communities of Jerusalem.

In July 2012, a former member of the Knesset, Michael Ben-Ari, who supports Kahanism, videotaped himself tearing up a copy of the New Testament and throwing it in the trash. Ben-Ari referred to it as a &quot;despicable book&quot; that should be &quot;in the dustbin of history&quot;. In response, the American Jewish Committee urged the Knesset to censure Ben-Ari, while a spokesman for Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned Ben-Ari&#x27;s actions.

In 2023, Member of the Knesset Moshe Gafni submitted a bill that would have banned Proselytizing of Christianity in Israel.

===Palestine===
Palestinian Media Watch (PMW) reported that state-controlled Palestinian media frequently demonize religions like Judaism and Christianity. PMW translated into English a children&#x27;s television program aired twice in 2012 it said featured a young girl saying Jews and Christians are &quot;cowardly and despised&quot;.

====West Bank====
In 2002, a mob of Palestinian Muslims burned Christian property in Ramallah. A dossier submitted in 2005 to Church leaders in Jerusalem listed 93 incidents of abuse alleged to have been committed against Palestinian Christians by Muslim extremists and 140 cases of gangs allegedly stealing Christian land in the West Bank. In May 2012 a group of 100 Muslims attacked Taybeh, a Christian village in the West Bank.

====Gaza====
In 2007, the Gaza Strip had a tiny Christian minority of 2,500–3,000. The Hamas overthrow of the Palestinian Authority in Gaza during that year was accompanied by violent attacks against Christians and Christian holy sites by Islamic militants. A Catholic convent and Rosary Sisters school were ransacked, with some Christians blaming Hamas for the attack. In September 2007 Christian anxiety grew after an 80-year-old Christian woman was attacked in her Gaza home by a masked man who robbed her and called her an infidel. That attack was followed less than a month later by a deadly assault on the owner of the only Christian bookstore in Gaza City. Muslim extremists were implicated as being behind the incident. The library of YMCA was bombed in 2008 by gunmen who, according to guards at the site, asked why the guards worked for &quot;infidels&quot;.

In 2011, the Christian population of the Gaza Strip was less than 1,400. A member of the Catholic faith told &quot;The Guardian&quot; he was stopped by a Hamas official and told to remove a wooden crucifix he was wearing.

===Saudi Arabia===
The human rights advocacy group International Christian Concern (ICC) informed the &quot;Christian Post&quot; that in December 2011, 35 Christian Ethiopians – both men and women – were violently arrested in Jeddah while they were holding a prayer meeting in their home. The prisoners stated that they were persecuted on account of their faith and they also stated that they were also pressured to convert to Islam, and the women stated that they were forced to undergo a humiliating strip search. According to ICC, one prisoner said, &quot;The Muslim preacher [that was sent by officials to speak to the prisoners] vilified Christianity, denigrated the Bible and told us that Islam is the only true religion.&quot;

===Turkey===
The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople is still in a difficult position. Turkish law requires the Ecumenical Patriarch to be an ethnic Greek who holds Turkish citizenship since birth, although most members of Turkey&#x27;s Greek minority have been expelled. The state&#x27;s expropriation of church property is an additional difficulty faced by the Church of Constantinople. In November 2007, a 17th-century chapel of &quot;Our Lord&#x27;s Transfiguration&quot; at the Halki seminary was almost totally demolished by the Turkish forestry authority. There was no advance warning given for the demolition work and it was only stopped after appeals were filed by the Ecumenical Patriarch.

The difficulties currently experienced by the Assyrians and Armenian Orthodox minorities in Turkey are the result of an anti-Armenian and anti-Christian attitude which is espoused by ultra-nationalist groups such as the Grey Wolves. According to the Minority Rights Group, the Turkish government recognizes Armenians and Assyrians as minorities but in Turkey, this term is used to denote second-class status.

In February 2006, Father Andrea Santoro was murdered in Trabzon. On 18 April 2007 in the Zirve Publishing House, Malatya, Turkey. Three employees of the Bible publishing house were attacked, tortured and murdered by five Sunni Muslim assailants.

===Yemen===

The Christian presence in Yemen dates back to the fourth century AD when a number of Himyarites embrace Christianity due to the efforts of Theophilos the Indian. Currently, there are no official statistics on their numbers, but they are estimated to be between 3,000 and 25,000 people, and most of them are either refugees or temporary residents. Freedom of worship, conversion from Islam and establishing facilities dedicated for worship are not recognized as rights in the country&#x27;s Constitution and laws. At the same time, Wahabbi activities linked to Al-Islah was being facilitated, financed and encouraged from multiple fronts including the Ministry of Endowments and Guidance, which says that its tasks &quot;to contribute to the development of Islamic awareness and circulation of the publication Education and Islamic morals and consolidation in the life of public and private citizens.&quot;

The Missionaries of Charity founded by Mother Teresa has worked in Aden since 1992, and it has three other centers in Sana&#x27;a, Taiz and Hodeidah. Three Catholic nuns were killed in Hodeidah in 1998, two of them from India and the third from the Philippines. The nuns died at the hands of a member of Al-Islah named Abdullah al-Nashiri, who argued that they were calling Muslims to convert to Christianity. In 2002, three Americans were killed in Baptists Hospital at the hands of another Al-Islah member named Abed Abdul Razak Kamel. Survivors say that the suspect (Al-Islah) was &quot;a political football&quot; who had been raised by Islamists, who talked about it often in mosques and who described hospital workers as &quot;spies&quot;. But they emphasized that these views are only held by a minority of Yemenis. In December 2015, an old Catholic church in Aden was destroyed.

Since the escalation of the Yemeni crisis in March 2015, six priests from John Bosco remained, and twenty workers for charitable missions in the country, described by Pope Francis by the courage to fortitude amid war and conflict. He called the Apostolic Vicar of Southern Arabia to pray for all the oppressed and tortured, expelled from their homes, and killed unjustly. In all cases, regardless of the values and ethics of the warring forces in Yemen on religious freedom, it is proved that the Missionaries of Charity were not active in the field of evangelization according to the testimonies of beneficiaries of its services. On 4 March 2016, Missionaries of Charity operation in Aden was attacked, resulting in 16 deaths.

==Europe==

===Norway===

In June 1992, the Fantoft Stave Church was burnt down. It was a wooden church originally built in 1150 in Fortun and moved to Bergen in 1883. At first the fire was attributed to lightning and electrical failure. In January 1993 Varg Vikernes, also known as &quot;Count Grishnackh&quot;, was interviewed by a local journalist in his apartment decorated with &#x27;Nazi paraphernalia, weapons and Satanic symbols&#x27;. Vikernes, at the time a proponent of White nationalism, social conservatism, survivalism and his &quot;völkisch&quot;-inspired ideology, declared that he wanted to blow up Blitz House and Nidaros Cathedral. He has publicly supported black metal fans burning down eight churches in Norway. He used a photo of the charred remnants of one church taken soon after the fire on his band Burzum&#x27;s EP entitled &quot;Aske&quot; (Norwegian for &#x27;ashes&#x27;). Following his statement, the Norwegian authorities began to clamp down on black metal musicians.

In 1994, Vikernes was found guilty of murder, arson and possession of illegal weapons, including explosives, and given the maximum sentence under Norwegian law of 21 years in prison. He was released in 2009.

The following is a partial list of Norwegian Christian church arsons in 1992 by anti-Christian groups reported by English-language media sources:
*23 May 1992: Storetveit Church in Bergen.
*1 August: Revheim Church in Stavanger.
*21 August: Holmenkollen Chapel in Oslo.
*1 September: Ormøya Church in Oslo.
*13 September: Skjold Church in Vindafjord. Varg Vikernes and Samoth were convicted.
*October: Hauketo Church in Oslo.
*24 December: Åsane Church in Bergen. Varg Vikernes and musician Jørn Inge Tunsberg were convicted.
*25 December: a Methodist church in Sarpsborg. A firefighter was killed while fighting the fire.

=== Russia ===
Many attacks, arsons and acts of vandalism against churches in Russia are reported each year. The acts of vandalism are often accompanied by Satanic symbolism and graffiti. In many instances, icons and crosses are burned and vandalized, and swastikas and Satanic symbols are painted on the walls of churches (while other attacks on churches in Russia are simply robberies). Some of the attacks on the churches, such as the cutting down of crosses, appear to be conducted by groups organized online and by local youth.
