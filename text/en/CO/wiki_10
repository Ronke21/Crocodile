<text>General-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU, or less often GPGP) is the use of a graphics processing unit (GPU), which typically handles computation only for computer graphics, to perform computation in applications traditionally handled by the central processing unit (CPU). The use of multiple video cards in one computer, or large numbers of graphics chips, further parallelizes the already parallel nature of graphics processing.

Essentially, a GPGPU pipeline is a kind of parallel processing between one or more GPUs and CPUs that analyzes data as if it were in image or other graphic form. While GPUs operate at lower frequencies, they typically have many times the number of cores. Thus, GPUs can process far more pictures and graphical data per second than a traditional CPU. Migrating data into graphical form and then using the GPU to scan and analyze it can create a large speedup.

GPGPU pipelines were developed at the beginning of the 21st century for graphics processing (e.g. for better shaders). These pipelines were found to fit scientific computing needs well, and have since been developed in this direction.

The most known GPGPUs are Nvidia Tesla that are used for Nvidia DGX, alongside AMD Instinct and Intel Gaudi.

==History==

In principle, any arbitrary Boolean function, including addition, multiplication, and other mathematical functions, can be built up from a functionally complete set of logic operators. In 1987, Conway&#x27;s Game of Life became one of the first examples of general-purpose computing using an early stream processor called a blitter to invoke a special sequence of logical operations on bit vectors.

General-purpose computing on GPUs became more practical and popular after about 2001, with the advent of both programmable shaders and floating point support on graphics processors. Notably, problems involving matrices and/or vectors especially two-, three-, or four-dimensional vectors were easy to translate to a GPU, which acts with native speed and support on those types. A significant milestone for GPGPU was the year 2003 when two research groups independently discovered GPU-based approaches for the solution of general linear algebra problems on GPUs that ran faster than on CPUs. These early efforts to use GPUs as general-purpose processors required reformulating computational problems in terms of graphics primitives, as supported by the two major APIs for graphics processors, OpenGL and DirectX. This cumbersome translation was obviated by the advent of general-purpose programming languages and APIs such as Sh/RapidMind, Brook and Accelerator.

These were followed by Nvidia&#x27;s CUDA, which allowed programmers to ignore the underlying graphical concepts in favor of more common high-performance computing concepts. Newer, hardware-vendor-independent offerings include Microsoft&#x27;s DirectCompute and Apple/Khronos Group&#x27;s OpenCL. This means that modern GPGPU pipelines can leverage the speed of a GPU without requiring full and explicit conversion of the data to a graphical form.

Mark Harris, the founder of GPGPU.org, claims he coined the term &quot;GPGPU&quot;.

==Implementations==
Any language that allows the code running on the CPU to poll a GPU shader for return values, can create a GPGPU framework. Programming standards for parallel computing include OpenCL (vendor-independent), OpenACC, OpenMP and OpenHMPP. 

, OpenCL is the dominant open general-purpose GPU computing language, and is an open standard defined by the Khronos Group. OpenCL provides a cross-platform GPGPU platform that additionally supports data parallel compute on CPUs. OpenCL is actively supported on Intel, AMD, Nvidia, and ARM platforms. The Khronos Group has also standardised and implemented SYCL, a higher-level programming model for OpenCL as a single-source domain specific embedded language based on pure C++11.

The dominant proprietary framework is Nvidia CUDA. Nvidia launched CUDA in 2006, a software development kit (SDK) and application programming interface (API) that allows using the programming language C to code algorithms for execution on GeForce 8 series and later GPUs.

ROCm, launched in 2016, is AMD&#x27;s open-source response to CUDA. It is, as of 2022, on par with CUDA with regards to features, and still lacking in consumer support.

OpenVIDIA was developed at University of Toronto between 2003–2005, in collaboration with Nvidia.

Altimesh Hybridizer created by Altimesh compiles Common Intermediate Language to CUDA binaries. It supports generics and virtual functions. Debugging and profiling is integrated with Visual Studio and Nsight. It is available as a Visual Studio extension on Visual Studio Marketplace.

Microsoft introduced the DirectCompute GPU computing API, released with the DirectX 11 API.

&quot;&quot;, created by QuantAlea, introduces native GPU computing capabilities for the Microsoft .NET languages F# and C#. Alea GPU also provides a simplified GPU programming model based on GPU parallel-for and parallel aggregate using delegates and automatic memory management.

MATLAB supports GPGPU acceleration using the &quot;Parallel Computing Toolbox&quot; and &quot;MATLAB Distributed Computing Server&quot;, and third-party packages like Jacket.

GPGPU processing is also used to simulate Newtonian physics by physics engines, and commercial implementations include Havok Physics, FX and PhysX, both of which are typically used for computer and video games.

C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism (C++ AMP) is a library that accelerates execution of C++ code by exploiting the data-parallel hardware on GPUs.

===Mobile computers===
Due to a trend of increasing power of mobile GPUs, general-purpose programming became available also on the mobile devices running major mobile operating systems.

Google Android 4.2 enabled running RenderScript code on the mobile device GPU. Renderscript has since been deprecated in favour of first OpenGL compute shaders and later Vulkan Compute. OpenCL is available on many Android devices, but is not officially supported by Android. Apple introduced the proprietary Metal API for iOS applications, able to execute arbitrary code through Apple&#x27;s GPU compute shaders.

==Hardware support==
Computer video cards are produced by various vendors, such as Nvidia, AMD. Cards from such vendors differ on implementing data-format support, such as integer and floating-point formats (32-bit and 64-bit). Microsoft introduced a &quot;Shader Model&quot; standard, to help rank the various features of graphic cards into a simple Shader Model version number (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.).

===Integer numbers===
Pre-DirectX 9 video cards only supported paletted or integer color types. Sometimes another alpha value is added, to be used for transparency. Common formats are:

* 8 bits per pixel – Sometimes palette mode, where each value is an index in a table with the real color value specified in one of the other formats. Sometimes three bits for red, three bits for green, and two bits for blue.
* 16 bits per pixel – Usually the bits are allocated as five bits for red, six bits for green, and five bits for blue.
* 24 bits per pixel – There are eight bits for each of red, green, and blue.
* 32 bits per pixel – There are eight bits for each of red, green, blue, and alpha.

===Floating-point numbers===
For early fixed-function or limited programmability graphics (i.e., up to and including DirectX 8.1-compliant GPUs) this was sufficient because this is also the representation used in displays. This representation does have certain limitations. Given sufficient graphics processing power even graphics programmers would like to use better formats, such as floating point data formats, to obtain effects such as high-dynamic-range imaging. Many GPGPU applications require floating point accuracy, which came with video cards conforming to the DirectX 9 specification.

DirectX 9 Shader Model 2.x suggested the support of two precision types: full and partial precision. Full precision support could either be FP32 or FP24 (floating point 32- or 24-bit per component) or greater, while partial precision was FP16. ATI&#x27;s Radeon R300 series of GPUs supported FP24 precision only in the programmable fragment pipeline (although FP32 was supported in the vertex processors) while Nvidia&#x27;s NV30 series supported both FP16 and FP32; other vendors such as S3 Graphics and XGI supported a mixture of formats up to FP24.

The implementations of floating point on Nvidia GPUs are mostly IEEE compliant; however, this is not true across all vendors. This has implications for correctness which are considered important to some scientific applications. While 64-bit floating point values (double precision float) are commonly available on CPUs, these are not universally supported on GPUs. Some GPU architectures sacrifice IEEE compliance, while others lack double-precision. Efforts have occurred to emulate double-precision floating point values on GPUs; however, the speed tradeoff negates any benefit to offloading the computing onto the GPU in the first place.

===Vectorization===

Most operations on the GPU operate in a vectorized fashion: one operation can be performed on up to four values at once. For example, if one color is to be modulated by another color , the GPU can produce the resulting color in one operation. This functionality is useful in graphics because almost every basic data type is a vector (either 2-, 3-, or 4-dimensional). Examples include vertices, colors, normal vectors, and texture coordinates. Many other applications can put this to good use, and because of their higher performance, vector instructions, termed single instruction, multiple data (SIMD), have long been available on CPUs.

==GPU vs. CPU==
Originally, data was simply passed one-way from a central processing unit (CPU) to a graphics processing unit (GPU), then to a display device. As time progressed, however, it became valuable for GPUs to store at first simple, then complex structures of data to be passed back to the CPU that analyzed an image, or a set of scientific-data represented as a 2D or 3D format that a video card can understand. Because the GPU has access to every draw operation, it can analyze data in these forms quickly, whereas a CPU must poll every pixel or data element much more slowly, as the speed of access between a CPU and its larger pool of random-access memory (or in an even worse case, a hard drive) is slower than GPUs and video cards, which typically contain smaller amounts of more expensive memory that is much faster to access. Transferring the portion of the data set to be actively analyzed to that GPU memory in the form of textures or other easily readable GPU forms results in speed increase. The distinguishing feature of a GPGPU design is the ability to transfer information bidirectionally back from the GPU to the CPU; generally the data throughput in both directions is ideally high, resulting in a multiplier effect on the speed of a specific high-use algorithm. 

GPGPU pipelines may improve efficiency on especially large data sets and/or data containing 2D or 3D imagery. It is used in complex graphics pipelines as well as scientific computing; more so in fields with large data sets like genome mapping, or where two- or three-dimensional analysis is useful especially at present biomolecule analysis, protein study, and other complex organic chemistry. An example of such applications is NVIDIA software suite for genome analysis.

Such pipelines can also vastly improve efficiency in image processing and computer vision, among other fields; as well as parallel processing generally. Some very heavily optimized pipelines have yielded speed increases of several hundred times the original CPU-based pipeline on one high-use task.

A simple example would be a GPU program that collects data about average lighting values as it renders some view from either a camera or a computer graphics program back to the main program on the CPU, so that the CPU can then make adjustments to the overall screen view. A more advanced example might use edge detection to return both numerical information and a processed image representing outlines to a computer vision program controlling, say, a mobile robot. Because the GPU has fast and local hardware access to every pixel or other picture element in an image, it can analyze and average it (for the first example) or apply a Sobel edge filter or other convolution filter (for the second) with much greater speed than a CPU, which typically must access slower random-access memory copies of the graphic in question.

GPGPU is fundamentally a software concept, not a hardware concept; it is a type of algorithm, not a piece of equipment. Specialized equipment designs may, however, even further enhance the efficiency of GPGPU pipelines, which traditionally perform relatively few algorithms on very large amounts of data. Massively parallelized, gigantic-data-level tasks thus may be parallelized even further via specialized setups such as rack computing (many similar, highly tailored machines built into a &quot;rack&quot;), which adds a third layer many computing units each using many CPUs to correspond to many GPUs. Some Bitcoin &quot;miners&quot; used such setups for high-quantity processing.

===Caches===
Historically, CPUs have used hardware-managed caches, but the earlier GPUs only provided software-managed local memories. However, as GPUs are being increasingly used for general-purpose applications, state-of-the-art GPUs are being designed with hardware-managed multi-level caches which have helped the GPUs to move towards mainstream computing. For example, GeForce 200 series GT200 architecture GPUs did not feature an L2 cache, the Fermi GPU has 768 KiB last-level cache, the Kepler GPU has 1.5 MiB last-level cache, the Maxwell GPU has 2 MiB last-level cache, and the Pascal GPU has 4 MiB last-level cache.

===Register file===
GPUs have very large register files, which allow them to reduce context-switching latency. Register file size is also increasing over different GPU generations, e.g., the total register file size on Maxwell (GM200), Pascal and Volta GPUs are 6 MiB, 14 MiB and 20 MiB, respectively. By comparison, the size of a register file on CPUs is small, typically tens or hundreds of kilobytes.

===Energy efficiency===
The high performance of GPUs comes at the cost of high power consumption, which under full load is in fact as much power as the rest of the PC system combined. The maximum power consumption of the Pascal series GPU (Tesla P100) was specified to be 250W.

== Classical GPGPU ==
Before CUDA was published in 2007, GPGPU was &quot;classical&quot; and involved repurposing graphics primitives. A standard structure of such was:

# Load arrays into textures
# Draw a quadrangle
# Apply pixel shaders and textures to quadrangle
# Read out pixel values in the quadrangle as array

More examples are available in part 4 of &quot;GPU Gems 2&quot;.

=== Linear algebra ===
Using GPU for numerical linear algebra began at least in 2001. It had been used for Gauss-Seidel solver, conjugate gradients, etc.

==Stream processing==

GPUs are designed specifically for graphics and thus are very restrictive in operations and programming. Due to their design, GPUs are only effective for problems that can be solved using stream processing and the hardware can only be used in certain ways.

The following discussion referring to vertices, fragments and textures concerns mainly the legacy model of GPGPU programming, where graphics APIs (OpenGL or DirectX) were used to perform general-purpose computation. With the introduction of the CUDA (Nvidia, 2007) and OpenCL (vendor-independent, 2008) general-purpose computing APIs, in new GPGPU codes it is no longer necessary to map the computation to graphics primitives. The stream processing nature of GPUs remains valid regardless of the APIs used. (See e.g.,)

GPUs can only process independent vertices and fragments, but can process many of them in parallel. This is especially effective when the programmer wants to process many vertices or fragments in the same way. In this sense, GPUs are stream processors processors that can operate in parallel by running one kernel on many records in a stream at once.

A &quot;stream&quot; is simply a set of records that require similar computation. Streams provide data parallelism. &quot;Kernels&quot; are the functions that are applied to each element in the stream. In the GPUs, &quot;vertices&quot; and &quot;fragments&quot; are the elements in streams and vertex and fragment shaders are the kernels to be run on them. For each element we can only read from the input, perform operations on it, and write to the output. It is permissible to have multiple inputs and multiple outputs, but never a piece of memory that is both readable and writable.

Arithmetic intensity is defined as the number of operations performed per word of memory transferred. It is important for GPGPU applications to have high arithmetic intensity else the memory access latency will limit computational speedup. 

Ideal GPGPU applications have large data sets, high parallelism, and minimal dependency between data elements.

===GPU programming concepts===

====Computational resources====
There are a variety of computational resources available on the GPU:

* Programmable processors – vertex, primitive, fragment and mainly compute pipelines allow programmer to perform kernel on streams of data
* Rasterizer – creates fragments and interpolates per-vertex constants such as texture coordinates and color
* Texture unit – read-only memory interface
* Framebuffer – write-only memory interface

In fact, a program can substitute a write only texture for output instead of the framebuffer. This is done either through Render to Texture (RTT), Render-To-Backbuffer-Copy-To-Texture (RTBCTT), or the more recent stream-out.

====Textures as stream====
The most common form for a stream to take in GPGPU is a 2D grid because this fits naturally with the rendering model built into GPUs. Many computations naturally map into grids: matrix algebra, image processing, physically based simulation, and so on.
Since textures are used as memory, texture lookups are then used as memory reads. Certain operations can be done automatically by the GPU because of this. 

====Kernels====
Compute kernels can be thought of as the body of loops. For example, a programmer operating on a grid on the CPU might have code that looks like this:

// Input and output grids have 10000 x 10000 or 100 million elements.

void transform_10k_by_10k_grid(float in[10000][10000], float out[10000][10000])
 for (int x = 0; x &lt; 10000; x++) {
 for (int y = 0; y &lt; 10000; y++) {
 // The next line is executed 100 million times
 out[x][y] = do_some_hard_work(in[x][y]);
 }

On the GPU, the programmer only specifies the body of the loop as the kernel and what data to loop over by invoking geometry processing.

====Flow control====
In sequential code it is possible to control the flow of the program using if-then-else statements and various forms of loops. Such flow control structures have only recently been added to GPUs. Conditional writes could be performed using a properly crafted series of arithmetic/bit operations, but looping and conditional branching were not possible.

Recent GPUs allow branching, but usually with a performance penalty. Branching should generally be avoided in inner loops, whether in CPU or GPU code, and various methods, such as static branch resolution, pre-computation, predication, loop splitting, and Z-cull can be used to achieve branching when hardware support does not exist.

===GPU methods===

====Map====

The map operation simply applies the given function (the kernel) to every element in the stream. A simple example is multiplying each value in the stream by a constant (increasing the brightness of an image). The map operation is simple to implement on the GPU. The programmer generates a fragment for each pixel on screen and applies a fragment program to each one. The result stream of the same size is stored in the output buffer.

====Reduce====

Some computations require calculating a smaller stream (possibly a stream of only one element) from a larger stream. This is called a reduction of the stream. Generally, a reduction can be performed in multiple steps. The results from the prior step are used as the input for the current step and the range over which the operation is applied is reduced until only one stream element remains.

====Stream filtering====
Stream filtering is essentially a non-uniform reduction. Filtering involves removing items from the stream based on some criteria.

====Scan====
The scan operation, also termed &quot;parallel prefix sum&quot;, takes in a vector (stream) of data elements and an (arbitrary) associative binary function &#x27;+&#x27; with an identity element &#x27;i&#x27;. If the input is [a0, a1, a2, a3, ...], an &quot;exclusive scan&quot; produces the output [i, a0, a0 + a1, a0 + a1 + a2, ...], while an &quot;inclusive scan&quot; produces the output [a0, a0 + a1, a0 + a1 + a2, a0 + a1 + a2 + a3, ...] and does not require an identity to exist. While at first glance the operation may seem inherently serial, efficient parallel scan algorithms are possible and have been implemented on graphics processing units. The scan operation has uses in e.g., quicksort and sparse matrix-vector multiplication.

====Scatter====
The scatter operation is most naturally defined on the vertex processor. The vertex processor is able to adjust the position of the vertex, which allows the programmer to control where information is deposited on the grid. Other extensions are also possible, such as controlling how large an area the vertex affects.

The fragment processor cannot perform a direct scatter operation because the location of each fragment on the grid is fixed at the time of the fragment&#x27;s creation and cannot be altered by the programmer. However, a logical scatter operation may sometimes be recast or implemented with another gather step. A scatter implementation would first emit both an output value and an output address. An immediately following gather operation uses address comparisons to see whether the output value maps to the current output slot.

In dedicated compute kernels, scatter can be performed by indexed writes.

====Gather====
Gather is the reverse of scatter. After scatter reorders elements according to a map, gather can restore the order of the elements according to the map scatter used. In dedicated compute kernels, gather may be performed by indexed reads. In other shaders, it is performed with texture-lookups.

====Sort====
The sort operation transforms an unordered set of elements into an ordered set of elements. The most common implementation on GPUs is using radix sort for integer and floating point data and coarse-grained merge sort and fine-grained sorting networks for general comparable data.

====Search====
The search operation allows the programmer to find a given element within the stream, or possibly find neighbors of a specified element. Mostly the search method used is binary search on sorted elements.

====Data structures====
A variety of data structures can be represented on the GPU:

* Dense arrays
* Sparse matrices (sparse array) static or dynamic
* Adaptive structures (union type)

<text>Factor IX (), also known as Christmas factor, is one of the serine proteases involved in coagulation; it belongs to peptidase family S1. Deficiency of this protein causes haemophilia B.
It was discovered in 1952 after a young boy named Stephen Christmas was found to be lacking this exact factor, leading to haemophilia. Coagulation factor IX is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

== Physiology ==

Factor IX is produced as a zymogen, an inactive precursor. It is processed to remove the signal peptide, glycosylated and then cleaved by factor XIa (of the contact pathway) or factor VIIa (of the tissue factor pathway) to produce a two-chain form, where the chains are linked by a disulfide bridge. When activated into factor IXa, in the presence of Ca2+, membrane phospholipids, and a Factor VIII cofactor, it hydrolyses one arginine-isoleucine bond in factor X to form factor Xa.

Factor IX is inhibited by antithrombin.

Factor IX expression increases with age in humans and mice. In mouse models, mutations within the promoter region of factor IX have an age-dependent phenotype.

== Domain architecture ==

Factors VII, IX, and X all play key roles in blood coagulation and also share a common domain architecture. The factor IX protein is composed of four protein domains: the Gla domain, two tandem copies of the EGF domain and a C-terminal trypsin-like peptidase domain which carries out the catalytic cleavage.

The N-terminal EGF domain has been shown to at least in part be responsible for binding tissue factor. Wilkinson &quot;et al&quot;. conclude that residues 88 to 109 of the second EGF domain mediate binding to platelets and assembly of the factor X activating complex.

The structures of all four domains have been solved. A structure of the two EGF domains and the trypsin-like domain was determined for the pig protein. The structure of the Gla domain, which is responsible for Ca(II)-dependent phospholipid binding, was also determined by NMR.

Several structures of &#x27;super active&#x27; mutants have been solved, which reveal the nature of factor IX activation by other proteins in the clotting cascade.

== Genetics ==

Because the gene for factor IX is located on the X chromosome (Xq27.1-q27.2), loss-of-function mutations thereof are X-linked recessive: males experience the disease phenotype much more frequently than females. At least 534 disease-causing mutations in this gene have been discovered. The F9 gene was first cloned in 1982 by Kotoku Kurachi and Earl Davie.

Polly, a transgenic cloned Poll Dorset sheep carrying the gene for factor IX, was produced by Dr Ian Wilmut at the Roslin Institute in 1997.

== Role in disease ==





Deficiency of factor IX causes Christmas disease (hemophilia B). Over 3000 variants of factor IX have been described, affecting 73% of the 461 residues; some cause no symptoms, but many lead to a significant bleeding disorder. The original Christmas disease mutation was identified by sequencing of Christmas&#x27; DNA, revealing a mutation which changed a cysteine to a serine.
Recombinant factor IX is used to treat Christmas disease. Formulations include:

* nonacog alfa (brand name Benefix)
* nonacog gamma (brand name Rixubis)
* albutrepenonacog alfa (brand name Idelvion)
* eftrenonacog alfa (brand name Alprolix)
* nonacog beta pegol (brand name Refixia)
* coagulation factor IX [recombinant] (Benefix)
* coagulation factor IX [recombinant] (Idelvion)
* coagulation factor IX (recombinant), Fc fusion protein (Alprolix)
* coagulation factor IX [recombinant] (Ixinity)
* coagulation factor IX [recombinant] (Rebinyn)
* coagulation factor IX [recombinant] (Rixubis)
* coagulation factor IX (human) (Alphanine SD)

Some rare mutations of factor IX result in elevated clotting activity, and can result in clotting diseases, such as deep vein thrombosis. This gain of function mutation renders the protein hyperfunctional and is associated with familial early-onset thrombophilia.

Factor IX deficiency is treated by injection of purified factor IX produced through cloning in various animal or animal cell vectors. Tranexamic acid may be of value in patients undergoing surgery who have inherited factor IX deficiency in order to reduce the perioperative risk of bleeding.

A list of all the mutations in Factor IX is compiled and maintained by EAHAD.

Coagulation factor IX is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

<doc id="1268944" wikidata="Q4785678" url="?curid=1268944" title="Primate of New Zealand">
<text>Primate of New Zealand is a title held by a bishop who leads the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia. Since 2006, the Senior Bishop of each &quot;tikanga&quot; (Māori, Pākehā, Pasefika) serves automatically as one of three co-equal Primates-and-Archbishops. Previously, one of these three would be Presiding Bishop and the other two Co-Presiding Bishops; and before that there was only one Primate.

==Bishop and Metropolitan==
George Selwyn was consecrated Bishop of New Zealand on 17 October 1841: he was the sole bishop over a very large territory, including all New Zealand and very many South Pacific islands. In his lifetime, as the Anglican ministry in New Zealand grew, that one diocese was divided several times: by letters patent dated 22 September 1858, Selwyn was made metropolitan bishop over the other dioceses and called Bishop of New Zealand and Metropolitan. By 1868, New Zealand had seven dioceses, Selwyn had come to be referred to as &quot;the Primate&quot;, and the General Synod constitution as amended that year used this term.

==Primate and Metropolitan==
At the same Synod, Selwyn having announced his intention to resign, a Statute was adopted for the election of the Primate (and Metropolitan) from among the bishops diocesan (who retained their See) and Harper, Bishop of Christchurch was so elected (to take office upon Selwyn&#x27;s resignation). The same statute created the role of Senior Bishop — being the bishop consecrated first (excluding any former primate), and Acting Primate in certain circumstances. Primates of this era occasionally used the style Archbishop of New Zealand; and gained the archiepiscopal style &quot;the Most Reverend&quot; between the 5th General Synod (1871) and the 6th (1874). An attempt was made in the 21st Synod (1919) to make the Bishop of Wellington &quot;ex officio&quot; Primate and Metropolitan; this failed in the 22nd Synod (1922), which did, however, amend the Canons and officially grant the title Primate and Archbishop of New Zealand.
==Primate and Archbishop==
Throughout the 20th century, the church in New Zealand developed an understanding for the different cultures within it. In 1925, the Diocese of Polynesia began as a missionary diocese of the church. In 1928, the first Bishop of Aotearoa, ministering to the Māori, was consecrated as suffragan bishop to the Bishop of Waiapu. In the 1970s, Melanesia became a separate ecclesiastical province from New Zealand, and the Bishop of Aotearoa became a full-ranking diocesan, with a diocese covering all of New Zealand. Under the primacy of Brian Davis, Polynesia became a fully-fledged diocese and a review of church structures was begun.

In 1992, the General Synod of the church set up five &quot;hui amorangi&quot;, or regional bishoprics, to serve under the Bishop of Aotearoa. The Church of the Province of New Zealand also adopted its current name, the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, to demonstrate its ownership by the three &quot;tikanga&quot;. The same Synod limited the Primate to a ten-year term, with re-election to one further four-year term.
==Primate with Co-Presiding Bishops==
The 53rd General Synod (1998) reduced the Primate&#x27;s term from five General Synods (i.e. 10 years) to three (i.e. 6 years); removed the additional style &quot;Archbishop&quot; from the Primacy in favour of &quot;Presiding Bishop&quot;; and conferred the style &quot;Co-Presiding Bishops / nga Pīhopa Aporei&quot; on the Senior Bishops of the two &quot;tikanga&quot; besides the Primate&#x27;s, while enjoining them to work closely with the Primate / te Pīhopa Mātāmua and Presiding Bishop.

The 2004 General Synod passed a further Primacy statute which: reinstated the honorific &quot;Archbishop&quot; (removing &quot;Presiding Bishop&quot;) to the Primate; required the elected Primate to resign their other See(s); and, anticipating the coming changes, limited the next Primate&#x27;s term to two years (renewable once). Whakahuihui Vercoe duly stepped down at the end of that two-year term as Primate in 2006, when the church decided that three bishops shall share the position and style of archbishop, each representing one of the three &quot;tikanga&quot;, or cultural streams of the church: Te Pīhopatanga o Aotearoa (the Bishopric of Aotearoa, serving Māori), the Dioceses in New Zealand (serving Pākehā), and the Diocese of Polynesia.
==Shared Primacy==
Further changes to the office of primate were its limitation to a two-year term, to allow for greater participation in leadership, and its establishment as a triumvirate of bishops. For the transitional period between the decision at 2006 General Synod and the completion of the necessary legislation, Turei was Primate and Archbishop, and Moxon and Bryce his Co-Presiding Bishops; but they began to act as if co-equal primates, including use of &quot;Archbishop&quot; and &quot;the Most Reverend&quot;. Since 2008, Te Pīhopa o Aotearoa, the diocesan Bishop of Polynesia and the Senior Bishop of the New Zealand (i.e. tikanga Pākehā) Dioceses have each — co-equally — been &quot;ex officio&quot; Primate and Archbishop; each one is elected by a body representing their whole tikanga. Te Hīnota Whānui/General Synod 2020 reaffirmed the three-tikanga and co-primacy arrangements.

<text>Prince Maurits Willem Pieter Hendrik of Orange-Nassau, van Vollenhoven (born 17 April 1968) is a member of the Dutch royal family as the eldest son of Princess Margriet of the Netherlands and Pieter van Vollenhoven.

Before the succession of his cousin Willem-Alexander as King, he was a member of the Dutch Royal House and tenth in the line of succession to the Dutch throne. With Willem-Alexander&#x27;s succession however, he is no longer a member of the Dutch Royal House, and is no longer in line to direct succession to the Dutch throne.

==Life and career==
Maurits was born on 17 April 1968. His godparents are Princess Christina of the Netherlands, Prince Alois-Konstantin of Lowenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, Jhr. G. Krayenhof, and The Dutch Merchant Fleet. Van Vollenhoven has three brothers: Bernhard, Pieter-Christiaan, Floris.

In 1987, van Vollenhoven performed military service with the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps and the Royal Netherlands Navy. He graduated at University of Groningen in 1995, where he obtained a MSc degree in Economics. After his study he worked for the Schiphol Airport Authority, where he occupied several positions, including Senior Manager of Passenger Services. From September 2001 to May 2006, the prince worked for Philips (Domestic Appliances and Personal Care) in Amersfoort, where he was in charge of part of the Philishave portfolio.

In May 2006, van Vollenhoven started his own business, The Source, which focuses on innovative concepts for products, services and systems for both business and government. Since 1 May 2013, Maurits is Aide-de-camp to King Willem-Alexander and promoted to the rank of Commander (Dutch: Kapitein-lieutenant ter Zee) in the Royal Netherlands Navy.

Maurits works for Sunrock, a company which invests in solar parks and green energy. In April 2023, he gave an exceptional interview to writer Kemal Rijken at the Amsterdam television channel AT5. The prince criticised the solar energy policy of the municipality of Amsterdam and opened up about other topics.

==Marriage and family==
In 1989, van Vollenhoven met Marilène (Marie-Helène) van den Broek b. 4 February 1970, the youngest daughter of Hans van den Broek and Josee van Schendel. Their civil marriage ceremony was in Apeldoorn on 29 May 1998, followed by a religious ceremony on 30 May. He was the first grandchild of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands who married.

Together, the couple has three children: 
* Anastasia (&quot;Anna&quot;) Margriet Joséphine van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven (Amsterdam, 15 April 2001) - the first legitimate great-grandchild of Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard,
* &quot;Lucas&quot; Maurits Pieter Henri van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven (Amsterdam, 26 October 2002), 
* &quot;Felicia&quot; Juliana Bénedicte Barbara van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven (Amsterdam, 31 May 2005). 
By Royal Decree of 26 May 1998, the children of van Vollenhoven bear the surname &quot;van Lippe-Biesterfeld van Vollenhoven&quot;, without titles.

Upon the abdication of Queen Beatrix, which took place on 30 April 2013, it was confirmed that the children of Princess Margriet and Pieter van Vollenhoven would no longer be eligible to succeed to the throne, and that they would also cease to be members of the Royal House according to The Membership of the Royal House Act.

<text>Martín de Goiti (c. 1534 – 1575) was a Spanish conquistador and one of the soldiers who accompanied the Spanish voyage of exploration to the East Indies and the Pacific in 1565, in search of rich resources such as gold, spice and settlements. They were seeking to find a route to the islands where the previous Spanish expeditions led by Ferdinand Magellan had landed in 1521, and Ruy López de Villalobos in 1543. 

From his base in Mexico City, he led the expedition to Manila in the Philippines, ordered by the Spanish general Miguel López de Legazpi in 1569. He then engaged in warfare against the native chieftains Rajah Sulayman, Rajah Matanda and Rajah Lakandula and fought the natives in order to established European settlements.

== The Battles for Manila (1570 – 1575) ==
The Spaniards arrived in the island of Luzon on 8 May 1570, and camped on the shores of Manila Bay for several weeks, while forming an alliance with the native tribes. On 24 May 1570, disputes and hostility erupted between the two groups. The Spaniards occupied the city of Tondo where they were greeted by thousands of tribal warriors. There, they defeated most of Rajah Sulayman&#x27;s forces. The Spaniards marched their armies towards the Pasig River, and occupied the settlements in Manila on 6 June 1570 and burned them.

Guerrilla warfare broke out following the battle, which continued for about ten months. The Spaniards fortified themselves in the area and constructed their military barracks of Fort Santiago, which became their outpost for trade with Mexico. The Spaniards gained control of the settlements on 24 June 1571, after the arrival of López de Legazpi in Manila.

The Spanish colonization paved the way for the establishment of Manila as a permanent settlement and capital city of the Spanish East Indies. He later explored Pampanga, Pangasinan and founded several Spanish settlements in Luzon between the periods of 1571-1573. De Goiti, along with other soldiers were granted with estates called haciendas, for the lands they had conquered, by King Philip II of Spain.

In 1574, de Goiti fought in the war against an invasion of about 6,500 Chinese sea pirates who had sailed from the South China Sea. Their leader, Limahong, laid siege on the Spanish settlements in Manila. De Goiti was killed by these pirates. Most of the Spanish reinforcements came from Vigan and Cebu. De Goiti&#x27;s second in command, Juan de Salcedo left Ilocos Sur, after hearing the news and traveled to Manila where he discovered their settlements had been ceded to the pirates. Salcedo&#x27;s forces attacked and drove the pirates out of Manila. Limahong and his fleets retreated to Pangasinan where they re-organize their forces.

In 1575, Salcedo&#x27;s army marched north to Pangasinan, in pursuit of the pirates, and besieged them for three months. There the pirates surrendered to the Spaniards.

==Legacy==
De Goiti&#x27;s remains are laid to rest on a knight&#x27;s tomb inside the San Agustin Church, in Intramuros in the Philippines.

<text>Self-abasement is humiliating oneself when one feels lower or less deserving of respect.

Self-abasement might have a religious aspect for those seeking humility before God, perhaps in the context of monastic or cenobitic lifestyle.

It also has a sexual and fetish aspect for those people who enjoy erotic humiliation and other related BDSM practices.

Examples of self-abasement practices include self-flagellation, bondage, torture, public humiliation (including online humiliation).

In psychology, self-abasement is associated with shame (rather than guilt) and involves the reduction of the subject&#x27;s self-esteem. The notion of self-abasement can be said to be based in Freudian psychoanalysis. Fear may also result in self-abasement.

<doc id="1268956" wikidata="Q223342" url="?curid=1268956" title="Third Epistle to the Corinthians">
<text>The Third Epistle to the Corinthians is an early Christian text written by an unknown author claiming to be Paul the Apostle. It is also found in the Acts of Paul, and was framed as Paul&#x27;s response to a letter of the Corinthians to Paul. The earliest extant copy is Papyrus Bodmer X, dating to the third century. Originally written in Koine Greek, the letter survives in Greek, Coptic, Latin, and Armenian manuscripts.

== Content and theological background ==
The text is structured as an attempt to correct alleged misinterpretations of the earlier First and Second Epistles to the Corinthians, of which the author (usually called &quot;pseudo-Paul&quot;) has become aware due to the (similarly pseudepigraphic) Epistle of the Corinthians to Paul, which is paired with Paul&#x27;s response as a single correspondence. According to the preceding part of the Acts of Paul, when the letter was written Paul was in prison, on account of Stratonice, the wife of Apollophanes. The epistle seems to attack themes associated with Gnostic Christianity and docetism, albeit loosely. 3 Corinthians emphasizes the importance of the flesh: that the Incarnation of Jesus had been as a real flesh-and-blood person, rather than a divine apparition or spirit that only appeared to suffer. Jesus will &quot;redeem all flesh through his own flesh&quot;, and &quot;by his own body Jesus Christ saved all flesh.&quot; Against Gnosticism, the letter condemns those who &quot;assert that heaven and earth and all that is in them are not a work of God&quot;, an apparent attack on the Gnostic belief that the material world was the work of a different god, the Demiurge.

Before the Bodmer X papyrus was discovered, it was generally assumed that 3 Corinthians had been written as part of the Acts of Paul. The Bodmer X version, however, is older than the oldest surviving copies of the Acts of Paul, and has only the Epistle of the Corinthians and Paul&#x27;s response. It does not include the narrative introductions to each letter seen in later works or the rest of the Acts of Paul. Additionally, the correspondence does not entirely line up with the events described elsewhere: the correspondence indicates that heresy is a major problem in Corinth, while the narrative makes no such claim when Paul arrives in the city; Paul is instead pleased with the progress of the believers. Cleobius is presented as an arch-heretic stirring up trouble in the correspondence, yet in the narrative he is a spirit-filled Christian. This has caused most scholars to believe that the epistle predated the Acts of Paul, and the Acts of Paul was compiling and merging existing letters and stories rather than creating a single combined work.

== Authorship ==
Scholars do not accept the epistle&#x27;s claimed authorship of Paul for a number of reasons. While the epistle contains a number of Pauline themes and similar phrasings taken from First and Second Corinthians, it varies from Paul in ways difficult to square with his authorship. Notably, Paul draws a sharp distinction in his undisputed letters between &quot;flesh&quot; (&quot;sarx&quot;) and &quot;body&quot; (&quot;soma&quot;). To Paul, flesh is the negative aspects of human sin and temptation that are left behind; but the body of Christians will be resurrected. In 3 Corinthians, however, flesh is given an unambiguous positive connotation: the flesh of believers will be resurrected, in contradiction to Paul&#x27;s claim that &quot;flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God&quot; (). The letter places no importance on the death of Jesus and omits any discussion of Jewish Law, popular themes for Paul to discuss, eschewing them for themes seen nowhere else in Paul&#x27;s work such as the story of the bones of the prophet Elisha.

== Canonicity ==

In the Western Roman Empire, the epistle was not included in the Biblical canon that was formed in the 4th century AD. It was relegated to New Testament apocrypha. In early traditions of the Eastern Roman Empire and the Syriac Orthodox Church, Aphrahat () treated it as canonical and Ephrem the Syrian (d. 373) apparently accepted it as canonical, because he wrote a commentary on it. The Doctrine of Addai includes it, but it was not included in the Syriac Peshitta translation of the Bible (but nor were 2–3 John, 2 Peter, Jude, or Revelation, which are almost universally recognized as canonical, see also Antilegomena). The only place 3 Corinthians survived as part of the canon into the medieval age was in the Armenian Apostolic tradition. Although part of the &quot;Oskan Armenian Bible&quot; of 1666, it was in an Appendix to the &quot;Zohrab Armenian Bible&quot; of 1805 which follows the Vulgate canon, and it is not currently considered part of the Armenian Orthodox New Testament. It was not part of the canon list of Anania Shirakatsi in the 7th century but is part of the canon lists of Hovhannes Imastaser (11th century), Mekhitar of Ayrivank (13th century) and Gregory of Tatev (14th century).

According to the 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;:
The ancient Syrian (Edessene) Church revered as canonical a Third Epistle of St. Paul to the Corinthians, which is accompanied by a letter from the pastors of that Church, to which it is an answer. But about the beginning of the fifth century the Syrian Church fell under the influence of the Greek, and in consequence the spurious letter gradually lost its canonical status. It was taken up by the neighbouring Armenians and for centuries has formed a part of the Armenian New Testament. Latin and Greek writers are completely silent about this pseudograph, although Greek and Latin copies have been found. It was obviously suggested by the lost genuine Pauline letter referred to in I Cor. v, 9; vii, 1. It was composed by a presbyter about 160–170, and is a disguised attack on some of the leading errors of Gnosticism. This correspondence long had an independent circulation, but recently it has been proved that the document was incorporated into the Acts of St. Paul (q.v.).

<doc id="1268957" wikidata="Q3141604" url="?curid=1268957" title="Howard Thurman">
<text>Howard Washington Thurman (November 18, 1899 – April 10, 1981) was an American author, philosopher, theologian, Christian mystic, educator, and civil rights leader. 

As a prominent religious figure, he played a leading role in many social justice movements and organizations of the twentieth century. Thurman&#x27;s theology of radical nonviolence influenced and shaped a generation of civil rights activists, and he was a key mentor to leaders within the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King Jr.

Thurman served as dean of Rankin Chapel at Howard University from 1932 to 1944 and as dean of Marsh Chapel at Boston University from 1953 to 1965. In 1944, he co-founded, along with Alfred Fisk, the first major interracial, interdenominational church in the United States.

==Early life and education==
Howard Thurman was born in 1899 in Florida in Daytona Beach. He spent most of his childhood in Daytona, Florida, where his family lived in Waycross, one of Daytona&#x27;s three all-black communities. 

He was profoundly influenced by his maternal grandmother, Nancy Ambrose, who had been enslaved on a plantation in Madison County, Florida. Nancy Ambrose and Thurman&#x27;s mother, Alice, were members of Mount Bethel Baptist Church in Waycross and were women of deep Christian faith. 

Thurman&#x27;s father, Saul Thurman, died of pneumonia when Howard Thurman was seven years old. After completing eighth grade, Thurman attended the Florida Baptist Academy in Jacksonville, Florida. One hundred miles from Daytona, it was one of only three high schools for African Americans in Florida at the time.

In 1923, Thurman graduated from Morehouse College as valedictorian. In 1925, he was ordained as a Baptist minister at First Baptist Church of Roanoke, Virginia, while still a student at Rochester Theological Seminary (now Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School). He graduated from Rochester Theological Seminary in May 1926 as valedictorian. 

From June 1926 until the fall of 1928, Thurman served as pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Oberlin, Ohio. In the fall of 1928, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, where he had a joint appointment to Morehouse College and Spelman College in philosophy and religion. During the spring semester of 1929, Thurman pursued further study as a special student at Haverford College with Rufus Jones, a noted Quaker philosopher and mystic. He enjoyed praying and going to church which provided him part of his education.

==Marriage and family==
Thurman married Katie Kelley on June 11, 1926, less than a month after graduating from seminary. Katie was a 1918 graduate of the Teacher&#x27;s Course at Spelman Seminary (renamed Spelman College in 1924). Their daughter Olive was born in October 1927. Katie died in December 1930 of tuberculosis, which she had probably contracted during her anti-tuberculosis work. On June 12, 1932, Thurman married Sue Bailey, whom he had met while at Morehouse, when Sue was a student at Spelman. Their daughter Anne was born in October 1933. Sue Bailey Thurman was an author, lecturer, historian, civil rights activist, and founder of the &quot;Aframerican Women&#x27;s Journal&quot;. She died in 1996.

==Career==

Thurman was selected as the first dean of Rankin Chapel at Howard University in the District of Columbia in 1932. He served there from 1932 to 1944. He also served on the faculty of the Howard University School of Divinity.

Thurman traveled broadly, heading Christian missions and meeting with world figures. In 1935-36 he led a six-month delegation of African-Americans invited to India for meetings. At Bardoli they spoke with Mahatma Gandhi, who asked &quot;persistent, pragmatic questions&quot; about the Black American community and its struggles. Training for satyagraha was discussed, its difficulties in the extreme addressed. 

When Thurman asked Gandhi what message he should take back to the United States, Gandhi said he regretted not having made nonviolence more visible as a practice worldwide and remarked &quot;It may be through the Negroes that the unadulterated message of nonviolence will be delivered to the world&quot;.

In 1944, Thurman left his tenured position at Howard to help the Fellowship of Reconciliation establish the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples also known as The Fellowship Church in San Francisco. He served as co-pastor with a white minister, Alfred Fisk. Many of their congregants were African Americans who had migrated to San Francisco from Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas for jobs in the defense industry. The church helped create a new community for many in San Francisco.

Thurman was invited to Boston University in 1953, where he became the dean of Marsh Chapel (1953–1965). He was the first black dean of a chapel at a majority-white university or college in the United States. In addition, he served on the faculty of Boston University School of Theology. Thurman was also active and well known in the Boston community, where he influenced many leaders. Thurman was the minister delivering the sermon at Marsh Chapel on Good Friday April 20, 1962; the famous Good Friday double-blind psychedelic experiment by Walter Pahnke using psilocybin to assess whether a religious environment influenced a mystical experience.

After leaving Boston University in 1965, Thurman continued his ministry as chairman of the board and director of the Howard Thurman Educational Trust in San Francisco. He reportedly received a Doctor of Divinity degree from BU in 1967.

Thurman was a prolific author, writing twenty books on theology, religion, and philosophy. The most famous of his works, &quot;Jesus and the Disinherited&quot; (1949), deeply influenced Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders, both black and white, of the modern Civil Rights Movement. 

Thurman had been a classmate and friend of King&#x27;s father at Morehouse. King visited Thurman while he attended BU, and Thurman in turn mentored his former classmate&#x27;s son and his friends. He served as spiritual advisor to King, Sherwood Eddy, James Farmer, A. J. Muste, and Pauli Murray. 

At BU, Thurman also taught Reb Zalman Schachter-Shalomi, who cited Thurman as among the teachers who first compelled him to explore mystical trends beyond Judaism.

==Death==
Howard Thurman died due to a lingering illness on April 10, 1981, in San Francisco, California. He was 81 years old.

==Honors and legacy==

In 1935, Thurman received an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Morehouse. &quot;Ebony Magazine&quot; at one point called Thurman one of the 50 most important figures in African-American history. In 1953, &quot;Life&quot; rated Thurman among the twelve most important religious leaders in the United States. Thurman was named honorary Canon of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York City, in 1974.

In 1986, Dean Emeritus George K. Makechnie founded the Howard Thurman Center at Boston University to preserve and share the legacy of Howard Thurman. In 2020, the Howard Thurman Center for Common Ground moved to a larger space occupying two floors in the Peter Fuller Building at 808 Commonwealth Avenue. The Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University holds the Howard Thurman Papers and the Sue Bailey Thurman Papers, where they are catalogued and available to researchers.

The Howard Thurman Papers Project was founded in 1992. The Project&#x27;s mission is to preserve and promote Thurman&#x27;s vast documentary record, which spans 63 years and consists of approximately 58,000 items of correspondence, sermons, unpublished writings, and speeches. The Howard Thurman Papers Project is located at Boston University School of Theology.

Howard University School of Divinity named their chapel the Thurman Chapel in memory of Howard Thurman.

Howard Thurman&#x27;s poem &#x27;I Will Light Candles This Christmas&#x27; has been set to music by British composer and songwriter Adrian Payne, both as a song and as a choral (SATB) piece. The choral version was first performed by Epsom Choral Society in December 2007. An arrangement for school choirs, which can be performed in one or two parts with piano accompaniment, was first performed in December 2010.

<doc id="1268958" wikidata="Q861681" url="?curid=1268958" title="Function of a real variable">
<text>In mathematical analysis, and applications in geometry, applied mathematics, engineering, and natural sciences, a function of a real variable is a function whose domain is the real numbers formula_1, or a subset of formula_1 that contains an interval of positive length. Most real functions that are considered and studied are differentiable in some interval.
The most widely considered such functions are the real functions, which are the real-valued functions of a real variable, that is, the functions of a real variable whose codomain is the set of real numbers.

Nevertheless, the codomain of a function of a real variable may be any set. However, it is often assumed to have a structure of formula_1-vector space over the reals. That is, the codomain may be a Euclidean space, a coordinate vector, the set of matrices of real numbers of a given size, or an formula_1-algebra, such as the complex numbers or the quaternions. The structure formula_1-vector space of the codomain induces a structure of formula_1-vector space on the functions. If the codomain has a structure of formula_1-algebra, the same is true for the functions.

The image of a function of a real variable is a curve in the codomain. In this context, a function that defines curve is called a parametric equation of the curve.

When the codomain of a function of a real variable is a finite-dimensional vector space, the function may be viewed as a sequence of real functions. This is often used in applications.

==Real function==

A real function is a function from a subset of formula_8 to formula_9 where formula_8 denotes as usual the set of real numbers. That is, the domain of a real function is a subset formula_8, and its codomain is formula_12 It is generally assumed that the domain contains an interval of positive length.

===Basic examples===

For many commonly used real functions, the domain is the whole set of real numbers, and the function is continuous and differentiable at every point of the domain. One says that these functions are defined, continuous and differentiable everywhere. This is the case of:
* All polynomial functions, including constant functions and linear functions
* Sine and cosine functions
* Exponential function

Some functions are defined everywhere, but not continuous at some points. For example
* The Heaviside step function is defined everywhere, but not continuous at zero.

Some functions are defined and continuous everywhere, but not everywhere differentiable. For example
* The absolute value is defined and continuous everywhere, and is differentiable everywhere, except for zero.
* The cubic root is defined and continuous everywhere, and is differentiable everywhere, except for zero.

Many common functions are not defined everywhere, but are continuous and differentiable everywhere where they are defined. For example:
* A rational function is a quotient of two polynomial functions, and is not defined at the zeros of the denominator.
* The tangent function is not defined for formula_13 where is any integer.
* The logarithm function is defined only for positive values of the variable.

Some functions are continuous in their whole domain, and not differentiable at some points. This is the case of:
*The square root is defined only for nonnegative values of the variable, and not differentiable at 0 (it is differentiable for all positive values of the variable).

==General definition ==

A real-valued function of a real variable is a function that takes as input a real number, commonly represented by the variable &quot;x&quot;, for producing another real number, the &quot;value&quot; of the function, commonly denoted &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). For simplicity, in this article a real-valued function of a real variable will be simply called a function. To avoid any ambiguity, the other types of functions that may occur will be explicitly specified.

Some functions are defined for all real values of the variables (one says that they are everywhere defined), but some other functions are defined only if the value of the variable is taken in a subset &quot;X&quot; of formula_1, the domain of the function, which is always supposed to contain an interval of positive length. In other words, a real-valued function of a real variable is a function

:formula_15

such that its domain &quot;X&quot; is a subset of formula_1 that contains an interval of positive length.

A simple example of a function in one variable could be:

:formula_17
:formula_18
:formula_19

which is the square root of &quot;x&quot;.

===Image===

The image of a function formula_20 is the set of all values of when the variable &quot;x&quot; runs in the whole domain of . For a continuous (see below for a definition) real-valued function with a connected domain, the image is either an interval or a single value. In the latter case, the function is a constant function.

The preimage of a given real number &quot;y&quot; is the set of the solutions of the equation .

=== Domain ===

The domain of a function of several real variables is a subset of formula_1 that is sometimes explicitly defined. In fact, if one restricts the domain &quot;X&quot; of a function &quot;f&quot; to a subset &quot;Y&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot;, one gets formally a different function, the &quot;restriction&quot; of &quot;f&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;, which is denoted &quot;f&quot;|&quot;Y&quot;. In practice, it is often not harmful to identify &quot;f&quot; and &quot;f&quot;|&quot;Y&quot;, and to omit the subscript |&quot;Y&quot;.

Conversely, it is sometimes possible to enlarge naturally the domain of a given function, for example by continuity or by analytic continuation. This means that it is not worthy to explicitly define the domain of a function of a real variable.

=== Algebraic structure ===

The arithmetic operations may be applied to the functions in the following way:
* For every real number &quot;r&quot;, the constant function formula_22, is everywhere defined.
* For every real number &quot;r&quot; and every function &quot;f&quot;, the function formula_23 has the same domain as &quot;f&quot; (or is everywhere defined if &quot;r&quot; = 0).
* If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are two functions of respective domains &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; such that contains an open subset of formula_1, then formula_25 and formula_26 are functions that have a domain containing .

It follows that the functions of &quot;n&quot; variables that are everywhere defined and the functions of &quot;n&quot; variables that are defined in some neighbourhood of a given point both form commutative algebras over the reals (formula_1-algebras).

One may similarly define formula_28 which is a function only if the set of the points in the domain of &quot;f&quot; such that contains an open subset of formula_1. This constraint implies that the above two algebras are not fields.

===Continuity and limit===

Until the second part of 19th century, only continuous functions were considered by mathematicians. At that time, the notion of continuity was elaborated for the functions of one or several real variables a rather long time before the formal definition of a topological space and a continuous map between topological spaces. As continuous functions of a real variable are ubiquitous in mathematics, it is worth defining this notion without reference to the general notion of continuous maps between topological space.

For defining the continuity, it is useful to consider the distance function of formula_1, which is an everywhere defined function of 2 real variables:
formula_31

A function &quot;f&quot; is continuous at a point formula_32 which is interior to its domain, if, for every positive real number , there is a positive real number such that formula_33 for all formula_34 such that formula_35 In other words, may be chosen small enough for having the image by &quot;f&quot; of the interval of radius centered at formula_32 contained in the interval of length centered at formula_37 A function is continuous if it is continuous at every point of its domain.

The limit of a real-valued function of a real variable is as follows. Let &quot;a&quot; be a point in topological closure of the domain &quot;X&quot; of the function &quot;f&quot;. The function, &quot;f&quot; has a limit &quot;L&quot; when &quot;x&quot; tends toward &quot;a&quot;, denoted 
:formula_38
if the following condition is satisfied:
For every positive real number &quot;ε&quot; &gt; 0, there is a positive real number &quot;δ&quot; &gt; 0 such that 
:formula_39
for all &quot;x&quot; in the domain such that
:formula_40

If the limit exists, it is unique. If &quot;a&quot; is in the interior of the domain, the limit exists if and only if the function is continuous at &quot;a&quot;. In this case, we have 
:formula_41

When &quot;a&quot; is in the boundary of the domain of &quot;f&quot;, and if &quot;f&quot; has a limit at &quot;a&quot;, the latter formula allows to &quot;extend by continuity&quot; the domain of &quot;f&quot; to &quot;a&quot;.

==Calculus==

One can collect a number of functions each of a real variable, say

:formula_42

into a vector parametrized by &quot;x&quot;:

:formula_43

The derivative of the vector y is the vector derivatives of &quot;fi&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, ..., &quot;n&quot;:

:formula_44

One can also perform line integrals along a space curve parametrized by &quot;x&quot;, with position vector r = r(&quot;x&quot;), by integrating with respect to the variable &quot;x&quot;:

:formula_45

where · is the dot product, and &quot;x&quot; = &quot;a&quot; and &quot;x&quot; = &quot;b&quot; are the start and endpoints of the curve.

===Theorems===

With the definitions of integration and derivatives, key theorems can be formulated, including the fundamental theorem of calculus, integration by parts, and Taylor&#x27;s theorem. Evaluating a mixture of integrals and derivatives can be done by using theorem differentiation under the integral sign.

==Implicit functions==

A real-valued implicit function of a real variable is not written in the form &quot;&quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;. Instead, the mapping is from the space formula_12 to the zero element in formula_1 (just the ordinary zero 0):

:formula_48

and

:formula_49

is an equation in the variables. Implicit functions are a more general way to represent functions, since if:

:formula_50

then we can always define:

:formula_51

but the converse is not always possible, i.e. not all implicit functions have the form of this equation.

==One-dimensional space curves in formula_1&quot;n&quot;==

===Formulation===

Given the functions , , ..., all of a common variable &quot;t&quot;, so that:

:formula_53

or taken together:

:formula_54

then the parametrized &quot;n&quot;-tuple,

:formula_55

describes a one-dimensional space curve.

===Tangent line to curve===

At a point for some constant &quot;t&quot; = &quot;c&quot;, the equations of the one-dimensional tangent line to the curve at that point are given in terms of the ordinary derivatives of &quot;r&quot;1(&quot;t&quot;), &quot;r&quot;2(&quot;t&quot;), ..., &quot;r&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;t&quot;), and &quot;r&quot; with respect to &quot;t&quot;:

:formula_56

===Normal plane to curve===

The equation of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hyperplane normal to the tangent line at r = a is:

:formula_57

or in terms of the dot product:

:formula_58

where are points &quot;in the plane&quot;, not on the space curve.

===Relation to kinematics===

The physical and geometric interpretation of &quot;d&quot;r(&quot;t&quot;)/&quot;dt&quot; is the &quot;velocity&quot; of a point-like particle moving along the path r(&quot;t&quot;), treating r as the spatial position vector coordinates parametrized by time &quot;t&quot;, and is a vector tangent to the space curve for all &quot;t&quot; in the instantaneous direction of motion. At &quot;t&quot; = &quot;c&quot;, the space curve has a tangent vector , and the hyperplane normal to the space curve at &quot;t&quot; = &quot;c&quot; is also normal to the tangent at &quot;t&quot; = &quot;c&quot;. Any vector in this plane (p − a) must be normal to .

Similarly, &quot;d&quot;2r(&quot;t&quot;)/&quot;dt&quot;2 is the &quot;acceleration&quot; of the particle, and is a vector normal to the curve directed along the radius of curvature.

==Matrix valued functions==

A matrix can also be a function of a single variable. For example, the rotation matrix in 2d:

:formula_59

is a matrix valued function of rotation angle of about the origin. Similarly, in special relativity, the Lorentz transformation matrix for a pure boost (without rotations):

:formula_60

is a function of the boost parameter &quot;β&quot; = &quot;v&quot;/&quot;c&quot;, in which &quot;v&quot; is the relative velocity between the frames of reference (a continuous variable), and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, a constant.

==Banach and Hilbert spaces and quantum mechanics==
Generalizing the previous section, the output of a function of a real variable can also lie in a Banach space or a Hilbert space. In these spaces, division and multiplication and limits are all defined, so notions such as derivative and integral still apply. This occurs especially often in quantum mechanics, where one takes the derivative of a ket or an operator. This occurs, for instance, in the general time-dependent Schrödinger equation:

:formula_61

where one takes the derivative of a wave function, which can be an element of several different Hilbert spaces.

== Complex-valued function of a real variable==

A complex-valued function of a real variable may be defined by relaxing, in the definition of the real-valued functions, the restriction of the codomain to the real numbers, and allowing complex values.

If is such a complex valued function, it may be decomposed as 
where and are real-valued functions. In other words, the study of the complex valued functions reduces easily to the study of the pairs of real valued functions.

== Cardinality of sets of functions of a real variable ==
The cardinality of the set of real-valued functions of a real variable, formula_62, is formula_63, which is strictly larger than the cardinality of the continuum (i.e., set of all real numbers). This fact is easily verified by cardinal arithmetic:

formula_64

Furthermore, if formula_65 is a set such that formula_66, then the cardinality of the set formula_67 is also formula_68, since

formula_69

However, the set of continuous functions formula_70 has a strictly smaller cardinality, the cardinality of the continuum, formula_71. This follows from the fact that a continuous function is completely determined by its value on a dense subset of its domain. Thus, the cardinality of the set of continuous real-valued functions on the reals is no greater than the cardinality of the set of real-valued functions of a rational variable. By cardinal arithmetic:

formula_72

On the other hand, since there is a clear bijection between formula_73 and the set of constant functions formula_74, which forms a subset of formula_75, formula_76 must also hold. Hence, formula_77.

<text>The Gili Islands ( [Three Gilis], Kepulauan Gili [Gili Islands]) are an archipelago of three small islands or Gili island triplets — Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno and Gili Air — just off the northwest coast of Lombok, Indonesia. The local name of these three islands is Gili Indah which means &quot;small beautiful islands&quot;. They were previously administered under Lombok Barat Regency along with Senggigi until 2010 when the Gili islands came under the jurisdiction of the new North Lombok Regency (Kabupaten Lombok Utara); together they form an administrative village (&quot;desa&quot;) within the Pemenang District (&quot;kecamatan&quot;) of North Lombok Regency.

The islands are a tourist destination. Each island has several resorts, usually consisting of a collection of huts for tourists, a small pool and restaurant. The largest Indonesian settlement is located on Gili Air, however due to the amount of western expatriates who live on Trawangan together with the locals, it has become the more densely populated island, concentrated in a township stretching along its east side (this is also where the majority of tourist development has taken place). Automobiles and motorized traffic are prohibited on the islands by local ordinance, so the preferred method of transportation is by foot and bicycle or the horse-drawn carriage called a cidomo. Scuba diving and free diving in and around the Gilis is also common due to the abundance of marine life and coral formations. Most famous diving spots are Shark point, Manta point and Simon&#x27;s reef.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Gili Islands&quot; is somewhat tautological, because &quot;Gili&quot; simply means &quot;small island&quot; in Sasak. Most of the small islands around the coast of Lombok have Gili in their names, and to avoid confusion with the three islands of the Gili Islands, the other Gilis around the Lombok coast should be referred to in English by their full proper names.

The Indonesian word for water is &quot;Air&quot; () and Gili Air was so-named as it is the only island of the three to have subterranean fresh water. Since this fresh water is a finite resource on the island, some resorts and restaurants in the island ship in water from the mainland.

==Geography and climate==
The Islands are located in the Lombok Strait, to the immediate northwest of Lombok. They extend outward from a tiny peninsula called Sire near to the village of Tanjung on Lombok. Bali lies about 35 km to the west of Gili Trawangan, the islands&#x27; most westerly member. Both Bali and Lombok are easily visible from the Gilis in clear weather. Mount Rinjani, Indonesia&#x27;s second highest volcano, is close by on neighbouring Lombok, and dominates the views towards the east.

Due to their close proximity to the Equator, the Islands have a warm, tropical climate with a dry and wet season. With Mount Rinjani to the immediate east on Lombok, and Mount Agung to the west on Bali, the Gilis are somewhat sheltered and actually enjoy a slightly drier microclimate when compared to the surrounding archipelago. Dry Season usually lasts from May until October, with monsoon season starting in November and continuing through to April. Temperatures range between 22 °C to 34 °C, with an average annual temperature of around 28 °C.

==History==
Due to their small size and population, and relatively recent settlement of the islands, published sources are limited. Where local knowledge has been used, those cited are elected local officials whose details are listed in the references section. For more detailed regional historical information, visit the Lombok article.

For a brief period during the Second World War, occupying Japanese forces used the islands as a lookout post and prisoner of war camp. Relics from this period include the remains of a bunker on the hill of Gili Trawangan, and the wreck of a patrol boat submerged at a depth of 45 m in the bay to the south of Gili Air (now a popular dive site). Permanent settlement only began in the 1970s, mainly due to the lack of fresh water sources before that time. Prior to human settlement, these islands remained pristine wildlife mangrove habitats.

Initially, Bugis fishermen used the islands as a stop off location for their voyages around the archipelago. In 1971 the governor of Lombok, Wasita Kusama, began to establish coconut plantations and gave land rights to private companies. Some 350 inmates from the overcrowded prison in Lombok’s largest city Mataram, were sent to help with the first harvests between 1974 and 1979; many of the inmates remained on the islands as permanent settlers. Following various difficulties with coconut harvests, the private efforts to exploit the islands&#x27; plantations were abandoned. The local population grew beyond their allocated bounds (100 hectares) and began to erect homes and businesses on the private, abandoned land. This led to a land dispute that continues to the present.

In the 1980s, the islands started to be discovered by backpacker tourists. This was influenced by the exponential rise of tourism in neighbouring Bali. At first, Gili Air (having the most infrastructure at the time) began to transform to cater to this new economy. However, Gili Trawangan soon surpassed it, due mostly to its proximity to better dive locations.

As the prospects for tourism on the islands began to rise in the late 1980s and early ‘90s, the government and investors whose abandoned land had been settled on by an expanding population, began to regain interest in the potential for development. This resulted in a series of evictions and demolishing of local homes and businesses, followed each time by inaction on the part of the developers and the rebuilding of destroyed homes by residents who opposed the eviction.

The first tourist accommodation on Gili Trawangan was a small homestay called Pak Majid, built in 1982, by Pak (&quot;polite Mr&quot;) Majid. This was eventually taken over in 2007 and transformed into Pesona Resort and Restaurant (the first Indian restaurant on the Gilis). Most of the locally owned businesses from the 1980s have been acquired by westerners. The longest standing locally owned and operated business is &quot;Goodheart&quot; resort, originally built in 1987 and rebuilt three times following demolition relating to the ongoing land dispute.

Gili Trawangan gained a reputation from the late 1980s to the late 1990s as a party island. Drugs were freely available on the island and its low population and remoteness required no police presence at the time.

During the 1990s, the diving industry grew swiftly and the islands began to develop into a world class diving instruction location. This fed local tourism and in the new millennium a wider spectrum of accommodation and entertainment began to be developed that catered to a broader range of visitors.

In 2000, a non-profit organisation by the name of Gili Eco Trust was established to help protect the coral reefs surrounding the islands and improve environmental education. It originated as a co-operative venture between influential members of the local community (Satgas) and the dive shops on Gili Trawangan; and was initiated by the owners of Manta Dive. Many projects have since been organised to protect and restore coral reefs, improve waste management, struggle against erosion, treat animals, raise awareness and educate. This was needed as damage had occurred due to a particularly warm El Niño and unsustainable local fishing methods.

In 2005, fast boat operations began from neighbouring Bali. Since then, many other fast boat services have come and gone, from various points around Bali and Nusa Lembongan, to the islands.

, the islands continue to experience rapid growth and development related to the tourism industry. Efforts are being made to preserve marine habitats and remain culturally distinct from neighbouring Bali in this process. The aforementioned land dispute remains unresolved.

==Gili Trawangan==
Gili Trawangan, or colloquially Gili T, is the largest of Lombok&#x27;s Gili Islands and the only one to rise significantly (30 m) above sea level. Measuring 3 km long and 2 km wide, it has a population of around 1500 (see demography). The name Trawangan originates from the Indonesian word Terowongan (Tunnel) due to the presence of a cave tunnel built there during Japanese occupation in World War 2. Japanese presence during the second world war was on elevated topography in the South of the island, where anti-aircraft guns were housed. Only the base of the AA guns remains at the end of the tunnel. Of the Gilis, Trawangan is the most developed and geared towards tourism. The main concentration of settlement, recreation, accommodation and diving business is situated on the eastern side of the island. A local pub, Tír na Nóg claims that Trawangan is the smallest island in the world with an Irish pub. 

On Gili Trawangan (as well as the other two Gilis), there are no motorised vehicles. The main means of transportation are bicycles (rented by locals to tourists) and cidomo (a small horse-drawn carriage). For travelling to and from each of the Gilis, locals usually use motorised boats and speedboats.

Some of the first inhabitants of Gili Trawangan were fishermen and farmers from Sulawesi. Previous to human settlement Gili Trawangan was covered in forest and deer lived on the island. (Source: Inhabitants of Gili Trawangan — no printed source available).

The economy of Gili Trawangan centres on tourism, as the island is too small to support any broad scale agriculture, and too remote to allow economically viable industry or commerce. There is a mosque and a lighthouse on the island.

On 26 March 2014, Will Goodman set a depth record on a closed circuit mixed gas rebreather with . During the dive all his computers froze. His actual – but unrecorded – depth is estimated to be a shade over . The dive in total took nine hours and 57 minutes.

===Drug tourism===
Gili Trawangan has had a reputation since the 1980s as a location where drugs are freely available. Psilocybin mushrooms are openly advertised on the island, and a range of harder drugs have been known to be in circulation. Though police presence is low, Indonesian drug laws are extremely harsh and thus strictly speaking drug possession and use is prohibited and carries potentially grave risk (up to and including the death penalty).
Although the &#x27;drug tourism&#x27; (and tourism in general) began on Gili Trawangan, in the last 10 years finding drugs on Gili Air and Gili Meno has become very open and easy as well. Especially on Gili Air which has more intense psychedelics being sold openly to tourists for beach parties. 
Gili Trawangan is also the only island out of the 3 Gili Islands that has any active law enforcement. This makes it much more difficult for harder drugs (such as cocaine or ecstasy) to be sold, and deters drug dealers from staying there. Gili Meno and Gili Air have no police and any issues need to be dealt with at the police station in Lombok.

=== Over tourism ===
Since 2009, the number of tourists visiting Gili Trawangan has doubled each year, from 35,000 to over one million in 2015, overwhelming infrastructure and contributing to the destruction of surrounding coral reefs.

The increase in tourism has also led to an increase in migrant workers, causing issues with waste management. According to Thomas Egli – a photographer who travelled to Gili Trawangan in 2015 to document the overtourism problem – there is a huge rubbish tip in the centre of the island that is kept out of sight of visiting tourists. He also describes overwhelmed septic tanks leading to unfiltered waste entering the sea, unregulated building, and culture clashes between the predominantly-Muslim local population and (mostly) Western tourists.

==Gili Meno==
Gili Meno is the middle of Lombok&#x27;s three northwest coast Gilis. Gili Meno has a population of about 500, mainly concentrated on the centre of the island (see section on demography). The main income comes from tourism, coconut plantation and fishing. On the west side of the island there is a small shallow lake that produces salt in the dry season. Until a few years ago there was also a small production of seaweed on the reef at the north end of the island. Gili Meno has swimming beaches all around the island, and a turtle sanctuary.

The island attracts fewer tourists than Gili Trawangan and is the quietest and smallest of the islands. However, honeymooners are often drawn to the crystal clear water and idyllic, secluded white beaches.

Since early 2017 fresh water was installed on the island and is supplied by underwater pipes from Lombok. Electricity is supplied by underwater cables from Lombok. There are no cars or motorbikes.

==Gili Air==

Gili Air is the second smallest of the islands and the closest to mainland Lombok, making it popular with honeymoon couples and travellers seeking a quiet retreat. It has a population of about 1,800. The island offers excellent snorkelling and scuba diving off its east coast, and turtles can be seen along the coral reef. Other water sports such as Stand Up Paddleboarding and Kitesurfing are also now available. An Indonesian cooking school has opened its door on the harbour in 2015 Gili Cooking Classes. Gili Air also has two public gym: one indoors as well as an outdoor gym set on the beach.

Continued investment in tourism is resulting in rapid development of the islands, and each year sees new resorts and accommodation on the islands while attempting to retain their individual character. Proximity to Gili Meno, the smallest and most secluded of the islands and to Gili Trawangan the largest island, known for its many restaurants and parties, makes Gili Air a destination that combines relative seclusion with adequate services. Both other Islands are a quick boat ride away.

==Transport==
There is no motorised transport on the Islands apart from electric scooters. The short distances on land are traversed on foot, by bicycle or Cidomo. The Islands can only be reached by sea, and are frequented by a variety of fast boats operating various routes from Bali and Lombok.
*There are direct boat services from Bali and Lombok to the Gili Islands.
* Flights from Ngurah Rai International Airport to Lombok International Airport take about 40 minutes followed by a 2 h taxi ride to Bangsal harbour in Northwest Lombok and a Local boat to the Gili Islands for a further 20-30mins.
* Public Ferries depart from Padang Bai (Southeast Bali) every hour, taking a minimum of 4–5 hours to reach Lembar (Southwest Lombok), after which a taxi can be taken for a 2 h drive to Bangsal harbour where local boats to the Gili Islands await during daylight hours.
*Fast boats depart daily from Padang Bai (Southeast Bali), Serangan (South Bali) and Amed (North East Bali) with an average crossing time between 1.5 and 2.5 hours.

== Earthquake disaster ==

The August 2018 Lombok earthquake killed 20 people and injured hundreds more, the earthquake caused significant damage to Lombok island and was the foreshock of a larger earthquake that followed 8 days later. The August 2018 Lombok earthquake occurred on August 5, 2018 and had a moment magnitude of 6.9 and caused catastrophic damage to North Lombok and also caused damage to nearby Bali, The earthquake caused up to 563 deaths and injured hundreds more.

The Gili Islands escaped the worst of the damage, which was mostly concentrated in the North of Lombok, however there was significant structural damage to property on the islands causing debris and wounding many. Many of the tourism businesses on the Gili Islands had commuting employees, living in Lombok, who were severely affected, losing family members, homes and more. Once the dust had settled, it took a while for the Indonesian Government to prepare and send aid. The Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management refused international aid, claiming &quot;earthquakes did not constitute a national emergency&quot; and that they were capable enough to respond without help. However, the infrastructure for disaster management and relief was not adequately in place in and around Lombok, resulting in acute delays during the aftermath. Therefore, the first responders to the disaster were stretched local government agencies such as police &amp; military personnel, domestic volunteers and business owners in the Gili islands and the parts of Lombok that were less affected by the quakes. These organised small scale international fundraising initiatives through social networks and the web to help source &amp; acquire much needed basic resources such as food &amp; clean water, and shortly thereafter begin assisting with temporary and permanent shelter. This was vital in the early stages of the disaster, before larger scale government assistance arrived.

<text>The Karamanlides (; ), also known as Karamanli Greeks or simply Karamanlis, are a traditionally Turkish-speaking Greek Orthodox people native to the region of Karaman in Anatolia.

Some scholars regard Karamanlides as the Turkish-speaking Greeks from Karaman, though their exact ethnic origin is disputed; they could either be descendants of Byzantine Greeks who were linguistically Turkified, or of Christian Turkic soldiers who settled in the region after the Turkic conquests, or even both. The Karamanlides were forced to leave Anatolia during the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Today, a majority of the population live in Greece and have fully integrated into Greek society.

== Language ==
Writers and speakers of Karamanli Turkish were expelled from Turkey as part of the Greek-Turkish population exchange of 1923. Some speakers preserved their language in the diaspora.
A fragment of a manuscript written in Karamanli was also found in the Cairo Geniza.

== Origins ==

The origin of the Karamanlides is disputed; they are either descendants of Byzantine Greeks who were linguistically Turkified after being pressured through a gradual process of assimilation by the Ottomans, or of Turkic soldiers who settled in the region after the Turkic conquests and converted to Christianity. Greek scholars incline to the view that the Karamanlides were of Greek descent and adopted Turkish as their vernacular, either by force or as a result of their isolation from the Greek-speaking Orthodox Christians of the coastal regions. Turkish scholars regard them as the descendants of Turks who had migrated to Byzantine territories before the conquest or had served as mercenaries in the Byzantine armies and who had adopted the religion but not the language of their new rulers. Another theory supports that the Karamanlides may have been a mixture of Anatolian Greeks and Christian Turks. There is not enough evidence to prove how the early Karamanlides identified themselves.

Partial or full Turkification of Anatolian Greeks dates back to the early 1100s, as a result of living together with neighboring Turks. Oriental and Latin sources indicate that Greek-Turkish bilingualism was common in Anatolia in the 13th and 14th centuries, and by the early 15th century it was very widespread. Furthermore, an anonymous Latin account from 1437 states that Greek bishops and metropolitans in Anatolia, were &quot;dressed in the Muslim style and spoke Turkic&quot;; &quot;although the liturgy was still read in Greek the sermons were pronounced in Turkic.&quot; Daniel Panzac elaborates that &#x27;Karaman Greeks&#x27; became fully linguistically and culturally Turkified during the reign of Murad III (), and some of them had also converted to Islam. Karamanlides could be descendants of those Turkified Greeks.

The Ottoman explorer Evliya Çelebi, who visited the Karamanlides and experienced their lifestyle, wrote that they spoke with an authentic Turkish accent but used Greek and Latin words as well. They printed books, particularly the bible, in Turkish language and chanted hymns in Karamanlidika, despite their neighborhoods also having Greek-speaking communities. The British historian Arnold J. Toynbee (1889–1975) emphasized that there was no definite answer to the question of their origins.

The German traveler Hans Dernschwam (1494–1568/69) encountered the Karamanlides living in Istanbul during his travel throughout Anatolia in 1553–1555; he described them as &quot;a Christian folk of the Greek faith whom Selim I had transplanted from the emirate of Karamania.&quot; The Armenian historian Eremia Chelebi (1637–1695), also stated that Karamanlides lived around and within the city walls of Istanbul, and despite being Greek, they did not know Greek and spoke only Turkish. A Karamanlis author named Mauromates (1656–1740) wrote that the Greek language was replaced by Turkish in Anatolia, and were thus unable to read the &quot;masterpieces of Greek literature.&quot; Another Karamanlis author named Iosepos Moesiodax, wrote in his &quot;Paedagogy&quot; (1779) that &quot;the need of our public demands good Turkish, because it is the dialect of our Rulers.&quot; The English writer William Martin Leake (1777–1860), who travelled in Konya in 1800, wrote:

The German orientalist Franz Taeschner (1888–1967) observed that the Karamanlides were completely Turkified, with the exception of their religion. The British historian Edwin Pears (1835–1919), who lived in Turkey for approximately 40 years, wrote that the Karamanlides were originally Greeks, who had lost their native language and spoke Turkish. Robert Pinkerton (1780–1859) stated that the Turkish oppression had made them adopt the Turkish language:

Similarly, the British scholar David George Hogarth (1862–1927) attributed the Turkification of the Karamanlides to oppression; in 1890 while visiting Lake Eğirdir, he wrote that &quot;the Moslems were eating them up.&quot;

British Archaeologist Richard MacGillivray Dawkins traveled between the Karamanlides and Bithynia between 1909–1911. Dawkins came to İzmit and Bursa regions after this trip and stated that there are Turkish-speaking Greek villages here. According to him, the Greek spoken here was very close to the language spoken by the Karamanlides. Even Dawkins stated that their language was Asiatic and showed different features from Greek. It is known that some Karamanlides lived in İznik as well as Bursa, İzmit and Yalova, and they left Turkish inscriptions written in Greek letters.

== Population exchange between Greece and Turkey ==
Many Karamanlides were forced to leave their homes during the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Estimates place the number of Turkish-speaking Orthodox Christians expelled from central and southern Anatolia at around 100,000. 

The Turkish government considered cutting a deal for Turkish-speaking Christians to be exempt from the population exchange. At the end however, it was decided that religion would be the only criterion of the exchange. Greek political elites saw no harm in taking in more Greek Orthodox Christians, but Turkish political elites remained fearful that the Karamanlides&#x27; loyalty to the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate would eventually undercut efforts to consolidate state control in the poor and underdeveloped region of Karaman. Only Papa Eftim (born ), who was an ardent Turkish nationalist and the creator of the Turkish Orthodox Church was allowed to remain in Anatolia. Upon their arrival in Greece, Karamanlides faced many instances of discrimination by the local Greek population &quot;because they spoke the language of the age-old enemy of Hellenism&quot;; sometimes even taunted with the allegation that they were of Turkish background. By the 1980s, they were well integrated into Greek society.

== Culture ==
The distinct culture that developed among the Karamanlides blended elements of Orthodox Christianity with a Turkish-Anatolian culture that characterized their willingness to accept and immerse themselves in foreign customs. From the 14th to the 19th centuries, they enjoyed an explosion in literary refinement. Karamanlides authors were especially productive in philosophy, religious writings, novels, and historical texts. Their lyrical poetry in the late 19th century describes their indifference to both Greek and Turkish governments, and the confusion which they felt as a Turkish-speaking people with a Greek Orthodox religion.

<text>Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor or Isaac Elhanan Spector (; 1817 - March 6, 1896) was a Russian rabbi, &quot;posek&quot; and Talmudist of the 19th century.

== Early life ==

Spektor was born in Ros&#x27;, Belarus (Yiddish: Rosh), then part of the Grodno Governorate of the Russian Empire. His father, Israel Issar, rabbi of Resh and Yitzchak Elchanan&#x27;s first teacher, leaned toward Hasidism. Yitzchak Elchanan studied Talmud and at the age of thirteen he married, and settled with his wife&#x27;s parents in Vilkovisk, where he remained for six years. He was for a short time the pupil of Elijah Schick, and later he studied under Benjamin Diskin, rabbi of Vilkovisk and was the fellow student of Diskin&#x27;s son Joshua Leib Diskin, afterward rabbi of Brisk.

Spektor received his &quot;semikhah&quot; (rabbinic ordination) from Benjamin Diskin and from R. Isaac Ḥaber of Tiktin (later of Suwałki). His wife&#x27;s 300 rubles dowry was lost in the bankruptcy of his debtor. In 1837 Spector became rabbi of the small adjacent town of Sabelin, with a weekly salary of five zlotys. He remained there for about two years, when he went to Karlin and introduced himself to R. Jacob of that town (author of &quot;Mishkenot Ya&#x27;aḳob&quot;), who recommended him to the community of Baresa (Biaroza), where Spektor became the town&#x27;s rabbi in 1839 with a salary of one ruble a week.

== Rabbinical positions ==

In 1846, Spektor was chosen as rabbi of Nishvez, Minsk Governorate, but the community of Baresa was unwilling to let him go, and he left the town at night. He was paid four rubles a week, and when he accepted the rabbinate of Novohrodok (Kovno Governorate) in 1851 he secretly fled Nishvez at night, as he had left Baresa. He stayed in Novohrodok until 1864, when he was appointed chief rabbi of Kovno, a post he held until his death.

In 1857 he was the youngest member of a committee of rabbis chosen to regulate the management of the Volozhin yeshiva. In 1868, he headed a committee to help the poor during a drought which almost produced a famine, and he allowed the temporary use of peas and beans that year during the Passover, when they are normally forbidden by Ashkenazic rabbis. In 1875, he decided against the use of the Corfu Citron as &quot;Etrog&quot;, because of the high price at the time. In 1879 he arranged, through Prof. A. Harkavy, his former pupil, that three rabbis, Reuben of Dünaburg, Lipa Boslansky of Mir, and Elijah Eliezer Grodzenski of Vilna, should be added to the official rabbinical commission, which had hitherto consisted entirely of men of affairs and secular scholars.

== Relations with the Russian government ==

Together with Yisrael Salanter, he was active in opposing the anti-semitic decrees of the Russian government. Spektor visited St. Petersburg twice to take part in conferences held there on the situation of the Jews after the riots of 1881. He successfully opposed the proposed establishment of a new rabbinical school like those in Vilna and Zhitomir, but failed to induce the government to recognize the synagogue rabbis instead of the government rabbis as the heads of Jewish communities.

In 1889, Spektor was elected an honorary member of the Society for the Promotion of Culture Among the Jews of Russia, whose philosophy he said was compatible with traditional Judaism. He identified with the traditional rabbinate but refrained from any confrontation with the young Haskala movement.

In 1889, Spektor opposed the proposed celebration of his rabbinical jubilee. He failed to save the Volozhin yeshiva from being closed by the government, but sponsored the &quot;Kovnoer Perushim&quot; as a substitute. He participated in the Kovno kollel and the Hovevei Zion movement. He was the anonymous friend who influenced Samson Raphael Hirsch in 1884 to write &quot;Ueber die Beziehung des Talmuds zum Judenthum&quot;, a defense of Talmudic literature against anti-Semitic slanders in Russia.

Spektor died at Kovno on 6 March 1896. Institutions named after him include Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary (RIETS, part of Yeshiva University) and the Knesses Beis Yitzchok Kaminetz of Baruch Ber Leibowitz. He had a daughter and three sons including Hirsch Rabinovich, who was &quot;maggid&quot; (preacher) of Vilna and later succeeded his father as rabbi of Kovno.

<doc id="1268981" wikidata="Q1364783" url="?curid=1268981" title="Sleep hygiene">
<text>Sleep hygiene is a behavioral and environmental practice developed in the late 1970s as a method to help people with mild to moderate insomnia. Clinicians assess the sleep hygiene of people with insomnia and other conditions, such as depression, and offer recommendations based on the assessment. Sleep hygiene recommendations include establishing a regular sleep schedule, using naps with care, not exercising physically (or mentally) too close to bedtime, limiting worry, limiting exposure to light in the hours before sleep, getting out of bed if sleep does not come, not using bed for anything but sleep and sex, avoiding alcohol (as well as nicotine, caffeine, and other stimulants) in the hours before bedtime, and having a peaceful, comfortable and dark sleep environment.

However, , the empirical evidence for the effectiveness of sleep hygiene is &quot;limited and inconclusive&quot; for the general population and for the treatment of insomnia, despite being the oldest treatment for insomnia. A systematic review by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine concluded that clinicians should not prescribe sleep hygiene for insomnia due to the evidence of absence of its efficacy and potential delaying of adequate treatment, recommending instead that effective therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia should be preferred.

==Assessment==
Assessing sleep hygiene is important to determine whether an individual has inadequate sleep hygiene disorder. The diagnostic assessment is usually conducted using clinical interview and supplemented by self-report questionnaires and sleep diaries, which are typically kept from one to two weeks, to record a representative sample data. There are also computerized assessments such as the Sleep-EVAL system, which can be employed in the diagnostic process. It features 1,543 possible questions automatically selected according to the individual&#x27;s previous answers.

Practice of sleep hygiene and knowledge of sleep hygiene practices can be assessed with measures such as the Sleep Hygiene Index, Sleep Hygiene Awareness and Practice Scale, or the Sleep Hygiene Self-Test. For younger individuals, sleep hygiene can be assessed by the Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale, the Children&#x27;s Sleep Hygiene Scale, or Tayside children&#x27;s sleep questionnaire.

==Recommendations==
Clinicians choose among recommendations for improving sleep quality for each individual and counselling is presented as a form of patient education.

===Sleep schedule===
One set of recommendations relates to the timing of sleep. For adults, getting less than 7–8 hours of sleep is associated with a number of physical and mental health deficits, and therefore a top sleep hygiene recommendation is allowing enough time for sleep. Clinicians will frequently advise that these hours of sleep be obtained at night instead of through napping, because while naps can be helpful after sleep deprivation, under normal conditions naps may be detrimental to nighttime sleep. Negative effects of napping on sleep and performance have been found to depend on duration and timing, with shorter midday naps being the least disruptive. There is also focus on the importance of awakening around the same time every morning and generally having a regular sleep schedule.

===Activities===
Exercise is an activity that can facilitate or inhibit sleep quality; people who exercise experience better quality of sleep than those who do not, but exercising too late in the day can be activating and delay falling asleep. Increasing exposure to bright and natural light during the daytime and avoiding bright light in the hours before bedtime may help promote a sleep-wake schedule aligned with nature&#x27;s daily light-dark cycle.

Activities that reduce physiological arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed has been shown to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised to get out of bed and try something else for a brief amount of time.

Generally, for people experiencing difficulties with sleep, spending less time in bed results in deeper and more continuous sleep, so clinicians will frequently recommend eliminating use of the bed for any activities except sleep or sex.

===Foods and substances===
A number of foods and substances have been found to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one&#x27;s quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions of sleep due to urination.

===Sleep environment===
Arranging a sleep environment that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures have been shown to disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.

Light exposure when sleeping has been shown to cause ocular fatigue.

In 2015, a systematic review of studies on mattresses concluded that medium-firm, custom-inflated mattresses were best for pain and neutral spinal alignment.

==Effectiveness==
Sleep hygiene studies use different sets of sleep hygiene recommendations, and the evidence that improving sleep hygiene improves sleep quality is weak and inconclusive . Most research on sleep hygiene principles has been conducted in clinical settings, and there is a need for more research on non-clinical populations.

The strength of research support for each recommendation varies; some of the more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.

There is support showing positive sleep outcomes for people who follow more than one sleep hygiene recommendation. There is however no evidence that poor sleep hygiene can contribute to insomnia.

While there is inconclusive evidence that sleep hygiene alone is effective as a treatment for insomnia, some research studies have shown improvement in insomnia for patients who receive sleep hygiene education in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy practices.

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine released in 2021 a meta-analysis on behavioral therapies concluding that they &quot;did not favor the use of sleep hygiene as a stand-alone therapy for chronic insomnia&quot; since &quot;recent evidence shows that it is no longer supported as a single-component therapy&quot;. They further recommend educating clinicians and patients to avoid the recommendation of sleep hygiene as this can cause a &quot;delayed implementation of effective therapies with continued or worsening insomnia symptoms&quot; and furthermore may demotivate patients from &quot;undergoing other treatments based on their experience using an ineffective intervention&quot;. It was also impossible to conduct a network analysis of the efficacy of specific items of sleep hygiene due to the wide heterogeneity and lack of systematic reporting of content and delivery methods.

==Special populations==
Sleep hygiene is a central component of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Specific sleep disorders may require other or additional treatment approaches, and continuing difficulties with sleep may require additional assistance from healthcare providers.

College students are at risk of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may be likely to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, researchers recommend sleep hygiene education on college campuses. Harvard University, for example, requires all incoming first-year undergraduates to take a short online course on the subject before the fall semester begins.

Similarly, shift workers have difficulty maintaining a healthy sleep-wake schedule due to night or irregular work hours. Shift workers need to be strategic about napping and drinking caffeine, as these practices may be necessary for work productivity and safety, but should be timed carefully. Because shift workers may need to sleep while other individuals are awake, additional sleeping environment changes should include reducing disturbances by turning off phones and posting signs on bedroom doors to inform others when they are sleeping.

Additionally, Socioeconomic status often determines access to care leading to a downward trajectory in health. Those with lower SES have limited access to quality living conditions. Economic status can contribute to tremendous stress. Sleep is the primary mechanism in biological and psychosocial stressors that can help one recover from moderate stress. However, the stress level will affect the brain by disrupting the circadian cycle, meaning that more stress will lead to more sleep disturbances. The data points to an inverse relationship: lower SES will result in insufficient sleep and a decline in sleep quality compared to high SES. Light and noise will significantly impact one&#x27;s sleeping patterns. Exposure to light will disrupt the body&#x27;s natural circadian rhythm. In low SES populations, irregular and long work hours may force an individual to attempt to sleep during the day. This will significantly disrupt the physiological benefits that come from sleep. Additionally, urban neighborhoods will likely have greater night noise, crime, and violence. In these neighborhoods, the body will be in a constant state of survival, releasing cortisol and adrenaline, which interfere with sleep.

Due to symptoms of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may be likely to have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression and circadian rhythm disturbances. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, but it also has been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.

Individuals with breathing difficulties due to asthma or allergies may experience additional barriers to quality sleep that can be addressed by specific variations of sleep hygiene recommendations. Difficulty with breathing can cause disruptions to sleep, reducing the ability to stay asleep and to achieve restful sleep. For individuals with allergies or asthma, additional considerations must be given to potential triggers in the bedroom environment. Medications that might improve ability to breathe while sleeping may also impair sleep in other ways, so there must be careful management of decongestants, asthma controllers, and antihistamines.

==Implementation==
Sleep hygiene strategies include advice about timing of sleep and food intake in relationship to exercise and sleeping environment. Recommendations depend on knowledge of the individual situation; counselling is presented as a form of patient education.

As attention to the role of sleep hygiene in promoting public health has grown, there has been an increase in the number of resources available in print and on the internet. Organizations running public health initiatives include the National Sleep Foundation and the Division of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, both of which have created public websites with sleep hygiene resources, such as tips for sleep hygiene, instructional videos, sleep hygiene self-assessments, poll statistics on sleep hygiene, and tools to find sleep professionals. A cooperative agreement between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine was established in 2013 to coordinate the National Healthy Sleep Awareness Project, with one of their aims being to promote sleep hygiene awareness.

Long and irregular work hours contribute to the sleep health disparity in the US. Local governments could regulate business hours for those that employ high rates of low-income families. Additionally, access to care is often determined by that individual&#x27;s occupation. Clinicians in the communities should advocate insurance coverage and access to care for sleep-related services. Telemedicine is a promising approach proposed to reduce barriers to sleep health care. This eliminates transportation challenges for underserved populations and is more cost-effective. Actigraphy can provide a cost-effective method to diagnose sleeping disorders. Neighborhoods can be improved by updating urban planning. Noise population can be reduced by promoting walkability among communities. Walkability is only possible when neighborhood safety is optimized.

==History==
Some of the concepts of sleep hygiene first appeared in a book by Paolo Mantegazza published in 1864.

The term &quot;sleep hygiene&quot; was first introduced in 1939 by Nathaniel Kleitman. In 1977, a book entitled &quot;No More Sleepless Nights&quot; by psychologist Peter Hauri introduced the concept within the context of modern sleep medicine. In this book Hauri outlined a list of behavioral rules intended to promote improved sleep. The 1990 publication of the &quot;International Classification of Sleep Disorders&quot; (ICSD) introduced the diagnostic category Inadequate Sleep Hygiene. Inadequate sleep hygiene was a subclassification of Chronic Insomnia Disorder in the ICSD-II published in 2005; it was removed from the 2014 ICSD-III along with two other classifications. The term “chronic insomnia disorder” is used for all subtypes of chronic insomnia and inadequate sleep hygiene is no longer required to diagnose any sleep disorder, including insomnia and insufficient sleep syndrome.

Specific sleep hygiene recommendations have changed over time. For example, advice to simply avoid sleeping pills was included in early sets of recommendations, but as more drugs to help with sleep have been introduced, recommendations concerning their use have become more complex.

<text>The Chronicle Herald is a broadsheet newspaper published in Halifax, Nova Scotia, owned by Postmedia Network.

==History==

===Early years===
Founded in 1874 as &quot;The Morning Herald&quot;, the paper quickly became one of Halifax&#x27;s main newspapers. The same company also owned the &quot;Evening Mail&quot;, which was published in the afternoon. Its main competitors were the &quot;Chronicle&quot; in the morning, and the &quot;Star&quot; in the afternoon. By 1949 the papers had merged to become &quot;The Chronicle-Herald&quot; and &quot;Mail-Star&quot; respectively. 

===Graham Dennis era===
Graham W. Dennis took over as publisher of the newspaper in 1954, at age 26, after the death of his father, senator William Henry Dennis, who in turn had succeeded senator William Dennis in running the paper. He led the newspaper for the next half century. Dennis was proud of the paper&#x27;s independence and rebuffed numerous offers to buy it. He was known as a humanistic employer interested in the welfare of his employees, stating that his proudest moment was the introduction of a pension plan for &quot;Herald&quot; staff. He had a reputation as an &quot;old-school media baron&quot; who set up bureaus across Canada and even one in London, England. Dennis considered the paper essential to effecting positive change in Nova Scotia and ensured that it was available across the province.

In 1998 the company began producing a Sunday edition called &quot;The Sunday Herald&quot;, which ran until April 20, 2013. In 2004 &quot;The Chronicle-Herald&quot; and &quot;Mail-Star&quot; were merged to form the single &quot;The Chronicle Herald&quot;. In January 2004, &quot;The Chronicle Herald&quot; became the first newspaper in Canada, and one of only several in the world, to operate a &quot;WIFAG&quot; offset press. This development led to an increased use of colour, and changes in font and styling.

In 2002 the historic &quot;Herald&quot; headquarters on Argyle Street was listed for sale for $15 million and sold by the Dennis family to the cable TV mogul Charles Keating. Keating died in 2005. In 2007 Argyle Developments Ltd. purchased the property from his estate. The &quot;Chronicle Herald&quot; moved in 2008 to one of the buildings on the ex-Maritime Life campus in Armdale. The former &quot;Herald&quot; buildings were demolished and the site was redeveloped as the Nova Centre, which houses the Halifax Convention Centre.

In October 2008, &quot;The Chronicle Herald&quot; was named one of &quot;Canada&#x27;s Top 100 Employers&quot; by Mediacorp Canada Inc., and was featured in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; newsmagazine.

On February 3, 2009, the paper laid off 24 employees, the first layoffs in the paper&#x27;s 136-year history. The cuts represented approximately one quarter of its newsroom staff, but it nonetheless remained the largest newsroom east of Montreal. These cuts impacted the production department where nine employees were laid off. The company stated that these layoffs were the result of a decline in advertising due to the distress of the current economic situation. 

===New management===
Sarah Dennis, daughter of owner Graham Dennis and vice-president since the 1990s, took over as CEO of the newspaper in November 2010. She married Mark Lever in August 2011. Graham Dennis, who ran the newspaper for more than 57 years, died on December 1, 2011, at the age of 84. Sarah Dennis inherited the paper. Lever took over as president and CEO in 2012.

Though the newspaper is profitable, Dennis and Lever have aggressively cut costs in recent years. Dennis holds a &quot;far less romantic view of the newspaper&quot; than her father did, a characteristic that journalist Stephen Kimber said has made cost-cutting easy. Dennis stated: &quot;It&#x27;s a business, and you have to run it like a business. The history is important, but you can&#x27;t let that determine what you do.&quot;

Shortly after taking over as CEO, Dennis championed the newspaper&#x27;s independence, stating: &quot;The fact that we&#x27;re not controlled by someone in Ontario makes a big difference in what we can do.&quot; She stated that the newspaper would remain independent as long as possible. However, following her father&#x27;s death Dennis stated that she would entertain offers from potential buyers.

Discord erupted in 2011 after the &quot;Herald&quot; wrote a new contract for freelance journalists that gave the newspaper rights to freelancers&#x27; work forever, without any payment for signing over the copyright. Numerous freelancers, including Ralph Surette and Silver Donald Cameron, refused to sign. Dennis stated that the newspaper was simply emulating what other newspapers across the country were doing.

The newspaper purchased Bounty Print, a commercial printing company, in 2011. In 2012 they purchased &quot;The Casket&quot;, a weekly newspaper published in Antigonish, through a Herald sister company, Brace Publishing Limited. The company also launched the glossy &quot;Herald Magazine&quot; in February 2012. It launched the &quot;Cape Breton Star&quot;, a weekly newspaper, in Cape Breton in May 2014.

Circulation has been in decline. In 2012 the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported circulation of 108,389 weekdays, 112,306 Saturdays and 97,190 Sundays In April 2012 the Sunday edition was discontinued as a cost-cutting measure and the Saturday paper was renamed &quot;Weekend&quot;. Still, in 2013, Sarah Dennis stated that the newspaper was profitable and that readership was at an all-time high. In September 2014, weekday circulation was estimated at 70,000, with the weekend edition selling 72,000. On-line subscriptions totaled 1,862.

In October 2014, the Herald issued layoff notices to 20 newsroom employees.

==2016–17 labour dispute==
===Strike and bargaining===
In February 2015, the &quot;Herald&quot; locked out its 13 unionized printing press workers, causing the first work stoppage in the company&#x27;s history. The lockout ended about a month later, after the union agreed to major concessions.

Less than a year later, on January 23, 2016, 61 members of the Halifax Typographical Union&#x27;s newsroom and news bureau staff went on strike. The Herald hired &quot;scab&quot; reporters as replacements. The &quot;Chronicle Herald&quot; refused any concessions offered by the union, and later on the striking staff launched a competing online newspaper called &quot;Local Xpress&quot;. By September 2016, the number of striking workers was down to 56 as some had sought new employment for financial reasons. 

The union criticized the &quot;Herald&quot; for spending more than $400,000 on security (as at September 2016) while demanding cuts in the newsroom, and stated that the real intention of management was to bust the union. The typographical union also accused Sarah Dennis of hiring private investigators to tail and intimidate picketers.

In September 2016 the &quot;Herald&quot; announced that it was shutting down the &quot;Cape Breton Star&quot; due to &quot;a prevailing headwind of union sympathy in industrial Cape Breton&quot;.

The union agreed to wage cuts and increased working hours equating to an hourly pay decrease of 17 per cent, layoffs of a third of unionized staff, a cap on severance pay, reductions in vacation time and mileage allowance, a 25 per cent lower starting wage, and elimination of the defined benefit pension plan founded by Graham Dennis. However, the dispute dragged on with no agreement being reached between the two parties. The newspaper was accused of making unreasonable demands with the aim of breaking the union, and hired lawyers advertising services in union-busting.

During a round of bargaining in October 2016, &quot;Herald&quot; made numerous additional demands, including further cuts to the union&#x27;s bargaining power, reduced sick leave pay, a further four per cent wage cut, eight more layoffs (amounting to a total of 26 layoffs), and the closure of &quot;Local Xpress&quot; and the signing-over of all &quot;Local Xpress&quot; content to the &quot;Herald&quot;. In November 2016 the union filed a complaint with the Nova Scotia Labour Board accusing the &quot;Herald&quot; management of &quot;bargaining in a manner designed to end union representation&quot;, preventing an agreement from being reached.

As a result of this strike, CEO Mark Lever won the labour news website rankandfile.ca&#x27;s annual &quot;Scumbag of the Year&quot; award for 2016. It was the second time in three years a Nova Scotian won this award.

===Strikebreakers and quality issues===
Throughout the strike, the Halifax Typographical Union used social media to draw light to typographical and factual errors that plagued the paper since the strike began, and alleged that these quality issues were a result of using inexperienced &quot;scab&quot; staff. In addition, the union and others lambasted the strikebreakers for questionable journalistic practices.

The use of strikebreakers is banned in many countries, but Quebec is the only jurisdiction within Canada that outlaws the practice. Several faculty members at the University of King&#x27;s College, which is well-regarded for its journalism program, advised graduating students against crossing the picket line. The &quot;Herald&quot; approached several King&#x27;s students and were rebuffed.

Investigative journalist Tim Bousquet, of the &quot;Halifax Examiner&quot;, questioned the newspaper&#x27;s practice of printing advertorial content nearly indistinguishable from regular news. Similarly, the union pointed out instances of the &quot;scab &quot;Herald&quot;&quot; reprinting press releases nearly verbatim. Of the quality of the newspaper during the strike, Bousquet wrote: &quot;Without the professional journalists, the paper is crap [...] The Herald has zero credibility. And the complete abandonment of any journalistic standards is showing in spades.&quot;

Alex Boutilier of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; spoke out after the &quot;Herald&quot; reprinted one of his articles and attributed it to his name only, with no mention of the &quot;Star&quot;, making it appear as though he was writing as a strikebreaker. Boutilier stated that he could not find the piece on The Canadian Press news wire while Bousquet commented that aside from the &quot;Star&quot;, the &quot;Herald&quot; appears to have been the only other newspaper to print the story. The &quot;Herald&quot; subsequently removed his byline from the online edition.

===Chebucto Heights controversy===
Controversy surrounding an article published 8 April 2016 online (appearing in print on 9 April) made national headlines. The story alleged that Syrian refugee children attending Chebucto Heights Elementary School were &quot;choking, pushing, slapping and verbally abusing their fellow classmates&quot;. The paper was widely condemned as the story was unverified, having been based on a sole anonymous source, and was written with a highly sensational tone that alleged acts of &quot;brutality&quot; by children as young as five. It was published anonymously, lacking any byline, and was picked up by right-wing media abroad to bolster anti-refugee sentiment.

The superintendent of the Halifax Regional School Board, Elwin LeRoux, stated that he was &quot;deeply offended to see the school represented so inaccurately&quot;. LeRoux stated that the school board had investigated the allegations and had come up empty-handed.

In the face of public outcry the newspaper tweaked the article online, removing some details before deleting it from the &quot;Herald&quot; website altogether on Monday morning. The paper published an editor&#x27;s note that admitted the story &quot;needed more work&quot;. In the wake of the controversy award-winning non-union columnist Lezlie Lowe quit the newspaper in protest, stating in her farewell column that &quot;The story lays bare the worst of the worst xenophobia in our city and our province. It lacks all proportion. Balance eludes it, start to finish.&quot;

=== Regional expansion ===
On 13 April 2017, Transcontinental announced that it had sold all of its newspapers in Atlantic Canada to SaltWire Network, a newly formed parent company of the &quot;Herald&quot;.

The Halifax Typographical Union called the purchase evidence that the &quot;Herald&quot;″s claim of impending financial collapse was a &quot;total fabrication&quot;. The president of CWA Canada also weighed in, stating of the ongoing labour dispute: &quot;This has never been about money. It has been about power and union busting.&quot;

=== Government inquiry and conclusion===
On 13 July 2017, the Department of Labour and Advanced Education announced that it was setting up an Industrial Inquiry Commission, under the provisions of the province&#x27;s Trade Union Act, to force mediation between the union and the &quot;Herald&quot; management from 4 August 2017. A union spokesperson called the move &quot;long overdue&quot; while the &quot;Herald&quot;″s chief operating officer called the announcement &quot;puzzling&quot;.

The dispute finally ended in August 2017 when the union voted to ratify a new eight-year deal. The agreement included an increase in the work week from 35 to 37.5 hours, the dismissal of 26 union staff (with 25 returning to the newspaper and one moving to Cape Breton), and wage cuts.

== Circulation ==
&quot;The Chronicle Herald&quot; has seen like most Canadian daily newspapers a decline in circulation. Its total circulation dropped by percent to 91,490 copies daily from 2009 to 2015.
&quot;The Chronicle Herald&quot; is the highest circulation newspaper in the Atlantic provinces, although it briefly lost that title to the now-defunct 
&quot;StarMetro Halifax&quot; (formerly &quot;Metro Halifax&quot;).

<doc id="1268986" wikidata="Q2604309" url="?curid=1268986" title="Goals against average">
<text>Goals against average (GAA) also known as &quot;average goals against&quot; or &quot;AGA&quot; is a statistic used in field hockey, ice hockey, lacrosse, soccer, and water polo that is the mean of goals allowed per game by a goaltender or goalkeeper (depending on sport). GAA is analogous to a baseball pitcher&#x27;s earned run average (ERA). In Japanese, the same translation (防御率) is used for both GAA and ERA, because of this.

For ice hockey, the goals against average statistic is the number of goals a goaltender allows per 60 minutes of playing time. It is calculated by taking the number of goals against, multiplying that by 60 (minutes) and then dividing by the number of minutes played. The modification is used by the NHL since 1965 and the IIHF since 1990. When calculating GAA, overtime goals and time on ice are included, whereas empty net and shootout goals are not. It is typically given to two decimal places.

The top goaltenders in the National Hockey League have a GAA of about 1.85-2.10, although the measure of a good GAA changes as different playing styles come and go. The top goaltenders in the National Lacrosse League however, have a GAA of about 10.00, and the top 2005 Western Lacrosse Association goaltenders had a GAA of about 9.00. At their best, elite NCAA water polo goalies have a GAA between 3.00 and 5.00.

Since the statistic is highly dependent on the team playing in front of a goalie, save percentage is usually considered a more accurate measure of a goaltender&#x27;s skill, especially in ice hockey and lacrosse, as it takes into account the number of shots the goaltender has faced. In soccer, since it is considered a part of the goalkeeper&#x27;s job to coach defenders on proper positioning to prevent opponents&#x27; shots, GAA is more commonly used to evaluate goalkeepers than save percentage.

<doc id="1268992" wikidata="Q1267331" url="?curid=1268992" title="Durham Wasps">
<text>The Durham Wasps were an ice hockey team located in Durham and was one of England&#x27;s most well-known names in ice hockey. The team was bought by Sir John Hall and moved to the neighbouring city of Newcastle Upon Tyne in August 1996. The Newcastle team, after several changes became known as the Newcastle Jesters.

==The History of the Wasps==

The Durham Wasps began their prosperous start to hockey just after the war, and were started by Michael Davey of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, along with a few other Canadians, who after the war made their homes in Durham.

Ice hockey remained popular in the sixties and seventies, but it exploded with popularity between the eighties and nineties, and the period from around 1982 to 1992 was one to remember for the Wasps. In this period alone they won the Heineken Championship four times, the league championship six times, the Norwich Cup three times, and other trophies like the Autumn and Castle Eden Cups on many other occasions. The Durham Wasps dominated the British League for over 10 years. There was an intense local rivalry with both the Whitley Warriors and the Billingham Bombers. It was a golden period for hockey in the North East with derby matches against the Warriors often resulting in crowds which exceeded the stated capacity of the rink by a considerable margin.

With the rise of teams such as the Cardiff Devils and Sheffield Steelers, the Wasps started to struggle to fund a competitive team. At the same time, the rink was in need of significant investment. Around this time, John Hall, then owner of Newcastle United Football Club, laid plans to form a centre of sporting excellence in Newcastle. As part of this he purchased the team with the intention of moving them to a new ice rink in Newcastle. In the meanwhile, the team temporarily played out of the Crowtree Leisure Centre in Sunderland.

This proved very divisive amongst Wasps fans with many to this day refusing to watch ice hockey in Newcastle. A replacement team was established in Durham called the Durham City Wasps who played in the English League. This featured some players who the new Wasps owners decided not to retain, as well as players from the junior teams. Unfortunately the team only lasted one season before the costs of maintaining the rink came to a head and the rink was sold to be redeveloped.

The plans for a new rink in Newcastle came to nothing so a deal was made which resulted in the Whitley Warriors being evicted from the Telewest Arena to make way for the team. After a season of playing out of Crowtree, Wasps were taken to Newcastle and renamed the Newcastle Cobras. In the next few years they changed owners and names from the Cobras, to the Riverkings, to the Jesters, however, the franchise folded soon after.

A new unrelated team, the Newcastle Vipers were founded in 2002 to keep the city&#x27;s ice hockey heritage alive, but due to low crowds and problems getting regular ice time at the Arena, in November 2010 the Vipers were forced to move in with the &#x27;old enemy&#x27; and play for part of their final season out of the Hillheads rink in Whitley Bay. It proved impossible to keep the team going and the 2010/11 season was the last featuring a Newcastle team.

==Revival Games==
Originally a one-off game, former Durham Wasps players from the 80s and 90s reformed to play former local rivals Whitley Warriors on 4 May 2008 at Whitley Bay Ice Rink, commemorating the 60th anniversary of the formation of the club, and in support of the ongoing campaign to bring back an ice rink. Over 2,300 fans turned up to witness this encounter which saw Wasps players icing once again including the Johnson brothers, Mario Belanger, Ivor Bennett, Stephen Foster, John Hutley and Karl Walker. The reformed Wasps team won the game 8–4.

A second &#x27;Legends&#x27; game was played with Whitley Warriors, Sunday 6 May 2012, again at Whitley Bay, and in memory of former Durham Wasps manager Kenny Swinburne. The Wasps won 5–2 with Mario Belanger scoring within 30 seconds in the first period.

<doc id="1268993" wikidata="Q423487" url="?curid=1268993" title="Glottal stop (letter)">
<text>ʔ , called glottal stop, is an alphabetic letter in some Latin alphabets, most notably in several languages of Canada where it indicates a glottal stop sound. Such usage derives from phonetic transcription, for example the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), that use this letter for the glottal stop sound. The letter derives graphically from use of the apostrophe or the symbol ʾ for glottal stop.
==Graphic variants==
Where is not available, not being in the basic Latin alphabet, it is sometimes replaced by a question mark , which is its official representation in the SAMPA transcription scheme. In Skwomesh or Squamish, may be replaced by the digit (see image).

In Unicode, four graphic variants of the glottal stop letter are available.

* Unicase () is provided for the International Phonetic Alphabet and Americanist phonetic notation. It is found in a number of orthographies that use the IPA/APA symbol, such as those of several Salishan languages. 
* A case pair, uppercase () and lowercase (), is provided for the orthographies of Athabaskan languages in the Northwest Territories. Uppercase may be slightly wider than unicase in fonts that distinguish them. 
* Superscript () that is used in Cayuga, the IPA and the Uralic Phonetic Alphabet.

===Other notations===
Other common symbols for the glottal stop sound are variants of the punctuation mark apostrophe that was the historical basis of the glottal stop letters. These include the 9-shaped modifier letter apostrophe, , which is probably the most common (and the direct ancestor of ), the 6-shaped ʻokina of Hawaiian, , and the straight-apostrophe shaped saltillo of many languages of Mexico, which has the case forms .

==Usage==
===Technical transcription===
* Americanist phonetic notation and the International Phonetic Alphabet—unicase ʔ or superscript ˀ
* Transcription of Australian Aboriginal languages—occasionally unicase ʔ
* Uralic Phonetic Alphabet—superscript ˀ only

===Vernacular orthographies===
* Languages of Canada
** Chipewyan—uppercase Ɂ and lowercase ɂ
** Dogrib—uppercase Ɂ and lowercase ɂ
** Kootenai—unicase ʔ
** Musqueam language—unicase ʔ
** Nootka—unicase ʔ
** Slavey—uppercase Ɂ and lowercase ɂ
** Nitinaht—unicase ʔ
** Thompson—unicase ʔ
** Lushootseed—unicase ʔ
** Squamish language, where it is sometimes represented with .
** Tuscarora—uppercase Ɂ and lowercase ɂ
* Cameroon
** Mendankwe-Nkwen—uppercase Ɂ and lowercase ɂ
* Côte d’Ivoire
** Abidji—unicase ʔ
** Cebaara—unicase ʔ
** Nyarafolo—unicase ʔ
** Tagwana—unicase ʔ
* Mali
** Tamasheq—unicase ʔ
* Senegal
** Hassanya—unicase ʔ as uppercase and lowercase ʼ
** Laalaa—uppercase Ɂ and lowercase ʼ
== Computing codes ==
In Unicode 1.0, only the unicase and superscript variants were included. In version 4.1 (2005), an uppercase character was added, and the existing unicase character was redefined as its lowercase. Then, in version 5.0 (2006), it was decided to separate the cased and caseless usages by adding a dedicated lowercase letter. The IPA character is first from left, while the extended Latin alphabet characters are third and fourth from left.

<doc id="1269014" wikidata="Q1412592" url="?curid=1269014" title="File Control Block">
<text>A File Control Block (FCB) is a file system structure in which the state of an open file is maintained. A FCB is managed by the operating system, but it resides in the memory of the program that uses the file, not in operating system memory. This allows a process to have as many files open at one time as it wants, provided it can spare enough memory for an FCB per file.

The FCB originates from CP/M and is also present in most variants of DOS, though only as a backward compatibility measure in MS-DOS versions 2.0 and later. A full FCB is 36 bytes long; in early versions of CP/M, it was 33 bytes. This fixed size, which could not be increased without breaking application compatibility, led to the FCB&#x27;s eventual demise as the standard method of accessing files.

The meanings of several of the fields in the FCB differ between CP/M and DOS, and also depending on what operation is being performed. The following fields have consistent meanings:
The 20-byte-long field starting at offset 0x0C contained fields which (among others) provided further information about the file:
Further values were used by newer versions of DOS until new information could no longer fit in these 20 bytes. Some preceding &quot;negative offset&quot; bytes were squeezed from reserved spaces in CP/M Zero Page and DOS Program Segment Prefix for storing file attributes.

==Usage==
In CP/M, 86-DOS and PC DOS 1.x/MS-DOS 1.xx, the FCB was the only method of accessing files. Under DOS a few INT 21h subfunctions provided the interface to operate on files using the FCB. When, with MS-DOS 2, preparations were made to support multiple processes or users, use other filesystems than FAT or to share files over networks in the future, FCBs were felt to be too small to handle the extra data required for such features and therefore FCBs were seen as inadequate for various future expansion paths. Also, they didn&#x27;t provide a field to specify sub-directories. Exposing file system related data to user-space was also seen as a security risk. FCBs were thus superseded by file handles, as used on UNIX and its derivatives. File handles are simply consecutive integer numbers associated with specific open files.

If a program uses the newer file handle API to open a file, the operating system will manage its internal data structure associated with that file in its own memory area. This has the great advantage that these structures can grow in size in later operating system versions without breaking compatibility with application programs; its disadvantage is that, given the rather simplistic memory management of DOS, space for as many of these structures as the most &quot;file-hungry&quot; program is likely to use has to be reserved at boot time and cannot be used for any other purpose while the computer is running. Such memory reservation is done using the FILES= directive in the CONFIG.SYS file. This problem does not occur with FCBs in DOS 1 or in CP/M, since the operating system stores all that it needs to know about an open file inside the FCB and thus does not need to use any per-file memory in operating system memory space. When using FCBs in MS-DOS 3 or later, the FCB format depends on whether SHARE.EXE is loaded and whether the FCB refers to a local or remote file and often refers to a SFT entry. Because of this, the number of FCBs which can be kept open at once in DOS 3 or higher is limited as well, usually to 4; using the FCBS= directive in the CONFIG.SYS file, it may be increased beyond that number if necessary. Under DR-DOS, both FILES and FCBS come from the same internal pool of available handles structures and are assigned dynamically as needed.

FCBs were supported in all versions of MS-DOS and Windows until the introduction of the FAT32 filesystem. Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me do not support the use of FCBs on FAT32 drives due to its 32-bit cluster numbers, except to read the volume label. This caused some old DOS applications, including WordStar, to fail under these versions of Windows.

The FCB interface does not work properly on Windows NT, 2000, etc. either – WordStar does not function properly on these operating systems. DOS emulators DOSEMU and DOSBox implement the FCB interface properly, thus they are a way to run older DOS programs that need FCBs on modern operating systems.

== Disk Transfer Area ==
A companion data structure used together with the FCB was the Disk Transfer Area (DTA). This is the name given to the buffer where file contents (records) would be read into/written from. File access functions in DOS that used the FCB assumed a fixed location for the DTA, initially pointing to a part of the PSP (see next section); this location could be changed by calling a DOS function, with subsequent file accesses implicitly using the new location.

With the deprecation of the FCB method, the new file access functions which used file handles also provided a means to specify a memory buffer for file contents with every function call, such that maintaining concurrent, independent buffers (either for different files or for the same file) became much more practical.

== Program Segment Prefix &amp; Program Initialisation ==
Every DOS executable started from the shell (COMMAND.COM) was provided with a pre-filled 256-byte long data structure called the &quot;Program Segment Prefix&quot; (PSP). Relevant fields within this structure include:
This data structure could be found at the beginning of the data segment whose address was provided by DOS at program start in the DS and ES segment registers. Besides providing the program&#x27;s command line verbatim at address 0x81, DOS also tried to construct two FCB&#x27;s corresponding to the first two words in the command line, the purpose being to save work for the programmer in the common case where these words were filenames to operate on. Since these FCB&#x27;s remained unopened, no problem would ensue even if these command line words did not refer to files.

The initial address for the DTA was set to overlay the area in the PSP (at address 0x80) where the command line arguments were stored, such that a program needed to parse this area for command line arguments before invoking DOS functions that made use of the DTA (such as reading in a file record), unless the program took care to change the address of the DTA to some other memory region (or not use the DTA/FCB functions altogether, which soon became deprecated in favour of file handles).

<text>In ice hockey, a shot on goal is a shot that directs the puck towards the net and either goes into the net for a goal or is stopped by the goaltender for a save.

A shot that is deflected wide or blocked by an opponent does not count as a shot on goal; it is recorded as a blocked shot. The player who blocks the shot is credited with a &#x27;blocked shot&#x27;, and the player who shoots the puck is credited with an &#x27;attempt blocked&#x27;.

Shots that sail wide or high of the net, and shots that hit the goalpost or crossbar but do not enter the net, are not counted as shots on goal; they are counted as &#x27;missed shots&#x27;. Additionally, if a goaltender stops a puck that is going wide or high anyway, it is recorded as a &#x27;missed shot&#x27;. Since it is not counted as a shot on goal, the goaltender does not get credit for a save.

An attempted shot that hits the pipe framing the goal mouth is not counted as a shot on goal, unless the puck goes into the goal without further contact from the team attempting the shot.

==Shots on net==
A shot on net is any touch of the puck towards the net, that if not for the goaltender intervening, would result in a goal.

Blocked shots do not count. If someone shoots the puck and it&#x27;s tipped, only the &quot;tip&quot; counts as a shot, and the original shot becomes a &quot;pass&quot;.

If a clearing attempt from the other team ends up on net it should be a shot on goal. If someone swats at a rebound and sends it toward the net it should be a shot on goal. Clearing attempts that end up on net should most definitely count and most scorers will count them.

In the case of a partially blocked shot, or a tipped shot that was on net and is tipped off net, these are not supposed to be counted as shots on goal, as only the &quot;final&quot; touch is a &quot;shot&quot; and the final touch sent those pucks wide.

Wrap arounds and stuff attempts can be an issue. If the goalie&#x27;s pad blocks a wrap around before he gets around far enough, then the puck would go &quot;across&quot; the crease instead of into the net. Therefore, it shouldn&#x27;t be regarded as a shot on goal.

<doc id="1269023" wikidata="Q2379429" url="?curid=1269023" title="Spin label">
<text>A spin label (SL) is an organic molecule which possesses an unpaired electron, usually on a nitrogen atom, and the ability to bind to another molecule. Spin labels are normally used as tools for probing proteins or biological membrane-local dynamics using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. The site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) technique allows one to monitor a specific region within a protein. In protein structure examinations, amino acid-specific SLs can be used.

The goal of spin labeling is somewhat similar to that of isotopic substitution in NMR spectroscopy. There one replaces an atom lacking a nuclear spin (and so is NMR-silent) with an isotope having a spin (and so is NMR-active). This technique is useful for tracking the chemical environment around an atom when full substitution with an NMR-active isotope is not feasible. Recently, spin-labelling has also been used to probe chemical local environment in NMR itself, in a technique known as Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement (PRE).

Recent developments in the theory and experimental measurement of PREs have enabled the detection, characterization and visualization of sparsely populated states of proteins and their complexes. Such states, which are invisible to conventional biophysical and structural techniques, play a key role in many biological processes including molecular recognition, allostery, macromolecular assembly and aggregation.

==Applications of spin EPR==
Spin labelled fatty acids have been extensively used to understand dynamic organization of lipids in bio-membranes and membrane biophysics. For example, stearic acid labelled with aminoxyl spin label moiety at various carbons (5, 7, 9, 12, 13, 14 and 16) with respect to first carbon of carbonyl group have been used to study the &quot;flexibility gradient&quot; of membrane lipids to understand membrane fluidity conditions at different depths of their lipid bilayer organization.

<doc id="1269024" wikidata="Q900944" url="?curid=1269024" title="Graham Cairns-Smith">
<text>Alexander Graham Cairns-Smith FRSE (24 November 1931 – 26 August 2016) was an organic chemist and molecular biologist at the University of Glasgow. He studied at the University of Edinburgh, where he gained a Ph.D. in Chemistry (1957). He was most famous for his controversial 1985 book &quot;Seven Clues to the Origin of Life&quot;.

The book popularized a hypothesis he began to develop in the mid-1960s—that self-replication of clay crystals in solution might provide a simple intermediate step between biologically inert matter and organic life. He inspired other ideas about chemical evolution, including the Miller–Urey experiment and the RNA World, all of which are hypotheses that have played important roles in attempts to understand the origin of life.

Cairns-Smith also published on the evolution of consciousness, in &quot;Evolving the Mind&quot; (1996), favoring a role for quantum mechanics in human thought. He died on 26 August 2016.

==Clay hypothesis==
The clay hypothesis suggests how biologically inert matter helped the evolution of early life forms: clay minerals form naturally from silicates in solution. Clay crystals, as other crystals, preserve their external formal arrangement as they grow, snap, and grow further. Clay crystal masses of a particular external form may happen to affect their environment in ways that affect their chances of further replication. For example, a &quot;stickier&quot; clay crystal is more likely to silt a stream bed, creating an environment conducive to further sedimentation. It is conceivable that such effects could extend to the creation of flat areas likely to be exposed to air, dry, and turn to wind-borne dust, which could fall randomly in other streams. Thus—by simple, inorganic, physical processes—a selection environment might exist for the reproduction of clay crystals of the &quot;stickier&quot; shape.

There follows a process of natural selection for clay crystals that trap certain forms of molecules to their surfaces that may enhance their replication potential. Complex proto-organic molecules can be catalysed by the surface properties of silicates. When complex molecules perform a &quot;genetic takeover&quot; from their clay &quot;vehicle&quot;, they become an independent locus of replication – an evolutionary moment that might be understood as the first exaptation.

<text>The Party of Free Change (, PLS) was a satirical political party in Romania, founded by and with as its first president. Its name, message and symbols were overt references and homages to Ion Luca Caragiale, the classical Romanian humorist; building on an inside joke, its agenda praised opportunism and even encouraged members to leave the party. However, the PLS was also criticized for its alleged links with the ruling National Salvation Front (FSN), and for being one of the many groups which split the vote in the general election of 1990 and local ones of 1992. It won a seat in Chamber, taken by Cazimir, and several positions on local councils; it was also considered for the government coalition built by Theodor Stolojan in late 1991.

While criticized in many contexts for allegedly serving as the FSN&#x27;s vehicle, the PLS had appeal as an elaborate joke among disgruntled intellectuals. At various times, its rank-and-file included comedian Dem Rădulescu, scholar Alexandru Călinescu, and singer-songwriter Doru Stănculescu, as well as scores of others of literary and artistic professionals. Changes in the electoral legislation signaled its decline—a rapid one, after Cazimir had endorsed Ion Iliescu and the Democratic National Salvation Front agead of general elections in 1992. Other party activists declared him a defector, and continued to organize separately, but failed to win any seats. Cazimir continued his political career with Iliescu&#x27;s Social Democratic Party. Although technically undissolvable according to its statutes, the PLS eventually disappeared before the 1996 election. Theater director Mircea Cornișteanu was its second and last president.

==History==
===Creation===
The PLS began existence shortly after the December 1989 revolution, which toppled the communist regime and restored multiparty democracy. It was founded by editorial cartoonist Octavian Andronic, with a manifesto published on February 6, 1990 in &quot;Libertatea&quot; daily; literary critic Ștefan Cazimir adhered &quot;by phone&quot; on February 7. The name was adapted from Ion Luca Caragiale&#x27;s comedy &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot; (1884), which Andronic had just watched on Romanian Television, in the Liviu Ciulei adaptation. In the original text, it already appears as a malapropism and &quot;double entendre&quot;: one of the key characters, Nae Cațavencu, declares himself &quot;liber schimbist&quot;, technically &quot;a supporter of free trade&quot;, but this can also be read as &quot;easy changer&quot;—one who changes views or convictions easily, without scruples. One of the main principles of the party was granting the status of honorary membership to anyone who changed their allegiance from one political party to another.

Cazimir, often mistaken as the party founder, had had a political involvement with the Romanian Communist Party and, earlier, the Union of Communist Youth, to which he adhered . In December, he had been caught up in the revolutionary events, first as an unwilling participant in the communist counter-manifestation, then as a supporter of the street movement in Bucharest. Overall, the new enterprise was entirely built on his deadpan humor (for which he was already famous) and his deep familiarity with Caragiale&#x27;s work—he was recognized as a Caragiale expert since the 1960s. During January, Cazimir pondered entering politics as an independent, promising his constituents to &quot;read out from Caragiale as often as possible&quot;. Another founding member, Mircea Cornișteanu, produced and directed Caragiale plays, and is described as one of Caragiale&#x27;s &quot;feverish admirers&quot;. Looking part on the first post-revolutionary years in 2010, philologist Mona Momescu argues that the abundance of references to Caragiale—present with both the PLS as a &quot;literary party&quot; and the unrelated humor magazine, &quot;Academia Cațavencu&quot;—showed that Romanians had not yet abandoned the practice of &quot;cultural resistance&quot;, which had been favored by communist-era dissidents.

Due to its literary pedigree leading back to the 1880s, the PLS called itself an &quot;historic party&quot;. A portrait of Caragiale appeared on its first-ever logo, later changed to &quot;the drawing of a child biting on a flower&quot; (also noted as a &quot;five-leaf clover&quot;). Tributes for the writer extended into other areas of party activity—including the PLS motto, &quot;Caragiale e cu noi!&quot; (&quot;Caragiale is with us!&quot;). The party hymn, called &quot;Mărire vouă, lupte seculare&quot; (&quot;Glory to Thee, Combats of Centuries&quot;), ended with another paraphrase from &quot;O scrisoare...&quot;: &quot;Trădare fie, dar s-o știm și noi!&quot; (&quot;Let&#x27;s have betrayal, but let&#x27;s be aware of it!&quot;). Its official tribune, founded by Andronic and called &quot;Răcnetul Carpaților&quot; (&quot;The Roar of the Carpathians&quot;, after Cațavencu&#x27;s fictional gazette), ran fragments from Caragiale&#x27;s political satire as genuine political news and commentary. Reviving Cațavencu&#x27;s rhetoric, perceived enemies of the party where addressed as &quot;reprobabili&quot; (&quot;detestable people&quot;), and allies as &quot;venerabili&quot; or &quot;stimabili&quot; (&quot;venerable&quot; or &quot;esteemed people&quot;).

The group&#x27;s early recruits included singer-songwriter Doru Stănculescu, though he quit politics shortly after and started a new life in France. The PLS soon had embryonic local chapters, or &quot;initiative committees&quot;—economist Eugen Bâlc presided over one such unit in Sălaj County. The national organizing conference took place on February 18 at the People&#x27;s Art College, on Cosmonauților Street, Bucharest. It was here that Cazimir was made president, with Andronic&#x27;s blessing—the latter, being chief editor of the independent &quot;Libertatea&quot;, did not wish to become politically involved. Under Cazimir, the party would not declare its ideology, but parodied serious parties for their quick adoption of &quot;centrism&quot;. In this context, it announced itself as being a party &quot;on the outer edge&quot;, because &quot;two cannot be at the center without stifling or crushing each other. Plus, one can get a better perspective from the edge&quot;. The PSL&#x27;s self-depiction as an extremist party was immediately contradicted by the statutes, which criticized other political forces for dealing in &quot;annoyance, tension, and violence&quot;, proposing that dialogue needed to be fostered between all political forces. Cazimir noted that the party platform only ever stood out from that of serious groups &quot;in being grammatically correct&quot;. While &quot;most other groups cultivate unwitting humor&quot;, PLS statutes endorsed &quot;witting humor&quot;. This also meant that the PLS &quot;is militating for a reduction of Caragiale&#x27;s applicability to the present day. This applicability is however endorsed by the other political forces.&quot;

===1990 performance and controversy===
Soon after its official registration on March 1, the PLS was invited by the governing National Salvation Front (FSN) to join Romania&#x27;s temporary legislature, or Provisional National Unity Council (CPUN). Its one seat there was taken by Cazimir. For a while, the PLS was attractive to intellectuals who had come to resent the FSN, such as the literary historian Alexandru Călinescu—who joined the party because he intended to highlight the &quot;comedy&quot; of Romanian politics. Cazimir himself was critical of the FSN and its leader Ion Iliescu, establishing contacts with the Golaniad protest movement (named after &quot;golani&quot;, &quot;hoodlums&quot;, the word used by Iliescu to describe his opponents). As he noted in an April 1990 interview with academic George Pruteanu, he considered himself a &quot;veteran hoodlum&quot; (&quot;golan veteran&quot;), and suggested that the anti-FSN movement was &quot;&quot;too&quot; numerous not to be taken into account&quot; (Cazimir&#x27;s emphasis); according to Pruteanu&#x27;s marginal comments, part of this statement may have been sarcastic. Also then, Cazimir stated that he was not opposed to the Proclamation of Timișoara, which had asked for the lustration of high-ranking communists, and which the FSN was formally opposing. As he put it, the PLS statues contained a similar provision, barring &quot;people who have held high-ranking central- or local-level positions between January 1, 1980 and December 22, 1989&quot; from applying as members; the same provisions forbade people &quot;compromised by their active support for the former regime&quot;, as well as those &quot;lacking in sense of humor&quot; from joining the PLS.

With Cazimir as president, seconded by Gheorghe Boșman, the party held its first congress at Cervantes High School, Bucharest, shortly before the May 1990 general elections. The PLS benefited from the liberal electoral law of that period, which required registrations to have only 251 signatures. Politician and scholar Cristian Preda places the PLS in a category of ephemeral groups created in that interval, alongside a Romanian Democratic Popular Realist Revolutionary Party and a Party of Heroes Killed for the Freedom of Living Heroes Maimed by the Barbarian Bullets. Unlike these highly localized projects, the PLS ran candidates in 26 precincts, and formed small but active county organizations—according to Cazimir, these were mostly run by divorcée ladies. The party claimed to have recruited a celebrated comedic actor, Dem Rădulescu, though he apparently defected to the &quot;Party of Democratic Unity&quot; just days before the election, and was registered on its Senate list at Vîlcea.

The PLS received around 0.3% of the vote in both the Senate and Chamber of Deputies elections. Although it failed to win any senatorial mandates, it took a single seat in the Chamber, which went to Cazimir. In his early speeches at Cervantes, Cazimir had joked that they only ran in elections &quot;because I was tired of things going smooth.&quot; In his Pruteanu interview, he noted being serious about capturing the vote: &quot;our main effort at the present time is not the recruitment of new members, but the earning of electoral sympathies and trust. Once we will win the votes, we will also bring in new members.&quot; Cazimir used his speaking time in Chamber mainly to popularize the sayings of Caragiale and Ion Creangă, as well as his own epigrams. At times, he also expressed mild criticism of the FSN as the party of &quot;dead roses&quot;, and commented negatively on the June 1990 Mineriad, braving threats of violence from the Front&#x27;s working-class electorate. 

Various commentators see the PLS as a tool for the FSN&#x27;s alleged plan to stifle or ridicule serious opposition. Radu Câmpeanu, chairman of the National Liberal Party–Câmpeanu, once suggested that the PSL&#x27;s very creation had served someone else&#x27;s &quot;political interests&quot;, adding that he did not known whether Cazimir had been aware of that being the case: &quot;Some serve [such interests] whether they know it or not&quot;. In November 1991, columnist Cornel Nistorescu proposed that Cazimir may have taken his seat through electoral fraud carried out by the FSN, and that his activity was meant to glamorize political apathy; this view was endorsed by the staff writers at &quot;România Literară&quot;, who called Cazimir and his followers the &quot;humorless humorists&quot;. Also at &quot;România Literară&quot;, columnist Alex. Ștefănescu, a member of the opposition National Peasants&#x27; Party (PNȚCD), saw it as a &quot;sociological oddity&quot; that &quot;a parody of a party was taken seriously by the voters&quot;. Journalist George Baltac believes that the PLS &quot;deliberately&quot; helped the FSN to fragment the PNȚCD&#x27;s voting weight with &quot;an explosion of minuscule parties.&quot; He notes that Cazimir, as a &quot;left-wing intellectual&quot;, had a personal relationship with Iliescu. In a 2006 piece, writer Cătălin Mihuleac described the PLS doctrines as an &quot;idiotic jest&quot; (&quot;hlizeala idioată&quot;), arguing that Caragiale would have never approved of it; he described Cazimir and his group as a toxic influence on Romanian politics. Likewise, commentator Andrei Manolescu argues that &quot;[Cazimir&#x27;s] humor and irony turned into actual opportunism.&quot;

===Demise===
During the early months of 1991, the FSN engaged in talks with all other parliamentary groups, in order to obtain support for a Third Roman cabinet. Speaking for the PLS, Cazimir ridiculed the move in a widely quoted, television interview: observing that the FSN had 66% of parliamentary seats, with all other 15 parties only holding the remainder, he declared that a coalition government would have resembled &quot;Gulliver and 15 dwarfs&quot;. Late that year, Theodor Stolojan, the Prime Minister-designate, held talks with all parliamentary parties, including the PLS, in an effort to secure backing for his own government team. His move reportedly angered the larger parties. Although the legislation updated in 1992 provided an election threshold, which harmed its chances, the PLS continued to be active, and staged high-profile stunts. In one such event, its delegation to Brussels made &quot;Manneken Pis&quot; an honorary party member. 

The party also contested the February 1992 elections for local councils. It fielded 75 candidates for the General Council of Bucharest (the maximum allowed by law), and was acclaimed by independent observers for the high quality of its recruitment base: 14 of the candidates were from the various liberal arts, including four journalists. The PLS also endorsed Tudor Popescu as its candidate for Bucharest Mayor. This strategy contrasted its approach to other urban centers—in Brașov, it only had one candidate for the local council. In the end, it elected several councilors throughout the country, and only one at Bucharest. At Iași, the PLS endorsed Mandache Leocov of the Romanian Democratic Convention for the mayoral office; its list for the local council was headlined by physician René Corneliu Duda, who managed to obtain a seat. Mayoral elections also took place at Tîrgu Mureș in April 1992. In preparation for these, the PLS joined an electoral pact, or &quot;Mureș Democratic Alliance&quot;, alongside the FSN (now opposing Stolojan), the PNȚCD, the National Unity Party, the Democratic Agrarianists, the Democratic Ecologists, the Union of the Roma, and other groups; this was designed to block out a perceived partnership between government and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians, at a time when the latter was dominating city politics.

In the presidential and parliamentary elections of September, Iliescu tried out for a second term as President of Romania, with backing from the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN). His ticket was also endorsed by three other groups—the Humanist Party, the Socialist Democratic Party, and the PLS. On August 26, three of four members of the PLS permanent bureau (Boșman, Cornișteanu, and Vasile Groza) went public with their opposition to this move, attributing it to Cazimir as the fourth man. They voted to expel Cazimir from the bureau permanently, and also to strip him of his party membership for a nine-months &quot;gestation period&quot;. This resulted in the PSL losing its only parliamentary seat; it fielded candidates in 24 counties, but acknowledged that it had no hope of passing the threshold. While Iliescu managed to be reconfirmed during the election, the PLS vote share fell to 0.1%. 

Cazimir appeared on the FDSN list of candidates for a Bucharest precinct, and later joined the consolidated pro-Iliescu group, eventually called Social Democratic Party (PSD). Writing in 1999, Ștefănescu suggested that Cazimir had never properly explained his own defection: &quot;at some point he dropped his joking with the PLS and transferred toward [the PSD], a party that has led Romania into a position which is not at all joyful.&quot; Interviewed in 2010, Cazimir explained that his entry into the PSD was a continuation of PLS goals. Many other members of the PLS were similarly recruited by the PSD. They included councilor Duda, whose son, Radu Duda, married Margareta of Romania and became titular royal consort of Romania; this paradox was highlighted in the press, which commented on the PSD&#x27;s staunch republicanism. In a 2003 article, Lucian Gheorghiu suggested that the PSD had &quot;gobbled up&quot; the PSL as a whole in 1996.

The PLS–PSD continuity was highlighted by journalist Dumitru Tinu, who attended the PSD conference of January 1997, where he reported hearing Cazimir &quot;free-changing clowning&quot; (&quot;clovnerii liber-schimbiste&quot;), played out in front of a new public. Both Pruteanu and Cazimir were elected as PSD parliamentarians in November 2000, but found themselves taking opposite sides on issues such as linguistic protectionism. In discussing the issue, Pruteanu noted that Cazimir was still flippant, a man of &quot;derizoriu liber-schimbist&quot; (&quot;paltry free-change&quot;). A rump PLS had continued to exist for part of that interval. Cornișteanu, who succeeded Cazimir as ad-interim president, argues that he had &quot;betrayed&quot; the party statues, and notes that he was consequently listed as an &quot;abandoned member&quot;. The group was ultimately disbanded in 1996 when new rules required that any party should have at least 10,000 members, or, according to Cornișteanu, when it could no longer support itself financially. Despite publishing a history of the party in 1998, when he was referred to as its &quot;ex-president&quot;, Cazimir viewed the PLS as undissolvable. According to him, it still technically existed by 2010, because its own statutory clauses encouraged all members to join other parties.

<doc id="1269028" wikidata="Q7244687" url="?curid=1269028" title="Princess Maker 2">
<text>is a 1993 Japanese video game developed by the company Gainax. It is the second installment in the &quot;Princess Maker&quot; series of social simulation games where the player must act as a parental figure and raise a young girl. The player takes the role of a war hero who raises a girl to the age of 18. At the end of the game, the daughter goes into a line of work; what this work is, how much talent she has for it, her marital life, and her overall happiness all depend on the player&#x27;s actions throughout the game.

After the initial release for the Japanese PC-9801 personal computer, it has been subsequently released for many other personal computers and Video game consoles. The game has been translated into English, Korean, and Chinese.

==Story==
The game takes place in a fantasy world roughly modeled after medieval Europe with the starting year is given as 1210 K.D. The player&#x27;s character is a famous warrior who defended the kingdom from an invasion by Lucifon, the Prince of Darkness (a corruption of Lucifer); consequently, he is known throughout the land as a military hero and receives an annual salary from the palace. One night, he receives a communication from a god whose identity is determined by the birth-date the player selects at the beginning of the game. This god bestows upon the mentioned player a child of the heavens, and it is their duty to raise her from the age of 10 to the age of 18, at which point she will enter a line of work; the most desirable outcome is that of a royal princess.

== Gameplay ==
The daughter has a set of statistics that fluctuate depending on the activities the player assigns to her schedule, including various part-time jobs, schooling, adventure, and free time. It is these statistics that ultimately determine her final occupation, her skill level in her line of work, and her overall happiness in life; her marital fate is also decided, in part, by these statistics. The game also makes use of some invisible statistics to determine the occurrence of certain special events. The player can converse with the girl and she will refer to the player as &quot;father&quot;.

The god who visits the father is the daughter&#x27;s patron god. That patron determines her starting statistics in a way that is loosely related to the god&#x27;s role in the Roman pantheon; for example, a girl born under Mars begins the game with an advantage in fighting reputation. The player can purchase a pill from a merchant that increases the bust size of the girl.

The game ends after five and a half hours of gameplay when the girl reaches 18 and chooses a future career. High score are given to jobs such as Queen or general, whereas low scores are given to jobs such as barmaid. The game features 74 possible endings.

== Development ==

The game was developed by Gainax, who are also known for the anime series &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; and &quot;FLCL&quot;. The game is part of a trend of idealized real world simulation games in Japan, such as &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot;. In Japan at this time, most child rearing was done by females in the household since the males tended to be more career focused. Designer Takami Akai explained that &quot;To play this game means to do something you want to but can&#x27;t&quot;, adding that a father would not be allowed to manage his daughter&#x27;s life because they would complain too much. Akai had thought about giving the player an infant to start the game but decided against it.

== Release ==

The game was first released for the PC-9801 personal computer. By September 1993, the game had sold 30,000 copies and the company had received 10,000 letters from fans. An English language version of the game for DOS was completed but was cancelled in 1996. The version was completed and review copies had been sent out to magazines, however the company producing the English port, IntraCorp, went bankrupt. That version was then subsequently leaked onto the internet, and was sometimes referred to as abandonware. It had later been released for multiple personal computers including the FM Towns, Macintosh, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows Me, as well as many home consoles like the 3DO, PC Engine, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation 2.

In 2001, the second and third games in the &quot;Princess Maker&quot; series were released for the Sega Dreamcast on a compilation titled &quot;Princess Maker Collection&quot;. It was ported to Japanese mobile phones in 2005. Along with the original &quot;Princess Maker 1&quot;, &quot;Princess Maker 2&quot; has received a newer &quot;refined&quot; remake for Windows. The graphics are redrawn sound quality of the game have been changed, along with various other elements. &quot;Princess Maker 2 Refine&quot; was released via Steam in Fall 2016, published by Korean publisher CFK. This version has the option for English, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean language options.

===Remaster===

 is a remaster of &quot;Refine&quot; released for the Nintendo Switch and Steam on July 11, 2024, and later the PS4 and PS5 on August 8, 2024 with physical copies for the Switch and PS5 released on December 21, 2024 to celebrate the franchise&#x27;s 30th year anniversary. This remaster features most of the same content as the above since one in game item and two endings were taken out of the PS4 and PS5 while the Switch and Steam versions remain untouched. An opening movie produced by Yonago GAINAX has been added. The animation, which was made by a team led by Takami, allows new players to get a sense of what a future raising their “daughter” is going to be like. Graphics have been redrawn by Takami also in a style that closely resembles the original PC-9801 version. Additionally, the game is upscaled to high resolution for modern games consoles and PCs.

==Reception==

The game was released to largely critical praise. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that &quot;This is the strangest game to hit the U.S. PC market in years, and on a certain level, Ignite should be commended for taking the chance to release it. Whether it can, or maybe even should, find an audience is another matter.&quot;

Several reviewers commented on the gender issues of the game. Francesca Reyes writing in &quot;Ultra Gameplayers&quot; said that while the game does include &quot;thinly veiled sexist allusions&quot;, and that it might not be for everyone, she said the game was highly entertaining and praised the game. In contrast, Etsuko Yamashita, a Women&#x27;s studies professor at Japan Women&#x27;s University was critical of the game and likening the content of the game to incest. In regards to the game being popular among college and high school males, she remarked &quot;You might think that the younger generation has a better sense of gender equality, but this game proves it&#x27;s not necessarily true.&quot;

Many reviewers praised the game for its originality. Guillermo Vacas of &quot;Minami 2000&quot; praised it for being a &quot;manga&quot; style gamed, but was non-violent and educational. Chris Hudak writing in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, praised the game for breaking the mold of violent video games on PC at the time. Saying that he had grown attached to his virtual daughter, and that the unique gameplay rewards sensitive paternal players. Both &quot;Next Generation&quot; and Reyes praised the publisher for publishing such a unique game. Reviewers also praised the visuals. &quot;PC Zone&quot; magazine called the anime styled art as &quot;eye-catching&quot;.

Reviewers also praised the number of endings in the game, saying that it encouraged playing through the game multiple times.

Although most critics praised the game, some were more critical. While Vacas praised the game as addictive and enjoyable, one downside they noted was its sheer complexity, something that could be daunting for first time players. Three reviewers from &quot;Famitsu DC&quot; were more critical of the &quot;Princess Maker Collection&quot;, giving it a low score. They said that the games were simply ports, and that while they were new and innovative at the time, they have since become dated. They said that perhaps &quot;Princess Maker: Faery Tales Come True&quot; might be an easier to game to play instead. Janine Hawkins, writing in &quot;Vice&quot; was critical of the look of the &quot;Refine&quot; version of the game, including the lack of dithering in artwork.

Retrospective reviews of the game were also positive. Reviewing the 2016 English &quot;Refine&quot; release, &quot;Hardcore Gamer&quot; gave the game a score of 4 out of 5 and called it &quot;absolutely a blast all these years later&quot;, although criticizing the translation, which at times said the opposite of what actually happened or left the endings voiced in Japanese without subtitles.

<doc id="1269032" wikidata="Q4783241" url="?curid=1269032" title="Arab Singaporeans">
<text>The majority of the Arabs in Singapore are Hadharem and traced their ancestry to the southern Arabian Peninsula in Hadramaut, Yemen. The valley region was part of a confederacy once ruled by the Queen of Sheba. Hadramaut was mentioned in The Old Testament (Hazra Mavet). Its fertile areas, suitable for cultivation, had beguiled ancient Romans to call it, and all South Arabia in general, Arabia Felix (Happy Arabia). 

The history of migration from Hadramaut, following the monsoons of the Indian Ocean, forced the Hadhramis to resettle in various parts of the world: Hyderabad, India (before 1947), Dar-es-Salaam and East Africa as well as Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies.

The Hadhrami population is made up of three distinct social strata: The Gabails, a confederation of clans forming the Al Kathiri tribe, descent from blue blood, including the Bin Talibs, Bin Abdats, Bajrais, and Harharahs. The honorific &quot;Sheikh&quot; (also spelled “Shaikh”) and &quot;Sheikhah&quot; (also spelled &quot;Shaykhah&quot; and &quot;Shaikha&quot;) (for men and women respectively) often precede their names. 

The Al Kathiri Sultanate had dominion over the southern region of the Arabian Peninsula. The tribes traced their roots to the ancient Banu Hamdan tribes, which reside in the Gulf Arab regions, East African countries, and in the Arab-speaking provinces of Iran such as Khuzestan. 

The Confederal Harharah Sultanate reigned over the State of Upper Yafa. The Sultanate had formed a military alliance with the British Aden Protectorate and the Protectorate of South Arabia. Its capital, Mahjaba, was located about 50 km northeast of Habilayn. 

The Ba&#x27;Alawi sada, who claimed to be the descendants of Muhammad, are known by their singular honorific &quot;Syed&quot; for men and “Sharifah” for women. 

The Mashaikhs are commoners whose family names (surnames) often begin with &quot;Ba-&quot; (for example Bafana, Bamadhaj, Bagharib, Bahashwan). However, a &#x27;Ba&#x27; at the beginning of a surname may not necessarily denote a commoner as some Gabail tribes have Ba in their surnames. 

==History==
===Hadhrami migration===
The early Arab settlers came to Singapore with wealth made in Indonesia. Being already familiar with Malay customs, they were accepted by the Malays living there. In 1824, the population of Singapore was 10,683. Out of this total, there were only 15 Arabs. In 1829, there were 34 Arabs with only 3 Arab women among them. Their population increased as follows:

&quot;(Source: Lim Lu Sia, 1987:32)&quot;

The census for 1970s and 1980s is not believed to reflect the actual number of Arabs in Singapore. This is because a number of Arabs have been officially registered as “Malay”. After Singapore became an independent country in 1965, the ethnic Malays enjoyed educational benefits granted by the state. Some Arab families then listed the ethnicity of their children to &quot;Malay&quot; to receive these benefits. Because of intermarriage between Malay or Indian Muslim men and Arab women, some Malays and Indians have Arab ancestry. People of Arab descent matrilineally are not officially listed as Arabs as a person&#x27;s race in Singapore, until 2010, was determined by his father&#x27;s race.

===Contribution to Singapore===
The position and contribution of the Arabs to Singapore can be seen when a member of the Aljuneid clan was appointed as a member of the mostly European-dominated Chamber of Commerce in 1837. Two members of the Alsagoff clan, Syed Mohamed bin Ahmed Alsagoff and Syed Mohammed bin Syed Omar Alsagoff, served as Municipal Commissioners in 1872–1898 and 1928–1933 respectively.

The Arabs formed their own association in 1946 which still exists today. The objectives then were to promote and enhance Islam as well as the use of Arabic language. By the time the Arab Association Singapore was founded, the Arab traders were the wealthiest community in Singapore. Syed Ali Mohammed Al-Juneid, for instance, donated a large plot of land near Victoria and Arab Streets to Tan Tock Seng’s hospital. He also built public wells across town to provide free water, at a time when none was being supplied by the municipality. The Al-Juneid family – after whom Aljunied Road is named – made large donations to the construction of the Town Hall (now the Victoria Memorial and Concert Hall), while paying for the building of public bridges. The Al-Kaff footbridge on the Singapore River takes its name from another prominent Arab family, which built the first Japanese Gardens opened to the public before World War II (where the Sennett private housing estate is today).

The Arabs were also well known for their contribution to lands (Arab&#x27;s land holdings charitable trust). The land of Syed Mohamed Alsagoff was formed in 1904 to help support efforts for orphanages, mosques and Islamic schools. Today, the Madrasah Aljunied Al-Islamiah and Madrasah Alsagoff Al-Arabiah stand as a legacy of the contribution of the Arab community towards Islamic education in Singapore. Currently, almost the entire area Singapore central business district were once the lands which the government acquired in the 1970s with only the minimal compensation paid to the owners.

===Arab role in trade===
The Arabs had played a dominant role in trade in South East Asia since the fifteenth century. When Sir Stamford Raffles founded Singapore in 1819, he attracted the Arab traders to his new city. By 1824, there were 15 Arabs out of a population of 10,683 and Raffles anticipated a rapid growth in Arab immigration. His blueprint for Singapore included plans for an Arab district. In his instructions to a Singapore housing committee in 1822, he stated:

&quot;The Arab population would require every consideration. No situation will be more appropriate for them than the vicinity of the Sultan’s residence...&quot; (Buckley 1902:85)

The first Arabs to arrive in Singapore in 1819 were two wealthy merchants from Palembang, Sumatra. Their numbers gradually increased and by 1846, there were five important Arab merchant houses. The al-Junied [al-junaid] الجنيد family in Singapore grew to be a rich and influential as did the al-Kaffs [al-kāf] الكاف and the al-Saggoffs [al-saqqāf] السقاف. There are streets and even a town council named after them.

The al-Saggoffs were spice traders and became influential by marrying into a royal family from the Celebes. They acquired many properties, like the other Arab families, including the &quot;Perseverance Estate&quot; where they grew lemon grass. The estate is now considered to be the heart of the Muslim community in Singapore. As well as being successful merchants and land owners, the family became involved in civic affairs. The family members, at times, held civic office from the 1870s until 1965. The al-Kaff family arrived here in 1852. All these families lived in mansions of considerable opulence like the al-Kaff house. Today, the building is a restaurant called Alkaff Mansion as a gesture to preserve the name. Other than that, it has no other Hadhrami connection, either in architectural style or ownership.

===Arab business domination===
The Arabs dominated the businesses in Singapore, principally in oil and trade, during the British colonial period. Arabic culture had a strong influence on the local Malay culture through its religion. This is seen in the Middle Eastern-style architecture of the mosques in Kampong Glam.

In the heyday of Arab prosperity, the Arabs in Singapore maintained close links with Hadhramaut and large amounts of money were sent back to the homeland. The rich built themselves splendid houses, like the Alkaff house. They also sent their sons back to Hadhramaut for periods of time to enhance their identity as Hadhramis. This custom maintained their language and Hadhrami culture. It even resulted in some Malay being incorporated in the spoken Arabic of Hadhramaut (see Hadhrami Arabic). Hadhramaut was regarded as a cultural training ground of the young Arab men and the time spent there was the final preparation for manhood. Upon their return to Singapore, these young men would take their place in the family businesses.

===After World War II===
During World War II it became impossible for the Hadhramis in Singapore to travel abroad but they continued to do so thereafter. However, after the Rent Control Act came into effect, Hadrami incomes were frozen and it became clear that the (trust) incomes would not be sufficient for the next generation. It was then that the Arab families took a keener interest in the education of their children. The richer families sent their children to London to study and the children of others spent time working in Aden rather than just going to Hadhramaut. The cultural and linguistic links were still maintained. However, the family incomes continued to decline.

===The 1960s===
In the 1960s, there came a major change. The independence of South Yemen with a communist government in power put an end to the Singapore Hadramis returning home. At the same time, the economic developments in Singapore made the importance of the English language and of obtaining an education even more essential. The new Arab generation had grown up without speaking Arabic and had lost both its identity and its affiliation with Hadhramaut. Some families, in the oil boom of the 1970s, tried sending their sons to Saudi Arabia or Arab States of the Persian Gulf, but it was not a success. The young men did not like living in Saudi Arabia as their prospects in Singapore were better than on the Arabian Peninsula.

==Present day==

===Singaporean Arabs census today===
Singapore is a cosmopolitan city state made up of various races. The 1990 census shows the Chinese as the majority with around 74% of the population, the indigenous Malays with 14%, the Indians at less than 10% and the balance placed in the category of &quot;others&quot;. This &quot;others&quot; category includes, but is not limited to, Filipinos, Eurasians, Vietnamese and Arabs. The census shows Arabs to be around 7,000, but unofficial estimates place the actual number of Arabs at around 10,000.

===Arabs and (waqf وقف ) properties today===
The Singapore Hadramis were major landlords, the large families having substantial properties held in trust, which ranged from private family trusts to public charitable trusts. Most of the land in today’s central business district of Singapore was once owned by Hadrami . These , bearing the family names, whether private or charitable, gave considerable prestige to the Arab community among the Muslims in Singapore.
In recent years, four factors have affected the and undermined the status of the community. The first three factors have been a direct result of government policies.

<text>The Tonnele Circle is an intersection in Jersey City, New Jersey, United States. It is named after Tonnele [&quot;TUN-uh-lee&quot;] Avenue, the north–south road that runs through it.

==Entrances and exits==
Entrances to and exits from Tonnele Circle are listed clockwise from north:
*Tonnele Avenue north (U.S. Route 1/9)
*entrance from Route 139 and Kennedy Boulevard
*exit to Route 139
*Tonnele Avenue south
*entrance from Pulaski Skyway (U.S. Route 1/9)
*Truck US 1/9
*exit to Pulaski Skyway (U.S. Route 1/9)

==History==

Before the Pulaski Skyway was built, the cut through the New Jersey Palisades (now Route 139) ended at Tonnele Circle, where Tonnele Avenue went north and south, and the main road to Newark went west. To the east, just north of the road through the cut, was a connector road to Hudson County Boulevard (now renamed Kennedy Boulevard). When the Skyway was built, the old connection to Tonnele Circle became a left-side exit and entrance ramp to the Circle, with the Skyway passing over the Circle. Right-side exit and entrance ramps were provided between the Skyway and the Circle, with the southbound onramp exiting the circle north of the old road (now TRUCK US 1/9).

On September 14, 1938, a direct ramp, known as the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, opened from the cut, passing over Tonnele Circle, to TRUCK US 1/9. This greatly improved traffic, since southbound (westbound) trucks no longer had to pass through the circle. Northbound (eastbound) trucks still do, but they only cross the Tonnele Avenue south approach, which is relatively minor.


In mid-1952, the circle was rebuilt. Northbound traffic from TRUCK US 1/9 could now go straight through the circle. Also at that time, or possibly earlier, the offramp from Route 139 was moved to the right side, and entered the Circle where the connector to Hudson County Boulevard had. The connector was modified to only go towards the Circle.

The circle was altered in 2005. A ramp was built to permit vehicles heading southbound on Tonnele Avenue to access the Pulaski Skyway without entering the circle. Additionally, ramps around and through the circle were modified to improve traffic flow, and traffic lights were added and recalibrated to reduce the chances of cross traffic being in an intersection simultaneously.

Throughout the early 2010s, the circle was rebuilt. Changes included traffic rebuilding the overpass that carried southbound US 1-9 Truck, relocating the left turn ramp that let US 1-9 traffic to turn onto NJ 139 or U-turn, removing the 1950s era ramp that let Wittepen bridge traffic onto US 1-9 north, narrowing the circle to one lane in most areas, updating signage, lighting, and traffic lights, constructing a new exit to let southbound Us 1-9 traffic onto US 1-9 Truck to the Witpenn bridge, relocating the tonnelle avenue exit on US 1-9 south, and building a new St. Paul&#x27;s Viaduct and relocateing the overpass entrances to allow NJ 7 traffic to bypass the circle and get on to US 1-9 north from the Wittpenn Bridge.

In 2021, the Tonnele Circle Viaduct was connected to the newly created Wittpenn bridge.

==Naming==
It is sometimes believed that the circle (and street) gets its name from the Holland Tunnel, since the circle was built for the tunnel. Hagstrom maps even label the circle as &quot;Tunnel&#x27;s Traffic Circle&quot;. However, the circle was named after the street, and the street was probably named after a John Tonnele, who died in 1852, or one of his descendants. Information on the Tonnele family is sparse, but at least some of them lived in Jersey City, where the street now runs. The street was named by 1883. There is some confusion about the spelling - whether the name has one &#x27;L&#x27; or two - even within Jersey City, and street signs reflect both options. However, the U.S. Postal Service favors &quot;Tonnele,&quot; which reflects the spelling of the man after whom the street is named.

<doc id="1269039" wikidata="Q864204" url="?curid=1269039" title="Bioaugmentation">
<text>Biological augmentation is the addition of archaea or bacterial cultures required to speed up the rate of degradation of a contaminant. Organisms that originate from contaminated areas may already be able to break down waste, but perhaps inefficiently and slowly.

Bioaugmentation is a type of bioremediation in which it requires studying the indigenous varieties present in the location to determine if biostimulation is possible. After discovering the indigenous bacteria found in the location, if the indigenous bacteria can metabolize the contaminants, more of the indigenous bacterial cultures will be implemented into the location to boost the degradation of the contaminants. Bioaugmentation is the introduction of more archaea or bacterial cultures to enhance the contaminant degradation whereas biostimulation is the addition of nutritional supplements for the indigenous bacteria to promote the bacterial metabolism. If the indigenous variety do not have the metabolic capability to perform the remediation process, exogenous varieties with such sophisticated pathways are introduced. The utilization of bioaugmentation provides advancement in the fields of microbial ecology and biology, immobilization, and bioreactor design.

Bioaugmentation is commonly used in municipal wastewater treatment to restart activated sludge bioreactors. Most cultures available contain microbial cultures, already containing all necessary microorganisms (&quot;B. licheniformis&quot;, &quot;B. thuringiensis&quot;, &quot;P. polymyxa&quot;, &quot;B. stearothermophilus&quot;, &quot;Penicillium&quot; sp., &quot;Aspergillus&quot; sp., &quot;Flavobacterium&quot;, &quot;Arthrobacter&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Streptomyces&quot;, &quot;Saccharomyces&quot;, etc.). Activated sludge systems are generally based on microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, nematodes, rotifers, and fungi, which are capable of degrading biodegradable organic matter. There are many positive outcomes from the use of bioaugmentation, such as the improvement in efficiency and speed of the process of breaking down substances and the reduction of toxic particles in an area.

== Applications ==

===Soil remediation===

Bioaugmentation is favorable in contaminated soils that have undergone bioremediation, but still pose an environmental risk. This is because microorganisms that were originally in the environment did not accomplish their task during bioremediation when it came to breaking down chemicals in the contaminated soil. The failure of original bacteria can be caused by environmental stresses, as well as changes in the microbial population due to mutation rates. When microorganisms are added, they are potentially more suited to the nature of the new contaminant, meanwhile the older microorganisms are similar to the older pollution and contamination. However, this is merely one of many factors; site size is also a very important determinant. In order to see whether bioaugmentation should be implemented, the overall setting must be considered. Also, some highly specialized microorganisms are not capable of adapting to certain site settings. Availability of certain microorganism types (as used for bioremediation) may also be a problem. Although bioaugmentation may appear to be a perfect solution for contaminated soil, it can have drawbacks. For example, the wrong type of bacteria can result in potentially clogged aquifers, or the remediation result may be incomplete or unsatisfactory.

===Bioaugmentation of chlorinated solvents===
At sites where soil and groundwater are contaminated with chlorinated ethenes, such as tetrachloroethylene and trichloroethylene, bioaugmentation can be used to ensure that the &quot;in situ&quot; microorganisms can completely degrade these contaminants to ethylene and chloride, which are non-toxic. Bioaugmentation is typically only applicable to bioremediation of chlorinated ethenes, although there are emerging cultures with the potential to biodegrade other compounds including BTEX, chloroethanes, chloromethanes, and MTBE. The first reported application of bioaugmentation for chlorinated ethenes was at Kelly Air Force Base, TX. Bioaugmentation is typically performed in conjunction with the addition of electron donor (biostimulation) to achieve geochemical conditions in groundwater that favor the growth of the dechlorinating microorganisms in the bioaugmentation culture.

===Niche fitness===
Including more microbes into an environment is beneficial to the speed of the cleanup duration. The interaction and competitions of two compounds influence the performance that a microorganism, original or new, could have. This can be tested by placing a soil that favors the new microbes into the area and then looking at the performance. The results will show if the new microorganism can perform well enough in that soil with other microorganisms. This helps to determine the correct amount of microbes and indigenous substances that are needed in order to optimize performance and create a co-metabolism.

===Coke plant wastewater in China===
An example of how bioaugmentation has improved an environment, is in the coke plant wastewater in China. Coal in China is used as a main energy source and the contaminated water contains harmful toxic contaminants like ammonia, thiocyanate, phenols and other organic compounds, such as mono- and polycyclic nitrogen-containing aromatics, oxygen and sulfur-containing heterocyclics and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Previous measures to treat this problem was an aerobic-anoxic-oxic system, solvent extractions, stream stripping, and biological treatment. Bioaugmentation has been reported to remove 3-chlorobenzoate, 4-methyl benzoate, toluene, phenol, and chlorinated solvents.

The anaerobic reactor was packed with semi-soft media, which were constructed by plastic ring and synthetic fiber string. The anoxic reactor is a completely mixed reactor while the oxic reactor is a hybrid bioreactor in which polyurethane foam carriers were added. Water from anoxic reactor, odic reactor and sedimentation tank were used and had mix-ins of different amount of old and developed microbes with .75 concentration and 28 degree Celsius. The rate of contaminant degradation depended on the amount of microbe concentration. In the enhanced microbial community indigenous microorganisms broke down the contaminants in the coke plant wastewater, such as pyridines, and phenolic compounds. When indigenous heterotrophic microorganisms were added, they converted many large molecular compounds into smaller and simpler compounds, which could be taken from more biodegradable organic compounds. This proves that bioaugmentation could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted compounds that are not properly removed by conventional biological treatment system. When bioaugmentation is combined with A1–A2–O system for the treatment of coke plant wastewater it is very powerful.

===Petroleum cleanup===
In the petroleum industry, there is a large problem with how oilfield drilling pit is disposed of. Many used to simply place dirt over the pit, but it is far more productive and economically beneficial to use bioaugmentation. With the use of advanced microbes, drilling companies can actually treat the problem in the oilfield pit instead of transferring the waste around. Specifically, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be metabolized by some bacteria, which significantly reduces environmental damage from drilling activities. Given suitable environmental conditions, microbes are placed in the oilpit to break down hydrocarbons and alongside are other nutrients. Before treatment there was a total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) level of 44,880 ppm, which within just 47 days the TPH was lowered to a level of 10,000 ppm to 6,486 ppm.

==Failures and potential solutions==
There have been many instances where bioaugmentation had deficiencies in its process, including the use of the wrong organism. The implementation of bioaugmentation on the environment can pose problems of predation, nutritional competition between indigenous and inoculated bacteria, insufficient inoculations, and disturbing the ecological balance due to large inoculations. Each problem can be solved using different techniques to limit the possibilities of these problems occurring. Predation can be prevented by high initial doses of the inoculated bacteria or heat treatment prior to inoculation whereas nutritional competition can be settled with biostimulation. Insufficient inoculations can be treated by repeated or continual inoculations and large inoculations are resolved with highly monitored dosages of the bacteria.

Examples include the introduced bacteria fail to enhance the degradation within the soil, and the bioaugmentation trials fail on the laboratory scale, but succeed on the large scale. Many of these problems occurred because the microbial ecology issues were not taken into consideration in order to map the performance of the bioaugmentation. It is crucial to consider the microbes&#x27; ability to withstand the conditions in the microbial community to be placed in. In many of the cases that have failed, only the microbes&#x27; ability to break down compounds was considered and less their fitness in existing communities and the resulting competitive stress. It is better to identify the existing communities before looking at the strains needed to break down pollutants.

<doc id="1269042" wikidata="Q867298" url="?curid=1269042" title="Traffic circles in New Jersey">
<text>The U.S. state of New Jersey at one point had a total of 101 traffic circles, 44 of which were part of state roads. However, the number has shrunk as traffic circles have been phased out by the New Jersey Department of Transportation. In the 1920s and 1930s, New Jersey felt that traffic circles were an efficient way for moving traffic through three or more intersecting roads. Built in 1925, the first traffic circle in New Jersey was the Airport Circle in Pennsauken. Many of these interchanges are rotaries in design, as opposed to the more successful modern roundabout.
As suburban and rural populations grew New Jersey&#x27;s traffic circles became outdated. The increased number of drivers on the roads resulted in traffic circles being more likely to hinder traffic than help it. Increased number of vehicles and faster traffic speeds made traffic circles more dangerous and accidents common. Many traffic circles became notorious for having frequent accidents and being confusing, especially for non-locals. Starting around the 1970s, the New Jersey Department of Transportation began phasing out traffic circles. Common methods of eliminating traffic circles are building a road through the circle, adding traffic lights, and the use of grade separation.

Modified traffic circles are intersections where parts or all of the original circle still exist as a major part of the intersection.

<doc id="1269044" wikidata="Q6741676" url="?curid=1269044" title="Malay Singaporeans">
<text>Malay Singaporeans () are Singaporeans of Malay ancestry, including those from the Malay Archipelago. They constitute approximately 13.5% of the country&#x27;s residents, making them the second largest ethnic group in Singapore. Under the Constitution of Singapore, they are recognised by the government as the indigenous people of the country, with Malay as the national language of Singapore.

At the time of the arrival of British colonial official Stamford Raffles in 1819, the native Malays were the majority living on the island, which at the time had a total estimated population of approximately 1,000. Another estimate placed that at the time of his arrival, the population was 120 Malays, 30 Chinese and some local tribes such as the Orang Laut. From the 19th century until World War II, the Malays enjoyed favourable treatment whereby they were not resettled for labour and their traditional lifestyles were generally left undisturbed. However, as the British needed &quot;coolies&quot;, this resulted in particularly lower rates of immigration as compared to the Indians and Chinese, with the latter notably becoming the majority ethnic group by the mid-19th century.

Today, as Singapore is an island within the Malay Archipelago, a significant portion of Malay Singaporeans have their roots from nearby regions such as the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Riau Islands. This migration has enriched the cultural heritage of the Malay community in Singapore. These groups share the same culture, customs, language, and religion with the broader Singaporean society. They are active in all areas of Singaporean culture and society, with independent representation in fields such as media, politics, and sports.

==History of the Malay kings of Singapore==

The seventeenth-century Malay chronicle, the Sejarah Melayu or Malay Annals, tells of the founding of a great trading city on the island of Temasek in 1299 AD by a prince from Palembang. Palembang was then the capital of the diminishing Srivijaya Empire. The prince, Sri Tri Buana, (also known as Sang Nila Utama) was said to be a descendant of Alexander the Great and an Indian princess called Shahru Al-Bariyah. Legend states that he renamed the city Singapura (&quot;lion city&quot;) after sighting a strange beast that he took to be a lion, although there is no real historical evidence of this.

In the mid-14th century, Singapura suffered raids by the expanding Javanese Majapahit Empire to the south and the emerging Thai kingdom of Ayutthaya to the north, both claiming the island as a vassal state at several points in time. Around 1388, the ruler of Palembang, Parameswara, came to Singapore to flee from Majapahit control. He murdered the king and seized power, but it was a futile act. The Srivijaya Empire, already in decline, finally met its end when Majapahit attacked its capital Palembang in 1391. In 1396, Majapahit or Ayutthaya forces drove out Parameswara, who fled northward and founded kingdom of Malacca in 1400.

When the Portuguese captured Malacca in 1511, the last Malaccan sultan, Mahmud Shah, fled to Johor, where he established the new Johor Sultanate. Singapura became part of this sultanate. In 1613, however, the Portuguese reportedly burning down a trading outpost at the mouth of the river and Singapura passed into history. 

In 1718, Raja Kecil of Minangkabau-Siak who claimed he was the posthumous son of Sultan Mahmud II, took control of the Johor Sultanate. Four years later, Raja Kecil was dethroned by Raja Sulaiman&#x27;s supporters with the assistance of the Bugis. The territory controlled by the Johor-Riau Sultanate in the late eighteenth century still included Singapore as part of its territory. The sultanate had become increasingly weakened by a division into a Malay faction, which controlled the Malay peninsula and Singapore vis a vis a Bugis faction which controlled the Riau Archipelago. When Sultan Mahmud Riayat Shah III died in 1811, the Bugis had proclaimed the younger of his two sons, Abdul Rahman, as sultan instead of the elder son, Tengku Long. While the sultan was the nominal ruler of his domain, senior officials actually governed the sultanate. In control of Singapore and the neighbouring islands was Temenggong Abdul Rahman, Tengku Long&#x27;s father-in-law. In 1818, he and some of his followers left Riau for Singapore shortly after the Dutch signed a treaty with the Sultan Abdul Rahman, allowing the Dutch to station a garrison at Riau.

In 1819, Tengku Long signed a treaty with the British led by Sir Stamford Raffles. In exchange for British protection and recognising him as Sultan of Johor, Tengku Long agreed to allow the British to establish a trading post in Singapore. Proclaimed as Sultan Hussein Shah, he became the Sultan of Johor. Hussein Shah&#x27;s claim to be Sultan of Johor and Singapore was by all accounts not recognised by the Malay rulers and was only a nominal title. Sultan Hussein on his part, did not pursue any active claim to his sovereignty rights over Johor, spent much of his time at his residence in Istana Kampong Glam until he moved to Malacca in 1834.

In 1835, Sultan Hussein Shah died and was succeeded by his eldest son, Tengku Ali. In 1855, due to his debts caused by his extravagant lifestyle, Sultan Ali formally ceded his sovereignty rights of Johor to Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim with the exception of the Kesang territory in Muar, plus an annual stipend for his family. Thus, Temenggong Daeng Ibrahim was made the de facto Maharajah of Johor until his death in 1862. He was succeeded by his son Abu Bakar, who eventually went on to become the Sultan of modern Johor in 1886.

After Sultan Ali&#x27;s death in 1877, disputes broke out among his descendants. In the late 1890s, they went to court, where it was decided that no one in the family had the rights as the successor to the sultanate and the land at Kampong Glam should revert to the state [Tengku Mahmud vs. Tengku Ali, Straits Settlements Laws Report 1897 (Vol. 5)].

==Migration of Malays to Singapore after 1819==
When Raffles arrived in Singapore, there were already thousands of indigenous Malays living there. The waters of Telok Blangah, the Kallang River and other rivers had been home to the Orang Laut or &quot;Sea Nomads&quot; for a very long time. There were also Malay settlements along the Kallang River Basin and the Singapore River. Turnbull reported that there was an estimated 1,000 people living in Singapore. There were about 500 Orang Kallang, 200 Orang Seletar, 150 Orang Gelam, 100 Orang Lauts, 20–30 Malays who were the followers of Temenggong Abdul Rahman.

In the first census taken in 1824, it was revealed that the Malays (including the Bugis) then made up 60.9 per cent of the total population of 10,683. The 1826 census shows 4,790 Malays, 1,242 Bugis, and 267 Javanese out of a total population 13,750.

==Malay subgroups==

Most Singaporean Malays are descended from different ethnic groups that are found throughout the Malay Archipelago. Most notable are the indigenous tribes of the Orang Laut ethnic group, Local Malays, Javanese, Boyanese, Bugis, Minangkabaus, Banjarese and the Bataks.

===The Orang Laut (Sea Nomads)===
Also known as Orang Pulau/Orang Singapura

According to Sopher (1977), the Orang Kallang, Orang Seletar, Orang Selat and Orang Gelam were the Orang Laut that lived in Singapore. The Orang Kallang (also called the Orang Biduanda Kallang) lived in the swampy areas in the Kallang River. They lived on boats and sustained their lives by fishing and collecting other materials from the forests. After 1819, they were relocated by Temenggong Abdul Rahman to the northern Singapore Straits at Sungai Pulau. In 1847 most of the Orang Kallang were wiped out by a smallpox epidemic.

The Orang Seletar lived in the river swamps and the small islands surrounding mainland Singapore. They would often gather in the coastal areas, especially on the estuary of the Seletar River. They lived a nomadic lifestyle until the 1850s when they started living on land and followed the lifestyles of others living in Singapore.

The Orang Selat lived in the harbour waters of Keppel Singapore. They were believed to have traversed the waters of Keppel Harbour since the early 16th century, making them one of the earliest settlers of the island. They sold fish and fruits to the trading vessels that passed the area.

The Orang Gelam came from a tribe in Batam Island. They were brought by the Temenggong of Johor together with a group of his followers to establish a settlement in the first decade of the 19th century. Many of the Orang Gelam who lived along the Singapore River served as boatmen for merchant ships while their womenfolk were fruit sellers on boats.

The Orang Laut differed from the Malays in that they lived a nomadic lifestyle and lived at sea in their boats whereas the Malays lived in settlements in the villages on the land. One example of an Orang Laut is Mohammed Abdul Rahmah.

===The Malays Proper (Johor-Riau)===

When Raffles came to Singapore, there were already hundreds of indigenous Malays and orang laut living there. They were made up of the nobility that was headed by the Temenggong, the palace officials and his followers as well as the Orang Laut. Subsequently, the numbers increased with the arrivals of other Malays from Malaya and the Malay Archipelago.

In a matter of several months, hundreds of Malays from Malacca came to Singapore, encouraged by the British who wanted to develop Singapore as a centre for trade and administration. When Singapore became more developed and there were better economic opportunities, many Malays from Johor, Riau Islands, Sumatra, Penang and Malacca came to Singapore. Many of these Malays lived in the towns and worked there. The census for 1931 showed that the total number of Malay men working here were as many as 11,290. Out of this number, 18% worked as fishermen and as many as 12% lived by farming the land.

In the 1930s and 1950s, many Malay residents from Malaya were working in the British uniformed services. In 1957 alone, there were more than 10,000 Malays working in the uniform services because the British preferred them to the Javanese or Malays from Indonesia (Betts, 1975:41; Djamour, 1959:5). However, during the period 1957–1970, most of them returned to Malaysia when their terms of services ended.

===The Javanese===
The largest Malay sub-group were the Javanese. They came from Java in the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia). In the 1931 Population Census, the number of Javanese in Singapore was 16,063. The 1981 Population Census, however, showed that they made up 6% of the Malay population. However, many Javanese had actually registered themselves as &#x27;Malay&#x27;. It is likely that the actual percentage of the Javanese within the Malay population was much higher. An ethnographic study in 1990 estimated that approximately 50–60% of Singaporean Malays have at least some degree of Javanese ancestry. The Javanese came to Singapore in stages. In the mid-19th century, they came and worked as ironsmiths, leather makers as well as spice merchants and religious books dealers. There were also a group of Javanese printers and publishers in the Arab Street area. There were also a community of pilgrim brokers that played an important role in encouraging the migration of the Javanese to Singapore. There are many Singapore&#x27;s area and neighborhoods that has Javanese names such as Kampong Java, Radin Mas, Kampong Pachitan, Kampong Wak Hassan, Kampong Kembangan, and others.
The political situation in the Dutch East Indies created by the Dutch government caused many Javanese to go through Singapore to travel to Mecca to perform the Hajj. From the mid-19th century until 1910, between 2,000 and 7,000 Javanese travelled to Mecca through Singapore until the regulations were eased (Roff 1967:39). Usually, these pilgrims would work in Singapore for several months or years before or after performing the hajj to earn money or pay their debts to their pilgrim brokers. Many of them stayed in Singapore and became part of the Muslim community in the city (Roff, 1967:43).

A number of Javanese also came to Singapore with the help of the pilgrim brokers. They came voluntarily and a majority of them were young men who stayed in the lodgings of the pilgrim brokers until they found work. They worked as food sellers, gardeners and provided labour for the pilgrim brokers to build lodging homes for them. The pilgrim brokers also took in bonded labourers who worked for Malay or Javanese employers to clear forests to set up settlements in Johor, Malaya (Roff, 1967:37). The activities with these bonded labourers continued until the 1920s. From 1886 till 1890, as many as 21,000 Javanese became bonded labourers with the Singapore Chinese Protectorate, an organisation formed by the British in 1877 to monitor the Chinese population. They performed manual labour in the rubber plantations. After their bond ended, they continued to open up the land and stayed on in Johor.

After the Second World War, the total number of Javanese coming to Singapore continued to increase. The first wave consisted of conscript labour that was brought by the Japanese and their numbers were estimated to be about 10,000 (Turnbull, 1976:216). The second wave were those who moved to Singapore through Malaya. The 1970 Population Census showed that a total of 21,324 Malays who were born in Malaya (later Malaysia) had moved to Singapore in the years 1946–1955, and as many as 29,679 moved to Singapore from 1956–1970 (Census 1970:262-3). Interviews conducted showed that a majority of them were young men of Javanese descent from Johor who wanted to find a better life in Singapore. Most of them were not educated and not highly skilled and worked as manual labourers in the post-war years.

In the 2010 census, Malays of Javanese descent numbered 89,000.

===The Baweanese/Boyanese===
The Baweanese or Boyanese originally came from the Bawean Island in the Dutch East Indies (modern-day Indonesia). They built the Kampung Boyan (Boyanese Village) by the banks of the Rochor River, between Jalan Besar and Syed Alwi Road since the time of Munshi Abdullah. Most of them came to Singapore in the late 19th century until the end of Second World War. The majority of them worked as horse cart drivers and later as motorcar drivers. They could not be considered poor as their lands in Bawean were fertile; they had come in search of cash earnings. They wanted to purchase jewellery made of gold and goods that they could bring back to their villages. Some also wanted to build a better life for themselves in Singapore.

Most of them were young men who came and supported themselves, living in communal houses. There were several such houses built in Singapore. They were found in places like Adam Communal House in Ann Siang Hill, Teluk Dalam Communal House in Dixon Road and Dedawang Communal House in Sophie Road. There was also a village within the town area that was inhabited by the Baweanese called Kampung Kapur (literally &#x27;Lime Village&#x27;) in the western part of Kampung Boyan (Boyan Village). A mosque called the Masjid Bawean Kampung Kapur (Bawean Mosque of Lime Village) located at Weld Road was built in 1932. There was also a communal house that became the gathering point for writers and their friends from the literary group called Jejak Kembara (literally &#x27;Wanderers&#x27; Steps&#x27;) in the late 1970s.

Due to the fact that they shared the same religion and were closely related racially, both the Baweanese and the Javanese were able to mix freely and even intermarried with the Malays. In time, this caused the differences between them to be less obvious and more Baweanese and Javanese began identifying themselves as Malays.

===The Bugis===
The Bugis came from Sulawesi Island in Indonesia. They were well known for a long time as maritime traders. In the mid-seventeenth century, the Bugis were spreading out from Celebes to set up trading centres throughout the region. Often they had to sail to distant lands and fight indigenous tribes. They rarely lost and acquired a reputation as fierce warriors.

The Dutch control of the Dutch East Indies and their blockades cut off the Bugis from their traditional spice trade routes from Celebes to Java. This forced them to migrate to other areas to continue trading. Their migration to what is today Malaysia and Riau Archipelago began around the 18th century or even earlier. Their influence in Riau was strong. Among the Bugis traders were also members of the nobility like Engku Karaeng Talibak who married the daughter of Raja Ali Haji. According to Raja Ali Haji in his work, &quot;Tuhfat al-Nafis&quot;, the presence of Karaeng Talibak brought more Bugis traders to Riau.

In 1819, conflicts between the Dutch and Bugis result in a number of Bugis leaving Riau, and soon after Raffles arrival to Singapore, a group of 500 Bugis led by Chieftain Arong Bilawa fled to Singapore. By the time of the first census in 1824, there were 1,951 Bugis recorded in Singapore, over 18% of the island&#x27;s population of 10,683. The establishment of a free port in Singapore allowed the Bugis to expand their network in the archipelago. Sailing from Sumatra to north Australia, the Bugis ships brought cargoes of cotton cloth, gold dust, birds-of-paradise feathers, pepper, trepang (sea cucumbers), sandalwood, tortoiseshell, coffee, and rice to Singapore. Most of these goods were very much in demand by the Chinese merchants in Singapore. The Bugis also traded in slaves.

James Cameron gave a description in 1865 of the various ships that would visit Singapore&#x27;s harbour. According to him, each year during October and November, the Bugis ships would come from Bali and the Celebes.

By the 1830s, the Bugis had established themselves in Singapore and formed the majority of the pioneer communities in the Kampung Gelam area. By 1831, the Census of Population reported over 2,000 Bugis in Singapore. The Bugis gradually formed kampongs and settlements in places like Kampung Bugis (around the Kallang River), Kampung Soopoo, Jalan Pelatok and Jalan Pergam. The number of Bugis however would decline as they lost their dominance in the sea trade, and by 1860, there were only about 900 Bugis left in Singapore. Many of them also became assimilated into the larger Malay community. Many Bugis pioneers and historical figures are buried in Jalan Kubor Cemetery.

===The Minangkabaus===
The Minangkabau people came from Western Sumatra. The Minangkabaus are known for their matrilineal social system and their tradition for travelling. The Minangkabaus would leave their homes and travel in search of work, knowledge and experience. They would usually return home once they had fulfilled their objective. This tradition of travelling was a rite of passage for the young Minangkabau men and was considered a way for them to be in touch with the outside world.

The Minangkabaus have been migrating to Malaysia and Singapore since long ago. In the 19th century, the cross-strait traders from Payakumbuh and Tanah Datar of Minangkabau Highlands brought agricultural products from the interior of Sumatra to be sold at the port of Singapore. In the first half of 20th century, the majority of Minangkabaus who came to Singapore came from Pariaman and Agam in Western Sumatra. This only stopped when Malaya achieved independence from the British in 1957, when the immigration laws were tightened. The majority of Minangkabaus were engaged in business, apart as religious teachers and politician. They sold religious items, toys and clothes in Arab Street and Geylang. Another Minang business that is quite well-known in Singapore is the Padang restaurant that sells Nasi Padang. The Minangkabaus even formed an association at one time but this was subsequently banned during the 1962–66 Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation. Then in 1995, they established the Singapore Minangkabau Association with a mission to preserve and promote the Minangkabau culture in Singapore.

After Singapore became an independent state in 1965, the majority of Minangkabaus either migrated to Malaysia or returned to Sumatra. Those who stayed in Singapore assimilated into the Malay community. Not many Minangkabaus brought their wives or women with them to Singapore. As such, many married the local Malay women and did not maintain strong ties with the other Minangkabau communities. By 1973, it was estimated that there were 200 Minangkabau families in Singapore and almost all of them were Singaporean residents.

===The Banjar===
The Banjar people originated from the southern and eastern coast of Kalimantan in Borneo. Most came from Banjarmasin in the area surrounding the Barito basin. These areas were used for the cultivation of paddy. The Banjarese who migrated to the Malay Peninsula were farmers who were experienced in paddy cultivation. They also migrated to spread Islam to the region, to escape poverty and the oppressive Dutch rule of their homeland. Some also wanted to escape the presence of wild animals that threatened their farms in Kalimantan.

The Banjarese generally did not like to be employees. They preferred to be self-employed, working as either farmers or businessmen. The Banjar were also well known as jewel cutters and dealers in the region. Many came to Singapore to deal in the jewellery trade and had their shops in Arab Street. They even formed a Kalimantan Association in Singapore.

The Banjarese made up a very small percentage of the Malay population in Singapore. In 1931, they numbered 445 out of a total Malay population of 65,104 (0.7%). In 1947, they formed only 0.3% of the population. This dropped to 0.2% in 1957 and 0.1% in 1970. By 1980 and 1990, the total numbers could not be determined, probably because the Banjarese have effectively assimilated into the Malay community.

===The Batak===
The Batak people are the smallest Malay group in Singapore. Up till 1978, there were less than 350 Bataks in Singapore. Unlike other Malay groups that are predominantly Muslim, the Batak are largely Christians (Lutheran, Seventh-Day Adventist).

The Batak had been coming to Singapore before the 20th century. Not much is known about the Bataks that came to Singapore in the 19th century and before World War 2. Most were young men in their twenties who were from the Toba, Mandailing and Angkola people.
The Bataks came to Singapore for economic, educational and social reasons. Most of those who came to Singapore before the War had received their primary education in the Batak and Malay language. Some came to Singapore to continue their education in the private and Christian schools. For example, the Seventh-day Adventist organisation had students&#x27; amenities in Singapore in 1915 and they encouraged the Bataks from Sipirok, Angkola and Pematang Siantar in Sumatra to send their children to continue their studies in Singapore. An English education was prized as it was seen as a passport to getting a white-collar job in the plantations in Eastern Sumatra that were owned by the Dutch and the Americans. After receiving their education in Singapore, the Bataks would return to their homeland. Some would marry and bring their wives to Singapore. The Batak Christians were the first Bataks to bring their wives to Singapore.

Most of the Bataks who came before World War 2 worked as gardeners, peons and manual labourers. During the Japanese Occupation, the Bataks were conscripted as foot soldiers or forced labourers by the Japanese. Some were sent to Singapore for military training. After the War, many of the Bataks returned home. At the same time, many others came to Singapore from places like Medan, Palembang and the Riau Islands. Some managed to find work as clerks, storekeepers and some started businesses with non-Bataks partners. Some also joined the British army as soldiers, technicians and electricians. Others started identifying themselves as Malays so that they could join the military or get jobs given to local Malays.

In 1947, the Bataks in Singapore formed a welfare organisation called &quot;Saroha&quot; (&quot;one heart&quot; in the Batak language). The aim of the organisation was to help the Bataks in Singapore. The organisation lasted until 1954 and was disbanded due to leadership problems and a lack of support from its members. Attempts to revive it later in 1958 proved futile.

There were Bataks who took Malay wives and converted to Islam. The majority of them and their descendants were assimilated into the Malay community and preferred to be known as Malays.

==Ethnic composition of Malay population 1931–1990==
The following figures show the composition of the various Malay ethnic population in Singapore for the past 60 years. The great increase shown in the other Malay groups, especially the Javanese, in 1990 is likely due to the increase in the employment of Indonesian domestic workers in Singapore.

==Culture==
Many aspects of Singaporean Malay culture includes:

===Cuisine===

There is several major local Singaporean Malay foods that was famous among the community. It includes, among others,:
*Sup Tulang Merah
*Mee Rebus
*Mee Siam
*Bihun Singapura
*Epok-Epok (Curry Puff)
*Nasi Lemak
*Ayam masak merah
*Putu piring
*Beef rendang

At the same time, there is also several major non-Malay cuisines that is predominantly popular among the Malay/Muslim community as it is not only delicious, but also certified as Halal. Most of the cuisines are predominantly refers to Middle Eastern (Arab) cuisine, (southern) Indian cuisine, South Korean cuisine etc.
*Nasi Arab (Mandi Rice)
*Rojak India
*Thosai
*Vadai
*Kimchi
*Bulgogi
*Kek Lapis (Layer Cake)
*Mee kolok (beef and/or chicken only)

===Dialects and languages===
Malay is the national language of Singapore and one of its official languages. It is written in a Roman script known as Rumi. It is the home language of 15% of the Singaporean population. Malay is also the ceremonial national language and used in the national anthem of Singapore, in citations for Singapore orders and decorations and military foot drill commands, mottos of several organisations, and is the variety taught in Singapore&#x27;s language education system.

Linguistically, the Malay spoken in Singapore is similar to that of in Johore south of Malay Peninsula and the Riau Archipelago; though one journal notes that the variety is &quot;much influenced by [Singapore&#x27;s] proximity to Java. The now-relocated Orang Laut of the Southern Islands were recorded to have spoken a variety of Malay that velarizes its rhotic consonant (as /ɣ/) in contrast to the flap (/ɾ/) in the variety heard in the main island. Some of the old generations of people now identified as &quot;Malay&quot; in Singapore can also converse in languages belonging to their original ethnolinguistic immigrant groups like Javanese, Bawean, Buginese, Banjarese, Minangkabau and Batak; this however has decreased dramatically among the younger generation.

Prior to independence, Singapore was a centre for Malay literature and Malay culture. However, after independence, this cultural role declined. Singapore is an observer to the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia Language Council which plays a role in synchronizing pluricentric Malay standards, however it has not applied to be a member. It nonetheless applies standardisations agreed to in this forum, and follows the Malaysian standard when there are disagreements. Standards within the country are set by the Malay Language Council of Singapore. There are some differences between the official standard and colloquial usage. While the historical standard was the Johor-Riau dialect, a new cultivated accent known as &quot;sebutan baku&quot; (lit. &#x27;standard pronunciation&#x27;) or &quot;bahasa baku&quot; (lit. &#x27;standard language&#x27;) was adopted in 1956 by the Third Malay language and Literary Congress. This variation was chosen to create consistency between the written word and the spoken pronunciation. However, implementation was slow, with Malaysia only fully adopting it in the educational system in 1988, with Singapore introducing it at the primary school level in 1993. Despite expanding use in formal education, it has not replaced the Johor-Riau pronunciation for most speakers. The artificial creation of the accent means there are no truly native speakers, and the pronunciation is closer to Indonesian than it is to Johor-Riau. There has also been cultural resistance, with accent differences between older and younger generations leading to questions surrounding Malay cultural identity. This question was further sharpened by Malaysia dropping &quot;sebutan baku&quot; in 2000, returning to the traditional use of Johor-Riau.

===Holidays and festivities===
Some of the major Muslim festivals celebrated every year among the Singapore&#x27;s Malay/Muslim community include Hari Raya Aidilfitri, Hari Raya Haji, Maal Hijrah and Maulidur Rasul, with the minor festivals includes Israk &amp; Mikraj, Awal Ramadhan, Nuzul Alquran and Arafah Day. It is just as similar as their Muslim neighbour countries that was celebrated in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam. However, only Hari Raya Aidilfitri and Hari Raya Haji is recognised and gazetted as Muslim religious public holiday in Singapore despite the significant presence of Malay/Muslim community as indigenous in the country. Previously, Maulidur Rasul (birthday of Prophet Mohamed) has been recognised as public holiday prior to 1968 amendment of the 1966 Holidays Act, where since that two public holidays were designated each for both Muslim and Christian as well as one for Hindu community. It is implemented in purpose to improve business competitiveness and valid until now.

Prior to the fasting month of Ramadan and Syawal, most Malay/Muslim settlements and streets will decorated with green-based or colourful decoration of Eid such as lights, &quot;Ketupat&quot;, &quot;pelita api&quot; (fire lamp) and many more, with most of them centered in Geylang Serai as the main Malay settlement area in Singapore. During the fasting month, &quot;Bazar Ramadhan&quot; (Ramadan bazaar(s)) are the most famous events during the holy month where it provides diverse foods and beverages (F&amp;B). The popular F&amp;Bs includes Mee Rebus, Air Kathira, Roti John, Nasi Arab, Vadai etc. While moving to the month of Syawal, almost all Malay/Muslim families and organisations will hold &quot;Rumah Terbuka Aidilfitri&quot; (Eid openhouse(s)), where all communities regardless of ethnics and religions are not only having a chance to meet and greet their Muslim friends and relatives, but at the same time they are also invited to a variety of dishes that are commonly served during Aidilfitri. The Aidilfitri popular dishes in Singapore are relatively similar to Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam such as Rendang, Lemang and Ketupat, as well as the famous layer cakes from Sarawak, Kek Lapis which is predominantly provided during the sole-month Aidilfitri season.

===Religion===


According to the latest 2020 Census, almost 99% of Singapore&#x27;s Malay population declared themselves Muslims, with small populations of 0.4% non-religious and 0.8% other religions, as stated in the following statistics.

An overwhelming majority of Malays in Singapore are predominantly the followers of Sunni Islam, belonging to the Shāfi&#x27;ī (شافعي) school of thought.

A very small Christian community also exists among the local Malays, with approximately 0.6% of Malays being Christians. There is also a small Buddhist community, mostly consisting of Malays with mixed Chinese and Peranakan ancestry and even there are Hindu minorities, mostly among the Malays with mixed Indian (Tamil) and Chitty ancestry.

==Status of Malays in Singapore==
Malays are recognised and considered as the indigenous people of Singapore by the Singapore Constitution, Part XIII, General Provisions, Minorities and special position of Malays, section 152:

The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.

==Notable Malay Singaporeans==
For Malays in Singapore, the last name is patronymic, not a family name. The person should be referred to by his or her first or second name which is the given name. The Malay word bin (b.) or binte (bte.), if used, means &quot;son of&quot; or &quot;daughter of&quot; respectively.

<doc id="1269056" wikidata="Q15515166" url="?curid=1269056" title="Harry Lee (sheriff)">
<text>Harry Lee (August 27, 1932 – October 1, 2007) was an American law enforcement officer best known as the long-time sheriff of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. He was first elected in 1979 as the thirtieth sheriff, and was re-elected six times, having served twenty-eight years and six months.

==Early years and legal career==
Lee attended Francis T. Nicholls High School and graduated from Louisiana State University with a degree in geology. He also served in the Air Force and after being honorably discharged in 1959, Lee returned to Louisiana to manage his father&#x27;s restaurant, The House of Lee. Lee was elected president of the New Orleans Chapter of the Louisiana Restaurant Association in 1964. His leadership was instrumental in the peaceful racial integration of New Orleans restaurants, in compliance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

At this time, he also attended Loyola University New Orleans School of Law, where he was elected president of the student chapter of the Bar Association. Lee graduated in 1967 and started a small law practice in Gretna with Loyola classmate Marion Edwards (not to be confused with the brother of future Governor Edwin Washington Edwards - whom Lee was a very avid supporter of - who shares the same name).

Lee was appointed as a magistrate judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in 1971. He was elected president of the National Council of United States Magistrates in 1973. He was invited to join the congressional delegation to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1972, which was led by House Majority Leader Hale Boggs from Louisiana, and House Minority Leader and future U.S. President Gerald Ford. He resigned as a Federal Magistrate in 1975 and was appointed Parish Attorney for Jefferson Parish.

==Political career==
Lee was elected sheriff in 1979, having defeated long-time incumbent Alwynn Cronvich. He was re-elected every four years from 1983 to 2003. He was credited with keeping the crime rate low for the past twenty-five years, while the rate in neighboring Orleans Parish remains one of the highest in the nation.

In 1989, Lee deplored the choice of David Duke and John S. Treen standing as Republicans for the vacancy in state House District 81 created by the resignation of Charles Cusimano, who became a state court judge. To Lee, the showdown in the special election was a choice between &quot;a bigot and an asshole.&quot;
A Democrat, Lee ran for governor in 1995 but dropped out before the primary. He famously said, &quot;why would I want to be governor when I can be king?&quot; Lee endorsed Mike Foster, a Republican who came from behind in the polls to win the governorship and to serve two terms. He also endorsed Bobby Jindal for governor in 2003, his bid for Congress in 2004, 2006 reelection and again for governor in 2007.

Lee, one of the best-known politicians in the Greater New Orleans Area, was known as a zealous crime fighter. He also gained a reputation as an anti-corruption reformer while serving as the Parish Attorney for Jefferson Parish. Lee was a political insider in Louisiana, and had close personal contacts with former Governor Edwards and the Boggs family in New Orleans. He often made controversial statements to the local media. He showed unwavering loyalty to his deputies during allegations of police brutality in Jefferson Parish. He had also shown support for other Louisiana politicians during several federal investigations of government corruption, including the investigation and eventual conviction of Edwards. Many of these politicians were personal friends of Lee, but Lee himself was never charged with corruption.

Lee also defended gambling and claimed abuses were no more severe that those with addictions to alcohol and tobacco. He earmarked gambling revenues for jail buildings and maintenance. Without video poker, Lee said that Jefferson Parish would lose nearly $4 million annually in public revenues.

===Hurricane Katrina===
Lee maintained a strong presence during Hurricane Katrina. Most memorably, the morning before Katrina hit New Orleans, Lee appeared on emergency radio, with a message for those who had not yet evacuated: &quot;You better haul ass! Y&#x27;all should have left yesterday.&quot; The previous evening, he had let the community know that his birthday party had been cancelled.

Lee was one of the few New Orleans politicians to maintain his pre-Katrina popularity. During the storm, Parish President Aaron Broussard evacuated all parish personnel directly under his control to St. Tammany Parish on the Northshore, including the drainage pump operators. This is widely considered the primary cause of flooding on the Eastbank of Jefferson Parish. However, the Sheriff&#x27;s Office in Jefferson Parish is independent of the Parish President and operates directly under an elected sheriff.

When storm conditions dissipated, Jefferson Parish deputies immediately began patrolling all major commercial roads and even individual neighborhoods in the Parish. Most of the Parish at this time had been evacuated, and communications were nearly non-existent. Parish deputies were the only form of security in the Parish in the first week after the storm.

Most of the looting that did take place in Jefferson Parish occurred in Terrytown and Gretna, which borders on Algiers and the Crescent City Connection. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff&#x27;s Office has jurisdiction over all of unincorporated Jefferson Parish, while incorporated cities such as Gretna, Kenner, Harahan and Westwego have their own independent city governments and police departments. In the first week after the storm, Sheriff Lee and Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson Jr ordered Gretna police officers and Jefferson Parish deputies to set up a roadblock on the Crescent City Connection and prevent New Orleans evacuees from crossing. This action has been praised by some Gretna residents but criticized by many Orleans Parish elected officials. Lee was named as a co-defendant in the subsequent lawsuits, as he was directly involved in ordering the bridge barricaded.
== Personal life ==
Lee is the older brother of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s first Asian-American centerfold, China Lee.

Lee&#x27;s family is affiliated with the Chinese Presbyterian Church in Kenner. Since his death, unused funds totalling more than $250,000 from his campaign war chest have been donated to the church in accordance to his will.

== Death ==
Lee died five days after returning from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston for his latest round of treatment for leukemia. His death came less than three weeks before he hoped to win an eighth term in office. Lee had qualified to run in the October 20 primary against Harahan Police Chief Peter Dale and contractor Julio Castillo. State law requires qualifying to reopen if a candidate dies before the election is held.

On September 30, WWL-TV reported that Lee was hospitalized in serious condition due to complications from leukemia. Lee was reportedly having breathing problems and was taken to the Ochsner Medical Center. He died at 10:44 a.m. on October 1, 2007, and was interred four days later at Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans.

Shortly after Lee&#x27;s death, the primary election for sheriff was moved from October 20 to November 17, and Newell Normand, a Republican, was appointed as the interim sheriff. Normand, who had been the chief deputy since 1995, was elected as the sheriff with over 90% of the vote and held the office until 2017.

In 2001, Lee was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. Only five other sheriffs have been so designated, including Cat Doucet and Jessel Ourso.

<text>Richard Marlin Perkins (March 28, 1905 – June 14, 1986) was an American zoologist. He is best known as the host of the television program &quot;Mutual of Omaha&#x27;s Wild Kingdom&quot; from 1963 to 1985.

==Life and career==

Perkins was born on March 28, 1905, in Carthage, Missouri, the youngest of three sons of Joseph Dudley Perkins and Mynta Mae (née Miller) Perkins. When he was seven years old, his mother nursed him through a serious bout of pneumonia and died of the illness herself. His grieving father sent Marlin&#x27;s two older brothers to private school, and Marlin was sent to his Aunt Laura&#x27;s farm in Pittsburg, Kansas. He attended public school there through eighth grade. In the fall of 1919, he entered Wentworth Military Academy. There, Perkins demonstrated his fascination with snakes by keeping North American racers in his room. One afternoon, while exercising them on a lawn at the back of the barracks, he was spotted by a faculty officer and got in trouble for handling them.

Perkins briefly attended the University of Missouri, but quit school to become a laborer at the Saint Louis Zoological Park. He rose through the ranks, becoming the reptile curator in 1928. After being hired as a curator of the Buffalo Zoological Park in Buffalo, New York, Perkins was eventually promoted to director in 1938. He then served as director at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, Illinois, starting in 1944. In 1957, in a famous case, he sent a snake that was difficult to identify from the zoo to the herpetologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, Dr. Karl P. Schmidt. Schmidt carelessly allowed the snake to bite him not believing that its venom would be enough to harm him. The snake was a very deadly boomslang. Schmidt maintained a scientific diary noting his symptoms over the course of the 24 hours in which it took him to die. (The venom is an anticoagulant, causing the person to bleed to death.)

In 1962, Perkins returned to the St. Louis Zoo, this time as director. During his time at the Lincoln Park Zoo, Perkins joined Sir Edmund Hillary as the zoologist for Hillary&#x27;s 1960 Himalayan expedition to search for the legendary Yeti.

Perkins was the host of &quot;Zoo Parade&quot;, a television program that originated from the Lincoln Park Zoo on NBC station WNBQ-TV (now WMAQ-TV) when he was the director there. During a rehearsal of &quot;Zoo Parade&quot;, he was bitten by a timber rattlesnake, one of several bites from venomous snakes Perkins suffered throughout his career (over the years he was also bitten by a cottonmouth and a Gaboon viper). Although the incident occurred during a pre-show rehearsal and was not filmed, it has become something of an urban legend, with many people &quot;remembering&quot; seeing Perkins receive the bite on television (an example of what is known as a &quot;false memory&quot;).

As a result of his work on &quot;Zoo Parade&quot;, Perkins was offered the job in 1963 for which most North Americans remember him: host of the nature show &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot;. The fame he gained in his television career allowed him to become an advocate for the protection of endangered species, and through &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; he gave many Americans their first exposure to the conservation movement. Perkins also helped establish the Wild Canid Survival and Research Center (WCSRC) near St. Louis in 1971. This wolf sanctuary has been instrumental in breeding wolves for eventual re-placement into their natural habitats.

Perkins retired from active zookeeping in 1970 and from &quot;Wild Kingdom&quot; in 1985 for health reasons. Perkins remained with the Saint Louis Zoo as Director Emeritus until his death on June 14, 1986, of cancer.

==Honors==
Perkins received an American Education Award in 1974. He was also granted honorary doctoral degrees from the then University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri; Northland College in Ashland, Wisconsin; Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Missouri; MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Illinois; and the College of Saint Mary in Omaha, Nebraska.

In 1990, Perkins was inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame. A statue of Perkins also stands in Central Park in his hometown of Carthage, Missouri.

==Personal life==
Perkins married his first wife, Elise More, in 1933; they were divorced in 1953. Their daughter, Suzanne, was born in 1937. Perkins married his second wife, Carol Morse Cotsworth, in 1960; they remained married until his death. Perkins died on June 14, 1986, from lymphatic cancer.

<doc id="1269061" wikidata="Q63035" url="?curid=1269061" title="Rudolf von Gneist">
<text>Heinrich Rudolf Hermann Friedrich von Gneist (13 August 1816 – 22 July 1895) was a German jurist and politician. Born in Berlin, he was the son of a judge attached to the city&#x27;s &quot;Kammergericht&quot; (Court of Appeal). Gneist had a significant influence on his student Max Weber and also contributed to Japan&#x27;s first constitution through his communication with Itō Hirobumi.

== Biography ==
After receiving his secondary education at the gymnasium at Eisleben in Prussian Saxony, Gneist entered the Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin in 1833 as a student of jurisprudence, and became a pupil of the famous Roman law teacher Savigny. Proceeding to the degree of &quot;doctor juris&quot; in 1838, young Gneist immediately established himself as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; in the faculty of law. He had, however, already chosen the judicial branch of the legal profession as a career, and having while yet a student acted as Auscultator, was admitted &quot;Assessor&quot; in 1841.

He soon found leisure and opportunity to fulfill a much-cherished wish, and spent the next few years on an extended tour of Italy, France and England. He used his &quot;&quot; (&quot;journeyman&#x27;s year&quot;) for the purposes of comparative study; upon on his return in 1844, he was appointed extraordinary professor of Roman law in the University of Berlin, and thus began a professorial connection which ended only with his death. The first fruits of his activity as a teacher were seen in his brilliant work, &quot;Die formellen Verträge des heutigen römischen Obligationen-Rechtes&quot; (Berlin, 1845). &quot;Pari passu&quot; with his academic labors he continued his judicial career, and became in due course successively assistant judge of the superior court and of the supreme tribunal. But to a mind constituted such as his, the want of elasticity in the procedure of the courts was galling. In the preface to his &quot;Englische Verfassungsgeschichte&quot;, Gneist writes that he was brought up &quot;in the laborious and rigid school of Prussian judges, at a time when the duty of formulating the matter in litigation was entailed upon the judge who personally conducted the pleadings, I became acquainted both with the advantages possessed by the Prussian bureau system as also with its weak points.&quot; Feeling the necessity for fundamental reforms in legal procedure, he published, in 1849, his &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;, in which, after pointing out that the origin of that institution was common to both Germany and England, and showing in a masterly way the benefits which had accrued to the latter country through its more extended application, he pleaded for its freer admission in the tribunals of his own country.

The period of storm and stress in 1848 afforded Gneist an opportunity for which he had yearned, and he threw himself with ardor into the constitutional struggles of Prussia. Although his candidature for election to the National Assembly of that year was unsuccessful, he felt that the die was cast, and, deciding upon a political career, retired from his judicial position in 1850. Entering the ranks of the National Liberal Party, he began both in writing and speeches actively to champion their cause, now busying himself pre-eminently with the study of constitutional law and history. In 1853 his &quot;Adel und Rittershaft&quot; was published in England, and in 1857 the &quot;Geschichte und heutige Gestalt der Ämter in England&quot;, a pamphlet primarily written to combat the Prussian abuses of government, but which the author also claimed had not been without its effect in modifying certain views that had until then ruled in England itself. In 1858 Gneist was appointed ordinary professor of Roman law.

Also in 1858, he commenced his parliamentary career by his election for Stettin to the Prussian House of Representatives, in which assembly he sat thenceforward uninterruptedly until 1893.
Joining the Left, he at once became one of its leading spokesmen. His chief oratorical triumphs are associated with the early period of his membership of the House; two noteworthy occasions being his violent attack (September 1862) upon the government budget in connection with the reorganization of the Prussian army, and his defense (1864) of the Polish chiefs of the Province of Posen, who were accused of high treason.

He was a great admirer of the English constitution, and during 1857 to 1863 published &quot;Das heutige englische Verfassungs- und Verwaltungsrecht&quot; (Contemporary English constitutional law and administration). This work aimed at exercising political pressure upon the government of the day by contrasting English and German constitutional law and administration.
In 1868 Gneist became a member of the North German parliament, and acted as a member of the commission for organizing the federal army, and also of that for the settlement of controversial ecclesiastical questions. On the establishment of German unity his mandate was renewed for the Reichstag, and there he served as an active and prominent member of the National Liberal party, until 1884. In the Kulturkampf he sided with the government against the attacks of the Clericals, whom he bitterly denounced, and whose implacable enemy he ever showed himself. In 1879, together with his colleague, Hänel, he violently attacked the motion for the prosecution of certain socialist members, which as a result of the vigor of his opposition was almost unanimously rejected. He was parliamentary reporter for the committees on all great financial and administrative questions, and his profound acquaintance with constitutional law caused his advice to be frequently sought, not only in his own but also in other countries. In Prussia he greatly influenced legislation, the reform of the judicial and penal systems and the new constitution of the Evangelical Church being largely his work. In 1875, he was appointed a member of the supreme administrative court (&quot;Oberverwaltungsgericht&quot;) of Prussia, but only held office for two years.

He was also consulted by the Japanese government when a constitution was being introduced into that country. In 1882, Japanese Prime Minister of Japan Itō Hirobumi and a delegation from Japan visited Europe to study the government systems of various western nations. They met Gneist in Berlin, and he instructed them in constitutional law for a six-month period. The Constitution of the Empire of Japan reflects Gneist&#x27;s conservatism in limiting the powers of the parliament, and strengthening those of the cabinet. His student, Albert Mosse, was later dispatched to Japan as a legal advisor to the Meiji government.

In 1882 was published his &quot;Englische Verfassungsgeschichte&quot; (trans. &quot;History of the English Constitution&quot;, London, 1886), which may perhaps be described as his &quot;. It placed the author at once on the level of such writers on English constitutional history as Hallam and Stubbs, and supplied English jurisprudence with a text-book almost unrivalled in its of historical research. In 1888 one of the first acts of the ill-fated Friedrich III, German Emperor, who as crown prince had always shown great admiration for Gneist, was to ennoble him, and attach him as instructor in constitutional law to his son, Wilhelm II, German Emperor. The last years of his life were full of energy, and, in the possession of all his faculties, he continued his academic labors until a short time before his death.

Perhaps it should not be said that Gneist&#x27;s career as a politician was entirely successful. In a country where parliamentary institutions are the living exponents of the popular will he might have risen to a foremost position in the state; as it was, the party to which he allied himself could never hope to become more than what it remained, a parliamentary faction, and the influence it for a time wielded in the counsels of the state waned as soon as the Social-Democratic party grew to be a force to be reckoned with. It is as a writer and a teacher that Gneist is best known to posterity. He was a jurist of a special type: to him law was not mere theory, but a living force; and this conception of its power animates all his schemes of practical reform. As a teacher he exercised a magnetic influence, not only for the clearness and cogency of his exposition, but also because of the success with which he developed the talents and guided the aspirations of his pupils. He was a man of noble bearing, religious, and imbued with a stern sense of duty. He was proud of being a Junker, and throughout his writings, despite their liberal tendencies, may be perceived the loyalty and affection with which he clung to monarchical institutions.

== Works ==

<text>Taravana is a disease often found among Polynesian island natives who habitually dive deep without breathing apparatus many times in close succession, usually for food or pearls. These free-divers may make 40 to 60 dives a day, each of 30 or 40 metres (100 to 140 feet).

Taravana seems to be decompression sickness. The usual symptoms are vertigo, nausea, lethargy, paralysis and death. The word &quot;taravana&quot; is Tuamotu Polynesian for &quot;to fall crazily&quot;. 

Taravana is also used to describe someone who is &quot;crazy because of the sea&quot;.

<text>Lemuel Dole Nelme (born c1718 died 1786) was an English craftsman, now remembered for wide-reaching theories on language.

==Life==

The son of a Leominster clothworker, he was apprenticed to Thomas Clarke, citizen and fishmonger 6 April 1732 and made free of the City of London in 1743. He was a maker of instruments and dealer in ships&#x27; merchandise of the eighteenth century. His son Lemuel Jones Nelme was baptized at King&#x27;s Weighouse Chapel 19 August 1749. Nelme was in business in Exchange Alley in London around 1750. He held a Government post as Clerk in 1764, and participated in the Royal Society of Arts at the end of the 1760s. He was buried at Stepney 19 March 1786. His wife Sarah survived him. His will was proved in the Prerogative court of Canterbury on 19 Mar 1786. He mentions his grandfather John Dole of Rangeworthy, Gloucestershire. The lord of the Rangeworthy and Alderley manors was Matthew Hale, Chief Justice of King&#x27;s Bench. Matthew Hale was an only child.

==Language and symbols==

Nelme was the author of &quot;An essay towards an investigation of the origin and elements of language&quot; (1772), a speculative book on the origin of languages, and alphabet symbolism. Nelme was interested in Anglo-Saxon as proto-language, and compiled (or suggested the compilation of) an Anglo-Saxon dictionary. He is said to have deferred later to the theory of Rowland Jones on Celtic as proto-language. Johanna Drucker attributes to Clement of Alexandria&#x27;s &quot;Stromateis&quot; some of his symbolic theory, outlines his version of Biblical history and the &#x27;ol&#x27; (&quot;all&quot;) key to symbols, and reproduces some of his illustrations.

<text>Jaroslav Velinský (December 18, 1932 – February 19, 2012) was a Czech science fiction and detective writer, publisher, songwriter and musician. In the folk arena and among sci-fi friends and fans he was known as Kapitán Kid (other pseudonyms included: Václav Rabský, C.P. Stonebridge and Agáta Bílá).

==Life and career==
Velinský was born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, in 1932. A player of both banjo and swing guitar, he wrote more than 50 country and folk songs, including &quot;Jenofefa&quot;, &quot;Krinolina&quot; and &quot;Mary Celeste&quot;, and was one of the founders of the Czech folk festival, Porta.

His science-fiction books included &quot;Engerlings&quot;, &quot;Notes from Garth&quot;, &quot;Dzwille&quot;, and &quot;Continent of Unlimited Possibilities&quot;. He was an honorary member of the Ertar-Czech Relations Society, a science-fiction club. He wrote eight staged theater plays and more than 30 detective novels based around a detective named Ota Fink, including &quot;Dark Well&quot;, &quot;Man-eater&quot;, &quot;Death of a Midget&quot;, &quot;Lady with a Green Elephant&quot;, &quot;Very Long Stairs&quot;, &quot;Murderer&#x27;s Road&quot;, &quot;Estimated Solution&quot; and others.

Velinský founded a one-man publishing house, the Club of Friends of Captain Kid, the club referring to readers of his books and fans of his music. He used the club&#x27;s data and close contact with his audience to better plan his production. This concerned not just published books and CDs, but deciding between writing music or literature and also selecting themes. The result was a publishing house producing new original books and songs &quot;on demand&quot;.

He was also a miner, metalsmith, and graphic artist.

Velinský died of lung cancer in Ústí nad Labem in February 2012, aged 79.

<text>The Ford MTX-75 (M TransaXle) is a 5-speed transmission developed by Ford Motor Company for its larger-engined front wheel drive models. &quot;75&quot; refers to the distance in millimeters between the main and lay shafts.

==History==
Debuting in 1992, the transmission was developed in tandem with the Zetec family of engines. The transmission is optimised for transferring larger levels of torque than the older iB-series unit used on the Fiesta and Escort models. Other features include the provision of equal length driveshafts (to combat torque steer) and synchromesh on reverse gear.

The transmission was first used on the Zetec-engined Escort Mk V (only XR3i), but its proper intended application was on the Mondeo and its derivatives (the American Ford Contour, Mercury Mystique and the New Edge Mercury/Ford Cougar). The 2000-2004 Focus with 2.0 litre Zetec engine, and the 2.3 liter Duratec engine with manual used this transmission, as well as all diesel powered versions of the Focus. It was also used in the 2.5 and 3.0 V6 versions of the manual transmission equipped Jaguar X-Type.

The main change to the unit was to cable operation in 1996 on the facelifted Mondeo, as the rod-based linkage of the original unit attracted criticism for feeling vague and notchy.

The open differential can be replaced by a plated or ATB Differential for motorsport use - Kaaz, Torsen, MFactory and Quaife offer suitable units.

==VXT-75==
The VXT-75 gearbox is a modified version of the MTX-75, used in the Galaxy (1995–2006) and Transit (2000–) models.

<doc id="1269095" wikidata="Q60486326" url="?curid=1269095" title="Hyundai Santro">
<text>The Hyundai Santro is a city car produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai between 1998 and 2014. The nameplate was revived in 2018 to replace the Eon, and was produced until 2022. The &quot;Santro&quot; nameplate was applied during its first generation to the Atos Prime model, while the second generation is a standalone model.

Hyundai derived the name Santro for the Indian market from Saint-Tropez, a French city famous for fashion, because the company wanted to project it as a ‘fashionable’ car.

== First generation (MX; 1998) ==

The first generation Santro was introduced in 1998 and went on sale in early 1999. It was also sold in Europe as the Atos Prime and in South Korea and Indonesia as the Kia Visto. It was also known as the Santro Zip in India from 1998 to 2006.

Before the Kia Visto was replaced by the Kia Picanto in 2004, the facelifted Santro was launched in 2003. It was known as the Santro Xing in India from 2003 to 2014.

== Second generation (AH2; 2018) ==

The second generation Santro was launched on 23 October 2018 in India. This marked the return of the Santro nameplate in India after four years since the last generation was discontinued and nearly twenty-five years since the start of production. It was positioned below the Hyundai i10.
The model was powered by a 1.1-litre &quot;Epsilon G4HG&quot; petrol which produces at 5,500 rpm and torque at 4,500 rpm. A bi-fuel version of the engine that uses both petrol and CNG is also available. Transmission options consisted of a 5-speed manual and a 5-speed automated manual.

It was one of the Top 3 Urban World Cars of 2019.

The second generation Santro was discontinued in 2022.

=== Safety ===
The Indian version of the Santro with driver airbag scored 2 stars for adult and child occupant protection in the Global NCAP&#x27;s frontal offset crash tests under its Safer Cars for India project in 2019 (similar to Latin NCAP 2013).

<text>Academia Cațavencu (, &quot;The Cațavencu Academy&quot;) is a Romanian satirical magazine founded in 1991 and made famous by its investigative journalism. &quot;Academia Cațavencu&quot; also owns &quot;Radio Guerrilla&quot; , an FM radio station with national coverage ; &quot;Tabu&quot;, a women&#x27;s magazine, &quot;Superbebe&quot;, a magazine for new parents, &quot;Aventuri la pescuit&quot;, a magazine for fishermen, &quot;24-FUN&quot;, a free magazine for teenagers, and &quot;Cotidianul&quot;, a daily newspaper.

In a surprise move, on May 29, 2006, &quot;Academia Cațavencu&quot; press group announced it was being acquired by Realitatea Media, owners of Realitatea TV, and controlled by controversial and elusive businessman Sorin Ovidiu Vântu. Vântu himself has often been a target of enquiries by &quot;Cațavencu&quot; journalists.

==Name==
Nae Cațavencu is a character in Ion Luca Caragiale&#x27;s 1883 comedy &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot; (&quot;A Lost Letter&quot;). An unscrupulous, demagogue politician, Cațavencu uses his newspaper &quot;Răcnetul Carpaților&quot; (&quot;The Yell of the Carpathians&quot;) to blackmail politicians of the opposing party with a compromising love letter that he finds.

==History==
In its current form, &quot;Academia Cațavencu&quot; was founded in 1991, by a team of humourists, investigators, and literates headed by poet and former dissident Mircea Dinescu. Part of the team had previously edited two short-lived satirical papers, &quot;Cațavencu Incomod&quot; and &quot;Cațavencu Internațional&quot;.

Dinescu was editor-in-chief until 1998, when he resigned and went on to create his own publications, &quot;Aspirina săracului&quot; (&quot;The poor man&#x27;s aspirin&quot; – a joking reference to sexual intercourse), and &quot;Plai cu boi&quot; (&quot;Land of the Dumb&quot;), a monthly satirical magazine parodying the style of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

==Current activities==

&quot;Academia Cațavencu&quot; have been long-time press freedom advocates. They maintain a &quot;press monitoring agency&quot;, a watchdog against manipulation through mass-media.

During the 2004 election campaign, Academia Cațavencu published as supplements two parody issues of &quot;Scânteia&quot; (the old-time Romanian Communist Party newspaper), containing reprints of articles written by important current day politicians during the Communist era. Almost 40,000 copies were bought in bulk from newsagents, along with other newspapers . The alleged perpetrators were representatives of the then-governing Social Democratic Party (PSD), whose (mostly former Communist) high members (including founder and former President of Romania Ion Iliescu) were protagonists of the &quot;Cațavencu&quot; special issues.

Apart from political issues, &quot;Academia Cațavencu&quot; organises and/or sponsors a number of cultural and environmental initiatives:
* &quot;Save the Danube Delta&quot;
* &quot;Save Vama Veche&quot;
* &quot;Cu papucii prin deșert&quot; (&quot;Across the Desert in slippers&quot;, a reference to the Dacia car hatchback model) – a humanitarian expedition through the Sahara and down to Senegal

They also develop their own stereotypes and nicknames of the politicians, such as:
* Ion Iliescu &quot;Nelu Cotrocelu&quot; or &quot;Bunicuța&quot; (&quot;The Granny&quot;) – associated with the Cotroceni Palace owl
* Adrian Năstase &quot;Bombonel&quot; (&quot;Candy Boy&quot;) – in reference to his alleged homosexuality
* Traian Băsescu &quot;Popeye Marinarul&quot; (&quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot;) – due to Băsescu&#x27;s former job as a commercial navy captain
* Theodor Stolojan &quot;The robot&quot;, &quot;Robocop&quot; or &quot;Frankie&quot; – due to his voice and comic resemblance to the classic image of Frankenstein&#x27;s monster
* Petre Roman – suggests that he is rather popular among the female workers of the APACA textile factory in Bucharest (whom they reported shouting once: &quot;Nu vrem bani! Nu vrem valută! Vrem pe Roman să ne fută!&quot; (&quot;We don&#x27;t want money! We don&#x27;t want hard currency! We want Roman to fuck us!&quot;).
* Gheorghe Dumitrașcu – suggests that he washes infrequently
* Nicolae Văcăroiu &quot;Votcăroiu&quot; – allegedly heavy drinker of &quot;Săniuța&quot;, a low-grade brand of vodka (&quot;votcă&quot;)
* Șerban Mihăilescu &quot;Miki Șpagă&quot; (&quot;Mickey Bribe&quot;) – corruption allegations
* Marian Vanghelie – he has poor grammatical skills, as coined by Vanghelie&#x27;s frequent and indiscriminate use of &quot;Care este&quot; (&quot;Which is&quot;), as a predicate for singular and plural subjects alike.

<text>Paul Mario Day (born 19 April 1956) is an English singer who was the original lead vocalist of heavy metal band Iron Maiden from 1975 to 1976.

== Iron Maiden ==
Day was the first lead singer for Iron Maiden from December 1975 to October 1976. On the Iron Maiden The Early Days DVD it was mentioned that Day was fired because he did not have enough stage charisma. He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock. Years later he claimed co-authorship of the Iron Maiden song &quot;Strange World&quot;.

== Further activities ==
He later formed a band called More that played at the Donington Monsters of Rock Festival in 1981, and also had onetime Iron Maiden guitarist Paul Todd (who was in Iron Maiden for two days and never recorded or played live and only did a photo session with them), Def Leppard drummer Frank Noone in the line-up. He was lead singer of Wildfire in 1983 to 1984. In 1985 Sweet were re-formed by Andy Scott and Mick Tucker then featuring Paul Day. He recorded a live album at the Marquee Club in London as lead singer of Sweet in 1986. After this engagement he has lived in Australia since 1986 and is the lead vocalist of two bands from Newcastle, New South Wales. He has performed covers of rock songs with the band Defaced and sang and wrote for Crimzon Lake, now disbanded, an unsigned hard rock band. Currently he is in contact with the Australian progressive metal band Buffalo Crows in appearance as a guest musician. He is still claimed to be a New Wave of British Heavy Metal-Style musician.

In 2013, Day recorded vocals for a jingle for Canberra Toyota, a Toyota car dealership located in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory.

Recently, Day is reported to live in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.

42 years after Iron Maiden had been formed, the original 1975-line-up by Steve Harris met in London at 29 December. Only the former drummer Ron Matthews was absent, but Paul Mario Day (vocals), Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance (guitars) appeared.

<doc id="1269100" wikidata="Q702604" url="?curid=1269100" title="Johann Wilhelm Schirmer">
<text>Johann Wilhelm Schirmer (5 September 1807 in Jülich – 11 September 1863 in Karlsruhe) was a German landscape artist born in Jülich, within the Prussian Duchy of Jülich.

==Biography==

Schirmer was started as a student of historical painting under Schadow at the academy of Düsseldorf. Later, he came under the influence of Carl Friedrich Lessing and landscape painting and began painting historical landscapes in the manner of Nicolas Poussin. He became known as one of the first of the Düsseldorf school of painting.

In 1830 he became an Assistant Professor, and later, in 1839, a Professor at the Düsseldorf Academy. In the meantime, he visited and painted in Belgium, the Black Forest, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Normandy and Italy. In 1854, he took up the role of a Director at the Art School at Karlsruhe, where he died.

This artist is sometimes confused with August Wilhelm Ferdinand Schirmer, who had similar interests, and belonged to the same era. In addition, both were known by the name Wilhelm Schirmer, and were students of Wilhelm von Schadow, although at different academic institutions.
==Characteristic works==
Schirmer created romantic, classical and Biblical landscapes, such as: 
* &quot;The Grotto of Egeria&quot; (1842), in the Leipzig Museum
* &quot;Twelve Scenes from the History of Abraham&quot; (1859–62), in the National Gallery at Berlin
* &quot;An Italian Park&quot; at Berlin
* &quot;Nether German landscape&quot; at Leipzig
* A series of 26 Biblical landscapes at the Düsseldorf gallery
* &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; (1857), four landscapes at Karlsruhe

<text>Goring and Streatley Bridge is a road bridge across the River Thames in England. The bridge links the twin villages of Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, and Streatley, Berkshire, and is adjacent to Goring Lock.

The present bridge was built in 1923, and is in two parts: The western bridge is from Streatley to an island in the river (overlooking &quot;The Swan&quot; hotel, once owned by Danny La Rue); The eastern bridge is from the island to Goring and overlooks Goring Lock. The bridge consists of timber struts supporting a metal roadway.

Both the Thames Path and The Ridgeway cross the Thames on this bridge.

A bridge was first built here in 1837 being a flat timber bridge of beams on posts. Prior to this there was a ferry although occasionally people would ride across, even driving in a one-horse chaise. In 1674 the ferry turned over in the weir pool with the loss of sixty lives. In the 1970s a Citroën Dyane crashed through the railings at the Streatley end of the bridge landing on a concrete weir 16 feet below. The local Citroën dealer used the photo to illustrate the inherent strength of their upmarket 2CV.

It portrays Ida and his interactions with various people after his absence from the force due to an eye disease while hearing of mysterious deaths of villagers living in the fictional Amakura Island in Japan&#x27;s Ishikawa Prefecture in the year 2008 while assisting a police detective in initially trying to figure out who or what was responsible for their deaths after it was reported back in 2007.

==Plot==
===&quot;Jiraishin: Ice Blade&quot;===
Kyoya Ida is a hard-nosed detective from the Shinjuku Police precinct, known to use lethal force to solve cases whenever they need to be solved. He works in a bleak, gritty representation of Shinjuku alongside his partner Tsuyoshi Yamaki in hunting down suspects and arresting them before he was killed in the line of duty. Ida was later assigned to another partner named Eriko Aizawa, the two working together to solve cases pertaining to the city&#x27;s interests.

===&quot;Jirashin Diablo&quot;===
In the year 2008, Ida was beginning to suffer from the effects of Keratoconus after leaving the police force. He later gets wind of mysterious deaths of an unknown plague that killed the villagers in Ishikawa Prefecture&#x27;s Amakura Island when he meets up with Taichi Kogure, a detective of the Ishikawa Police precinct and a now grown up Aya Koike, who is a known information handler in the underworld.

==Publication==

Written and illustrated by Tsutomu Takahashi, &quot;Ice Blade&quot; was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Monthly Afternoon&quot; from the 1992 to 1999 (November 1992–January 2000 issues). Kodansha collected its chapters in nineteen &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, released from October 23, 1993, to January 21, 2000. The series was republished in a ten-volume &quot;bunkoban&quot; edition in 2003, and in a ten-volume &quot;aizoban&quot; edition in 2009. to November 20, 2009.

The North American version of the manga, retitled &quot;Ice Blade&quot;, was serialized in Tokyopop&#x27;s &quot;MixxZine&quot;, but it was discontinued after three volumes. When &quot;Jiraishin&quot; was serialized as &quot;Ice Blade&quot; in &quot;MixxZine&quot;, there were instances of censorships in some of its panels as it was a new magazine when it was released and did not wish to offend potential distributors.

It was licensed in France by Génération Comics; in Italy by Stars Comics; in Germany by Carlsen Comics; in South Korea by Samyang Comics; and in Taiwan by Tong Li Comics.

&quot;Jiraishin Diablo&quot; was serialized in Kodansha&#x27;s &quot;Good! Afternoon&quot; magazine from November 7, 2008, to November 7, 2011. Kodansha collected its chapters in three &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes, released from February 5, 2010, to December 7, 2011.

==Reception==
Serdar Yegulalp of Advanced Media Network compares &quot;Jiraishin&quot; to &quot;Miami Vice&quot; as the &quot;blood, grit, and sin spatter so thickly that it&#x27;s a miracle you don&#x27;t get your fingers dirty when you turn the pages&quot;.

It was nominated for the 23rd Kodansha Manga Awards in the general category in 1999.

<text>Eleftheria Arvanitaki (Greek: Ελευθερία Αρβανιτάκη) (born 17 October 1957 in Piraeus) is a Greek folk singer. She originates from the island of Icaria. Arvanitaki has worked with musicians such as Cesária Évora, Arto Tunçboyacıyan and Ara Dinkjian. On 14 March 2010 Alpha TV ranked her the sixth top-certified female artist in the nation&#x27;s phonographic era (since 1960).

==Career==
Arvanitaki started her singing career in 1980, by joining the group Opisthodromiki Kompania (&quot;Οπισθοδρομική Κομπανία&quot;, &quot;Retrograde Company&quot;) and in 1981 she had her first guest appearance on a CD, by being featured in the album of Vangelis Germanos titled &quot;Ta Barakia&quot;. She broke away from the group and started a solo career in 1984 with her album &quot;Eleftheria Arvanitaki&quot;.

In August 2004, she participated in the closing ceremony of the Athens Olympics.

She has performed in several WOMAD and other festivals. In 2006 she took part in the Christmas concert &quot;Frostroses&quot; in Reykjavik, Iceland as a part of a group of singers named &quot;European Divas&quot;. The other &quot;divas&quot; were Sissel Kyrkjebø (Norway), Eivør Pálsdóttir (Faroe Islands), Petula Clark (UK), Ragga Gisla (Iceland) and Patricia Bardon (Ireland).

Thanks to her contract with Universal Music Group&#x27;s jazz label Verve Records, her music has enjoyed international release and exposure to some extent. Verve has subsequently assigned her to the EmArcy label, Universal&#x27;s European jazz arm, whose focus includes developing local European talent to an international calibre. Her recordings are all generally produced under her native signing with Universal Music Greece.

She is a cousin of award-winning Greek Australian filmmaker Anthony Maras.

<text>Johann Elias Schlegel (January 17, 1719 – August 13, 1749) was a German critic and dramatic poet.

==Life==
Schlegel was born in Meissen. He was educated at Schulpforta and at the University of Leipzig, where he studied law. In 1743 he became private secretary to his relative, von Spener, the Saxon ambassador at the Danish court. In 1748 he was made professor extraordinary at the academy of Sorø, where he died on August 13, 1749.

==Works==
Schlegel was a contributor to the &quot;Bremer Beiträge&quot; and for some time, while he was living in Denmark, edited a weekly periodical, &quot;Der Fremde&quot;. With his dramas as well as with his critical writings he did much to prepare the way for Lessing, by whom his genius was warmly appreciated. He wrote two lively and well-constructed comedies, &quot;Der Triumph der guten Frauen&quot; and &quot;Die stumme Schönheit&quot;, the former in prose, the latter in alexandrines. &quot;Hermann&quot; and &quot;Canut&quot; (both in alexandrines) are generally considered his best tragedies.

His works were edited (in 5 vols., 1761–1770) by his brother, J. H. Schlegel (1724–1780), who had a considerable reputation as a writer on Danish history. Another brother, Johann Adolf Schlegel, an eminent preacher, and author of some volumes of verse, was the father of August Wilhelm and Friedrich von Schlegel.

==Bibliography==
J. E. Schlegel&#x27;s &quot;Asthetische und dramaturgische Schriften&quot; have been edited by J. von Antoniewicz (1887), and a selection of his plays by F. Muncker in &quot;Bremer Beiträge&quot;, vol. ii. (Kürschner&#x27;s &quot;Deutsche Nalionalliteratur&quot;, vol. xliv., 1899). See, besides the biography by his brother in the edition of his works, E. Wolff, &quot;Johann Elias Schlegel&quot; (1889); and J. Rentsch, &quot;Johann Elias Schlegel als Trauerspieldichter&quot; (1890).

<doc id="1269117" wikidata="Q7531731" url="?curid=1269117" title="Site-directed spin labeling">
<text>Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) is a technique for investigating the structure and local dynamics of proteins using electron spin resonance. The theory of SDSL is based on the specific reaction of spin labels with amino acids. A spin label&#x27;s built-in protein structure can be detected by EPR spectroscopy. SDSL is also a useful tool in examinations of the protein folding process.

==Spin labeling==
Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) was pioneered in the laboratory of Dr. W.L. Hubbell. In SDSL, sites for attachment of spin labels are introduced into recombinantly expressed proteins by site-directed mutagenesis. Functional groups contained within the spin label determine their specificity. At neutral pH, protein thiol groups specifically react with the functional groups methanethiosulfonate, maleimide, and iodoacetamide, creating a covalent bond with the amino acid Cys. 
Spin labels are a unique molecular reporter, in that they are paramagnetic (contain an unpaired electron). Spin labels were first synthesized in the laboratory of H. M. McConnell in 1965. Since then, a variety of nitroxide spin labels have enjoyed widespread use for the study of macromolecular structure and dynamics because of their stability and simple EPR signal. 
The nitroxyl radical (N-O) is usually incorporated into a heterocyclic ring (e.g. pyrrolidine), and the unpaired electron is predominantly localized to the N-O bond. Once incorporated into the protein, a spin label&#x27;s motions are dictated by its local environment. Because spin labels are exquisitely sensitive to motion, this has profound effects on its EPR spectrum.

The assembly of multi-subunit membrane protein complexes has also been studied using spin labeling. The binding of the PsaC subunit to the PsaA and PsaB subunits of the photosynthetic reaction center, Photosystem I, has been analyzed in great detail using this technique.

Dr. Ralf Langen&#x27;s group showed that SDSL with EPR (University of Southern California, Los Angeles) can be used to understand the structure of amyloid fibrils and the structure of membrane bound Parkinson&#x27;s disease protein alpha-synuclein. A 2012 study generated a high resolution structure of IAPP fibrils using a combination of SDSL, pulse EPR and computational biology.

<text>Peter Spencer Bowness, Baron Bowness, (born 19 May 1943) is a British politician, solicitor, and life peer. Since 1996, he has been a member of the House of Lords.

==Early life==
Bowness was born on 19 May 1943. He was educated at Whitgift School, an all-boys private school in South Croydon, London. He graduated from the University of Law, and began work as a solicitor in 1966.

==Legal career==
Bowness is a qualified solicitor and notary public. From 1970 to 2002, he was a partner at Weightman Sadler Solicitors in Purley, London Borough of Croydon. From 2002 to 2011, he was a consultant to Streeter Marshall Solicitors (the successor to the now merged Weightman Sadler Solicitors). Since then, he has not practised as a solicitor or notary public.

==Political career==
===Councillor===
Bowness became a councillor and soon rose within Conservative Party ranks, becoming Leader of Croydon Council, London&#x27;s largest borough. During the 1980s, Bowness was said to have been one of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s favourite Council leaders, and took part in the abolition of the GLC. He was unusual amongst his Conservative colleagues, however, for supporting Ken Livingstone&#x27;s low-cost public transport initiative, &quot;Fares Fair&quot;.

He continued as Leader until 1994 when the Labour Party won the local elections. He stepped down from the Council in 1998. He served as a member of the Committee of the Regions and the Audit Commission.

===House of Lords===
On 17 January 1996, Bowness was created a life peer as Baron Bowness, of Warlingham in the County of Surrey and of Croydon in the London Borough of Croydon. From December 2002 to November 2006, he was member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. From December 2003 to May 2014, he served on the European Union Committee. He chaired the Foreign Policy Defence and Developmental Aid Sub-Committee of the EU Select Committee from 2003 to 2006, and chaired the Justice, Institutions and Consumer Protection Sub-Committee from 2009 to 2013. Having originally sat as a Conservative, Lord Bowness left the party to become a non-affiliated peer on 23 November 2020, before becoming a crossbencher on 1 December 2021.

===OSCE===

Lord Bowness has been a member of the British delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) since 2007. He was elected a Vice President of the Parliamentary Assembly in 2015 and re-elected in 2018, serving until 2020. In December of that year, Bowness—as the most senior Vice President—acceded to the presidency following the departure of Gigi Tsereteli, and served as President of the Parliamentary Assembly until July 2021.

==Personal life==
He is a patron of the Warehouse Theatre and was formerly a Governor of the Whitgift Foundation.

==Honours==
On 14 June 1981, Bowness was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant (DL) to the Lord Lieutenant of Greater London. In the 1981 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in recognition of his service as Chairman of the London Boroughs Association.

In the 1987 New Year Honours, it was announced that he was to be made a Knight Bachelor &quot;for political and public service&quot;. On 11 February 1987, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

In 1987, Bowness was made Freeman of the City of London. In 2002, he was made an Honorary Freeman of the London Borough of Croydon.

On 1 May 1988, Bowness was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 151 (Greater London) Transport Regiment, Royal Corps of Transport (Volunteers), Territorial Army. On 5 April 1993, he stood down from the appointment and was granted permission to retain his honorary rank.

<doc id="1269128" wikidata="Q2386976" url="?curid=1269128" title="Wojsko kwarciane">
<text>Wojsko kwarciane (, &quot;quarter army&quot;, Latin: &quot;quartanus&quot; or &quot;quartianus miles&quot;) was the term used for regular army units of Poland (Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). The term was used since 1562.

&quot;Wojsko kwarciane&quot; was formed from earlier &quot;obrona potoczna&quot; units.

The term &quot;quarter&quot; in the name of the army () comes from the type of the tax paid for their upkeep (&quot;kwarta&quot; tax): a quarter of income from the crown lands (&quot;królewszczyzny&quot;) was supposed to be used for that purpose. As monarchs usually leased their land to &quot;szlachta&quot; (or merchants, or Jews) for short-term benefits, they didn&#x27;t have direct control over cash flow and this often resulted in corruption and delayed payment of military wages. Military commanders (hetmans) often had to pay the wages of &quot;wojsko kwarciane&quot; and hired mercenaries from their own purse. Sometimes disgruntled unpaid units formed confederations (see konfederacja) in order to lawfully collect their wages by force.

The standing numbers of &quot;wojsko kwarciane&quot; varied by peacetime and wartime. On average during peacetime the army totalled about 2500 cavalry.

It was a relatively small standing army when compared with other contemporary countries, especially considering the Commonwealth&#x27;s huge area. Commonwealth armies would almost always be stretched thin to defend its territory from its aggressive neighbours of (Sweden, Russia, the Ottoman Empire and its vassals).

In 1632 new quarter or royal taxes (&quot;dupla&quot;) was created to pay for artillery units.

In 1652 &quot;wojsko kwarciane&quot; was replaced with wojsko komputowe.

<text>Ernst Friedrich, Freiherr von Schlotheim (2 April 176428 March 1832), German palaeontologist and politician, was born in Allmenshausen, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.

He was Privy Councillor and President of the Chamber at the court of Gotha. Becoming interested in geology he gathered a very extensive collection of fossils. In 1804 he published descriptions and illustrations of remarkable remains of (Carboniferous) plants, &quot;Ein Beitrag zur Flora der Vorwelt&quot;.

His more important work was entitled &quot;Die Petrefactenkunde&quot; (1820). In this he incorporated the plates used in his previous memoir and supplemented it by a folio atlas (1822), in which he illustrated his collection of petrified and fossil remains of the animal and vegetable kingdom of a former world. For the first time in Germany the fossils were named according to the binomial system of Linnaeus. His specimens are preserved in the Berlin Museum. He died at Gotha.

<doc id="1269138" wikidata="Q1138659" url="?curid=1269138" title="Street Fighter (1994 film)">
<text>Street Fighter is a 1994 action film written and directed by Steven E. de Souza, based on the video game series of the same name developed and published by Capcom. It was one of two films released in 1994 specifically adapting &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, following &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;. Distributed by Universal Pictures in the United States and Columbia TriStar Film Distributors International internationally, the film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme and Raul Julia (in his final theatrical film role) along with supporting performances by Byron Mann, Damian Chapa, Kylie Minogue, Ming-Na Wen and Wes Studi. The adaptation focuses on the efforts by Colonel Guile (Van Damme) to bring down General M. Bison (Julia), the military dictator and drug kingpin of Shadaloo City who aspires to conquer the world with an army of genetic supersoldiers, while enlisting the aid of street fighters Ryu (Mann) and Ken (Chapa) to infiltrate Bison&#x27;s empire and help destroy it from within.

The film was commercially successful, with a worldwide box office gross approximately three times its production costs. Home video releases and television broadcasts were also profitable. While it earned Capcom a return of () from the box office and home media, it was poorly received by critics and fans for its campy tone, unfaithfulness to the source material, and overblown effects. However, Julia&#x27;s performance as M. Bison was singled out for widespread critical acclaim and garnered him a posthumous nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Saturn Awards. The film was Julia&#x27;s final theatrical performance, as he died of a stroke two months before the film&#x27;s release; the film is dedicated to his memory.

==Plot==
In the Southeast Asian nation of Shadaloo, civil war occurs between the forces of drug lord-turned-General M. Bison and the Allied Nations led by Colonel William F. Guile. Bison captures 63 A.N. relief workers, and via a live broadcast, demands Guile secure a US$20 billion ransom in three days. Guile refuses and vows to track Bison down and place him on trial for his crimes. His assistant, Lieutenant Cammy White, is only partially able to pinpoint Bison&#x27;s location to the river-delta region outside the city. One hostage is Guile&#x27;s friend Sergeant Carlos &quot;Charlie&quot; Blanka, who Bison orders taken to his lab for his captive scientist, Dr. Dhalsim, to turn into the first of his supersoldiers. Though Charlie is severely disfigured gradually by the procedure, Dhalsim secretly alters his cerebral programming to maintain Charlie&#x27;s humanity.

American con artists and martial artists Ryu Hoshi and Ken Masters attempt to swindle arms dealer Viktor Sagat by selling him fake weaponry. Sagat sees through the ruse and has Ryu fight his cage champion, Vega. However, Guile bursts in and arrests everyone present for violating a curfew. On the prison grounds, he witnesses Ryu and Ken fighting Sagat&#x27;s men and recruits them to help him find Bison in exchange for their freedom since Sagat is Bison&#x27;s arms supplier. They are given a homing device and win Sagat&#x27;s trust by staging a prison escape and faking Guile&#x27;s death. News reporter Chun-Li Zhang, whose father was killed by Bison 20 years earlier, and her crew, former sumo wrestler Edmond Honda and boxer Balrog, who are out for revenge against Sagat for ruining their careers, stumble across the plan. Over Guile&#x27;s objections, they attempt to assassinate Bison and Sagat at a party. To maintain the warlords&#x27; trust, Ryu and Ken stop the assassination, revealing the conspirators to Bison.

Returning to his base, Bison inducts Ryu and Ken into his organization and orders Honda and Balrog imprisoned and Chun-Li taken to his quarters. Ryu and Ken break Balrog and Honda out of confinement and rush to confront Bison, who is fighting Chun-Li. Bison escapes and releases sleeping gas, sedating them all. Guile plans his assault on Bison&#x27;s base. He is impeded by the A.N., who decide to pay Bison the ransom. Nevertheless, Guile and his loyal troops proceed with the mission. At the base, Dhalsim is found out by a security guard; during the ensuing fight, Charlie is released, and he kills the guard to protect Dhalsim. Guile arrives, sneaks into the lab, and encounters Charlie. Guile prepares to shoot Charlie to end his suffering, but Dhalsim stops him. Bison prepares to kill the hostages by unleashing Charlie on them, but Guile emerges and engages Bison&#x27;s guards until the remaining A.N. forces arrive. After Bison makes it clear that he will not surrender peacefully, Guile orders his allies to rescue the hostages and engages Bison in a personal duel. As Guile and Bison fight, Ryu and Ken defeat Sagat and Vega. Bison&#x27;s computer expert Dee Jay flees through a secret passage, joined by Sagat. Bison&#x27;s bodyguard, Zangief, engages Honda in a fight until learning from Dee Jay that Bison was the true enemy of freedom and peace, and sides with Ryu and Ken to save the hostages.

Guile gains the upper hand against Bison and kicks him into a bank of hard drives, electrocuting him. A revival system restores Bison, who reveals that his suit has advanced automatic first-aid mechanisms and electrical weaponry, including superconducting boots that enable him to fly. These gadgets allow Bison to gain the upper hand and beat Guile. As he moves to deal the death blow, Guile counters by kicking Bison into his monitor wall which explodes, apparently killing him and overloading the base&#x27;s energy storage system. The hostages are rescued, but Guile stays behind to convince Dhalsim and Charlie to return with him. They refuse, with Dhalsim wishing to atone for his responsibilities in mutating Charlie. Guile flees the exploding base and reunites with his comrades.

In a post-credits scene, Bison is restored once again when solar power reactivates his base&#x27;s system, and his fist emerges through the rubble.

==Cast==

===Street Fighters===
===Shadaloo Warriors===
===Non-canonical characters===
==Production==
The film&#x27;s production budget was (), with Capcom alone financing most of the budget. Because Capcom was co-financier of the film, every aspect of the production required their approval. Among other points, they mandated a December 1994 release date, which required the cast and crew to maintain an aggressive filming schedule. De Souza says he wrote the initial draft of the script overnight, being made aware that Capcom executives were in Los Angeles on short notice and because he himself was a fan of the game.

Capcom had long envisioned Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile and asked him to be cast. Raul Julia said that he accepted the role of Bison because his children are huge fans of the video game series. After Van Damme and Julia were cast as Guile and Bison, most of the casting budget had been spent. Van Damme&#x27;s fee alone took nearly $8 million of the film&#x27;s $35-million budget. This meant that the majority of other parts had to go to little-known or unknown actors, such as Byron Mann, Damian Chapa, Peter Navy Tuiasosopo and Grand L. Bush. Kylie Minogue was cast as Cammy as a result of the Australian Actors&#x27; Guild wanting De Souza to hire an Australian actor. By the time he received the request, Cammy was the only part not yet cast. De Souza first learned of Minogue from her cover photo on a &quot;World&#x27;s 30 Most Beautiful People&quot; edition of &quot;Who&quot; magazine. Japanese actor Kenya Sawada appeared in the film as a part of a promotional contract with Capcom. Capcom originally wanted Sawada to play the role of Ryu, but De Souza remained resolute and stuck with Mann for the role.

The cast&#x27;s physical training was handled by Hollywood trainer and world karate champion Benny Urquidez, who also appears in the film as one of Sagat&#x27;s henchmen. Charlie Picerni was hired as the stunt coordinator; he took the job with the condition that he would need ample time to train the cast. De Souza agreed; however, plans were switched once it was learned that Raul Julia was suffering from cancer. Initially plans were to shoot Julia&#x27;s less intensive scenes first while the rest of the cast would train with Picerni; however, upon seeing Julia, de Souza realized that they could not show him in his current weakened state and was forced to switch the filming around. This led to an environment where the cast would be trained only right before their scenes—sometimes only hours ahead.

De Souza stated that he did not want to make a generic martial arts movie and described the film as a cross between &quot;Star Wars&quot;, James Bond and a war film. In addition, he indicated that he also did not want to shoehorn in elements from the games, citing the previous year&#x27;s poorly received &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; film as an example. De Souza said that he avoided the supernatural elements and powers from the games but would hint at their use for a sequel.

&quot;Street Fighter&quot; was filmed mostly in Queensland, Australia along the famous Gold Coast during the second and third quarters of 1994 with most of the interiors and exteriors filmed on soundstages in Brisbane. Some exterior scenes were filmed in Bangkok, Thailand which were used as the backdrop for the fictitious Shadaloo City. The Bangkok scenes were filmed first, in the second quarter of 1994, with filming in Australia beginning after three weeks in Bangkok. De Souza envisioned the attack on Bison&#x27;s hide-out to include helicopters but was unable to do so due to the political instability in neighbouring Myanmar, which is why the AN troops attack via boats instead. This was referenced in the film&#x27;s final script.

The MPAA gave the first submitted cut of the film an R classification. This was unacceptably high for Capcom, who had stated from the start that it should be a PG-13 film. After various cuts were made, according to de Souza, a G rating was given, which was bumped up to PG-13 with the addition of an expletive in post production.

The post-credits scene where Bison is revived was omitted from the theatrical release &quot;out of deference to Raul Julia&quot; but was retained in home video and DVD releases.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
A soundtrack was released on December 6, 1994 by Priority Records featuring mostly rap or hip hop, which predates the soundtrack of &quot;Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike&quot;. The soundtrack found mild success, peaking at #135 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #34 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. Upon its release on home video in the United Kingdom, the soundtrack was given away free with every purchase of the VHS tape at branches of Tesco for a limited period. Although this was the only way for anybody in the UK to purchase the CD, &quot;Straight to My Feet&quot; by M.C. Hammer was still released as a single, which charted #57 in the UK.

===Score===
Graeme Revell composed the film&#x27;s score, an hour of which was released by Varèse Sarabande. Revell ignored previously existing music from the franchise. The music differs from Revell&#x27;s more popular style, most notably with the absence of pervasive electronic elements and is entirely orchestral as the score is performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The campy style of the film is reflected in the score&#x27;s parody cues. The music during the scene where Ryu faces Vega in the cage fight quotes Georges Bizet&#x27;s Habanera from the opera Carmen, and a theme heard throughout the score, particularly in the track &quot;Colonel Guile Addresses the Troops&quot;, is reminiscent of Bruce Broughton&#x27;s main theme for &quot;Tombstone&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Street Fighter&quot; had opened in New York and Los Angeles on December 23, 1994.

===Box office===
The film earned $3,124,775 on its opening day. It grossed $9,508,030 on its opening weekend, ranking at #3 behind &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; and &quot;The Santa Clause&quot; at the box office. On its second weekend it grossed $7,178,360 and dropped down to #7. The film grossed $33,423,521 at the domestic box office and $66,000,000 at the international box office, making a total of $99,423,521 worldwide.

According to the 2024 shareholder’s meeting at Capcom, the movie is still making tens of millions of yen each year.

===Home media===
The film was released on the VHS format in 1995, initially for video rental stores. In the United States, the film sold more than 250,000 rental tapes in 1995. The film was also broadcast on cable television, and later released on DVD, Blu-ray, and digital streaming. The film&#x27;s home video releases and television broadcasts have been profitable for Capcom, which earned a return of () from the film&#x27;s box office and home media revenue.

==Reception==
===Critical response===

Leonard Maltin gave the film his lowest rating, writing that &quot;even Jean-Claude Van Damme fans couldn&#x27;t rationalize this bomb.&quot; Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the film was &quot;notable only for being the last film made by Raúl Juliá, an actor far too skilled for the demands of the evil warlord, Gen. M. Bison, but far too professional to give anything less than his best.&quot; Critic Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to the film as &quot;a dreary, overstuffed hodgepodge of poorly edited martial arts sequences and often unintelligible dialogue.&quot; Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Emanuel Levy stated that the film &quot;suffers from the same problems that impaired &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;: It&#x27;s noisy, overblown and effects-laden and lacks sustained action or engaging characters.&quot; Levy commented on Julia, referring to it as &quot;his weakest performances, accentuating each and every syllable as if he were reciting a Shakespearean role of grand emotional range. It&#x27;s too bad, for this is the accomplished actor&#x27;s last film, and it is dedicated to him.&quot;

Leslie Felperin of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; described Kylie Minogue as Cammy &quot;hilarious miscasting as a military wench with Heidi plaits. The merest glimpse of her holding a bazooka and looking mean is enough to induce giggles in the most dour of viewers.&quot; David Hunter of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said the film is &quot;neither a satisfying martial arts exercise for star Jean-Claude Van Damme nor the irresistible mainstream diversion it strives for.&quot;

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, of reviews&#x27; critics were positive, with an average rating of 3.40/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Though it offers mild entertainment through campy one-liners and the overacting of the late Raul Julia, &quot;Street Fighter&quot;″s nonstop action sequences are not enough to make up for a predictable, uneven storyline.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average, gave it a score of 34 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

===Awards===

In 2009, &quot;Time&quot; listed the film on their list of top ten worst video games movies. GameTrailers ranked the film as the eighth worst video game film of all time.
The film also received two nominations at the Saturn Awards: Best Science Fiction Film and Best Supporting Actor (a posthumous nomination for Raul Julia).

==Other media==
===Merchandise===
A one-shot comic book adaptation of the film, titled &quot;Street Fighter: The Battle for Shadaloo&quot;, was published by DC Comics in 1995. The comic was drawn by Nick J. Napolitano and written by Mike McAvennie. A Japanese one-shot manga adaptation by Takayuki Sakai was also published in the June 1995 issue of &quot;CoroCoro Comics Special&quot;.

Two video games based on the film were produced. The first was a coin-operated arcade game titled &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot;, produced by American developer Incredible Technologies and distributed by Capcom. The second was a home video game developed by Capcom also titled &quot;Street Fighter: The Movie&quot;, released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Despite sharing the same title, neither game is a port of the other, although they both used the same digitized footage of the film″s cast posing as the characters in each game. Capcom also announced that an &quot;enhanced port&quot; was being created for the Sega 32X by their newly formed USA research and development department. This version was never released.

==Cancelled sequel and reboots==
By 2003, plans were being made for a sequel, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;. Rumored cast members included Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren and Holly Valance. The project never materialized.

Many plot elements of the film, such as Blanka/Charlie&#x27;s identity, Chun Li&#x27;s role as a journalist reporter, Ryu &amp; Ken&#x27;s roles as con-artists, Dhalsim&#x27;s role as a scientist, Zangief&#x27;s role as Bison&#x27;s muscle and Sagat&#x27;s role as a crime boss were reused in the American-produced 1995 &quot;Street Fighter&quot; animated series, which combined story aspects of the film with those in the games such as &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; and &quot;Final Fight&quot;. Both Dan Hibiki and Gen were the only street fighters to be cut out of the show.

In 2009, 20th Century Fox released &quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li&quot;, to worse reception than the original.

In 2014, &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot; was released in both television series and movie format to YouTube, focusing on Ryu and Ken&#x27;s training under Gouken, as well as Gouken&#x27;s troubled relationship with his brother, Akuma, over the Dark Hadou. The series was met with widespread acclaim.

On April 3, 2023, it was reported that Legendary Entertainment had acquired the film rights to the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; games and had begun work on a new live-action film with talks of Alan Ritchson on-board to portray Guile. The film is scheduled to release on March 20, 2026 by Sony Pictures Releasing.

<text>There exist a number of perspectives on the relationship of Islam and democracy among Islamic political theorists, the general Muslim public, and Western authors.

Many Muslim scholars have argued that traditional Islamic notions such as &quot;shura&quot; (consultation), &quot;maslaha&quot; (public interest), and &quot;ʿadl&quot; (justice) justify representative government institutions which are similar to Western democracy, but reflect Islamic rather than Western liberal values. Still others have advanced liberal democratic models of Islamic politics based on pluralism and freedom of thought. Some Muslim thinkers have advocated secularist views of Islam.

A number of different attitudes regarding democracy are also represented among the general Muslim public, with polls indicating that majorities in the Muslim world desire a religious democracy where democratic institutions and values can coexist with the values and principles of Islam, seeing no contradiction between the two.

==Traditional political concepts==
===Quran===
Muslim democrats, including Ahmad Moussalli (professor of political science at the American University of Beirut), argue that concepts in the Quran point towards some form of democracy, or at least away from despotism. These concepts include &quot;shura&quot; (consultation), &quot;ijma&quot; (consensus), &quot;al-hurriyya&quot; (freedom), &quot;al-huqquq al-shar&#x27;iyya&quot; (legitimate rights). For example, &quot;shura&quot; (Al Imran – Quran 3:159, Ash-Shura – Quran 42:38) may include electing leaders to represent and govern on the community&#x27;s behalf. Government by the people is not therefore necessarily incompatible with the rule of Islam, whilst it has also been argued that rule by a religious authority is not the same as rule by a representative of God. This viewpoint, however, is disputed by more traditional Muslims. Moussalli argues that despotic Islamic governments have abused the Quranic concepts for their own ends: &quot;For instance, shura, a doctrine that demands the participation of society in running the affairs of its government, became in reality a doctrine that was manipulated by political and religious elites to secure their economic, social and political interests at the expense of other segments of society,&quot; (In &quot;Progressive Muslims&quot; 2003).

===Sunni Islam===
Deliberations of the Caliphates, most notably the Rashidun Caliphate, were not democratic in the modern sense rather, decision-making power lay with a council of notable and trusted companions of Muhammad and representatives of different tribes (most of them selected or elected within their tribes).

In the early Islamic Caliphate, the head of state, the Caliph, had a position based on the notion of a successor to Muhammad&#x27;s political authority, who, according to Sunnis, was ideally elected by the people or their representatives, as was the case for the election of Abu Bakr, Umar ibn Al Khattab, Uthman, and Ali as Caliph. After the Rashidun Caliphs, later Caliphates during the Islamic Golden Age had a much lesser degree of collective participation, but since &quot;no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue&quot; in Islam, and following the example of Muhammad, later Islamic rulers often held public consultations with the people in their affairs.

The legislative power of the Caliph (or later, the Sultan) was always restricted by the scholarly class, the &quot;ulama&quot;, a group regarded as the guardians of Islamic law. Since the law came from the legal scholars, this prevented the Caliph from dictating legal results. Sharia rulings were established as authoritative based on the &quot;ijma&quot; (consensus) of legal scholars, who theoretically acted as representatives of the Ummah (Muslim community). After law colleges (&quot;madrasas&quot;) became widespread beginning with the 11th and 12th century CE, a student often had to obtain an &quot;ijaza-t al-tadris wa-l-ifta&quot; (&quot;license to teach and issue legal opinions&quot;) in order to issue legal rulings. In many ways, classical Islamic law functioned like a constitutional law.

Bangladeshi Islamic scholar Khandaker Abdullah Jahangir said in a scholarly interview about Islam and democracy that,
====Salafi view====
Salafism as an ideology and movement has close ties to Saudi Arabia. The Saudi monarchy from its beginning in the 18th century has partnered with Wahhabism as military tool and ideological support to their monarchical rule. The ruling monarchy uses their scholars (termed salafis, wahhabis, and Najdis) to defend their authoritarian rule and subjugate the masses. Because the Saudi monarchs perceive democracy and the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat to their rule, they have occasionally used extremist Salafi scholars (e.g. madkhalis) to oppose democracy at home and in other Arab states, and claim that democracy is haram and even shirk. For example, after the election of Mohamed Morsi, the Saudi authorities used their Salafi proxies in Egypt to counter the Muslim brotherhood, proclaim that democracy is shirk, and promoted terrorist attacks in the Sinai against the Egyptian military. The violence and destabilization caused by radical Salafi jihadist groups in the Sinai led to the ousting of Morsi and overthrow of democracy in Egypt. Thus, there are different opinions among Salafi scholars regarding democracy depending on the political climate in Saudi Arabia and freedom of expression. Over the decades, different Salafi groups around the world have changed and evolved, from initial quietism to fully embracing political engagement to promote their ideology.

Some Salafi scholars opine that democracy is haram and in Islam and allege that it overrules the Shari&#x27;a (e.g. by potentially permitting alcohol and riba if the people vote for it), but they legitimize the opportunity to use democracy to come to power and to vote to establish Islamic rule and encourage voting to choose the better between evils, among these scholars are Shaykh Abd al-Aziz bin Baz, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Uthaymeen, Abdullah al-Ghudayyan, Abdullah Quyud, Abdur Razzaq Afifi, Senior Scholars of Saudi Arabia: Grand Mufti Shaykh Abdul Aziz Ash-Shaikh, Shaykh Abdul Muhsin Al-Abbad, Shaykh Wasiullah Abbas and Saudi Arabia&#x27;s most senior fatwa panel of scholars, &quot;Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&quot;, all echoed similar calls to encourage Muslims to vote.

Khandaker Abdullah Jahangir in his book (&quot;Hadiser Namey Jaliyati&quot;) (Forgery in the Name of Hadith) says about the interpretation of Hadith of democratic Islamist parties about Islamic politics,
Conclusively, Salafi opinions on democracy can be categorized in the following ways, depending on the scholar and the context:
# That democracy is haram and perhaps even shirk if it is used to overrule fundamental tenants of the Shari&#x27;a, like making forbidden things permissible (i.e. making the haram legal), or if it is a threat to the rule of the Saudi monarchy.
# That participating in democracy outside of Saudi Arabia and the Arab world (e.g. in the West and India) is good (with a variety of opinions on the details) if the participant is voting for the lesser of two evils or for an Islam-promoting candidate.

===Shia Islam===
According to the Shia understanding, Muhammad named as his successor (as leader, with Muhammad being the final prophet), his son-in-law, and cousin Ali. Therefore, the first three of the four elected &quot;Rightly Guided&quot; Caliphs recognized by Sunnis (Ali being the fourth), are considered usurpers, notwithstanding their having been &quot;elected&quot; through some sort of conciliar deliberation (which the Shia do not accept as a representative of the Muslim society of that time). The largest Shia grouping—the Twelvers branch—recognizes a series of Twelve Imams, the last of which (Muhammad al-Mahdi, the Hidden Imam) is still alive and the Shia are waiting for his &quot;reappearance&quot;.

==Theoretical perspectives on democracy==

===Al-Farabi===
The early Islamic philosopher, Al-Farabi (c. 872–950), in one of his most notable works &quot;Al-Madina al-Fadila&quot;, theorized an ideal Islamic state which he compared to Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot;. Al-Farabi departed from the Platonic view in that he regarded the ideal state to be ruled by the prophet, instead of the philosopher king envisaged by Plato. Al-Farabi argued that the ideal state was the city-state of Medina when it was governed by Muhammad, as its head of state, as he was in direct communion with God whose law was revealed to him. In the absence of the prophet, Al-Farabi considered democracy as the closest to the ideal state, regarding the republican order of the Rashidun Caliphate as an example within early Muslim history. However, he also maintained that it was from democracy that imperfect states emerged, noting how the republican order of the early Islamic Caliphate of the Rashidun caliphs was later replaced by a form of government resembling a monarchy under the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties.

===Varieties of modern Islamic theories===
Muslih and Browers identify three major perspectives on democracy among prominent Muslims thinkers who have sought to develop modern, distinctly Islamic theories of socio-political organization conforming to Islamic values and law:
* The rejectionist Islamic view, elaborated by Sayyid Qutb and Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, condemns imitation of foreign ideas, drawing a distinction between Western democracy and the Islamic doctrine of &quot;shura&quot; (consultation between ruler and ruled). This perspective, which stresses comprehensive implementation of sharia, was widespread in the 1970s and 1980s among various movements seeking to establish an Islamic state, but its popularity has diminished in recent years.
* The moderate Islamic view stresses the concepts of &quot;maslaha&quot; (public interest), &quot;ʿadl&quot; (justice), and &quot;shura&quot; (consultation). Islamic leaders are considered to uphold justice if they promote public interest, as defined through &quot;shura&quot;. In this view, &quot;shura&quot; provides the basis for representative government institutions that are similar to Western democracy, but reflect Islamic rather than Western liberal values. Hasan al-Turabi, Rashid al-Ghannushi, and Yusuf al-Qaradawi have advocated different forms of this view.
* The liberal Islamic view is influenced by Muhammad Abduh&#x27;s emphasis on the role of reason in understanding religion. It stresses democratic principles based on pluralism and freedom of thought. Authors like Fahmi Huwaidi and Tariq al-Bishri have constructed Islamic justifications for full citizenship of non-Muslims in an Islamic state by drawing on early Islamic texts. Others, like Mohammed Arkoun and Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, have justified pluralism and freedom through non-literalist approaches to textual interpretation. Abdolkarim Soroush has argued for a &quot;religious democracy&quot; based on religious thought that is democratic, tolerant, and just. Islamic liberals argue for the necessity of constant reexamination of religious understanding, which can only be done in a democratic context.

===Secularist views===
In the modern history of the Muslim world, the notion of secularism has acquired strong negative connotations due to its association with foreign colonial domination and the removal of religious values from the public sphere. Traditional Islamic theory distinguishes between matters of religion (&quot;din&quot;) and state (&quot;dawla&quot;), but insists that political authority and public life must be guided by religious values. Some Islamic reformists like Ali Abdel Raziq and Mahmoud Mohammed Taha have advocated a secular state in the sense of political order that does not impose any single interpretation of sharia on the nation, though they did not advocate secularism in the sense of a morally neutral exercise of state power. The Islamic scholar Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na&#x27;im has argued for a secular state built on constitutionalism, human rights and full citizenship, seeking to demonstrate that his vision is more consistent with Islamic history than visions of an Islamic state. Proponents of Islamism (political Islam) reject secularist views that would limit Islam to a matter of personal belief and insist on implementation of Islamic principles in the legal and political spheres. Moreover, the concept of &#x27;Separation of Powers&#x27; was propounded by Ruhollah Khomeini.

===Muhammad Iqbal===
The modern Islamic philosopher, Muhammad Iqbal, viewed the early Islamic Caliphate as being compatible with democracy. He &quot;welcomed the formation of popularly elected legislative assemblies&quot; in the Muslim world as a &quot;return to the original purity of Islam.&quot; He argued that Islam had the &quot;gems of an economic and democratic organization of society&quot;, but that this growth was stunted by the monarchist rule of Umayyad Caliphate, which established the Caliphate as a great Islamic empire but led to political Islamic ideals being &quot;repaganized&quot; and the early Muslims losing sight of the &quot;most important potentialities of their faith.&quot;

===Muhammad Asad===
Another Muslim scholar and thinker, Muhammad Asad, viewed democracy as perfectly compatible with Islam. In his book &quot;The Principles of State and Government in Islam&quot;, he notes:
Viewed from this historical perspective, &#x27;democracy&#x27; as conceived in the modern West is infinitely nearer to the Islamic than to the ancient Greek concept of liberty; for Islam maintains that all human beings are socially equal and must, therefore, be given the same opportunities for development and self-expression. On the other hand, Islam makes it incumbent upon Muslims to subordinate their decisions to the guidance of the Divine Law revealed in the Qur&#x27;ãn and exemplified by the Prophet: an obligation which imposes definite limits on the community&#x27;s right to legislate and denies to the &#x27;will of the people&#x27; that attribute of sovereignty which forms so integral a part of the Western concept of democracy.

===Abul A&#x27;la Maududi===
Islamist writer and politician Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, conceived of an &quot;Islamic state&quot; that would eventually &quot;rule the earth&quot;. The antithesis of secular Western democracy, it would follow an all-embracing Sharia law. Maududi called the system he outlined a &quot;theo-democracy&quot;, which he argued would be different from a theocracy as the term is understood in the Christian West, because it would be run by the entire Muslim community (pious Muslims who followed sharia), rather than ruled by a clerical class in the name of God.

Maududi&#x27;s vision has been criticized (by Youssef M. Choueiri) as an
ideological state in which legislators do not legislate, citizens only vote to reaffirm the permanent applicability of God&#x27;s laws, women rarely venture outside their homes lest social discipline be disrupted, and non-Muslims are tolerated as foreign elements required to express their loyalty by means of paying a financial levy.

===L. Ali Khan===
Legal scholar L. Ali Khan argues that Islam is fully compatible with democracy. In his book, &quot;A Theory of Universal Democracy&quot;, Khan provides a critique of liberal democracy and secularism. He presents the concept of &quot;fusion state&quot; in which religion and state are fused. There are no contradictions in God&#x27;s universe, says Khan. Contradictions represent the limited knowledge that human beings have. According to the Quran and the Sunnah, Muslims are fully capable of preserving spirituality and self-rule.

===Javed Ahmed Ghamdi===
Religious scholar, Javed Ahmed Ghamdi interprets the Quranic verses as &quot;The collective affairs of Muslims are run on the basis of mutual consultations&quot; (42:37). He is of the view that all the matters of a Muslim state must be sought out through consultations.The parliamentary bodies would provide that platform to practice and implement those consultations.

==Views of the general Muslim public==
Esposito and DeLong-Bas distinguish four attitudes toward Islam and democracy prominent among Muslims today:
* Advocacy of democratic ideas, often accompanied by a belief that they are compatible with Islam, which can play a public role within a democratic system, as exemplified by many protestors who took part in the Arab Spring uprisings;
* Support for democratic procedures such as elections, combined with religious or moral objections toward some aspects of Western democracy seen as incompatible with sharia, as exemplified by Islamic scholars like Yusuf al-Qaradawi;
* Rejection of democracy as a Western import and advocacy of traditional Islamic institutions, such as shura (consultation) and ijma (consensus), as exemplified by supporters of absolute monarchy and radical Islamist movements;
* Belief that democracy requires restricting religion to private life, held by a minority in the Muslim world.

Polls conducted by Gallup and PEW in Muslim-majority countries indicate that most Muslims see no contradiction between democratic values and religious principles, desiring neither a theocracy, nor a secular democracy, but rather a political model where democratic institutions and values can coexist with the values and principles of Islam.

==Islam and democracy in practice==

===Obstacles===

There are several ideas on the relationship between Islam in the Middle East and democracy. Waltz writes that transformations brought by democratization seemed, on the whole, to pass by the Islamic Middle East at a time when such transformations were a central theme in other parts of the world. However, she does note that, of late, the increasing number of elections being held in the region indicates some form of adoption of democratic traditions.

Following the Arab Spring, professor Olivier Roy of the European University Institute, in an article in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, described political Islam as &quot;increasingly interdependent&quot; with democracy, such that &quot;neither can now survive without the other&quot;.

Orientalist scholars offer another viewpoint on the relationship between Islam and democratization in the Middle East. They argue that compatibility is simply nonexistent between secular democracy and Arab-Islamic culture in the Middle East, which has a strong history of undemocratic beliefs and authoritarian power structures. Elie Kedourie, a well-known Orientalist scholar, said, for example: &quot;to hold simultaneously ideas which are not easily reconcilable argues, then, a deep confusion in the Arab public mind, at least about the meaning of democracy. The confusion is, however, understandable since the idea of democracy is quite alien to the mind-set of Islam.&quot; A view similar to this that understands Islam and democracy to be incompatible because of seemingly irreconcilable differences between Sharia and democratic ideals is also held by some Islamists.

However, within Islam, there are ideals held by some who believe Islam and democracy in some form are indeed compatible due to the existence of the concept of &quot;shura&quot; (&quot;consultation&quot;) in the Quran. Various thinkers and political activists have expressed such views in the Middle East. They continue to be the subject of controversy—e.g., at the second Dubai Debates, which debated the question &quot;Can Arab and Islamic values be reconciled with democracy?&quot;

====Brian Whitaker&#x27;s &#x27;four major obstacles&#x27;====
Writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Brian Whitaker, the paper&#x27;s Middle East editor, argued that there were four major obstacles to democracy in the region: &quot;the imperial legacy&quot;, &quot;oil wealth&quot;, &quot;the Arab–Israeli conflict&quot;, and militant&#x27; Islam&quot;.

The imperial legacy includes the borders of modern states and significant minorities within them. Acknowledgment of these differences is frequently suppressed, usually for the cause of &quot;national unity&quot; and sometimes to obscure the fact that the minority elite is controlling the country. Whitaker argues that this leads to forming political parties based on ethnic, religious, or regional divisions rather than over policy differences. Voting, therefore, becomes an assertion of one&#x27;s identity rather than a real choice.

The problem with oil and the wealth it generates is that the states&#x27; rulers have the wealth to remain in power, as they can pay off or repress most potential opponents. Whitaker argues that as there is no need for taxation there is less pressure for representation. Furthermore, Western governments require a stable source of oil and are therefore more prone to maintain the status quo rather than push for reforms, which may lead to periods of instability. This can be linked to political economy explanations for the occurrence of authoritarian regimes and lack of democracy in the Middle East, particularly the prevalence of rentier states in the Middle East. A consequence of the lack of taxation that Whitaker talks of in such rentier economies is an inactive civil society. As civil society is considered an integral part of democracy, it raises doubts over the feasibility of democracy developing in the Middle East in such situations.

Whitaker&#x27;s third point is that the Arab-Israeli conflict serves as a unifying factor for the countries of the Arab League and also serves as an excuse for repression by Middle Eastern governments. For example, in March 2004, Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, Lebanon&#x27;s leading Shia cleric, is reported as saying, &quot;We have emergency laws, we have control by the security agencies, we have stagnation of opposition parties, we have the appropriation of political rights – all this in the name of the Arab-Israeli conflict.&quot; The West, especially the U.S., is also seen as a supporter of Israel, and so it and its institutions, including democracy, are seen by many Muslims as suspect. Khaled Abou El Fadl, a lecturer in Islamic law at the University of California, comments, &quot;modernity, despite its much scientific advancement, reached Muslims packaged in the ugliness of disempowerment and alienation.&quot;

This repression by secularist Arab rulers has led to the growth of radical Islamic movement groups, as they believe that the institution of an Islamic theocracy will lead to a more just society. However, these groups tend to be very intolerant of alternative views, including the ideas of democracy. Many Muslims who argue that Islam and democracy are compatible live in the West and are therefore seen as &quot;contaminated&quot; by non-Islamic ideas.

===Practice===

* The Green Algeria Alliance was an Islamist coalition of political parties created for the 2012 legislative elections in Algeria. It consisted of the Movement of Society for Peace, Islamic Renaissance Movement (Ennahda), and the Movement for National Reform (Islah). The alliance was led by Bouguerra Soltani of the Movement of Society for Peace. However, the incumbent coalition, consisting of the FLN of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and the RND of Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, held on to power after winning a majority of seats and the Islamist parties of the Green Algeria Alliance lost seats in legislative election of 2012.
* Shia Islamist Al Wefaq, Salafi Islamist Al Asalah, and Sunni Islamist Al-Menbar Islamic Society are dominant democratic forces in Bahrain.
* During the Bangladesh Liberation War, the Jamaat-e-Islami of Pakistan opposed the independence of Bangladesh. Still, it established itself as an independent political party, the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, after 1975. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party is the second largest party in the parliament of Bangladesh and the main opposition party. The BNP promotes a center-right philosophy combining elements of conservatism, Islamism, nationalism, and anti-communism. The party believes Islam is an integral part of the sociocultural life of Bangladesh. Since 2000, it has been allied with the Islamic parties Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and Islami Oikya Jote.
* The Party of Democratic Action is the largest political party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Party of Democratic Action was founded in May 1990 by reformist Islamist Alija Izetbegović, representing the conservative Bosniaks and other Slavic Muslim population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the former Yugoslavia.
* In the 2011–12 Egyptian parliamentary election, the political parties identified as &quot;Islamist&quot; and &quot;democratic&quot; (the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s Freedom and Justice Party, Salafist Al-Nour Party and liberal Islamist Al-Wasat Party) won 75% of the total seats. Mohamed Morsi, an Islamist democrat, was the first Islamist president of Egypt, stemming from the Muslim Brotherhood.
* Nahdlatul Ulama and Muhammadiyah are two influential Islamic social movements in Indonesia. United Development Party and the opposition Prosperous Justice Party are major Indonesian Islamist parties active in the country&#x27;s democratic process.
* The Islamic Action Front (IAF) is Jordan&#x27;s Islamist political party and the largest democratic political force in the country. The IAF&#x27;s survival in Jordan is primarily due to its flexibility and less radical approach to politics.
* The Islamic Group is a Sunni Islamist organization and Hezbollah is a Shia Islamist political party in Lebanon.
* The Justice and Construction Party is the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s political arm in Libya and the second largest political force in the country. National Forces Alliance, the largest political group in country, does not believe the government should be run entirely by Sharia law or secular law, but does hold that Sharia should be &quot;the main inspiration for legislation&quot;. Former leader Mahmoud Jibril has said the NFA is a moderate Islamic movement that recognises the importance of Islam in political life and favours Sharia as the basis of the law.
* The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) is the dominant party of Malaysia since that country&#x27;s independence in 1957. The UMNO sees and defines itself as a moderate Islamist, Islamic democratic, and social conservative party of Muslim Malays. The Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party is a major opposition party and is relatively more conservative and traditionalist than the UMNO.
* The Moroccan Justice and Development Party has been the ruling party in Morocco since November 29, 2011. The Justice and Development Party advocates Islamism and Islamic democracy.
* The Muslim Brotherhood of Syria is a Sunni Islamist force in Syria and loosely affiliated with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. It has also been called the &quot;dominant group&quot; or &quot;dominant force&quot; in the Arab Spring uprising in Syria. The group&#x27;s stated political positions are moderate. Its April 2012 manifesto &quot;pledges to respect individual rights&quot; and to pluralism and democracy.
* The Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan is Tajikistan&#x27;s Islamist party and main opposition and democratic force in that country.
* The Ennahda Movement, also known as Renaissance Party or simply Ennahda, is a moderate Islamist political party in Tunisia. On March 1, 2011, after the government of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali collapsed in the wake of the 2011 Tunisian revolution, Tunisia&#x27;s interim government granted the group permission to form a political party. Since then, it has become Tunisia&#x27;s biggest and most well-organized party, outdistancing its more secular competitors. In the Tunisian Constituent Assembly election, 2011, the first honest election in the country&#x27;s history with a turn out of 51.1% of all eligible voters, the party won 37.04% of the popular vote and 89 (41%) of the 217 assembly seats, far more than any other party.

====Pakistan====
Early in the history of the state of Pakistan (March 12, 1949), a parliamentary resolution (the Objectives Resolution) was adopted, stating the objectives on which the future constitution of the country was to be based. It contained the basic principles of both Islam and Western Democracy, in accordance with the vision of the founders of the Pakistan Movement (Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan). It proclaimed:

This resolution was included in the 1956 constitution as a preamble and, in 1985, it was inserted into the constitution itself as Article 2 and Schedule item 53 (but with the word &quot;freely&quot; in &quot;Provision shall be made for the religious minorities to freely profess and practice their religions and develop their cultures&quot;, removed). The resolution was inserted again in the constitution in 2010 with the word &quot;freely&quot; reinstated.

However, Islamisation has proceeded slowly in Pakistan, and Islamists, Islamic parties, and activists have expressed frustration that sharia law has not yet been fully implemented.

====Indonesia====
Officially, Indonesia does not have a state religion and is, in many respects, a secular democracy. The constitution of Indonesia gives its people the freedom of worship according to their religion or belief. This is based on the state ideology of &quot;Pancasila&quot; whose first tenet, &quot;Ketuhanan yang Maha Esa,&quot; translates as &quot;The One and Almighty God&quot;, implying that there is a supreme God that unites the nation. It does not specify any religion, though this is also sometimes mistranslated as an endorsement of monotheism. As a result, Indonesians have a religion column in their identity card; however, it is not mandatory (an empty column will indicate irreligion) and is used only for censuses (which are a Dutch colonial legacy). The 5th point of practice of the &quot;Butir-butir pengamalan Pancasila&quot; states: &quot;Religion and belief in God Almighty are private matters that concern the human relationship with God Almighty.&quot; Sukarno&#x27;s conception of Pancasila is not secular in the Western sense, but he agreed with Mahmud Esad Bay and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s view that Islam should be free of government control. In his speech entitled &quot;Islam Sontoloyo&quot; (&quot;Foolish Islam&quot;), he was critical of Islamic leaders&#x27; misuse of authority to justify wrong actions. According to Yudi Latief, Indonesia&#x27;s founding leaders, though thoroughly educated and motivated as secularists of the time, were unable to comprehend an Indonesian society without religion. Indonesian nationalist leaders characterized the country as a &quot;religiously neutral state&quot;, in which Islam would be separated from the state and that Islamic affairs should be managed by Muslims without the help of the state. A preliminary meeting based on Hatta&#x27;s initiative agreed that Islamic laws could be used for family laws that are passed by the People&#x27;s Representative Council, but only if they relate to Muslims, while the &#x27;secular&#x27; national criminal code could not to be changed because it applies to all regardless of religion. Sukarno also banned the most popular Islamic party, Masjumi, for alleged involvement in the PRRI rebellion. On 27 January 1953, Sukarno delivered a speech in Amuntai, South Kalimantan, a region with a strong Islamic community. There was a banner reading &quot;Indonesia a Nation State or an Islamic State?&quot; Commenting on the banner, Sukarno said: Sukarno also disagreed with Aceh adopting Islamic criminal laws as its form of sharia bylaws, stating that &quot;Indonesia is a nation state with the ideology of Pancasila, not a theocratic country with a certain religious orientation&quot; and &quot;Muslim&#x27;s habit of reading the Quran&quot; is also a form of obedience towards sharia. According to Sukarno, religion is a private matter between individuals and god, that could only be regulated through personal or family matters. During the Suharto era, Islamic parties were even more tightly controlled by the government, through the state formation of the United Development Party. Islamic veils were also banned. Nurcholis Majid, one of the prominent young Islamic thinkers at the time, in his speech &quot;The Need for Reform in Islamic Thinking and the Problem of Ummah Integration&quot;, considered Indonesian Muslims to be stuck in ideological dogmatism, and as a result had lost dynamism. He therefore coined the famous slogan: &quot;Islam Yes, Islamic Party No&quot;. Most of his colleagues considered this to be an endorsement of secularism. However, Abdurrahman Wahid, the fourth president of Indonesia, explained Indonesia&#x27;s case as &quot;mild secularism&quot;. Neither man considered themselves to be secularist and preferred to use &#x27;secularisation&#x27;, acknowledging the concern that secularism as an ideology could become a new closed world view functioning like a new religion.

However, in 1970, another political movement centered in students small groups of university students called &quot;liqo&quot; started. It was directly inspired by Hassan al-Banna&#x27;s Muslim Brotherhood, the proponent of which is Hilmi Aminuddin, which advocates for a gradual change to become more ideal Muslim. This coalesced in the formation of the Indonesian Muslim Students Action Union (KAMMI) in 1998, which alongside Abdurrahman Wahid&#x27;s Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Amien Rais&#x27; Muhammadiyah as student leaders formed the groups of student protests against Suharto&#x27;s government. After the fall of Suharto, KAMMI became the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), while NU and Muhammadiyah chose not to be involved in practical politics of winning elections and instead formed independent political parties aligned to, but independent of, their Islamic organizations, in the form of the National Awakening Party (PKB) and National Mandate Party (PAN). The democratic reforms led to calls for the adoption of Islamic sharia law in the form of the Jakarta Charter in national legislative body (MPR) in 2002. However, it was rejected, with even the PKB and PAN voting against it.

This was because the two largest Muslim organizations of Indonesia, NU and Muhammadiyah, very much accepted the &quot;Pancasila&quot; &#x27;secularism&#x27; basis of the country. NU and the party closest to it, PKB (Abdurrahman&#x27;s party), is member of Centrist Democrat International, which also contains the German CDU as well as the Hungarian Fidesz party. Indonesia has a party associated with the Muslim Brotherhood, the PKS, but even it has to commit to the state ideology, which means it is pluralist. Islamic groups that stray from and tried to change Pancasila such as HTI (Indonesian branch of Hizb ut-Tahrir) are banned even though they &#x27;participated&#x27; in a democracy.

In a practical sense, in central government levels, Indonesia has six recognized religions, as these are the recognized majority religions of most Indonesians and received state support.

In the Ministry of Religion Affairs, there are separate religious leader administrators for each of the six major religions. Sometimes the president or government members in a formal speech will greet audiences using in all six religious greetings. An example of this was in President Joko Widodo&#x27;s speech on March 26, 2021. In which he used all religious greetings including:
* &quot;Assalamu’alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh&quot; for Muslims
* &quot;Salam Sejahtera&quot; and &quot;Shaloom&quot; for Christians and Catholics
* &quot;Om Swastyastu&quot; for Hindus
* &quot;Namo Buddhaya&quot; for Buddhists
* &quot;Salam Kebajikan&quot; or &quot;Wei De Dong Tian&quot; (惟德動天) for Kong Hu Cu (Confucians)

Some Indonesian Muslims have long had problems with the implementation of sharia law, seeing it as not necessary and infringing on the non-Muslim population, while others see the implementation of some sharia-based laws as a solution to a failed and corrupt democratic process. In the 1960s, the &quot;Darul Islam&quot; rebellion tried to forcefully form an &quot;Islamic State of Indonesia&quot; although they were eventually defeated. Its regional offshoot based in Aceh advocated for independence, and continued an insurgency for a separate Islamic Aceh country. As a result of the Boxing Day tsunami in 2004 and negotiations facilitated by the Swedish government (Hasan di Tiro had a Swedish passport and lived there in exile) as well as the Finnish government, the Helsinki MoU was signed ending the conflict. Indonesia would allow Aceh to adopt its own version of law called Qanun, and Aceh would stop fighting for independence and adopt the special autonomy law.

====Iran====

=====Theory=====
Since the revolution in Iran, the largest Shia country, Twelver Shia political thought has been dominated by that of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder and leader of the revolution. Khomeini argued that in the absence of the Hidden Imam and other divinely-appointed figures (in whom ultimate political authority rests), Muslims have not only the right, but also the obligation to establish an &quot;Islamic state&quot;. To that end they must turn to scholars of Islamic law (fiqh) who are qualified to interpret the Quran and the writings of the imams.

Once in power and recognizing the need for more flexibility, Khomeini modified some earlier positions, insisted the ruling jurist need not be one of the most learned, that &quot;Sharia&quot; rule was subordinate to interests of Islam (Maslaha—&quot;expedient interests&quot; or &quot;public welfare&quot;), and the &quot;divine government&quot; as interpreted by the ruling jurists, who could overrule Sharia if necessary to serve those interests. The Islamic &quot;government, which is a branch of the absolute governance of the Prophet of God, is among the primary ordinances of Islam, and has precedence over all &#x27;secondary&#x27; ordinances.&quot;

The last point was made in December 1987, when Khomieni issued a fatwa in support of the Islamic government&#x27;s attempt to pass a labor protection bill not in accordance with sharia. He ruled that in the Islamic state, governmental ordinances were primary ordinances, and that the Islamic state has absolute right () to enact state commandments, taking precedence over &quot;all secondary ordinances such as prayer, fasting, and pilgrimage&quot;.

Were the powers of government to lie only within the framework of secondary divine decrees, the designation of the divine government and absolute deputed guardianship (&quot;wilayat-i mutlaqa-yi mufawwada&quot;) to the Prophet of Islam (peace be upon him and his progeny) would have been in practice entirely without meaning and content. ... I must point out, the government which is a branch of the absolute governance of the Prophet of God is among the primary ordinances of Islam, and has precedence over all secondary ordinances such as prayer (salat), fasting (sawm), and pilgrimage (hajj).

The idea and concept of Islamic democracy has been accepted by many Iranian clerics, scholars and intellectuals. The most notable of those who have accepted the theory of Islamic democracy is probably Iran&#x27;s Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who mentions Islamic democracy as &quot;Mardomsalarie Dini&quot; in his speeches. Nevertheless, Khamenei openly expresses his opposition to liberal democracy, having said, &quot;Islam naturally stands against liberal democracy.&quot;

There are also other Iranian scholars who oppose or at least criticise the concept of Islamic democracy. Among the most popular of them are Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi who have written: &quot;If not referring to the people votes would result in accusations of tyranny then it is allowed to accept people vote as a secondary commandment.&quot; Also Mohammad-Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi has more or less the same viewpoint.

=====Practice=====
Some Iranians, including Mohammad Khatami, categorize the Islamic Republic of Iran as a kind of religious democracy. They maintain that Ruhollah Khomeini held the same view as well and that&#x27;s why he strongly chose &quot;Jomhoorie Eslami&quot; (Islamic Republic) over &quot;Hokoomate Eslami&quot; (Islamic State).

Others maintain that not only is the Islamic Republic of Iran undemocratic (see Politics of Iran) but that Khomeini himself opposed the principle of democracy in his book &quot;Hokumat-e Islami: Wilayat al-Faqih&quot;, where he denied the need for any legislative body saying, &quot;no one has the right to legislate ... except ... the Divine Legislator&quot;, and during the Islamic Revolution, when he told Iranians, &quot;Do not use this term, &#x27;democratic.&#x27; That is the Western style.&quot; Although it is in contrast with his commandment to Mehdi Bazargan. It is a subject of lively debate among pro-Islamic Iranian intelligentsia. Also they maintain that Iran&#x27;s sharia courts, the Islamic Revolutionary Court, blasphemy laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Islamic religious police violate the principles of democratic governance. However, it should be understood that when a democracy is accepted to be Islamic by people, the law of Islam becomes the democratically ratified law of that country. Iranians have ratified the constitution in which the principle rules are explicitly mentioned as the rules of Islam to which other rules should conform. Khomeini fervently believed that principles of democracy can&#x27;t provide the targeted justice of Islam in the Sharia and Islamic thoughts.(Mohaghegh. Behnam 2014)
This contrast of view between the two Iranian head leaders of this Islamic country, as above mentioned about Khatami&#x27;s and Khomeini&#x27;s views have provisionally been being a case of disaffiliation of nearly half a country in most probable political coincidence, so the people cognizant of this heterogeneous political belief shall not be affiliated by newly formed views of democratic principles.(Mohaghegh, Behnam 2014)

A number of deviations from traditional sharia regulations have been noted in Iran

 ... the financial system has barely been Islamized; Christians, for example, are not subject to a poll tax and pay according to the common scheme. Insurance is maintained (even though chance, the very basis for insurance should theoretically be excluded from all contracts). The contracts signed with foreigners all accept the matter of interest.

==Indices of democracy in Muslim countries==
There are several non-governmental organizations that publish and maintain indices of democracy in the world, according to their own various definitions of the term, and rank countries as being free, partly free, or unfree using various measures of freedom, including political rights, economic rights, freedom of the press and civil liberties.

The following lists Muslim-majority countries and shows the scores given by two frequently used indices: 2022 Democracy Index (The Economist) and 2023 V-Dem Democracy indices for electoral democracy. These indices are frequently used in Western media, but have attracted some criticism and may not reflect recent changes.
:Key: ‡ – Disputed territory (according to Freedom House)

==Islamic democratic parties and organizations==
This is a list of parties which aim for the implementation of Sharia or an Islamic State, or subscribe to Muslim identity politics, or in some other way fulfil the definitions of political Islam, activist Islam, or Islamism laid out in this article; or have been widely described as such by others.

<doc id="1269169" wikidata="Q6260803" url="?curid=1269169" title="John Thwaites (Australian politician)">
<text>Johnstone William &quot;John&quot; Thwaites is an Australian former politician, and served as Deputy Premier of the state of Victoria from 1999 to 2007.

==Early life and education==
Thwaites was born in Oxford, England, and came to Australia as a child with his family. 

He was educated at Melbourne Grammar School and Monash University, Melbourne, where he graduated in science and law. He practised as a barrister before entering politics. He was a ministerial advisor to Labor Party state government ministers Jim Kennan and Andrew McCutcheon before being elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly for the seat of Albert Park.

==Political career==
=== Local council and mayor ===
Thwaites was elected to the South Melbourne City Council in 1985 and served until 1993, and was Mayor in 1991–92.

=== State Parliament ===
Thwaites entered Parliament at the 1992 election, as member for the inner city seat of Albert Park. Labor, having been in office for ten years, suffered a landslide defeat at the hands of the Liberal Party under Jeff Kennett. In the last three years of its term, Labor, under Joan Kirner, had presided over a sharp recession and a series of financial disasters including the forced sale of the State Bank of Victoria, and the collapse of Pyramid Building Society. Most commentators expected Labor to be in opposition for many years.

In the greatly reduced Labor Caucus, Thwaites gained rapid promotion. He became Shadow Minister for Health in January 1994, Shadow Minister for Health and Community Services in April 1996, and Deputy Leader of the Opposition in December 1996. Thwaites belonged to neither of the dominant factions of the Victorian Labor Party, the right-wing Labor Unity or the left-wing Socialist Left, and was an acceptable compromise candidate as Deputy to the then Opposition Leader, John Brumby.

Labor was again heavily defeated at the 1996 election, and it became apparent that the party could not recover under Brumby&#x27;s leadership. Thwaites had been a loyal deputy to Brumby, although in March 1999 he supported moves to have Brumby resign. Thwaites could not become leader himself because he had a small factional base, but instead supported Steve Bracks for the leadership.

As Shadow Minister for Health, Thwaites campaigned against the Kennett Government’s cuts to health and the privatisation of ambulance services. He used Freedom of Information documents to highlight long delays in hospital emergency departments and health budget cuts. (“Austin in patient crisis, says Labor”, The Age, 3 October 1996.) Thwaites also highlighted concerns about privatisation of ambulance dispatching to a private company, Intergraph, which the Auditor General found “at best involved serious mismanagement or, at worst, constituted corrupt activity”.  (“State backs Intergraph reports bid”, The Age, 3 September 1999). The Intergraph affair and concerns about hospital privatisation and ambulance services were major issues in the 1999 state election.

=== Deputy Leader ===

In September 1999 Bracks polled surprisingly well in the election, and three rural independent members gave Labor the opportunity to govern as a minority government. As Deputy Leader, Thwaites became Deputy Premier and was given the senior Health portfolio, with a mandate to increase funding to the public health system which had been the subject of cutbacks under the Liberal government. He was also Minister for Planning from 1999 to February 2002. Shortly after taking office, Thwaites cancelled the proposed privatisation of the Austin Hospital and announced plans for the government to rebuild the hospital with public funds. (“Labor to cancel Austin hospital privatisation” The Age 28 October 1999) (&quot;Can the new government fix health? The Age 20 November 1999&quot;). Like all state health ministers, he had only limited success in reducing waiting lists at public hospitals, but did succeed in restoring the numbers of nurses.

One of Thwaites first actions as Health Minister was to ban smoking in restaurants.  He later introduced legislation to ban smoking in gaming venues.

As Planning Minister, Thwaites put controls on high-rise development around Port Phillip Bay and introduced a residential planning code, Rescode, to preserve neighbourhood character in planning decisions. He also initiated &quot;Melbourne 2030&quot;, a 30-year strategy plan for Melbourne.

After the November 2002 state election, at which Labor was returned with a record majority, Thwaites was appointed Minister for Environment, Water and Victorian Communities. Thwaites&#x27; term as Minister for Water coincided with the millennium drought in southeast Australia that put significant pressure on urban and rural water supplies. Premier Steve Bracks and Thwaites led a major water saving campaign commencing in 2003 that  by 2006 had reduced water use per head by 22 per cent compared to the 1990s.

Thwaites introduced major reforms to water policy and legislation in Victoria including giving the environment a statutory right to water, reforming irrigation water rights and establishing sustainable water planning strategies. He also oversaw programs to return environmental flows to the Murray, Snowy, and Thomson Rivers.

In 2007, after Victoria had experienced its worst year of drought and the lowest streamflows in the state&#x27;s history, Premier Steve Bracks and Thwaites announced the &quot;Our Water Our Future&quot; plan which included a new desalination plant at Wonthaggi, modernising Victoria’s irrigation system to save water lost through inefficiencies, expanding a water grid across Victoria and increased recycling and water conservation.

As Minister for Environment, Thwaites introduced measures to lower greenhouse emissions and water consumption. Victoria was the first state to introduce five-star energy efficiency requirements for new homes together with incentives for rainwater tanks and solar hot water.

Thwaites also oversaw a major expansion of Victoria&#x27;s national park system, including creation of the Great Otway National Park, and removed cattle grazing from the Alpine National Park.

In the second term of the Bracks government, Thwaites led the development of the government&#x27;s social justice strategy, &quot;A Fairer Victoria&quot;, working with other social policy ministers. The strategy committed $788 million in the 2005 state budget and $818 million in the 2006 budget to tackle disadvantage across a range of areas including early childhood development, mental health, disability, and community development. It was described by the head of the Brotherhood of St Laurence as “an unprecedented effort to make Victoria a better place for those who are disadvantaged and vulnerable.”

Thwaites was re-elected at Victorian elections 2006 with a comfortable but slightly reduced majority. While there was some speculation he might be dumped as Deputy Premier, Premier Bracks has supported him continuing in this role. In the cabinet re-shuffle after the election he became minister for climate change but lost the portfolio of Victorian communities.

In June 2007, amid rumours of Bracks resigning as premier, there was a series of leaks from inside government about Mr Thwaites and his family being given free accommodation, lift passes, food and drink at ski resorts over the last five years without declaring it. The family stayed at government-owned apartments at the invitation of the management boards, which he had appointed. Documents obtained under freedom-of-information laws show Thwaites made 17 taxpayer-funded visits to Victoria&#x27;s snowfields and national parks between 2003 and 2007. He had eight stays at Tidal River on Wilsons Promontory, five trips to Mount Hotham and two each to Mount Buller and Falls Creek in the four years he was environment minister. Expenses for the trips, which each required at least one night&#x27;s accommodation, totalled more than $17,500.

==== Resignation ====
When Premier Steve Bracks announced his surprise resignation on 27 July 2007, only hours later
Thwaites announced he too would resign. He said he had been Deputy Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party in Victoria for ten years and it was now time &quot;to give someone else a go and bring in some new blood&quot;. He officially resigned on 30 July 2007 and from parliament on 6 August 2007.

==After politics==
After leaving politics, Thwaites became a professor at Monash University and chair of Monash Sustainable Development Institute and ClimateWorks Australia. 

He has also been appointed to a number of senior board positions, including president, Australian Centre for the Moving Image (ACMI), chair Australian Building Codes Board, chair the Climate Group, chair Peter Cullen Trust, and director of Green Building Council of Australia and Fair Trade Australia New Zealand. He was also a consultant to Maddocks Solicitors with specialty areas of practice in environment, water and climate change between 2008 and 2015.

In 2011, Thwaites was appointed as chair of the Australian Building Codes Board, the body responsible for developing and managing Australia&#x27;s building regulations. In 2012, he was appointed as chair of the National Sustainability Council that provides independent advice to the Australian Government on sustainability issues and produces independent reports on sustainability indicators and trends.

Thwaites is currently the chair of Melbourne Water, which manages Melbourne’s water, sewerage, drainage and waterway health, and sits on a number of water advisory bodies.

Thwaites has been appointed to a number of reviews and advisory bodies for the federal and state governments. In 2016, the Victorian Government appointed him with Terry Mulder and Patricia Faulkner to conduct an independent review of retail electricity and gas markets.

The review recommended major reforms to energy pricing for households and small business including a &quot;no frills&quot; electricity price to be regulated by the Essential Services Commission, the end of misleading marketing, and requiring retailers to fix offer prices for 12 months. The Victorian Government has now implemented most of these reforms.

In 2017, amid public concern about flammable cladding on buildings, Thwaites was appointed with former Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu to co-chair the Victorian Cladding Taskforce to oversee the investigation and audit of buildings with dangerous cladding. Following recommendations of the Cladding Taskforce, the Victorian Government conducted a statewide audit of multi-story buildings, boosted enforcement of building regulations and announced a $600 million plan to remove dangerous cladding from buildings.

Since leaving politics, Thwaites has worked with governments, business and academics to promote sustainable development and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In 2012, he was appointed by the Australian Government as chair of the National Sustainability Council to provide independent advice to the government on sustainability issues. The Council produced the &quot;Sustainable Australia Report 2013&quot;. He currently chairs the National Sustainable Development Council, which in 2018 produced the &quot;Transforming Australia: SDG Progress report&quot; on Australia&#x27;s progress in implementing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). He is currently co-chair of the Leadership Council of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) launched by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to mobilise universities in support of the SDGs.

In July 2020, Thwaites was appointed to &quot;The Lancet&quot; Covid-19 Commission, which aims to speed up global and equitable solutions to the pandemic.

==Recognition and awards==
Thwaites was appointed Member of the Order of Australia for &quot;significant service to the environment, and to the people and Parliament of Victoria&quot; in the 2021 Australia Day Honours.

<text>George Smalridge (&quot;alias&quot; Smallridge; 18 May 1662 – 27 September 1719) was Bishop of Bristol (1714–1719).

==Life==
Smalridge was born at Lichfield, son of the Sheriff of Lichfield Thomas Smalridge, George received his early education, this being completed at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford.

His political opinions were largely modelled on those of his friend Francis Atterbury, with whom he was associated at Oxford and elsewhere. After being a tutor at Christ Church, he was minister of two chapels in London, and for six or seven years he acted as deputy for William Jane, the regius professor of divinity at Oxford; his Jacobite opinions, however, prevented him from securing this position when it fell vacant in 1707.

In 1711, he was made dean of Carlisle Cathedral and canon of Christ Church, and in 1713 he succeeded Atterbury as dean of Christ Church. In the following year he was appointed bishop of Bristol, but retained his deanery. In 1715 Smalridge refused to sign the declaration against the pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, defending his action in his Reasons for not signing the Declaration. In other ways also he showed animus against the house of Hanover, but his only punishment was his removal from the post of lord almoner to the king.

The bishop was esteemed by Swift, Steele, Whiston and other famous men of his day, while Dr Johnson declared his sermons to be of the highest class.

<doc id="1269175" wikidata="Q5557297" url="?curid=1269175" title="Ghost of a Dog">
<text>Ghost of a Dog is the second album by American alternative rock band Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians, released in 1990.

In the printed lyrics that accompany the album, each song has a word with a single letter missing. In order, they spell out &quot;ghost of a dog.&quot; 

The album sold about 500,000 copies. After a tour in support of the album, the band decided to take an indefinite hiatus.

==Production==
The album was produced by Tony Berg. Unlike on the debut, where many tracks used session musicians, the New Bohemians play throughout &quot;Ghost of a Dog&quot;.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; thought that &quot;Brickell and the Bohemians band do a reasonable job of recycling the soothing elements of ‘60s pop-folk, but her own views are so childlike and her images so often pointless that it’s hard to work up any feeling for them.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Brickell can write lyrically about the difference between the desire for romantic independence and desire itself. But just when she starts to show some grit, she’ll drift toward smiley-faced ditties like &#x27;Oak Cliff Bra&#x27; — songs so cloying they make you wonder if Brickell underwent a lobotomy between tracks.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared that none of the songs recaptured the charm of the first album&#x27;s &quot;What I Am&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that Brickell&#x27;s &quot;ability to write wisely about the bad stuff of romance with a marked lack of anger toward the opposite sex makes her unique and-for postmodern romantics-endearing.&quot;

<text>John Chadwick, (21 May 1920 – 24 November 1998) was an English linguist and classical scholar who was most notable for the decipherment, with Michael Ventris, of Linear B.

==Early life, education and wartime service==
John Chadwick was born at 18 Christ Church Road, Mortlake, Surrey, on 21 May 1920, the younger son of Margaret Pamela (&quot;née&quot; Bray) and Fred Chadwick, civil servant. He was educated at St Paul&#x27;s School and Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. 

Chadwick volunteered for the Royal Navy in 1940 after completing the first year of his classics course at Cambridge. At first he served in the Mediterranean as an ordinary seaman aboard the light cruiser HMS Coventry and saw action when his ship was torpedoed by an Italian submarine and dive-bombed. In 1942 he was sent ashore at Alexandria for an interview by the Chief of Naval Intelligence and was immediately assigned to intelligence duties in Egypt and promoted to Temporary Sub Lieutenant in the RNVR. Thereafter he worked on Italian codes. Chadwick deduced from some R/T traffic meant to be handled at Bletchley Park that a British submarine had been sunk near Taranto.

In 1944, he was transferred to Bletchley Park (&quot;Station X&quot;), learned Japanese, and worked on reading the encoded messages sent by the Japanese naval representatives in Stockholm and Berlin.

After the end of the war in 1945, he returned to his studies at Cambridge, graduating with First Class Honours in Classics Part II, with a distinction in his special subject, linguistics. While studying at Corpus Christi College, he attempted, with some of his fellow students, to use cryptographic methods to decipher the &quot;Minoan Linear Script B&quot;. They were already aware at the time of the work of Michael Ventris. They stopped working actively on the problem owing to a lack of published data from inscriptions.

==Career==
In 1950 he published his first scholarly work, an edition of &quot;The Medical Works of Hippocrates&quot;, co-authored with his cousin, William Neville Mann, a distinguished physician. After finishing his degree, he joined the staff of the &quot;Oxford Latin Dictionary&quot; before beginning a Classics lectureship at Cambridge in 1952. In July that year he heard a radio broadcast by Michael Ventris about his work on Linear B and offered his help as &quot;a mere philologist&quot;. The men began to collaborate on the progressive decipherment of Linear B, writing &quot;Documents in Mycenean Greek&quot; in 1956, following a controversial first paper three years earlier. Chadwick&#x27;s philological ideas were applied to Ventris&#x27;s initial theory that Linear B was an early form of Greek rather than another Mediterranean language.

After Ventris&#x27;s death, Chadwick became the figurehead of the Linear B work, writing the accessible and popular book &quot;The Decipherment of Linear B&quot; in 1958 and revising &quot;Documents in Mycenaean Greek&quot; in 1978.

He retired in 1984, by which time he had become the fourth (and last) Perceval Maitland Laurence Reader in Classics at Cambridge. He continued his scholarship until his death, being an active member of several international societies and writing numerous popular and academic articles. He was also a Fellow of the British Academy and of Downing College, Cambridge.

==Family==
Chadwick married Joan Hill in 1947. They had one son, Camden Chadwick.

<doc id="1269177" wikidata="Q7798572" url="?curid=1269177" title="Thrud the Barbarian">
<text>Thrud the Barbarian is a comics character created by British artist Carl Critchlow in 1981. Although Thrud himself is a parody of Conan the Barbarian, particularly as depicted in the Arnold Schwarzenegger films, inspiration for the character&#x27;s adventures and adversaries has been drawn from several fantasy sources.

During the 1980s, a Thrud comic strip was a regular and popular feature in the roleplay and wargame magazine &quot;White Dwarf&quot; with Thrud&#x27;s grotesque and comic antics forming a memorable part of the magazine&#x27;s golden age. In 2002, continued interest in the character from role-playing enthusiasts and a desire to be free to experiment with a new artistic style prompted Critchlow to self-publish a series of award-winning full-length &quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; comics.

Since October 2002, Critchlow has continued to develop his new artistic style in several different &quot;2000 AD&quot; stories, contributing to the success of &quot;Lobster Random&quot; in particular. While Critchlow&#x27;s use of muted palettes has been criticised, his style has received praise for being highly recognisable and unique.

==Appearances==
===Initial publications===
The character of Thrud was created by the then 18-year-old Critchlow in 1981 while he was at foundation art college. His graphic design tutor, Bryan Talbot, gave him the project of producing a comic strip. At the time, Critchlow was reading the Conan books by Robert E. Howard, and this inspired him to produce Thrud. The initial five-page strip was published in comics fanzine &quot;Arken Sword&quot;. When Critchlow moved on to art college in Liverpool, Thrud made a further appearance in the comic &quot;Dead &#x27;Ard&quot;, which Critchlow co-authored with artist Euan Smith. &quot;Dead &#x27;Ard&quot; also featured a strip titled &quot;The Black Currant&quot;, subsequently re-published in the 26th and final issue of the &quot;Warrior&quot; comic anthology. The Black Currant would later appear as one of Thrud&#x27;s many enemies.

===&quot;White Dwarf&quot;===
On seeing an advertisement in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine asking for cartoonists, Critchlow submitted some of his Thrud strips and was hired. &quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; became a monthly feature in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; between issue 45 in September 1983 and issue 105 in September 1988. During this time, the black-and-white single-page strip was voted &quot;Most popular feature&quot; for three consecutive years.

In 1987, a collection of Thrud strips was published in a &quot;Thrud the Barbarian Graffik Novel&quot; by Games Workshop. In addition to strips that had been printed in &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, this anthology included a re-drawn version of the original &quot;Arken Sword&quot; strip and an origin story for Thrud.

===Full-length comic===
Once the Thrud strip had run its course in &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, Critchlow worked on other comics including the Judge Dredd/Batman crossover story &quot;The Ultimate Riddle&quot;, first published in 1995. His work on this story was fully painted, and while considered impressive&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman/Dredd&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was also criticised as being forced, confused and muddy. Critchlow was developing a new style based on line-drawings with computer colouring, but having been pigeon-holed as a painter did not believe that he would be able to interest anyone in this very different style.

When attending gaming conventions, Critchlow found that he was often remembered for his work on Thrud and recognised that there was still an interest in the character. He therefore decided to create and self-publish a full-length &quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; comic as a way to get his new style noticed. A total of five &quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; comics were published:

#&quot;Carborundum Capers&quot; – June 2002
#&quot;Ice &#x27;n&#x27; a Slice&quot; – January 2003
#&quot;Lava Louts&quot; – June 2004
#&quot;Thrud Rex!&quot; – June 2005
#&quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot; – January 2007

Critchlow found that, by organising distribution through comic shops and a devoted Thrud website, he was able to break even financially. His new style was also noticed and received positive comments.

The cover images for each of the first four comics were hand-painted in contrast to the computer-coloured line art used in the comic itself. For issue 5, Critchlow also used his new style for the cover image.

==Fictional character biography==
An origin story for Thrud was printed in the &quot;Thrud the Barbarian Graffik Novel&quot;. The story tells of a group of mercenaries who, lost and searching for a pub, stumble across an abandoned baby in a deserted village. The mercenaries decide to raise the baby as one of their own, teaching him how to fight and drink beer.

At the age of five, Thrud is sent to &quot;Crom the Destroyer Orthodox Pagan Infants School&quot;, where he towers above the teachers and his fellow students. When one of the children shoots him with a pea shooter, Thrud&#x27;s reaction is to kill and maim twenty-seven pupils and three teachers, leading to his expulsion from the school. Choosing to return to the wilderness rather than his adoptive parents, Thrud lives alone until, one day, he stumbles across a hidden burial chamber. Finding a small helmet and a large axe, Thrud arms himself. Finding gold and gems, he decides to return to civilisation with his newfound wealth, quickly establishing himself a reputation as a violent warrior.

Many years later, Thrud the Barbarian becomes Thrud the King, but finds the mundane duties of kingship tiresome without opportunities to fight. To put a halt to Thrud&#x27;s constant mutterings of, &quot;Kill! Death! Maim! Mutilate! Destroy!&quot;, the wise men of his kingdom collect stories of heroism from around the land and read them to him long into the night.

==Characterisation==
Endowed with the strength of a rhinoceros, the speed and agility of a jungle cat and the intelligence of a garden snail, Thrud is a one-dimensional character who engages in mindless slaughter and strikes Frank Frazetta-style poses while remaining ignorant of plot points. Depicted as an barbarian with a hugely exaggerated, muscular physique and a very small head, and dressed in large furry boots and a loincloth, Thrud is a caricature of Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s Conan the Barbarian.

Thrud is also a heavy drinker, frequenting &quot;The Hobbit&#x27;s Armpit&quot; tavern and regularly causing mayhem when he is unable to have his desired flavour of crisps. These and other annoyances often cause Thrud to invoke the author of the Conan the Barbarian books with the battle cry, &quot;By the sacred jockstrap of Robert E. Howard you&#x27;ll pay for this, Hellspawn!&quot;

==Supporting characters==
===The Black Currant===
First appearing in &quot;Dead &#x27;Ard&quot; and &quot;Warrior&quot;, The Black Currant returned in a series of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; Thrud strips titled &quot;Thrud the Destroyer&quot;. In this story, The Black Currant is the leader of a horde of warriors who attack a small village, looting the homes, burning the women, raping the livestock and eating the babies. The Black Currant returned again in issue 3 of Critchlow&#x27;s self-published &quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; comic as the leader of a group of bandits laying siege to a small town. The Black Currant is depicted in heavy black armour, wearing a helmet provided with a pair of exceedingly long, horizontally extending horns.

===Carl Critchlow===
Critchlow himself appears in a number of Thrud strips, occasionally as a narrator although more often as a drinking companion for Thrud. Critchlow depicts himself with lank hair and a large cap pulled down low over his eyes.

===Croneman the Cimpletan===
Croneman claims to be the mightiest barbarian of the northern tribes and honorary chief of the savage bezerkers of Nid. Known also as Amoron, the Wombat, he is a slayer, a reaver, a corsair, a usurper, and a conqueror. Depicted as resembling Schwarzenegger, he is also a bodybuilder with a very silly accent. On first meeting Croneman, Thrud slices him in half with a sword. When Croneman returns to join a group of mercenaries fighting The Black Currant in &quot;Thrud the Destroyer&quot;, he is depicted with a line of sutures running down the middle of his face and chest.

===Lymara, the She Wildebeeste===
Thrud first encounters Lymara when he sees her chasing away a wasp by waving a small cloth from her tower bedroom. Thinking her to be a damsel in distress, Thrud storms the tower, killing Lymara&#x27;s father, five brothers, two uncles, ten cousins and fiance in the process. Seeking revenge, Lymara attempts to poison Thrud with a bottle of Acme &quot;Mammoth Poison&quot;, but succeeds only in putting him to sleep as part of &quot;The Three Tasks of Thrud&quot; series of strips. Subsequently, Lymara joins Thrud as one of the group of mercenaries brought in to fight The Black Currant in &quot;Thrud the Destroyer&quot;. In this latter series of strips, Lymara is depicted with oversized breasts barely covered by an off-the-shoulder leather bra.

===To-Me Ku-Pa===
To-Me Ku-Pa (a name phonetically similar to that of British comedian Tommy Cooper) is an evil necromancer who regularly crosses paths with Thrud and is depicted as a bald man wearing a large cloak. Thrud first encounters To-Me Ku-Pa in an early &quot;White Dwarf&quot; strip and is turned into a frog. Subsequently, in &quot;The Three Tasks of Thrud&quot;, To-Me Ku-Pa takes advantage of Thrud&#x27;s drugged state, following Lymara&#x27;s failed assassination attempt, to hypnotise him and force him to obtain three items necessary for a spell.

In &quot;Thrud the Destroyer&quot;, To-Me Ku-Pa is revealed as being in service to The Black Currant and is providing him with an army of warriors drawn from throughout time, including daleks and Imperial stormtroopers. To-Me Ku-Pa also appears as the villain in issue 1 of the full-length &quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; comic.

==Merchandise==

A range of Thrud merchandise has been produced since the character&#x27;s inception, including a Thrud T-shirt and badge as well as a series of miniatures. Citadel Miniatures produced five different metal miniatures of Thrud, starting in 1984 with a &quot;White Dwarf Personality&quot; miniature. Three numbered limited edition miniatures followed consisting of &quot;LE12, Thrud the Barbarian&quot;, in 1986, &quot;LE19, Thrud and Female Admirer&quot; in 1987, and &quot;LE104, Thrud scratching head&quot;. Thrud was also introduced as a Blood Bowl player and Jervis Johnson commissioned an appropriate miniature. Heresy Miniatures has also produced three Thrud miniatures, including a limited edition &quot;Strolling Thrud&quot; that sold out within three weeks of release. On 29 March 2007, another limited edition of 1000 resin miniatures was released.

==Reception and awards==
&quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; was one of the best loved pieces in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; over the five years that the strip ran, being voted &quot;Most popular feature&quot; for three consecutive years during the magazine&#x27;s golden age. Long-term fans of Thrud were excited and nostalgic to see him return in his own full-length comic, but were concerned that the idea would not stretch to 24 pages. In reviewing issue 1, Jez Higgins, writing on &quot;TRS2&quot;, and Robert Clark of &quot;Strike to Stun&quot;, considered the comic a success that was more than one joke spread thin and which was not limited by the single page brevity of the original strip. Steven Maxwell of &quot;Bulletproof Comics&quot;, however, found that what worked well within the constraints of a single page seemed stretched when spun out over 24. Issue 2 received similarly mixed reviews, with Clark criticising the comic for being much the same, with the same themes and joke as issue 1 while Glenn Carter of &quot;Comics Bulletin&quot; found it to be well written light reading with quite a few elements of humour. Overall, the comic was deemed a success, with even the more negative reviewers awarding it 6 out of 10 and looking forward to more issues.

Although the writing received mixed reviews, the reception of the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow&#x27;s new style to be much more open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow&#x27;s development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique with a lot of character.

Critchlow was also commended for the risky decision to write, draw and publish the comic himself. The comic was compared favourably with professional quality comics, with its lack of adverts viewed as an advantage over those offerings. The high production values were also praised, with the glossy cover and high quality paper used for the inner pages.

In 2004, &quot;Thrud the Barbarian&quot; won the Eagle Award for &quot;Favourite British Small Press Title&quot;. In 2006 Thrud was nominated for the &quot;Favourite Colour Comicbook – British&quot; Eagle Award, but lost out to &quot;2000 AD&quot;.

==Legacy==

In October 2002, four months after &quot;Thrud&quot; issue 1 was published, Critchlow returned to &quot;2000AD&quot; using his new computer-drawn style. His first story was the Judge Dredd, &quot;Out of the Undercity&quot; story written by John Wagner. The new style was initially well received by &quot;2000AD Review&quot; and seen as a marked improvement over his previous fully painted style with clearer figures and atmospheric colouring. As the &quot;Undercity&quot; story developed, however, Critchlow was criticised for using too narrow a palette, with too many greys and blues, although this might have been as a result of the story being set underground.

&quot;2000AD Review&quot;&#x27;s criticism of Critchlow&#x27;s subdued colouring continued with the 2003 Lobster Random story, &quot;No Gain, No Pain&quot;. By the conclusion, however, Critchlow&#x27;s style was recognised as being truly unique and even the previously criticised blues and greys were seen to work well when used with other coloured elements. The artwork in two further Lobster Random stories, &quot;Tooth &amp; Claw&quot; in October 2004 and &quot;The Agony &amp; the Ecstasy&quot; in April 2006 was again very well received. &quot;Tooth &amp; Claw&quot; was praised for its character designs while Critchlow&#x27;s style in &quot;The Agony &amp; the Ecstasy&quot; was said to be easily recognisable, having &quot;volume, colour and verve&quot;.

<doc id="1269179" wikidata="Q8018765" url="?curid=1269179" title="William Steele (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)">
<text>William Steele (bap. 19 August 1610, Sandbach1680) was an English lawyer, judge and politician who sat in the House of Commons in 1654. He was Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

Steele was a son of Richard Steele of Sandbach, Cheshire, and his wife Cicely Shaw, and was educated at Caius College, Cambridge.

In 1648 he was chosen to be Recorder of London, and he was one of the four counsel appointed to conduct the case against Charles I in January 1649, but illness prevented him from discharging this duty. However, a few days later he took part in the prosecution of James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton and other leading Royalists.

Steele was elected MP for the City of London in 1654. He was Chief Baron of the Exchequer in 1655, and was made Lord Chancellor of Ireland in 1656. After the fall of Richard Cromwell, he was one of the five commissioners appointed in 1659 to govern Ireland. At the end of that year, he returned to England, but he refused to sit on the committee of safety to which he had been named.

At the Restoration he obtained the full benefits of the Act of Indemnity, but he thought it advisable to reside for a time in Holland. However, he returned to England before his death, towards the end of 1680.

==Family==
William was the nephew of Thomas Steele (died 1643), who was shot for surrendering Beeston Castle in the Civil War. His brother Laurence Steele (bap. 1616) was Clerk of the Irish House of Commons from 1662 to 1697.

He married firstly in 1638 Elizabeth Godfrey of Kent, daughter of Richard Godfrey, MP for New Romney and Mary Moyle. He married secondly in 1662 Mary Mellish, widow of Michael Harvey (a brother of the noted scientist William Harvey). He had issue by both marriages. His daughter, Mary Steele (died 1673), married George Boddington (1646–1719), a director of the Bank of England. His grandson was the writer Richard Steele (1672–1729), the son of the elder Richard Steele, William&#x27;s only son from his first marriage, and his wife Elinor Symes (née Sheyls). The elder Richard was an attorney who spent much of his life in Ireland: he died in 1676.

<text>Polygyros (Greek: Πολύγυρος) is a town and municipality in Central Macedonia, Greece. It is the capital of Chalkidiki.

==Geography==

Polygyros town (pop. 7,779 at the 2021 census) is built in the shape of an amphitheatre on a plateau on the south west side of the mountain Cholomontas. It is south of Greek National Road 16 (Thessaloniki - Arnaia). Polygyros is located SE of Thessaloniki, NE of Nea Moudania, NW of Sithonia and SW of Arnaia. The municipal unit (the municipality before 2011) has a population of 11,386 inhabitants (2021) and a land area of 470.933 km2. Other large communities in the municipal unit are Ólynthos (pop. 1,053), Taxiárchis (742), and Vrástama (944).

===Climate===

Polygyros has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csa&quot;), closely bordering on a humid subtropical climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with relatively cold winters and relatively hot summers due to its elevation.

==Name==
There are different speculations about the origin of Polygyros&#x27; name. Some claim that it comes from the combination of &quot;poly&quot; (much) and &quot;geros&quot; (strong), because of the healthy climate. Others believe that the words &quot;poly&quot; and (sacred) have given the present name, because of an ancient temple in the area. Also an old landowner, named &quot;Polyaros&quot;, offers a possible etymology. A further potential source could be from &quot;poly&quot; and &quot;gyros&quot;, referring to the residents&#x27; dietary habits. According to another possible etymology, the name derives from &quot;poly&quot; and &quot;gyros&quot; (round), possible due to the town&#x27;s amphitheatric position.

==Municipality==
The municipality Polygyros was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 4 former municipalities, that became municipal units:
*Anthemountas
*Ormylia
*Polygyros
*Zervochoria

The municipality has an area of 947.417 km2, the municipal unit 470.933 km2. The municipality includes the villages of Vrastama, Taxiarchis, Ormylia, Olynthos, Gerakini and Kalives.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Some situate in the broader area of modern Polygyros the ancient city of Apollonia. Apollonia was one of the 32 cities, which, under the leadership of the Olynthus, constituted the &quot;Koinon ton Chalkideon&quot; (Chalkidian League). The &quot;Koinon&quot; was destroyed in 379 BCE by the Spartans, while in 348 BCE Philipp II of Macedon annexed the whole Chalcidice into the Macedonian Kingdom. In 168 BCE Chalcidice was subjected by the Romans.

===Byzantine and Ottoman Era===
The town of Polygyros is first mentioned in a medieval imperial document, &quot;chryssovoulon&quot; (with golden stamp), of Eastern Roman Emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates about 1080 CE. In 1430, as the rest of the Eastern Roman Empire, Polygyros was conquered by the Ottomans and belonged to the Sanjak of Thessaloniki. On 17 May 1821 the people of Polygyros rose against the Ottoman authority and managed, temporarily, to expel the Ottoman guard. Polygyros, such as other villages of the peninsula, were burned by the Ottomans.

Many residents of Polygyros also took part in the 1854&#x27;s unsuccessful revolutionary movement against the Ottomans.

===Modern Era===
Finally, on November 2, 1912 the Greek army, as one of the victors of the First Balkan War, entered Polygyros and incorporated the town in the Greek State.

==Culture==
Polygyros is famous for its carnival celebrations, which attracts visitors from all over Greece. A nearby location called Panagia (Virgin Mary) is the setting of a famous religious celebration on August 15. Also, cultural societies are active in the fields of folk music and dance. Classic and modern music is cultivated in the municipal conservatory. There is a Folklore Museum in the town, opened in 1998.

===Sports===
&quot;Niki&quot; (victory) is the name of Polygyros&#x27; football club, which participates in the Greek National Fourth Division Professional League. &quot;AOP&quot; (Athletic Club of Polygyros) is the local basketball team, participant in the Third National Basketball Division.

==Landmarks==
The Archaeological Museum of Polygyros has exhibits containing findings from all over Chalkidiki and referring to paleolithic and neolithic age, geometric, archaic, classic, hellenistic and Roman period.

<doc id="1269185" wikidata="Q3959702" url="?curid=1269185" title="Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars">
<text>Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians, released on August 9, 1988, by Geffen Records. The album went 2× platinum in the United States.

&quot;What I Am&quot; was the lead single and big hit from the album, reaching #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The follow-up single, &quot;Circle&quot;, was about strained relationships. Although described by author Brent Mann as &quot;the perfect follow up single to &#x27;What I Am&#x27;&quot; and which &quot;had &#x27;smash&#x27; written all over it&quot;, it stalled at #48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and fared slightly better on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart, reaching #32. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of &quot;Circle&quot; that &quot;The key to this gentle song is Brickell’s breathy intensity. Supported by an acoustic-slanted track, she manages to sell the unusually dark lyric shadings.&quot; Another song from the album, &quot;Little Miss S.&quot; was inspired by Edie Sedgwick and reached #38 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #14 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

==Reception==
&quot;&quot;Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars&quot; is almost impossible to be cynical about (I tried),&quot; remarked &quot;Time Out&quot;, &quot;and the band are so likeable it&#x27;s almost unreal.&quot;

<text>The Dresden Funicular Railway () is a funicular in Dresden, Germany, connecting the districts of Loschwitz, near the &quot;Blue Wonder&quot; bridge, and Weisser Hirsch.

The railway is one of two funicular railways in Dresden, the other being the unusual Schwebebahn Dresden, a suspended monorail. Both lines are operated by the Dresdner Verkehrsbetriebe AG, which also operate the city&#x27;s tram, bus and ferry networks.

==History==
Although the construction of the line had been discussed and planned since 1873, the permit to build the railway was not issued until 1893. The railway was opened on October 26, 1895, and was originally run by a steam engine.

In 1910 the line was converted to run on electricity, and in 1912 its operation was transferred to the Dresden municipal tramways, whose successors still operate it. During the bombing of Dresden on the 13 February 1945, the lower station of the funicular was destroyed. However the cars had been moved into the line&#x27;s tunnels for safety, and survived.

Major renewals took place in 1978 and 1993. On January 6, 2014, the line was again closed for a major refurbishment of both the cars and the line. The refurbishment was expected to be completed by April, 2014 and to cost €350,000.

==Operation==
The funicular operates between 06:30 and 21:00 on weekdays, and between 09:00 and 21:00 at weekends and public holidays. During operating hours there are between four and six journeys per hour in each direction.

The line has the following technical parameters:

<doc id="1269215" wikidata="Q4497800" url="?curid=1269215" title="Henry Youle Hind">
<text>Henry Youle Hind (1 June 1823 – 8 August 1908) was a Canadian geologist and explorer. He was born in Nottingham, England, and immigrated to Canada, settling in Toronto, Ontario, in 1846. Hind led expeditions to explore the Canadian prairies in 1857 and 1858. In 1857, he explored the Red and Assiniboine River valleys, and in 1858, the Assiniboine, Souris, Qu&#x27;Appelle, and South Saskatchewan River valleys. The expeditions are described in his reports &quot;Narrative of the Canadian Red River Exploring Expedition of 1857&quot; and &quot;Reports of Progress on the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition&quot;. Hind&#x27;s activities changed perceptions of the North West and helped open up the Canadian Prairies for agriculture settlement.

==Early life==
Henry Youle Hind was born in Nottingham, England. He was the third son of Thomas Hind and Sarah Youle Hind. His older brothers were Thomas and James Fisher, the younger William. He also had a younger sister Sarah. On 7 February he married Katherine Cameron at York Mills. She was the second daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Duncan Cameron. Their first child Thomas Francis Neil Hind was born in 1851. They settled in Toronto where they had four more sons and two daughters by 1863.

Hind was responsible for much of his own education growing up, but did receive some formal schooling. He was taught the classics, mathematics, and penmanship at Nottingham Grammar School. In 1837 he went to study in Leipzig. In 1839 he returned to England and continued his studies in Nottingham for another four years. On 26 May 1843 Hind was accepted into Cambridge University but only stayed for one year.

In 1846, he immigrated to Canada where he settled in Toronto. In March 1847 he began his scientific career writing on a meteorological &#x27;halo&#x27;. In October of that year he was employed by Egerton Ryerson. He was given a position at the Provincial Normal School in Toronto as a second master of science and mathematics. In 1850 he published &quot;Lectures on Agricultural Chemistry&quot; and the following year &quot;A Comparative View of the Climate of Western Canada.&quot; In December 1851 he became an early member of the Canadian Institute. From 1852 until 1855 he was the editor of the Institute&#x27;s periodical the &quot;Canadian Journal.&quot; He was also employed as a professor of chemistry at the University of Toronto Trinity College, a position he held until 1864. Between 1856 and 1858 he published articles in the Canadian Almanac. These included &quot;The Future of Western Canada, Our Railway Policy,&quot; and &quot;The Great North-West&quot;.

==1857 Red River Expedition==
By the 1850s, British North America had reached a critical stage in its development. Since the 1837 Rebellions in Upper Canada and Lower Canada there had been an increase in immigration and construction of westward canals and rail lines. In the two Canadas agricultural land was becoming scarcer and higher in price. In the North-West of the continent, the fur trade networks were becoming unstable with the future of the west remaining in the control of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company unlikely. New agricultural land was needed by people in the provinces of Upper Canada and Lower Canada. Out of this need for land a movement of expansionism was created in Upper Canada, north of the Great Lakes and the 49th parallel of latitude. 

In Toronto and the Ottawa Valley prominent members of society including George Brown (1818-1880), and Alexander Mcdonnell sought to annex the North-West. To prove that the land in the North-West as suitable for agriculture and settlement, the British Royal ministry in London and Canadian provincial governments funded expeditions exploring west in 1857. The British expedition was formed by the Royal Geographical Society and was led by John Palliser (1817-1887). The Canadian expedition was led officially by George Gladman. Hind was recommended by the head of the Canadian Geological Survey, William Logan (1798-1875), to lead the scientific portion of the expedition. Throughout the expedition Hind was to collect information on topography, vegetation, soil and meteorological observations. 

The Canadian expedition departed on 23 July 1857 from Toronto on the Northern Railway. The group included George Gladman, his son Henry, Simon Dawson, W. H. E. Napier, S. L. Russell, G. F. Gaudet, A. M. Wells, J. A. Dickenson and Robert Wynne. The expedition included a dozen Iroquois, representatives of the fur trade, a dozen Ojibwa natives, several French Canadians, a Scottish man and a Métis native man. The group arrived at Fort William by the end of the month. 

The Palliser and Hind expeditions sought to prove that the previously uninhabitable fur trade lands of the North-West would be useful for agricultural development and immigrants from Upper and Lower Canada. These scientific expeditions were the most immediate consequences of the expansionist campaign. Ultimately the work of Palliser and Hind redefined public opinion and the perceived geography of the North-West. They created the idea of two vast sub-districts. Palliser&#x27;s Triangle consisted of poor soil and was arid and uninhabitable. Hind&#x27;s discovery, called the Fertile Belt, stretched from the Red River Settlement to the Saskatchewan River Valley and the Rocky Mountains. They reinforced the myth of good land in the north of Saskatchewan and the myth of bad land in the interior. 

The Fertile Belt supported expansionist claims of an agricultural oasis. Hind was aware of this and noted it in his work on the expedition, &quot;Narrative of the Canadian Red River Exploring Expedition of 1857 and of the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition of 1858&quot; stating that &quot;it is a physical reality of the highest importance to the interests of British North America that this continuous belt can be settled and cultivated from a few miles west of the &quot;Lake of Woods&quot; to the Passes of the Rocky Mountains, and any line of communication, whether by waggon road or railroad, passing through it, will eventually enjoy the great advantage of being fed by an agricultural population from one extremity to another.&quot; The route that the Canadian expedition used was well known by fur traders and was also used by the Palliser Expedition. They reached Fort Frances by 19 August 1857. From there Hind and Simon Dawson split from George Gladman. They met six men and two canoes to cross the southern portion of the Lake of the Woods to portage the western shore of the Roseau River. Using the Roseau River, Hind and Dawson were to reach the Red River. This was not a usual route for fur traders. 

On 22 August 1857 they reached Garden Island. This was a traditional Ojibwa settlement where they grew corn, potatoes, pumpkin and squash. On the Island Hind collected samples of corn which caused the group to be questioned by an Ojibwa raiding party. An unnamed Ojibwa man was quoted in Hind&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; as saying &quot;to deny your request; but we see how the Indians are treated far away. The white man comes, looks at their flowers, their trees, and their rivers; others soon follow; the lands of the Indians pass from their hands, and they have nowhere a home. You must go by the way white man had hitherto gone. I have told you all.&quot; Following this encounter, Hind and Dawson were forced to take the traditional fur trade route down the Winnipeg River to the Red River. 

Through the government commission of the 1857 expedition Hind was to complete three tasks. The first was to explore the Red River Settlement, the second to examine the Assiniboine River westward as far as Portage la Prairie and make inquiries in the Souris Valley about lignite coal. Third, Hind had to explore the Red River Valley southward to the Roseau River and examine the river well enough to understand the route from the Lake of the Woods. He only had one month from 9 September until 8 October to complete these tasks. 

The expedition ended quickly; Hind was back in Toronto by 4 November 1857. Although he had left the North-West, the work of the expedition was not over. Hind printed a report on the expedition in 1858 that ran over four hundred pages in total length. His report was received well especially by the &quot;Globe&quot;, a newspaper run by expansionist George Brown. The reception of the Canadian expedition ensured another for the following year although this time it would be led by Hind and Simon Dawson.

==1858 Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Expedition==
The success of the 1857 expedition led to the creation of two Canadian expeditions led by Simon Dawson and Hind in 1858. Dawson was to evaluate the country from the Red River to Fort William for an immigration route. Hind&#x27;s expedition was to look westward from the Red River to the south branch of the Saskatchewan River to examine territory for the possibility of settlement, coal mining in the Souris Valley and the salt springs of Lake Winnipegosis. The members of Hind&#x27;s expedition included photographer and surveyor Humphrey Lloyd Hime, J.A. Dickenson, John Fleming, thirteen Iroquois, an Ojibwa man, and two French Canadians. 

The group arrived at Grand Portage on 5 May 1858 and had arrived at the mouth of the Winnipeg River by the 29 May. It took some time to prepare the supplies and men for the expedition but they were in the field by 19 June. In addition to scientific information, Hind also collected information on the lifestyle of the Plains Cree. In 1857 the Plains Cree in council had decided that no white man should be allowed to hunt in or travel through their country due to multiple broken promises and the destruction of the buffalo. Hind was witness to the collapse of the hunting economy of the old North-West. By 18 September 1858 Hind&#x27;s expedition was beginning its last phase. By 28 December he was back in Toronto.

==Later career==
Following Hind&#x27;s return to Toronto he resumed his teaching position at University of Toronto, Trinity College and membership to the Royal Canadian Institute. He prepared a report on the 1858 expedition and attempted to organize a third expedition to the Bow River and the Rocky Mountains. An economic depression in 1857 left the Canadian government wary of further expenditures on scientific expeditions so Hind&#x27;s proposal was declined. In 1859 he published &quot;Of Some of the Superstitions and Customs Common Among the Indians in the Valley of the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan&quot; in the &quot;Canadian Journal&quot;. After 1859, Hind attempted to resume exploring and publishing. During the winter of 1859-1860 Hind returned to England to see his &quot;Narrative&quot; published. In 1861 he planned an expedition to the North-East. He sought to survey the land around the Labrador Peninsula. This was not a government funded expedition. In 1863 he published a report on this expedition entitled &quot;Explorations in the Interior of the Labrador Peninsula&quot; in two volumes. In 1864 Hind left his job at Trinity College after being invited to speak at the Royal Geographical Society. Once back in Toronto he was invited by Peter Mitchell of New Brunswick to have their geological resources surveyed. Hind left Toronto in May for New Brunswick. At the same time as Hind&#x27;s geological survey, another was being led by L. W. Bailey and G. F. Matthew. Only one of these surveys was to be paid a sum of five hundred dollars by the Canadian government. While the government was deciding which report would be used, an anonymous editorial was published in The Headquarters, a local daily in Fredericton which scrutinized the work of Bailey and Matthew. It was believed that Hind was the author of the editorial and it had serious consequences for him. He lost his reputation among workers in the same field and was not employed as the provincial geologist of New Brunswick.

In September 1864 Hind settled his family in Fredericton. In July 1865 his eldest son drowned while bathing in the Saint John River. The family remained in Fredericton until the following year. In the fall of 1866 the Hind family moved to Windsor, Nova Scotia where the boys attended King&#x27;s College and the girls Edgehill. Two of Hind&#x27;s other sons died; James Archibald of unknown causes after the move to Windsor and John Youle of typhoid in 1880. In Windsor Hind was employed by the Mineral Exploration and Mining Association of Nova Scotia. In 1876 he was invited by Francis von Ellerhausen to make a geological survey of Labrador. Two years later he displayed a map of the oceanic currents in the region. From 1884 until his death in 1908 Hind wrote no more on any scientific or public subject. He became focused on the local history of Windsor. In 1889 he published a history of the Old Burying Ground and in 1890 the &quot;Centennial History of King&#x27;s College.&quot; In February 1906 he became ill and died on 8 August 1908. He was buried in Maplewood, Nova Scotia.

Hind was named a National Historic Person in 2018.

<text>The Kent Downs is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in Kent, England. They are the eastern half of the North Downs and stretch from the London/Surrey borders to the White Cliffs of Dover, including a small section of the London Borough of Bromley. The AONB also includes the Greensand Ridge, a prominent sandstone escarpment which lies south of the chalk escarpment of the North Downs. 

It was first designated as an AONB in July 1968 and covers 878 square km (326 square miles). The AONB&#x27;s highest point is Toy&#x27;s Hill, at 250m above sea level, and its boundaries include three main rivers: the Darent, Medway and Stour.

To the west, Surrey Hills AONB adjoins the Kent Downs AONB, and includes a continuation of the North Downs chalk ridge which runs through the Kent Downs, stretching from Farnham to the English Channel and reappearing within the Parc Naturel Régional des Caps et Marais d’Opale in France. High Weald AONB lies to the south east, separated by a distance of just over 2km at Bough Beech Reservoir.

As part of the management of the AONB, Village Design Statements have been adopted by 14 per cent of villages within its boundaries, going on to form part of Supplementary Planning Guidance, recognising the character of the historic landscape and distinctiveness of settlements.

==Areas==
Among the named parts of the Downs are:
*Alkham Valley a dry valley north-west of Dover;
*Betsom&#x27;s Hill highest point in Kent at ; near Westerham
*Blue Bell Hill
*Burham Down
*Castle Hill
*Chartham Downs
*Denge Wood
*Detling Hill
*Elham Valley
*Hollingbourne Downs
*Knole Park
*Lullingstone Country Park
*Ranscombe Farm
*Samphire Hoe
*Summerhouse Hill
*Tolsford Hill
*Torry Hill
*Wye Downs

==Walking==
The North Downs Way runs through the full length of the AONB, the Stour Valley Walk passes through the east of the AONB, and the Greensand Way to the south of Sevenoaks.

<text>Carl Clauberg (28 September 1898 – 9 August 1957) was a German gynecologist who conducted medical experiments on (mostly Jewish) human subjects at Auschwitz concentration camp. He worked with Horst Schumann in X-ray sterilization experiments at Auschwitz concentration camp.

In 1945, near the close of WWII, he was captured by the Red Army and sentenced to 25 years in prison. He was released in 1955 under a prisoner exchange agreement, and he returned to Germany and continued to practice medicine. Due to public outcry from Holocaust survivors, Clauberg was arrested in 1955, but died before he could be tried.

== Early life ==

Carl Clauberg was born in 1898 in Wupperhof (now part of Leichlingen), Rhine Province, into a family of craftsmen.

==Medical career==
During the First World War he served as an infantryman. After the war, he studied medicine and eventually reached the rank of chief doctor in the University gynaecological clinic. He joined the Nazi party in 1933 and later was appointed associate professor of gynaecology at the University of Königsberg. He carried out research on female fertility hormones (particularly progesterone) and their application as infertility treatments, obtaining a habilitation for this work in 1937. He received the rank of &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; of the Reserve.

==Human experiments at Auschwitz==
In 1942 he approached Heinrich Himmler, who knew of him through treatment of a senior SS officer&#x27;s wife and asked him for 
an opportunity to perform mass sterilizations on women for his experiments. Himmler agreed, and in December 1942 Clauberg moved to Auschwitz concentration camp. His laboratory was in a part of the Block 10 in the main camp. Clauberg&#x27;s goal was to find an easy and cheap method to sterilize women. He injected caustic substances into their uteruses without anesthetics. His test subjects were Jewish and Romani women, who either directly died or suffered permanent injuries and infections. About 700 women were also successfully sterilized.

Himmler wanted to know how much time it would take to sterilize 1000 Jewish women in that way. Clauberg&#x27;s answer was satisfactory: One doctor with 10 assistants should be able to conduct sterilization of a few hundred, or even a few thousand, Jews in one day.

==POW, 1945–1955==
When the Red Army approached the camp, Clauberg moved to Ravensbrück concentration camp to continue his experiments on Romani women. Soviet troops captured him there in 1945.

After the war in 1948, Clauberg was put on trial in the Soviet Union and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. In 1955, he was released (but not pardoned) by the Soviet Union under the Adenauer-Bulganin prisoner exchange agreement, with the final group of about 10,000 POWs and civilian internees.

==Medical career, arrest and death, 1955–1957==
He returned to West Germany, where he was reinstated at his former clinic based on his prewar scientific output. Bizarre behavior, including openly boasting of his &quot;achievements&quot; in &quot;developing a new sterilization technique at the Auschwitz concentration camp&quot;, destroyed any chance he might have had of staying unnoticed. In 1955, after public outcry from groups of survivors, Clauberg was arrested. He died before trial on 9 August 1957 in Kiel, Germany.

== Clauberg test ==
The Clauberg test is an obsolete bioassay to assess progestational activity based on the conversion of proliferative endometrium to secretory endometrium in immature rabbits.

<doc id="1269221" wikidata="Q841303" url="?curid=1269221" title="1993–94 FA Premier League">
<text>The 1993–94 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Carling Brewery|Carling]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the second season of the FA Premier League, the top division of professional football in England. Manchester United won the league by eight points over nearest challengers Blackburn Rovers, their second consecutive league title. Swindon Town finished bottom of the league in their first season of top-flight football and were relegated along with Sheffield United and Oldham Athletic. Manchester United also broke their own record of the most points in a season, set by themselves the previous season. This would be surpassed by Chelsea in the 2004–05 season.

==Overview==
===New league sponsors===
From the start of the 1993–94 season, the FA Premier League was sponsored by Carling Breweries.

===Transfers===
Just before the start of the season, Roy Keane became the most expensive footballer signed by an English football team. The 22-year-old Irish midfielder left relegated Nottingham Forest for Manchester United for a fee of £3.75 million.

During the 1993–94 season, many players were transferred between Premier League clubs for fees exceeding £1 million. They included David White (Manchester City to Leeds United), David Rocastle (Leeds United to Manchester City), Roy Wegerle (Blackburn Rovers to Coventry City) and Tim Flowers (Southampton to Blackburn Rovers). At £2.5 million, Flowers became the most expensive goalkeeper in English football.

===Summary===
Manchester United led the 1993–94 Premier League for almost all of the season, eventually finishing as champions eight points ahead of runners-up Blackburn Rovers. They also won the FA Cup after beating Chelsea 4–0 in the final, thereby becoming only the fourth team to achieve this feat in the 20th century (after Tottenham in 1961, Arsenal in 1971 and Liverpool in 1986). Their lead of the Premier League stood at 11 points by the end of October and peaked at 16 points at one stage, but a run of bad results in March was followed by defeat at Blackburn at the beginning of April, which meant that they now led the league merely on goal difference. A return to form towards the end of April then saw United seal the league title with two games still to play.

Norwich City, Leeds United, Newcastle United, Everton and Aston Villa were among the sides who showed promise early in the season before Manchester United established a runaway lead. Norwich reached the third round of the UEFA Cup after famously beating Bayern Munich in the second round, but their league form slumped after manager Mike Walker departed to Everton in January, and the Norfolk side finished 12th. Everton&#x27;s brief lead of the league in the opening stages of the season was followed by a slump in form, and manager Howard Kendall stepped down at the beginning of December with the Toffees now in the bottom half of the table. They only narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of the season. Aston Villa finished a disappointing 10th in the league, but won the Football League Cup for the fourth time.

Finishing runners-up in the Premier League were Blackburn Rovers, whose top scorer Alan Shearer found the net 31 times in the league. In third place came Newcastle United, whose 22-year-old striker Andy Cole was the Premier League&#x27;s leading scorer with 34 goals in 40 games, with a total of 41 goals in all competitions. In fourth place came Arsenal, who achieved success in European competition with a 1–0 win over Parma in the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final.

Swindon Town managed just five league wins all season and were relegated in bottom place having conceded 100 league goals in 42 games; their record for the most goals conceded in a Premier League season would last for three decades before it was surpassed by Sheffield United in 2024. Oldham Athletic, who had avoided relegation on goal difference the previous season, were relegated on the final day of the season after failing to win at Norwich City. The final relegation place went to Sheffield United, who were relegated from the top flight after a 3–2 defeat at Chelsea, with the winning goal coming in injury time (a draw would have been enough to survive, and a loss would have still been enough had Everton not won their final match, 3–2 at home to Wimbledon after coming from 0–2 down). Ipswich Town, who failed to win any of their final 11 games, avoided relegation by holding Blackburn to a goalless draw at Ewood Park, and were less than a minute from being relegated, only to be saved by Chelsea’s late win over Sheffield United.

==Teams==
Twenty-two teams competed in the league—the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Newcastle United, West Ham United and Swindon Town. Newcastle United and West Ham United returned to the top flight after absences of four and one year, respectively, while Swindon Town played in the top flight for the first time.

<text>Eduard Schönfeld (22 December 18281 May 1891) was a German astronomer.

==Education==
Schönfeld was born at Hildburghausen, in the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, where he had a distinguished career at the gymnasium. On leaving the gymnasium, he desired to devote himself to astronomy, but abandoned the idea in deference to his father&#x27;s wishes. He went first to Hanover, and afterwards to Kassel to study architecture, for which he seems to have had little inclination. 1849 found him studying chemistry under Bunsen at Marburg, where his love for astronomy was revived by Gerling&#x27;s lectures.

In 1851, he visited the Bonn Observatory and studied astronomy under Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander. In 1853, he was appointed assistant, and in the following year won a doctor&#x27;s degree with his treatise &quot;Nova elementa Thetidis&quot;. At Bonn he took an important part in preparing the &quot;Durchmusterung&quot; of the northern heavens. He took up the investigation of the light-changes in variable stars, devoting to this work nights which, on account of moonlight, were unsuitable for zone observations. The results of these researches were published in the &quot;Sitz. Berich. Wien. Akad.&quot; vol. xlii.

==Mannheim Observatory==
For a short time he was a &quot;Privatdozent&quot; at Bonn, but in 1859 he was appointed director of the Mannheim Observatory. The instrumental equipment of that observatory was somewhat antiquated, his largest telescope being a small refractor of 73 lines aperture, but he selected a line of work to suit the instruments at his disposal, observing nebulae and variable stars and keeping a watch on comets and new planets. The results of his observations of nebulae are contained in two catalogues published in the &quot;Astronomische Beobachtungen der Grossherzoglichen Sternwarte zu Mannheim&quot;, 1st and 2nd parts (1862 and 1875), and those of his variable star observations appeared in the &quot;Jahresberichte des Mannheimer Vereins für Naturkunde&quot;, Nos. 32 and 39 (1866 and 1875).

==Bonn Observatory==
On the death of Argelander, which occurred on 17 February 1875, Schönfeld was appointed to succeed him as director of the Bonn Observatory, and soon after his appointment he began his last and greatest piece of work, the extension, on Argelander&#x27;s plan, of the survey of the heavens down to 23 degrees of south declination. The experience gained on the northern survey under Argelander&#x27;s direction enabled Schönfeld to introduce some improvements in the methods employed, which increased the accuracy of this work, which was practically accomplished in March 1881, some revision only remaining to be done. These zone observations afforded 363,932 separate places of stars, and form the groundwork of the catalogue of 133,659 stars between 2 and 23 degrees south declination, which was published in 1886 as the eighth volume of the Bonn observations.

==Affiliations==
Schönfeld was a member of the Astronomische Gesellschaft from its foundation in 1863, being a member of council up to 1869, and in 1875 becoming editor of its publications and secretary in conjunction with Winnecke. In 1878 he was elected a Foreign Associate of the Royal Astronomical Society.

==Legacy==
Minor planet 5926 Schönfeld is named in his honor.

<doc id="1269227" wikidata="Q607610" url="?curid=1269227" title="Heteromyidae">
<text>Heteromyidae is a family of rodents consisting of kangaroo rats, kangaroo mice, pocket mice and spiny pocket mice. Most heteromyids live in complex burrows within the deserts and grasslands of western North America, though species within the genus &quot;Heteromys&quot; are also found in forests and their range extends as far south as northern South America. They feed mostly on seeds and other plant parts, which they carry in their fur-lined cheek pouches to their burrows.

Although they are very different in physical appearance, the closest relatives of the heteromyids are pocket gophers in the family Geomyidae.

==Description==
There are about fifty-nine members of the family Heteromyidae divided among six genera. They are all small rodents, the largest being the giant kangaroo rat (&quot;Dipodomys ingens&quot;) with a body length of and a tail a little longer than this. In many species the tail is tufted and is mainly used for balance. Other adaptations include partially fused vertebrae in the neck, short fore limbs and much enlarged bullae (bubble-shaped bones in the skull). The skulls vary widely across the group but they are all thin and papery and do not have the robust cranial crests and ridges found on the skulls of members of the family Geomyidae. The skull has other peculiarities. There is an extra hole that penetrates the rostrum, distinctive occluded teeth and the masseter muscle, which moves the lower jaw, is set far forward on the snout, an arrangement found in squirrels, beavers, pocket gophers, heteromyids and a few other groups. The dental formula is teeth in total. In the kangaroo rats, the teeth continue to grow all the time, being worn away as the animal chews. The molars have two-lobed cusps. The upper incisors are grooved and the enamel on the molars is quickly worn away by chewing leaving the dentine exposed. In the kangaroo rats they are unrooted but in the pocket mice they have roots.

Fur-lined cheek pouches are a feature across the family Heteromyidae. They have openings near the mouth and extend backwards along the sides of the neck. The fur on the animal&#x27;s body is in general short and fine and often matches in colour the soil of the region in which the animal lives, being some shade of buff, pale brown, reddish-brown or grey. The spiny pocket mice have coarser fur and spiky bristles on the back near the tail.

==Distribution==
Heteromyids are endemic to the western United States, Mexico, Central America and northwestern South America. They are creatures of open country, mostly specialising in prairies, arid lands and desert fringes, but the spiny pocket mice are found in both wet and dry tropical forests in Central and northwestern South America. During the Oligocene, the extent of arid lands across the United States was greater than it is today and these animals occurred more widely. Fossils of kangaroo rats are known from the Pliocene.

==Behaviour==
The kangaroo rats, kangaroo mice and pocket mice are adapted for life in deserts and other arid environments where they largely feed on dry seeds. Kangaroo rats have no need to drink because they are able to extract sufficient water from metabolising their food, obtaining half a gram of water from each gram of seeds eaten. They carry most of the seeds they find back to their burrows in exterior cheek folds lined with fur rather than in cheek pouches inside the mouth as do hamsters. This is because carrying the food in the mouth would involve wetting it and moisture needs to be conserved as much as possible in dry environments. Most species store the seeds they gather in special chambers in the burrow where they absorb moisture from the humid air. Others, such as Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rat, bury them in shallow caches in the open air.

It has been found that there is little hoarding done in the winter but that food is most commonly stored in the autumn and spring. Heteromyids use sight and olfactory clues to locate possible food and then use their fore-feet to manipulate objects. Kangaroo mice make greater use of clumped food where wind or water has concentrated seeds in shallow depressions or around rocks while pocket mice hunt around under vegetation or debris for individual food items. It has been found that pocket mice forage more efficiently than kangaroo rats and this is thought to be due to the fact that they handle their finds more and are better able to distinguish between food and non-food items.

These animals excavate long burrow systems with passages, chambers and multiple entrances. They are largely nocturnal, feeding and moving about at night and resting deep in their burrows during the day. Here it is cooler and more humid which conserves moisture and the animals may temporarily block the entrances to augment this. They are able to concentrate their urine to a viscous consistency which further reduces water loss. Under extreme conditions, some are able to aestivate in chambers under ground.

Kangaroo rats have large hind feet with long metatarsals and no first digits. With these they bound around not using their fore feet at all for locomotion. Pocket mice are smaller and can also move with leaps but they normally run around on four limbs. Members of the genus &quot;Heteromys&quot;, the spiny pocket mice, move around on all fours and do not leap at all.

==Ecology==
Kangaroo rats and pocket mice form a part of the diet of many predatory creatures. They are eaten by foxes, coyotes, snakes and birds. They have acute hearing and can detect the approaching swoop of an owl or the movements of a snake. Many can leap to avoid the predators as they seek the safety of their burrows. The largest kangaroo rats can leap in a single bound.

In the Sonoran Desert there are many closely related species of heteromyid mice and rats. Each has its own niche in the environment which means that they do not unnecessarily compete with each other for the limited available resources. Bailey&#x27;s pocket mouse climbs into plants and bushes in order to find seeds and berries still attached to the plant. It is the only species able to eat the wax found inside the seeds of the jojoba plant. Merriam&#x27;s kangaroo rat primarily moves rapidly from one bush to another gathering seed but overlooking anything lying on the desert floor. The desert pocket mouse forages across the open desert floor and gathers seeds that have fallen to the ground.

Finding that the formerly recognized genus &quot;Liomys&quot; is paraphyletic, they subsumed it into &quot;Heteromys&quot;. Most authorities prior to this (Alexander and Riddle, 2005; Patton, 2005) treated &quot;Liomys&quot; as a separate genus.

<text>The Brocken Transmitter () is a facility for FM- and TV-transmitters on the Brocken, the highest mountain in Northern Germany.

The facility includes two transmission towers. The old tower was built between 1936 and 1937.
It is 53 metres high (including its antenna mast, which no longer exists, it had a height of 95 metres) and has an observation deck, which can be reached by elevator. This tower was intended to be used after 1939 for TV transmissions to central Germany, but due to the beginning of World War II, it was transformed into a radar facility.
Unlike most modern TV towers, the old tower looks like a block of flats with a square cross section. The arrangement of the windows in the observation deck is similar to those in the restaurant in the Radio tower Berlin.

In 1973 a new TV tower was built on Brocken. This 123-metre, freestanding steel-tube tower stands on three legs, which hold shafts for cable and stairways for personnel access.
Above the legs are three decks for directional radio transmission aerials. The new TV tower is not accessible to the public.

While Germany was divided into East and West, the Brocken transmitter was used for TV and FM-transmissions, even though it lay in the restricted area of the east-west frontier (on the Eastern Side). Its location so close to the border enabled it to be received in parts of the West.

In the first half of the 1990s the transmitting aerial of the old tower was removed and replaced by a radome holding air traffic control radar equipment. 
The Brocken Transmitter is property of Deutsche Telekom.

When he first started operating AHAUS, the paperwork fit into a shoebox in his apartment. The need for a national governing body for hockey came from the desire to efficiently manage the growing game of ice hockey, rather than having several different groups which included the Amateur Athletic Union.

In September 1938, Lockhart reached signed an agreement with W. G. Hardy of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) which regulated international games in North America, set out provisions for transfer of players between the organizations, and recognized of each other&#x27;s authority. In 1940, he led AHAUS into a union with the CAHA by establishing the International Ice Hockey Association, and served as its vice-president. AHAUS was admitted as a member of the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace in 1947, being recognized as the international governing body of hockey in the United States instead of the Amateur Athletic Union which was previously recognized by the IIHF.

Lockhart established the first national ice hockey tournaments for pre-high school boys in 1949. He announced the establishment of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame on May 19, 1968, to be located in the town of Eveleth, Minnesota. Lockhart was succeeded as president by William Thayer Tutt in 1972.

===Districts===
USA Hockey has divided its control into geographical youth districts as follows:

;Atlantic
*Eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware
;Central
*Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska

===National Team Development Program===

USA Hockey also operates the National Team Development Program (NTDP), based in Plymouth, Michigan. The program&#x27;s goal is to prepare student-athletes under the age of 18 for participation on U.S. national teams and continued success throughout their future hockey careers. The NTDP consists of two teams; the U.S. National Under-18 Team, and the U.S. National Under-17 Team. The teams compete in the United States Hockey League in addition to playing NCAA colleges and in International competition. Until 2009, the NTDP competed in the North American Hockey League. Numerous NTDP alumni have gone on to play in the NHL. In the 2012–13 season, 60 former NTDP players suited up for NHL teams. In the 2006 NHL Entry Draft, six first-round selections (including no. 1 pick Erik Johnson) were former members of the NTDP. In 2007, four NTDP members were selected in the first round, with Patrick Kane and James van Riemsdyk going 1st and 2nd overall respectively. Through 2013, some 228 NTDP players had been selected in the NHL Entry Draft. The NTDP plays home games at USA Hockey Arena.

<text>Traditional engineering, also known as sequential engineering, is the process of marketing, engineering design, manufacturing, testing and production where each stage of the development process is carried out separately, and the next stage cannot start until the previous stage is finished. Therefore, the information flow is only in one direction, and it is not until the end of the chain that errors, changes and corrections can be relayed to the start of the sequence, causing estimated costs to be under predicted.

This can cause many problems; such as time consumption due to many modifications being made as each stage does not take into account the next. This method is hardly used today, as the concept of concurrent engineering is more efficient.

Traditional engineering is also known as over the wall engineering as each stage blindly throws the development to the next stage over the wall.

==Lean manufacturing==
Traditional manufacturing has been driven by sales forecasts that companies need to produce and stockpile inventory to support. Lean manufacturing is based on the concept that production should be driven by the actual customer demands and requirements. Instead of pushing product to the marketplace, it is pulled through by the customers&#x27; actual needs.

==Sequential engineering stages==
# Research
# Design
# Manufacture
# Quality Control
# Distribution
# Sales

==Disadvantages of sequential engineering==
# This orderly step-by-step process will bring control to complex projects but is very slow.
# In today’s highly competitive market place this can lead to product failures and lost sales.

<doc id="1269246" wikidata="Q2288649" url="?curid=1269246" title="Concurrent engineering">
<text>Concurrent engineering (CE) or concurrent design and manufacturing is a work methodology emphasizing the parallelization of tasks (i.e. performing tasks concurrently), which is sometimes called simultaneous engineering or integrated product development (IPD) using an integrated product team approach. It refers to an approach used in product development in which functions of design engineering, manufacturing engineering, and other functions are integrated to reduce the time required to bring a new product to market.

By completing the design and manufacturing stages at the same time, products are produced in less time while lowering cost. Although concurrent design and manufacturing requires extensive communication and coordination between disciplines, the benefits can increase the profit of a business and lead to a sustainable environment for product development. Concurrent design and manufacturing can lead to a competitive advantage over other businesses as the product may be produced and marketed in less time. However, poorly implemented concurrent engineering can lead to issues.

==Introduction==
The success behind concurrent design and manufacturing lies within completing processes at the same time while involving all disciplines. As product development has become more cost and time efficient over the years, elements of concurrent engineering have been present in product development approaches. The elements of concurrent engineering that were utilized were cross-functional teams as well as fast time-to-market and considering manufacturing processes when designing. By involving multiple disciplines in decision making and planning, concurrent engineering has made product development more cost and time efficient. The fact that concurrent engineering could result in faster time-to-market is already an important advantage in terms of a competitive edge over other producers. Concurrent engineering has provided a structure and concept for product development that can be implemented for future success.

A 2008 publication described concurrent engineering as a new design management system that has matured in recent years to become a well-defined systems approach to optimizing design and engineering cycles. Concurrent engineering has been implemented in a number of companies, organizations, and universities, most notably in the aerospace industry. Beginning in the early 1990s, CE was also adapted for use in the information and content automation field, providing a basis for organization and management of projects outside the physical product development sector for which it was originally designed. Organizations such as the European Space Agency&#x27;s Concurrent Design Facility make use of concurrent design to perform feasibility studies for future missions.

The basic premise for concurrent engineering revolves around two concepts. The first is the idea that all elements of a product&#x27;s life-cycle—from functionality, production, assembly, testing, maintenance, environmental impact, and finally disposal and recycling—should be taken into careful consideration in the early design phases.

The second concept is that design activities should all be occurring at the same time, i.e., concurrently. The idea is that the concurrent nature of these activities significantly increases productivity and product quality. This way, errors and redesigns can be discovered early in the design process when the project is still flexible. By locating and fixing these issues early, the design team can avoid what often become costly errors as the project moves to more complicated computational models and eventually into the actual manufacturing of hardware.

As mentioned above, part of the design process is to ensure that the product&#x27;s entire life cycle is taken into consideration. This includes establishing user requirements, propagating early conceptual designs, running computational models, creating physical prototypes, and eventually manufacturing the product. Included in this process is taking into full account funding, workforce capability, and time requirements. A 2006 study claimed that a correct implementation of the concurrent design process can save a significant amount of money, and that organizations have been moving to concurrent design for this reason. It is also highly compatible with systems thinking and green engineering.

Concurrent engineering replaces the more traditional sequential design flow, or &quot;Waterfall Model&quot;. In Concurrent Engineering an iterative or integrated development method is used instead. The Waterfall method moves in a linear fashion, starting with user requirements and sequentially moving forward to design and implementation, until you have a finished product. In this design system, a design team would not quickly look backward or forward from the step it is on to fix or anticipate problems. In the case that something does go wrong, the design usually must be scrapped or heavily altered. The concurrent or iterative design process encourages prompt changes of tack, so that all aspects of the life cycle of the product are taken into account, allowing for a more evolutionary approach to design. The difference between the two design processes can be seen graphically in Figure 1.
 
A significant part of the concurrent design method is that the individual engineer is given much more say in the overall design process due to the collaborative nature of concurrent engineering. Giving the designer ownership is claimed to improve the productivity of the employee and quality of the product, based on the assumption that people who are given a sense of gratification and ownership over their work tend to work harder and design a more robust product, as opposed to an employee that is assigned a task with little say in the general process.

===Challenges associated with concurrent design===
Concurrent design comes with a series of challenges, such as implementation of early design reviews, dependency on efficient communication between engineers and teams, software compatibility, and opening up the design process. This design process usually requires that computer models (computer aided design, finite element analysis) are exchanged efficiently, something that can be difficult in practice. If such issues are not addressed properly, concurrent design may not work effectively. It is important to note that although the nature of some project activities imposes a degree of linearity—completion of software code, prototype development and testing, for example—organizing and managing project teams to facilitate concurrent design can still yield significant benefits that come from the improved sharing of information.

Service providers exist that specialize in this field, not only training people how to perform concurrent design effectively, but also providing the tools to enhance the communication between the team members.

==Elements==

===Cross-functional teams===
Cross-functional teams include people from different area of the workplace that are all involved in a particular process, including manufacturing, hardware and software design, marketing, and so forth.

===Concurrent product realization===
Doing several things at once, such as designing various subsystems simultaneously, is critical to reducing design time and is at the heart of concurrent engineering.

===Incremental information sharing===
Incremental information sharing helps minimize the chance that concurrent product realization will lead to surprises. &quot;Incremental&quot; meaning that as soon as new information becomes available, it is shared and integrated into the design. Cross-functional teams are important to the effective sharing of information in a timely fashion.

===Integrated project management===
Integrated project management ensures that someone is responsible for the entire project, and that responsibility is not handed-off once one aspect of the work is done.

==Definition==
Several definitions of concurrent engineering are in use.

The first one is used by the Concurrent Design Facility (ESA):&lt;br&gt;
The second one is by Winner, et al., 1988:&lt;br&gt;
== Concurrent vs sequential engineering ==
Concurrent and Sequential engineering cover the same stages of design and manufacturing, however, the two approaches vary widely in terms of productivity, cost, development and efficiency. The &#x27;Sequential Engineering vs Concurrent Design and Manufacturing&#x27; figure shows sequential engineering on the left and concurrent design and manufacturing on the right. As seen in the figure, sequential engineering begins with customer requirements and then progresses to design, implementation, verification and maintenance. The approach for sequential engineering results in large amounts of time devoted to product development. Due to large amounts of time allocated towards all stages of product development, sequential engineering is associated with high cost and is less efficient as products can not be made quickly. Concurrent engineering, on the other hand, allows for all stages of product development to occur essentially at the same time. As seen in the &#x27;Sequential Engineering vs Concurrent Design and Manufacturing&#x27; figure, initial planning is the only requirement before the process can occur including planning design, implementation, testing and evaluation. The concurrent design and manufacturing approach allows for shortening of product development time, higher efficiency in developing and producing parts earlier and lower production costs.

Concurrent and Sequential Engineering may also be compared using a relay race analogy. Sequential engineering is compared to the standard approach of running a relay race, where each runner must run a set distance and then pass the baton to the next runner and so on until the race is completed. Concurrent engineering is compared to running a relay race where two runners will run at the same time during certain points of the race. In the analogy, each runner will cover the same set distance as the sequential approach but the time to complete the race using the concurrent approach is significantly less. When thinking of the various runners in the relay race as stages in product development, the correlation between the two approaches in the relay race to the same approaches in engineering is vastly similar. Although there are more complex and numerous processes involved in product development, the concept that the analogy provides is enough to understand the benefits that come with concurrent design and manufacturing.

== Business benefits ==
Using concurrent engineering, businesses can cut down on the time it takes to go from idea to product. The time savings come from designing with all the steps of the process in mind, eliminating any potential changes that have to be made to a design after a part has gone all the way to production before realizing that it is difficult or impossible to machine. Reducing or eliminating these extra steps means the product will be completed sooner and with less wasted material in the process. During the design and prototyping process, potential issues in the design can be corrected earlier in the product development stages to further reduce the production time frame.

The benefits of concurrent design and manufacturing can be sorted in to short term and long term.

=== Short term benefits ===

* Competitive advantage with implementing part into market quickly
* Large amounts of same part produced in a shorter amount of time 
* Allows for early correction of part
* Less material wasted 
* Less time spent on multiple iterations of essentially the same part

=== Long term benefits ===

* More cost efficient over several parts produced and several years
* Large amounts of different parts produced in a shorter total amount of time
* Better communication between disciplines in company
* Ability to leverage teamwork and make informed decisions

<text>Clinton Earl Portis (born September 1, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes. He was selected by the Denver Broncos in the second round of the 2002 NFL draft. Portis was best known for being the starting running back for the Washington Redskins for seven seasons, in which he gained an average of 81.2 yards rushing per game, for which a select panel of celebrities included him as one of the 80 Greatest Redskins.

==College career==

Portis attended the University of Miami, where he played for the Hurricanes. He considered going to the University of South Carolina but a fight that he had at Gainesville High School resulted in his scholarship being taken away. He became just the second true freshman to start at running back since the 1975 season. Portis set a school freshman record with five 100-yard performances, and led the team with 838 yards and eight touchdowns on 143 carries (5.9 avg.) in 10 games. He also caught four passes for 44 yards (11.0 avg.) and 2 touchdowns. When Portis was still a relative unknown, Lee Corso singled out Portis&#x27;s performance during a defeat by Florida State for hustling and never giving up, saying &quot;that kid can play for me any time&quot;.

Portis&#x27; sophomore season was not as successful as he lost his job to James Jackson and rushed for 485 yards and two touchdowns on 77 carries (6.3 avg.) in eight games. He also added 103 yards on five receptions (20.6 avg.).

However, Portis bounced back in 2001 as the Hurricanes won the National Championship and Portis had his best season rushing for 1,200 yards and 10 touchdowns on 220 carries (5.5 avg.). He also added 125 receiving yards. In the Rose Bowl against Nebraska, Portis ran for 104 yards and a touchdown. He also had a long touchdown reception called back on a holding call.

Clinton was inducted into the UM Sports Hall of Fame on April 10, 2014, at a ceremony in Miami.

===Track and field===
Portis was also a standout track athlete for the Gainesville High School track team. He was timed at 10.6 seconds in the 100 meters. He was member of the varsity track team. He took part in the state record 4 x 100 meter relay team, that finished with a time of 40.8 seconds. He also posted a personal bests of 2.01 meters in the high jump, and 6.91 meters in the long jump.

He also ran track and field for the University of Miami, where he won the state championship in the 4x400-meter relay. He also recorded personal best of 6.93 seconds in the 60 meters and 21.82 seconds in the 200 meters.

==Professional career==

===Denver Broncos===
Portis was drafted by the Denver Broncos with the 51st overall pick in the second round of the 2002 NFL draft.

Portis rushed for over 1,500 yards in each of his first two seasons with the Broncos, averaging 5.5 yards per carry in that span. The latter is an NFL record for a running back&#x27;s first two seasons. On December 15, 2002, Portis became the youngest player (21 years, 105 days) to score 4 touchdowns in a game in a 31–24 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. The very next season on December 7, 2003, Portis became the youngest player (22 years, 97 days) to score 5 touchdowns in a game in a 45–27 victory, which also happened against Kansas City.

&#x27;s NFL off-season, Clinton Portis held at least 18 Broncos franchise records, including:
* Rush Yards: rookie season (1,508 in 2002)
* Rush Yds/Att: career (5.5), season (5.52 in 2002), game (9.91 on 2003-12-07 KAN), rookie season (5.52 in 2002), rookie game (9.5 on 2002-12-29 ARI)
* Rushing TDs: game (5 on 2003-12-07 KAN), rookie season (15 in 2002)
* Rush Yds/Game: career (106.9)
* Total TDs: game (5 on 2003-12-07 KAN), rookie season (17 in 2002), rookie game (4 on 2002-12-15 KAN; with Mike Anderson)
* Yards from Scrimmage: rookie season (1,872 in 2002)
* All Purpose Yards: rookie season (1,872 in 2002)
* 100+ yard rushing games: rookie season (8)
* Games with 1+ TD scored: rookie season (10)
* Games with 2+ TD scored: rookie season (5; with Mike Anderson)
* Games with 3+ TD scored: rookie season (1; with Jon Keyworth, Terrell Davis and Mike Anderson)

===Trade===
Before the 2004 season, the Broncos traded Portis to the Washington Redskins for cornerback Champ Bailey and a second-round draft pick in the 2004 NFL draft which the Broncos used to select Tatum Bell (and Bell wore Portis&#x27;s number 26 in Denver). Washington signed Portis to an eight-year contract worth $50.5 million. At that time, there were criticisms regarding the trade, namely that shut-down corners like Bailey were hard to come by and that adding a second-round pick for Portis was too much and one-sided. Critics also felt that Portis was simply a product of the Broncos&#x27; O-line scheme, and would not have much success in Washington, which was usually suited to more physical, power runners (such as Stephen Davis or John Riggins).

===Washington Redskins===
====2004====
 He finished 2004 with 1,315 yards for a 3.8 yard rushing average. He had an especially tough time finding the end zone, finishing with eight total touchdowns (5 rushing, 2 receiving, and one passing).

====2005====
Portis bounced back in the 2005 season. Although he did not get into the end zone until the fifth game of the season, he finished strong and had 12 total touchdowns (11 rushing and one passing). On a 14-yard run against the Philadelphia Eagles on January 1, 2006, he broke the Redskins&#x27; franchise record for the most rushing yards in a season with 1,516 yards and tied the most 100+ yard games in a season (5). He ended the game with 112 rushing yards. 

====2006====
There was no immediate indication from the Redskins as to when Portis might return to active playing status. However, he returned early into Washington&#x27; game against the Minnesota Vikings, where he gained 39 yards on 10 carries with one touchdown. The Washington Redskins lost 16–19, the clock expiring as Washington kicker John Hall missed wide left on a field goal. Portis rebounded in following weeks with 16 carries for 86 yards and 2 touchdowns against the Houston Texans, and 27 carries for 112 yards and a touchdown against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Nagged by injuries all season, Portis suffered another setback in the first quarter of Washington&#x27;s November 12 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Portis left the game with a hand injury and was replaced by backup Ladell Betts. X-rays revealed that Portis broke his right hand during the game. He was operated on and placed on the Redskins&#x27; Injured Reserve list three days later, on November 15.

====2007====

Washington agreed to guarantee Portis&#x27; 2008–2009 and a large portion of his 2010 base salaries in March. This would equal up to $15 million in guarantees. Portis, also got a $9.32 million &quot;signing bonus&quot; upon restructuring. He would finish the 2007 season with 1,262 yards rushing and 11 rushing touchdowns along with 389 yards receiving.

====2008====
In 2008, Portis fell just short of what would have been his fourth 1500 yard rushing season in seven years, finishing with 1487 yards and an average of 4.3 yards per carry. His season was highlighted by a five-week stretch in which Portis gained nearly 700 yards, ending in an October 26 victory over the Detroit Lions. During this span Clinton Portis joined O.J. Simpson as the only players in NFL history to rush for at least 120 yards in five consecutive games twice in a career (Portis first did it over two seasons with four games with Denver in 2003 and one game with Washington in 2004). Portis led the NFL in rushing as late as November 23 before nagging injuries and limited playing time slowed him down; he gained only 281 yards in his final five games as Washington lost four of five to miss the playoffs. Despite this, he was selected to the Pro Bowl over DeAngelo Williams, despite Williams having better stats at the end of the season.

Some controversy was caused on December 9, 2008, when Clinton Portis made negative statements about Washington coach Jim Zorn in his weekly appearance on WTEM-AM radio, criticizing Zorn for giving inconsistent messages and sarcastically calling him a &quot;genius.&quot; Portis was still smarting from his lack of playing time in Sunday&#x27;s 24–10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, when he was removed from the game after the first series of the second half.
 In the offseason, Portis stated that he tried to forge a better relationship with Zorn, but admitted that he did not have the rapport that he shared with former head coach Joe Gibbs, which he classified as a &quot;great relationship,&quot; and stated that Gibbs was &quot;one of the best men as far as guidance, or the way he lives his life, an example of a true champion.&quot;

====2009====
During a Week 9 game versus the Atlanta Falcons, Portis suffered a concussion. The hit caused Portis to lose consciousness and leave the game. Portis missed four consecutive games with concussion-like symptoms. Portis went to see a specialist in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on December 1, 2009. It was reported that on December 8, Portis was officially placed on injured reserve. It took four months for him to gain clearance to play again.

====2010====
The start of the 2010 season saw the reunion of Portis and newly appointed coach, Mike Shanahan, Portis&#x27; former coach from his first two career seasons with the Denver Broncos. Despite a positive outlook with a new coaching staff, injuries continued to plague Portis as he had to deal with abdomen and groin injuries. During his seventh year as a Redskin, Portis played only five games and tallied only 227 yards rushing throughout the season, which included two touchdowns. Both touchdowns were scored in the September 19 home game versus the Houston Texans.

On February 28, 2011, Portis was released by the Washington Redskins after failed contract re-negotiations and repeated injuries. Following his release, Portis felt that passion had been missing from the team since Gibbs retired, saying, &quot;I never seen nobody give up or with their head down with Coach Gibbs. As many close games as we played...you can&#x27;t say one time that we gave up. There was a passion and toughness amongst everybody on that field to fight until time expired.&quot;

===Retirement===
On August 21, 2012, Portis announced his retirement, cementing his status as 27th all-time in career rushing yards. He officially retired on August 23 and during the press conference it was announced that he made it into the list of the 80 Greatest Redskins of All-Time. After retirement, Portis admitted to have suffered 10 concussions. In 2013, Portis joined former players such as Daunte Culpepper, Cadillac Williams and Art Monk in a civil lawsuit against NFL over concussion and head injuries.

==NFL career statistics==

===Regular Season===

==In popular culture==
During his career with the Washington Redskins, Portis made several appearances in TV commercials for Easterns Automotive Group, a local car dealership group on the DC and Baltimore areas, alongside Jason Campbell, Antwaan Randle El and Chris Cooley.

==Personal life==
Portis is the cousin of former Washington Valor quarterback Josh Portis.

Portis has two daughters.

Due to mismanagement by his financial advisors that caused him to lose multiple homes, Portis filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2015, and as of 2017 lived in a two-bedroom apartment in Northern Virginia. In a 2017 interview with Sports Illustrated, Portis admitted that he contemplated murdering his former advisors.

===Criminal fraud===
In December 2019, Portis was named as one of 12 former NFL players accused of defrauding the league&#x27;s health program by filing a total of $3.9 million in false claims. He was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and health care fraud, one count of wire fraud, and one count of health care fraud by the United States Department of Justice. He pleaded not guilty to the charges in February 2020. He was indicted on the same charges in a superseding case on July 24, 2020. In September 2021, the Department of Justice announced that Portis had pleaded guilty to obtaining $99,264 in benefits for medical equipment that was not actually provided. He was sentenced on January 6, 2022, to six months in prison and an additional six months of home confinement beginning in March 2022.

=== Controversial views ===
In May 2007, during the ongoing investigations into the dog-fighting crimes of former NFL player Michael Vick, Portis defended Vick, saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t know if he was fighting dogs or not. But it’s his property; it’s his dogs. If that’s what he wants to do, do it.&quot; When told that dog fighting was a felony, Portis replied, &quot;It can&#x27;t be too bad of a crime.&quot; Portis said that he thought dog fighting was a “prevalent” part of life, adding: &quot;I know a lot of back roads that got a dog fight if you want to go see it. But they’re not bothering those people because those people are not big names.&quot; That same day, he later released a statement through the Redskins&#x27; official website that claimed he did not take part in, nor condone, dog fighting.

<doc id="1269252" wikidata="Q2473200" url="?curid=1269252" title="Offside (ice hockey)">
<text>In ice hockey, a play is offside if a player on the attacking team does not control the puck and is in the attacking or offensive zone when a different attacking player causes the puck to enter the offensive zone, until either the puck or all attacking players leave the offensive zone. Simply put, the puck must enter the attacking zone before attacking players. If a player on the attacking team is in the offensive zone when the puck enters, either an immediate offside occurs, or they must retreat to the neutral zone.

For determining offside, the position of the puck and players must be considered to be in the neutral or offensive zone. Usually, the puck enters or leaves the offensive zone when it completely crosses the blue line. A player is in the neutral zone if either skate is in the neutral zone or touches the imaginary plane extending upwards from the leading edge of the blue line; otherwise, he is in the offensive zone.

When an offside violation occurs, a linesman will stop play. To restart play, a faceoff is then held at the ice spot closest to the infraction, usually a neutral spot, or if there is a delayed penalty, at a spot in the defending zone of the defending team, which incurred the penalty. Even if the linesman erred in calling offside, the faceoff will still occur.

==Rules==
===Delayed offside rule===

Under the &quot;delayed offside rule&quot;, an infraction occurs when a play is offside and any attacking player touches the puck or checks a player in the offensive zone. For example, under NHL&#x27;s delayed offside rule, play is stopped immediately when an attacking player carries the puck into the zone while a teammate is already in the attacking zone, or when an attacking player in the neutral zone completes a pass to a teammate who is already in the attacking zone. A &quot;delayed offside&quot; occurs when a player on the attacking team is in the offensive zone before the puck and the attacking team causes the puck to enter the zone without the attacking team having possession. When a delayed offside occurs, a linesman will keep an arm up to signal it, and all attacking players must retreat back into the neutral zone without touching the puck or checking an opponent for the delayed offside to end. If an attacking player touches the puck during the delayed offside, play is stopped.

The National Hockey League (NHL) and International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) apply similar rules for determining offside. A player is judged to be offside if both of their skates completely cross the blue line dividing their offensive zone from the neutral zone before the puck completely crosses the same line. In both organizations, it is the position of a player&#x27;s skates that are important. They cannot use their stick or other part of their body to remain onside. The lone exception to this rule is that an attacking player&#x27;s skates may precede the puck into the attacking zone when they are skating backwards if they are in control of the puck. The position of the puck is used for determining offside. Offside is determined by the skate positions when the puck completely crosses the blue line. If the puck was in the attacking zone, touches the blue line, and then completely leaves the blue line back into the attacking zone, the puck is considered to have been in the attacking zone the entire time, so there is no determination of offside, and the puck did not completely cross the blue line.

If any individual player is in an offside position, their entire team is offside. A &quot;delayed offside&quot; occurs if the puck is passed or shot into the offensive zone while an attacking player is offside but has not been touched by a member of the attacking team. In most leagues, the attacking team may &quot;tag up&quot; by having all players exit the offensive zone. At that point the offside is waved off and they may re-enter the offensive zone in pursuit of the puck. If a member of the attacking team has control of the puck while offside, a linesman will stop play and a faceoff will be held at the faceoff spot nearest the point of the infraction. Typically, this means the spot closest to the blue line if the puck is carried into the zone, or in the case of a pass, the spot closest to where the pass originated. If a linesman judges that the attacking team acted to force a deliberate stoppage in play by going offside, they can move the faceoff into that team&#x27;s defensive zone.

If a goal is scored from a shot (at the neutral or defensive zone) that creates a delayed offside, the goal will be denied, even if the attacking team clears the offensive zone before the puck enters the goal.

===Immediate offside rule===
Under the &quot;immediate offside rule&quot;, an infraction occurs and play is stopped as soon as a play is offside, even if the attacking team does not control the puck. Some levels of hockey use this rule, such as younger divisions of minor hockey sanctioned by USA Hockey.

===Exceptions===
Under both NHL and IIHF (Rules 83.1 and 83.2) rules, there are two conditions under which an offside can be waved off even with players in the attacking zone ahead of the puck.
# A defending player has legally carried the puck out of their own zone, and then passes the puck back into their own zone only for the puck to be intercepted by an attacking player.
# A defending player clears the puck out of their own zone, but the puck then bounces off another defending player in neutral ice back into their own zone.

During a faceoff, a player may be judged to be in an offside position if they are lined up within 15 feet of the centres before the puck is dropped. This may result in a faceoff violation, at which point the official dropping the puck will wave the centre out of the faceoff spot and require that another player take their place. If one team commits two violations during the same attempt to restart play, it will be assessed a minor penalty for delay of game.

==Offside pass==

An &quot;offside pass&quot; occurs when a pass from inside a team&#x27;s defending zone crosses the red line. When such a pass occurs, play is stopped and a faceoff is conducted in the defending zone of the team that committed the infraction.

There are two determining factors in an offside pass violation:
# &quot;Puck position when pass is released.&quot; Since the blue line is considered part of the zone the puck is in, if the puck is behind or in contact with the blue line when the pass is released, the pass may be an offside pass.
# &quot;Skate position of the receiver.&quot; If the receiver has skate contact with the red line at the instant the puck completely crosses it, the pass is legal regardless of where the puck actually makes contact with their stick. Both of their skates must be completely on the far side of the red line when the puck crosses the red line into the attacking zone to be governed by the aforementioned offside rule.

This offside pass rule is not observed by all leagues. For instance, it was abolished by the IIHF, and its member countries&#x27; leagues (except the NHL) in 1998. The National Hockey League adopted the version used by the top minor leagues, under the terms of their 2005 Collective Bargaining Agreement, in which the centre line is no longer used to determine an offside pass. This was one of many rule changes intended to open up the game and improve scoring chances.

==History==
In the sport&#x27;s earliest history, hockey was played similar to rugby, in which forward passing is not allowed. Also, hockey&#x27;s offside infraction was influenced by the offside penalty from soccer. A legal pass could be made only to a teammate who is in an &quot;onside&quot; position behind the puck, thus forcing players to skate with the puck to move it forward. Therefore, a player cannot simply &quot;stake out&quot; in the offensive zone, receive a pass from a teammate in the neutral or defensive zones, then skate in and try to score on the opponent&#x27;s goal. 

In the event of an offside pass, the play was stopped and a faceoff conducted from the point of the infraction, regardless of where it occurred. The first significant relaxation of this rule occurred in 1905, when the Ontario Hockey Association began to allow defensive players to play the puck within three feet of their goal if the puck rebounded off the goaltender. In some cases, a black line was painted onto the ice surface at that three foot mark, which served as an early precursor to the modern blue lines.

Forward passing within the neutral and defensive zones was first allowed in the NHL in 1927, but after a season of extremely low scoring in 1928–29, the league first allowed forward passing in all zones. The result was immediate and dramatic as the number of goals scored per game more than doubled immediately. Under the NHL&#x27;s new rule, there were no restrictions placed on where a player could be relative to the puck, resulting in players standing deep in their offensive zone while waiting for teammates to bring the puck forward. As a result, the NHL introduced the modern offside rule on December 16, 1929, effective six days later.

The rink was divided into three zones by two blue lines as of the 1928–29 season, and the centre line did not yet exist. Teams were allowed a forward pass in any of the zones, but the puck must be carried over a blue line by a skater. Frank Boucher and Cecil Duncan introduced the centre red line in the 1943–44 season, in an effort to open up the game by reducing the number of offside infractions and create excitement with quicker counter-attacks. The change allowed the defending team to pass the puck to out of their own zone up to the red line, instead of being required to skate over the nearest blue line then pass the puck forward.

In the late 2010s, there were many goals being reviewed, due to a new Offside review system. There were complaints about how it affected the flow of the game. It is ruled differently now, where a team may request a review after a goal is scored during a play that team considers to be offside. If is ruled not offside, the goal counts and the team requesting the review is assessed a minor penalty.

<text>Anton Ritter von Schmerling (23 August 180523 May 1893) was an Austrian statesman.

==Life==
Von Schmerling was born in Vienna, where his father held a high position on the judicial side of the civil service.

After studying law at Vienna, in 1829 Schmerling entered the public service, and during the next eighteen years was constantly occupied, chiefly in Lower Austria. In 1847, as a member of the lesser nobility, he entered the Estates of Lower Austria and took an active part in the Liberal movement for administrative and constitutional reform of which they were the center. On the outbreak of the revolution in Vienna in March 1848, when the mob broke into the Assembly, Schmerling was one of the deputation which carried to the palace the demands of the people, and during the next few days he was much occupied in organizing the newly formed National Guard. At the end of the month he was sent by the ministry to Frankfurt as one of the men of public confidence.

He soon succeeded Count Colloredo as president of the Confederate Diet, and in this capacity officially transferred to Archduke John of Austria, who had been elected regent of Germany, the powers of the Diet on 12 July 1848. For this he was violently attacked in the National Assembly by the extreme Radicals; but on this and other occasions (he had himself been elected to the National Assembly) he defended himself effectively because he depended not on eloquence but on a recognition of what has been called the irony of facts to which the parliament as a whole was so blind.

Schmerling was the first and the most influential member of the ministry which the Regent formed; from 15 July he held the ministry of the interior and foreign affairs, and it was almost entirely due to him that, at least for while, this phantom government maintained some appearance of power and dignity.

With the resignation of Prince Carl zu Leiningen on 5 September 1848, the Regent requested Schmerling to form a new ministry after Frederick Dahlmann had failed to do so. A defeat in the parliament when he defended the Armistice of Malmö led to his resignation; but he was immediately called to office again, with practically dictatorial power, in order to quell the revolt which broke out in Frankfurt on 18 September. His courage and resolution averted what nearly became a terrible catastrophe. It was his hope to establish in Germany the supremacy of a Liberal and reformed Austria. This brought him into opposition to the party of Prussian supremacy; and when they attained a majority, he resigned, and was succeeded by Heinrich von Gagern. He remained at Frankfurt, holding the post of Austrian envoy, and was the leader of the (the party supporting the idea of Greater Germania) until the dissolution of the Kremsier Parliament showed that the forces of reaction had conquered at Vienna and shattered all hopes of Austria attaining the position he had hoped for her.

After the abortive election of King Frederick William IV of Prussia to be emperor, he, with the other Austrians, were ordered to leave Frankfurt by the Austrian government on 5 April 1849. On his return to Vienna he became minister of justice, and the reforms which he carried out added to his reputation. His popularity among all Liberals was increased by his resignation in 1851, as a protest against the failure of the government to establish the constitution they had promised. During the-next few years he was judge of the supreme court of appeal. When his forecast was fulfilled, and the system of absolutism broke down, he became minister in January 1862.

His first act was the publication of the constitution by which the whole of the empire was to be organized as a single state with a parliamentary government. The experiment failed, chiefly because of the opposition of the Croatians and Magyars, whom he bitterly offended by his celebrated saying that Hungary could wait. Faults of manner, natural in a man whose life had been spent as an official and a judge, prevented him from keeping together the German Liberals as a strong and united party; he was opposed by a powerful faction at court, and by the Clerical leaders. After the first few months, Emperor Franz Joseph I gave him only a very lukewarm support; and with his retirement in 1865 the attempt to carry out the ideals of Joseph II to Germanize while he liberalized the whole of the empire, and to compel Hungarians, Poles, Czechs and Croatians to accept a system in which the government of the whole should be carried on by a German-speaking parliament and bureaucracy, failed. The constitution of 1862, though suspended on Schmerling&#x27;s fall, was still regarded as legally valid for the Cisleithanian territories.

On his retirement he returned to his judicial duties; in 1867 he was made life-member of the Upper House (&quot;Herrenhaus&quot;) in the Reichsrat, of which he became vice-president, and in 1871 president. This post he laid down in 1879, and came forward as leader of the Liberal German opposition to the administration of Count Taaffe. In 1891 he retired from public life, and died at Vienna on 23 May 1893.

In 1835 Schmerling married Pauline von Koudelka, a daughter of field marshal lieutenant Freiherr von Koudelka. She was distinguished by her literary and artistic abilities, at that time rare in the Austrian capital, but she died young in 1840, leaving two daughters.

<text>Keith J. Bulluck (born April 4, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker for eleven seasons in the National Football League (NFL). After playing college football for the Syracuse Orange, he was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the first round in the 2000 NFL draft. He had a ten-year career with the Titans, which included a Pro Bowl selection in 2003. He played for the New York Giants in 2010.

==Early life==
At Clarkstown High School North in New City, New York, Bulluck was named first-team All County, first-team All-State, Blue-Chip All-American, and both Prep Football Report and Super Prep All-Northeast. Like many children in the New York metropolitan area in the 1980s and early 1990s, he idolized Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor while growing up. He was also an All-County in basketball as a junior. On April 27, 2009, Bulluck&#x27;s high school jersey, #1, was retired in a ceremony held at the high school. He also has a name plaque at Clarkstown High School North hung up on the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;.

==College career==
Bulluck attended Syracuse University, where he played for the Syracuse Orange football team from 1996 to 1999. He played strong safety, outside linebacker and middle linebacker. As a senior in 1999 he led the Big East in tackles with 138 and received the Bill Horr Award, which is given to Syracuse&#x27;s most valuable player. He finished his career with 375 tackles, six quarterback sacks, three interceptions, three forced fumbles and six fumble recoveries.

==Professional career==
===Tennessee Titans===
The Tennessee Titans selected Bulluck in the first round (30th overall) of the 2000 NFL draft. Bulluck was the fifth linebacker drafted in 2000 and was one of four Pro Bowl linebackers selected in the first round of the 2000 NFL Draft. The first round also included Pro Bowl linebackers LaVar Arrington (2nd overall), Brian Urlacher (9th overall), and Julian Peterson (16th overall).

On July 1, 2000, the Tennessee Titans signed Bulluck to a four-year, $5.56 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $1.92 million.

After spending his first two seasons as a backup and special teamer, he became a starter in 2002. After becoming a starter he made a Pro Bowl in 2003 and has led the Titans in tackles five times. In 2004, he led the NFL in tackles with 152. In 2007, he recorded a Titans-record five interceptions for a linebacker.

===New York Giants===
On July 24, 2010, after a private workout with the team, he signed a one-year, $2.5 million contract with the Giants. He became an unrestricted free agent following the season.

===Retirement===
Bulluck did not play in the 2011 season after no teams signed him. After having the year off, he announced his retirement on January 25, 2012. On August 3, 2012, Bulluck formally retired from the National Football League with the team who drafted him, the Tennessee Titans. He became the first player in Titans franchise history to formally retire from their organization.

Bulluck joined the Titans broadcast team in Summer 2013. On August 25, 2013, Bulluck was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee, for allegedly robbing a taxi driver, although the claims by the taxi driver are disputed. On September 13, 2013, charges were dropped.

==NFL career statistics==
== Curling ==
Since retirement from professional football, Keith has picked up the sport of curling. In March 2018 Jared Allen formed a team of all retired NFL players, consisting of Bulluck, Marc Bulger and Michael Roos with the goal of representing the United States at the 2022 Winter Olympics. They have since played together in the 2019 USA Men&#x27;s Challenge Round (qualification event for the United States Men&#x27;s Curling Championship) and Ed Werenich Golden Wrench Classic (a World Curling Tour event), going winless in both events.

== The Outside Game ==
In 2019 Bulluck partnered with the founders of the then 10-year-old conference series and sports media outlet &quot;Blogs With Balls&quot; to rebrand and relaunch under the umbrella &quot;The Outside Game.&quot; Bulluck said in an announcement &quot;The Outside Game was built to provide avenues that amplify conversation among athletes, creators, media, business, and marketers in an unfiltered and unbiased manner, just as BWB has for the past decade. The Outside Game gives athletes and contributors a real opportunity to address issues not exclusive to sport, and with a genuine voice and point of view rather than through the lens of corporate PR avenues.&quot; The first event under the rebrand was held September 5, 2019, at SubCulture in New York City and featured conversations with athletes PacMan Jones, Robin Lehner, Joanna Lohman, Alex Cavallini, and Jonathan Casillas, and media figures such as Greg Mescall, Erin Ashley Simon, Jeff Eisenband, Bleacher Report&#x27;s Ben Osborne, and more.

In addition to the events, Bulluck co-hosts The Outside Game Podcast which is a mix of conversation and interviews with individuals from across sports and culture.

==Just Love Cafe==
In 2020, Bulluck opened Just Love Coffee Cafe in Franklin,Tennessee. He aims to help under-privileged and poor youth. He has partnered with the Big Brothers Big Sister of Middle Tennessee non-profit organization on multiple occasions, mentoring youth in the art of responsibility, life choices, and of course sports.

<text>Karl von Schmidt (January 12, 1817 – August 25, 1875) was a Prussian cavalry general.

== Life ==
Schmidt was born at Schwedt on the Oder in the Province of Brandenburg, and entered the 4th Ulans as a second lieutenant in 1834.

Schmidt&#x27;s long regimental service was varied by staff service and instructional work, and in the mobilization of 1859 he had the command of a &quot;landwehr&quot; cavalry regiment. In 1863 he was made colonel of the 4th Cuirassiers, which he commanded in the, for the cavalry arm, uneventful campaigns in the Second Schleswig War of 1864 and the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. He then commanded a newly raised regiment of Schleswig-Holstein troops, the 16th Hussars, but at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War he was still an obscure and perhaps a mistrusted officer, though his grasp of every detail of cavalry work was acknowledged. But an opportunity for distinction was grasped in the cavalry fighting around Mars-la-Tour (August 16), in which he temporarily led a brigade and was severely wounded. He was soon promoted major-general and succeeded to the temporary command of his division on the disablement of its leader.

In this post Schmidt did brilliant work in the campaign on the Loire, and even in the winter operations towards Le Mans, and earned a reputation second to none amongst the officers and men of his arm. After the war he took a leading part in the reorganization of the Prussian cavalry, which in ten years raised its efficiency to a point far beyond that of any other cavalry in Europe. In 1875, though his health was failing, he refused to give up the conduct of certain important cavalry manoeuvres with which he had been entrusted. But a few days of heavy work in the field brought on a fatal illness, and he died at Danzig on the 25 August 1875. In 1889 the 4th Ulans, in which his regimental service was almost entirely spent, were given the name &quot;von Schmidt&quot;.

Schmidt&#x27;s drill and manoeuvre instructions were codified and published after his death by his staff officer, Captain von Vollard Bockelberg, who was authorized by Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia to do so. An English translation, &quot;Instructions for Cavalry&quot;, was published by the War Office. Schmidt himself wrote a pamphlet, &quot;Auch ein Wunder die Ausbildung der Cavallerie&quot; (1862). The original German edition of the &quot;Instructions for Cavalry&quot; is prefaced by a memoir of Schmidt&#x27;s life and services, written by Major Kaehler.

<text>Keith Joseph Bullock FTSE (1931–2015) was an Australian engineer and academic at the University of Queensland.

== Early life ==
Bullock was born in Brisbane, Queensland in 1931. He attended Moorooka State School and the Church of England Grammar School. Bullock enrolled in the engineering program at the University of Queensland in 1948, gaining his B.E. with first class honours in 1952. He won a number of prizes and the Alfred Henry Darker scholarship.

== Career ==
Bullock was employed as a demonstrator after graduation. He commenced his PhD under supervisor Professor Mansergh Shaw. Bullock graduated with his PhD in 1957, the first engineering student to complete a PhD at the University of Queensland. His thesis studied the physical properties and milling of sugar cane with an aim to improve the costs and efficiency of machinery within sugar mills, particularly in Australia. His research was enabled by grants from the Colonial Sugar Refining Company and the Sugar Research Institute, and led to improvements in milling processes.

Bullock married physiotherapist and fellow UQ graduate Margaret Roberts in 1957 and they moved to Boston, USA to take up a Fulbright Fellowship he was offered at Harvard University. He would pursue research there in addition to teaching graduate classes. Bullock continued his association with Harvard University as a guest lecturer. Bullock and his family returned to Australia in 1960, where he took a position as a lecturer at the University of Queensland in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.

Bullock pursued research in a number of areas including hybrid and electric transmissions for cars and heavy duty road vehicles to reduce fuel usage and emissions. In the 1970s he pioneered research into hybrid vehicles, converting a Ford Falcon to run on a small internal combustion engine with battery and flywheel energy storage, with Dr Duncan Gilmore. He and Dr Frank Grigg, worked on a re-design of power trains used in underground load haul dump vehicles. He produced designs for submarines, buses and freight train locomotives. He developed a number of power system design improvements.

Bullock became Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering in 1975, and became Dean of Engineering in 1983. He encouraged the relocation of research into hypersonic test facilities to Queensland.

Bullock retired from the university in 1991 and continued in private work for Transport Energy Systems, a company which he established the same year.

Bullock died in 2015, and was survived by his wife Margaret and their two children.

<doc id="1269274" wikidata="Q225273" url="?curid=1269274" title="1994–95 FA Premier League">
<text>The 1994–95 FA Premier League (known as the FA [[Carling Brewery|Carling]] Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the third season of the competition, since its formation in 1992 as the top division of professional football in England. Due to the decision to reduce the number of clubs in the FA Premier League from 22 to 20 starting from the following season, a total of four clubs were to be relegated.

==Overview==
===Transfers===
Just before the start of the season, the English transfer record was broken when Blackburn Rovers paid £5 million for 21-year-old Norwich City striker Chris Sutton. But that record was broken again in January when Manchester United paid £6 million for Newcastle United&#x27;s Andy Cole, in a deal which also saw £1 million-rated Keith Gillespie move to Newcastle. Other significant transfers before and during the 1994–95 season included: Vinny Samways (Tottenham to Everton, £2 million), David Rocastle (Manchester City to Chelsea, £1.25 million), Jürgen Klinsmann (Monaco to Tottenham Hotspur, £2 million), John Scales (Wimbledon to Liverpool, £3 million) and Paul Kitson (Derby County to Newcastle United, £2.2 million).

===Summary===
The title was won by Blackburn Rovers, whose last title success was in 1914, and also was Blackburn&#x27;s first major trophy in 67 years (the last being 1927–28 FA Cup). 
Kenny Dalglish&#x27;s side secured the championship on the last day of the season despite losing 2–1 at his former club Liverpool, as Manchester United could only manage a 1–1 draw at West Ham. 
This meant that Blackburn Rovers qualified for the European Cup for the first time in their history, while Manchester United finished second earning a UEFA Cup place. A single point separated the two sides, who for more than half of the season enjoyed a wide gap in terms of point between themselves and the rest of the league, despite the likes of Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Newcastle United looking like title contenders during the first three months of the season.

Also qualifying for the UEFA Cup were Nottingham Forest (who finished third in their first season back in the Premier League), Liverpool (who finished fourth and won their fifth League Cup in the club&#x27;s first full season following the appointment of Roy Evans) and fifth placed Leeds United.

The number of teams in the league for the following year would be reduced to 20. This was to be achieved by increasing the number of teams facing relegation to four, and reducing the number of teams being promoted from Division 1 to two. Ipswich Town were relegated in bottom place after winning just seven league games and conceding 93 goals. Newly promoted Leicester City also went down, winning just six times in the league and never being outside the bottom two after November. Norwich City, who had been in contention for a UEFA Cup place halfway through the season, suffered a nosedive in form during the second half of the season and were relegated just two seasons after being title contenders. The final relegation place on the last day of the season went to Crystal Palace, who still lost 3-2 despite a strong fightback at Newcastle after being 3-0 down.

===Controversial incidents===
In January 1995, Manchester United&#x27;s 28-year-old French striker Eric Cantona (then holder of the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year award) assaulted a Crystal Palace fan who verbally abused him in his team&#x27;s 1–1 draw at Selhurst Park. Cantona was banned from football for eight months, fined £20,000 and sentenced to 14 days in prison. The prison sentence was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal.

Chelsea midfielder Dennis Wise was convicted of criminal damage and assault, relating to a fight with a taxi driver in London. He was given a three-month prison sentence but the conviction and prison sentence were quickly overturned on appeal.

Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson admitted in November 1994 that he was an alcoholic and was also addicted to cocaine and gambling. He underwent a three-month drug rehabilitation programme before being allowed to resume his playing career.

Crystal Palace striker Chris Armstrong failed a drugs test in February 1995 but admitted that he had done wrong and returned to action after just four weeks undergoing rehabilitation. Armstrong was Palace&#x27;s leading goalscorer in 1994–95, helping them reach the semi-finals of both domestic cup competitions, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated back to the First Division just one season after winning promotion.

Arsenal manager George Graham was sacked in February 1995 after nearly nine years in charge, when it was revealed that he had accepted an illegal payment of £425,000 from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge relating to the purchases of Norwegian and Danish players Pål Lydersen and John Jensen three years earlier. Graham was later banned from football for one year by the FA.

==Teams==
Twenty-two teams competed in the league – the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest (both teams returning to the top flight after a season&#x27;s absence), and Leicester City (returning after a top flight absence of seven years). This was also Leicester City&#x27;s first season in the Premier League. They replaced Sheffield United, Oldham Athletic and Swindon Town, who were relegated to the First Division after their top flight spells of four, three and one year respectively. This was the final season to be contested by twenty-two teams as all seasons after were contested by twenty teams.

<doc id="1269276" wikidata="Q1388432" url="?curid=1269276" title="Jean-Christophe Lafaille">
<text>Jean-Christophe Lafaille (31 March 1965 – 27 January 2006 [presumed]) was a French climber noted for a number of difficult ascents in the Alps and Himalaya, and for what has been described as &quot;perhaps the finest self-rescue ever performed in the Himalaya&quot;, when he was forced to descend the mile-high south face of Annapurna alone with a broken arm, after his climbing partner had been killed in a fall. He climbed eleven of the fourteen eight-thousanders, many of them alone or by previously unclimbed routes, but disappeared during a solo attempt to make the first winter ascent of Makalu, the world&#x27;s fifth highest mountain.
==Early career==
Born in Gap, Hautes-Alpes, Lafaille&#x27;s background was in sport climbing, and as a teenager he climbed extensively at Céüse and played a part in turning it into one of the world&#x27;s best known climbing venues. In 1989 he became the first Frenchman to solo a climb graded 7c+, and one of the first to climb 8c graded routes.

In the early 1990s, Lafaille qualified as a mountain guide and began mountaineering in the Alps. He made a number of difficult ascents on the Mont Blanc massif, including the first solo climb of &quot;Divine Providence&quot; on the Grand Pilier d&#x27;Angle, one of the hardest routes on the massif.

==Self-rescue on Annapurna==
On the strength of his climbs in the Alps, Lafaille was invited on an expedition to Annapurna by Pierre Béghin, one of the leading French climbers of the day. The pair attempted the mountain&#x27;s vast South Face following the monsoon season in October 1992 in Alpine style, with no Sherpa support, pre-stocked campsites or fixed ropes on the upper mountain. They had reached a height of 7,400 metres when bad weather forced them to descend. The pair made a series of abseils down the face, but due to their lightweight approach they had little protective equipment and were often forced to abseil from a single piece of protection to conserve equipment. On the fourth or fifth abseil, Béghin fell to his death when the single cam he was using as an anchor became dislodged from the rock. Béghin had been carrying most of the pair&#x27;s technical equipment, including all the ropes, and Lafaille was left alone on the face, a vertical mile above safety.With great difficulty, Lafaille managed to climb down the 75 degree face to the pair&#x27;s last bivouac site, where he found 20 metres of thin rope, allowing him to make short abseils down some of the hardest parts. With no technical equipment to use as anchors he was forced to entrust his weight to tent pegs or, on one occasion, a plastic bottle. He finally reached what should have been the relative safety of the top of a fixed rope which he and Beghin had installed on a steep rock band, but almost immediately he was struck by a falling rock, which broke his right arm. Disabled and helpless, he lay on a ledge for two days in the hope that other climbers would rescue him. However, while there was a Slovenian team attempting a route on a different part of the South Face, they judged that a rescue attempt would be too dangerous to undertake, so help never came. The cruelest thing about the ordeal, Lafaille said, was being able to see life in the valley below, and by night, the flashbulbs of trekkers&#x27; cameras. In spite of this, he later agreed that the Slovenians had made the right decision in not trying to save him.

Eventually, with all hope of rescue gone, Lafaille resolved to continue down alone. He initially tried to continue abseiling, but unable to control the rope with only one hand and his teeth he reverted to downclimbing one-handed, and was utterly exhausted when he reached the Slovenian team&#x27;s base camp. By that time the climbers at the base of the mountain had given up hope for him, and his first wife, Véronique, had already been told that he had died. Reinhold Messner later said that the survival instinct he showed was of the sort which defines the best mountaineers.

==Subsequent career==

After Annapurna, Lafaille resolved never to climb again, but during his long physical and psychological recovery he began scrambling in the foothills of the Alps, and eventually returned to extreme climbing. In the Alps he carried out an enchainment of nine north faces in fifteen days, skiing from mountain to mountain, and made the first ascent of the &quot;Lafaille Route&quot; on the Petit Dru, which at the time was considered the hardest route in the Alps, but his most important climbs were in the Himalaya.

A year after his accident on Annapurna, he climbed Cho Oyu, and then in 1994 he climbed a new route, solo, on the north face of Shishapangma. It was the first of many solo ascents of 8000 meter peaks, including consecutive ascents of Gasherbrum I and Gasherbrum II in four days in 1996, and Manaslu in 2001.

Annapurna remained an obsession for Lafaille, and he would later call his autobiography &quot;Prisoner of Annapurna&quot;. He returned to the mountain three times. The first time he made a solo attempt on the British line on the South Face, which failed due to poor snow conditions. In 1998 he returned to the same route with a larger team, but the expedition was abandoned when a team member was killed in an avalanche. He finally reached the summit in 2002 with Alberto Iñurrategi &quot;via&quot; the long, committing east ridge.

By 2003, Lafaille had decided to try to climb all fourteen eight-thousanders; but unlike many of the mountaineers who take on this goal, he had no desire simply to climb them by well established routes, in large expeditions and with bottled oxygen. He preferred to continue trying to achieve new routes or solo ascents, or to climb in the more demanding winter season. In 2003, he climbed Nanga Parbat, Dhaulagiri (solo) and Broad Peak in a two-month period. The last of these nearly killed him when he fell into a crevasse and then developed high altitude pulmonary edema. He was rescued by Ed Viesturs and Denis Urubko.

When asked why Lafaille climbed solo, his wife Katia said he did not wish to see another climbing partner die.

In December 2004, he made a solo ascent of Shishapangma. It was intended to be the first winter ascent of the mountain, but he reached the summit on 11 December which was seen as too early to be classed as a true winter ascent. He had now completed eleven of the fourteen eight-thousanders, and needed Everest, Kanchenjunga and Makalu to complete his goal.

==Death on Makalu==

Lafaille&#x27;s last climb was one of his boldest. In December 2005, he began a solo attempt to climb Makalu (8462m), the only 8000-metre peak in Nepal not to have seen a winter ascent. It was a goal which would have been considered suicidal a few years previously, but for Lafaille the danger was an important part of the experience. He commented

&quot;I find it fascinating that our planet still has areas where no modern technology can save you, where you are reduced to your most basic - and essential - self. This natural space creates demanding situations that can lead to suffering and death, but also generate a wild interior richness. Ultimately, there is no way of reconciling these contradictions. All I can do it try to live within their margins, in the narrow boundary between joy and horror. Everything on this earth is a balancing act.&quot;

Over four weeks in December and January, he hauled loads up the mountain, entirely alone above his advance base camp at 5300m, but was forced to retreat from the col at Makalu La by strong winds, which destroyed his tent and twice blew him into the air. However, after two weeks at base camp the weather improved, and on 24 January he set off up the mountain. His only means of communication was a satellite phone, which he used to speak to his wife several times a day. By the morning of the 27th he was camped on a small ledge around 1000m below the summit, and told his wife that he would try to reach the top that day. He was never heard from again. Alone on the mountain in winter, with no climbers in the world sufficiently acclimatised to reach his high camp, there was no possibility of a rescue attempt. His base camp team gave up hope of him returning alive after he had been missing for a week, and a later helicopter flight over the mountain failed to find any sign of him. His body has not been found and his exact fate is unknown. 

=== Family ===
At the time of his death, he left his wife, Katia, and 3 children (2 from previous marriage and 1 from Katia, as Ed Viesturs writes in &quot;No Short Cuts to the Top&quot;).

His son, Tom Lafaille has become an alpinist and ski mountaineer, and has returned to his father&#x27;s routes in the Himalayas. In 2023, Tom Lafaille made the first successful French ski descent from Broad Peak.

<text>The bulava or buława (Polish spelling: &quot;buława&quot;; Ukrainian spelling: &quot;булава&quot; [&quot;bula&#x27;va&quot;]) is a ceremonial mace or baton or sceptre.

==Poland, Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth==
Historically the &quot;buława&quot; was an attribute of a hetman, an officer of the highest military rank (after the monarch) in the 15th- to 18th-century Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Hetmans typically added an image of a &quot;buława&quot; to their coats of arms.

Today the &quot;buława&quot; appears in the rank insignia of a Marshal of Poland.

==Ukraine==
In the Ukrainian language, a &quot;булава&quot; (bulava) is a mace or club, in both the military and ceremonial senses. The &quot;bulava&quot; was one of the Ukrainian Cossack &quot;kleinody&quot; (клейноди - &quot;jewels&quot;): Bohdan Khmelnytsky bore a &quot;bulava&quot; as Hetman of the Zaporizhian Host (in office: 1648 to 1657).

Historically the &quot;bulava&quot; was an attribute of a hetman, an officer of the highest military rank, and of the Hetman or the military head of a Cossack state (Cossack Hetmanate).

The Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic of 1917-1920 referred to the General Staff of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army as the &quot;General Bulava&quot;.

A ceremonial &quot;bulava&quot; is now an official emblem of the president of Ukraine, and is housed in Ukraine&#x27;s Vernadsky National Library.

Ukrainian military heraldry often features &quot;bulava&quot;-images, particularly as a part of rank insignia for generals and admirals, as well as an element of the insignia of the Ministry of Defence and of the NSDC.

<doc id="1269279" wikidata="Q522372" url="?curid=1269279" title="Earl Campbell">
<text>Earl Christian Campbell (born March 29, 1955), nicknamed &quot;the Tyler Rose&quot;, is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons, primarily with the Houston Oilers. Known for his aggressive, punishing running style and ability to break tackles, Campbell gained recognition as one of the best power running backs in NFL history.

Campbell played college football for the Texas Longhorns, where he won the Heisman Trophy and earned unanimous All-American honors in his senior season, as well as numerous other accolades. Campbell was selected first overall by the Oilers in the 1978 NFL draft, and had an immediate impact in the league, earning NFL Rookie of the Year honors. Campbell was also named the NFL&#x27;s Offensive Player of the Year in each of his first three seasons, during which he averaged nearly 1,700 rushing yards per season. Campbell won the AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award in 1979 after leading the league in rushing yards and touchdowns.

With head coach Bum Phillips, Campbell&#x27;s emergence in Houston coincided with the Luv Ya Blue era, a period of sustained success in which the Oilers made three straight playoff appearances. Campbell became the centerpiece of Houston&#x27;s offense during the late 1970s and early 1980s. He was traded to the New Orleans Saints six games into the 1984 season, where he spent his final season and a half before retiring. Campbell was inducted into both the College Football Hall of Fame (1990) and Pro Football Hall of Fame (1991). In 2019, he was named to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Campbell&#x27;s jersey number is retired by the University of Texas and the Tennessee Titans.

==Early life==
Earl Christian Campbell was born to Ann and Bert &quot;B.C.&quot; Campbell, on March 29, 1955, in Tyler, Texas, leading to the nickname, &quot;the Tyler Rose&quot; later in his career. He was the sixth of 11 siblings. Bert Campbell died when Earl was 11 years old. Campbell began playing football in fifth grade as a kicker, but moved to linebacker in sixth grade after watching Dick Butkus, whom he modeled his playing style after. Ann Campbell attempted to persuade Earl not to play football in high school. &quot;I dis-encouraged Earl,&quot; she said. &quot;But he always loved football.&quot; In 1973, Campbell led the Corky Nelson–coached John Tyler High School to the Texas 4A State Championship (4A then was the largest classification in the state). That season, Campbell was named Mr. Football USA as he was adjudged the national high school player of the year.

While heavily recruited, Campbell narrowed his choices to Houston, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Baylor. After in-home visits from Barry Switzer from Oklahoma and Darrell Royal from Texas, Campbell ultimately chose Texas. Switzer, who unsuccessfully recruited Campbell, said in his 1989 book that Campbell was the only player he ever saw who could have gone straight from high school to the NFL and immediately become a star.

==College career==
Campbell attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he played college football for the Texas Longhorns from 1974 to 1977.

As a freshman in 1974, Campbell played in all 11 games and had 162 carries for 928 yards and six touchdowns.

In 1975, Campbell was a first-team All-America selection at fullback by the American Football Coaches Association after leading the Southwest Conference with 1,118 rushing yards, 13 rushing touchdowns, and 78 points scored.

Leg injuries kept Campbell out of four games during his junior season, and he rushed for 653 yards and three touchdowns in seven games as Texas finished with a 5–5–1 record.

Campbell led the nation in rushing as a senior in 1977, with 1,744 yards and 19 touchdowns. In the third game of the season, against the Rice Owls, Campbell scored four touchdowns during a 72–15 blowout in which Texas kicker Russell Erxleben set an NCAA record with a 67-yard field goal. In his final regular-season game, Campbell rushed for a career-high 222 yards in a 57–28 victory over rival Texas A&amp;M, and the Longhorns finished the regular season undefeated. After clinching the Southwest Conference championship, the top-ranked Longhorns then faced No. 5 Notre Dame, led by quarterback Joe Montana, in the Cotton Bowl Classic. Campbell carried 29 times for 116 yards in the game, but Notre Dame was victorious, 38–10, and claimed the national championship. Texas was ranked fourth in the final AP Poll.

Campbell was awarded the Heisman Memorial Trophy as the most outstanding college player after the season, becoming the University of Texas&#x27; first winner of the award. He also became the first recipient of the Davey O&#x27;Brien Memorial Trophy which was awarded to the outstanding player in the Southwest Conference. The &quot;Sporting News&quot; and United Press International each named Campbell the college football player of the year. He was a unanimous All-American, being named to the first team by every major selector.

Campbell finished his college career with 4,443 rushing yards and 40 rushing touchdowns in 40 games through four seasons.

===College rushing statistics===
==Professional career==
===Houston Oilers===
Campbell was the first overall draft pick in the 1978 NFL draft, selected by the Houston Oilers, who signed him to a six-year, $1.4 million contract. The Oilers obtained the pick from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by trading tight end Jimmie Giles, their first and second round picks in the 1978 Draft, and their third and fifth round picks in the 1979 Draft. &quot;This is a commitment to excellence,&quot; said Oilers head coach Bum Phillips. &quot;It takes a great running back to have a winning football team and this kid is a great running back.&quot; After rushing for a league-leading and rookie record 1,450 yards, Campbell was named the Offensive Rookie of the Year by the &quot;Sporting News&quot; and Associated Press (AP). He was also named the AFC Offensive Player of the Year by United Press International (UPI), NFL Offensive Player of the Year by the AP, and the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP) by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) and Pro Football Writers of America (PFWA). Campbell&#x27;s emergence contributed to the start of the Luv Ya Blue era in Houston.
With quarterback Dan Pastorini nursing a mid-season shoulder injury, Campbell carried the Oilers to a five-game winning streak in 1979, which concluded with a 30–24 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day, in which he rushed for 195 yards and two touchdowns. He finished the season with 1,697 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns, leading the league in both categories. Campbell also set NFL records with 11 100-yard rushing games, seven consecutive 100-yard games, and 368 carries. He was named NFL MVP by the AP, NEA, and PFWA. Campbell also repeated as the AP Offensive Player of the Year, and won the Bert Bell Award as the league&#x27;s most outstanding player.

With his aggressive running style which favored running over players instead of around them, questions began to arise over how long Campbell could stay healthy. &quot;He runs with a lot of reckless abandon,&quot; said Ron Johnson, a former running back whose own career was cut short. &quot;You can run like that in college. But you can&#x27;t do that for 10 years and hope to survive.&quot; Pittsburgh Steelers running back Franco Harris said, &quot;Knocking over people can look very good but you can&#x27;t do it forever. Sometimes it&#x27;s going to be somebody else who knocks you over ... so the most important thing I think isn&#x27;t to get a few extra yards every time but to make sure you&#x27;re healthy enough to play.&quot; Bum Phillips, though, favored Campbell&#x27;s running style. &quot;I&#x27;ve been looking for a back like Earl,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to change his style. Why would I? You don&#x27;t want a guy who gets hit and then flops on the ground. Earl does the same thing other backs do, only better.&quot;

After an 11–5 regular-season record in 1979, the Oilers defeated the Denver Broncos in the wild-card round for their first home playoff win since 1960. Houston then won the divisional round game against the San Diego Chargers despite both Pastorini and Campbell missing the game due to injuries. With both back in the lineup, however, the Oilers lost the conference championship game the following week against the Pittsburgh Steelers. Campbell was held to just 15 yards on 17 carries against Pittsburgh&#x27;s &quot;Steel Curtain&quot; defense.

Campbell had his most productive rushing yardage season in 1980, with 1,934 yards in 15 games—an average of 128.9 yards per game. He finished 70 yards short of breaking O. J. Simpson&#x27;s single-season rushing yards record set in 1973. Campbell again led the league in rushing yards and touchdowns, and broke his own record for carries, with 373. Over 60 percent of Campbell&#x27;s yards came in the fourth quarter. &quot;That&#x27;s when the tough get going,&quot; said Campbell. He had four games of over 200 rushing yards, a single-season record that still stands as of the end of the 2016 season. Campbell also threw a 57-yard touchdown pass to receiver Billy &quot;White Shoes&quot; Johnson against the Steelers for his only career completion out of three attempts. The Oilers again finished with an 11–5 regular-season record, but lost in the Wild Card Round to the Oakland Raiders. For the third straight year, Campbell was awarded the Jim Thorpe Trophy by the Newspaper Enterprise Association as the league&#x27;s MVP, and named the Offensive Player of the Year by the AP.

Bum Phillips was fired three days after Houston&#x27;s loss in the wild-card game, and defensive coordinator Ed Biles was given the head coaching job. In 1981, the Oilers finished 7–9 and failed to make the playoffs for the first time with Campbell on the roster. Campbell also did not claim the rushing yards title for the first time in his career as he finished fifth in yards with 1,376 and seventh in touchdowns with 10. The highlight of the season was back-to-back rushing performances of over 180 yards, against the Cincinnati Bengals during Week 5 and against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 6. His 39 carries against the Seahawks set an Oilers single-game record. Campbell was invited to his fourth Pro Bowl, but failed to make an All-Pro roster.

A players&#x27; strike in 1982 shortened the season to nine games and the Oilers finished with a 1–8 record. Campbell had just two touchdowns and 538 rushing yards, an average of 59.8 yards per game—far below his average of 104.1 per game over the previous four seasons.

Campbell&#x27;s production improved greatly in 1983 as he had 1,301 yards and 12 touchdowns, and was invited to his fifth Pro Bowl. However, the Oilers finished the season tied for the worst record in the league at 2–14. Unhappy after he was pulled in the second half against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 10, Campbell demanded to be traded. He completed the season with the team but remained adamant with his demand in the off-season. &quot;I&#x27;m tired of hearing every week how I&#x27;m too dumb, washed up, too dumb to read holes, can&#x27;t block, can&#x27;t catch the football,&quot; said Campbell. The team&#x27;s back-to-back dismal seasons also added to his frustration.

In 1984, under new head coach Hugh Campbell, Houston started the season with six straight losses. After rushing for 278 yards total in the first six games of 1984, Campbell was traded to the New Orleans Saints, reuniting him with Bum Phillips.

===New Orleans Saints===
The Saints received Campbell in exchange for their first-round draft pick in 1985, with which Houston selected cornerback Richard Johnson. The trade came as a surprise in New Orleans; the team already had the young George Rogers, the 1981 No. 1 overall draft pick and that year&#x27;s Rookie of the Year and rushing champion. With Campbell and Rogers, the Saints now had two Heisman Trophy winners in the backfield. In his first game with New Orleans, Campbell carried five times for 19 yards, and continued to have a diminished role in the offense throughout the rest of the season. He rushed for a total of 468 yards and four touchdowns in 1984, and failed to record a 100-yard game during the season.

Campbell&#x27;s final 100-yard game was his only one in 1985: a 160-yard outburst against the Minnesota Vikings in which he scored his only touchdown of the season. Campbell finished the year with 643 rushing yards on 158 carries.

===Retirement===
After considering a return for one more season to reach 10,000 career rushing yards, Campbell retired during the 1986 preseason, feeling that the beating he had taken during his career had taken too much of a toll. &quot;I&#x27;m a man; I&#x27;m not a little boy,&quot; said Campbell. &quot;I believe this is the best thing—not only for myself, but for the Saints.&quot; He finished his career having rushed 2,187 times for 9,407 yards and 74 touchdowns to go along with 121 receptions for 806 yards in the regular season.

==Legacy and honors==
Campbell is widely acknowledged as one of the best power running backs in NFL history, and was highly regarded by his peers. &quot;Every time you hit him you lower your own IQ,&quot; said Redskins linebacker Pete Wysocki. Cornerback Lester Hayes of the Raiders said, &quot;Earl Campbell was put on this earth to play football.&quot; Cliff Harris, safety for the Cowboys, recalled Campbell as &quot;the hardest-hitting running back I ever played against. He didn&#x27;t have the elusiveness of an O. J. Simpson. But when you finished a game against Earl, you had to sit in a tub with Epsom salts.&quot; Bum Phillips, when asked if Campbell was in a class by himself, quipped, &quot;I dunno. But if he ain&#x27;t, it don&#x27;t take long to call the roll.&quot;

Campbell is considered one of the greatest running backs in Texas Longhorns and college football history. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1990, along with fellow Heisman winner Jim Plunkett of Stanford. Campbell became the first Texas Longhorns football player to have his jersey retired by the university, his number 20 being retired in 1979. In 2000, an internet poll of Longhorns fans voted Campbell to Texas&#x27; All-Century team. He received the most votes, beating out recently graduated Ricky Williams.

On July 27, 1991, Campbell was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Others inducted in the 1991 class were John Hannah, Stan Jones, Tex Schramm, and Jan Stenerud. He was introduced at the ceremony by Bum Phillips. Campbell&#x27;s jersey number 34 was retired by the Oilers in 1987. He was inducted as one of six charter members into the Titans Hall of Fame in 1999, although Campbell declined an invitation to the induction ceremony, stating, &quot;I was a Houston Oiler, not a Tennessee Titan.&quot;

In 1999, Campbell was ranked number 33 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 greatest football players, the highest-ranked player for the Houston Oilers franchise. In 2010, NFL Network ranked Campbell the 55th greatest player of all time in &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot;, and he was ranked by the sportswriter Max Bertellotti of the Turner Sports Network as the number 3 &quot;power back&quot; of all time, behind Jim Brown and John Riggins.

Campbell was honored at halftime against Ohio State on September 9, 2006, including the unveiling of a bronze statue of Campbell in the southwest corner of Royal-Memorial Stadium. The same year, he was featured on the cover of &quot;Dave Campbell&#x27;s Texas Football&quot;, an honor that eluded him during his playing days.

In 2019, Campbell was one of twelve running backs selected to the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team.

On January 13, 2020, Campbell was honored during the College Football Playoff National Championship for the 150th anniversary of college football. ESPN named him the 7th best college football player of all time.

Campbell was declared an official State Hero in 1981 by the Texas legislature, an honor previously bestowed upon only Stephen F. Austin, Sam Houston and Davy Crockett.

A section of roadway in Tyler, Texas, extending from Loop 323 to SH155 was named the Earl Campbell Parkway at its opening in 2012. In 2013, the Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award, an award given to the best offensive player in NCAA Division I with Texas ties, was named in Campbell&#x27;s honor.

==Personal life==
While at the University of Texas, Campbell was a member of the honorary men&#x27;s service organization, the Texas Cowboys.

In 1980, Campbell married his high school sweetheart Reuna Smith, and they have two sons: Christian and Tyler. Christian played high school football with Drew Brees, the nephew of his father&#x27;s former Longhorns teammate Marty Akins, at Westlake High and ran track for the University of Houston. Tyler was a running back for Pasadena City College and San Diego State but was forced to give up the sport due to multiple sclerosis (MS). He returned to Texas after graduation and divides his time between the family business and raising awareness of MS with his father.

In 1990, Campbell founded Earl Campbell Meat Products, Inc. which manufactures and sells Earl Campbell&#x27;s Smoked Sausage and other food products and barbecue sauce. Campbell and his associates also opened a restaurant in 1999 on Sixth Street in Austin called Earl Campbell&#x27;s Lone Star BBQ, which closed in 2001.

As of 2016, he still actively participated in University of Texas athletics, serving as special assistant to the football team.

===Health===
Campbell has experienced various physical ailments in his later life. By 2001, at age 46, Campbell could barely close his fist due to arthritis in his hands. He developed foot drop due to nerve damage in his legs, and has difficulty bending his back and knees. Campbell was diagnosed with spinal stenosis in 2009. Because of his difficulty walking, Campbell uses a cane or a walker, and a wheelchair for longer distances. At first, he maintained the ailments were genetic, but said in 2012, &quot;I think some of it came from playing football, playing the way I did.&quot;

In 2009, Campbell became addicted to painkillers prescribed for his spinal stenosis, taking as many as ten OxyContin pills a day with Budweiser. He went through rehabilitation and broke his addiction the same year, and since publicizing the incident in 2013, has spoken out about the dangers of substance abuse.

<doc id="1269282" wikidata="Q5280359" url="?curid=1269282" title="Direct material total variance">
<text>In variance analysis (accounting) direct material total variance is the difference between the actual cost of actual number of units produced and its budgeted cost in terms of material. Direct material total variance can be divided into two components:
*the direct material price variance,
*the direct material usage variance.

==Example==
Let us assume that standard direct material cost of widget is as follows:
:2 kg of unobtainium at $ 60 per kg ( = $ 120 per unit). 
Let us assume further that during the given period, 100 widgets were manufactured, using 212 kg of unobtainium which cost $ 13,144.

Under those assumptions direct material total variance can be calculated as:

Direct material total variance can be reconciled to direct material price variance and direct material usage variance by:

See direct material usage variance#Example and direct material price variance#Example for computations of both components.

<text>Anna Botsford Comstock (September 1, 1854 – August 24, 1930) was an author, illustrator, and educator of natural studies. The first female professor at Cornell University, her over 900-page work, &quot;The Handbook of Nature Study&quot; (1911), is now in its 24th edition. Comstock was an American artist and wood engraver known for illustrating entomological text books with her husband, John Henry Comstock including their first joint effort, &quot;The Manual for the Study of Insects&quot; (1885). Comstock worked with Liberty Hyde Bailey, John Walton Spencer, Alice McCloskey, Julia Rogers, and Ada Georgia as part of the department of Nature Study at Cornell University. Together they wrote nature study curricula to develop a curiosity for, and education about, the surrounding natural world. Comstock also was a proponent for conservationism by instilling a love and appreciation of the natural world around us.

==Early life and education==
Anna Botsford Comstock was born in a log house in Otto, New York to Marvin and Phebe Irish Botsford. At the age of three, the family moved to a frame house on a farm with both a horse and cattle barn. A self-providing family, they raised their own vegetables, had fruit orchards, raised cattle, pigs, sheep, and poultry. As the only child of the family, education was important both in a school house and at home where Comstock and her Quaker mother spent time together examining the wildflowers, birds, and trees. Phebe Botsford shared her passionate love of nature with her daughter, Anna, taking her into the nearby woods and fields. Here Anna learned &quot;...the popular names of sixty or more common flowers; she taught her a dozen constellations...&quot;

In 1871, as there was no high school in Otto, Comstock attended the Chamberlain Institute and Female College, one of two seminaries under the direction of the Methodist Church in Randolph, New York. It was here where Comstock first met the acquaintance of Martha Van Rensselaer, &quot;...never dreaming how closely she would be associated with me in later life.&quot; Comstock&#x27;s years at Chamberlain enhanced her love of literature, oration, and language. She graduated June 1873 giving her Salutatory speech, before her peers, in Latin. Comstock returned to Otto to teach school for a year in which she thoroughly enjoyed. The following summer of 1874, with her parents, Anna traveled westward to visit family. The trip postponed her start at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, until November 1874 at the start of the second term.

== Cornell University ==
Anna Botsford enrolled at Cornell in 1874, and faced a variety of challenges. Upon arriving at Cornell, Comstock found that she had to take several examinations in order to enter, and particularly needed tutoring in German. She also lived at a boarding house with several other students, and maintained an active social life. Botsford&#x27;s course work included both botany and zoology with corresponding laboratory periods in both. When she returned to Cornell in 1875, she was part of the first group of thirty-three young women to move into the newly built Sage Hall on campus.

During the winter semester of 1875, she took an entomology class with John Henry Comstock, who was just two years into his career as a university lecturer. Their friendship bloomed into a romance and marriage (October 7, 1878) and she quietly withdrew from student life to that of the responsibilities of a young professor&#x27;s wife at the fledgling university. The new Mrs. Comstock illustrated her husband&#x27;s entomological papers and assisted him with the details of his research and work as an entomologist to the U. S. Department of Agriculture (1879–1881) in Washington, D.C.

Upon their return to Ithaca and academic life at Cornell in 1881, Comstock was determined to &quot;...go back to the University and take the course in science which my husband had taken, and get my degree.&quot; Comstock received her diploma from the hands of Cornell President Andrew D. White in June 1885. Comstock became a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority (November 4, 1882), and she was one of the first women elected to the honorary society of Sigma Xi at Cornell in 1888.

==Career==
Throughout her life, Comstock illustrated her husband&#x27;s lectures and publications on insects. She had no formal training in this illustration; she would study an insect under a microscope then draw it. While her husband was chief entomologist in the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1879 to 1881, she prepared the drawings for his 1880 &quot;Report of the Entomologist&quot; on citrus scale insects. She then reentered Cornell and received a degree in natural history in 1885. She studied wood engraving at Cooper Union, New York City, so she could prepare illustrations for her husband&#x27;s book &quot;Introduction to Entomology&quot; in 1888. Also in 1888, she was one of the first four women admitted to Sigma Xi, a national honor society for the sciences.

Comstock made engravings for the more than 600 plates used in the &quot;Manual for the Study of Insects&quot; (1895), &quot;Insect Life&quot; (1897), and &quot;How to Know the Butterflies&quot; (1904), the first written by her husband and the latter two co-authored by them. Her engravings appeared in the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in 1893, the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900, and in the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo in 1900. She was the third woman to become a member of the Society of American Wood-Engravers, and has been recognized as its most prolific producer of original (as opposed to reproductive) images.

Anna Botsford Comstock both wrote and illustrated several books, including &quot;Ways of the Six-Footed&quot; (1903), &quot;How to Keep Bees&quot; (1905), &quot;The Handbook of Nature Study&quot; (1911), &quot;The Pet Book&quot; (1914), and &quot;Trees at Leisure&quot; (1916). She also wrote the novel &quot;Confessions to a Heathen Idol&quot; (1906). The horticulturist Liberty Hyde Bailey and her husband both told her they expected &quot;The Handbook of Nature Study&quot; to lose money, but it became a standard textbook for teachers and was later translated into eight languages, with over twenty printings. It is still in print.

Comstock is most famous for being one of the first to bring her students and other teachers out-of-doors to study nature. In 1895, she was appointed to the New York State Committee for the Promotion of Agriculture. In this position, she planned and implemented an experimental course of nature study for the public schools. The program was approved for statewide use through the extension service of Cornell. She then wrote and spoke on behalf of the program, helped train teachers, and prepared classroom materials. Starting in 1897, she taught nature study at Cornell. Comstock was the first female professor at Cornell. After being appointed assistant professor of nature study in 1898, she was demoted to lecturer due to opposition from trustees over the appointment of a woman. She again became an assistant professor in 1913. She was finally recognized as a full professor in 1920. 
(In 1911, Martha Van Rensselaer and Flora Rose became the first women with full professorships at Cornell.)

Comstock edited &quot;Nature-Study Review&quot; from 1917 to 1923, and she was on the staff of &quot;Country Life in America&quot;.

==Later life and legacy==
In 1922, Comstock retired from Cornell as &quot;professor emerita&quot; but continued to teach in the summer session. In 1923, the League of Women Voters chose Anna Botsford Comstock and her Cornell colleague, Martha Van Rensselaer, as two of the twelve greatest living American women to have &quot;&#x27;contributed most in their respective fields for the betterment of the world.&#x27;&quot; In 1930, she received an honorary doctorate in Humane Letters from Hobart College.

Comstock died in Ithaca, New York in 1930. In 1988, she was inducted into the National Wildlife Federation Conservation Hall of Fame.

Comstock Hall, a residence hall at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, was named in her honor.

===Memoir===
Comstock&#x27;s memoir was posthumously published by heir Glenn Herrick in 1953, edited by him and Ruby Green Smith, titled &quot;The Comstocks of Cornell: John Henry Comstock and Anna Botsford Comstock&quot;. Herrick and Green heavily edited the original manuscript, removing elements considered irrelevant and removing suggestions of controversy; they also emphasized John Henry&#x27;s accomplishments over Anna&#x27;s. In 2020, a new edition of Comstock&#x27;s memoir was published, based more closely on the 716 surviving pages of Comstock&#x27;s original manuscript in the Cornell University Archives. The new edition, based on six years of research, attempts to convey &quot;a better sense of what Anna was truly like&quot; by presenting what survives of her actual writings, including accounts of her &quot;marriage, travel, teaching, and scientific study&quot;. The new edition of &quot;The Comstocks of Cornell: John Henry Comstock and Anna Botsford Comstock; A Complete Biography&quot; was published in 2020 by Cornell University Press.
