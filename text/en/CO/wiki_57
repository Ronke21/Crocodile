<text>Amicus Bank was a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) which provided non-traditional banking to customers.

==Canadian operations==
Within Canada, Amicus Bank was primarily responsible for operating President&#x27;s Choice Financial&#x27;s retail banking operations, excluding credit cards. Amicus Bank briefly provided services under its own name through Bell Sympatico&#x27;s portal. It also took on the operation of non-branch automated banking machines (primarily stand-alone ABMs at services stations, convenience stores) which were co-branded for Amicus Bank and CIBC.

The bank asked for and received approval from the Minister of Finance for voluntary dissolution in 2002. Services operated by Amicus Bank were subsequently provided by the direct banking division of CIBC. President&#x27;s Choice Financial banking services were then rebranded Simplii Financial after CIBC dissolved its partnership with Loblaw Companies in 2017.

Amicus Bank had 1100 employees in Canada and the US. XtraCash ATM Incorporated (founded 1998) was acquired under Amicus FSB in 2001.

==US operations==
Amicus had an American unit, Amicus FSB (Amicus Federal Savings Bank), which was formed in 2000 and has since ceased operations due to cancellation of joint ventures south of the border. Amicus FSB partnered with Safeway grocery stores in western US states (California, Colorado) and Florida, doing business as Safeway SELECT Bank with 161 locations, and partnered with Winn-Dixie in Florida, doing business as Marketplace Bank (CIBC National) with 185 locations. Amicus set up banking kiosks where customers could make deposits, apply for loans, and withdraw money. The US unit ceased operation at the end of November 2002 with customers with certificate of deposit transferred over to E-Trade Bank. Amicus FSB filed with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for voluntary liquidation and closing with operations ceasing on September 29, 2003.

<doc id="1290077" wikidata="Q1122203" url="?curid=1290077" title="River Slaney">
<text>The River Slaney (; ) is a large river in the southeast of Ireland. It rises on Lugnaquilla Mountain in the western Wicklow Mountains and flows west and then south through counties Wicklow, Carlow and Wexford for 117.5 km (73 mi), before entering St George&#x27;s Channel in the Irish Sea at Wexford town. The estuary of the Slaney is wide and shallow and is known as Wexford Harbour. The catchment area of the River Slaney is 1,762 km2. The long-term average flow rate of the River Slaney is 37.4m3/s

Towns that the Slaney runs through include Stratford-on-Slaney, Baltinglass, Tullow, Bunclody, Enniscorthy and Wexford. The river is crossed by 32 road bridges and one railway bridge.

==Wildlife==
Varied and plentiful wildlife can be found in the environs of the river. In Wicklow, herds of deer can be seen, as well as swans, dippers, mallards, herons and kingfishers. At dusk, bats, owls and otters may be seen, while the mudflats of the estuary are favoured by black-headed gulls, redshanks and oystercatchers. The goosander can be seen on the Slaney at Kildavin. In season, salmon and trout and pike are fished.

==History==
Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; (2nd century AD) described a river called Μοδοννος (&quot;Modonnos&quot;, &quot;mudflats&quot;) which may have referred to the River Slaney, though scholarly opinion remains divided on the issue.

There is a reference to the Slaney in the Irish ballad Boolavogue, commemorating the Battle of Vinegar Hill in the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

&quot;Slaney Valley&quot; was a 1972 Irish number one for Larry Cunningham.

==Tributaries==
Tributaries of the Slaney include the River Derreen, the River Derry, the River Clody, the River Bann, the River Urrin, the River Boro, and the River Sow.

<doc id="1290080" wikidata="Q849286" url="?curid=1290080" title="Treaty of Bucharest (1812)">
<text>The Treaty of Bucharest between the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire, was signed on 28 May 1812, in Manuc&#x27;s Inn in Bucharest, and ratified on 5 July 1812, at the end of the Russo-Turkish War of 1806–1812. The Ottomans had done poorly in the war. The Sublime Porte above all wanted to stay out of the impending conflict between Napoleon&#x27;s France and Russia. The Russians did not want a war on two fronts, thus they made peace in order to be free for the upcoming war with France. The Ottomans had extricated themselves from a potentially disastrous war with a slight loss of territory. This treaty became the basis for future Russo-Ottoman relations.

==Background==
===Russo-Turkish war of 1806===
The war was fought between the Russian Empire and Ottoman Empire beginning in 1806. It happened at the same time as the Napoleonic Wars had been pushing across Europe. Sultan Selim III of the Ottoman empire was encouraged by the French Empire to remove multiple lords from their land in Wallachia and Moldavia. This was due to their Pro-Russian positions held in the Ottoman vassal states. During this, the French also moved into the Balkan Peninsula raising tensions with Russia. To protect their borders from potential French invasion Russia moved thousands of soldiers into Moldavia and Wallachia, which then caused the Sultan to declare war on Russia.

Initially a large Ottoman offensive was sent to Bucharest, Wallachia which was occupied by Russians, but failed. In Armenia a few thousand Russian troops won against 20,000 of Turkish forces, and then Russia had a major naval victory defeating the Ottoman fleet. This naval victory, along with the other early victories led to Selim III being deposed. Russians then destroyed the Ottoman fleet for good to establish naval supremacy. In 1811, Grand Vizier Ahmed Pasha gathered 60,000 Turkish soldiers in Ottoman controlled Bulgaria. After a few months they attacked the Russians but were held off long enough for Russians to retreating across the Danube River. The Turkish chased after them but had been led into an ambush and were promptly surrounded. Shortly after these battles Russia decided it was time to make peace.

==Negotiations==
The negotiations took place in Bucharest and started on 11 January 1812. The Ottoman negotiators were Mehmed Said Galib Efendi, Reis Efendi, Muftuzade Ibrahim Selim Efendi, and Abdulhamid Efendi. The Russian plenipotentiaries were Andre Italinsky, Lieutenant-General Jean Sabaniev, Joseph Fontone and Antoine Fonton. Initially, Russia refused to modify the peace terms to give the Ottomans any benefit. They had wanted to gain more land in the Balkans and Caucasus than the Ottomans were willing to give and wanted control of many Turkish ports and fortresses along the Black Sea and Danube River. This is when British plenipotentiary, Stratford Canning came to Constantinople to help move the process along. Canning recommended to Russia to be more moderate in their demands of European and Asiatic territories, because if the Ottomans were pushed too far, they may turn to France for an ally. The French, however, were attempting to prevent the settlement from being reached. In early May, the Russians modified their end of the demands on the advice of Canning, to make progress on the treaty. Eventually the treaty was signed by both parties in Manuc’s Inn, Bucharest on 28 May 1812 and ratified on 5 July 1812.

==Terms==
Under its terms, the Budjak and the eastern half of the Principality of Moldavia, between Prut and Dniester Rivers, with an area of (Bessarabia), was ceded by the Ottoman Empire (to which Moldavia was a vassal) to Russia. Also, Russia obtained trading rights on the Danube.

In Transcaucasia, the Ottomans renounced their claims to most of western Georgia by accepting the Russian annexation of the Kingdom of Imereti, in 1810. In return they retained control of Akhalkalaki, Poti, and Anapa previously captured by the Russo-Georgian troops in the course of the war

Furthermore a truce was signed (Article 8 of the Treaty) with the rebelling Serbs and autonomy given to Serbia.

The Treaty of Bucharest, signed by the Russian commander Mikhail Kutuzov, was ratified by Alexander I of Russia 13 days before Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Russia.

==Legacy==
On 17 April 2011, Action 2012, a coalition of organizations supporting unification between Moldova and Romania, was founded. The coalition is named after the year 2012, which marked the 200th anniversary of the Treaty of Bucharest.

<doc id="1290088" wikidata="Q1131200" url="?curid=1290088" title="Egg case (Chondrichthyes)">
<text>An egg case or egg capsule, often colloquially called a mermaid&#x27;s purse, is the casing that surrounds the eggs of oviparous chondrichthyans. Living chondricthyans that produce egg cases include some sharks, skates and chimaeras. Egg cases typically contain one embryo, except for big skate and mottled skate egg cases, which contain up to 7 embryos. Oviparity is completely absent in the superorder Squalomorphii. Egg cases are also thought to have been produced by some extinct chondricthyan groups, such as hybodonts and xenacanths.

== Description ==
Egg cases are made of collagen protein strands, and are often described as feeling rough and leathery. Some egg cases have a fibrous material covering the outside of the egg case, thought to aid in attachment to substrate. Egg cases without a fibrous outer layer can be striated, bumpy, or smooth and glossy. With the exception of bullhead shark eggs, egg cases are typically rectangular in shape with projections, called horns, at each corner. Depending on the species, egg cases may have one or more tendrils.

== Development ==
Shortly after internal fertilization, the fertilized ovum enters the partially formed egg case located in the oviduct. After the ovum enters, the rest of the egg case forms around it. Shortly after the egg case finishes developing, it is deposited outside the body; common locations include kelp forests and rocky seafloors. Egg cases are typically produced in pairs, each with one fertilized embryo inside, with the exception of a few species that produce egg cases with more than one viable embryo.

Gestation can take anywhere from a few months to over a year. After a period of development, typically a week or two, small slits open on each side of the egg case to aid water flow. The embryo fans its tail constantly to promote exchange with surrounding water.

==Sharks==

Oviparity in sharks can be categorized as single or retained. With single oviparity, the egg cases are extruded soon after fertilization. With retained oviparity, eggs are kept within the oviduct for a period of time before depositing outside of the body as an unhatched egg case. It is thought that viviparity is the ancestral condition for sharks, and that it evolved through the elongation of retention time of retained oviparity.

Oviparous sharks are known to regularly produce unfertilized eggs when kept in captivity without males.

===Bullhead sharks===
Bullhead shark egg cases are shaped like an auger, with two spiral flanges. This allows the egg cases to become wedged in the crevices of rocky sea floors, where the eggs are protected from predators; however, some bullhead sharks deposit their eggs on sponges or seaweed. Hatchlings are considered large for sharks, reaching over 14 cm in length by the time they leave the egg case. Bullhead shark eggs typically hatch after 7 to 12 months, depending on the species. The female Japanese bullhead shark has been known to deposit their eggs in one location along with other females, called a &quot;nest&quot;. The egg case of the Mexican hornshark features a tendril and more rigid flanges, suggesting that egg case design of this species is evolving towards anchoring with tendrils and away from wedging into crevices. As a member of the order Heterodontiformes, the whitespotted bullhead sharks is thought to be oviparous, but egg cases have never been observed.

===Carpet sharks===
The bamboo sharks (Hemiscylliidae) and the zebra shark (Stegostomatidae) lay eggs on the bottom, while the other carpet sharks give live birth. The egg cases are oval and covered with adhesive fibers that serve to secure them to the bottom.

===Ground sharks===

Some catsharks (Scyliorhinidae) and the finback catsharks in the genus &quot;Proscyllium&quot; are the only members of their order that lay eggs. The egg cases of catsharks are purse-shaped with long tendrils at the corners that serve to anchor them to structures on the sea floor.

The size of egg cases vary; those of the small-spotted catshark or lesser spotted dogfish, &quot;Scyliorhinus canicula&quot;, are around long, while those of the greater spotted dogfish, &quot;S. stellaris&quot;, are around . That excludes the four long tendrils found in each corner, which assist in anchorage. Egg cases from rays vary in that they have points rather than tendrils. The colours and shapes of egg cases also vary greatly from species to species.

==Skates==

The skates (Rajidae, Arhynchobatidae, Anacanthobatidae) are the only rays that are oviparous. Females lay egg cases onto the sea floor after fertilization occurs in utero. While in utero, a protected case forms around the embryo which is called the egg case. Studies have been done where egg cases were removed from gravid females to ensure proper identification in regard to skate species. Egg cases have distinguishable characteristic traits that are unique to that species, thus making it a great tool for identifying a skate. The two most distinguishable features on the egg case are the keel and the absence or presence of a fibrous covering. A keel runs laterally along both sides of the outer edge of the egg case; it is a flexible structure. Keels will also run the length of the horns on some skate species. Some egg cases have broad keels (greater than 10% of the maximum egg case width) while others have narrow keels (less than 10% of the maximum egg case width). Many egg cases are covered with a layer of fiber; some will have a fine layer while others have a thick layer.

=== Big skate ===
Big skate egg cases are larger than most other skate egg cases; typically ranging from 210 to 280 mm in length and 110 to 180 mm in width. Big skates egg cases are approximately 15% of the overall length of the female skate. The egg case is very smooth and lacks external fibrous material. This egg case can be easily identified from all others in that it is the only one to have a steep ridge; giving the case a convex shape. The keel on the egg case is considered very broad; representing 30–33% of the width of the egg case.

Big skates are one of only two skates known to have multiple embryos inside an egg case; up to 7 embryos have been found inside a single case. But most big skate egg cases contain 3–4 embryos.

===Longnose skate===
The longnose skate, &quot;Raja rhina&quot;, is considered a larger skate species; reaching a maximum size range of 145 cm total length. Although their egg cases are smaller than that of the big skate, their cases are also considered large; ranging 93–102 mm in length. Egg cases contain a single embryo. Longnose skate egg cases found in the field are brown in color. The external side is covered with a fibrous material, which is thicker on the top side and thinner on the bottom side of the case. The case is smooth underneath the fibrous material.

==Chimaeras==

All known chimaeras produce egg cases. The egg cases of chimaeras are spindle- or bottle-shaped with fins on the sides. They are laid on the bottom of the sea floor. Chimaeras (subclass Holocephali), some sharks, and skates are among the 43% of known Chondrichthian species to exhibit oviparity. However, there are some key morphological differences that are specific to chimaeras. The holocephalan egg capsule, or egg case, has a bulbous center flanked laterally by flattened collagen tissue. The flattened collagen tissue joins on the anterior end of the egg capsule to form a tail. Sharp projections located on the anterior and posterior end of the egg case serve to better secure the egg case in between rocks, as well as protection against potential predators.

== Extinct chondrichthyans ==

The egg case genera &quot;Palaeoxyris&quot; and &quot;Fayolia&quot;, which are thought to have been produced by hybodonts and xenacanths respectively, two groups of extinct shark-like cartilaginous fish more closely related to modern sharks and rays than to chimaeras, resemble those of bulldog sharks in having a spiral collarettes running around them. Both &quot;Palaeoxyris&quot; and &quot;Fayolia&quot; taper towards their ends (with the tapering being more pronounced in &quot;Palaeoxyris&quot;), with one end having a tendril. Unlike modern sharks, these eggs are typically found in freshwater environments.

== Threats ==
Predation on egg cases is thought to be a major source of mortality for developing oviparous sharks, skates and chimaeras. In general, predation is the leading cause of mortality for marine fish eggs, due to their abundance and high nutritional value. Parental care ends when the egg case is released from the body, so the embryo relies on its tough, leathery exterior as its only source of protection. Some gastropods are known to feed on egg cases by boring into the exterior. Sharks are also common predators of egg cases.

<doc id="1290090" wikidata="Q16996103" url="?curid=1290090" title="Hullabaloo (TV series)">
<text>Hullabaloo was an American musical variety series that ran on NBC from January 12, 1965, through April 11, 1966 (with repeats to August 1966). Similar to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Shindig!&quot; and in contrast to &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, it aired in prime time.

==Overview==
Directed by Steve Binder, who went on to direct Elvis Presley&#x27;s 1968 &quot;comeback&quot; special, &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; served as a big-budget, quality showcase for the leading pop acts of the day, and was also competition for another like-minded television showcase, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Shindig!&quot; A different host presided each week—among these were Sammy Davis Jr., Jerry Lewis, Gary Lewis, Petula Clark, Paul Anka, Liza Minnelli, Jack Jones, David McCallum and Frankie Avalon—singing a couple of his or her own hits and introducing the different acts. Chart-topping acts who performed on the show included Simon and Garfunkel, the Mamas &amp; the Papas, Dionne Warwick, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, Sonny &amp; Cher, the Supremes, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, the Animals, Roy Orbison and Marianne Faithfull. The first 13 episodes of &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; included black and white segments taped in London and hosted by the Beatles&#x27; manager Brian Epstein where he introduced up and coming UK music acts to the American audience. Sid Bernstein was the booking agent for Hullabaloo. Peter Matz, later of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, was the orchestra leader. Peppiatt and Aylesworth were the writers.

Some of the programs in the series were videotaped at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. Most were taped in New York City, either at NBC&#x27;s Studio 8H in the RCA Building (which was built for Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, and would later house &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;), or at NBC&#x27;s color studio in the Midwood section of Brooklyn (where &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; would be filmed many years later).

===Color episodes===
Much of the series&#x27; color videotaped footage was later transferred over to kinescope on film – as such copied in black and white. In 1973, after the shows production company declined to own the original color masters (as NBC was purging much of the content from its archives in the wake of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules), the episodes were wiped and only three half-hour episodes are known to exist in their original color videotaped form.

The three surviving color episodes were hosted by Michael Landon, Jerry and Gary Lewis (both co-hosted the same episode) and Paul Anka, respectively and featured: the Byrds, and David Winters (Landon), Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders (both Landon and Lewis&#x27;) the Cyrkle, Lesley Gore, Peter and Gordon (Anka), Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys, Barry McGuire (Lewis’).

===Dancers===
The show was choreographed by David Winters, who selected and choreographed the Hullabaloo Dancers, a team of four men and six women who appeared on a regular basis. Two of them, Michael Bennett and Donna McKechnie, went on to achieve considerable fame on Broadway. Dancer Patrick Adiarte, who also attempted to launch a solo singing career on the series, went on to play Ho-Jon in the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Another female dancer, model/actress Lada Edmund Jr. (known today as Lada St. Edmund, was best known as one of the caged &quot;go-go girl&quot; dancers in the &quot;Hullabaloo A-Go-Go&quot; segment near the closing sequence of the show. She also had a brief recording career with the singles &quot;I Know Something&quot; and &quot;The Larue.&quot; She later co-starred with Jon Voight in the 1969 film &quot;Out of It&quot; and in &quot;Act of Vengeance&quot; released in 1974. Dancer Suzanne Charney also had some degree of fame on Broadway as the lead frug dancer in &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, reprising her role in the 1969 film as well. David Winters went on to direct or produce over 200 TV shows, specials and films.

==Broadcast history==
The series was originally a one-hour broadcast, airing 8:30–9:30 p.m. on Tuesday. Its first season ran 18 new episodes from January through May 1965 then, from June through August 1965, it featured selected repeats, which aired 10:00–11:00 p.m.

The second season of 30 new episodes ran from September 1965 to April 1966. Reduced to thirty minutes, the episodes aired 7:30–8:00 p.m. on Monday. From May through August 1966 it aired repeats, and was replaced by the sitcom &quot;The Monkees&quot; in September 1966.

==Availability==
Highlights of many of the segments have been compiled for release in VHS and DVD formats. Additionally, a special entitled “Hullabaloo—a 60’s Flashback” has been produced under “My Music” umbrella for use by PBS stations during pledge drives; it premiered in March 2013.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Hullabaloo&quot; was mentioned in the lyrics of the 1980 Ramones song &quot;Do You Remember Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Radio?&quot;:
Do you remember &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&quot;Upbeat&quot;, &quot;Shindig!&quot; and &quot;Ed Sullivan&quot;, too?&lt;br&gt;Do you remember rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll radio?

The show was also featured in the movie &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; (1998).

In Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot;, fictional actor Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) appears as a guest host on &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;, singing the 1956 song &quot;Green Door&quot;.

<text>Norman Lowell (born 29 July 1946) is a Maltese ultranationalist writer and head and founder of Imperium Europa, a far-right political party. He is also a retired banker and artist.

==Politics==

Imperium Europa advocates Europe as a homeland for White people. The party&#x27;s remit is to unite &quot;all European natives&quot; (i.e., European-descended peoples, but not non-European-descended immigrants born in Europe) under one flag, hence the name &quot;Imperium Europa&quot; (European Empire), leading to &quot;a Europid bond forged through Spirituality closely followed by Race, nurtured through High culture, protected by High politics, enforced by the Elite.&quot; In his formulation Lowell combines Cosmotheism and the ideas of Francis Parker Yockey&#x27;s &quot;Imperium&quot;.

Lowell contested the first European Parliament elections that were held in Malta on 12 June 2004, obtaining 1,603 first-count votes from a total of 250,691 votes cast (0.64%). Lowell again contested the European Parliamentary elections in Malta on 6 June 2009. He received 3,559 votes, out of 322,411 cast, for just over one percent of the vote. In the 2014 MEP elections Lowell again doubled his votes to over 7,000, this time surpassing the Green Party&#x27;s leader Arnold Cassola.

In May 2019, Lowell once again contested the European Parliament election. This time, he obtained 9,693 votes from a total of 270,022 votes cast (3.59%). This result makes Imperium Europa the third most popular party in Malta.

Campaigning heavily against illegal immigrants, Lowell was the party&#x27;s candidate in the 11th and 12th Districts in the March 2008 parliamentary election. He obtained 84 votes on first count from both districts, obtaining 0.03% of the overall votes.

Lowell is a staunch supporter and admirer of Carmelo Borg Pisani, the Maltese-born Italian Fascist, who, on the grounds that British rule was destroying Malta&#x27;s Latin soul, advocated the expulsion of the British and joined, to this effect, the National Fascist Party. Pisani was executed for treason by British colonial authorities in 1942. Lowell is known for the quotes &quot;Carmelo Borg Pisani, presente!&quot; and &quot;Onore a Carmelo Borg Pisani!&quot; during a tribute to him in an interview on the television network One, where Lowell, during an interview, asked the presenter for a minute to remember Borg Pisani, stood up, and began exclaiming these quotes whilst holding a staff in his hands.

===Political descriptions===
Because of comments denigrating African migrants to the country as well as his reliance on anti-Semitic rhetoric and conspiracy theories about Jews, Lowell has been described as racist, an extremist, and a Nazi sympathizer. Lowell uses the parlance of white nationalists elsewhere and states that he is a racialist. Lowell argues that he is &quot;neither a Nazi nor a Fascist nor a Neo-Nazi&quot; and that he would be &quot;booted out of a Nazi party within five minutes&quot; because he&#x27;s &quot;a strong libertarian&quot;, but he has, nevertheless, described &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; as &quot;The Book&quot; and Adolf Hitler as &quot;The Hero&quot;, and called the Nazi Holocaust a &quot;holy hoax&quot;. He has also praised Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He has also expressed support for eugenics, saying he supports the euthanization of disabled children and &quot;horribly deformed&quot; people.

==Books==
Lowell is the author of &quot;Credo: A Book for the Very Few&quot;, &quot;Imperium Europa – A Book that Changed the World&quot;, &quot;Aristocratic Manifesto for Imperium Europa&quot; (Arktos, 2019), and &quot;Jesus the Usurper: Murderer of Christ&quot;.

==Dionysian Action Painting==
Lowell is an artist in his own abstract style, which he labels &quot;Dionysian Action Painting&quot;. He describes it as an ancient Greek art form based around &quot;intoxication, frenzy, ecstasy, barbaric instincts&quot;. He says it captures feelings, rather than figures, and is the sublimation of the beast in man into art.

==Controversies==
On 27 March 2008 Lowell was sentenced to a two-year jail term, suspended for four years, due to his conviction on three charges of racial hatred, and one charge of insulting the President of Malta. He won the case relating to insults hurled at the President of Malta on grounds of freedom of speech but was also ordered to pay a fine of 500 Euros for racist terminology against Jews. Judge Quintano ruled that while a politician is free, this freedom is limited by the fact that Jews make up a part of the Maltese society and that no matter how small that part is, such talk constitutes racial hatred.

Speaking outside the courthouse, Lowell told reporters, and a small crowd, &quot;this is a sad day, a very sad day for the Maltese. The lights of freedom have been extinguished. We are going back to the medieval ages. The media will be the first victims of the establishment since they have to be extra careful on how they report items.&quot;

On 10 January 2006 Lowell filed a civil libel suit against &quot;Malta Today&quot; editor Saviour Balzan. Lowell contends that two of the publication&#x27;s articles, one entitled &quot;Norman Lowell organises BBQ&quot;, and another entitled &quot;Lowell’s neo-Nazis hit out at press after arson attack&quot;, as well as an editorial entitled &quot;Get the bastards now, before it is too late&quot;, constitute a &quot;coordinated, strategic, and orchestrated&quot; effort to undermine his public reputation.

On 30 April 2019, during a meeting of his party, Imperium Europa, Lowell compared Auschwitz concentration camp to the &quot;Disneyland of Poland&quot;. When asked whether he denied the Holocaust happened, he said: &quot;How can one deny something that never happened? ... This whole hoax is the biggest lie since the Virgin Mary.&quot;

<text>Xenotime is a rare-earth phosphate mineral, the major component of which is yttrium orthophosphate (YPO4). It forms a solid solution series with chernovite-(Y) (YAsO4) and therefore may contain trace impurities of arsenic, as well as silicon dioxide and calcium. The rare-earth elements dysprosium, erbium, terbium and ytterbium, as well as metal elements such as thorium and uranium (all replacing yttrium) are the expressive secondary components of xenotime. Due to uranium and thorium impurities, some xenotime specimens may be weakly to strongly radioactive. Lithiophyllite, monazite and purpurite are sometimes grouped with xenotime in the informal &quot;anhydrous phosphates&quot; group. Xenotime is used chiefly as a source of yttrium and heavy lanthanide metals (dysprosium, ytterbium, erbium and gadolinium). Occasionally, gemstones are also cut from the finest xenotime crystals.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;xenotime&quot; is from the Greek words () &#x27;vain&#x27; and () &#x27;honor&#x27;, akin to &#x27;vainglory&#x27;. It was coined by French mineralogist François Sulpice Beudant as a rebuke of another scientist, Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius, for the latter&#x27;s premature claim to have found in the mineral a new chemical element (later understood to be previously discovered yttrium). The criticism was blunted, as over time &quot;kenotime&quot; was misread and misprinted &quot;xenotime&quot; with the error suggesting the etymology () + () as &#x27;different honor&#x27;. Xenotime was first described for an occurrence in Vest-Agder, Norway in 1824.

== Properties ==
Crystallising in the tetragonal (I41/amd) crystal system, xenotime is typically translucent to opaque (rarely transparent) in shades of brown to brownish yellow (most common) but also reddish to greenish brown and gray. Xenotime has a variable habit: It may be prismatic (stubby or slender and elongate) with dipyramidal terminations, in radial or granular aggregates, or rosettes. A soft mineral (Mohs hardness 4.5), xenotime is—in comparison to most other translucent minerals—fairly dense, with a specific gravity between 4.4–5.1. Its lustre, which may be vitreous to resinous, together with its crystal system, may lead to a confusion with zircon (ZrSiO4), the latter having a similar crystal structure and with which xenotime may sometimes occur.

Xenotime has two directions of perfect prismatic cleavage and its fracture is uneven to irregular (sometimes splintery). It is considered brittle and its streak is white. The refractive index of xenotime is 1.720–1.815 with a birefringence of 0.095 (uniaxial positive). Xenotime is dichroic with pink, yellow or yellowish brown seen in the extraordinary ray and brownish yellow, grayish brown or greenish brown seen in the ordinary ray. There is no reaction under ultraviolet light. While xenotime may contain significant amounts of thorium or uranium, the mineral does not undergo metamictization like sphene or zircon would.

== Occurrence ==
Occurring as a minor accessory mineral, xenotime is found in pegmatites and other igneous rocks, as well as gneisses rich in mica and quartz. Associated minerals include biotite and other micas, chlorite group minerals, quartz, zircon, certain feldspars, analcime, anatase, brookite, rutile, siderite and apatite. Xenotime is also known to be diagenetic: It may form as minute grains or as extremely thin (less than 10 μ) coatings on detrital zircon grains in siliciclastic sedimentary rocks. The importance of these diagenetic xenotime deposits in the radiometric dating of sedimentary rocks is only beginning to be realised.

Discovered in 1824, xenotime&#x27;s type locality is Hidra (Hitterø), Flekkefjord, Vest-Agder, Norway. Other notable localities include: Arendal and Tvedestrand, Norway; Novo Horizonte, São Paulo, Novo Horizonte, Bahia and Minas Gerais, Brazil; Madagascar and California, Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and New Hampshire, United States. A new discovery of gemmy, colour change (brownish to yellow) xenotime has been reported from Afghanistan and been found in Pakistan. North of Mount Funabuse in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, a notable basaltic rock is quarried at a hill called Maru-Yama: crystals of xenotime and zircon arranged in a radiating, flower-like pattern are visible in polished slices of the rock, which is known as &quot;chrysanthemum stone&quot; (translated from the Japanese 菊石 &quot;kiku-ishi&quot;). This stone is widely appreciated in Japan for its ornamental value.

Small tonnages of xenotime sand are recovered in association with Malaysian tin mining, etc. and are processed commercially. The lanthanide content is typical of &quot;yttrium earth&quot; minerals and runs about two-thirds yttrium, with the remainder being mostly the heavy lanthanides, where the even-numbered lanthanides (such as Gd, Dy, Er, or Yb) each being present at about the 5% level, and the odd-numbered lanthanides (such as Tb, Ho, Tm, Lu) each being present at about the 1% level. Dysprosium is usually the most abundant of the even-numbered heavies, and holmium is the most abundant of the odd-numbered heavies. The lightest lanthanides are generally better represented in monazite while the heaviest lanthanides are in xenotime.

<text>Stefan Effenberg (; born 2 August 1968) is a German former footballer who most recently acted as sporting director for KFC Uerdingen 05. A midfielder, he was known for his leadership skills, passing range, shooting ability, and physical strength, but was also a temperamental and controversial character.

In the Bundesliga alone – where he represented Bayern Munich most notably, in six seasons and in two different spells – Effenberg collected 109 yellow cards, an all-time record at the time of his retirement. With Bayern, he won three Bundesligas and captained the club to the UEFA Champions League title in 2001.

In a career which was cut short after a run-in with the management, Effenberg played for Germany on more than 30 occasions, representing the nation in UEFA Euro 1992 and the 1994 FIFA World Cup. His nickname is &quot;Der Tiger&quot; (, &quot;the tiger&quot;).

==Club career==
Born and raised in Niendorf, Hamburg on 2 August 1968, Stefan Effenberg started his professional career with Borussia Mönchengladbach, where he became an undisputed first-choice by the age of 20. This attracted the interest of Bundesliga giants FC Bayern Munich, where he scored 19 goals in his first two seasons after his transfer, although the club failed to win any silverware with Effenberg in the lineup.

When Lothar Matthäus, who also represented Mönchengladbach, returned to Bayern in 1992, Effenberg moved to ACF Fiorentina. Despite the presence of Brian Laudrup and Gabriel Batistuta, Fiorentina was relegated from Serie A in his first season. Effenberg stayed on in the second flight, winning promotion back at the first attempt.

In the summer of 1994, Effenberg then moved back to Gladbach, where he appeared in 118 league matches, scoring 23 goals, before Bayern re-signed him in 1998. Effenberg&#x27;s second spell with the Bavarians was much more successful. He collected three Bundesliga titles in a row, and Bayern also reached two UEFA Champions League finals, the first of which was a 2–1 defeat to Manchester United F.C. in 1999. Bayern returned to the final in 2001 with Effenberg as captain. He scored Bayern&#x27;s equalising goal from the penalty spot in a victory against Valencia (1–1, penalty shootout win). After the final, Effenberg was named the Most Valuable Player of the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League. After his departure, club fans voted him one of the eleven greatest Bayern players of all time.

After an unsuccessful spell at VfL Wolfsburg, Effenberg ended his career in Qatar with Al-Arabi Sports Club, with Gabriel Batistuta as his teammate. He appeared occasionally as a color commentator for German TV after his retirement as a player.

==Managerial career==
Effenberg was appointed as the head coach of SC Paderborn on 13 October 2015. He was sacked on 3 March 2016.

On 10 October 2019, KFC Uerdingen 05 presented Effenberg as the new sporting director. Following a few troubled months which included the team briefly staying at an Italian hotel with no football pitch for a mid-season training camp, he stepped back from this position prematurely in May 2020.

==International career==
Effenberg played 35 games for the Germany national team and scored five goals. His debut came on 5 June 1991, in a Euro 1992 qualifier against Wales, as he played the last 18 minutes of a 1–0 away loss. He would be an everpresent fixture during the final stages, even netting in the second group stage match, a 2–0 win over Scotland.

During a group game against South Korea in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Effenberg &quot;gave the finger&quot; to German fans at the Cotton Bowl in the 35 °C (95 °F) heat of Dallas when he got substituted after a subpar performance; the Germans were then only one goal up, after leading 3–0. German coach Berti Vogts was so outraged by this incident that he dropped Effenberg from the team on the spot, and declared that he was finished as an international player.

Effenberg did not appear in another international match again until 1998, when he was briefly reinstated to the national team for a couple of friendly matches in Malta in September, which happened to be Vogts&#x27; last two matches as national team coach. They turned out to be his last caps for Germany.

==Controversies and personal life==
Effenberg had a history of attracting attention and ire from fans, managers, and players alike with his behaviour.

In 1991, prior to a UEFA Cup game against then-semi-professional Cork City, Effenberg told the press he was sure of a victory, saying Cork City midfielder Dave Barry was &quot;like (his) grandfather&quot;. Barry got his retribution by scoring the opening goal in the team&#x27;s 1–1 draw at Musgrave Park.

In the late 1990s, Effenberg, already married to Martina, provoked animosity when his affair with Claudia Strunz, the wife of former club and national teammate Thomas Strunz, was revealed.
Effenberg published a controversial autobiography, notorious for its blatant contents – which included lashing out at some other football professionals, namely club and national teammate Lothar Matthäus.

In 2001, Effenberg was fined after being found guilty of assaulting a woman in a nightclub. The following year, he implied that unemployed people in Germany were too lazy to look for work, and demanded they took benefit cuts. The interview was issued in &quot;Playboy&quot;.

Strunz and Effenberg were married in 2004, and the player also had three children from his first marriage; the couple then relocated to Florida.

<text>Elisabeth Lupka (27 October 1902 – 8 January 1949) was a Nazi female guard at two prison camps during World War II.

Lupka was born in Klein-Damner, German Empire (present-day Dąbrówka Mała, Lubusz Voivodeship, Poland). She got married in 1934, had no children and soon divorced. In 1937 she went to Berlin to work in an aircraft factory.

In 1942 she left her menial job as a labourer and went to Ravensbrück concentration camp to undergo training as a camp guard. Lupka graduated and later became an &quot;Aufseherin&quot; over several work details. In March 1943, she was assigned to the German Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in Poland as an Aufseherin then as a &quot;Blockführerin&quot; (Block Overseer), where she physically beat many prisoners with a whip and selected many others for the gas chambers. She stayed in the camp until its last evacuations in early January 1945 and accompanied a death march to Loslau. Lupka returned to Ravensbrück later that same month.

On 6 June 1945, Lupka was arrested by Allied troops and sent to an internment camp. Two years later, on 6 July 1948, after a long investigation, she appeared at a Kraków court for war crimes, mainly the maltreatment of prisoners and her involvement in selections of inmates to the gas chambers. Lupka was found guilty, and executed by short-drop hanging on 8 January 1949 at Montelupich Prison in Kraków. Her corpse was sent to Jagiellonian University in Krakow for use by medical students.

<text>Voices (&quot;Icelandic: Röddin&quot;) is a 2006 translation of a 2003 crime novel by Icelandic author Arnaldur Indriðason, in his Detective Erlendur series. It was first published in English in August 2006. The Swedish translation of the novel (&quot;Änglarösten&quot;) won Sweden&#x27;s Martin Beck Award for the best crime novel in translation.

An old hotel doorman, preparing to dress up as Father Christmas, is found stabbed to death in a compromising position in his miserable small room. Detective Erlendur, who hits a wall of disinterest while trying to find answers, books a room in the hotel. The more he discovers of the past of the deceased, and the more demimonde figures he meets in that allegedly decent hotel, the more phantoms he reveals from his own past.

<doc id="1290136" wikidata="Q5137637" url="?curid=1290136" title="Coaching stock of Ireland">
<text>A wide variety of hauled coaches have been used on the railways of Ireland. This page lists all those since 1945.

==Republic of Ireland==
When formed in 1945, CIÉ inherited from its constituents a motley collection of coaching stock from various manufacturers, in equally variegated conditions of repair. Although many were over 40 years old they had to remain in service until a programme of replacement could be found.

CIÉ, which controlled the Republic&#x27;s railways between 1945 and 1987, and its subsidiary, Iarnród Éireann (IÉ) from 2 February 1987, have made great use of hauled coaches, though in recent years IÉ has turned increasingly to multiple units to replace old locomotives and coaches. IÉ and Northern Ireland Railways jointly own the current stock used on the &quot;Enterprise&quot; service between Dublin and Belfast, with IÉ nominally owning the odd-numbered vehicles and NIR the even-numbered ones, though all share a common &quot;Enterprise&quot; livery.

===Current stock===
====De Dietrich (1997–present)====


Following the introduction of the new Class 201 locomotives, the jointly operated &quot;Enterprise&quot; service between Dublin and Belfast was upgraded in September 1997 with new coaching stock from French train makers De Dietrich Ferroviaire (now Alstom DDF). The interiors of the new stock were based on that of the original rolling stock used by Eurostar.

The coaches are divided into two classes: Standard, with 2 + 2 seating and &quot;First Plus&quot;, with 2 + 1 seating, individual reading lamps and power adjustable seating with &quot;in seat&quot; audio. All coaches are air conditioned, have powered internal and external doors, tinted windows with adjustable blinds, a single wheelchair accessible toilet with baby changing facilities and electronic information displays.

Until September 2012, electrical power for train HVAC, battery charging and cooking was supplied from the locomotive&#x27;s Head End Power system as the sets did not include a Generator Van. In order to avoid further damage to the locomotives, four Mark 3 Generator Vans entered service on the date above mentioned.

Although originally ordered as four sets of seven cars, the three in-service sets may comprise eight or nine cars:
* One DVT (No&#x27;s 9001 to 9004), with Driving Cab, luggage area, 29 &quot;First Plus&quot; seats &amp; wheelchair space, weight 42 tonnes (46.5 tons)
* One &quot;First Plus&quot; (No&#x27;s 9101 to 9104) with 47 seats, weight 
* One Café / Buffet, (No&#x27;s 9401 to 9404), weight 
* One Standard (No&#x27;s 9213 to 9216) with 68 seats &amp; wheelchair space, weight 
* Three or four Standard (No&#x27;s 9201 to 9212) with 71 seats, weight 
* One Generator van (No&#x27;s 9602, 9604, 9606, 9608)
Each carriage is long, tall and wide.
The odd numbered vehicles are owned by IÉ and the even numbered by NIR

The trains have a maximum speed of , but are limited to .

On 12 and 22 December 2009, NIR received the first two, 7608 and 7613, of four Mark 3 Generator vans from IÉ for repainting in Enterprise livery. The other two Generator vans arrived in early 2010. They replaced the HEP power system when they were introduced to revenue service in September 2012, then numbered 5560 89-89604 (9602), 89605 (9604), 89608 (9606) and 89613 (9608).

In 2014, a mid-life refurbishment programme was announced for the Enterprise service. Rotating refurbishment involved substituting non-Enterprise trainsets on an individual basis which began in November 2014 with the return to service of the first revamped coaches in November 2015. Refurbishment provided new mechanical running gear, in coach electronics and modernised interiors. The first refurbished set, consisting of DVT 9002 and Locomotive 206, operated a trial service from York Road Depot in Belfast to Dublin Connolly and back, on 15 October 2015. The same set operated the first official passenger service after its refurbishment on 16 November 2015. The refurbishment was officially completed on 10 April 2016, to coincide with the introduction of an enhanced Enterprise timetable.

==== Mark 3 (2009–present) ====

Although the majority of the Mark 3 stock was withdrawn by Iarnród Éireann in 2009, a handful of vehicles remain in use. In 2012, following extensive refurbishment, and modification to make them compatible with the existing De Dietrich stock, a total of four Mark 3 generator vans entered service with Enterprise to replace the need for the provision of Head-end power by the 201 Class locomotive.

==== Mark 4 (2006–present) ====

67 Mark 4 coaches were delivered in 2006 from CAF. 

Although the name &quot;Mark 4&quot; has entered common usage, these trains have no connection to the British Rail Mark 4.
Though capable of in operation, this higher speed would require both track &amp; signal system upgrade and the provision of a faster locomotive than the currently used 201 class. 

A possibility being considered is the replacement of the existing 201 with two power cars, one of which would be converted from the existing Generator Control Car.

Seating capacity is 422 (8-car set) and the train is fully accessible to mobility-impaired customers.

Capable of 10-car operation, each in-service set currently comprises 7 or 8 cars:
* Generator Control Car – GC (4001–4008) (or DVT) (no seating)
* One First Class – FC (4201–4208) (44 seats + 1 wheelchair)
* One Catering Car – CC (4401–4408) (28 seats)
* Four Standard Class – SC (35 in 4101–4143) (69 seats + 1 wheelchair)
* One Standard End – SCE, (8 in 4101–4143, all numbers ending with 5 or 0), with retractable buffers &amp; drop-head buckeye coupling at locomotive end.
* Length between couplers – 
* Height – 
* Width – 

As of 2016, six sets are operated on the Dublin-Cork route&#x27;s clockface timetable. On some off-peak services smaller 22000 Class sets are used since larger sets are expensive to operate.

===Former stock===
====Laminate (1955–1984)====

The older CIÉ stock comprised a variety of designs, built to two distinct profiles. The carriages built in the early 1950s had a narrower, more vertical profile with a small tumblehome similar to that used by Edgar Bredin of the Great Southern Railways for its steel panelled coaches. The carriages built from the end of the 1950s had a wider profile with a more pronounced tumblehome. Like the &quot;Bredins&quot;, they were wooden framed and steel panelled.

The earlier coaches included the last &quot;compartment stock&quot; built by CIÉ, both standard and composite first/standard designs. Typically there were 7 compartments per carriage with each having seating for 6 passengers in first class and 8 passengers in standard. In the open saloon designs, as well as the compartment designs, seats were aligned to windows and so passengers could enjoy an unobstructed view out of the train from all seats unlike the airline style seat arrangement in some more recent designs.

Carriages of this design built after 1955 were referred to as &quot;laminates&quot; due to the use of laminated wooden uprights and roof members, as opposed to solid wood. Otherwise, construction details were the same. Dining cars continued to be built with solid wood frames, but were often incorrectly termed &quot;laminates&quot; as they were the same design and era.

Some of the &quot;Laminate&quot; carriages were later converted to steam heating vans to allow the four-wheel and six-wheel heating vans to be withdrawn in the late 1970s and early 1980s. All of CIÉ&#x27;s restaurant cars prior to the Mark 2 stock were of the vertical profile design. A brake standard design was adapted as a driving trailer for use on one of CIÉ&#x27;s branch lines.

There were three varieties of the later wide body profile coaches:
* A composite (all later converted to brake standards)
* A standard open design with two lavatories at one end
* A standard open design with a single lavatory at each end

Although designed for long-distance operation, the &quot;Laminate&quot; stock was extensively redeployed on Dublin and Cork suburban services in the 1970s and 1980s as newer rolling stock became available. This was not ideal due to the layout of the carriages and limited door openings, which resulted in longer dwell times at stations. Following the Buttevant crash in 1980, the &quot;Laminate&quot; and Park Royal stock was restricted to a top speed and later banned from certain routes.

After the electrification of the Howth-Bray route in 1984 and the introduction of Mark 3 stock, the &quot;Laminate&quot; stock was progressively withdrawn. Some have been preserved at various locations around Ireland: 
* Downpatrick and County Down Railway has Buffet Car 2419 and Brake Standard 1918TL (originally 2163).
* Kiltamagh Museum has Standard Open 1460 and Composite 2148
* The Railway Preservation Society of Ireland in Dublin has Standard 1463, Bar Car 2421 and Brake 3rd 1916. The RPSI also owns Buffet Car 2422TL, which is on display at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum.
* Sligo Folk Park in Riverstown has Standard Open 1468 

====Park Royal (1955–1994)====
In 1955 Inchicore Works commenced the construction of 50 coaches from parts supplied by Park Royal Vehicles, London. These coaches were produced in Main Line or Suburban variants, and made full use of the Irish loading gauge, being long and wide, narrowing by at their ends.

Because of their aluminium and steel construction, they weighed only tare (Suburban) and approx. tare (Main Line). Unusually, these coaches had inward opening doors, similar to the American &quot;Pullman&quot; design, but this proved unpopular and somewhat confusing to the passengers and so were rebuilt conventionally. The suburban coach seated 82, while the main line coach, fitted with lavatories, seated 70 passengers. These coaches rode on Commonwealth bogies, the first in Ireland to be so fitted.

Barred from certain routes during the early 1990s because of their construction, the last few Park Royal carriages were withdrawn following the delivery of the first Japanese 2600 Class DMUs in 1994.

There are several preserved examples;
* The RPSI has two, two Open 3rds, Nos.1383 and 1419. No. 1383 is fitted with a shop, whilst No.1419 has been modified so as to be wheelchair compatible.
* No.1944 has been fully restored at the Downpatrick &amp; Co. Down Railway and is now part of the passenger running set
* Two are displayed at the Clonakilty Model Village

Livery

When built, these coaches received the standard CIÉ &quot;ivy – leaf&quot; green livery. In the early 1960s, they were re-painted in the new black, orange, and white colour scheme.

==== Cravens (1963–2006) ====

In spring 1961, CIÉ sought tenders for the supply of 40 new Standard Class coaches, 10 to be delivered complete, the rest &quot;part-finished&quot; for assembly in Inchicore with technical assistance from the suppliers. The £500,000 contract was awarded to Cravens of Sheffield. It was reported that these new vehicles &quot;would set a pattern for future construction of CIÉ carriage stock.&quot; The first of the Sheffield-built coaches was unloaded at the North Wall, Dublin on 3 May 1963 and taken to Inchicore for acceptance.

These coaches were built with light alloy bodies on steel underframes on Type B4 bogies.
Each saloon had 64 seats, arranged in eight bays of four around a table, either side of a central gangway, with two toilets situated in the vestibule at one end. The interior was finished in laminated plastics, creating a light and airy feel. They were fitted with a public address system, double-glazed windows and central fluorescent lighting along their length, the first coaches in Ireland to be so treated. Heating was by steam, supplied from a Steam Heating Van.
They were long, wide, high, weighed . and were numbered 1504 to 1513. The 30 incomplete coaches were numbered 1514–1543, and although the total order was for 70, only 15 more (numbered 1544–1558) were built to a total of 55.

During early 1963, Inchicore commenced construction of two new First Class coaches in a style similar to, but not connected with, the Craven contract. These coaches were built with an open plan format, double-glazing and air conditioning. Numbered 1145 and 1146, they were the only post-war all-first class coaches to be added to the stock, their immediate predecessor, 1144, was built in 1935.

On 2 April 1964 the new coaches were demonstrated to the press and entered service on 10 April, working the 18.30 Dublin to Cork train. They were common on high capacity specials, with 14 vehicle trains (12 &quot;Cravens&quot; + 2 Gen Vans) not being atypical, with a capacity of 768 passengers.

Prior to their displacement on these services by railcars, right into the 2000s the Cravens could be found on outer suburban workings, such as those from Dublin to Arklow and Longford. They could also be found on rural services such as those on the Rosslare-Waterford-Limerick route and the Mallow to Tralee line.

Throughout 2006 a phased withdrawal of the Craven stock took place. Their final regular duties were &quot;Fridays Only&quot; workings from Dublin Heuston to Cork, Galway, Limerick and Tralee and their return. They were also occasionally used for rugby union and football match specials and other one-off services.

The final set in scheduled service was withdrawn on 11 December 2006 after working the 05:15 Athlone – Dublin Heuston service.
The last operation in IÉ ownership was carriage No.1510 on an RPSI steam special on 17 December.
Craven Carriage Numbers 1505, 1506, 1508, 1514, 1522, 1523, 1529, 1532, 1539,and 1541 have been preserved in regular use by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI), along with two BR mk1 generator vans, Nos.3173 and 3185.
A &quot;Dutch&quot; type generator van, no.3158 that would have operated with the Cravens stock, has also been preserved by the RPSI, and now runs with their Whitehead based mk2 set as No.462.

Livery
The Sheffield built coaches were outshopped and delivered in the new CIÉ livery of tan below the waist, black on the central panel at window level, roof and ends, with a white band between the upper window and roof. Large, white, class numerals were applied to the doors. The two Inchicore First Class coaches were similarly treated. In the very late 1980s and early 90s, a thin white band about was applied to the waistband, separating the tan and black sections.
Following the re-branding to Irish Rail in 1988, two white vinyl strips were added, separating the black from the tan above and below it. Two reflective Fluorescent Red 3M Scotchcal square panels were applied at each body end.

In preservation the Craven coaches had to be given a paint scheme that was different to the IÉ colours of orange and black, which at the time was still in use on Irish Rail&#x27;s Mark 2 and Mark 3 fleets, to avoid confusing passengers. The first 2 Cravens, 1529 and 1539, had a green colour applied between the windows and the bogies, whilst 1541 ran for one trip in a grey undercoat before returning to Inchicore to be repainted by volunteers into a new allover blue livery with a yellow stripe below the window. A yellow box stripe and the RPSI crest on the side were also added. While this was progressing, all RPSI Cravens had the letters &quot;RPSI&quot; in white applied to the doors on both sides to identify them in both Inchicore and on the rail network. Two more Cravens received the allover blue treatment before Iarnród Éireann took over the repainting of the carriages in 2014. Today, all the Cravens except for 1539 have been outshopped in a new RPSI livery of blue and cream, complete with two RPSI crests on the side of each carriage. It can be noted that snack bar carriage No. 1508 is the only carriage in the set that has been repainted into the new colour scheme by the RPSI Dublin carriage crew, as she was being extensively rebuilt and repaired by the team, who wanted to do the full job themselves.

==== Mark 2 (1972–2008) ====

Mark 2D
In 1972 CIÉ placed an order with British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) for 72 new coaches based on the British Rail Mark 2d design. These were built at Derby Litchurch Lane Works. With air conditioning as a principal feature they became known as &quot;AC Stock&quot; and ran on type B4 bogies, with vacuum brakes.

The order consisted of 6 First Class coaches (5101 to 5106), 9 Composites (5151–5159), 36 Standard Class (5201–5236), 11 Restaurant / Buffet / Standard Class (5401–5411) and 11 Generator Vans (5601–5611). Internal fit-out was done in Inchicore, and was quite different from the original BR design, using bench seating rather than individual seats and made extensive use of wood veneer panelling.

Their electrical system also differed from the BR and NIR versions. The Generator Van contained two engine / generator sets, each supplying 220 / 380 Volts 50 Hz AC to two separate &quot;busses&quot; in the train. The air conditioning loads were divided in half, each half fed from each &quot;bus&quot;. In the case of failure of one generator set, the other set automatically supplies both &quot;busses&quot;. Air conditioning output power would then be halved, but all other loads including Cooking, Lighting and Battery Charging continue to be supplied. This has remained the model for the electrical power supply on all subsequent IE coaches.

To accommodate changes in traffic, five of the Composites, 5153–5156 and 5158 were re-classed as &quot;Standards&quot;, while one of the Restaurant / Buffet / Standards, 5408, was converted for use as the Presidential Coach.

The remaining Mark 2 carriages were gradually phased out during 2007 and 2008, with the last remaining set operating its final service, the 05:05 Athlone – Heuston, on 31 March 2008. Two of these vehicles (Nos. 5106 and 5203) have been preserved by the RPSI and were moved to their Whitehead base in the first quarter of 2008. They were renumbered 303 and 304 respectively, and repainted in RPSI dark green livery. In addition, the Presidential coach No. 5408 is stored by RPSI, still owned by Irish Rail. This vehicle was transported to the RPSI base in Whitehead in 2014.

Mark 2AB
In addition to the vacuum-braked Mark 2D fleet, a second fleet of Mark 2 coaches was used by Irish Rail. These were second hand air-braked Mark 2 coaches acquired in the early 1990s. They were numbered in the 41XX series for standards, or 44XX series for catering vehicles. These coaches were withdrawn around 2003 following the deployment of Class 29000 railcar sets into service. Four of these vehicles have been preserved. 4106 can be found at Kilmeaden station on the Waterford and Suir Valley Railway, while 4108, 4110 and 4402 are preserved at Moyasta Junction on the West Clare Railway. Three &quot;Dutch&quot; type generator vans were converted to airbraking to work with these carriages, re-numbered 4601–4603. One of these, No.4602, is preserved by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland at Whitehead.


Introduced on the CIÉ system in 1984 the last set was withdrawn on Monday 28 September 2009. The decision to purchase a new fleet of modern Intercity coaches based on the British Rail Mark 3 design was made because of several accidents involving the older style, wooden framed, coaches. They were already a well-proven design used for British Rail&#x27;s High Speed Train (HST).

The first 44 Open Standards (7101–44) and five Buffets (7401–05) and seven Generator Vans (7601–07) were built at Derby Litchurch Lane Works. The remainder (7145–72, 7406–13, 7608–15) were built under licence in Inchicore between 1984 and 1989. The coaches ran on 5 ft 3 in gauge versions of British Rail&#x27;s BT22 Air Suspension bogie, and were air-braked.

The Irish Mark 3 coaches were similar, but not identical, to their British counterparts. They had a different electrical system (220/380V, 50 Hz) and were the first Mark 3&#x27;s to be fitted with automatic swing-plug doors. There were also some different internal layouts more specifically suited to Irish traffic.
Twenty-four coaches were built for push-pull operation on the suburban rail service including five built to Control Cars (6101–05, 6301–19). Originally introduced in 1989 in conjunction with the 121 Class locomotives they were last used with 201 Class locomotives. There were a number of differences between the Irish push-pull Mark 3&#x27;s and the standard Mark 3&#x27;s. An underfloor generator, mounted in the Control Car, provided electrical power to the coaches; unlike on the standard Mark 3&#x27;s, which used a special generator van. This single generator was not as powerful as the two used in the Mark 3 generator vans and was the main reason the sets were limited to 6 cars. Irish Mark 3 push-pull based rolling stock did not have air conditioning and had opening windows instead. There was also a 70 mph speed restriction imposed on the train due to the fact that three of the Control Cars were fitted with LHB bogies from an 8100 Class DART and were air-braked.

In 2004, a 1979 vintage British Rail Mark 3 TRFK (Trailer Restaurant First Kitchen) coach was converted by Interfleet into a modern Snack Car for use on a Push-pull set. This set was usually used on the Waterford route.

The Mark 3A &quot;Cú Na Mara&quot; set, now withdrawn, operated exclusively on the Dublin to Galway route, and was originally the BREL International Train, a showcase project designed to secure overseas orders. The set travelled to a German rail exhibition in 1988, but returned without any new orders and languished for some years before being sold on through Vic Berry. CIÉ converted the many different interior layouts to their own standard design (6201–08 ex 99521–22/24–29, Restaurant Buffet 6401 ex 99523), fitted their own Mark 3 type powered door and re-bogied with ABB bogies. Although also re-wired for Push-Pull operation the fact that an additional coach wasn&#x27;t converted to a Driving Brake Standard (planned 6501 ex 99520) prevented the set from ever running with this configuration.

This set marked the end of coach building in Inchicore.

The plug door design found on the CIÉ Mark 3 coaches was later used on the British Rail Class 442 long-distance commuter train.

In 2008, IÉ announced plans to sell off the Mark 3 fleet. and having failed to so do they announced plans to scrap most of them 4 years later in 2012.

All remaining Mark 3 sets were withdrawn from service on 21 September 2009, the final service being a 13:45 Dublin-Cork relief train. However, one set was brought back for a charity event for enthusiasts on 24 April 2010. This tour also formed the 12:40 Limerick – Ennis service train, making this the last passenger service operated by a Mark 3 set.

Two Mark 3 sets were stored at Dundalk post withdrawal and it was reported that their bodies were in such a bad state that they could not be brought to Dublin to be scrapped. Since the poor condition of the coaches precluded their transferral to Dublin for scrap, they were scrapped where they stood in Dundalk yard on 10 February 2014.

Four of the Mark 3 control cars were scrapped except 6105 which is stabled at the West Clare Railway Museum.

The Mark 3&#x27;s had a maximum speed of 100 mph and could run at this speed on the Cork Main Line if a 201 Class was hauling them.

On 12 December 2009, locomotive 144 brought an ex-Mark 3 Generator van (7608) from Dublin to York Road Depot, Belfast. Then again on 22 December 2009, locomotive 8209 brought another ex-Mark 3 Generator van (7613) from Dublin to York Road. NIR received a total of four ex-Mark 3 Generator vans. They have been painted in Enterprise colours and wired with push/pull to run with the Enterprise sets to replace the HEP supplied by the locomotive. These Generator vans entered service in September 2012.

Scrapping of the Mark 3 coaches began in Inchicore Works during September 2013.

Throughout July 2014 the remaining Mark 3&#x27;s in North Wall were taken to Adelaide Yard in Belfast where they were cut in half and transported to Hamills scrap yard in Ahoghill.

In 2014, Belmond, the owners of Venice-Simplon Orient Express, announced plans for a new Irish luxury train named as &quot;Belmond Grand Hibernian&quot;. To operate this service, Belmond procured eleven Mark 3 coaches from Iarnród Éireann for conversion into sleeping, restaurant and parlour cars.

Between August 2016 and 2020, 10 of the Mark 3 carriages owned by Belmond are in service, painted in a dark blue livery. The 11th carriage, still in IÉ InterCity livery, was to be used for spares. It was hauled from North Wall to Inchicore Works in October 2016. Belmond ceased the Grand Hibernian service in 2021. and throughout 2022 the carriages used on the service left Ireland. Later they were redesigned as Belmond&#x27;s new British luxury train &quot;Britannic Explorer&quot;, which is scheduled to run from July 2025.

Three Mark 3 coaches have been preserved and are currently in storage in West Clare Railway Museum, Moyasta Co. Clare. These are Open Standard No. 7146, Café/Bar No. 6402 and Push/Pull DVT no. 6105. Another MkIII was formerly in preservation with the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland at their Whitehead base. Although it was never used by Irish Rail or NIR, being shipped directly over from England in 2004, it had been re-gauged to 5 ft 3 in for use as a dormitory coach for RPSI volunteers. It was numbered 26 by the RPSI, carrying on the numbering sequence of LMS NCC &quot;Caravan Coaches,&quot; and was scrapped by RPSI in 2022.

===Liveries since inception of CIÉ===
==== Carriages ====

The original CIÉ livery was dark green with and eau de nil stripe below and above the windows, similar to the former livery of Dublin United Transport Company Buses, but this was replaced in the mid 1950s. They also carried the &quot;flying snail&quot; emblem in the same eau de nil colour, numerals were the same, and lining, snail and numerals were all themselves thinly lined in gold. From 1955, dark green was discontinued on coaches (though retained on buses) and coaches were gradually repainted in a new lighter green livery, which was also applied to new stock after 1955/6. This was a much lighter mid-green with a thinner &quot;eau-de-nil&quot; (= very light green) stripe applied below windows and the flying snail emblem on some, but by no means all, vehicles. Park Royals never carried flying snails. At the end of 1955 unpainted aluminium coaches were introduced with large red 1s and 2s to indicate class and small red running numbers, but this did not wear well in everyday service. From 1958 all carriages were repainted the new standard green, somewhere in between (English) Southern Region green and Isle of Man 1970s era locomotive green. All CIÉ green livery variations had black coach ends, and while roofs were also usually black, some were occasionally very dark grey.

In 1962, just before the introduction of the &quot;Cravens Stock&quot;, a radical new livery was introduced consisting of black upper panels, roof and body ends, deep orange (golden brown / tan) lower panels with a 6-inch white band between the windows and the roof. Roofs and ends were black. Mk 2d and Mk 3 stock as delivered were painted in a golden brown and black scheme but without the white stripes above the windows.

In February 1987, CIÉ&#x27;s railway operations were transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary, Irish Rail and the 6-inch white band was replaced by two 3-inch white bands, on each side of the black portion. On Craven coaches, a 3in tan band appeared above the top white line, just under the cantrail. The words &quot;InterCity&quot; in large white lettering was added on the lower orange-brown section accompanied by the &quot;IR&quot; logo. Craven coaches and ex-BR Mk 1 generator vans were not re-branded. These continued in CIÉ black and golden brown but the white lining was changed to the narrower style on their next works visit.

In the early 1990s, the golden brown was replaced by a brighter orange (RAL 2011) and the stylised IE icon replaced the IR track logo. The new logo did not accompany the Intercity lettering, but was put on all MK2 and MK3 coach doors.

Because of the shared nature of the service the Enterprise has its own unique livery consisting of Dark Grey (NCS 8502-Y), Light Grey (NCS 5502-Y), Dark Green (NCS 9005-G20Y), Bronze strip &amp; Enterprise logos (3M), and either Purple (NCS 5040-R40B) for Standard Class &quot;or&quot; Dark Red (NCS 4060-R10B) for First Plus.

In 2006, a new livery reminiscent of the original green has been introduced on the CAF Mark 4s. Consisting of Fern Green (NCS 4550-G), Grey (RAL 7000), Yellow (RAL 1021), Black (RAL 9005), Green (NCS 7020- B70G), Yellow Green (NCS 1070 G60Y) &amp; Metallic Silver (761). A new logo has also been introduced to match.

====Freight====
Wagons were plain grey until around 1971, then gradually repainted Oxide brown and departmental stock a dull grey. Whether grey or brown, all CIÉ wagons (as with virtually all Irish freight stock of all companies) had ironwork, roofs, drawgear and chassis the same colour as the body – not picked out in black as occasionally seen elsewhere.

==Northern Ireland==

Although the majority of passenger services in Northern Ireland have been worked by diesel multiple units since the mid-1950s, a number of hauled coaches have been required under the tenure of both the Ulster Transport Authority (1948–1966) and Northern Ireland Railways (since 1967).

In 1970, NIR purchased a fleet of eight new-build Mark 2B&#x27;s to run with the 101 Class on the cross-border Enterprise service. These were painted in a maroon and blue livery and were fitted for push-pull running. Between 1981 and 1983, to complement the arrival of the 111 Class and enhance the Enterprise service, NIR purchased 12 second-hand Mark 2s, of the B, C and F varieties, from British Rail. Some of the 1970-built coaches were refurbished for use in the new service. In the final years before the withdrawal of the 101&#x27;s in 1989, they worked with Mark 2s to form suburban push-pull trains. Further Mark 2B&#x27;s and F&#x27;s were ordered in 1989 as part of a modernisation scheme by NIR. One notable vehicle was Mark 2F No. 904, which retained its British Rail livery in service with NIR. By 1997, all Mark 2s had been withdrawn following introduction of the DeDietrich rolling stock on the Enterprise. Today, five of these coaches survive – No.&#x27;s 300, 305 and buffet No. 547, all under the ownership of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland, No. 546, in use in England with West Coast Railways as No. 1800, and No. 911 (See below.) A sixth, No. 901, survived in Dalton, England until July 2012 when it was finally scrapped.

From 2001 to 2009, NIR operated a single rake of coaches to supplement the DMU fleet. The total of ten were all built as Mark 2s for British Rail, and were purchased by NIR in three batches:
* Generator Van – the set has a single generator van converted from a Mark 2 BFK that was purchased and converted in 1981.
* Passenger coaches – the main part of the set is formed from eight Class 488 unpowered trailers previously operated on the Gatwick Express, which were purchased in 2001.
* Driving trailer – a DBSO was purchased in 2006 for use with the train to allow a greater degree of flexibility in its use. This was finally delivered in the summer of 2009.

From 1998, NIR prefixed their numbers with &quot;8&quot; so as to be part of the Translink number series, which incorporates their road vehicles The table below lists the hauled passenger coaches that were in use until June 2009 plus the never used DBSO (This excludes the &quot;De Dietrich&quot; stock jointly owned with IÉ for operating &quot;Enterprise&quot; services between Belfast and Dublin.

All ten coaches have since been withdrawn from service and sold into preservation. The Generator Van and eight passenger vehicles were acquired by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI) in 2014 with the intention of enhancing its Mark 2 fleet, though in 2022 began disposing of the set. The DBSO has been purchased by the Downpatrick and County Down Railway is used as a barrier vehicle to allow a 146 class locomotive to haul the DCDR&#x27;s Class 450 DEMU.

<text>Microsoft Office 2003 (codenamed Office 11) is an office suite developed and distributed by Microsoft for its Windows operating system. Office 2003 was released to manufacturing on August 19, 2003, and was later released to retail on October 21, 2003. The Mac OS X equivalent, Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac was released on May 11, 2004.

New features in Office 2003 include information rights management; new collaboration features; improved support for SharePoint, smart tags, and XML; and extended use of Office Online services. Office 2003 introduces two new programs to the Office product lineup: InfoPath, a program for designing, filling, and submitting electronic structured data forms; and OneNote, a note-taking program for creating and organizing diagrams, graphics, handwritten notes, recorded audio, and text. It also introduces the Picture Manager graphics software to open, manage, and share digital images.

With the release of Office 2003, Microsoft rebranded the Office productivity suite as an integrated system dedicated to information workers. As a result, Microsoft appended the &quot;Office&quot; branding to the names of all programs. Office 2003 is also the first version with support for themes and visual styles, and introduces updated icons. The Office logo was also updated, eliminating the puzzle motif in use since Office 95. Office 2003 is the last version of Office to include the traditional menu bar and toolbar interface across all programs, and also the last version to include the &quot;97 - 2003&quot; file format as the default file format.

Office 2003 is compatible with Windows 2000 SP3 through Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. It is the last version of Microsoft Office to support Windows 2000 SP3+, Windows XP RTM–SP1 and Windows Server 2003 RTM.

Microsoft released a total of three service packs for Office 2003 throughout its lifecycle. Service Pack 1 was released on July 27, 2004, and Service Pack 2 was released on September 27, 2005. Support for Office 2003 ended on April 8, 2014.
==New features==
The core applications, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access, had only minor improvements from Office XP. Outlook 2003 received improved functionality in many areas, including better email and calendar sharing and information display, complete Unicode support, search folders, colored flags, Kerberos authentication, RPC over HTTP, and &quot;Cached Exchange&quot; mode. Another key benefit of Outlook 2003 was the improved junk mail filter. Tablet and pen support was introduced in the productivity applications. Word 2003 introduced a &quot;reading layout&quot; view, document comparison, better change-tracking and annotation/reviewing, a Research Task Pane, voice comments and an XML-based format among other features. Excel 2003 introduced list commands, some statistical functions and XML data import, analysis and transformation/document customization features. Access 2003 introduced a backup command, the ability to view object dependencies, error checking in forms and reports among other features.

Office 2003 features improvements to smart tags such as smart tag Lists, which are defined in XML, by using regular expressions and an extended type library. Smart tag recognition was added to PowerPoint and Access. FrontPage 2003 introduced conditional formatting, &quot;Find and Replace&quot; for HTML elements, new tools for creating and formatting tables and cells, dynamic templates (Dreamweaver), Flash support, WebDAV and SharePoint publishing among other features. Publisher 2003 introduced a Generic Color PostScript printer driver for commercial printing. Information Rights Management capabilities were introduced in document productivity applications to limit access to a set of users and/or restrict types of actions that users could perform. Support for managed code add-ins as VSTO solutions was introduced.

Office 2003 was the last version of Microsoft Office to include fully customizable toolbars and menus for all of its applications, the Office Assistant, the ability to slipstream service packs into the original setup files, Office Web Components, and the &quot;Save My Settings Wizard&quot;, which allowed users to choose whether to keep a locally cached copy of installation source files and several utility resource kit tools. A new picture organizer with basic editing features, called Microsoft Office Picture Manager, was included.

Only basic clipart and templates were included on the disc media, with most content hosted online and downloadable from within the Office application. Microsoft advertised Office Online as a major Office 2003 feature &quot;outside the box&quot;. Office Online provides how-to articles, tips, training courses, templates, clip art, stock photos and media and downloads (including Microsoft and third-party extensibility add-ins for Microsoft Office programs).

Office 2003 features broad XML integration (designing customized XML schemas, importing and transforming XML data) throughout resulting in a far more data-centric model (instead of a document-based one). The MSXML 5 library was introduced specifically for Office&#x27;s XML integration. Office 2003 also has SharePoint integration to facilitate data exchange, collaborated workflow, and publishing. InfoPath 2003 was introduced for collecting data in XML-based forms and templates based on information from databases.

==Removed features==
* Design Time Controls are no longer supported in FrontPage 2003.
* The Access 2.0 database conversion utility is removed from the installation CD and the Client Server Visual Design Tools for Access are no longer included.
* A large number of converters and filters are no longer available on the installation CD. Several international font options are also removed.
* Genigraphics Wizard support and Presentation Broadcasting were removed in PowerPoint 2003. A download for the latter was made available by Microsoft.
* Microsoft Draw Converter and Organization Chart Converter are no longer available.
* The Web Pages wizard is no longer available in Word 2003.
* In Word 2003, the Comments option on the View menu as well as the button on the Comment pane to close the pane were removed.
* Microsoft Photo Editor was removed, including many features not available in its replacement.
* Due to the deprecation of WinHelp, context-sensitive help was removed in Office 2003.
* Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar was removed.

==Editions==
Microsoft released five separate editions of Office 2003: Basic, Student and Teacher, Standard, Small Business, and Professional. Retail editions were available in Full or Upgrade versions. The Basic edition was only available to original equipment manufacturers. The Student and Teacher edition was intended for noncommercial use only. All Office 2003 applications were available for purchase as standalone products.

<text>Microsoft Office XP (codenamed Office 10) is an office suite which was officially revealed in July 2000 by Microsoft for the Windows operating system. Office XP was released to manufacturing on March 5, 2001, and was later made available to retail on May 31, 2001. A Mac OS X equivalent, Microsoft Office v. X was released on November 19, 2001.

New features in Office XP include smart tags, a selection-based search feature that recognizes different types of text in a document so that users can perform additional actions; a task pane interface that consolidates popular menu bar commands on the right side of the screen to facilitate quick access to them; new document collaboration capabilities, support for MSN Groups and SharePoint; and integrated handwriting recognition and speech recognition capabilities. With Office XP, Microsoft incorporated several features to address reliability issues observed in previous versions of Office. Office XP also introduces separate Document Imaging, Document Scanning, and Clip Organizer applications. The Office Assistant (commonly known as &quot;Clippy&quot;), which was introduced in Office 97 and widely reviled by users, is disabled by default in Office XP; this change was a key element of Microsoft&#x27;s promotional campaign for Office XP.

Office XP is compatible with Windows NT 4.0 SP6 through Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 R2. It is the last version of Microsoft Office to support Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 2000 RTM–SP2 and Windows Me.

Office XP received mostly positive reviews upon its release, with critics praising its collaboration features, document protection and recovery functionality, and smart tags; however, the suite&#x27;s handwriting recognition and speech recognition capabilities were criticized and were mostly viewed as inferior to similar offerings from competitors. As of May 2002, over 60 million Office XP licenses had been sold.

Microsoft released three service packs for Office XP during its lifetime. Support for Office XP ended on July 12, 2011.

==History==
At a meeting with financial analysts in July 2000, Microsoft demonstrated Office XP, then known by its codename, Office 10, which included a subset of features Microsoft designed in accordance with what at the time was known as the .NET strategy, one by which it intended to provide extensive client access to various web services and features such as speech recognition. SharePoint Portal Server 2001, then codenamed &quot;Tahoe&quot;, was also in development at this time and was slated to improve collaboration for users of Office 2000 and Office 10. In August, Microsoft released Office 10 Beta 1 for product evaluation purposes. During this period Office 10 was characterized as an interim release between its predecessor, Office 2000 and a future version, and was planned to include new formatting options; integrated speech recognition; improved collaboration capabilities and enhanced support for web services; and a web portal complete with web parts.

Before the release of Office 10 Beta 2, there was speculation that Microsoft intended to rebrand the new product as &quot;Office 2001,&quot; &quot;Office 2002,&quot; &quot;Office.NET,&quot; or &quot;Office XP.&quot; The latter was shorthand for &quot;eXPerience&quot; and was positioned as a brand that would emphasize the new experiences enabled by the product. At the time, Microsoft intended to name the latest version of Visual Studio as &quot;Visual Studio .NET&quot; but unnamed sources stated that the company did not desire to do the same with Office 10, as the product was only partially related to the company&#x27;s .NET strategy. Microsoft ultimately decided on &quot;Office XP&quot; as the final name of the product. In spite of this, individual Office XP products such as Excel, PowerPoint, and Word would continue to use Microsoft&#x27;s year-based naming conventions and were named after the year 2002.

Office XP Beta 2 was released to 10,000 technical testers in late 2000. Beta 2 introduced several improvements to setup tools. The Custom Maintenance Wizard, for example, now allowed setup components to be modified after their installation, and the setup process of Office XP itself used a new version of Windows Installer. After the release of Beta 2, Microsoft announced a Corporate Preview Kit Program for Office XP that would allow up to 500,000 corporate customers to evaluate a Corporate Preview Beta version of the product on a total of 10 machines per copy; individual copies cost $19.95 and expired on August 31, 2001.

Office XP was released to manufacturing on March 5, 2001, and was later made available to retail on May 31, 2001.

===Service packs===
Microsoft released three service packs for Office XP throughout the product&#x27;s lifecycle that introduce security enhancements, stability improvements, and software bug fixes; each service pack could be installed as a separate Client or Full File update version: Client updates are for Office XP CD-ROM installations, were obtainable from Microsoft Office Update or as standalone downloads, and require Office XP installation media—these updates cannot be uninstalled. Full File updates do not require access to installation media and are intended for network administrators to deploy updates to Office XP users who installed the product from a server location; users could also manually install Full File updates. Full File updates require Windows Installer 2.0; Office XP shipped with version 1.1. On September 25, 2001, Microsoft released Windows Installer 2.0 redistributables for Windows 9x, Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.

Service Pack 1 (SP1) included performance and security improvements, as well as stability improvements based on error reports from users. SP1 also resolved an issue that prevented documents from being saved to MSN Groups.

Service Pack 2 (SP2) included all previously available standalone updates; some of those previously released included cumulative security patches for Excel 2002 and Word 2002 to address potentially malicious code embedded in document macros. The Full File version of SP2 is cumulative—SP1 does not have to be installed—while the Client version requires SP1 to be installed. Only Full File updates released after SP2 can be applied directly to Client installations of Office XP. Earlier updates were designed to update only administrative images and fail when applied directly to clients.

Service Pack 3 (SP3) included all previously released updates, as well as previously unreleased stability improvements based on feedback and error reports received from users. SP3 does not require any earlier service packs to be installed. However, if an Office XP client was updated from a patched administrative image, the Full File version of SP3 must be installed.

==New features==
===User interface===
Office XP has a streamlined, flatter appearance compared to previous versions of Office. According to Microsoft, this change involved &quot;removing visually competing elements, visually prioritizing items on a page, increasing letter spacing and word spacing for better readability, and defining foreground and background color to bring the most important elements to the front.&quot;

====Smart tags====
Excel 2002 and Word 2002 introduce &quot;smart tags&quot;, commands for specific types of text including addresses, calendar dates, personal names, telephone numbers, ticker symbols, or tracking numbers in documents. A smart tag is denoted by a dotted purple underline underneath actionable text in a document; hovering over this text with the mouse cursor displays an icon that presents a list of related commands when invoked with a mouse click or the ++ keyboard shortcut. A ticker symbol smart tag in Excel can present the latest stock information in a cell within a workbook, for example, while a contact name smart tag in a Word document can display options to send an e-mail message to—or schedule a meeting with—that contact. Excel and Word support extensible smart tags that allow developers and organizations to display custom commands related to specific information. The smart tags used by Word are also available in Outlook 2002 if the former is configured as the default e-mail editor.

The AutoCorrect and Paste Options commands in previous versions of Office have been updated to include smart tags that are shared among all Office XP programs. The AutoCorrect smart tag provides individual options to revert an automatic correction or to prohibit an automatic correction from occurring in the future, and also provides access to the AutoCorrect Options dialog box. It is represented as a small, blue box when the mouse cursor is positioned over corrected text. The Paste Options smart tag provides options to retain original formatting of content, change the formatting based on the currently active program, or to provide contextually specific characteristics to content after users paste it from the clipboard.

After the release of Office XP, Microsoft provided a repository for downloadable smart tags on its website. Examples of third-party companies that produced smart tags after the release of Office XP include ESPN, Expedia, FedEx, and MSNBC. Microsoft released a Euro Currency Converter smart tag when new euro coins and notes were introduced.

====Task panes====

Office XP introduces a task pane interface that consolidates popular menu bar commands on the right side of the screen to facilitate quick access to them. Office XP includes Startup, Search, Clipboard, and Insert Clip Art task panes, as well as task panes that are exclusive to certain programs. Word 2002, for example, includes a task pane dedicated to style and formatting options. Users can switch between open task panes through the use of back and forward buttons; a drop-down list also presents specific task panes to which users can switch.

The default Startup task pane is automatically available when users launch an Office XP program and presents individual commands to open an existing file, create a new blank file or one from a template, add a network location, or open Office Help. The Search task pane includes individual Basic and Advanced modes and allows users to query local or remote locations for files. The Basic mode allows users to perform full-text searches, while the Advanced mode provides additional file property query options. An index such as the Indexing Service can improve how quickly results are returned after a search is performed.

The Insert Clip Art task pane is available in Excel, FrontPage, PowerPoint, and Word and provides options to search for and insert online clip art into files. The Office Clipboard has been redesigned as the Clipboard task pane across all Office XP programs and can accommodate up to 24 clipboard items compared to 12 in Office 2000. Clipboard items provide a visual representation to help users distinguish different types of content. The Office Clipboard task pane opens when at least two items are copied.

====Other UI changes====
* A Compress Pictures button on the Picture toolbar allows users to optimize images inserted into files.
* E-mail messages sent from all Office XP programs support an optional introductory field.
* Internet Explorer automatically launches the Office XP program used to create a HTML document when users print that document.
* Microsoft account users could store their documents in private or public locations at MSN Groups.
* Office XP introduces a My Data Sources directory in My Documents that provides access to recently opened data sources.
* Security features in all Office programs have been consolidated into a single Security tab.
* The Insert Hyperlink dialog box presents a list of files and folders from the current web page folder, allowing users to navigate between open web pages.
* The Web Options dialog box allows users to create documents tailored to Internet Explorer 4, Internet Explorer 5, Internet Explorer 6, or various versions of Netscape.
* When users revert automatically corrected text in an Office document to its original spelling, the text will not correct itself again.

===File formats===
====XML support====
Access 2002 and Excel 2002 support exporting and importing XML. Users can also save Excel workbooks as XML spreadsheets.

====Office Open XML Compatibility Pack====
Microsoft released a compatibility pack that enables users to open, edit, and save Excel, PowerPoint, and Word Office Open XML documents. The update also enables compatibility with documents created in Office 2010, Office 2013, and Office 2016.

===Alternative user input===

====Handwriting recognition====
Office XP introduces handwriting recognition in all Office programs, allowing users to write with a mouse or stylus instead of entering text by typing on a keyboard. Users can insert handwritten notes into Excel, add handwritten comments to PowerPoint presentations, send handwritten e-mail messages with Outlook, or write directly into Word documents. Notes written with a handheld PC or a Pocket PC can be converted into Word documents, and handwritten content in Word documents can be converted to text. Word must be the active e-mail editor in Outlook before handwritten e-mail messages can be sent.
Once installed, handwriting functionality is also available in Internet Explorer 5 and Outlook Express 5 or later. Handwriting recognition engines are available for the English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean versions of Office XP.

The downloadable Tablet Pack for Office XP provided an extension for Windows Journal to reuse notes as Outlook 2002 items and to import meeting information from Outlook 2002 into notes.

====Speech recognition====
Speech recognition based on Microsoft Research technology is available for all Office XP programs, allowing users to dictate text into active documents, to change document formatting, and to navigate the interface by voice. The speech recognition feature encompasses two different modes: Dictation, which transcribes spoken words into text; and Voice Command, which invokes interface features.

Speech recognition can be installed during Office XP setup or by clicking the Speech option in the Tools menu in Word 2002. When installed, it is available as a Microphone command on the Language toolbar that appears in the upper-right corner of the screen (lower-right corner in East-Asian versions of Office XP). When launched for the first time, speech recognition offers a tutorial to improve recognition accuracy, which begins by providing instructions to adjust the microphone for optimal performance. Speech recognition uses a speech profile to store information about a user&#x27;s voice.

Users can configure speech recognition settings, including pronunciation sensitivity in voice command mode, accuracy and recognition response time in dictation mode, and microphone settings through the Speech control panel applet. The Regional and Language Options applet provides Language toolbar and additional settings. Speech recognition engines are available for the English, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese languages. Microsoft recommended its SideWinder Game Voicechat device as a microphone to use with speech recognition.

===Reliability===
With Office XP, Microsoft incorporated several features to address reliability issues observed in previous versions of Office:
* Application Recovery: Users can safely restart or terminate unresponsive Office programs—and save open documents before termination—from a utility that is accessible from the Office Tools group on the Windows Start menu.
* Automatic Recovery: Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, and Word periodically save open documents in the background so the latest revision can be opened if an error occurs; users can configure how often files are saved, discard the latest revision, overwrite a file with it, or save it as a separate file.
* Document Recovery: Access, Excel, PowerPoint, and Word present users with an option to immediately save open files when an error occurs before a program is closed or restarted to prevent loss of data.
* Error Reporting: Users can optionally submit error report information to Microsoft for analysis to improve Office XP. Error reporting was instrumental in providing solutions included in all three Office XP service packs to address common issues. Error reports can also be submitted to corporate departments.
* Repair and Extract: Excel and Word can automatically recognize and repair corrupt documents; users can also manually repair documents from these programs.
* Safe Mode: Office XP programs will automatically launch in Safe Mode, a diagnostic mode that allows programs to bypass the source of a problem if they are unable to start properly.

===Security===
Excel, PowerPoint, and Word have been updated to provide password encryption options based on CryptoAPI. Additionally, all Office XP programs provide options for users to digitally sign documents.

===Installation and deployment===
When upgrading from a previous version of Office, Office XP retains the user&#x27;s previous configuration. Office XP can also be installed directly from an administrative image hosted on a web server via HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP. The Office Resource Kit includes various improvements to deployment functionality when compared with the Office 2000 version. A new Setup INI Customization Wizard allows administrators to customize the Office XP INI configuration file prior to deployment. The Custom Installation Wizard can prohibit the installation, use, or uninstallation of programs or features such as the &quot;Run from Network&quot; and &quot;Installed on First Use&quot; setup options. Finally, the Custom Maintenance Wizard has been updated to provide customization options to configure Office XP including user preferences and security settings. The Save My Settings Wizard, introduced in Office 2000 as an optional download for Microsoft account users to remotely store their Office settings to the Office Update web site, has been updated to support importing and exporting backups to local storage or to a network share.

In an effort to curtail software piracy, Microsoft incorporated product activation technology into all versions of Office XP to prohibit users from installing a single copy of the software in a manner that violates the end-user license agreement (EULA). The EULA allows a single user to install one copy each on a primary device and a portable device such as a laptop. Users who make substantial hardware changes to an Office XP device may need to reactivate the software through the Internet or by telephone. Product activation does not require personally identifiable information.

Office XP introduced an optional subscription-based activation model that allowed consumers to annually license the product and receive incremental updates at a reduced price when compared with the cost of a full retail version. Microsoft originally intended to deliver the activation model to United States customers after the retail availability of Office XP on May 31, 2001, but later decided to make it available to consumers in &quot;a few select locations&quot; instead, citing a more cautious delivery approach. In spite of this, Microsoft distributed optical media and a single subscription to authorized U.S. retail partners who attended &quot;teamMicrosoft Live!&quot; events. As part of a pilot experiment, consumers in Australia, France, and New Zealand could purchase a subscription for Office XP starting in May 2001; the worldwide release of the activation model was contingent on the success of the pilot experiment, but Microsoft terminated support for subscriptions in 2002 based on feedback and research that demonstrated it was not well understood by consumers. Office 365—released over a decade after Office XP—has since reintroduced subscription-based licenses to consumers.

===User assistance===
A new &quot;Ask a Question&quot; feature appears in the top-right corner of all Office XP programs and allows users to type natural language questions and receive answers without opening the Office Assistant (&quot;Clippy&quot;) or Office Help. Additionally, Office Help has been updated to aggregate and display content from the Internet in response to a query. The Office Assistant is now disabled by default and only appears when Help is activated.

Additionally, a Special Edition upgrade-only version was released with an Office XP-branded IntelliMouse Explorer, and some copies included Office XP Media Content on a separate disk.

==System requirements==
==Reception==
Microsoft Office XP received mixed to positive reviews after its release. &quot;CNET&quot; praised the new collaboration and data recovery features and stated that Office XP offered a &quot;host of incremental improvements&quot; over its predecessor, Office 2000, but ultimately concluded that &quot;most enhancements and additions are better suited for groups than individuals.&quot; Criticism was also directed at the productivity suite&#x27;s strict hard disk space requirement. Nevertheless, CNET awarded Office XP a 4-star editors&#x27; rating. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; rated Office XP 4 stars out of 5 and praised the product&#x27;s emphasis on user control, particularly in regards to customization options for features introduced in previous versions, and regarded it as &quot;one of the few Microsoft upgrades that offers almost no pains with its significant gains.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Office XP &quot;isn&#x27;t so much a list of new features as it is an improved arrangement of old ones,&quot; but offered praise for the new collaboration features, which were regarded as a &quot;huge leap&quot; from previous versions. Paul Thurrott regarded Office XP as &quot;a must-have upgrade for writers such as myself,&quot; though he also stated that, without the new smart tags feature, it &quot;has the feel of a minor upgrade with numerous useful, but small, changes.&quot;

While most assessments of Office XP were positive, the speech recognition feature was frequently criticized due to its inaccuracy and lack of advanced functionality. &quot;CNET&quot; regarded it as &quot;especially lame&quot; because of its inability to recognize text editing commands such as &quot;select the sentence&quot; and because it required users to manually switch between command and dictation modes. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; stated that both the speech recognition and handwriting recognition features were not &quot;reliable enough for general use.&quot; However, in a later assessment, &quot;PC Magazine&quot; stated that the &quot;speech recognition is reasonably accurate, but there are very few commands for editing and correcting text&quot; and recommended Dragon NaturallySpeaking, IBM ViaVoice, or Voice Xpress for dictation. &quot;The New York Times&quot; speculated that Microsoft had little to no confidence in the feature, as it is not installed by default and no microphone is included with Office XP; however, it concluded that it was &quot;not bad for a freebie, especially if you would rather get the first draft down quickly and clean up the recognition errors later.&quot; Paul Thurrott stated that &quot;the voice recognition is so bad it&#x27;s almost not even worth discussing,&quot; concluding that it &quot;is sort of a joke&quot; when compared with mature products such as Dragon NaturallySpeaking.

<doc id="1290146" wikidata="Q371339" url="?curid=1290146" title="Gyfu">
<text>Gyfu is the name for the &quot;g&quot;-rune in the Anglo-Saxon rune poem, meaning &#x27;gift&#x27; or &#x27;generosity&#x27;:

The corresponding letter of the Gothic alphabet is 𐌲 &quot;g&quot;, called &quot;giba&quot;. The same rune also appears in the Elder Futhark, with a suggested Proto-Germanic name *gebô &#x27;gift&#x27;. J. H. Looijenga speculates that the rune is directly derived from Latin Χ, the pronunciation of which may have been similar to Germanic &quot;g&quot; in the 1st century, e.g., Gothic &quot;*reihs&quot; compared to Latin &quot;rex&quot; (as opposed to the Etruscan alphabet, where /𐌗 had a value of ).

The &quot;gyfu&quot; rune is sometimes used as a symbol within modern mysticism, particularly amongst those interested in Celtic mythology. It&#x27;s described, for example, in the book &quot;The Runic Tarot&quot; as a representation of the giving-receiving balance in friendships.

==Anglo-Saxon &quot;gār&quot; rune==
In addition to &quot;gyfu&quot;, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has the &quot;gār&quot; rune , named after a species of medieval spear. It is attested epigraphically on the Ruthwell Cross, and also appears in 11th-century manuscript tradition. Phonetically, &quot;gār&quot; represents the /g/ sound. It is a modification of the plain gyfu rune .

Old English &#x27;gār&#x27; means &#x27;spear&#x27;, but the name of the rune likely echoes the rune names &quot;ger, ear, ior&quot;: due to palatalization in Old English, the original &quot;g&quot; rune (i.e., the &quot;Gyfu&quot; rune ) could express either /j/ or /g/ (see yogh). The &quot;ger&quot; unambiguously expressed /j/, and the newly introduced &quot;gar&quot; rune had the purpose of unambiguously expressing /g/.

&quot;Gār&quot; is the 33rd and final rune in the row as given in Cotton Domitian A.ix.

<text>The People&#x27;s Political Party (PPP) was Jamaica&#x27;s first modern political party. It was formed in 1929 by Marcus Garvey.

The PPP set out a 14 point manifesto—the first of its kind in the island&#x27;s electoral history. The points contained in the PPP&#x27;s manifesto were far-reaching and perceptive as illustrated by a few of them, such as:
* An eight-hour work day
* A minimum wage
* A larger share of self-government
* Protection for native industries
* A legal aid department for the poor
* Technical schools for each parish
* Land reform
* Libraries and civic improvement for parish capitals 
* City status for Montego Bay and Port Antonio
* A National Park at the Kingston Race Course

The PPP contested the 1962 elections, receiving 0.9% of the vote and failing to win a seat. The party did not contest any further elections.

In December 2012, lawyer Michael &quot;Ras Miguel&quot; Lorne was the party leader.

<doc id="1290157" wikidata="Q3874273" url="?curid=1290157" title="Negro World">
<text>Negro World was the newspaper of the Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA). Founded by Garvey and Amy Ashwood Garvey, the newspaper was published weekly in Harlem, and distributed internationally to the UNIA&#x27;s chapters in more than forty countries. Distributed weekly, at its peak, the &quot;Negro World&quot; reached a circulation of 200,000.

Notable editors included Marcus Garvey, T. Thomas Fortune, William H. Ferris, W.A. Domingo and Amy Jacques Garvey.

==Background==
Garvey founded the UNIA in July 1914, and within the organization&#x27;s first few years had started publishing &quot;Negro World&quot;.

Monthly, &quot;Negro World&quot; distributed more copies than &quot;The Messenger&quot;, &quot;The Crisis&quot; and &quot;&quot; (other important African-American publications). Colonial rulers banned its sales and even possession in their territories, including both British Empire and French colonial empire possessions. Distribution in foreign countries was conducted through black seamen who would smuggle the paper into such areas.

&quot;Negro World&quot; ceased publication in 1933.

==Content==
For a nickel, readers received a front-page editorial by Garvey, along with poetry and articles of international interest to people of African ancestry. Under the editorship of Amy Jacques Garvey the paper featured a full page called &quot;Our Women and What They Think&quot;.

&quot;Negro World&quot; also played an important part in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. The paper was a focal point for publication on the arts and African-American culture, including poetry, commentary on theatre and music, and regular book reviews. Romeo Lionel Dougherty, a prominent figure of the Jazz Age, began writing for &quot;Negro World&quot; in 1922.

==Contributors==
Notable editors and contributors to &quot;Negro World&quot; included:
* Duse Mohamed Ali
* John Edward Bruce
* Wilfred Adolphus Domingo
* William Henry Ferris
* Timothy Thomas Fortune
* William Henderson Franklin
* Amy Ashwood Garvey
* Amy Jacques Garvey

<text>Georgy Frantsevich Gause (; December 27, 1910 – May 2, 1986), was a Soviet and Russian biologist and evolutionist, who proposed the competitive exclusion principle, fundamental to the science of ecology. Classic of ecology, he would devote most of his later life to the research of antibiotics.

==Early life==
Gause was born December 27, 1910, in Moscow, Russia to parents Frants Gustavovich Gause, a professor of architecture at Moscow State University, and Galina Gause, an industrial worker at an automotive steel plant. As a boy and into his teenage years, Gause and his extended family took summer vacations to the Caucasus Mountains in southern Russia for months at a time. Although his family was not wealthy, they were allowed these respites because his father, being a government architect, helped to build many structures at the university. It was during these trips to the Caucasus Mountains that Gause grew fond of nature, often chronicling the lives and behavior of several organisms including the Siberian grasshopper (&quot;Aeropus sibiricus&quot;). He became interested in zoology, particularly the animal variability.

==At university==

In 1927 he was admitted to the Biological Division of the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics at Moscow University. The Russian university system requires a faculty advisor for all undergraduate and graduate students. His chosen advisor for his undergraduate career was professor Vladimir Alpatov, who worked at the Zoological Museum of Moscow University. Alpatov, in the mid-1920s, was very impressed by the work of Raymond Pearl, a U.S. demographer who became well-known through his advocacy of the logistic curve. Alpatov brings back a fascination for American science that is very influential on Gause. Gause argued that field work, with too many variables, could never adequately explain this relationship and only in the simplified laboratory environment, where variables could be controlled, would it be possible to determine precisely how a specific ecological factor influences a population. Eager to pursue this mechanistic direction of study and influenced by his advisor, Gause contacted Pearl to see if the American would take on another Russian student. He applied for a fellowship through the Rockefeller Foundation but was denied, perhaps because he was only 22 years old. He then published a monograph &quot;The Struggle for Existence&quot; in 1934 to improve his chances but he was still denied. The monograph had several editions, and it was also translated in French and Japanese languages.

During Alpatov&#x27;s stay in the US, Gause was supervised by Evgenii Smirnov. Interested in the application of statistics in biosystematics, Smirnov promoted these methods to Gause. In that period Gause was investigating the distribution of Orthoptera in the North Caucasus, quantitatively estimating ecoplastisity of species.

Gause earned his BSc at Moscow State University in 1931, and was employed in Alpatov&#x27;s laboratory at the Zoological Institute of Moscow University. He earned his DBiolSc in 1936 for the series of works published in 1930-1934 and compiled as a dissertation titled &quot;Studies on the dynamics of mixed populations&quot;. One of the opponents was Vladimir Vernadsky.

==The struggle for existence by competitive exclusion==
In 1932, Gause published what has become known as the competitive exclusion principle, based on experimental work done with mixed cultures of both yeast and Paramecium species. Aphoristically, it was formulated as &quot;One niche — one species&quot;. The principle asserts that no two species with similar ecological niches can coexist in a stable equilibrium, meaning that when two species compete for exactly the same requirements, one will be slightly more efficient than the other and will reproduce at a higher rate as a result. The fate of the less efficient species is local extinction.

In another series of experiments with the infusorians &quot;Paramecium&quot; as prey and &quot;Didinium&quot; as a predator, imitating periodical migrations, he obtained nearly ideally sinusoidal fluctuations of the abundances in this model, previously modeled only theoretically. It appeared in English as an abridged version in USA, and finally published in Russian only in 1984.

One of the first acceptances of the advantages of polycultures was also obtained by Gause on &quot;Paramecium&quot;. He studied ecologically similar species of infusorians. Keeping them as monocultures he obtained higher abundances of individual species than in polyculture. Meanwhile, significantly higher was the overall abundance of the polyculture.

In 1940 Gause prepares a monograph &quot;Ecology and some problems of the origin of species&quot;. The original manuscript in Russian was not published due to start of the World War II in the Soviet Union. It appeared in as an abridged version in USA, and finally published in Russian only in 1984.

==Protoplasm asymmetry==

In the 1930s Gause conducted a series of studies, dedicated to the protoplasm asymmetry. These works raised interest among biogeochemists, including V.V. Vernadsky.

==The search for new antibiotics==
From 1939 Gause began studies of antibiotics. Seemed like a sudden change in research topic, but this was a development of his interests in the struggle for survival, and antibiotic activity was a mean. Later he focuses his research on practical applications for his new principle and turns to microbiology and medical science. Working with a strain of &quot;Bacillus brevis&quot;, he noticed an inhibition on the growth of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; when the two were in mixed culture. The inhibition of &quot;S. aureus&quot; was caused by a metabolite produced by &quot;B. brevis&quot;. Gause isolated this product and named it Gramicidin S. The antibiotic went into mass production during World War II and saved many lives. For his part in its development, Gause was awarded the Stalin Prize and named director of the Institute for New Antibiotics in Moscow in 1946. As director, Gause helped to design and manufacture many novel antibiotics of which a few had anti-tumor capacities. Due to such abrupt change in scientific interests many biologists failed to unite the evolutionist and the microbiologist in one personality.

<doc id="1290184" wikidata="Q11682630" url="?curid=1290184" title="Hubert Harrison">
<text>Hubert Henry Harrison (April 27, 1883 – December 17, 1927) was a West Indian-American writer, orator, educator, critic, race and class conscious political activist, and radical internationalist based in Harlem, New York. He was described by activist A. Philip Randolph as &quot;the father of Harlem radicalism&quot; and by the historian Joel Augustus Rogers as &quot;the foremost Afro-American intellect of his time.&quot; John G. Jackson of American Atheists described him as &quot;The Black Socrates&quot;.

An immigrant from St. Croix at the age of 17, Harrison played significant roles in the largest radical class and race movements in the United States. In 1912–14, he was the leading Black organizer in the Socialist Party of America. In 1917 he founded the Liberty League and &quot;The Voice&quot;, the first organization and the first newspaper of the race-conscious &quot;New Negro&quot; movement. From his Liberty League and &quot;Voice&quot; came the core leadership of individuals and race-conscious program of the Garvey movement.

Harrison was a seminal and influential thinker who encouraged the development of class consciousness among workers, black pride, agnostic atheism, secular humanism, social progressivism, and freethought. He was also a self-described &quot;radical internationalist&quot; and contributed significantly to the Caribbean radical tradition. Harrison profoundly influenced a generation of &quot;New Negro&quot; militants, including A. Philip Randolph, Chandler Owen, Marcus Garvey, Richard Benjamin Moore, W. A. Domingo, Williana Burroughs, and Cyril Briggs.

==Early life==
Hubert was born to Cecilia Elizabeth Haines, a working-class woman, on Estate Concordia, St. Croix, Danish West Indies. His biological father, Adolphus Harrison, was born enslaved. One account from the 1920s suggested that Harrison&#x27;s father owned a substantial estate. Harrison&#x27;s biographer, however, found no such landholding and writes that &quot;there is no indication that Adolphus, a laborer his entire life, ever owned, or even rented, land&quot;. As a youth, Harrison knew poverty but also learned of African customs and the Crucian people&#x27;s rich history of direct action mass struggles. Among his schoolmates was his lifelong friend, the future Crucian labor leader and social activist, D. Hamilton Jackson.

In later life Harrison worked with many Virgin Islands-born activists, including James C. Canegata, Anselmo Jackson, Rothschild Francis, Elizabeth Hendrikson, Casper Holstein, and Frank Rudolph Crosswaith. He was especially active in Virgin Island causes after the March 1917 U.S. purchase of the Virgin Islands, and subsequent abuses under the U.S. naval occupation of the islands.

==Emigration and education==
Harrison came to New York in 1900 as a 17-year-old orphan and joined his older sister. He confronted a racial oppression unlike anything he previously knew, as only the United States had such a binary color line. In the Caribbean, social relations were more fluid. Harrison was especially &quot;shocked&quot; by the virulent white-supremacy typified by lynchings, which were reaching a peak in these years in the South. They were a horror that had not existed in St. Croix or other Caribbean islands. In addition, the fact that in most places blacks and people of color far outnumbered whites meant they had more social spaces in which to operate away from the oversight of whites.

In the beginning, Harrison worked low-paying service jobs while attending high school at night. For the rest of his life, Harrison continued to study as an autodidact. While he was still in high school, his intellectual gifts were recognized. He was described as a &quot;genius&quot; in &quot;The World&quot;, a New York daily newspaper. At age 20, he had an early letter published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1903. He became an American citizen and lived in the United States the rest of his life.

==Marriage and family==
In 1909 Harrison married Irene Louise Horton. They had four daughters and one son.

==Career==
In his first decade in New York, Harrison started writing letters to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; on topics such as lynching, Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of Evolution and literary criticism. He also began lecturing on such subjects as the poetry of Paul Laurence Dunbar and Reconstruction. As part of his civic efforts, Harrison worked with St. Benedict&#x27;s Lyceum (along with bibliophile Arthur Schomburg from Puerto Rico, journalist John Edward Bruce, and activist Samuel Duncan); St. Mark&#x27;s Lyceum (with bibliophile George Young, educator/activist John Dotha Jones, and actor/activist Charles Burroughs); the White Rose Home (with educator/activist Frances Reynolds Keyser), and the Colored YMCA.

In this period, Harrison also became interested in the freethought movement, which encouraged use of the scientific method, empiricism, and reason to solve problems in place of theistic dogma. He deconverted from Christianity and became an agnostic atheist similar to Thomas Huxley, one of his influences. Harrison&#x27;s new worldview placed humanity, not god, at its center.

Like Huxley, Harrison became a relentless foe of theism and religious faith for the rest of his life. He denounced the Bible as a slave master&#x27;s book, said that black Christians needed their heads examined, and refused to exalt a &quot;lily white God &quot; and &quot;Jim Crow Jesus.&quot; He rebuked the famous motto, &quot;Take the world, but give me Jesus&quot;, saying that it legitimized anti-black racism and discrimination. He also said that he preferred going to hell rather than heaven since Satan and his demons were black while God, Jesus, and the angels were white. Harrison repeatedly offered scathing rebuttals to both the Bible and the existence of God in his sociopolitical commentary. Theists, incensed at his outspoken disbelief, often rioted during his lectures and public speeches. During one such incident, Harrison disarmed and chased off a religious extremist who attacked him with a crowbar. A policeman arrested Harrison for assault, letting the assailant get away. A judge found Harrison innocent on grounds of self-defense and admonished the officer for detaining the wrong person. Harrison had been arguing at his event for birth control, and castigating Churches for advancing racism, superstition, ignorance, and poverty.

Harrison was a firm advocate for separation of Church and State, taxation of religious organizations, and teaching evolution in schools. He said that Caucasians were more like apes than black people, having straight hair and fair skin. He also famously remarked, &quot;Show me a population that is deeply religious, and I will show you a servile population, content with whips and chains, contumely and the gibbet, content to eat the bread of sorrow and drink the waters of affliction.&quot; Harrison wrote in his 1914 book &quot;The Negro Conservative&quot; that &quot;It should seem that Negroes, of all Americans, would be found in the Free-thought fold, since they have suffered more than any other class of Americans from the dubious blessings of Christianity.&quot;

In 1907 Harrison obtained a job at the United States Post Office.

Harrison was an early supporter of the protest philosophies of W. E. B. Du Bois and William Monroe Trotter. Particularly after the Brownsville Affair, Harrison became an outspoken critic of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft, and of the Republican Party.

Harrison expressed disapproval of Booker T. Washington, a prominent Black leader, characterizing his political philosophy as subservient. In 1910, Harrison wrote two critical letters to the New York Sun, challenging Washington&#x27;s statements. As a result of the influential &quot;Tuskegee Machine&quot; led by Washington, Harrison lost his postal job. The sequence of events involved Charles W. Anderson, a prominent Black Republican, Emmett Scott, Washington&#x27;s assistant, and Edward M. Morgan, the New York Postmaster.

==Socialism==
Harrison was an early advocate of the Georgist economic philosophy and later clarified that he had believed Georgism was the same thing as socialism. In 1911, after his postal firing, Harrison began full-time work with the Socialist Party of America and became America&#x27;s leading Black Socialist. He lectured widely against capitalism, campaigned for the party presidential candidate Eugene V. Debs in 1912, and founded the Colored Socialist Club (the Socialist&#x27;s first effort at reaching African Americans). He developed two important and pioneering theoretical series on &quot;The Negro and Socialism&quot; for the socialist newspaper the &quot;New York Call&quot; and for the socialist monthly &quot;International Socialist Review&quot;. In these articles Harrison outlined a materialist analysis of racism, arguing that it resulted from &quot;the fallacy of economic fear&quot; and economic competition, and that capitalists had an interest in maintaining economic discrimination based on racism, as &quot;they can always use it as a club for the other workers&quot;. He maintained that it was the principal &quot;duty&quot; of the Socialists to &quot;champion the cause of the African American and that the Socialists should undertake special efforts to reach African Americans as they had done with foreigners and women.&quot; Perhaps most importantly, he emphasized that &quot;Politically, the Negro is the touchstone of the modern democratic idea&quot; and that true democracy and equality implies &quot;a revolution... startling even to think of.&quot;

Harrison moved to the left in the Socialist Party. He supported the socialistic, egalitarian, and militantly radical Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). He was a prominent speaker along with IWW leaders Bill Haywood, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Carlo Tresca, and Patrick Quinlan at the historic 1913 Paterson Silk Strike of 1913. He also supported IWW advocacy of direct action and sabotage. He commended the interracial, IWW-influenced, Brotherhood of Timber Workers efforts in the Deep South.

Despite his efforts, Socialist Party practice and positions included segregated locals in the South and racist positions on Asian immigration. Harrison&#x27;s position in the Party was also affected by his alignment with its left-wing and the IWW, who were engaged in factional struggle with its right-wing faction: many leftists exited after Haywood (who had been a member of the SPA&#x27;s executive committee) was expelled from the Party in 1912. The Socialist Party of New York was led by Morris Hillquit, a prominent figure on the right, and party leaders in New York City began restricting Harrison&#x27;s activities, including preventing his own branch from having him as a speaker. Harrison concluded that Socialist Party leaders, like organized labor, put the white &quot;Race first and class after.&quot; After writing a note to the NYC executive committee telling it to &quot;go chase itself&quot;, he was suspended from the Party for three months: he resigned from the Socialist Party in 1918, before his suspension was over, but was periodically referred to as a socialist by others for years afterwards. After resigning from the Socialist Party, Harrison increased his activism within the 1920s Single-Tax movement.

==Race radicalism and the New Negro Movement==
In 1914–15, after withdrawing from the Socialist Party, Harrison began work with freethinkers, the freethought/anarchist-influenced Modern School Movement (started by the martyred Spanish anarchist/educator Francisco Ferrer), and his own Radical Forum. He also spoke widely on topics such as birth control, evolution, literature, nonbelief, and the racial aspects of World War I. His outdoor talks and free speech efforts were instrumental in developing a Harlem tradition of militant street corner oratory. He paved the way for those who followed, including A. Philip Randolph, Marcus Garvey, Richard B. Moore, and (later) Malcolm X.

In 1915–16, after a &quot;New York Age&quot; editorial by James Weldon Johnson praised his street lectures, Harrison decided to concentrate his work in Harlem&#x27;s Black community. He wrote reviews on the developing Black Theatre and the pioneering Lafayette Players of the Lafayette Theatre (Harlem). He emphasized how the &quot;Negro Theater&quot; helped express the psychology of the &quot;Negro&quot; and how it called attention to color consciousness within the African-American community.

In response to the &quot;white first&quot; attitude of the organized labor movement and the Socialists, Harrison provided a &quot;race first&quot; political perspective. He founded the &quot;New Negro Movement,&quot; as a race-conscious, internationalist, mass-based, radical movement for equality, justice, opportunity, and economic power. This &quot;New Negro&quot; movement laid the basis for the Garvey movement. It encouraged mass interest in literature and the arts, and paved the way for publication of Alain Locke&#x27;s well-known &quot;The New Negro&quot; eight years later. Harrison&#x27;s mass-based political movement was noticeably different from the more middle-class and apolitical movement associated with Locke.

In 1917, African Americans and others were asked to &#x27;Make the World Safe for Democracy&quot; by fighting during World War I. In the United States, lynchings, racial segregation and discrimination continued. Harrison founded the Liberty League and the &quot;Voice: A Newspaper for the New Negro&quot;, as a radical alternative to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The Liberty League aimed at the Black masses beyond &quot;The Talented Tenth&quot;. Its program advocated internationalism, political independence, and class and race consciousness. It called for full equality, federal anti-lynching legislation, enforcement of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, labor organizing, support for socialist and anti-imperialist causes, armed self-defense, and mass-based political efforts. Meanwhile, the Voice achieved circulation of up to 10,000 per issue, however it ceased publication in November 1917 after five months, after refusing to accept advertising for products Harrison felt were damaging to racial pride such as hair straighteners and skin lighteners, and due to poor financial management. Harrison pointed to Ireland and the Irish Home Rule movement as an example to emulate.

In 1918 Harrison briefly served as an organizer for the American Federation of Labor (AFL). He chaired the Negro-American Liberty Congress (co-headed by William Monroe Trotter.) The latter was the major wartime protest effort of African Americans. The Liberty Congress pushed demands against discrimination and racial segregation in the United States. It submitted a petition to the U. S. Congress for federal anti-lynching legislation, which the NAACP did not demand at that time. Harrison commented on domestic and international aspects of the war, writing: &quot;During the war the idea of democracy was widely advertised, especially in the English-speaking world, mainly as a convenient camouflage behind which competing imperialists masked their sordid aims... [however] those who so loudly proclaimed and formulated the new democratic demands never had the slightest intention of extending the limits or the applications of &#x27;democracy.&#x27;&quot;

The autonomous Liberty Congress effort was undermined by the U.S. Army&#x27;s anti-radical Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB) in a campaign that included NAACP leader Joel E. Spingarn (a Major in Military Intelligence) and W. E. B. Du Bois (who applied for a Captaincy in Military Intelligence). The Liberty Congress protest efforts in wartime can be seen as precursors to the A. Philip Randolph-led March on Washington Movement during World War II, and to the Randolph and Martin Luther King Jr.-led March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom during the Vietnam War.

In 1919 Harrison edited the monthly &quot;New Negro&quot; magazine, which was &quot;intended as an organ of the international consciousness of the darker races--especially of the Negro race&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s concentration on international matters continued. Over the next several years, he wrote many powerful pieces critical of imperialism and supportive of internationalism. His writings and talks over his last decade revealed a deep understanding of developments in India, China, Africa, Asia, the Islamic world, and the Caribbean. Harrison repeatedly began his analysis of contemporary situations from an international perspective. Though a strong advocate of armed self-defense for African Americans, he also praised the mass-based non-violent efforts of Mohandas K. Gandhi.

==The Garvey Movement==
In January 1920 Harrison became principal editor of the &quot;Negro World&quot;, the newspaper of Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Over the next eight months, he developed it into the leading race-conscious, radical and literary publication of the day. By the August 1920 UNIA convention, Harrison had grown increasingly critical of Garvey. Harrison criticized Garvey for exaggerations, financial schemes, and desire for empire. In contrast to Garvey, Harrison emphasized that African Americans&#x27; principal struggle was in the United States, not in Africa. Harrison did however contribute to the UNIA&#x27;s 1920 &quot;Declaration of the Negro Peoples of the World&quot;. Though Harrison continued to write for the &quot;Negro World&quot; into 1922, he looked to develop political alternatives to Garvey.

==Later years==
In the 1920s, after breaking with Garvey, Harrison continued public speaking, writing, and organizing. He lectured on politics history, science, literature, social sciences, international affairs, and the arts for the New York City Board of Education, and was one of the first to use radio to discuss topics in which he had expertise. In early July 1923, he spoke on &quot;The Negro and The Nation&quot; over New York station WEAF. His book and theater reviews and other writings appeared in many of the leading periodicals of the day—including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;, &quot;Amsterdam News&quot;, &quot;New York World&quot;, &quot;Nation&quot;, &quot;New Republic&quot;, &quot;Modern Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Boston Chronicle&quot;, and &quot;&quot; magazine. He openly criticized the Ku Klux Klan and the racist attacks of the &quot;Tulsa Race Riot&quot; of 1921. He worked with various groups, including the Virgin Island Congressional Council, the Democratic Party, the Farmer-Labor Party, the single tax movement inspired by Henry George, the American Friends Service Committee, the Urban League, the American Negro Labor Congress, and the Workers (Communist) Party (the name at that time of the Communist Party USA).

In 1924 Harrison founded the International Colored Unity League (ICUL), which was his most broadly unitary effort. The ICUL urged Black people to develop &quot;race consciousness&quot; as a defensive measure—to be aware of their racial oppression and to use that awareness to unite, organize, and respond as a group. The ICUL program sought political rights, economic power, and social justice; urged self-reliance, self-sufficiency, and cooperative efforts; and called for the founding of &quot;a Negro state&quot; in the U.S. (not in Africa, as Garvey advocated). In 1927 Harrison edited the ICUL&#x27;s &quot;Voice of the Negro&quot; until shortly before his death that year.

In his last lecture, Harrison told his listeners that he had appendicitis and would be getting surgery. Afterwards, he said he would be giving another lecture. He died on the operating table, at the age of 44.

==Intellectual and educational work==
Harrison&#x27;s appeal was both mass and individual. His race-conscious mass appeal utilized newspapers, popular lectures, and street-corner talks. This was in contrast to the approaches of Booker T. Washington, who relied on white patrons and a Black political machine, and W. E. B. Du Bois, who focused on the &quot;Talented Tenth of the Negro Race&quot;. Harrison&#x27;s appeal (later identified with that of Garvey) was aimed directly at the masses. His class- and race-conscious radicalism, though neglected at some periods, laid out the contours of much subsequent debate and discussion of African-American social activists. It is being increasingly studied.

For many years after his 1927 death, Harrison was much neglected. However, recent scholarship on Harrison&#x27;s life and the Columbia University Library&#x27;s acquisition of his papers show renewed interest. Columbia published the &quot;Hubert H. Harrison Papers, 1893-1927: Finding Aid&quot;, and plans to make Harrison&#x27;s writings available on the internet. The forthcoming Columbia University Press two-volume Harrison biography also reflects the growing interest in Harrison&#x27;s life and thought.

==Legacy and honors==
Biographer Jeffrey B. Perry writes that, among the African-American leaders of his era, Harrison was &quot;the most class conscious of the race radicals and the most race conscious of the class radicals.&quot; Perry emphasized that Harrison was a key unifying figure between two major trends of African-American struggle—the labor/civil rights trend (identified with Randolph and Owen, and later with Martin Luther King Jr.) and the race/nationalist trend (identified with Garvey, and later with Malcolm X).

Harrison has been described as &quot;the most distinguished, if not the most well-known, Caribbean radical in the United States in the early twentieth century&quot; by historian Winston James.

As an intellectual, Harrison was an unrivaled soapbox orator, a featured lecturer for the New York City Board of Education&#x27;s prestigious &quot;Trend of the Times&quot; series, a prolific and influential writer, and, reportedly, the first Black person to write regularly published book reviews in history. His efforts in these areas were lauded by both black and white writers, intellectuals, and activists such as Eugene O&#x27;Neill, James Weldon Johnson, Henry Miller, Hermie Huiswoud, William Pickens, Bertha Howe, Hodge Kirnon, and Oscar Benson. Harrison aided Black writers and artists, including Charles Gilpin, Andy Razaf, J. A. Rogers, Eubie Blake, Walter Everette Hawkins, Claude McKay, Solomon Tshekisho Plaatje, Lucian B. Watkins, and Augusta Savage. He was a pioneer Black participant in the freethought and birth control movements as well as being a bibliophile and library popularizer. He created &quot;Poetry for the People&quot; columns in various publications, including the &quot;New Negro&quot; magazine (1919), Garvey&#x27;s &quot;Negro World&quot; (1920), and the International Colored Unity League&#x27;s &quot;The Voice of the Negro&quot; (1927).

A sampling of his varied work and poetry appears in the edited collection &quot;A Hubert Harrison Reader&quot; (2001). His collected writings are found in the Hubert H. Harrison Papers (which also contain a detailed Finding Aid) at the Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Columbia University. Other writings appear in his two books &quot;The Negro and the Nation&quot; (1917) and &quot;When Africa Awakes&quot;. A two-volume biography by Jeffrey B. Perry is being published by Columbia University Press. The first volume, &quot;The Voice of Harlem Radicalism, 1883-1918&quot;, was published in November 2008 (an excerpt is available online).

In 2005 Columbia University&#x27;s Rare Book and Manuscript Library acquired Harrison&#x27;s papers and the digitalized papers were made available through Columbia&#x27;s Digital Library Collections website in 2020 .

<text>Giovanni Battista Amici (; 25 March 1786 – 10 April 1863) was an Italian astronomer, microscopist, and botanist.

Amici was born in Modena, in present-day Italy. After studying at Bologna, he became professor of mathematics at Modena, and in 1831 was appointed inspector-general of studies in the Duchy of Modena. A few years later he was chosen director of the observatory at Florence, where he also lectured at the museum of natural history. Amici died in Florence in 1863.

His name is best known for the improvements he effected in the mirrors of reflecting telescopes and especially in the construction of the microscope. He was also a diligent and skillful observer, and busied himself not only with astronomical subjects, such as the double stars, the satellites of Jupiter and the measurement of the polar and equatorial diameters of the sun, but also with biological studies of the circulation of the sap in plants, the fructification of plants, infusoria etc. He was the first to observe the pollen tube.

He invented the dipleidoscope and also the direct vision prism.

The crater Amici on the Moon is named in his honour.

<text>The &quot;Billboard&quot; charts tabulate the relative weekly popularity of songs and albums in the United States and elsewhere. The results are published in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine. &quot;Billboard&quot; biz, the online extension of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, provides additional weekly charts, as well as year-end charts. The two most important charts are the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for songs and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for albums, and other charts may be dedicated to a specific genre such as R&amp;B, country, or rock, or they may cover all genres. The charts can be ranked according to sales, streams, or airplay, and for main song charts such as the Hot 100 song chart, all three data are used to compile the charts. For the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, streams and track sales are included in addition to album sales.

The weekly sales and streams charts have been monitored on a Friday-to-Thursday cycle since July 2015; previously it was on a Monday-to-Sunday cycle. Radio airplay song charts, however, follow the Monday-to-Sunday cycle (previously Wednesday-to-Tuesday). The charts are released each Tuesday with an issue date the following Saturday.

== History ==
The first chart published by &quot;Billboard&quot; was &quot;Last Week&#x27;s Ten Best Sellers Among The Popular Songs&quot;, a list of best-selling sheet music, in July 1913. Other early charts listed popular song performances in theatres and recitals in different cities. In 1928, &quot;Popular Numbers Featured by Famous Singers and Leaders&quot; appeared, which added radio performances to in-person performances. On January 4, 1936, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine published its first pop chart based on record sales. Titled &quot;Ten Best Records for Week Ending&quot;, it listed the 10 top-selling records of three leading record companies as reported by the companies themselves. In March 1937, the &quot;Songs with the Most Radio Plugs&quot; chart debuted with data from a separate company. In October 1938, a review list, &quot;The Week&#x27;s Best Records&quot;, was retitled &quot;The Billboard Record Buying Guide&quot; by incorporating airplay and sheet music sales, which would eventually become the first trade survey of record popularity.

In the July 27, 1940, issue, the first &quot;Billboard Music Popularity Chart&quot; was published for the week ending July 20, with separate listings covering retail sales, sheet music sales, jukebox song selection and radio play. Among the lists were the 10 songs of the &quot;Best Selling Retail Records&quot;, which is the fore-runner of today&#x27;s pop chart, with &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Smile Again&quot; by Tommy Dorsey (featuring vocals by Frank Sinatra) its first number one. This best-seller chart (also known as &quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot; and &quot;Best Selling Pop Singles in Stores&quot;) is considered the true guide to a song&#x27;s popularity until the creation of the Hot 100 in 1958. Another accolade of a successful song was a position on the &quot;Honor Roll of Hits&quot;, introduced on March 24, 1945, initially as a 10-song list, later expanded to 30 songs, which ranked the most popular songs by combining record and sheet sales, disk jockey, and jukebox performances as determined by &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; weekly nationwide survey. This chart amalgamated different records of the same song by different performers as one, and topping the first chart was &quot;Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive&quot;.

In November 1955, a composite standing chart that combined retail sales, jukebox and disk jockeys play charts but counted individual record separately was created as &quot;The Top 100&quot; chart, with &quot;Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing&quot; by The Four Aces its first No. 1. This chart is the direct predecessor to the current Hot 100 chart. The jukebox chart ceased publication after the June 17, 1957, issue, the disk jockey chart after July 28, 1958, and the best-seller chart after October 13, 1958. After July 28, 1958, the composite chart the &quot;Top 100&quot; chart was also discontinued; and the &quot;Hot 100&quot; began the following week on August 4, 1958, listing &quot;Poor Little Fool&quot; by Ricky Nelson as its first No. 1. The Hot 100 currently combines singles sales, radio airplay, digital downloads, and streaming activity (including data from YouTube and other video sites). Many &quot;Billboard&quot; charts use this basic formula apart from charts dedicated to the three data sources: sales (both physical and digital), airplay and streaming.

In the early period, the issue dates and the chart dates given in &quot;Billboard&quot; were different until January 13, 1962, when the issue dates and the chart dates both referred to the &quot;week ending&quot; dates. The Honor Roll of Hits chart was discontinued after November 16, 1963.

Billboard also publishes various music genre charts. &quot;Harlem Hit Parade&quot; was created in 1943 which became &quot;Best-Selling Race Records&quot; in 1948 and &quot;Best-selling Rhythm &amp; Blues Records&quot; in 1949, and then &quot;Soul Singles&quot; in 1969 (currently Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs). &quot;Best-selling Folk Records&quot; was published in 1948, and this morphed into &quot;Best-Selling Country &amp; Western Records&quot; in 1949, &quot;Best-Selling C&amp;W Records&quot; in 1956 and &quot;Hot Country Singles&quot; in 1963 (now Hot Country Songs). MOR charts has been published since 1961, variously called &quot;Easy Listening&quot;, &quot;Middle-Road Singles&quot; and &quot;Pop-Standard Singles&quot; and now Adult Contemporary. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts now cover these music genres: rock, pop, country, dance, bluegrass, jazz, classical, R&amp;B, rap, electronic, Latin, Christian, world and holiday music, and even ringtones for mobile (cell) phones.

An album chart, the &quot;Best Selling Popular Record Albums&quot;, was first published on March 24, 1945, with &quot;The King Cole Trio&quot; its first No. 1. The first chart had 10 albums, before reducing to five in the following weeks, then increasing again to 10 in 1948. The album chart was split into 33-8 and 45 rpm lists in 1950 before they recombined in 1954, then divided into mono and stereo classifications in 1959 before they merged into a 150-item pop album chart in 1963. It was eventually expanded into a 200 album list on May 13, 1967. Various genre album charts were also published: Country LP chart in January 1964, R&amp;B chart in 1965, jazz in 1969, Latin in 1973, Gospel 1974, and Rock in 1981. Other charts include Classical albums, Comedy Albums, Holiday Albums, Soundtracks, Independent Albums, Catalog Album and many others besides.

At the end of each year, &quot;Billboard&quot; tallies the results of all of its charts, and the results are published in a year-end issue and heard on year-end editions of its &quot;American Top 40&quot; and &quot;American Country Countdown&quot; radio broadcasts. The first such annual charts released were for the year 1946, published on the January 4, 1947, issue, although annual listing of songs had been published some years prior, such as the undifferentiated annual chart based on &quot;Honor Roll of Hits&quot; for 1945. Between 1991 and 2006, the top single/album/artist(s) in each of those charts was/were awarded in the form of the annual Billboard Music Awards, which were held in December until the awards went dormant in 2007. The awards returned in May 2011.

===Chart compilation methodology===

For many years, a song had to be commercially available as a single to be considered for any of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. At the time, instead of using Luminate (formerly Nielsen SoundScan or Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, BDS), &quot;Billboard&quot; obtained its data from manual reports filled out by radio stations and stores. For different musical genres, which stations and stores are used separates the charts; each musical genre has a core audience or retail group. Each genre&#x27;s department at &quot;Billboard&quot; is headed up by a chart manager, who makes these determinations. According to the 100th-anniversary issue of &quot;Billboard&quot;, prior to the official implementation of SoundScan tracking in November 1991, many radio stations and retail stores removed songs from their manual reports after the associated record labels stopped promoting a particular single. Thus, songs fell quickly after peaking and had shorter chart lives. In 1990, the country singles chart was the first chart to use SoundScan and BDS. They were followed by the Hot 100 and the R&amp;B chart in 1991. Today, all of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts use this technology.

Before September 1995, singles were allowed to chart in the week they first went on sale based on airplay points alone. The policy was changed in September 1995, to only allow a single to debut after a full week of sales on combined sales and airplay points. This allowed several tracks to debut at number one.

In December 1998, the policy was further modified to allow tracks to chart on the basis of airplay alone without a commercial release. This change was made to reflect the changing realities of the music business. Previous to this, several substantial radio and MTV hits had not appeared on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart at all, because many major labels chose not to release them as standalone singles, hoping their unavailability would spur greater album sales. Not offering a popular song to the public as a single was unheard of before the 1970s. The genres that suffered most at the time were those that increasingly impacted pop culture, including new genres such as trip hop and grunge. Among the many pre-1999 songs that had ended up in this Hot 100 limbo were The Cardigans&#x27; &quot;Lovefool&quot;, Natalie Imbruglia&#x27;s &quot;Torn&quot; (which peaked at 42), Goo Goo Dolls&#x27; &quot;Iris&quot; (which hit number 9), OMC&#x27;s &quot;How Bizarre&quot;, Sugar Ray&#x27;s &quot;Fly&quot;, and No Doubt&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Speak&quot;.

On June 25, 2015, &quot;Billboard&quot; made changes in its chart requirements. The official street date for all new album releases was moved from Tuesday to Friday in the United States. For all sales-based charts (ranking both albums and tracks), &quot;Billboard&quot; and Nielsen changed the chart reporting period to cover the first seven days of an album&#x27;s release. As a result of the changes, The &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, top albums sales, genre-based albums, digital songs, genre-based downloads, streaming songs, and genre-focused streaming surveys ran on a Friday-to-Thursday cycle. Radio Songs, which informs the Hot 100, synced to the Monday-to-Sunday period after formerly covering Wednesday to Tuesday. All other radio charts and genre tallies followed the Monday-to-Sunday cycle. The move was made to coincide with the IFPI&#x27;s move to have all singles and albums released globally on Fridays.

=== Incorporation of digital platforms ===
Starting on February 12, 2005, &quot;Billboard&quot; changed its methodology to include paid digital downloads from digital music retailers such as Rhapsody, AmazonMP3, and iTunes. With this policy change, a song could chart based on digital downloads alone.

On July 31, 2007, &quot;Billboard&quot; changed its methodology for the Hot 100 chart to include digital streams, which at the time was obtained from Yahoo and AOL&#x27;s streaming platforms. This change was made exclusively to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The effect of this chart change was minuscule at the time because it was estimated to account for 5% of the chart&#x27;s total points.

In October 2012, &quot;Billboard&quot; significantly changed the methodology for its country, rock, Latin, and rap charts, when it incorporated sales of digital downloads and streaming plays into what had previously been airplay-only charts. Another change was that rather than measuring airplay only from radio stations of a particular genre, the new methodology measures airplay from all radio formats. This methodology was extended to their Christian and gospel charts in late 2013. These methodology changes resulted in higher positions on the genre charts for songs with crossover appeal to other genres and radio formats (especially pop) at the expense of songs that appeal almost exclusively to core fans of the given genre, a change that proved controversial with those devotees.

On February 20, 2013, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced another change in the methodology for its charts that incorporated YouTube video streaming data into the determination of ranking positions on streaming charts. The incorporation of YouTube streaming data enhanced a formula that includes on-demand audio streaming and online radio streaming. The YouTube video streams that used in this methodology are official video streams, Vevo on YouTube streams, and user-generated clips that use authorized audio. &quot;Billboard&quot; said this change was made to further reflect the divergent platforms of music consumption in today&#x27;s world.

In December 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced a new chart titled &quot;Social 50&quot;, which ranks the most active artists on the world&#x27;s leading social networking sites. The Social 50 chart tallies artists&#x27; popularity using their weekly additions of friends/fans/followers, along with weekly artist page views and weekly song plays on Myspace, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and iLike.

In January 2011, &quot;Billboard&quot; introduced another chart called &quot;Uncharted&quot;, which lists new and developing artists, who are yet to appear on any major &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, &quot;...regardless of their country of origin.&quot; The ranking is based on the views and fans on social networking websites like Myspace and Facebook. It has since been discontinued.

In May 2014, after the Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart was discontinued in the U.S., the &quot;Billboard&quot; K-Town column continued to provide chart information for K-pop artists on all &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.

The Artist 100 debuted in July 2014.

In June 2019, &quot;Billboard&quot; launched the Top Songwriters Chart and the Top Producers Chart, based on weekly activity on the Hot 100 and other &quot;Hot&quot; genre charts. Dance/Pop Songwriters and Dance/Pop Producers charts are scheduled to be launched in January 2025, based on the Hot Dance/Pop Songs chart.

In October 2021, &quot;Billboard&quot; launched the Hot Trending Songs charts, utilising real-time music-related trends and conversations on Twitter.

<doc id="1290197" wikidata="Q270075" url="?curid=1290197" title="Ronald de Boer">
<text>Ronaldus de Boer (; born 15 May 1970) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He played for the Netherlands national team as well as a host of professional clubs in Europe. He is the twin brother of Frank de Boer. The majority of his success as a football player was with Ajax. He works as the Ajax A1 assistant manager.

==Club career==
De Boer&#x27;s first youth club was De Zouaven in Lutjebroek where he played before being selected for the Ajax youth programme in 1983. On the professional club level, De Boer played for Ajax (1988–91 and 1993–99), Twente (1991–93), Barcelona (1999–2000), Rangers (2000–04), Al-Rayyan (2004–05) and Al-Shamal (2005–08). In both Qatari clubs, he was reunited again with his brother Frank, his teammate at Ajax, Barcelona and Rangers.

In his first spell at Ajax from 1988 to 1991, he won the Eredivisie title in 1989–90 under manager Leo Beenhakker. After two seasons at Twente from 1991 to 1993, he returned to Ajax under manager Louis van Gaal, and had his most successful spell as a player, winning three consecutive Eredivisie titles in 1993–94, 1994–95 and 1995–96. He also won the 1995 UEFA Champions League, the 1995 Intercontinental Cup, and the 1995 UEFA Super Cup. He was also a runner-up of the 1996 UEFA Champions League, where Ajax lost on penalties to Juventus. When Louis van Gaal left Ajax for Barcelona in July 1997, Morten Olsen became the new Ajax manager, and De Boer won a fifth Eredivisie title in 1997–98 and also won the 1997–98 KNVB Cup.

There was then controversy soon after De Boer and his twin brother Frank signed a six-year contract extension with Ajax at the start 1998–99 season, when Ronald and Frank took successful legal action to have the contract voided. Ajax had agreed verbally that if a lucrative offer for one brother came by, he would be released provided the other stayed. Ajax, however, apparently backed down on that agreement after floating the club on the stock market and pledging to shareholders that it would hold both of the De Boers and build around them a team to recapture the UEFA Champions League.

The fallout over the contract situation led to an increasing conflict between the De Boer twins and the Ajax hierarchy, with match results for Ajax suffering and manager Morten Olsen soon getting sacked. In January 1999, Frank and Ronald signed for Barcelona for £22 million, joining their former Ajax manager Louis van Gaal at the Camp Nou.

While De Boer was impressive at Ajax during the 1990s and for the Netherlands up to and including the 1998 FIFA World Cup, his high-profile transfer to Barcelona in January 1999 marked what would be an unlikely bad patch for a prolific goal-scoring midfielder, as he managed to feature in only 33 La Liga games for the club and scored just one goal in La Liga. In the 2000–01 season, he opted to join the Dutch legion at Rangers under the manager Dick Advocaat. Among the Dutch internationals who at that time played for Rangers were Bert Konterman, Arthur Numan, Fernando Ricksen and Giovanni van Bronckhorst. De Boer made his debut in a Scottish League Cup tie against Aberdeen on 6 September 2000, and scored his first goal for the club in a UEFA Champions League tie against Sturm Graz. De Boer didn&#x27;t win any silverware at the end of his first season at the club, but the following season (2001–02) Rangers won both the Scottish League Cup and the Scottish Cup, though De Boer missed the former final through injury. The following season, 2002–03, brought even more success as De Boer helped Rangers win a domestic treble of league, Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup. In total he spent four seasons with the club before joining Al-Rayyan after the 2003–04 season.

De Boer recovered from surgery on a neck injury and decided not to play in Al-Shamal&#x27;s last two games of the 2006–07 season. On 19 March 2008, De Boer canceled his contract with Qatari outfit Al-Shamal and retired.

==International career==

De Boer won 67 caps and scored 13 goals for the Netherlands national team. He played for the Netherlands in the 1994 and the 1998 World Cups, where he played in six matches and scored two goals. He missed a penalty in the penalty shootout against Brazil in the 1998 semi-finals. De Boer also played in Euro 1996 and Euro 2000.

In the Dutch national team, De Boer was used in various positions, including right-half, centre forward and attacking midfielder. In his early Ajax years, De Boer played either centre forward or attacking midfielder. In later years, he shifted to right midfield.

De Boer was never officially captain of the Dutch national team or Ajax, but he has worn the captain&#x27;s armband on several occasions for both club teams and the national team when the first-choice captain was not playing. In most teams, this was his brother Frank, with whom he has played side by side for most of his career.

==Managerial career==
De Boer is Ajax A1 assistant manager.

==Media==
De Boer featured in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series; he was on the cover for the International edition of FIFA 96, alongside Jason McAteer.

<text>The British Rail Class 450 &quot;[[Siemens Desiro|Desiro]]&quot; is a type of third-rail DC electric multiple unit (EMU) passenger train that entered service during 2003. Used for outer-suburban services, the units were built with both first- and standard-class accommodation. They have a maximum speed of .

The &quot;Desiro UK&quot; family also includes units of Classes 185, 350, 360, 380 and 444.

Along with the Class 444 &quot;Desiro&quot;, the Class 450 units are operated by South Western franchise operator South Western Railway.

== Introduction ==

In April 2001, 785 vehicles were ordered by South West Trains in order to complete the replacement of its slam-door rolling stock, in accordance with its franchise commitment to do so by 2005, as the slam-door trains, many of which were more than 40 years old, did not meet modern health and safety requirements. Introduction to service was delayed by the required power supply upgrades capable of powering the new trains, which feature air conditioning, a feature not present in the slam-door trains they replaced. In the December 2004 timetable change, the Class 450 &quot;Desiro&quot; began serving most intended routes, although introduction was delayed until June 2005 in some areas. The units are leased by Angel Trains to South Western Railway.

Sixty-eight new vehicles were ordered by South West Trains as a replacement to the growth order which was diverted to form the similar range of electric multiple units.

== Operations ==
Class 450 units operate suburban, outer-suburban, and regional services from London Waterloo. They are used on all SWR lines except the non-electrified West of England Main Line and Eastleigh to Romsey Line.

On occasion Class 450 units are also used on the Portsmouth Direct Line for services between Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour, in place of the intended Class 444. The difference in comfortparticularly the higher-density 2+3 seating arrangement used on the Class 450 fleethas prompted complaints from some passengers affected by the substitution.

Both the Class 444 and 450 fleets are maintained at the purpose-built Northam Traincare Facility in Southampton, which is equipped to perform both preventative and corrective maintenance, deep-cleaning, and overhauls on up to eight units simultaneously.

In March 2012, the Class 450 fleet, along with the Class 458 and 444 fleets, was fitted with regenerative braking. 

=== Class 450/2 and more orders ===
Originally, SWT&#x27;s order with Siemens was for 100 four-car sets (the current 450/0) and 32 five-car sets, intended as Class 450/2 for inner-suburban use. The Strategic Rail Authority, however, did not agree to the terms required, such as the lengthening of platforms and changes to railway infrastructure. As a result, the 32 five-car sets were cancelled and the 160 vehicles redistributed; an extra 10 four-car sets were added to the SWT order, while the remaining 120 vehicles were then ordered as 30 four-car sets of the dual-voltage for Silverlink and Central Trains.

Subsequently, SWT received further 17 four-car sets, bringing the total number of Class 450 units up to 127. These trains were delivered in 2006, not long after the last of the first order was delivered.

=== Class 450/5 modifications ===
In January 2008, 28 Class 450/0 sets were modified and re-numbered in the Class 450/5 series, for use on services between Waterloo and Windsor, the Hounslow Loop Line, as well as between Waterloo and Weybridge. They had their first-class seating removed and replaced with 2+3 formation standard-class seating, and some other seats were removed to provide more standing capacity; extra handrails were also provided. The numbers modified are 450043 to 450070, which have become 450543 to 450570 respectively and displayed the letters HC (denoting &#x27;High Capacity&#x27;) above the unit number on the front of the sets. The modifications were carried out at the Bournemouth Traincare Depot.

In anticipation of the Class 458/5 modifications for use on the Windsor Lines, the 450/5 sub class had the First Class reinstated, and they are now used generally across the SWR routes. These trains retained their 4505xx number as the standard seating configuration remained different but as they completed their SWR interior refurbishment during late 2019 they were returned to their original numbers.

== Refresh ==
South Western Railway, as part of its franchise award in 2017, has carried out a refurbishment programme on its Class 450 fleet. As part of this, every unit has been deep cleaned with carpets and seat covers replaced and every two seats in standard class have had a plug socket fitted. The 24 first class seats carried in the centre of one of the intermediate trailers were replaced with standard-class rows, while new first-class areas of eight seats each were installed immediately adjacent to each driver&#x27;s cab. These areas feature new leather seats and tables with wireless charging facilities. As part of this work, subclass /5 high-capacity units have also been similarly refurbished, and returned to their original numbers, meaning that all Class 450s once again share a common layout.

== Accidents and incidents ==
On 6 November 2017, unit 450025 was derailed near . Four people were injured; over 300 passengers were evacuated from the train. The accident was caused by track spread (an increase in the distance between rails), and occurred on a stretch of line that had not been inspected or maintained for many years because of a misunderstanding between Network Rail and London Underground as to which company was responsible for its upkeep.

On 4 March 2024, unit 450092 was derailed between and stations when it struck an obstruction on the line whilst travelling at a speed of . No-one was injured and the train was safely evacuated.

<doc id="1290208" wikidata="Q616753" url="?curid=1290208" title="Naryshkin Baroque">
<text>Naryshkin Baroque, also referred to as Moscow Baroque or Muscovite Baroque, is a particular style of Baroque architecture and decoration that was fashionable in Moscow from the late 17th century into the early 18th century. In the late 17th century, the Western European Baroque style of architecture combined with traditional Russian architecture to form this unique style. It is called Muscovite Baroque as it was originally only found within Moscow and the surrounding areas. It is more commonly referred to as Naryshkin Baroque, as the first church designed in this style was built on one of the Naryshkin family&#x27;s estates.

==History==
The first church built in the Naryshkin Baroque style was the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin in the village of Fili, that was built on the estate of the Naryshkin family, who were Moscow boyars. The member of this family that is most related with this style of architecture is Lev Kirillovich Naryshkin, the uncle of Peter the Great. Lev Naryshkin erected this first church with the help of an architect, who is presumed to be Yakov Bukhvostov. This church became the staple of the Naryshkin Baroque style and inspired the building of other churches in this style within Moscow.

Naryshkin Baroque was contrasted with the Petrine Baroque, which was favored by Peter the Great and used widely in St. Petersburg. The contrast of these two styles are exemplified by the color, form, scale, and the materials used. The St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg, and the Menshikov Tower in Moscow, are notable examples of the Petrine Baroque style.

== Style ==
The churches designed in the Naryshkin Baroque style were often built in red brick, which differed them from other buildings of the time. They were also thoroughly decorated with details in white limestone. The structure of the building was also different from anything else being built in Russia at the time. This architectural style was classified as &quot;under the bell&quot; or &quot;under the ring&quot; (Ru. под звоном). Churches that are &quot;under the bell&quot; mean that the bell tower is placed on top of the main volume, instead of next to the building as was common in the 17th century.

The bell towers were often built in the shape of an octagon, with the main volume of the building being a quadrangle. This octagon on quadrangle shape was a classic Baroque composition for churches. The window trimmings were decorated, as on all Baroque style temples. Cupolas replaced the tented roof, which was previously widespread in Russian church architecture. These placed upon a high drum created feeling of loftiness and impression of a variety of forms. The design for octagon on quadrangle churches was originally believed to have been taken from Ukrainian Baroque architecture, but further research proved that that wasn&#x27;t true, as the first church built in this style was in Russia.
The style spread continually, even to architecture that wasn&#x27;t religious architecture. Many monasteries remodeled their walls and buildings in this style, as it was the latest fashion. The most notable examples of these monasteries were the Novodevichy Convent and the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow. There are some examples outside of Moscow as well; Krutitsy, Metochion and Solotcha Cloister are near Riazan. Non-religious architecture adopted this style as well, as could be seen in the Sukharev Tower in Moscow.

In the 1730s, the Naryshkin Baroque style ended and it evolved into the Rastrelliesque, or the Elizabethan Baroque style.

== Notable architects ==
The most important architects that worked in the Naryshkin Baroque style were Yakov Bukhvostov and Pyotr Potapov.

===Yakov Bukhvostov===
Yakov Grigorievich Buhvostov was born in the mid 17th-century, as a serf to Mikhail Tatishchev. The Tatishchev family were influential Boyars in Nikolskoe. Little is known about the early life of Bukhvostov, only that he was granted his freedom in the 1690s, when he was recognized as a great architect.

The most notable example of his work as an architect is the Church of the Savior in Ubory.

=== Pyotr Potapov ===
Pyotr Potapov is the hypothetical architect of the Church of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin on Pokrovka.

Nothing is known about his life, or if he was even a real person. His name is known exclusively by the inscription on the Assumption Church, which reads &quot;The summer of 7204 (1699) October 25 is the work of human hands, the work of Pyotr Potapov&quot; (). From this inscription it is unclear whether he was the architect or the stone carver, but it is believed that he was the architect.

<doc id="1290221" wikidata="Q8537" url="?curid=1290221" title="Bernardino Luini">
<text>Bernardino Luini (/82 – June 1532) was a north Italian painter from Leonardo&#x27;s circle during the High Renaissance. Both Luini and Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio were said to have worked with Leonardo directly; he was described as having taken &quot;as much from Leonardo as his native roots enabled him to comprehend&quot;. Consequently, many of his works were attributed to Leonardo. He was known especially for his graceful female figures with elongated eyes, called Luinesque by Vladimir Nabokov. 

==Biography==
Luini was born as Bernardino de Scapis in Runo, a of Dumenza, near Lake Maggiore. Details of his life are scant.

In 1500 he moved to Milan with his father. According to Lomazzo, he trained under Giovan Stefano Scotto, although for others he was a pupil of Ambrogio Bergognone. In 1504-1507 he was probably in Treviso, as attested by a &quot;Madonna with Child&quot; signed &quot;Bernardinus Mediolanensis faciebat&quot; which is however of disputed attribution. His first fresco works are an &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; in San Pietro of Luino () and the attributed fresco in the presbytery of Monza Cathedral with &quot;St. Gerard of the Painters&quot;.

Luini returned to Milan in 1509, receiving a commission for a polyptych from which today only &quot;St. Anthony of Padua&quot; in the Museo Poldi Pezzoli, influenced by Bernardino Zenale&#x27;s &quot;Cantù Polyptych&quot; remains. In the 1510s he painted frescoes in the Oratory of Santa Maria Nuova in Pilastrello, a &quot;Lamentation of the dead Christ&quot; in Santa Maria della Passione, a &quot;Madonna della Buonanotte&quot; in the Abbey of Chiaravalle, frescoes in San Giorgio di Palazzo (1516) and in the Certosa di Pavia, and others.

From 1509 to 1514 Luini completed the frescoes for the &quot;Villa Pelucca&quot; in Sesto San Giovanni (now in the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan). One of his best-known works was commissioned by Girolamo Rabia, for whom he also painted mythological scenes in the Palazzo Rabia (now in the Berlin Gemäldegalerie and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.).

In 1521, he travelled to Rome, where he was influenced by Raphael&#x27;s style. This is evident in Luini&#x27;s subsequent frescoes in the Villa La Pelucca executed between 1520 and 1523, as well as in other works now at the Brera. In 1523, Luini painted a polyptych depicting the &quot;Enthroned Madonna and Child surrounded by Angels with Musical Instruments&quot;, and surmounted by &quot;God the Father&quot;, found in the Basilica of San Magno, Legnano.

Around 1525, he completed a series of frescoes on the life of the Virgin and Christ for the sanctuary of &quot;Santa Maria dei Miracoli&quot; in Saronno; the fresco in the counterfaçade of Sant&#x27;Abbondio in Como was painted the same year. According to legend, he instigated the discovery of amaretto while at Saronno. Other works from his middle period include a &quot;Holy Family&quot; in the Museo del Prado, two &quot;Salome&quot; in the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Uffizi and a &quot;Portrait of a Lady&quot; in the National Gallery of Art. &quot;A Virgin with Child and Saints&quot; from 1526 is in the Lee Fareham collection of Richmond.

In 1529, Luini completed one of his masterworks, the grand &quot;Passion and Crucifixion&quot; fresco at in Lugano, paired with other works in the same church. In 1531 he returned to the Saronno sanctuary to complete other frescoes. Later in his career, Luini was increasingly influenced by Leonardo da Vinci, as shown by the &quot;St. Anne&quot; in the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana and the &quot;St. Catherine&quot; in the Hermitage.

He died in Milan. His son Aurelio was also an accomplished painter.

At least one prominent art scholar believes that the &quot;Salvator Mundi&quot; was not painted by Leonardo but mostly by assistants such as Luini; art historian Matthew Landrus maintained that the master was responsible for only about five to 20% of the work and that Luini was the &quot;primary painter&quot;.

<text>Raman is a small lunar impact crater that lies on the western edge of a plateau feature in the expansive lunar mare named Oceanus Procellarum. It shares this plateau with the lava-flooded Herodotus and Aristarchus to the southeastern. To the northeast of Raman is the small peak named Mons Herodotus. To the northwest on the mare is the long, narrow range named the Montes Agricola.

This is an elongated crater formation, with a secondary feature bulging out along the southeast rim. The inner walls of this crater have a higher albedo than the surrounding terrain, which is indicative of a relatively youthful formation. This crater was previously designated Herodotus D, a satellite crater of Herodotus, before being named by the IAU.

<text>Hans Kelsen (; ; October 11, 1881 – April 19, 1973) was an Austrian and later American jurist, legal philosopher and political philosopher. He is known principally for his theory of law, which he named the &quot;pure theory of law (&quot;Reine Rechtslehre&quot;)&quot;, and for his writings on international law and theory of democracy. The &quot;pure theory&quot; provides general foundations for value-independent description of law. As an expert on constitutional law, Kelsen was the principal architect of the 1920 Austrian Constitution, which with amendments is still in operation. The rise of totalitarianism forced him out of Austria, then to Germany and to Switzerland and in 1940 to the United States. Although in 1934 Roscoe Pound lauded Kelsen as &quot;unquestionably the leading jurist of the time&quot;, the pure theory was rarely understood in the United States and Kelsen was never given a permanent position in a law school. He was employed in the department of politics at the University of California, Berkeley from 1942 until official retirement in 1952. He then rewrote his short book of 1934, titled &quot;Reine Rechtslehre&quot;, into a much enlarged &quot;second edition&quot; published in 1960; it appeared in an English translation in 1967.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Kelsen was born in Prague into a middle-class, German-speaking, Jewish family. His father, Adolf Kelsen, was from Galicia, and his mother, Auguste Löwy, was from Bohemia. Hans was their first child; there were two younger brothers and a sister. The family moved to Vienna in 1884, when Hans was three years old. After graduating from the Akademisches Gymnasium, Kelsen studied law at the University of Vienna, taking his doctorate in law (Dr. juris) on 18 May 1906 and his habilitation (license to give university lectures) on 9 March 1911. Twice in his life, Kelsen converted to separate religious denominations. At the time of his dissertation on Dante and Catholicism, Kelsen was baptised as a Roman Catholic on 10 June 1905. On 25 May 1912 he married Margarete Bondi (1890–1973), the two having converted a few days earlier to Lutheranism of the Augsburg Confession; they had two daughters.
===Kelsen and his years in Austria up to 1930===
Kelsen&#x27;s early work on Dante&#x27;s theory of the state in 1905 became his first book on political theory. The study makes a rigorous examination of the &quot;two swords doctrine&quot; of Pope Gelasius I, along with Dante&#x27;s distinct sentiments in the Roman Catholic debates between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Kelsen&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism was contemporaneous to the book&#x27;s completion in 1905. He obtained the degree of Dr. Juris (doctor of law) by examination in 1906. In 1908, studying for his habilitation, Kelsen won a research scholarship which allowed him to attend the University of Heidelberg for three consecutive semesters, where he studied with the distinguished jurist Georg Jellinek before returning to Vienna.

The closing chapter of Kelsen&#x27;s study of political allegory in Dante also was important for emphasizing the particular historical path which led directly to the development of modern law in the twentieth century. After emphasizing Dante&#x27;s importance to this development of legal theory, Kelsen then indicated the historical importance of Niccolò Machiavelli and Jean Bodin to these historical transitions in legal theory leading to modern twentieth century law. In the case of Machiavelli, Kelsen saw an important counter-example of an exaggerated executive part of government operating without effective legal restraints on responsible conduct. For Kelsen, this was instrumental in the orientation of his own legal thinking in the direction of government strictly according to law, eventually with a heightened emphasis on the importance of a fully elaborated power of judicial review.

Kelsen&#x27;s time at Heidelberg was of lasting importance to him in that he began to solidify his position of the identity of law and state from the initial steps he observed as being taken by Jellinek. Kelsen&#x27;s historical reality was to be surrounded by the dualistic theories of law and state prevailing in his time. The major question for Jellinek and Kelsen, as stated by Baume is, &quot;How can the independence of the state in a dualist perspective be reconciled with its status (as) representative of the legal order? For dualistic theorists there remains an alternative to monistic doctrines: the theory of the self-limitation of the state. Georg Jellinek is an eminent representative of this theory, which allows one to avoid reducing the state to a legal entity, and also to explain the positive relationship between law and state. The self-limitation of the sphere of the state presupposes that the state, as a sovereign power, by the limits that it imposes on itself, becomes a rule-of-law state.&quot; For Kelsen, this was appropriate for as far as it went yet it still remained a dualistic doctrine and therefore Kelsen rejected it stating: &quot;The problem of the so-called auto-obligation of the State is one of those pseudo-problems that result from the erroneous dualism of State and law. This dualism is, in turn, due to a fallacy of which we meet numerous examples in the history of all fields of human thought. Our desire for the intuitive representation of abstractions leads us to personify the unity of a system, and then to hypostasize the personification. What originally was only a way of representing the unity of a system of objects becomes a new object, existing in its own right.&quot; Kelsen was joined in this critique by the distinguished French jurist Léon Duguit, who wrote in 1911: &quot;Self-limitation theory (vis Jellinek) contains some real sleight of hand. Voluntary subordination is not subordination. The state is not really limited by the law if the state alone can introduce and write this law, and if it can at any time make any changes that it wants to make in it. This kind of foundation of public law is clearly extremely fragile.&quot; As a result, Kelsen solidified his position endorsing the doctrine of the identity of law and state.

In 1911, he achieved his habilitation in public law and legal philosophy, with a thesis that became his first major work on legal theory, &quot;Hauptprobleme der Staatsrechtslehre entwickelt aus der Lehre vom Rechtssatze&quot; (&quot;Main Problems in Theory of Public Law, Developed from Theory of the Legal Statement&quot;). In 1919, he became full professor of public and administrative law at the University of Vienna, where he established and edited the &quot;Zeitschrift für öffentliches Recht&quot; (Journal of Public Law). At the behest of Chancellor Karl Renner, Kelsen worked on drafting a new Austrian Constitution, enacted in 1920. The document still forms the basis of Austrian constitutional law. Kelsen was appointed to the Constitutional Court, for his lifetime. Kelsen&#x27;s emphasis during these years upon a Continental form of legal positivism began to further flourish from the standpoint of his law-state monism, somewhat based upon the previous examples of Continental legal positivism found in such scholars of law-state dualism such as Paul Laband (1838–1918) and Carl Friedrich von Gerber (1823–1891).
During the early 1920s he published six major works in the areas of government, public law, and international law: in 1920, &quot;Das Problem der Souveränität und die Theorie des Völkerrechts&quot; (The Problem of Sovereignty and Theory of International Law) and &quot;Vom Wesen und Wert der Demokratie&quot; (On the Essence and Value of Democracy); in 1922, &quot;Der soziologische und der juristische Staatsbegriff&quot; (The Sociological and Juristic Concepts of the State); in 1923, &quot;Österreichisches Staatsrecht&quot; (Austrian Public Law); and, in 1925, &quot;Allgemeine Staatslehre&quot; (General Theory of the State), together with &quot;Das Problem des Parlamentarismus&quot; (The Problem of Parliamentarianism). In the late 1920s, these were followed by &quot;Die philosophischen Grundlagen der Naturrechtslehre und des Rechtspositivismus&quot; (The Philosophical Foundations of the Doctrine of Natural Law and Legal Positivism).

During the 1920s, Kelsen continued to promote his celebrated theory of the identity of law and state which made his efforts a counterpoint to the position of Carl Schmitt who advocated for the priority of the political concerns of the state. Kelsen was supported in his position by and Alfred Verdross, while opposition to his view was voiced by Erich Kaufman, Hermann Heller, and Rudolf Smend. An important part of Kelsen&#x27;s main practical legacy is as the inventor of the modern European model of constitutional review. This was first introduced in both Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1920, and later in the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, as well as in many countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

As described above, the Kelsenian court model set up a separate constitutional court which was to have sole responsibility over constitutional disputes within the judicial system. Kelsen was the primary author of its statutes in the state constitution of Austria as he documents in his 1923 book cited above. This is different from the system usual in common-law countries, including the United States, in which courts of general jurisdiction from the trial level up to the court of last resort frequently have powers of constitutional review. Following increasing political controversy about some positions of the Constitutional Court of Austria, Kelsen faced increasing pressure from the administration which appointed him to specifically address issues and cases concerning the providence of divorce provisions in state family law. Kelsen was inclined to a liberal interpretation of the divorce provision while the administration which had originally appointed him was responding to public pressure for the predominantly Catholic country to take a more conservative position on the issue of the curtailment of divorce. In this increasingly conservative climate, Kelsen, who was considered sympathetic to the Social Democrats, although not a party member, was removed from the court in 1930.

===Kelsen and his European years between 1930 and 1940===
Sandrine Baume has summarized the confrontation between Kelsen and Schmitt at the very start of the 1930s. This debate was to reignite Kelsen&#x27;s strong defense of the principle of judicial review against the principle of an authoritarian version of the executive branch of government which Schmitt had envisioned for national socialism in Germany. Kelsen wrote his scathing reply to Schmitt in his 1931 essay, &quot;Who Should Be the Guardian of the Constitution?&quot;, in which he defended in plain terms the importance of judicial review over and against the excessive form of executive authoritarian government which Schmitt was promulgating in the early 1930s. As Baume states,

Although Kelsen was successful in drafting sections for the Constitution in Austria for a strong court of judicial review, his sympathizers in Germany were less successful. Both Heinrich Triepel in 1924 and Gerhard Anschütz in 1926 were unsuccessful in their explicit drive to instill a strong version of judicial review in Germany&#x27;s Weimar Constitution. The complete set of the articles published in the debate between Kelsen and Schmitt during the 1930s has been collected by Lars Vinx and published in English translation in 2015.

Kelsen accepted a professorship at the University of Cologne in 1930. When the National Socialists came to power in Germany in 1933, he was removed from his post. He relocated to Geneva, Switzerland where he taught international law at the Graduate Institute of International Studies from 1934 to 1940. During this time period, Hans Morgenthau departed from Germany to complete his habilitation dissertation in Geneva, which resulted in his book &quot;The Reality of Norms and in particular the Norms of International Law: Foundations of a Theory of Norms&quot;. By remarkable good fortune for Morgenthau, Kelsen had just arrived in Geneva as a professor and he became an adviser for Morgenthau&#x27;s dissertation. Kelsen was among the strongest critics of Carl Schmitt because Schmitt was advocating for the priority of the political concerns of the state over the adherence by the state to the rule of law. Kelsen and Morgenthau were united against this National Socialist school of political interpretation which down-played the rule of law, and they became lifelong colleagues even after both had emigrated from Europe to take their respective academic positions in the United States. During these years, Kelsen and Morgenthau had both become &quot;persona non grata&quot; in Germany during the full rise to power of National Socialism.

That Kelsen was the principal defender of Morgenthau&#x27;s &quot;Habilitationschrift&quot; is recently documented in the translation of Morgenthau&#x27;s book titled &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot;. In the introductory essay to the volume, Behr and Rosch indicate that the Geneva faculty under the examiners Walther Burckhardt and Paul Guggenheim were initially quite negative concerning Morgenthau&#x27;s &quot;Habilitationschrift&quot;. When Morgenthau had found a Paris publisher for the volume, he asked Kelsen to re-evaluate it. In the words of Behr and Rosch, &quot;Kelsen was the right choice to assess Morgenthau&#x27;s thesis because not only was he a senior scholar in &quot;Staatslehre&quot;, but Morgenthau&#x27;s thesis was also largely a critical examination of Kelsen&#x27;s legal positivism. Thus, it was Kelsen to whom Morgenthau &#x27;owed his &quot;Habilitation&quot; in Geneva,&#x27; as Kelsen&#x27;s biographer Rudolf Aladár Métall confirms, &quot;and&quot; also eventually his subsequent academic career, because Kelsen produced the positive evaluation that convinced the board of examiners to award Morgenthau his &quot;Habilitation&quot;.&quot;

In 1934, at the age of 52, he published the first edition of &quot;Reine Rechtslehre&quot; (&quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot;). While in Geneva he became more deeply interested in international law. This interest in international law in Kelsen was in reaction largely to the Kellogg–Briand Pact in 1929 and his negative reaction to the vast idealism he saw represented in its pages, along with the lack of the recognition of sanctions for the illicit actions of belligerent states. Kelsen had come to endorse strongly the sanction-delict theory of law which he saw as substantially under-represented in the Kellogg–Briand Pact. In 1936–1938 he was briefly professor at the German University in Prague before returning to Geneva where he remained until 1940. His interest in international law became especially focused in Kelsen&#x27;s writings on international war crimes which he redoubled his efforts on behalf of after his departure to the United States.

===Hans Kelsen and his American years after 1940===
In 1940, at the age of 58, he and his family fled Europe on the last voyage of the SS &quot;Washington&quot;, embarking on 1 June in Lisbon. He moved to the United States, giving the prestigious &quot;Oliver Wendell Holmes Lectures&quot; at Harvard Law School in 1942. He was supported by Roscoe Pound for a faculty position at Harvard but opposed by Lon Fuller on the Harvard faculty before becoming a full professor at the department of political science at the University of California, Berkeley in 1945. Kelsen was defending a position of the distinction of the philosophical definition of justice as it is separable from the application of positive law. As Fuller stated his opposition, &quot;I share the opinion of Jerome Hall, evidenced in this excellent &quot;Readings&quot;, that jurisprudence should start with justice. I place this preference not on exhortatory grounds, but on a belief that until one has wrestled with the problem of justice one cannot truly understand the other issues of jurisprudence. Kelsen, for example, excludes justice from his studies (of practical law) because it is an &#x27;irrational ideal&#x27; and therefore &#x27;not subject to cognition.&#x27; The whole structure of his theory derives from that exclusion. The meaning of his theory can therefore be understood only when we have subjected to critical scrutiny its keystone of negation.&quot; Lon Fuller felt that the natural law position he was advocating against Kelsen was incompatible with Kelsen&#x27;s dedication to the responsible use of positive law and the science of law. During the ensuing years, Kelsen increasingly dealt with issues of international law and international institutions such as the United Nations. In 1953-54, he was visiting Professor of International Law at the United States Naval War College.

Another part of Kelsen&#x27;s practical legacy, as he has recorded, was the influence that his writings from the 1930s and early 1940s had upon the extensive and unprecedented prosecution of political leaders and military leaders at the end of WWII at Nuremberg and Tokyo, producing convictions in more than one thousand war crimes cases. For Kelsen, the trials were the culmination of approximately fifteen years of research he had devoted to this topic, which started still in his European years, and which he followed with his celebrated essay, &quot;Will the Judgment In the Nuremberg Trial Constitute a Precedent In International Law?,&quot; published in &quot;The International Law Quarterly&quot; in 1947. It was preceded in 1943 by Kelsen&#x27;s essay, &#x27;Collective and Individual Responsibility in International Law with Particular Regard to Punishment of War Criminals&#x27;, 31 &quot;California Law Review&quot;, p 530, and in 1944 by his essay, &quot;The Rule Against Ex Post Facto and the Prosecution of the Axis War Criminals,&quot; which appeared in &quot;The Judge Advocate Journal&quot;, Issue 8.

In Kelsen&#x27;s companion 1948 essay for &quot;J.Y.B.I.L.&quot; to his 1943 &quot;War Criminals&quot; essay cited in the above paragraph titled, &quot;Collective and Individual Responsibility for Acts of State in International Law,&quot; Kelsen presented his thoughts on the distinction between the doctrine of &quot;respondeat superior&quot; and the acts of State doctrine when used as a defense during the prosecution of war crimes. On page 228 of the essay Kelsen states that, &quot;Acts of State are acts of individuals performed by them in their capacity as organs of the State, especially by that organ which is called the Government &quot;of&quot; the State. These acts are performed by individuals who belong to the Government as the head of State, or members of the cabinet, or are &quot;acts performed at its command or with the authorization of the Government&quot;.&quot; Yoram Dinstein of Hebrew University in Jerusalem has taken exception to Kelsen&#x27;s formulation in his book &quot;The Defense of &#x27;Obedience to Superior Orders&#x27; in International Law&quot;, reprinted in 2012 by Oxford University Press, dealing with Kelsen&#x27;s specific attribution of acts of State.

Shortly after the initiation of the drafting of the UN Charter on 25 April 1945 in San Francisco, Kelsen began the writing of his extended 700-page treatise on the United Nations as a newly appointed professor at the University of California at Berkeley (&quot;The Law of the United Nations&quot;, New York 1950). In 1952, he also published his book-length study about international law entitled &quot;Principles of International Law&quot; in English, and reprinted in 1966. In 1955, Kelsen turned to a 100-page essay, &quot;Foundations of Democracy,&quot; for the leading philosophy journal &quot;Ethics&quot;; written during the height of Cold War tensions, it expressed a passionate commitment to the Western model of democracy over soviet and national-socialist forms of government.

This 1955 essay by Kelsen on democracy was also important for summarizing his critical stance towards the 1954 book on politics by his former student in Europe Eric Voegelin. Following this, in Kelsen&#x27;s book entitled &quot;A New Science of Politics&quot; (Ontos Verlag, reprinted in 2005, 140pp, originally published 1956), Kelsen enumerated a point by point criticism of the excessive idealism and ideology which he saw as prevailing in Voegelin&#x27;s book on politics. This exchange and debate has been documented in the appendix to the book, written by the author on Voegelin, Barry Cooper, entitled &quot;Voegelin and the Foundations of Modern Political Science&quot; from 1999. Kelsen&#x27;s 1956 book was followed in 1957 by a collection of essays on justice, law and politics, most of them previously published in English.

Some mystery surrounds the belated publication, in 2012, of Kelsen&#x27;s &quot;Secular Religion&quot;. The text was begun in the 1950s, as an attack on work by his former pupil Eric Voegelin. In the early 1960s an expanded version was set up in proof but was withdrawn at Kelsen&#x27;s insistence (and considerable personal expense in reimbursing the publisher), for reasons that have never become clear. However, the Hans Kelsen Institute eventually decided that it should be published. It is a vigorous defense of modern science against all, including Voegelin, who wished to overturn the accomplishments of the Enlightenment by demanding that science be guided by religion. Kelsen seeks to expose contradictions in their claim that modern science, after all, rests upon the same sorts of assumption as religionthat it constitutes forms of &quot;new religion&quot; and so should not complain when old religion is brought back in.

==The Pure Theory of Law==
Kelsen is considered one of the preeminent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential among scholars of jurisprudence and public law, especially in Europe and Latin America although less so in common-law countries.

Kelsen&#x27;s theory of law, his &#x27;Pure Theory of Law&#x27; (), aims to describe law as a hierarchy of binding norms, while refusing, itself, to evaluate those norms. That is, is to be separated from . Central to the Pure Theory is the notion of a ()a hypothetical norm, presupposed by the theory, from which in a hierarchy of empowerments all norms in a legal system, from constitutional law downward, are understood to derive their validity, hence their authority or . This is not logical validity (i.e. of deduction), but ; a norm is legally if and only if the organ creating it has been so empowered by a higher norm. Public international law is understood as similarly hierarchical. In this way, Kelsen contends, the validity of legal norms (their specifically character) can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or a personified State or Nation. The Pure Theory is intended as rigorous legal positivism, excluding any idea of natural law.

Kelsen&#x27;s main statement of his theory, his book , was published in two editions, far apart: in 1934, while he was in exile in Geneva, and a second, much expanded edition after he had formally retired from the University of California, Berkeley. The second edition appeared in English translation in 1967, as &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot;. The current translation of the second edition, in omitting many footnotes, obscures the extent to which the Pure Theory is both philosophically grounded and responsive to earlier theories of law; a new translation is in preparation.

Kelsen wrote primarily in German, as well as in French and in English. His complete works are being published, both in hard copy and online, as the , planned to run to 32 volumes with completion in 2042.

==Kelsen&#x27;s widespread contributions to legal theory==
Kelsen&#x27;s theory both drew from and has been developed by scholars in his homelands, notably the Vienna School in Austria and the Brno School led by František Weyr in Czechoslovakia. It is stated that in the English-speaking world, and notably the &quot;Oxford school&quot; of jurisprudence, Kelsen&#x27;s influence can be seen particularly in the work of H. L. A. Hart, John Gardner, Leslie Green, and Joseph Raz, and &quot;in the backhanded compliment of strenuous criticism, also in the work of John Finnis&quot;. Among the principal other writers in English on Kelsen are Robert S. Summers, Neil MacCormick and Stanley L. Paulson. Among Kelsen&#x27;s principal critics today is Joseph Raz, who has excoriated the reading of Nuremberg and the war crimes trials which Kelsen had interpreted in a consistent manner throughout the 1930s and 1940s.
Four major areas of Kelsen&#x27;s contributions to legal theory over his lifetime included the following areas of (i) judicial review, (ii) hierarchical law, (iii) the de-ideologicalization of positive law to strongly disassociate all reference to natural law, and (iv) the clear delineation of the science of law and legal science in twentieth century modern law.

===Judicial review===
Judicial review for Kelsen in the twentieth century was part of a tradition inherited from the common law tradition based upon the American constitutional experience as introduced by John Marshall. By the time the principle had reached Europe and specifically Kelsen, the issue of the codification of Marshall&#x27;s common law version of judicial review into its form of constitutionally legislated law became an explicit theme for Kelsen. In drafting the constitutions for both Austria and Czechoslovakia, Kelsen chose to carefully delineate and limit the domain of judicial review to a narrower focus than was originally accommodated by John Marshall. Kelsen did receive a lifetime appointment to the court of judicial review in Austria and remained on this court for almost an entire decade during the 1920s.

===Hierarchical law===
Hierarchical law as a model for understanding the structural description of the process of understanding and applying the law was central for Kelsen and he adopted the model directly from his colleague at the University of Vienna. The main purposes of the hierarchical description of the law was three-fold for Kelsen. First, it was essential to understanding his celebrated static theory of law as elaborated in Chapter four of his book on the &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot; (see subsection above). In its second edition, this chapter on the static theory of the law was almost one hundred pages in length and represented a comprehensive study of law capable of standing as an independent subject for research for legal scholars in this area of specialization. Second, it was a measure of relative centralization or decentralization. Third, a fully centralized system of law would also correspond to a unique &quot;Grundnorm&quot; or basic norm which would not be inferior to any other norm in the hierarchy due to its placement at the utmost foundation of the hierarchy (see &quot;Grundnorm&quot; section below).

===The de-ideologicalization of positive law===
Kelsen, during the time period of his education and legal training in fin-de-siecle Europe, had inherited a highly ambiguous definition of natural law which could be presented as having metaphysical, theological, philosophical, political, religious, or ideological components depending on any one of numerous sources who might desire to utilize the term. For Kelsen, this ambiguity in the definition of natural made it unusable in any practical sense for a modern approach to understanding the science of law. Kelsen explicitly defined positive law to deal with the many ambiguities he associated with the use of natural law in his time, along with the negative influence which it had upon the reception of what was meant even by positive law in contexts apparently removed from the domain of influence normally associated with natural law.

===Science of law===
The redefinition of the science of law and legal science to meet the requirements of modern law in the twentieth century was of significant concern to Kelsen. Kelsen wrote book-length studies detailing the many distinctions to be made between the natural sciences and their associated methodology of causal reasoning in contrast to methodology of normative reasoning which he saw as more directly suited to the legal sciences. The science of law and legal science were key methodological distinctions which were of high importance to Kelsen in the development of the pure theory of law and the general project of removing ambiguous ideological elements from having undue influence on the development of modern twentieth century law. In his last years, Kelsen turned to a comprehensive presentation of his ideas on norms. The unfinished manuscript was published posthumously as &quot;Allgemeine Theorie der Normen&quot; (General Theory of Norms).

==Political philosophy==
Kelsen&#x27;s very first book (see Section above) was written about the political philosophy of Dante Alighieri and it was only with his second book that Kelsen started to write book length studies about the philosophy of law and its practical applications. Baume speaks of Kelsen&#x27;s political philosophy concerning judicial review as coming closest to Ronald Dworkin and John Hart Ely among the scholars active after the end of Kelsen&#x27;s life.

As summarized by Sandrine Baume, &quot;In 1927 [Kelsen] recognized his debt to Kantianism on this methodological point that determined much of his pure theory of law: &#x27;Purity of method, indispensable to legal science, did not seem to me to be guaranteed by any philosopher as sharply as by Kant with his contrast between Is and Ought. Thus for me, Kantian philosophy was from the very outset the light that guided me.&#x27;&quot; Kelsen&#x27;s high praise of Kant in the absence of any specific neo-Kantians is matched among more recent scholars by John Rawls of Harvard University. Both Kelsen and Rawls also have made strong endorsements of Kant&#x27;s books on &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot; (1795) and &quot;Idea for a Universal History&quot; (1784). In his book titled &quot;What is Justice?&quot;, Kelsen indicated his position concerning social justice stating, &quot;[S]uppose that it is possible to prove that the economic situation of a people can be improved so essentially by so-called planned economy that social security is guaranteed to everybody in an equal measure; but that such an organization is possible only if all individual freedom is abolished. The answer to the question whether planned economy is preferable to free economy depends on our decision between the values of individual freedom and social security. Hence, to the question of whether individual freedom is a higher value than social security or vice versa, only a subjective answer is possible,&quot;

Five principal areas of concern for Kelsen in the area of political philosophy can be identified among his many interests for their centrality and the effect which they exerted over virtually his entire lifetime. These are; (i) Sovereignty, (ii) Law-state identity theory, (iii) State-society dualism, (iv) Centralization-decentralization, and (v) Dynamic theory of law.

===Sovereignty===

The definition and redefinition of sovereignty for Kelsen in the context of twentieth century modern law became a central theme for the political philosophy of Hans Kelsen from 1920 to the end of his life. The sovereignty of the state defines the domain of jurisdiction for the laws which govern the state and its associated society. The principles of explicitly defined sovereignty became of increasing importance to Kelsen as the domain of his concerns extended more comprehensively into international law and its manifold implications following the conclusion of WWI. The very regulation of international law in the presence of asserted sovereign borders either presented a major barrier for Kelsen in the application of principles in international law, or represented areas where the mitigation of sovereignty could greatly facilitate the progress and effectiveness of international law in geopolitics.

===Law–state identity theory===
The understanding of Kelsen&#x27;s highly functional reading of the identity of law and state continues to represent one of the most challenging barriers to students and researchers of law approaching Kelsen&#x27;s writings for the first time. After Kelsen completed his doctoral dissertation on the political philosophy of Dante, he turned to the study of Jellinek&#x27;s dualist theory of law and state in Heidelberg in the years leading to 1910. Kelsen found that although he had a high respect for Jellinek as a leading scholar of his day, that Jellinek endorsement of a dualist theory of law and state was an impediment to the further development of a legal science which would be supportive of the development of responsible law throughout the twentieth century in addressing the requirements of the new century for the regulation of its society and of its culture. Kelsen&#x27;s highly functional reading of the state was the most compatible manner he could locate for allowing for the development of positive law in a manner compatible with the demands of twentieth century geopolitics.

===State–society distinctions and delineations===
After accepting the need for endorsing an explicit reading of the identity of law and state, Kelsen remained equally sensitive to recognizing the need for society to nonetheless express tolerance and even encourage the discussion and debate of philosophy, sociology, theology, metaphysics, sociology, politics, and religion. Culture and society were to be regulated by the state according to legislative and constitutional norms. Kelsen recognized the province of society in an extensive sense which would allow for the discussion of religion, natural law, metaphysics, the arts, etc., for the development of culture in its many and varied attributes. Very significantly, Kelsen came to the strong inclination in his writings that the discussion of justice, as one example, was appropriate to the domain of society and culture, though its dissemination within the law was highly narrow and dubious. A twentieth century version of modern law, for Kelsen, would need to very carefully and appropriately delineate the responsible discussion of philosophical justice if the science of law was to be allowed to progress in an effective manner responding to the geopolitical and domestic needs of the new century.

===Centralization and decentralization===

A common theme which was unavoidable for Kelsen within the many applications he encountered of his political philosophy was that of centralization and decentralization. For Kelsen, centralization was a philosophically key position to the understanding of the pure theory of law. The pure theory of law is in many ways dependent upon the logical regress of its hierarchy of superior and inferior norms reaching a centralized point of origination in the hierarchy which he termed the basic norm, or &quot;Grundnorm&quot;. In Kelsen&#x27;s general assessments, centralization was to often be associated with more modern and highly developed forms of enhancements and improvements to sociological and cultural norms, while the presence of decentralization was a measure of more primitive and less sophisticated observations concerning sociological and cultural norms.

===Dynamic theory of law===
The dynamic theory of law is singled out in this subsection discussing the political philosophy of Hans Kelsen for the very same reasons which Kelsen applied in separating its explication from the discussion of the static theory of law within the pages of &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot;. The dynamic theory of law is the explicit and very acutely defined mechanism of state by which the process of legislation allows for new law to be created, and already established laws to be revised, as a result of political debate in the sociological and cultural domains of activity. Kelsen devotes one of his longest chapters in the revised version of &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot; to discussing the central importance he associated with the dynamic theory of law. Its length of nearly one hundred pages is suggestive of its central significance to the book as a whole and may almost be studied as an independent book in its own right complementing the other themes which Kelsen covers in this book.

==Reception and criticism==
This section delineates the reception and criticism of Kelsen&#x27;s writings and research throughout his lifetime. It also explicates the reaction of his scholarly reception after his death in 1973 concerning his intellectual legacy. Throughout his lifetime, Kelsen maintained a highly authoritative position representing his wide range of contributions to the theory and practice of law. Few scholars in the study of law were able to match his ability to engage and often polarize legal opinion during his own lifetime and extending well into his legacy reception after his death. One significant example of this involves his introduction and development of the term &quot;Grundnorm&quot; which can be briefly summarized to illustrate the diverse responses which his opinion was able to often stimulate in the legal community of his time. The short version of its reception is illustrative of many similar debates with which Kelsen was involved at many points in his career and may be summarized as follows.
===The &quot;Grundnorm&quot;===
Regarding Kelsen&#x27;s original use of the term &quot;Grundnorm&quot;, its closest antecedent appears in writings of his colleague at the University of Vienna. Merkl was developing a structural research approach for the understanding of law as a matter of the hierarchical relationship of norms, largely on the basis of their being either superior, the one to the other, or inferior with respect to each other. Kelsen adapted and assimilated much of Merkl&#x27;s approach into his own presentation of the &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot; in both its original version (1934) and its revised version (1960). For Kelsen, the importance of the &quot;Grundnorm&quot; was in large measure two-fold since it importantly indicated the logical regress of superior relationships between norms as they led to the norm which ultimately would have no other norm to which it was inferior. Its second feature was that it represented the importance which Kelsen associated with the concept of a fully centralized legal order in contrast to the existence of decentralized forms of government and representing legal orders.

Another form of the reception of the term originated from the fairly extended attempt to read Kelsen as a neo-Kantian following his early engagement with Hermann Cohen&#x27;s work in 1911, the year his &quot;Habilitation&quot; dissertation on public law was published. Cohen was a leading neo-Kantian of the time and Kelsen was, in his own way, receptive to many of the ideas which Cohen had expressed in his published book review of Kelsen&#x27;s writing. Kelsen had insisted that he had never used this material in the actual writing of his own book, though Cohen&#x27;s ideas were attractive to him in their own right. This has resulted in one of the longest-running debates within the general Kelsen community as to whether Kelsen became a neo-Kantian himself after the encounter with Cohen&#x27;s work, or if he managed to keep his own non-neo-Kantian position intact which he claimed was the prevailing circumstance when he first wrote his book in 1911.

The neo-Kantians, when pressing the issue, would lead Kelsen into discussions concerning whether the existence of such a &quot;Grundnorm&quot; was strictly symbolic or whether it had a concrete foundation. This has led to the further division within this debate concerning the currency of the term &quot;Grundnorm&quot; as to whether it should be read, on the one hand, as part and parcel of Hans Vaihinger&#x27;s &quot;as-if&quot; hypothetical construction. On the other hand, to those seeking a practical reading, the &quot;Grundnorm&quot; corresponded to something directly and concretely comparable to a sovereign nation&#x27;s federal constitution, under which would be organized all of its regional and local laws, and no law would be recognized as being superior to it.

In different contexts, Kelsen would indicate his preferences in different ways, with some neo-Kantians asserting that late in life Kelsen largely abided by the symbolic reading of the term when used in the neo-Kantian context, and as he has documented. The neo-Kantian reading of Kelsen can further be subdivided into three subgroups, with each representing their own preferred reading of the meaning of the Grundnorm, which were identifiable as (a) the Marburg neo-Kantians, (b) the Baden neo-Kantians, and (c) his own Kelsenian reading of the neo-Kantian school (during his &quot;analytico-linguistic&quot; phase circa 1911–1915) with which his writings on this subject are often associated.

===Reception during Kelsen&#x27;s European years===
This section covers Kelsen&#x27;s years in Austria, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Switzerland. While still in Austria, Kelsen entered the debate on the versions of Public Law prevailing in his time by engaging the predominating opinions of Jellinek and Gerber in his 1911 Habilitation dissertation (see description above). Kelsen, after attending Jellinek&#x27;s lectures in Heidelberg oriented his interpretation according to the need to extend Jellinek&#x27;s research past the points which Jellinek had set as its limits. For Kelsen, the effective operation of a legal order required that it be separated from political influences in terms which exceeded substantially the terms which Jellinek had adopted as its preferred form. In response to his 1911 dissertation, Kelsen was challenged by the neo-Kantians, originally led by Hermann Cohen, who maintained that there were substantial neo-Kantian insights which were open to Kelsen, which Kelsen himself did not appear to develop to the full extent of their potential interpretation as summarized in the section above. Sara Lagi in her book on Kelsen and his 1920s writings on democracy has articulated the revised and guarded reception of Jellinek by Kelsen. Kelsen was the principal author of the passages for the incorporation of judicial review in the Constitutions of Austria and Czechoslovakia during the 1910s largely on the model of John Marshall and the American Constitutional experience.

In addition to this debate, Kelsen had initiated a separate discussion with Carl Schmitt on questions relating to the definition of sovereignty and its interpretation in international law. Kelsen became deeply committed to the principle of the adherence of the state to the rule of law above political controversy, while Schmitt adhered to the divergent view of the state deferring to political fiat. The debate had the effect of polarizing opinion not only throughout the 1920s and 1930s leading up to WWII, but has also extended into the decades after Kelsen&#x27;s death in 1973.

A third example of the controversies with which Kelsen was involved during his European years surrounded the severe disenchantment which many felt concerning the political and legal outcomes of WWI and the Treaty of Versailles. Kelsen believed that the blamelessness associated with Germany&#x27;s political leaders and military leaders indicated a gross historical inadequacy of international law which could no longer be ignored. Kelsen devoted much of his writings from the 1930s and leading into the 1940s towards reversing this historical inadequacy which was deeply debated until ultimately Kelsen succeeded in contributing to the international precedent of establishing war crime trials for political leaders and military leaders at the end of WWII at Nuremberg and Tokyo.

===Critical reception during his American years===
This section covers Kelsen&#x27;s years during his American years. Kelsen&#x27;s participation and his part in the establishment of war crimes tribunals following WWII has been discussed in the previous section. The end of WWII and the start of the United Nations became a significant concern for Kelsen after 1940. For Kelsen, in principle, the United Nations represented in potential a significant phase change from the previous League of Nations and its numerous inadequacies which he had documented in his previous writings. Kelsen wrote his 700-page treatise on the United Nations, along with a subsequent two hundred page supplement, which became a standard text book on studying the United Nations for over a decade in the 1950s and 1960s.

Kelsen also became a significant contributor to the Cold War debate in publishing books on Bolshevism and communism, which he reasoned were less successful forms of government when compared to democracy. This, for Kelsen, was especially the case when dealing with the question of the compatibility of different forms of government in relation to the &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot; (1934, first edition).

The completion of Kelsen&#x27;s second edition of his magnum opus on &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot; published in 1960 had at least as large an effect upon the international legal community as did the first edition published in 1934. Kelsen was a tireless defender of the application legal science in defending his position and was constantly confronting detractors who were unconvinced that the domain of legal science was sufficient to its own subject matter. This debate has continued well into the twenty-first century as well.

Two critics of Kelsen in the United States were the legal realist Karl Llewellyn and the jurist Harold Laski. Llewellyn, as a firm anti-positivist against Kelsen stated, &quot;I see Kelsen&#x27;s work as utterly sterile, save in by-products that derive from his taking his shrewd eyes, for a moment, off what he thinks of as &#x27;pure law.&#x27;&quot; In his democracy essay of 1955, Kelsen took up the defense of representative democracy made by Joseph Schumpeter in Schumpeter&#x27;s book on democracy and capitalism. Although Schumpeter took a position unexpectedly favorable to socialism, Kelsen felt that a rehabilitation of the reading of Schumpeter&#x27;s book more amicable to democracy could be defended and he quoted Schumpter&#x27;s strong conviction that, to &quot;realize the relative validity of one&#x27;s convictions and yet stand for them unflinchingly,&quot; as consistent with his own defense of democracy. Kelsen himself made mixed statements concerning the extensiveness of the greater or lesser strict association of democracy and capitalism.

===Critical reception of Kelsen&#x27;s legacy after 1973===
Many of the controversies and critical debates during his lifetime continued after Kelsen&#x27;s death in 1973. Kelsen&#x27;s ability to polarize opinion among established legal scholars continued to influence the reception of his writings well after his death. The formation of the European Union recalled many of his debates with Schmitt on the issue of the degree of centralization which would in principle be possible, and what the implications concerning state sovereignty would be once the unification was put into place. Kelsen&#x27;s contrast with Hart as representing two distinguishable forms of legal positivism has continued to be influential in distinguishing between Anglo-American forms of legal positivism from Continental forms of legal positivism. The implications of these contrasting forms continues to be part of the continuing debates within legal studies and the application of legal research at both the domestic and the international level of investigation.

==Hans Kelsen Institute and Hans Kelsen Research Center==
For the occasion of Hans Kelsen&#x27;s 90th birthday, the Austrian federal government decided on 14 September 1971 to establish a foundation bearing the name &quot;Hans Kelsen-Institut&quot;. The Institut became operational in 1972. Its task is to document the &quot;Pure Theory of Law&quot; and its dissemination in Austria and abroad, and to inform about and encourage the continuation and development of the pure theory. To this end it produces, through the publishing house Manz, a book series that currently runs to more than 30 volumes. The Institut administers the rights to Kelsen&#x27;s works and has edited several works from his unpublished papers, including &quot;General Theory of Norms&quot; (1979, translated 1991) and &quot;Secular Religion&quot; (2012, written in English). The Institut&#x27;s database is free online with login registration. The founding directors of the Institut, Kurt Ringhofer and Robert Walter, held their posts until their deaths respectively in 1993 and 2010. The current directors are Clemens Jabloner (since 1993) and Thomas Olechowski (since 2011).

In 2006, the Hans-Kelsen-Forschungsstelle (Hans Kelsen Research Center) was founded under the direction of Matthias Jestaedt at the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg. After Jestaedt&#x27;s appointment at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg in 2011, the center was transferred there. The Hans-Kelsen-Forschungsstelle publishes, in cooperation with the Hans Kelsen-Institut and through the publishing house Mohr Siebeck, a historical-critical edition of Kelsen&#x27;s works which is planned to reach more than 30 volumes; as of August 2023, the first eight volumes have been published by Mohr-Siebeck publishers.

An extensive biography of Kelsen by Thomas Olechowski, &quot;Hans Kelsen: Biographie eines Rechtswissenschaftlers&quot; (&quot;Hans Kelsen: Biography of a Legal Scientist&quot;), was published in May 2020.

<text>Mashramani, often abbreviated to &quot;Mash&quot;, is an annual festival that celebrates Guyana becoming a Republic in 1970.

 The festival, usually held on 23 February – Guyanese Republic Day – includes a parade, music, games and cooking and is intended to commemorate the &quot;Birth of the Republic&quot;. In 2016, the Mashramani parade was held on 26 May, the 50th anniversary of Guyana&#x27;s independence, but the remainder of the celebration was held on the traditional February date.

The word &quot;Mashramani&quot; is derived from an Amerindian word and in Guyanese English means &quot;celebration after cooperative or hard work&quot;. It is one of the most colourful of all the country&#x27;s festivals, and one of the few that involves all Guyanese ethnic groups. There are spectacular costume competitions, float parades, masquerade bands, and dancing in the streets to the accompaniment of steel band music and calypsos. Masquerades frequent the streets performing acrobatic dance routines, a vivid reminder of Guyana&#x27;s African heritage. Calypso, soca, chutney-soca, and chutney music competitions are another integral part of Mashramani, and this culminates in the coronation of a King or Queen for the particular year.

==Origin==
The Jaycees of Linden had, since Guyana became independent in 1966, been organizing an Independence Carnival in Mackenzie. When Guyana became a Republic in February 23, 1970, they formed a Jaycees Republic Celebrations Committee. Basil Butcher was selected as Chairman but due to his being selected to tour Australia with the West Indies Cricket Team, Jim Blackman was appointed as the Deputy to carry on. A broad based committee including resource personnel such as Wordsworth McAndrew, Arthur Seymour, and Adrian Thompson, began the organization of the Carnival activities.

The search for a name to replace Carnival began and it was suggested by Basil Butcher that an Amerindian name be chosen. This was agreed to and several individuals including Mr. Allan Fiedtkou, an Amerindian, were contacted. Mr. Fiedtkou held discussions with his grandfather who explained a type of Festival that was held by Amerindians whenever they gather to celebrate a special event. This event he said was like &quot;Muster Many&quot; (or Mashirimehi in Amerindian) and sounded in Arawak like Mashramani. Steps were taken to confirm this. Adrian Thomson concluded that since no one could have confirmed or denied that the Arawak word for Festival was Mashramani, then the Festival could be called Mashramani. On 23 February 1970 the Festival called &quot;Mashramani&quot; was a huge success with people drawn from all Regions of Guyana to Linden welcoming Guyana&#x27;s status as a republic with over three days of frolic and fun. The mashramani first One thousand strong Costume revolver is known as Ms.Una Garner, which ever region in guyana that her costume was taken to participate in mashramani celebration she defeated an uphold her crown.

After witnessing the massive crowds, glitter and level of competition, Mr. David Singh, a Government Official, held discussion with the Jaycees Committee about bringing the event to Georgetown, the nation&#x27;s capital. Approval was also given by the then President Forbes Burnham for Mash to be a National Event for the Republic celebration. Mash activities were rotated in Linden, Berbice and Georgetown but due to sponsorship, the Costume Bands contest remained in Georgetown.

==Celebration==

With Guyana being as large as it is, people travel from miles out of town to be a part of the celebrations, with children, food and all, because they see this day as a day of celebration. The Mash Day depicts a hive of activity from Vlissingen and Irving streets all the way to the National Park, with an air of expectancy. Thousands of people summon to the streets to participate in the annual Mashramani celebrations, which has been a part of Guyanese culture for over 50 years.

<text>Pollepel Island is a uninhabited island in the Hudson River in New York, United States. The principal feature on the island is Bannerman&#x27;s Castle, an abandoned military surplus warehouse.

==Description==
Pollepel Island has been called many different names, including Pollopel Island, Pollopel&#x27;s Island, Bannerman&#x27;s Island, and Bannermans&#x27; Island. &quot;&quot; is a Dutch word meaning &quot;(pot) ladle&quot;

The island is about north of New York City and about from the Hudson River&#x27;s eastern bank. It covers about , most of it rock.

==Early history==
Pollepel Island was encountered 
by the Europeans during the first navigation of the Hudson River by early Dutch settlers in the Province of New York, at the &quot;Northern Gate&quot; of the Hudson Highlands. During the Revolutionary War, patriots attempted to prevent the British from passing upriver by emplacing 106 &quot;chevaux de frise&quot; (upright logs tipped with iron points) between the island and Plum Point across the river (see Hudson River Chains). Caissons from several &quot;chevaux de frise&quot; still rest at the river bottom. Still, these obstructions did not stop a British flotilla from burning Kingston in 1777. General George Washington later signed a plan to use the island as a military prison; however, there is no evidence that a prison was ever built there.

==Bannerman&#x27;s Castle==
===Origin===
Francis Bannerman VI was born on March 24, 1851, in Scotland, and immigrated to the United States with his parents in 1854. His grandfather was from Dundee, Scotland where he worked as a &quot;linenman&quot;. The family moved to Brooklyn in 1858 and began a military surplus business near the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1865 purchasing surplus military equipment at the close of the American Civil War.

In 1867 the business occupied a ship chandlery on Atlantic Avenue engaged in the purchase of worn rope for papermaking. The store on the 500-block of Broadway opened in 1897 to outfit volunteers for the Spanish–American War. The business bought weapons directly from the Spanish government before it evacuated Cuba; and then purchased over 90 percent of the Spanish guns, ammunition, and equipment captured by the United States military and auctioned off by the United States government. Bannerman&#x27;s illustrated mail order catalog expanded to 300 pages; and later became a reference for collectors of antique military equipment.

Bannerman purchased Pollepel island in November 1900, for use as a storage facility for his growing surplus business. Because his storeroom in New York City was not large enough to provide a safe location to store thirty million surplus munitions cartridges, in the spring of 1901 he began to build an arsenal on Pollepel. Bannerman designed the buildings himself and let the constructors interpret the designs on their own.

Most of the building was devoted to the stores of army surplus but Bannerman built another castle in a smaller scale on top of the island near the main structure as a residence, often using items from his surplus collection for decorative touches. The castle, clearly visible from the shore of the river, served as a giant advertisement for his business. On the side of the castle facing the western bank of the Hudson, Bannerman cast the legend &quot;Bannerman&#x27;s Island Arsenal&quot; into the wall.

Circa 1900–1910 the US Navy re-gunned a number of older ships. Bannerman bought the old guns, presumably at scrap value. In 1917, following the American entry into World War I, Bannerman sold a number of these weapons to the US Army, which intended to mount them on new carriages as field guns for the Western Front. Thirty 6-inch (152 mm) 30-caliber ex-Navy guns were acquired by the Army, but sources do not indicate whether any of these were sent to France. The Army&#x27;s 6-inch gun units in France primarily used former Army coast defense weapons; none of these units completed training and thus did not see action.

Construction ceased at Bannerman&#x27;s death in 1918. In August 1920, 200 pounds of shells and powder exploded in an ancillary structure, destroying a portion of the complex. Bannerman&#x27;s sales of military weapons to civilians declined during the early 20th century as a result of state and federal legislation. After the sinking of the ferryboat &quot;Pollepel&quot;, which had served the island, in a storm in 1950, the arsenal and island were essentially left vacant. The island and buildings were bought by New York State in 1967, which took possession after the old military merchandise had been removed, and the relics given to the Smithsonian. For a short time, tours of the island were given in 1968. However, on August 8, 1969, fire devastated the Arsenal, and the roofs and floors were destroyed. Following the fire, the island was placed off-limits to the public.

===Current status===

In the 21st century, the castle is the property of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation and is mostly in ruins. While portions of the exterior walls still stand, all the internal floors and non-structural walls have since burned down. The island has been the victim of vandalism, trespass, neglect, and decay. Several old bulkheads and causeways that submerge at high tide present a serious navigational hazard. On-island guided tours were made available in 2004 through the Bannerman&#x27;s Castle Trust. The castle is easily visible to riders of the Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line and the Amtrak Empire Corridor lines. One side of the castle, which carries the words &quot;Bannerman&#x27;s Island Arsenal&quot;, is also visible to southbound riders.

Sometime during the week before December 28, 2009, parts of the castle collapsed. Officials estimate 30–40 percent of the structure&#x27;s front wall and about half of the east wall fell. The collapse was reported by a motorist and by officials of Metro-North.

On April 19, 2015, the island was the destination of a kayak trip taken by Vincent Viafore and his fiancée Angelika. Viafore drowned, and Angelika was charged with his murder. On July 24, 2017, she pled guilty to criminally negligent homicide and served a short time in prison.

On June 28, 2015, the public art piece &quot;Constellation&quot; by Beacon-based artist Melissa McGill debuted on and around the castle ruins. The work consists of seventeen LEDs mounted on metal poles of varying heights, which when lighted for two hours each night are intended to create the appearance of a new constellation.

The island is maintained by The Bannerman Castle Trust, a non-profit organization of volunteers who obtain funding to stabilize and improve structures on Pollepel Island and educate the public about the island&#x27;s history. The Trust also offers guided tours of the island.

==In popular culture==
===In literature===
&quot;Bannerman Castle&quot; by Barbara Gottlock and Thom Johnson was released through Arcadia Press in August 2006. The book contains almost 200 vintage photographs, and the authors&#x27; text documents the island&#x27;s growth and decline. Proceeds from the book go to the Bannerman Castle Trust in its ongoing efforts to preserve and improve the island&#x27;s structures. Wesley Gottlock and Barbara H. Gottlock authored a children&#x27;s book called, &quot;&quot;My Name is Eleanor&quot;.&quot; It is based on photographs, interviews and journals of Eleanor Seeland. Seeland, an Ulster County resident, lived with her family who were residents of Pollepel Island in the early part of 20th century. Seeland&#x27;s father was contracted by the Bannermans for about twelve years.

The main characters in &quot;Adventures of a Cat-Whiskered Girl&quot; by Daniel Pinkwater (2010), set in the 1950s, visit Pollepel Island and hang out with a family of trolls who are squatting in the abandoned castle.

The novel &quot;The Devils That Haunt You&quot; (ebook 2016 and paperback 2018) by Rick Hoffman, takes place in part on Pollepel Island and features a fictionalized account of its construction and history.

<text>Henrietta Vinton Davis (August 25, 1860 – November 23, 1941) was an elocutionist, dramatist, and impersonator. In addition to being &quot;the premier actress of all nineteenth-century black performers on the dramatic stage&quot;, Davis was proclaimed by Marcus Garvey to be the &quot;greatest woman of the Negro race today&quot;.

Davis worked with Marcus Garvey, the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), in several capacities. From its founding in 1919 until its dissolution in the mid-1930s, she held major leadership roles in the UNIA. At the first international UNIA convention in 1920, she was elected as International Organizer. In 1927, after Garvey was deported to Jamaica, Davis was elected and served as President-General of the UNIA, Inc. from 1934-1940.

==Biography==
Henrietta Vinton Davis was born in Baltimore to Mary Ann Johnson and her husband, musician Mansfield Vinton Davis.

=== Parents ===
Shortly after her birth, her father died. Within six months her mother had remarried to an influential Baltimorean, George A. Hackett, a member of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. He worked to defeat the 1859 Jacobs bill that was crafted to enslave the children of free African Americans and deport their parents from the state of Maryland. Hackett died in April 1870 after a short illness. Upon his death Mary Ann Hackett moved with her daughter Henrietta to Washington, D.C.

=== Educational background ===
Henrietta was educated in the public schools.

== Career ==

=== Teaching ===
At the early age of fifteen, she passed the necessary examination and was awarded the position of a teacher in the public schools of Maryland.

After a period of time teaching in Maryland, Davis moved to Louisiana to teach. She later returned to Maryland to care for her ailing mother. She had the certificate of the Board of Education.

=== Administrative Work ===
In 1878, while still in her late teens, she became the first African-American woman to be employed by the Office of the Recorder of Deeds in Washington, D.C.; she worked as a copyist under George A. Sheridan. In 1881, noted abolitionist, civil rights activist, and Davis&#x27; family friend Frederick Douglass was appointed Recorder of Deeds.

=== Drama and Performances ===
In the early 1880s, Davis began elocution and dramatic art lessons under the tutelage of Marguerite Saxton of Washington. On April 25, 1883, she was introduced by Frederick Douglass before a distinguished integrated audience. She appeared in performances in New London, Connecticut; New York state, Boston, Massachusetts; and &quot;more than a dozen of the larger cities of the Eastern and Middle States&quot;.

During the summer of 1883, Davis (under the management of James Monroe Trotter and William H. Dupree) made a tour of Boston, Worcester, and New Bedford, Massachusetts; Providence and Newport, Rhode Island; Hartford and New Haven, Connecticut; and New York City and Albany.

During this time she continued perfecting her craft under Professor Edwin Lawrence of New York and Rachael Noah of Boston. She also attended the Boston School of Oratory.

Her performances consisted of performing a diverse spectrum of works: from Paul Laurence Dunbar&#x27;s Negro dialects to such plays as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;As You Like It&quot;; &quot;Mary Queen of Scots&quot;; &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Dying Speech&quot;; &quot;The Battle&quot; by Friedrich Schiller; and &quot;How Tom Sawyer Got His Fence Whitewashed&quot; by Mark Twain. She is considered the first African American after Ira Aldridge to have successfully performed Shakespeare. On January 17, 1884, she appeared before a crowded house in Melodeon Hall, Cincinnati, Ohio. From 1884 to 1886, she appeared in various Shakespearean and classical tragedy roles with John A. Arneaux&#x27;s troupe in New York City.

In 1893 Davis started her own company in Chicago, traveled to the Caribbean, and collaborated on writing &quot;Our Old Kentucky Home&quot; with distinguished journalist and future Garveyite John Edward Bruce.

Throughout her entire career, Davis only performed in four full-length productions: &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot; (1884), &quot;Dessalines&quot; (1893), &quot;Our Old Kentucky Home&quot; (1898), and &quot;Henri Christophe&quot; (1912).

==Political activism==
Davis was a supporter of the Populist Party. Later she backed the Socialist Party.

===UNIA-ACL Leadership===

==== 1919-1920: Founding of the Organization ====
While traveling in the Caribbean, Davis learned of the work of Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican immigrant to the United States who founded a Pan-African movement. On June 15, 1919, she was among the guests who spoke at a meeting of the UNIA held at the Palace Casino in Harlem, New York City.

She performed a rendition of &quot;Little Brown Baby With Sparkling Eyes&quot; by Paul Laurence Dunbar. As part of her presentation, she held an African-American doll, one of the earliest manufactured. Her prop had been loaned for the occasion by the Berry &amp; Ross company. She decided to give up her career to work with Garvey and the UNIA-ACL, elected in 1920 as the UNIA&#x27;s first International Organizer. She also served as the second Vice-President of the Black Star Line.

At the UNIA-ACL convention in August 1920, she was one of the signatories of The Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World. Among the 54 declarations made in this document are resolutions that the colors red, black, and green are to be the symbolic colors of the African race and the term &quot;nigger&quot; cease being used. It demanded that the word &quot;Negro&quot; be written with a capital &quot;N&quot;. During the same convention, the High Potentate of the UNIA conferred upon her the title &quot;Lady Commander of the Sublime Order of the Nile&quot;.

====1921-1934: Expansion of Executive Leadership ====
In 1921, Davis rose in rank to become the fourth assistant President-General of the UNIA-ACL. She established UNIA-ACL divisions in Cuba, Guadeloupe, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; Port-au-Prince, Haiti; Trinidad and Tobago, and Jamaica. Unseated by Garvey in June 1923 in an effort to quell dissent in the UNIA&#x27;s New York headquarters, she was reelected during the August 1924 convention. On August 25, 1924, Davis chaired the annual convention as the Fourth-Assistant President General of the UNIA. In December, she traveled to Liberia, West Africa, as the only woman in the UNIA delegation, which was seeking consent to establish a UNIA-ACL colony in Liberia. In that same year she was a member of a committee that delivered petitions to U.S. President Calvin Coolidge seeking Garvey&#x27;s exoneration on mail fraud charges. In 1925, she organized a trip through the Caribbean, taking with her Maymie de Mena as translator.

At the 1929 International Convention of the UNIA, after Garvey had been deported to Jamaica, Davis was elected UNIA Secretary General. By 1932 she broke with Garvey and became first Assistant President General of the rival UNIA, Inc. In the 1934 convention she was elected as President of the rival organization. She served in this role until 1940.

=== Death and burial ===
On November 23, 1941, Davis died in Saint Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital, Washington, D.C., at the age of 81. She was originally buried in Columbian Harmony Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Her remains were transferred to National Harmony Memorial Park in Landover, Maryland, in 1959, after Columbian Harmony closed that year.

==Legacy==
In 2014, American feminist playwright Carolyn Gage paid tribute to Henrietta Vinton Davis, along with actresses and directors Eva Le Gallienne and Minnie Maddern Fiske, when she was awarded the first Lifetime Achievement Award given by Venus Theatre, founded by Deborah Randall in Laurel, Maryland. In her acceptance speech, Gage said about Davis:She was well aware that the classical canon was by and about white people and she embraced the work of contemporary Black playwrights attempting to write new epic plays. She produced and performed in plays about the successful slave rebellion in Haiti, and she co-wrote a musical called &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot;. Unlike other plantation shows, Henrietta’s play included the war, and the entire second act portrayed formerly enslaved people taking over the plantation of their former captors. Not surprisingly, her theatre company ended up broke and stranded in Denver. An opinion by some people is that, since Henrietta was so far ahead of her time, she has largely been written out of the history of Black theatre.

<text>Salix viminalis, the basket willow, common osier or osier, is a species of willow native to Europe, Western Asia, and the Himalayas.

==Description==
&quot;Salix viminalis&quot; is a multistemmed shrub growing to between (rarely to ) tall. It has long, erect, straight branches with greenish-grey bark. The leaves long and slender, 10–25 cm long but only 0.5–2 cm broad; they are dark green above, with a silky grey-haired underside. The flowers are catkins, produced in early spring before the leaves; they are dioecious, with male and female catkins on separate plants. The male catkins are yellow and oval-shaped; the female catkins are longer and more cylindrical; they mature in early summer when the fruit capsules split open to release the numerous minute seeds.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is commonly found by streams and other wet places. The exact native range is uncertain due to extensive historical cultivation; it is certainly native from central Europe east to western Asia, but may also be native as far west as southeastern England. As a cultivated or naturalised plant, it is widespread throughout both Britain and Ireland, but only at lower altitudes. It is one of the least variable willows, but it will hybridise with several other species.

==Uses==
Along with other related willows, the flexible twigs (called withies) are commonly used in basketry, giving rise to its alternative common name of &quot;basket willow&quot;. In his History of the Peloponnesian War, the ancient historian Thucydides describes using osier in 425 BCE to construct makeshift shields. Cultivation and use of the common osier was common in England in the 18th and 19th century, with osier beds lining many rivers and streams.

Other uses occur in energy forestry, effluent treatment, wastewater gardens, and cadmium phytoremediation for water purification.

&quot;Salix viminalis&quot; is a known hyperaccumulator of cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, petroleum hydrocarbons, organic solvents, MTBE, TCE and byproducts, selenium, silver, uranium, and zinc, and as such is a prime candidate for phytoremediation. For more information, see the list of hyperaccumulators.

==Ecology==

Among the most common pathogens on &quot;S. viminalis&quot; are &quot;Melampsora&quot; spp. Female plants are more severely infected than male plants.

<doc id="1290268" wikidata="Q3075246" url="?curid=1290268" title="Nested function">
<text>In computer programming, a nested function (or nested procedure or subroutine) is a named function that is defined within another, enclosing, block and is lexically scoped within the enclosing block meaning it is only callable by name within the body of the enclosing block and can use identifiers declared in outer blocks, including outer functions. The enclosing block is typically, but not always, another function.
Programming language support for nested functions varies. With respect to structured programming languages, it is supported in some outdated languages such as ALGOL, Simula 67 and Pascal and in the commonly used JavaScript. It is commonly supported in dynamic and functional languages.
However, it is not supported in some commonly used languages including standard C and C++.

Other programming technologies provide similar benefit. For example, a lambda function also allows for a function to be defined inside of a function (as well as elsewhere) and allows for similar data hiding and encapsulation. Notably, a lambda function has no name (is anonymous) and therefore cannot be called by name and has no visibility aspect.

== Attributes ==

The scope of a nested function is the block that contains it be it a function block or block within a function body. It is not visible (cannot be called by name) outside its containing block.

A nested function can use identifiers (i.e. the name of functions, variables, types, classes) declared in any enclosing block, except when they are masked by inner declarations with the same names.

A nested function can be declared within a nested function, recursively, to form a deeply nested structure. 
A deeply nested function can access identifiers declared in all of its enclosing blocks, including enclosing functions.

Nested functions may in certain situations lead to the creation of a closure. If it is possible for the nested function to escape the enclosing function, for example if functions are first class objects and a nested function is passed to another function or returned from the enclosing function, then a closure is created and calls to this function can access the environment of the original function. The frame of the immediately enclosing function must continue to be alive until the last referencing closure dies and non-local automatic variables referenced in closures can therefore not be stack allocated in languages that allow the closure to persist beyond the lifetime of the enclosing block. This is known as the funarg problem and is a key reason why nested functions was not implemented in some simpler languages as it significantly complicates code generation and analysis, especially when functions are nested to various levels, sharing different parts of their environment.

== Value ==

The nested function technology allows a programmer to write source code that includes beneficial attributes such as information hiding, encapsulation and decomposition. The programmer can divide a task into subtasks which are only meaningful within the context of the task such that the subtask functions are hidden from callers that are not designed to use them.

Block scoping allows functions to share the state of enclosing blocks (including enclosing functions) without passing parameters or using global variables.

== Uses ==

=== Helper ===

A nested function typically acts as a helper function or a recursive function.

=== Control flow ===

Nested functions can be used for unstructured control flow, by using the return statement for general unstructured control flow. This can be used for finer-grained control than is possible with other built-in features of the language – for example, it can allow early termination of a for loop if codice_1 is not available, or early termination of a nested for loop if a multi-level codice_1 or exceptions are not available.

=== Higher-order functions ===

In some languages, it is possible to create a nested function that accesses a set of parameters from the outer function, that is a closure, and have that function be the outer function&#x27;s return value. Thus it is possible to return a function that is set to fulfill a certain task with little or no further parameters given to it, which can increase performance quite significantly.

== Examples ==

=== Simple example ===

A simple example in Pascal:

function E(x: real): real;
 function F(y: real): real;
 begin
 F := x + y
 end;
begin
 E := F(3) + F(4)
end;

The function codice_3 is nested within codice_4. Note that codice_4&#x27;s parameter codice_6 is also visible in codice_3 (as codice_3 is a part of codice_4) while both codice_6 and codice_11 are invisible outside codice_4 and codice_3 respectively.

Similarly, in Standard ML:
fun e (x : real) =
 let
 fun f y = x+y
 in
 f 3 + f 4
 end;
In Haskell:
e :: Float -&gt; Float
e x = f 3 + f 4 where f y = x + y
In PL/I:

In Python:
def e(x: float) -&gt; float:
 def f(y: float) -&gt; float:
 return x + y
 return f(3.0) + f(4.0)
In GNU C which extends standard C with nested functions:
float E(float x)
 float F(float y)
 return x + y;
 return F(3) + F(4);


=== Quicksort ===

The following is an implementation of quicksort:

void sort(int *items, int size) {
 void quickSort(int first, int last) {
 void swap(int p, int q) {
 int tmp = items[p];
 items[p] = items[q];
 items[q] = tmp;
 
 int partition() {
 int pivot = items[first], index = first;
 swap(index, last);
 for (int i = first; i &lt; last; i++)
 if (items[i] &lt; pivot)
 swap(index++, i);
 swap(index, last);
 return index;

 if (first &lt; last) {
 int pivotIndex = partition();
 quickSort(first, pivotIndex - 1);
 quickSort(pivotIndex + 1, last);
 }
 quickSort(0, size - 1);


The following is an implementation of the Hoare partition based quicksort using C++11 lambda expression syntax which is an alternative technology that also allows hiding a function inside a function:
template&lt;typename RandomAccessIterator&gt;
auto Sort(RandomAccessIterator Begin, RandomAccessIterator End)-&gt;void {
 auto Partition = [&amp;]() {
 //Hoare partition scheme
 auto &amp;Pivot = *Begin;
 auto ForwardCursor = Begin;
 auto BackwardCursor = End - 1;
 auto PartitionPositionFound = false;
 auto LocatePartitionPosition = [&amp;]() {
 while (*ForwardCursor &lt; Pivot)
 ++ForwardCursor;
 while (Pivot &lt; *BackwardCursor)
 --BackwardCursor;
 if (ForwardCursor &gt;= BackwardCursor)
 PartitionPositionFound = true;
 else
 Swap(*ForwardCursor, *BackwardCursor);
 //Trivial helper function
 auto MoveOnAndTryAgain = [&amp;]() {
 ++ForwardCursor;
 --BackwardCursor;
 //Brief outline of the actual partition process
 while (true) {
 LocatePartitionPosition();
 if (PartitionPositionFound)
 return BackwardCursor + 1;
 else
 MoveOnAndTryAgain();
 };
 //Brief outline of the quicksort algorithm
 if (Begin &lt; End - 1) {
 auto PartitionPosition = Partition();
 Sort(Begin, PartitionPosition);
 Sort(PartitionPosition, End);
}
== Languages ==

Notable languages supporting nested functions include:

*ALGOL-based languages such as ALGOL 68, Simula, Pascal, Modula-2, Modula-3, Oberon, PL/I, Seed7 and Ada
*Modern versions of Lisp (with lexical scope) such as Scheme, and Common Lisp
*ECMAScript (JavaScript and ActionScript)
*Dart
*Kotlin (local functions)
*Rust
*Scala (nested functions)
*Various degrees of support in scripting languages such as Ruby, Python, Lua, PHP and Perl
*GCC supports nested functions in C, as a language extension.
*C#, starting with C# 7.0
*The D language, a C-related language with nested functions.
*Fortran, starting with Fortran-90, supports &quot;a single level&quot; of nested (&quot;CONTAINed&quot;) subroutines and functions.
*MATLAB (full support)
*Wolfram Language
*Golang (Function closures)

=== Functional languages ===

In most functional programming languages, such as Scheme, nested functions are a common way of implementing algorithms with loops in them. A simple (tail) recursive inner function is created, which behaves as the algorithm&#x27;s main loop, while the outer function performs startup actions that only need to be done once. In more complex cases, a number of mutually recursive functions may be created as inner functions.

== Alternatives ==

Various alternative techniques can be used to achieve similar programming results as via nested functions.

=== Modularity ===

A common alternative is to leverage a language&#x27;s modularity technology. Some functions are exposed for use outside of the module and some are only visible within the module.

In C, this can be implemented by declaring functions and variables as &quot;static&quot; to hide them from code outside the file. This allows for data hiding, encapsulation and decomposition, but at a different level of granularity than with nested functions. This modularity does not support more than one level of nesting.

In object-oriented languages, a class typically provides a scope in which functions and state can be hidden from consumers of the class but accessible within the class. Some languages allow classes to be nested.

=== Parameters ===

To implement data hiding, functions can pass around shared data as parameters, but this increases the complexity of function calls.

In C, this is generally implemented by passing a pointer to a structure containing the shared data.

=== Lambda ===

In PHP and other languages, the lambda is an alternative. A function is defined in a code statement rather than declared with the usual function syntax. It has no name but is callable via a function reference. Such functions can be defined inside of a function as well as in other scopes. To use local variables in the anonymous function, use closure.

=== Alternatives by language ===

The following languages provide features that are similar to nested functions:

*C++ classes allow for similar data hiding and encapsulation; defining a class within a class provides similar structure (see Function object in C++)

*C++11 and later via lambda expressions (see quicksort example above)

*Eiffel explicitly disallows nesting of routines to keep the language simple; does allow the convention of using a special variable, Result, to denote the result of a (value-returning) function

*C# and Visual Basic via lambda expressions

*Java since Java 8, via lambda expressions, and in older versions, via an anonymous class containing a single method

== Implementation ==

Implementation of nested functions can be more involved than it may appear, as a reference to a nested function that references non-local variables creates a closure. For this reason nested functions are not supported in some languages such as C, C++ or Java as this makes compilers more difficult to implement. However, some compilers do support them, as a compiler specific extension. A well known example of this is the GNU C implementation of C which shares code with compilers for languages such as Pascal, Ada and Modula.

=== Access of non-local objects ===

There are several ways to implement nested procedures in a lexically scoped language, but the classic way is as follows:

:Any non-local object, X, is reached via access-links in the activation frames on the machine stack. The caller, C, assists the called procedure, P, by pushing a &quot;direct&quot; link to the &quot;latest&quot; activation of P&#x27;s immediate lexical encapsulation, (P), prior to the call itself. P may then quickly find the right activation for a certain X by following a &quot;fixed number&quot; (P.depth – X.depth) of links (normally a small number).

:The caller creates this direct link by (itself) following C.depth – P.depth + 1 older links, leading up to the latest activation of (P), and then &quot;temporarily&quot; bridging over these with a direct link to that activation; the link later disappears together with P, whereby the older links beneath it may come into use again.

:Note that P is visible for, and may therefore be called by, C if (P) = C / (C) / ((C)) / etc.

This original method is faster than it may seem, but it is nevertheless often optimized in practical modern compilers (using &quot;displays&quot; or similar techniques).

Another way to implement nested functions that is used by some compilers is to convert (&quot;lift&quot;) nested functions into non-nested functions (where extra, hidden, parameters replace the access links) using a process known as lambda lifting during an intermediate stage in the compilation.

=== Functions as values ===

In order for local functions with lexically scoped nonlocals to be passed as results, the language runtime code must also implicitly pass the environment (data) that the function sees inside its encapsulating function, so that it is reachable also when the current activation of the enclosing function no longer exists. This means that the environment must be stored in another memory area than (the subsequently reclaimed parts of) a chronologically based execution stack, which, in turn, implies some sort of freely dynamic memory allocation. Many older Algol based languages (or dialects thereof) does therefore not allow local functions that access nonlocals to be passed as return values, or do they not allow functions as return values at all, although passing of such functions as arguments may still be possible.

=== No-execute stacks ===

GCC&#x27;s implementation of nested functions causes a loss of no-execute stacks (NX stacks). This implementation calls nested functions through a jump instruction placed on the machine stack at runtime. This requires the stack to be executable. No-execute stacks and nested functions are therefore mutually exclusive in GCC. If a nested function is used in the development of a program, then the NX stack is silently lost, unless GCC is called with the codice_14 option to alert of the condition. Software engineered using Secure Development Lifecycle often do not allow the use of nested functions in this particular compiler due to the loss of NX stacks.

<doc id="1290271" wikidata="Q5513993" url="?curid=1290271" title="GNRI Class V">
<text>The Great Northern Railway V class steam locomotives were 4-4-0 three-cylinder compound locomotives built in 1932 by Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company for the Great Northern Railway (Ireland).

==Design==

The V class was intended for the GNR&#x27;s most important passenger service, the Dublin – Belfast expresses. The S and S2 Classes that had previously served the route were giving trouble as boiler pressure had been raised to increase power and performance. This increased maintenance (particularly with broken crank axles) and as a result the boiler pressure was brought back down. This obliged the GNR to develop a more powerful engine.

George Glover designed the resultant ‘V’ class with on-site experience learnt from the design teams for the British LMS Compound 4-4-0 compound locomotives.
The locomotives were ordered from Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company and delivered in 1932. They cost £5,847, which was £3,000 less than the SG3 Class 0-6-0s built ten years before. Beyer, Peacock built only the locomotives; the GNR itself built the tenders at its works in Dundalk.

The GNR named the locomotives after birds of prey: 83 &quot;Eagle&quot;, 84 &quot;Falcon&quot;, 85 &quot;Merlin&quot;, 86 &quot;Peregrine&quot;, and 87 &quot;Kestrel&quot;. The V class were the first three-cylinder compound locomotives in Ireland. They had a round-topped firebox and Stephenson valve gear and weighed 103 tons 11 cwt including tender. The result was an engine that looked dramatically larger than their predecessor the S Class. This led to the unfounded rumour among railway workers that they had been designed for use in the USSR. As the GNR&#x27;s only compound locomotives they were often called simply &quot;The Compounds&quot;.

They were introduced for the accelerated Dublin – Belfast schedule, on which they reduced running times by up to 22 minutes. However, as for the S Class before them, the demanding timetable resulted in severe maintenance problems: hot axle boxes, connecting rod problems and boiler re-tubes. As a result, the boiler pressure was reduced by 50 lbf/in2, reducing tractive effort by 20%.

==Rebuild==
No. 87 Kestrel was the first to be rebuilt in 1946 and was the first GNR loco to receive a Harland and Wolff-built square topped Belpaire firebox. &quot;Merlin&quot; had one fitted in 1950 with its old boiler rebuilt as a spare.

The V Class was chosen to haul the new &quot;Enterprise&quot; non-stop service between Dublin and Belfast in August 1947. The premium service was limited to seven bogie coaches. In the early 1950s the ‘Pounders’ shared most of the heavy main line work with the newer VS Class but, with the introduction of new British United Traction DMUs in 1957, the class was relieved of its main duties.

==Withdrawal from service==
In October 1958 the former GNR, by then the Great Northern Railway Board or GNRB, was split between Northern Ireland&#x27;s Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) and the Republic&#x27;s CIÉ. Nos. 83, 86 and 87 went to the UTA and Nos. 84 and 85 to CIÉ. The letters ‘UT’ or ‘CIE’ were stencilled on the front buffer beams. CIÉ withdrew steam traction in 1963 and subsequently all but No. 85 &quot;Merlin&quot; were scrapped.

==Preservation==

&quot;Merlin&quot; spent its final years as a spare in Dundalk works, occasionally hauling a Dublin train. The Ulster Folk and Transport Museum rescued her from the scrapyard in 1965, acquiring its (minus tender) for £600. It was stored variously at Inchicore, Amiens Street, Dundalk, Adelaide locomotive shed in Belfast and Lisburn before finally moving to the museum&#x27;s gallery at Witham Street, Belfast, in 1969. Displayed here until 1976, it was moved to Harland and Wolff for a comprehensive overhaul organised by the Museum, the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI) and Lord Dunleath. On completion in 1982 it was moved to the RPSI&#x27;s Whitehead headquarters.

&quot;Merlin&quot; was officially returned to traffic on 30 June 1986 heading an official Belfast – Dublin &quot;Enterprise&quot; that September. Itrepeated the trip on the 40th anniversary of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; the following August, hauling the same length train as in 1947 (seven bogie coaches) and matching the timings of the original run.

Having received a further overhaul in the 1990s, &quot;Merlin&quot; continued to be leased by the RPSI and used on the main line until its boiler certificate expired in 2004. The locomotive has been overhauled since 2009 and returned to service early in 2014.

Since returning to service in 2013, it has proven very unreliable, with several high-profile failures and has never managed to make it from Dublin to Rosslare and back without some sort of failure. This is unlike the other RPSI locos, 171, 4 or indeed 186 and 461.

==Model==
An 00 gauge model of No. 85 Merlin is currently available as an etched-brass kit from Studio Scale Models. It includes transfers, brass etches and cast white metal parts.

<doc id="1290273" wikidata="Q5497674" url="?curid=1290273" title="Frederick Douglass National Historic Site">
<text>The Frederick Douglass National Historic Site, administered by the National Park Service, is located at 1411 W Street, SE, in Anacostia, a neighborhood east of the Anacostia River in Southeast Washington, D.C. United States. Established in 1988 as a National Historic Site, the site preserves the home and estate of Frederick Douglass, one of the most prominent African Americans of the 19th century. Douglass lived in this house, which he named Cedar Hill, from 1877–1878 until his death in 1895. Perched on a hilltop, the site offers a sweeping view of the U.S. Capitol and the Washington, D.C., skyline.

In 2017 the site was used to represent Washington, D.C., on its America the Beautiful quarter.

==History==

The site of the Frederick Douglass home originally was purchased by John Van Hook in about 1855. Van Hook built the main portion of the present house soon after taking possession of the property. For a portion of 1877, the house was owned by the Freedom Savings and Trust Company. Later that year, Douglass purchased the home and expanded its 14 rooms to 21, including two-story library and kitchen wings. The house has an L shape, and its plan is reminiscent of the design of Andrew Jackson Downing.

With the election of President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876, Douglass hoped for a political appointment, likely postmaster for Rochester, New York, or ambassador to Haiti. Instead, he was appointed marshal for the District of Columbia, a role which he accepted. His appointment to this highly visible position marked the first time a black man successfully received a federal appointment requiring Senate approval. Douglass, however, was not asked to fill many of the roles expected of a marshal. Typically, the marshal would attend formal White House gatherings and directly introduce guests to the President. Douglass, excused from this role, later complained that he should have resigned because of the slight. Still, the job brought him financial stability, and in 1877, with a $6,000 (~$ in ) loan from his black friend and former abolitionist Robert Purvis, he purchased the 14-room Victorian home on and named it Cedar Hill. He bought an additional around the property the following year.

In the home, Douglass became a cultivated member of high society. He and his grandson Joseph played the music of Franz Schubert in the west parlor, which served as the music room.

==Works==
After moving to his new house, Frederick Douglass read and also wrote his books in the studio that is located in the yard of the house, one of them was his last autobiographical book, &quot;Life and Times of Frederick Douglass&quot;, first published in 1881 and reissued 10 years later. His wife Anna had a stroke in 1882 which left her partially paralyzed; she died on August 4 and Douglass became depressed. &quot;The main pillar of my house has fallen&quot;, he wrote to a friend.

In 1886, Douglass published the book Three Addresses on the Relations Subsisting between the White and Colored People of the United States, and in 1895 completed his book Why is the Negro lynched?

==Marriage with Helen Pitts Douglass ==

In January 1884, Douglass applied for a marriage license at District of Columbia City Hall before heading to the home of Reverend Francis James Grimké and Charlotte Forten Grimké, where he married a white woman named Helen Pitts. The marriage, held January 2, was not approved by most members of either family. Helen&#x27;s father, an abolitionist who was previously proud to know Douglass personally, never offered his blessing and refused to visit Washington unless he knew his daughter and her husband were out of town. Douglass had hired Pitts as a clerk in 1882. She was a graduate of Mount Holyoke College and had been a teacher of freed blacks in Virginia and Indiana. Interviewed about her marriage, she responded, &quot;Love came to me and I was not afraid to marry the man I loved because of his color.&quot; One newspaper article noted, &quot;Goodbye, black blood in that family. We have no further use for him. His picture hangs in our parlor, we will hang it in the stables.&quot;

== Death of Frederick Douglass ==

On February 20, 1895, Douglass attended a women&#x27;s rights rally in Washington and was escorted to the platform by Anna Howard Shaw and Susan B. Anthony. He returned to Cedar Hill for an early supper and intended to attend a neighborhood black church. As he was telling his second wife Helen about one of the day&#x27;s speakers, he suddenly collapsed.

==Later history==
After Douglass&#x27;s death, his widow, Helen Pitts Douglass, founded the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association in 1900. In 1916, the National Association of Colored Women&#x27;s Clubs joined with the association. In the 1920s, Black architect William Augustus Hazel was commissioned to restore the house. The restoration was completed in 1922, and is believed to have been the first historic architectural preservation project by a Black architect in the United States. 

These two groups owned the house until 1962, when the federal government took the deed to the house through the National Park Service, with the intent of restoring and preserving it. Also on site are an interpretive visitor center and a reconstruction of Douglass&#x27;s &quot;Growlery&quot;, a small stone building in which he secluded himself while writing and studying. In 2017, the site was featured on the 37th quarter in the America the Beautiful Quarters series.

The Frederick Douglass National Historic Site is located about a 10-minute walk from the Anacostia Metro station.

<text>Roy Gerald Krenkel (July 11, 1918 – February 24, 1983), who often signed his work RGK, was an American illustrator who specialized in fantasy and historical drawings and paintings for books, magazines and comic books.

==Influences and study==
Krenkel was born July 11, 1918. His artwork revealed the strong influence of artist Norman Lindsay, in addition to Franklin Booth, Joseph Clement Coll and J. Allen St. John. In 1939, he was attending Cooper Union&#x27;s Art School. Before World War II he studied with George Bridgman at the Art Students League of New York. During the War he served as a Private in the U.S. Army in the Philippines. His enlistment papers of January 23, 1942, record him as living in Queens, as having graduated high school, and as single, without dependents, employed as an actor.

After the War, Krenkel attended Burne Hogarth&#x27;s classes at the Cartoonists and Illustrators School, which became the School of Visual Arts. There he met a group of young cartoonists, including Joe Orlando, Frank Frazetta and Al Williamson. Frazetta noted, &quot;I met Roy Krenkel back in 1949 or 1950, and he has never ceased to be a constant source of inspiration to me—a truly conscientious artist who will not tolerate incompetence.&quot;

Krenkel sometimes collaborated with Frazetta and Williamson on pages the trio drew for EC Comics particularly in &quot;Weird Science&quot;, &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Weird Science-Fantasy&quot;. His splash page contribution to Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Food for Thought&quot; (&quot;Incredible Science Fiction&quot; 32, November–December 1955), a highly detailed alien landscape, is often regarded as a peak achievement in comic book illustration. Krenkel only drew one solo story for EC, the unsigned &quot;Time to Leave&quot; (&quot;Incredible Science Fiction&quot; 31, September–October 1955), displaying a futuristic cityscape of architectural splendors. Krenkel inked many of Williamson&#x27;s comic stories for Marvel and American Comics Group in the 1950s as well.

He was known for regarding his own work as disposable and unimportant.

==Magazines and paperbacks==
Krenkel provided illustrations to several science fiction magazines. The writer Harry Harrison recalled, &quot;Krenkel was a master penciler. I know. When he shared a studio with me and Wally Wood, I inked one of his illustrations for &quot;Marvel Science Fiction&quot; magazine. The influence of fine artists Norman Lindsay and Alma Tadema can be seen in his work.&quot;

His work includes 23 paperback book cover paintings as well as frontispieces for Edgar Rice Burroughs and other fantasy writers published by Donald A. Wollheim at Ace Books. During the late 1960s, he created cover paintings for DAW Books and Lancer Books. When Lancer revived Robert E. Howard&#x27;s creation Conan the Barbarian, with revisions by L. Sprague de Camp, Krenkel was cited by cover artist Frazetta as a consultant. He also created preliminary roughs which Frazetta modified and used when he painted covers for Warren Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot;. Krenkel drew one-page &quot;Creepy&#x27;s Loathsome Lore&quot; and &quot;Eerie&#x27;s Monster Gallery&quot; stories as well as rough layouts and inks for &quot;H2O World&quot; with collaborator Al Williamson.

During the 1970s, he illustrated both covers and interiors for Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Sowers of the Thunder&quot; and &quot;The Road of Azrael&quot;, published by Donald M. Grant. It was at this time Krenkel created seven special paintings for a limited edition portfolio illustrating the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. He also contributed to several science fiction fanzines, including Richard A. Lupoff&#x27;s &quot;Xero&quot;, the Burroughs-oriented &quot;ERBdom&quot; and &quot;Amra&quot;, devoted to the works of Howard.

Danton Burroughs, the grandson of Edgar Rice Burroughs, commented, &quot;Roy Krenkel was a key factor in the 1960s revival of my grandfather&#x27;s writings. Krenkel&#x27;s illustrations forever secured his position as one of the all-time great Edgar Rice Burroughs illustrators.&quot;

Following his death, Krenkel&#x27;s friends Archie Goodwin and Al Williamson created the story &quot;Relic&quot;, published in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; #27, as a tribute to him.

==Awards==
In 1963, Krenkel won the Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist.

<doc id="1290281" wikidata="Q483955" url="?curid=1290281" title="Hotelier (South Korean TV series)">
<text>Hotelier is a 2001 South Korean television drama series set in Seoul Hotel, a fictional five-star hotel undergoing an expensive expansion and renovation. The word &quot;hotelier&quot; means &quot;a person who owns or runs a hotel.&quot;

Starring Bae Yong-joon, Song Yoon-ah, Kim Seung-woo and Song Hye-kyo, it aired on MBC from April 4 to July 7, 2001, on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 20 episodes. Bae&#x27;s character is based on Korean-American businessman Hong Seung-pyo.

==Synopsis==
President Choi, hotelier of Seoul Hotel, dies from a heart attack hours after his old friend Kim Bok-man informed him that his company Hankang Distribution was buying Seoul Hotel shares in preparation for a takeover. Choi is succeeded by his wife, Yoon Bong-sook, who had never assumed any managerial position in the hotel before. Her son, Choi Young-jae is a dissolute young man who refuses to work and spends all his time partying.

To fend off the competitor, Madam Yoon sends one of the hotel employees, Seo Jin-young, to America to try to rehire Seoul Hotel&#x27;s former hotel manager, Han Tae-jun, who was forced to resign after a scandal despite his innocence. Tae-jun is currently taking care of Jenny, a drug-addicted Korean-American girl.

To assist him in buying Seoul Hotel&#x27;s shares through whatever means possible, Bok-man hires Frank Shin (aka Shin Dong-hyuk), a wealthy Korean-American lawyer, businessman, and mergers and acquisitions specialist.

Frank only agrees to take the job after meeting Jin-young in America and being fascinated by her. Traveling to Seoul for the first time since he left the country as a child, Frank and his loyal business assistant Leo move into a chalet at the Seoul Hotel to better conduct their secret business deal.

Through Frank&#x27;s double dealings, Bok-man learns of Seoul Hotel&#x27;s mismanagement problems. But Frank finds himself falling in love with Jin-young, and Jin-young feels torn between him and her old friend and colleague Tae-jun.

Meanwhile, Young-jae falls for Kim Yoon-hee, a melancholic heiress and Bok-man&#x27;s daughter, after meeting her at a nightclub. But Yoon-hee is attracted to the kind and mature Tae-jun, whom she&#x27;d encountered at a birthday party held at Seoul Hotel.

Tae-jun is weighed down by his numerous responsibilities: defending the hotel from its competitors, protecting Yoon-hee from her abusive father, preventing Jin-young from falling in love with the suspicious Frank, and helping Young-jae mend his ways.

Frank soon discovers that Jenny, whom Tae-jun had rescued, is his biological sister. Together, they go to see their father, who calls them by their Korean names, Dong-hyuk and Dong-hee. His reconciliation with his family and love for Jin-young results in a change of heart for Frank, and he decides to switch sides and help Seoul Hotel.

Tae-jun and Frank work together and succeed in re-establishing Seoul Hotel&#x27;s reputation as a top hotel. Bong-sook is diagnosed with cancer and dies. Frank and Jin-young get engaged. Yoon-hee goes to Las Vegas to study business, and Tae-jun follows her abroad; in a scene after the ending credits, Tae-jun and Yoon-hee are shown reuniting on a highway road.

<text>Eugen Ehrlich (14 September 1862 – 2 May 1922) was an Austrian legal scholar and sociologist of law. He is widely regarded as one of the primary founders of the modern field of sociology of law.

==Biography==
Ehrlich was born in Czernowitz (now Chernivtsi) in the Duchy of Bukovina, at that time a province of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Ehrlich studied law in Lemberg, then in Vienna, where he taught and practised as a lawyer before returning to Czernowitz to teach at the university there, a bastion of Germanic culture at the eastern edge of the Empire.

Ehrlich remained there for the rest of his teaching career and was Rector of the University in 1906–7. During the turmoil of World War I, when Czernowitz was occupied several times by Russian forces, he moved to Switzerland. After the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the ceding of the Bukovina to Romania, Ehrlich planned to return to Czernowitz, where he would have been required to teach in Romanian, but he died of diabetes in Vienna, Austria in 1922.

==Career==

Ehrlich&#x27;s experience of the Bukovina&#x27;s legal culture, where Austrian law and sharply contrasting local custom seemed to co-exist, caused him to question the hierarchical notions of law propounded by such theorists as his fellow countryman, the jurist Hans Kelsen. Ehrlich noted that legal theories that recognized law only as a sum of statutes and court decisions gave an inadequate view of the legal reality of a community. Law, if understood sociologically, embraces much more than just state legislation and court decisions. He drew a distinction between norms for decision (Entscheidungsnormen) and social norms or norms of conduct (Lebendes Recht). The latter are created in the social interaction of people. They are rules that make everyday social association possible and stable. Such rules actually govern the life of a society and, under certain conditions, the most important of them can justifiably be regarded in popular consciousness, if not necessarily by lawyers, as law. In addition, these social norms, or &quot;living law&quot;, as Ehrlich called them, are frequently adopted and incorporated in state law. For example, commercial usage and custom may develop and be recognized and respected by courts of law and other agencies as having normative force and legal significance.

Ehrlich claimed that the living law that regulates social life may be very different from the norms for decision applied by courts, and may sometimes attract far greater cultural authority which lawyers cannot safely ignore. Norms for decision regulate only those disputes that are brought before a judicial or other tribunal. Living law is a necessary framework for the routine structuring of social relationships. Its source is in the many different kinds of social associations in which people co-exist. Its essence is not dispute and litigation, but peace and co-operation. What counts as law (again, from a sociological perspective) depends on what kind of authority exists to give it legal significance among those it is supposed to regulate.

Ehrlich&#x27;s teaching is that the sources of law&#x27;s authority are plural. Some sources are political and others are cultural. As such, political and cultural sources may conflict. But not all social norms should be thought of as &#x27;law&#x27;, in Ehrlich&#x27;s view. Legal norms (again, understood sociologically, rather than juristically) are typically distinguished from merely moral or customary ones by powerful feelings of revulsion which typically attach to breach of them. They are, thus, regarded as socially fundamental. In addition, legal norms are recognisable as such because they concern certain kinds of relationships, transactions and circumstances which he described as &#x27;facts of the law&#x27; (Tatsachen des Rechts) — specially important topics or considerations for social regulation.

<text>Fred Nicole (born 21 May 1970) is a Swiss rock climber known for his first ascents of extreme sport climbing routes, and also for pioneering the development of standards and techniques in modern bouldering in the 1990s and early 2000s; he is considered an important climber in the history of the sport.

==Climbing career==

In 1992, Nicole solved &quot;La Danse des Balrogs&quot;, in Branson, Switzerland, which is considered the first-ever in bouldering history. In 1996, he solved &quot;Radja&quot;, also in Branson, which is also now considered the first-ever graded boulder in history. 

In 2002, he solved &quot;Monkey Wedding&quot; and &quot;Black Eagle SDS&quot; in Rocklands, South Africa, which is now considered to be the first-ever graded boulder in history. In 2000, Nicole solved &quot;Dreamtime&quot; in Cresciano in Switzerland, which at the time was considered the first-ever boulder in history, but its consensus grade was subsequently softened; the beauty and challenge of &quot;Dreamtime&quot; have maintained its status as an important route in bouldering history.

Nicole has also made important first ascents in sport climbing. In 1988, he redpointed the second-ever in history with &quot;Anaïs et le canabis&quot; in Saint-Loup in Switzerland. In 1993, he redpointed the third-ever in history with &quot;&quot;, also in Saint-Loup in Switzerland.

<text>Elizabeth Robins (August 6, 1862 – May 8, 1952) was an actress, playwright, novelist, and suffragette. She also wrote as C. E. Raimond.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Robins, the first child of Charles Robins and Hannah Crow, was born in Louisville, Kentucky. After financial difficulties, her father left for Colorado, leaving the children in the care of their mother. When Hannah Crow was committed to an insane asylum, Elizabeth and the other children were sent to live with her grandmother in Zanesville, Ohio, where she was educated. It would be her grandmother who armed her with &quot;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare&quot; and her unconditional support on her endeavor to act in New York City. Her father was a follower of Robert Owen and held progressive political views. Though her father was an insurance broker, he traveled a lot during her childhood and in the summer of 1880, Robins accompanied him to mining camps and was able to attend theatre in New York and Washington along the way. Because of her intelligence, Elizabeth was one of her father&#x27;s favorite children. He wanted her to attend Vassar College and study medicine. At the age of fourteen, Robins saw her first professional play (&quot;Hamlet&quot;) which ignited her desire to pursue an acting career. From 1880 to 1888, she would have an acting career in America.

==Acting career==
After arriving in New York, Robins soon met James O&#x27;Neill, who helped her join Edwin Booth&#x27;s theatre and by 1882, she was touring. She soon grew bored and irritated playing &quot;wretched, small character parts&quot; and in 1883 joined the Boston Museum stock company. It would be here that she met her future husband, George Parks, who was also a member of the company. In 1885 Robins married Parks. Although her husband struggled to get acting parts, she was soon in great demand and would be on tour throughout their marriage. Her refusal to leave the stage may have contributed to Parks to commit suicide in 1887 by jumping off a bridge into the Charles River, stating in his suicide note, &quot;I will not stand in your light any longer.&quot; On September 3, 1888, Robins moved to London. &quot;Her move to London represented a rebirth after personal tragedy in America.&quot; Except for extended visits to the U.S. to visit family, she remained in England for the rest of her life.
At a social gathering during her first week in England, Robins met Oscar Wilde. Throughout her career, he would come see her act and give her critiques, such as in one of her roles in Frances Hodgson Burnett&#x27;s &quot;The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; in 1889. Wilde&#x27;s comment was &quot;you have definitely asserted your position as an actress of the first order. Your future on our stage is assured.&quot;

Early in her time in London, Robins became enamored with the plays of Henrik Ibsen. In 1891 a London matinee revival of &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; put Robins in contact with Marion Lea. Together they would form a joint management, making this the &quot;first step toward the theatre that Robins had dreamed of … a theatre of independent management and artistic standards.&quot; Finding work in &quot;&#x27;women&#x27;s plays&#x27; written by men like Ibsen,&quot; Robins and Lea brought strong female characters to the stage. George Bernard Shaw noted &quot;what is called the Woman Question has begun to agitate the stage.&quot; Together Elizabeth Robins and Marion Lea brought Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; to the stage for the first time ever in England. &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; &quot;marked an important step in the representation of women by dramatists&quot; and Hedda marked an important step for Elizabeth Robins, becoming her defining role. &quot;Sarah Bernhardt could not have done it better,&quot; wrote William Archer in a publication of &quot;The World&quot;. From then on, Hedda became synonymous with Robins on the English stage. Robins and Lea would go on to produce a handful of Ibsen&#x27;s other &#x27;New Woman&#x27; plays. &quot;The experience of acting and producing Ibsen&#x27;s plays and the reactions to her work helped transform Elizabeth over time into a committed supporter of women&#x27;s rights.&quot; In 1898, she joined forces with William Archer, an influential critic, and together they produced non-profit Ibsen plays. She became known in Britain as &quot;Ibsen&#x27;s High Priestess.&quot;

In 1902, Robins played Lucrezia in Stephen Phillips&#x27;s &quot;Paolo and Francesca&quot; at the St. James&#x27;s Theatre, London. Ending her acting career at the age of forty, Robins had made her mark on the English stage as not only an actress but an actress-manager.

==Writing career==
Robins realised her income from acting was not stable enough to support her fully. While Robins was busy being a successful actress, she had to leave England to look for her brother in Alaska, who had gone missing. Her experiences searching for her brother led her to write her novels, &quot;Magnetic North&quot; (written in 1904) and &quot;Come and Find Me&quot; (1908). Before this, she had written novels such as &quot;George Mandeville&#x27;s Husband&quot; (1894), &quot;The New Moon&quot; (1895), &quot;Below the Salt and Other Stories&quot; (1896) and several others under the name of C. E. Raimond. She explained her use of a pseudonym as a means of keeping her acting and writing careers separate but gave it up when the media reported that Robins and Raimond were the same. She and Florence Bell anonymously wrote the play &quot;Alan&#x27;s Wife&quot; based on the short story &quot;Befried&quot; by the Swedish author Elin Améen. She enjoyed a long career as a fiction and nonfiction writer.

In her biography of Elizabeth Robins, &quot;Staging a Life&quot;, Angela V. John says, &quot;It is possible to trace in Elizabeth&#x27;s writing from 1890s onwards an emerging feminist critique, clearly, but only partly, influenced by the psychological realism of Ibsen, which would find most confident expression in 1907 in her justly celebrated novel &quot;The Convert&quot;. Robins&#x27;s main character, Vida, speaks to &quot;male politicians and social acquaintances&quot;, something very different from what the women of Robins&#x27;s time did – something very reminiscent of one of Ibsen&#x27;s &#x27;new women.&#x27; The novel is an adaptation of Robins&#x27;s most successful play, &quot;Votes for Women!&quot; The first play to bring the &quot;street politics of women&#x27;s suffrage to the stage&quot;, &quot;Votes for Women!&quot; led to a surge of suffrage theatre. Elizabeth Robins first attended &quot;open-air meetings of the suffrage union&quot; when the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union moved its headquarters from Manchester to London in 1906. It was then that she &quot;abandoned&quot; the current play she was writing and worked to complete the very first suffrage drama. &quot;The more Robins became immersed in the work, the more she became converted to the cause&quot;.

==Women&#x27;s rights involvement==
Robins became a member of the National Union of Women&#x27;s Suffrage Societies, as well as the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union, although she broke with the WSPU over its increasing use of violent militancy. She remained a strong advocate of women&#x27;s rights, however, and used her skills as a public speaker and writer on behalf of the cause. In 1907 her book &quot;The Convert&quot; was published. It was later turned into a play that became synonymous with the suffrage movement. When the 1911 census was taken, Robins evaded enumeration and instead wrote on her form: &quot;the occupier of this house will be ready to give the desired information the moment the Government recognises women as responsible citizens&quot;.

Robins remained an active feminist throughout her life. In the 1920s she was a regular contributor to the feminist magazine, &quot;Time and Tide&quot;. She also continued to write books such as &quot;Ancilla&#x27;s Share: An Indictment of Sex Antagonism&quot;, which explored the issues of sexual inequality. She collected and edited speeches, lectures, and articles dealing with the women&#x27;s movement, some of which had never previously appeared in print (Way Stations, published by Dodd, Mead and Company, New York, 1913).

Frederick Pethick-Lawrence, 1st Baron Pethick-Lawrence credited Robins with explaining to him the difference between a suffragette and a suffragist.

Robins was involved in the campaign to allow women to enter the House of Lords. Her friend, Margaret Haig, was the daughter of Viscount Rhondda. He was a supporter of women&#x27;s rights and in his will made arrangements for Margaret to inherit his title. This was considered radical, as women did not normally inherit peerage titles. When Rhondda died in 1918 the House of Lords refused to allow Margaret, now the Viscountess Rhondda, to take her seat. Robins wrote numerous articles on the subject, but the House of Lords refused to change its decision. It was not until 1958 that women were first admitted to the House.

==Personal life==
A beautiful woman, Robins was pursued by many men. She admitted to a deep attraction to her close friend, the highly respected literary critic and fellow Ibsen scholar, William Archer. As a married man Archer was unavailable, however. Except for her brief marriage to George Parks, she remained a single woman. Highly intelligent, she was welcomed into London&#x27;s literary and artistic circles, enjoying friendships with George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, and Henry James, as well as a tempestuous romantic (but probably non-physical) relationship with the much younger future poet laureate John Masefield.

In 1900 Robins traveled alone to the gold rush camps of Alaska in search of her favorite brother Raymond Robins, whom she feared was lost in the Yukon. After a long and arduous journey, she located Raymond in Nome. She shared his life in wild and lawless Alaska throughout the summer of 1900. Her adventures were not without cost – the typhoid fever she contracted at that time compromised her health for the rest of her life. Robins&#x27;s tales about Alaska provided material for a number of articles she sent on to London for publication. Her best selling book, &quot;The Magnetic North&quot;, is an account of her experiences, as is &quot;The Alaska-Klondike Diary of Elizabeth Robins&quot;.

Although Robins rejected her father&#x27;s plans for her to be educated as a doctor, she retained a strong interest in medicine. In 1909 she met Octavia Wilberforce, the great-granddaughter of William Wilberforce, a leader of the British abolitionist movement. Octavia was a young woman whose desire to study medicine was thwarted by a family which viewed intellectualism and professional careers as &#x27;unsexing&#x27; for women. When Wilberforce&#x27;s father refused to pay for her studies and disinherited her for pursuing them, Robins and other friends provided financial and moral support until she became a doctor. While some have conjectured that Robins and Wilberforce were romantically involved, this has never been supported by scholarly material available about either woman, nor is it borne out by their own writings. Available evidence points to Robins and Wilberforce enjoying a relationship much like that of mother and daughter. In her declining years Robins developed a friendship with Virginia and Leonard Woolf. Dr Wilberforce looked after Robins until her death in 1952, just months shy of her 90th birthday.

<doc id="1290306" wikidata="Q836994" url="?curid=1290306" title="Pauperism">
<text>Pauperism (; ) is the condition of being a &quot;pauper&quot;, i.e. receiving relief administered under the Irish and English Poor Laws. From this, pauperism can also be more generally the state of being supported at public expense, within or outside of almshouses, and still more generally, of dependence for any considerable period on charitable assistance, public or private. In this sense, pauperism is to be distinguished from general poverty or the state of being a poor, although the two concepts overlap.

== History ==
Under the English Poor Laws, a person to be relieved must be a destitute person, and the moment he had been relieved he became a pauper, and as such incurred certain civil disabilities. Statistics dealing with the state of pauperism in this sense convey not the amount of destitution actually prevalent, but the particulars of people in receipt of poor law relief.

The 1830s brought to Europe great economic hardships. The early 19th century saw a tremendous rise in the populations of all the European countries. There was a scarcity of jobs and fewer employment opportunities. This resulted in more job seekers than employment. Populations from rural areas migrated to bigger towns to live in increasingly crowded slums. Small producers in town faced tough competition from cheap imported goods in England, where industrialization was comparatively superior. In those regions of Europe where aristocracy was strong and enjoyed privileges, peasants groaned under the burden of hardships. An year of bad harvest added to the miseries of the common man. The rise of food prices led to widespread pauperism.

Poverty in the interwar years (1918–1939) was responsible for several measures which largely killed off the Poor Law system. The Local Government Act 1929 officially abolished workhouses, and between 1929 and 1930 the Poor Law Guardians, the &quot;workhouse test,&quot; and the term &quot;pauper&quot; disappeared.

== Pauper apprentices ==
Pauper apprentices in England and Wales were the children of paupers who were bound out by the local parish overseers and churchwardens. Some had to travel long distances to serve in the factories of the Industrial Revolution, but the majority served their terms within a few miles of their homes.

<doc id="1290308" wikidata="Q14679585" url="?curid=1290308" title="WVNN (AM)">
<text>WVNN (770 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station licensed to Athens, Alabama, serving parts of North Alabama including Huntsville and Decatur. Owned by Cumulus Media, it airs a news/talk format. Programming on WVNN is simulcast on [[WVNN-FM]] 92.5 MHz, which is licensed to Trinity, Alabama. Collectively, the stations are branded as &quot;NewsTalk 770 AM/92.5 FM WVNN.&quot; The studios and offices are on U.S. Route 72 East in Athens.

WVNN is a daytimer station, broadcasting at 7,000 watts non-directional, with its transmitter located off Lee Highway (U.S. Route 72) in Huntsville. Because AM 770 is a clear channel frequency reserved for 50,000 watt Class A WABC in New York City, WVNN must go off the air at night to avoid interference. It abandoned its limited night signal in 2020 and operates days only with pre-sunrise and post-sunset authorization (PSSA).

==Programming==
===News and Talk===
WVNN-AM-FM feature Alabama-based shows on weekdays, including The Dale Jackson Show. Nationally syndicated conservative talk shows are heard the rest of the day with Dan Bongino in middays, and at night Mark Levin, Ben Shapiro, Chris Plante and Red Eye Radio.

Weekends feature shows on money, health, religion and the syndicated Kim Komando show on technology, as well as repeats of weekday shows. Most hours begin with an update from ABC News Radio.

===Sports===
WVNN-AM-FM formerly carried University of Alabama Crimson Tide football and Tennessee Titans football during the fall, and Alabama Vipers arena football games in the spring, as part of a simulcast with sister station, WUMP &quot;SportsRadio 730/103.9, The UMP&quot;. Aside from occasional high school football games, or some spillover games from WUMP, WVNN-AM-FM currently offer no sports programming.

==History==
===WJMW and WKSR===
WVNN is descended from two radio stations; one is WJMW, a daytimer that first signed on in 1948. WJMW&#x27;s frequency was 1010 kHz. It was powered at only 250 watts and was required to go off the air at sunset. It was owned by the Athens Broadcasting Company, founded by Homer Felix &quot;Pap&quot; Dunnavant.

The other station was also a daytimer; WKSR went on the air in 1947, on 730 AM in Pulaski, Tennessee, a town about 30 miles north of Athens. It was owned by the Pulaski Broadcasting Company and was a Mutual Broadcasting System network affiliate.

===Move to 730 and to 770===
In 1953, the Athens Broadcasting Company acquired the license for WJMW and got permission from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to move it to Athens, putting WJMW on the lower frequency. This would give the station greater range, since lower frequencies travel farther. And the power was increased to 500 watts. But it remained a daytimer, because AM 730 is a Mexican clear channel frequency. At the same time, WKSR moved to 1420 kHz, also in Pulaski, Tennessee.

The station made another move on the dial in the early 1980s, from AM 730 to AM 770. While WJMW had to now protect WABC in New York, it was more than 800 miles away. That was far enough for the FCC to allow the station to operate around the clock, with reduced power at night. The station switched its call sign to WVNN on September 26, 1988. It changed to a news/talk format, using news from ABC News Radio and talk shows from the ABC TalkRadio Network.

===Cumulus ownership===
WJMW was owned and operated by the Dunnavant family of Athens for 55 years prior to being sold to Cumulus Media as part of a four station deal in 2003. The sale ended a 55-year presence in the market for Athens Broadcasting, founded in 1948 by Pap Dunnavant.

Cumulus also acquired several other Huntsville-area stations, WHRP, WUMP, WVNN-FM, WWFF-FM and WZYP.

===Past programming===
Notable former WVNN air personalities include George Rose who, along with his alter-ego &quot;Cousin Josh&quot; character, hosted &quot;The Cousin Josh Jamboree&quot; on several North Alabama radio stations in a career that began in 1948 at then-WJMW and ended at WKAC with his death in 2006.

Several well-known talk radio hosts spent early portions of their careers at WVNN, including Sean Hannity, Peter Thiele, Kevin Miller, Keith Larson, Darla Jaye, and Mike Church. Will Anderson hosted a show on WVNN until August 2007, then returned a few years later. Tim Knox hosted a show on WVNN until December 2007.

<text>Rankine is a small lunar impact crater near the eastern limb of the Moon. It lies on the southern floor of the satellite crater Maclaurin B, a 43-kilometer-diameter feature which is located to the southeast of Maclaurin. To the east of Rankine is the crater Gilbert, and directly to the south is von Behring.

This is an insignificant, bowl-shaped formation with a negligible interior floor. The crater is circular and symmetrical, and the sloping interior walls are nearly featureless (although they have a slightly higher albedo than the surrounding terrain.) It is otherwise indistinguishable from many other comparably sized craters on the Moon.

<text>CableCARD is a special-use PC Card device that allows consumers in the United States to view and record digital cable television channels on digital video recorders, personal computers and television sets on equipment such as a set-top box not provided by a cable television company. The card is usually provided by the local cable operator, typically for a nominal monthly fee.

In a broader context, CableCARD refers to a set of technologies created by the United States cable television industry to allow devices from non-cable companies to access content on the cable networks. Some technologies not only refer to the physical card, but also to a device (&quot;Host&quot;) that uses the card. Some CableCARD technologies can be used with devices that have no physical CableCARD.

The CableCARD was the outcome of a U.S. federal government objective, directed in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to provide a robust competitive retail market for set-top boxes so consumers did not have to use proprietary equipment from the cable operators. It was believed that this would provide consumers with more choices and lower costs.

A 2020 FCC decision removed the requirement for cable companies to provide CableCARDs, but they are still required to provide consumer access options via &quot;separable security&quot;.

== Background ==
The portion of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which resulted in the creation of CableCARDs is known as Section 629, instructing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to:
Multichannel video programming refers to cable or satellite television. A driving motivation of this passage was to foster the kind of consumer choices that resulted after the Federal government landmark Carterfone ruling requiring telephone companies to allow consumers to purchase third-party telephones for attachment to the phone company network. The thought was that consumers would benefit from wider choices due to competition between consumer electronics (CE) manufacturers unaffiliated with cable companies.

The FCC was charged with working with the industry to carry out the directives of the 1996 law. On June 11, 1998, after securing proposals and recommendations from interested parties, the FCC ordered that cable companies would provide a separable security access device by July 1, 2000, which could be used by third-party devices to access digital cable networks. The separable security device was referred to in FCC regulations as a &quot;Point of Deployment&quot; (POD) module. After many requests for delay from the cable industry, the first CableCARD devices became available from third-party manufacturers in August 2004.

===Integration ban===
A major concern was that cable operators were not motivated to provide efficient security access mechanisms to equipment competitors. To address this, the FCC directed that by January 1, 2005, that cable operators must use the same separable access device available to third-parties and they were banned from providing equipment with an integrated security access mechanism. This rule is usually referred to as the &quot;integration ban&quot;, and was unsuccessfully challenged in the courts and petitions to the FCC by the cable operators. The deadline was shifted forward twice until it went into effect on July 1, 2007. The ban on integrated security ended in December 2015.

==Technical overview==
&quot;CableCARD&quot; is a term trademarked by CableLabs for the Point of Deployment (POD) module defined by standards including SCTE 28, SCTE 41, CEA-679 and others. The physical CableCARD is inserted into a slot in the host (typically a digital television set or a set-top box) in order to identify and authorize the customer, and to provide proprietary decoding of the encrypted digital cable signal without the need for a proprietary set-top box. The cable tuner, QAM demodulator, and MPEG decoder are part of the host equipment. The card performs any conditional access and decryption functions, and provides a MPEG-2 transport stream to the host. The card also receives messages sent over the out-of-band signaling channel by the cable company&#x27;s headend servers and forwards them to the host.

CableCARDs may be used to access both standard definition and high definition channels as long as they are not part of a switched video system. (This applies to one-way devices only; two-way devices are capable of receiving and viewing switched video. The ability for one-way devices to receive and view switched video has changed with the addition of the Tuning Resolver Interface Specification. Tuning adaptors and tuning adaptor interfaces have been added to provide communication back to the headend needed for switched video.) CableCARDs are not necessary for viewing unscrambled digital cable channels if the user has a QAM tuner—a feature in some televisions and DVRs. CableCARD support is most common on higher end televisions that include a special slot for the CableCARD and a built-in cable tuner. The card acts like a unique &quot;key&quot; to unlock the channels and services to which the cable customer has subscribed, and the television&#x27;s remote-control will also control the cable channels. Televisions that support CableCARD should be labeled by the manufacturer as &quot;digital cable ready&quot; (DCR).

Interactive features such as video on demand rely on the CableCARD Host device being an OpenCable Host Device and have nothing to do with the physical card. This makes the common use of the phrase &quot;CableCARD 2.0&quot; as a requirement for video on demand misleading, since two way services have been provided with the actual cards from the very beginning.

===Physical CableCARDs===
The physical CableCARD inserted into the host device is a PC Card type II that handles decryption of video and ensures that only authorized subscribers may view it. This is also known as a &quot;conditional-access module&quot; function.

There are two kinds of physical CableCARDs:
* A &quot;single-stream&quot; CableCARD (S-CARD) can decode a single channel at a time. The S-CARD specification was initially specified in the Host-POD Interface (SCTE 28) and POD Copy Protection System (SCTE 41) standards (often referred to as CableCARD 1.0) set of specifications.
* A &quot;multi-Stream&quot; CableCARD (M-Card) can decode up to six channels simultaneously. Multi-stream cards were specified in a separate document in 2003.

No actual M-Cards were released before the introduction of CableCARD 2.0, which combined and enhanced the CableCARD 1.0 and Multi-Stream standards. M-Cards are backward compatible with current CableCARD devices. In older CableCARD devices that do not support multiple streams, the card appears to be a single stream card. CE companies have long wanted M-Cards for their CableCARD 1.0 host devices in order to compete with devices that use multiple tuners. This is important for products such as Moxi and TiVo CableCARD DVRs, televisions with picture-in-picture and CableCARD-equipped personal computers, which need to record one show while a user is watching another. To enable this without an M-Card, these products would be required to use multiple S-CARDs.

===CableCARDs with personal computers===
Existing integrated cable set-top boxes perform four basic functions:
* Enable receiving and selecting digital and analog cable channels
* Uniquely identify the customer and authorize the features to which they have subscribed
* Decode scrambled digital channels and premium programming such as movie channels
* Provide interactive two-way communications for electronic program guides, pay-per-view, video on demand, or switched video streams

New digital televisions and other devices that are labeled &quot;DCR&quot; (Digital cable ready) contain:
* Built-in support for receiving digital cable channels (via an internal QAM tuner)
* A slot for the current version of CableCARD, which allows decryption of encrypted digital channels

The CableCARD 2.0 specification includes support for #1-4, interactive two-way communications; however it is unknown exactly when CableCARD 2.0 hosts and compatible servers will become available. Future devices which support CableCARD 2.0 are expected to be labeled iDCR &quot;Interactive digital cable ready&quot;. Among other requirements, CableCARD 2.0 hosts will be required to provide the OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP), also known as Tru2way, to run programs downloaded from the cable company.

Because the conditional access system is in software, it can be sent with the video as a form of digital rights management. The CableCARD Host Licensing Agreement and the DCAS agreement restrict the technologies that CE companies may use for distributing video from host devices. CE companies object to this expanding the notion of CableCARD network security issues to also include content protection issues. They prefer to deal with content owners directly with their standards and regard cable company protocols and formats as a transport only. CE companies wish to communicate video inside the home network using their own protected protocols and formats.

The OpenCable Application Platform (OCAP) is a Java-based platform intended for use either with any security access scheme—whether it is CableCARD 2.0 devices or future downloadable security schemes. OCAP was tied to CableCARDs because, as it was imagined by CableLabs, the additional processing necessary for managing the communication with the cable company server would be performed, not on the cable company provided equipment (the CableCARD), but on the consumer electronics device—known as the CableCARD &quot;Host&quot;. CE companies objected that OCAP is unnecessary for the simple task of managing two-way communications on the cable networks. The CEA perspective is that Java is not efficient for CE devices, and that cable companies are passing to CE manufacturers the costs of a software platform which they didn&#x27;t need, and which won&#x27;t run on their existing hardware architectures.

The consumer electronics industry proposed in November 2006 that the CableCARD 2.0 specification be upgraded to include the provision for modified MCards that would support the communications necessary for VOD, PPV, and Switched Video. This card would be backward compatible with older cards, and support would be required for them on cable company servers by January 2008. These modified MCards would not allow two-way communication using current OCURs, which, by definition, are unidirectional. This so-called &quot;OCAP-less&quot; proposal was rejected by the NCTA for a variety of reasons elaborated on in the issues segment of this article. The technical advantage is that much less is assumed about the computing capability of the host, allowing the manufacturing cost to be significantly reduced. The disadvantage is that the MCard will be slightly more expensive, but the host will not necessarily be able to support the envisioned ecommerce and banking applications. CE companies argue that such a card fulfills the 1996 law&#x27;s requirement that cable companies allow two-way communication on their networks, and that OCAP fulfills technical goals far in excess of those necessary for such two-way communications.

==Existing standard and certification procedures==
Cable providers in the United States are required by the FCC to support the CableCARD 2.0 standard. The specification was developed by CableLabs, a research group run by a consortium of cable companies. Devices that use CableCARDs are known as &quot;Hosts&quot; and must be certified as compliant with the specification by CableLabs. The certification process can be lengthy and is performed in batches on a regular cycle every three months.

The first test tool to verify compliance of OpenCable hosts with the CableCARD one-way single stream specifications, HPNX, was released by SCM and Digital Keystone in 2003. Subsequently, the HPNX Pro version, supporting two-way and M-card specifications, was released by Digital Keystone in 2006. The &quot;M-UDCP Device Acceptance Test Plan&quot; published by CableLabs defines how to use the HPNX Pro test tool to validate the OpenCable host devices.

The first test tool to verify compliance of the CableCARD devices with the OpenCable specifications, Host Emulator Tool, and produced by Margi Systems, was first utilized by CableLabs to validate the Scientific Atlanta (Cisco) and Motorola POD devices in 2003 (POD was later renamed to CableCard).

Cable companies in the United States are required to provide CableCARDs conforming to this specification, and must correct incompatibilities between their networks and certified CableCARD devices.

The current CableCARD standard was borne out of an adversarial process between two main groups: cable companies represented by the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association (NCTA) and consumer electronics companies represented by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA). The portion of the CableCARD specs that could be agreed upon describe how one-way services work, so only the portion known as UDCP (Unidirectional Digital Cable Product) was required by the FCC. As it was the only thing required, most of the early devices were one-way capable; however all the actual CableCARDs produced were two-way capable. Many enhancements to the CableCARD standard including the optional Multi-Stream support became known as CableCARD 2.0.

Optical cable services (e.g. Verizon Fios) are classified as cable services and must, by FCC rules, also support the CableCARD standard. In Canada, cable providers Cogeco and Shaw offer CableCARD-enabled DVRs. Video providers in Europe must conform to the DVB standard which is a more comprehensive open standard governed by independent standards bodies.

CableCARDs can also support non-television functions and can act as a cable modem controller with the host providing modulation and demodulation functions and the card providing decoding and IP routing functionality; however this feature is rarely used and depends on the cable provider.

==Adoption==
There was much resistance from cable operators to the CableCARD rollout across the United States, preferring to support their own set-top boxes. The adoption proceeded slowly with 141,000 units by February 2006. The resistance softened somewhat with the July 2007 FCC ban on integrated security in set-top boxes, which required all new set-top boxes to use CableCARDs as their decryption mechanism. By June 2009, the top 10 &quot;incumbent&quot; U.S. cable operators had deployed more than 14 million operator-supplied set-tops with CableCARDs and 437,800 CableCARD modules for use in retail devices. The National Cable Television Association reported in April 2016 that only 621,400 CableCARDs were deployed for use in retail devices by the nine largest incumbent cable operators, compared to 55 million operator-supplied set-top boxes with CableCARDs.
This indicates that the CableCARD failed to achieve the goal of a competitive retail market for set-top boxes.

Outside the United States, CableCARDs were adopted only in South Korea, in pair with Nagravision and VideoGuard conditional access (CA) systems. U.S. adoptions of CableCARD were mostly paired with Cisco&#x27;s &quot;PowerKEY&quot; (originally developed by Scientific Atlanta) and Motorola&#x27;s (now Arris) &quot;MediaCipher&quot; CA systems.

== Successor initiatives ==
In 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a notice of inquiry for a successor system, called AllVid. Unlike CableCARD, AllVid intended to enable two-way services such as electronic program guides, pay-per-view, and video on demand.

There are still many in the cable industry who are advocating that physical CableCARDs be dropped entirely. These cable companies prefer to move away from physical cards, and have proposed that a downloadable security component known as Downloadable Conditional Access System (DCAS) be used instead of a physical CableCARD. In this proposal, a custom security chip must be soldered into every compliant host; if a security scheme is compromised, a new security program can be downloaded to the host device. The FCC has not yet approved it.

Consumer electronic companies advocate their proposal for more unfettered access to cable company networks, with CableLabs&#x27; role reduced to addressing only cable company interests of maintaining network stability and security.

In September 2020, the FCC eliminated CableCARD support and reporting requirements by cable operators, recognizing that cable industry deployment and use of CableCARDs have been “disappointing”, and noting that competition has provided other options for consumer flexibility via streaming media over the Internet.

Comcast ceased providing new and replacement CableCARDs on October 24, 2024.

<text>In monetary economics, the money multiplier is the ratio of the money supply to the monetary base (i.e. central bank money). If the money multiplier is stable, it implies that the central bank can control the money supply by determining the monetary base.

In some simplified expositions, the monetary multiplier is presented as simply the reciprocal of the reserve ratio, if any, required by the central bank. More generally, the multiplier will depend on the preferences of households, the legal regulation and the business policies of commercial banks - factors which the central bank can influence, but not control completely.

Because the money multiplier theory offers a potential explanation of the ways in which the central bank can control the total money supply, it is relevant when considering monetary policy strategies that target the money supply. Historically, some central banks have tried to conduct monetary policy by targeting the money supply and its growth rate, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. The results were not considered satisfactory, however, and starting in the early 1990s, most central banks abandoned trying to steer money growth in favour of targeting inflation directly, using changes in interest rates as the main instrument to influence economic activity. As controlling the size of the money supply has ceased being an important goal for central bank policy generally, the money multiplier parallelly has become less relevant as a tool to understand current monetary policy. It is still often used in introductory economic textbooks, however, as a simple shorthand description of the connections between central bank policies and the money supply.

== Definition ==
The money multiplier is normally presented in the context of some simple accounting identities: Usually, the money supply (&quot;M&quot;) is defined as consisting of two components: (physical) currency (&quot;C&quot;) and deposit accounts (&quot;D&quot;) held by the general public. By definition, therefore:
formula_1

Additionally, the monetary base (&quot;B&quot;) (also known as high-powered money) is normally defined as the sum of currency held by the general public (&quot;C&quot;) and the reserves of the banking sector (held either as currency in the vaults of the commercial banks or as deposits at the central bank) (&quot;R&quot;):

formula_2

Rearranging these two definitions result in a third identity:

formula_3

This relation describes the money supply in terms of the level of base money and two ratios: R/D is the ratio of commercial banks&#x27; reserves to deposit accounts, and C/D is the general public&#x27;s ratio of currency to deposits. As the relation is an identity, it holds true by definition, so that a change in the money supply can always be expressed in terms of these three variables alone. This may be advantageous because it is a simple way of summarising money supply changes, but the use of the identity does not in itself provide a behavioural theory of what determines the money supply. If, however, one additionally assumes that the two ratios C/D and R/D are exogenously determined constants, the equation implies that the central bank can control the money supply by controlling the monetary base via open-market operations: In this case, when the monetary base increases by, say, $1, the money supply will increase by 
$(1+C/D)/(R/D + C/D). This is the central contents of the money multiplier theory, and

formula_4

is the money multiplier, a multiplier being a factor that measures how much an endogenous variable (in this case, the money supply) changes in response to a change in some exogenous variable (in this case, the money base).

In some textbook applications, the relationship is simplified by assuming that cash does not exist so that the public holds money only in the form of bank deposits. In that case, the currency-deposit ratio C/D equals zero, and the money multiplier simplifies to

formula_5

Empirically, the money multiplier can be found as the ratio of some broad money aggregate like M2 over M0 (base money).

==Interpretation==

Generally, the currency-deposit ratio C/D reflects the preferences of households about the form of money they wish to hold (currency versus deposits). The reserve-deposit ratio R/D will be determined by the business policies of commercial banks and the laws regulating banks. Benjamin Friedman in his chapter on the money supply in &quot;The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics&quot; writes that both central bank reserves (supplied by the central bank and demanded by the commercial banks for several reasons) and deposits (supplied by commercial banks and demanded by households and non-financial firms) are traded in markets with equilibria of demand and supply which depend on the interest rate as well as a number of other factors. Consequently, the money multiplier representation should be interpreted as &quot;really just a shorthand simplification that works well or badly depending on the strength of the relevant interest elasticities and the extent of variation in interest rates and the many other factors involved.&quot;

===The importance of excess reserves===

In some presentations of the money multiplier theory, the further simplification is made that commercial banks only hold the reserves that are legally required by the monetary authorities so that the R/D ratio is determined directly by the central banks. In many countries the monetary authorities maintain reserve requirements that secure a minimum level of reserves at all times. However, commercial banks may often hold excess reserves, i.e. reserves held in excess of the legal reserve requirements. This is for instance the case in countries that do not impose legal reserve requirements at all like the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Scandinavian countries. The possibility of banks voluntarily choosing to hold excess reserves, in amounts that may change over time as the opportunity costs for banks change, are one reason why the monetary multiplier may not be stable. For instance, following the introduction of interest rates on excess reserves in the US, a large growth in excess reserves occurred in the Financial crisis of 2007–2010, US bank excess reserves growing over 500-fold, from under $2 billion in August 2008 to over $1,000 billion in November 2009.

The insight that banks may adjust their reserve/deposit ratio endogenously, making the money multiplier unstable, is old. Paul Samuelson noted in his bestselling textbook in 1948 that:
Restated, increases in central bank money may not result in commercial bank money because the money is not &quot;required&quot; to be lent out – it may instead result in a growth of unlent (i.e. excess) reserves. This situation has been referred to as &quot;pushing on a string&quot;: withdrawal of central bank money &quot;compels&quot; commercial banks to curtail lending (one can &quot;pull&quot; money via this mechanism), but input of central bank money does not compel commercial banks to lend (one cannot &quot;push&quot; via this mechanism).

The amount of its assets that a bank chooses to hold as excess reserves is a decreasing function of the amount by which the market rate for loans to the general public from commercial banks exceeds the interest rate on excess reserves and of the amount by which the market rate for loans to other banks (in the US, the federal funds rate) exceeds the interest rate on excess reserves. Since the money multiplier in turn depends negatively on the desired reserve/deposit ratio, the money multiplier depends positively on these two opportunity costs. Moreover, the public’s choice of the currency/deposit ratio depends negatively on market rates of return on highly liquid substitutes for currency; since the currency ratio negatively affects the money multiplier, the money multiplier is positively affected by the return on these substitutes. Note that when making predictions assuming a constant multiplier, the predictions are valid only if these ratios do not in fact change. Sometimes this holds, and sometimes it does not; for example, increases in central bank money (i.e. base money) may result in increases in commercial bank money – and will, if these ratios (and thus multiplier) stay constant – or may result in increases in excess reserves but little or no change in commercial bank money, in which case the reserve–deposit ratio will grow and the multiplier will fall.

=== &quot;Loans first&quot; model ===
An alternative interpretation of the direction of causality in the identity described above is that the connection between the money supply and the monetary base goes from the former to the latter: Interest-rate-targeting central banks supply whatever amount of reserves that the banking system demands, given the reserve requirements and the amount of deposits that have been created.

In this alternative model of money creation, loans are first extended by commercial banks – say, $1,000 of loans, which may then require that the bank borrow $100 of reserves either from depositors or other private sources of financing, or from the central bank. This view is advanced in endogenous money theories. It is also occasionally referred to as a &quot;Loans first&quot; model as opposed to the traditional multiplier theory, which can be labelled a &quot;Reserves first&quot; model.

== Monetary policy in practice ==

Whereas used in many textbooks, the realism of the money multiplier theory is questioned by several economists, and it is generally rejected as a useful description of actual central bank behaviour today, partly because major central banks generally have not tried to control the monetary supply during the last decades, hence making the theory irrelevant, partly because it is doubtful as to how large an extent the central banks would be able to control the money supply, should they wish to. The last question is a matter of the stability of the money multiplier.

===Historical attempts to steer the money supply===

Historically, central banks have in some periods used strategies of trying to target a certain level or growth rate of money supply, in particular during the late 1970s and 1980s, inspired by monetarist theory and the quantity theory of money. However, these strategies turned out to not work very well and were abandoned again. In the United States, short-term interest rates became fourfould more volatile during the years 1979-1982 when the Federal Reserve adopted a moderate version of monetary base control, and the targeted monetary aggregate at the time, M1, even increased its short-term volatility.

===Current monetary policy===
Starting in the early 1990s, a fundamental rethinking of monetary policy took place in major central banks, shifting to targeting inflation rather than monetary growth and generally using interest rates to implement goals rather than quantitative measures like holding the quantity of base money at fixed levels. As a result, modern central banks hardly ever conduct their policies by trying to control the money supply, implying also that the monetary multiplier theory has become more irrelevant as a tool to understand current monetary policy.

Charles Goodhart notes in his chapter on the monetary base in &quot;The New Palgrave&quot; that the banking system has virtually never worked in the way hypothesized by the monetary multiplier theory. Instead, central banks have used their powers to effect a desired level of interest rates rather than achieve a pre-determined quantity of monetary base or of some monetary aggregate. He also mentions that the institutional development of the financial markets, notably interbank lending markets, implies that the monetary base multiplier no longer would, or could, work in the textbook fashion. Instead, he argues that the behavioural process leading to a change in monetary bases runs from an initial change in interest rates to a subsequent readjustment in monetary aggregate quantities, endogenously determining these as well as the accommodating monetary base. Also David Romer notes in his graduate textbook &quot;Advanced Macroeconomics&quot; that it is difficult for central banks to control broad monetary aggregates like M2, causing central banks generally to assign the behaviour of the money supply an unimportant role in policy, focusing instead on adjusting nominal interest rates to stabilize the economy. Gregory Mankiw, author of one of the widely read intermediate textbooks (&quot;Macroeconomics&quot;) that present the money multiplier theory, notes in its 11th edition that even though the Federal Reserve can influence the money supply, it cannot control it fully because households&#x27; decisions and banks&#x27; discretion in the conduct of their business may change the money supply in ways unanticipated by the central bank.

After the financial crisis, several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Deutsche Bundesbank, the Hungarian National Bank and Danmarks Nationalbank have issued explanations of money creation supporting the view that central banks generally do not control the creation of money, nor do they try to, though their interest rate-setting monetary policies naturally affect the amount of loans and deposits that commercial banks create. The Federal Reserve in 2021 launched several educational resources to facilitate teaching the conduct of current monetary policy, recommending teachers to avoid relying on the money multiplier concept, which was described as obsolete and unusable.

Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof of the IMF Research Department, argue that: the &quot;deposit multiplier&quot; of the undergraduate economics textbook, where monetary aggregates are created at the initiative of the central bank, through an initial injection of high-powered money into the banking system that gets multiplied through bank lending, turns the actual operation of the monetary transmission mechanism on its head. At all times, when banks ask for reserves, the central bank obliges. According to this model, reserves therefore impose no constraint and the deposit multiplier is therefore a myth. The authors therefore argue that private banks are almost fully in control of the money creation process.

Besides the mainstream questioning of the usefulness of the money multiplier theory, the rejection of this theory has also been a theme in the heterodox post-Keynesian school of economic thought.

==Example==

As explained above, according to the monetary multiplier theory money creation in a fractional-reserve banking system occurs when a given reserve is lent out by a bank, then deposited at a bank (possibly different), which is then lent out again, the process repeating and the ultimate result being a geometric series.

The following formula for the money multiplier may be used, explicitly accounting for the fact that the public has a desire to hold some currency in the form of cash and that commercial banks may desire to hold reserves in excess of the legal reserve requirements:

:formula_6
Here the Desired Reserve Ratio is the sum of the required reserve ratio and the excess reserve ratio.

The formula above is derived from the following procedure. Let the monetary base be normalized to unity. Define the legal reserve ratio, formula_7, the excess reserves ratio, formula_8, the currency/deposit ratio with respect to deposits, formula_9; suppose the demand for funds is unlimited; then the theoretical superior limit for deposits is defined by the following series:
formula_10.

Analogously, the theoretical superior limit for the money held by public is defined by the following series:
formula_11

and the theoretical superior limit for the total loans lent in the market is defined by the following series:
formula_12

By summing up the two quantities, the theoretical money multiplier is defined as
formula_13

where and formula_14

The process described above by the geometric series can be represented in the following table, where

*loans at stage formula_15 are a function of the deposits at the preceding stage: formula_16
*publicly held money at stage formula_15 is a function of the deposits at the preceding stage: formula_18
*deposits at stage formula_15 are the difference between additional loans and publicly held money relative to the same stage: formula_20

=== Table ===
This re-lending process (assuming that no currency is used) can be depicted as follows, assuming a 20% reserve ratio and a $100 initial deposit:
Note that no matter how many times the smaller and smaller amounts of money are re-lended, the legal reserve requirement is never exceeded - because that would be illegal.

<doc id="1290323" wikidata="Q326262" url="?curid=1290323" title="Dun gene">
<text>The dun gene is a dilution gene that affects both red and black pigments in the coat color of a horse. The dun gene lightens most of the body while leaving the mane, tail, legs, and primitive markings the shade of the undiluted base coat color. A dun horse always has a dark dorsal stripe down the middle of its back, usually has a darker face and legs, and may have transverse striping across the shoulders or horizontal striping on the back of the forelegs. Body color depends on the underlying coat color genetics. A classic &quot;bay dun&quot; is a gray-gold or tan, characterized by a body color ranging from sandy yellow to reddish brown. Duns with a chestnut base may appear a light tan shade, and those with black base coloration are a smoky gray. Manes, tails, primitive markings, and other dark areas are usually the shade of the undiluted base coat color. The dun gene may interact with all other coat color alleles.

==Taxonomic distribution==
Dun is believed to be the ancestral or wild type color of horses. Many equines appearing in prehistoric cave paintings such as in Chauvet Cave are dun, and several closely related species in the genus &quot;Equus&quot; show dun characteristics. These include the Przewalski&#x27;s horse, onager, kiang, African wild ass, an extinct subspecies of plains zebra, the quagga, and an extinct subspecies of horse, the tarpan. Zebras can also be considered a variant of dun where the dilution is so extreme it turns the hair nearly white, and the primitive markings (like the striped leg barring) extend across the entire body.

Neither the &quot;non-dun1&quot; nor the &quot;non-dun2&quot; mutations were found in any other equids.

==Color traits==


The dun gene has a dilution effect, lightening the body coat, but has less of an effect on the primitive markings and on the point coloration of the mane, tail, ears, and legs. 

Dun visibly affects all the three base colors, bay (bay, classic, or zebra dun), black (mouse dun or grullo), and Chestnut (red dun). It is more difficult to recognize when combined with other dilution genes or if affected by gray. Shades include:

*Dun, also called bay dun, classic dun, or zebra dun is the most common type of dun, and has a tan or gold body with black mane, tail, and primitive markings. Genetically, the horse has an underlying bay coat color, acted upon by the dun gene. 
*Red dun, also called claybank, is a light tan coat with reddish instead of black points and primitive markings. Genetically, the horse has an underlying chestnut coat color, acted upon by the dun gene. Thus, as there is no black on the horse to be affected, the undiluted underlying color is red. 
*Grullo or grulla, also called blue dun or mouse dun, is a smoky, blue-gray to mouse-brown color and can vary from light to dark. They consistently have black points and they often have a dark or black head. The primitive markings are usually all black. Genetically, the horse has an underlying black coat color, acted upon by the dun gene.

Another characteristic of the dun gene are primitive markings. Dun traits include the following:

* Dorsal stripe down the center of the back, along the spine, seen almost universally on duns 
* Horizontal striping on the back of forelegs, common on most duns, although at times, rather faint 
* Facial mask, a darker area around the nasal bone and forehead, sometimes making the head close to the undiluted color, some patterns colloquially called &quot;Cobwebbing.&quot;
* Transverse stripe, a crosswise stripe along the shoulders perpendicular to the dorsal stripe, very common in donkeys, less common in horses, and if present, often faint, usually only visible on a short summer coat, if at all.
* Frosting: light hairs found on either side of the mane and on both sides of the dock of the tail. 

Other variations result from the interplay of additional genes:

* Chestnut + dun + cream gene (single copy) = &quot;dunalino&quot; or &quot;palomino dun&quot;
* Bay + dun + cream gene (single copy) = &quot;dunskin&quot; or &quot;buckskin dun&quot;

A single copy of the cream gene on a black base coat does not significantly lighten black hair, though it may have a subtle effect, and thus a single copy generally has no visible effect on a grullo, either. Conversely, double copies of the cream gene create very light-colored horses (cremello, perlino, and smoky cream). Thus, if a horse with two cream dilution alleles also carries the dun gene, it also will be cream-colored, with primitive markings not visible to any significant degree.

Dorsal striping alone does not guarantee the horse carries the dun gene. There two types of non-dun, called &quot;non-dun1&quot; and &quot;non-dun2&quot;. Non-dun1 horses have no dun color dilution but may keep primitive markings, while non-dun2 horses have neither the dun color dilution nor primitive markings.

The Fjord horse breed, which is predominantly dun, uses unique Norwegian-based terminology to distinguish between the different shades of dun horses. &quot;Brown dun&quot;, or &quot;brunnblakk&quot; is a zebra dun, &quot;rødblakk&quot; is a red dun, &quot;grå&quot; - literally &quot;gray&quot; - is a grullo, buckskin duns are called &quot;ulsblakk&quot; or white dun, and a &quot;dunalino&quot; (dun + palomino) is called a &quot;yellow dun&quot; or &quot;gulblakk.&quot; A cremello, perlino or smoky cream is called &quot;white&quot; or &quot;kvit.&quot;

==Dun mimics==
Historically, before modern genetic studies distinguished between alleles, diluted colors were sometimes lumped together and simply called &quot;dun&quot;.

The dun gene, when on a &quot;bay dun&quot; horse, can closely resemble buckskin, in that both colors feature a light-colored coat with a dark mane and tail. In particular, buckskins with non-dun 1 primitive markings can easily be confused with dun. Genetically, a bay dun is a bay horse with the dun gene. A buckskin is bay horse with the addition of the cream gene, causing the coat color to be diluted from red to gold, usually without primitive markings. Visually, a bay dun is a tan-gold color, somewhat darker and less vivid than the more cream or gold buckskin, and duns always possess primitive markings. Today, pedigree analysis, DNA testing, studying possible offspring, and the vividness of primitive markings are used to determine whether a horse is a dun.

A red dun may also be confused with a perlino, which is genetically a bay horse with two copies of the cream gene, which creates a horse with a cream-colored body but a reddish mane and tail. However, perlinos usually are significantly lighter than red dun and have blue eyes.

Grullos are sometimes confused with roans or grays. However, unlike blue roan, dun has no intermingled black and white hairs, and unlike a true gray, which also intermingles light and dark hairs, the color does not change to a lighter shade as the horse ages. With a dun, the hair color is one solid shade and remains so for life.

To further confuse matters, it is possible for a horse to carry both dun and cream dilution genes; such horses with golden buckskin coloring and a complete set of primitive markings are referred to as a &quot;buckskin dun&quot; or a &quot;dunskin&quot;. On such horses, the light-shaded primitive markings are most noticeable during the summer months, when the winter hair sheds. A palomino that also carries dun, showing primitive dorsal striping or leg bars indicative of a red dun may be called a &quot;dunalino.&quot;

Countershading such as light dorsal stripes resulting from the presence of the gene nd1 (see section below) may be difficult to detect on light-colored horses.

==Genetics==
There are three known alleles of the dun gene: &quot;dun&quot; (&quot;D&quot;), produces dilution and primitive markings. &quot;Non-dun1&quot; (&quot;d1&quot;) horses do not have dun dilution but may exhibit some primitive markings. &quot;Non-dun2&quot; (&quot;d2&quot;) horses have neither dilution nor primitive markings. Dun is a dominant gene; however, at least one study found a statistically significant variation in the shade of dilution depending on whether one or two copies of the dun gene are present. Two non-dun parents cannot produce a dun foal. Horses that are non-dun1 &quot;d1/d1&quot; or &quot;d1/d2&quot; may have some asymmetry in pigment distribution, producing primitive markings, but to a lesser degree than dun horses. Homozygous &quot;non-dun1/non-dun1&quot; horses typically have clearer primitive markings than heterozygous &quot;d1/d2&quot; horses. The primitive markings from non-dun1 are more visible on a bay or chestnut horse; they blend in on a black. A horse with two copies of &quot;non-dun2&quot; lacks primitive markings. 

Dun has a stronger effect than other dilution genes in that it acts on any coat color. In contrast, the silver dapple gene acts only on black-based coats, and the cream gene is an incomplete dominant which must be homozygous to be fully expressed, and when heterozygous is only visible on bay and chestnut coats, and then to a lesser degree.

The dun dilution effect is caused by pigment only being placed in a part of each hair. Specifically, hairs from diluted areas only have pigment along one side of them, while hairs from darker parts such as the dorsal stripe have pigment all the way around. 

Genetic analysis and DNA sequencing results published in 2015 link dun color to the T-box 3 (TBX3) transcription factor. When functional, it creates dun coloring, including the primitive markings, and when recessive, a horse is not dun. In humans and lab mice, TBX3 is critical to development. Abnormalities are linked to a collection of developmental defects called ulnar–mammary syndrome, and the null allele (being unable to produce any TBX3 at all) is thought to be embryonic lethal. In non-dun horses, the TBX3 protein is still functional, and is still produced in most cells, but not expressed in the hair cortex. Where the coat is diluted, the color is not uniform throughout each hair, but rather is more intense on the outward-facing side of the hair shaft and lighter underneath. In the darker areas, where the primitive markings occur, the hair shaft is of uniform color. One of the researchers involved in the study said it could be called a &quot;microscopic spotting pattern&quot;. This phenomenon is new to science and has not been observed in rodents, primates, or carnivores.

The location of TBX3 expression may also determine the striping pattern of zebras.

===Non-dun alleles===
There are two forms of non-dun color, non-dun1 and non-dun2, caused by different mutations. Non-dun1 horses have some primitive markings, while non-dun2 horses do not. 

Prior to domestication of the horse, dun, non-dun1, and the leopard complex are thought to have been the wild type modifiers of the base colors bay and black for wild horses. It is thought that the non-dun2 genetic mutation (as well as the development of chestnut base color) occurred after domestication. Ancient DNA from a horse that lived about 43,000 years ago, long before horses were domesticated, carried both dun and non-dun1 genes.

The non-dun mutations appear to &quot;disrupt the function of a transcriptional enhancer regulating TBX3 expression in a specific subset of hair bulb keratinocytes during hair growth.&quot; The region deleted in &quot;non-dun2&quot; is predicted to include binding sites for the transcription factors ALX4 and MSX2, which are both known to be involved in hair follicle development. &quot;TBX3&quot; was significantly downregulated in non-dun horses compared to dun horses, while the neighboring gene, &quot;TBX5&quot;, was expressed in about the same amount. In dun horses, the pattern of &quot;TBX3&quot; expression mirrored the pattern of pigment deposition in the hair, that is, TBX3 was found wherever the pigment was not. TBX3 was not found in the hair cortex keratinocytes from non-dun horses nor in those from the dorsal stripe of dun horses. However, all of the horses had a thin outer layer of the hair where &quot;TBX3&quot; was expressed. Two markers of mature melanocytes, KIT and MITF, were found only in the pigmented areas of the hair. This indicates that the hair follicles of dun and non-dun horses have different distributions of pigment-producing cells. &quot;KITLG&quot; encodes KIT ligand, a molecule required for melanocyte migration and survival in the skin and hair follicle. Keratinocytes expressing &quot;KITLG&quot; were found all the way around the hair in non-dun horses, but only on the pigmented side in dun horses. The region where &quot;KITLG&quot; was not expressed was similar to, but not exactly the same as, the region where &quot;TBX3&quot; was expressed. TBX3 is not thought to directly affect &quot;KITLG&quot; expression.

Both &quot;non-dun1&quot; and &quot;non-dun2&quot; are found in a region of equine chromosome 8 whose only gene is &quot;TBX3&quot;. &quot;Non-dun1&quot; has a guanine where &quot;dun&quot; has an adenine at chromosome 8 base pair 18,226,905, which appears to be sufficient to cause non-dun1 coloration. In addition, &quot;non-dun1&quot; has another single nucleotide polymorphism compared to the version of &quot;dun&quot; that is most common in domestic horses, where a guanine in &quot;dun&quot; is replaced with thymine in &quot;non-dun1&quot; at chr. 8: 18,227,267. However, that SNP was also found in some dun Estonian native horses, so is not necessary for dun. &quot;Non-dun2&quot; has a 1,609 bp deletion and another very near 8 bp deletion. Comparison with &quot;TBX3&quot; in other species showed that the &quot;non-dun2&quot; deletion is a more derived allele. Nucleotide diversity across the flanking regions of chromosome 8 for the various alleles indicates that the &quot;non-dun2&quot; mutation most likely occurred on a chromosome that already had &quot;non-dun1&quot;.

<text>Nichollet is a small, isolated lunar impact crater on the Mare Nubium, a lunar mare in the southwest quadrant of the Moon. It was named after French astronomer Joseph Nicollet. This crater is located to the north of the crater Pitatus, about midway between Wolf to the west and Birt to the east.

This is a circular, bowl-shaped crater with a rim raised above the surface of the surrounding lava plain. The inner walls slope down to the interior floor, with the bottom having a diameter about half that of the crater. Some wrinkle ridges lie in the surface of the nearby mare, joining with the outer rim. These features are best observed under oblique lighting conditions when the terminator has just moved past the crater during the waxing phase.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Nicollet.

<doc id="1290331" wikidata="Q892658" url="?curid=1290331" title="Bonjour Tristesse">
<text>Bonjour Tristesse () is a novel by Françoise Sagan. Published in 1954, when the author was only 18, it was an overnight sensation. The title is derived from a poem by Paul Éluard, &quot;À peine défigurée&quot;, which begins with the lines &quot;Adieu tristesse/Bonjour tristesse...&quot; An English-language film adaptation was released in 1958, directed by Otto Preminger.

==Plot summary==
17-year-old Cécile spends her summer in a villa on the French Riviera with her father Raymond and his current mistress, the young, superficial, fashionable Elsa, who gets on well with Cécile. Raymond is an attractive, worldly, amoral man who excuses his serial philandering by quoting Oscar Wilde: &quot;Sin is the only note of vivid colour that persists in the modern world.&quot; Cécile says, &quot;I believed that I could base my life on it&quot;, and accepts their languorous lifestyle as the ideal of privileged status. One of its advantages for Cécile is that her father, who has no intellectual interests, does not care if she studies or not. Another is that he gives her leeway to pursue her own interests, with the assumption that she will be an amusing addition to the superficial social gatherings he favors. In the next villa to theirs is a young man in his 20s, Cyril, with whom Cécile has her first sexual romance.

Their peaceful holiday is shattered by the arrival of Anne, whom Raymond had vaguely invited. A cultured, principled, intelligent, hard-working woman of Raymond&#x27;s age who was a friend of his late wife, Anne regards herself as a sort of godmother to Cécile. The three women all have claims on Raymond&#x27;s attention; the remote, enigmatic Anne soon becomes Raymond&#x27;s lover, and the next morning she announces their engagement. Elsa moves out, then Anne tries to take over parenting Cécile. She tells Cécile to stop seeing Cyril and get back to her schoolbooks. Cécile is horrified at this threat to her pampered life as her father&#x27;s darling, especially as Anne becomes the entire focus of Raymond&#x27;s interest. She devises a plan to prevent the marriage, while nevertheless feeling ambiguous about her scheming.

To make Raymond jealous, Cécile arranges for Elsa and Cyril to pretend to be a couple and appear together at specific moments. When Raymond predictably becomes jealous of the younger Cyril, he renews his pursuit of Elsa. But Cécile has misjudged Anne&#x27;s sensitivity. After she sees Raymond and Elsa together in the woods, with Raymond brushing pine needles off of his suit, Anne drives off in tears and her car plunges from a cliff in an apparent suicide.

Cécile and her father return to the empty, desultory life they were living before Anne interrupted their summer and consider the impact Anne has had on their lives. Cécile lives with the knowledge that her manipulations led to Anne&#x27;s death and longs for the summer they shared.

==Characters==
* Cécile, a wealthy and careless seventeen-year-old girl
* Raymond, her middle-aged father, a notorious partier and ladies&#x27; man
* Elsa, Raymond&#x27;s latest mistress at the beginning of the novel
*Anne, an old friend of Cécile&#x27;s mother, who mentored Cécile after she withdrew from Catholic boarding school
* Cyril, a young man who lives near the house Raymond rents for the summer

==Reception==
An early brief review of Irene Ash&#x27;s English translation (John Murray, 1955), in &quot;The Times&quot; of 19 May 1955, describes it as &quot;An unusual little fiction ... written by a 19-year-old girl from the Dordogne ... a nice piece of precocity&quot;. The reviewer in &quot;The Spectator&quot; of the same date said &quot;&quot;Bonjour, Tristesse&quot;, which has achieved remarkable celebrity by virtue of its subject-matter and its authoress&#x27;s age, is a vulgar, sad little book&quot;.

== Translation into English ==
&quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; was translated into English by Irene Ash in 1955. Ash&#x27;s translation censors much of the amoral and sexual themes of the original text, removing over 100 lines of Sagan&#x27;s original writing to make it more palatable for British publication. A later 2013 translation by Heather Lloyd includes the full uncensored text.

== Cultural adaptations ==

* German-American filmmaker Otto Preminger produced and directed a film adaptation of the book through his film production company Wheel Productions. &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; was released in 1958 and stars Jean Seberg, Deborah Kerr and David Niven.
* Canadian dark ambient band Soufferance based and themed their 2011 concept extended play on the book. Titled &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot;, the EP features a single 17-minute song. A follow-up concept album was released a year later, titled &quot;Adieu Tristesse&quot;, which also took elements from the novel.
* French artist Frédéric Rébéna had adapted &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; into a graphic novel, with NBM Publishing scheduled to release an English version in 2025.

<text>Haines is a surname. 

==Etymology==

According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland&quot;, the modern names &quot;Haine&quot;, &quot;Hayne&quot;, &quot;Haines&quot;, &quot;Hains&quot;, &quot;Hanes&quot;, and &quot;Haynes&quot; all originate in four different medieval names, which came to sound the same.

# The Middle English name &quot;Hain&quot;. This is thought to have originated as a pet form of Anglo-Norman names such as &quot;Reynald&quot;, &quot;Reyner&quot; and &quot;Rainbert&quot;.
# The personal name Hagan, which is itself of diverse origins.
# The Old English word &quot;haga&quot; (&#x27;enclosure&#x27;, Middle English &quot;hay&quot;), in the oblique case form &quot;hagan&quot; (Middle English &quot;hayne&quot;), whose use could have arisen from a locative epithet such as &quot;æt hagan&quot; (&#x27;at the enclosure&#x27;).
# Perhaps the Middle English word &quot;heyne&quot; (and its variants, such as &quot;haine&quot;, &quot;hayn&quot;), meaning &#x27;mean wretch, niggard&#x27;.

The forms ending in &quot;-s&quot; show the addition of the genitive case ending, implying that the name-bearer was the child of a father called &quot;Hain&quot;, or addition of &quot;-s&quot; on the analogy of such names.

Additional etymologies for &quot;Haines&quot; and &quot;Haynes&quot; names not shared by the &quot;Hayne&quot; types are:
# the place-name of Haynes, Bedfordshire, indicating people from that village (whose name itself derived from Old English *&quot;hægen&quot; (&#x27;enclosures&#x27;).
# the Irish name &quot;Hynes&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland&quot; also considers the suggestion of origins in the Welsh name &quot;Einws&quot; (a pet form of &quot;Einion&quot;), but does not find evidence to support this.

==Distribution==
Around 2011, there were 9551 bearers of the surname &quot;Haines&quot; in Great Britain and 79 in Ireland. In 1881, there were 6890 bearers of the name in Great Britain, concentrated in the south of England, particularly in London, Gloucestershire, Berkshire, Wiltshire, and Warwickshire, while around the mid-nineteenth century bearers of the name in Ireland were concentrated in Cork.

&quot;Haines&quot; is the 410th most common surname in Great Britain with 23,109 bearers. It is most common in Gwynedd where it is the 6th most common surname with 4,931 bearers. Other concentrations include Merseyside, (198th, 1,727), Cheshire, (213th, 1,739), West Yorkshire, (245th, 1,751), Surrey, (281st, 1,815) and Essex (404th, 1,715).

<text>Karakalpak () is a Turkic language spoken by Karakalpaks in Karakalpakstan. It is divided into two dialects, Northeastern Karakalpak and Southwestern Karakalpak. It developed alongside Nogai and neighbouring Kazakh languages, being markedly influenced by both. Typologically, Karakalpak belongs to the Kipchak branch of the Turkic languages, thus being closely related to and highly mutually intelligible with Kazakh and Nogai.

==Classification==
Karakalpak is a member of the Kipchak branch of Turkic languages, which includes Kazakh, Bashkir, Tatar, Kumyk, Karachay, Nogai and Kyrgyz. Due to its proximity to Turkmen and Uzbek, some of Karakalpak&#x27;s vocabulary and grammar has been influenced by Uzbek and Turkmen. Like the vast majority of Turkic languages, Karakalpak has vowel harmony, is agglutinative and has no grammatical gender. Word order is usually subject–object–verb.

==Geographic distribution==
Karakalpak is spoken mainly in the Karakalpakstan Autonomous Republic of Uzbekistan. Approximately 2,000 people in Afghanistan and smaller diaspora in parts of Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey and other parts of the world speak Karakalpak.

===Official status===
Karakalpak has official status in the Karakalpakstan Autonomous Republic.

===Dialects===
&quot;Ethnologue&quot; identifies two dialects of Karakalpak: Northeastern and Southwestern. Menges mentions a third possible dialect spoken in the Fergana Valley. The Southwestern dialect has /tʃ/ for the Northeastern /ʃ/.

==Phonology==
Karakalpak has 25 native consonant phonemes and regularly uses four non-native phonemes in loan words. Non-native sounds are shown in parentheses.
=== Consonants ===
===Vowels===

====Vowel harmony====

Vowel harmony functions in Karakalpak much as it does in other Turkic languages. Words borrowed from Russian or other languages may not observe rules of vowel harmony, but the following rules usually apply:

==Vocabulary==

===Personal pronouns===
===Numbers===
# &quot;бир – bir&quot; – 1
# &quot;еки – eki –&quot; 2
# &quot;үш – úsh –&quot; 3
# &quot;төрт – tórt&quot; – 4
# &quot;бес – bes&quot; – 5
# &quot;алты – altı&quot; – 6
# &quot;жети – jeti –&quot; 7
# &quot;сегиз – segiz –&quot; 8
# &quot;тоғыз – toǵız&quot; – 9
# &quot;он – on –&quot; 10
* &quot;жүз – júz&quot; – 100
* &quot;мың – mıń&quot; – 1000
*&quot;миллион – million – 1000000&quot;

==Writing system==
Karakalpak was written in the Arabic and Persian script until 1932, in the Latin script from 1928 to 1940, after which Cyrillic was introduced. Following Uzbekistan&#x27;s independence in 1991, the decision was made to drop Cyrillic and revert to the Latin alphabet. Whilst the use of Latin script is now widespread in Tashkent, its introduction into Karakalpakstan remains gradual.

The Arabic alphabet consisted of the following 28 letters:

Arabic alphabet on its own has a number of significant shortcomings: it lacks letters to indicate a number of specific Karakalpak sounds. However, in line with developments in other Turkic-speaking communities of the Soviet union, specifically the development of Yaña imlâ alphabet in Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, and processes of standardization of Arabic script in Kazakh SSR and Uzbek SSR, Karakalpak Arabic orthography also underwent modifications and introduction of letters and conventions to represent the language more consistently.

A small uppercase &quot;Hamza&quot; is used for indicating front vowels when vowel sounds can&#x27;t be perceived from other vowels or consonants in a word, very similar to the use of Hamza in Kazakh Arabic alphabet.

In November 1924, the first Karakalpak newspaper “Free Karakalpak” (یىُركین قاراقالپاق) began to be printed on with the script, and in 1925 the first textbooks were published. Writer and educator Saifulgabit Madzhitov played a major role in the creation of the alphabet and the release of the first primers.

In the 1920s, a campaign was launched in the USSR to Latinize the writing systems of various peoples of the country. This campaign gained particular scope after the First Turkic Congress, held in 1926 in Baku, at which all Turkic peoples of the USSR were recommended to switch to a new alphabet (Çaŋəlip|Yañalif). In July 1927, by decision of the Kara-Kalpak regional committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks, the regional Committee of the New Alphabet was created, which began developing the Karakalpak Latinized alphabet. On July 30, 1928, a new alphabet, developed under the leadership of K. Avezov and S. Madzhitov, was submitted for consideration to the Government of the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Okrug.

At the end of 1928, after taking into account a number of comments put forward by specialists and intellectuals, this alphabet was approved. It had 32 letters: a, в, с, ç, d, e, ә, f, g, h, x, i, ь, j, k, l, m, n, ŋ, o, ө, p, q, ƣ, r, s, t, u, v, y, z, ş. There were no capital letters in this alphabet. At the beginning of 1929, newspapers and books began to be published in this alphabet. By 1930, printing and education in Karakalpakstan had completely switched from the Arabic alphabet to the Latinized one.

In 1930, on the initiative of the Karakalpak intelligentsia, a meeting was held at the editorial office of the newspaper “Mijnetkeş Qaraqalpaq” on issues of the alphabet and spelling. As a result, it was decided to exclude the letter c from the alphabet and write ş instead. By that time, the question arose about establishing firm rules for Karakalpak spelling. In 1932, the Ethno-linguistic section of the Karakalpak comprehensive research institute and the educational and methodological council of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education presented two projects for the Karakalpak orthography and alphabet. During the discussion, both projects were combined into one and in September 1932, at the First Karakalpak Spelling Conference, it was approved. The main change was the introduction of capital letters, as well as a change in the order of letters in the alphabet. Now it was arranged thusly: Aa, Bв, Vv, Gg, Dd, Ee, Çç, Zz, Ii, Jj, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, Oo, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Uu, Ff, Xx, Şş, Hh, Әә, Qq, Ƣƣ, Ŋŋ, Өө, Yy, Ьь.

In June 1935, the Second Linguistic Conference was held in Turtkul. In addition to spelling issues, it also touched upon the issue of alphabet reform. It was proposed to exclude the letters Әә, Өө and Yy from it. However, during the discussion, this proposal was rejected, and the need for further elaboration of this issue was noted.

The third spelling conference was held in Turtkul in October 1938. The issue of alphabet reform was raised again. As a result, the letter Ŭŭ was introduced into the alphabet, the phonetic meaning of a number of letters was changed, and the order of their arrangement in the alphabet was slightly adjusted. As a result, the alphabet approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic looked like this: Aa, Bв, Vv, Gg, Dd, Ee, Çç, Zz, Ii, Kk, Ll, Mm, Nn, Oo ,Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Uu, Ff, Xx, Şş, Ŋŋ, Әә, Өө, Hh, Qq, Ƣƣ, Yy, Ŭŭ, Jj, Ьь.

At the end of the 1930s, the process of transferring scripts to a Cyrillic basis began in the Soviet Union. In 1940, K. Ubaydullaev, K. Aimbetov and N. Davkaraev developed an alphabet and spelling rules for the Karakalpak language based on the Cyrillic alphabet. This alphabet was introduced by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic on July 18, 1940. This decree also established a deadline of January 1, 1942 for the transition of the press, education and institutions to the new alphabet.

The new alphabet had 35 letters: а, Бб, Вв, Гг, Дд, Ее, Жж, Зз, Ии, Йй, Кк, Лл, Мм, Нн, Оо, Пп, Рр, Сс, Тт, Уу, Фф, Хх, Цц, Чч, Шш, Щщ, Ъъ, Ыы, Ьь, Ээ, Юю, Яя, Ғғ, Ққ, Ҳҳ. This alphabet had a number of significant shortcomings: it lacked signs to indicate the sounds /æ/, /œ/, /y/, /ŋ/ and /w/. To convey the sounds /æ/, /œ/, /y/, the letters а, о, у were used with the addition of a soft sign after the consonant letter located behind them (for example, тань (bread) instead of тәnн, созь (word) instead of сөз, жунь (wool) instead of жүн, etc.). To denote the sound /ŋ/, the нг digraph was used.

These shortcomings forced the Karakalpak Institute of Economics and Culture to develop a new alphabet and spelling rules for the Karakalpak language. In September 1954, a scientific and theoretical conference was held in Nukus, at which scientists from Karakalpakstan, Moscow, Tashkent and Frunze discussed the project of a new alphabet. The decisions of the conference were finalized taking into account the recommendations of the Institute of Language and Literature of the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek SSR and the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. As a result, the current alphabet was clarified and a new set of spelling rules was compiled. On February 28, 1957, the new alphabet and spelling were approved by decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This alphabet came into effect in 1960. Compared to the previous version, the letters Ә ә, Ё ё, Ң ң, Ө ө, Ү ү, Ў ў were introduced into the alphabet, and the order of the letters in the alphabet was also changed. As a result, the Karakalpak alphabet began to look like this:

In 1963-1964, the issue of improving the Karakalpak alphabet was again raised in the pages of the local press. On this basis, in 1964, a special commission was created from employees of the Institute of History, Language and Literature of the Karakalpak branch of the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, as well as teachers from the department of the Karakalpak language of the Karakalpak Pedagogical Institute and employees of the Institute for Advanced Training of Teachers of the Karakalpak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. This commission developed a new draft alphabet and spelling. The project proposed the abolition of the letters ў and ң. However, this project caused serious objections among teachers, as a result of which it was not adopted.

Despite the reforms of the 1990s - 2000s, the Cyrillic alphabet of the 1957 model is still widely used: literature is published in it, the largest newspaper in Karakalpakstan “Erkin Karakalpakstan” is printed, and document flow is carried out in government institutions.

In the early 1990s, work began in independent Uzbekistan to translate the scripts of the peoples of this country onto a Latin basis. At the end of 1993, a project for a Latinized Uzbek alphabet was approved. Following this, in February 1994, a new alphabet was approved for the Karakalpak language. This alphabet was based on the General Turkic Alphabet and had the following form: Aa, Ää, Bb, Dd, Ee, Ff, Gg, Ḡḡ, Hh, Xx, Iı, İi, Jj, Kk, Qq, Ll, Mm, Nn, N̄n̄, Oo, Öö, Pp, Rr, Ss, Şş, Tt, Uu, Üü, Vv, Ww, Yy, Zz.

However, in 1995, the Uzbek, and a little later the Karakalpak alphabets were revised. All letters with diacritics were excluded from them, and digraphs and post-letter apostrophes were introduced instead. The transition to a new script was to be carried out by 2005. The alphabet in the 1995 version looked like this: Aa, Aʻaʻ, Bb, Dd, Ee, Ff, Gg, Gʻgʻ, Hh, Xx, Iı, İi, Jj, Kk, Qq, Ll, Mm, Nn, Nʻnʻ, Oo, Oʻoʻ, Pp, Rr, Ss, Tt, Uu, Uʻuʻ, Vv, Ww, Yy, Zz, Sh sh.

In 2009, changes were made to this alphabet again. According to the law of the Republic of Karakalpakstan dated October 8, 2009, the letter combination ts was replaced by c. The letters e, o and oʻ at the beginning of the original Karakalpak words began to be written as ye, wo and woʻ, respectively. The letter I ı has been replaced by Iʻ iʻ. The digraph ch has been introduced. After the reform, the Karakalpak alphabet received the following form: A a, B b, C c, D d, E e, F f, G g, H h, I i, J j, K k, L l, M m, N n, O o, P p, Q q, R r, S s, T t, U u, V v, W w, X x, Y y, Z z, Aʻ aʻ, Oʻ oʻ, Iʻ iʻ, Uʻ uʻ, Gʻ gʻ , Nʻ nʻ, Sh sh, Ch ch.

The current Latin alphabet is as follows:
The Cyrillic, Latin, and Arabic alphabets are shown below with their equivalent representations in the IPA. Cyrillic letters with no representation in the Latin alphabet are marked with asterisks. The last changes to the new Karakalpak alphabet were made in 2016: instead of letters with apostrophes (Aʻ aʻ, Oʻ oʻ, Iʻ iʻ, Uʻ uʻ, Gʻ gʻ, Nʻ nʻ), letters with acutes were introduced (Á á, Ó ó , Í ı, Ú ú, Ǵ ǵ, Ń ń). This is the seventh version of the Latin alphabet in Karakalpak writing since 1928.

Before 2009, C was written as TS; I and Í were written as dotted and dotless I; and the letters with apostrophe are now letters with acute.

<text>Peters is a small lunar impact crater in the north-northeastern part of the Moon, lying in the gap between Neison to the west and Arnold to the southeast. Due south of Peters is the crater Moigno.

This is not a particularly prominent feature, having a low rim and an interior floor that has been almost completely submerged by lava flows. The rim is circular and only lightly worn, with a notch along the southeast. The inner surface is level and almost featureless.
