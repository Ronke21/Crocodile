==Collegiate career==
Richardson played college basketball for DePaul University where he averaged 17.9 points and 10.2 rebounds per game in two seasons. He became the only player in school history to have 1,000+ points, 500+ rebounds and 100+ three-point field goals. As a freshman, he earned both the Conference USA Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year. Richardson declared for the NBA draft after his sophomore year in 2000.

==Professional career==
===Los Angeles Clippers (2000–2004)===
Richardson was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers with the 18th pick of the 2000 NBA draft. He was selected after fellow Clippers Darius Miles and Keyon Dooling. Richardson would star in a documentary with Miles entitled &quot;The Youngest Guns&quot; which chronicled their first three seasons in the NBA with the Clippers. 

Richardson&#x27;s debut game was played on October 31, 2000 in a 94 - 107 loss to the Utah Jazz where he recorded 2 points and 2 rebounds in 7 minutes of playing time. In his first game as a starter on November 29, 2000, Richardson played 43 minutes and recorded 18 points, 8 rebounds, 1 assist and 1 steal in a 103 - 86 victory over the Golden State Warriors.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2003, Richardson posted a career-high 44 points in a 120 - 104 victory over the Denver Nuggets. It was the only time in Richardson&#x27;s 13-year career where he scored 40 points or more. 

Richardson spent four seasons with the Clippers playing in 281 games (starting 105 of them) and averaging 12.0 points, 4.6 rebounds and 1.4 assists at 25.7 minutes per game.

===Phoenix Suns (2004–2005)===
Richardson signed with the Phoenix Suns as a free agent on July 29, 2004.

The 2004–05 season was a big one for not only Richardson, but the Suns as well. He set a new Suns single-season record for three-point field goals, eclipsing the previous record of 199 set by Dan Majerle. He finished the season with a league-leading 631 three-point attempts, and 226 three-point field goals, co-leading the league with Kyle Korver. Richardson also set a Suns franchise record with nine threes against the New Orleans Hornets on December 29, 2004. Richardson would also go on to win the NBA All-Star Three-Point Shootout that same season. The Suns finished the regular season with a league-best 62 wins and 20 losses. He made his playoff debut with the Suns in 2005 who would eventually lose to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals.

On November 20, 2024 on his Knuckleheads Podcast with Darius Miles, Richardson revealed that his sole season in Phoenix was his favorite season of his entire NBA career. Citing that he had the most fun playing with his teammates, the rising stardom of his fellow teammates such as Steve Nash and Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire and how the Suns were able to shock the league by making a deep playoff run to the Western Conference Finals.

===New York Knicks (2005–2009)===
Richardson was traded from the Suns, along with 2005 draft pick Nate Robinson, to the New York Knicks in exchange for Kurt Thomas and Dijon Thompson on June 28, 2005.
His first three seasons in New York were largely hampered by nagging injuries—the most serious being a chronic back condition—which limited him to 55, 49, and 65 games played respectively. His injury situation finally stabilized during the 2008–2009 season, when he remained healthy enough to appear in all, but seven games. This does not include two additional DNP-CDs (Did Not Play – Coach&#x27;s Decision) that he received; one on February 28, 2009, against the Miami Heat and a second on March 10, 2009, against the Milwaukee Bucks.

=== Miami Heat (2009–2010) ===
During the 2009 offseason, Richardson was traded four times within a 49-day timespan. On the 2009 draft day (June 25, 2009), Richardson was first traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Darko Miličić. His stint with the Grizzlies was very short as he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Zach Randolph just 22 days later on July 17, 2009. His second stint with the Clippers only lasted for three days as on July 20, 2009, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Sebastian Telfair, Mark Madsen, and Craig Smith.

Finally, after being a member of the Timberwolves for just 24 days, Richardson was traded for the fourth time on August 13, 2009, this time to the Miami Heat for Mark Blount. Richardson would be a consistent starting Small Forward for the Heat, starting in 75 of the 76 games he played while averaging 8.9 points and 4.9 rebounds.

===Orlando Magic (2010–2012)===
In 2010, Richardson signed with the Orlando Magic. He remained with the team until October 2012, when he was waived. During his 2-year stint with Orlando, Richardson played 105 games and averaged 4.4 points, 0.7 assists and 2.9 rebounds while shooting 31.5% from the 3pt-line.

===Return to New York (2013)===
On April 16, 2013, Richardson signed with the New York Knicks for the remainder of the season, joining that team for a second time. He only played one regular season game, scoring five points in twenty nine minutes on 1 for 11 shooting, but brought down ten rebounds. He did appear in five playoff games, hitting two three-pointers in New York&#x27;s 26-point blowout win of the Pacers in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.

On July 10, 2013, Richardson was part of a trade package to the Toronto Raptors, along with center Marcus Camby, forward Steve Novak, a first-round draft pick in 2016, and two second-round draft picks in 2014 and 2017, in exchange for forward Andrea Bargnani.

Richardson&#x27;s final NBA game was played on May 11, 2013, in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals versus the Indiana Pacers. Richardson played less than 2 minutes and the only stat he recorded was 1 rebound. 
On September 3, 2013, Richardson was waived by the Raptors.

==Post-playing career==
On August 7, 2014, it was announced that Richardson was named the director of player development for the Detroit Pistons.

 he worked for the Bally Sports Orlando Magic broadcast team.

<text>A clearance car is a type of railroad car in maintenance of way service. Its purpose is to check the clearances around the tracks and ensure that trains conforming to the railroad&#x27;s standard loading gauge or &quot;dynamic envelope&quot; will not encounter any obstruction. Additionally, by measuring the actual clearances along a route, the railroad can determine whether outsize loads can be accommodated along that route, and the largest size feasible. 

==Design==
Early clearance cars simply consisted of an outline of the system loading gauge attached to a railroad car, which would be towed along the route to ensure the clearances were still sufficient.

Later clearance cars functioned by using physical feelers—rods which extended from the car in all directions which would be deflected back by obstructions. These would be connected to instrumentation which displayed the actual clearance at that point. These feelers have an advantage in that they bounce back and do not break if they do hit something.

Subsequently, clearance cars using lasers for measurement have come into service. These are generally HiRail trucks – road vehicles with supplemental rail wheels.

==Benefits==
The clearance car allowed accurate and speedy measurement of the clearances for a structure. Generally they were only owned by larger railroads; other railroads sometimes leased them for short periods. Some were self-propelled, while others were locomotive-hauled.

<doc id="1307617" wikidata="Q723817" url="?curid=1307617" title="Dusty in Memphis">
<text>Dusty in Memphis is the fifth studio album by English singer Dusty Springfield, released on 31 March 1969 in the United States by Atlantic Records and by Philips Records internationally. Springfield worked on the album with a team of musicians and producers that included Jerry Wexler, Arif Mardin, Tom Dowd, conductor Gene Orloff, backing vocalists the Sweet Inspirations, bassist Tommy Cogbill, and guitarist Reggie Young. Initial sessions were recorded at American Sound Studio in Memphis, while Springfield&#x27;s final vocals and the album&#x27;s orchestral parts were recorded at Atlantic Records&#x27; New York City studios. 

&quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; sold poorly upon its initial release despite featuring one of Springfield&#x27;s top-10 UK hits &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;. It has since been acclaimed as her best work and one of the greatest albums of all time. Music critic Robert Christgau called it &quot;the all-time rock-era torch record&quot; and included it in his &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981). In 2001, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 2020, the album was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In its official press release, the library stated that despite its modest sales when first released, &quot;over time, &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; grew in stature to become widely recognized as an important album by a woman in the rock era.&quot;

==Writing and recording==
Hoping to reinvigorate her career and boost her credibility, Springfield signed with Atlantic Records, at the time the label of Aretha Franklin, one of her soul music idols. Springfield signed with Atlantic on the condition that she work with the label&#x27;s chief producer and co-owner Jerry Wexler. For their initial album project, Wexler provided Springfield with dozens of song demo recordings, and the two decided on a program of 11 songs, primarily in the pop genre. Eight of the songs were composed by New York and Los Angeles-based songwriters who at the time were associated with the &quot;Brill Building Sound&quot;. However, &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;, the album&#x27;s best-known track, was not among these, and it was written with the idea of submitting it to Aretha Franklin. (Franklin cut her own version of the song in 1969 after Springfield&#x27;s single reached the #10 position in the Billboard Hot 100.) &quot;Preacher Man&quot; was musically and thematically closer to classic Southern soul as was &quot;Breakfast in Bed&quot;. Farthest from the soul genre on the album was Michel Legrand&#x27;s &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot;, which Springfield resisted and Wexler insisted she do. Wexler&#x27;s and Springfield&#x27;s idea for the album was to record the pop compositions with Southern soul&#x27;s rhythmic feel, a combination that other producers had tried successfully at American Sound Studios with acts like The Box Tops and Merrilee Rush.

The &quot;Memphis&quot; sessions were supervised by Wexler, fellow Atlantic producer Arif Mardin, and Atlantic engineer Tom Dowd. Performing with Springfield were back-up singers the Sweet Inspirations and members of an informal group of American Sound Studios studio musicians known as the Memphis Boys, which included guitarist Reggie Young and bassist Tommy Cogbill. In addition to their pop session work, The Memphis Boys had previously backed soul musicians Wilson Pickett, Joe Tex, Bobby Womack, and King Curtis. Recording engineer Terry Manning, who was hired on assignment to write a piece on the sessions for the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, attended and ended up assisting Dowd, along with Ed Kollis. The songs were written by Gerry Goffin and Carole King, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, Randy Newman, and Burt Bacharach and Hal David.

The recording was a challenge for Wexler. In his book &quot;Rhythm and the Blues&quot;, Wexler wrote that out of all the songs that were initially submitted to Springfield for consideration, &quot;she approved exactly zero.&quot; For her, he continued, &quot;to say yes to one song was seen as a lifetime commitment.&quot; Springfield disputed this, saying she did choose two: &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot; and &quot;Just a Little Lovin. Wexler was surprised, given Dusty&#x27;s talent, by her apparent insecurity. Springfield later attributed her initial unease to a very real anxiety about being compared with the soul greats who had recorded in the same studios. Eventually Dusty&#x27;s final vocals were recorded in New York. Additionally, Springfield stated that she had never before worked with just a rhythm track, and that it was the first time she had worked with outside producers, having self-produced her previous recordings (something for which she never took credit).

During the Memphis sessions in November 1968, Springfield suggested to the heads of Atlantic Records that they should sign the newly formed Led Zeppelin group. She knew John Paul Jones, who had backed her in concerts. Without having ever seen them and largely on Dusty&#x27;s advice, the record company signed the group with a $143,000 advance.

==Release and reception==

&quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; was released by Atlantic Records in March 1969 in the United States and on 18 April by Philips Records in the United Kingdom. The album was a commercial failure in both countries, reaching only number 99 on the American album charts and failing to chart altogether on the British Top 40. According to music journalist Peter Robinson, its failure stalled Springfield&#x27;s career instead of reviving it, although the record eventually became &quot;a pop culture milestone [and] timeless emotional reference point&quot; for listeners who discovered it in second-hand shops or purchased one of its several reissues years later. Robert Christgau called it &quot;a pop standard and classic&quot;, predicting in his 1973 column for &quot;Newsday&quot; it would be &quot;the kind of record that will sell for years because its admirers need replacement copies, and it is the perfect instance of how a production team should work.&quot; Greil Marcus was less enthusiastic in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, deeming some of the songwriting inconsistent on what was &quot;a real drifting, cool, smart, sexually distracted soul album&quot;.

Despite modest sales (the platter has sold 216,000 in the United States in the SoundScan era, per Luminate Entertainment Data) it was the first of a small wave of &quot;in Memphis&quot;-style albums that were recorded by pop singers at American Recording Studios. Three months after Springfield&#x27;s album was released, Dionne Warwick&#x27;s &quot;Soulful&quot; album was released, which had a similar mix of soul and pop and was recorded at American. In the summer of 1969, Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;From Elvis in Memphis&quot; was released, featuring Presley recording at American with The Memphis Boys musicians. The following year, Petula Clark&#x27;s &quot;Memphis&quot; album, also recorded at American, was released. These albums were all part of a larger 1960s and 1970s boom of soul and pop music production in Memphis (home to Stax Records, Hi Records, and other studios and labels), and nearby Muscle Shoals, Alabama.

&quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; has been named one of the greatest albums of all time. &quot;NME&quot; named it the 54th greatest album ever in their 1993 list, and it was voted number 171 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the record 89th on the magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, a rating which the album maintained in a 2012 revised list, before rising to number 83 in a 2020 reboot of the list. According to Richie Unterberger of AllMusic, the album&#x27;s reputation has improved significantly over time as the music is &quot;deserving of its classic status&quot;. Tony Scherman from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; is a &quot;pure gem&quot;, Springfield&#x27;s greatest work, and perhaps one of the great pop records recorded. &quot;Q&quot; took note of its balance between &quot;R&amp;B and sensitive pop dramas&quot;, and &quot;Spin&quot; critic Chuck Eddy viewed it as one of the all-important blue-eyed soul records. In &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Keith Phipps wrote that Springfield and her team of musicians and producers for &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; developed an elegant and distinct fusion of pop and R&amp;B that predated the Philadelphia soul sound of the 1970s. According to Eric Klinger from PopMatters, its sophisticated style of music influenced the sound of 1990s trip hop artists who sampled songs from the album and became a blueprint for British female singers of the 2000s, including Adele, Amy Winehouse, Duffy, Joss Stone, Paloma Faith and Rumer.

==Track listing==

==CD reissues==

&quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; was first released on compact disc by Philips Records/PolyGram and re-released in the UK/Europe in 1988. The second CD release was issued by Rhino Records (at the time independent, licensed from Atlantic) in the US in 1992, and included three bonus tracks. A Deluxe Edition with 14 bonus tracks, again released by Rhino (now a sublabel of Warner Music), followed in 1999. A fourth 24-bit digitally remastered CD with a third set of bonus tracks was issued by Mercury Records/Universal Music in the UK/Europe in 2002.

Among the additional materials featured on these re-releases are recordings from the Atlantic Records archives; outtakes and alternate mixes from the &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; sessions, two tracks from a cancelled second album with Jerry Wexler recorded in 1969, tracks from a shelved second album with Gamble &amp; Huff recorded in 1970 (following &quot;A Brand New Me&quot;/&quot;From Dusty...With Love&quot;) and the intended &quot;Faithful&quot; album produced by Jeff Barry in 1971, which came to be Springfield&#x27;s final recordings for the Atlantic label. The completed &quot;Faithful&quot; album was however left unreleased when its pilot singles &quot;Haunted&quot; and &quot;I Believe in You&quot; failed to perform. With the exception of a mono mix of the title track &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Faithful&quot; all master tapes for this album were later destroyed in a fire – along with Springfield&#x27;s unreleased recording of Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;To Love Somebody&quot; from the follow-up sessions with Wexler – but Jeff Barry had kept reference copies of the intended final mixes and these were digitally remastered and first released as part of Rhino&#x27;s Deluxe Edition of &quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot; in 1999.

<doc id="1307620" wikidata="Q3038426" url="?curid=1307620" title="Liz Shaw">
<text>Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Shaw is a fictional character played by Caroline John in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its spin-offs. A civilian member of UNIT, an international organisation that defends Earth from alien threats, she was the companion of the Third Doctor for the 1970 season. Liz appeared in 4 stories (25 episodes).

==Appearances==

===Television===
Liz Shaw first appears in the first serial of the seventh season (1970), &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, having been drafted from the University of Cambridge by Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart as a scientific advisor to UNIT. She is a brilliant scientist, an expert on meteorites, with degrees in medicine, physics and a dozen other subjects. Her extensive training is still pale in comparison to the Doctor&#x27;s own knowledge of the universe and scientific principles far beyond those of Earth. Sceptical at first of UNIT&#x27;s ambit to defend against alien invasion, Shaw changes her mind when she encounters the newly regenerated Doctor and becomes involved in defeating the plans of the Nestene Consciousness and its animated plastic Autons.

Liz continues to work with the Doctor and UNIT through encounters with the Silurians, the so-called Ambassadors of Death and the Inferno project, where the Doctor also encountered Section Leader Elizabeth Shaw, an alternative version of the scientist in a parallel universe. She eventually resigns from UNIT and returns to Cambridge; there was no &quot;farewell scene&quot; on screen for Liz, with her departure simply being announced by the Brigadier at the beginning of &quot;Terror of the Autons&quot;. She reportedly told the Brigadier that all the Doctor really needed was someone to pass him his test tubes and tell him how brilliant he was.

Liz&#x27;s life after leaving UNIT is not explored in the series. In the Seventh Doctor serial &quot;Battlefield&quot; (1989), the Doctor gives Ace a fake ID with the name Elizabeth Shaw. Additionally, in the 2010 &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot; Colonel Tia Karim mentions that &quot;Miss Shaw can&#x27;t get back from Moonbase until Sunday.&quot; Caroline John appeared as an illusory image of Liz in the 20th Anniversary television movie &quot;The Five Doctors&quot; (1983), and as Liz herself in the 1993 charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;.

===Other media===
John also played Liz Shaw in a series of straight-to-video stories produced by BBV under the umbrella title of &quot;P.R.O.B.E.&quot;, in which the character works with a paranormal investigation organisation not unlike UNIT, called the &quot;Preternatural Research Bureau&quot;. John later returned as Liz appearing in five Big Finish audio stories narrated by the character: &quot;The Blue Tooth&quot; (2007), &quot;Shadow of the Past&quot; (2010), &quot;The Sentinels of the New Dawn&quot; (2011), &quot;Binary&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Last Post&quot; (2012). The latter introduces Rowana Cooper as Liz&#x27;s mother, Emily, and the planned sequel was not finished due to John&#x27;s death in June 2012, although Cooper reappears as Emily Shaw in the audio &quot;The Cloisters of Terror&quot; when she assists the Fourth Doctor and Leela in investigating a mystery at her college.

Caroline John&#x27;s daughter Daisy reprises her mother&#x27;s role as Liz in &quot;The Third Doctor Adventures- Volume Five: Primord&quot;, where Liz is infected by samples of Stahlman&#x27;s gas and psychologically corrupted to try and infect all of humanity with the gas, nearly infecting the Doctor until he is able to pass on instructions to the Brigadier and Jo about how they might be able to help him resist the mutation long enough to find a cure. Daisy reprises the role again in Series 9 of &quot;The Diary of River Song&quot;, where Liz is put out to be relegated to assistant to UNIT&#x27;s new temporary scientific advisor, River Song- the Doctor&#x27;s future wife- while the Doctor is otherwise engaged.

The 1996 Virgin Missing Adventures novel &quot;The Scales of Injustice&quot; by Gary Russell also explores the events surrounding Liz&#x27;s resignation from UNIT. Liz additionally appears with UNIT in the Missing Adventures novel &quot;The Eye of the Giant&quot; (1996) and the Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;The Devil Goblins from Neptune&quot; (1997). &quot;Scales of Injustice&quot; directly acknowledges that Liz left UNIT because she felt surplus to requirements with the Doctor around and wanted to focus more on scientific research, the Doctor assuring her that he understood her reasons and regretted that they hadn&#x27;t been able to spend more time together as friends. Liz eventually does travel in the TARDIS with the Third Doctor and Jo Grant in the Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;The Wages of Sin&quot; (1999), which takes place after the Doctor regains his freedom, with the Doctor&#x27;s attempt to take her to witness the Tunguska Event accidentally resulting in them becoming caught up in the truth about the death of Grigori Rasputin. A parallel version of her appears in the novel &quot;Blood Heat&quot; where she is still part of UNIT fighting against the Silurians in a world where the Doctor died before defeating the reptiles. According to the 1997 Virgin New Adventures novel &quot;Eternity Weeps&quot; by Jim Mortimore, Liz dies in 2003, the victim of an extraterrestrial terraforming virus contracted while she was part of a UNIT team investigating an alien artefact on the Moon, despite the efforts of the Seventh Doctor and his current companion Chris Cwej to save her.

==Casting and characterisation==
The part of Liz Shaw was given to Caroline John, who was recommended to the outgoing production team of Peter Bryant and Derrick Sherwin by James Cellan Jones. Although John had been working regularly on the stage (including for the National Theatre Company under Laurence Olivier), she was frustrated that she had not gained any TV roles. According to several DVD releases in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; series and interviews with the actress herself, John had taken the dramatic step of having herself photographed in a bikini and sent the picture around to BBC producers. The photo ended up on Bryant&#x27;s desk.

After appearing in the 25 episodes that made up the four stories of the seventh season, John left the programme because she was pregnant with her first child, and new producer Barry Letts had already decided against renewing her contract. Letts and script editor Terrance Dicks viewed the character as unsuccessful, feeling that she did not fill the companion&#x27;s role of asking the Doctor for exposition and acting as an audience surrogate. In 1978, John expressed mixed feelings about her role as Liz, saying, &quot;I was excited at first to be a brainy girl, but all the directors wanted really was a sexy piece. It was such an effort looking glamorous on cold clay-pits and rubbish dumps. I enjoyed the series but found it restricting after a while.&quot; John continued to appear at fan conventions from the 1990s onwards.

John particularly enjoyed her role as the &quot;totalitarian&quot; version of Liz seen in the alternate universe in &quot;Inferno&quot;, disliking when she had to change to the normal Liz. Liz has been seen as more of an assistant than a traditional companion because she never travelled on the TARDIS. Unlike other &quot;co-conspirator&quot; companions, Liz serves as a bridge between the Doctor&#x27;s world and the more grounded UNIT. She has also been described as more mature and equal to the Doctor than previous companions. Following John&#x27;s death in 2012, then current &quot;Doctor Who&quot; showrunner Steven Moffat described Liz as &quot;not just a sidekick but a scientist in her own right&quot; and an example of his sentiment that &quot;the Doctor&#x27;s companions should never be his assistants – they&#x27;re the people who keep him on his toes&quot;.

==Reception==
Christopher Bahn of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; described Liz as a &quot;missed opportunity&quot; because she had such a short time as an assistant and it seemed to him that &quot;the producers didn&#x27;t really know what to do with a strong, smart female character&quot;. Bahn also commented that Liz&#x27;s &quot;cynicism and skepticism was a good quality for a scientist, but also a sometimes offputting character tic&quot;. In an analysis of &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; for &quot;Doctor Who: The Television Companion&quot;, David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker were positive towards Liz, who they said was &quot;very good foil, far removed from the naïve young companions of the past&quot;.

&quot;Radio Times&quot; writer Mark Braxton wrote that, despite her short appearance, &quot;Liz established herself thanks to her brilliant mind, a succession of crazy outfits and Caroline John&#x27;s consummate professionalism as an actress&quot;. Braxton also felt that &quot;she was too caring to be cold&quot; and despite not having the &quot;companionly affection&quot; later seen with Jo Grant and Sarah Jane Smith, they had an &quot;innate respect&quot; for each other. Braxton&#x27;s colleague Patrick Mulkern, while calling John a &quot;gifted actress&quot;, criticised the way Liz was &quot;severely styled&quot; in her first appearance. &quot;SFX&quot; Ian Berriman also criticised Liz in &quot;Spearhead from Space&quot;, writing that she was &quot;so snarky she&#x27;s annoying&quot;. Will Salmon of the magazine listed Liz&#x27;s departure as one of the worst in the series since she just &quot;[vanished] between seasons&quot;. DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott felt that John could come across as &quot;a bit stiff&quot; and did not have much chemistry with Pertwee, most likely due to their personal relationship.

In 2010, readers of &quot;Radio Times&quot; voted Liz the 27th best companion, out of 48 options. In Ridley Scott&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Prometheus&quot;, Noomi Rapace&#x27;s character is named Dr. Elizabeth Shaw; Dr. Nicolas Pillai, a lecturer from the University of Warwick&#x27;s Film and Television Studies department, argues that this is a reference to the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; character, as Scott used to work for the BBC as a designer. However, this is entirely speculation and neither Scott nor the scriptwriters of &quot;Prometheus&quot; have ever officially stated the name was intentionally used as such.

<text>Juan Francisco de Lángara y Huarte (1736 – 1806) was a Spanish Navy officer and politician.

== Life and career ==
=== Early life ===
He was born at A Coruña, Galicia, the son of a renowned Basque family. His father was admiral Juan de Langara Arizmendi, who fought as lieutenant (Teniente de Navío) at the Battle of Minorca. Having entered the Spanish Navy at a young age, in 1750, as a Guardiamarina, Lángara quickly distinguished himself in various wars. From 1766 until 1771 he made several scientific expeditions, among others, three voyages to the Philippines and the China Sea, and made several important contributions in cartography. In 1774 he commanded the frigate &quot;La Rosalia&quot; on a scientific expedition, which led to several important discoveries with regards to pilotage and navigation.

=== Anglo-Spanish War (1779–83) ===
By 1778, he was a &quot;Brigadier&quot; or Commodore and participated in the Armada of 1779, capturing the British corvette HMS &quot;Winchcomb&quot;, the only Royal Navy ship lost during the failed expedition. When the combined fleet wintered at Brest and Cádiz respectively, during the winter 1779–80, Lángara was left in command of a small squadron of 11, mostly smaller ships of the line. With this he faced the entire naval strength of 18 battleships and 6 frigates under Sir George Rodney off the stormy, dark cliffs of Cape St. Vincent, in the afternoon of 16 January 1780.

Lángara&#x27;s intention had been to intercept a British convoy destined for the relief of Gibraltar; but the French authorities, who knew well enough about Rodney&#x27;s departure and strength, failed to warn the Spanish, who maintained Lángara&#x27;s fatal orders until it was too late. He and his crews could not prevent the British from capturing five of their own number, while the 70-gun &quot;Santo Domingo&quot; blew up during the early evening. Lángara surrendered at 2 a.m. with his flagship, the 80-gun &quot;Fénix&quot;, completely battered. This battle is known as the Moonlight Battle, because it was unusual for naval battles in the age of sail to take place at night.

Released from captivity soon afterwards, Lángara&#x27;s career did not suffer. By 1793 he was a &quot;Capitán General&quot; of the Spanish fleet, after serving for a time as an effective naval minister.

=== French Revolutionary Wars ===
In 1793 he joined Sir Samuel Hood, with 18 Spanish ships-of-the-line, in capturing the French naval arsenal of Toulon (August–December). The mutual cooperation between the two sides was marked by tension and suspicion. Horatio Nelson had acquired a poor opinion of Spanish seamen when he visited the port of Cádiz on his way to the Mediterranean, which is not surprising as the Spanish mercantile marine was so small that only about 10 per cent of the Spanish Navy&#x27;s crewmen were experienced seamen. At Toulon, these tensions made it difficult to defend the newly-captured arsenal. When Gravina was heavily wounded, a Spanish lieutenant general called Valdez asserted his own claim to overall command of the allied force. In support of that claim, Lángara moved his three-decker &quot;Reina Luisa&quot; flagship into a position broadside on to HMS &quot;Victory&quot; with two other three-deckers on her bow and quarter. Hood, however, resisted this attempted intimidation.

Before Toulon was evacuated, British and Spanish incendiary parties commanded by Sir Sidney Smith were sent to destroy the arsenal and the ships in the harbour. It was Lángara who conducted the rear-guard action, in which his men blew up the arsenal and refloated a number of warships, later sent to Britain. Hood was able to get fifteen French ships out of Toulon before the fall of the city. On 14 February 1795, after 6 hours of chase aboard the ship of the line &quot;Reina Luisa&quot; he captured the 32-gun French frigate &quot;Helène&quot;.

For a short while, after the alliance between France and Spain had been concluded, in 1795, Lángara co-operated with Napoleon during his Italian campaign of 1796, and sailed from Cádiz with nineteen ships of the line and ten frigates, escaped past Rear-Admiral Mann&#x27;s division which Jervis had posted to watch Cádiz and passed into the Mediterranean Sea. He collected seven ships at Cartagena and cruised as far as Corsica, but did not attack the British squadron lying in San Fiorenzo Bay. He proceeded to Toulon, where the combined Franco-Spanish fleet, totalling 38 ships of the line, heavily outnumbered the British Mediterranean squadron, which had lost a third of its strength after Mann precipitately fled back to the English Channel. The French and Spanish navies&#x27; success in joining up in this way caused the Admiralty in London to order the Royal Navy to evacuate both Corsica and the Mediterranean.

The same year he was once again appointed Secretary of State for the Navy and made a Counsellor of State. In 1797, he was appointed Inspector-General of the navy. Retiring in 1799, he died in 1806.

== Family ==
His wife, Doña María Lutgarda, the 2nd Marquésa del Real Transporte y de la Victoria, whom he had married in 1758 was the granddaughter of Don Juan José Navarro, 1st Marqués de la Victoria (for his victory over Sir John Byng at Cape Sicié, in 1744) and daughter of the renowned explorer and naval officer Don Antonio de Úlloa.

== Namesakes ==
During Lángara&#x27;s period at the head of the Spanish navy, Spanish explorers were charting the coast of what is now British Columbia, Canada, and, in their charts, named some land formations after him. His name is still found among place names in BC, including Langara Island, off the coast of northern BC, and Langara College in Vancouver, which was founded in 1970, as the Langara campus of Vancouver Community College, and obtained the status of an independent public college in 1994.

<text>Duff Green (August 15, 1791June 10, 1875) was an American teacher, military leader, Democratic Party politician, journalist, author, diplomat and industrialist.

==Early life and education==
Green, the son of William and Lucy Ann (Marshall) Green, was born August 15, 1791, in Woodford County, Kentucky. He was a school teacher in his native state of Kentucky and served with his commander, General William Henry Harrison, in the Kentucky militia in the War of 1812 and commanded the Missouri Brigade in the Indian Campaign, earning the rank brigadier general. Thereafter, he was known by many as General Duff Green. He then settled in Missouri, where he worked as a schoolmaster and practiced law. He was a member of the Missouri Constitutional Convention of 1820, and was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives in 1820 and to the Missouri State Senate in 1822, serving one term in each house. Becoming interested in journalism, he purchased and for two years edited the newspaper &quot;St Louis Enquirer&quot;.

==Career==
In 1826, in Washington, DC, Green bought and later edited, the newspaper &quot;The United States Telegraph&quot;, which became the principal organ of Andrew Jackson&#x27;s backers, helping him defeat John Quincy Adams in the presidential election of 1828. Upon Jackson&#x27;s election to the presidency, the &quot;Telegraph&quot; became the principal organ of the administration, receiving printing patronage estimated at $50,000 a year. Green became one of the &quot;côterie&quot; of unofficial advisers of Jackson, known as the &quot;Kitchen Cabinet&quot;, on which Jackson depended after the Petticoat affair.

During the quarrel between Jackson and Vice President John C. Calhoun, Green advocated Calhoun and, through the &quot;Telegraph&quot;, attacked the Jackson administration. In consequence, the Jackson administration revoked its patronage for the &quot;Telegraph&quot; during the spring of 1831. With the date of December 24, 1833, Adams records in his diary that James Blair &quot;had knocked down and very severely beaten Duff Green, editor of the &quot;Telegraph&quot;...&quot; Blair paid a &quot;three hundred dollars fine for beating and breaking the bones&quot; of Green. Green, however, continued to edit &quot;The United States Telegraph&quot; in the Calhoun interest until 1835 and endorsed Calhoun&#x27;s opinions during the Nullification Crisis. Duff&#x27;s daughter, Margaret Maria, was the mother of Calhoun&#x27;s grandson, also named John Caldwell Calhoun. During his second term, Jackson replaced Calhoun with Martin Van Buren as vice president.

From 1835 to 1838, Green edited &quot;The Reformation&quot;, a radically partisan publication, devoted to free trade, states&#x27; rights, and the idea of &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot;. In 1840, he established the &quot;Pilot&quot; in Baltimore to endorse the Harrison-Tyler ticket. Although endorsed initially by the Whig party, Green&#x27;s controversial editorials concerning Catholic influence in American politics alienated his readers. Subscriptions decreased, and publication was suspended in 1841.

In 1841 to 1843, he was in Europe on behalf of the administration of President John Tyler and is said to have been instrumental in causing the appointment of Alexander Baring, Lord Ashburton, to negotiate in Washington on the boundary dispute between Maine and Canada.

In January 1844, Green established in New York City a short-lived journal, &quot;The Republic&quot;, to criticize the spoils system and to advocate free trade. In September 1844, Calhoun, now secretary of state, sent Green to Texas, ostensibly as consul at Galveston but actually, it seems, to report to the administration, which was then considering the question of the annexation of Texas, on the political situation in Texas and Mexico.

After the end of the Mexican–American War, Green was sent to Mexico in 1849 by President Zachary Taylor to negotiate concerning the money that in the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States had agreed to pay, and he saved his country a considerable sum by arranging for payment in exchange instead of &quot;in specie&quot;.

Subsequently, Green was engaged in railway building in Georgia and Alabama. He was also one of the founding associates in the incorporation of the New Mexican Railway Company. Duff was attracted to Dalton, Georgia in 1851 by the construction of the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad from Knoxville, Tennessee to connect with the Western and Atlantic Railroad. He profited by making strategic land purchases. As his wealth grew, he donated land for many public projects in Dalton.

===American Civil War===
During the American Civil War, Green organized three iron manufacturing plants for production of iron, nails, horseshoes, and rails in support of the Confederacy. He and his son Ben also established the Dalton Arms Company in 1862.

====Meeting with Abraham Lincoln in Virginia====
On April 4, 1865, near the end of the war, Green reportedly met with US President Abraham Lincoln aboard a US Navy ship, USS Malvern, as the latter visited Virginia. Calling Green a friend, Lincoln greeted him amicably with a smile at first, but Green did not reciprocate in kind, refusing to shake Lincoln&#x27;s hand when it was offered. In full view of US Navy admiral David Dixon Porter, Green reportedly then proceeded to verbally berate Lincoln, calling him a tyrant, a murderer, and accusing him of visiting Virginia only to gloat boastfully over the defeated Confederacy as well as accusing him of starting the Civil War. After listening patiently to Green berate him for a while, Lincoln&#x27;s smile soon disappeared and, according to Porter&#x27;s narrative, Lincoln became incensed, angrily condemning Green as a traitor for advocating the Confederacy:

Porter&#x27;s account ends with Green, surprised and left speechless by Lincoln&#x27;s rare bout of anger, quickly exiting the room and being removed from the ship. According to another eyewitness account, however, namely that of Lincoln&#x27;s bodyguard William H. Crook, Lincoln listened impassively and said nothing until Green, having &quot;exhausted himself,&quot; said, &quot;I would like, sir, to go to my friends,&quot; prompting Lincoln to direct General Godfrey Weitzel, who was also present, to &quot;please give Mr. Green a pass to go to his friends.&quot;

===Pardon by Andrew Johnson===
After the war, Green was pardoned by President Andrew Johnson for his advocacy of the Confederacy, and paid a $20,000 fine.

==Later life and death==
Green was one of the founding members of the Pennsylvania Fiscal Agency, incorporated November 1, 1859 in Pennsylvania. At the time, he gained 42,000 shares but paid with a bad check the 5% payment on only 5,000 shares. On March 26, 1864, Thomas C. Durant, the vice president of the Union Pacific Railroad Company purchased the corporation as a front construction company, whereby the directors and principal stock holders of the Union Pacific retained all construction profits. They then used the funds to purchase Union Pacific stock at par value and resell it on the open market for even greater profits. Durant changed the company name to the Crédit Mobilier of America. The scandal involving the sale of discounted Credit Mobilier stock to Congressional members voting for payment of exorbitant transcontinental railroad construction costs occurred during the Johnson administration but was revealed during the Grant administration.

Green died in Dalton, Georgia, a city that he had helped to build.

<text>The American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is a species of crocodilian found in the Neotropics. It is the most widespread of the four extant species of crocodiles from the Americas, with populations present from South Florida, the Caribbean islands of Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola, and the coasts of Mexico to as far south as Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela.

The habitat of the American crocodile consists largely of coastal areas. It is also found in river systems, but tends to prefer salinity, resulting in the species congregating in brackish lakes, mangrove swamps, lagoons, cays, and small islands. Other crocodiles also have tolerance to saltwater due to salt glands underneath the tongue, but the American crocodile is the only species other than the saltwater crocodile to commonly live and thrive in saltwater. They can be found on beaches and small island formations without any freshwater source, such as many cays and islets across the Caribbean. They are also found in hypersaline lakes; one of the largest known populations inhabits Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic.

The American crocodile is one of the largest crocodile species. Males can reach lengths of more than , weighing over . On average, mature males are more in the range of in length weighing up to about . As with other crocodile species, females are smaller, rarely exceeding in length even in the largest-bodied population.

Like any other large crocodilian, the American crocodile is potentially dangerous to humans, but it tends not to be as aggressive as some other species. American crocodiles coexist with the American alligator in Florida, and with the smaller spectacled caiman within Central America and South America. The IUCN lists the American crocodile as vulnerable.

==Taxonomy and etymology==

The American crocodile was described by Georges Cuvier in 1807, and became known as the &quot;sharp-snout alligator&quot;. In 1822, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque postulated that the species was in fact a crocodile.

The species was redescribed as &quot;Crocodylus floridanus&quot; by William Temple Hornaday in 1875, when Hornaday and C. E. Jackson were sent to Florida to collect alligator hides. Upon hearing of a &quot;big old gator&quot; in Arch Creek at the head of Biscayne Bay, Hornaday and his companions searched for it and reported:

In a few hours, we got sight of him, out on the bank in a saw-grass wallow. He was a monster for size—a perfect whale of a saurian, gray in color—and by all the powers, he was a genuine crocodile!

&quot;Crocodylus floridanus&quot; is now considered an invalid junior synonym of &quot;C. acutus&quot;.

==Evolution== 
Until 2020, the evolution of the American crocodile was poorly understood. However, the discovery of the Miocene species &quot;Crocodylus checchiai&quot; indicates that it, the Orinoco crocodile (&quot;Crocodylus intermedius&quot;), Morelet&#x27;s crocodile (&quot;C. moreletii&quot;), and the Cuban crocodile (&quot;C. rhombifer&quot;) all share an ancestor hailing from Africa. The newly discovered animal may also represent the base of the evolutionary radiation of these animals, representing the missing link between crocodiles in Africa and the Americas.

The genus &quot;Crocodylus&quot; likely originated in Africa and radiated outward toward Southeast Asia and the Americas, although an Australia/Asia origin has also been considered. Phylogenetic evidence supports &quot;Crocodylus&quot; diverging from its closest recent relative, the extinct &quot;Voay&quot; of Madagascar, around 25 million years ago, near the Oligocene/Miocene boundary. American crocodile populations in Florida, Jamaica and Hispaniola (in the Dominican Republic) differ in gene frequencies.

Below is a cladogram based on a 2018 tip dating study by Lee &amp; Yates simultaneously using morphological, molecular (DNA sequencing), and stratigraphic (fossil age) data, as revised by the 2021 Hekkala &quot;et al.&quot; paleogenomics study using DNA extracted from the extinct &quot;Voay&quot;.
==Characteristics==

The American crocodile is a highly fecund species. Average clutch size is 38 eggs, and fecundity is over 20% after 15 years old. The species has a high adult survival rate and a long life span. Like all true crocodilians, the American crocodile is a quadruped, with short, stocky legs; a long, powerful tail; and a scaly hide with rows of ossified scutes running down its back and tail. Individuals can be identified by using multiple dorsal scute patterns. Its snout is elongated and includes a strong pair of jaws. A , specimen had a bite force of . Its eyes have nictitating membranes for protection, along with lacrimal glands, which produce tears.

The nostrils, eyes, and ears are situated on the top of its head, so the rest of the body can be concealed underwater for surprise attacks. Camouflage also helps it prey on food. The snout is longer and narrower than that of the American alligator, but broader on average than that of the Orinoco crocodile. American crocodiles are also paler and more grayish than the relatively dark-hued American alligator. This crocodile species normally crawls on its belly, but it can also &quot;high walk&quot;. Larger specimens can charge up to nearly . They can swim as fast as by moving their bodies and tails in a sinuous fashion, but they cannot sustain this speed.

Adults have a uniform grayish-green coloration with white or yellow undersides, while juveniles have dark cross-banding on the tail and back.

 The American crocodile is sometimes confused with the Morelet&#x27;s crocodile, a smaller species that is native to Mexico.

===Size===
New hatchlings are about in length and about in mass. The average adult in the continental rivers can range from long and weigh up to in males, while females can range from and weigh up to , the lower total length representing their average size at sexual maturity, the upper representing the expected upper size limit for the respective sex in most known populations. Common weights of adult American crocodiles in Florida may range from with corresponding lengths of . With extensive conservation efforts underway, there appears to be an increase in the number of large American crocodiles in Florida, some of the largest reportedly exceeding in length. Eight adult American crocodiles from Costa Rica ranged in total length from . Large adults of this species are capable of reaching in weight, with individuals approaching exceeding in weight, ranking it among the largest living crocodilians in the Neotropical realm. It is estimated that specimens of &quot;C.acutus&quot; measuring in TL would weigh around , specimens measuring in TL would weigh around , and specimens measuring in TL would weigh around . However, body mass can be fairly variable in mature adults. A large male specimen from Costa Rica measuring in total length weighed about . On the other hand, another specimen measuring in total length was found to have weighed An individual named &quot;Papillon&quot; was considered to be one of the largest American crocodiles in captivity. It measured in length, weighed , and was estimated to be more than 80 years old when he died. The largest recorded female measured in length and weighed . Exceptionally large specimens may arguably exceed , possibly reaching or exceeding , but such specimens are unverified and possibly dubious although some are arguably supported by size projections from skull lengths. These exceptionally large crocodiles are estimated to range between in length and weigh between , though these are mere estimations and not verified.
==Distribution and habitat==

The American crocodile is the most widespread of the four extant species of crocodiles from the Americas. They are saltwater-tolerant, and have thus been capable of colonizing a multitude of islands within the Caribbean, and on some coastal Pacific islands as well. They inhabit waters such as mangrove swamps, river mouths, fresh waters, and salt lakes, and can even be found at sea, hence their wide distribution throughout southern Florida, the Greater Antilles (excluding Puerto Rico and Isla de la Juventud, where they are replaced by the introduced spectacled caiman), Martinique, southern Mexico (including the Yucatán Peninsula), Central America, and the South American countries of Colombia, Peru, Venezuela (including on Margarita Island), and Ecuador. The American crocodile is especially plentiful in Costa Rica.

American crocodiles coexist with the smaller spectacled caiman within Central America. The only other crocodiles present within the American crocodile&#x27;s range are the Morelet&#x27;s crocodile, and the critically endangered Cuban and Orinoco crocodiles. In addition, an American/Cuban crocodile hybrid was recently discovered in the Cancún area of Mexico. The crocodile likely originated in the Zapata Swamp of Cuba (the only place where these wild hybrids exist, and where the two species are sympatric), and swam to the Yucatán Peninsula.

===Caribbean===

One of its largest documented populations (the largest in the Caribbean) is in Lago Enriquillo, a hypersaline lake in the Dominican Republic. In Haiti, the only population known is in the brackish lake Etang Saumâtre, where the population is nearing extirpation due to overhunting and poaching. In Jamaica, the species inhabits most of the swamps available, as well as brackish portions of rivers. American crocodiles have recently been sighted in Grand Cayman, leading experts to believe the species may be swimming from Cuba (which is home to a large American crocodile population) and slowly repopulating Grand Cayman. There have been reports of American crocodiles in Trinidad, however, those sightings are thought to have arisen due to the accidental translocation of the animal outside of its normal range. The species is thus not considered indigenous to Trinidad.

===Florida===
The American crocodile&#x27;s saline tolerance may have allowed it to inhabit limited portions of the United States, particularly southern Florida. Contrary to popular misinformation, the presence of the American alligator is not the reason the American crocodile was unable to populate brackish waters north of Florida, but rather the climate, as crocodiles are less tolerant of cold. Within the United States, the American crocodile&#x27;s distribution is generally limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. They are primarily found south of the latitude of Miami, in Everglades National Park, Florida Bay, Biscayne Bay, Dry Tortugas National Park and the Florida Keys. A sizable population occurs near Homestead, at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station. Some individuals have been sighted in Palm Beach, Brevard, Pinellas and Sarasota counties. Their range in Florida is the only place in the world where alligators and crocodiles coexist.

The current US population, estimated at 2,000 and growing, is a sign of return to the northernmost portion of their range. There were suspicions as early as 1829 by Rafinesque that there were more than just alligators in the state, but confirmation could not be acquired until 1869, when a specimen could be brought back for examination. Records show they were plentiful in areas like Key Largo, Miami Beach, and wherever there were the appropriate mangroves for nesting and foraging. However, at the end of the 19th century, hunting them for their leather became a cottage industry in South Florida, and beginning in 1910, habitat destruction commenced on a massive scale, with the construction of a railroad designed to connect the mainland with the Keys. Crocodile hunters, who migrated to the upper Florida Keys before and after the railroad’s construction, slaughtered almost every crocodile in northeast Florida Bay for the commercial market. The widespread hunting did not cease until the 1970s: at one point in that decade, there were fewer than thirty total nests counted. As of 2020, further population seems to be expanding south to reclaim former habitat in the Florida Keys, where numbers are multiplying quickly, and old records indicate they once inhabited mangroves as far north as Tampa Bay.

==Biology and behavior==
American crocodiles are more susceptible to cold weather than American alligators. American crocodiles do not have social groups, but occasionally they congregate for feeding and basking in the daytime. While basking, they will leave their mouths wide open that exposes blood vessels in the mouth to cooler and warmer air, which helps regulate body temperature. While an American alligator can survive in water temperatures of and below for some time, an American crocodile in that environment would lose consciousness and drown due to hypothermia. American crocodiles, however, have a faster growth rate than alligators, and are much more tolerant of saltwater. Unlike other crocodiles, the American crocodile uses acoustic signals to communicate. Crocodile communication is centered on short-distance communications during courtship and hatching.

Cleaning symbiosis involving fish and the American crocodile has been described.

===Hunting and diet===
American crocodiles are apex predators, and any aquatic or terrestrial animal they encounter in freshwater, riparian and coastal saltwater habitats is potential prey.

The snout of the American crocodile is broader than some specialized fish-eating crocodilians (e.g., gharials and freshwater crocodiles), allowing it to supplement its diet with a wider variety of prey. In addition the snout gets even broader and bulkier as the animal matures, a sign for a shift in prey items. Prey species have ranged in size from the insects taken by young American crocodiles to full-grown cattle taken by large adults, and can include various birds, mammals, turtles, snakes, lizards, smaller crocodilians, echinoderms, insects, arachnids, crabs, other crustaceans, snails, other molluscs, frogs, fish, and occasionally carrion and fruits. In Haiti, hatchling and juvenile American crocodiles lived primarily off of fiddler crabs (&quot;Uca&quot; ssp.), making up 33.8% and 62.3% of the diet by weight, respectively. Elsewhere, aquatic insects and their larvae and snails are near the top of the food list for American crocodiles at this very early age. Immature and subadult American crocodiles, per a study in Mexico, have a more diverse diet that can include insects, fish, frogs, small turtles, birds and small mammals. One specimen of had a catfish, a mourning dove and a bare-tailed woolly opossum in its stomach.

In Florida, bass, tarpon and especially mullet, large crabs, snakes, mammals that habit the riparian and coastal regions of the Everglades, such as opossums and raccoons appeared to be the primary prey of American crocodiles. In Southern Florida, it was found that American Crocodiles rely on marine food sources 65% of the time and rely on water gleaned from marine food 80% of the time. In Haiti, adults appeared to live largely off of various birds, including herons, storks, flamingos, pelicans, grebes, coots and moorhens, followed by concentrations of fish including &quot;Tilapia&quot; and &quot;Cichlasoma&quot;, at times being seen to capture turtles, dogs and goats. One adult from Honduras had stomach contents consisting of a crocodile of its own species, a turtle shell and peccary hooves. It was noted that historically in Mexico that, among several local farmers, the capturing of livestock by American crocodiles has been a source of some conflict between humans and American crocodiles and large adults occasionally can become habitual predators of goats, dogs, pigs and cattle. In Quintana Roo, Mexico, most prey that could be determined was fish for sub-adults and adults with sub-adults having a broader prey base than either younger or adult American crocodiles. In Costa Rica, American crocodiles have been recorded hunting and killing adult female olive ridley sea turtles (&quot;Lepidochelys olivacea&quot;) when they come to nest around beaches. Reportedly, these American crocodiles hunt primarily in the first few hours after nightfall, especially on moonless nights, although they will feed at any time. It hunts in the typical way for most crocodilians, ambushing terrestrial prey when it comes to edge of the water or is sitting in shallows and dragging it down to be drowned or attempting to ambush aquatic prey from near the surface of the water.

====Interspecies predatory relations====
Adult American crocodiles are apex predators; they have no natural predators. They are known predators of lemon sharks, and sharks avoid areas with American crocodiles.
Usually, American alligators are dominant over and more behaviorally aggressive than American crocodiles. However, on one occasion, an American crocodile in a Florida zoo escaped its cage and started a fight with a large male American alligator in a bordering pen, and was killed. Conversely, there is one confirmed case of an American crocodile preying on a sub-adult American alligator in the wild in Florida. American alligators and American crocodiles do not often come into conflict in the wild, due largely to habitat partitioning and largely separate distributions.

There are several records of American crocodiles killing and eating spectacled caimans in South America. Areas with healthy American crocodile populations often hold only limited numbers of spectacled caimans, while conversely areas that formerly held American crocodiles but where they are now heavily depleted or are locally extinct show a growth of caiman numbers, due to less competition as well as predation. In areas of Cuba where the two species coexist, the smaller but more aggressive Cuban crocodile is behaviorally dominant over the larger American crocodile. In Mexico, some Morelet&#x27;s crocodile individuals have escaped from captivity, establishing feral populations and creating a problem for the populations of American crocodile, which must compete with this invasive species.

===Reproduction===
American crocodiles breed in late fall or early winter, engaging in drawn-out mating ceremonies in which males emit low-frequency bellows to attract females. Body size is more important than age in determining reproductive capabilities, and females reach sexual maturity at a length of about . In February or March, gravid females will begin to create nests of sand, mud, and dead vegetation along the water&#x27;s edge. Nest location is crucial, and with the correct amount of vegetation, the eggs will develop within a small temperature range. Because sex determination is temperature-dependent in crocodilians, slight aberrations in temperature may result in all-male or all-female clutches, which would possibly harm the health of the population. About one month later, when it is time to lay, the female will dig a wide hole diagonally into the side of the nest and lay 30 to 70 eggs in it, depending on her size. Females will maintain and reuse these holes for many years. After laying, the female may cover the eggs with debris or leave them uncovered. The white, elongated eggs are long and wide, with a number of pores in the brittle shell.

During the 75- to 80-day incubation period, the parents will guard the nest, often inhabiting a hole in the bank nearby. Females especially have been known to guard their nests with ferocity. But in spite of these precautions, American crocodile eggs sometimes fall prey to raccoons (arguably the most virulent natural predator of crocodilian nests in the Americas), coatis, foxes, skunks or other scavenging mammals (including coyotes in Mexico and American black bears in southern Florida), as well as large predatory ants, crabs and vultures. In Panama, green iguanas were seen to dig up and prey on American crocodile eggs occasionally, although in several cases were caught by the mother American crocodile and eaten. Crocodilian eggs are somewhat brittle, but softer than bird eggs. Despite noticeable nest guarding during egg incubation, guarding of young after hatching seems to be minimal in this species.

This species exists mostly in tropical areas with distinct rainy seasons, and the young hatch near the time of the first rains of the summer (July–August) after the preceding dry season, and before the bodies of water where they live flood. In this stage of development of their young, mother American crocodiles exhibit a unique mode of parental care. During the hatching process, when the young American crocodiles are most vulnerable to predation, they will instinctively call out in soft, grunt-like croaks. These sounds trigger the female to attend to the nest, uncovering the eggs if they have been covered. Then she will aid the hatchlings in escaping their eggs and scoop them up with her mouth, carrying them to the closest water source.

The hatchlings, which are in length, have been reported to actively hunt prey within a few days of hatching. It is not uncommon for the mother to care for her young even weeks after they have hatched, remaining attentive to their calls and continuing to provide transportation. About five weeks after hatching, the young American crocodiles disband in search of their own independent lives. Most of them will not survive, being preyed upon by several types of raptorial birds, other reptiles, and large fishes (e.g., barred catfish, Atlantic tarpons, common snook and lemon sharks, boa constrictors, black spiny-tailed iguanas and spectacled caimans). Those that do survive grow rapidly, feeding on insects, fish and frogs. Additionally, some young American crocodiles feed on each other.

===Facultative parthenogenesis===

Facultative parthenogenesis has been shown to occur in &quot;C. acutus&quot; based on data from whole genome sequencing. The evidence supports a particular mechanism of parthenogenesis, terminal fusion automixis during meiosis.

==Conservation status==

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the species as vulnerable. On March 20, 2007, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service declassified the American crocodile as an endangered species, changing its status to &quot;threatened&quot;. It remains protected from poaching and killing under the federal Endangered Species Act. NatureServe considers the Florida population &quot;Imperiled&quot;.

Because of hide hunting, pollution, loss of habitat, and commercial farming, the American crocodile is endangered in parts of its range. As a result of overhunting in the 1950s and 1960s, Venezuela banned commercial crocodile skin harvesting for a decade starting in 1972. In southern Florida, about two-thirds of American crocodile deaths are attributed to road collisions, about 10% to intentional killing, and only about 5% to natural causes. In recent years in Jamaica there has been rampant poaching of the species for their meat and there has been a significant population drop compounded by the lack of action by the government. On Hispaniola, they were once found throughout the island, but currently, the only confirmed remaining presence is at the two largest lakes on the island: Etang Saumâtre in Haiti, and Lago Enriquillo in the Dominican Republic.

An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 American crocodiles live in Mexico, Central America and South America, but population data is limited. An additional 500 to 1,200 are believed to live in southern Florida. It is estimated that the population of mature individuals as of 2020 is around 5,000.

==Relationship with humans==
Attacks by American crocodiles have been reported in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama. The American crocodile rates somewhere in the middle of all crocodilians temperamentally. A study by the IUCN found that it has the highest incidence of reported attacks on humans of any of the crocodilians from the Americas, but fatalities were rare. The species usually does not attack people as regularly as Old World crocodiles do; the estimated number of attacks is considerably smaller than those by the saltwater (&quot;C. porosus&quot;) and Nile crocodiles (&quot;C. niloticus&quot;), which are considered the most aggressive crocodilians towards humans. Particular to this species, it is noted for having a shy demeanor and clearly does not want anything to do with humans; it will not stand its ground and will flee humans at the very sight of them. The Cuban crocodile (&quot;C. rhombifer&quot;) is rather more aggressive in interspecies interactions than the American crocodile and attacks and displaces American crocodiles when they are kept in mixed species enclosures at zoos or at crocodile farms together, despite being smaller than the American species. However, attacks on humans are rarely reported in Cuban crocodiles, due to its much more limited habitat and range.

In May 2007, two instances occurred within one week of children being attacked and killed by American crocodiles—one in Mexico just south of Puerto Vallarta and one in Costa Rica. On August 24, 2014, a man and a woman were swimming in a canal in Gables by the Sea, a community in Coral Gables, Florida, at 02:00, a canal where crocodiles were known to occur, when they were bitten in the shoulder and the hand by an American crocodile. Although the crocodile was in length, and weighed an estimated , it did not press the attack, but released and moved away from its victims. (Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission, Crocodile Response Program) This was the first documented wild crocodile attack on humans in Florida since records of human-crocodile conflict have been kept. There have reportedly been 36 American crocodile attacks on humans from 1995 to 2017 in the Cancun area of southeastern Mexico.

<text>Hollywood station is a train station in Hollywood, Florida, which is served by Tri-Rail and Amtrak. The station is located at 3001 Hollywood Boulevard, just west of I-95 and State Road 9. It has two side platforms serving the line&#x27;s two tracks.

== History ==
=== Seaboard Air Line Railway ===

The original station, which is used solely by Amtrak, is a former Seaboard Air Line Railway depot designed in the prevalent Mediterranean Revival style by Gustav Maass of the West Palm Beach architectural firm Harvey &amp; Clarke. Although the first Seaboard passenger train arrived in January 1927, the station did not open until 1928, in what was then a remote area of Hollywood.

The station consists of three distinct sections. The southern end of the building contains the passenger station, while the northern end consists of the freight room and docks. The center section of the station contains the baggage room. Entry into the passenger waiting room is through doors on the southern end. On the west side of the building is a separate entrance into what was, in keeping with racial segregation laws of the era, the &quot;colored&quot; waiting room; it was converted into railroad offices by the Seaboard in 1963.

Also in 1963, the Seaboard added a large Spanish-style barrel tile canopy to shelter the southern entrance, modifying the architectural details of the two entry porticos. At the same time, the railroad replaced the concrete-etched station signs on either end of the building with copper signs. The station is virtually identical to the Fort Lauderdale Seaboard station to the north.

The station was served by, among other Seaboard trains, the &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot; until 1953, and the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; beginning in 1939. Amtrak maintained &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; service to the station when it took over intercity passenger train service in 1971.

=== Tri-Rail commuter service ===
In 1988, through an agreement with CSX Transportation, the successor to Seaboard, the Florida Department of Transportation acquired the station as part of the state&#x27;s South Florida Rail Corridor. In January 1989, the South Florida Regional Transportation Authority (SFRTA) began using the station as a Tri-Rail stop. While Amtrak is the long-term lessee of the original station&#x27;s ticket office, waiting room, baggage room, and platform, and the city of Hollywood is the long-term lessee of the freight room, Tri-Rail uses additional facilities built immediately to north of the old depot. The station is the southernmost Tri-Rail stop in Broward County.

Due in part to Tri-Rail&#x27;s presence, Amtrak trains only stop southbound to discharge passengers and stop northbound to receive passengers bound for points north of West Palm Beach. On November 10, 2024, the &quot;Silver Star&quot; was merged with the as the &quot;Floridian&quot;.

<doc id="1307628" wikidata="Q806491" url="?curid=1307628" title="Bangkok Post">
<text>The Bangkok Post is an English-language daily newspaper published in Bangkok, Thailand. It is published in broadsheet and digital formats. The first issue was sold on 1 August 1946. It had four pages and cost one baht, a considerable amount at the time when a baht was a paper note. It is Thailand&#x27;s oldest newspaper still in publication. The daily circulation of the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; is 110,000, 80 percent of which is distributed in Bangkok and the remainder nationwide. It is considered a newspaper of record for Thailand.

From July 2016 until mid-May 2018, the editor of the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; was Umesh Pandey. On 14 May 2018, Pandey was &quot;forced to step down&quot; as editor after refusing to soften coverage critical of the ruling military junta.

==History==
The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; was founded by Alexander MacDonald, a former OSS officer, and his Thai associate, Prasit Lulitanond. Thailand at the time was the only Southeast Asian country to have a Soviet Embassy. The U.S. embassy felt it needed an independent, but generally pro-American newspaper to counter Soviet views. Some claim the financing came directly from the US State Department or possibly even the OSS itself, although there is no proof of this.

Nevertheless, under MacDonald&#x27;s stewardship, the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; was reasonably independent and employed many young reporters, including Peter Arnett and T. D. Allman, who later became known internationally. Alex MacDonald left Thailand after a military coup in the early 1950s, and the newspaper was later acquired by Roy Thomson. The paper has since changed hands. Major shareholders in Post Publishing include the Chirathivat family (owners of Central Group), the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; of Hong Kong and GMM Grammy Pcl, Thailand&#x27;s biggest media and entertainment company.

Post Publishing PLC, publisher of the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;, &quot;Post Today&quot; (daily Thai language business), and &quot;M2F&quot; (free Thai language daily) newspapers, returned a modest profit of 450,000 baht in 2016 compared to a 42.1 million baht loss in 2015.

On 14 May 2018, Pandey was &quot;forced to step down&quot; as editor after refusing to soften coverage critical of the ruling military junta. He said the board of directors had asked him to &quot;tone down&quot; the newspaper&#x27;s reporting and editorials on the actions of the military government, especially its suppression of free speech and election postponements. In a written statement by Pandey issued on 14 May, he said, &quot;When asked to tone down I did not budge and was blunt in letting those who make decisions know that I would rather lose my position than bow my head.&quot; The &quot;Post&quot; issued a statement on 16 May to assure its readers of its continued commitment to &quot;editorial independence&quot;. A senior &quot;Post&quot; official said that, &quot;This is not an issue of government interference or press freedom per se...This is simply an internal organisational matter.&quot; Pandey was not fired, but transferred to another high-ranking post as assistant to a deputy COO at no loss of income. Some sources within the company attributed Pandey&#x27;s ouster as editor to his poor management style and ethical breaches. Some staffers who worked with Pandey cited his creation of a hostile workplace environment and unprofessional behavior. Five current and former staffers blamed him for driving away many newsroom employees, creating a toxic environment and breaching ethics. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha denied that the government pressured the &quot;Post&quot; to reassign Pandey, dismissing the action as &quot;an issue within a private company.&quot;

==Staffing==
The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; employs (April 2015) 179 journalists, including reporters, rewriters, editors, copy editors, photographers, and designers. Twenty-nine foreign nationals work as copy editors and print and digital news editors. Sunday editor Paul Ruffini is an Australian national. Many &quot;Post&quot; staff reporters are Thai nationals, as fluency in Thai is required. Foreign staff write for the newspaper&#x27;s news, op-ed, sports, business, and features sections.

==Editorial stance==
In a country where media censorship is common, the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; portrays itself as being comparatively free. There are instances where the newspaper has been accused of self-censorship to avoid controversy or conflict with powerful individuals, including adherence to the country&#x27;s strict lèse-majesté law, which prohibits open criticism of members of the Thai Royal Family. Yet another example was the newspaper&#x27;s failure during the Vietnam War to report on bombing forays made from US Air Force bases in Thailand over military targets in North Vietnam and Cambodia, none of which received coverage in the local press.

Throughout the early-2000s, the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; took positions that were, at times, generally favorable to the government. After the Thai election of 2011 the paper took a largely anti-Thaksin position aligned with the Yellow Shirts and the Democrat Party.

The &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; was at one time well known among expatriates for Bernard Trink&#x27;s weekly &quot;Nite Owl&quot; column, which covered the nightlife of Bangkok. Trink&#x27;s column was published from 1966 (originally in the &quot;Bangkok World&quot;) until 2004, when it was discontinued. The newspaper has a letters page where expatriate and Thai regulars exchange opinions on local and international concerns. According to the &quot;Post&quot;, more than half of its total readership are Thai nationals.

During the tenure of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the &quot;Post&quot; largely toed the government line—at one point bowing to government pressure by firing a reporter who had exposed cracks in the runway of the prestige project Suvarnabhumi Airport along with the news editor, while &quot;The Nation&quot;, the &quot;Post&quot;&#x27;s competitor, actively campaigned for Thaksin to resign.

&quot;Bangkok Post&quot; columnist Andrew Biggs, who had previously worked at &quot;The Nation&quot;, views the &quot;Post&quot; as the &quot;more staid&quot; of the two dailies. He noted that both publications have been &quot;...champions of democracy. &quot;The Nation&quot; was just a little more vocal about it.&quot; Biggs&#x27;s column in the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot; was ended with the 30 December 2019 edition.

<doc id="1307645" wikidata="Q1890539" url="?curid=1307645" title="Ivory (soap)">
<text>Ivory () is an American flagship personal care brand created by the Procter &amp; Gamble Company (P&amp;G), including varieties of white and mildly scented bar soap that became famous for its claim of purity and for floating on water. Over the years, the brand has been extended to other varieties and products.

==History==
In 1840, the J.B. Williams Company in Glastonbury, Connecticut, manufactured soap under the name Ivorine. Williams decided to focus on its shaving soap and sold Ivorine to Procter &amp; Gamble, which later developed Ivory.

In 1879, James Norris Gamble, son of Procter &amp; Gamble co-founder James Gamble and a trained chemist, developed an inexpensive white soap. The name Ivory was created by Harley Procter, the other founder&#x27;s son, who was inspired by the quote &quot;[a]ll thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces&quot;, from Psalm 45 of the Bible. In September 1879, Procter &amp; Gamble trademarked &quot;Ivory&quot; as the name of its new soap product.

As Ivory is one of P&amp;G&#x27;s oldest products – it was first sold in 1879 – P&amp;G is sometimes called &quot;Ivory Towers&quot;, and its factory and research center in St. Bernard, Ohio, is named &quot;Ivorydale&quot;.

Ivory&#x27;s first slogan, &quot;It Floats!&quot;, was introduced in 1891. The product&#x27;s other well-known slogan, &quot;% Pure&quot;, which was in use by 1895, was based on the results of an analysis by an independent laboratory that Harley Procter hired to demonstrate that Ivory was purer than the castile soap available at the time.

The original Ivory bar soap was whipped with air in its production and floated in water, although P&amp;G discontinued this version of the soap in 2023, and the new version no longer floats. According to an apocryphal story, later discounted by the company, a worker accidentally left the mixing machine on too long, and the company chose to sell the &quot;ruined&quot; batch because the added air did not change the basic ingredients of the soap. When appreciative letters about the new, floating soap inundated the company, P&amp;G ordered the extended mix time as a standard procedure. However, company records indicate that the design of Ivory did not come about by accident. In 2004, over 100 years later, the P&amp;G company archivist Ed Rider found documentation that revealed that James N. Gamble, who was a chemist, had discovered how to make the soap float and noted the result in his writings.

In October 1992, Procter &amp; Gamble market-tested a new Ivory formula, a &quot;skin care bar&quot; that would address customer complaints about dryness but would not float like the original. In October 2001, P&amp;G tested the sinking bar soap as part of an advertising campaign in the United States, in a six-month plan to release 1,051 soap bars that sink, among other bars that float, to see if people would notice the sinking bars, even if given a cash reward of up to $250,000. The D. L. Blair company, part of Draft Worldwide, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, was assigned to administer the contest.

==21st century==
Ivory is currently a small brand by P&amp;G standards. The Ivory brand includes the classic bar soap, clear liquid soap (discontinued before 2016), hair and body wash, dish liquid, and a mild laundry detergent (not a soap) product called Ivory Snow. Research in 2001 by Lehman Brothers revealed that the U.S. sales of all Ivory products, including the liquid soap and dish detergent, represented less than 1% of P&amp;G&#x27;s total worldwide sales in the 52 weeks ended September 9, 2001.

==Ingredients==
A classic Ivory soap bar contains sodium tallowate, sodium cocoate or sodium palm kernelate, water, sodium chloride, sodium silicate, magnesium sulfate, and fragrance. The soap has a determined pH value of 9.5.
Ivory dishwashing liquid contains water, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, alkyl dimethyl amine oxide, sodium chloride, PPG-26, cyclohexanediamine, phenoxyethanol, methylisothiazolinone, and fragrance. It is sometimes considered a detergent instead of a soap.

New varieties of Ivory soap contain new ingredients. Simply Ivory (French: &quot;simplement ivory&quot;) contains sodium tallowate and/or sodium palmate, water, sodium cocoate or sodium palm kernelate, glycerin, sodium chloride, fragrance, and one or more of the following: coconut acid, palm kernel acid, tallow acid, palmitic acid, and tetrasodium EDTA. Adding glycerol and fatty acids typically reduces the soap&#x27;s harshness, while tetrasodium EDTA is used primarily to reduce soap scum formation. Ivory soap packaging has omitted the words &quot;soap&quot; or &quot;float&quot;, and is now produced with modified formulas; Ivory soap no longer floats.

<doc id="1307649" wikidata="Q310108" url="?curid=1307649" title="Gilbert Arenas">
<text>Gilbert Jay Arenas Jr. ( ; born January 6, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player. Arenas attended Grant High School in the Valley Glen district of Los Angeles, and accepted a scholarship offer to the University of Arizona late in his junior year. He was drafted by the Golden State Warriors with the 31st overall pick in the 2001 NBA draft.

Arenas is a three-time NBA All-Star, three-time member of the All-NBA Team during his time in Washington, and was voted the NBA Most Improved Player in the 2002–03 season in his final season in Golden State. Arenas was nicknamed &quot;Agent Zero&quot; while playing with Washington, due to his jersey number (0). He has also been nicknamed &quot;Gibby&quot; and &quot;Hibachi&quot; Both names quickly became fan favorites during his time in the Washington, D.C. area. Arenas played the shooting guard and point guard position.

Arenas was suspended for most of the 2009–10 NBA season because of handgun violations stemming from an episode on December 24, 2009, and for subsequent actions that appeared to make light of this episode.

In late 2010, Arenas was traded to the Orlando Magic. After the 2011 NBA lockout, Arenas was the first NBA player to be waived under the &quot;amnesty clause&quot;. He signed with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2011–12 NBA season, which would be his final season in the league.

==Early life==
Arenas was born in Tampa, Florida. His grandfather Hippolito Arenas, was a first-generation Cuban American. Arenas was raised in the San Fernando Valley section of Los Angeles where he played basketball at Ulysses S. Grant High School. His number, #25, was retired by the school. Arenas was a late bloomer, taking the final spot on the national ranking as the 99th in the class of 1999. Before beginning his freshman year at the University of Arizona, Arenas attended Michael Jordan&#x27;s basketball camp and was chosen to play on Jordan&#x27;s team during a game. He impressed Jordan by scoring eight baskets in his first eight possessions. Following the camp, Jordan told coach Lute Olson that Arenas deserved time on the court. Rodney Tention recruited Arenas to Arizona during a Summer AAU game.

==College career==
Arenas played basketball at the University of Arizona. He was 17 years old during his freshman season at Arizona, where he played 34 games, starting 31 of them and averaging 15.4 PPG and 4.1 RPG playing both shooting guard and point guard. One of his teammates, Richard Jefferson, would later join him in entering the 2001 NBA draft. In 2001, Arenas&#x27; sophomore year, he was named first-team All-Pac-10. He helped lead Arizona to the national championship game, where they lost to the Duke Blue Devils, 82–72. Arenas, who was reportedly dealing with a knee injury, struggled in the championship game. He scored 10 points, grabbing 4 rebounds and dishing 4 assists, shooting 4-17 from the field and 4-13 from 3, in what would be his final game with Arizona. Shortly after the tournament, Arenas announced that he was foregoing his last two years at college and would enter the 2001 NBA draft. NBA scouts thought that Arenas, at the time aged only 19, was Arizona&#x27;s best pro prospect.

==Professional career==

===Golden State Warriors (2001–2003)===
After a productive college career, Arenas entered the 2001 NBA draft. Despite strong consideration from many teams in the first round and even lottery teams such as the Boston Celtics, Golden State Warriors, Portland Trail Blazers and Sacramento Kings, Arenas fell to the second round in part due to his effort in interviews despite strong performances in workouts and scrimmages, being selected with the first pick of the second round 31st overall pick by the Golden State Warriors. Arenas stated, &quot;I had my 2-day pre-Draft workout with Celtics. Killed the first one, I skipped the 2nd to heal my Achilles so I can tryout with other teams. Celtic&#x27;s Jim O&#x27;Brien put out the rumor that I was immature, didn&#x27;t take it seriously. Once I was labelled that I was done as a 1st rounder.&quot; While slipping through the draft, Arenas contacted Rodney Tention, who was responsible for recruiting him to Arizona to see if he could return to school. Arenas was shocked teammate Richard Jefferson was selected ahead of him despite Jefferson mocked commonly in the top 10 to the late lottery. Arenas would wear the number 0 on his jersey to signify the number of minutes that experts predicted he would play coming as a 17 year old low end prospect from a small high school going to a college powerhouse in Arizona. Gilbert made his NBA debut on November 4, 2001, vs the Portland Trail Blazers after not playing his first 3 games, Arenas went scoreless, Arenas scored his first point a free throw in a game vs the Toronto Raptors on November 7, 2001. Arenas made his first field goal on January 16, 2002, in a game vs the Cleveland Cavaliers scoring 7 points and going 3-4 from the field. Arenas made his first career start on February 15, 2002, and on February 17, 2002, vs the Atlanta Hawks, Arenas had his first double digit scoring game with 12 points; he continued the streak to 9 games with one double double in that stretch. Arenas started 30 games and averaged 10.9 points per game for the Warriors, who finished in last place in the Western Conference that season. In 2002–03, his sophomore season, Arenas received the NBA Most Improved Player Award averaging 18.3 points, 6.3 assists and 4.7 rebounds as Golden State improved its victory total to 38, up from 21 last season with Arenas leading the charge, and was named Most Valuable Player of the Rookie-Sophomore game during the NBA All-Star Weekend. Arenas had a 33 game stretch where he averaged 23.4 PPG 5.7 APG and 4.7 RPG with 1.5 SPG on 46.7% FG and 37.7% from 3. Arenas had one of the best performances of his career during March 2003, when he dropped 41 points, grabbed six rebounds and dished five assists in a win against the Wizards which would be the team that made him their franchise player after the Warriors were unable to match. Arenas said after he won the Most Improved Player award that he didn&#x27;t think there was much to improve, and he had only needed more playing time and more experience.

===Washington Wizards (2003–2010)===

====2003–04 season====
After the 2002–03 season, Arenas became a restricted free agent. He reportedly flipped a coin to decide among several teams seeking to sign him, including the Wizards, Warriors, and Clippers. The Washington Wizards offered him a six-year, $60 million contract making him the face of the franchise after just turning 21 years old. The Warriors were unable to match this offer because they were over the salary cap and because Arenas was a second-round pick. If Arenas had been drafted in the first round, the salary cap had exceptions that would have allowed the Warriors to match the offer sheet. The &quot;Gilbert Arenas Rule&quot; was later created to allow teams to re-sign restricted free agents who were not first-round picks. Arenas battled a strained abdominal muscle injury all season which would cause him to have only to start 52 games in his first year in Washington and constantly sitting on the sidelines dropped his shooting percentage instead of breaking out into the franchise cornerstones in his first year Washington envisioned, Arenas still lead the team in PPG and APG.

====2004–05 season====
With Arenas being healthy, he teamed up with former teammate guard Larry Hughes (22.0 points per game) in 2004–05 to give the Wizards the highest-scoring backcourt duo in the NBA. Arenas was selected for his first NBA All-Star Game. He guided the team to a 45-win season and its first playoff berth since 1997. Arenas led the team in scoring with 25.5 ppg, finishing seventh in the league in that category. He also finished sixth in the league in steals per game in 2004–05 with 2.24 (Hughes led the league with 2.93 steals per game).
In the fifth game of the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs in 2005, Arenas hit a 16-foot fadeaway as time expired to give the Wizards a 112–110 win over the Chicago Bulls. The Wizards eventually won the series, the franchise&#x27;s first playoff series victory in more than two decades. In the second round, the Wizards were swept by the Miami Heat, who had been the #1 seed in the Eastern Conference.

====2005–06 season====
In 2006, Wizards fansite Wizznutzz.com jokingly nicknamed him &quot;Agent Zero&quot;, a nickname Arenas liked so much that it stuck.

Arenas averaged 29.3 points, which ranked fourth among the scoring leaders, two steals (also fourth), and 6.1 assists per game during the 2005–06 NBA season. However, he was not initially chosen for the 2006 All-Star Game. He was named as a replacement after Indiana Pacers forward–center Jermaine O&#x27;Neal was injured. He also participated in the Three-point Shootout, where he placed second, after Dirk Nowitzki. The Washington Wizards finished 42–40 and earned the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference.

During the off-season, Arenas said that he was willing to take a pay cut in order to give the Wizards additional money with which to sign available free agents. He had expressed a desire to win a championship with the Wizards. One of Arenas&#x27; most memorable plays was a 40-foot jump shot in Round 1 of the 2006 NBA playoffs in which the Wizards were eliminated by the LeBron James-led Cleveland Cavaliers in six games.

====2006–07 season====
Arenas himself has noted that he withdrew from the United States national team for the 2006 FIBA World Championship because he felt that assistant coaches Mike D&#x27;Antoni and Nate McMillan had determined the roster even prior to tryouts. Afterward, he stated that he planned on averaging 50 points against their respective teams (Phoenix Suns and Portland Trail Blazers). He succeeded at his goal versus powerhouse Phoenix, scoring 54 points, including 21-of-37 from the field, 6-of-12 three-pointers (while reportedly eyeing in the direction of Suns chairman Jerry Colangelo), in a high-scoring 144–139 Wizards win over the Suns. However, on February 11 versus the Blazers, he was held to a lowly nine points, including tying the Wizards&#x27; franchise record for three-point futility, going 0-for-8 from behind the arc, in a 94–73 loss versus Portland.

In an overtime game versus the Los Angeles Lakers on December 17, 2006, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Arenas scored a career-high 60 points, adding 8 rebounds and 8 assists in helping lead the Wizards over the Lakers, 147–141. Arenas holds the Wizards&#x27; franchise record for points scored in a game by an individual, a record he now shares with Bradley Beal. The previous record of 56 points was held by Earl Monroe, achieved in 1968, which was also an overtime game against the Lakers. Arenas&#x27; 16 points in the extra period also set an NBA record for most points in one overtime period, surpassing Earl Boykins&#x27; record by one point.

On January 3, 2007, Arenas hit a 32-foot buzzer-beater to win the game against the Milwaukee Bucks, 108–105. Two weeks later on Martin Luther King Jr. Day he hit another buzzer-beating three-pointer to beat the Utah Jazz, 114–111, in a thriller at the Verizon Center. This same scenario has been added as a cut scene in the video game &quot;NBA Live 2008&quot;. He also hit a game-winning layup as time expired to beat the Seattle SuperSonics on March 21, 2007.
In February 2007, during the final days of All-Star voting, Arenas was voted as a first-time starter for the 2007 NBA All-Star game for the Eastern Conference, edging out Vince Carter by a slight margin, with 1,454,166 votes to Carter&#x27;s 1,451,156. At the time he was averaging 29.7 points per game, and led all Eastern Conference point guards in scoring and was second in the league.

Towards the end of the season, Arenas tore his MCL during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats, when Gerald Wallace fell into his leg. The Wizards struggled to finish the season with Arenas and teammate Caron Butler both being injured. Washington earned a playoff berth, but was swept in the first round in a rematch with the Cleveland Cavaliers. This was the last season Arenas made an All-Star game and All-NBA team before constant injuries and off-court issues.

====2007–08 season====
During the off-season, Arenas told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that he would opt out of his contract after the 2007–08 season, making him a free agent. He stated, &quot;...if something happens where they don&#x27;t want me or they&#x27;re going in a different direction, I can look elsewhere. But my intentions are not to leave.&quot;

Arenas only played eight games during the 2007–08 season, due to a knee injury, before he started practicing again in March, and returned to action on April 2, 2008, against the Milwaukee Bucks, scoring 17 points in a 110–109 home loss.

Ten days prior, Arenas stormed out of the locker room before a game against the Detroit Pistons. He had wanted to play, but his doctor did not give him clearance. Arenas made a surprise return on April 9, when he came out of the locker room with 5:30 left in the first quarter. He finished the game scoring 13 points and dishing out 3 assists in helping the Wizards beat the Boston Celtics 109–95. He came off the bench for the rest of the regular season as not to disrupt the chemistry the Wizards had built without him. Arenas got his wish when they matched up against the Cavaliers for the third straight year; however, it was apparent he was not 100% healthy. In games 1–3, he played limited minutes, citing soreness in his surgically repaired knee. A few minutes before game 4 of their first-round playoff appearance against the Cavaliers, Arenas announced he would sit out the rest of the playoffs.

====2008–09 season====
On June 9, 2008, Arenas officially opted out of the final year of his contract, but said that he would re-sign with the Wizards if they retained teammate Antawn Jamison, also a free agent. The Wizards did indeed sign Jamison to a contract. Arenas was offered a five-year contract worth more than $100 million by the Golden State Warriors and another max deal by the Wizards, a six-year deal worth $124 million. Arenas was teammates with Jamison during their time in Golden State.

On July 13, 2008, Arenas signed a six-year contract worth $111 million with the Wizards.

Due to the lingering injuries from April 2007, Arenas would not make his season debut until March 28, 2009, scoring 15 points and dishing 10 assists in a 98–96 loss to the Detroit Pistons.

He also played a second and final game against the number one seed Cleveland Cavaliers on April 2, in which both teams wore their respective throwback jerseys. Arenas dished out 10 assists and scored 11 points, in a win, and fans were excited to see Arenas, Brendan Haywood, Antawn Jamison, and Caron Butler re-uniting for the only time in the season. However, the Wizards finished poorly with a record of 19–63, the second-worst record in the NBA, tied with the Los Angeles Clippers, ending four years of consecutive playoff appearances.

====2009–10 season====
Arenas opened the 2009–10 season on a hopeful note, scoring 29 points as the Wizards beat the Dallas Mavericks 102–91 in their season opener. However, Arenas&#x27; performance would be inconsistent in the weeks ahead; on November 11, he set a Wizards team record for turnovers in a game with 12. On December 12, Arenas netted his first triple-double in years in a loss to the Pacers. Six days later Arenas had a season-best 45 points in a Wizards win over his former team, the Golden State Warriors.

====Firearms incident====
On December 24, 2009, it was reported that Arenas had admitted to storing unloaded firearms in his locker at Capital One Arena and had surrendered them to team security. In doing so, Arenas not only violated NBA rules against bringing firearms into an arena, but also violated D.C. ordinances as well. On January 1, 2010, it was also reported that Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton had drawn guns on each other in the Wizards&#x27; locker room during a Christmas Eve argument regarding gambling debts. The D.C. Metropolitan Police and the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office began investigating, and on January 14, 2010, Arenas was charged with carrying a pistol without a license, a violation of Washington, D.C.&#x27;s gun-control laws. Arenas pleaded guilty on January 15 to the felony of carrying an unlicensed pistol outside a home or business.

On January 6, 2010, Arenas&#x27; 28th birthday, the NBA suspended him indefinitely without pay until its investigation was complete. By nearly all accounts, the league felt compelled to act when Arenas&#x27; teammates surrounded him during pregame introductions prior to a game with the Philadelphia 76ers, and he pretended to shoot them with guns made from his fingers. NBA Commissioner David Stern said in a statement that Arenas&#x27; behavior after the investigation started &quot;has led me to conclude that he is not currently fit to take the court in an NBA game.&quot; He also said that Arenas was likely facing a lengthy suspension. The Wizards issued a statement of their own condemning the players&#x27; pregame stunt as &quot;unacceptable&quot;. On January 27, 2010, Arenas and Crittenton were suspended for the rest of the season, after meeting with Stern. On February 2, 2010, Arenas wrote an open editorial in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, in which he apologized for his actions, particularly for failing to be a better role model to young fans and for &quot;making light of a serious situation.&quot; On March 26, 2010, Arenas was convicted for his crimes and was sentenced to two years&#x27; probation and 30 days in a halfway house. Arenas started his sentence in the halfway house on April 9. He was released on May 7. The punishment for Arenas was significantly stiffer than for Crittenton, who received a year of unsupervised probation, or Delonte West, who had been driving around in a three-wheeled motorcycle in Prince George&#x27;s County with several loaded guns including a shotgun in a violin case. For his crime, West received eight months of home detention, two months of unsupervised probation, and forty hours of community service.

Upon his return to the Wizards for the 2010–11 season, Arenas elected to change his number from 0 to 9, claiming he was trying to put the entire incident from the previous season behind him. (Arenas had worn #0 all the way from college through his time in the NBA as a constant reminder of the number of minutes his critics said he would play in the NBA.)

After the first 24 games of the season, Arenas led the Wizards with an average of 17.3 points per game but the team had one of the worst win-loss records in the league at 6–18.

===Orlando Magic (2010–2011)===

On December 18, 2010, Arenas was traded to the Orlando Magic for Rashard Lewis. Arenas was reunited with former Warriors teammate and draftmate Jason Richardson in Orlando. Arenas chose to wear #1 on his jersey in honor of his favorite player, Penny Hardaway. He was the backup point guard, with Jameer Nelson at the starting role. The Magic finished 52–30 and clinched the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference and made the playoffs. However, Orlando lost to the Atlanta Hawks in six games in the opening round of the playoffs.

On December 9, 2011, after the end of the 2011 NBA lockout, Arenas was waived by the Orlando Magic under the amnesty clause, being the first player to be waived under the newly established clause at the time of its inclusion. He cleared waivers and became a free agent. Due to the 2011 NBA lockout, the 2011–12 NBA season was reduced from its normal 82 games to 66 games.

In the summer of 2011, Arenas acted with former Wizards teammate Etan Thomas in a dramatic production of &quot;Our Town&quot; by Thornton Wilder.

===Memphis Grizzlies (2012)===
On March 20, 2012, the Memphis Grizzlies signed Arenas. His primary role was again a backup point guard, this time to Mike Conley Jr. The Grizzlies finished 41–25 and clinched the fourth seed in the Western Conference. However, they lost in the first round to the Los Angeles Clippers in a full seven-game series. Arenas&#x27; final NBA game was played in Game 7 of the 2012 Western Conference First Round on May 13, 2012. Memphis would lose Game 7 72 - 82 (thus losing the series) to the Los Angeles Clippers with Arenas only playing for 3 minutes and recording no stats, Arenas was only 30 years old in his final NBA game.

===Shanghai Sharks (2012–2013)===
On November 19, 2012, Arenas signed with the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association. In his first season in the CBA, Arenas averaged 20.7 points per game, 7.3 rebounds per game, and 3.0 assists per game in 27.3 minutes per game. He played in 14 games and started in 8 of them. However, the Sharks finished at 10–22 and missed the playoffs.

==Broadcasting career==
Arenas hosted a daily sports show on Complex News&#x27; YouTube channel. He also has his own No Chill Productions podcast, &quot;The No Chill Podcast&quot;. In 2023, he launched another podcast called &quot;Gil&#x27;s Arena&quot; in partnership with Underdog Fantasy Sports which he hosted with Josiah Johnson and featured former NBA and WNBA players such as Brandon Jennings, Rashad McCants, Kenyon Martin, Lexie Brown and Sheryl Swoopes, with Norris Cole being a frequent guest on the show. Arenas is a regular co-host alongside Chad Johnson on Shannon Sharpe&#x27;s podcast, &quot;Nightcap&quot;. Arenas has had a show and created content with Fubo Tv for many years.

==Personal life==
Arenas has four children with Laura Govan, whom he dated from 2002 until 2014. Arenas met Govan while he was playing for the Warriors. Govan worked with the Sacramento Kings&#x27; public relations department. Arenas son Alijah is a 5 star prospect in the class of 2025, who committed to play for the USC Trojans. His daughter Izela Arenas is the 88th ranked prospect in the class of 2024 and is committed to Louisville. In July 2024, Arenas announced his engagement to French social media influencer Melli Monaco. Melli and Gilbert married on January 20, 2025.

One of Arenas&#x27; cousins is Javier Arenas, a professional football player who played for the NFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills. Another cousin, Armando Murillo, has played in the Canadian Football League.

 Arenas is a friend of rapper The Game and was listed in the booklet for The Game&#x27;s second album &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Advocate.&quot; He collects a synthetic basketball from each team played, as well as players&#x27; jerseys, of which he has more than 400, most of which are autographed. He supported PETA&#x27;s anti-fur mission by posing shirtless for their Ink, Not Mink campaign.

Arenas donated $100 for every point he scored in each home game during the 2006–07 season to local D.C.-area schools, while Wizards team owner Abe Pollin matched that contribution for each away game. He has also mentored a D.C. boy who lost his family in a fire at age 10. Arenas got him a job as a ball boy for the Wizards.

Arenas has had his own shoe, the Adidas Gil Zero, as well as his own line of Adidas TS Lightswitch shoes. Arenas wears size 14 shoes. Following the gun incident in 2009, Adidas dropped their sponsorship of Arenas. Instead of signing another endorsement deal, he turned to his vast collection of shoes. For nearly every game of the season, Arenas wore a different pair of shoes, wearing a total of 77 different pairs.

Arenas admitted that he ran about 60 red lights in 4 months and got away with it by keeping his dealer plates on his vehicle.

On June 27, 2013, Arenas was arrested by the LAPD for the possession of illegal fireworks.

<doc id="1307666" wikidata="Q5540922" url="?curid=1307666" title="George I. Mavrodes">
<text>George I. Mavrodes (November 23, 1926 – July 31, 2019) was an American philosopher and Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Michigan.

== Biography ==
Mavrodes received his B.S. degree (1945) from Oregon State College, his B.D. degree (1953) from Western Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.A. (1960) and PhD (1961) degrees in philosophy from the University of Michigan. He retired on March 31, 1995, being named professor emeritus of philosophy after thirty three years at the University of Michigan.

== Work ==
Mavrodes is the author of &quot;Belief in God: A Study in the Epistemology of Religion&quot; (1970) and &quot;Revelation in Religious Belief&quot; (1988). He has nearly one hundred articles covering such topics as revelation, omnipotence, miracles, resurrection, personal identity and survival of death, and faith and reason, as well as ethics and social policy issues that intersect with religion and morality—abortion, pacifism, the just war, and nuclear deterrence. Mavrodes has served as president of the Society for Philosophy of Religion and the Society of Christian Philosophers, and as a member of the executive committee of the American Theological Society. Mavrodes has held editorial positions with &quot;American Philosophical Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Faith and Philosophy&quot;, and &quot;The Reformed Journal&quot;. 

One of his more widely studied works is titled &quot;Religion and the Queerness of Morality&quot;, where he questions whether genuine moral obligation could make sense in a world as described in Russell&#x27;s &quot;A Free Man&#x27;s Worship&quot;.

He distinguished two major ways of understanding evolution. The first is the &quot;naturalistic&quot; way of understanding evolution as &quot;explicable entirely in terms of natural law without reference to a divine intention or intervention.&quot; But a &quot;theistic&quot; understanding of evolution holds that &quot;there was a divine teleology in this process, a divine direction at each crucial stage in accordance with divine plan or intention.&quot; In other words, a theistic understanding of evolution holds that although evolution occurred, God still directed evolution. Evolution is merely the tool of God&#x27;s design. Evolution, and even the great struggle for existence that &quot;selects&quot; some animals to survive and others to die, is the instrument with which God designs human beings and other animals. On this view, Darwinian evolution is consistent with the belief that God, through evolution, produced human beings for a purpose. Other philosophers, such as Henri Bergson and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, have also argued that the process of evolution is not blind and random, but directed and purposeful.

<doc id="1307672" wikidata="Q587339" url="?curid=1307672" title="Simon Jenkins">
<text>Sir Simon David Jenkins FLSW (born 10 June 1943) is a British author, a newspaper columnist and editor. He was editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; from 1976 to 1978 and of &quot;The Times&quot; from 1990 to 1992.

Jenkins chaired the National Trust from 2008 to 2014. He currently writes columns for &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

==Early life==
Jenkins was born , in Birmingham, England. His father, Daniel Thomas Jenkins, was a Welsh professor of systematic theology at Princeton Theological Seminary and a Minister in the Congregational and then United Reformed Church. He was educated at Mill Hill School and St John&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he earned a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics.

==Career==

===Journalism===
After graduating from the University of Oxford, Jenkins initially worked at &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine, before joining the &quot;Times Educational Supplement.&quot; He was then features editor and columnist on the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; before editing the Insight pages of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. From 1976 to 1978 he was editor of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, before becoming political editor of &quot;The Economist&quot; from 1979 to 1986. He edited &quot;The Times&quot; from 1990 to 1992, and since then has been a columnist for &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In 1998 he received the &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; Journalist of the Year award.

In January 2005, he announced he was ending his 15-year association with &quot;The Times&quot; to write a book, before joining &quot;The Guardian&quot; as a columnist. He retained a column at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and was a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. He gave up both on becoming chairman of the National Trust in 2008, when he also resumed an occasional column for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;.

====Opinions====
In April 2009, &quot;The Guardian&quot; withdrew one of Jenkins&#x27;s articles from its website after African National Congress leader and South African president-elect Jacob Zuma sued the paper for defamation. &quot;The Guardian&quot; issued an apology, and settled the libel case for an undisclosed sum.

In February 2010, Jenkins argued in a &quot;Guardian&quot; article that British control over the Falkland Islands was an &quot;expensive legacy of empire&quot; and should be handed over to the Argentinian government. He argued that they could be leased back under the supervision of the United Nations and that the 2,500 or so Falkland Islanders should not have &quot;an unqualified veto on British government policy&quot;.

In a piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in June 2010 he wrote that the government should &quot;cut [defence], all £45 billion of it. ... With the end of the Cold War in the 1990s that threat [of global communism] vanished.&quot; In August 2016 he wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in support of NATO membership, saying: &quot;It is a real deterrent, and its plausibility rests on the assurance of collective response&quot;.

Jenkins voted for the UK to Remain within the European Union in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, arguing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that leaving would provide Germany with dominance over the remainder of the union: &quot;It would leave Germany effectively alone at the head of Europe, alternately hesitant and bullying&quot;.

Soon after Rishi Sunak became Prime Minister, Jenkins wrote that his aides were &quot;young, sneakered, tieless image-makers, and fiercely loyal to him.&quot; They were &quot;special advisers, thinktanks and lobby groups isolated from the world outside.&quot;

Jenkins has consistently argued against Western military intervention and support in the conflict in Ukraine. Before the outbreak of full invasion in January 2022, amid heightened tensions, Jenkins wrote a pair of columns arguing that the United Kingdom should stay out of the &quot;border dispute&quot;, one he argues is a direct result of &#x27;NATO expansionism&#x27;. In 2023, he wrote a column discouraging the supplying of jets as military aid. In early 2024, he wrote that NATO was growing reckless in the conflict, as the war reached a &quot;predictable stalemate&quot;. Jenkins has been criticized for his opinions on Ukraine by many journalists and commentators, examples including Mark Laity and Oz Katerji.

In May 2024, following the local elections, he wrote calling metro mayors a &quot;farce of local democracy&quot; advocating their abolition.

===Books===
Jenkins has written several books on the politics, history and architecture of England, including &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Churches&quot; and &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Houses&quot;. In his 2011 book &quot;A Short History of England&quot;, he argued that the British Empire &quot;was a remarkable institution that dismantled itself in good order&quot;.

In 2022, Jenkins&#x27;s book, &quot;The Celts: A Sceptical History&quot;, stoked some controversy on account of his incredulous view of the Celts as a distinct cultural entity. The release of the work was met with a number of hostile reviews from specialists in Celtic studies, with these critics of the book alleging factual errors in the work as well as of the misrepresentation of sources.

===Public appointments===
Jenkins served on the boards of British Rail 1979–1990 and London Transport 1984–1986. He was a member of the Millennium Commission from February 1994 to December 2000, and has also sat on the board of trustees of The Architecture Foundation. From 1985 to 1990, he was deputy chairman of English Heritage.

In July 2008, it was announced that he had been chosen as the new chairman of the National Trust; he took over the three-year post from William Proby in November of that year. He remained in the post until November 2014.

==Personal life and honours==

Jenkins married the American actress Gayle Hunnicutt in 1978; the couple had one son. They separated in 2008 and divorced in 2009. He married Hannah Kaye, events producer at Intelligence Squared, in 2014.

Jenkins was appointed a Knight Bachelor for services to journalism in the 2004 New Year Honours.

In 2022, Jenkins was elected as a Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales.

<text>Fletcher Norton, 1st Baron Grantley, PC (23 June 1716 – 1 January 1789) was an English lawyer and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1756 to 1782 when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Grantley.

==Life and career==

Norton was the eldest son of Thomas Norton of Grantley, Yorkshire. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and the Middle Temple, being called to the bar in 1739. After a period of inactivity, he built up a profitable practice, becoming a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1754, and later attorney-general for the county palatine of Lancaster.

With his father he ordered the building in the mid-1700s of Grantley Hall, near Ripon in North Yorkshire.

In 1756, Norton was elected Member of Parliament for Appleby; he represented Wigan from 1761 to 1768, and was appointed solicitor-general for England and knighted in 1762. He took part in the proceedings against John Wilkes, and, having become Attorney General for England and Wales in 1763, prosecuted William Byron, 5th Baron Byron, for the murder of William Chaworth. However, he lost his office when the Marquess of Rockingham came to power in July 1765.

In 1769, as MP for Guildford, Norton became a privy councillor and chief Justice in Eyre of the forests south of the Trent, and in 1770 was elected Speaker of the House of Commons. In 1777, when presenting the bill for the increase of the civil list to the king, he told George III that &quot;parliament has not only granted to your majesty a large present supply, but also a very great additional revenue; great beyond example; great beyond your majesty&#x27;s highest expense.&quot; This speech aroused general attention and caused some irritation; but the Speaker was supported by Charles James Fox and by the city of London, and received the thanks of the House of Commons.

The king did not forget these plain words, and after the general election of 1780, the prime minister, Lord North, and his followers declined to support the re-election of the retiring Speaker, alleging that his health was not equal to the duties of the office, and he was defeated when the voting took place. In 1782 he was made a peer as Baron Grantley of Markenfield in the County of York.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1776.

==Death==
He died in 1789 at his London home in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields and was buried at Wonersh, Surrey. In 1741 he had married Grace, the daughter and heiress of Sir William Chapple, Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, 1737–1745. They had 5 sons and 2 daughters. He was succeeded as Baron Grantley by his eldest son William (1742–1822).

Nathaniel William Wraxall described Norton as a bold, able and eloquent, but not a popular pleader, and as Speaker he was aggressive and indiscreet. Derided by satirists as &quot;Sir Bullface Doublefee,&quot; and described by Horace Walpole as one who rose from obscure infamy to that infamous fame which will long stick to him, his character was also assailed by &quot;Junius&quot;.

==Family==
Grantley married Grace Chapple, daughter and heir of Sir William Chapple, Justice of the King&#x27;s bench, on 21 May 1741. They had four sons and a daughter:
*William Norton, 2nd Baron Grantley (1742–1822)
*Hon. Fletcher Norton MP FRSE (1744–1820); father of Hon. Charles Francis Norton and Hon. George Chapple Norton
*Hon. Chapple Norton (1746–1818) 
*Hon. Edward Norton (1750–1786)
*Hon. Grace Norton (1752–1813), married John Wallop, 3rd Earl of Portsmouth

<doc id="1307682" wikidata="Q910912" url="?curid=1307682" title="Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)">
<text>&quot;Paranoid&quot; is a song by English rock band Black Sabbath, released in 1970 off the band&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Paranoid&quot; (1970). It is the first single from the album, while the B-side is the song &quot;The Wizard&quot;. The song is widely regarded as one of the greatest heavy metal songs of all time. It reached number 4 on the UK singles chart and number 61 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Song information==
&quot;Paranoid&quot; was the first Black Sabbath single release, coming six months after their self-titled debut was released. Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler (from &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine, March 2004):

The song is an E minor pentatonic and only uses power chords. The guitar solo is a dry signal on the left channel, which is patched through a ring modulator and routed to the right channel; this effect was used again on the 1978 song, &quot;Johnny Blade&quot;.

According to extant lyric sheets, &quot;Paranoid&quot; was at one time titled &quot;The Paranoid.&quot;

&quot;Paranoid&quot; eventually became the name of the album, and somewhat unusually, the word &quot;paranoid&quot; is never mentioned in the lyrics. Originally, the band had wanted to call the album &quot;War Pigs&quot; after the song of the same name, but the record company persuaded them to use &quot;Paranoid&quot; instead because it was less offensive.

&quot;Paranoid&quot; drew controversy for apparently encouraging suicide, much like the song &quot;Suicide Solution&quot;. Particularly, the lyric &quot;I tell you to enjoy life&quot; was misheard as &quot;I tell you to end your life&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; described the song as being &quot;as dense, musically as &#x27;Whole Lotta Love,&#x27;&quot; stating that &quot;crashing, non-stop beat with gobs of bass and drums laced liberally with stinging, echoey vocals and hot guitar licks move the song along at a blistering pace.&quot;

&quot;Paranoid&quot; was ranked No. 34 on VH1&#x27;s 40 Greatest Metal Songs. In March 2005, &quot;Q&quot; magazine placed it at number 11 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 250 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time and 13th on their 2023 list &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Songs of All Time.&quot; &quot;Paranoid&quot; was ranked the fifth best Black Sabbath song by Rock – Das Gesamtwerk der größten Rock-Acts im Check. In 2020, &quot;Kerrang&quot; ranked the song number five on their list of the 20 greatest Black Sabbath songs, and in 2021, &quot;Louder Sound&quot; ranked the song number six on their list of the 40 greatest Black Sabbath songs.

==Legacy==
*In 1971, German schlager vocal duo Cindy &amp; Bert covered the song with lyrics based on Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; as &quot;Der Hund von Baskerville&quot;. The unlikely cover version with a heavy hammond organ, featured in a TV show with a tiny Pekingese dog standing in as &quot;hound&quot; and dancers getting ushered back to their seats, has become a collector&#x27;s curiosity and a document of 1971 zeitgeist. 
*American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold covered the song for both &quot;Diamonds in the Rough&quot; and &quot;Covered, A Revolution in Sound&quot;.
*American punk rock group the Dickies covered the song for their debut album &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Dickies&quot; (1979). Released as single, it charted at #45 in the UK.
*The song was covered by the goth metal band Type O Negative on their album &quot;The Origin of the Feces&quot; as a bonus track on the 1994 Remastered Edition.
*The song was covered by industrial rock group the Clay People for the various artists compilation album &quot;Shut Up Kitty&quot;, released in 1993.
*Soft Cell covered &quot;Paranoid&quot; on early live shows, before releasing their debut album; a demo recording of the cover was released on the compilation album &quot;The Bedsit Tapes&quot; in 2005.
*A live version by Doctor and the Medics was included on the 12&quot; of their single &quot;Burn&quot;, in 1986.
*Skrewdriver covered the song for their &quot;The Strong Survive&quot; album in 1990.
*Thrash metal band Megadeth covered the song for the 1994 rendition of &quot;Nativity in Black: A Tribute to Black Sabbath&quot;. The cover also appeared on the &quot;Hidden Treasures&quot; EP released in 1995.
*Weezer included a cover of the song on their covers album &quot;The Teal Album&quot;, which was released in 2019.
*The original Black Sabbath recording has been used numerous times in various films and television shows including &quot;Sid &amp; Nancy&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;The Stoned Age&quot;, &quot;Any Given Sunday&quot;, &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;, &quot;The Angry Birds Movie&quot;, &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;CHiPs&quot;. The song was used in the video games &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Racing&quot;, &quot;Guitar Hero 3&quot;, &quot;Madden NFL 10&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K17&quot;, and &quot;Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX 2&quot;.

==Popular culture==
*In Finland, &quot;Paranoid&quot; has the same status as Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Free Bird&quot; in the United States as a song the audience finds humorous to request during a concert. So regardless of a band or the style of music in question, somebody may shout &quot;Soittakaa &#x27;Paranoid&#x27;!&quot; (&quot;Play &#x27;Paranoid&#x27;!&quot;) during a gig.

<doc id="1307690" wikidata="Q4729944" url="?curid=1307690" title="All fifths tuning">
<text>Among guitar tunings, all-fifths tuning refers to the set of tunings in which each interval between consecutive open strings is a perfect fifth. All-fifths tuning is also called fifths, perfect fifths, or mandoguitar. The conventional &quot;standard tuning&quot; consists of perfect fourths and a single major third between the &quot;g&quot; and &quot;b&quot; strings:
:E-A-d-g-b-e&#x27;
All-fifths tuning has the set of open strings
:C-G-d-a-e&#x27;-b&#x27; or G&#x27;-D-A-e-b-f&#x27;,
which have intervals of 3 octaves minus a half-step between the lowest and highest string. The conventional tuning has an interval of 2 octaves between lowest and highest string.

All-fifths tuning is a tuning in intervals of perfect fifths like that of a mandolin or a violin. It has a wide range. It was used by jazz guitarist Carl Kress in the form
: B&#x27;-F-c-g-d&#x27;-a&#x27;.

==An approximation: new standard tuning==
All-fifths tuning has been approximated with tunings that avoid the high b&#x27; replacing it with a g&#x27; in the New Standard Tuning of King Crimson&#x27;s Robert Fripp, which has been taught in Guitar Craft courses. Guitar Craft, which has been succeeded by Guitar Circle, has taught Fripp&#x27;s tuning to 3,000 students.

==An approximation: through the looking glass guitar==
All-fifths tuning has been approximated with tunings in the Through The Looking Glass Guitar of Kei Nakano, which has been played by him since 2015.
This new tuning is like a mirror to all kinds of string instruments including guitar.
Also it can adapt to any other tunings of guitar.
If tuned to normal guitar for the right handed person, it is able to use for lefty guitar in general, and vice versa.

==An approximation: fifths with a unison pair for standard string sets ==

This tuning combines the wide 5th intervals with the possibility of close intervals that allows the pair of unison 3rd and 2nd strings (A). When playing in unison, this tuning also allow a chorus-like effect similar to the sound that the unison produces in 12 string guitars, but in a much smaller scale. 

It was developed to be used with a standard set of strings, for example a hybrid set of 0.9 strings, and without lowering too much the range of the electric guitar. It has a range that starts from two tones lower than the standard E tuning (C2 instead of E2) for the 6th string, but the 1st string is tuned to the same note (E4). It also shares the 4th string tuning (D3) with the E standard tuning.

C-G-D-A-A-E

==Relation with all-fourths tuning==

All-fifths tuning is closely related to all-fourths tuning. All-fifths tuning is based on the perfect fifth (the interval with seven semitones), and all-fourths tuning is based on the perfect fourth (five semitones). The perfect-fifth and perfect-fourth intervals are inversions of one another, and the chords of all-fourth and all-fifths are paired as inverted chords. Consequently, chord charts for all-fourths tunings may be used for left-handed all-fifths tuning.

<doc id="1307696" wikidata="Q823288" url="?curid=1307696" title="Working capital">
<text>Working capital (WC) is a financial metric which represents operating liquidity available to a business, organisation, or other entity, including governmental entities. Along with fixed assets such as plant and equipment, working capital is considered a part of operating capital. Gross working capital is equal to current assets. Working capital is calculated as current assets minus current liabilities. If current assets are less than current liabilities, an entity has a working capital deficiency, also called a working capital deficit and negative working capital.

A company can be endowed with assets and profitability but may fall short of liquidity if its assets cannot be readily converted into cash. Positive working capital is required to ensure that a firm is able to continue its operations and that it has sufficient funds to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming operational expenses. The management of working capital involves managing inventories, accounts receivable and payable, and cash.

==Calculation==
Working capital is the difference between current assets and current liabilities. It is not to be confused with trade working capital (the latter excludes cash).

The basic calculation of working capital is based on the entity&#x27;s gross current assets. 

formula_1

===Inputs===
Current assets and current liabilities include four accounts which are of special importance. These accounts represent the areas of the business where managers have the most direct impact:
*cash and cash equivalents (current asset)
*accounts receivable (current asset) 
*inventory (current asset), and 
*accounts payable (current liability)

The current portion of debt (payable within 12 months) is critical because it represents a short-term claim to current assets and is often secured by long-term assets. Common types of short-term debt are bank loans and lines of credit.

An increase in net working capital indicates that the business has either increased current assets (that it has increased its receivables or other current assets) or has decreased current liabilities—for example has paid off some short-term creditors, or a combination of both.

==Working capital cycle==
===Definition===
The working capital cycle (WCC), also known as the cash conversion cycle, is the amount of time it takes to turn the net current assets and current liabilities into cash. The longer this cycle, the longer a business is tying up capital in its working capital without earning a return on it. Companies strive to reduce their working capital cycle by collecting receivables quicker or sometimes stretching accounts payable. Under certain conditions, minimizing working capital might adversely affect the company&#x27;s ability to realize profitability, e.g. when unforeseen hikes in demand exceed inventories, or when a shortfall in cash restricts the company&#x27;s ability to acquire trade or production inputs.

===Meaning===
A positive working capital cycle balances incoming and outgoing payments to minimize net working capital and maximize free cash flow. For example, a company that pays its financing is a carrying cost tinexpensive way to grow. Sophisticated buyers review closely a target&#x27;s working capital cycle because it provides them with an idea of the management&#x27;s effectiveness at managing their balance sheet and generating free cash flows.

As an absolute rule of funders, each of them wants to see a positive working capital because positive working capital implies there are sufficient current assets to meet current obligations. In contrast, companies risk being unable to meet current obligations with current assets when working capital is negative. While it is theoretically possible for a company to indefinitely show negative working capital on regularly reported balance sheets (since working capital may actually be positive between reporting periods), working capital will generally need to be non-negative for the business to be sustainable

Reasons why a business may show negative or low working capital over the long term while not indicating financial distress include:

* Assets above or liabilities below their true economic value
* Accrual basis accounting creating deferred revenue while the cost of goods sold is lower than the revenue to be generated
** E.g. a software as a service business or newspaper receives cash from customers early on, but has to include the cash as a deferred revenue liability until the service is delivered. The cost of delivering the service or newspaper is usually lower than revenue thus, when the revenue is recognized, the business will generate gross income.

==Working capital management==
Decisions relating to working capital and short-term financing are referred to as &quot;working capital management&quot;. These involve managing the relationship between a firm&#x27;s short-term assets and its short-term liabilities. The goal of working capital management is to ensure that the firm is able to continue its operations and that it has sufficient cash flow to satisfy both maturing short-term debt and upcoming operational expenses.

A managerial accounting strategy focusing on maintaining efficient levels of both components of working capital, current assets, and current liabilities, in respect to each other. Working capital management ensures a company has sufficient cash flow in order to meet its short-term debt obligations and operating expenses.

===Decision criteria===
By definition, working capital management entails short-term decisions—generally, relating to the next one-year period—which are &quot;reversible&quot;. These decisions are therefore not taken on the same basis as long term capital-investment decisions (NPV or related); rather, they will be based on cash flows, or profitability, or both.

*One measure of cash flow is provided by the cash conversion cycle—the net number of days from the outlay of cash for raw material to receiving payment from the customer. As a management tool, this metric makes explicit the inter-relatedness of decisions relating to inventories, accounts receivable and payable, and cash. Because this number effectively corresponds to the time that the firm&#x27;s cash is tied up in operations and unavailable for other activities, management generally aims at a low net count.
*In this context, the most useful measure of profitability is return on capital (ROC). The result is shown as a percentage, determined by dividing relevant income for the 12 months by capital employed; return on equity (ROE) shows this result for the firm&#x27;s shareholders. Firm value is enhanced when, and if, the return on capital, which results from working-capital management, exceeds the cost of capital, which results from capital investment decisions as above. ROC measures are therefore useful as a management tool, in that they link short-term policy with long-term decision making. See economic value added (EVA).
*Credit policy of the firm: Another factor affecting working capital management is credit policy of the firm. It includes buying of raw material and selling of finished goods either in cash or on credit. This affects the cash conversion cycle.

===Management of working capital===
Guided by the above criteria, management will use a combination of policies and techniques for the management of working capital. The policies aim at managing the &quot;current assets&quot; (generally cash and cash equivalents, inventories and debtors) and the short-term financing, such that cash flows and returns are acceptable.

*Cash management. Identify the cash balance which allows for the business to meet day to day expenses, but reduces cash holding costs.
*Inventory management. Identify the level of inventory which allows for uninterrupted production but reduces the investment in raw materials—and minimizes reordering costs—and hence increases cash flow. Besides this, the lead times in production should be lowered to reduce Work in Process (WIP) and similarly, the Finished Goods should be kept on as low level as possible to avoid overproduction—see Supply chain management; Just In Time (JIT); Economic order quantity (EOQ); Economic quantity 
*Debtors management. Identify the appropriate credit policy, i.e. credit terms which will attract customers, such that any impact on cash flows and the cash conversion cycle will be offset by increased revenue and hence Return on Capital (or &quot;vice versa&quot;); see Discounts and allowances.
*Short-term financing. Identify the appropriate source of financing, given the cash conversion cycle: the inventory is ideally financed by credit granted by the supplier; however, it may be necessary to utilize a bank loan (or overdraft), or to &quot;convert debtors to cash&quot; through &quot;factoring&quot;.

<text>Sir Nathaniel William Wraxall, 1st Baronet (8 April 1751 – 7 November 1831) was an English author and politician.

==Life==
He was born in Queen Square, Bristol, the son of a Bristol merchant, Nathaniel Wraxall, and his wife Anne, great-niece of Sir James Thornhill, the painter. He entered the employment of the East India Company in 1769, and served as judge-advocate and paymaster during the expeditions against Gujarat and Bharuch in 1771. In the following year he left the service of the company and returned to Europe.

He visited Portugal and was presented to the court, of which he gives a curious account in his &quot;Historical Memoirs&quot;. In the north of Europe he made the acquaintance of several Danish nobles who had been exiled for their support of the deposed Queen Caroline Matilda, sister of George III. Among them were notably Baron Frederik Ludvig Ernst Bülow (spouse of Anna Sofie Bülow), and Count Ernst Schimmelmann (son of Caroline von Schimmelmann).

Wraxall at their suggestion undertook to endeavour to persuade the king to act on her behalf. He was able to secure an interview with her at Celle Castle in September 1774. His exertions are told in his Posthumous Memoirs. As the queen died on 11 May 1775, his schemes came to nothing and he complained that he was out-of-pocket, but George III took no notice of him for some time. In 1775 he published his first book, &quot;Cursory Remarks made in a Tour through some of the Northern Parts of Europe&quot;, which reached its fourth edition by 1807, when it was renamed &quot;A Tour Round the Baltic&quot;. In 1777 he travelled again in Germany and Italy. As he had by this time secured the patronage of important people, he obtained a complimentary lieutenant&#x27;s commission from the king on the application of Lord Robert Manners, which gave him the right to wear uniform though he never performed any military service. He published his &quot;Memoirs of the Kings of France of the Race of Valois&quot;, to which he appended an account of his tour in the Western, Southern and Interior Provinces of France. In 1778 he went again on his travels to Germany and Italy, and accumulated materials for his &quot;Memoirs of the Courts of Berlin, Dresden, Warsaw and Vienna&quot; (1799).

In 1780, Wraxall entered Parliament in the Tory interest, and served as a Member for years. He was first elected from Hindon in Wiltshire. On 3 April 1784, he was elected from Ludgershall. He was still a supporter of Pitt when he was elected for Wallingford on 16 June 1790. He was defeated at a by-election in March 1794 by Francis Sykes.

Wraxall then immediately began work on his French history in order to publish it the following year. He completed the beginning of a &quot;History of France from the Accession of Henry III to the Death of Louis XIV&quot;, but it was never completed.

Little is known of his later years except that he was made a baronet by the Prince Regent on 21 December 1813. His &quot;Historical Memoirs&quot; appeared in 1815, when he subsequently removed to Wraxall House, Charlton Kings, near Cheltenham. Both they and the &quot;Posthumous Memoirs&quot; (1836) are very readable and have real historical value. Wraxall believed that the government of the day, furious at his truthfulness, was behind a libel action which sent him to prison for three months in 1816. Hence the posthumous publication of the later memoirs. He died suddenly at Dover on 7 November 1831, while travelling to Naples.

==Family==
Wraxall married Miss Jane Lascelles, daughter of Peter Lascelles, in 1789. He was survived by two sons, Lieutenant-colonel William Lascelles Wraxall, second baronet (1791–1863), and Lt. Charles Edward Wraxall RA (1792–1854), the father of Sir Frederic Charles Lascelles Wraxall (1828–1865), who was a miscellaneous writer.

<doc id="1307728" wikidata="Q581804" url="?curid=1307728" title="Farnese Bull">
<text>The Farnese Bull (), formerly in the Farnese collection in Rome, is a massive Roman elaborated copy of a Hellenistic sculpture. It is the largest single sculpture yet recovered from antiquity. Along with the rest of the Farnese antiquities, it has been since 1826 in the collection of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale Napoli in Naples, inv. no. 6002, though in recent years sometimes displayed at the Museo di Capodimonte across the city. The sculpture in Naples is much restored, and includes around the base a child, a dog, and other animals not apparently in the original composition, which is known from versions in other media.

Pliny the Elder mentions what was presumably the prime version of it as the work of the Rhodian artists Apollonius of Tralles and his brother Tauriscus, stating that it was commissioned at the end of the 2nd century BC and carved from just one whole block of marble. It was imported from Rhodes as part of the remarkable collection of artwork and sculpture owned by Asinius Pollio, a Roman politician who lived during the years between the Republic and the Principate. 

This colossal marble sculptural group represents the myth of Dirce, first wife of Lykos, King of Thebes. She was tied to a wild bull by Amphion and Zethus, the sons of Antiope, who wanted to punish Dirce for the ill-treatment inflicted on their mother.

==Rediscovery and reconstruction==

The group was unearthed in 1546 during excavations at gymnasium of the Roman Baths of Caracalla, commissioned by Pope Paul III in the hope of finding ancient sculptures to adorn the Palazzo Farnese, the Farnese family&#x27;s palatial residence in Rome. This sculpture is dated to the Severian period (A.D. 222-235).

Unlike the discoveries of the Farnese Hercules and the Latin Hercules from this excavation, which were documented as to their location, the only reference to this grouping is from a 1595 engraving by Etienne du Perac of the ruins of the Baths, showing the end of the east palestra, which states: &quot;...in the time of Paul III many beautiful fragments of statues and animals were found that were all in one piece in antiquity ... and Cardinal Farnese had [it] erected now in his Palazzo.&quot;

The group underwent a substantial restoration in the 16th century, when Michelangelo planned to use it for a fountain to be installed at the centre of a garden between Palazzo Farnese and the Villa Farnesina. It also could have been adapted for this use soon after it was found, which is supported by descriptions from the Renaissance era. Further restorations were made in the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1883, the original sculpture was noted by Domenico Monaco, curator of the (then) National Museum in Naples, to have been carved from a block of marble measuring 3.66 m × 2.75 m (&quot;12 ft by 9 ft.&quot;); after its restorations, the work&#x27;s perimeter is approximately 3.3 m (10&#x27;10&quot;) on each side and over 4 m (13&#x27;) high. As it is today, the sculpture weighs 21.8 tonnes (24 short tons).

It has been argued that the sculpture noted by Pliny in his &quot;Natural History&quot; could not be the Farnese Bull, which is instead a 3rd-century AD Roman version, made specifically for Caracalla&#x27;s Baths. Other scholars dispute this, arguing that since the work was originally located in the nearby &quot;Horti Asiniani&quot;, or Asiniani gardens, which the Pollio family owned, to have commissioned a copy specifically for the Baths would have meant both pieces would have been displayed in very close proximity. 

It is shown in the 1954 film &quot;Journey to Italy&quot; along with the Farnese Hercules. Henry Peacham, in &quot;The Compleat Gentleman&quot;, says that it &quot;out-strippeth all other Statues in the world for greatnesse and workemanship&quot;.

<doc id="1307738" wikidata="Q6382935" url="?curid=1307738" title="Keep America Beautiful">
<text>Keep America Beautiful is a nonprofit organization founded in 1953. It is the largest community improvement organization in the United States, with more than 700 state and community-based affiliate organizations and more than 1,000 partner organizations.

Keep America Beautiful aims to end littering, to improve recycling, and to beautify American communities. The organization&#x27;s narrow focus on littering and recycling has been criticized as greenwashing in that it diverts responsibility away from corporations and industries.

==History==
Keep America Beautiful was founded in December 1953 by the American Can Company and the Owens-Illinois Glass Company.

Keep America Beautiful conducted many local PSA campaigns early in its history. One of these early campaigns in Pennsylvania (PennDOT) some attribute to having coined the term &quot;,&quot; although the National Council of State Garden Clubs representative exhibited a &quot;litter bug&quot; emblem at the first Keep America Beautiful organizational meeting. Author and Federated Garden Clubs of Maryland president Alice Rush McKeon published &quot;The Litterbug Family&quot; in 1931 containing poems and illustrations about the problem of roadside litter.

Keep America Beautiful joined with the Ad Council in 1961 to popularize the idea that individuals must help protect against the effects litter has on the environment. Gioni came up with the 1963 television campaign theme &quot;Every Litter Bit Hurts.&quot; Another campaign in 1964 featured the character Susan Spotless.

In 1970, Keep America Beautiful began distributing free brochures. More than 100,000 copies of the brochure were requested within four months.

In 1971, on Earth Day, a new campaign was launched with the theme &quot;People Start Pollution. People Can Stop It.&quot; In what later became known as the &quot;Crying Indian&quot; PSA, the television ad, narrated by actor William Conrad with Peter Sarstedt&#x27;s instrumental &quot;Overture&quot; playing in the background, featured Italian-American actor Iron Eyes Cody, who portrayed a Native American man devastated to see the destruction of Earth&#x27;s natural beauty caused by the thoughtless pollution and litter of a modern society.

In 1976, Keep America Beautiful introduced its &quot;Clean Community System&quot;, which encouraged local communities to prevent litter through education efforts, public service advertising, local research, the mapping of litter &quot;hotspots&quot;, and cleanup activities. During the height of the campaign, it received over 2,000 letters a month from people wanting to join their local programs.

In 2023, Keep America Beautiful began its &quot;Do Beautiful Things&quot; podcast series hosted by Jenny Lawson, the organization&#x27;s president and CEO. It covers policies, behaviors, and business solutions that can help create more sustainable communities. By featuring expert interviews and discussions it aims to educate and provide practical sustainability tips. 

==Accomplishments==
Keep America Beautiful is best known for its &quot;Crying Indian&quot; public service advertisement (PSA) which launched on Earth Day in 1971 and for its annual America Recycles Day. 

In 2021, Keep America Beautiful released a comprehensive litter study. Its study concluded that 90% of Americans agree litter is a problem in their community, roadside litter is down 54% in the last ten years and there are approximately 50 billion pieces of litter on the ground in the United States. In concert with the study&#x27;s release, Keep America Beautiful launched their hashtag #152AndYou on Earth Day representing that if all individuals picked up 152 pieces of litter, there would be no litter on the ground until someone littered again.

==Programs==
===Partnership with other organizations===
Keep America Beautiful distributes programming and materials through a network of organizations. In addition to KAB&#x27;s certified affiliates, the organization partners with other groups to expand its reach. These include multiple state recycling organizations, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, Hands on Network and the Points of Light Institute, the Arbor Day Foundation, Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, National CleanUp Day, Ocean Conservancy, Sustainable Urban Forests Coalition, EARTHDAY.ORG, and Take Pride in America, among others.

Scouting Keep America Beautiful Day was first cosponsored by Keep America Beautiful and the Boy Scouts of America in 1971 as a national cleanup and recycling program. Keep America Beautiful also co-sponsors the &quot;Keep America Beautiful Hometown USA Award&quot; with the Boy Scouts of America that boy scouts can earn by completing a non-paid, community service project, with the approved scout project being designed to &quot;help keep America beautiful and benefit the community either physically or financially.&quot;

In January, 2021, Keep America Beautiful merged with RETREET, which focuses on post-disaster tree planting.

==Controversies==

Keep America Beautiful&#x27;s actions have been criticized as greenwashing. The organization&#x27;s narrow focus on littering and recycling diverts responsibility away from corporations and industries.

Despite self-identifying as having Native American ancestry with the stage name of Iron Eyes Cody, Espera Oscar DeCorti was of Italian descent. This sparked accusations of cultural appropriation and racial stereotyping. In February 2023, the Keep America Beautiful organization transferred ownership of the ad&#x27;s copyright to the National Congress of American Indians, who intend to restrict use of the ad to only historical purposes.

Heather Rogers, creator of the 2005 documentary film &quot;Gone Tomorrow. The Hidden Life of Garbage&quot; and book of the same name, classifies Keep America Beautiful as one of the first greenwashing corporate fronts. She asserts that the group was created in response to Vermont&#x27;s 1953 attempt to legislate a mandatory deposit to be paid at point of purchase on disposable beverage containers and banning the sale of beer in non-refillable bottles.

Keep America Beautiful&#x27;s narrow focus on litter, and its characterization of litter as a consumer created problem, is seen as an attempt to divert an extended producer responsibility from the industries that manufacture and sell disposable products to consumers who improperly dispose of the non-returnable wrappers, filters, and beverage containers.

Elizabeth Royte, author of &quot;Garbage Land&quot;, describes Keep America Beautiful as a &quot;masterful example of corporate greenwash&quot;, writing that in contrast to its anti-litter campaigns, it ignores the potential of recycling legislation and resists changes to packaging.

The tobacco industry developed programs with Keep America Beautiful that focused on cigarette litter solutions acceptable to the industry such as volunteer clean-ups and ashtrays, in lieu of smoking bans at parks and beaches. The tobacco industry has funded Keep America Beautiful and similar organizations internationally.

<text>The Subaltern Studies Group (SSG) or Subaltern Studies Collective is a group of South Asian scholars interested in postcolonial and post-imperial societies. The term &quot;Subaltern Studies&quot; is sometimes also applied more broadly to others who share many of their views and they are often considered to be &quot;exemplary of postcolonial studies&quot; and as one of the most influential movements in the field. Their anti-essentialist approach is one of history from below, focused more on what happens among the masses at the base levels of society than among the elite.

==Definition==

The term &quot;subaltern&quot; in this context is an allusion to the work of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci (1891–1937). The term&#x27;s semantic range has evolved from its first usage by Ranajit Guha, following Gramsci, to refer solely to peasants who had not been integrated into the industrial capitalist system. It now refers to any person or group of inferior rank or station, whether because of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or religion.

The SSG arose in the 1980s, influenced by the scholarship of Eric Stokes and Ranajit Guha, to attempt to formulate a new narrative of the history of India and South Asia. The group started at the University of Sussex, then continued and traveled, mainly through Guha&#x27;s students. This narrative strategy was inspired by the writings of Gramsci was explicated in the writings of their mentor Ranajit Guha, most clearly in his &quot;manifesto&quot; in Subaltern Studies I and also in his classic monograph &quot;The Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency&quot;. Although they are, in a sense, on the left, they are very critical of the traditional Marxist narrative of Indian history, in which semi-feudal India was colonized by the British, became politicized, and earned its independence. In particular, they are critical of the focus of this narrative on the political consciousness of elites, who in turn inspire the masses to resistance and rebellion against the British.

Instead, they focus on non-elites, subalterns, as agents of political and social change. They have had a particular interest in the discourses and rhetoric of emerging political and social movements, as against only highly visible actions like demonstrations and uprisings.

==Criticism==
One of the group&#x27;s early contributors, Sumit Sarkar, later began to critique it. He entitled one of his essays &quot;Decline of the Subaltern in Subaltern Studies&quot;, criticizing the turn to Foucauldian studies of power-knowledge that left behind many of the empiricist and Marxist efforts of the first two volumes of &quot;Subaltern Studies&quot;. He writes that the socialist inspiration behind the early volumes led to a greater impact in India itself, while the later volumes&#x27; focus on western discourse reified the subaltern-colonizer divide and then rose in prominence mainly in western academia. Even Gayatri Spivak, one of the most prominent names associated with the movement, has called herself a critic of &quot;metropolitan post-colonialism&quot;.

American sociologist Vivek Chibber has criticized the premise of Subaltern Studies for its obfuscation of class struggle and class formation in its analysis and accused it of excising class exploitation from the story of the oppression of the subaltern. His critique, explained in his book &quot;Postcolonial Theory and the Specter of Capital&quot;, is focused on the works of two Indian scholars: Ranajit Guha and Dipesh Chakrabarty. According to Chibber, subaltern scholars tend to recreate the Orient as a place where cultural differences negate analyses based on Western experience.

<text>Lancaster House (originally known as York House and then Stafford House) is a mansion on The Mall in the St James&#x27;s district in the West End of London. Adjacent to The Green Park, it is next to Clarence House and St James&#x27;s Palace, as much of the site was once part of the palace grounds. Initially planned for Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, it was ultimately completed by the Duke of Sutherland, then Marquess of Stafford, as an aristocratic townhouse in the early 19th century, and known for its lavish interiors. Gifted to the government in the early 20th century, it houses the government&#x27;s wine cellars and was home to the London Museum until World War II. Now used for diplomatic receptions and related functions by the Foreign Office, it is a historic Grade I listed building, and its interiors are sometimes used in films or television as a stand in for Buckingham Palace.

==History==
Construction of the house commenced in 1825 for the Duke of York and Albany, the second son of King George III, and it was initially known as York House. Sir Robert Smirke was originally hired to design the house, until under the influence of the Duke&#x27;s mistress the Duchess of Rutland, he was replaced by Benjamin Dean Wyatt who mainly designed the exterior. The house was only a shell by the time of the death of the Duke in 1827. It is constructed from Bath stone, in a neo-classical style. The lease of the house was purchased by the 2nd Marquess of Stafford (later 1st Duke of Sutherland) and was under his direction that it was completed in 1838. It was known as Stafford House for almost a century.

The completed building was three floors in height, the State rooms being on the first floor or &quot;piano nobile&quot;, family living rooms on the ground floor and family bedrooms on the second floor. There was also a basement containing service rooms and wine cellar. The interior, featured an imperial staircase which was designed by Sir Charles Barry, as well Louis XIV Style rooms which were lavishly decorated.

The Sutherlands’ liberal politics and love of the arts attracted many distinguished guests, including factory reformer the Earl of Shaftesbury, anti-slavery author Harriet Beecher Stowe and Italian revolutionary leader Giuseppe Garibaldi. Chopin gave a recital there in 1848 in the presence of Queen Victoria.

Queen Victoria is said to have remarked to the 2nd Duchess of Sutherland on arriving at Stafford House, &quot;I have come from my House to your Palace.&quot; With its ornate decoration and the dramatic sweep of the great staircase, the Grand Hall is a magnificent introduction to one of the finest town houses in London. In 1877 the House became the eponymous home of the Stafford House Committee for the Relief of Sick and Wounded Turkish Soldiers, formed by the 3rd Duke to aid Ottoman refugees and wounded during the Russo-Turkish War.

The house went out of royal favour after the 3rd Duchess died, in 1888 and her husband married his mistress within months. In 1912 the lease was purchased by the Lancastrian industrialist and philanthropist Sir William Lever, 1st Baronet (later 1st Viscount Leverhulme) who renamed it in honour of his native county of Lancashire and presented it to the nation in the following year.

Since 1922 the building has housed the Government Wine Cellar, and, from 1924 until shortly after the Second World War, the house was the home of the London Museum.

The allied government&#x27;s European Advisory Commission on the political and social future of Europe after the Second World War met here throughout 1944 and into 1945. In January 1947 a special envoy meeting on affairs concerning occupied Austria was hosted here. The year 1956, the house saw the signing of the agreement of independence for Malaya. In 1961, South Africa affirmed its intention to become a republic, inside the Commonwealth. In 1979 it was the scene of the Lancaster House Agreement, which led to the independence of Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, from the United Kingdom.

The house was the venue for the 10th G7 summit in 1984 and the 17th G7 summit in 1991. A new 35-foot-long table was built for the Long Gallery, where the main negotiating sessions were planned in 1991.

Prime Minister Theresa May gave a speech at Lancaster House in January 2017 outlining Britain&#x27;s intended future relationship with the European Union following the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum which resulted in a vote to leave. The speech is commonly referred to in the media, and in political discourse, as the &quot;Lancaster House speech&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Winston Churchill commented that towards the end of the 19th century, &quot;glittering parties at Lansdowne House, Devonshire House or Stafford House (Lancaster House) comprised all the elements which made a gay and splendid social circle in close relation to the business of Parliament, the hierarchies of the Army and Navy, and the policy of the State&quot;.

Lancaster House has been extensively used as a filming location. It has stood in for Buckingham Palace at least six times in film and television: for the comedy film &quot;King Ralph&quot; (1991), the mystery adventure film &quot;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&quot; (2007), the historical drama film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot; (2009), the historical drama film &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010), and the 2013 Christmas special for &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, when Rose is presented to the King and Queen during the London Season. Lancaster House reprised its role as Buckingham Palace for the Netflix series &quot;The Crown&quot;. The interior was used to represent the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg for the 1981 film &quot;Reds&quot;. It also appears as the house of Lady Bracknell in the comedy of manners film &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (2002), and as the site of a masquerade ball in the Merchant-Ivory film &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (2000).

<text>Alexander Henry Green FRS (10 October 183219 August 1896) was an English geologist.

==Life==
Green was born at Maidstone on 10 October 1832, was the eldest son of Thomas Sheldon Green, head-master of the Ashby Grammar School at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, who had married Miss Derington of Hinckley in Leicestershire. After passing through his father&#x27;s school he went to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he was admitted pensioner on 25 June 1851, and graduated as sixth wrangler in 1855. Elected a fellow of his college in the same year, he proceeded M.A. in 1858, and resided until 1861.

He obtained an appointment on the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1861. 
Here he worked at first on the Jurassic and cretaceous rocks of the midland counties, passing on from them to the carboniferous deposits of Derbyshire, Yorkshire, and the northern counties. 
In 1874 he left the survey to become professor of geology in the Yorkshire College at Leeds, and wrote a well-received manual of &quot;Physical Geology&quot; in 1876. He also undertook, in 1885, the duties of the chair of mathematics, and was for a time lecturer on geology at the school of military engineering, Chatham. In 1888 he was appointed to the professorship of geology at Oxford in succession to Sir Joseph Prestwich, and received from that university the honorary degree of M.A.
Green became a Fellow of the Geological Society in 1862, and received the Murchison Medal in 1892. In the latter year he was elected honorary fellow of Gonville and Caius College. In 1886, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1890 was president of the section of geology at the Leeds meeting of the British Association. His strength in this science lay in field work and in certain departments of physical geology where his mathematical knowledge was especially helpful. As a teacher and writer he was remarkably clear. In addition to the duties of his chair he undertook much examining and consulting work; perhaps, indeed, excessive labour shortened his life, for he was most indefatigable and thorough in whatever he took in hand. 
In the summer of 1896, he had a paralytic stroke, and died on 19 August at his residence, Boars Hill, near Oxford.

==Family==
He was twice married: in 1866 to Miss Mary Marsden, from the neighbourhood of Sheffield, who died in 1882; and in 1883 to Miss W. M. Armstrong, a native of Clifton, who survived him. 
One son and two daughters were the issue of the first marriage, and a son and a daughter of the second, all of whom survived their father.

<text>Christopher Raymond Perry (December 4, 1761 – June 1, 1818) was an officer in the United States Navy who was appointed Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County, Rhode Island, in 1780 and served until 1791. He was the father of Oliver Hazard Perry and Matthew Calbraith Perry.

==Early life==
Perry was born on December 4, 1761, in Newport, Rhode Island, the son of the Hon. James Freeman Perry (1732–1813) and his wife, Mercy Hazard (1739–1810). Christopher&#x27;s father, Freeman, was a physician and surgeon.

Perry&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather, Edward Perry, came from Devon, England, in 1637 and settled in Sandwich, Massachusetts, where he married his wife, Mary Freeman, in 1653. On his mother&#x27;s side Perry was a seventh-generation descendant of Captain Richard Raymond (1602–1692), and his wife, Julia, who was likely born in Essex, England, in 1602 and arrived in Salem, Massachusetts, about 1629, possibly with a contingent led by the Rev. Francis Higginson. He was about 27 years old and later was a founder of Norwich, Connecticut, and an &quot;honored fore-father of Saybrook&quot;.

Perry&#x27;s mother was also a descendant of Governor Thomas Prence (1599–1673), a co-founder of Eastham, Massachusetts, who was a political leader in both the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies, and governor of Plymouth; and a descendant of two &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers, both of whom were signers of the Mayflower Compact, Elder William Brewster (c. 1567–1644), the Pilgrim colonist leader and spiritual elder of the Plymouth Colony, and George Soule (1593–1679). Christopher Perry was also descended from Soule through his paternal grandmother Susannah Barber Perry (1697–1755).

==American Revolution==
Christopher Perry enlisted, at the age of 14, in a local militia company named the Kingston Reds early in the American Revolution. He then served on a privateer commanded by a Captain Reed. After one cruise with Reed, Perry signed on to the privateer &quot;Mifflin&quot; commanded by George Wait Babcock. &quot;Mifflin&quot; was captured by the British and Perry was confined to the infamous prison ship &quot;Jersey&quot; in New York harbor for three months before he managed to escape.

In 1779, Perry joined the Continental Navy as a seaman aboard the frigate USS &quot;Trumbull&quot; commanded by Captain James Nicholson. On June 1, 1780, &quot;Trumbull&quot; engaged the British letter of marque &quot;Watt&quot; in a hard-fought, but indecisive, action in which &quot;Trumbull&quot; suffered 8 killed and 31 wounded compared to the &quot;Watt&quot;″s 13 killed and 79 wounded.

Perry then enlisted on another privateer which was captured off the coast of Great Britain. He then was taken as a prisoner to Newry Barracks in Ireland where he met his future wife, Sarah Wallace Alexander (1768–1830). Perry managed another escape by masquerading as a British seaman and taking passage to St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands. From St. Thomas he took passage to Charleston, South Carolina, shortly before the war&#x27;s conclusion in 1783.

===Post war===
After the war, Perry served as a mate on a merchantman which sailed to Ireland where Perry was able to bring his beloved Sarah to the United States. They were married in Philadelphia on August 2, 1784. The young couple then moved to South Kingstown, Rhode Island, where they lived with Perry&#x27;s parents on their 200-acre estate. Their first child, Oliver Hazard Perry, was born in August 1785.

Perry then pursued his career as a merchant captain, making voyages all over the world and amassing a small fortune in the process. He then decided to move his family to Newport, which was then an important shipping center and one of the largest cities in the newly independent United States. By 1797, Perry had achieved enough financial security that he was able to retire to the small coastal town of Westerly in the southwest corner of Rhode Island.

==Quasi War==
On January 7, 1798, during the Quasi War with France, Perry was commissioned a captain in the U.S. Navy. Perry commanded the frigate &quot;General Greene&quot;, on which his son, then 13-year-old Oliver Hazard Perry, served as a midshipman. &quot;General Greene&quot; was launched on January 21, 1799, departed on her first cruise on June 2, 1799, escorting five merchantmen to Havana, Cuba. In Havana a yellow fever epidemic struck the ship which forced her to return to Newport on July 27. &quot;General Greene&quot; departed on her next cruise to Santo Domingo on September 23. On December 1 she, along with the frigate USS &quot;Boston&quot; captured the schooner &quot;Flying Fish&quot; and recaptured the American schooner &quot;Weymouth&quot;. Among other duties &quot;General Green&quot; intercepted supplies to rebels fighting to overthrow General Toussaint Louverture who had led a successful slave revolt against the French in Haiti in 1791.

On April 27, &quot;General Greene&quot; brought two emissaries from Louverture to New Orleans where they went on to meet with President John Adams. She left New Orleans on May 10, escorting twelve merchantmen to Havana. As she neared Havana, a British 74 gun ship of the line intercepted the convoy and sent a boat towards one of the merchant ships so a boarding party could inspect the merchantman. Perry fired a shot across the bow of the boat, and the captain of the British warship brought his ship alongside the much smaller &quot;General Greene&quot;. When the British captain demanded to know why Perry had fired on the boat, and remarked that it was very strange that a British ship of the line could not board an American merchant ship, Perry replied, &quot;If she were a first rate ship (i.e. a ship mounting 100 guns), she should not do so to the dishonor of my flag!&quot; Apparently, the incident was resolved without further conflict.

&quot;General Greene&quot; returned to Newport on July 21, 1800, where most of her crew was discharged. Perry was given orders to maintain &quot;General Greene&quot; in a high state of readiness, should her services be needed. A Court of Enquiry was held on various lapses in obeying Orders and other conduct during the deployment. Following the enquiry President John Adams ordered Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddart to suspend Perry from the Service for 3 months without pay in a letter dated 28 November. Capt. Hugh G. Campbell was ordered to assume command of &quot;General Greene&quot; in a letter also dated 28 November) To his disappointment, Perry and &quot;General Greene&quot; were not given any other assignments during the Quasi War.

Perry, along with most of the other officers in the Navy, was discharged by the Peace Establishment Act of April 3, 1801, which greatly reduced both the Army and the Navy. In the Navy, only nine of 42 captains were allowed to remain in service.

==Personal life==
On August 2, 1784, Perry married Sarah Wallace Alexander (1768–1830) in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was born about 1768 in County Down, Ireland and died December 4, 1830, in New London, Connecticut. She was a descendant of an uncle of William Wallace, the Scottish knight and landowner who is known for leading a resistance during the Wars of Scottish Independence and is today remembered as a patriot and national hero.

Christopher and Sarah had five sons, all of whom were officers in the U.S. Navy who died in service, and three daughters:
* Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry (1785–1819), who married Elizabeth Champlin Mason in 1811.
* Lieutenant Raymond Henry Jones Perry (1789–1826), who married Mary Ann DeWolf (1795-1834). He served in the U.S. Navy from 1807 until his death.
* Sarah Wallace Perry (1791–1855), who never married.
* Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry (1794–1858), who married Jane Slidell Perry (1816–1864)
* Anna Maria Perry (1797–1858), who married Commodore George Washington Rodgers (1787–1832). 
* Jane Tweedy Perry (1799–1875), who married William Butler Jr. (1790–1850), a surgeon and United States Congressman, in 1819.
* Lieutenant James Alexander Perry (1801–1822), who served in the U.S. Navy from 1811 until his death. Served with his brother Oliver at the Battle of Lake Erie at the age of 12.
* Purser Nathaniel Hazard Perry (1803–1832), who served as a purser (i.e., a supply and pay officer) in the U.S. Navy from 1820 until his death.

In 1800, Perry became the owner of a large house at 31 Walnut Street in Newport which is today known as the Knowles-Perry House. It is probable that this was Perry&#x27;s primary residence for the remainder of his life.

Captain Perry died in Newport in 1818 and is buried in the Belmont-Perry plot in the Island Cemetery in Newport, Rhode Island. Aside from his wife, all those buried in the plot are either his descendants or their spouses.

===Descendants===

Captain Christopher Raymond Perry&#x27;s descendants number in the thousands today. Some of his notable descendants include:

His eldest son, Oliver Hazard Perry (1785–1819), hero of the Battle of Lake Erie. Matthew Calbraith Perry, commander of the Perry Expedition to Japan. Brevet Brigadier General Alexander James Perry (1828–1913) was a career Army officer who graduated from West Point and served during the American Civil War. The Right Reverend James De Wolf Perry (1871–1947) served as Episcopal Bishop of Rhode Island and Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church.

Captain Perry&#x27;s grandson, Rear Admiral Christopher Raymond Perry Rodgers (1819–1892) was an officer in the United States Navy who served in the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War, was Superintendent of the Naval Academy, and Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Squadron. Rear Admiral Raymond Perry Rodgers (1849–1925), son of C.R.P. Rodgers, was an officer in the United States Navy and the second head of the Office of Naval Intelligence. Raymond Perry Rodgers&#x27;s younger brother, Rear Admiral Thomas S. Rodgers (1858–1931), was an officer in the United States Navy who served in the Spanish–American War and World War I. Two other descendants of Captain Perry through his daughter Anna Maria Perry Rodgers were Calbraith Perry Rodgers (1879–1912), a pioneer American aviator who was the first civilian to purchase a Wright Flyer and the first to make a transcontinental flight, and Commander John Rodgers (1881–1926), an officer in the United States Navy and an early aviator.

Through his son Matthew&#x27;s daughter, Caroline Slidell (née Perry) Belmont, he was the great-grandfather of statesman Perry Belmont (1851–1947), who served as a United States Representative from New York and the United States Minister to Spain, and also served as an officer in the U.S. Army during both the Spanish–American War and World War I. August Belmont Jr. (1853–1924), was an American financier, the builder of New York&#x27;s Belmont Park racetrack, and a major owner/breeder of Thoroughbred racehorses. Oliver Hazard Perry Belmont (1858–1908) was a wealthy American socialite and United States Representative from New York; he was the second husband of Alva Vanderbilt Belmont.

Another of Captain Perry&#x27;s great-grandsons, William Tiffany (1868–1898), a 2nd lieutenant in the 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry (a.k.a. Roosevelt&#x27;s Rough Riders), died of yellow fever shortly after returning to the United States following his service in Cuba during the Spanish–American War. Matthew Calbraith Butler (1836–1909), son of Captain Perry&#x27;s daughter Jane Tweedy Perry Butler, was an American military commander and politician from South Carolina who served as a major general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, a post-bellum three-term United States Senator, and a major general in the United States Army during the Spanish–American War. Commander George Washington Rodgers (1822–1863), a grandson of Captain Perry and brother of Rear Admiral C.R.P. Rodgers, &quot;was distinguished for his bravery in the silencing of Fort Sumter and the batteries on Morris Island.&quot;

<doc id="1307831" wikidata="Q6831566" url="?curid=1307831" title="Michael Jackson (radio commentator)">
<text>Michael Robin Jackson (16 April 1934 – 15 January 2022) was a British-American talk radio host and occasional actor. He was based in the Los Angeles area. Jackson is best known for his radio show which covered arts, politics, and human interest subjects, particularly in the Los Angeles and greater Southern California area in the era before &quot;shock jocks&quot;. His show originally aired on L.A. radio station KABC and briefly aired on KGIL.

==Early life==
Jackson was born in London, England on 16 April 1934, and experienced The Blitz as a child. After the war, during which his father served in the RAF as a navigator trainer, his family moved to South Africa where he became a radio disc jockey and struck up what was to become a lifelong friendship with South African pianist and composer, Charles Segal (pianist). The Jacksons were appalled by the apartheid then dominant in South Africa, and they moved to the United States in 1958. Jackson had always wanted to be on the radio in Los Angeles, but first, he worked in cities like San Francisco, where he did a Top-40 show for station KYA. He made an appearance on the U.S. television program &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; on 7 August 1960.

Listeners reportedly loved his British accent, but he didn&#x27;t especially enjoy being a rock DJ. In fact, he hated rock music and ended up getting fired. When he was hired in the early &#x27;60s at KEWB to do an overnight shift, he gradually phased out playing records, and began chatting with callers. He got the reputation of being a problem-solver, and comedian Mort Sahl, a big fan of his, jokingly called him &quot;the all-night psychiatrist&quot;. The police regularly monitored his show, with his permission, so they could trace the calls of the occasional listener who expressed suicidal thoughts and make sure the person was okay. &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised him for his ability to maintain a calm demeanour no matter what the subject turned out to be.

==Career==
The &quot;Time&quot; article and other favourable publicity earned him some offers, and Jackson was finally hired in Los Angeles, where he briefly did the 7 p.m.-to-midnight shift at KHJ. Radio and TV critic Don Page of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; took notice of him almost immediately, saying he was a &quot;good talker and a patient listener,&quot; with an &quot;elegant and flexible&quot; command of the language. But when his ratings weren&#x27;t what KHJ hoped, he was fired. Fortunately, the CBS affiliate KNX picked him up, but he found their format very confining. Finally, in 1966, heritage talk station KABC hired him, and it was a perfect fit. The station was having great success with their talk radio format, and they gave Jackson the 9 a.m.-to-1 p.m. (later 9 a.m. to noon) spot. Jackson remained with them for the next three decades, with critics continuing to compliment him for being &quot;cultivated and enlightened&quot;. At that time, KABC broadcast the Joe Pyne show, and in the mid-1970s, when Jackson beat him in the ratings, he told a reporter that this proved &quot;you do not have to be rude to be successful.&quot;

He was on &quot;The Michael Jackson Show&quot; on Los Angeles TV Station KCET Channel 28 from 20 March 1978 to 4 May 1979.

Jackson liked to book his own guests, and he became well known for talking to interesting news makers from all around the world, ranging from Richard Nixon&#x27;s former counsel Charles Colson to economist Milton Friedman to Israeli military leader Moshe Dayan. He also talked to celebrities, psychologists and comedians, but he seemed to enjoy talking about current events. On the other hand, he was sometimes criticised for being too nice with his guests and not asking enough tough questions.

==Later years==
Jackson continued to be successful into the 1980s, but radio was changing. Although regarded by many as a liberal, he was not alone in that point of view: KABC had several liberal hosts, as well as several who were conservative. Rush Limbaugh was Jackson&#x27;s competitor, on the air at crosstown KFI, and Limbaugh had little difficulty defeating the veteran KABC talk show host. KABC&#x27;s management ultimately felt Jackson&#x27;s style no longer fitted with the modern &quot;in your face&quot; talk shows, the vast majority of which were conservative. On 3 July 1997, Jackson did his last daily talk show for KABC, to the dismay of his fans and a number of critics. Said one, &quot;Jackson has served as one of the radio dial&#x27;s last passionate voices of liberal politics...&quot; The timing was especially bad given that Jackson had just won an award as &quot;Radio Talk Show Host of the Year&quot; from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. He was moved to weekends and ultimately let go in November 1998, after more than 32 years with KABC.

===Return===
Jackson would return to radio, finding employment at KRLA (1110 AM), where he secured good ratings, but was still not able to beat Limbaugh. KRLA was pleased, however, because he increased the size of their audience. They had recently changed their format from oldies to all-talk, and station management felt that because he was so well known in Los Angeles, Jackson would be able to attract new listeners. Jackson found himself out of work again when KRLA was sold in October 2000.

In addition to changing hands, KRLA would also change its programming, becoming a sports station. He was then hired at KLAC, only to be placed out of work again in 2002 when the station changed its format back to music. In 2003, Jackson was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame; he was still a talented announcer, but at that point, he had no station to work for. The Englishman did some freelance work, producing interviews for all-news radio station KNX and doing some work as a news analyst. But he chose not to renew his contract, citing a lack of a regular time-slot as well as frustration when his long and thorough interviews were edited down into two-minute snippets.

Next Jackson joined the new KGIL 1260 AM; it had been playing classical music, but now the owner, Saul Levine, wanted to change formats, and Jackson was one of the talk-show hosts he hired. His first show for KGIL was on 29 October 2007, and he remained there for almost a year. His show was two hours in length, and his interviews of political guests with frequent call-ins were highly respected. Still courteous, still non-combative, Jackson was then 73 and as he told Steve Carney of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, he hoped that this time, he could settle in and work until whenever he chose to retire. That was not to be, as he was let go without explanation on Friday, 12 September 2008 upon his return from vacation two days earlier. He was not allowed to say a final farewell to his long-time listeners. The station reportedly decided to switch to syndicated programming.

In fall of 2009 Jackson returned to KABC as the co-host of an investment-oriented show called &quot;The Financial Insider with Michael Jackson&quot; airing Sundays from 11 a.m. to noon. As of February 2010 the program was still on the air. Jackson filled in for regular host Patt Morrison on her KPCC (National Public Radio affiliate at Pasadena, California) show on 18–19 July 2011.

==Personal life and death==
In 1965, Jackson married Alana Ladd, daughter of actor Alan Ladd and his agent, Sue Carol. Alana died in 2014. The couple had three children, Alan Jackson, Alisa Magno, and Devon Jackson, and six grandchildren, Lucky, Taylor, Adeline, Emily, Amelia, and Hugo.

Jackson died at his home in Los Angeles following a long battle with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, on 15 January 2022, at the age of 87.

==Awards==
Jackson was repeatedly voted Outstanding Radio Personality of the Year. His peers recognised his entertaining and probing style with four Golden Mike Awards for excellence in radio broadcasting. In 1997–98, he was voted Number One Radio Talk Show Host of the Year. He was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2003. He was a Member of the Order of the British Empire and of France&#x27;s &quot;Ordre national du Mérite&quot;. He held an honorary Doctorate of Laws from California Western School of Law.

He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. When the pop singer of the same name died on 25 June 2009, the singer&#x27;s star on the Walk of Fame was blocked off due to the premiere of the film &quot;Brüno&quot; at nearby Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. Fans of the singer started a makeshift memorial at the (near-identical, except for the &quot;category&quot; symbols below the name for which a radio symbol was on the radio personality&#x27;s star and a record below the singer&#x27;s) star belonging to the radio personality instead. Jackson posted on his website: &quot;I am willingly loan[ing] it to him and, if it would bring him back, he can have it. He was a real star. Sinatra, Presley, The Beatles, and Michael Jackson.&quot;

<text>Joseph Armand Roch Voisine, (born 26 March 1963) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, actor, and radio and television host who lives in Montreal and Paris. He writes and performs material in both English and French. He won the Juno Award for Male Vocalist of the Year in 1994. In 1997, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

==Beginnings==
Born in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada, he grew up in Saint-Basile, New Brunswick and later moved to Notre-Dame-du-Lac, Quebec when he was 12.

Voisine studied at École technique des métiers de Lauzon in Lévis (today Guillaume-Couture Secondary School) and at Polyvalente de Lévis (today École Pointe-Lévy). Then he continued for four years at Cégep Limoilou. He attended the University of Ottawa where he graduated in 1985 with a degree in physiotherapy and played four seasons with the uOttawa Gee-Gees men&#x27;s hockey team.

Voisine aspired to be a professional ice hockey player. He had to set his plans aside when he was severely injured while playing baseball in 1981.

==Career==
In the summer of 1986, he had his music debut when he sang on Canada Day (1 July) in front of 50,000 people at la Ronde amusement park in Montreal. He also worked as presenter of music videos on &quot;Top Jeunesse&quot; on the TQS (Télévision Quatre-Saisons) private French Quebec channel. In 1989, he appeared as Dany Ross in the CBC Television series &quot;Lance et Compte (He Shoots, He Scores)&quot;.

Voisine&#x27;s musical breakthrough came with his 1989 album &quot;Hélène&quot; which sold three million copies and became a major hit not only in Quebec but also in France, Belgium and Switzerland. In 1990, &quot;Hélène&quot; was awarded the Best Album prize at the Victoires de la Musique. He capitalized on his big success by releasing a bilingual French/English album &quot;Double&quot; with one CD containing all-French songs, the other all-English songs trying to position himself in both francophone and anglophone markets.

After a highly successful European Tour in 1991, he was awarded France&#x27;s Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, becoming the youngest artist to receive it at age 28. His second European tour culminated on 17 April 1992 at Champ-de-Mars in Paris where he sang in front of 75,000 people. The show was broadcast live on TF1 and reached 14 million viewers.

In 1993, Voisine had his biggest English-language hit to date with the single and album both entitled &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Be There&quot;, on which he worked with David Foster. The single reached number four on the Canadian music charts while the album reached number seven. Also in 1993, his wax statue was launched in Musée Grévin in Paris. In 2004, he had a huge success with the traditional song &quot;Jean Johnny Jean&quot; written by Gildas Arzel. The song appeared in Voisine&#x27;s album &quot;Coup de tête&quot;.

Over the years, he has continued alternating between recording both French and English-language albums. His French language work and concert tours have continued to enjoy success in Europe (especially France) and Quebec, while his English-language recordings are a frequent mainstay of Canadian adult contemporary radio. He also enjoys huge success internationally.

In 2006, he took part alongside other musicians in &quot;L&#x27;Or de nos vies&quot; in a formation named Fight Aids singing a song composed by Kyo. Revenues went to Fight Aids Monaco.

Université de Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada gave him an honorary doctorate in music in May 2007.

In the years 2008 to 2010, he launched his &quot;Americana&quot; series recorded in Nashville, Tennessee in tribute to American popular and country music. The third in the Americana series was dedicated to California music. In 2010 he also released the album &quot;Confidences&quot; in two separate European and Canadian editions. He was also one of the commentators for the men&#x27;s hockey tournament for French television at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. In 2013 he came back with an album of duos called &quot;Duophonique&quot;. In 2015, he released the single &quot;Cap Enragé&quot; as a duo with Natasha St-Pier.

He was inducted as a Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France in 1992 and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1995. He was made a Member of the Order of New Brunswick in 2014.

==Personal life==
Roch Voisine was born in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada to Réal Voisine, former mayor of Notre-Dame-du-Lac, Quebec and a former English teacher, and to Zélande Robichaud, a former nurse. He grew up in Saint-Basile, New Brunswick. He is the oldest of three children. His brother Marc was born in 1965, and his sister, Janice, in 1966.

When Roch was four years old, Voisine&#x27;s parents divorced and he moved to live with his paternal grandparents, Maurille and Dorina Racine Voisine, until he was eight, when he went to live with his father again. Roch considered his grandparents very influential on him, even as an adult. Roch moved to Notre-Dame-du-Lac when he was 12.

Voisine married Myriam Saint-Jean on 21 December 2002. The couple have two sons. On 15 October 2007, Voisine&#x27;s website announced his and Myriam&#x27;s separation. Later on, he had a short-lived relationship with Narimane Doumandji, a public relations specialist. He has been with Myriam Chantal since 2012 and the couple had a baby girl, Lily-Dorina, born July 1, 2020. According to Myriam Chantal&#x27;s Facebook, Myriam and Roch split up in 2022.

<doc id="1307850" wikidata="Q5052376" url="?curid=1307850" title="Cathedral of Saint Vibiana">
<text>The Cathedral of Saint Vibiana (), often called St. Vibiana&#x27;s, is a former Catholic cathedral for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Located in Downtown Los Angeles, the building opened in 1876 as the cathedral for what was then known as the Diocese of Monterey–Los Angeles, and remained the official cathedral of the Los Angeles see for over 100 years. It is named for Vibiana, a saint who lived in the 3rd century, and Is currently a secular events venue.

The cathedral was heavily damaged during the 1994 Northridge earthquake and became the subject of a lengthy legal battle between the archdiocese, which wanted to demolish the building and build a new cathedral on the site, and preservationists, who wanted the building to remain standing due to its historical significance. In 1996, the parties involved reached a compromise in which the archdiocese would purchase a nearby site on which to build a new cathedral, and in turn would turn over the St. Vibiana site to the City of Los Angeles. The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels was dedicated in 2002 as the successor to St. Vibiana&#x27;s.

In the late 2000s, the former cathedral building became an event venue called Vibiana. The Little Tokyo branch of the Los Angeles Public Library is also located on the site. The 1876 cathedral structure is one of the last remaining buildings from the early period of Los Angeles history.

== History ==

Plans for a cathedral dated back to 1859, and land for the facility was donated by Amiel Cavalier. The complex, on the southeast corner of Main and Second streets in downtown Los Angeles, was dedicated in 1876 and cost US$80,000 to build. The cathedral&#x27;s architects, Kysor &amp; Mathews, also designed the landmark Pico House. The Baroque-inspired Italianate structure was a landmark in the early days of Los Angeles. When first opened, it held one-tenth of the young town&#x27;s population. The interior was remodeled around 1895, using onyx and marble; the exterior facade was changed in 1922–24 to give it a new look, said to be based on a Roman design.

Pope Pius IX chose the cathedral&#x27;s name, choosing third-century Roman martyr Saint Vibiana. Cathedrals traditionally contained the relics of a saint, so the remains of St. Vibiana were removed from the Catacombs of Rome and moved to a gilt-and-plate-glass sarcophagus located in a niche above the high altar.

During the 1940s, a rectory and school building were added. The school closed in 1969 because the parish could not afford it. It became a convent for the Disciples of the Divine Master.

The facility was outgrown by the region&#x27;s rapidly expanding population, and the archdiocese decided that it needed a larger main facility; however, preservationists pressured them not to destroy the historic landmark. The situation was complicated further when the 1994 Northridge earthquake caused extensive damage to the cathedral and its 1,200-seat sanctuary. Deciding that the damage was not worth repairing in such a small structure, the archdiocese began demolition on the site in 1996, without permits. However, the sudden dismantling of the bell tower on a Saturday morning prompted a frantic save-the-cathedral campaign, and work by the archdiocese was halted by preservationists who had a temporary restraining order placed on demolition. The archdiocese argued that it had the right to level its own facility; preservationists and the city wanted the church to be preserved. The structure was listed on the country&#x27;s &quot;11 Most Endangered Places&quot; by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. A state Court of Appeal rejected the archdiocese&#x27;s argument to be allowed to quickly demolish the cathedral; then-City Councilwoman Rita Walters had moved to strip the cathedral of its historic monument status, an action that would exempt the archdiocese from having to prepare the full environmental impact study normally required for destruction of a city landmark.

Finally a compromise was reached: the City of Los Angeles agreed to swap land with the archdiocese, giving the Church a much larger plot next to the 101 Freeway. The archdiocese agreed, and the land was developed into the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, constructed and consecrated as the new mother church cathedral parish of the archdiocese. Some items from St. Vibiana&#x27;s Cathedral were used in the new cathedral. The stained glass and sarcophagus were placed in the new cathedral&#x27;s crypt mausoleum. Pipes from the 1980 Austin pipe organ have been incorporated into the organ at the new cathedral. An oratorio about Saint Vibiana was written by Peter Boyd and performed in Pacoima in 1997.

The cathedral site was taken over by the city. The city sold the former cathedral building to downtown developer Tom Gilmore in 1999 for $4.6 million. The non-historic 1940s Education Building was demolished, making way for the new Little Tokyo Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. The building celebrated the end of its renovation with a gala on November 12, 2005, though plans for its use were still undecided. In August 2007, the cupola was returned to the top of the bell tower.

The former cathedral was later renamed Vibiana and converted to an event space, including for post-Emmy Award parties in 2009 and 2010, Art of Elysium&#x27;s annual charity gala, Warner Music Group&#x27;s post-Grammy Awards party, and the Alfred E. Mann Foundation Gala.

In 2016, the venue hosted four episodes of the final season of &quot;American Idol&quot;.

In 2017, it was added to the National Trust for Historic Preservation list of America&#x27;s Most Endangered Places &quot;Success Stories&quot;—sites that were named to the &quot;Most Endangered&quot; list that were the focus of successful preservation efforts

Amy Knoll Fraser and Chef Neal Fraser are now the owners and operators of Redbird | Vibiana, a wedding, events and performing arts venue located in the Historic Core of Downtown Los Angeles.

<doc id="1307857" wikidata="Q1291574" url="?curid=1307857" title="Steponas Darius">
<text>Steponas Darius (known as Stephen Darius in the US; born Steponas Jucevičius-Darašius; January 8, 1896 – July 17, 1933) was a Lithuanian American pilot, who died in a non-stop flight attempt in the &quot;Lituanica&quot; from New York City to Kaunas, Lithuania, in 1933.

== Biography ==
Born in Rubiškės, in the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire, Darius immigrated to the US with his family in 1907. In 1917 he joined the United States Army, after the United States entered World War I, and changed his name to Darius. He served as a telephone operator in the 149th Field Artillery Regiment, fought in France, was wounded and received the Purple Heart medal. In 1920, he returned to Lithuania and joined the Lithuanian Army, graduating from War School of Kaunas in 1921. He participated in the Klaipėda Revolt of 1923. While living in Lithuania he completed pilot training. In 1927 he returned to the United States and started working in civil aviation. He initially formed South Bend Airways in partnership with Carl G. Jordan of South Bend, Indiana. Their fleet consisted of a Pheasant H-10 and an Eaglerock Long Wing, both powered by OX-5 engines of World War I vintage. He lived for a while in the Jordan household prior to moving to Chicago.

While living in Lithuania he actively promoted various sports. He initiated the building of the first stadium in Kaunas; it was later named after him – the S. Darius and S. Girėnas Stadium. He played basketball, baseball, ice hockey, and practiced boxing and athletics, while also being an international footballer, having played for Lithuania national football team in its first competitive game against Estonia on June 23, 1923. He was also part of Lithuania&#x27;s squad for the 1924 Summer Olympics, but he did not play in any matches. Since he was the first to publish booklets about basketball and baseball, he is considered to have brought those sports to Lithuania. He was also the first chairman of Lithuanian Physical Education Union, and a founder of &quot;Sporto Žurnalas&quot; (&quot;Sports Magazine&quot;).

=== Death ===
On July 15, 1933, along with Stasys Girėnas, he attempted a nonstop flight from New York City, United States to Kaunas, Lithuania – a total of , in a Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker airplane named &quot;Lituanica&quot;. After successfully crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 37 hours and 11 minutes, they crashed on July 17, at 0:36 am (Berlin Time), by the village of Kuhdamm, near Soldin, Germany (now Pszczelnik, near the Myślibórz area, Poland), most probably because of difficult weather conditions combined with engine problems. Both aviators were killed in the crash. They had covered a distance of without landing, and were only short of their destination.

== Awards and honors ==
* On 18 May 1934, Lithuania issued a set of six airmail stamps, in honor of Captains Darius and Girėnas, and the Lituanica. 
* A monument to Darius and Girėnas is located in the northeast corner of Marquette Park in Chicago.
*The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.
* Asteroid 288960 Steponasdarius, discovered by Kazimieras Černis and Justas Zdanavičius in 2004, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on June 9, 2017 ().

Hasdai acquired in his youth a thorough knowledge of Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin, the latter being known only to the higher clergy of Spain at the time. He also studied medicine, and is said to have discovered a panacea, called &quot;Al-Faruk&quot;. Appointed physician to Caliph Abd-ar-Rahman III (912-961), he, by his engaging manners, knowledge, character, and extraordinary ability, gained his master&#x27;s confidence to such a degree that he became the caliph&#x27;s confidant and faithful counselor. Without bearing the title of vizier he was in reality minister of foreign affairs; he had also control of the customs and ship-dues in the port of Córdoba. Hasdai arranged the alliances formed by the caliph with foreign powers, and he received the envoys sent by the latter to Córdoba. In 949 an embassy was sent by Constantine VII to form a diplomatic league between the hard-pressed Byzantine empire and the powerful ruler of Spain. Among the presents brought by the embassy was a magnificent codex of Pedanius Dioscorides&#x27; work on botany, which the Arabic physicians and naturalists valued highly. Hasdai, with the aid of a learned Greek monk named Nicholas, translated it into Arabic, making it thereby the common property of the Arabs and of medieval Europe.

==As minister==

Hasdai rendered important services to the caliph by his treatment of an embassy headed by John of Gorze, sent to Córdoba in 956 by Otto I. The caliph, fearing that the letter of the German emperor might contain matter derogatory to Islam, commissioned Hasdai to open the negotiations with the envoys. Hasdai, who soon perceived that the letter could not be delivered to the caliph in its present form, persuaded the envoys to send for another letter which should contain no objectionable matter. John of Gorze said that he had &quot;never seen a man of such subtle intellect as the Jew Hasdeu&quot;.

Hasdai secured a great diplomatic triumph during the difficulties which arose between the kingdoms of León and Navarre, when the ambitious Queen Toda of Pamplona sought the aid of Abd ar-Rahman in reinstating her deposed grandson, Sancho I of León. Hasdai was sent to the court of Navarre; and he succeeded after a long struggle in persuading the queen to go to Córdoba with her son and grandson, in order to prostrate herself before the caliph, her old enemy, and implore the aid of his arms (958). The proud Navarrese allowed herself to be convinced by Hasdai – as a Jewish poet of the time expressed himself - &quot;by the charm of his words, the strength of his wisdom, the force of his cunning, and his thousand tricks.&quot;

Hasdai retained his high position under &#x27;Abd ar-Rahman&#x27;s son and successor, al-Hakam II, who even surpassed his father in his love for science.

==Jewish activity==
Hasdai was very active on behalf of his co-religionists and Jewish science. Allegedly, when he heard that there was a Jewish state with a Jewish ruler in Central Asia, he desired to enter into correspondence with this monarch. When the report of the existence of the Khazar state was confirmed by two Jews, Mar Saul and Mar Joseph, who had come in the retinue of an embassy from the Croatian king to Córdoba, Hasdai entrusted to them a letter, written in good Hebrew addressed to the Jewish king, in which he gave an account of his position in the Western state, described the geographical situation of Andalusia and its relation to foreign countries, and asked for detailed information regarding the Khazars, their origin, their political and military organization, etc. Historian Shaul Stampfer has questioned the authenticity of the letter said to have been received from the Khazar king, citing numerous linguistic and geographic oddities amid a flourishing of pseudo-historiographic texts and forgeries in medieval Spain.

Hasdai sent a letter to Empress Helena of Byzantium in which he pleaded for religious liberty for the Jews of Byzantium. He pointed to his own warm relations with the Muslim Caliph in Córdoba as well as his benevolent attitude towards the Christians of Spain.

Hasdai sent rich presents to the talmudic academies in Babylonia and corresponded with Dosa, the son of Saadia Gaon. He was also instrumental in transferring the center of Jewish theological studies from Lower Mesopotamia to the Iberian Peninsula. Moses ben Hanoch, from Sura Academy, had been captured by pirates off of Italy, ransomed by Iberian Jews, and was brought to Córdoba. Hasdai appointed him director of a school, thereby detaching Judaism from its dependence on the Jews of the Abbasid Caliphate, to the great joy of the caliph, as Abraham ibn Daud said in &quot;Sefer ha-Kabbalah&quot; p. 68. Ibn Abi Usaybi&#x27;a wrote about him in his biographical encyclopedia, &quot;Hasdai b. Isaac was among the foremost Jewish scholars versed in their law. He opened to his co-religionists in Andalusia the gates of knowledge of the religious law, of chronology, etc. Before his time they had to apply to the Jews of Baghdad on legal questions, and on matters referring to the calendar and the dates of the festivals&quot; (ed. Müller, ii. 50).

Hasdai marks the beginning of the florescence of Andalusi Jewish culture and the rise of poetry and the study of Hebrew grammar. Himself a scholar, he encouraged scholarship among his coreligionists by the purchase of Hebrew books, which he imported from the East, and by supporting Jewish scholars whom he gathered about him. Among the latter was Menahem ben Saruq of Tortosa, the protégé of Hasdai&#x27;s father, as well as Dunash ben Labrat, both of whom addressed poems to their patron. Dunash, however, prejudiced Hasdai to such a degree against Menahem that Hasdai caused Menahem to be maltreated.

==Personal life==
There is no record of Shaprut having a wife. The family came from either Byzantium or Armenia (now Turkey or Armenia) that has the surname Chiprut claims descent from Hasdai.
In addition, several families throughout the Jewish Diaspora carry variations of the Hasdai name which came about when moving from one country to another [i.e.: Hazday, Hazdai, Hasday, Hazbay]

<doc id="1307869" wikidata="Q1989190" url="?curid=1307869" title="William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme">
<text>William Hesketh Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme (; 19 September 1851 – 7 May 1925) was an English industrialist, philanthropist, and politician. Educated at a small private school until the age of nine, then at church schools, he joined his father&#x27;s wholesale grocery business in Bolton at the age of fifteen. Following an apprenticeship and a series of appointments in the family business, which he successfully expanded, he began manufacturing Sunlight Soap, building a substantial business empire with many well-known brands such as Lux and Lifebuoy. In 1886, together with his brother, James, he established Lever Brothers, which was one of the first companies to manufacture soap from vegetable oils, and which is now part of the British multinational Unilever. In politics, Lever briefly sat as a Liberal MP for Wirral and later, as Lord Leverhulme, in the House of Lords as a Peer. He was an advocate for expansion of the British Empire, particularly in Africa and Asia, which supplied palm oil, a key ingredient in Lever&#x27;s product line. His firm had become associated with activities in the Belgian Congo by 1911.

A patron of the arts, Lever began collecting artworks in 1893 when he bought a painting by Edmund Leighton. Lever&#x27;s rival in the soap industry, A &amp; F Pears, had taken the lead in using art for marketing by buying paintings such as &quot;Bubbles&quot; by John Everett Millais to promote its products. Lever&#x27;s response was to acquire similarly illustrative works, and he later bought &quot;The New Frock&quot; by William Powell Frith to promote the Sunlight soap brand. In 1922 he founded the Lady Lever Art Gallery at Port Sunlight in Cheshire which he dedicated to his late wife Elizabeth.

== Biography ==

William Lever was born on 19 September 1851 at 16 Wood Street, Bolton, Lancashire, England. He was the eldest son and the seventh child born to James Lever (1809–1897), a grocer, and Eliza Hesketh, daughter of a cotton mill manager. From age six to age nine William attended a small private school run by the Misses Aspinwall in a house on Wood Street, not far from the Lever family home. At the age of nine he was sent to another of Bolton&#x27;s private schools before finishing his formal education at Bolton Church Institute from 1864 to 1867. Not a particularly bright scholar, he was nevertheless keen to acquire academic learning. His mother wanted him to enter the learned professions, ostensibly medicine, and William himself was very interested in becoming an architect. His father, however, had other, somewhat less erudite plans for his eldest son and thus, not long after his fifteenth birthday, he started work in the family grocery business. By then, the Lever family had moved from Wood Street to a larger house adjacent to the grocery business. In the celebrated Victorian manner, the boss&#x27;s son was, initially at least, shown no preferential treatment, being required to sweep the floor and tidy up before the staff arrived. Other tasks included various practical assignments more to do with the fundamentals of the wholesale grocery trade, almost certainly designed to prepare the youth for management in later years. His remuneration was &quot;a shilling a week all found&quot; which meant that his board and lodgings were provided, making the financial aspect of the contract more-or-less pocket money.

At some stage, William was moved to the administration department where he learned about and subsequently reorganised the firm&#x27;s accounting and bookkeeping systems. Perhaps in order to escape the shackles of his father&#x27;s close supervision, he eventually petitioned to take the place of a retiring sales representative; in those days, being a &quot;rep&quot; meant a great deal of travelling by horse and carriage and spending nights away from home, as well as a measure of independence and some leeway in making decisions and brokering deals with the canny retailers on his route.

The Lever family were Congregationalists and James Lever, a teetotaller and a non-smoker, applied its principles in his business life as well as in his personal life. In accordance with nonconformist tenets, the Lever family held frequent Bible readings at home, and were regular worshipers at the local chapel. Thus, William&#x27;s circle of friends tended to comprise children of similar backgrounds and beliefs. Among these was Elizabeth Ellen Hulme (Dec 1850 – 24 July 1913) whose family also resided on Wood Street. In the tradition of the nineteenth-century well-to-do middle classes, William paid court to Elizabeth over several years and, when the financial circumstances allowed, he formally proposed marriage. On 17 April 1874, after a two-year engagement, they were married at the Church of St Andrew and St George (then Congregational, now United Reformed) on St Georges Road, Bolton.

In 1879 the Lever family business acquired a failing wholesale grocer in Wigan, affording young William an opportunity to prove his ability as a quasi-autonomous administrator. The expanded activity necessitated a search for new suppliers, taking William to Ireland, France and other parts of Europe, appointing local agents to safeguard the firm&#x27;s interests. At this time, his flair for advertising and branding began to emerge as he successfully differentiated the Lever brand from generic commodities. By the end of 1879, the business&#x27; prospects were good enough to convince William and Elizabeth to invest in a new home in Bolton and by 1881 the expanding Wigan business warranted the commissioning of new premises; Lever and Company was expanding steadily.

=== Freemasonry ===

In 1902, when he became the first initiate of a lodge bearing his name (William Hesketh Lever Lodge No. 2916 in Port Sunlight) Lever involved himself in Freemasonry. In 1907 he became Worshipful Master, going on to found many Lodges and hold various offices at national level. In 1907, while sitting as an MP, he was a founder of the Phoenix Lodge 3236, and in May 1912 he founded St. Hilary Lodge No. 3591. He then became Past Pro-Grand Warden (P.P.G.W) and Immediate Past Master (I.P.M). In 1919, he was appointed Senior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of Mark Master Masons of England. He was Provincial Senior Grand Warden of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Cheshire, and founded many other Lodges.

== Sunlight soap ==

In 1884, having developed Lever and Company to a point where it was virtually self-governing, William resolved to capture a large share of the international soap trade. In essence, he planned to manufacture and market a range of high quality, price differentiated products, using a strategy based upon his experiences with butter and other commodity products. Thus, instead of selling soap by weight, he had it cut into small, manageable tablets which were individually wrapped. The Trade Mark Registration Act 1875 protected trade names from counterfeiters and imitators, and this opened the way for brand name recognition and consumer loyalty. Within 12 months, Lever had registered a series of trade marks, among them Sunlight, a house style that was later applied to a range of household soaps.

The Lever soap campaign began with a range of Sunlight branded soaps differentiated mainly by colour: Pale, Mottled and Brown, with a fourth variant presented as a product that was especially formulated for washing clothes. This &#x27;Sunlight Self-Washer Soap&#x27; was widely advertised using billboards and posters located at public places throughout northern England. But at that time, Lever had to rely for supplies on &quot;soap-boilers&quot; – independent firms that specialised in producing soap to order – who were expected to work to his proprietary formula. The reliability of these suppliers was however apparently questionable, as variations in the end product gave rise to complaints about the effectiveness, and even the smell, of Self-Washer.

After much consideration, William began to consider the possibility of taking control of the manufacture, and thus the quality, of Sunlight soaps. He had discovered a small producer based in Warrington that badly needed to increase its output in order to become profitable and although Lever could probably have solved its problem though placing orders for most of his soap, he clearly wanted complete control. Having persuaded his father and younger brother that it would be a beneficial strategy, William raised sufficient capital for the takeover to take place and in August 1885 Lever and Company, wholesale grocers, added soap manufacturing to its range of activities.

The success of the Sunlight brand, especially after Lever assumed full responsibility for the product&#x27;s quality, was exceptional; so much so that by the end of 1887 it had become impossible to squeeze any more capacity from the Warrington plant. Having failed to either extend the site or find more space in the areas, Lever eventually decided to move the whole manufacturing facility to an green-field site near Birkenhead.

=== Port Sunlight ===

Lever was the founder of &#x27;Port Sunlight&#x27;. In 1887, Lever bought of land on the Wirral in Cheshire between the River Mersey and the railway line at Bebington. This site became Port Sunlight where he built his works and a model village to house its employees. From 1888, Port Sunlight village offered decent living conditions in the belief that good housing would ensure a healthy and happy workforce. The community was designed to house and support the workers. Life in Port Sunlight included intrusive rules and implied mandatory participation in activities. The tied cottages meant that a worker losing his or her job could be almost simultaneously evicted.

In some matters, Lever was keen to allow the residents of Port Sunlight a degree of democratic control, and this seems to have led to a common conviction that he was in favour of women&#x27;s suffrage: a belief that possibly stems from a situation arising in connection the Bridge Inn, a Port Sunlight temperance &quot;pub&quot; that was opened in 1900. Lever was a lifelong teetotaller, and he naturally assumed that the Bridge would be &quot;dry&quot;. Within two years of its opening, however, representations were made to change its status to a licensed house. Lever promptly announced that he would not impose his own views, and that the issue would be decided by a referendum; insisting somewhat unconventionally for that time that women would take part. With the added proviso that the Bridge would only become a true British &quot;pub&quot; if a supermajority of 75% was in favour, Lever probably felt confident that the outcome would support his abstemious sentiments, but in the event more than 80% voted for an alcohol licence and even though some people petitioned Lever urging him to use his absolute authority in Port Sunlight and ignore the referendum, he refused to do so.

In reality, workers&#x27; social lives were policed from the head office, and some of Lever&#x27;s employees clearly resented his paternalism. However well intentioned, the power it afforded the company, even though it was rarely exercised, was viewed as an attack on workers&#x27; liberty and human rights. Although many such people preferred to find their own accommodation, there were others who, for whatever reason, were never given an opportunity to reside in Port Sunlight. Perhaps Lever&#x27;s observations on this matter are revealing:

=== Advertising ===

It is clear that skilful advertising and favourable publicity were major positive factors in the early success of Lever&#x27;s enterprise. Much of the Sunlight brand &quot;message&quot; focussed on the alleviation of drudgery in the lives of working class housewives, targeted no doubt because of the increased spending power and improved education of that large section of the British population, the skilled workers. For inspiration, Lever turned to the United States and he seems to have had no reservations in adopting American methods in Above The Line (ATL) and Below The Line (BTL) advertising. One subtle proposition introduced from America was designed to persuade women that the toil of housework was responsible for an accelerated aging process, and that Sunlight Soap offered a form of liberation. This, and other similarly cautionary messages, were posted on hoardings and on the sides of buses together with pictures that underscored the slogans. Promotional literature, in the form of instructions about the best ways of using the company&#x27;s products, was widely distributed, as well as allegorical accounts of their successful adoption by stylish – and totally fictional – upper-class ladies.

One of the more remarkable Below The Line projects was the Sunlight Year Book, which was a type of almanac first introduced in 1895. These were quite substantial (the 1899 version had 480 pages) publications which evolved into a hard-backed and &#x27;Profusely Illustrated&#x27; volume, described by the publisher as:

These books were distributed widely, and many were given to the head teachers of schools, causing protests from members of the Soap Makers Association. Other schemes adopted from the USA included competitions with cash prizes, coupons and tokens included in soap packaging, and sponsorship of worthy causes such as a lifeboat named Sunlight. The success of these schemes soon led to their adoption by Lever&#x27;s competitors, although they eventually became difficult to sustain as raw material costs began to increase during the first decade of the twentieth-century, inducing most soap makers to phase them out.

Lever&#x27;s desire to directly influence the consumer led to the employment of &quot;District Agents&quot; whose tasks involved engaging directly with members of the public in order to advance the merits of the company&#x27;s products, as well as to act as undercover agents who reported on anything they observed that could be useful to Port Sunlight. The success of this aspect of Lever&#x27;s marketing strategy led to the first overseas manufacturing plant being established in Switzerland. &#x27;Savonneries Helvetia&#x27; was the inspiration of the somewhat charismatic François-Henri Lavanchy-Clarke, Lever&#x27;s District Agent in Switzerland who used the fledgling cinema industry as an advertising tool. The success of this venture led, by 1900, to the establishment of factories in Switzerland, Germany, Canada, the United States, Holland, and Australia with several others planned, while the Sunlight brand had been strengthened by the addition of Lifebuoy, Vim and Lux.

=== Soap combine ===
By 1905, many of the raw materials used in the manufacture of soap were being used by makers of margarine and other new products, and in early 1906 it was clear that this increased demand was not temporary, and prices rose sharply. Concern in the soap-making industry was widespread and, in some cases, acute, competition became fierce, leading to increases in advertising expenses which served only to exacerbate an already critical situation. Lever himself considered, and then rejected, some rather drastic alterations to the Sunlight formula; eventually deciding on reducing the weight of the standard bar. In July 1906 he was asked to attend a meeting in Liverpool, called by a group of soap-makers based in the north of England. The result was an accord to put in motion changes that would effectively cartelise the industry by stifling competition and controlling prices to the consumer.

Lever attempted to rationalise the formation of the Soap Trust by claiming that the industry would become more efficient, thus making cost savings that could be passed on to the consumer; assertions that could never be realised. Financial manoeuvres made by Lever were designed to maximise the Lever Brothers position within the cartel included takeovers and share issues, but as more people became aware of their plans, it was inevitable that information would be leaked to the press. Nevertheless, retrenchments were set in motion, including the cancellation of several substantial press advertising campaigns. By October, several newspapers were publishing articles about the Soap Trust, and some began to represent Lever as the leading character in an infamous conspiracy.

Headlines in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Evening News&quot; proclaimed: &quot;Soap Trust Arithmetic – How 15 ounces make a pound&quot;, &quot;Dismissal of employees begins&quot;, and &quot;Trust Soap Already Dearer&quot;. Other allegations included claims that the Trust was trying to control the available supplies of raw materials and that it was preparing to use &#x27;unsavoury substances&#x27; in its soaps. Port Sunlight, parodied as &#x27;Port Moonshine&#x27;, was portrayed as a sweatshop, reports by disgruntled retailers were given prominent positions and readers were urged to buy products made by non-Trust manufacturers.

Lord Northcliffe took a personal interest in the anti-Soap Trust campaign. While extending assurances of &quot;the strictest impartiality&quot; to Lever, Northcliffe&#x27;s close friendship with Theodore Roosevelt revealed his support for the American&#x27;s activities as a &#x27;trustbuster&#x27;. Roosevelt&#x27;s investigations of dishonest dealings among many American companies had been fully reported in Britain, eliciting a pious chorus of disapproval and claims that any similar wrongdoing by British firms would be unimaginable but Northcliffe, pointing to the existence of a British Tobacco Trust, was not convinced. He set in motion a campaign of investigative journalism, some of which seems to have verged upon persecution; the clear objective of which was to smash Lever&#x27;s soap combine.

The campaign had a surprisingly rapid and strikingly negative impact on the member companies, particularly on Lever Brothers&#x27; businesses. By November 1906, Lever sales had fallen by sixty per cent compared with the previous year and Lever Brothers shares had lost around twenty-five per cent of their value; other members of the Combine experienced similarly devastating declines. Such conditions inevitably led to a reassessment of the position and, following a meeting of all firms involved in the alliance, but without the wholehearted approval of Lever himself, a decision was made to bring the organization to an end. Most of the members of the failed cartel found their reputations seriously tarnished, and none escaped financial damage; Lever estimated his losses at &quot;considerably over half a million&quot;. For Northcliffe, this was clearly a victory of liberty over iniquity, a view reflected in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;″s headline, &quot;Public Opinion Smashed the Soap Trust&quot;.

=== &quot;Daily Mail&quot; libel case ===

Perhaps naturally, Lever felt that the failure of the soap combine was the result of animosity and resentment directed at him personally, rather than as a consequence of its members&#x27; dishonesty. Having sought several opinions on the authority of his suit, he retained Sir Edward Carson and two juniors, one of whom was Frederick Edwin Smith, later Lord Birkenhead. For the defendants, Rufus Isaacs, later Marquess of Reading and Viceroy of India, assisted by another K.C. and two juniors, acted for Associated Newspapers Ltd. Lever&#x27;s legal team were in no doubt of the outcome; as F.E. Smith reportedly observed &quot;There is no answer to this action for libel and the damages must be enormous.&quot; On 15 July 1907 the case came up at Liverpool before Mr Justice Lawrence.

The circumstances in which the trial took place were unusual in that, while Lever&#x27;s legal team were accommodated at Thornton Manor, Lord Northcliffe, the principal witness for the defence, was overseas and, according to Jolly, &quot;had no intention of returning within range of any writ server while the case was on.&quot; It seems clear, therefore, that Northcliffe was in the wrong and, moreover, he knew that he would most probably lose the case: he reportedly offered Lever a public apology shortly before the start of the trial. For the plaintiff, Carson accused Associated Newspapers of conducting a malicious campaign &quot;with the object of smashing up Lever Brothers&quot;. Speaking for more than five hours, he listed a number of complaints and asked the jury to award punitive damages. He then called Lever as his first witness, inviting the leader of the defence team to &quot;cross-examine him to his heart&#x27;s content, and, when his time comes, I hope he will be able to follow my example and do the same, and call as his first witness his own client, Lord Northcliffe...&quot;

Such was the impression of Lever&#x27;s demeanour and testimony on the defence team that, as soon as the court was assembled on the following day, they capitulated completely. They also stated that, on behalf of their clients that they wished to retract completely &quot;every imputation made upon Mr Lever&#x27;s honour and integrity&quot; and express their deepest regrets for having made such malicious attacks upon him. There followed a scene on the floor of the court wherein the legal teams literally haggled over the size of the financial settlement. In the end, the sum agreed to was £50,000, plus around £40,000 which was eventually awarded from individual newspapers. This victory was celebrated with a day&#x27;s holiday at Port Sunlight, where Lever blithely addressed the employees and other spectators who cheered and applauded their hero.

Lever Brothers had indeed been seriously damaged by the press, as well as by rises in the costs of raw materials, but Lever hesitated to use the court awarded cash to bolster the company. Instead, he presented it all to Liverpool University, bestowing significant sums to the faculties of Town Planning, Tropical Medicine, and Russian Studies, while making sure that an enduring record of the litigation was ensconced in the University library.

== Africa ==

In the early 1900s, Lever was using palm oil produced in the British West African colonies. When he found difficulties in obtaining more palm plantation concessions, he started looking elsewhere. In 1911, Lever signed a treaty with the Belgian Government to gain access to the palm oil of the Belgian Congo and opened his operation under a subsidiary of the Lever consortium named &quot;Huileries du Congo Belge&quot; (HCB) after buying a concession for of forest for palm oil production. The main coordinating base was established at Leverville in what was then the district of Kwango, later part of the Province of Léopoldville.

The company town of Leverville was a project born out of the shared desire of the Belgian Government and of Lever Brothers to build a &#x27;moral&#x27; form of capitalism in Central Africa. For Belgium, Lever Brothers was an ideal partner, a company hailed for the social policies it had put in place in Great Britain. For Lever, HCB was expected to become the crowning achievement of his own brand of &quot;moral capitalism&quot;. A few months before his death, Lord Leverhulme, as he then was, wrote in a private letter that the &quot;Huileries&quot; were &quot;a business like none other we have. Perhaps Port Sunlight comes nearest to it in social work&quot;. By 1923, a Lever soap factory was built there, and by 1924 SAVCO (&quot;Savonneries Congolaises&quot;) was established.

Lever&#x27;s attitudes towards the Congolese were paternalistic and his views were much more progressive than most industrialists of the time. Malcolm Hardman writes that &quot;Lever observed and respected the intelligence and integrity of the Congolese he was allowed to meet&quot;. Sir William Lever, Baronet, as he had become in December 1911, firmly believed that paid labour alongside the schools, hospitals and rations his company promised to provide would attract workers. However, &quot;the harshness and danger of the labour demanded from them, living in camps away from their homes, as well as the poor remuneration HCB offered, failed to interest them.&quot;

Failing to find sufficient voluntary workers, HCB turned to the Belgian colonial authorities, a brutal regime notorious for their use of a system of &quot;travail forcé&quot; (forced labour). The Belgians were &quot;grateful to have a partnership with an enlightened entrepreneur to help salvage their battered reputation&quot; and it allowed Lever to recruit the Congolese workforce he needed. Leverhulme&#x27;s participation in this system of formalised labour has been documented by Jules Marchal, who contends that, &quot;Leverhulme set up a private kingdom reliant on the horrific Belgian system of forced labour, a program that reduced the population of Congo by half and accounted for more deaths than the Nazi holocaust&quot;. The archives show a record of Belgian administrators, missionaries and doctors protesting against the practices at the Lever plantations. Formal parliamentary investigations by the Belgian Parliament were called for by members of the Belgian Socialist Party.

The company&#x27;s former Congo plantations today operate under the control of Feronia Inc, employing approximately 4,000 people, acquired by the firm in 2009.

== Lewis &amp; Harris ==

In May 1918, by then in semi-retirement, Baron Leverhulme, as he was now, bought the Isle of Lewis for £167,000 (). And in late 1919 he bought the estate of South Harris for £36,000; both in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland. His plans for their future prosperity centred upon the application of modern science and his own business skills in establishing a large and thriving fishing industry. Although Stornoway had a good harbour, there were many disadvantages to Lord Leverhulme&#x27;s plans for the port. Its remoteness led to additional transport costs for ice, fuel, packaging, and anything else that had to be imported, as well as for the fish products, almost all of which was sold on the Scottish mainland. The place itself was, for various reasons, unpopular with sailors, and the local population&#x27;s strict Presbyterian observance of the Sabbath had a negative effect on fishing operations, while catches of varieties of fish other than herring were unfeasibly small.

Lord Leverhulme intended that the port should be improved and enlarged to attract landings of fish from visiting vessels to supplement catches made by local boats and his own fleet of modern drifters and trawlers. There would be an ice-making factory, and cargo vessels with refrigerated holds to take the fresh fish to a depot on the British mainland at Fleetwood, Lancashire, which was well placed to serve the industrial towns of the North of England. Leverhulme also expanded the herring-curing capacity and enlarged the fish processing facilities with the installation of a canning factory, and a plant to make fishcakes, fishpaste, glue, animal feed, and fertiliser, with similar equipment being established at Fleetwood.

Vertical Integration was apparently one of Leverhulme&#x27;s main strategies for the island fisheries venture, and to this end he acquired retail fishmonger&#x27;s shops in most of the UK&#x27;s larger towns and cities: all were modernised and refitted, and their previous proprietors were installed as managers. This aspect of Lever&#x27;s Hebridean venture was named Mac Fisheries; the fleet of fishing vessels the MacLine Company. Mac Fisheries was a success, and it grew rapidly until there were over four hundred shops all purchasing fish from many different wholesale suppliers. Other food industry enterprises were acquired including Wall&#x27;s, a manufacturer of ice-cream and sausages, and various companies specialising in different segments of the fish business, as well as several fishing fleet owners and operators. Although these developments brought tangible benefits to the people of Lewis, Leverhulme&#x27;s plans did not suit everyone, and this anomaly created severe obstacles for his ambitious plans for the Western Isles.

Typically, Leverhulme&#x27;s business strategies were comprehensive and meticulously set out. His plans for the island called for a reliable workforce, but although the inhabitants of Stornoway were generally well educated and hardworking, they were for the most part regularly employed and well paid. The largely Gaelic-speaking crofters, on the other hand, were mainly subsistence farmers and many of them were squatters; and it was this section of the population that Leverhulme hoped to develop and recruit. The crofters were poor, but they were used to an independent lifestyle that was both long established and deeply ingrained in their psyche. Nevertheless, Leverhulme planned to entice them into becoming carbon copies of his Lancashire artisans by offering them an attractive alternative to their meagre smallholdings. He did not actively oppose the crofter&#x27;s way of life, but neither did he support it as some thought he, as their patron, ought to have done. When the crofters learned about the money that was being expended on other projects, they began to resent his lack of support for them.

Leverhulme did his utmost to woo the population of Lewis and to make himself – as well as his schemes – popular among all the islanders. This seems to have worked to some extent, but there were other sceptics whose voices were heard in government circles. Robert Munro, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and Donald Murray, the MP for the Western Isles, as well as a number of supporting characters including most of the House of Commons, were anxious to redress past oppression of the Highlanders who had so recently served with outstanding bravery in the First World War.

The Small Landholders (Scotland) Act 1911 had empowered the Scottish Secretary, on behalf of His Majesty&#x27;s Government, to acquire certain farms in the Highlands and Islands by compulsory purchase and to have them divided up to provide more crofts. In 1913, four farms on Lewis had been scheduled for take-over, but the action had been opposed by the proprietor at that time, and when the war with Germany broke out it was left in abeyance. Towards the end of the war, in the summer of 1918, the Scottish Office first proposed to Leverhulme that under the Small Landholders Act, the Board of Agriculture should take possession of certain of his farms and create something fewer than a hundred and fifty crofts. He was against this, even though some local politicians believed that Leverhulme&#x27;s project and the provision of more crofts were not mutually exclusive, but Leverhulme firmly believed that he could greatly improve living standards to an extent that crofting would become a forgotten way of life. He was also impatient with politicians&#x27; machinations and the laborious indolence of the political system that persisted with the &quot;futile land reform&quot; instead of adopting what he considered the most sensible course of action; to forget about new crofts and allow him, in the interests of expediency, to behave like the &#x27;monarch&#x27; of the Western Isles.

Thus, by the beginning of 1919, the positions taken up by those involved were fairly well defined. Robert Munro, himself a Highlander, believed passionately in the reinstatement of the crofts and he also felt strongly that the Imperial Parliament at Westminster was unlikely to tolerate any departure from the implementation of land reform, but he saw no reason why Lewis should not have Leverhulme&#x27;s industrial schemes as well as more crofts. Leverhulme refused to budge, believing that the break-up of his farms would lead to seriously inefficient, probably unsustainable, and ultimately abandoned smallholdings as crofters moved away in search of better incomes. Ranged against this at least ostensibly reasonable prediction was the formidable influence wielded by prospective crofters away fighting in France, as well as by supporters of the Highland League which was politically dedicated to land reform.

In early March 1919, men started to take over Leverhulme&#x27;s farms on Lewis. They drove off the farmers&#x27; livestock, demolished boundary walls, and staked out six-acre plots: by the summer sixteen out of the twenty-two farms on the island had been affected. Expecting Leverhulme&#x27;s approval, the raiders were taken aback when he voiced his complete condemnation of their actions and asked them to withdraw from his land. Some left, but others erected shelters for their families on the stolen plots. Leverhulme was evidently not willing to prosecute ex-servicemen who were trying to secure homes for their families, and it seems unlikely that, under the circumstances, legal action would have succeeded. Instead, he toured Lewis trying to persuade them that their future lay with him and not in the crofting system. They were, however, extremely reluctant to abandon old ways and most of them continued to espouse the crofting way of life.

Attitudes began to harden and polarise, culminating in politicians pressing ahead with land reform and Leverhulme demanding a ten-year moratorium coupled with a thinly veiled threat to withdraw from his schemes. In early 1920, upon his return from a business trip to the US, Leverhulme learned that raiding had continued during his absence. By then, serious financial difficulties were besetting Lever Brothers concerning the disastrous Niger Company, making his decision about the Western Isles project relatively straightforward. With a pressing need to make significant savings, he announced his intention to concentrate his efforts on Stornoway and on Harris, and that all work in the country areas of Lewis would be abandoned forthwith.

The population of Harris was smaller in size and more scattered than that of Lewis. Consequently, Leverhulme&#x27;s plans advanced there with very few problems. With permission from the locals, the fishing village of Obbe was renamed Leverburgh. On 3 September 1923, Viscount Leverhulme, as he had become the previous year, addressed the Stornoway Council and the Lewis District Council at a meeting which he had asked to be specially convened on that date. Lord Leverhulme asked them to take the land and make their system work, but only Stornoway, always on Leverhulme&#x27;s side, accepted the gift, set up the Trust, and to a large extent made it work for the benefit of the town. Left with so much of the Island he no longer wanted, Leverhulme sold off as much as he could, but many of the buyers were interested principally in shooting and fishing. Leverhulme died in May 1925. Very soon thereafter, the Board of Lever Brothers gave orders for all development on Harris to stop, and so Leverhulme&#x27;s scheme for the Western Isles perished with almost nothing achieved there.

== Politics ==
Prior to serving in cabinet, Lever unsuccessfully contested Birkenhead (UK Parliament constituency) in 1892, 1894, 1895, and also lost at Ormskirk (UK Parliament constituency) in 1910. Lever was a lifelong supporter of William Ewart Gladstone and Liberalism. He was invited to contest elections for the Liberal Party. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Wirral constituency between 1906 and 1909 and used his maiden speech in the House of Commons to urge Henry Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s government to introduce a national old age pension, such as the one he provided for his workers. On the recommendation of the Liberal Party, he was created a baronet in 1911 and raised to the peerage as Baron Leverhulme on 21 June 1917, the &quot;hulme&quot; element of his title being in honour of his wife, Elizabeth Hulme.

Lever had been justice of the peace for Cheshire, he was also High Sheriff of Lancashire in 1917. In November 1918 Lord Leverhulme was invited to become Mayor of Bolton though he was not a councillor because the council wanted to honour a &quot;Notable son of the Town&quot; as a mark of the high regard the citizens of Bolton had for him. He was elevated to the viscountcy on 27 November 1922. Also, Lever received the Order of Leopold II.

== Lever&#x27;s homes ==

According to W.P. Jolly, &quot;Of the dozen or so houses that Lever lived in, and upon which he stamped his own mark of reconstruction, the three most important were Thornton Manor, The Hill at Hampstead in London, and The Bungalow at Rivington.&quot; A further building he purchased was Rockhaven in 1899 in Horwich. It was built in 1820 by Richard Brownlow, a lawyer, who later became a recluse. It was acquired by Lever after Brownlow&#x27;s death and was rented out until demolition in 1942, its land was used for coal mining.

=== Thornton Manor, Cheshire ===

In 1888, shortly after the birth of William, his only surviving child, Lever first rented then bought Thornton Manor in Thornton Hough in the Wirral, Cheshire. He subsequently acquired more land in the village and many of its picturesque, but outdated, houses were demolished and replaced with modern homes which were rented to Port Sunlight employees. The village was later provided with community amenities including a school, shops, social establishments and a church. Thornton Manor was restructured, and the gardens greatly extended.

=== The Hill at Hampstead ===

In 1904, Lever purchased The Hill, an Edwardian mansion at Hampstead. It was renamed Inverforth House in 1925 after his death. He rebuilt the house and made additions including a wing on each side of the house, a ballroom and art gallery. In 1911 and 1914 he acquired two neighbouring properties to expand his garden. This led to a dispute with Hampstead Borough Council over Lever&#x27;s intentions to take over a public right of way to join the two plots; an issue that was not resolved to his satisfaction. The Hill was his main home from 1919.

=== The Bungalow at Rivington ===

Suffragette Edith Rigby claimed to have set fire to Leverhulme&#x27;s bungalow at Rivington on 7 July 1913, although it is suspected her confession was false. The property contained a number of valuable paintings and the attack resulted in damage costing £20,000.

== Legacy ==

Lever died at 73 of pneumonia at his home in Hampstead on 7 May 1925. His funeral was attended by 30,000 people. He is buried in the churchyard of Christ Church in Port Sunlight in what was then Cheshire, now Merseyside. He was succeeded by his son, William Lever, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme.

Lever was a major benefactor to his native town, Bolton, where he was made a Freeman of the County Borough in 1902. In 1899, he bought Hall i&#x27; th&#x27; Wood, one time home of Samuel Crompton, and restored it as a museum for the town. He donated of land and landscaped Lever Park in Rivington in 1902. Lever was responsible for the formation of Bolton School after re-endowing Bolton Grammar School and Bolton High School for Girls in 1913. He donated the land for Bolton&#x27;s largest park, Leverhulme Park, in 1914. In 1920 he donated £50 to the Selborne Society campaign to purchase land in west London, as the &quot;Gilbert White Memorial&quot; - it is now known as the Perivale Wood Local Nature Reserve.

Lever endowed a school of tropical medicine at Liverpool University, gave Lancaster House in London to the British nation and endowed the Leverhulme Trust set up to provide funding for education and research, the trust in 2017 became benefactor to Rivington and Blackrod High School and Harper Green School, both becoming Leverhulme Church of England Academies in Bolton. The garden of his former London residence &#x27;The Hill&#x27; in Hampstead, designed by Thomas Mawson, is open to the public and has been renamed Inverforth House. A blue plaque at Inverforth House commemorating Lever was unveiled by his great-granddaughter, Jane Heber-Percy, in 2002.

Lever built many houses in Thornton Hough which became a model village comparable to Port Sunlight and in 1906 built Saint George&#x27;s United Reformed Church. The Lady Lever Art Gallery opened in 1922 and is in the Port Sunlight conservation area. In 1915 Lever acquired a painting entitled &quot;Suspense&quot; by Charles Burton Barber. The painting was previously owned by his competitor, A &amp; F Pears, who used paintings such as &quot;Bubbles&quot; by John Everett Millais to promote its products.

==In literature and popular culture==
Lord Leverhulme&#x27;s Hebridean venture was satirised by Neil Munro in his Erchie MacPherson story &quot;The Coal Famine&quot;, first published in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; of 12th January 1920.

<doc id="1307870" wikidata="Q2319562" url="?curid=1307870" title="Javed Akhtar">
<text>Javed Akhtar (born 17 January 1947) is an Indian screenwriter, lyricist and poet. Known for his work in Hindi cinema, he has won five National Film Awards, and received the Padma Shri in 1999 and the Padma Bhushan in 2007, two of India&#x27;s highest civilian honours.

Akhtar came to recognition in the duo Salim–Javed, and earned his breakthrough as a screenwriter with 1973&#x27;s &quot;Zanjeer&quot;. He went on to write the films &quot;Deewaar&quot; and &quot;Sholay&quot;, both released in 1975; they earned a cult following, and had a significant impact in popular culture. He later earned praise for his work as a lyricist, winning the National Film Award for Best Lyrics five times and the Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist eight times.

Akhtar notably campaigned for the Communist Party of India (CPI) and their candidate in the 2019 Indian general election, and was a member of parliament in Rajya Sabha. For his work, he received the Richard Dawkins Award in 2020.

In 2024, Amazon Prime released a three-part documentary series about the Salim-Javed screenwriting duo, &quot;Angry Young Men&quot;.

==Early life==

Javed Akhtar was born in 1947 in Gwalior. His father Jan Nisar Akhtar was a Bollywood film songwriter and Urdu poet. His paternal grandfather Muztar Khairabadi was a poet as was his grandfather&#x27;s elder brother, Bismil Khairabadi, while his great great grandfather, Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi, was a religious scholar of Islam who declared the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the western colonies. Javed Akhtar&#x27;s original name was Jadoo, taken from a line in a poem written by his father: &quot;Lamha, lamha kisi jadoo ka fasana hoga&quot;. He was given the official name of Javed since it was close to the word &quot;jadoo&quot;. He spent most of his childhood and was schooled in Lucknow. He graduated from Saifiya College in Bhopal.

==Career as scriptwriter==
Initially, in the 1970s, there was generally no concept of having the same writer for the screenplay, story and dialogue, nor were the writers given any credits in the titles. Rajesh Khanna is credited with giving Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar their first chance to become screenplay writers by offering them work in &quot;Haathi Mere Saathi&quot;. Javed Akhtar stated in an interview that one day, he went to Salimsaab and said that Mr. Devar had given him a huge signing amount with which he could complete the payment for his bungalow, Aashirwad. But the film was a remake and the script of the original was far from being satisfactory. &quot;He told us that if we could set right the script, he would make sure we got both money and credit.&quot;

Their first big success was the script for &quot;Andaz&quot; (1971), followed by &quot;Haathi Mere Saathi&quot; (1971) and &quot;Seeta Aur Geeta&quot; (1972). They also had hits with &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat&quot; (1973), &quot;Zanjeer&quot; (1973), &quot;Haath Ki Safai&quot; (1974), &quot;Deewaar&quot; (1975), &quot;Sholay&quot; (1975), &quot;Chacha Bhatija&quot; (1977), &quot;Don&quot; (1978), &quot;Trishul&quot; (1978), &quot;Dostana&quot; (1980), &quot;Kranti&quot; (1981), &quot;Zamana&quot; (1985) and &quot;Mr. India&quot; (1987). They have worked together in 24 films including two Kannada films – &quot;Premada Kanike&quot; and &quot;Raja Nanna Raja&quot;.

Of the 24 films they wrote, 20 were hits. The scripts they wrote, but which were not successful at box office include &quot;Adhikar&quot; (1971), &quot;Aakhri Dao&quot; (1975), &quot;Immaan Dharam&quot; (1977) and &quot;Shaan&quot; (1980). Though they split in 1982, due to ego issues, some of the scripts they wrote were made into hit films later, such as &quot;Zamana&quot; and &quot;Mr. India&quot;. Salim-Javed, many a time described as &quot;the most successful scriptwriters of all-time&quot;, are also noted to be the first scriptwriters in Indian cinema to achieve star status.

== Personal life ==
Akhtar was nominated to the Parliament upper house Rajya Sabha on 16 November 2009.
Akhtar was married to Honey Irani, with whom he had two children, Farhan Akhtar, a film actor, producer, director and Zoya Akhtar, a film writer, director and producer. The father-and-son duo have worked together in films such as &quot;Dil Chahta Hai&quot;, &quot;Lakshya&quot;, &quot;Rock On!!&quot; and &quot;Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara&quot; with Zoya. Farhan was married to Adhuna Akhtar, a hair stylist. Despite having an Islamic upbringing, Akhtar declared himself to be an &quot;equal opportunity atheist&quot; who is against all faiths, and also brought up his children Farhan and Zoya Akhtar as atheists.

Akhtar married Shabana Azmi, the daughter of Urdu poet, Kaifi Azmi and later divorced Irani. Akhtar&#x27;s uncle, Asrar-ul-Haq &quot;Majaz&quot; was also an Urdu poet. His uncle, Ansar Harvani, was a member of the Indian independence movement and an elected Member of Parliament. Akhtar&#x27;s aunt, Hamida Salim, was an Indian author, economist and educator as well.

==Awards and nominations==
Javed was awarded the civilian honour of Padma Shri by the Government of India in 1999, followed by the Padma Bhushan in 2007. In 2013, he received the Sahitya Akademi Award in Urdu, India&#x27;s second highest literary honour, for his poetry collection &quot;Lava&quot;. In 2019, he was conferred with an honorary doctorate (Doctor of Letters) by the Jamia Hamdard University. In 2020 he was awarded the Richard Dawkins Award for being a &quot;powerful force for secularism, reason, and human rights, challenging superstition and intolerance through his work in poetry, screenwriting, and political activism&quot;.

<text>OSRAM Licht AG is a German company that makes electric lights, headquartered in Munich and Premstätten (Austria). OSRAM positions itself as a high-tech photonics company that is increasingly focusing on sensor technology, visualization and treatment by light. The company serves customers in the consumer, automotive, healthcare and industrial technology sectors. The operating company of OSRAM is OSRAM GmbH.

Osram was founded in 1919 by the merger of the lighting businesses of Auergesellschaft, Siemens &amp; Halske and Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG). Osram was a wholly owned subsidiary of Siemens AG from 1978 to 2013. On 5 July 2013, Osram was spun off from Siemens, and the listing of its stock began on Frankfurt Stock Exchange on 8 July 2013. Osram&#x27;s business with conventional light sources was spun off in 2016 under the name Ledvance and sold to a Chinese consortium.

After a bidding war with Bain Capital, Osram was taken over by Austrian company AMS in July 2020. Since then, the company has operated under the name [[AMS Osram]].

The name is derived from &quot;osmium&quot; and &quot;Wolfram&quot;, German for tungsten. Both elements were commonly used for lighting filaments at the time the company was founded.

== History ==


In 1906, the Osram incandescent lamp was developed by Carl Auer von Welsbach. The brand name of Osram was first used in 1906 and registered by the Deutsche Gasglühlicht-Anstalt (also known as Auer-Gesellschaft).
The British General Electric Company imported Osram filaments for their own production of light bulbs. In 1919, Auergesellschaft, Siemens &amp; Halske and Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG) combined their electric-lamp production with the formation of the company Osram.

Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, co-founder William Meinhardt and the other Jewish members of the managing board were forced to step down. During the rule of his successor, Hermann Schlüpmann, organisations close to the Nazi Party, such as DAF, became increasingly influential among the company&#x27;s workforce. In March 1933, Osram funded for a secret campaign fund of German industrialists in support the Nazi Party.

During World War II, Osram used forced labour in their plants in Berlin. Due to the bombing of Berlin, production was partially relocated to eastern German cities from 1942 onward. The production of molybdenum and tungsten products, which were classified as important for the war effort, was outsourced to the city of Plauen. Following arrangements between Osram officials and members of the SS, two subcamps of Flossenbürg concentration camp were installed next to the factory site to secure the company&#x27;s supply of slave labourers. In a subcamp in Leitzmeritz, prisoners were used to build underground facilities as part of the secret project &quot;Richard II&quot; to secure the production of molybdenum and tungsten during air raids. At least 4,500 prisoners died in the camp, while Osram never moved into the space due to the course of war.

In 1993, Osram Sylvania, a North American division, was established with the acquisition of GTE&#x27;s Sylvania lighting division. Osram Sylvania manufactures and markets a wide range of lighting products for homes, business, and vehicles and holds the largest share of the North American lighting market. In fiscal year 2006, the company achieved sales of about 2 billion euros, which comprised 43% of total Osram sales.
In 2019, Osram sold Sylvania to Wesco International, Inc.

In 1998, Osram acquired the lamp business of ECE Industries India for $9.55 million. In 2009, Osram acquired Traxon Technologies. In 2011, Osram acquired Siteco.

On 8 July 2013 Siemens spun Osram off, and Osram listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

On 3 March 2021, ams AG announced that the Domination and Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement (“DPLTA”) between AMS Offer GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMS AG, the parent company of AMS Group, and Osram Licht AG (“Osram”), became effective on that day. The combined company focuses on optical systems and serves the entire value chain including sensing, visualization and illumination, with products ranging from emitters to sensors and software.

==Operations==
Osram is a multinational corporation with headquarters in Munich, with around 34,000 employees throughout the world. Osram has operations in over 120 countries.

In fiscal year 2019, Osram&#x27;s business model was operationally implemented in three business units: Opto Semiconductors, Automotive and Digital.

===Opto Semiconductors===

The Opto Semiconductors Business Unit provides opto semiconductors, which are crucial elements in lighting, visualization, and sensor technology. Osram Opto Semiconductors offers a wide range of LEDs in the low-power, mid-power, high-power, and ultra-high-power classes that are used in general lighting, automotive, consumer, and industrial applications as well as infrared, laser and optical sensors. The main market for these components are the automotive sector, smartphones, wearables, general lighting, lighting for plants, industrial lighting, and projection.

===Automotive===
The Automotive Business Unit develops and produces lamps; light modules; and sensors for auto makers and their suppliers and the spare parts aftermarket.

Up to the beginning of the fiscal year 2019, the automotive and other areas of business comprised the Specialty Lighting Business Unit. As part of a reorganization and the subsequent renaming of the business unit as AM, these other areas of business have been incorporated into the Digital Business Unit.

===Digital===
The Digital Business Unit was established at the start of the fiscal year 2019. It handles all of Osram&#x27;s business activities that use digital technologies.

The former Lighting Solutions Business Unit was dissolved at the start of the fiscal year 2019. Traxon&#x27;s business was incorporated into the new Digital Business Unit. The European luminaire business (Siteco) and the North American luminaire service business are reported as discontinued operations.

==In popular culture==
* German football manager Jupp Heynckes was nicknamed &quot;Osram&quot; because his face would sometimes redden under the stress of matches.

<text>Alfred Frederik Elias Grenander (26 June 1863 – 14 March 1931) was a Swedish architect, who became one of the most prominent engineers during the first building period of the Berlin U-Bahn network in the early twentieth century.

==Biography==
Grenander was born at Skövde in Västra Götaland County, Sweden. He was raised in Stockholm and began studying at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology in 1881. He changed to the &quot;Königliche Technische Hochschule&quot; in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin) in 1885. After his final degree in 1890 he became a site engineer at the construction of the new Reichstag building under the direction of Paul Wallot and continued his career in the architectural office of Alfred Messel.

In 1896 Grenander set up his own business and worked as a designer of the &quot;Hochbahngesellschaft&quot;, an affiliate of Siemens &amp; Halske established in 1897 to build the first U-Bahn elevated railway of Berlin, opened in 1902. Up to 1931, he constructed about 70 U-Bahn stations, many of which have landmark status today. While the first stations were designed in an Art Nouveau (&quot;Jugendstil&quot;) or Neoclassical style, he later preferred a Modern architecture.

Alfred Grenander died in Berlin; he was buried in Skanör med Falsterbo, Sweden. In 2009, the public area in front of Krumme Lanke station in Berlin-Zehlendorf was named in his honour.

<doc id="1307881" wikidata="Q6894778" url="?curid=1307881" title="Moiseev (crater)">
<text>Moiseev is a lunar impact crater that is located just on the far side of the Moon. It lies to the south-southwest of the slightly larger crater Hertz, and north of Saenger. To the southeast lies the irregular crater Al-Khwarizmi.

Moiseev overlies the southern rim of the larger satellite formation Moiseev Z. The crater is not significantly worn, and is marked only by a few tiny craterlets in the interior. The rim is generally circular, but has an outward bulge and a wider interior wall to the west-southwest. There are some structures around the inner eastern wall, while the western inner wall has more of a slumped appearance. At the midpoint of the flattened interior is a formation of low hills forming the crater&#x27;s central peak complex.

==Naming==
The crater is named after Soviet astronomer Nikolay Moiseyev. Prior to naming in 1970 by the IAU, Moiseev was known as &quot;Crater 198&quot;, and Moiseev Z was known as &quot;Crater 197&quot;.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Moiseev.

<doc id="1307886" wikidata="Q3087117" url="?curid=1307886" title="Frederick Greenwood">
<text>Frederick Greenwood (25 March 1830 – 14 December 1909) was an English journalist, editor, and man of letters. He completed Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s novel &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; after her death in 1865.

==Early years==
Born in Kensington, London, he was the oldest of eleven children of James Caer Greenwood, a coach builder, and his wife, Mary Ann, née Fish. He and two brothers – James and Charles, gained reputations as journalists. Frederick started life in a printing house, but at an early age began to write in periodicals. In 1853 he contributed a sketch of Napoleon III to a volume called &quot;The Napoleon Dynasty&quot; (2nd ed., 1855). He also wrote several novels: &quot;The Loves of an Apothecary&quot; (1854), &quot;The Path of Roses&quot; (1859) and (with his brother James) &quot;Under a Cloud&quot; (1860).

To the second number of the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; he contributed &quot;An Essay without End,&quot; and this led to an introduction to Thackeray. In 1862, when Thackeray resigned the editorship of the &quot;Cornhill&quot;, Greenwood became joint editor with G. H. Lewes. In 1864 he was appointed sole editor, a post which he held until 1868. While at the &quot;Cornhill&quot; he wrote an article in which he suggested, to some extent, how Thackeray might have intended to conclude his unfinished work &quot;Denis Duval&quot;. In its pages appeared the &quot;sensation&quot; novel &quot;Margaret Denzil&#x27;s History&quot;, Greenwood&#x27;s most ambitious work of fiction, also published in volume form in 1864.

Frederick Greenwood completed Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;Wives and Daughters&quot; after she died suddenly in 1865.

==&quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;==
Greenwood conceived the idea of an evening newspaper, which, with news, should mainly contain original articles. Public affairs and culture were to be discussed by authoritative figures. He took the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; of 1864 as models. The idea was taken up by George Smith, and the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, named after Thackeray&#x27;s fictional paper in &quot;Pendennis&quot; was launched in February 1865, with Greenwood as editor. Within a few years he became an influential Tory. &quot;No minister in Great Britain,&quot; Mr Gladstone declared, &quot;ever had a more able, a more zealous, a more effective supporter for his policy than Lord Beaconsfield had in Greenwood.&quot;

It was on the suggestion of Greenwood that Beaconsfield purchased in 1875 the Suez Canal shares of the Khedive Ismail; the British government was informed by Greenwood that the shares were for sale and likely to be bought by France. Greenwood waited for the official announcement before publishing the news.

==Later years==
Early in 1880 the &quot;Pall Mall&quot; changed owners, and the new proprietor, Henry Yates Thompson, shifted editorial policy to supporting the Liberal Party. Greenwood at once resigned his editorship, but in May a new paper, the &quot;St James&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, was started for him by Mr Henry Hucks Gibbs (afterwards Lord Aldenham), and Greenwood proceeded to carry on in it the tradition which he had established in the &quot;Pall Mall&quot;. At the &quot;St James&#x27;s&quot; Greenwood remained for over eight years, continuing to exercise a marked influence upon political affairs, notably as a pungent critic of the Gladstone administration (1880–1885) and an independent supporter of Lord Salisbury. His connection with the paper ceased in August 1888, owing to disagreements with the new proprietor, Mr E Steinkopff, who had bought the &quot;St James&#x27;s&quot; at Greenwood&#x27;s own suggestion.

In January 1891 Greenwood brought out a weekly review which he named the &quot;Anti-Jacobin&quot;. It failed, however, to gain public support, the last number appearing in January 1892. In 1893 he published &quot;The Lover&#x27;s Lexicon&quot; and in 1894 &quot;Imagination in Dreams&quot;. He continued to express his views on political and social questions in contributions to newspapers and magazines, writing frequently in the &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;, the &quot;Pall Mall&quot;, &quot;Blackwood&quot;, the &quot;Cornhill&quot;, etc. Towards the end of his life his political views reverted in some respects to the Liberalism of his early days.

In the words of George Meredith Greenwood was not only a great journalist, he had a statesman&#x27;s head. The national interests were always urgent at his heart. He was remarkable for securing for his papers the services of the ablest writers of the day, and for the gift of recognising merit in new writers, such, for instance, as Richard Jefferies and J. M. Barrie. His instinct for capacity in others was as sure as was his journalistic judgment. In 1905, on the occasion of his 75th birthday, a dinner was given in his honour by leading statesmen, journalists, and men of letters (with John Morley—who had succeeded him as editor of the &quot;Pall Mall&quot;—in the chair). In May 1907 he contributed to &quot;Blackwood&quot; an article on &quot;The New Journalism,&quot; in which he drew a sharp contrast between the old and the new conditions under which the work of a newspaper writer is conducted. He belonged to the Garrick Club. He died at Sydenham on 14 December 1909.

<doc id="1307889" wikidata="Q1662654" url="?curid=1307889" title="Infraero">
<text>Empresa Brasileira de Infraestrutura Aeroportuária (abr. Infraero) is a Brazilian government corporation founded in 1973, authorized by Law 5,862, that is responsible for operating the main Brazilian commercial airports. In 2011 Infraero&#x27;s airports carried 179,482,228 passengers, 1,464,484 tons of cargo, and operated 2,893,631 take-offs and landings. Presently it manages 45 airports.

The company is present all over Brazil and employs approximately 23,000 employees and subcontracted workers nationwide. It is headquartered in the Infraero Building, in Brasília, Federal District.

==History==
The company implements a workplan which covers practically all airports managed by it and which generates over 50 thousand jobs all over Brazil. The Brazilian airport infrastructure, which may match to the international standards, is being updated to meet the next years demand.

The works are performed with the company&#x27;s own revenue, mainly generated by the air cargo storage and custom duty, granting of commercial areas in the airports, boarding, landing and stay tariffs, and rendering of communication and air navigation auxiliary services.

On 9 October 2009, it was announced that Infraero will invest in airports abroad: Infraero was invited by the Government of Paraguay to administer Silvio Pettirossi International Airport in Asunción and invited to participate in the privatization of Ruzyně Airport in Prague, Czech Republic, among other investments.

On March 4, 2010, the government of Brazil announced that it would adopt the model of concession to airports. For this reason Infraero would become a concessionary rather than an administrator of the airports that it currently operates. The main consequence is the fact that Infraero will be able to open its capital and obtain resources necessary for infra-structure investments. Another consequence is that municipal or state governments would have it easier to change concessionaries, such as the intention announced on 28 August 2009 by Rosinha Matheus, the Mayor of Campos dos Goytacazes, who requested Infraero the transfer of the administration of Bartolomeu Lysandro Airport to the Municipality. The Minister of Defense, to whom Infraero was subordinate (currently it belongs to Civil Aviation Secretary), announced being in favor of the transfer.

Responding to critiques to the situation of its airports, and in preparation to the several rounds of concession biddings, on May 18, 2011, Infraero released a list evaluating some of its most important airports according to its saturation levels.

==Investments related to the 2014 FIFA World Cup==
On 31 August 2009 Infraero unveiled an ambitious BRL5.3 billion (US$2.8 billion; EUR2.0 billion) investment plan to upgrade airports of ten cities focusing mainly the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup which was held in Brazil, and for the 2016 Summer Olympics, which was held in Rio de Janeiro. Of the twelve cities that held venues, ten received major investments. Natal – Augusto Severo International Airport and Salvador – Dep. Luís Eduardo Magalhães International Airport were excluded because their upgrade works were completed.

The investments were distributed as follows (in BRL million):

==Concessions==
On April 26, 2011, it was confirmed that in order to speed-up much needed renovation and up-grade works, private companies would be granted a concession to commercially exploit some Infraero airports in exchange for the implementation of those works. Listed airports included São Paulo/Guarulhos – Governador André Franco Montoro International Airport, Brasília – Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport, Campinas – Viracopos International Airport, and later Belo Horizonte – Tancredo Neves International Airport and Rio de Janeiro – Galeão/Antonio Carlos Jobim International Airport. The plan was confirmed on May 31, 2011, and it was added that Infraero would retain 49% of the shares of each privatized airport. However, starting in the fourth phase (2017), this obligation ceased to exist.

The concession program was divided into phases, each with its own public bidding.

===First Phase===
The first phase was related to Natal–Gov. Aluízio Alves International Airport. In 1998 Infraero started the planning and construction of the airport. In 2011 the concession of the unfinished facility was auctioned and the winner would have to finish its construction, including the terminal building and control tower. On August 22, 2011, the concession of the airport was won by the Consortium Inframérica, formed by the Brazilian Engineering Group Engevix (50%) and the Argentinean Group Corporación América (50%), which operates 52 airports in seven countries. The concession was for 25 years (with one possible five-year extension) and as part of the agreement Infraero held no shares participation.

===Second Phase===
The second phase was related to the auction that took place on February 6, 2012. The result was: 
* Consortium Inframérica composed by the Brazilian Engineering Group Engevix (50%) and the Argentinean Group Corporación América (50%) won the concession of Brasília–Pres. Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport, which will be explored for a period of 25 years; 
* Consortium Aeroportos Brasil composed by the Brazilian Investments and Funds Society Triunfo (45%), UTC Engineering and Investments Society (45%), and the French airport operator Egis Avia (10%) won the concession of Campinas–Viracopos International Airport, to be explored for 30 years;
* Consortium Invepar–ACSA, also known as GRU Airport, composed by the Brazilian Investments and Funds Society Invepar (90%) and the South African airport operator ACSA (10%) won the concession of São Paulo/Guarulhos–Gov.

<text>Stasys Girėnas (known as Stanley T. Girenas in the US; born Stasys Girskis; October 4, 1893 in Vytogala, Kovno Governorate – July 17, 1933 near Soldin, Germany) was a Lithuanian-American pilot, who died in a non-stop flight attempt with the &quot;Lituanica&quot; from New York City to Kaunas, Lithuania, in 1933.

== Biography ==
Girenas was born in Vytogala, in the Šilalė district of Lithuania, then part of the Kovno Governorate of the Russian Empire. In 1910, when he was 17 years old, he emigrated to the United States, and settled in Chicago. As a young man he worked in a printing house. In 1917, upon the entry of the U.S. into World War I, he enlisted in the United States Army, where he was trained as a mechanic. In 1919, after being honorably discharged, he worked as a cab driver, and at the same time learned to fly. He acquired a plane in 1925. Despite being injured in an air crash, he continued flying and working in civil aviation. In 1931 he won the first prize at the Chicago Air Festival for the best landing of a plane with its engine turned off.

=== Death ===
On July 15, 1933, along with Steponas Darius, he attempted a nonstop flight from New York City, to Kaunas, Lithuania - a total of , in a Bellanca CH-300 Pacemaker airplane named &quot;Lituanica&quot;. After successfully crossing the Atlantic Ocean in 37 hours and 11 minutes, their plane crashed on July 17, 0:36 AM (Berlin Time) by the village of Kuhdamm, near Soldin, Germany (now Pszczelnik, Myślibórz County, Poland). Difficult weather conditions combined with engine defects were the findings of the official investigation. Both aviators were killed in the crash. They had covered a distance of without landing, only short of their final destination.

== Awards and honors ==
* On 18 May 1934, Lithuania issued a set of six airmail stamps, in honor of Captains Girėnas and Darius, and the Lituanica. 
* In New York City, in 1957, the fliers were memorialized with a granite flagstaff showing the pair in bas-relief. The monument is located in Lithuania Square, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
* Asteroid 288961 Stasysgirėnas, discovered by astronomers Kazimieras Černis and Justas Zdanavičius in 2004, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on June 9, 2017 ().

<doc id="1307896" wikidata="Q1142192" url="?curid=1307896" title="Chemically peculiar star">
<text>In astrophysics, chemically peculiar stars (CP stars) are stars with distinctly unusual metal abundances, at least in their surface layers.

==Classification==
Chemically peculiar stars are common among hot main-sequence (hydrogen-burning) stars. These hot peculiar stars have been divided into four main classes on the basis of their spectra, although two classification systems are sometimes used:
* non-magnetic metallic-lined (Am, CP1)
* magnetic (Ap, CP2)
* non-magnetic mercury-manganese (HgMn, CP3)
* helium-weak (He-weak, CP4).

The class names provide a good idea of the peculiarities that set them apart from other stars on or near the main sequence.

The Am stars (CP1 stars) show weak lines of singly ionized Ca and/or Sc, but show enhanced abundances of heavy metals. They also tend to be slow rotators and have an effective temperature between 7000 and .

The Ap stars (CP2 stars) are characterized by strong magnetic fields, enhanced abundances of elements such as Si, Cr, Sr and Eu, and are also generally slow rotators. The effective temperature of these stars is stated to be between 8000 and , but the issue of calculating effective temperatures in such peculiar stars is complicated by atmospheric structure.

The HgMn stars (CP3 stars) are also classically placed within the Ap category, but they do not show the strong magnetic fields associated with classical Ap stars. As the name implies, these stars show increased abundances of singly ionized mercury and manganese. These stars are also very slow rotators, even by the standards of CP stars. The effective temperature range for these stars is quoted at between and .

The He-weak stars (CP4 stars) show weaker He lines than would be expected classically from their observed Johnson &quot;UBV&quot; colours. A rare class of He-weak stars are, paradoxically, the helium-rich or helium-strong stars, with temperatures of –.

==Cause of the peculiarities==
It is generally thought that the peculiar surface compositions observed in these hot main-sequence stars have been caused by processes that happened after the star formed, such as diffusion or magnetic effects in the outer layers of the stars. These processes cause some elements, particularly He, N and O, to &quot;settle&quot; out in the atmosphere into the layers below, while other elements such as Mn, Sr, Y and Zr are &quot;levitated&quot; out of the interior to the surface, resulting in the observed spectral peculiarities. It is assumed that the centers of the stars, and the bulk compositions of the entire star, have more normal chemical abundance mixtures which reflect the compositions of the gas clouds from which they formed. In order for such diffusion and levitation to occur and the resulting layers to remain intact, the atmosphere of such a star must be stable enough to convection that convective mixing does not occur. The proposed mechanism causing this stability is the unusually large magnetic field that is generally observed in stars of this type.

Approximately 5–10% of hot main sequence stars show chemical peculiarities. Of these, the vast majority are Ap (or Bp) stars with strong magnetic fields. Non-magnetic, or only weakly magnetic, chemically peculiar stars mostly fall into the Am or HgMn categories. A much smaller percentage show stronger peculiarities, such as the dramatic under-abundance of iron peak elements in λ Boötis stars.

==&quot;sn&quot; stars==
Another group of stars sometimes considered to be chemically peculiar are the &#x27;sn&#x27; stars. These hot stars, usually of spectral classes B2 to B9, show Balmer lines with sharp (&quot;s&quot;) cores, sharp metallic absorption lines, and contrasting broad (nebulous, &quot;n&quot;) neutral helium absorption lines. These may be combined with the other chemical peculiarities more commonly seen in B-type stars.

It was originally proposed that the unusual helium lines were created in a weak shell of material around the star, but are now thought to be caused by the Stark effect.

==Other stars==
There are also classes of chemically peculiar cool stars (that is, stars with spectral type G or later), but these stars are typically not main-sequence stars. These are usually identified by the name of their class or some further specific label. The phrase &quot;chemically peculiar star&quot; without further specification usually means a member of one of the hot main sequence types described above. Many of the cooler chemically peculiar stars are the result of the mixing of nuclear fusion products from the interior of the star to its surface; these include most of the carbon stars and S-type stars. Others are the result of mass transfer in a binary star system; examples of these include the barium stars and some S stars.

==Companions==
There are very few reports of exoplanets whose host stars are chemically peculiar stars. The young variable star HR 8799, which hosts four directly imaged massive planets, belongs to the group of λ Boötis stars. Similarly, the binary star HIP 79098, whose primary is a mercury-manganese star, was found via direct imaging to have a substellar companion, possibly a brown dwarf or a gas giant.

<doc id="1307902" wikidata="Q526154" url="?curid=1307902" title="Khazar Correspondence">
<text>The Khazar Correspondence is a set of documents, which are alleged to date from the 950s or 960s, and to be letters between Hasdai ibn Shaprut, foreign secretary to the Caliph of Cordoba, and Joseph Khagan of the Khazars. The correspondence is one of only a few documents attributed to a Khazar author, and potentially one of only a small number of primary sources on Khazar history. 

The authenticity of the correspondence has been challenged, on the grounds that it has little in common with the otherwise attested chronology, language, borders and economy of the Khazars at the time.

Ostensibly it gives both account of the Khazar conversion to Judaism and of its progress in subsequent generations, as well as potentially showing that within a generation of the fall of the Khazar empire in 969, the Khazar state was still militarily powerful and received tribute from several polities.

==Background==
The alleged correspondence originated with Hasdai ibn Shaprut, foreign secretary to Abd ar-Rahman III, the Umayyad Caliph of Cordoba and al-Andalus. A man of extensive contacts and virtually unlimited resources, Hasdai is said to have learned of the existence of the Khazars from Khorasani merchants. His ignorance of the Khazar state is odd, and may even have been disingenuous, either on the part of a potential forger, or Joseph&#x27;s statements to the effect that there had been communications between the two communities in the past. 

Hasdai&#x27;s first messenger is said to have found his way to Constantinople, where Byzantine authorities refused to permit him to proceed further. He is said to have returned, possibly taking the so-called Schechter Letter (penned by a Khazar and possibly intended for Hasdai) back with him. Eventually Hasdai&#x27;s letter is said to have been given to Jews attached to a Croat embassy, and reached Khazaria via yet another messenger, Isaac ben Eliezer of (Germany).

Joseph&#x27;s alleged reply gives an account of Khazar history and of its current ( 960) sociopolitical and economic status. He further invites Hasdai to come to Khazaria, an invitation that Hasdai probably never accepted. The correspondence has survived in three slightly variant versions over the centuries.

Historian Peter Benjamin Golden wrote that &quot;Dunlop and most recently Golb have demonstrated that Hasdai&#x27;s letter, Joseph&#x27;s response (dating perhaps from the 950s) and the &#x27;Cambridge Document&#x27; are, indeed, authentic.&quot;

Historian Shaul Stampfer has questioned the authenticity of the letter said to have been received from the Khazar king, citing numerous linguistic and geographic oddities amid a flourishing of pseudo-historiographic texts and forgeries in medieval Spain. The text, written in literary Hebrew with many Arabic touches, offers a chronology hundreds of years off the actual dates of the Khazar kingdom; borders very different from that which it held at the time; and an economic and agricultural situation far removed from the realities at the time. Authenticity of the conversion story in the letter was dismissed by the early 12th century Talmudic scholar Rabbi Judah of Barcelona. Stampfer writes that a &quot;similar pseudo-historiographic Muslim text from the time of Hasdai ibn Shaprut is quite similar to the correspondence attributed to him in its concern with buttressing identity.&quot; Such a legend would have been of use to the emerging Jewish aristocracy to show that biblical promises of Jewish kingship were extant.

==Text==

===Hasdai&#x27;s letter to King Joseph===

:I, Hasdai, son of Isaac, son of Ezra, belonging to the exiled Jews of Jerusalem in Sepharad, a servant of my lord the King, bow to the earth before him and prostrate myself towards the abode of your Majesty from a distant land. I rejoice in your tranquility and magnificence and stretch forth my hands to God in heaven that He may prolong your reign in Israel...

:Praise be to the beneficent God for His mercy towards me! Kings of the earth, to whom his [ Abd-ar-Rahman&#x27;s ] magnificence and power are known, bring gifts to him, conciliating his favor by costly presents, such as the King of the Franks, the King of the Gebalim, who are Germans, the King of Constantinople, and others. All their gifts pass through my hands, and I am charged with making gifts in return. [Ibn Shaprut, who knew several languages, received these embassies.] Let my lips express praise to the God of Heaven, who so far extends His loving kindness towards me, without any merit of my own, but in the fullness of His mercies!

:I always ask the ambassadors of these monarchs who bring gifts about our brethren the Israelites, the remnant of the captivity, whether they have heard anything concerning the deliverance of those who have languished in bondage and have found no rest. [He was anxious to know if the &quot;Ten Lost Tribes&quot; existed as an independent Hebrew state anywhere.]

:At length mercantile emissaries of Khorasan [a land southeast of the Caspian Sea in modern north Iran] told me that there is a kingdom of Judah which is called al-Khazar. But I did not believe these words for I thought that they told me such things to procure my goodwill and favor. I was therefore wondering, till the ambassadors of Constantinople came [between 944 and 949] with presents and a letter from their king to our king, and I interrogated them concerning this matter,

:They answered me: &quot;It is quite true, and the name of that kingdom is al-Khazar. It is a fifteen days&#x27; journey by sea from Constantinople, but by land many nations intervene between us; the name of the king now reigning is Joseph; ships sometimes come from their country to ours bringing fish, skins, and wares of every kind [The Khazars, great traders, got their wares from the Rus to the north.] The men are our confederates and are honored by us; there is communication between us by embassies and mutual gifts; they are very powerful; they maintain numerous armies with which they occasionally engage in expeditions.&quot; When I heard this report I was encouraged, my hands were strengthened, and my hope was confirmed. Thereupon I bowed down and adored the God of heaven. [Hasdai was happy: Christians could no longer say the Jews were without a country as a punishment for their rejection of Jesus.]...

:I pray for the health of my lord the King, of his family, and of his house, and that his throne may be established for ever. Let his days and his sons&#x27; days be prolonged in the midst of Israel!

===King Joseph&#x27;s reply===
*&quot;THE LETTER OF JOSEPH THE KING, SON OF AARON THE KING, THE TURK-MAY HIS CREATOR PRESERVE HIM TO THE HEAD OF THE ASSEMBLY, HASDAI, THE SON OF ISAAC, SON OF EZRA&quot;

...I wish to inform you that your beautifully phrased letter was given us by Isaac, son of Eliezer, a Jew of the land of Germany [Isaac carried it through Germany, Hungary, and Kievan Rus to Khazaria.] You made us happy and we are delighted with your understanding and wisdom... Let us, therefore, renew the diplomatic relations that once obtained between our fathers, and let us transmit this heritage to our children. [Joseph believed the Khazars had once had diplomatic relations with the Spanish Arabs.]

You ask us also in your epistle: &quot;Of what people, of what family, and of what tribe are you?&quot; Know that we are descended from Japheth, through his son Togarmah. [In Jewish literature Togarmah is the father of all the Turks.] I have found in the genealogical books of my ancestors that Togarmah had ten sons. These are their names: the eldest was Ujur, the second Tauris, the third Avar, the fourth Uauz, the fifth Bizal, the sixth Tarna, the seventh Kozar, the eighth Janur, the ninth Bulgar, the tenth Sawir. [These are the mythical founders of tribes that once lived in the neighborhood of the Black and Caspian Seas.] I am a descendant of Khazar, the seventh son.

I have a record that although our fathers were few in number, the Holy One blessed be He [this is a common name for God], gave them strength, power, and might so that they were able to carry on war after war with many nations who were more powerful and numerous than they. By the help of God they drove them out and took possession of their country. Upon some of them they have imposed forced labor even to this very day. The land [along the Volga ] in which I now live was formerly occupied by the Bulgars. Our ancestors, the Khazars, came and fought with them, and, although these Bulgars were as numerous as the sand on the shores of the sea [a reference to the Book of Joshua], they could not withstand the Khazars. So they left their country and fled while the Khazars pursued them as far as the Danube River. Up to this very day the Bulgars camp along the Danube and are close to Constantinople. The Khazars have occupied their land up till now.

After this, several generations passed until a certain King arose whose name was Bulan. He was a wise and God-fearing man, trusting in his Creator with all his heart. He expelled the wizards and idolaters from the land and took refuge in the shadow of his wings ... After this his fame was spread broadcast. The king of the Byzantines and the Arabs who had heard of him sent their envoys and ambassadors with great riches and many great presents to the King as well as some of their wise men with the object of converting him to their own religion. [The Byzantines and Arabs hoped to stop the raids of the Khazars by converting them and later make them allies through shared faith.]

But the King-may his soul be bound up in the bundle of life [a standard burial phrase for Jews] With the Lord his God-being wise, sent for a learned Israelite. the King searched, inquired, and investigated carefully and brought the sages together that they might argue about their respective religions. Each of them refuted, however, the arguments of his opponent so that they could not agree. When the King saw this he said to them: &quot;Go home, but return to me on the third day…&quot;

On the third day he called all the sages together and said to them. &quot;Speak and argue with one another and make clear to me which is the best religion.&quot; They began to dispute with one another without arriving at any results until the King said to the Christian priest &quot;What do you think? Of the religion of the Jews and the Muslims, which is to be preferred?&quot; The priest answered: &quot;The religion of the Israelites is better than that of the Muslims.&quot;

The King then asked the qadi: &quot;What do you say? Is the religion of the Israelites, or that of the Christians preferable?&quot; The qadi answered: &quot;The religion of the Israelites is preferable.&quot;

Upon this the King said: &quot;If this is so, you both have admitted with your own mouths that the religion of the Israelites is better Wherefore, trusting in the mercies of God and the power of the Almighty, I choose the religion of Israel, that is, the religion of Abraham. If that God in whom I trust, and in the shadow of whose wings I find refuge, will aid me, He can give me without labor the money, the gold, and the silver which you have promised me. As for you all, go now in peace to your land.&quot;

From that time on the Almighty helped Bulan, fortified him, and strengthened him. He circumcised himself, his servants, attendants, and all his people. [Arabic sources say the royal family and nobility became Jews, but most of the commoners did not.][?] Then Bulan sent for and brought from all places wise men of Israel who interpreted the Torah for him and arranged the precepts in order, and up to this very day we have been subject to this religion. May God&#x27;s name be blessed and may His remembrance be exalted for ever!

Since that day, when my fathers entered into this religion, the God of Israel has humbled all of their enemies, subjecting every folk and tongue round about them, whether Christian, Muslim, or pagan. No one has been able to stand before them to this day [about 960]. All of them are tributary. [But only about ten years later Joseph was defeated by Sviatoslav I of Kiev, 969.]

After the days of Bulan there arose one of his descendants, a king Obadiah by name [the name means &quot;God&#x27;s servant&quot;], who reorganized the kingdom and established the Jewish religion properly and correctly. He built synagogues and yeshivot, brought in Jewish scholars, and rewarded them with gold and silver. [The Jewish scholars could have come from Baghdad and Constantinople.] They explained to him the Bible, Mishnah, Talmud and the order of divine services. The King was a man who revered and loved the Torah. He was one of the true servants of God. May the Divine Spirit give him rest!

He was succeeded by Hezekiah, his son; next to him was Manasseh, his son; next to him was Hanukkah, the brother of Obadiah; next Isaac, his son; afterwards, his son Zebulun; then his son Moses; then his son Nissi; then his son Aaron; then his son Menahem; then his son Benjamin; then his son Aaron II; and I, Joseph, the son of Aaron the King, am King, the son of a King, and the descendant of kings. No stranger can occupy the throne of my ancestors: the son succeeds the father. This has been our custom and the custom of our forefathers since they have come into existence. May it be the gracious will of Him who appoints all kings that the throne of my kingdom shall endure to all eternity.

You have also asked me about the affairs of my country and the extent of my empire. I wish to inform you that I dwell by the banks of the river known as the Itil [Volga]. At the mouth of the river lies the Caspian Sea. The headwaters of the river turn eastward, a journey of four months distance.

Alongside the river dwell many tribes in cities and towns, in open as well as fortified places... Bear in mind that I dwell at the delta of the Itil and, by God&#x27;s help, I guard the mouth of the river and do not permit the Rus who come in ships to enter into the Caspian so as to get at the Muslims. Nor do I allow any of their [the Muslims&#x27;] enemies who come by land to penetrate as far as Derbend [Derbend, an Arab city, was the gate through which the nomads of eastern and southern Europe hoped to rush through and raid the rich towns of Asia Minor.] I have to wage war with them, for if I would give them any chance at all they would lay waste the whole land of the Muslims as far as Baghdad...

You have also asked me about the place where I live. I wish to inform you that, by the grace of God, I dwell alongside this river on which there are situated three capital cities. The queen dwells in one of them; it is my birthplace. It is quite large, built round like a circle, the diameter of which is fifty parasangs. [The King lived in an island in the Volga; there were also towns on both banks.]

Jews, Christians, and Moslems live in the second city. Besides these there are many slaves of all nations in it. It is of medium size, eight square parasangs in length and breadth.

In the third I reside with my princes, officers, servants, cupbearers and those who are close to me. It is round in shape and its diameter is three parasangs. The river flows within its walls. This is my residence during the winter. From the month of Nisan [March–April] on we leave the city and each one goes forth to his vineyards, fields and to his work...

You mention in your letter that you yearn to see my face. I also would very much like to see your pleasant countenance and the rare beauty of your wisdom and greatness. Would that it were according to your word. If it were granted me to be associated with you and to behold your honored, charming, and pleasant countenance then you would be as my father and I as your son. According to your command would all my people be ruled, and according to your order and discreet counsel would I conduct all my affairs. Farewell.

==Khazars in Spain==

At least some Khazar rabbinical students appear to have studied in Spain. Abraham ibn Daud of Toledo, in his &quot;Book of Tradition&quot; (1161), writes:

&quot;You will find the communities of Israel spread abroad... as far as Dailam and the river Itil where live Khazar peoples who became proselytes. The Khazar king Joseph sent a letter to Hasdai ibn-Shaprut and informed him that he and all his people followed the rabbinical faith. We have seen descendants of the Khazars in Toledo, students of the wise, and they have told us that the remnant of them is of the rabbinical belief.&quot;

<doc id="1307906" wikidata="Q1631067" url="?curid=1307906" title="Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels">
<text>The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (), informally known as the COLA or the Los Angeles Cathedral (), is the metropolitan cathedral of the Roman Catholic Church in Los Angeles, California, United States. It opened in 2002 and serves as the mother church for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, as well as the seat of Archbishop José Horacio Gómez.

The structure replaced the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, which was severely damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Under Roger Cardinal Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles, Our Lady of the Angels was begun in 1998 and formally dedicated on September 2, 2002. There was considerable controversy over both its deconstructivist and modern design, costs incurred in its construction and furnishing, and the archdiocese&#x27;s decision to build a crypt under the cathedral.

The cathedral is named in honor of the Virgin Mary under the patronal title of &quot;Our Lady of the Angels&quot;, echoing the full name of the original settlement of Los Angeles (, or &quot;The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels&quot;). The cathedral is widely known for enshrining the relics of Saint Vibiana and tilma piece of Our Lady of Guadalupe. It is the mother church to approximately five million professed Catholics in the archdiocese.

==History==
The Cathedral of Saint Vibiana had served as the cathedral of the Los Angeles see since its completion in 1876. Soon after its completion, the diocese noted it to be of inferior construction quality and also too small for Los Angeles&#x27; rapidly growing population. In 1904, Bishop Thomas James Conaty gained permission from the Holy See to build a new cathedral to be named after Our Lady of the Angels. However, an economic downturn in 1907 put a stop to the project; a Catholic parish church was later built on the site. In the 1940s, plans were drawn up for a new cathedral on Wilshire Boulevard that would seat 3,000 people, and in 1945 Archbishop John Joseph Cantwell announced that the Holy See approved the name &quot;Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels&quot;. That cathedral was never built, however, as Cantwell died in 1947 and his successor, James Francis McIntyre, decided instead that building new parish churches and schools in the expanding metropolis was a more pressing need for the archdiocese. McIntyre gained permission from donors to redirect money donated for the Cantwell cathedral fund to those needs.

The 1994 Northridge earthquake severely damaged the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana, which led the archdiocese to close the cathedral due to safety concerns. In January 1995 the archdiocese announced plans to build a new cathedral on the Saint Vibiana site, plans which necessitated the demolition of the old cathedral. This led to a lengthy legal battle between the archdiocese and preservationists, who argued that the cathedral was a city landmark and that it should be either incorporated into the new cathedral or otherwise saved. The archdiocese contended that restoring the old cathedral to carry out its functions safely would cost $18–20 million, and had not received any pledges or donations for this purpose.

This legal battle prompted the archdiocese to look to build the cathedral on a new site. In December 1996, the archdiocese announced it was purchasing a site between Temple Street and the Hollywood Freeway from Los Angeles County at a cost of $10.85 million. The archdiocese chose to retain the &quot;Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels&quot; name approved by the Vatican in the 1940s. The initially proposed budget for the project was $150 million, rising to a final cost of $189.7 million. The construction was supervised by Father Richard S. Vosko, a liturgical design consultant and priest of the Diocese of Albany who has overseen the design and renovation of numerous churches and cathedrals in the United States. Construction began in 1998 and was completed in September 2002.

==Design==
The architect was Pritzker Prize-winning Spaniard Rafael Moneo. Using elements of postmodern architecture, the church and the Cathedral Center feature a series of acute and obtuse angles while avoiding right angles. Contemporary statuary and appointments decorate the complex. Prominent of these appointments are the bronze doors and the statue called &quot;The Virgin Mary&quot;, all adorning the entrance and designed by Robert Graham. Other features include three fountains and a bronze sculpture by Johnny Bear Contreras dedicated as a Native American memorial. The building is equipped with solar panels for generating 15% of its electricity.

In addition to the church, the cathedral grounds also include a mausoleum, gift shop, cafe, children&#x27;s garden, conference center, and clergy residences. The relics of Saint Vibiana are interred in the mausoleum, as are the remains of several past bishops, archbishops, and auxiliary bishops of Los Angeles. The size of the cathedral is .

==Criticism==
Roger Cardinal Mahony&#x27;s decision to build a new cathedral utilizing contemporary architecture drew criticisms from those who preferred the gothic revival stylings typical of preceding centuries. In actuality, the cathedral&#x27;s architectural design was selected from a pool of 38 submissions from international architectural firms as far away as Japan, Germany, Spain and England, by a blue-ribbon jury of experts from the J. Paul Getty Trust, California Institute of the Arts, UCLA, USC, Harvard and the American Academy in Rome.
Others argued that a church of that size and expense was unnecessary, overly-elaborate and that the money could have been better spent on social programs, suggesting that either St. Vincent Church on West Adams Boulevard or St. Basil Church on Wilshire Boulevard, despite their smaller size, could perform the functions required of a cathedral with minimal additional cost.

Cardinal Mahoney reiterated his pledge for no parish-based appeal to finance the cathedral construction, and urged major donors to the cathedral not to cut back on their current or future charitable giving in order to continue outreach efforts to the poor at the same time. To keep the record straight, a resume of the total construction costs was released to the press. Avoiding any fundraising from local parishes and devoting 24 hours per week in contacting actual and potential donors, the cardinal described his cathedral project in some of his letters as follows:
&quot;Historically, cathedrals have defined their eras, creating a legacy of enduring and innovative architectural designs. They have served as a focal point for artistic and religious expression through their acquisition from local artisans of the adornments that distinguish and enhance the structure, and through the central role they have played in preserving and expanding the spiritual and liturgical teachings that define the Catholic faith. . . . This project will serve a vital role in our society - contributing to the architectural, religious and cultural persona of downtown Los Angeles&quot;.

In response to protests staged during the construction of the cathedral, the cardinal&#x27;s editorial for the Los Angeles Times, dated October 19, 1998, stated:
&quot;The Catholic Worker and others shortchange the poor when they adopt the stance that the Church should be attentive only to the material concerns of the needy. This is out of step with Church history and with the teaching of Jesus, who said that people do not live by bread alone. There are various kinds of poverty, of which material poverty is but one.&quot;
Entities within the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, such as Catholic Charities, Together in Mission, and the Catholic Education Foundation, are responsible for funneling funds that help to feed, clothe, house, educate and provide healthcare for the poor.

==Organ==
The organ is Opus 75 of Dobson Pipe Organ Builders of Lake City, Iowa, and is a 105 rank four-manual instrument that incorporates pipes from the 1929 Wangerin organ of St. Vibiana&#x27;s Cathedral. The St. Vibiana instrument had been rebuilt in 1988 by Austin Organs. The Dobson instrument has a total of 6,019 pipes and was dedicated in 2003. It is the 89th largest pipe organ in North America and the 143rd largest in the world. The organ case is approximately high, and is located approximately above the floor. To meet earthquake-stability requirements, the pipes and case are supported by a massive internal steel frame.

==Mausoleum==
The cathedral features a mausoleum in its lower level, containing 1,270 crypts and 4,746 columbarium niches for burials. Proceeds from the sale of memorials and burial spaces are placed in an endowment fund to support the cathedral.

All past ordinaries of the archdiocese are memorialized in the mausoleum, including a future burial site for Cardinal Roger Mahony, and the remains of several ordinaries and auxiliary bishops who died before the cathedral was built were transferred there. The tomb of Saint Vibiana was transferred to the cathedral from its previous location above the altar at the Cathedral of Saint Vibiana; the tomb is the centerpiece of the St. Vibiana Chapel located adjacent to the mausoleum.

The crypt mausoleum features a number of stained glass windows that were originally installed in Saint Vibiana&#x27;s Cathedral. This idea was suggested by Mario Agustin Locsin, a renowned Liturgical Artist and consultant on the renovation. The old cathedral windows were restored and two new windows featuring guardian angels created by the Judson Studios were placed at the entrance to the crypt mausoleum.

<text>Jozef Lenárt (3 April 1923 – 11 February 2004) was a Slovak politician who was the prime minister of Czechoslovakia from 1963 to 1968.

==Life and career==
Born in Liptovská Porúbka, Slovakia, he graduated from a chemistry high school and worked for the Baťa company. He became a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (&quot;KSČ&quot;) and of the Communist Party of Slovakia (&quot;KSS&quot;).

Lenart was a member of the federal parliament (whose name changed several times) from 1960 to 1990, and was Speaker of the Slovak National Council from 1962 to 1963. He was also a member from 1971 to (?)1990. He served as Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia between 1963 and 1968.

Although ethnically Slovak, he became a Czech citizen after the country split in 1993.

On the basis of insufficient evidence, on 23 September 2002 Lenárt was acquitted of treason charges (along with his co-defendant Miloš Jakeš), related to his handling (or lack thereof) of the Prague Spring events in 1968. He was accused of attending a meeting at the Soviet embassy in Prague on the day after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion, planning to establish a new &quot;workers and farmers&#x27;&quot; government.

Jozef Lenárt was one of the most resilient figures in Czechoslovakia&#x27;s communist hierarchy, occupying one post or another in the leadership for no less than a quarter of the century. That achievement was all the more remarkable because his career at the top straddled a succession of regimes and several abrupt changes in policy.

He died in Prague in 2004.

<doc id="1307911" wikidata="Q799897" url="?curid=1307911" title="Bootstrap aggregating">
<text>Bootstrap aggregating, also called bagging (from bootstrap aggregating) or bootstrapping, is a machine learning (ML) ensemble meta-algorithm designed to improve the stability and accuracy of ML classification and regression algorithms. It also reduces variance and overfitting. Although it is usually applied to decision tree methods, it can be used with any type of method. Bagging is a special case of the ensemble averaging approach.

==Description of the technique==
Given a standard training set formula_1 of size formula_2, bagging generates formula_3 new training sets formula_4, each of size formula_5, by sampling from formula_1 uniformly and with replacement. By sampling with replacement, some observations may be repeated in each formula_4. If formula_8, then for large formula_2 the set formula_4 is expected to have the fraction (1 - 1/&quot;e&quot;) (~63.2%) of the unique samples of formula_1, the rest being duplicates. This kind of sample is known as a bootstrap sample. Sampling with replacement ensures each bootstrap is independent from its peers, as it does not depend on previous chosen samples when sampling. Then, formula_3 models are fitted using the above bootstrap samples and combined by averaging the output (for regression) or voting (for classification).

Bagging leads to &quot;improvements for unstable procedures&quot;, which include, for example, artificial neural networks, classification and regression trees, and subset selection in linear regression. Bagging was shown to improve preimage learning. On the other hand, it can mildly degrade the performance of stable methods such as &quot;k&quot;-nearest neighbors.

== Process of the algorithm ==

=== Key Terms ===
There are three types of datasets in bootstrap aggregating. These are the original, bootstrap, and out-of-bag datasets. Each section below will explain how each dataset is made except for the original dataset. The original dataset is whatever information is given.

=== Creating the bootstrap dataset ===
The bootstrap dataset is made by randomly picking objects from the original dataset. Also, it must be the same size as the original dataset. However, the difference is that the bootstrap dataset can have duplicate objects. Here is a simple example to demonstrate how it works along with the illustration below:

Suppose the original dataset is a group of 12 people. Their names are Emily, Jessie, George, Constantine, Lexi, Theodore, John, James, Rachel, Anthony, Ellie, and Jamal.

By randomly picking a group of names, let us say our bootstrap dataset had James, Ellie, Constantine, Lexi, John, Constantine, Theodore, Constantine, Anthony, Lexi, Constantine, and Theodore. In this case, the bootstrap sample contained four duplicates for Constantine, and two duplicates for Lexi, and Theodore.

=== Creating the out-of-bag dataset ===
The out-of-bag dataset represents the remaining people who were not in the bootstrap dataset. It can be calculated by taking the difference between the original and the bootstrap datasets. In this case, the remaining samples who were not selected are Emily, Jessie, George, Rachel, and Jamal. Keep in mind that since both datasets are sets, when taking the difference the duplicate names are ignored in the bootstrap dataset. The illustration below shows how the math is done:

=== Application ===
Creating the bootstrap and out-of-bag datasets is crucial since it is used to test the accuracy of ensemble learning algorithms like random forest. For example, a model that produces 50 trees using the bootstrap/out-of-bag datasets will have a better accuracy than if it produced 10 trees. Since the algorithm generates multiple trees and therefore multiple datasets the chance that an object is left out of the bootstrap dataset is low. The next few sections talk about how the random forest algorithm works in more detail.

===Creation of Decision Trees ===
The next step of the algorithm involves the generation of decision trees from the bootstrapped dataset. To achieve this, the process examines each gene/feature and determines for how many samples the feature&#x27;s presence or absence yields a positive or negative result. This information is then used to compute a confusion matrix, which lists the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives of the feature when used as a classifier. These features are then ranked according to various classification metrics based on their confusion matrices. Some common metrics include estimate of positive correctness (calculated by subtracting false positives from true positives), measure of &quot;goodness&quot;, and information gain. These features are then used to partition the samples into two sets: those that possess the top feature, and those that do not.

The diagram below shows a decision tree of depth two being used to classify data. For example, a data point that exhibits Feature 1, but not Feature 2, will be given a &quot;No&quot;. Another point that does not exhibit Feature 1, but does exhibit Feature 3, will be given a &quot;Yes&quot;.

This process is repeated recursively for successive levels of the tree until the desired depth is reached. At the very bottom of the tree, samples that test positive for the final feature are generally classified as positive, while those that lack the feature are classified as negative. These trees are then used as predictors to classify new data.

===Random Forests ===
The next part of the algorithm involves introducing yet another element of variability amongst the bootstrapped trees. In addition to each tree only examining a bootstrapped set of samples, only a small but consistent number of unique features are considered when ranking them as classifiers. This means that each tree only knows about the data pertaining to a small constant number of features, and a variable number of samples that is less than or equal to that of the original dataset. Consequently, the trees are more likely to return a wider array of answers, derived from more diverse knowledge. This results in a random forest, which possesses numerous benefits over a single decision tree generated without randomness. In a random forest, each tree &quot;votes&quot; on whether or not to classify a sample as positive based on its features. The sample is then classified based on majority vote. An example of this is given in the diagram below, where the four trees in a random forest vote on whether or not a patient with mutations A, B, F, and G has cancer. Since three out of four trees vote yes, the patient is then classified as cancer positive.

Because of their properties, random forests are considered one of the most accurate data mining algorithms, are less likely to overfit their data, and run quickly and efficiently even for large datasets. They are primarily useful for classification as opposed to regression, which attempts to draw observed connections between statistical variables in a dataset. This makes random forests particularly useful in such fields as banking, healthcare, the stock market, and e-commerce where it is important to be able to predict future results based on past data. One of their applications would be as a useful tool for predicting cancer based on genetic factors, as seen in the above example.

There are several important factors to consider when designing a random forest. If the trees in the random forests are too deep, overfitting can still occur due to over-specificity. If the forest is too large, the algorithm may become less efficient due to an increased runtime. Random forests also do not generally perform well when given sparse data with little variability. However, they still have numerous advantages over similar data classification algorithms such as neural networks, as they are much easier to interpret and generally require less data for training. As an integral component of random forests, bootstrap aggregating is very important to classification algorithms, and provides a critical element of variability that allows for increased accuracy when analyzing new data, as discussed below.

== Improving Random Forests and Bagging ==
While the techniques described above utilize random forests and bagging (otherwise known as bootstrapping), there are certain techniques that can be used in order to improve their execution and voting time, their prediction accuracy, and their overall performance. The following are key steps in creating an efficient random forest:

# Specify the maximum depth of trees: Instead of allowing the random forest to continue until all nodes are pure, it is better to cut it off at a certain point in order to further decrease chances of overfitting.
# Prune the dataset: Using an extremely large dataset may create results that are less indicative of the data provided than a smaller set that more accurately represents what is being focused on.
#* Continue pruning the data at each node split rather than just in the original bagging process.
# Decide on accuracy or speed: Depending on the desired results, increasing or decreasing the number of trees within the forest can help. Increasing the number of trees generally provides more accurate results while decreasing the number of trees will provide quicker results.

== Algorithm (classification) ==

For classification, use a training set formula_1, Inducer formula_14 and the number of bootstrap samples formula_3 as input. Generate a classifier formula_16 as output

# Create formula_3 new training sets formula_4, from formula_1 with replacement
# Classifier formula_20 is built from each set formula_4 using formula_14 to determine the classification of set formula_4
# Finally classifier formula_16 is generated by using the previously created set of classifiers formula_20 on the original dataset formula_1, the classification predicted most often by the sub-classifiers formula_20 is the final classification 
== Example: ozone data ==
To illustrate the basic principles of bagging, below is an analysis on the relationship between ozone and temperature (data from Rousseeuw and Leroy (1986), analysis done in R).

The relationship between temperature and ozone appears to be nonlinear in this dataset, based on the scatter plot. To mathematically describe this relationship, LOESS smoothers (with bandwidth 0.5) are used. Rather than building a single smoother for the complete dataset, 100 bootstrap samples were drawn. Each sample is composed of a random subset of the original data and maintains a semblance of the master set&#x27;s distribution and variability. For each bootstrap sample, a LOESS smoother was fit. Predictions from these 100 smoothers were then made across the range of the data. The black lines represent these initial predictions. The lines lack agreement in their predictions and tend to overfit their data points: evident by the wobbly flow of the lines.

By taking the average of 100 smoothers, each corresponding to a subset of the original dataset, we arrive at one bagged predictor (red line). The red line&#x27;s flow is stable and does not overly conform to any data point(s).

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

Advantages:
* Many weak learners aggregated typically outperform a single learner over the entire set, and have less overfit
* Reduces variance in high-variance low-bias weak learner, which can improve efficiency (statistics)
* Can be performed in parallel, as each separate bootstrap can be processed on its own before aggregation.

Disadvantages:
* For a weak learner with high bias, bagging will also carry high bias into its aggregate
* Loss of interpretability of a model.
* Can be computationally expensive depending on the dataset.

== History ==
The concept of bootstrap aggregating is derived from the concept of bootstrapping which was developed by Bradley Efron.
Bootstrap aggregating was proposed by Leo Breiman who also coined the abbreviated term &quot;bagging&quot; (bootstrap aggregating). Breiman developed the concept of bagging in 1994 to improve classification by combining classifications of randomly generated training sets. He argued, &quot;If perturbing the learning set can cause significant changes in the predictor constructed, then bagging can improve accuracy&quot;.

<text>The Truro River () is a river in the city of Truro in Cornwall, England, UK. It is the product of the convergence of the two rivers named Kenwyn and Allen which run under the city: the Truro River (named after the city) flows into the River Fal, estuarial waters where wildlife is abundant, and then out into the Carrick Roads. The river is navigable up to Truro.

The river valleys form a bowl surrounding the city on the north, east and west and open to the Truro River in the south. The fairly steep-sided bowl in which Truro is located, along with high precipitation swelling the rivers and a spring tide in the River Fal, were major causes of flooding in 1988 which caused large amounts of damage to the city centre. Since then, flood defences have been constructed around the city, including an emergency dam at New Mill on the River Kenwyn and a tidal barrier on the Truro River, to prevent future problems. The valley of the Tresillian River is between the valleys of the Truro River and the Fal; the Tresillian River flows into the Truro River just upstream of where the latter joins the Fal. Early records give the Tresillian River the name &quot;Seugar&quot; (1297) or &quot;Sowgar&quot; (1530); the meaning of this name is unknown.

The river is mentioned in the medieval Cornish language play Bewnans Ke (c. 1550), as the place from which the eponymous Saint Kea embarks for Rosené. It uses the river&#x27;s Cornish name &quot;Hildrech&quot;, which in modern spelling is &quot;Hyldreth&quot;.

==Malpas Estuary==
The river from the city to the village of Malpas, including Lambe Creek and Calenick Creek, form Malpas Estuary SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). It is an important habitat of tidal mudflats, which are feeding grounds for wildfowl and wading birds as well as fish species including European seabass, thicklip grey mullet, European flounder and European eel. There is also a small run of migratory brown trout (Sea Trout, known in Cornwall as Peel) into the River Allen. The banks of the estuary are also noted for their flora.

<text>Francis Sylvester Monnett (March 19, 1857 – April 21, 1953) was Ohio Attorney General from 1896–1900 as a member of the Republican Party. Under the administration of Monnette, the Ohio Attorney General&#x27;s office pursued and won the first major victories that finally led to the permanent break-up of Standard Oil Trust established by John D. Rockefeller.

While previous courts had ordered the Trust to divide its interests, the company failed to do so until it was sued in the Ohio courts. While Monnett&#x27;s term ended before the matter could be settled, the work done during his administration set the course for the final resolution. Rockefeller funds were lavishly donated to Monnette&#x27;s opponents, which led to his loss in the November 1900 election.

Monnett also worked with Ohio Senator H. E. Valentine in the investigation of trust problems undertaken by a committee of the Ohio state senate in 1898. As a result of this probe, Ohio enacted the Valentine Act. Under the terms of the Valentine Act, legal trust practices were defined and illegal practices were outlawed. The act also specified criminal penalties for violations of the law.

He died in 1953 in Columbus, Ohio.

<text>Avrom Isaacs, D.F.A. (March 19, 1926 – January 15, 2016) was a Canadian art dealer.

==Career==
Avrom Isaacovitch, known as Av Isaacs, was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and moved to Toronto with his family in 1941. Isaacs graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Political Science and Economics from the University of Toronto in 1950.

He began his career in the arts in 1950 when he opened the Greenwich Art Shop, a small framing store on Hayter Street in Toronto. In 1955, when he shared a room with artist Graham Coughtry, Coughtry, along with Michael Snow, persuaded him to open the Greenwich Gallery. The inaugural show, understandably, had paintings by Coughtry and Snow. The gallery was renamed the Isaacs Gallery in 1959 and moved to a new location at 832 Yonge Street in 1961. In it he represented numerous Canadian artists, including Coughtry, Snow, William Kurelek, Gordon Rayner, Jack Chambers, Joyce Wieland, Mark Prent, Richard Gorman, John Meredith, Dennis Burton, Robert Markle, Gathie Falk and Christiane Pflug, many of whom stayed with the gallery for all or most of their careers. The Isaacs Gallery was noted for the broad range of work it showed, running from contemporary art to the art of New Guinea and west-coast Indian artists and even to Asian costumes but his efforts went beyond helping his artists and their markets, wrote the Globe and Mail in 2005. Isaacs also was famous for his &quot;young talent&quot; shows. The Art Gallery of Ontario described him in 2016 as both curator and agitator, challenging both his artists and the community to be progressive. He was more than just an art dealer, he was a champion for modern Canadian art and Toronto.

He opened the Innuit Gallery in Toronto in 1970, where he gave solo exhibitions to such distinguished artists as Karoo Ashevak and Jessie Oonark. In August 1991 Isaacs consolidated his two galleries to form the Isaacs/Innuit Gallery. The gallery closed in 2001.

He was awarded an honorary doctorate by York University in 1992, and was made a Member of the Order of Canada. Av Isaacs died on January 15, 2016. He was 89 years old.

==Legacy==
The key role of the Isaacs Gallery and the artists associated with Av Isaacs was revisited in a joint exhibition titled &quot;Isaacs Seen&quot; at the University of Toronto Art Centre, Hart House, the Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO), and the Textile Museum of Canada (2003-2005). In 2016, the AGO did a second show about Isaacs, &quot;Av Isaacs: Shaping the Scene&quot; which exhibited 19 works from the AGO&#x27;s collection, donated by Av Isaacs or acquired from the Isaacs and Innuit Galleries through purchase and from local collectors.

<text>The Encyclical of the Eastern Patriarchs is a letter issued in May 1848 by the four Eastern patriarchs of the Eastern Orthodox Church, who met at Council in Constantinople. It was addressed to all Eastern Orthodox Christians, as a response against Pope Pius IX&#x27;s &quot;Epistle to the Easterners&quot; which had been issued in January (1848). 

The encyclical was solemnly addressed to &quot;All the Bishops Everywhere, Beloved in the Holy Ghost, Our Venerable, Most Dear Brethren; and to their Most Pious Clergy; and to All the Genuine Orthodox Sons of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church&quot;. The encyclical explicitly denounces the &quot;Filioque&quot; clause added by Rome to the Nicene Creed as a heresy, censures the papacy for missionizing among Eastern Orthodox Christians, and repudiates Ultramontanism (papal supremacy). It also describes the Roman Catholic Church as being in apostasy, heresy, and schism.

In the course of all this, it notably makes reference to the Fourth Council of Constantinople (879-880) as being the eighth ecumenical council.

<text>José Rafael Moneo Vallés (born 9 May 1937) is a Spanish architect. He won the Pritzker Prize for architecture in 1996, the RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 2003, and La Biennale&#x27;s Golden Lion in 2021.

==Biography==
Born in Tudela, Spain, Moneo studied at the ETSAM, Technical University of Madrid (UPM) from which he received his architectural degree in 1961. 

Moneo designed the Davis Art Museum at Wellesley College in Massachusetts and the Audrey Jones Beck Building (an expansion of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston). He also designed the Chace Center, a new building for the Rhode Island School of Design. In December 2010, the Northwest Corner Building (formerly the Interdepartmental Science Building) at Columbia University in New York City first opened. 

Moneo&#x27;s most recent work is Peretsman-Scully Hall and the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, which houses the psychology and neuroscience departments at Princeton University and opened in December 2013.

In 2012, Moneo was awarded with the 2012 Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts. According to the jury, Moneo is &quot;a Spanish architect of universal scope whose work enriches urban spaces with an architecture that is serene and meticulous. An acknowledged master in both the academic and professional field, Moneo leaves his own mark on each of his creations by making them a weird modern type of building at the same time as combining aesthetics with functionality, especially in the airy interiors that act as impeccable settings for great works of culture and the spirit.&quot;

Moneo&#x27;s work has been shown in several international exhibitions including &quot;Rafael Moneo. A Theoretical Reflection from the Profession&quot; whose curator was his disciple, Francisco González de Canales.

<text>Sanjay Kak (born 1958) is an Indian author, activist and self-taught film-maker. He is known for his documentaries about environmental activism and resistance politics.

==Background and education==
Kak was born into a family of Kashmiri Pandits, based in New Delhi for several generations.

Kak studied economics and sociology at the University of Delhi. He is a self-taught film-maker who is actively involved in the documentary film movement and in the Campaign against Censorship and the Cinema of Resistance project.

==Career==
Kak makes documentary films. His early work includes &quot;Punjab: Doosra Adhay&quot; (1986) about the Punjab in the days of the Khalistan struggle, and &quot;Pradakshina&quot; (1987), about the river Ganges. He followed this with a 1990 film about Cambodia&#x27;s Angkor Wat temple, &quot;Angkor Remembered&quot;. In 1993 he released films about the Indian diaspora in England (&quot;This Land, My Land, Eng-land&quot;) and South Africa (&quot;A House and a Home&quot;). 1995 saw the release of &quot;Harvest of Rain&quot;.

&quot;One Weapon&quot; (1997) followed, &quot;the documentary that marked Sanjay Kak as an explicitly political filmmaker&quot;, according to &quot;The Caravan&quot; magazine, and &quot;In the Forest Hangs a Bridge&quot; (1999) about the making of a bridge in Northeast India; winner of the Golden Lotus Best Documentary Film, National Film Awards; Asian Gaze Award, Pusan Short Film Festival, Korea.

<doc id="1307944" wikidata="Q448217" url="?curid=1307944" title="Federal Home Loan Banks">
<text>The Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks, or FHLBank System) are 11 U.S. government-sponsored banks that provide liquidity to financial institutions to support housing finance and community investment.

==Overview==
The FHLBank System was chartered by Congress in 1932, during the Great Depression. It has a primary mission of providing member financial institutions with financial products/services which assist and enhance the financing of housing and community lending. FHLBanks operate exclusively in the secondary market providing loans (advances) to financial institutions, not individuals. The 11 FHLBanks are each structured as cooperatives owned and governed by their member financial institutions, which today include savings and loan associations (thrifts), commercial banks, credit unions, and insurance companies. While FHLBanks are private, the FHLBank System is directly regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) and FHLBanks enjoy certain benefits from their government sponsorship, namely an “implied guarantee” from the federal government and “Regulatory and income tax exemptions that reduce their operating costs.” The Congressional Budget Office estimated in the 2024 fiscal year that FHLBanks receive a net government subsidy of $6.9 billion.

==History==
The FHLBanks were established during the Great Depression by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) pursuant to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932. After signing the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, President Herbert Hoover gave a statement describing the purpose of the FHLBank System:The purpose of the system is both to meet the present emergency and to build up homeownership on more favorable terms than exist today. The immediate credit situation has for the time being in many parts of the country restricted the activities of building and loan associations, savings banks, and other institutions making loans for home purposes, in such fashion that they are not only unable to extend credit for the acquirement of new homes, but in thousands of instances they have been unable to renew existing mortgages with resultant foreclosures and great hardships.The FHLBank System was roughly structured as a Federal Reserve system for thrifts. At the time, thrifts could not join the Federal Reserve and access emergency lending through the discount window, explaining why the FHLBanks were initially needed to address emergency needs of the Great Depression. Initially, the FHLBanks made direct loans to homeowners, but the Home Owners’ Loan Act of 1933 transferred this responsibility to the newly established Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation and authorized the FHLBB to charter and regulate federal thrifts. In 1937, the FHLBank System issues its first consolidated obligations.

=== Statutory and regulatory changes ===
The Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970 provided the FHLBank System with $250 million to subsidize interest rates on home construction advances. In 1982, the Garn St. Germain Depository Institutions Act eliminates restrictions on collateral FHLBanks can accept.

In response to the savings and loan crisis of 1986-1995, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) abolished the FHLBB and transferred oversight responsibility of the FHLBanks to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in the Department of the Treasury. FIRREA also made commercial banks and credit unions eligible to be members of FHLBanks if 10% of their assets were in residential mortgages.

As a result of the Great Recession, the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) replaced the FHFB with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The Secretary of the Treasury was authorized to purchase FHLBank debt securities in any amount through December 31, 2009, after which the limit would return to the original $4 billion. HERA also made community development financial institutions (CDFIs) eligible to be FHLBank members.

In 2015, an FHFA final rule authorized non-federally insured credit unions to be FHLBank members.

=== Mergers and splits ===
In 1946, the FHLBank of Los Angeles and FHLBank of Portland are merged to create the FHLBank of San Francisco and was split into the FHLBank of San Francisco and FHLBank of Spokane (later Seattle) in 1963. In 2015, the FHLBank of Seattle and FHLBank of Des Moines voluntarily merged.

==Financial results and condition==
Since August 2006, all 11 banks have been registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and all financial statements and other filings are available to the public at the SEC website (EDGAR).

On August 5, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that the FHLBanks had satisfied their obligation to make payments related to the Resolution Funding Corporation (RefCorp) bonds. The Banks were required to pay 20 percent of their net income (after payments to the Affordable Housing Program) toward the RefCorp bond payments. Each Bank now pays 20% of its net income into its own separate restricted retained earnings account until the account equals one percent of that Bank&#x27;s outstanding consolidated obligations.

==Involvement in 2023 banking crisis==

At times, FHLBanks have been used as a “lender of next-to-last resort” providing emergency liquidity to distressed banks. Such was the case in 2023 when a few member banks with exposure to the cryptocurrency industry (Silvergate Capital Corporation, Signature Bank and Metropolitan Bank Holding Corporation) received FHLB loans in response to a run on deposit withdrawals. The FHLBank of San Francisco also loaned $30 billion to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) prior to SVB’s collapse. According to the FHFA, “During the week beginning March 13, 2023, the FHLBanks funded $675.6 billion in advances, the largest one-week advance volume in FHLBank System history.”

These lending practices have drawn criticism for two reasons: advances to distressed banks are unrelated to the core mission activities of the FHLBank System and can obscure or worsen financial instability. Bloomberg Businessweek quoted Michael Bright, chief executive officer of the trade group Structured Finance Association and a former interim head of the Government National Mortgage Association or Ginnie Mae as saying, &quot;It’s a strange irony. You have a lot of banks that access the FHLBs, but aren’t using advances for mortgage liquidity&quot; Aaron Klein, Kathryn Judge, and Alan Cui from The Brookings Institution argue that “Allowing banks and thrifts to go the FHLBanks instead undermines [mechanisms for ensuring accountability at the Federal Reserve] and can allow problems at banks to fester.” Furthermore, FHLBanks demanding larger haircuts on collateral “tend[s] to exacerbate liquidity strains.”

Mark T. Williams from Boston University, in the Financial Times, point to the important on-demand liquidity and shock absorber role the FHLBanks perform in times of financial crisis. He contends that the March 2023 bank runs would have been more pronounced had such lending not been available.

As part of a comprehensive review of the FHLBank System, the FHFA noted the necessity of distinguishing the role of FHLBanks and The Federal Reserve in emergency lending situations. FHLBanks face &quot;operational and financing limitations&quot; which make them unfit to serve as the lender of last resort. Moreover, while FHLBanks did not incur losses on their advances, the broader financial system bears the cost “highlighting the need for greater focus by the FHLBanks on evaluating member creditworthiness and better coordination with their members’ primary regulators when a member’s financial condition is deteriorating.”

== Reforms to the FHLBank System ==
In November 2023, the FHFA released a comprehensive review titled: FHLBank System at 100: Focusing on the Future. The report articulates a vision for the future of the FHLBank System highlighting reforms to the FHLBank System’s core mission activities and operations. The proposed reforms include:

* Clarifying the FHLBank System’s core mission activities
* Creating a measure to assess FHLBank mission achievement
* Establishing incentive structures for FHLBank members to support the FHLBank System’s mission
* Ensuring FHLBanks are not the lender of last resort by establishing protocols for members to borrow from the Federal Reserve
* Improving FHLBanks’ ability to meet short-term liquidity needs with their deposit accounts
* Strengthening risk and creditworthiness assessment
* Strengthening capital management
* Prioritizing climate resilience and improving climate risk assessment
* Increasing support for housing and community development related programs
* Increasing advances for housing and community development
* Enhancing support for multi-family housing and affordable housing
* Improving the system’s operational efficiency
* Reorganizing the structure and districts of FHLBanks
* Harmonizing eligibility requirements of members
* Changing the size and composition of the Boards of Directors

As one of the first steps to the reform, the FHFA requested comment on the FHLBank System’s core mission activities in 2024, receiving 234 comments.

<text>Michael Shrieve (born July 6, 1949) is an American drummer, percussionist, and composer. He is best known as the drummer of the rock band Santana, playing on the band&#x27;s first seven albums from 1969 to 1974. At age 20, Shrieve was the second youngest musician to perform at Woodstock. His drum solo during &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; in the &quot;Woodstock&quot; film has been described as &quot;electrifying&quot;, although he considers his solo during the same piece in 1970 at Tanglewood the superior performance.

==Biography==

Shrieve was born and grew up in San Francisco. Shrieve&#x27;s first full-time band was called Glass Menagerie, followed by experience in the house band of an R&amp;B club, backing touring musicians including B.B. King and Etta James. At 16, Shrieve played in a jam session at the Fillmore Auditorium, where he attracted the attention of Santana&#x27;s manager, Stan Marcum. When he was 19, Shrieve jammed with Santana at a recording studio and was invited to join that day.

On August 16, 1969, Santana played the Woodstock Festival, shortly after Shrieve&#x27;s twentieth birthday, but before the release of their eponymous first album (1969). He remained with Santana for &quot;Abraxas&quot; (1970), &quot;Santana III&quot; (1971), &quot;Caravanserai&quot; (1972), &quot;Welcome&quot; (1973), &quot;Borboletta&quot; (1974) and the live &quot;Lotus&quot; (1974). He co-wrote four of the tracks on &quot;Caravanserai&quot;, as well as co-produced the album.

Shrieve left the original Santana band to pursue solo projects. He moved to London to record the 1976 album &quot;Automatic Man&quot; with guitarist Pat Thrall, bass guitarist Doni Harvey and keyboardist Todd Cochran (billed as &quot;Bayete&quot;). While in London Shrieve was part of the fusion supergroup Go with Stomu Yamashta, Steve Winwood, Al Di Meola and Klaus Schulze, releasing two studio albums, &quot;Go&quot; (1976) and &quot;Go Too&quot; (1977), and the live album &quot;Go Live from Paris&quot; (1976).

He played in the band Hagar Schon Aaronson Shrieve (with Sammy Hagar, Neal Schon, and Kenny Aaronson). Later, he played drums on (former Supertramp member) Roger Hodgson&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;In the Eye of the Storm&quot;.

From 1979 to 1984, Shrieve collaborated as a percussionist in Richard Wahnfried, a side project of Klaus Schulze (another drummer turned electronic composer) while recording with Schulze his own first &quot;solo&quot; album of electronic music, &quot;Transfer Station Blue&quot;, in 1984.

Shrieve was also credited for playing percussion on the 1980 album &quot;Emotional Rescue&quot; by The Rolling Stones and in 1984, he played on Mick Jagger&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s the Boss&quot; album. When Jagger, Nile Rodgers and Shrieve were mixing the album at The Power Station in New York City, Jaco Pastorius invited Shrieve for a recording session downstairs. This recording remains unreleased.

In 1997, Shrieve joined former Santana musicians Neal Schon, Gregg Rolie, José &quot;Chepito&quot; Areas, Alphonso Johnson, and Michael Carabello to record &quot;Abraxas Pool&quot;.

Shrieve has also collaborated with David Beal, Andy Summers, Steve Roach, Jonas Hellborg, Buckethead, Douglas September, Freddie Hubbard and others. He has served as a session player on albums by Todd Rundgren and Jill Sobule.

In 2004, Shrieve appeared on the track &quot;The Modern Divide&quot; on the Revolution Void album &quot;Increase the Dosage&quot;. The album was released under a Creative Commons license.

, Shrieve lives in Seattle, Washington, where he plays in a fusion jazz group, Spellbinder, with Danny Godinez, Joe Doria, Raymond Larsen, and Farko Dosumov.

Shrieve has composed music for several films, including Paul Mazursky&#x27;s &quot;Tempest&quot; and &quot;Apollo 13&quot;.

Shrieve currently plays a DW Collector&#x27;s Series drum set and recently joined the Istanbul Agop cymbals family. He has played a variety of other drum sets in the past, including sets by Camco, Premier and Ludwig, the latter visible in the Woodstock footage. He also played both Zildjian and later Paiste cymbals in his early days before becoming a longtime Sabian user.

==Honors==
In 1998 Shrieve was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame for his work with Santana.

In March 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine readers picked The Best Drummers of All Time: Shrieve ranked #10.

<text>Audio Alchemy was a high end audio equipment manufacturer based in California, USA. The company was first formed in the late 1980s, producing many lines of relatively affordable audio products, including CD players, transports, digital audio processors, and amplifiers. It went out of business in the late 1990s, was briefly relaunched in the early 2000s as Alchemy2, then was relaunched under the original Audio Alchemy name in early 2015 with a new line of higher-quality, full-featured audio products. 
On October 6, 2016 Audio Alchemy was acquired by Elac.

Audio Alchemy products make innovative use of the I²S audio interface, usually reserved for the internal connection between the CD transport and DAC of a CD player. Audio Alchemy brought the interface out to a DIN connector, allowing a very low jitter connection between the CD transport and external DAC, by transmitting the clock signal and the audio signal in parallel. This offers a superior alternative connectivity method to something like S/PDIF, which sees the clock signal embedded into the audio signal. The process of extracting the clock signal from the data stream is where jitter is introduced. This interface is used in several original Audio Alchemy products and in the relaunched company&#x27;s products. 
Perpetual Technologies and Camelot Technology also produce products that use the I²S interface.

<doc id="1307956" wikidata="Q256037" url="?curid=1307956" title="Stage Beauty">
<text>Stage Beauty is a 2004 romantic period drama directed by Richard Eyre. The screenplay by Jeffrey Hatcher is based on his play &quot;Compleat Female Stage Beauty&quot;, which was inspired by references to 17th-century actor Edward Kynaston made in the detailed private diary kept by Samuel Pepys.

==Plot==
Ned Kynaston is one of the leading actors of his day, particularly famous for his portrayal of female characters, predominantly Desdemona in &quot;Othello&quot;. His dresser, Maria, aspires to perform in the legitimate theatre but is forbidden because of a law, at that time in effect, forbidding theatres to employ actresses. Instead, she appears in productions at a local tavern under the pseudonym Margaret Hughes. Her popularity is aided by the novelty of a woman acting in public, which attracts the attention of Sir Charles Sedley, who offers his patronage. Eventually, she is presented to Charles II.

Nell Gwynn, an aspiring actress and Charles II&#x27;s mistress, comes upon Kynaston ranting about women on stage and seduces Charles II into banning men from playing female roles. Kynaston, having gone through a long and strenuous training to play female roles, finds himself without a guise by which to keep the attention of his lover, George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, as the latter never had intentions to lead a homosexual life and Kynaston has lost the acceptance of London society which had started to circulate rumors about their association. He is reduced to performing bawdy songs in drag in music halls, while Maria&#x27;s career thrives, although her ability to emulate Kynaston falls short because, as she says, Kynaston never fights as a woman would do.

Called upon for a royal performance, Maria panics and her friends implore Kynaston for coaching, during which she coaches him to develop his ability to regain a theatrical career in male roles. He agrees, with the proviso that he replace the company head Thomas Betterton in the role of Othello. Maria becomes a theatrical star.

==Cast==
* Billy Crudup as Ned Kynaston
* Claire Danes as Maria / Margaret Hughes
* Tom Wilkinson as Thomas Betterton
* Rupert Everett as King Charles II
* Zoë Tapper as Nell Gwynn
* Richard Griffiths as Sir Charles Sedley
* Hugh Bonneville as Samuel Pepys
* Ben Chaplin as George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham
* Edward Fox as Sir Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon
* Alice Eve as Miss Frayne
* Stephen Marcus as Thomas Cockerell
* Tom Hollander as Sir Peter Lely

==Production==
While the film is rooted in historical fact – the first English theatre actress, although her name is unknown, is believed to have performed the role of Desdemona – some liberties with the truth were taken. Nell Gwynne is represented as a mistress of the King who subsequently becomes an actress, but in reality she already was a noted theatre personality when Charles II met her. The sequence in which Maria and Kynaston discover naturalistic acting is anachronistic, as naturalism was not developed until the 19th century.

Interiors were filmed at the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich and Shepperton Studios in Surrey. According to commentary by production designer Jim Clay on the DVD release of the film, because so little English Restoration architecture remains in London, and documentation of the period is minimal, he was required to use his imagination in creating buildings and back alleys on sound stages.

In the DVD commentary, several cast members recall the film was shot during the hottest UK summer on record (2003), and the temperature under the lights usually hovered at 46 °C (115 °F), making performing in the heavy, layered costumes a grueling experience.

The Costumes were designed by Tim Hatley. Twelve costume houses were involved in the production, including The Royal Shakespeare Company, The National Theater, and Angels &amp; Bermans, as well as the Italian houses Sartoria Farani, Tirelli, Costumi d&#x27;Arte, E. Rancati, G.P. 11, and Pompei.

The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in May 2004 prior to its general release in the UK. It was shown at the Deauville Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, and the Dinard Festival of British Cinema in France before opening in New York City.

The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Uneven but enjoyable, &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; uses historical events as the springboard for a well-acted romance with a charming Shakespearean spin.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. O. Scott said, &quot;At times, the movie feels like a fancy-dress version of &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; ... Mr. Crudup&#x27;s fine features, which flicker between masculine and feminine as the lighting changes and the mood shifts, are well suited for the role, though his sinewy, birdlike frame suggests Hollywood anorexia more than Restoration curviness  ... &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; is both timorous and ungainly, words that might also describe Ms. Danes&#x27;s performance. Trapped in an English accent and in a character who must appear conniving and warmhearted in turn, she veers from teariness to brisk indignation like an Emma Thompson doll with a jammed switch. The British actors in smaller roles handle the material better ... George Fenton&#x27;s Sunday-brunch score, on the other hand, is an indigestible dose of good taste ladled heavily over even the film&#x27;s witty and delicate moments.&quot;

David Rooney of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;an intelligent and entertaining adaptation ... skillfully acted, handsomely crafted&quot; and added, &quot;Eyre&#x27;s spry direction of the refreshingly literate, witty drama shows a pleasingly light touch and a genuine feel for the bustle, backbiting and rivalry of the theater milieu ... In a delicately measured performance that favors graceful subtlety over campy mannerism, Crudup conveys a nuanced sense of a man struggling to know himself ... Put in the unenviable position of playing second fiddle to her male co-star in terms of feminine allure, Danes is lovely nonetheless ... George Fenton&#x27;s rich orchestral score enlivens the action with an occasional rousing Celtic flavor.&quot;

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers rated the film three out of a possible four stars and called it &quot;bawdy fun ... the gender role-playing puts spine in this period piece that is vital to the here and now.&quot;

Carla Meyer of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;The film rarely matches Crudup&#x27;s performance, appearing confused itself about whether it&#x27;s farce or drama. But its palette of burnished browns and reds pleases the eye, and at its best, &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; captures the tensions and electricity of backstage dramas.&quot;

In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, David Denby observed, &quot;Second-rate bawdiness—that is, bawdiness without the wit of Boccaccio or Shakespeare or even Tom Stoppard—is more infantile than funny, and I&#x27;m not sure that the American playwright Jeffrey Hatcher, who concocted this piece for the stage and then adapted it into a movie, is even second-rate. &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; might be called the spawn of &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, and, unfortunately, this is a &quot;Shakespeare&quot; that lacks the graceful spirit and breathless narrative drive of its progenitor.&quot;

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the film C+ and described it as &quot;an odd amalgam of high spirits, lively ambition, and botched execution.&quot;

==Awards and nominations==
The film won the Cambridge Film Festival Audience Award for Best Film, was cited by the National Board of Review for Excellence in Filmmaking, and was named the Overlooked Film of the Year by the Phoenix Film Critics Society.

<text>A scale test car is a type of railroad car in maintenance of way service. Its purpose is to calibrate the weighing scales used to weigh loaded railroad cars. Scale test cars are of a precisely known weight so that the track scale can be calibrated against them.

==Purposes==
Cars are weighed for various purposes. These include:

===Axle load limits===
Cars are weighed to ensure they are within the axle load limits of the railroad.

===Customer billing===
Cars are weighed to determine (by subtracting the car&#x27;s unloaded, or tare weight from the total weight) the amount of cargo loaded. This is used to bill the railroad&#x27;s customers for the carriage of bulk commodities, so it is essential that the track scales be accurate.

==Construction==
Many scale test cars were small, old railroad cars carrying heavy metal weights as their superstructure. Scale test cars needed special handling so they would not suffer damage, which might alter their weight. They were reweighed periodically on accurate scales at the railroad&#x27;s shops.

<doc id="1307963" wikidata="Q5440250" url="?curid=1307963" title="Federal Home Loan Bank Board">
<text>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) was a U.S. board created by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act in 1932 that governed the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB or FHLBanks), also created by the act; the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC); and nationally-chartered thrifts. It was abolished and superseded by the Federal Housing Finance Board and the Office of Thrift Supervision in 1989 due to the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, as Federal Home Loan Banks gave favorable lending to the thrifts it regulated, leading to regulatory capture.

==Activities==
Looking to create a secondary mortgage market dedicated to buying loans from their constituent thrifts, the FHLBanks and board successfully lobbied for the creation of Freddie Mac, instead of an expanded Fannie Mae (which was limited to FHA insured loans), to be owned and controlled by the FHLBanks and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and which would buy and sell loans from thrifts only.

==Organizational history==
The FHLBB was established as an independent agency by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, July 22, 1932. The Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation was established as an emergency agency under FHLBB supervision by the Home Owners&#x27; Loan Act of 1933, June 13, 1933. FHLBB and its components (Federal Home Loan Bank System, Federal Savings and Loan System, Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, and Home Owners&#x27; Loan Corporation) were made part of newly established Federal Loan Agency by Reorganization Plan No. I of 1939, effective July 1, 1939.

FHLBB was abolished and its functions and components assigned to the Federal Home Loan Bank Administration (FHLBA) in the newly established National Housing Agency, by EO 9070, February 24, 1942. FHLBA was abolished and its functions and components assigned to Home Loan Bank Board (HLBB) in the newly created Housing and Home Finance Agency, by Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1947, effective July 27, 1947. HLBB was made an independent agency and redesignated as the FHLBB by the Housing Amendments of 1955 (), August 11, 1955.

This redesignated FHLBB was abolished effective October 8, 1989, by the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA). The Office of Thrift Supervision would regulate the thrift industry, while the Federal Housing Finance Board would manage the federal home loan banks.

<text>Kailash Mehra Sadhu (born 1950) is a Kashmiri singer.

==Early life==
Kailash Mehra Sadhu, also known as Malika-e-Ghazal, was born in Dogra, Nainital. She earned master&#x27;s degrees from Panjab University, Chandigarh and Prayag Sangeet Samiti, Allahabad (1975), the latter degree focusing on vocal music. She became a music lecturer at the Women&#x27;s College in Anantnag in 1979.

She earned fame singing Kashmiri ghazals and songs, and has recorded in Kashmiri, Urdu, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Punjabi, Hindi, Persian, Bhaderwahi, Pahari and the Kannad languages. Kailash participated in music competitions organised by the state cultural academy. Her stage performances were organised in Patna, Lucknow, Calcutta, Madras, Trivandrum, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Delhi.

Having married in 1980, she took part in the fourth Festival of Music organised by the Kashmiri Overseas Association of Britain in 1985. She also sang for the film Aarnimall.

She was given the title, Malika-e-Ghazal in 1993 by the Jammu Vikas Sanstha. The Sadiq memorial Committee awarded her the Mehboob Awami Funkara in 1981 and she was chosen the best singer by the Sri Bhat Smarak Samiti in 1980.

==Work after Kashmir conflict==
Kailash Mehra Sadhu sang for the album &#x27;Poozai Posh&#x27;. Alongside fellow Kashmiri singer Vijay Malla, and produced by the Kashmir Overseas Association of the United States of America, this album, containing several sacred bhajans and hymns native to Kashmir, and as a movement to preserve Kashmir&#x27;s 5000-year-old culture, history and sanctity, this album became highly popular with the millions of Kashmiris in the diaspora worldwide.

<text>The impossible trinity (also known as the impossible [[trilemma]], the monetary trilemma or the Unholy Trinity) is a concept in international economics and international political economy which states that it is impossible to have all three of the following at the same time:

* a fixed foreign exchange rate
* free capital movement (absence of capital controls)
* an independent monetary policy

It is both a hypothesis based on the uncovered interest rate parity condition, and a finding from empirical studies where governments that have tried to simultaneously pursue all three goals have failed. The concept was developed independently by both John Marcus Fleming in 1962 and Robert Alexander Mundell in different articles between 1960 and 1963.

Historically in advanced economies, the periods pre-1914 were characterized by stable foreign exchange rates and free capital movement, whereas monetary autonomy was limited. The period from 1950–1971 had restrictions on capital movement (e.g. capital controls), but exchange rate stability and monetary autonomy were present. The period since the 1970s has been characterized by floating exchange rates, free capital movement and monetary autonomy. 

==Policy choices==
According to the impossible trinity, a central bank can only pursue two of the above-mentioned three policies simultaneously. To see why, consider this example (which abstracts from risk but this is not essential to the basic point):

Assume that world interest rate is at 5%. If the home central bank tries to set domestic interest rate at a rate lower than 5%, for example at 2%, there will be a depreciation pressure on the home currency, because investors would want to sell their low yielding domestic currency and buy higher yielding foreign currency. If the central bank also wants to have free capital flows, the only way the central bank could prevent depreciation of the home currency is to sell its foreign currency reserves. Since foreign currency reserves of a central bank are limited, once the reserves are depleted, the domestic currency will depreciate.

Hence, all three of the policy objectives mentioned above cannot be pursued simultaneously. A central bank has to forgo one of the three objectives. Therefore, a central bank has three policy combination options.

===Options===
In terms of the diagram above (Oxelheim, 1990), the options are:

* Option (a): A stable exchange rate and free capital flows (but not an independent monetary policy because setting a domestic interest rate that is different from the world interest rate would undermine a stable exchange rate due to appreciation or depreciation pressure on the domestic currency).
* Option (b): An independent monetary policy and free capital flows (but not a stable exchange rate).
* Option (c): A stable exchange rate and independent monetary policy (but no free capital flows, which would require the use of capital controls).

Currently, Eurozone members have chosen the first option (a) after the introduction of the euro. By contrast, Harvard economist Dani Rodrik advocates the use of the third option (c) in his book &quot;The Globalization Paradox&quot;, emphasising that world GDP grew fastest during the Bretton Woods era when capital controls were accepted in mainstream economics. Rodrik also argues that the expansion of financial globalization and the free movement of capital flows are the reason why economic crises have become more frequent in both developing and advanced economies alike. Rodrik has also developed the political trilemma of the world economy where &quot;democracy, national sovereignty and global economic integration are mutually incompatible: we can combine any two of the three, but never have all three simultaneously and in full.&quot;

==Theoretical derivation==
The formal model underlying the hypothesis is the uncovered Interest Rate Parity condition which states that in absence of a risk premium, arbitrage will ensure that the depreciation or appreciation of a country&#x27;s currency vis-à-vis another will be equal to the nominal interest rate differential between them. Since under a peg, i.e. a fixed exchange rate, short of devaluation or abandonment of the fixed rate, the model implies that the two countries&#x27; nominal interest rates will be equalized. An example of which was the consequential devaluation of the peso, that was pegged to the US dollar at 0.08, eventually depreciating by 46%.

This in turn implies that the country implementing the peg has no ability to set its nominal interest rate independently, and hence no independent monetary policy. The only way then that the country could have both a fixed exchange rate and an independent monetary policy is if it can prevent arbitrage in the foreign exchange rate market from taking place – by instituting capital controls on international transactions.

==Trilemma in practice==
The idea of the impossible trinity went from theoretical curiosity to becoming the foundation of open economy macroeconomics in the 1980s, by which time capital controls had broken down in many countries, and conflicts were visible between pegged exchange rates and monetary policy autonomy. While one version of the impossible trinity is focused on the extreme case with a perfectly fixed exchange rate and a perfectly open capital account, a country has absolutely no autonomous monetary policy the real world has thrown up repeated examples where the capital controls are loosened, resulting in greater exchange rate rigidity and less monetary-policy autonomy.

In 1997, Maurice Obstfeld and Alan M. Taylor brought the term &quot;trilemma&quot; into widespread use within economics. In work with Jay Shambaugh, they developed the first methods to empirically validate this central, yet hitherto untested, hypothesis in international macroeconomics.

Economists Michael C. Burda and Charles Wyplosz provide an illustration of what can happen if a nation tries to pursue all three goals at once. To start with they posit a nation with a fixed exchange rate at equilibrium with respect to capital flows as its monetary policy is aligned with the international market. However, the nation then adopts an expansionary monetary policy in order to try to stimulate its domestic economy.

This involves an increase of the monetary supply, and a fall of the domestically available interest rate. Because the internationally available interest rate adjusted for foreign exchange differences has not changed, market participants are able to make a profit by borrowing in the country&#x27;s currency and then lending abroad a form of carry trade.

With no capital control, market players will do this &quot;en masse&quot;. The trade will involve selling the borrowed currency on the foreign exchange market in order to acquire foreign currency to invest abroad and this tends to cause the price of the nation&#x27;s currency to drop due to the sudden extra supply. Because the nation has a fixed exchange rate, it must defend its currency and will sell its reserves in order to buy its currency back. However, unless the monetary policy is changed back, the international markets will invariably continue until the government&#x27;s foreign exchange reserves are exhausted, thereby causing the currency to devalue, thus breaking one of the three goals and also enriching market players at the expense of the government that tried to break the impossible trinity.

A 2022 study of the Classical Gold Standard period found that the behavior of advanced economies to international shocks was consistent with the impossible trilemma.

==Possibility of a dilemma==
In the modern world, given the growth of trade in goods and services and the fast pace of financial innovation, it is possible that capital controls can often be evaded. In addition, capital controls introduce numerous distortions. Hence, there are few important countries with an effective system of capital controls, though by early 2010, there has been a movement among economists, policy makers and the International Monetary Fund back in favour of limited use.
Lacking effective control on the free movement of capital, the impossible trinity asserts that a country has to choose between reducing currency volatility and running a stabilising monetary policy: it cannot do both. As stated by Paul Krugman in 1999:

==Historical events==
The combination of the three policies – fixed exchange rate, free capital flow, and independent monetary policy – is known to cause financial crisis. The Mexican peso crisis (1994–1995), the 1997 Asian financial crisis (1997–1998), and the Argentinean financial collapse (2001–2002) are often cited as examples.

In particular, the East Asian crisis (1997–1998) is widely known as a large-scale financial crisis caused by the combination of the three policies which violate the impossible trinity. The East Asian countries were taking a &quot;de facto&quot; dollar peg (fixed exchange rate), promoting the free movement of capital (free capital flow) and making independent monetary policy at the same time. First, because of the &quot;de facto&quot; dollar peg, foreign investors could invest in Asian countries without the risk of exchange rate fluctuation. Second, the free flow of capital kept foreign investment uninhibited. Third, the short-term interest rates of Asian countries were higher than the short-term interest rate of the United States from 1990 to 1999. For these reasons, many foreign investors invested enormous amounts of money in Asian countries and reaped huge profits. While the Asian countries&#x27; trade balance was favorable, the investment was pro-cyclical for the countries. But when the Asian countries&#x27; trade balance shifted, investors quickly retrieved their money, triggering the Asian crisis. Eventually countries such as Thailand ran out of dollar reserves and were forced to let their currencies float and devalue. Since many short-term debt obligations were denoted in US dollars, debts grew substantially and many businesses had to shut down and declare bankruptcy. The disorderly collapse of fixed exchange rate regimes in Asia was anticipated in Obstfeld and Rogoff, who showed that empirically almost no fixed exchange rate regime had survived five years once the capital account was opened.

<text>Outdoor advertising or out-of-home (OOH) advertising includes public billboards, wallscapes, and posters seen while &quot;on the go&quot;. OOH advertising formats fall into four main categories: billboards, street furniture, transit, and alternative.

Advertisements are commonly placed by large companies like JCDecaux and Clear Channel Outdoor.

== Digital ==
Digital out-of-home (DOOH) refers to dynamic media distributed across place-based networks in venues including.

===Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH) Advertising===
Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH) advertising refers to the use of digital screens to deliver promotional content in public spaces. Unlike traditional OOH formats such as billboards or posters, DOOH utilizes dynamic displays that can showcase interactive, real-time, and customizable campaigns.

Key Features of DOOH:

* Dynamic Content: Advertisers can update campaigns instantly to reflect weather changes, events, or real-time data.
* Audience Targeting: Leveraging data like foot traffic patterns and demographics, campaigns can be more precisely tailored.
* Interactivity: Touch screens, QR codes, or motion sensors create engaging consumer experiences.
* Integration with Online Campaigns: DOOH bridges offline and online strategies, driving traffic to websites or apps.


=== Programmatic ===

Within the DOOH industry, advertisements might be purchased through programmatic platforms. Programmatic platforms ask marketers to specify desired audience characteristics and automatically locate the media vehicles to deliver that audience. These platforms may allow buyers (the demand side) to plan, execute and monitor campaigns across multiple media platforms (the supply side) using a familiar workflow. A major difference between programmatic digital out-of-home (pDOOH) and traditional OOH or DOOH is that programmatic automates the process of buying, selling and delivering inventory across multiple screens with enhanced capabilities. These enhanced capabilities include the creation of measurable, highly targeted campaigns by utilizing geolocation data to activate the best DOOH screens in real-time based on consumer behaviour and audience movement patterns. Additionally, programmatic allows buyers to set specific parameters or conditions (also known as triggers) for a campaign or inventory and unleash the potential to power campaigns with unlimited data sets from a myriad of data sources. Only when the selected conditions are met will an ad or content be served onto the screen.

== Printed ==
Printed out of home refers to static media distributed across physical spaces. Examples include:

* Aerial advertising: Aerial advertising includes towing banners via a fixed-wing aircraft as well as airships like blimps and other airborne inflatables above beaches, events and gridlock traffic.
* Billboard bicycle: is a new type of mobile advertising in which a bike tows a billboard with an advertising message. This method is a cost-efficient, targeted, and environmentally-friendly form of advertising.
* Brochure Distribution: Information displays in public gathering spaces such as transportation centers, lodging facilities, visitor centers, attractions, and retail environments are targeted methods to distribute effective messaging to a targeted audience. This method is slightly different from traditional OOH as the consumer self-selects the messaging material, and can take that message with them.
* Billboards: (or Bulletins) are usually located in highly visible, heavy traffic areas such as expressways, primary arterials, and major intersections. In the US bulletins are usually illuminated. The ad artwork, commonly digitally printed on large vinyl-coated fabric membranes, is often &quot;rotated&quot; by the outdoor plant operator amongst several locations in a metropolitan area to achieve the desired reach of the population as defined in the sales contract. With extended periods of high visibility, billboard advertisements provide advertisers with significant impact on commuters. This is the largest standard out of home advertising format, usually measuring at 14ftx48ft in overall size.
* Bus advertising: Firmly establish brand awareness and generate quick recall with high-profile exposure near point of purchase locations.
* Commuter rail display: Reaches a captive audience of upscale suburban commuters. Additionally, reaches lunch-time patrons, shoppers and business professionals.
* ComPark advertising: ComPark is a device used for car park advertising, which is placed onto the parallel lines of a bay and is able to gain instant exposure from motorists that have parked their vehicle. The ComPark also serves as a guide to assist motorist in adhering to the parking bay size.
* Gas Station Pump Top Advertising: Printed Signage is inserted into sign holder frames above the Pumps. These are called Pump Top advertising and are generally eye-level height. Average dwell time for customers to refuel their vehicle is 3–5 minutes which make this form of advertising very effective to reach automobile drivers.
* Inflatable billboard: similar to regular 2D billboard, but imposed on 3D object.
* Lamppost banner advertising: Lamp columns are sited everywhere, allowing advertisers and events to use banners to target precise geographical locations and create promotional awareness.
* Mobile billboard: Mobile billboards offer a great degree of flexibility to advertisers. These advertisements can target specific routes, venue or events, or can be used to achieve market saturation. A special version is the inflatable billboard which can stand free nearly everywhere. This product can also be used for outdoor movie nights.
* Poster: Target local audiences with these billboards, which are visible to vehicular traffic, and are ideal for the introduction of new products/services. Marketers use posters to achieve advertising objectives and increase brand awareness by placing multiple units in strategic locations while lowering the cost per thousand impressions. This is a standardized poster format, typically measuring 12&#x27;3&quot; x 24&#x27;6&quot;; formally known as a 30-Sheet Poster.
* Premier panel: Premiere panels combine the frequency and reach of a poster campaign with the creative impact of a bulletin.
* Premier square: Bright top and bottom illumination on a premiere panel provide extra impact after dark.
* Street advertising: The use of pavements and street furniture to create media space for brands to get their message onto the street in a cost-effective approach.
* Taxi advertising: Taxi advertising allows advertisers to highlight their products, whether brand awareness, or a targeted message, directly to areas where people work, shop, and play.
* Wallscape: Wallscapes are attached to buildings and are able to accommodate a wide variety of unusual shapes and sizes. These billboard advertisements are visible from a distance and provide impact in major metro areas.
* Aircraft Advertising: Aircraft advertising includes product or service branding inside and outside the aircraft. This includes wrapping the aircraft with printed SAVs, baggage tag branding, boarding pass branding, tray table branding and more.
* Walking Billboards: These billboards are strapped on to the human shoulder and are carried along the targeted geographic area. These billboard advertisements are also visible during night. It helps the local advertisers as it is very cost effective and can be geographically targeted to a particular area.

Other types of non-digital OOH advertising include airport displays, transit and bus-shelter displays, headrest displays, double-sided panels, junior posters and mall displays.

Space advertising, by use of an array of small satellites that reflect sunlight, has been evaluated by researchers at the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology.

== Regulations ==
=== United States ===
* The states of Vermont, Hawaii, Maine, and Alaska prohibit all billboards.
* The other 46 states permit multiple forms of OOH advertising.

* Billboards are regulated by all levels of government. The regulatory framework, created by the federal Highway Beautification Act (HBA), calls for billboards to be located in commercial and industrial areas. Billboard permits are issued by state and local authorities. Under the Highway Beautification Act, states have strong regulatory powers including the authority to ban billboards.
* Most states have taken steps to regulate digital (electronic) billboards, which feature static images that change (typically) every six or eight seconds. In 2007, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued Guidance to the states regarding regulation of digital billboards. Scenic America challenged the federal Guidance in federal court on procedural grounds. On June 20, 2014, US District Court Judge James E. Boasberg dismissed this case, with prejudice.
* Regulations governing digital billboards prohibit animation and scrolling. Digital billboards are equipped with light sensors to adjust billboard lighting to surrounding light conditions to avoid glare, per the industry code.

=== Brazil ===
São Paulo, Brazil, established an almost total outdoor advertising ban in 2006. The ban required that all billboard and banner advertisements be removed and that store signs be greatly reduced in size and prominence.

=== Switzerland ===
The Swiss municipality of Vernier banned outdoor advertising.

=== Finland ===
Outdoor advertising in Finland is subject to license. According to section 52 of the Finnish road law outdoor advertising along roads is forbidden in principle, but a Centre for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment can grant an exceptional permit for advertising, if it does not endanger traffic safety and is not in conflict with the environment. In places subject to zoning the permit is granted by the local municipality.

Outdoor advertising has also been criticised because of landscape protection or because it would cause environmental damage or &quot;visual pollution&quot; in the landscape. Loose advertising billboards placed on sidewalks in front of businesses cause harm and danger to the visually impaired. Many municipalities in Finland require a minimum of 1.5 metres&#x27; width of free passage space and that billboards can only be used while the businesses are open. Municipalities also give guides and grant permits for placing construction signs, signs about events and other advertising devices. In 2002, the predecessor of the Finnish Transport Infrastructure Agency published a guide for advertising along roads together with the Ministry of Environment and the Finnish Municipal Association.

The difference between outdoor advertising and display window advertising was discussed because of a series of 16 illuminated advertising displays placed inside a series of windows on the corner of the streets Runeberginkatu and Mannerheimintie in Helsinki showing animated advertising for several years. This advertising display had been criticised because of dazzling and light pollution. According to the advertising company, the display was a case of common display window advertising. In May 2024, the Supreme Administrative Court of Finland confirmed the decision given by administrative court in January 2023 about evicting the display but specified that advertising displays can only be removed by officials, not by the housing cooperative.

One form of criticism towards outdoor advertising is about which images are considered appropriate for outdoor advertising because of sexual equality or in the interest of child protection. In 2003 the ethical council for advertising received a complaint about a Christmas advertising campaign for Hennes &amp; Mauritz underwear showing Naomi Campbell and other famous international models in 1930s-style glamour images. The council ruled the campaign as a whole did not go against the international rules for advertising or the council&#x27;s own equality principles. In contrast, in 2008 the council gave the same advertiser (H&amp;M) a warning about &quot;sexualising the public space&quot;. According to the council, the six-story high underwear advertisement on the corner of the Forum shopping centre in central Helsinki featured the 24-year-old model Isabeli Fontana in &quot;unnatural positions&quot; and thus was a &quot;passive object&quot; of the advertisement.

<doc id="1307996" wikidata="Q539711" url="?curid=1307996" title="Shobha Gurtu">
<text>Shobha Gurtu (1925–2004) was an Indian singer in the light Hindustani classical style. Though she had equal command over pure classical style, it was with light classical music that she received her fame, and in time came to be known as the &quot;Thumri Queen&quot;, and for the &#x27;Abhinaya&#x27; sung in her full-throated voice. She was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2002.

==Background and personal life==
Bhanumati Shirodkar was born in Belgaum, (present Karnataka) in 1925. Her mother, Menekabai Shirodkar, was a professional dancer. Menakabai was a &#x27;gayaki&#x27; disciple of Ustad Alladiya Khan of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana. It was from her that Shobha received her training in music from a very young age.

Shobha married Vishwanath Gurtu, a Kashmiri Brahmin gentleman from a good family, and became known as Shobha Gurtu. Her father-in-law, Pandit Narayan Nath Gurtu, was a highly placed officer in the Police, a scholar and also, as a hobby, he played the sitar. He was posted for several years in Belgaum district, which is how Shobha and Vishwanath became acquainted. The couple had three sons, Ravi, Trilok and Narendra. Their eldest son, Ravi Gurtu, was a rhythm player. Another son, Trilok Gurtu is a famed percussionist.

==Career==

Though Shobha&#x27;s formal music training began with &#x27;Ustad Bhurji Khan&#x27;, the youngest son of Ustad Alladiya Khan, the founder of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana in Kolhapur, from whom her mother was learning at the time, while she was still a younger girl, and seeing her talent, Ustad Bhurji Khan&#x27;s family immediately took a liking of her, and she started spending long hours with them. Her ties with the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana were to strengthen still, when she started learning from, Ustad Alladiya Khan&#x27;s nephew Ustad Natthan Khan; though she really came into her own under the tutelage of Ustad Ghamman Khan, who came to stay with their family in Mumbai, to teach her mother thumri-dadra and other semi-classical forms.

Shobha Gurtu specialised in semi classical forms such as thumri, &quot;dadra&quot;, &quot;Kajri&quot;, Hori etc., effortlessly adding pure classical passages into her singing, thus creating a new form, and reviving the magic of forms like Thumri, of which she became a greatest exponent in time. She was particularly influenced by singer Begum Akhtar and Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan.

She also performed music in Marathi and Hindi cinema. As a playback singer, she first worked in Kamaal Amrohi&#x27;s film, &quot;Pakeezah&quot; (1972), followed by &quot;Phagun&quot; (1973), where she sang, &#x27;Bedardi ban gaye koi jaao manaao more saiyyaan&#x27;. She earned a Filmfare nomination as Best Female Playback Singer for the song &quot;Saiyyan Rooth Gaye&quot; from the hit film &quot;Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki&quot; (1978). In Marathi cinema, she sang for films like &quot;Saamna&quot; and &quot;Lal Mati&quot;. In 1979, The Gramophone Company of India (EMI) released her first album &quot;At Her Best... Shobha Gurtu&quot;, considered a high ranking classic recording displaying her dazzling vocal work in the eastern Uttar Pradesh (Purbi Gayaki) musical tradition rooted in the 19th century.

Over the years, she travelled all over the world for concerts, including one at the Carnegie Hall, New York City, performing alongside musical greats and, Pt. Birju Maharaj. Her album of gazal &quot;Tarz&quot; along with Mehdi Hassan was popular. She often lent her voice to the collaborative jazz albums of her son Trilok Gurtu. In 2000, she featured in the Jana Gana Mana Video, which was released to mark the 50th year of the Indian Republic, where she sang the Indian National Anthem, &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot;, along with other leading classical singers and musicians of India.

In 1987, she received the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, and was later awarded the &quot;Lata Mangeshkar Puraskar&quot;, &quot;Shahu Maharaj Puraskar&quot; and the &quot;Maharashtra Gaurav Puraskar&quot;. In 2002, she was awarded the Padma Bhushan.

After reigning over Hindustani classical music genre, for five decades, as the Queen of Thumri, Shobha Gurtu died on 27 September 2004, and was survived by her two sons.

<text>Ace is a fictional character played by Sophie Aldred in the long-running British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. A 20th-century Earth teenager from the London suburb of Perivale, she is a companion of the Seventh Doctor and was a regular in the series from 1987 to 1989 and returned in 2022. She is considered one of the Doctor&#x27;s most popular companions.

Ace appeared in ten stories (32 episodes), and was the final companion in the original run of the classic series.

&quot;Doctor Who&quot; script editor Andrew Cartmel said that the character was written to be a &quot;fighter and not a screamer&quot;. In the television series Ace reveals that her real given name is Dorothy. Her family name is never explicitly stated in the series but spin-off media refer to her as both Dorothy Gale and Dorothy McShane.

==Character history==
Ace is a 16-year-old human who first appears in the 1987 serial &quot;Dragonfire&quot;, where she is working as a waitress in the frozen food retail complex of Iceworld on the planet Svartos. She had been a troubled teen on Earth, having been expelled from school for blowing up the art room as a &quot;creative statement&quot;. Gifted in chemistry (despite failing the subject at O-level), she was in her room experimenting with the extraction of nitroglycerin from gelignite when an explosion (later revealed to be a time-storm created by Fenric) swept her up and transported her to Iceworld, many years in the future. There, she meets the Doctor and his companion Mel. When Mel leaves the Doctor at the conclusion of the serial, he offers to take Ace with him in the TARDIS, and she happily accepts.

Ace suffered traumatic events in her childhood, including a bad relationship with her mother Audrey (the daughter of merchant seaman Frank William Dudman and his wife Kathleen, who served in the Women&#x27;s Royal Naval Service during World War II) and the racially motivated Molotov cocktail firebombing of her friend Manisha&#x27;s flat when she was 13. Following the latter event, needing to lash out, she burned down a local abandoned Victorian house named Gabriel Chase after sensing the presence of the villain Light there and was put on probation. Consequently, Ace covered up her own fears and insecurities with a streetwise, tough exterior. Her weapons of choice included a baseball bat and a powerful explosive, disapproved of by the Doctor (who nonetheless found it useful on occasion), she called &quot;Nitro-9&quot;, which she invented and mixed up in canisters she carried in her backpack.

Affectionately giving the Doctor the nickname of &quot;Professor&quot;, Ace is convinced that he needs her to watch his back, and protects him with a fierce loyalty. In turn, the Doctor seems to take a special interest in Ace&#x27;s education, taking her across the universe and often prompting her to figure out explanations for herself rather than giving her all the answers. However, the Seventh Doctor&#x27;s increasing tendency to manipulate events and people (including her), even with what appears to be the best of intentions, results in several difficult moments in their relationship.

Under the Doctor&#x27;s tutelage, Ace fights the Daleks in &quot;Remembrance of the Daleks&quot;, the Cybermen in &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot;, encounters the all-powerful Gods of Ragnarok in &quot;The Greatest Show in the Galaxy&quot;, the sadistic torturer Kandy Man in &quot;The Happiness Patrol&quot;, and many other dangers. She also faces the ghosts of her own past in &quot;Ghost Light&quot; and &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot;, coming to terms with them and, ironically, creating them in the latter case thanks to the paradoxes of time travel. Over time, she starts to mature into a confident young woman, and her brash exterior ceases to be a front.

What the Doctor is aware of, but Ace is not, is that her arrival on Iceworld was no accident but part of a larger scheme stretching across the centuries and conceived by Fenric, an evil that had existed since the beginning of the universe. Ace is a &quot;Wolf of Fenric&quot;, one of many descendants of a Norseman tainted with Fenric&#x27;s genetic instructions to help free it from its ancient prison so it can evolve humans into the Vampiric Haemovores, and a pawn in the complex game between it and the Doctor. After Fenric is defeated in 1943, Ace continues to journey with the Doctor.

The circumstances of Ace&#x27;s parting of ways with the Doctor are not known, as the series went on hiatus in 1989 with the end of the very next serial, &quot;Survival&quot;, in which Ace is returned by the Doctor to Perivale but ultimately chooses to leave again with him. A painting seen in the extended version of &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot; suggests that at some point in her personal future Ace will end up in 18th or 19th century France. This idea is further explored in the novelisation of &quot;The Curse of Fenric&quot; and the Virgin New Adventures. The novelisation contains an epilogue not included in the televised serial, in which the Doctor visits an older Ace in 1887 Paris.

If the series had continued, the production team&#x27;s intent was to have Ace eventually enter the Prydonian Academy on the Doctor&#x27;s home planet of Gallifrey and train to be a Time Lord. The story &quot;Ice Time&quot; by Marc Platt, in which this would happen, was never made. When the Seventh Doctor is next seen in the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie, he is travelling alone, with no reference made as to what had happened to Ace. In &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; (2022), it is said that Ace and the Doctor had some sort of &quot;fallout&quot; which led to her leaving, although what exactly happened is never clarified.

However, in &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; story &quot;Death of the Doctor&quot;, Sarah Jane reveals that she has done research on some of the Doctor&#x27;s companions, and found that &quot;Dorothy&quot; runs a charity called &quot;A Charitable Earth&quot;. A promotional video made to advertise the Blu-ray release of &quot;Doctor Who&#x27;s&quot; twenty-sixth season shows Ace as the head of A Charitable Earth.

She appeared in &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; celebrating the BBC Centenary, alongside the returning former companion Tegan Jovanka, the two of them now having been hired by Kate Stewart to work as UNIT freelancers. Ace is reunited with the Doctor - now in their thirteenth incarnation - and helps to defeat the Master, the Cybermen and the Daleks, briefly working alongside the Thirteenth Doctor&#x27;s former companion Graham O&#x27;Brien to blow up the Daleks&#x27; volcano base. During the adventure, an AI hologram of the Doctor briefly takes on the form of the Seventh Doctor who reconciles with Ace for their falling out. After the adventure, Ace joins Graham&#x27;s companion support group.

In &quot;Tales of the TARDIS&quot;, Ace reunited with an aged Seventh Doctor and discussed their adventures. They also discussed the meeting with Fenric and both apologised to each other for falling out.

==Other appearances==
Ace and the Seventh Doctor appeared twice more on television after &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was cancelled. The first occasion was in 1990, in a special episode of the BBC2 educational programme &quot;Search Out Science&quot;. In this episode, the Doctor acts as a quiz show host, asking questions about astronomy; Ace, K-9 and &quot;Cedric, from the planet Glurk&quot; are the contestants. The last appearance of Ace on British television was in the Dr Who TV special &quot;The Power of the Doctor&quot; (2022) in Jodie Whittaker&#x27;s final appearance as the Doctor.

Ace was also featured in the &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; comic strip sporadically, one of the few television companions to appear in it.

The character is extensively developed in the New Adventures, a BBC-licensed series of novels from Virgin Books continuing on from &quot;Survival&quot;. Ace becomes more and more frustrated with the Doctor&#x27;s manipulations; he forcibly separates her from a potential relationship with Robin Yeadon in &quot;Nightshade&quot; and sacrifices her lover Jan to defeat the alien Hoothi in &quot;Love and War&quot; by Paul Cornell, which proves to be the last straw. She leaves the TARDIS, joins Spacefleet and fights the Daleks for three years, later rejoining the Doctor and his new companion Bernice Summerfield in &quot;Deceit&quot; by Peter Darvill-Evans, older and more hardened. This development in the character was the result of a deliberate decision by Darvill-Evans as the editor of the line at Virgin to change Ace and her role in the ongoing narrative. It is first revealed in &quot;Blood Heat&quot; by Jim Mortimore that Manisha had died in the firebombing of her flat.

Ace&#x27;s relationship with the Doctor remains strained for some time, boiling over in &quot;Blood Heat&quot; when the Doctor destroys an unstable parallel Earth (where Manisha is still alive) and under the influence of an alien creature she stabs him through one of his hearts in &quot;The Left-Handed Hummingbird&quot;. In &quot;No Future&quot; (also by Cornell) the Meddling Monk tries to manipulate her into betraying the Doctor, which she seemingly does, again stabbing him and leaving him alone on an ice planet. In reality she stabbed him with a pantomime knife from the TARDIS wardrobe and she is playing her own game (partly to teach him what it feels like to be manipulated). When the Monk and his chained Chronovore offer her a chance to return Jan to life, she refuses and rejoins the TARDIS crew, her issues with the Doctor resolved. In &quot;Set Piece&quot; by Kate Orman, Ace becomes stranded in Ancient Egypt and comes to realise that she can survive without the Doctor, but that she also increasingly sees the world as he does. At the book&#x27;s end she leaves the Doctor again to become Time&#x27;s Vigilante, using a short-range time hopper mounted on a motorcycle to patrol a particular segment of time; in effect doing what the Doctor does, but on a smaller scale. She appears in later books, notably &quot;Head Games&quot;, &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, and &quot;Lungbarrow&quot;.

Other spin-off media give contradictory versions of Ace&#x27;s eventual fate. The comic strip in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; has Ace killed off just prior to the events of the 1996 television movie (&quot;Ground Zero&quot;, DWM #238-#242). In the webcast audio play &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot;, Ace inherits the mantle of the Time Lords when they become extinct.

Ace&#x27;s first name is Dorothy, and production notes suggested a possible last name of Gale if desired, an allusion to &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. In another contradiction, the novels (and, following their lead, Big Finish audio plays) have given Ace the last name of McShane. A sequence of BBC Books&#x27; Past Doctor Adventures set after &quot;Survival&quot; and written by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry used the &quot;Dorothy Gale&quot; name, as the authors were unaware of the name used in the New Adventures. This was eventually resolved to some extent when the novel &quot;Loving the Alien&quot; by Tucker and Perry saw the original Ace (Dorothy Gale) shot and killed, but replaced by an Ace from another universe whose real name is &quot;Dorothy McShane&quot;. &quot;Loving the Alien&quot; also makes it clear that all the television episodes and Tucker/Perry novels occur &quot;before&quot; the New Adventures, thus reconciling the different ranges.

Sophie Aldred has voiced Ace for several audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions, alongside Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor and, in some stories, Lisa Bowerman as Bernice Summerfield or Philip Olivier as Hex Schofield. In one of these stories, &quot;The Rapture&quot;, Ace discovers that she has a brother named Liam, of whom she had no previous knowledge. As the more experienced traveller, Ace has developed a slightly flirtatious mentor-teacher relationship with Hex. How the audio plays tie in with the other media is not clear, and the continuity of the various lines may not match up with each other.

In 1996, Virgin&#x27;s Doctor Who Books imprint published a hardback by Sophie Aldred and Mike Tucker entitled &quot;Ace!: The Inside Story of the End of an Era&quot; (). This book gives details of each serial featuring the character Ace, complete with many photographs and concept art. It also contains a list of other spin-offs in which the character of Ace appears and some of the conventions which Sophie Aldred attended, along with information about the planned Season 27, including Ace&#x27;s departure. In 1998, BBV produced a number of audio adventures starring McCoy and Aldred as &quot;The Professor&quot; and &quot;Ace&quot;. The plays were not licensed by the BBC, but the duo were clearly intended to be the same characters, to the extent that the BBC intervened, causing BBV to change the character names to &quot;The Dominie&quot; and &quot;Alice&quot;.

The Reeltime Pictures video &quot;Mindgame&quot; features Sophie Aldred as &quot;the Human&quot;, imprisoned with a Sontaran and a Draconian, the implication being that she is playing Ace, though for copyright reasons this could not be made explicit.

In 2018, Ace was confirmed to appear in Big Finish Production&#x27;s audio drama based on Doctor Who spin-off &quot;Class&quot;, with Aldred reprising her role alongside the show&#x27;s main cast. The story released that August.

In 2020, BBC Books published &quot;At Childhood&#x27;s End&quot; (), a novel by Aldred featuring Ace, decades after her travels with the Doctor and now running the &quot;A Charitable Earth&quot; charity. The novel also features the Thirteenth Doctor and her companions. Like the charity, the title of the novel forms the acronym &quot;ACE&quot;.

== Legacy ==
The character of Ace has been cited as the first &quot;modern&quot; companion for the Doctor. One of the reasons is that her character was written to be more realistic, three-dimensional and to grow as a person throughout her run on the show.

<text>Jan Malypetr (21 December 1873 in Klobuky – 27 September 1947 in Slaný) was a Czechoslovak politician. As prime minister during the Great Depression he strong-armed Czechoslovakia into a more rapid economic recovery than elsewhere in Europe.

A member of the Agrarian Party, he was the minister of Interior, and chairman of the Chamber of Deputies from 17 December 1925 to 29 October 1932 and again from 5 November 1935 to 1939.

Malypetr served three terms as prime minister of Czechoslovakia:
* 29 October 1932 – 14 February 1934 
* 14 February 1934 – 4 June 1935 
* 4 June 1935 – 5 November 1935

== Early life ==
Jan Malypetr came from landed gentry in the German speaking part of Bohemia. After attending high school and business school in Kadaň, he worked on his parents&#x27; estate, which was called &quot;u Sakulínů&quot;. He also became the president of the local sugar beet cooperative refinery.

In 1899 Malypetr joined the Agrarian Party and in 1906 became a member of its executive committee. From 1911 to 1914 he was mayor in his home town of Klobuky. From 1914 to 1918 he was mayor in Slaný.

When Czechoslovakia became independent in 1918, Jan Malypetr was appointed to the first so-called Revolutionary National Assembly under the Provisional Constitution. In 1920, in the first parliamentary elections, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the National Assembly.

==Legacy==
Among his grandsons was author Jiří Stránský. Women&#x27;s Chess Grandmaster Jana Bellin is his granddaughter.

<text>Rajanaka Kṣemarāja (क्षेमराज) (late 10th to early 11th century) was a philosopher disciple of Abhinavagupta, who was considered a master of tantra, yoga, poetics, and dramaturgy. Not much is known of Kṣemarāja&#x27;s life or parentage. His chief disciple was a sage known as Yogāraja. 

Kṣemarāja&#x27;s magnum opus was the &quot;Pratyabhijñāhṛdayam&quot; (&#x27;The Heart of Self-Recognition&#x27;). In this text, Kṣemarāja explains the main tenets of the &quot;Pratyabhijñā&quot; philosophy in a succinct set of sutras for students. The work occupies the same place in Kashmir Shaivite or Trika literature as Sadananda&#x27;s &quot;Vedantasara&quot; does in Advaita Vedanta.

* Svacchandodyota

* Stavacintamanitika
* Parapraveshika
* Tattvasandoha.

== Quotes ==
&quot;&quot;Man bound in all the phases of waking, dream and dreamless sleep by the body,&quot; &quot;prana, pleasure, etc. does not recognize his own consciousness which is of the&quot; &quot;nature of the great power and full of perfect bliss.&quot; -- Kṣemarāja&quot;

<text>The BFI IMAX is an IMAX cinema in the South Bank district of London, just north of Waterloo station. It is owned and operated by the British Film Institute. From 2012 until 2022, it was operated by Odeon Cinemas.

The cinema is located in the centre of a roundabout junction with Waterloo Road to the south-east, Stamford Street to the north-east, York Road to the south-west and Waterloo Bridge to the north-west.

==History==

BFI IMAX was designed by Bryan Avery of Avery Associates Architects and completed in May 1999. The screen is the largest in Britain (20m high and 26m wide). It has a seating capacity of 500 and a 14,000 Watt digital surround sound system. Although the site is surrounded by traffic and has an underground line just four metres below, the architects and engineers accounted for this in their design and the entire upper structure sits on anti vibration bearings to prevent noise propagation.

The cinema won several awards at the time of opening, including a Design Council Millennium Product Award in 1999 and a Civic Trust Award in 2000.

In 2012, the screen was replaced and a digital IMAX projector was installed alongside the existing 70mm projector. In July 2012, the BFI announced that Odeon Cinemas had been selected to operate it for the next five years, with the option of termination after three years. Odeon maintained the film programmes, and booking of tickets online and by telephone. This gave customers the opportunity to watch operas on the giant screen. The BFI retained power over the cinema&#x27;s operation however, including parts of the film schedule, the name and the technical operation.

To start this move to mainstream cinema, the BFI London IMAX theatre celebrated by having sold 66,000 pre-booked tickets for &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; in just 5 weeks, giving a total sale in tickets of £1,000,000 even before the premiere of the movie.

In June 2022, the BFI announced that its ten year concessions deal with Odeon would end on 19 July 2022, with the BFI regaining control of operations. The cinema closed on this date, with a planned re-opening on 22 July.

==Other IMAX cinemas in London==

London has another traditional IMAX cinema at the Science Museum in South Kensington and in December 2008 gained IMAX digital cinemas at Odeon cinemas in Greenwich and Wimbledon. In 2011, a digital IMAX screen was also opened at the Odeon in Swiss Cottage.

==Screen size comparative to other London large screens==
The BFI IMAX is the largest cinema screen in the United Kingdom. It measures 25.9m (85 feet) wide by 19.8m (65 feet) high with a total screen size of 512.8m² (289m² for a 2.39:1 film, 363m² for a 1.85:1 film, 469m² for an IMAX 1.43:1 film). Before its October 2022 refurbishment it measured 26.5m wide by 20m high, which meant that if showing a film with an aspect ratio of 2.39:1, only 293m² of the screen will be in use, or 379m² for a 1.85:1 film, or 491m² for an IMAX 1.43:1 film. The auditorium seats 493, including 4 wheelchair spaces.

<doc id="1308057" wikidata="Q487125" url="?curid=1308057" title="Viktor Tsoi">
<text>Viktor Robertovich Tsoi (, ; 21 June 1962 – 15 August 1990) was a Soviet singer-songwriter and actor who co-founded Kino, one of the most popular and musically influential bands in the history of Russian music.

Born and raised in Leningrad (now called Saint Petersburg), Tsoi started writing songs as a teenager. Throughout his career, Tsoi contributed a plethora of musical and artistic works, including ten albums. After Kino appeared and performed in the 1987 Soviet film &quot;Assa&quot;, the band&#x27;s popularity surged, triggering a period referred to as &quot;Kinomania&quot;, and leading to Tsoi&#x27;s leading role in the 1988 Kazakh new wave art film &quot;The Needle&quot;. In 1990, after their high-profile concert at the Luzhniki Stadium, Tsoi briefly relocated to Latvia with bandmate Yuri Kasparyan to work on the band&#x27;s next album. Two months after the concert, Tsoi died in a car collision.

He is regarded as one of the most important pioneers of rock music in Russia and is credited with popularizing the genre throughout the Soviet Union. Becoming popular by combining his music and lyrics with philosophy, he retains a devoted following throughout the former Soviet Union, where he is known as one of the most influential and popular people in the history of Russian music.

==Early life==
Viktor Robertovich Tsoi was born on 21 June 1962, in a maternity hospital on Kuznetsovskaya Street in Leningrad. He was the only child of Valentina Vasilyevna Tsoi (), a Russian schoolteacher, and Robert Maximovich Tsoi, a Soviet Korean engineer from Kyzyl-Orda, Kazakhstan, where his Korean parents had been exiled after Stalin&#x27;s 1937 deportation of Koreans in the Soviet Union. The family&#x27;s Korean ancestry can be traced back to Songjin, Hamgyong, Korea (present-day Kimchaek, North Korea), where Viktor&#x27;s great-grandfather Choi Yong-nam was born in 1893. Tsoi&#x27;s Korean clan was the Wonju Choe clan, sometimes spelled as Choi. Koryo-saram, a term for ethnic Koreans living in the former USSR, preferred the surname Tsoi as a romanization of the cyrillic Цой. Translated from Korean, the surnamed Choi means &quot;height&quot; or &quot;top&quot;.

Tsoi grew up in the vicinity of the Moskovsky Victory Park. The family lived in the notable &quot;general&#x27;s house&quot; at the corner of Moskovsky Avenue and Basseynaya Street. For some time, Tsoi studied at a nearby school on Frunze Street, where his mother worked.

From 1974 until 1977, Tsoi attended a secondary art school, where he was a member of the band Palata No. 6 (, English: &quot;Ward No. 6&quot;). The only surviving recording of the group is an album titled &quot;Slonolunie&quot;. Around the same time, he wrote his first two songs – &quot;Vasya Loves Disco&quot; and &quot;Idiot&quot;, though neither were ever performed. From 1977, he attended the Serov Art School, until he was expelled in 1979 for poor academic performance. Afterwards, he attended SGPTU-61, a secondary city vocational school, where he studied to become a woodcarver. In his youth, he was a fan of Mikhail Boyarsky and Vladimir Vysotsky, and later Bruce Lee, after whom he started modelling his image. He was fond of martial arts and often sparred &quot;in Chinese&quot; with bandmate Yuri Kasparyan.

==Career==
Tsoi began writing songs at the age of 17. In the 1970s and the 1980s, rock music was an underground movement limited mostly to Leningrad; Moscow pop stars, endorsed by the Soviet state, ruled the charts and received the most exposure from the media. However, rock music was not popular with the government, and rock bands received little to no funding and were given little exposure by the media. The Leningrad Rock Club was one of the few public places where rock bands were allowed to perform.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Tsoi was a close friend of Alexei Rybin. Rybin, a member of the hard rock band Piligrimy (), and Tsoi, who played bass guitar in the group Palata # 6 (), met at the house of Andrei &quot;Svin&quot; Panov, in whose apartment people and musicians often gathered, and also where his own punk band Avtomaticheskie udovletvoriteli rehearsed. By this time, Tsoi had begun to perform the songs he wrote at parties.

Tsoi and Rybin, as members of Автоматические удовлетворители (Avtomaticheskie udovletvoriteli), went to Moscow and performed punk-rock metal at Artemy Troitsky&#x27;s underground concerts. During a similar performance in Leningrad on the occasion of Andrei Tropillo&#x27;s anniversary, Tsoi and Rybin first met Boris Grebenshchikov. Later, after a solo concert by Grebenshchikov, they met up and Tsoi played two of his songs to him. Grebenshchikov, who had already been a relatively established musician in the Leningrad underground scene, was very impressed by Tsoi&#x27;s talent and helped him start up his own band.

===Beginnings of Kino===
At the Leningrad Rock Club, Tsoi played as a solo artist supported by members of the band Aquarium. Tsoi&#x27;s lyrics and music impressed the crowd. In the summer of 1981, Tsoi, Rybin, and Oleg Valinsky formed the band Garin i giperboloydy (). The name was a homage to the classic Russian novel &quot;The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin&quot; by Aleksey Tolstoy. In autumn of the same year, the band was admitted to membership of the Leningrad Rock Club. Not long after, Valinsky was conscripted into the army, leaving only Tsoi and Rybin, who renamed the band to Kino. Kino began recording its debut album in the spring of 1982.

===First albums===
Kino began recording its debut album, &quot;45&quot;, in the spring of 1982 at Andrei Tropillo&#x27;s studio. Members of Aquarium also took part in the recording, with Boris Grebenshchikov directing the album. By the summer, the album was completely finished. Its duration was 45 minutes, after which the album was named &quot;45&quot;. The album got some distribution and Kino performed in many apartment concerts in Moscow and Leningrad.

On 19 February 1983, a joint concert with Kino and Aquarium took place. After the concert, Yuri Kasparyan was invited to join the band as a guitarist. In the spring, Rybin left Kino due to disagreements with Tsoi. Tsoi and Kasparyan spent the summer on joint rehearsals. As a result, Kino recorded the album &quot;46&quot;, which was initially thought of as a demo for &quot;Nachalnik Kamchatki&quot; (). &quot;46&quot; was widely distributed and was considered to be a full-fledged album. In the fall of 1983, Tsoi went to a psychiatric hospital in Pryazhka, where he spent a month and a half. As a result, Tsoi was not conscripted into the army. After being discharged from the psychiatric hospital, he wrote the song &quot;Trankvilizator&quot; ().

&quot;&quot;Peremen!/&quot;My zhdyom peremen&quot; (&quot;Changes!&quot;/&quot;We are waiting for changes&quot;)&quot;, first performed by Tsoi in the summer of 1986, quickly became an important political song, an embodiment of the spirit of the Perestroika. It remains a powerful political song, prominently used during 2020–2021 Belarusian protests.

===Rise to fame===
1987 was a breakthrough year for Kino. The release of their 6th album &quot;Gruppa Krovi&quot; () triggered what was then called &quot;Kinomania&quot;. The open political climate under glasnost allowed Tsoi to make &quot;Gruppa Krovi&quot;, his most political album, yet it also allowed him to record a sound of music that no one before him had been able to play. Most of the tracks on the album were directed at the youth of the Soviet Union, telling them to take control and make changes within the nation; some of the songs addressed the social problems crippling the nation. The sound and lyrics of the album made Tsoi a hero among Soviet youth and Kino the most popular rock band ever. In the diverse Soviet republics, fans translated his originally Russian lyrics into their native languages as well.

Over the next few years, Tsoi appeared in several successful movies and also travelled to the United States to promote his films at film festivals. Several more albums were released, their themes were once again mostly political, further fueling the band&#x27;s popularity. Even though Tsoi was a huge star, he still lived a relatively ordinary life. He kept his old job in the boiler room of an apartment building, called Kamchatka, which is currently a museum/club dedicated to the singer. The fact that he worked at a boiler plant surprised many people. Tsoi said that he enjoyed the work and he also needed the money to support the band, as they still received no government support and their albums were copied and passed around the nation via &quot;magnitizdat&quot; free of charge. This made Tsoi even more popular among the people because it showed that he was down to earth and they could relate to him. He also went on tour in 1988–1989 to Italy, France, and Denmark. Kino&#x27;s finest hour came in 1990 with a concert at Moscow&#x27;s Luzhniki Stadium; 62,000 fans filled the stands to celebrate the triumph of the USSR&#x27;s most successful rock group. It also was one of the four times the Luzhniki Olympic Fire was ever lit.

===Film appearances===
In 1987, the band Kino, along with other Russian rock bands, appeared as themselves in &quot;Assa&quot; (), a film by Sergei Solovyov. However, the film as a whole has nothing to do with rock music, and Kino simply appears as a cameo in the end.

In 1988, Viktor Tsoi starred as the protagonist in &quot;The Needle&quot; (), directed by Rashid Nugmanov and written by Aleksandr Baranov and Bakhyt Kilibayev. The plot is centered around the character Moro, who returns to Almaty, Kazakhstan, to collect money owed to him. While waiting out an unexpected delay, he visits his former girlfriend Dina and discovers she has become a morphine addict. He decides to help her quit and fight the local drug mafia responsible for her condition. But Moro finds a deadly opponent in &quot;the doctor,&quot; the mafia kingpin who is exploiting Dina. Tsoi was nominated for an award for his role in the film.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack, including original music by Tsoi&#x27;s band Kino, contributes to the overall feeling of the movie, in addition to the film&#x27;s use of post-modern twists and surreal scenes.

The movie was officially released in February 1989 in the Soviet Union.

==Death==

On 15 August 1990, in Latvia, Tsoi was driving on the Sloka – Talsi highway, near Tukums and Engure. At 12:28 p.m., Tsoi died in a car collision. The investigation concluded that Tsoi had fallen asleep while driving, possibly due to fatigue; he had not consumed alcohol for at least 48 hours before his death. At the time he fell asleep Tsoi was driving at a speed of at least 100 km/h, causing his dark blue Moskvitch-2141 to turn into the oncoming lane and collide with an Ikarus 250 bus, 35 kilometers on the highway from Sloka. Tsoi was pronounced dead at the scene. While neither the driver nor the bus were badly injured or damaged, Tsoi&#x27;s car was completely destroyed to the point that one of its tires was never found.

The death of Viktor Tsoi was a shock to many fans, with some even committing suicide. On 17 August, &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot;, one of the main Soviet newspapers, had the following to say about Tsoi and his meaning to the youth of the nation:

On 19 August, he was buried in a closed casket at the Bogoslovskoe Cemetery in Leningrad. Thousands of people came to the funeral.

Kasparyan left for Leningrad prior to the collision, with a tape containing the only recording of Tsoi&#x27;s vocals for the band&#x27;s next album. The remaining members of Kino finished and released the &quot;Black Album&quot; in December. It later became one of the band&#x27;s most popular albums.

==Personal life==
Viktor lived with his wife, Marianna Tsoi, and his son Alexander (born 1985). Tsoi lived a poor life, with Marianna saying that they could not even afford a proper wedding dress. The apartment building boiler room he worked at was nicknamed &quot;Kamchatka&quot;, and is now the site of a museum and rock club dedicated to Tsoi. He also previously worked in Kiev, Ukrainian SSR, but after the authorities found out he was working illegally, he was sent to Moscow.

During the filming of &quot;Assa&quot;, Tsoi met Natalia Razlogova, the director&#x27;s assistant. Tsoi later fell in love with Razlogova and separated from Marianna. However, they did not divorce, for the sake of their son, Alexander Tsoi.

==Legacy==
Portraits of Viktor Tsoi are displayed today in many places around Russia, from graffiti on the fences of Saint Petersburg to an entire wall dedicated to Viktor Tsoi in a bylane of the famous Arbat Street in Moscow, where fans still gather to remember their hero. Other Tsoi Walls can also be found in Minsk, Belarus and in some regions of Kazakhstan. In 2000 some of the nation&#x27;s top rock bands came together and released their interpretations of Kino&#x27;s best songs as a tribute to Viktor Tsoi on what would have been his 38th birthday.

In 2012, on what would have been Tsoi&#x27;s 50th birthday, the remaining members of Kino gathered to record the song &quot;Ataman&quot; (), with his vocals that were recovered from his car crash but never used because of its poor quality. The drummer Georgiy Guryanov died shortly after, making &quot;Ataman&quot; the last song recorded by Kino and its members.

On 15 August 2020, the 30th anniversary of Tsoi&#x27;s death was marked. In memory of Tsoi, the Palace Bridge in St. Petersburg was lifted to his songs. Fans across the country commemorated his death, especially in his home city of St. Petersburg where a number of events and concerts were organised, as well as at the Tsoi Wall in Moscow. The day before, a 4-meter-tall monument dedicated to Tsoi was erected in St. Petersburg in his memory.

The South Korean rock band YB covered the song &quot;Gruppa krovi&quot; (; ) on their 1999 album &quot;Korean Rock Remade&quot; ().

Viktor An, a South Korean-born Russian short track speed skater, chose his Russian name &quot;Viktor&quot; in honour of Tsoi.

<doc id="1308058" wikidata="Q7285431" url="?curid=1308058" title="Diwan Dina Nath">
<text>Diwan Dina Nath (1795—1857) was an official of the durbar of the Sikh Empire who served as the privy seal and finance minister in the court of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. He was conferred the title of Raja in 1847, eight years after the death of Ranjit Singh. Following the British victory in the First Sikh War, Dina Nath was made a member of the Council of Regency under the authority of the Governor-General of the East India Company. The British conferred the title of &#x27;Raja&#x27; on him, hoping to make him an ally. He was one of six signatories to the 1849 Treaty of Lahore, which agreed to the surrender of &quot;The Gem called the Koh-i-noor&quot; by the Maharaja of Lahore, the ten-year-old Dalip Singh, to the Queen of England. The signatories, on behalf of the minor Dalip Singh, endorsed the treaty in return for being permitted to retain their jagirs.

==Early life==
Dina Nath was the son of Kashmiri Brahmin family, who were a governing Aristocracy of Kashmir, who migrated to Delhi in 1815, during the oppressive rule of the Afghan governors of the valley and later were instrumental in acquisition (along with Dewan Mokham Chand) of Kashmir to the Lahore Darbar.

==Career==

He served as civil and military administrator and counsellor of considerable influence at the Punjab court for well over three decades, 
He was also closely related to Diwan Ganga Ram, head of the military accounts and keeper of the privy seal at Lahore.

In 1815, at the instance of Diwan Ganga Ram, Maharaja Ranjit Singh invited Dina Nath to Lahore and offered him the post of mutsaddi, or writer, in the department of military accounts.

In 1826, when Diwan Ganga Ram died, Dina Nath succeeded him as the head of military finance, accounts, estates and commander of GhorCharas (Lancers cavalary). 
He headed the Military department (Asla baarood-Ordinance) and keeper of the privy seal (Orders for military action). In 1834, when Diwan Bhawani Das died, the Maharaja made him the head of the civil and military finance office and conferred upon him, in 1838, the title of Raja Diwan.

==Influence==
By his ability and political &amp; military acumen, Dina Nath rose to the highest position of power and influence in the affairs of the State. Lepel Griffin styles him the Talleyrand of the Punjab. After the Maharaja&#x27;s death, Raja Dina Nath&#x27;s influence increased. But Dina Nath knew how to keep his ambition in check and was one man in Lahore who made no enemies at the court. In the turbulent days following Ranjit Singh`s death, he refused to take sides with Rani Chand Kaur or Karivar Sher Singh. Sher Singh upon his succession to the throne, reposed his full trust in him. Dina Nath retained his position at the court &amp; all his estates and military troops during the tumultuous days after demise of Ranjit Singh.

He was one of the signatories to the treaty which was concluded between the Sikhs and the British after the First Sikh War. Later, when a council was constituted in December 1846 for the governance of the Punjab, Raja Dina Nath was made its President, with the active support of the British. He was the greatest man alive and most faithful to Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

Yet under the British rule he actively financed the independence efforts in secrecy. The family of Raja Dina Nath came originally from Kashmir aristocrats, where in the reign of the Mughal King Shah Jahan, some members of it held offices relating to Military positions and 2500 mansabdari.

Dina Nath, whose father had a Civil &amp; Military appointment at Delhi, came to the Panjab in 1815 and obtained a vassal estate at Lahore as a military officer. He first attracted Ranjit Singh&#x27;s notice in 1818 by the great rapidity and clearness with which he did some important missions entrusted to him.

Among the men who rose to power during the later days of the Maharaja&#x27;s life, no one was more remarkable than Raja Dina Nath. He was well and happily styled Talleyrand of the Panjab and his life and character bore a strong resemblance to those of the European statesmen.

Revolutions in which his friends and patrons perished passed him by: in the midst of bloodshed and assassination his life was never endangered. While confiscation and judicial robbery were the rule of the State, his wealth and power and military stature continually increased.
His sagacity and far-sightedness were such that when to other eyes the political sky was clear, he could perceive the signs of coming storm.

Honest men do not survive many revolutions, and the Raja&#x27;s intelligence, sagacity &amp; courage were the means to his success. He was patriotic, but his love of country was subordinate to self. He hated the English bitterly, for they were stronger than he or his country, but his interest compelled him to serve, like Samson, the Philistines he hated.

He was not without his notions of fidelity, and would stand by a friend, ally or a benefactor. Even when he was personally threatened, he acted out of absolute clarity, his actions were dictated by a sense of chivalry, truth and nobility it was more from these thoughts than from personal fear, for, Raja Dina Nath was not only physically imposing, brave and fearless, he also possessed moral courage to an eminent degree, leading him to do right regardless of consequences. He possessed immense local knowledge, tactical skills, handled large formations of unwieldy troops and vast capacity for work and hardship.

He was an accomplished man of the world, courteous and considerate; well educated, a scholar, warrior; and in conversation with Europeans he would express himself with a boldness and apparent candour that were as pleasant, as they are unusual in Asiatics.
It was only in 1834 that Raja Dina Nath was made Raja &amp; Diwan for which his qualifications were exceedingly high, but Maharaja (Ranjit Singh) had for many years reposed confidence in him, and he was on all occasions of importance, one of his most talented civil &amp; military adviser, commander and a vassal.

After the death of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, he retained great influence with the chiefs and the army, and on British occupation of Lahore was appointed to the Council of Regency, of which he was the most able and useful member.
Although his position gave him many opportunities of enriching himself at the public expense, he still worked more disinterestedly in wealth &amp; position than many others of much lower rank &amp; estate, and was of great service to the Resident of Lahore.
In November 1847, the title of the Raja of Kalanaur, with a jagir worth 220,000 rupees annually, was conferred upon him. With his clear head and business-like habits, it would have been almost impossible to disentangle the Darbar Accountancy, and after the annexation of the Panjab, Dina Nath&#x27;s aid in Revenue and Jagir matters was almost as valuable as before.

At the time of revolt of Sikh army in 1848, it was asserted by some that Raja Dina Nath was a traitor at heart, that he himself had Encouraged the rising, and that had he not been a wealthy man with houses and gardens and many lakhs of rupees in Lahore, convenient for confiscation, he would have joined the rebels without hesitation, but these stories were perhaps invented by his enemies. After the annexation of the Panjab, Raja Dina Nath was confirmed in all of his jagirs, worth Rs. 246,460, which he held till his death in 1857.

==Death==
He died near Kot Khawaja Saeed, at Lahore, Pakistan. There he had developed a beautiful garden and it is still called as &#x27;Rajay Wala Bagh&#x27;. The spot is a few meters away towards West from Samadh Maharajah Sher Singh at Kot Khawaja Saeed, Lahore.

==Descendants==
His descendants are:

1. Raja Amar Nath Madan

2. Raja Man Nath Madan

3. Raja Gyan Nath Madan

4. Kanwar Bharam Nath Madan

5. Raja Ravindera Nath Madan

6. Raja Rajeev Madan

7. Kanwar Ramchandra Madan

Raja Gyan Nath Madan was the Prime Minister of Jaipur. He was a CIE, a ‘Companion of the British Empire’, an honorary title bestowed upon him by the British, in recognition of his numerous services to the Empire. Raja Gyan Nath Madan was also conferred the hereditary title of ‘Raja’ by the British, which could be passed onto and used by the eldest son( Tikka Raja) of each successive generation.

He purchased Khud Cottage in 1939, several years prior to Partition, when his family settled in Shimla. His son, Kanwar Bharamnath Madan, was the first Deputy Commissioner of Shimla.

Successively, the title of ‘Raja’ has been passed on to Raja Gyan Nath Madan’s eldest grandson, Ravindera Nath Madan and currently his great grandson, Rajeev Madan, who still owns Khud Cottage.

==Water well==
Dina Nath commissioned the Well of Dina Nath in Lahore, Pakistan which, according to legend, has always been dry.

<text>The Mack is a 1973 American blaxploitation crime drama film directed by California native Michael Campus and starring Max Julien and Richard Pryor. The film also stars Oscar-nominee Juanita Moore and Tony-nominated actor Dick Anthony Williams. Filmed in Oakland, California, the movie follows the rise and fall of Goldie, who returns from a five-year prison sentence to find that his brother is involved in Black nationalism. Goldie decides to take an alternative path, striving to become the city&#x27;s biggest pimp.

Although reviews were less than favorable when initially released, &quot;The Mack&quot; is considered by many critics to be the best entry in its genre. The film is often categorized as blaxploitation, but Michael Campus, Max Julien and others involved in its production have argued that the genre label oversimplifies the film.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack was recorded by Motown artist Willie Hutch.

==Plot==
After returning home from a five-year prison sentence, John &quot;Goldie&quot; Mickens has a plan to achieve money and power in Oakland, California, by becoming a pimp. Goldie&#x27;s criminal ways contrast with his brother Olinga&#x27;s Black Nationalist efforts to save the community from drugs and violence. With Slim as his partner and Lulu as his head prostitute, he organizes a team of women and quickly rises to prominence. His success catches the attention of Fat Man, the heroin kingpin that Goldie worked for before heading to prison, and Hank and Jed, two corrupt and racist white detectives. Goldie refuses to work for Fat Man again, and dismisses the detectives&#x27; requests to stop his brother from ridding the streets of drugs. As a result, his mother is assaulted which eventually leads to her death. Although Olinga is disappointed in Goldie because he &quot;brought death to their house&quot;, he agrees to help him get revenge. They develop a plan with Slim to seek revenge, but their plans fall apart when Hank and Jed kill Slim at their rendezvous point. They reveal that they are responsible for Goldie&#x27;s mother&#x27;s death, causing Goldie and Olinga to kill them both. Realizing that one of his hookers, &quot;Chico&quot;, snitched him out to Hank and Jed, he attempts to shoot her but then holds back and leaves. Oakland is now too dangerous and Goldie hugs his brother goodbye and heads out of town on a charter bus.

==Cast==
==Production==
Production for the film took place from early September to late December 1972. According to director Michael Campus, the original script for the film was written on prison toilet paper by Bobby Poole, an inmate at San Quentin. While staying in Oakland for two months, Campus met Frank Ward, a real pimp and drug dealer from Oakland. Max Julien&#x27;s character of Goldie is based on him. To shoot the movie, Campus needed Ward&#x27;s permission because many scenes were filmed in his territory. In exchange for his guidance and protection, Campus put Ward in the film. All of the homeless people, junkies, pimps and women in the film were supplied by Frank Ward.

Although Campus had Ward&#x27;s protection, the film was also in Black Panther territory. During filming, Black Panther party members would throw bottles and trash cans from rooftops. For filming to run smoothly, an additional deal was made with Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, who were put in charge of providing extras for the film. About halfway through the production of the film, Frank Ward was shot and killed while in his Rolls-Royce. There was speculation that the Black Panthers were responsible for Ward&#x27;s death, and the filmmakers and cast relocated to safer areas for filming. Despite the tension, the film&#x27;s opening was shot in Oakland, with all of the proceeds going to the Black Panthers&#x27; breakfast program.

==Reception==
The film was screened in theaters in approximately 20 mostly Black communities. Distributors avoided theaters in predominantly white neighborhoods due to a belief that the film would do better in Black areas. Despite its low distribution, director Michael Campus noted that the film outgrossed &quot;The Godfather&quot; in the cities in which it played.

==Alternate score==
In its original 1973 release by Cinerama Releasing and its 1978 reissue by AIP, &quot;The Mack&quot; featured a score by Willie Hutch, an artist and producer for Motown Records. In 1983, Producers Distributing Corporation reissued the film to capitalize on the resurgent popularity of Richard Pryor and Roger Mosley, who was co-starring on the hit TV series &quot;Magnum P.I.&quot; PDC commissioned a new score by Alan Silvestri featuring vocals by Gene McDaniels. The reissue poster advertised a soundtrack release on Posh Boy Records, but the album was released on the ALA Enterprises label; it is now out of print and highly collectible. To differentiate it from the original score, fans have referred to it as &quot;The Mack and His Pack,&quot; based on a catch phrase used on the reissue poster. When the film was initially licensed to Embassy Pictures for home video, it included the Silvestri score. The New Line DVD release restored the original Willie Hutch score to the film.

<text>The Boston and Lowell Railroad was a railroad that operated in Massachusetts in the United States. It was one of the first railroads in North America and the first major one in the state. The line later operated as part of the Boston and Maine Railroad&#x27;s Southern Division.

==Formation==

The Boston and Lowell Railroad was preceded by the Middlesex Canal. Converting the canal to a railroad would eliminate the issue of transportation being unavailable during the winter, when the canal froze. Patrick Tracy Jackson led the task of convincing the state legislature to fund the project. This proved difficult, as the investors of the Middlesex Canal were against building a new form of transportation designed to replace their canal.

Because, prior to 1872, there was no provision in Massachusetts state law for chartering railroads, all had to be chartered by special acts of legislature. This made it slow and inefficient to charter a railroad because the politicians had to agree; the issue would become partisan. This also meant that the legislature would not let the investors build the line unless they could show it was completely necessary.

The investors were successful because they convinced the legislature that the canal was inherently incapable of providing what they needed: reliable, year-round freight transport. Investors in the Boston and Lowell Railroad received a charter on June 5, 1830, with no provision for reparations to the Middlesex Canal&#x27;s investors. It was a favorable charter because in addition to the right to build and operate a railroad between Lowell and Boston, it gave a thirty-year monopoly on the right to have a railroad there. The people along the road and in terminal-end cities bought large amounts of stock, financing half the company.

==Construction==

The Board of Directors of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, armed with a charter, now had the task of surveying and building the line. They brought in James Fowle Baldwin, son of Col. Loammi Baldwin, who had engineered the Middlesex Canal, to do the surveying, and charged him with finding a gently sloped path from Lowell to Boston, with few grade crossings and well away from town centers. This latter point ended up being quite inconvenient later on. No one had any idea of the future possibility of railroads acting as public transportation, or if they did they were not paid any attention by the builders or financiers of the road.

The right-of-way that Baldwin surveyed did well in each of these characteristics. The path sloped up at a gentle ten feet per mile at the maximum, and there were only three grade crossings over the entire distance. The path was close to the older Middlesex Canal path, but was straighter - as boats can turn more sharply than trains. To achieve this superior linearity, it needed small amounts of grade elevation in places. The route ignored Medford center entirely, going through West Medford instead, and totally bypassed Woburn and Billerica. This would have to be corrected later with various spurs (the one to Medford being built off the Boston and Maine Railroad), but were always sources of annoyance to both riders and operators.

The proposed route was accepted by the Board of Directors of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, and work began on the building phase. The road was begun from both ends at once, and some sources say that they both started on the right hand side of the right-of-way, missing in the middle and having to put in an embarrassing reverse curve to tide them over until they built the other side. Yankee and Irish laborers were hired to construct the railroad, which was made especially difficult and because the Directors wanted to make the road using the best techniques then known. This, for them, meant laying imported British iron rails with a wall of granite under each rail. They did this because it was commonly believed that the train would sink into the ground if the rails did not have strong support.

The first track was completed in 1835, and freight service began immediately. On May 27, 1835, it made its maiden trip to Boston, with Patrick Tracy Jackson, George Washington Whistler, and James Baldwin aboard. The solid granite roadbed proved to be much too rigid, jolting the engine and cars nearly to pieces. Repairs on the locomotives (there were two at the time) would sometimes take most of the night, trying to get them ready for the next day&#x27;s service. The much poorer Boston and Worcester Railroad could not afford a granite bed and so was built with modern wooden ties. This turned out to be far superior, so the owners of the Boston and Lowell decided they would upgrade their entire roadbed to wood when they added a second track.

The original Boston terminal was at the north corner of Causeway Street and Andover Street (halfway between Portland and Friend streets), at the westernmost edge of the current North Station. The bridge over the Charles River to access it was the first movable railroad bridge in the United States. The original Lowell terminal was at the south corner of Merrimack Street and Dutton Street.

==Early operation==
The quantity of freight traffic on the Boston and Lowell Railroad was large from the start (as was expected) with Lowell&#x27;s textile companies bringing in raw materials and sending out finished goods. The high level of passenger traffic, however, was not anticipated. Trains traveled on unwelded rails which were laid on a granite roadbed, which made for an extremely bumpy ride. The railroad switched to wooden ties.

The Boston and Lowell was faced with a new problem; it had a reputation for speed which made it very popular and highly competitive with stagecoaches. Many people wanted to go not only from Lowell to Boston but to places in between. The Boston and Lowell ordered another locomotive and cars for local passenger rail in 1842, and had them make six stops along the route. Passenger rail proved to be almost as profitable as freight.

== Locomotives ==
The first locomotives on the B&amp;L were copies of the successful Planet class built locally in Lowell.

==The Boston and Maine Railroad==
Another railroad was chartered in the early 1840s whose fortunes would be closely tied to those of the Boston and Lowell. This was the Boston and Maine Railroad. This railroad ran down from Portland, Maine, through a bit of southern New Hampshire, to Haverhill in northeastern Massachusetts, connected to the Boston and Lowell in Wilmington, and then used Boston and Lowell track to Boston. This route was conceptualized in 1834, but took a long time to be built, mostly because, unlike the Boston and Lowell, it did not have a secure base of funding like the Lowell textile companies. It took two years to get to Andover, another year to get to Haverhill, three more to get to Exeter, New Hampshire, and did not get to Portland until 1852.

This extra traffic on the Boston and Lowell Railroad, especially with the line still over granite, provided the extra impetus to double track and upgrade. In 1838, the B&amp;L began two years of extensive track improvements, first laying a second track on wood, and with that one built, going back and re-laying the old track on the more forgiving wood as well. Boston and Lowell traffic continued to increase, and even with double tracks the schedule became tight enough that the Boston and Maine trains, as renters, began to be pushed around to annoying hours, often having to wait over an hour in Wilmington before being allowed to proceed on to Boston.

The B&amp;M soon tired of what they perceived as selfishness and decided to build its own track to Boston from Haverhill so that it would not have to rely on the B&amp;L. The B&amp;L tried to fight the B&amp;M in court but failed because the monopoly granted in its charter was only good for traffic between Boston and Lowell. The shortcut, part of today&#x27;s Haverhill/Reading Line, was started in 1844 and was in use by 1848. While the B&amp;M was building it, they were still running their trains to Boston on the B&amp;L. This made for a lot of conflict, with the B&amp;L trying to squeeze every last penny out of the B&amp;M before it lost the opportunity. The B&amp;M tried to deal with this in court, and got the judge to forbid the B&amp;L from raising rates until the case was done, but by the time they were close to an agreement, the bypass was complete.

With B&amp;M business gone, the B&amp;L realized how much they had been relying upon their renters. Additionally, the Lowell mills began to decline somewhat and there was less freight traffic for the line to move. Over the next four decades, the B&amp;L declined until the more successful B&amp;M leased it on April 1, 1887.

==Branches==

The B&amp;L built or leased many branches to serve areas not on its original line. Immediately before its lease by the B&amp;M in 1887, it had five divisions—the Southern Division (including the original line), the Northern Division, the White Mountains Division, the Vermont Division, and the Passumpsic Division. Additionally, it leased the Central Massachusetts Railroad in 1886.

===Southern Division===
The main part of the Southern Division was the mainline between Boston and Lowell.

;Charlestown
The Charlestown Branch Railroad was not itself taken over by the B&amp;L, but as originally built in 1840 it was a short spur from the B&amp;L to wharves in Charlestown. In 1845 the Fitchburg Railroad leased it and incorporated it into their main line.

;Mystic River
The Mystic River Branch served the Mystic River waterfront on the north side of Charlestown.

;Woburn Loop
The Woburn Branch Railroad (aka the Woburn Loop) opened in 1844, connecting Woburn to the main line towards Boston. The Horn Pond Branch Railroad was a short freight-only branch off the Woburn Branch to ice houses on Horn Pond. The northern loop, built in 1885, continued the line back north to the main line at North Woburn Jct. in South Wilmington. The Horn Pond branch line was abandoned in 1911, the northern loop in 1961, and the original line in 1982.

;Stoneham
The Stoneham Branch Railroad was built in 1862 to connect to Stoneham.

;Lowell and Lawrence
The Lowell and Lawrence Railroad was chartered in 1846 to build a line between Lowell and Lawrence, which opened in 1848. In 1858 the B&amp;L leased the line.

;Salem and Lowell
The Salem and Lowell Railroad was chartered in 1848 as a branch from the Lowell and Lawrence at Tewksbury Junction to the Essex Railroad at Peabody, along which it used trackage rights to Salem. The line was opened in 1850 and operated by the Lowell and Lawrence until 1858, when the B&amp;L leased it along with the Lowell and Lawrence.

;Wilmington (Wildcat) Branch
The Wilmington Branch, now known as the Wildcat Branch, was built just west of the original Boston and Maine Railroad alignment to connect the main line at Wilmington to the Salem and Lowell at Wilmington Junction, providing a shorter route between Boston and Lawrence.

;Lexington and Arlington (Middlesex Central Railroad)
The Lexington and West Cambridge Railroad was chartered in 1845 and opened in 1846, connecting the Fitchburg Railroad at West Cambridge to Lexington, although the &quot;West Cambridge&quot; in the name referred to what is now the town of Arlington. It was operated by the Fitchburg from opening, and leased to the Fitchburg from 1847 to 1859. The line was reorganized as the Lexington and Arlington Railroad in 1868, following the renaming of Arlington. The B&amp;L bought the line in 1870 and built a new connection to their main line at Somerville Junction.

The Middlesex Central Railroad was chartered in 1872 and opened in 1873, extending the line from Lexington to Concord. It was leased from completion to the B&amp;L. An extension west to the Nashua, Acton and Boston Railroad at Middlesex Junction was built in 1879.

;Billerica and Bedford
The Billerica and Bedford Railroad was built in 1877 as a narrow gauge line between the Middlesex Central at Bedford and the B&amp;L at North Billerica. It was sold and abandoned in 1878, and the rails were taken to Maine for the Sandy River Railroad. A new standard gauge branch was built by the B&amp;L in 1885, mostly on the same right-of-way.

;Lowell and Nashua
The Lowell and Nashua Railroad was chartered in 1836 as an extension of the B&amp;L from Lowell north to the New Hampshire state line. The Nashua and Lowell Railroad, chartered in 1835, would continue the line in New Hampshire to Nashua. The two companies merged in 1838 to form a new Nashua and Lowell Railroad, and the road opened later that year. In 1857 the B&amp;L and N&amp;L agreed to operate as one company from 1860, and in 1880 the B&amp;L leased the N&amp;L.

;Stony Brook
The Stony Brook Railroad was chartered in 1845 and opened in 1848, connecting the Nashua and Lowell at North Chelmsford with Ayer. The N&amp;L leased the Stony Brook in 1848.

;Nashua to Keene
The Wilton Railroad was chartered in 1844. It opened a line from Nashua west to Danforth&#x27;s Corner in 1848, to Milford in 1850 and to East Wilton in 1851. Since completion it was operated by the N&amp;L.

The Peterborough Railroad was chartered in 1866 to continue the Wilton Railroad northwest to Greenfield, New Hampshire. In 1873 the N&amp;L leased it; the road opened in 1874.

The Manchester and Keene Railroad was chartered in 1864 and opened in 1878, continuing the Peterborough Railroad west from Greenfield to the Connecticut River Railroad in Keene. In 1880 the company went bankrupt, and it was operated by the Connecticut River Railroad until 1882, when it was bought half-and-half by the B&amp;L and the Concord Railroad.

===Other divisions===
;Central Massachusetts Railroad
The Massachusetts Central Railroad was chartered in 1869 to build a line east–west across the middle of the state, between the Boston and Albany Railroad and the Fitchburg Railroad. The first section opened in 1881, splitting from the B&amp;L&#x27;s Lexington and Arlington Branch at North Cambridge Junction, and the company was reorganized as the Central Massachusetts Railroad in 1883. The B&amp;L leased the line in 1886, a year before the B&amp;M leased the B&amp;L.

;Northern Division
The Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad was chartered in 1844, and opened in stages from 1848 to 1853, eventually running from Concord to Woodsville, New Hampshire. That railroad, along with its branches, became part of the B&amp;L Northern Division in 1884, when the B&amp;L leased the BC&amp;M.

The Northern Railroad was also chartered in 1844, opening in 1847 from Concord to Lebanon, New Hampshire, and later extending to White River Junction, Vermont. The B&amp;L leased it in 1884 as another part of its Northern Division.

The only connection between the Southern and Northern divisions was at Hancock Junction, where the Manchester and Keene Railroad (Southern) and Peterborough and Hillsborough Railroad (Northern) met.

In 1889 the BC&amp;M merged with the Concord Railroad to form the Concord and Montreal Railroad, taking it out of B&amp;M control until 1895, when the B&amp;M leased the C&amp;M.

;White Mountains Division
The White Mountains Railroad was chartered in 1848 and opened a line from Woodsville to Littleton, New Hampshire, in 1853. Along with extensions and branches, it was leased to the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad in 1859 and consolidated into it in 1872, becoming its White Mountains Division. In 1884 the B&amp;L leased the BC&amp;M and the old White Mountains Railroad became the B&amp;L&#x27;s White Mountains Division.

The Northern and White Mountains Divisions were connected at Woodsville.

;Vermont Division
The Essex County Railroad (chartered 1864), Montpelier and St. Johnsbury Railroad (chartered 1866) and Lamoille Valley Railroad (chartered 1867) were consolidated into the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad in 1875 as their Vermont Division. The line was finished in 1877, and in 1880 it was reorganized as the St. Johnsbury and Lake Champlain Railroad, which was taken over by the B&amp;L as their Vermont Division. The line did not stay in the B&amp;M system, and the easternmost part was leased to the Maine Central Railroad in 1912.

The White Mountains and Vermont Divisions were connected at Scott&#x27;s Mills, New Hampshire.

;Passumpsic Division
The Connecticut and Passumpsic Rivers Railroad was organized in 1846 and opened a line from White River Junction on the Northern Railroad to the border with Quebec, Canada, in 1867, junctioning the Northern and White Mountains Divisions at Wells River and the Vermont Division at St. Johnsbury. The Massawippi Valley Railway, leased in 1870, continued to Sherbrooke, Quebec, where it junctioned the Grand Trunk Railway among others. The B&amp;L leased the line on January 1, 1887, three months before the B&amp;M acquired the B&amp;L.

==Life as a B&amp;M line==

Over the next 70 years or so, things were reasonably stable and constant for the Lowell Line as a part of the B&amp;M&#x27;s Southern Division. Passenger train round trips per day hovered in the low 20s, and while freight from Lowell itself did not last too long, the Lowell line got some traffic from railroads that connected from the west.

==Modern times==
In the early 20th century, the economics of railroading began to change. With the advent of the internal combustion engine, trains slowly began to lose their advantage as a transportation option. Automobiles and trucks began to increase in popularity as highways improved, siphoning ridership and freight traffic off railroads. The advent of the Interstate Highway System tipped the economic balance by increasing mobility as factories and offices were now able to be located further away from the fixed routes of the railroads. The decline in both passenger and freight traffic occurred at a point when the B&amp;M, like most other railroads, had just switched over to diesel locomotives, meaning that they had large debts. The pressure from the debts and the large infrastructure costs associated with operating a disparate passenger and freight network amongst declining traffic forced the B&amp;M to cut costs. The most noticeable effect to the general public was the reductions in passenger operation. In the late 1950s, the B&amp;M began to eliminate routes and substituted Multi-Unit diesel-powered passenger cars on many of its routes. The effort did not succeed, as the B&amp;M was bankrupt by 1976.

As its fortunes declined, the B&amp;M shed its passenger operation in 1973 by selling the assets to the MBTA. The new state agency bought the Lowell line, along with the Haverhill and all other commuter operations in the Greater Boston area. Along with the sale, the B&amp;M contracted to run the passenger service on the Lowell line for the MBTA. After bankruptcy, the B&amp;M continued to run and fulfill its commuter rail contract under the protection of the Federal Bankruptcy Court, in the hopes that a reorganization could make it profitable again. It emerged from the court&#x27;s protection when newly formed Guilford Transportation Industries (GTI) bought it in 1983.

When GTI bought the B&amp;M, commuter rail service was in jeopardy. The MBTA had owned the trains and the tracks since 1973, but it had outsourced the operation to the B&amp;M. When GTI bought the B&amp;M in 1983, it had to honor the B&amp;M contract, but GTI management was very much against passenger rail, and, in 1986, as soon as the contract expired, they let the job go to Amtrak.

From 1986 until 2003, Amtrak managed the entirety of Boston&#x27;s commuter rail. It did decently, though at times had strained relations with the MBTA. Quibbles centered on equipment failures, numbers of conductors per train, and who took responsibility when trains are late. Because of these bad relations and Amtrak&#x27;s repeated announcements that the contract was unreasonable, few people were surprised at Amtrak&#x27;s decision not to bid again for the commuter rail contract when it came up for renewal in 2003.

When the MBTA asked for new bids on the commuter rail operation contract, Amtrak did not bid, but Guilford and the Massachusetts Bay Commuter Railroad Company did. The MBCR ended up getting the contract and began operating the commuter rail in July 2004.

Guilford&#x27;s main line between Mattawamkeag, Maine, and Mechanicville, New York, now uses the Stony Brook Branch and the old main line north of Lowell. At Lowell, it shifts to the B&amp;M&#x27;s original Lowell Branch to get to the B&amp;M main line towards Maine.

During the years since B&amp;M&#x27;s bankruptcy, highway congestion has increased significantly, resulting in growing demand for passenger and freight options. During this time frame, the MBTA has been slowly investing in some infrastructure changes in its rail operations. In 1995, a new North Station was opened. In 2001, it opened the Anderson Regional Transportation Center on the Boston &amp; Lowell to centralize ridership and provide a superstation with convenient access to Interstates 93 and 95 (Route 128). In southern Maine, frustration with bus service drove the state to explore restarting passenger service, resulting in contracting with Amtrak to operate the &quot;Downeaster&quot;, which runs from North Station to Haverhill and up to Portland. Due to scheduling conflicts with the MBTA, the &quot;Downeaster&quot; runs up the Lowell Line to Wilmington and then out the old B&amp;M Wildcat Branch to the Haverhill/Reading Line. This route allows the &quot;Downeaster&quot; to pass a commuter train on the Haverhill/Reading Line without schedule conflicts. The route is also historically significant because it is the same route that the original B&amp;M used to Portland.

<text>MS &quot;Norgoma&quot; was a Canadian package freighter and passenger ferry, that could also transport automobiles on a limited basis. Originally constructed as a steam-powered ship in 1950, SS &quot;Norgoma&quot; primarily sailed the route from her home port of Owen Sound to Sault Ste. Marie, providing a five-day round trip, once a week, serving isolated communities along the north shore of Lake Huron. After conversion to a motor ship, &quot;Norgoma&quot; was transferred to the popular Manitoulin Island ferry route between Tobermory and South Baymouth along with her sister ship SS &quot;Norisle&quot;, replacing the smaller ferry, MS &quot;Normac&quot;, on that route.

&quot;Norgoma&quot;, owned by Owen Sound Transportation Company Limited, was built at the Collingwood shipyards in 1950. She replaced the SS &quot;Manitoulin&quot;, which was retired in 1949.

&quot;Norgoma&quot; travelled mainly on the North Channel route until 1963. Improvements to Ontario&#x27;s highways, such as the Trans-Canada Highway (Georgian Bay Route) completed in 1962, brought about stiff competition for the company. In that year a 60-kilometre road was constructed to Killarney, the first port of call for the steamer. At the same, increased traffic on the Manitoulin Island – Tobermory route (Highway 68) demanded a greater automobile capacity than her sister ships SS &quot;Norisle&quot; and MS &quot;Normac&quot; could handle.

In 1963 the ship was refitted with a diesel engine to replace her original steam engine and boiler, to increase automobile capacity. As steam was still required to operate deck winches and the anchor windlass, a vapour steam generator, similar to those used on railway locomotives, was installed on the ship. MS &quot;Norgoma&quot; made her debut on the Tobermory run in 1964. According to Captain Schrieber, who captained &quot;Norgoma&quot;, it was the first vessel that he commanded where he witnessed livestock showing signs of seasickness.

In 1974, both &quot;Norgoma&quot; and &quot;Norisle&quot; were replaced by the much larger and more modern &quot;MS Chi-Cheemaun&quot; which could accommodate more vehicles than both sister ships put together. &quot;Norgoma&quot; was berthed as a museum ship in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. In 1981 the ship was transferred to a charity, the St. Mary&#x27;s River Marine Heritage Centre.

In early 2019 Sault Ste. Marie City Council put pressure on the charity to move the &quot;Norgoma&quot;. The charity proposed moving the vessel to a mooring point at Roberta Bondar Park, where the tour boat Chief Shingwauk used to board tourists. However city officials pointed out the &quot;Norgoma&quot; was too large too moor at this dock, without jutting into the shipping channel, preventing visiting cruise vessels from mooring. On June 4, 2019, the &quot;Norgoma&quot; was moved to an alternate mooring site, on property previously owned by Algoma Steel, a site not open to the public. In September 2019, citing breach of the 1981 agreement, the City repossessed the ship and put her for sale.

A planned sale of the vessel to Dwor Metal company fell through in January of 2023. The company&#x27;s owner had planned to renovate the vessel for private use, but the transaction fell through. The vessel remains moored on the former Algoma Steel property as of January 2023.
