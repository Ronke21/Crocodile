<text>An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a harmful, unintended result caused by taking medication. ADRs may occur following a single dose or prolonged administration of a drug or may result from the combination of two or more drugs. The meaning of this term differs from the term &quot;side effect&quot; because side effects can be beneficial as well as detrimental. The study of ADRs is the concern of the field known as &quot;pharmacovigilance&quot;. An adverse event (AE) refers to any unexpected and inappropriate occurrence at the time a drug is used, whether or not the event is associated with the administration of the drug. An ADR is a special type of AE in which a causative relationship can be shown. ADRs are only one type of medication-related harm. Another type of medication-related harm type includes not taking prescribed medications, known as non-adherence. Non-adherence to medications can lead to death and other negative outcomes. Adverse drug reactions require the use of a medication.
==Classification==

===Traditional===
* Type A: augmented pharmacological effects, which are dose-dependent and predictable
:Type A reactions, which constitute approximately 80% of adverse drug reactions, are usually a consequence of the drug&#x27;s primary pharmacological effect (e.g., bleeding when using the anticoagulant warfarin) or a low therapeutic index of the drug (e.g., nausea from digoxin), and they are therefore predictable. They are dose-related and usually mild, although they may be serious or even fatal (e.g. intracranial bleeding from warfarin). Such reactions are usually due to inappropriate dosage, especially when drug elimination is impaired. The term &quot;side effects&quot; may be applied to minor type A reactions.
* Type B: Type B reactions are not dose-dependent and are not predictable, and so may be called &quot;idiosyncratic&quot;. These reactions can be due to particular elements within the person or the environment.

Types A and B were proposed in the 1970s, and the other types were proposed subsequently when the first two proved insufficient to classify ADRs.

Other types of adverse drug reactions are Type C, Type D, Type E, and Type F. Type C was categorized for chronic adverse drug reactions, Type D for delayed adverse drug reactions, Type E for withdrawal adverse drug reactions, and Type F for failure of therapy as an adverse drug reaction. Adverse drug reactions can also be categorized using time-relatedness, dose-relatedness, and susceptibility, which collectively are called the DoTS classification.

===Seriousness===
The U.S Food and Drug Administration defines a serious adverse event as one when the patient outcome is one of the following:
* Death
* Life-threatening
* Hospitalization (initial or prolonged)
* Disability — significant, persistent, or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in the patient&#x27;s body function/structure, physical activities or quality of life.
* Congenital abnormality
* Requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage

Severity is a measure of the intensity of the adverse event in question. The terms &quot;severe&quot; and &quot;serious&quot;, when applied to adverse events, are technically very different. They are easily confused but can not be used interchangeably, requiring care in usage. Seriousness usually indicates patient outcome (such as negative outcomes including disability, long-term effects, and death).

In adverse drug reactions, the seriousness of the reaction is important for reporting.

==Location==
Some ocular antihypertensives cause systemic effects, although they are administered locally as eye drops, since a fraction escapes to the systemic circulation.

==Mechanisms==
===Abnormal pharmacokinetics===
====Comorbid disease states====
Various diseases, especially those that cause renal or hepatic insufficiency, may alter drug metabolism. Resources are available that report changes in a drug&#x27;s metabolism due to disease states.

The Medication Appropriateness Tool for Comorbid Health Conditions in Dementia (MATCH-D) criteria warns that people with dementia are more likely to experience adverse effects, and that they are less likely to be able to reliably report symptoms.

====Genetic factors====
Pharmacogenomics includes how genes can predict potential adverse drug reactions. However, pharmacogenomics is not limited to adverse events (of any type), but also looks at how genes may impact other responses to medications, such as low/no effect or expected/normal responses (especially based on drug metabolism).

Abnormal drug metabolism may be due to inherited factors of either Phase I oxidation or Phase II conjugation.

=====Phase I reactions=====
Phase I reactions include metabolism by cytochrome P450. Patients have abnormal metabolism by cytochrome P450 due to either inheriting abnormal alleles or due to drug interactions. Tables are available to check for drug interactions due to P450 interactions.

Inheriting abnormal butyrylcholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) may affect metabolism of drugs such as succinylcholine.

=====Phase II reactions=====
Inheriting abnormal &quot;N&quot;-acetyltransferase which conjugated some drugs to facilitate excretion may affect the metabolism of drugs such as isoniazid, hydralazine, and procainamide.

Inheriting abnormal thiopurine &quot;S&quot;-methyltransferase may affect the metabolism of the thiopurine drugs mercaptopurine and azathioprine.

=====Protein binding=====
Protein binding interactions are usually transient and mild until a new steady state is achieved. These are mainly for drugs without much first-pass liver metabolism. The principal plasma proteins for drug binding are:
# albumin
# α1-acid glycoprotein
# lipoproteins
Some drug interactions with warfarin are due to changes in protein binding.

===Drug interactions===
The risk of drug interactions is increased with polypharmacy, especially in older adults.

====Additive drug effects====

Two or more drugs that contribute to the same mechanism in the body can have additive toxic or adverse effects. One example of this is multiple medications administered concurrently that prolong the QT interval, such as antiarrhythmics like sotalol and some macrolide antibiotics, such as systemic azithromycin. Another example of additive effects for adverse drug reactions is in serotonin toxicity (serotonin syndrome). If medications that cause increased serotonin levels are combined, they can cause serotonin toxicity (though therapeutic doses of one agent that increases serotonin levels can cause serotonin toxicity in certain cases and individuals). Some of the medications that can contribute to serotonin toxicity include MAO inhibitors, SSRIs, and tricyclic antidepressants.

====Altered metabolism====

Some medications can either inhibit or induce key drug metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters, which when combined with other medications that utilize the same proteins can lead to either toxic or sub-therapeutic adverse effects. One example of this is a patient taking a cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor such as the antibiotic clarithromycin, as well as another medication metabolized by CYP3A4 such as the anticoagulant apixaban, which results in elevated blood concentrations of apixaban and greater risk of serious bleeds. Additionally, Clarithromycin is a permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux pump inhibitor, which when given with apixaban (a substrate for P-gp) will lead to increased absorption of apixaban, resulting in the same adverse effects as with CYP3A4 inhibition.

==Assessing causality==
Causality assessment is used to determine the likelihood that a drug caused a suspected ADR. There are a number of different methods used to judge causation, including the Naranjo algorithm, the Venulet algorithm and the WHO causality term assessment criteria. Each have pros and cons associated with their use and most require some level of expert judgement to apply.
An ADR should not be labeled as &#x27;certain&#x27; unless the ADR abates with a challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge protocol (stopping and starting the agent in question). The chronology of the onset of the suspected ADR is important, as another substance or factor may be implicated as a cause; co-prescribed medications and underlying psychiatric conditions may be factors in the ADR.

Assigning causality to a specific agent often proves difficult, unless the event is found during a clinical study or large databases are used. Both methods have difficulties and can be fraught with error. Even in clinical studies, some ADRs may be missed as large numbers of test individuals are required to find a specific adverse drug reaction, especially for rare ADRs. Psychiatric ADRs are often missed as they are grouped together in the questionnaires used to assess the population.

==Monitoring bodies==
Many countries have official bodies that monitor drug safety and reactions. On an international level, the WHO runs the Uppsala Monitoring Centre. The European Union runs the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for monitoring post-marketing studies. The FDA has a reporting system called the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, where individuals can report adverse drug events. Healthcare professionals, consumers, and the pharmaceutical industry can all submit information to this system. For health products marketed in Canada, a branch of Health Canada called The Canada Vigilance Program is responsible for surveillance. Both healthcare professionals and consumers can report to this program. In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) conducts postmarket monitoring of therapeutic products. In the UK, a monitoring system called the Yellow Card Scheme was established in 1964. The Yellow Card Scheme was set up to surveil medications and other health products.

==Epidemiology==
A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that in 2011, sedatives and hypnotics were a leading source for adverse drug events seen in the hospital setting. Approximately 2.8% of all ADEs present on admission and 4.4% of ADEs that originated during a hospital stay were caused by a sedative or hypnotic drug. A second study by AHRQ found that in 2011, the most common specifically identified causes of adverse drug events that originated during hospital stays in the U.S. were steroids, antibiotics, opiates/narcotics, and anticoagulants. Patients treated in urban teaching hospitals had higher rates of ADEs involving antibiotics and opiates/narcotics compared to those treated in urban nonteaching hospitals. Those treated in private, nonprofit hospitals had higher rates of most ADE causes compared to patients treated in public or private, for-profit hospitals.

Medication related harm (MRH) is common after hospital discharge in older adults, but methodological inconsistencies between studies and a paucity of data on risk factors limits clear understanding of the epidemiology. There was a wide range in incidence, from 0.4% to 51.2% of participants, and 35% to 59% of harm was preventable. Medication related harm incidence within 30 days after discharge ranged from 167 to 500 events per 1,000 individuals discharged (17–51% of individuals).

In the U.S., females had a higher rate of ADEs involving opiates and narcotics than males in 2011, while male patients had a higher rate of anticoagulant ADEs. Nearly 8 in 1,000 adults aged 65 years or older experienced one of the four most common ADEs (steroids, antibiotics, opiates/narcotics, and anticoagulants) during hospitalization. A study showed that 48% of patients had an adverse drug reaction to at least one drug, and pharmacist involvement helps to pick up adverse drug reactions.

In 2012, McKinsey &amp; Company concluded that the cost of the 50-100 million preventable error-related adverse drug events would be between US$18–115 billion.

An article published in The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in 2016 reported adverse drug event statistics from emergency departments around the United States in 2013-2014. From this article, an estimated prevalence of adverse drug events that were presented to the emergency department (ED) was 4 events out of every 1000 people. This article reported that 57.1% of these adverse drug events presented to the ED were in females. As well, out of all of the adverse drug events presented to the emergency department documented in this article, 17.6% were from anticoagulants, 16.1% were from antibiotics, and 13.3% from diabetic agents.

While 3.dxe5 dxe5 4.Qxd8, transposing into an endgame, may initially appear to be favorable for White as Black&#x27;s king won&#x27;t be able to castle, the pawn on c4 will restrict the mobility of the white-squared bishop, so the endgame is comfortable for Black to maintain .

==Gambit lines==
* Lisbon Gambit: 3.dxe5 Nc6, which usually continues 4.exd6 Bxd6 (or 4...Qxd6).
* Pounds Gambit: 3.dxe5 Be6.

<doc id="1274854" wikidata="Q7120463" url="?curid=1274854" title="Pennsylvania Railroad class B6">
<text>The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s class B6 was its most successful class of switcher locomotive, or as the PRR termed them &quot;shifter&quot;. The PRR preferred the 0-6-0 wheel arrangement for larger switchers, whereas on other railroads the 0-8-0 gained preference. The PRR generally used 2-8-0s when larger power was required.

== History ==
Altoona Works constructed the prototype B6 in 1902. The B6 had the Pennsylvania&#x27;s trademark square-shouldered Belpaire firebox and drivers. They were constructed as saturated steam engines, rebuilt with superheaters later as class B6s, and had Piston valves and Stephenson valve gear. A total of 79 were built by Baldwin and Lima, in addition to Altoona, between 1902 and 1913.

The next version built was the B6sa, 55 of which were built at Altoona during 1913–1914. These had radial-stay fireboxes, common elsewhere but rare on the Pennsylvania, and they replaced the Stephenson gear with the more modern Walschaerts valve gear. Steam delivery pipes were outside, like all other PRR modern power. All were built superheated.

Finally, during 1916–1920, 238 of class B6sb were built. These were the final, definitive type, and had a Belpaire firebox, but were otherwise little changed from the B6sa. The final 97 locomotives had piston valves mounted outboard of the cylinders, instead of inbound as previously built, giving the cylinder assemblies an outward cant at the top, rather than inward.

All B6sa and B6sb locomotives were retrofitted with power reverse to make the frequent back-and-forth of switching quicker and easier.

The last PRR locomotive in active service was #5244, leased to Union Transportation of New Egypt, New Jersey until July 1959. This was considered quite an achievement considering the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s extensive steam program.

In 1939, toy train manufacturer Lionel introduced their version of Pennsy&#x27;s B6 in several variations including a scale version (scale couplers and smaller flanges to operate on special track) along with six versions of what would later become known as &quot;semi-scale.&quot;

Two B6s survive:

- B6sb #1670 was saved in the PRR&#x27;s historic collection at Northumberland, Pennsylvania and was donated to the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania along with the majority of that collection.

- B6sa #60 was on a siding in Hockessin, Delaware, along the Wilmington and Western Railroad. It has a larger tender, from a 2-8-0 Consolidation, but it is intact, albeit in poor condition. In 2019–2020, it was donated to the Historic Red Clay Valley Inc., and the locomotive remains on a siding near Mt. Cuba. B6sa #60 then was moved to the Wilmington and Western&#x27;s railroad shops in Wilmington, Delaware on May 9, 2024 where it will be cosmetically restored and then put on display as an exhibit in Lewes, Delaware.

<doc id="1274863" wikidata="Q672782" url="?curid=1274863" title="Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)">
<text>Arthur or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire, often referred to simply as Arthur, is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Kinks, released on 10 October 1969. It was the first Kinks album to feature bassist John Dalton, who replaced Pete Quaife after the latter&#x27;s departure. Kinks frontman Ray Davies constructed the concept album as the soundtrack to a Granada Television play and developed the storyline with novelist Julian Mitchell; the television programme was never produced. The rough plot revolved around Arthur Morgan, a carpet-layer, who was based on Ray and guitarist Dave Davies&#x27; brother-in-law Arthur Anning. A stereo version was released internationally with a mono version being released in the UK, but not in the US. 

The album was met with poor sales but nearly unanimous acclaim, especially among the American music press. Although &quot;Arthur&quot; and its first two singles, &quot;Drivin and &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, failed to chart in the UK, the Kinks returned to the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts after a two-year absence with &quot;Victoria&quot;, the lead single in the US, peaking at number 62. The album itself reached number 105 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, their highest position for three years. &quot;Arthur&quot; paved the way for the further success of the Kinks&#x27; 1970 comeback album &quot;Lola Versus Powerman and the Moneygoround, Part One&quot;.

== Background ==

British production company Granada TV approached Ray Davies in early January 1969, expressing interest in developing a film or play for television. Davies was to collaborate with writer Julian Mitchell on the &quot;experimental&quot; programme, with a soundtrack by the Kinks to be released on an accompanying LP. Agreements were finalised on 8 January, and the project was revealed at a press release on 10 March. Separately, the Kinks began work on the programme&#x27;s companion record, entitled &quot;Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)&quot;.

Development of &quot;Arthur&quot; occurred during a rough period for the band, due to the commercial failure of their previous album &quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot; and the subsequent single, &quot;Plastic Man&quot;, as well as the departure of founding member and bassist Pete Quaife. In early 1969, Quaife had told the band he was leaving, though the other members did not take the remark seriously because Quaife had left the band in 1966 after breaking his leg in a car accident, only to have a change of heart and rejoin shortly afterwards. When an article in the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; mentioned Maple Oak, the band he had formed without the rest of the Kinks&#x27; knowledge, Davies unsuccessfully asked Quaife to return for the upcoming sessions of &quot;Arthur&quot;. Bassist John Dalton, who had briefly replaced Quaife when the latter had quit three years prior, was asked by drummer Mick Avory to rejoin the band.

Ray Davies travelled to United Recording Studios in Los Angeles on 11 April 1969, to produce American band the Turtles&#x27; LP &quot;Turtle Soup&quot; with engineer Chuck Britz. While in Los Angeles, Davies helped negotiate an end to the concert ban placed on the Kinks by the American Federation of Musicians in 1965. Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, at the time it was widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. After negotiations with Davies, the Federation allowed the group to return to touring in America. Once the main sessions for the Turtles LP were completed, Davies returned to England.

While Davies was abroad, the other members of the band had been rehearsing and practising for the upcoming album, as well as lead guitarist Dave Davies&#x27; solo album, nicknamed &quot;A Hole in the Sock of&quot;. When Ray returned, the Kinks regrouped at his house in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, to rehearse &quot;Arthur&quot;.

== Recording ==

The group turned to the recording proper on 1 May 1969. The first tracks worked on were &quot;Drivin, intended as their next single release, and &quot;Mindless Child of Motherhood&quot;, written by Dave Davies (the latter would eventually be used as the B-side to &quot;Drivin, and was not included on the LP). The Kinks began a two-week series of focused sessions on 5 May, laying down an early version of the entire &quot;Arthur&quot; album. Recording was interrupted when the Kinks travelled to Beirut, Lebanon on 17 May to play three dates at the Melkart Hotel; sessions for &quot;Arthur&quot; resumed the day after their return, and most of the recording for the album was finished by the end of the month. Mixing and dubbing began in early June, with arranger Lew Warburton handling string overdubs. The Kinks played a few small gigs in England throughout the remainder of the month, but devoted most of their time to finishing Dave Davies&#x27; solo album.

Writing for the TV play progressed through May and June, and on 15 June mixing for Dave Davies&#x27; solo LP was completed (tapes for this record were eventually delivered to Pye and Reprise Records, although it never saw official release). A press release announced that the &quot;Arthur&quot; LP was scheduled for a late July release. As Davies and Mitchell completed their script, the &quot;Arthur&quot; TV play began to crystallise, and British filmmaker Leslie Woodhead was assigned the role of director. By early September production was scheduled to begin, with a planned broadcast of late September, but these plans were continually delayed. As problems with the TV play got progressively worse—and, consequently, distracted the Kinks from completing the post-production of the album—the release dates for both projects were pushed further and further back. In early October Ray Davies moved from Borehamwood back to his old family home on Fortis Green, in Muswell Hill, and travelled to Los Angeles, where he delivered the tapes to Reprise for &quot;Arthur&quot;&#x27;s American release. The album&#x27;s release date was set for 10 October, and the Kinks began gearing up for an upcoming US tour to support the album, for which they would depart on 17 October. Shooting for the TV play was set for 1 December. Roy Stonehouse was hired as a designer, and the casting was completed, but the show was cancelled at the last minute when the producer was unable to secure financial backing. Davies and Mitchell were frustrated at an entire year&#x27;s work wasted: Doug Hinman said Davies witnessed &quot;his grand artistic visions once again dashed by bureaucracy and internal politics&quot;.

== Story and theme ==

The story is partially inspired by the Davies brothers&#x27; older sister Rose, who emigrated to Australia in 1964 with her husband Arthur Anning. Her departure devastated Ray Davies, and it inspired him to write the song &quot;Rosy Won&#x27;t You Please Come Home&quot;, included on the 1966 album &quot;Face to Face&quot;. The lead character in the album, the fictional Arthur Morgan—modelled after Anning—is a carpet layer whose family&#x27;s plight in the opportunity-poor setting of post-war England is depicted. Writer Julian Mitchell detailed the story line and characters in depth, explaining in the liner notes for the album&#x27;s LP release:

Davies later commented in his autobiography, &quot;X-Ray&quot;, that Anning later &quot;told me that he... knew it [&quot;Arthur&quot;] had been partly inspired by him... [it] reminded him of home... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, saying that he was flattered.&quot; With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England Arthur once knew (&quot;Victoria&quot;, &quot;Young and Innocent Days&quot;), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons (&quot;Australia&quot;), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home (&quot;Shangri-La&quot;), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War (&quot;Mr. Churchill Says&quot;), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war (&quot;She&#x27;s Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina&quot;), and the death of his brother in World War I (&quot;Yes Sir, No Sir&quot;, &quot;Some Mother&#x27;s Son&quot;).

== Release ==

&quot;Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)&quot; was released in the UK and US on 10 October 1969. It was the last Kinks album to be released in mono, and the mono edition was not released in the US. The album set the stage for the Kinks&#x27; return to touring the United States in late 1969, and paved the way for even greater commercial success with the hit song &quot;Lola&quot; in 1970.

=== Singles and chart performance ===

While the sessions for &quot;Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)&quot; were nearing completion in June 1969, the track &quot;Drivin was released as a single in the UK, backed with &quot;Mindless Child of Motherhood&quot;. For the first time since their breakthrough in 1964, a Kinks single failed to make an impression on the UK charts—Johnny Rogan notes that &quot;This was the first of two pilot singles for... &quot;Arthur&quot; and its failure did not augur well&quot;. The group followed with another single in September, &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, which again failed to chart in the UK. As with &quot;Village Green&quot;, the album itself failed to chart when released in October.

In the US, &quot;Victoria&quot; was the lead single, backed with the album track &quot;Brainwashed&quot;, and was released the same week as the LP. The single reached number 62 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—their highest position since their Top 20 hit &quot;Sunny Afternoon&quot; in 1966. The success of the single led to its release in the UK; backed with &quot;Mr. Churchill Says&quot;, it reached a peak of number 30. &quot;Arthur&quot; itself was a moderate commercial success in the US, where it peaked at number 105, and remained on the charts for 20 weeks.

=== Promotion ===

Reprise Records, the Kinks&#x27; US label, devised an elaborate, multi-levelled promotional campaign for &quot;Arthur&quot; in early 1969. The most famous branch of the programme involved a promo package entitled &quot;God Save the Kinks&quot;. The set featured various items, including a consumer&#x27;s guide to the band&#x27;s albums, a bag of &quot;grass&quot; from the &quot;Daviesland village green&quot;, and an LP entitled &quot;Then, Now and Inbetween&quot;. The set was accompanied by a positive letter from Hal Halverstadt of creative services at Warner/Reprise, part of which read, &quot;...[We are led] to believe that the Kinks may not have had it at all... The Kinks are to be supported, encouraged, cheered. And saved.&quot; The campaign was officially launched on 3 July, at a meeting between Ray Davies and Reprise executives in Burbank, California. Reprise considered seeding false stories in the press to create an &quot;outlaw&quot; image for the group as part of the campaign, including pieces about marijuana possession and income tax evasion. Ray called the idea &quot;mad&quot;, and the programme was dropped. Several pieces were used in the press kit for &quot;Arthur&quot;″s release, with titles including &quot;English Pop Group Arrested on Rape Rap&quot;.

=== Packaging and liner notes ===

Artwork for &quot;Arthur&quot; was created by Bob Lawrie. The album was packaged in a gatefold sleeve, and included a shaped insert depicting Queen Victoria (holding a house containing Arthur Morgan), with lyrics on the reverse. Liner notes in the UK were written by Geoffrey Cannon and Julian Mitchell; in the US, notes by rock critic John Mendelsohn replaced Cannon&#x27;s.

==Critical reception==
The album was critically acclaimed at the time of release, especially in the US rock press. It was favourably compared to &quot;Tommy&quot; by the Who, released earlier in the year. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Arthur&quot; was spotlighted in its lead section, with back-to-back reviews by Mike Daly and Greil Marcus. Daly called it &quot;an album that is a masterpiece on every level: Ray Davies&#x27; finest hour, the Kinks&#x27; supreme achievement&quot;. Marcus also praised the album, calling it &quot;Less ambitious than &quot;Tommy&quot;, and far more musical... &quot;Arthur&quot; is by all odds the best British album of 1969. It shows that Pete Townshend still has worlds to conquer and that the Beatles have a lot of catching up to do.&quot; A review by Sal Imam ran in Boston&#x27;s &quot;Fusion&quot; magazine read that &quot;If &quot;Tommy&quot; was the greatest rock opera, then &quot;Arthur&quot; most surely is the greatest rock musical.&quot; Writing in his &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave the record a positive review, saying that although Ray Davies&#x27; lyrics could get &quot;petulant and preachy at times&quot;, the album featured &quot;excellent music and production&quot;.

Reception in the UK was not as warm, although reviews were still generally positive. &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot; commented that &quot;&quot;Arthur&quot; works as a complete score because it is basic and simple and pleasing to the ear, and powerfully conjures up pictures in the eye.&quot; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; seconded Mike Daly&#x27;s comments in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, again calling it &quot;Ray Davies&#x27; finest hour&quot;, and adding that it was &quot;beautifully British to the core&quot;. Doug Hinman later commented on the album&#x27;s reception in Britain: &quot;In the British music press there [was] less celebration, and coverage [was] relatively routine, though everyone saw the rock opera angle.&quot;

===Reappraisal===
Today the album receives generally positive reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said &quot;Arthur&quot; was &quot;one of the most effective concept albums in rock history, as well as one of the best and most influential British pop records of its era&quot;, and in 2003 Matt Golden of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; called it &quot;the best rock opera ever&quot;. &quot;Switch&quot; magazine included &quot;Arthur&quot; on their &quot;100 Best Albums of the 20th Century&quot; in 1999, and in 2003 &quot;Mojo&quot; featured the album on their list of the &quot;Top 50 Most Eccentric Albums&quot;.

The album is included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="1274866" wikidata="Q324484" url="?curid=1274866" title="Valeriy Lobanovskyi">
<text>Valeriy Vasylyovych Lobanovskyi (, ; 6 January 1939 – 13 May 2002) was а Soviet and Ukrainian football player and manager. He was Master of Sports of the USSR, Distinguished Coach of the USSR, and a laureate of the UEFA Order of Merit in Ruby (2002) and FIFA Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded by FIFA. In 2002 he was awarded the Hero of Ukraine award (posthumously), his nation&#x27;s highest honour, for his contribution to Ukrainian football. In 2008, Lobanovskyi was ranked 6th in Inter&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Ukrainians&quot; following a nationwide poll that saw around 2.5 million people casting their votes.

Lobanovskyi is most famous for his spells managing FC Dynamo Kyiv and the USSR national football team. Lobanovskyi established Dynamo as the most dominant club in Soviet football in the 1970s and 1980s, winning the Soviet Top League eight times and the Soviet Cup six times in 16 years. In 1975 his Dynamo Kyiv team became the first side from the Soviet Union to win a major European trophy when they beat Hungarian side Ferencváros in the final of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. During the tournament, Dynamo Kyiv won eight games out of nine, resulting in a winning percentage of 88.88% – a record that stood for 45 years encompassing all of the major European club football competitions. Lobanovskyi and his team repeated their Cup Winners&#x27; Cup success in 1986, beating Atletico Madrid in the final. In both 1975 and 1986, two of Dynamo&#x27;s players (Oleg Blokhin and Igor Belanov respectively) were also awarded the Ballon d&#x27;Or under his tutelage. During Lobanovskyi&#x27;s first two stints, the team also reached the European Cup semi-finals in 1977 and 1987 and quarter-finals in 1976, 1982 and 1983. With the Soviet Union national team, Lobanovskyi reached the finals of Euro 1988, losing to eventual winners the Netherlands, and won the bronze medal at the 1976 Summer Olympic Games.

After returning to Dynamo Kyiv in 1997 for the third time, Lobanovskyi led the team to another successful run in European competition. In the first full season of his third spell, Dynamo reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League in 1998, topping a group that included FC Barcelona, Newcastle United and PSV Eindhoven, famously winning both games against Barcelona, 3–0 in Kyiv and 4–0 at Camp Nou. The following season, Lobanovskyi and his team reached the semi-finals, where they were knocked out by Bayern Munich, with star striker Andriy Shevchenko finishing third in the 1999 Ballon d&#x27;Or poll.

Lobanovskyi is highly regarded due to his achievements as a coach and is widely considered one of the greatest managers of all time. Throughout his coaching career Lobanovskyi won 33 official trophies, becoming the second most decorated manager of all time (behind Alex Ferguson) and the most successful football manager of the 20th century. He also holds several managerial records in Soviet football, including most Soviet Top League titles, most Soviet Cup wins (shared with Viktor Maslov) and most USSR Super Cup wins. Lobanovskyi is the only manager to win a major European competition with an Eastern European club twice. He is one of four managers to win the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup twice, and one of two (along with Nereo Rocco) to accomplish the feat with the same team. Lobanovskyi has also won the Ukrainian championship five times out of five – an accomplishment not matched by any other manager. Lobanovskyi has coached three Ballon d&#x27;Or winners — Oleh Blokhin, Igor Belanov and Andriy Shevchenko. In 2007, &quot;The Times&quot; included him on its list of the top 50 managers of all time, and in 2020, &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; ranked him at No. 10 on its special list of the Top 100 football managers of all time.

==Early life==
Valeriy Lobanovskyi was born on 6 January 1939 in Kyiv. His father was a factory worker, while his mother was a housewife. He studied at the Kyiv school No.319 (now Valeriy Lobanovskyi Prospect, 146), where a plaque commemorating Lobanovskyi is installed and the school itself has been renamed in his honor. In 1956 he joined the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute but later transferred to the Odesa Polytechnic Institute, where he graduated.

==Playing career==
Lobanovskyi was a graduate of the Kyiv Football School No. 1 and the Football School of Youth in Kyiv (first coach — Mykola Chayka).

At the age of 18, Lobanovskyi was invited to the B-squad of Dynamo Kyiv, the most prominent Ukrainian football club at the time. His debut in the Soviet Top League came on 29 May 1959 against CSK MO Moscow. Lobanovskyi became famous for his ability to accurately deliver curled balls from corner and free kicks (so-called &quot;curl&quot;) — often Lobanovskyi was able to score the goal directly from the corner. He had regularly been working on these shots during training sessions, using Magnus effect and his own calculations. The Soviet press compared him to Brazilian forward Didi who regularly curved the ball in a similar way at the 1958 World Cup. Teammates often praised Lobanovskyi for his unorthodox mindset and ability to use dribbling, which was unusual for such tall (187 cm) players.

Since 1960, Lobanovskyi was a full-fledged member of the starting line-up. He was mostly used as a left winger, where he formed a duo with Valentyn Troyanovskyi. That same year he became the club&#x27;s top goalscorer with 13 goals. In 1961, Dynamo Kyiv became the first football team not from Moscow to win USSR title, with Lobanovskyi scoring 10 goals. He was regularly invited to the national team, but due to strong opposition (at the time there were many top-level left-wingers in Soviet Union like Mikheil Meskhi, Anatoli Ilyin and Galimzyan Khusainov) was able to play only two international games, against Austria and Poland.

Overall he spent seven years with the club before leaving in 1964 due to conflict with the coach Viktor Maslov. Lobanovskyi finished his career after brief spells at Chornomorets Odesa and Shakhtar Donetsk. Lobanovskyi ended his playing career at the age of 29 having scored 71 goals in 253 games in the Soviet Top League (42 goals in 144 matches with Dynamo Kyiv, 15 goals in 59 matches with Chornomorets and 14 goals in 50 matches with Shakhtar).

==Coaching career==

=== Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk (1968–1973) ===
A year after retiring as a player Lobanovskyi was named the manager of FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk on 16 October 1968. That year Dnipro ended up third in the Group 3 (Ukrainian SSR group) of the &quot;Class A, group 2&quot;. The team won its group next year and entered the league finals, finishing second. In 1970, the league system was reformed and Dnipro entered the newly created &quot;Class A, group 1&quot; (later renamed to &quot;Soviet First League&quot;), which the team won the following year, moving to the Top League. In its first season at the highest level, the club ended up sixth, one point away from silver medals.

=== Dynamo Kyiv (1973–1982), Soviet Union national team (1975–1976, 1982–1983) ===
Lobanovskyi moved to his former club, Dynamo Kyiv, who were impressed by his accomplishments with Dnipro, in October 1973. In January 1974 he was joined by his former teammate, Oleh Bazylevych. These two would work as a coaching duo until October 1976. Both managers had equal rights: Bazylevych was a theorist, and Lobanovskyi was in charge of the training process. During their first season, the Soviet press often criticized them for rationalism and unwillingness to play attacking football (the so-called &quot;away model&quot; — the team would play away games defensively to score a draw). In that season, the team won both the league and Soviet Cup.

Both Lobanovskyi and Bazylevych understood the importance of accurate calculation of the physical load on players. With cooperation from Anatoly Zelentsov, a scientist from the department of physical education theory of Kyiv State Institute of Physical Education, Lobanovskyi brought a system of calculation of the training process and mathematical modeling of physical load for the team. Zelentsov later headed Dynamo Kyiv&#x27;s scientific laboratory, which was popularly called &quot;the Zelentsov Center&quot;. Lobanovskyi was credited for inventing a style of play in which any outfield player can take over the role of any other player in a team, similarly to what was practiced by Rinus Michels at the same time in Netherlands. Unlike Michels, however, Lobanovskyi was developing his style of play scientifically, with a strong emphasis on pressing.

In 1975, Dynamo Kyiv won the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and then-highly regarded European Super Cup. Dynamo Kyiv became the first Soviet club to win a major European trophy. In the first three rounds of Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, the team defeated CSKA Sofia, Eintracht Frankfurt and Bursaspor, winning all home and away games. In semifinals, Dynamo faced the 1974–75 Eredivisie winner, PSV Eindhoven. The Dutch club was considered one of the most powerful in Europe, being sponsored by Philips. The first leg played in Kyiv ended up 3–0 in favor of Lobanovskyi&#x27;s team. After losing 1–2 in the second leg, Dynamo Kyiv moved to the final. On 14 May 1975, Dynamo Kyiv won Cup Winners&#x27; Cup for the first time, defeating Ferencváros 3–0 in the final. During the tournament, the team won 88.88% of its matches (8 games out of 9), which remained the best winning record among all European main tournaments&#x27; winning club sides until 2019–20 season when Bayern Munich won all its matches on its way to the Champions League trophy.
In the autumn of that year, Dynamo Kyiv faced the 1974–75 European Cup winner Bayern Munich for the second ever European Super Cup. Besides winning a consecutive European Cup, Bayern was also the base club for the 1974 World Cup winners. The build-up to the match had a political background, mainly in USSR. The Soviet Ukrainian club won both games, 1–0 in Munich and 2–0 in Kyiv in front of 100,000 fans. All goals were scored by Oleg Blokhin who would become Ballon d&#x27;Or winner that year. The Lobanovskyi—Bazylevych duo received the World Sports Coach of the Year award.

The Lobanovskyi–Bazylevych duo was appointed managers of the Soviet national team in 1975, after the team lost its first game in the Euro qualifying group to Ireland 3–0. Dynamo Kyiv became the base club of the national team. Despite Lobanovskyi&#x27;s demands to reorganize national league to autumn-spring format, the USSR Football Federation split 1976 into two seasons (spring and autumn).

Before 1976 season, Lobanovskyi and Bazylevych were pressured by the Moscow officials to accept the Moscow-based Mark Godik as the professional fitness coach to prepare the team for European Cup, Euro qualification and 1976 Summer Olympics. The duo was forced to move the training camp to the mountains where the atmospheric pressure was much higher and the oxygen levels were lower, all while maintaining the same indicators of the intensity of training. The training process was unbalanced, while basic correlation of aerobic and anaerobic exercises was also butchered. Many players struggled during the training process, some players&#x27; measured pulses were above 200 beats per minute.

The club competed in the &quot;spring&quot; season mostly with B-squad, as the first team was able to concentrate on their preparation for the three international tournaments. Dynamo Kyiv left the European Cup after quarterfinals, losing to Saint-Étienne (2–0 in Kyiv and 0–3 in France). The national team won its qualifying group but lost to Czechoslovakia in play-offs, thus failing to qualify at the European championship. After winning bronze medal at the Summer Olympic Games, the coaching duo left the national team.

In the summer of 1976, after a conflict between Kyiv&#x27;s players and managerial stuff, Oleh Bazylevych left the team. In 1977 Dynamo Kyiv regained the USSR championship, losing once in 30 games, and reached semifinals of the European Cup. After winning all games on the road to quarterfinals, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side faced Bayern Munich, the winner of the last three European Cups, for the second time in the last two years. After losing 1–0 in Munich, Kyiv&#x27;s team scored two unanswered goals in the last 10 minutes of the second leg, moving to semifinals and ending Bayern&#x27;s European dominance. In semifinals, however, Dynamo Kyiv was beaten by another German club, Borussia Mönchengladbach.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dynamo was going through generational change. After finishing second and third in the following two years, the team won back-to-back USSR titles in 1980 and 1981. Lobanovskyi led Dynamo Kyiv to European Cup quarter-finals in 1981 and 1982, before leaving the team at the end of 1982 in order to return to managing Soviet national team, being in charge of it during Euro qualification. The team was leading its qualifying group before losing their last match against Portugal in Lisbon, conceding the only goal after an incorrectly ruled penalty (the foul happened outside of the penalty area). Lobanovskyi was sacked again.

=== Return to Dynamo Kyiv (1984–1986) ===
After being sacked by Soviet national team, Lobanovskyi returned to Dynamo Kyiv after just one year of absence. The club, having been led by Yury Morozov in 1983, ended up seventh in the league, the lowest since the spring of 1976, when Kyiv was represented mostly by B-squad. The team was going through crisis, with many key players injured. Dynamo Kyiv finished the 1984 season on tenth place, failing to qualify at UEFA tournaments for the first time in 14 years.

Lobanovskyi saw the problems and knew how to solve them. The coach received team&#x27;s support. Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side started the 1985 season very strongly and in the end captured another Soviet double, defeating their biggest rival, Spartak Moscow, twice throughout the season.

In 1986, Dynamo Kyiv won their second Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. The team lost the first game to Utrecht but then went on an impressive undefeated streak, winning six games and drawing two with a goal difference 25–6. Throughout the tournament, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side won all home games (and final) with at least three goals difference. On the road to the final, the team defeated Rapid Wien, the runner-up of the previous Cup Winners&#x27; Cup edition, 9–2 on aggregate in quarterfinals and Dukla Prague in semifinals. In the final, Dynamo beat Atletico Madrid, led by Luis Aragones, 3–0. The second goal, scored by Oleg Blokhin, was especially memorable, as it was scored after the so-called &quot;fan attack&quot;. Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side was widely praised by the Soviet and European media. Many observers, fascinated by the quality of football shown by Dynamo Kyiv, called their style of play &quot;football of the 21st century&quot;, and the side was labeled as &quot;the team from another planet&quot;.

=== Co-managing Dynamo Kyiv and Soviet Union national team again (1986–1990) ===
Following success with Dynamo Kyiv in Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Lobanovskyi was appointed manager of the national team for the third time. He was asked to manage the side on the eve of the 1986 World Cup. The main squad consisted almost exclusively of Dynamo Kyiv&#x27;s players. In the group stage, Soviet players destroyed Hungary, scoring six unanswered goals, and drew with European champions, France, 1–1. The team confirmed the first place in the group by defeating Canada 2–0 with a B-squad. After an impressive performance, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side were predicted to be one of the favourites to win the tournament. In the first game of the knockout stage, however, Soviet team lost to Belgium in an extra-time, after Belgium scored two goals due to referee&#x27;s mistakes.

At the conclusion of 1986 season, Dynamo Kyiv won the Soviet Top League for the 12th time (7th time during Lobanovskyi&#x27;s time in charge of the club). Igor Belanov was rewarded with Ballon d&#x27;Or, becoming the second Kyiv&#x27;s player to receive the award, while Oleksandr Zavarov ended up 6th. Overall, Dynamo Kyiv&#x27;s players scored the most points during the award&#x27;s voting process, just as they did in 1975.

In 1987, after defeating Beşiktaş twice in European Cup quarterfinals, Dynamo Kyiv extended their unbeaten streak in main UEFA club tournaments to 14 games, the longest unbeaten streak at the time. In the league Dynamo finished sixth but won the Soviet Cup and prestigious Dynamo Games of the USSR. Meanwhile, the Soviet team won its Euro 1988 qualifying group which consisted of East Germany and defending champions, France, as &quot;sbornaja&quot; famously defeated them 0–2 in Paris.

The national team achieved great success at the 1988 European Championship, winning silver medals. In every game, at least seven players of the starting line-up represented Dynamo Kyiv and at least eight Kyiv players entered the field (substitutions including; only two were allowed at the time). &quot;Sbornaja&quot; won its group, defeating Netherlands and England and drawing with Ireland. In semifinals, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side defeated Italy, after Hennadiy Lytovchenko and Oleh Protasov (both Dynamo Kyiv&#x27;s representatives) scored two unanswered goals. In the final, Soviet team met Netherlands again but was unable to repeat their previous victory from the group stage, losing 0–2. Van Basten&#x27;s goal, in which he volleyed right-footed over Rinat Dasayev from the tightest of angles on the right of the penalty area, would later be described as one of the greatest goals in the history of the European Championships.

Following perestroika, many of Lobanovskyi&#x27;s best players left the USSR to play in Western Europe. Going into the 1990 World Cup he could not call upon the best Soviet players. As a result, &quot;sbornaja&quot; finished on the bottom of their group. In the same year, which happened to be the final year of Lobanovskyi&#x27;s career in Soviet Union, Dynamo Kyiv, which was going through generational change, won their fourth Soviet double. The team cemented first place in the Top League weeks before the end, winning its 13th league title and establishing themselves as the most successful Soviet football club of all time. In the Cup final, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s team destroyed Lokomotiv Moscow 6–1. In the autumn of 1990, Lobanovskyi left Soviet Union in order to take a lucrative offer from United Arab Emirates.

=== Middle East (1990–1996) ===
In September 1990, Lobanovskyi decided to leave Soviet Union and take up a lucrative offer of managing the United Arab Emirates national football team. Lobanovskyi is recognized as one of the great managers in the history of the national team. During his four year tenure, the team ended up fourth at the Asian Cup (losing bronze medal to South Korea in a penalty shootout), its best finish up to that date. He left Emirates due to a conflict with Emirates football federation and went on to spend the next two years managing the Kuwait national football team (winning a bronze medal at the Asian Games), before agreeing to return to Dynamo Kyiv in November 1996.

=== Third stint at Dynamo Kyiv (1997–2002) ===
In January 1997, Lobanovskyi returned to manage Dynamo Kyiv for the third time. The club by this time had fallen somewhat from their former heights. The club had been facing little opposition in Ukraine but had little success in European competitions, having been able to enter the Champions League first round only twice in the last five years. During its last European campaign before Lobanovsky&#x27;s return, the team failed to qualify at the group stage of Champions League and was beaten by Neuchâtel Xamax in the first round of the UEFA Cup.

Within a month after Lobanovskyi&#x27;s return, the team won the 1997 edition of the CIS Cup, defeating its biggest rival, Russian champion Spartak Moscow, in the final. The team won the 1996-97 Ukrainian league with 11 points gap against the second best team, Shakhtar Donetsk. At the start of the 1997–98 season, Dynamo Kyiv defeated Brøndby in the qualifying round of the Champions League and entered the group stage. Lobanovskyi&#x27;s team were seeded against FC Barcelona, Newcastle United and PSV Eindhoven. The group was often described as the &quot;death group&quot; of the tournament. In the first two games, however, the team defeated PSV 1–3 in Eindhoven and drew with Newcastle. After that, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side defeated Barcelona, a generally recognized favourite, 3–0 in Kyiv in front of 100,000 fans. In the rematch two weeks later the Spanish team, which were coming off of an away victory against Real Madrid and were leading La Liga, lost the home game to Dynamo Kyiv 0–4, with Andriy Shevchenko scoring hat-trick in the first half. The Ukrainian team won their group after drawing with PSV 1–1. In quarterfinals, Dynamo faced Juventus. Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side were able to draw the first game in Italy but were outclassed 1–4 in Ukraine. On the domestic field, the team won the league and Ukrainian Cup.

At the start of the 1998–99 season, Dynamo struggled to get through qualification. After beating Barry Town with an aggregate score 9–1, the team moved to the Champions League group stage after defeating Sparta Prague in a penalty shootout when both games ended 1–0 in favor of the away team. Dynamo were seeded against Arsenal, Racing Lens and Panathinaikos. The team lost its first game to Panathinaikos in Greece and then drew the home match with Lens, 1–1. Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side then faced Arsenal at Wembley Stadium. In the second half, Andriy Shevchenko scored a goal that was cancelled due to offside. The replay, however, showed that the goal was valid. Instead, Dennis Bergkamp took Arsenal to the lead in the 72nd minute. In the 88th minute, Dynamo equalised after a strike from Serhiy Rebrov to the left corner of the net, and the match finished as a 1–1 draw. In the rematch against Arsenal two weeks later, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s team won after Serhiy Rebrov, Oleksandr Holovko and Andriy Shevchenko took the team to the 3–0 lead and Stephen Hughes scored the only goal for Arsenal in the 82nd minute of the match. Dynamo then defeated Panathinaikos in Kyiv thanks to an own goal from Angelos Basinas. Before the final match, Dynamo, Panathinaikos and Racing Lens had 8 points, while Arsenal earned only 6 points. Panathinaikos lost the home game to Arsenal while the Ukrainian team was able to earn a 3–1 victory against Lens in France, win their group and move to quarter-finals.

In the play-offs, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s team were seeded against the defending champions, Real Madrid. The first match at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium ended in a 1–1 draw. In the rematch in Kyiv, Dynamo won 2–0. All Kyiv&#x27;s goals were scored by Andriy Shevchenko. To this day, Dynamo Kyiv remains the only team not from The Big 5 Leagues, Portugal and Netherlands to enter the Champions League semi-finals since non-champions of the top European leagues were eligible to compete in the competition for the first time. In semi-finals, the team faced Bayern Munich. In the first match in Ukraine, Dynamo were leading 3–1 after fifty minutes of the playing time and missed at least two promising opportunities to score the fourth goal. Instead, Stefan Effenberg reduced Kyiv&#x27;s lead and Carsten Jancker equalised in the 88th minute. Bayern then won the second leg 1–0 and moved to the final. Andriy Shevchenko became Champions League&#x27;s top goalscorer and received the UEFA Club Forward Of The Year award. Shevchenko also ended up third in the 1999 Ballon d&#x27;Or voting process.

In the summer of 1999, Shevchenko was sold to AC Milan, while the team&#x27;s captain Oleh Luzhnyi was transferred to Arsenal. Dynamo won the domestic double for the third consecutive season and ended their Champions League campaign in the second group stage. The team was able to finish second in the first group stage, in a group which consisted of S.S. Lazio, Bayer Leverkusen and Maribor, but ended up third behind Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in the next round, having earned 10 points.

Afterwards, Dynamo&#x27;s second forward, Serhii Rebrov, was sold to Tottenham Hotspur and Kakha Kaladze was bought by AC Milan. With many key players sold, Dynamo Kyiv, which were also going through generational change, was not able to go past the first group stage in the next two seasons. Lobanovskyi won his last trophy in January 2002, when the team won its fourth CIS Cup, having entered the A-squad for the tournament for the first time since 1998. The team won all matches in the competition, defeating Spartak Moscow 4–3 in the final.

Lobanovskyi was appointed manager of the Ukraine national side in March 2000. Once again he was co-managing Dynamo Kyiv and the national team. Lobanovskyi left Ukraine national team after the side failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, losing to Germany in the play-offs.

Under his predecessor Yozhef Sabo, the national squad consisted almost exclusively of Dynamo Kyiv players. Lobanovskyi, despite his own obvious connection with Dynamo, initiated into the national squad many players outside of Dynamo. Anatoliy Tymoshchuk and Andriy Vorobey (from Shakhtar Donetsk), Dmytro Parfenov and Maksym Kalynychenko (from Spartak Moscow), Oleksandr Spivak (from Zenit St. Petersburg), Volodymyr Yezerskiy (from Dnipro) and Andriy Voronin (from Mainz) were all either initiated or given their first starting spots in the national team during his tenure. Together with the Dynamo generation of the late 1990s (Shevchenko, Rebrov, Husin, Vashchuk, Shovkovskyi) these players were to form, after Lobanovskyi&#x27;s death, the core of the team that reached the 2006 World Cup quarter-finals – the first and only time Ukraine has ever qualified at the World Cup – managed by Oleh Blokhin who had worked under Lobanovskyi for 13 years as a Dynamo Kyiv and Soviet Union national team player.

== Death ==

Lobanovskyi had to deal with health issues since 1988, when he suffered his first heart attack. Having come back from the Middle East in 1996, Lobanovskyi looked in a visibly worse shape. He suffered a second heart attack in the autumn of 2001, which required surgery. In 2001, Lobanovskyi missed all away games of Dynamo Kyiv in Champions League due to hypertension and being banned from travelling by air.

On 7 May 2002 during Dynamo Kyiv&#x27;s game against FC Metalurh Zaporizhzhya, Lobanovskyi fainted and was hospitalized with a stroke. Lobanovskyi went through a brain surgery and his health was rated as critical. The press, which regularly monitored Lobanovsky&#x27;s state of health, wrote that there was hope, but Valeriy Lobanovskyi had not regained consciousness. His heart stopped on 13 May at 8:35 pm. At the Champions League final in Glasgow two days later, UEFA held a minute&#x27;s silence in his honour.

Lobanovskyi&#x27;s funeral on 14 May 2002 was attended by the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma, Ukraine&#x27;s Prime Minister Anatoliy Kinakh, other politicians, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s former players Andriy Shevchenko, Oleh Blokhin, Igor Belanov, Oleksandr Zavarov, Serhiy Rebrov etc. In general, from 60.000 to 150.000 people attended the funeral.

Lobanovskyi was buried at Baikove Cemetery. The tombstone is adorned with a colonnade with the inscription in Russian &quot;We are alive as long as we are remembered&quot; (in original: &quot;Мы живы до тех пор, пока нас помнят&quot;).

==Management style and influence==

Along with Rinus Michels, Lobanovskyi is recognized for being the inventor of the major football playing style known as &quot;Total Football&quot; in the 1970s. Lobanovskyi often referred to &quot;Total Football&quot; as &quot;gold vein&quot; that would be exploited for many years to come. According to Lobanovskyi, the &quot;revolutionary process&quot; in football ended in 1974 with the discovery of &quot;Total Football&quot;, and in modern football, all players must be able to play in offense and defense equally effectively. Per Lobanovskyi, &quot;Now we are talking about the so-called &#x27;smart&#x27; universalization. What do I mean? Well, for example, we would not want Andriy Shevchenko, the striker, to play the right defender. But if he gets into this zone, he must be able to perform there. And in the future, football will gradually move from &#x27;smart&#x27; universalization to full universalization&quot;.

Lobanovskyi viewed football game as a system of 22 elements, divided into two sub-systems consisted of 11 elements – if the two sub-systems are equal, the game ends in a draw. The nuance that Lobanovsky considered the most interesting and important was that the efficiency of the subsystem will always be higher than the sum of the efficiencies of its individual elements. Lobanovskyi insisted that the training process should be modeled, and fragments of future actions on the field should be practiced. According to Lobanovskyi, team coordination was an outdated concept – each player goes out and does what is needed at this time, and how he does this depends on his skill, training, and ability to express himself. But the structure of the game, tactics should not suffer from who acts as a performer in that particular moment.

Lobanovskyi is credited for bringing a scientific and analytical approach and strong emphasis on physical fitness and diet to the game. Many observers recognized Lobanovskyi as the first person to bring science into football, at the time when most managers used basic attributes in their training process. The media often referred to Lobanovskyi as &quot;ahead of his time&quot;. With the cooperation with Anatoly Zelentsov, a scientist from the department of physical education theory of Kyiv State Institute of Physical Education, Lobanovskyi brought an accurate system of calculation of the training process and mathematical modeling of physical load for players. Zelentsov, viewed by many as unmistakably meticulous in his analysis, insisted that the team would not lose the match if, during the game, the number of key moments, during which the team made mistakes, would not exceed 18%. Many observers, players and managers credited Lobanovskyi&#x27;s teams for being in great physical condition and being able to fulfill tactical ideas and perform certain operations almost on the level of automatism. Many observers described football played by Lobanovskyi&#x27;s teams as &quot;football from the future&quot;.

A lot of people that worked alongside Lobanovskyi described him as a great psychologist. &quot;A coach should always remember that he works with people, people that largely make the coach what he is now. And people, unlike robots, have a soul that is quite often very vulnerable, and sometimes obstinate&quot;, Lobanovskyi once said in an interview, &quot;It&#x27;s really important to know each player&#x27;s personality and character. You can be more strict with one player and less strict with another, but for that you need to know their character. You must know which buttons to press to have each player bring as much benefit as possible&quot;. Stefan Reshko, who played for Dynamo Kyiv in the 70s, said: &quot;Lobanovskyi was a top-notch psychologist. He had the ability to get the absolute best out of the players he worked with. Anatoliy Demyanenko, trained by Lobanovskyi during the 80s, described him as &quot;a great psychologist. He knew how to communicate with each player. He knew when and to whom he needs to raise his voice, or not to say anything&quot;. Vasyl Kardash, who worked with Lobanovskyi during the late 90s and early 00s, said: &quot;Lobanovskyi was a very good psychologist. His understanding of the psychology of a certain player – not just as a footballer, but as a human being – [is one of the things that] made him one of the great ones&quot;. Andriy Shevchenko often referred to Lobanovskyi as &quot;paternal figure&quot; in his life, claiming that Lobanovskiy &quot;handed him the key&quot; to a successful life: &quot;Lobanovskyi rarely raised his voice. He never yelled at us, nor he ever tried to &#x27;sort things out&#x27; with anyone. He was respected and admired by everyone around him&quot;. Renowned Indian manager Armando Colaco is highly influenced by Lobanovskyi and his style of coaching in Dynamo Kiev.

Many observers, players and managers credited Lobanovskyi for being able to always improve as a manager. One of the famous Lobanovskyi quotes was, &quot;A coach must learn all his life. If hardened, stopped learning - that means, stopped being a coach&quot;. His ability to &quot;stay in touch&quot; with modern trends has been described as one of the reasons why he was able to build three great football teams in a span of three different decades – the 70s, 80s and 90s.

==Tactics==

Lobanovskyi placed emphasis on the collective or &quot;the system&quot;. He said &quot;A system does not guarantee success, but it gives a much better chance of success than making it up as you go along.&quot; Everything was meticulously planned, with the team&#x27;s preparation divided into three levels. Players were to have individual technical coaching so as to equip them better to fulfil the tasks Lobanovskyi set them during a game; specific tactics and tasks for each player were drawn up according to the opponents; and a strategy was devised for a competition as a whole, placing each game in context by acknowledging that it is impossible for a side to maintain maximal levels over a protracted period. Lobanovskyi and Zelentsov wrote in their book, The Methodological Basis of the Development of Training Models, &quot;the first thing we have in mind is to strive for new courses of action that will not allow the opponent to adapt to our style of play. If an opponent has adjusted himself to our style of play and found a counter-play, then we need to find a new strategy. That is the dialectic of the game. You have to go forward in such a way and with such a range of attacking options that it will force the opponent to make a mistake. In other words, it&#x27;s necessary to force the opponent into the condition you want them to be in. One of the most important means of doing that is to vary the size of the playing area.&quot; One thing remained central: keep the preferred playing area as large as possible while in possession, and as small as possible while the opponent had the ball.

In Methodological Basis, Lobanovskyi and Zelentsov give as an example of their preparation for a specific game the European Cup semi-final against Bayern Munich in 1977. ‘The play,’ they wrote, ‘was constructed on attacking actions, with the obligatory neutralisation of the opponent&#x27;s players, the intention being to deprive him playing space and to defend against the attacks from wide at which Bayern were so strong. The objective was a draw, but we ended up losing 1–0. In the match in Kyiv, we chose a playing model based on squeezing the play and fighting for the ball in our opponents’ half of the pitch, trying to create a numerical advantage in various areas. Eventually we won 2–0.’
Lobanovskyi&#x27;s preferable formation was the 4–1–3–2. All his teams utilized the talents of two strikers, in 1975 Oleh Blokhin and Volodymyr Onyshchenko, in 1986 Blokhin or Oleh Protasov and Ihor Belanov, and in 1999 Andriy Shevchenko and Serhiy Rebrov. Lobanovskyi&#x27;s forwards were highly versatile, being equally capable of shifting to the flanks, organizing attacks as playmakers, joining midfield in defensive formations and even dropping back to help the full-backs during spells of opponent pressure. This versatility of the forwards was key in disorganizing opponents&#x27; defenses and creating space for players attacking from the back.

Pressing was always a key element of Lobanovskyi&#x27;s teams. The main goal of pressing was to create situations of numerical superiority for Dynamo players where the ball was, and deny opponents both space and time for the right decisions, thus forcing them to always play the game at Dynamo&#x27;s pace. The trademark Dynamo counter-attacks would start with a player dispossessing his opponent in midfield, then immediately playing a quick long ball either to the forwards or the advancing full-backs, so as to catch the opposition unorganized. Lobanovskyi always stressed the importance of the first seconds of an attack after winning the ball, as it is in these seconds that the opposition is less ready to defend in an organized manner. Pressing was a collective effort, and whenever a player moved up the pitch, a teammate covered his position. In this way Dynamo minimized the threat of having to face a counter-attack by the opponent in case the ball was lost.

Lobanovskyi put meticulous attention to set-pieces both in attack and in defense. In defense, Dynamo often used tactical fouling to prevent opponents from getting quality shots on goal, frequently conceding fouls just at the top of the penalty area. The logic behind this was that free kicks were much easier for the goalkeeper to defend that shots in open play. In addition, they also used tactical fouling to prevent counter attacks: by fouling around the halfway line Dynamo&#x27;s midfield could get behind the ball to defend. In attack, Lobanovskyi&#x27;s teams also were intelligent in their use of playing short from free kicks. During the 1990s, most teams would habitually play the ball long after a foul, using the opportunity to progress up the field as quick as possible. Dynamo recognized that opponents would prepare for this and retreat accordingly. Therefore when they played short, there was no pressure applied to the player with the ball for a long duration, allowing for runs to develop. Dynamo&#x27;s first two goals in the 3–0 victory against Barcelona in 1997 came from such situations. The high degree of responsiveness and fast reaction speeds were traits to marvel at of Lobanovskyi&#x27;s side, as they frequently looked to increase the tempo and take advantage of teams that used these moments in the game to slow down the match. When Dynamo had won a throw next to the opponents&#x27; area, the tallest midfielder (Andriy Husin) would usually stand just inside the area to receive the ball from the throw and make a header-pass to one of the strikers to create a chance. In this way Dynamo scored the 2–0 against Bayern Munich in 2000, when Ramiz Mamedov launched a throw straight into Husin&#x27;s head, Husin flicked on a header-pass to Giorgi Demetradze in the penalty spot, who scored with an overhead kick.

Dynamo&#x27;s shape in the late 1990s was a front two of Rebrov and Shevchenko but as an offensive principle they always attacked three lanes: right, left and center. It didn&#x27;t matter what the shape was or who it was, there were always three players attacking the three lanes. This was split into two methods, the first being a player attacking one of the wide lanes as one of Rebrov or Shevchenko was central. That player was mostly Belkevich who not only operated behind the striker duo but also attacked the wide areas regularly. The second method was Rebrov and Shevchenko splitting, therefore allowing a runner in between.

In the &quot;stretched diamond&quot; formation, which differs from a typical diamond in that one player operates in a much wider position than the others, Lobanovskyi was able to fully make use of the talents of versatile midfielder Vitaliy Kosovskyi, who was effectively both a left midfielder in the &quot;standard&quot; 4–1–3–2 and a left winger next to Shevchenko and Rebrov when attacks unfolded, practically making the formation a 4–3–3. When defending, Kosovskyi&#x27;s speed made him useful also as a left back, enabling the actual left back Kakha Kaladze to drop inside as a third central defender, converting the formation into a 5–3–2. In the absence of Kosovskyi due to injury during the second half of the 1999–2000 season, Lobanovskyi used Giorgi Demetradze as a wide striker. Against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, Demetradze was instructed to exploit the space in Madrid&#x27;s defense left open by full-back Roberto Carlos&#x27; forward runs. In this game, Demetradze won a penalty (that Rebrov missed), won the corner for Dynamo&#x27;s equalizer, and finally crossed for Dynamo&#x27;s second goal that made it 1–2.

Dynamo&#x27;s defending was usually organized as a mixed zonal-and-man-marking system; players would usually defend zonally yet the opposition&#x27;s best player was in most cases man-marked by a Dynamo player who tracked him back whenever he went. Perhaps the most significant application of the tracking back was against Real Madrid in the 1999 Champions League quarter-finals at the Santiago Bernabeu. Alyaksandr Khatskevich&#x27;s role was to defend the right channel and center area as Predrag Mijatović drifted inside to overload the center. He also had Oleksiy Mykhaylychenko man-mark Holland&#x27;s Ruud Gullit in the Euro 1988 final.

Lobanovskyi was tactically versatile and would make risky changes during matches to alter the course of the game. In December 1998, Dynamo was playing away at RC Lens needing a draw to qualify as first from their Champions League group. Lobanovskyi chose a defensive-minded deployment, with Rebrov posted on the left wing and the midfield consisting of defense-oriented players, being effectively a 4–5–1 with Shevchenko as the lone striker. However, after Lens captain Frédéric Déhu was sent off for a hard challenge on Shevchenko with the score at 0–0, Lobanovskyi quickly made two offensive-minded changes, bringing in Vitaliy Kosovskyi for defender Yuriy Dmytrulin and Valentin Belkevich for Vasyl Kardash and pairing Rebrov with Shevchenko up front, thus changing the system into a 3–2–3–2. Dynamo won the game 3–1, also winning the group to advance to the quarter-finals.

He insisted that a player should be able to play in more than one position. He converted Aleksei Gerasimenko, originally a striker who had scored 46 goals in 71 games with FC Kuban Krasnodar, into a right midfielder, a right full-back, and even into a sweeper. Likewise, central defender Oleksandr Holovko was also good when he joined midfield, and Kakha Kaladze was equally adept as left back, defensive midfielder and centre back.

Lobanovskyi&#x27;s emphasis on the system rather than the individuals meant that his teams continued to perform well even when their best players were lost to transfers, injuries or bookings. In the 1997–98 season Dynamo&#x27;s two most important midfielders were Yuriy Kalitvintsev and Yuriy Maksymov, who left the team in the end of the year. Lobanovskyi had already found their replacements in Alyaksandr Khatskevich and Valentin Belkevich, and the team made an even more spectacular run next season. In the second half of the 1999–2000 season the team was plagued with injuries in key players Vladyslav Vashchuk, Yuriy Dmytrulin and Vitaliy Kosovskyi, and was forced to play important Champions League games against Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Rosenborg BK with a defensive line consisting of youngsters Andriy Nesmachniy and Serhiy Fedorov and with Gerasimenko playing as a sweeper, way out of his natural position. Despite all this, Dynamo were able to collect 10 points in these 4 matches, beating Rosenborg twice, Bayern once and drawing 2–2 with Real at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.

==Remembrance==
Following his death Lobanovskyi was awarded the Hero of Ukraine order, the nation&#x27;s highest honour, as well as the UEFA Order of Merit in Ruby. Dynamo Kyiv&#x27;s stadium was also renamed the Lobanovsky Stadium in his honour. In 2003, Lobanovskyi was awarded FIFA Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded by FIFA.

On 11 May 2003, before the first anniversary of the death of Lobanovskyi, a monument was opened near the Lobanovsky Dynamo Stadium.

After his death, A.C. Milan won the Champions League in 2003 with Andriy Shevchenko in the team. After the victory Shevchenko flew to Kyiv to put his medal by the grave of his former manager.

In 2003, the Valeriy Lobanovskyi Memorial Tournament was founded.

==Personal life==
Lobanovskyi was born in Kyiv to Vasyl Mykhailovych Lobko-Lobanovsky and Oleksandra Maksymivna Boichenko. Lobanovskyi&#x27;s daughter Svitlana Lobanovska told Newspaper in Ukrainian that Vasyl Lobko-Lobanovsky had a double surname but double surnames were not welcome in the USSR, therefore his both sons, Valeriy and Yevhen, decided to use single surname Lobanovsky.

Lobanovskyi was married to Ada Lobanovska, the couple had a daughter named Svitlana. She is a philologist of the Russian language and owns a restaurant in Kyiv called &quot;U metrá&quot; (&quot;At The Metr&quot;; &quot;Metr&quot; (ukr. &quot;Метр&quot;) was one of Lobanovskyi&#x27;s many nicknames).

<text>Moisés Naím (born July 5, 1952) is a Venezuelan journalist and writer. He is a Distinguished Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Naím served as the editor-in-chief of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine for 14 years (1996-2010). Since 2012, he has directed and hosted &quot;Efecto Naím&quot;, a weekly televised news program on the economy and international affairs that airs throughout the Americas on NTN24. In 2011, he received the Ortega y Gasset Award for his important contribution to journalism in the Spanish language.

He is the former Minister of Trade and Industry for Venezuela, director of its central bank, and executive director of the World Bank. Naím is also the founder and chairman of the Group of Fifty and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Inter-American Dialogue, and the World Economic Forum.

==Education==
Moisés Naím studied at the Universidad Metropolitana in Caracas, Venezuela. Following his undergraduate studies, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he obtained both a Master of Science and doctorate degrees in the late 1970s. His dissertation was titled, &quot;The Political Economy of Regulating Multinational Corporations&quot;.

==Public service==
Naím was a professor of business strategy and industrial economics at Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administración (IESA), Venezuela&#x27;s leading business school and research center located in Caracas. He also served as its Dean between 1979 and 1986.

From 1989 to 1990, Naím served as Venezuela&#x27;s Minister of Trade and Industry, in Carlos Andrés Pérez&#x27;s second cabinet. Naím wrote about his experience in his 1993 book, &quot;Paper Tigers and Minotaurs&quot; and spoke about it in an interview with journalist Mirtha Rivero.

==Journalism career==
Moisés Naím is the chief international columnist for &quot;El País&quot;, the most widely read newspaper in Spain. His column, &quot;The Global Observer&quot;, is also published in Italy (&quot;La Repubblica&quot;), France (&quot;Slate.fr&quot;), and in the major newspapers of Latin America. For several years, he served as a contributing editor to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

Among other publications, Naím&#x27;s work has appeared in: &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;Berliner Zeitung&quot;, and many more, making him one of today&#x27;s most widely read columnists on international economics and geopolitics.

In 1996, Naím became the editor-in-chief of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine. While Naím worked there, Foreign Policy won the National Magazine Awards for General Excellence three times and it changed from being an academic quarterly to a bimonthly glossy. In 2008 the magazine was sold to The Washington Post Company. Naím remained editor-in-chief until 2010.

==Published books==
Naím is the author or editor of more than fifteen books on topics related to geopolitics, international economics, and economic development.

Naím&#x27;s newest book &quot;The Revenge of Power: How Autocrats Are Reinventing Politics for the 21st Century&quot; was published in February 2022. 

Naím&#x27;s book &quot;Dos Espías en Caracas&quot; (&quot;Two Spies in Caracas&quot;) was published in Spanish in late 2018 and in English in the summer of 2021. It is a novel of espionage intertwined with a love story. 

In 2013, he published &quot;The End of Power: From Boardrooms to Battlefields and Churches to States, Why Being in Charge Isn&#x27;t What It Used To Be&quot; (2013). In it he argues that power has become &quot;easier to get, harder to use, and easier to lose&quot; due to the demographic explosion, increase in geographic mobility, and a shift in cultural norms. Both the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and the &quot;Washington Post&quot; named it one of the best books of 2013, and was widely reviewed. In 2015, it was selected by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg as the inaugural book for the Mark Zuckerberg book club, a public resolution to read one new book every two weeks in 2015.

In 2005, his book &quot;Illicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers, and Copycats are Hijacking the Global Economy&quot; was selected by the Washington Post as one of the best non-fiction books of the year; it was published in 14 languages and is the basis of a documentary produced by National Geographic Film and Television in 2010.

<text>USS &quot;Reid&quot; (DD–21) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first ship named for Samuel Chester Reid.

==Construction==
&quot;Reid&quot; was laid down by the Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, on 3 August 1908, launched on 17 August 1909, sponsored by Miss Lina Andrews, and commissioned on 3 December 1909.

==Pre-World War I==
Assigned to the Atlantic Torpedo Flotilla, an organization redesignated many times in the years which followed, &quot;Reid&quot; operated along the east coast - primarily engaged in training exercises and drills - until the United States entered World War I.

==World War I==
On 6 April 1917, &quot;Reid&quot; was attached to the Southern Patrol Force, operating out of Key West, Florida. On the 14th, she moved north and on the 18th joined Squadron 1, Patrol Force at Boston, Massachusetts. Transferred to Squadron 2 in early May, she patrolled the northeast coast of the United States until detached from the Patrol Force on 15 May and assigned to the Destroyer Force. Reporting on the 17th, she escorted coastal traffic and patrolled the approaches to New York City until ordered to Charleston, South Carolina, to prepare for distant service on 5 July.

&quot;Reid&quot; sailed east on 21 July, and from 1 August-30 September provided escort and patrol services in the vicinity of the Azores. Detached in October, she proceeded to Brest, whence she resumed her patrol and escort mission. On the 23rd, she was rammed and damaged above the waterline by . Repairs were completed quickly at Brest, and she continued her work without further interruption until the end of the war. During that period, she made several attacks on submarines, most notably against &quot;UB-55&quot; on 18 March 1918 and &quot;U-86&quot; on 1 July, but she failed to sink any.

==Inter-war period==
Relieved after the Armistice, &quot;Reid&quot; departed Brest for Charleston and inactivation on 11 December. Arriving on the 31st, she later shifted to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she was decommissioned on 31 July 1919. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September and was sold to T. A. Scott &amp; Company, New London, Connecticut, on 21 November.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==
* Ensign Charles Alan Pownall (1914-Unknown) (Later Rear admiral and 3rd Military Governor of Guam)

<text>&quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; is the twenty-second and final episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. In the episode, a massive heatwave causes the residents of Springfield to install large air conditioning devices in their homes. This leads the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant to overload, causing two town-wide blackouts to occur. The Springfield Police Department are unable to face the riots that follow, prompting Homer, dissatisfied with the police&#x27;s incompetence, to start his own security company, called SpringShield.

&quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; was directed by Pete Michels and written by Dana Gould, who also pitched the idea for the episode. It features American actor Joe Mantegna as recurring character Fat Tony, and includes references to &quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;High Noon&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 5.3 million viewers, finishing in 53rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release on August 24, 2010, the episode received mixed reviews from critics.

The episode was dedicated to the memory of Stephen Jay Gould who died two days before it aired. He had voiced himself in the ninth-season episode &quot;Lisa the Skeptic&quot;.

==Plot==
Springfield is in the midst of a massive heat wave. Every building in the town has installed a large air conditioning device. However, this draws a lot of power from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Despite the safety measures Mr. Burns has taken (cutting power to the orphanage), the plant is at full power. At home, without an air conditioning device, the Simpsons have to follow an old-fashioned fan. Homer decides to give them a taste of winter by plugging in his dancing Santa Claus. This overloads the plant and causes a town-wide blackout. After Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store with no active alarm and decide to loot it, widespread rioting and looting occur. The police try to intervene, but are powerless to stop the massive crime wave.

The next day, Springfield has been devastated by the crime wave. Mayor Quimby decides to take legal action by forming a blue-ribbon committee. At the Simpsons&#x27; house, someone steals Lisa&#x27;s Malibu Stacy collection. Homer decides to take action by looking for it. He finds the culprit, Jimbo Jones, and later foils a robbery by Snake Jailbird at the Kwik-E-Mart. He goes through a very long list of his previous jobs (during which Marge puts curlers in her hair off-screen) and decides that he likes the idea of combining his love of helping &quot;and&quot; hurting people. Homer forms his own security company called &quot;SpringShield&quot;. Although it only has Homer, Lenny, and Carl, it is more efficient and more successful than the Springfield Police Department. When Quimby sees Chief Wiggum trying to shoot a Piñata with a shotgun while blindfolded, in a fit of rage he dismisses Wiggum and makes Homer the chief of police on live television.

After stopping one of Fat Tony&#x27;s operations, Homer practically rids Springfield of crime. However, Fat Tony escapes and vows to kill Homer unless he leaves town. Homer is unable to get protection from the citizens he protects (only Ned Flanders volunteers, but Homer ignores his offer) and Lenny and Carl lock themselves in a jail cell. When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives with a few of his own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle—Christopher Moltisanti, Paulie Gualtieri, and Silvio Dante from &quot;The Sopranos&quot; series.

Just before they are about to kill Homer, an unseen sniper shoots the mobsters; injuring them and causing them to flee. Safe again, Homer resigns as police chief and offers the job to the first person who comes along, which is Wiggum (who notes that an identical situation is how he became chief in the first place). When Marge thanks him for saving Homer, Wiggum says that he did not shoot anyone, having lost his gun, badge and nearly his squad car. Unbeknownst to them, the person who saved Homer was Maggie, who fires at the mobsters from her window with a scoped sporting rifle.

==Production==
&quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; was written by Dana Gould and directed by Pete Michels. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. The idea for the episode was also pitched by Gould, who had just moved to southern California with his wife. After moving in, the two decided to install an alarm system because, Gould quipped, &quot;the police aren&#x27;t enough. Too many people wanna kill you.&quot; When meeting the other writers, Gould pitched an episode in which Homer becomes the owner of a security company, which then became &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge.&quot; Although current showrunner Al Jean found it &quot;very funny,&quot; the episode&#x27;s first draft was heavily altered after the first table-read, a process in which the script is read out loud to the other writers.

During the blackout, Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store, causing a riot to erupt. The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was &quot;somewhat obsessed&quot; with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said &quot;I love the idea of, &#x27;All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels.&quot; While trying to determine who stole Lisa&#x27;s Malibu Stacy car, Homer holds Bart as his prime suspect. Unbeknownst to Bart, who is eating an apple, Homer tells Lisa &quot;Look at him over there, eating that apple. What is he planning?&quot; Originally, the scene would show Homer suspecting Lisa, but because it bothered the character&#x27;s voice actor, Yeardley Smith, the scene was changed. American actor Joe Mantegna reprises his role as Fat Tony in the episode.

In another scene in the episode, Homer shows his family an advertisement for his security company. In it, a monster is seen breaking into an elderly woman&#x27;s house. When the woman screams, the screen freezes and Homer is composited to the screen, instructing the audience about SpringShield&#x27;s telephone number. In order to composite Homer into the screen, director Michels made use of a greenscreen. The advertisement resumes and the monster is subdued by Homer, Lenny and Carl. Confused, the monster turns to Homer and asks, &quot;friend?&quot; to which Homer replies &quot;the only friend you need is SpringShield,&quot; and holds a business card in front of the camera. The monster then puts the card in his wallet and says &quot;monster put in wallet.&quot; The monster&#x27;s last line was written during one of the episode&#x27;s rewrites, but none of the writers on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; writing staff has taken credit for it. The line has since become very popular with the series&#x27; writing staff; Jean said that it was &quot;very funny and unusual for a television show,&quot; and Gould considers it to be his favourite joke in any episode he has ever written.

At the end of the episode, Maggie saves Homer by shooting Fat Tony&#x27;s gang members with a rifle, as a reference to the two-part episode Who Shot Mr. Burns? from seasons 6 and 7, in which it is ultimately revealed that Maggie shot Burns after his gun fell into her hands. The scene was conceived by series co-creator and executive producer James L. Brooks while writing notes during the episode&#x27;s first table-read.

While &quot;The Frying Game&quot; was originally thought to be the last episode of the season, &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; was later revealed to be the real season finale. Although new episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; usually air on Sundays, &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; aired on Wednesday, May 22, 2002. On August 24, 2010, &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; was released as part of &quot;The Simpsons: The Complete Thirteenth Season&quot; DVD and Blu-ray set. Al Jean, Matt Selman, Carolyn Omine, Dana Gould, Joe Mantegna and Pete Michels participated in the audio commentary of the episode.

==Cultural references==
In a scene in the episode, Homer tells Marge about all the jobs he has had, referencing several episodes of the series. According to Jean, the scene was added during a rewrite of the episode&#x27;s script. In another scene, Homer, in the Springfield church, attempts to recruit companions for his security company. The scene is a reference to the 1952 American western film &quot;High Noon&quot;, although the line &quot;You all know me&quot; was taken from the American horror/thriller film &quot;Jaws&quot;. When visiting the clothing store Wooly Bully, Homer has a rapid, monotone conversation with the cashier. The two speak in a similar manner to the characters in the American 1950s television crime drama &quot;Dragnet&quot;, of which Gould was a &quot;big fan&quot;.

When noticing that one of his ferrets is wearing a wire, Fat Tony tells it &quot;you&#x27;re not a pet, and you&#x27;re not a friend. You&#x27;re nothing to me.&quot; The line parodies a similar conversation between Michael and Fredo Corleone in the American gangster film &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;. Near the end of the episode, Fat Tony drives to the Simpsons house in what seems to be a white Dodge Caravan, while shots of Springfield are shown on the way. The scene parodies the title sequence of the American television drama series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and features Alabama 3&#x27;s song &quot;Woke Up This Morning,&quot; which is also used in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;&#x27; title sequence. Michels stated that the parody was &quot;very fun&quot; to animate; &quot;Being from New Jersey, it was a labor of love,&quot; he said in the episode&#x27;s DVD commentary.

The episode title is a reference to the James Brown song &quot;Papa&#x27;s Got A Brand New Bag&quot;. 
The monster of SpringShield commercial is a parody of &quot;The New Woody Woodpecker Show&quot; Badger character, including a quote &quot;Hey buddy&quot;.

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; received a 5.0 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 5.3 million viewers. The episode finished in 53rd place in the ratings for the week of May 20–26, 2002. Together with the first half-hour of &quot;Celebrity Boxing&quot;, the shows averaged a 3.9 rating among adults between ages 18 and 49, pushing Fox to number two for the night, just behind NBC. Some listings do not name this show as the Season 13 finale because it aired outside of the series&#x27; regular Sunday 8PM EST timeslot; those listings name this episode as a &quot;special airing&quot; and list The Frying Game as the S13 finale instead.

Following its home video release, &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; received mixed reviews from critics.

Writing for 411Mania, Ron Martin gave the episode a mixed review, calling it &quot;passable.&quot; He wrote that &quot;Poppa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Badge&quot; is &quot;far from memorable as season finales should be.&quot;

DVD Movie Guide&#x27;s Colin Jacobson wrote &quot;Like many S13 episodes, “Badge” feels more than a little derivative,&quot; describing the episode as a combination of the season 4 episode &quot;Mr. Plow&quot; and the season 5 episode &quot;Homer the Vigilante&quot;. He continued by writing &quot;That doesn’t mean the show lacks amusement, but it’s too rehashed to end the year with a real winner.&quot;

Nate Boss of Project-Blu described it as &quot;A random episode, without many laughs,&quot; however, he added that it &quot;could have been worse.&quot;

Giving the episode a positive review, Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave it a B+, billing &quot;Homer&#x27;s &#x27;You know I&#x27;ve had a lot of jobs&#x27; list&quot; as the episode&#x27;s &quot;highlight&quot;.

Writing for Screen Jabber, Stuart O&#x27;Connor was favorable as well, describing it as a &quot;first-rate ep[isode]&quot;. Screen Rant called it the best episode of the 13th season.

<doc id="1274916" wikidata="Q2877427" url="?curid=1274916" title="Johnny Canuck">
<text>Johnny Canuck is a Canadian cartoon hero and superhero who was created as a political cartoon in 1869 and was later re-invented as a Second World War action hero in 1942. The Vancouver Canucks, a professional ice hockey team in the National Hockey League (NHL), currently use a hockey playing &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot; logo as one of their team logos. In addition, the Vancouver Canucks&#x27; American Hockey League affiliate, the Abbotsford Canucks, use it as their main logo.

==Political cartoon==
Johnny Canuck is a fictional lumberjack and a national personification of Canada. He first appeared in early political cartoons dating to 1869 where he was portrayed as a younger cousin of the United States&#x27; Uncle Sam and Britain&#x27;s John Bull. Dressed as a habitant, farmer, logger, rancher or soldier, he was characterized as wholesome and simple-minded and was often depicted resisting the bullying of John Bull or Uncle Sam. He appeared regularly in editorial cartoons for 30 years before declining in usage in the early twentieth century.

==Comic book hero==
The character re-emerged during World War II in the February 1942 issue of Bell Features&#x27; &quot;Dime Comics&quot; #1. Cartoonist Leo Bachle created the character as a teenager, apparently on a challenge from a Bell executive. Initially, Johnny Canuck had no superpowers. Johnny Canuck&#x27;s cartoon exploits helped Canada fight against Nazism. Like Captain America, he met Adolf Hitler and almost single-handedly ended the war.

The use of such stock figures diminished in popularity after World War II, but in 1975, a new comic book character, Captain Canuck, emerged. Created by Richard Comely (who at the time was unaware of the earlier Johnny Canuck character), Captain Canuck was a costumed superhero rather than just a hero, and he wore red and white tights and bore a red maple leaf emblazoned on the forehead of his mask.

In 1995, Canada Post issued a series of Canadian postage stamps celebrating Canada&#x27;s comic-book superheroes. Johnny Canuck is depicted as he appeared in the comic books, dressed in flight jacket, goggles, leather headgear and boots. Johnny Canuck is linked to a tradition of stalwart, honest, upstanding Canadian heroes.

Ty Templeton and Moonstone Books resurrected the character in a comic originally called &quot;Johnny Canuck and the Guardians of the Northern Lights&quot; and then re-titled &quot;The Northern Guard&quot;, which published two issues in December 2010 and March 2011.
==Vancouver Canucks==

In the mid-20th century, the Vancouver Canucks, a major professional ice hockey team of the Pacific Coast Hockey League and later Western Hockey League, used a lumberjack character inspired by a Dawson Creek BC senior hockey teams logo. When the Canucks moved to the National Hockey League in 1970, they discontinued the lumberjack logo, in favour of the &quot;Stick-in-Rink&quot; logo.

In the mid-1990s, Harold Berndt, the former director of marketing and assistant general manager for the major junior Western Hockey League&#x27;s New Westminster Bruins, visited the BC Sports Hall of Fame. He obtained a photo of the vintage 1950s logo, originally inspired by a Dawson Creek BC team, and by the 1960s had begun to be referred to by fans as &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot;. He created the first major redesign and a campaign for &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot; to become the Vancouver Canucks&#x27; new logo, Berndt released his logo redesign to the internet by December 1996 advocating that &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot; would make the best new logo for the Vancouver Canucks.

In October 1999, Kevin Sander applied for a &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot; logo as a trademark and subsequently sold a similar modified version to the Canucks.

In 2006, a vintage-inspired goaltender mask worn by Canucks&#x27; goaltender Roberto Luongo featured the older style &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot; logo. The following season, Luongo&#x27;s new mask once again featured a &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot;, but more prominently than his previous design. Beginning in 2008–09, the Canucks introduced &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot; on the shoulder patch of their third jersey. The full body Johnny Canuck logo was then recreated by graphic designer Evan Biswanger in 2009.

In 2021, &quot;Johnny Canuck&quot; logo became the logo for new AHL farm team, the Abbotsford Canucks, in Abbotsford, British Columbia.

In October 2022, the Canucks revealed their reverse retro jersey which featured Johnny Canuck as the logo.

==Stage play by Ken Gass==
In 1974, Toronto&#x27;s Factory Theatre staged a play based on the Johnny Canuck character, written by Ken Gass and entitled &quot;Hurray for Johnny Canuck&quot;.

<doc id="1274917" wikidata="Q7411104" url="?curid=1274917" title="Samuel Chester Reid">
<text>Samuel Chester Reid (24 August 1783 – 28 January 1861) was an officer in the United States Navy who commanded a privateer during the War of 1812. He is also noted for having helped design the 1818 version of the flag of the United States, which first established the rule of keeping thirteen stripes and adding one star for each U.S. state.

== Early life and family ==
Reid was born in Norwich, Connecticut, to John and Rebecca (Chester) Reid. John Reid, a lieutenant in the British Navy, was captured during the American Revolutionary War before resigning and joining the American side. Rebecca Chester&#x27;s father, John Chester, was among the soldiers at Bunker Hill, and afterward a member of the Connecticut convention that ratified the United States constitution.

== Naval career ==
Reid joined the United States Navy in 1794. He served in &quot;Constellation&quot; with Commodore Thomas Truxtun and in 1803 became master of the brig &quot;Merchant&quot;. During the War of 1812 he commanded the privateer &quot;General Armstrong&quot;. One notable capture was that of the British merchantman , notable because of the legal cases that arose from her capture and recapture. At the Battle of Fayal Reid inflicted severe casualties on boats from a British Royal Navy squadron en route to Jamaica and Louisiana. During the battle, Reid had to scuttle his ship and he and his crew made it to shore, suffering 2 men killed and 7 men wounded. Andrew Jackson credited Reid&#x27;s action with delaying the British squadron and so aiding General Jackson&#x27;s defense of New Orleans, a theory dismissed by modern historians. The battle was the subject of many popular prints.

== Flag design ==
In January 1817, Reid was asked by Representative Peter H. Wendover for advice in the design of a new U.S. flag. The flag then in use had fifteen stars and fifteen stripes; it had not been updated to reflect the five new states which had joined the union since that version of the flag was implemented in 1795. Wendover was the head of a congressional committee tasked with investigating possible alterations to the flag. Together, Wendover and Reid decided that the best way to honor all twenty states was to restore the number of stripes to the original thirteen, have twenty stars on the canton, and add a new star each time a new state joined the union.

Reid sketched three flag designs, one for general use which featured the twenty stars arranged in the shape of a larger star, one for use on government vessels and buildings which featured an eagle on the canton instead of stars, and one for use on ceremonial occasions which featured a different element (stars, stripes, the Great Seal, and the Goddess of Liberty) on each of the flag&#x27;s four quarters. Wendover and his congressional committee adopted Reid&#x27;s general-use flag, but never seriously considered his other two designs. Wendover drafted a bill which stipulated that the thirteen-stripe, twenty-star design become the new official flag of the United States. The bill passed and was signed into law as the Flag Act of 1818 by President James Monroe on April 4, 1818. The pattern of the stars was later changed from Reid&#x27;s &quot;great star&quot; design to four rows of five stars each.

Reid was appointed master in the Navy in 1844 and died at New York 28 January 1861. He is interred at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Four ships were given the name USS &quot;Reid&quot; in his honor.

His daughter, Mary Isabel Reid, married in 1861 Italian-American officer Luigi Palma di Cesnola, who later received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the American Civil War (1863), served as the United States consul in Cyprus (1866–1877) and became the first director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (1879-1904). His son Samuel Graham Reid, Sr., published and edited the &quot;Montgomery Advertiser&quot;.

<doc id="1274922" wikidata="Q1077684" url="?curid=1274922" title="Seed saving">
<text>In agriculture and gardening, seed saving (sometimes known as brown bagging) is the practice of saving seeds or other reproductive material (e.g. tubers, scions, cuttings) from vegetables, grain, herbs, and flowers for use from year to year for annuals and nuts, tree fruits, and berries for perennials and trees. This is the traditional way farms and gardens were maintained for the last 12,000 years (see first agricultural revolution).

In recent decades, beginning in the latter part of the 20th century, there has been a major shift to purchasing seed annually from commercial seed suppliers. Most farmers regard seed saving as a risky practice. If farmers do not sanitize their seed, this can result in significant pest or disease damage when the saved seed is planted. Other reasons farmers generally do not save seed include inbreeding depression and certain plants not growing true to seed. Many commercial varieties exhibit high degrees of hybrid vigour, and will generally outperform any saved seed in a commercial context; as such vigour is the result of specific and careful genetic research and modification by humans, those desirable traits are almost always diminished in future generations. Additionally, many seeds are proprietary, making it illegal for buyers to save them after harvest for future planting. 

Nonetheless a significant number of farmers (especially small holders) continue to save some seed, whether out of habit, personal interest, or commercial interest. Much grassroots seed-saving activity today in the developed world is the work of home gardeners. Saving seeds protects biodiversity and saves money for consumer gardeners.

==Method==
To be successful at seed saving, new skills need to be developed to ensure that desired characteristics are retained in the landraces of the plant variety. Important considerations are the separation distance needed from plants of the same species to ensure that cross-pollination with another variety does not occur, and the minimum number of plants to be grown which will preserve inherent genetic diversity. It is also necessary to recognize the preferred characteristics of the cultivar being grown so that plants that are not breeding true are selected against, and to understand the breeding of improvements to the cultivar. Diseases that are seed-borne must be recognized so that they can be eliminated. Seed storage methods must be good enough to maintain viability of the seed. Germination requirements must be known so that periodic tests can be made.

Care must be taken, as training materials regarding seed production, cleaning, storage, and maintenance often focus on making landraces more uniform, distinct and stable (usually for commercial application) which can result in the loss of valuable adaptive traits unique to local varieties.

Additionally, there is a matter of localized nature to be considered.
In the upper northern hemisphere, and lower southern, one sees a seasonal change in terms of a cooler winter. Many plants go to seed and then go dormant. These seeds must hibernate until their respective spring season.

==Open pollination==
Open pollination is an important aspect of seed saving. Plants that reproduce through natural means tend to adapt to local conditions over time, and evolve as reliable performers, particularly in their localities, known as landraces or &quot;folk varieties.&quot;

==Legality==

While saving seed and even exchanging seed with other farmers for biodiversity purposes has been a traditional practice, these practices have become illegal for the plant varieties that are patented or otherwise owned by some entity (often a corporation). Under Article 28 of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement), &quot;planting, harvesting, saving, re-planting, and exchanging seeds of patented plants, or of plants containing patented cells and genes, constitutes use&quot; and can in some cases be prohibited by the intellectual property laws of WTO Members.

Significantly, farmers in developing countries are particularly affected by prohibitions on seed saving. There are some protections for re-use, called &quot;farmer&#x27;s privilege&quot;, in the 1991 International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention), but seed exchange remains prohibited.

In the United States, seeds were first patented in the 1970s through the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970. This was the beginning of a culture where people could control how the food system was created, altered and distributed to the public for consumption, and yields.

=== United States ===
Originally the farmer&#x27;s privilege to save seeds to grow subsequent crops was considered protected by the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970. American farmers, it was thought, could sell seed up to the amount saved for replanting their own acreage.

That view came to an end in the latter part of the 20th century and early part of the 21st century, with changes in technology and law. First, in 1981 &quot;Diamond v. Chakrabarty&quot; established that companies may obtain patents for life-forms—originally genetically engineered unicellular bacteria. In 2002 &quot;J.E.M. Ag Supply v. Pioneer&quot; established that valid utility patents could be issued on sexually reproduced plants, such as seed crops (e.g., corn). In 2013 &quot;Bowman v. Monsanto Co.&quot; established that it was patent infringement for farmers to save crop seeds (soybeans in that case) and grow subsequent crops from them, if the seeds or plants were patented. Seed corporations are able to earn massive profits from this control over commercial seed supplies, and consequently further loss of control has been taken from US farmers over their farm production process.

== Seed sovereignty ==
Seed sovereignty can be defined as the right &quot;to breed and exchange diverse open-sourced seeds.&quot; It focuses largely on the rights of individuals to be able to save seed, and be independent from major seed companies. Seed sovereignty activists point to seed saving as an important practice in building food security, as well as restoring agricultural biodiversity. Activists also draw attention to the cultural importance of seed saving practices, especially their role in maintaining traditional plant varieties. It is closely connected to the food sovereignty movement and food justice movement.

<doc id="1274932" wikidata="Q856574" url="?curid=1274932" title="Interlinguistics">
<text>Interlinguistics, also known as cosmoglottics, 
is the science of planned languages that has existed for more than a century. Formalised by Otto Jespersen in 1931 as the science of interlanguages, in more recent times, the field has been more focused with language planning, the collection of strategies to deliberately influence the structure and function of a living language. In this framework, interlanguages become a subset of planned languages, i.e. extreme cases of language planning.

Interlinguistics first appeared as a branch of studies devoted to the establishment of norms for auxiliary languages, but over its century-long history it has been understood by different authors more and more broadly as an interdisciplinary branch of science which includes various aspects of communication, language planning and standardization, multilingualism and globalisation, language policy, translation, sociolinguistics, intercultural communication, the history of language creation and literature written in constructed languages (international auxiliary languages (auxlangs) as well as constructed languages : conlangs), fictional artistic languages (artlangs), lingua francas, pidgins, creoles and constructed languages in the internet and other topics were added.

== Etymology and history ==

The hybrid term was first coined in French (as &quot;Interlinguistique&quot;) by the Belgian Esperantist Jules Meysmans.

The main historical periods of interlinguistics are:
* first, the pioneer era (1879–1911), when its basis was put forth; 
* secondly, the foundational era (1911–1951), when the interlinguistics wars took place to decide the most appropriate form of an auxiliary language; 
* thirdly, the school era (1951–1990), when independent Interlinguistics schools formed in different countries, mainly Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland, each with particular attention to Esperanto; 
* lastly, the current era of language policy (1990–today), during which interlinguistics is more tightly integrated with other disciplines, mainly linguistics and various social and political sciences, particularly via the topics of globalism, linguistic justice, management of multilingualism, and new forms of mobility.

At the Institute of Linguistics of AMU there is the extramural Interlinguistic studies program. Over the course of three years these studies provide the students with a basic knowledge of general linguistics, interlinguistics, international and intercultural communication with a focus on the linguistics, culture and movement of the internationally dispersed and naturally functioning planned language Esperanto. Every third year the Interlinguistic Studies program also organizes an international interlinguistic symposium.

At the University of Amsterdam there is also a chair of interlinguistics and Esperanto.

== Field of studies ==
The field of interlinguistics is concerned with international planned languages [also called &#x27;constructed languages&#x27;, &#x27;auxiliary languages&#x27;, or &#x27;artificial languages&#x27;] as Esperanto, and with the relationship between planned languages and language planning. Increasingly, undergraduate courses in planned languages are expanding to embrace not only the history of languages planned for international use, but also the field of imaginary and fictional languages. Interlinguistics is also concerned with investigating how ethnic and international planned languages work as lingua franca and with the possibilities of optimizing interlinguistic communication.

The term &quot;Interlinguistics&quot; can be interpreted in at least two ways:

# Study of &quot;interlinguae&quot;, i.e., of interlanguages that serve for interlinguistic communication - not to be confused with the interim languages of language learners, which also came to be called &quot;interlanguages&quot; by some authors.
# Study of phenomena that can be observed &quot;inter linguae&quot; &#x27;between languages&#x27;.
Among these interpretations, the first one is by far the most well established, while Mario Wandruszka had only the second one in mind.

The term appears first to have been used in French (&quot;interlinguistique&quot;) by Jules Meysmans in 1911 in a text concerning international auxiliary languages. It became more widely accepted subsequent to an address by the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen to the 2nd International Congress of Linguists in 1931. According to Jespersen, interlinguistics is &quot;that branch of the science of language which deals with the structure and basic ideas of all languages with the view to the establishing of a norm for interlanguages, &quot;i.e.&quot; auxiliary languages destined for oral and written use between people who cannot make themselves understood by means of their mother tongues&quot;. According to this definition, investigations that are useful for optimizing interlinguistic communication are central to the discipline, and the purpose may be to develop a new language intended for international use or for use within a multilingual country or union. Research of this kind has been undertaken by the International Delegation, which developed Ido (1907), and by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA), which developed Interlingua (1951).

Valter Tauli considered interlinguistics as a subdiscipline of language planning. The principles recommended by him for language planning applied to the guided development of national languages are also, and more liberally so, applicable to constructed interlanguages. It is noteworthy that these principles have close counterparts among Grice&#x27;s conversational maxims. These maxims describe how effective communication in conversation is achieved, and in order to function well, a language must be such that it allows respecting these maxims, which languages not always do.

Most publications in the field of interlinguistics are, however, not so constructive, but rather descriptive, comparative, historic, sociolinguistic, or concerned with translation by humans or machines. As for Esperanto, which is the most widely used constructed interlanguage, there is a relatively abundant literature about the language itself and its philology (see Esperantology).

Only a few of the many constructed languages have been applied practically to any noteworthy extent. The most prosperous were Volapük (1879, Johann Martin Schleyer), Esperanto (1887 Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof), Latino sine flexione (1903, Giuseppe Peano), Ido (1907, Louis Couturat), Occidental-Interlingue (1922, Edgar de Wahl) and Interlingua (1951, IALA and Alexander Gode), with Esperanto being the one gathering the most significant community of active speakers at present. Here, the Bliss symbols (1949, Charles K. Bliss) deserve also to be mentioned. These were intended for international communication, but have found their field of application elsewhere, namely as an aid for persons who lack an adequate ability of using ordinary language, because of motorical or cognitive handicaps.

== Kinds of interlanguages ==
The following table lists only &quot;one&quot; representative for each type explicitly. 
Among constructed languages, it is usual to distinguish between &quot;a priori languages&quot; and &quot;a posteriori languages&quot;. The latter are based on one or, more often, several source languages, while this is not evident for a priori languages, e.g., the philosophical languages of the 17th century, Solresol and the logical languages of the 20th century, such as Loglan and Lojban. Spontaneously arisen Interlanguages are necessarily a posteriori or iconic (using imaging or imitating signs).

<doc id="1274937" wikidata="Q7845190" url="?curid=1274937" title="Trolley Square">
<text>Trolley Square is a partially enclosed shopping center located in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. It is considered to be a trendy high-end center. The center is near downtown Salt Lake City and the UTA TRAX light-rail system.

==History==

===Description===
Trolley Square is composed of barns that were built in 1908 to house Salt Lake City&#x27;s streetcars. The streetcar system was dismantled in 1945, and the barns were converted into a two-story shopping center in 1972. The center is noted for its unusual architecture consisting of winding hallways, brick and wooden floors, fountains, old-trees, and wrought-iron balconies. Prominent tenants include Weller Book Works, Pottery Barn, Cabin Fever (a popular card store), Williams Sonoma, Old Spaghetti Factory, The Desert Edge Brewery at the Pub, The Spectacle, and local boutiques. The mall historically was home to a four-screen cinema and an amusement arcade.

The Trolley Square water tower is a 97-foot water tower that is a prominent feature of the Salt Lake City skyline, and is able to be spotted from miles away at night. The tower originally held 50,000 gallons of water, and was used to supply the sprinkler system for the trolley barns. In 1972, it was converted into a landmark, and covered in red and blue neon lights. For many years, the tower was a weather beacon, giving the local weather forecast based on the colors of lights, with solid blue being fair weather, flashing blue being overcast, solid red being rain, and flashing red being snow. The Trolley Square water tower was renovated in fall 2014, after years of disuse. During the renovation, the neon lights were removed - and were subsequently replaced with LED light strips which allowed for a wider spectrum of color availability. While the tower coloration is seemingly no longer used to display the weather forecast, different colors are now used decoratively during different seasons, holidays, or events.

Another prominent feature of Trolley Square is the sky bridge that connects the main building to a small parking lot located across the street. The bridge was made from a salvaged ore conveyor bridge formerly in use at the International Smelting and Refining Company facility in Tooele, Utah. The bridge goes over 600 South, and it features neon lights shaped in the form of a trolley.

===2007 shooting===
The Trolley Square shooting was a mass shooting that occurred on the evening of February 12, 2007 at the mall. A lone gunman, identified as Sulejman Talović, killed five bystanders and wounded four others before being shot dead by several members of the Salt Lake City Police Department. Authorities were not able to determine a motive.

===Location Influence===
Trolley Square is a prominent and well-known landmark in the Salt Lake City area. As such, many surrounding businesses and locales borrow or incorporate the name &quot;trolley.&quot; For example, Trolley Corners is a small office building located on the block directly to the east of Trolley Square, as is a small collection of houses that have been converted into businesses - known as trolley cottages. The nearest UTA Trax station is named &quot;Trolley station&quot;.

<text>GreenJolly (, &quot;Gryndzholy&quot;) was a Ukrainian hip hop duo. They represented Ukraine at the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest with the song &quot;Razom nas bahato&quot;, which became an unofficial anthem of the Ukrainian Orange Revolution.

==History==
GreenJolly consisted of Roman Kalyn and Roman Kostyuk, who originate from the Ivano-Frankivsk region of Western Ukraine.

After receiving a wild card to the final of the Ukrainian Eurovision pre-selection, &quot;Evrobachennya 2005 – Natsionalyni vidbir&quot;, the duo was chosen to represent their country at the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest in Kyiv, with the song &quot;Razom nas bahoto&quot;. In conjunction with various Ukrainian radio stations, the band wrote the song to support protests against electoral fraud that took place during the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. However, the track had to be reworked in order to comply with contest regulations, and the European Broadcasting Union. In the final, the duo finished 19th with 30 points, tied with Sweden.

Following their Eurovision appearance, the group disbanded.

<text>Thomas Derrick () was an English executioner during the Elizabethan Era.

Derrick served as a sailor in the Royal Navy during the Anglo-Spanish war and under the command of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, he took part in the capture of Cádiz. After the sack of the city, Derrick was one of 24 sailors sentenced to death by hanging, after they were convicted of committing rapes against local women. Since none of the other soldiers were willing to execute the delinquents, the Earl of Essex pardoned Derrick on the condition that he executed his co-accused. Derrick did so with startling efficiency on one of the fleet&#x27;s ships, by using blocks to string up the men on the spar.

In English history, executioner was not a commonly chosen career path because of the risk of friends and families of the deceased knowing who the executioner was and where to find him. Executioners were sometimes coerced into the role and following the fleet&#x27;s return to England, Derrick became an executioner at Tyburn. Derrick executed more than 3,000 people in his career, including his pardoner, the Earl of Essex, when he was convicted of treason in 1601. As a nobleman, the Earl of Essex was allowed to choose his own execution method and opted to be beheaded via axe. Derrick, unused to the sharp tool as a hangman, took three strokes to decapitate Essex.

Derrick devised a beam with a topping lift and pulleys for his hangings, instead of the old-fashioned rope over the beam method in use since 1388. Around 1610, he constructed a gallows with which over a dozen people could be hanged at the same time. The word &quot;derrick&quot; became an eponym for the frame from which the hangman&#x27;s noose was supported and through that usage (by analogy) to modern day cranes. Derrick was also the first executioner to be subject of a ballad in the English-speaking world.

<doc id="1274955" wikidata="Q5160707" url="?curid=1274955" title="Congregational Christian Churches">
<text>The Congregational Christian Churches was a Protestant Christian denomination that operated in the U.S. from 1931 through 1957. On the latter date, most of its churches joined the Evangelical and Reformed Church in a merger to become the United Church of Christ. Others created the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches or joined the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference that formed earlier in 1945. During the forementioned period, its churches were organized nationally into a General Council, with parallel state conferences, sectional associations, and missionary instrumentalities. Congregations, however, retained their local autonomy and these groups were legally separate from the congregations.

The body came into being in Seattle, Washington in 1931 by the merger of two American bodies that practiced congregational church governance, the National Council of the Congregational Churches of the United States and the General Convention of the Christian Church. Initially using the word &quot;and&quot; between the words &quot;Congregational&quot; and &quot;Christian,&quot; the new denomination decided to combine the predecessor churches&#x27; identities into one nationally, while its constituent churches remained free to either retain their original names or adopt the new usage.

==Heritages==
===Congregationalism===

Established by settlers in present-day New England fleeing religious persecution in their native England, the Congregational churches were identified with the Puritan theological and political perspective within Anglo-Saxon Protestantism during the 17th century. Many American historians have viewed their semi-democratic practices as laying the foundation for the representative nature of the U.S. political tradition. Although they were originally strongly Calvinist in the 18th century, eventually, by the 19th century, Congregationalists had accepted their peculiar vocation in U.S. religious life, maintaining a broadly orthodox faith while cultivating a passion for freedom, equality, and justice.

These ethical convictions would propel the Congregational churches into the forefront of social reform movements during the next 150 years or so. Most notable of these was strong support for the abolition of slavery among African-Americans in the Southern U.S. In the aftermath of the American Civil War, numerous pastors and female schoolteacher missionaries, working under the auspices of the American Missionary Association, established academies, colleges, and churches for the freedpeople; six of the colleges are still in existence. Later generations became involved in causes such as temperance, women&#x27;s suffrage, and the Social Gospel.

In the midst of this political involvement, Congregationalists held firmly to the notion that each local church was ruled directly by Jesus Christ, as testified to in the Bible and preached to those convicted by the Holy Spirit. Each thus constituted a spiritual republic unto itself, needing no authorization from outside ecclesiastical forces.

On the homefront, Congregationalism became primarily a grouping found among townspeople and affluent urban residents of New England, New York state, the Great Lakes region, portions of the Great Plains, and the Pacific Coast; roughly speaking, the Northern United States, a region strongly influenced by migrants from New England and New York. By the turn of the 20th century, the churches had begun to attract worshippers from outside their original base constituency of English-speaking Anglo-Americans. Immigrant groups that formed Congregational churches included Volga Germans, Swedes, Puerto Ricans, Chinese, Japanese, and Hawaiians. The Congregational churches also acquired two smaller church bodies: several Congregational Methodist churches in Alabama and Georgia, during the 1890s, and the Evangelical Protestant Churches in 1925, a German-immigrant group located primarily in and around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Cincinnati, Ohio.

Theologically, during the 19th century the Congregationalists shifted gradually from adherence to orthodox Reformed concepts and teachings (e.g., total depravity, limited atonement) toward a decidedly more liberal orientation, facilitated by a group of Yale University-educated pastors in and around the time of the Civil War. Led by the likes of Horace Bushnell and Nathaniel Taylor, the New Divinity men broke, some would say irrevocably, with the older pessimistic views of human nature espoused by classical Congregationalist divines such as Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards, declaring instead a more sanguine view of possibilities for the individual and society. Even as this grand shift may have attracted individuals weary of overbearing, harsh harangues from generations of revivalist preachers, numerous others deplored what they felt was an abandonment of the true faith. Such conservatives, especially outside New England, increasingly sought refuge in churches that held to more rigid doctrine, such as the Baptists and the Presbyterians.

Congregationalist losses to Presbyterianism increased greatly in the decades in which the &quot;Plan of Union,&quot; was in effect. Although it was designed by Connecticut Congregationalists and the Presbyterian General Assembly to avoid duplication of effort in evangelizing the frontier regions, this plan resulted in numerous Congregational-founded parishes being annexed to presbyteries, usually through the pastor&#x27;s affiliation and often without the local church&#x27;s assent. The need to dissolve that failed attempt at inter-denominationalism, which had already taken place among the Presbyterians, prompted a national gathering of Congregationalists in 1865 at Boston, Massachusetts. This was the first national meeting in more than 200 years, since the 1648 synod that produced the Cambridge Platform, a confession of faith similar to the Presbyterians&#x27; Westminster Confession. It was not until 1870, though, that a sufficient number of Congregationalists responded to a related call to organize nationally.

This was not the first time American Congregationalism had been shaken to its foundations by theological change; the Great Awakenings of the decades surrounding the turn of the 19th century had also left indelible marks upon the churches. Some churches openly embraced revivalism at the time, while others, particularly in the Boston area, reacted negatively to the developments by adopting Arminian viewpoints in opposition to the intensified Calvinism espoused by such preachers as Edwards and George Whitefield. Following the Great Awakening, many of the liberalized congregations would eventually depart the Congregational fellowship in 1825 to form the American Unitarian Association; this body is now known as the Unitarian Universalist Association.

Meanwhile, despite the cherished commitments to independence and freedom, Congregationalists increasingly began to espouse the main aims of the ecumenical movement within American (and world) Protestantism. This movement had gathered much energy from the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during the first third of the 20th century, and a perceived decline in that period of religious life among Americans. Congregational leaders pursued close relations with numerous Protestant groups, but one group emerged as a prime candidate for actual organizational union: the Christian Churches.

===The Christian Churches (&quot;Connection&quot;)===

While Puritans were consolidating their domination of religious, political and intellectual life in New England, elsewhere in America, during the period immediately before the American Revolution, many newly arrived settlers became dissatisfied with theology, preaching, liturgy, and ecclesiology inherited from Europe. Many of these people had turned to revivalist faiths such as the Methodists and the Baptists, and most found spiritual homes within those groups, or others deriving from the ferment started by the Great Awakenings.

However, in different parts of the country, several preachers led dissenting movements against the leadership of some of those churches. In the 1790s, James O&#x27;Kelly, a Methodist pastor serving churches in central North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, took exception to the development of an episcopacy within his church. He believed that the rise of bishops, strongly advocated by the likes of Francis Asbury, would approximate the powers of the recently disestablished Anglican church and thus unduly control the ministry, particularly through the practice of itinerancy. When leaders ignored O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s protests, he and some sympathizers withdrew from the Methodist Church to form a body originally known as the &quot;Republican Methodist Church.&quot; Upon extensive discussion and prayer, O&#x27;Kelly began to hold that the name implied a sectarianism that was quite at odds with what he felt were prescriptions from the New Testament prohibiting churches from identifying with mere human opinions. Thus, he and others arrived at the notion that their churches should bear simply the name of &quot;Christian.&quot;

Several hundred miles to the north in Vermont, a Baptist preacher by the name of Abner Jones began to refute the then-prevalent Calvinist dogmas within his fellowship. He led some of his followers out of his congregation into a new fellowship founded upon a platform similar to O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s, with a strong emphasis upon open communion and freedom of conscience. Later in the first decade of the 19th century, he and a New Hampshire pastor began publishing a newspaper for the movement, &quot;Herald of Gospel Liberty,&quot; reputed by some historians to have been the first general-interest religious periodical in the U.S. The movement progressed throughout New England, especially within those two states, as well as Maine and Massachusetts. Adherents of the Congregational &quot;Standing Order&quot; treated the new churches in a generally hostile fashion.

Both movements were restorationist in outlook, and influenced the later Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement. That later movement produced several larger groups that continue to operate today: the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Christian churches and churches of Christ, and the Churches of Christ.

The geographically disparate Northern and Southern wings of the Christian movement did eventually discover each other, and they formed a convention in 1820. At that time, they agreed on a general list of five (some scholars have claimed six) principles unifying the otherwise diverse congregations. The unity did not survive engrossing controversies over slavery and the ensuing Civil War. The &quot;Christian Connection,&quot; as was also the case with American Protestant groups such as the Methodists, Presbyterians, and Baptists, split once again into Northern and Southern factions. The Northern group catalyzed the split, as many of its leaders, much like those of the Congregationalists, strongly denounced slavery. The Northerners used the schism as an occasion to legally take denominational form, in 1850. Despite the bitterness of the split, Christians in both sections reunited much sooner than did the other separated groups, forming the General Convention of the Christian Church in 1890.

Many Southern/O&#x27;Kelly Christians owned slaves, some of whom formed churches of their own in that tradition after the Emancipation Proclamation. Centered in central and eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, African-American Christian congregations formed a convention of their own in the 1890s. This convention existed until 1950, well after the Congregational Christian merger; that year it joined the Convention of the South, heretofore composed of Congregational churches founded by the American Missionary Association.

Theologically, the Christian Churches did not encourage a highly elaborate system of doctrine or Biblical interpretation. Relatively few of their ministers were educated past the elementary grades, a characteristic that persisted well into the early 20th century. Their leanings were toward revivalist Wesleyanism, emphasizing traditional evangelical themes such as regeneration, acceptance of personal salvation, and the performance of good works of charity. Few if any of their members were inherently predisposed toward polemical attacks upon other traditions, although some pastors and churches would eventually identify with the emerging fundamentalist movement in later decades.

By the time that the Congregationalists had approached Christian leaders about possible union, some disaffected adherents of the wing of Restoration Movement led by Barton Stone and Alexander Campbell had joined the Christian Connection. This group gave the movement a geographical complexion that entailed pockets of strength in New England, upstate New York, southeastern Virginia, central and eastern North Carolina, western Georgia, eastern Alabama, southwestern Ohio, and eastern Indiana, with dispersed congregations in parts of the Great Plains. Most of the membership was rural, outside major cities, usually engaged in farming or similar occupations.

The Christians founded schools such as Ohio&#x27;s Defiance College and Antioch College and North Carolina&#x27;s Elon University; during the early 20th century, an academy and seminary for African-Americans operated in Franklinton, North Carolina. Defiance continues to relate to the United Church of Christ today.

==Early post-merger years==
After the 1931 merger, relatively few practices and customs changed drastically within either of the uniting traditions, largely because its members, like most Americans, were overwhelmed by, first, the Great Depression, and, later, World War II. It would not be until after the latter concluded that the CC churches would embark on anything like a major church extension program; this was the case, of course, with most U.S. denominations during this period, as their churches often struggled to merely stay open, with little or nothing left over for mission work.

Congregationalists constituted about 85-90% of the membership of the new denomination; this caused few if any resentments or conflicts because, by and large, the two groups did not overlap each other geographically, except in parts of New England, upstate New York, Ohio, and among African-American churches in North Carolina. Regional judicatories and national domestic and foreign mission agencies merged quite smoothly, often continuing to use varying terminologies (e.g., &quot;convention,&quot; &quot;conference,&quot; &quot;association&quot;), depending on custom. On the domestic front, most of the new church planting efforts were concentrated in newly developing areas such as southern California, Arizona, Florida, and suburbs of major Midwestern cities (e.g., Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis). Abroad, many CC missionary efforts shifted their emphases toward medical and social services, particularly after many of the churches Congregationalists had founded in earlier decades had formed autonomous bodies of their own.

One distinguishing trait of the new fellowship, aside from its unusually tolerant attitude regarding subscription to ancient doctrines, was its bold enthusiasm for ecumenical adventures, especially those growing out of the &quot;Faith and Order&quot; and &quot;Life and Work&quot; inter-church initiatives in Great Britain in the 1920s and 1930s. These developments and others led to the founding of the World Council of Churches in 1948, of which the Congregational Christian Churches was a charter member. In the U.S., the Congregational Christians made several overtures to other Protestant groups toward federative unions and/or organic mergers in the years before World War II. But the main legacy of those discussions was what became the United Church of Christ in 1957.

==UCC merger talks==
The Rev. Dr. Truman Douglass, pastor of St. Louis&#x27; Pilgrim Congregational Church, met with the Rev. Dr. Samuel Press, president of Eden Theological Seminary in that city, a seminary of the Evangelical and Reformed Church, a denomination predominantly of German origin and itself a merger of two previously separated traditions, as part of an informal interchurch discussion group in 1937. Douglass&#x27; and Press&#x27; talks led to the involvement of both bodies in proposals to consider organic union, work that eventually culminated in the Basis of Union in 1943, which both national bodies approved after a five-year period of revising. The Rev. Dr. Douglas Horton, a former Harvard Divinity School dean, had become the CC general minister and president by this point, and became the prime figure in the CC union efforts.

===&quot;Continuing Congregationalism&quot;===
However, a small but vocal minority of ministers and laymen protested the developments, charging that any merger with a confessional, presbyterial body such as the E&amp;R Church would destroy the heritage and structure of American Congregationalism. These opponents formed groups that published pamphlets and attempted to persuade churches to reject the proposed merger. An anti-merger congregation in Brooklyn filed suit against the CC moderator, Helen Kenyon, in 1949 to legally stop the merger proceedings; the major legal contention made by the church and the anti-union advocates was that the CC General Council possessed no authority to enter into a merger as a national entity. After some initial victories in lower courts, a New York state Court of Appeals declined jurisdiction and judged in favor of Ms. Kenyon and the CC Churches in 1953. With this defeat, the anti-merger forces turned instead toward forming a new denomination, which became the National Association of Congregational Christian Churches, founded in 1955; a preponderance of these churches were located in non-metropolitan New England, southeastern Michigan, parts of Wisconsin and Illinois, and southern California. Some years before that, motivated by different concerns, chiefly doctrine, a group of evangelical-leaning congregations formed the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference, in 1948.

===Union approved===
The final vote on participation by the General Council of Congregational Christian Churches in the UCC merger took place at the 1956 General Council, meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Eighty-eight (88) percent of the delegates approved the motion to unite with the Evangelical and Reformed Church, and the latter body&#x27;s General Synod approved by an even wider margin. This set the stage for the Uniting General Synod, which took place in Cleveland, Ohio, on June 25, 1957; the General Council of Congregationalism Christian Churches were represented by the Rev. Fred Hoskins, who had succeeded Horton some years earlier as general minister and president. Hoskins would become, along with E&amp;R President James Wagner, one of the co-presidents of the UCC. The actual consummation of the UCC, however, did not occur until 1961, when a sufficient number of CC congregations voted to approve the denomination&#x27;s new constitution.

The CC Churches brought into the new UCC approximately 1.4 million members, about 60 percent of the total number of members in the new denomination. In order to attend to necessary legal business continuing from years past, the General Council remained incorporated until 1984, when it finally dissolved.

<text>&quot;Open pollination&quot; and &quot;open pollinated&quot; refer to a variety of concepts in the context of the sexual reproduction of plants. Generally speaking, the term refers to plants pollinated naturally by birds, insects, wind, or human hands.

==True-breeding definition==
&quot;Open pollinated&quot; generally refers to seeds that will &quot;breed true&quot;. When the plants of an open-pollinated variety self-pollinate, or are pollinated by another representative of the same variety, the resulting seeds will produce plants roughly identical to their parents. This is in contrast to the seeds produced by plants that are the result of a recent cross (such as, but not confined to, an F1 hybrid), which are likely to show a wide variety of differing characteristics. Open-pollinated varieties are also often referred to as standard varieties or, when the seeds have been saved across generations or across several decades, heirloom varieties. While heirlooms are usually open-pollinated, open-pollinated seeds are not necessarily heirlooms; open-pollinated varieties are still being developed.

One of the challenges in maintaining an open-pollinated variety is avoiding introduction of pollen from other strains. Based on how broadly the pollen for the plant tends to disperse, it can be controlled to varying degrees by greenhouses, tall wall enclosures, field isolation, or other techniques.

Because they breed true, the seeds of open-pollinated plants are often saved by home gardeners and farmers. Popular examples of open-pollinated plants include heirloom tomatoes, beans, peas, and many other garden vegetables.

==Uncontrolled pollination definition==
A second use of the term &quot;open pollination&quot; refers to pollination by insects, birds, wind, or other natural mechanisms. This can be contrasted with cleistogamy, closed pollination, which is one of the many types of self pollination. 

When used in this sense, open pollination may contrast with controlled pollination, a procedure used to ensure that all seeds of a crop are descended from parents with known traits, and are therefore more likely to have the desired traits.

The seeds of open-pollinated plants will produce new generations of those plants; however, because breeding is uncontrolled and the pollen (male parent) source is unknown, open pollination may result in plants that vary widely in genetic traits. Open pollination may increase biodiversity.

Some plants (such as many crops) are primarily self pollenizing and also breed true, so that even under open pollination conditions the next generation will be (almost) the same. Even among true breeding organisms, some variation due to genetic recombination or to mutation can produce a few &quot;off types&quot;.

==Relationship to hybridization==
Hybrid pollination, a type of controlled pollination in which the pollen comes from a different strain (or species), can be used to increase crop suitability, especially through heterosis. The resulting hybrid strain can sometimes be inbred and selected for desired traits until a strain that breeds true by open pollination is achieved. The result is referred to as an inbred hybrid strain. 

To add some confusion, the term hybrid inbred applies to hybrids that are made from selected inbred lines that have certain desired characteristics (see inbreeding). The latter type of hybrid is sometimes designated F1 hybrid, i.e. the first hybrid (filial) generation whose parents were (different) inbred lines.

<doc id="1274967" wikidata="Q342512" url="?curid=1274967" title="Tiberius Claudius Nero (father of Tiberius Caesar)">
<text>Tiberius Claudius Nero ( 82 – 33 BC) was a Roman politician, senator, and praetor who lived in the 1st century BC.

He was notable for being the first husband of Livia, before she divorced him to marry the future emperor Augustus, and the biological father of the second Roman emperor Tiberius.

==Ancestry==

Nero was a member of the republican Claudia gens of Rome. He was a descendant of the censor Appius Claudius Caecus. Nero was the son of Tiberius Claudius Nero and his mother was a descendant of the Claudian gens. Nero had a sister called Claudia, who married the prefect Quintus Volusius.

==Life==
Nero had served as a quaestor to Julius Caesar in 48 BC, commanding his fleet in the Alexandrian War. Having achieved victory over the Egyptian navy, he was rewarded with a priesthood. Julius Caesar had sent Nero to create Roman colonies in Gaul and in other provinces.

Despite his service with Julius Caesar, Nero was an Optimate at heart. After the murder of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, when it seemed that the assassins were triumphant, he suggested that they be rewarded for their services to the state. However, due to his previous alliance with the Roman dictator, Nero was allowed to be elected praetor in 42 BC.

Around the time Nero was elected praetor in 42 BC, he married his relative Livia Drusilla, whose father Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus was from the same gens. His son of the same name was born November 16, 42 BC, at Fondi Italy. Elaine Fantham believes it is likely that Nero had been married before he wed Livia, as he was already looking for a wife in 50 BC when he approached Cicero to marry his daughter Tullia.

=== Second Triumvirate ===
Shortly afterwards, the Second Triumvirate began to break down, causing a dangerous situation in Rome as the triumvirs went to battle with each other. Nero was forced to choose sides and in his distrust of Octavian, he cast his lot with Mark Antony. In 41 BC, he fled Rome with Livia and Tiberius in tow, joining Antony&#x27;s brother Lucius in Perusia. Perusia was besieged by Octavian&#x27;s men by the time Nero arrived, and when the town fell in 40 BC, he was forced to flee first to Praeneste, and then Naples. In 40 BC, Octavian and Mark Antony finally reconciled.

In Naples, Nero tried in vain to raise a slave battalion against Octavian and then took refuge with Sextus Pompey, who was then acting as a pirate leader in Sicily. Nero with his family joined Mark Antony soon after in Achaea.
After three years of fleeing from Octavian, Nero returned to Rome with Livia and the younger Tiberius, aged 3. Octavian immediately after catching sight of Livia, fell in love with her, despite the fact that she was still married. Octavian was married to Scribonia, with whom he had a daughter called Julia, now known as Julia the Elder. Octavian and Scribonia divorced. Around this time Livia was also pregnant and despite this, Nero was persuaded or forced by Octavian to divorce Livia. Nero and Livia&#x27;s second son was born in early 38 BC and he was named Decimus Claudius Drusus, which was later changed to Nero Claudius Drusus. Using a cognomen such as &quot;Nero&quot; as a first name was unusual, as was the prominence given to his maternal lineage in adopting &quot;Drusus&quot; as his cognomen. Octavian and Livia married on January 17, waiving the traditional waiting period. Nero was present at their wedding, giving Livia away &quot;just as a father would&quot;. As agreed, Nero took his sons to his home, where they were raised and educated.

==Death==
Nero died in 33 BC. After his death, his sons went to live with their mother and stepfather. The younger Tiberius, aged 9, delivered his funeral eulogy on the Rostra in Rome. When the future Roman emperor Tiberius celebrated his coming of age, he staged two gladiatorial contests; one was held at the Forum in memory of his father and the other at the amphitheatre in memory of his grandfather Drusus.

<text>The Foreign Service Journal is a monthly publication of the American Foreign Service Association. It covers foreign affairs from the perspective of American Foreign Service personnel, members of Washington&#x27;s foreign policy establishment, as well as features on living overseas as a foreign affairs professional. The publication currently has a circulation of 17,500 with approximately 35,000 readers.

==History==
The American Foreign Service Association was preceded by The American Consular Service Association which was founded in the spring of 1918. In March 1919 the American Consular Service Association published the first issue of the American Consular Bulletin. The diplomatic and consular branches of the State Department were combined into a single Foreign Service by the Rogers Act of 1924 and, as a result, the American Consular Service Association gave way to the American Foreign Service Association. It was decided to continue the monthly American Consular Bulletin as the official publication of the expanded association. In 1924, with the publication of the October issue, the title of the bulletin was changed to American Foreign Service Journal. The publication&#x27;s name was shortened to its present form, the Foreign Service Journal, with the publication of the August, 1951, issue.

<text>Carl&#x27;s Afternoon in the Park () is a children&#x27;s picture book by Alexandra Day. The book was copyrighted in 1991. The book is largely pictorial with text only on the very first and very last pages.

==Synopsis==
The book starts when a woman walking in the park with her baby daughter and her rottweiler Carl run into a friend of hers. The lady&#x27;s friend has with her a rottweiler puppy. The two friends decide to go off to have some tea and leave the baby alone with the rottweiler and the rottie pup. The book is a look at the adventures of a dog and a baby in the park. At the end of the book, the women return to express that they hope the dog and baby weren&#x27;t bored after having been left alone too long.

==Reception==
&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; states &#x27;Move over, Mary Poppins, and make room for Carl, the ravishing rottweiler babysitter who makes his fourth and perhaps finest appearance yet in this gorgeously colored picture book.&#x27;, while &quot;Kirkus&quot; finds that &#x27;The dogs are as charmingly true to life as ever, while the fantasy will beguile fans and worry a few literal-minded caregivers.&#x27;

<text>Lamb&#x27;s Navy Rum is a sugar-cane based Caribbean rum popular in the UK and Canada.

In 1849, 22-year-old Londoner Alfred Lamb, son of wine and spirits merchant William Lamb, blended 18 different rums from Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad to produce Lamb&#x27;s Navy Rum. His company took the name Alfred Lamb &amp; Son.

The use of the term &quot;navy rum&quot; dates back to the Royal Navy issuing a daily ration of rum to its sailors. It had previously given its sailors French brandy, but the 1655 conquest of Jamaica gave it access to rum, which it quickly exploited. Lamb&#x27;s was never an official supplier to the Royal Navy. The 1970 decision of the British Royal Navy to end issuing daily rum rations to its sailors inspired the brand that year to adopt the advertising campaign, &quot;Join the Lamb’s Navy.&quot;

Alfred Lamb &amp; Son was bombed out of its London premises on Great Tower Street in World War II. Its competitor, White Keeling Rum Merchants, was bombed out of its premises, too. Portal, Dingwall &amp; Norris took them both into its premises at 40 Eastcheap, London, inspiring the three companies to merge in 1946 to form United Rum Merchants.

In 1952, Canadian company Corby Distilleries signed an agreement with United Rum Merchants to bottle the brand under licence in Canada.

Lamb&#x27;s became part of the Allied Lyons portfolio in 1984, which itself was acquired (as Allied Domecq) in 2005 by French drinks giant Pernod Ricard. As part of the deal, Pernod Ricard had to sell off some brands, and Lamb&#x27;s was acquired by Corby, which became an affiliate of Pernod Ricard by virtue of the Allied Domecq purchase.

Corby Distilleries bottles Lamb&#x27;s in Canada for the North American markets. Outside North America, it is also bottled by Halewood International in England, which distributes it in Europe, Africa and Asia.

In 2009, Halewood International launched a spiced version aimed at international markets. This failed to meet sales expectations, so it was reformulated in 2014.

<text>The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA), established in 1924, is the professional association of the United States Foreign Service. With over 15,000 due-paying members, AFSA represents 28,000 active and retired Foreign Service employees of the Department of State and Agency for International Development (AID), as well as smaller groups in the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), Foreign Commercial Service (FCS), and International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB).

==History==

American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s principal missions are to enhance the effectiveness of the Foreign Service, to protect the professional interests of its members, to ensure the maintenance of high professional standards for both career diplomats and political appointees, and to promote understanding of the critical role of the Foreign Service in promoting America&#x27;s national security and economic prosperity.

American Foreign Service Association is the exclusive bargaining agent for the Foreign Service employees of all five agencies. In this labor/management relations capacity, American Foreign Service Association negotiates with the agency management on personnel policies and practices affecting members&#x27; working conditions. American Foreign Service Association also represents members in formal grievance proceedings, office of security and inspector general investigations, and EEO cases, while providing them informal assistance in dealing with administrative problems.

Foreign Service retiree concerns are an integral part of the American Foreign Service Association agenda. American Foreign Service Association works closely with retired Foreign Service personnel on legislative issues related to retiree pensions and benefits. Retirees, individually and through independent retiree groups around the country, actively promote the Foreign Service and international engagement in their communities.

In its efforts to explain the Foreign Service&#x27;s role and to build domestic constituencies to support its activities, American Foreign Service Association operates a speakers&#x27; bureau, which makes experienced diplomats available to speak to a wide range of groups all across the country. Through Road Scholar programs, American Foreign Service Association members conduct continuing education classes on the Foreign Service.

==Governance==
AFSA&#x27;s Governing Board is elected by the membership every two years. The board&#x27;s constitution is governed by the American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s bylaws. The board has 21 members for the 2019-2021 term.

AFSA&#x27;s president is Ambassador Eric S. Rubin, a career Foreign Service Officer and member of the Senior Foreign Service who served as U.S. Ambassador to Bulgaria from 2016-2019.

==Offices==
AFSA maintains its headquarters building at 2101 E Street NW in Washington, DC. There are also smaller offices within the Department of State, USAID, and the Department of Commerce.

==Awards==
Since 1968, American Foreign Service Association has honored achievement, performance, courage and sacrifice within the Foreign Service community through their awards program. All of American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s awards programs, as well the American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s memorial plaques, are administered by American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s Coordinator for Special Awards and Outreach.

===Constructive Dissent Awards===
American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s Constructive Dissent Awards recognize Foreign Service members who work constructively within the system to change policy and performance for the better. Such dissents may be made in any non-public channel including meetings, emails to superiors, memoranda, telegrams, or via the State Department&#x27;s formal Dissent Channel. Thus, American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s Constructive Dissent Awards may be given to, but are not restricted to, employees who send in Dissent Channel messages. These awards are unique within the federal government, and remain the center of American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s awards program. There are four awards:
* F. Allen &#x27;Tex&#x27; Harris Award for Foreign Service Specialists
* W. Averell Harriman Award for entry-level officers
* William R. Rivkin Award for mid-level officers
* Christian A. Herter Award for members of the Senior Foreign Service

===Exemplary Performance Awards===
Six Exemplary Performance Awards are given each year to highlight the professionalism and spirit of service and volunteerism found within the Foreign Service community. These awards honor community liaison officers, office management specialists, family members, and American Foreign Service Association post representatives for their important contributions at work, at home and in the community at large. In addition, these awards honor contributions to American Foreign Service Association and those who have excelled in the advancement of democracy. 
* Nelson B. Delavan Award
* Avis Bohlen Award
* M. Juanita Guess Award
* AFSA Achievement and Contributions to the Association Award
* Post Representative of the Year Award
* Mark Palmer Award for the Advancement of Democracy

===Lifetime Contributions to American Diplomacy===
The American Foreign Service Association established its award for Lifetime Contributions to American Diplomacy in 1995. By giving this high-profile award, American Foreign Service Association also seeks to bring greater recognition to its other awards, including its unique annual awards for constructive dissent Candidates are proposed by American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s Awards and Plaque Committee. The American Foreign Service Association governing board makes the final decision.

Originally, there were no criteria beyond those implied by the award&#x27;s name. In 2009, the American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s Governing Board specified that &quot;lifetime&quot; means at least a decade of service to diplomacy, ideally including continuing involvement after retirement. The contributions should include involvement in foreign policy development and/or implementation as well as efforts that advance the diplomatic profession. Recipients will normally be career diplomats, but may include other individuals in exceptional cases. Recipients must attend American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s annual awards ceremony.

The presentation takes place during American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s annual Awards Ceremony in June in the Benjamin Franklin Diplomatic Room of the State Department. The Secretary of State is invited to present this award. If the Secretary is unable to attend, a distinguished individual who has worked with the recipient is asked to present the award. Colin Powell presented the award to Thomas Pickering and to George Shultz; Elliot Richardson presented the award to Frank Carlucci; Mr. Carlucci presented it to Lee Hamilton; Robert Zoellick presented it to Richard Lugar; Senator Lugar presented to award to Senator Nunn; and Lawrence Eagleburger presented the award to Joan Clark. Honorees are presented with a globe and certificate.

The Lifetime Contributions to American Diplomacy is American Foreign Service Association&#x27;s highest award. It is offered to an inspiring and respected diplomat or public servant for their contributions to the conduct and success of American diplomacy. The criteria call for a sustained commitment to the cause for a good portion of their professional lives.

Previous Recipients of the Lifetime Contributions to American Diplomacy Award:
===Sinclaire Language Awards===
These awards celebrate those Foreign Service employees who have demonstrated the greatest facility and success in the learning and utilization of languages in their career. This learning may have taken place at FSI or individually. The awards are made possible through a generous bequest from former Foreign Service Officer Mathilda W. Sinclaire.

===George F. Kennan Strategic Writing Award===
Each year, American Foreign Service Association honors the State Department employee whose essay has been chosen as the best from among their cohort during the National War College graduation ceremonies. The award is named after George Kennan.

===AFSA Memorial Plaques===
Two large memorial plaques in the C Street lobby of the Department of State honor colleagues who have given their lives in service to their country. Each year, names are added and those on the plaques are honored during a solemn ceremony on Foreign Affairs Day.

===AFSA National High School Essay Contest===
The National High School Essay Contest is available to all High School students in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and to U.S. citizens pursuing high school education abroad. The competition awards a $2,500 cash prize, a paid trip to Washington, D.C., to meet the Secretary of State and a tuition-free Semester at Sea upon enrollment at an accredited post-secondary institution.

<doc id="1275019" wikidata="Q134113" url="?curid=1275019" title="Peter Gabriel (1977 album)">
<text>Peter Gabriel is the debut studio album by the English singer-songwriter and producer Peter Gabriel, released in February 1977 by Charisma Records. After his departure from the progressive rock band Genesis was made public in 1975, Gabriel took a break to concentrate on his family life. In 1976, he began writing material for a solo album and met producer Bob Ezrin, who agreed to produce it. Gabriel hired several additional musicians to play on the album, including guitarist Robert Fripp and bassist Tony Levin. The album was later known as Peter Gabriel I or Car, referring to the album&#x27;s artwork produced by Hipgnosis. Some music streaming services, including Gabriel&#x27;s own Bandcamp page, refer to it as Peter Gabriel 1: Car.

Upon the album&#x27;s release, it peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 38 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It has since reached Gold certification in both countries for selling 100,000 and 500,000 copies, respectively. The song &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; was the first single from the album, and peaked at No. 13 in the UK. Gabriel supported the album with a tour of Europe and the US through 1977, featuring a seven-piece band including Fripp and Levin. The album was remastered in 2002 and 2011.

== Background and recording ==
In August 1975, Gabriel&#x27;s departure from the progressive rock band Genesis was made public. He had announced the decision to leave the band early into their tour supporting &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (1974), citing estrangement from the other members, the strains on his marriage, and his wish to spend more time with his family. He also wanted to avoid giving the impression of quitting Genesis &quot;to run off and do my solo album&quot;, and took a break. Genesis drummer Phil Collins, who later replaced Gabriel as lead vocalist, said the band had known about Gabriel&#x27;s departure for some time. When they learned that Gabriel was to make a solo album, they sent a telegram wishing him luck.

By mid-1976, Gabriel had recorded a collection of demos for his album. One of those songs, &quot;Excuse Me&quot;, was written in 1975 with poet Martin Hall, a creative partnership that predated Gabriel&#x27;s departure from Genesis. He considered several producers, including Todd Rundgren and Jack Nitzsche. Someone suggested Canadian producer Bob Ezrin, known for working with Alice Cooper, Lou Reed and Kiss. Gabriel played his demo of &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot; to Ezrin, who enjoyed the track so much he went to bed that night singing the song. He said: &quot;We understood each other. We talked. There was an excellent rapport immediately – a human rapport – and that was what I was looking for above all.&quot; The pair agreed to share production duties; Ezrin led the &quot;American rhythm sections&quot; and &quot;very rock passages&quot;, while Gabriel led the &quot;more European things&quot; and &quot;quiet parts&quot;.

&quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; was recorded at The Soundstage in Toronto in the autumn of 1976, with additional sessions at Morgan and Olympic Studios in London. Gabriel was uncertain of what parts he could and could not perform, so he agreed to Ezrin&#x27;s choice of musicians, including bassist Tony Levin. Some of the musicians, including synthesizer player Larry Fast and guitarist Robert Fripp, were selected by Gabriel to tackle his soundscape-oriented ideas. Roy Bittan of the E Street Band was originally contacted to contribute keyboards on the album, but management prevented him from participating. Gabriel recalled the Toronto sessions as &quot;fast, exciting and hot&quot;. After two days of hearing Levin play, Gabriel invited him to play on the tour. Other musicians, including drummer Allan Schwartzberg, percussionist Jimmy Maelen, guitarist Steve Hunter, and keyboardist Jozef Chirowski were also recruited for the album. Many of the session musicians had previously worked together on some Lou Reed and Alice Cooper records.

Although mainly happy with the music, Gabriel felt that the album, particularly &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot;, was overproduced. Piano-only or piano with synth versions of that song appear on Fripp&#x27;s album &quot;Exposure&quot; and his appearance on Kate Bush&#x27;s television special in December 1979, in which Gabriel and Bush sang &quot;Another Day&quot; by Roy Harper. A third version appeared on the 1990 compilation album &quot;Shaking the Tree: Sixteen Golden Greats&quot;. Gabriel often performs the song live, accompanied by only himself on keyboard, either in German or English, depending on the audience. The song debuted during an appearance on Thames Television&#x27;s &quot;Good Afternoon&quot; in the summer of 1976.

==Artwork==
The front cover depicts Gabriel sitting in the front passenger seat of a 1974 Lancia 2000 owned by Storm Thorgerson, co-founder of Hipgnosis and the cover&#x27;s designer. For the shoot, which took place in Wandsworth, London, the car was sprayed with water from a hose. The black-and-white image was then hand-coloured, and reflections modified using a scalpel by artist Richard Manning. Because Gabriel&#x27;s first four albums were not titled or numbered, the album later became informally known as &quot;Car&quot;. An alternative proposal was to feature a photograph of Gabriel wearing contact lenses intended to give his eyes the appearance of metallic ball bearings; this was included on the inner sleeve.

==Release==
&quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; was released on 7 February 1977 on Charisma Records in the UK and Atco Records in North America. The album reached No. 7 in the UK and No. 38 in the US. &quot;Solsbury Hill&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single became a Top 20 hit in the UK and reached No. 68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The second single, &quot;Modern Love&quot;, did not chart.

After &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot;″s release, Gabriel assembled a touring band, consisting of Fripp (occasionally using the pseudonym &quot;Dusty Rhodes&quot;, and sometimes performing from offstage) and Hunter on guitar, Levin on bass, Fast on synthesisers, Schwartzberg on drums, Phil Aaberg on keyboards and Jimmy Maelen on percussion. The first leg of his debut solo tour, entitled &quot;Expect the Unexpected&quot;, started on 5 March 1977 in the United States and continued until April. The UK portion of the tour concluded on 30 April. A second leg assembled a different band, which included Sid McGinnis on guitar, Levin on bass, Jerry Marotta on drums and Bayeté on keyboards. The &quot;Sightings in the Test Area During Autumn&quot; leg began on 30 August and saw the band play throughout England and Europe before concluding on 1 November 1977.

== Reception ==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Stephen Demorest described &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; as &quot;a grab bag collection of songs that bear little resemblance to one another&quot; and called it &quot;an impressively rich debut album&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; found it &quot;a lot smarter&quot; than Gabriel&#x27;s past work in Genesis, and despite noting that &quot;every time I delve beneath its challenging textures to decipher a line or two I come up a little short&quot;, felt that the album was &quot;worth considering&quot;. Nick Kent, writing in &quot;NME&quot; in 1978, said that &quot;Peter Gabriel&quot; was &quot;a fine record with at least one 24-carat irresistible classic in &#x27;Solsbury Hill&#x27; and a strong supporting cast of material that, all in all, in a year besmeared with great albums was, in retrospect, sorely underrated&quot;. The album received the prize of the French Académie Charles Cros.

<doc id="1275028" wikidata="Q16985733" url="?curid=1275028" title="Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha">
<text>Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), was a United States Supreme Court case ruling in 1983 that the one-house legislative veto violated the constitutional separation of powers.

==Background==
Section 244(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, , authorized the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to suspend deportation of an alien continually residing in the United States for at least seven years where the U.S. Attorney General, in his discretion, found that deportation would result in &quot;extreme hardship&quot;. After making such a finding, the Attorney General would transmit a report to Congress pursuant to § 244(c)(1) and either house of Congress had the power to veto the Attorney General&#x27;s determination pursuant to § 244(c)(2).

===Facts===
Respondent Jagdish Rai Chadha was born in the British colony of Kenya to Indian parents. Chadha was a Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies and entered the United States on a British passport when studying in Ohio as a foreign exchange student. After Kenya&#x27;s declaration of independence from Britain in 1963 he was not recognized as a legitimate citizen or resident of Kenya (as his parents were Indian) or India (as he was born in Kenya). Furthermore, his right of abode in the United Kingdom was stripped under the Immigration Act 1971 due to his lack of connection with the United Kingdom. After his non-immigrant student visa expired in 1972, none of the three countries would accept him onto their territory, rendering him &quot;de facto&quot; stateless.

The INS initiated deportation proceedings against Chadha. Chadha sought to suspend his deportation, and the INS accommodated his request according to § 244(a)(1), and transmitted a report of the suspension to Congress according to § 244(c)(2). The House of Representatives vetoed the suspension of Chadha&#x27;s deportation, and the INS resumed deportation proceedings. Chadha raised constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2), but the immigration judge found no authority to rule on such claims and ordered Chadha deported. Chadha then appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which also found it lacked any authority to consider constitutional objections to § 244(c)(2). Chadha appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for review of the deportation order, and the INS supported his challenge to the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2). The Ninth Circuit found § 244(c)(2) unconstitutional and ordered the Attorney General to suspend deportation proceedings. The INS appealed the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision to the Supreme Court in order to obtain a final judgment on the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2).

The House and Senate, as &quot;amici curiae&quot;, argued that the Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General&#x27;s determination was constitutionally invalid. It asked the United States Supreme Court to reverse the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s decision.

Congress argued that: (1) Chadha lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of § 244(c)(2) because that section is not severable from § 244(a)(1). Therefore, if Chadha were to succeed in invalidating § 244(c)(2), his means of remedy in § 244(a)(1) would also be destroyed, and there would be no relief possible; (2) the Court did not have jurisdiction over the issue because the Attorney General and INS enforced the challenged statute and thereby effectively waived their right to challenge it; (3) the action was not a genuine case or controversy, as both the original plaintiff and defendant challenged the statute without real opposition; (4) the action was a non-justiciable political question.

==Holding==
The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals&#x27; judgment. In an opinion by Chief Justice Burger, the court held that the resolution of the House of Representatives vetoing the Attorney General&#x27;s determination was constitutionally invalid, unenforceable, and not binding. Congress may not promulgate a statute granting to itself a legislative veto over actions of the executive branch inconsistent with the bicameralism principle and Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution.

The court rebutted Congress&#x27;s assertions as follows: (1) § 244(c)(2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act is severable from the rest of the act pursuant to the express severability clause § 406. The legislative history of § 244 supports the proposition that Congress, frustrated with the process of passing private laws to provide relief for deportable individuals, would likely not have been willing to retain the private law mechanism rather than ceding all power to the Attorney General. (2) The Attorney General and INS did not waive their right to challenge the constitutionality of the statute by enforcing the statute. (3) The action is a genuine case with adequate representation in favor of sustaining the act provided by the houses of Congress as &quot;amici curiae&quot;. (4) The case is a judicable question, not exempted by the political question doctrine; the constitutionality of a statute is a question for the courts.

The court then presented its affirmative reasoning: (5) When the Constitution provides express procedures, such procedures must be strictly observed. Two such provisions are bicameralism and presentment in the enactment of law. (6) The presentment process—especially the President&#x27;s veto power—was intended by the Framers to provide a mechanism by which the executive branch could defend itself against legislative encroachment and could prevent ill-conceived policies. (7) Similarly, the bicameralism requirement was formulated in order to hinder congressional action and thereby prevent legislative encroachment. (8) The action of the House of Representatives is legislative in nature because (a) it modifies rights and duties of individuals outside the legislative branch; (b) the enactment would otherwise have required a private law, which is a legislative function; and (c) the nature of the action is inherently legislative. (9) When the Framers intended to authorize Congress to exercise power outside of the bicameral and presentment principles, it provided alternate procedures explicitly; other procedures cannot be admitted. (10) Because the action of the House of Representatives was legislative, but did not conform to the mode of action specifically stated by the Constitution for legislative action, it is therefore invalid, unenforceable, and not binding.

===Concurrence===
Justice Powell, in a concurring opinion, argued that to invalidate all legislative veto provisions is a serious matter, as Congress views the legislative veto as essential to controlling the executive branch, and should therefore be undertaken with caution. However, Congress&#x27;s action in this case is nonetheless unconstitutional. Contrary to the views of the majority, Congress&#x27;s action is not legislative in character but adjudicative, and it therefore violates the principle (called the anti-aggrandizement principle) that Congress may not expand its own power into the areas of competence of the other branches. The Constitution specifically attempted to prevent this form of aggrandizement in the Bill of Attainder Clause, Art. I, § 9, cl. 3, which prohibits Congress from undertaking legislative trials that lack the safeguards and accountability of judicial trials. For a house of Congress to force the deportation of Chadha would amount to such a legislative trial.

===Dissents===
Justice White, dissenting, argued that (1) the legislative veto power is absolutely necessary to modern government, as exemplified by the legislative veto powers granted in the War Powers Act of 1973. (2) The absence of constitutional provisions for alternate methods of action does not imply their prohibition by the Constitution, and the court has consistently read the Constitution to respond to contemporary needs with flexibility. (3) The legislative veto power does not involve the ability of Congress to enact new legislation without bicameral consensus or presentation to the president, but instead involves the ability of Congress to veto suggestions by the executive, a power that both houses of Congress already possess. (4) The court has allowed Congress to delegate authority to executive agencies; lawmaking does not always require bicameralism or presentation. (5) The bicameralism and presentation provisions of the Constitution serve to ensure that no departure from the status quo takes place without consensus from both houses of Congress and the President or by a super-majority vote of both houses of Congress. In this case, the deportation of Chadha is the &quot;status quo&quot; situation, and the veto by House of Representatives of an alternative suggestion of the executive branch is reasonable given the purposes of bicameralism and the Presentment Clause.

Justice Rehnquist, in a dissent joined by White, argued that it is unlikely that Congress would have promulgated § 244(a)(1) without the corresponding provisions of §§ 244(c)(1–2). Therefore, the provisions are not severable from one another, and holding one unconstitutional requires invalidating the other.

==Aftermath==

Chadha became a citizen of the United States and was living in Albany, California, .

&quot;Chadha&quot; increased the power of the executive branch. Legislative vetoes continued to be enacted after &quot;Chadha&quot;, although various presidents have issued executive signing statements disclaiming the unconstitutional legislative veto provisions. The consultation provisions of the War Powers Act, for example, while contested by every president since Richard M. Nixon, are usually grudgingly obeyed. Some laws, such as the National Emergencies Act were amended to replace the legislative veto with a joint resolution, requiring a Presidential signature and able to be vetoed, requiring a two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to override. Joint resolutions have proven difficult to pass over a veto, and in cases where that process was chosen the power of the President has increased greatly.

Other processes, such as fast-track legislation or sunset clauses, have taken the place of the legislative veto in other laws with greater success in obtaining similar results to the original legislative vetoes. The Contract with America Advancement Act of 1996, 5 U.S.C. Sections 801-808, allowed Congress to disapprove federal agency regulations; the effect of &quot;Chadha&quot; is that any such legislative disapproval can be vetoed by the sitting President, and is not a true legislative veto. Instead, its practical use is limited to the initial days of a new President&#x27;s term following a change in Administration. Such a veto had been exercised only once, in March 2001, until 2017, when the 115th Congress under President Donald Trump passed fifteen such vetoes, overturning various rules issued under the Obama administration.

In 1984, then-Delaware senator and future President Joe Biden who served as the ranking minority member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote a scholarly article in &quot;Syracuse Law Review&quot; appraising the impact of the Supreme Court decision on how the government works. The article was added to congressional records on July 26, 1985 on request of Wendell Ford.

She has worked on &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot; (2007), &quot;Overlord&quot; (2007), &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot; (2008) and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (2013) and its follow up, &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot; (2015), among others. She is the daughter of fantasy writer Terry Pratchett.

== Career ==
Rhianna Pratchett studied journalism at the London College of Printing. Following graduation, Pratchett began writing for &quot;Minx&quot; magazine, where her first games reviews were published. She moved to the long running &quot;PC Zone&quot; magazine as an editorial assistant, staff writer, eventually becoming a section editor. She wrote for many other publications including &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

Pratchett moved into script writing and narrative design in 2002 with &quot;Beyond Divinity&quot;, produced by Larian Studios in Belgium. She also wrote a novella to accompany the game. In 2007, her work on &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot; was nominated for a BAFTA and a year later she won a Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain &#x27;Best Videogame Script&#x27; award for &quot;Overlord&quot;. Pratchett wrote the comic &quot;Tomb Raider: The Beginning&quot; with Dark Horse and the &quot;Mirror&#x27;s Edge&quot; miniseries with DC Comics, along with several of her own short stories. She has contributed to various books on games narrative including &quot;Professional Techniques for Video Game Writing&quot; and &quot;Game Writing: Narrative Skills for Videogames&quot;.

Since 2012, she has been co-director of Narrativia Limited, a production company which holds exclusive multimedia and merchandising rights to her father Terry Pratchett&#x27;s works following his death. In 2012 and 2013, Narrativia announced that it would be working on three television projects based on Pratchett&#x27;s father&#x27;s works: &quot;The Watch&quot;, &quot;Good Omens&quot;, and &quot;Wee Free Men&quot;, as well as several other projects; Pratchett was reported as co-writer of &quot;The Watch&quot; but in 2019 she announced she had not been involved in the project &quot;for many years&quot;. In a deal announced in April 2020, multiple &quot;Discworld&quot; novels are to be adapted for television by Narrativia, Motive Pictures and Endeavor Content.

She has also spoken on BBC Radio 1, Radio 4, 5Live and multiple conferences around the world, including Develop, Animex, GDC and TEDx Transmedia. In June 2015, she said that her father&#x27;s 41st Discworld novel &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Crown&quot;, to be published posthumously later that year, would mark the end of the series, and that no further novels or books of unfinished work would be authorised for publication.

In 2023, Pratchett hosted her first radio programme, &quot;Mythical Creatures&quot;, a ten-part documentary series for BBC Radio 4 about creatures from British folklore. It was first broadcast from 18–29 December 2023.

<text>The Harvard International Review (HIR) is a quarterly international relations journal published by the Harvard International Relations Council at Harvard University. The &quot;HIR&quot; offers commentary on global developments in politics, economics, business, science, technology, and culture, as well as interviews with global leaders.

==Structure==
The magazine features quarterly cover topics, broad surveys of developments in international relations (collectively referred to as the Global Notebook), outside perspectives, and interviews. Cover topics in recent years have included analyses of the role agriculture plays in international development, the erosion of trust in modern institutions, and the trade-offs between compromise and defiance. 

Various boards within the &quot;HIR&quot; also work to copy-edit articles, design the print magazine, connect with new subscribers and advertisers, and maintain the magazine&#x27;s website and social media presence. The &quot;HIR&quot;&#x27;s website features exclusive content and active blogs on current events. In all, the magazine has a growing readership of over 200,000.

==History==
The &quot;HIR&quot; was founded in 1979 by a group of undergraduate students in the Harvard International Relations Council, allowing students to analyze foreign affairs in an academic and journalistic forum. After monthly publication early on, the &quot;HIR&quot; pivoted to quarterly distribution, and began soliciting the perspectives of prominent figures in international relations.

To date, the magazine has featured articles or interviews from over 40 presidents and prime ministers, four UN Secretaries-General, four Nobel Economics Prize laureates, and seven Nobel Peace Prize laureates.

==Notable alumni==
Notable Harvard alumni to have been staff members of the &quot;Harvard International Review&quot; include Philip A. Brimmer, Erik Brynjolfsson, Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty, Bernard Hebda, Stephen A. Higginson, Ambassador Philip S. Kosnett, David Laibson, &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer Jeff Martin, Robert McCord, Marc Rotenberg, Phillip Steck, John Weston, and M. Edward Whelan III.

<text>International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs. It was established in 1947 and is published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the International Organization Foundation. The editors-in-chief are Brett Ashley Leeds and Layna Mosley.

&quot;International Organization&quot; is considered the leading journal in the field of international relations, and one of the top journals in political science. In a 2005 survey of international relations scholars on &quot;which journals publish articles that have the greatest impact&quot; in their field, about 70% included &quot;International Organization&quot; among the 4 &quot;top journals&quot;, ranking it first among 28 journals. According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has a 2022 impact factor of 7.8, ranking it 3rd out of 187 journals in the category &quot;Political Science&quot; and 1st out of 96 journals in the category &quot;International Relations&quot;.

The journal was founded in 1947 by the World Peace Foundation, a philanthropic institution. In its early years, the journal focused on the United Nations, but expanded its scope over time to become a general international relations journal. The journal has been credited with helping to establish the subfield of international political economy within international relations. Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, who joined the journal in 1968, played an important role in steering the journal from scholarship focused on the UN to generalist scholarship in international relations. Keohane and Nye broadened the definition of institution so that it did not exclusively refer to formal organizations. In the 1990s, the journal played an important role in expanding the theoretical pluralism of international relations scholarship, bringing prominence to social theories (such as rational choice and constructivism) alongside the traditional realist and liberal theoretical frameworks.

Keohane was editor of the journal from 1972 to 1980. Peter J. Katzenstein was editor of the journal from 1980 to 1986. Stephen D. Krasner was editor of the journal from 1986 to 1991. Lisa Martin was the first female editor of the journal from 2001 to 2006. The journal has been a flagship journal of international relations since the mid-1970s.

<text>U.S. Route 1/9 Truck (US 1/9 Truck) is a United States Numbered Highway in the northern part of New Jersey that stretches from the eastern edge of Newark to the Tonnele Circle in Jersey City. It is the alternate route for US 1/9 that trucks must use because they are prohibited from using the Pulaski Skyway, which carries the main routes of US 1/9. It also serves traffic accessing the New Jersey Turnpike, Route 440, and Route 7. The route is a four- to six-lane road its entire length, with portions of it being a divided highway that runs through urban areas. From its south end to about halfway through Kearny, US 1/9 Truck is a freeway, with access to other roads controlled by interchanges.

While the US 1/9 Truck designation was first used in 1953, the roadway comprising the route was originally designated as an extension of Route 1 in 1922, a route that in its full length stretched from Trenton to Jersey City. US 1/9 was designated along the road in 1926, and, one year later, in 1927, this portion of Route 1 was replaced with Route 25 as well as with a portion of Route 1 north of the Communipaw Avenue intersection. Following the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US 1/9 and Route 25 were realigned to the new skyway. After trucks were banned from the skyway in 1934, the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was designated as Route 25T. In 1953, US 1/9 Truck was designated in favor of Route 25T and Route 1 along this segment of road. The portion of the truck route north of Route 7 was rebuilt as part of a $271.9-million (equivalent to $ in ) project to construct new approach roads to connect US 1/9 Truck, Route 7, the Pulaski Skyway, Route 139, and US 1/9 north of the Tonnele Circle and local streets in Jersey City. Construction, which started in late 2008, was completed in late 2012.

The highway is posted on reassurance shields as a north–south route. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) Straight Line Diagram, however, lists it as an east–west route and recently updated mileposts depict this alignment, with west direction signed for southbound traffic and east for northbound traffic.

==Route description==

US 1/9 Truck begins at an interchange with access to and from the southbound direction US 1/9, the Pulaski Skyway, in the Ironbound section of the city of Newark in Essex County. The truck route is meant to bypass the portion of US 1/9 along the Pulaski Skyway, which trucks are restricted from. It merges onto Raymond Boulevard, which continues west from the US 1/9 and US 1/9 Truck interchange into Downtown Newark. The truck restriction on US 1/9 is for the &quot;safety and welfare of the public&quot; according to NJDOT, not a specific bridge defect. At this point, the truck route becomes a four-lane freeway, heading to the east. A short distance later, the road comes to an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95, or I-95) and Doremus Avenue before crossing over the Passaic River on a vertical lift bridge. Here, the route enters Kearny in Hudson County and continues east into industrial areas as the Lincoln Highway. The road has a right-in/right-out in both directions that provides access to Jacobus Avenue before it comes to an interchange with County Route 659 (CR 659). From here, US 1/9 Truck passes under a Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CSAO) railroad line and becomes a six-lane expressway, coming to an at-grade intersection with Hackensack Avenue. Past this intersection, the road crosses the Hackensack River on a vertical lift bridge and enters Jersey City. Upon entering Jersey City, the road becomes Communipaw Avenue and intersects the northern terminus of Route 440 near the Hudson Mall.
At this intersection, Communipaw Avenue continues to the east toward Communipaw and US 1/9 Truck turns to the north, becoming an unnamed four-lane undivided road and bisecting Lincoln Park before coming to an intersection with CR 605. Here, the road becomes a four-lane divided highway again, passing some urban business areas before running between wetlands to the west and Holy Name Cemetery to the east. The route heads into more commercial areas again before passing urban residences, coming to an intersection that provides access to the Pulaski Skyway. Here, US 1/9 Truck turns east on Broadway, running through a business district. A short distance later, it turns north onto an unnamed road with CR 642 continuing east on Broadway. The route passes under PATH&#x27;s Newark–World Trade Center line and CSAO&#x27;s Northern Branch line before crossing under the Pulaski Skyway. Immediately after, US 1/9 Truck intersects the eastern terminus of Route 7 and turns to the east, with CR 645 continuing north at this intersection. The truck route becomes a four-lane divided highway called the St. Paul&#x27;s Viaduct that runs to the north of the Pulaski Skyway and passes through industrial sectors, crossing over the Northern Branch line and CR 646. A short distance later, US 1/9 Truck comes to the Tonnele Circle with US 1/9 and Route 139, where it ends.

The East Coast Greenway runs along the north side of the highway.

==History==
What is now US 1/9 Truck between Newark and Jersey City was originally chartered as part of Ferry Road by the New Jersey Colonial legislature in 1765. The road stretched from Newark to Jersey City along Ferry Street, US 1/9 Truck, Communipaw Avenue, and Grand Street. The Passaic and Hackensack Ferry and Road Company took over maintenance in 1828, followed by the Newark Plank Road and Ferry in 1849 (not to be confused with the similarly named Newark Plank Road). Though the company&#x27;s contract was to be extended for 50 years in 1900, this was overturned by the Supreme Court of New Jersey. 

In 1913, the road west of Lincoln Park became the first segment of the Lincoln Highway. The current route of US 1/9 Truck was designated to be an extension of Route 1 in 1922, a route that was to run from Trenton to Jersey City.
When the U.S. Numbered Highway System was established in 1926, the current truck route became a part of the US 1/9 concurrency. A year later, in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 25 was designated to run along the entire length of the route along with US 1/9 as part of its journey from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Camden to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City, while Route 1 was also designated along the portion north of Communipaw Avenue in Jersey City as a part of its routing from Bayonne to Rockleigh.

Following the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932, US 1/9 and Route 25 were moved to the new bridge. After trucks were banned from the Pulaski Skyway in 1934, the portion of Route 25 between Newark and Route 1 was designated as Route 25T. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, US 1/9 Truck was designated to replace all of Route 25T as well as the portion of Route 1 between Route 25T and the Tonnele Circle.

Beginning in 2009, NJDOT replaced the viaduct that carries the route over St. Paul&#x27;s Avenue and a CSAO line. The St. Paul&#x27;s Viaduct was built in 1928 and determined structurally deficient. The $271.9-million (equivalent to $ in ) replacement was completed in September 2011. In addition to replacing the St. Paul&#x27;s Avenue viaduct, the approaches to US 1/9 Truck between Route 7 and the Tonnele Circle were improved in preparation for the construction of the Replacement Wittpen bridge.

In 2021, with the opening of the new Wittpenn Bridge, the former intersection with Route 7 and US 1/9 was demolished, and the former overpass that originally bypassed the intersection was rerouted to the bridge instead. A replacement ramp to reallow traffic onto Newark Avenue after the ability to do so was removed at the intersection was opened on April 21, 2023, at 9:00 pm.

Studies are being conducted to make the intersection with Route 440 a multilevel traffic circle and to make the northern and southern (Route 440) approaches into a multi-use urban boulevard that includes grade separations and additional medians. The studies are in anticipation of a general increase of activity in Port of New York and New Jersey, as well as new development in West Side, Jersey City, and Hackensack River Greenway.

<doc id="1275059" wikidata="Q7932073" url="?curid=1275059" title="Vincent T. DeVita">
<text>Vincent Theodore DeVita Jr. (born March 7, 1935) is the Amy and Joseph Perella Professor of Medicine at Yale Cancer Center, and a Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health. He directed the Yale Cancer Center from 1993 to 2003. He has been president of the board of directors of the American Cancer Society (2012-2013). He is internationally recognized as a pioneer in the field of oncology for his work on combination-chemotherapy treatments.
==Early life and education==
Vincent DeVita was born in The Bronx, New York.

DeVita attended the College of William &amp; Mary, receiving his Bachelor of Science degree in 1957. In 1961 he earned his MD degree with distinction from the George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences.

==Career==
DeVita joined the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 1963 as a clinical fellow, working with Emil &quot;Tom&quot; Frei, Emil J. Freireich and others. He returned as a senior investigator in 1966 after completing his training at Yale-New Haven Medical Center in 1965.
At NCI, DeVita held the following posts: Senior Investigator in the Solid Tumor Service, Head of the Solid Tumor Service, Chief of the Medicine Branch, Director of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Clinical Director of NCI (as of 1975).

While at NCI, he helped to develop MOPP, a four-drug combination that was the first successful combination chemotherapy program. At the time, many oncologists believed such an approach was too toxic and would do more harm than good. MOPP was used to treat Hodgkin&#x27;s disease and diffuse large cell lymphomas, reducing the likelihood of dying from Hodgkin&#x27;s disease from nearly 100% to around 30%. DeVita&#x27;s results, presented in 1965 and 1970 were initially viewed with considerable disbelief.
By demonstrating that a combination-chemotherapy regimen could be successful, DeVita established the basis for further combination therapies, which became a mainstay of cancer treatment.
In addition, in collaboration with George Canellos, DeVita developed the combination chemotherapy CMF, which still remains a useful therapy for breast cancer.

From 1977 to 1978, DeVita was the president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).

In 1980, DeVita was appointed Director of the NCI and the National Cancer Program by President Jimmy Carter, a position he held until 1988.

From January 1989 to 1993, DeVita was Physician-in-Chief and Attending Physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center where he was part of the program for Molecular Pharmacology.

In 1993 he returned to Yale, where he became Director of Yale Cancer Center, serving from 1993 to 2003. In 2004, he was named as the Amy and Joseph Perella Professor of Medicine at Yale University, a position to be renamed the Vincent T. DeVita Professor of Medicine after his tenure. He is currently the chair of the Yale Cancer Center advisory board and is professor of internal medicine and of epidemiology and public health at Yale&#x27;s medical school.

From 2012-2013, DeVita served as president of the board of directors of the American Cancer Society. 
DeVita currently serves on the editorial boards of numerous scientific journals and has authored over 450 scientific articles. He is a co-editor of the textbook &quot;Cancer: Principles and Practice of Oncology&quot;, in its 10th edition, and serves as the co-editor-in-chief of &quot;The Cancer Journal&quot;.

He is also the co-author, with his daughter Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn, of the autobiographical book, &quot;The Death of Cancer: After Fifty Years on the Front Lines of Medicine, a Pioneering Oncologist Reveals Why the War on Cancer Is Winnable—and How We Can Get There&quot;.

He was a participant in Ken Burns&#x27; 2015 PBS documentary &quot;Cancer: The Emperor of All Maladies&quot;,
which was based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Siddhartha Mukherjee.

== Personal life ==
DeVita married Mary Kay Bush, with whom he had two children, Ted and Elizabeth. DeVita diagnosed his son Ted&#x27;s aplastic anemia. Ted thereafter was placed in a sterile environment for his safety and died in 1980.

Ted&#x27;s situation, and that of David Vetter, inspired the 1976 TV movie &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot; starring John Travolta. Elizabeth has written about the experience of losing her brother in &quot;The Empty Room&quot;. 

DeVita has been treated for prostate cancer.

<text>Spanish West Africa (, AOE) was a grouping of Spanish colonies along the Atlantic coast of northwest Africa. It was formed in 1946 by joining the southern zone (the Cape Juby Strip) of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco with the colonies of Ifni, Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro into a single administrative unit. Following the Ifni War (1957–58), Spain ceded the Cape Juby Strip to Morocco by the Treaty of Angra de Cintra, and created separate provinces for Ifni and the Sahara in 1958.

Spanish West Africa was formed by a decree of 20 July 1946. The new governor sat at Ifni. He was &quot;ex officio&quot; the delegate of the Spanish high commissioner in Morocco in the southern zone of the protectorate, to facilitate its government along the same lines as the other Spanish possessions on the coast. On 12 July 1947, Ifni and the Sahara were raised into distinct entities, but still under the authority of the governor in Ifni. On 10 and 14 January 1958, respectively, the Sahara and Ifni were raised into regular Spanish overseas provinces completely independent of one another.

<text>Burrows is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created by redistribution in 1957 from part of Winnipeg North, and formally came into existence in the provincial election of 1958. The riding is located in the northern part of Winnipeg.

Burrows is named after Theodore Arthur Burrows, who served as Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba from 1926 to 1929. It is bordered to the east by St. Johns and Point Douglas, to the south by Wellington, to the north by Kildonan and The Maples, and to the west by Tyndall Park. The riding&#x27;s boundaries were significantly redrawn in 1999, taking in a considerable amount of territory which was previously a part of the now-defunct Inkster.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 18,718. In 1999, the average family income was $35,575, one of the lowest rates in the province. Thirty-nine per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are listed as low-income, with an unemployment rate of 13%. One household in four has only one parent. Nineteen per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are over sixty-five years of age.

The total immigrant population in Burrows is 21%, with almost one in three residents speaking a first language other than English or French. The Aboriginal population is 15%.

Manufacturing accounts for 22% of Burrows&#x27; industry, with a further 15% in the service sector.

The CCF and its successor the NDP have won Burrows on all but three occasions since the riding was created, with the Liberals winning the other three elections.

<doc id="1275080" wikidata="Q74648" url="?curid=1275080" title="White-tailed rat">
<text>The white-tailed rat (Mystromys albicaudatus) also known as the white-tailed mouse, is the only member of the subfamily Mystromyinae in the family Nesomyidae. This species is sometimes placed in the subfamily Cricetinae due to similarities in appearance between the white-tailed rat and hamsters, but molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed that the two groups are not closely related. The subfamily Mystromyinae is sometimes placed within the family Muridae along with all other subfamilies of muroids.

The white-tailed rat is restricted to shrubby areas and grasslands of South Africa and Lesotho. This is an uncommon species, and populations are thought to be declining because of conversion of scrubland to pasture. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being an &quot;endangered species&quot;.

==Description==
The white-tailed rat is a fairly large species with a head-and-body length of for males and for females, with a short tail of about . The fur is soft, woolly and dense. The head is broad, and the face is mostly grey, with pale spots above the eye and behind the ear in some individuals. The whiskers are long and the ear is rounded and dark-coloured. The upper parts of head and body are greyish-brown flecked with buff; each hair has a grey base and shaft, and a buff or blackish tip. The underparts are whitish-grey, each individual hair having a grey base and shaft and a cream or whitish tip. The tail is colourless and is clad in short white fur. The fore feet have four digits and the hind feet five. The upper surfaces of the fore feet have white hair, as do the sides and upper surfaces of the hind feet.

==Distribution and habitat==
The white-tailed rat is endemic to South Africa and Lesotho where it is found in grasslands and shrubby areas. It tends to inhabit burrows of meerkats and cracks in the soil during the day and venture out at night. It eats vegetable matter such as seeds and has been known to take insects. The stomach has a ruminant-like digestive action and there are bacteria in the hind gut that ferment the food. Unlike hamsters, white-tailed rats do not have cheek pouches.

<doc id="1275091" wikidata="Q336901" url="?curid=1275091" title="Antonio Cánovas del Castillo">
<text>Antonio Cánovas del Castillo (8 February 18288 August 1897) was a Spanish politician and historian known principally for serving six terms as prime minister and his overarching role as &quot;architect&quot; of the regime that ensued with the 1874 restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. He was assassinated by Italian anarchist Michele Angiolillo.

As leader of the Liberal-Conservative Party—also known more simply as the Conservative Party—the name of Cánovas became symbolic of the alternate succession in the Restoration regime along with Práxedes Mateo Sagasta&#x27;s.

==Early career==

Born in Málaga as the son of Antonio Cánovas García and Juana del Castillo y Estébanez, Cánovas moved to Madrid after the death of his father where he lived with his mother&#x27;s cousin, the writer Serafín Estébanez Calderón. Although he studied law at the University of Madrid, he showed an early interest in politics and Spanish history. His active involvement in politics dates to the 1854 revolution, led by General Leopoldo O&#x27;Donnell, when he drafted the Manifesto of Manzanares, which accompanied the military overthrow of the sitting government, laid out the political goals of the movement, and played a critical role as it attracted the masses&#x27; support when the coup seemed to fail. During the final years of Isabel II, he served in a number of posts, including a diplomatic mission to Rome, governor of Cádiz, and director general of local administration. That period of his political career culminated in his being twice made a government minister, first taking the interior portfolio in 1864 and then the overseas territories portfolio in 1865 to 1866. After the 1868 Glorious Revolution (Revolución Gloriosa), he retired from the government, but he was a strong supporter of the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy during the First Spanish Republic (1873–1874) and as the leader of the conservative minority in the Cortes, he declaimed against universal suffrage and freedom of religion. He also drafted the Manifesto of Sandhurst and prevailed upon Alfonso XII to issue it, just as he had done years previously with O&#x27;Donnell.

==Prime minister==
Cánovas returned to active politics with the 1874 overthrow of the Republic by General Martínez Campos and the elevation of Isabell II&#x27;s son Alfonso XII to the throne. He served as Prime Minister (&quot;Primer presidente del Consejo de Ministros&quot;) for six years starting in 1874 (although he was twice briefly replaced in 1875 and 1879). He was a principal author of the Spanish Constitution of 1876, which formalised the constitutional monarchy that had resulted from the restoration of Alfonso and limited suffrage to reduce the political influence of the working class and assuage the voting support from the wealthy minority becoming the protected status quo.

Cánovas del Castillo played a key role in bringing an end to the last Carlist threat to Bourbon authority (1876) by merging a group of dissident Carlist deputies with his own Conservative party. More significantly, his term in office saw the victory achieved by the governmental Spanish troops in the Third Carlist War, the occupation of the Basque territory and the decree establishing an end to the centuries-long Basque specific status (July 1876) that resulted in its annexation to a centralist Spain. Against a backdrop of martial law imposed across the Basque Provinces (and possibly Navarre), heated negotiations with Liberal Basque high-ranking officials led to the establishment of the first Basque Economic Agreement (1878).

An artificial two-party system designed to reconcile the competing militarist, Catholic and Carlist power bases led to an alternating prime ministership (known as the &quot;turno pacifico&quot;) with the progressive Práxedes Mateo Sagasta after 1881. He also assumed the functions of the head of state during the regency of María Cristina after Alfonso&#x27;s death in 1885.

==Political crisis==

By the late 1880s, Cánovas&#x27; policies were under threat from two sources. First, his overseas policy was increasingly untenable. A policy of repression against Cuban nationalists was ultimately ineffective and Spain&#x27;s authority was challenged most seriously by the 1895 rebellion led by José Martí. Spain&#x27;s policy against Cuban independence brought her increasingly into conflict with the United States, an antagonism that culminated in the Spanish–American War of 1898. Second, the political repression of Spain&#x27;s working class was growing increasingly troublesome, and pressure for expanded suffrage mounted amid widespread discontent with the &quot;cacique&quot; system of electoral manipulation.

Cánovas&#x27; policies included mass arrests and a policy of torture:
During a religious procession in 1896, at Barcelona, a bomb was thrown. Immediately three hundred men and women were arrested. Some were Anarchists, but the majority were trade unionists and Socialists. They were thrown into the notorious prison at the fortress of Montjuïc in Barcelona and tortured. After a number had been killed, or had gone insane, their cases were taken up by the liberal press of Europe, resulting in the release of a few survivors.

Reputedly it was Cánovas del Castillo who ordered the torture, including the burning of the victims&#x27; flesh, the crushing of their bones, and the cutting out of their tongues. Similar acts of brutality and barbarism had occurred during his regime in Cuba, and Canovas remained deaf to the appeals and protests of civilized conscience.

His attempts to stabilize Spain&#x27;s parliamentary system achieved a measure of success until World War I in which Spain was not spared the disturbances that ravaged much of the European continent. According to some views, his regime was a welcomed change from Spanish liberalism, considered by some to deny equal participation to political rivals. The restored parliamentary monarchy recognized the principle of allowing rival political opponents within the framework of a constitution. Yet, it would be decades before universal male suffrage and other typical characteristics of modern democratic systems were implemented; it was still very much an electoral system dominated by parties of established local elites.

==Man of letters==
At the same time, Cánovas remained an active man of letters. His historical writings earned him a considerable reputation, particularly his &quot;History of the Decline of Spain&quot; (Historia de la decadencia de España) for which he was elected at the young age of 32 to the Real Academia de la Historia in 1860. That was followed by elevation to other bodies of letters, including the in 1867, the Academia de Ciencias Morales y Políticas in 1871 and the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in 1887. He also served as the head of the Athenaeum in Madrid (1870–74, 1882–84 and 1888–89).

== Assassination ==
In 1897, he was shot dead by Michele Angiolillo, an Italian anarchist, at the spa &quot;Santa Águeda&quot;, in Mondragón, Guipúzcoa. Angiolillo invoked vengeance on Canovas on behalf of the execution of Jose Rizal and other Barcelona anarchists. He thus did not live to see Spain&#x27;s loss of her final colonies to the United States after the Spanish–American War.

== Personal life ==
He married María de la Concepción Espinosa de los Monteros y Rodrigo de Villamayor on 20 October 1860; he was widowed on 3 September 1863. He married Joaquina de Osma y Zavala on 14 November 1887. No progeny survived him.

== Ideology and thought ==

Cánovas was the chief architect of the Restoration regime, that strived for bringing stability to the Spanish society. It has been emphasized that the two figures most influential to his political ideas were Edmund Burke (from whom he derived a brand of traditionalism with a historicist rather than religious matrix) and Joaquín Francisco Pacheco. Cánovas embraced an essentialist, metaphysical and providentialist conception of the nation. A staunch opponent to universal suffrage, he held the view that &quot;universal suffrage begets socialism in a natural, necessary and inevitable way&quot;.

A supporter of slavery, he declared in November 1896 in a press interview: &quot;Blacks in Cuba are free; they can enter into contracts, work or not work, and I think that slavery was much better than this freedom which they only took advantage of to do nothing and form masses of unemployed. Anyone who knows the blacks will tell you that in Madagascar, the Congo, as in Cuba, they are lazy, savage, prone to misbehavior, and that you have to lead them with authority and firmness to get anything out of them. These savages have no owner other than their own instincts, their primitive appetites&quot;.

In reference to his political and intellectual stature, Cánovas was nicknamed as &quot;el Monstruo&quot; (&quot;The Monster&quot;) by his peers.

==Legacy==
The policies of repression and political manipulation that Cánovas made a cornerstone of his government helped foster the nationalist movements in both Catalonia and the Basque provinces and set the stage for labour unrest during the first two decades of the 20th century. The disastrous colonial policy not only led to the loss of Spain&#x27;s remaining colonial possessions in the Pacific and Caribbean but also seriously weakened the government at home. A failed postwar coup by Camilo de Polavieja set off a long period of political instability, which ultimately led to the collapse of the monarchy and the dissolution of the constitution that Cánovas had authored.

His white marble mausoleum was carved by Agustí Querol Subirats at the Pantheon of Illustrious Men, in Madrid.

<text>Dustan Kyle Mohr (born June 19, 1975) is an American former Major League Baseball outfielder who played for several teams between 2001 and 2007.

==Amateur career==
A native of Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Mohr attended Oak Grove High School and the University of Alabama. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Mohr was selected by the Cleveland Indians in the ninth round of the 1997 MLB Draft. 

==Professional career==
After spending three seasons in the Indians&#x27; minor league system, Mohr was released and signed with the Minnesota Twins as a free agent in 2000. Starting midway through the season, the Twins used a platoon of Mohr and Bobby Kielty in right field. This platoon persisted on and off for two years. Twins fans were so accustomed to seeing one or the other player in right field that broadcasters Bert Blyleven and Dick Bremer dubbed the duo &quot;Dusty Kielmohr&quot;.

After four seasons in the Twins organization, Mohr was traded to the San Francisco Giants before the season. Mohr struggled during the first few months before catching fire in early June. His aggressive defense and clutch hitting made him a favorite among Giants fans.

The Giants closed in on the division leading Los Angeles Dodgers in the last month of the season. In the second to last series of the season, against the San Diego Padres, Mohr was injured as he tracked down a foul ball in right field. He tripped over the bullpen mound as the ball tailed towards the stands. He held on to the ball, and the Padres scored the game&#x27;s winning run. He did not play during the season&#x27;s final series against the Dodgers.

As a member of the Boston Red Sox, Dustan Mohr filled in occasionally in outfield, either replacing Trot Nixon or Coco Crisp. While Crisp was out, Mohr had a spot on the major league roster, but he struggled with the big league club hitting: .175 with 2 home runs and 3 RBI. His stint with the Red Sox was short as Mohr was demoted to the Pawtucket Red Sox where he continued to struggle at the plate. He finished the season as a member of the Detroit Tigers playing for their Triple-A affiliate, the Toledo Mud Hens.

In , Mohr signed a minor league contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and was called up on June 23, but was released a month later .

Mohr signed with the Wichita Wingnuts of the American Association for the season., but signed with the Colorado Rockies on May 27, 2008. On June 23, the Rockies released Mohr. In January , he re-signed with the Wingnuts.

He played with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League in 2010.

==Personal life==
In 2009, he moved to Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he was an assistant baseball coach at Northrop High School for five years until 2021 and became an instructor at a local softball and baseball training facility. 

He divorced in 2012.

Mohr was arrested in Fort Wayne on August 9, 2023, and charged with several child sex crimes for alleged interactions with a 14-year-old girl he was instructing during the first six months of 2023. In March 2024 he pleaded guilty to child solicitation, child seduction and sexual misconduct with a minor, and was sentenced on April 26, 2024 to nine years in the Indiana State Prison system, and was ordered to pay $13,300.00 to two people.

<doc id="1275106" wikidata="Q4647456" url="?curid=1275106" title="A. A. Allen">
<text>Asa Alonso Allen (March 27, 1911 – June 11, 1970), better known as A. A. Allen, was an American Pentecostal evangelist known for his faith healing and deliverance ministry. He was, for a time, associated with the &quot;Voice of Healing&quot; movement founded by Gordon Lindsay. Allen died at the age of 59 in San Francisco, California, and was buried at his ministry headquarters in Miracle Valley, Arizona.

== Early life ==
A. A. Allen&#x27;s early life was lived in an often unpleasant environment. Having been born of mixed race to white and Native American parents, his family was very poor and his father was an alcoholic.

At the age of 23, Allen became a Christian at the Onward Methodist Church in Miller, Missouri. Later, he learned of the Baptism with the Holy Spirit from a Pentecostal preacher who was conducting meetings in his home. Allen soon felt the call to preach and affiliated himself with the Assemblies of God, subsequently obtaining ordination from them in 1936. He then began to pastor a small church in Colorado. By 1947, Allen was pastoring a large Assemblies of God church in Corpus Christi, Texas.

After attending a tent revival meeting hosted by Oral Roberts in 1949, Allen testified that as he left that meeting he hoped to form a divine healing ministry. Allen asked his church board to allow him to start a radio program, but they refused. Allen soon resigned from his church and began holding healing revival meetings.

== Revivalist ==
Stemming in part from many reported healings, Allen established a large following. He became one of the first ministers to develop a national television ministry, which frequently included excerpts from his &quot;healing line&quot; ministry. By the late 1960s, however, music formed an increasingly dominant part of Allen&#x27;s programs, which was generally performed by African-American singer and choir leader Gene Martin.

In 1955, Allen purchased a large tent for $8,500. He was soon one of the major healing evangelists on the healing revival circuit. Allen&#x27;s revival meetings were similar to the other leading evangelists of the time (such as Roberts, Jack Coe, and William Branham) in that meetings were typically characterized by preaching, testimony, music, and praying for the sick. As was the case with other ministers of the time, Allen&#x27;s healing ministry was facilitated by the use of &quot;prayer cards&quot; obtained in advance by those requesting prayer for healing.

In 1955, Allen was arrested for suspicion of drunk driving after a controversial incident in Knoxville, Tennessee. He resigned from the Assemblies of God shortly afterward. After paying a fine without contest in order to avoid terminating his Knoxville meetings which were then in progress, Allen was re-ordained by his &quot;Miracle Revival Fellowship.&quot; His associate Don Stewart claimed that Allen was occasionally drunk after Knoxville, and that his staff covered for him.

Allen continued on the revival circuit, and in 1958 he purchased a tent previously used by Coe that could seat over 22,000. He became one of the first evangelists to propagate the prosperity gospel, calling poverty a &quot;spirit&quot; and expounding God&#x27;s ability to perform miracles financially. At his peak, Allen appeared on fifty-eight radio stations daily, as well as forty-three television stations. At the time of his death, his headquarters in Miracle Valley, Arizona was with its own airfield.

At that time, A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. was publishing &quot;well over&quot; 60 million pieces of literature a year. The circulation of &quot;Miracle Magazine&quot;, published monthly by the Allen ministry, was 450,000 at the time of his death. The magazine included, at times, accounts of healings, but gave a disclaimer that the magazine does not &quot;assume legal responsibility&quot; of its accuracy. Gerald W. King, the business manager of Miracle Valley, was quoted in 1969, shortly before Allen&#x27;s death, as saying, &quot;We take in $2 million a year, and our expenses are $2 million a year.&quot; He added that Miracle Valley&#x27;s annual payroll was $84,000.

Few of Allen&#x27;s supposed miracles ever underwent &quot;scrutiny of physicians&quot; and at his revivals in small print his disclaimer read: &quot;A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. assumes no legal responsibility for the veracity of any such report.&quot; One source, &quot;The Encyclopedia of American Religions&quot;, claims that Allen did not like press coverage, which &quot;resulted in his hiring of &#x27;goon squads&#x27; to punch out anyone who showed up for Allen&#x27;s tent revivals with a notepad or camera.&quot;

Eventually, most of the evangelists had wheelchairs available for people who had bad backs and couldn&#x27;t stand in a healing line for hours. But when the evangelist got to them and pulled them up out of the wheelchair, some in the audience thought they were walking for the first time or that they had come to the revival in that wheelchair.

In his television programs, Allen or his ministry associates made frequent mention of the fact that his meetings were racially integrated. African-Americans sat alongside whites in the choir, the ministers&#x27; section, and the congregation. African-American musical talent was frequently highlighted in Allen&#x27;s television programs, especially in the 1960s. This racial attitude also found its expression in Allen&#x27;s sermon record album titled, &quot;Did God Call the Apostle Paul to Preach the Gospel to the Black Man?&quot; The album cover refers to Allen as &quot;no doubt the first evangelist on a great national or international scale to preach integration to huge crowds in the North and the South...&quot; This was something of an exaggeration, though perhaps in keeping with Allen&#x27;s personality. Mainstream revivalist Billy Graham, while not always consistent, had desegregated many of his revivals as early as 1953 in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and integrated all his revivals following the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision in 1954.

Another major theme in Allen&#x27;s ministry was his unrelenting attacks on what he characterized as dead, formal, denominational religion. This was a theme of a number of his televised messages and of such Miracle Valley publications as Allen&#x27;s book titled &quot;Let My People Go!&quot; This was also the theme of a book authored by Clarence G. Mitchell and published by Allen&#x27;s ministry, titled &quot;Starving Sheep and Overfed Shepherds&quot; (1963). Allen regarded &quot;denominationalism&quot; as a sin. This is reflected in the subtitle of Mitchell&#x27;s book: &quot;Takes the Cover Off! Brings the Sin of Denominationalism Out into the Open!&quot;

At a revival meeting on January 1, 1958, in Phoenix, Arizona, recent convert Urbane Leiendecker approached Allen and offered him of land. This property, later expanded, was then named &quot;Miracle Valley.&quot; As such, it served as the ministry headquarters for A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. This location housed Miracle Valley Bible College and its dorms and classrooms; a domed church; administrative buildings; a large warehouse; a residential neighborhood called Miracle Valley Estates; a publishing and printing plant; a four-press phonograph record plant; and Miracle Valley Fellowship, which served as a ministerial fellowship with about 10,000 ministers as members. In spite of the presence of its own print shop, however, Miracle Valley business manager Gerald King said in 1969 that the ministry spent $27,000 per month &quot;farming out&quot; jobs to other print shops that could not be handled on site.

In 1963, A. A. Allen Revivals, Inc. successfully sued the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in an attempt to get the government to refund collections of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes for 1958–59.

In 1967, Allen and his wife, Lexie E. (Scriven) Allen, were divorced. They had four children. One of them, Paul Asa Allen, is the author of &quot;In the Shadow of Greatness – Growing Up Allen&quot;.

== Death ==
Allen died at the Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco, California, on June 11, 1970, at the age of 59. He died after a heavy drinking binge. Don Stewart, his successor, was accused of attempting &quot;to clean up evidence of his mentor&#x27;s alcoholic binge in a San Francisco hotel before the police arrived&quot;. Stewart says he was not trying to cover up anything but was trying to protect Allen. Nonetheless, police found his body in a &quot;room strewn with pills and empty liquor bottles&quot;.

However, following a twelve-day investigation and an autopsy, the coroner&#x27;s report concluded Allen died from liver failure brought on by acute alcoholism. The coroner reported that when Allen died, he had a blood alcohol content of .36 which was &quot;enough to ensure a deep coma&quot;.

Stewart says that Allen&#x27;s problems with alcohol followed his problems with depression associated with extreme pain from arthritic bone spurs for which he was reluctant to seek medical attention because of his faith in divine healing and preaching that relying on doctors was a failure to trust in God.

In 2022, Allen&#x27;s granddaughter, Cheryl Bryan made a claim that the coroner&#x27;s report had in fact been falsified.

Allen was buried at Miracle Valley, Arizona, on June 15, 1970.

== Legacy and property ==
After Allen&#x27;s death, Stewart gained possession of Allen&#x27;s organization, including his Miracle Valley property, which he renamed the Don Stewart Evangelistic Association (and later the Don Stewart Association). Stewart &quot;went from pounding tent stakes at Allen&#x27;s revivals to driving a truck to preaching&quot;. In addition, Stewart &quot;was hit with allegations of embezzlement by Allen&#x27;s brother-in-law, of pocketing offerings from the revivals&quot; in the wake of Allen&#x27;s death. Nonetheless, the activities of the Don Stewart Association were moved to Phoenix, and the Bible college continued to operate in Miracle Valley until 1975. Stewart then leased the campus to the Hispanic Assemblies by a twenty-year lease agreement for merely $1 per year. They opened the Spanish-speaking Southern Arizona Bible College.

Between 1979 and early 1983, the Christ Miracle Healing Center and Church (CMHCC) operated on the subdivision property on the north side of Highway 92 across from the bible church. CMHCC, which consisted of approximately 300 African-American members, was led by Allen followers Frances Thomas and her son &quot;Bishop&quot; William Thomas Jr. Initially relations between locals and CMHCC members relocated from Mississippi – both of whom were followers of Allen – were peaceful and in keeping with Allen&#x27;s theme of racial harmony and integration; however, once the Thomases and the Chicago-based followers moved to Arizona, relations quickly deteriorated, and church members began to isolate themselves and started professing what locals said was an &quot;anti-white doctrine.&quot; CMHCC&#x27;s doctrine of exclusive use of faith healing resulted in the death of six-year-old Therial Davis, and as many as four additional children.

In 1979, Miracle Valley closed after bankruptcy hearings. In September 1982, the Southern Arizona Bible College&#x27;s main administration building and vast warehouse were destroyed by arson. The main building was valued at $2 million. Stewart sent multiple donation requests to some people on his 100,000 person mailing list &quot;even though his ministry is not associated with the college and the fire damage was insured.&quot; According to the press, one of his letters &quot;gave the impression ... the fire had crippled Stewart&#x27;s ministry&quot; and another purported to include the building&#x27;s ashes with a request for $200 donations. Stewart&#x27;s church had issues over his financing and &quot;questioned Stewart&#x27;s fundraising techniques&quot; before. In addition, Stewart was accused by his church of arson, something he denies.

The insurance company offered to either pay $1.5 million for the reconstruction of the administration building or $1 million for a &quot;cash-out.&quot; Stewart was not interested in rebuilding and intended to take the cash-out; however, the Spanish Assemblies of God (Central Latin American District Council of the Assemblies of God) wanted the facilities to be rebuilt. Subsequently, Stewart accepted the insurance money of $1 million for Miracle Valley, and the Assemblies of God would receive the Miracle Valley campus consisting of fifteen buildings and nearly of land for $6 which equated to $1 per year for the previous six years. However, Stewart forced the Assemblies of God to maintain a Bible college for a minimum of twenty years, or the property would revert to his ministry. In 1995, exactly twenty years later, the Assemblies of God closed Southern Arizona Bible College and put the campus up for sale.

In 1982, the group had several confrontations with utility workers, neighbors, and eventually law enforcement, culminating in what became known as the Miracle Valley shootout in October 1982, during which two members of the church were killed and multiple sheriff&#x27;s deputies were injured.

Miracle Valley Bible College was purchased by Harter Ministries in August 1999, and the school continued under the administration of Melvin Harter. As the Miracle Valley Bible College and Seminary, the institution taught students in classical Pentecostal theology. However, in January 2009 a Phoenix-based mortgage firm foreclosed on the property, which currently contains several dilapidated buildings. Before the previous owner left the property, the entire north section of Sanctuary roof was removed.

On December 20, 2011, the purchase of the property by the Langevin family was approved by the State of Arizona. The Langevins operate a non-denominational ministry called Miracle Valley Arizona Ministries. In 2014, another group purchased the property with plans to re-establish a Bible college.

<doc id="1275119" wikidata="Q1737962" url="?curid=1275119" title="Germ plasm">
<text>Germ plasm () is a biological concept developed in the 19th century by the German biologist August Weismann. It states that heritable information is transmitted only by germ cells in the gonads (ovaries and testes), not by somatic cells. The related idea that information cannot pass from somatic cells to the germ line, contrary to Lamarckism, is called the Weismann barrier. To some extent this theory anticipated the development of modern genetics.

==History==

The term &quot;Keimplasma&quot; (germ plasm) was first used by the German biologist, August Weismann (1834–1914), and described in his 1892 book &quot;Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung&quot; (The Germ Plasm: a theory of inheritance). His theory states that multicellular organisms consist of germ cells that contain and transmit heritable information, and somatic cells which carry out ordinary bodily functions. In the germ plasm theory, inheritance in a multicellular organism only takes place by means of the germ cells: the gametes, such as egg cells and sperm cells. Other cells of the body do not function as agents of heredity. The effect is one-way: germ cells produce somatic cells, and more germ cells; the germ cells are not affected by anything the somatic cells learn or any ability the body acquires during its life. Genetic information cannot pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation. This is referred to as the Weismann barrier. This idea, if true, rules out the inheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, like others before him, and accepted by Charles Darwin both in &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; and as part of his pangenesis theory of inheritance.

However, a careful reading of Weismann&#x27;s work over the span of his entire career shows that he had more nuanced views. He insisted, like Darwin, that a variable environment was necessary to cause variation in the hereditary material. Because genetic information cannot pass from soma to germ plasm, these external conditions, he believed, caused different effects on the soma and the germ plasm. Thus, the historian of science Rasmus G. Winther states, Weismann was not a Weismannian, as he, like Darwin, did believe in the inheritance of acquired characteristics, which later came to be known as Lamarckian.

The part of Weismann&#x27;s theory which proved most vulnerable was his notion that the germ plasm (effectively, genes) was successively reduced during division of somatic cells. As modern genetics developed, it became clear that this idea is wrong in most cases. Cases such as Dolly, the cloned sheep, proved via somatic cell nuclear transfer that adult cells retain a complete set of information – as opposed to Weismann&#x27;s increasingly determined gradual loss of genetic information – putting this aspect of Weismann&#x27;s theory to rest as a general rule of metazoan development. However, genetic information is readily lost by somatic cells in some groups of animals through somatic genome processing. The best known example is the nematodes, in which the phenomenon of chromatin diminution was first described by Theodor Boveri in 1887.

The idea was to some extent anticipated in an 1865 article by Francis Galton, published in &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, which set out a weak version of the concept. In 1889 Weismann wrote to acknowledge that &quot;You have exposed in your paper an idea which is in one essential point nearly allied to the main idea contained in my theory of the continuity of germ-plasm&quot;.

==Modern view==

The idea of the Weismann barrier, namely that changes acquired during an organism&#x27;s life cannot affect its offspring, is still broadly accepted. This has been extended into molecular terms as the central dogma of molecular biology, which asserts that information written in the form of proteins cannot be fed back into genetically transmissible information encoded in nucleic acids.

The Weismannian notion that the germ cells are unaffected by somatic cells or their environment is however proving not to be absolute. Chemical modification of the nucleotide bases that constitute the genetic code such as methylation of cytosines as well as modifications of the histones around which DNA is organized into higher-order structures are influenced by the metabolic and physiologic state of the organism and in some cases can be heritable. Such changes are called epigenetic because they do not alter the nucleotide sequence.

<text>Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble is an action puzzle video game developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color handheld video game console. It was released in Japan on August 23, 2000, and in North America on April 9, 2001. Due to the cartridge having a built-in accelerometer, it has a unique shape, as well as a unique transparent pink color in reference to Kirby. The game received an official re-release on the Nintendo Switch Online service on June 5, 2023.

== Plot ==
The game begins with Kirby napping on a cloud, when he is awakened as a Waddle Dee walks by, carrying a round pinball-like bumper. He then sees King Dedede, carrying a long bumper. Suspicious of the King&#x27;s intentions, Kirby hops on a warp star and follows him, determined to find out what he is up to. Soon, Kirby discovers that Dream Land has lost its stars and sets off to get them back.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble&quot; uses a series of accelerometers to control Kirby. The goal of the game is to guide Kirby to the level&#x27;s goal within the allotted time by tilting the Game Boy in the direction in which the player wishes to move him. The game registers a &quot;pop&quot; action when the player quickly jerks the Game Boy, rotating the game toward the user (as if flipping a pancake); doing so will fling Kirby into the air. The game revolves around the collection of the numerous stars strewn about the levels. To beat the game entirely, the player must collect each level&#x27;s red star. This will unlock the bonus worlds, where they are slightly harder versions, and players start with less time.

The timer counts down until the player has reached the level&#x27;s end. The player can increase the timer by rolling Kirby over clock tiles, stopping the roulette on the timer, picking up clocks that add ten seconds, or by passing checkpoints. When the timer drops below 50 seconds, an alarm sounds, warning the player to hurry up and finish the level, and the music that was previously playing changes to a more fast-paced version. The player starts with five lives, and will lose one if Kirby loses all of his health from enemy or hazard damage, falls off the level, sinks in quicksand or water, or runs out of time. The game ends prematurely when all lives are lost, although the player can continue the game from the beginning of the current stage by selecting &quot;Continue&quot;.

== Development ==
&quot;Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble&quot; started development in April 1999. It was originally titled &quot;Koro Monkey&quot; (&quot;Monkey Tilt &#x27;N Tumble&quot;) and starred a monkey. After discussing with Shigeru Miyamoto, the developers then switched the character to Kirby. The game was released in Japan on August 23, 2000. It was then released in North America on April 9, 2001. It was not released outside Japan and North America.

== Reception ==
&quot;Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble&quot; received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. It debuted at number four by the American market research company NPD TRSTS for the month of April 2001.

&quot;Game Informer&quot; wrote that while the game&#x27;s concept &quot;sounds simple enough, it actually results in one of the most dramatic, high-tension game scenarios seen on any system.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 30 out of 40.

It was listed as one of the best games for the Game Boy by &quot;Game Informer&quot; in 2014. Ranking the &quot;Kirby&quot; games for its 25th anniversary, the &quot;USGamer&quot; staff ranked it as the worst spin-off game in the series. Staff writer Caty McCarthy opined it as &quot;kinda awful&quot;, adding that this wasn&#x27;t one of the enjoyable games in the series released for the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance.

It was the sixth best selling Game Boy Color game in Japan, with 563,914 copies sold.

== Legacy ==
A planned sequel to the original game, titled &quot;Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble 2&quot;, was shown at Nintendo Space World 2001, which was being developed for the GameCube and was planned to require Game Boy Advance connectivity. Video game designer Shigeru Miyamoto demonstrated the gameplay, showing Kirby falling off a ledge on the television screen to the Game Boy Advance screen. He also mentioned that the player could write &quot;programs&quot;, such as minigames, into the game cartridge. Originally planned for release in May 2002, the game was retitled as &quot;Roll-O-Rama&quot;, replacing Kirby with a marble ball. While shown at E3 2002, the title was never released.

<text>Wellington was a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was first created by redistribution in 1957, and formally came into being in the provincial election of 1958. The riding was eliminated in 1979, but was re-established in 1989. It was eliminated again for the 2011 election. It is located in the northwestern section of the city of Winnipeg, and is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.

Wellington was bordered on the east by Point Douglas, to the south by Minto and St. James, to the north by Inkster and Burrows, and to the west by the rural riding of Lakeside.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 20,283. In 1999, the average family income was $32,907, with 43% of the riding&#x27;s residents listed as low-income (the third highest in the province). The unemployment rate is 16%. Over 45% of the riding&#x27;s dwellings are rental units, and one family in four is single-parent. Wellington&#x27;s ethnic base was diverse. Seventeen per cent of its residents were aboriginal, 15% Filipino, 7% Portuguese, 3% Chinese and 2% East Indian. Manufacturing accounted for 27% of Wellington&#x27;s industry, with a further 16% in services.

The riding was held by the Progressive Conservatives from 1958 to 1966. The NDP won the seat in 1966, and held it until the riding&#x27;s dissolution in 1981. They also won every election since the riding&#x27;s re-emergence in 1990. It was considered a safe seat for the party. In 2003, veteran MLA Conrad Santos was re-elected for the riding with almost 75% of the vote.

Following the 2008 electoral redistribution, the riding was dissolved into St. James, Minto, and the new ridings of Tyndall Park (electoral district) and Logan. This change took effect for the 2011 election.

<doc id="1275128" wikidata="Q7708142" url="?curid=1275128" title="Goin' Band from Raiderland">
<text>The Goin&#x27; Band from Raiderland is the 418-member marching band of Texas Tech University.

==History==
The Goin&#x27; Band from Raiderland, originally known as The Matador Band, is nearly as old as Texas Tech itself. Under the direction of W. Waghorne, it performed at the opening football game in October 1925, fielding between 21 and 25 members.

In 1926, Harry Lemaire (1862–1963) was appointed director of the marching band. Following his service in the British Army, Lemaire had been bandmaster under Theodore Roosevelt during the Spanish–American War and was a friend and colleague of John Philip Sousa. Under his leadership, the band earned its name when it became the first college band to travel to an away game. Also during Lemaire&#x27;s tenure, the band became the first one to have its halftime show broadcast over the radio.

American humorist Will Rogers once aided in financing a trip to Fort Worth, Texas, so the band could perform at a game against the TCU Horned Frogs, becoming the first band to travel to an away game. Rogers also helped purchase new uniforms.

In 1934, Dewey O. &quot;Prof&quot; Wiley (1898–1980) became director and expanded the band from 60 members to more than 200 over the next few years.

In 1938 Texas Tech became the first university in Texas to house a chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi. Kappa Kappa Psi&#x27;s &quot;sister&quot; organization, Tau Beta Sigma, originated at Texas Tech in 1937. However, due to legal complications, the sorority could not apply for a national charter. The Alpha chapter of Tau Beta Sigma was given to the band club at Oklahoma A&amp;M University (now Oklahoma State University), with Texas Tech accepting the Beta chapter.

Dean Killion (1926–1997) came to the Goin&#x27; Band in 1959. As his predecessor had done, Killion generated another expansion, this time doubling the ranks to over four hundred members.

To ensure that all individual listeners would hear the same quality performance no matter where they sat in the stadium, Killion arranged shows so that equal instrumentation was always on both sides of the 50-yard line, and that the band played more or less equally to both halves of the stadium. This mirrored instrumentation has become known as Band 1 and Band 2, such that Band 1 performs on the right side of the 50 yard line and Band 2 on the left. Members have fierce pride in their band and thus, a rivalry exists between Band 1 and Band 2.

In 1981, Keith Bearden became the first Texas Tech alumnus to become director of the Goin&#x27; Band. He continued the style and traditions of previous directors as well as leading the band to the prestigious Sudler Trophy in 1999. Bearden also opened new venues for the Goin&#x27; Band, such as when the band traveled to Ireland in 1998 to take part in Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day parades in both Dublin and Limerick.

The Goin&#x27; Band also received another honor when one of its members, Armen Williams, became the first homecoming king representing the Goin&#x27; Band and Kappa Kappa Psi in the fall of 2004.

Keith Dye and Duane Hill served as Interim Co-Directors of the Goin&#x27; Band from Raiderland while Director Christopher M. Anderson was on temporary leave. He was expected to return for the 2011–12 season but has since resigned his position and has accepted the position of Director of Bands at Arkansas Tech University. Hill subsequently took on the role of Goin&#x27; Band director, and remained in that role until his departure in 2018.

On March 19, 2018, Duane Hill resigned as associate Directors of Bands after allegations of sexual harassment and assault and a subsequent investigation. On April 26, 2018, the School of Music announced that Eric Allen, Joel Pagán, and Ryan Smith would be filling the role as interim Goin&#x27; Band directors in Fall 2018. Joel Pagán was appointed director of the Goin&#x27; Band in Fall, 2019.

The Goin&#x27; Band notably played in the 97th annual Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving day parade on November 23, 2023.

==The Goin&#x27; Band Today==
In keeping with the campus&#x27; Spanish Renaissance architecture, the uniforms of the Goin&#x27; Band are styled after the &quot;trajes&quot; of matadors, complete with cape and a flat-brimmed &quot;gaucho&quot; hat. The traditional style of these uniforms has been in place for nearly twenty years. The Goin&#x27; Band, through many generous private gifts, along with the help of the University and the Goin&#x27; Band Association, received brand new uniforms in the fall of 2008.

The Goin&#x27; Band&#x27;s repertoire of performance music varies widely, ranging from traditional marches to jazz pieces to the works of Elton John and Carlos Santana.

The Goin&#x27; Band makes use of both traditional-style marching (formations moving goal-line to goal-line) and corps-style (formations while playing to the sidelines) in its performances. The Goin&#x27; Band also incorporates some of the tactics of scramble bands.

Like most other schools&#x27; bands, the Goin&#x27; Band is open to all Texas Tech students, regardless of major or course of study. In fact, a significant portion of the band&#x27;s membership are not music majors. Practically every single department and course of study available at Texas tech University is represented in the Goin&#x27; Band&#x27;s membership. For this reason, the Goin&#x27; Band implements a fast but efficient method of learning new performances that often does not require practices outside of normal class time (&quot;Marching Band&quot; is an actual course at Texas Tech). This allows a wide variety of students to participate without putting extra strain on their other obligations. Six, and sometimes seven different shows are performed by the Goin&#x27; Band over the course of a season. It is not unusual for the band to learn a new show from scratch in only five days, and have it ready for performance on Saturday, then start again with a new drill the following Monday.

<doc id="1275143" wikidata="Q3922099" url="?curid=1275143" title="Formal and material principles of theology">
<text>Formal principle and material principle are two categories in Christian theology to identify and distinguish the authoritative source of theology (formal principle) from the theology itself, especially the central doctrine of that theology (material principle), of a religion, religious movement, tradition, body, denomination, or organization. A formal principle tends to be texts or revered leaders of the religion; a material principle is its central teaching. Paul Tillich believes the identification and application of this pair of categories in theological thinking to have originated in the 19th century.

As early as 1845 the Protestant theologian and historian Philip Schaff discussed them in his &quot;The Principle of Protestantism&quot;. They were utilized by the Lutheran scholar F. E. Mayer in his &quot;The Religious Bodies of America&quot; in order to facilitate a comparative study of the faith and practice of Christian denominations in the United States. This is also treated in a theological pamphlet entitled &quot;Gospel and Scripture&quot; by the Commission on Theology and Church Relations of the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod.

==F.E. Mayer&#x27;s findings==
===Eastern Orthodoxy===
* Formal Principle – the Bible and the &quot;sacred tradition.&quot;
* Material Principle – Jesus Christ&#x27;s work of &quot;theopoiesis&quot; or &quot;theosis&quot; (θέωσις), the ultimate deification of man. They cite Athanasius of Alexandria from his &quot;Incarnation of the Word&quot;: &quot;Christ assumed humanity that we might become God.&quot;

===Roman Catholicism===
* Formal Principle – the Bible, Tradition, Reason, the Pope, and the Magisterium.
* Material Principle – &quot;Man&#x27;s soul, since it comes directly from God, is good and strives for reunion with God, realized in the beatific vision of God. Man&#x27;s body is subject to sin and is alienated from God. Therefore man must be progressively justified, i.e., be made just. This result is effected when through the sacraments man enters into the &#x27;state of grace&#x27; and observes the commandments which the church... by her &#x27;divine commission,&#x27; imposes upon the &#x27;faithful.&#x27;&quot;

===Lutheranism===
* Formal Principle – the Bible alone (&quot;sola Scriptura&quot;)
* Material Principle – &quot;a synopsis and summary of the Christian truth&quot; that people are justified by God&#x27;s grace through faith in Christ alone.

===Anglicanism===
* Formal Principle in general—The Bible, the authority of the church, and reason. Specifically, for individuals of different churchmanship:
:* Low Church—the Bible as the only source and the all sufficient norm of religious truth.
:* High Church – &quot;doctrinal authority rested successively in Christ, in the teaching church, in the Scriptures, and in the councils.&quot; This is called the &quot;consensus fidelium&quot; (&quot;agreement of the faithful&quot;).
:* Broad Church—along with the Bible and the &quot;consensus fidelium&quot; is included &quot;God&#x27;s self-disclosure in the religious and moral development of the human race as a whole, in the religion of Israel, the person of Christ, and the life of His mystical body, the church.&quot;
* Material Principle:
:* Low Church – &quot;the doctrine of God&#x27;s grace which faith apprehends without the addition of human works.&quot;
:* High Church—the worship of the church and apostolic succession.
:* Broad Church—a life which conforms to the ethical teachings of Jesus.

===Zwinglianism===
* Formal Principle – the Bible and direct revelation from the Holy Spirit.
* Material Principle – absolute divine causality.

===Calvinism===
* Formal Principle – the Bible as the sole standard of all truth (&quot;sola scriptura&quot;).
* Material Principle – sinful man is justified by faith alone (&quot;sola fide&quot;).

===Methodism===
* Formal Principle – the Bible, reason, teachings of the ancient church.
* Material Principle – the perfected man, i.e. entire sanctification.

<text>Alor Setar (Kedah Malay: ) is the state capital of Kedah, Malaysia. It is the second-largest city in the state after Sungai Petani and one of the most-important cities on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It is home to the third-tallest tower in Malaysia, the Alor Setar Tower.

Its location along the main travel corridor from Malaysia to Thailand has long made it a major transportation hub in the northern Malay Peninsula. Alor Setar sits along the country&#x27;s longest expressway, located from Kuala Lumpur and north of George Town, Penang. From Thailand, the city is easily accessible via the Padang Besar–Sadao Highway, it is from Sadao and from Hat Yai.

The city was originally founded as Kota Setar in 1785. Owing to the long status as the capital of Kedah, Alor Setar is regarded as one of the core cultural centres for the Kedahan Malays. It is also among the key pioneer in the Malayan transportation history, the railway station is commissioned in 1915 followed by its airport in 1929.

Alor Setar is home to the Central State Administration Centre and is the administrative centre of Kota Setar District. At present, the city covers a land area of , which is occupied by more than 400,000 inhabitants (as per the 2020 census). At the local-government level, Alor Setar is administered by the Alor Setar City Council.

It is the birthplace of two pivotal prime ministers of Malaysia; namely Tunku Abdul Rahman, the founding father of the nation (in office from 1957 to 1970) and Mahathir Mohamad, the country&#x27;s longest-serving prime minister of 24 years (in office from 1981 to 2003, from 2018 to 2020).

==Etymology==
The name came from the combination of two Malay words: &quot;Alor&quot; (&quot;small stream&quot;) and &quot;Setar&quot; (&quot;Bouea macrophylla&quot; Griff.; known as the marian plum, gandaria, or plum mango), a tree which is related to mango.

The city&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Alor Star&quot; during a 21 December 2003 ceremony proclaiming it a city. The city&#x27;s previous name was restored on 15 January 2009.

==History==
===Origin===

Alor Setar was established on 30 December 1735 by Kedah&#x27;s 19th Ruler, Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II and was the state&#x27;s eighth administrative centre since the establishment of the Kedah Sultanate in 1136. The earlier administrative centres were located in Kota Bukit Meriam, Kota Sungai Emas, Kota Siputeh, Kota Naga, Kota Sena, Kota Indera Kayangan and Kota Bukit Pinang.

The pre-existing settlement was originally a small village. However, the sultan found the area to be in a strategic location, he was drawn to the area as it was covered in a lush greenery and a center between the two estuaries of Kedah River converged. Upon the agreement with fellow Kedahan ministers, they agreed to institute a new town known as &quot;Kota Setar&quot; (the &quot;Town of Setar&quot;). The name was derived from Bouea macrophylla, a type of tree that can be found in the area.

===Period of turbulence===
A new administration institution was constructed in the settlement, with the sultan resided in Istana Kota Setar. However, the capital suffered a major attack when the Bugis armanda led by Raja Haji managed to destroy both the Istana Kota Setar (Royal Palace) and Balai Besar (Grand Hall) in 1770. In 1771, the British represented by Francis Light and Sultan Abdullah Mukaram Shah entered an agreement to halt the Bugis influence in Kedah.

During the coronation ceremony of Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II of Kedah on 17 March 1805, Siamese forces managed to occupy the capital. The sultan was forced to retreat to Penang and later Malacca. The settlement was put on a standstill for 20 years. He was restored to the crown in 1842 and the capital was temporary relocated to Kota Kuala Muda before returning to Kota Setar.

===Recovery and growth===

In October 1883, James F. Agustin, an Englishmen arrived in Kuala Sungai Kedah (now known as Kuala Kedah) about 10 km from the capital. He and a few other English explorers embarked their journey towards inland areas of Kedah where he met several Malay settlement on the riverbanks of the Kedah river.

Upon his arrival in Kampung Kota Setar, he befriended several local Malays and they invited him to the sultan&#x27;s palatial residence. Agustin remarked on the beauty of the palatial architecture and its landscape covered with the stalk trees. He was well received by the sultan and both parties exchanged goods between one another.

The visit by Agustin spurred a growth for a more active and direct trade relations between the area and outside commercial powerhouse. The city attracted various cosmopolitan trading activities from the British, Indian, Chinese together with other local and regional merchants. The town prospered from a small settlement into a bustling town designated to accommodate further population growth, commerce and administration. The British especially, was quite drawn to the potential of Kota Setar (as it was then known).

Gradually, Kota Setar thrived and further evolved into a commercial, transportation and communication hub of Kedah. The name was then changed from Kota Setar into Alor Setar, a reflection of its geographical features located in a small stream (known as &quot;Alor&quot; in Malay) which was frequented by the Malay traders from the neighbouring states. However, the name Kota Setar was retained as sub-district under Alor Setar.

===19th and 20th century===
Other significant events during the turn of the 20th century includes the reunification of Perlis and Setul (now Satun) to Kedah by the Siamese in May 1897 (both provinces had been separated from Kedah in 1821) held in Balai Besar. The event was attended by the Crown Prince of Kedah, Tuanku Abdul Aziz as a representative of Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah. In 1904, the city witnessed the grand wedding of the five children of Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah, lasting for 3 months and the cost estimated to be 3 million Ringgit.

The town joined the protest against Malayan Union during the post-war period. The mass protest was attended by 10,000 against the British backed-proposal. It was led by Tunku Abdul Rahman together with key leaders from UMNO. The town also witnessed the 4th UMNO General Assembly which lay the draft for the foundation of the present-day Constitution of Malaysia.

The coronation ceremony of Abdul Halim of Kedah, the 28th Sultan of Kedah was held in Balai Besar on 20 February 1959. The city celebrates the silver jubilee of Sultan Abdul Halim in 1983.

The change of status of Alor Setar throughout the 20th century was also closely parallel by the rise of its urban development, demographic and population growth. The council was upgraded to Kota Setar Municipal Council on 1 February 1978, which traced its origin to Kota Setar District Council on 1 March 1976, Alor Star Municipal Board in 1958 and Alor Star Sanitary Board in 1905.

<text>Joseph Funk (1778–1862) was a pioneer American music teacher, publisher, and an early American composer. He invented a shape note system in 1851 for the Harmonia Sacra.

Funk was born April 6, 1778 (though his gravestone states March 9, 1777), in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the son of Henry and Barbara (Showalter) Funk, and a grandson of Bishop Heinrich Funck, a German Palatine settler of Bernese Swiss descent. Bishop Funck came to America in 1719, and was the first Mennonite bishop in America. As a boy, Joseph moved with his parents to Rockingham County, Virginia, and spent the rest of his life there.

In 1804, Funk married Elizabeth Rhodes, and they had five children. After her death, he married Rachel Britton, and they raised nine children.

He was a member of the Mennonite Church. In 1847, he established the first Mennonite printing house in the United States, at Mountain Valley, Virginia (renamed Singers Glen in 1860). Funk and his sons were active in organizing and teaching many singing schools in Virginia.

Funk died December 24, 1862, and is buried in the cemetery at Singers Glen.
Funk compiled and published seven books and periodicals:
:*&quot;Ein allgemein nützliche Choral-Music&quot; (1816)
:*&quot;A Compilation of Genuine Church Music&quot; (1832)
:*&quot;The Confession of Faith&quot; (1837)
:*&quot;A Collection of Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs&quot; (1847)
:*&quot;The Reviewer Reviewed&quot; (1857)
:*&quot;The Southern Musical Advocate and Singer&#x27;s Friend&quot;
:*&quot;J. and D. Brenneman, Hymns&quot;

The 1847 fourth edition of Funk&#x27;s &quot;A Compilation of Genuine Church Music&quot; was the first publication by Joseph Funk and Sons at Singers Glen. The name was changed to &quot;Harmonia Sacra&quot; in 1851. The book is still is in use by Mennonites today. &quot;The Southern Musical Advocate and Singer&#x27;s Friend&quot; was a 16-page monthly periodical published by Funk from 1859 to 1861. It was a forerunner of &quot;The Musical Million and Fireside Friend&quot;, a periodical published by Funk&#x27;s grandson, Aldine S. Kieffer. Joseph Funk&#x27;s sons continued the printing business after his death. The Ruebush-Kieffer Company purchased the press in 1878.

The Joseph Funk House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

<text>Carlos Arias Navarro, 1st Marquess of Arias Navarro (11 December 1908 – 27 November 1989) was the Prime Minister of Spain during the final years of the Francoist dictatorship and the beginning of the Spanish transition to democracy.

Arias Navarro was a hardline politician and was involved in the White Terror, having signed thousands of death warrants during the dismantling of the Spanish Republic. Later, he was a more moderate leader during his premiership.

==Early life==
Arias Navarro was born in Madrid on 11 December 1908. He served in the Ministry of Justice since 1929 as attorney in Málaga and Madrid.

==Francoist Spain==
Arias was close to the right-wing sectors and joined the Francoist side during the Spanish Civil War. He was public prosecutor in the trials set up by the Francoists in Málaga after the conquest of the city. There, he earned the nickname the &quot;Butcher of Málaga&quot; (&quot;Carnicero de Málaga&quot;) for his role in the imposition of capital punishment to true or perceived sympathizers of the Republicans, In one of the harshest repressions following the Francoist victory, an estimated total of 17,000 people were summarily executed.

He married María de la Luz del Valle y Menéndez, without issue.

After serving in various positions, including Mayor of Madrid from 1965 to June 1973, Arias became Minister of Government (Minister of the Interior) in June 1973. After the assassination of Prime Minister (&quot;Presidente del Gobierno&quot;) Luis Carrero Blanco he was appointed his successor on 31 December 1973, a position he continued to hold after the death of Franco. Arias Navarro had the support of the Franco family, most notably Carmen Polo, and retained the post during the transition to democracy. However, the garroting of the Catalan anarchist Salvador Puig Antich in March 1974 had already shown his aversion to political liberalization, while other events, including the executions in September 1974, the organization of the Green March in November 1975 by King Hassan II of Morocco, and the illness and death of Franco (which Arias announced on television), displayed his weaknesses and further eroded his authority.

Franco&#x27;s successor as head of state, King Juan Carlos I, continued his appointment, so that it was his government (which included Manuel Fraga Iribarne and José María de Areilza) that instituted the first reforms, however unwillingly. He tried to continue Franco&#x27;s late policies, opposing any change. After a lengthy power struggle, Juan Carlos forced his resignation on 1 July 1976.

The next day, the King granted him the hereditary title of &quot;Marqués de Arias Navarro&quot; (English: Marquess of Arias Navarro), together with the dignity Grande de España (English: Grandee of Spain). On his death, the title of Marquess was inherited by his nephew Miguel Ángel Arias-Navarro.

Arias was succeeded by Adolfo Suárez, named general secretary of the Francoist official party &quot;Movimiento Nacional&quot; in December 1975. In June 1977, during the first free general elections held since 1936, Arias joined the &quot;Alianza Popular&quot;, a right-wing party created by Manuel Fraga. He then led the Búnker group of hard-liners opposed to any reforms, along with the leader of the Francoist party &quot;Fuerza Nueva&quot;, Blas Piñar. Arias, however, never again occupied a relevant position in the later Spanish government.

Both left and extreme right attacked him, calling him by the nickname &quot;The Old &quot;.

==Later years==
In his first democratic election his party joined the Popular Alliance (AP), led by Manuel Fraga, running as a senate candidate for Madrid, but he was not elected. He died on 27 November 1989 at 80 years of age from an infarction, and was buried at Mingorrubio Cemetery in El Pardo. His wife died in 1997.

==Spain and Portugal==
According to the Spanish daily &quot;El País&quot;, files released by the US National Archives and Records Administration show that, following the left-wing Carnation Revolution in Portugal on 25 April 1974, Arias met with the United States Deputy Secretary of State Robert S. Ingersoll in March 1975 and offered to invade Portugal in order to stop the spread of communism. The report Ingersoll forwarded to the then-Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, on 18 March, stated that &quot;appropriate steps&quot; were being taken to ensure that &quot;the events in Portugal did not cross the border into Spain.&quot;

Ingersoll went on to add that Spain wanted Washington to support Spain in the event of war, precisely at a time when the US was renegotiating the status of its military bases, and Arias wanted Washington to support Spain&#x27;s future membership of NATO.

<doc id="1275160" wikidata="Q241338" url="?curid=1275160" title="Wiener Werkstätte">
<text>The Wiener Werkstätte (&quot;Vienna Workshop&quot;), established in 1903 by the graphic designer and painter Koloman Moser, the architect Josef Hoffmann and the patron Fritz Waerndorfer, was a productive association in Vienna, Austria that brought together architects, artists, designers and artisans working in ceramics, fashion, silver, furniture and the graphic arts. The Workshop was &quot;dedicated to the artistic production of utilitarian items in a wide range of media, including metalwork, leatherwork, bookbinding, woodworking, ceramics, postcards and graphic art, and jewelry.&quot; It is regarded as a pioneer of modern design, and its influence can be seen in later styles such as Bauhaus and Art Deco.

Following World War I, the workshop was beset by financial troubles and material shortages. Attempts to expand the workshop&#x27;s base were unsuccessful, as was a reorganization under the direction of Austrian artist Philipp Häusler. In 1926, Workshop financier Otto Primavesi&#x27;s bank failed and the Workshop limped through the stock market crash in 1929. Ultimately it was forced to close in 1932.

==Origins==
The enterprise evolved from the Vienna Secession, founded in 1897 as a progressive alliance of artists and designers. From the start, the Secession had placed special emphasis on the applied arts, and its 1900 exhibition surveying the work of contemporary European design workshops prompted the young architect Josef Hoffmann and his artist friend Koloman Moser to consider establishing a similar enterprise.
Finally in 1903, with backing from the industrialist Fritz Wärndorfer, the Wiener Werkstätte began operations in three small rooms; it soon expanded to fill a three-story building with separate, specially designed facilities for metalwork, leatherwork, bookbinding, furniture and a paint shop. The range of product lines also included leather goods, enamel, jewellery, textiles, millinery fashion, lace, postcards and ceramics.

==Style==
The Workshop &quot;derived inspiration from the rich tradition of the glorious past&quot; with fine workmanship and high attention to detail, hearkening back to a more civilized, and secure, time. Beginning with the 14th Exhibition of the Vienna Secession in 1902, the radical distinctiveness of certain Viennese artists began to emerge, setting a foundation for the widespread Modernist movement; this became known as Wiener-Werkstätte-Stil (literally, the Vienna Workshops Style). Among the innovators were the Austrian designers Gisela Falke von Lilienstein and Else Unger, and the Viennese architect Josef Hoffmann. The latter&#x27;s cubist sculpture created in 1902 marked a break into independence for many Viennese artists. His works from this period are especially remarkable when one considers that the term &quot;cubism&quot; only found its way into the art lexicon around 1907 to describe the work of Pablo Picasso. 

Dresses by Eduard Josef Wimmer-Wisgrill inspired Paul Poiret&#x27;s when the latter visited the Workshop&#x27;s Berlin exhibition in 1913. The work was considered both highly fashionable as well as functional. Other pieces at the exhibition included day and evening clothes, housedresses and negligees. Some of the earliest productions of the fashion workshop were artists smocks for Klimt and sculptor Anton Hanack 

Josef Hoffman wrote in a 1928 retrospective on the 25th anniversary of the Workshop that:

&quot;The Wiener Werkstatte...is an undertaking that furthers and nurtures all artistic and qualitative endeavors in the field of modern craftsmanship...Our main achievement has been to give practical and appropriate forms to all objects and then to make these unique and valuable through pleasing proportions and harmonious shapes. The materials, the tools, and sometimes the machine are our only means of expression. We do not dictate to an artist, but seek only to encourage him to follow his own intuition and develop his creative power.&quot;

==Production==
Most of the objects produced in the Wiener Werkstatte were stamped with a number of different marks: the trademark of the Wiener Werkstatte, the monogram of the designer and that of the craftsman, who created it. The Wiener Werkstatte had about 100 employees in 1905, of whom 37 were masters of their trade.

The seat of the venture was in Neustiftgasse 32–34, where a new building was adapted to their requirements. Eventually the project exhausted Wärndorfer&#x27;s fortune. The circle of customers of the Wiener Werkstatte and Josef Hoffmann mainly consisted of artists and Jewish upper middle class supporters of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Several branches of the workshop were opened in Karlsbad 1909, Marienbad, Zürich 1916–1917, New York 1922, Berlin 1929. 
In architectural commissions such as the Sanatorium Purkersdorf and the Stoclet Palace in Brussels, the Wiener Werkstätte was able to realize its ideal of the Gesamtkunstwerk (total artwork), a coordinated environment in which everything down to the last detail was consciously designed as an integral part of the whole project.

For several years, beginning in 1904, the Wiener Werkstätte had its own carpentry workshop, though only few pieces of furniture were made there. Josef Hoffmann designed a furniture line noted for its simple forms for the firm of Jacob &amp; Josef Kohn. Most of the furniture known as Wiener Werkstätte Furniture was made by cabinet-makers such as Portois &amp; Fix, Johann Soulek, Anton Herrgesell, Anton Pospisil, Friedrich Otto Schmidt and Johann Niedermoser. Some historians now believe that there are no existing original products of the Wiener Werkstätte Furniture division. 

From 1905, the Wiener Werkstatte produced handpainted and printed silks. The Backhausen firm was responsible for the machine-printed and woven textiles. In 1907, the Wiener Werkstätte took over distribution for the Wiener Keramik, a ceramics workshop headed by Michael Powolny and Berthold Löffler. And in the same year Moser, embittered by the financial squabbling, left the Wiener Werkstätte, which subsequently entered a new phase, both stylistically and economically.

==Expansion==

The founding of textile and fashion divisions in 1909 and 1910 brought a further shift in the Wiener Werkstätte&#x27;s emphasis. After a close brush with bankruptcy in 1913, Wärndorfer left for America and the following year Otto Primavesi, a banker from Moravia, took over as chief financier and patron.

During and immediately following the First World War the Wiener Werkstatte was influenced by a new generation of artists and craftsmen, especially Dagobert Peche, who became creative director in 1915, and the director of the Zürich branch in 1917. Peche&#x27;s playfully theatrical aesthetic reimagined decorative motifs of the Baroque and Rococo in a modern way.
After the war, material shortages encouraged experimentation with cheaper, less durable materials such as wood, ceramics and papier-mâché. One of the ceramics contributors was Walter Bosse.

At the beginning of the 1920s, Philipp Hausler attempted to eliminate the &quot;bad habits&quot; and &quot;extravagances&quot; which devoured so much money by broadening the workshop&#x27;s base. The WW artists, however, insisted upon their accustomed exclusivity, and Hausler left in 1925.&quot; Attempts to expand the workshop&#x27;s scope—adding such items as wallpaper to its limited program of industrial licenses, and establishing branches in Berlin, New York and Zurich—were not particularly successful. The Werkstätte&#x27;s financial situation grew desperate due to the effects of the war and the onset of the worldwide Depression in 1929. In the 1932 it was compelled to declare bankruptcy and closed.

==Legacy==
With its avant-garde, artistic, yet timeless designs, the Wiener-Werkstaette-Stil influenced generations of architects and designers in the 20th century. The Bauhaus in Germany, Art Deco in America from 1920 to 1940, Scandinavian design from 1940–1960 (see for example Arne Jacobsen), as well as Italian design (see Mario Bellini) between 1960 and 1980, were all strongly influenced by the Wiener Werkstätte.

A work representative is the Stoclet Palace in Brussels, which is considered a &quot;Gesamtkunstwerk&quot; of the company.

The chocolate company Altmann &amp; Kühne uses many of the designs of the company for its chocolate boxes, as does Demel.

<doc id="1275172" wikidata="Q379821" url="?curid=1275172" title="Massagetae">
<text>The Massagetae or Massageteans, also known as Sakā tigraxaudā or Orthocorybantians, were an ancient Eastern Iranian Saka people who inhabited the steppes of Central Asia and were part of the wider Scythian cultures. The Massagetae rose to power in the 8th to 7th centuries BCE, when they started a series of events with wide-reaching consequences by expelling the Scythians out of Central Asia and into the Caucasian and Pontic Steppes. The Massagetae are most famous for their queen Tomyris&#x27;s alleged defeating and killing of Cyrus, the founder of the Persian Achaemenid Empire.

The Massagetae declined after the 3rd century BCE, after which they merged with some other tribes to form the Alans, a people who belonged to the larger Sarmatian tribal confederation, and who moved westwards into the Caucasian and European steppes, where they participated in the events of the Migration Period.

== Names ==
===Massagetae===
The name is the Latin form of &quot;Massagétai&quot;.

The Iranologist Rüdiger Schmitt notes that although the original name of the Massagetae is unattested, it appears that the most plausible etymon is the Iranian . is the plural form, containing the East Iranian suffix , which is reflected in Greek . The singular form is and is composed of the Iranian and , meaning &quot;fish,&quot; derived from Young Avestan (; cognate with Vedic ). The name literally means &quot;concerned with fish,&quot; or &quot;fisherman.&quot; This corresponds with the remark made by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus (1.216.3) that &quot;they live on their livestock and fish.&quot; Schmitt notes that objections to this reasoning, based on the assumption that, instead of , a derivation from Iranian &quot;fish&quot; (compare Ossetian ()) would be expected, is &quot;not decisive.&quot; Schmitt states that any other interpretations on the origin of the original Iranian name of the Massagetae are &quot;linguistically unacceptable.&quot;

The Iranologist János Harmatta has, however, criticised the proposal of &#x27;s derivation from , meaning &quot;fish-eating (men),&quot; as being semantically and phonologically unacceptable, and instead has suggested that the name might be derived from an early Bactrian language name , from an earlier related to the Young Avestan terms (), (), (), meaning &quot;men,&quot; with the ending of the name being derived from the East Iranian suffix or from the collective formative syllable from which the suffix evolved. According to Harmatta&#x27;s hypothesis, the Bactrian name would have corresponded to the name , meaning &quot;men,&quot; used by the Massagetae for themselves.

The Old Persian name () meant &quot;Saka who wear pointed hats&quot;, with the descriptive (), meaning &quot;wearer of pointed hats,&quot; being composed of the terms (), &quot;pointed,&quot; and (), &quot;cap.&quot; This name was a reference to the Phrygian cap worn by the ancient Iranian peoples, of which the wore an unusually tall and pointed form.
The name given to the / is derived from the Latin name , which is derived from the , which is itself the literal translation of the Old Persian name (), meaning &quot;wearer of pointed hats.&quot;,

===Apasiacae===
The proposed etymologies for the Massagataean sub-tribe of the Apasiacae, whose name is not attested in ancient Iranian records, include , meaning &quot;Water-Sakas,&quot; and , meaning &quot;rejoicing at water,&quot; which have so far not been conclusive.

==Identification==
======
The Iranologist János Harmatta has identified the Massagetae as being the same as the people named (&quot;Sakā who wear pointed caps&quot;) by the Persians and by Graeco-Romans. Harmatta&#x27;s identification is based on the mention of the as living between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, where Arrian also located the Massagetae.

The scholar Marek Jan Olbrycht has also identified the Massagetae with the .
János Harmatta has also identified the / with the , with this identification being based on the location of the former between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, where Arrian also located the Dahae. The scholars A. Abetekov and H. Yusupov have also suggested that the were a constituent tribe of the Massagetae. C. J. Brunner suggested that the Daha were either neighbours of the Saka Tigraxauda or that both groups were part of the same people.

The scholar Y. A. Zadneprovskiy has instead suggested that the Dahae were descendants of the Massagetae.

Marek Jan Olbrycht considers the as being a separate group from the Saka, and therefore as not identical with the Massagetae/.
Based on Strabo&#x27;s remark that the Massagetae lived partly on the plains, the mountains, the marshes, and the islands in the country irrigated by the Araxes river, the Iranologist Rüdiger Schmitt has also suggestive a tentative connection with the (Ancient Egyptian ), the &quot;Saka of the Marshes, Saka of the Land,&quot; mentioned in the Suez Inscriptions of Darius the Great.

===Sub-tribes===
The Massagetae were composed of multiple sub-tribes, including:
*the ()
*the ()
*the (; , ; , )

==Location==
The Massagetae lived in the Caspian Steppe as well as in the lowlands of Central Asia located to the east of the Caspian Sea and the south-east of the Aral Sea, more precisely across the large area stretching from the lands around the Amu Darya and Zarafshan rivers up to the steppes and the deserts to the north of the Khorasan mountain corridor, that is in the region including the Kyzylkum and Karakum deserts and the Ustyurt Plateau, especially the area between the Oxus and Iaxartes rivers and around Chorasmia. The territory of the Massagetae thus included the area corresponding to modern-day Turkmenistan and might possibly have extended to parts of Hyrcania as well.

One of the Massagetaean sub-groups, the Apasiacae, lived either on the east coast of the Aral Sea between the Oxus and Tanais/Iaxartes rivers, or possibly along the Oxus in western Bactria, or between the Caspian and Aral Seas&quot;

Another Massagetaean sub-group, the Derbices, lived in the arid area to the north of the Atrek river bordered by the Caspian Sea to the west, by Hyrcania to the south, the Oxus river in the east, and the Balkhan Mountain and the Ochus river and its estuary were in their territory. During the Achaemenid period, some Derbices had migrated to the southwest along the shore of the Caspian Sea and reached central Tabaristan. The Derbices shared the region between the Caspian Sea and the Oxus with the Dahae, who might however have been identical with the Massagetae, and the Derbices might have extended to the east of the Oxus, with the Greek author Ctesias even extending their range up to the borders of Bactria and India.

The imprecise description of where the Massagetae lived by ancient authors has however led modern scholars to ascribe to them various locations, such as the Oxus delta, the Iaxartes delta, between the Caspian and Aral seas or further to the north or north-east, but without basing these suggestions on any conclusive arguments.

== History ==
===Early history===
The Massagetae rose to power in the 8th to 7th centuries BCE, when they migrated from the east into Central Asia, from where they expelled the Scythians, another nomadic Iranian tribe to whom they were closely related. After this, they came to occupy large areas of the region, including the Caspian Steppe where they supplanted the Scythians. The Massagetae displacing the early Scythians and forcing them to the west across the Araxes river and into the Caucasian and Pontic steppes started a significant movement of the nomadic peoples of the Eurasian Steppe, following which the Scythians displaced the Cimmerians and the Agathyrsi, who were also nomadic Iranian peoples closely related to the Massagetae and the Scythians, conquered their territories, and invaded Western Asia. There, their presence had an important role in the history of the ancient civilisations of Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Egypt, and Iran.

The had close contact with the Median Empire, whose influence had stretched to the lands east of the Caspian Sea, before it was replaced by the Persian Achaemenid dynasty in 550 BC.

=== Death of Cyrus ===
During the 6th century BCE, the Massagetae had to face the successor of the Median Empire, the newly formed Persian Achaemenid Empire, whose founder, Cyrus II, carried out a campaign against them in 530 BCE. According to Herodotus, Cyrus captured a Massagetaean camp by ruse, after which the Massagetae queen Tomyris led the tribe&#x27;s main force against the Persians, defeated them, killed Cyrus, and placed his severed head in a sack full of blood. According to another version of the death of Cyrus recorded by Ctesias, it was the Derbices, who were the tribe against whom Cyrus died in battle: according to this version, he was mortally wounded by the Derbices and their Indian allies, after which Cyrus&#x27;s ally, the king Amorges of the , intervened with his own army and helped the Persian soldiers defeat the Derbices, following which Cyrus endured for three days, during which he organised his empire and appointed Spitaces son of Sisamas as satrap over the Derbices, before finally dying. The reason why the Derbices, and not the Massagetae, are named as the people against whom Cyrus died fighting is because the Derbices were members or identical with the Massagetae. According to Strabo, Cyrus died fighting against the Saka (of which the Massagetae were a group), and according to Quintus Curtius Rufus he died fighting against the Abiae.

The Babylonian scribe Berossus, who lived in 3rd century BCE, instead recorded that Cyrus died in a battle against the Dahae; according to the Iranologist Muhammad Dandamayev, Berossus identified the Dahae rather than the Massagetae as Cyrus&#x27;s killers because they had replaced the Massagetae as the most famous nomadic tribe of Central Asia long before Berossus&#x27;s time; although some scholars identified the Dahae as being identical with the Massagetae or as one of their sub-groups.

===Achaemenid rule===
Little more is known about the Massagetae after the war with Cyrus. During the Achaemenid period, they were pressing on Hyrcania, and by around 520 BCE and possibly earlier, they were ruled by a king named Skuⁿxa, who rebelled against the Persian Empire until one of the successors of Cyrus, the Achaemenid king Darius I, carried out a campaign against the Sakas from 520 to 518 BCE during which he conquered the Massagetae/, captured Skuⁿxa, and replaced him with a ruler who was loyal to Achaemenid power. According to Polyaenus, Darius fought against three armies led by three kings, respectively named Sacesphares, Thamyris (whose name might be related to that of Tomyris), and Amorges or Homarges, with Polyaenus&#x27;s account being based on Persian historical records.

The territories of the Saka were absorbed into the Achaemenid Empire as part of Chorasmia, which included much of the territory between the Oxus and the Iaxartes rivers, and the Saka supplied the Achaemenid army with a large number of mounted bowmen. After Darius&#x27;s administrative reforms of the Achaemenid Empire, the were included within the same tax district as the Medes.

During the Macedonian invasion of the Achaemenid Empire, the Massagetae provided the Achaemenid army with 40,000 troops, which was a larger number than the troops furnished by all the other inhabitants of the coast of the Caspian Sea put together.

===Later history===
The Massagetae, along with the Sogdians and Bactrians, participated in the rebellion of Spitamenes against Alexander III of Macedon, but they later submitted to him again after Spitamenes was murdered.

Among the scholars who do not identify the Massagetae with the Dahae, Rüdiger Schmitt suggests that the Massagetae were instead absorbed by the Dahae by the later Hellenistic period. Muhammad Dandamayev has suggested that the Dahae had replaced the Massagetae as the most known people of the Central Asian steppes. Marek Jan Olbrycht suggests that the Dahae migrated to the west from the areas east of the Aral Sea and around the Iaxartes valley and expelled the Derbices from their homeland, after which the latter split, with a part of them migrating into Hyrcania and others to the lower Uzboy river.

During the Hellenistic period, a section of the Massagetaean sub-tribe of the Derbices had migrated to the southwest along the coast of the Caspian Sea and reached central Tabaristan, while another sub-group moved to the south-east into Margiana.

Around 230 BCE, the Parnian king and founder of the Parthian Empire, Arsaces I, sought refuge from the Seleucid king Seleucus II Callinicus by fleeing among the Massagataean sub-tribe of the Apasiacae. Seleucus&#x27;s attempted campaign to recover the eastern satrapies of his empire was initially successful. However, the outbreak of revolts in the western part of his empire prevented him from continuing his war against the Parthians, who, with the backing of the Apasiacae, were ultimately successful.

===Disappearance===

The dominance of the Massagetae in Central Asia ended in the 3rd century BCE, following the Macedonian conquest of Persia, which cut off the relations between the steppe nomads and the sedentary populations of the previous Persian Achaemenid Empire. The succeeding Seleucid Empire started attacking the Massagetae, Saka and Dahae nomads who had lived to the north of its borders, which in turn led to these peoples putting westward pressure from the east on a related nomadic Iranian people, the Sarmatians. The Sarmatians, taking advantage of the decline of Scythian power in the west, crossed the Don river and invaded Scythia starting in the late 4th century and the early 3rd century BCE.

The Massagetae themselves merged with tribal groups in Central Asia to form the Alans, a people who themselves belonged to the larger Sarmatian group. Related to the Asii who had invaded Bactria in the 2nd century BCE, the Alans were pushed by the Kang-chü people to the west into the Caucasian and Pontic steppes, where they came in contact and conflict with the Parthian and Roman empires. By the 2nd century CE, they had conquered the steppes of the north Caucasus and the north Black Sea area and created a powerful confederation of tribes under their rule.

In 375 CE, the Huns conquered most of the Alans living to the east of the Don river, massacred a significant number of them and absorbed them into their tribal polity, while the Alans to the west of the Don remained free from Hunnish domination and participated in the movements of the Migration Period. Some free Alans fled into the mountains of the Caucasus, where they participated in the ethnogenesis of populations including the Ossetians and the Kabardians, and other Alan groupings survived in Crimea. Other free Alans migrated into Central and then Western Europe, from where some of them went to Britannia and Hispania, and some Alans joined the Germanic Vandals into crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and creating the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa.

===Legacy===
Byzantine authors later used the name &quot;Massagetae&quot; as an archaising term for the Huns, Turks, Tatars and other related peoples who were completely unrelated to the populations the name initially designated in Antiquity.

A 9th century work by Rabanus Maurus, &quot;De Universo&quot;, states: &quot;The Massagetae are in origin from the tribe of the Scythians, and are called Massagetae, as if heavy, that is, strong Getae.&quot; In Central Asian languages such as Middle Persian and Avestan, the prefix &quot;massa&quot; means &quot;great,&quot; &quot;heavy,&quot; or &quot;strong.&quot;

Some authors, such as Alexander Cunningham, James P. Mallory, Victor H. Mair, and Edgar Knobloch have proposed relating the Massagetae to the Gutians of 2000 BC Mesopotamia, and/or a people known in ancient China as the &quot;Da Yuezhi&quot; or &quot;Great Yuezhi&quot; (who founded the Kushan Empire in South Asia). Mallory and Mair suggest that &quot;Da Yuezhi &quot; may at one time have been pronounced &quot;d&#x27;ad-ngiwat-tieg&quot;, connecting them to the Massagetae. These theories are not widely accepted, however.

Many scholars have suggested that the Massagetae were related to the Getae of ancient Eastern Europe.

Tadeusz Sulimirski notes that the Sacae also invaded parts of Northern India. Weer Rajendra Rishi, an Indian linguist has identified linguistic affinities between Indian and Central Asian languages, which further lends credence to the possibility of historical Sacae influence in Northern India.

==Culture==
===Lifestyle===
According to Strabo, the Massagetae lived on the plains, the mountains, the marshes, and the islands in the country irrigated by the Araxes river.

Some Massagetae were primarily fishermen, and other groups of the tribe bred sheep for their milk and wool, but also harvested root vegetables and wild fruits. None of the Massagetae, however, practised any form of agriculture, and their food consisted of meat and fish, and they primarily drank milk, but not wine. According to the Greek author Strabo, the Derbices did not consume any female animals.

Gold and bronze were plentiful where the Massagetae lived, but they did not use any iron or silver because these were not available in their country.

The Massagetae might possibly have practised cranial deformation.

===Clothing===

Like all ancient Iranian peoples, the Massagetae/ wore knee-length tunics which were either straight and closed (following Median fashion) or open with lapels, both styles being fastened by a belt at the waist (following typically Scythic fashion). Underneath, they wore narrow trousers and moccasins. Over these, they sometimes wore a cloak with long and narrow sleeves, and the pointed cap, although their tribe wore a distinctive form of this headdress which had a sharp point, and from which the names given to them by the Persians ( ) and the Greeks ( ), both meaning &quot;wearer of pointed caps,&quot; were derived. The use of the Median closed tunic among the was the result of extensive contact between the and the Medes during the period of the Median Empire.

The fishermen wore seal skins, while the sheep-breeders wore clothing made of wool.

The Massagetae wore golden headdresses, belts, shoulder straps, and used golden harnesses and bronze armour for their horses.

===Warfare===
The Massagetae fought both on foot and on horseback, and their weapons consisted of bows and arrows, spears, and battle-axes, and their horse armour, spearheads, and arrowheads were golden.

The Massagetae especially used spears whose blades were made of copper or iron, due to which the Greek called them the (), meaning &quot;spear-bearers.&quot; 

===Language===
The name of the Massagetaean prince, recorded in the Greek form () and reflecting the Scythian form , is of Scythian language origin, and his name and the name of the Agathyrsi king Spargapeithes and the Scythian king Spargapeithes () are variants of the same name.

The name of the king Skuⁿxa might be related to the Ossetian term meaning &quot;distinguishing oneself,&quot; and attested as () in the Digor dialect, and as ) in the Iron dialect.

===Religion===

Herodotus mentioned that the Massagetae worshipped only the sun god, to whom they sacrificed horses. This is seen to indicate the cult of the Iranian sun god Mithra, who was associated with the worship of fire and horses. When Cyrus attacked the Massagetae, their queen Tomyris swore by the Sun to kill him if he did not return to his kingdom.

However, Strabo recorded that the Derbices, who were either identical with the Massagetae or one of their sub-tribes, worshipped &quot;Mother Earth,&quot; interpreted as the Earth and Water goddess Api.

===Marriage customs===
The Massagetae contracted monogamous marriages, although the wives could have sexual relations with other men. When a Massagetaean man wanted to have sexual relations with a woman, he would hang his gorytos outside of her tent, inside of which the couple would proceed to have intercourse. Edvard Westermarck, however, in &quot;The History of Human Marriage&quot;, suggested that Herodotus and Strabo, on whose writings this understanding of Massagetaean marriage customs is based, might have been mistaken, and that the relevant custom was instead one, said to be common in Central Asia, by which brothers shared a single wife.

===Funeral customs===
According to Herodotus, members of the Massagetae were sacrificed and cooked and eaten with the meat of sacrificial animals. Members of the Massagetae who died of illness were buried or left as food for wild animals.

<doc id="1275173" wikidata="Q286038" url="?curid=1275173" title="Sound of the Underground (album)">
<text>Sound of the Underground is the debut studio album by English-Irish girl group Girls Aloud, formed through the ITV television series &quot;&quot;. It was released in Ireland on 23 May 2003, in the United Kingdom and Europe on 26 May 2003, and reissued on 17 November 2003 through Polydor. Girls Aloud worked with a variety of musicians and producers on &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, which was largely inspired by 1980s music. Comparisons were made with artists such as Bananarama, The Bangles, Blondie and Spice Girls.

&quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; debuted to generally favourable reviews from contemporary music critics, who noted the high quality of the album compared to output from other reality show contestants. The album was certified platinum in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It yielded four singles, including the title track, which topped the UK Singles Chart for a month. The album has sold 368,000 copies in the United Kingdom alone.

The album was re-released on 16 June 2023, in celebration of the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, available in vinyl format for the first time.

== Background and recording ==
Girls Aloud were formed through the ITV1 programme &quot;Popstars: The Rivals&quot; by a public vote on 30 November 2002. Their debut single &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; was one of sixty songs that Brian Higgins and Miranda Cooper had written with the aim of launching their own girl group. The song was originally recorded in 2001 by London girl group Orchid, who disbanded before gaining a firm record deal. It was produced by Xenomania and chosen by Girls Aloud&#x27;s manager Louis Walsh as their debut single. &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; was 2002&#x27;s Christmas number one single and spent a further three weeks at number one. &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; and another Xenomania production, Sugababes&#x27; &quot;Round Round&quot;, have been called &quot;two huge groundbreaking hits&quot;, credited with reshaping British pop music for the 2000s.

Following the single&#x27;s success, Girls Aloud proceeded to begin recording their debut album, which shares its title with the single. As the team grew, their music began to take over the nation. Girls Aloud worked with a variety of mostly British musicians and producers, such as Betty Boo, the Beatmasters, Graham Stack, Steve Anderson and Tim Kellett, and reunited with Higgins and Xenomania. Girls Aloud deliberately waited five months after the release of &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; in order to ensure they would have a strong second single. Referring to their second single &quot;No Good Advice&quot;, Higgins said that Girls Aloud initially did not like the song – &quot;we played them some of it, and they said: &#x27;That&#x27;s not our sound.&#x27; I objected to the use of that phrase &#x27;our sound&#x27;. I told them they had five minutes to talk about whether or not they wanted to continue with me. They went away and spoke about it and since then it&#x27;s been fine. They come in expecting to work, and there&#x27;s a trust there which, I think, dates back to that day.&quot;

&quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; remains Girls Aloud&#x27;s only studio album not to be entirely written and produced by Higgins and Xenomania, who had initially only created two songs for the album, &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; and &quot;No Good Advice&quot;. When Higgins heard the remaining ten tracks that Girls Aloud had recorded for the album, he promptly called Polydor to complain about the lack of creative content. Higgins said, &quot;They&#x27;d sent them off to these other Swedish guys and different people in the UK [...] I said, &#x27;There are two completely separate groups on this record. We need to get rid of six tracks and I&#x27;ll replace them&#x27;. We did that and allowed the album to stand up as a body of work.&quot; This last-minute decision resulted in Girls Aloud returning to the studio to record a further four tracks with Xenomania – &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot;, &quot;Life Got Cold&quot;, &quot;Stop&quot; and &quot;Love/Hate&quot;. The album was completed in April 2003 and described as a mix of &quot;Blondie and Bananarama, with a smattering of the Spice Girls at their best thrown in.&quot;

During the summer of 2003, Girls Aloud would again work with Higgins and Xenomania, recording a further three tracks – a cover version of the Duran Duran hit &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, which would become the B-side of &quot;Life Got Cold&quot;, &quot;You Freak Me Out&quot; for the film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; and a cover version of The Pointer Sisters song &quot;Jump&quot; for the film &quot;Love Actually&quot;. They also re-recorded &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot;, which was originally intended to be the fourth single from the album before it was scrapped in favour of &quot;Jump&quot;. These four tracks, alongside an altered mix of &quot;Life Got Cold&quot;, would eventually surface on a reissued version of &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, which was released on 17 November 2003.

== Music and lyrics ==

&quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; takes influence from a number of 1980s genres, such as synthpop, power pop, and new wave, and 1990s styles like big beat, drum and bass, and garage. The album received comparisons to girl groups such as Bananarama, The Bangles and Spice Girls. Similarities to Kylie Minogue and Madonna were also noted. A majority of the songs make use of guitars and electronic beats. The rise of indie rock also inspired Brian Higgins to &quot;blur the edges between commercial music and so-called &quot;indie&quot; music.&quot; He continued, &quot;pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise, through The Strokes and everything else. We were an independent company and we were as indie as the other bands around us. The guitar riff on &quot;No Good Advice&quot; is very very similar to the riff on the track &quot;Michael&quot; by Franz Ferdinand.&quot;

It was said that the album&#x27;s &quot;lyrics [were] curiously insistent upon Girls Aloud&#x27;s musical credibility and autonomy of thought.&quot; Higgins said that &quot;No Good Advice&quot; reflected his general mood of failure after a special deal between Xenomania and London Records fell through in 2000, and about persisting in spite of what people told him to do or not to do. &quot;Life Got Cold&quot; was labelled &quot;surprisingly poignant.&quot;

== Songs ==
&quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, which opens the album, drew comparisons to Fatboy Slim. It was labelled &quot;an enticing blend of spiky guitars and Fatboy Slim beats topped off with an irresistibly catchy chorus.&quot; &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; was further described as &quot;a mechanistic sashay of twangy surf guitar and sultry gang vocals – Girls Aloud explodes like a five-headed Kylie Minogue.&quot; &quot;No Good Advice&quot; was labelled &quot;a disco track with guitar – a cross between Blondie and The Bangles.&quot; Unlike many other songs, it was said to be &quot;not obsessed with trying to be a cutting-edge club hit, [...] with at least three different killer hooks welded together&quot; that borrowed heavily from the 1980s. &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot;, which is &quot;a breezy summer pop song about trying to bag a guy&quot;, follows. The Xenomania production had &quot;layered vocals with its slow tempo despite being more formulaic.&quot; The song was compared to &quot;a 21st century Bangles&quot;, as well as former Spice Girls member and &quot;&quot; judge Geri Halliwell.

&quot;All I Need (All I Don&#x27;t)&quot; was described as &quot;a Kylie-type tune set to squelchy techno&quot;, as well as &quot;a disco-funk workout with traces of Cameo and &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; vintage Madonna&quot;. &quot;Life Got Cold&quot;, the album&#x27;s first ballad and third single, was a late addition to the album, completed by Xenomania shortly before the album&#x27;s release. The song received attention because of similarities between the guitar riff of &quot;Life Got Cold&quot; and that of the Oasis hit &quot;Wonderwall&quot; (1995). Warner/Chappell Music has since credited Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher. The song was called a &quot;charming ballad&quot; that was &quot;a sweet but slightly sad pop song&quot;. The song begins with a rap. &quot;Mars Attack&quot;, produced by Betty Boo and the Beatmasters, &quot;is hip hop-referencing surf punk.&quot;

&quot;Stop&quot;, a Xenomania production sung entirely by Nadine Coyle apart from the chorus, &quot;starts like the Skids&#x27; &quot;Into the Valley&quot; but gets sultry instead of surreal.&quot; The album&#x27;s eighth track, &quot;Girls Allowed&quot;, was co-written by Westlife member Brian McFadden. It was described as both &quot;Basement Jaxx meets Spice Girls&quot; and &quot;Donna Summer meets Dannii Minogue&quot;. &quot;Forever and a Night&quot; was described as &quot;a soppy love song earmarked as a Christmas single&quot;, but slated for sounding like &quot;every girl-group slushy song ever written.&quot; &quot;Love/Hate&quot;, another song crafted by Xenomania, &quot;lays vocals over garage beats.&quot; A second contribution from Betty Boo and the Beatmasters, &quot;Boogie Down Love&quot;, follows. It was said that it &quot;mixes the hook of Blondie&#x27;s &quot;Call Me&quot; with the bells from &quot;Rapture&quot;&quot;, as well as being deemed &quot;electro stomping&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Want You Back&quot; was co-written by Anders Bagge, who also wrote Samantha Mumba&#x27;s &quot;Gotta Tell You&quot;, which bears similarities. It was labelled as &quot;love song&quot; in which Girls Aloud are &quot;swooning over bois [sic]&quot;. &quot;White Lies&quot; was co-written and produced by Tim Kellett, a former member of The Durutti Column, Simply Red, and Olive.

The original UK edition of the album featured two bonus tracks. &quot;Love Bomb&quot;, another Betty Boo collaboration, was compared to Boo&#x27;s &quot;Where Are You Baby?&quot;. &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted&quot; borrows its opening line from The Rolling Stones. In December 2003, the album was re-released with the omission of &quot;Don&#x27;t Want You Back&quot; and the bonus tracks. Three new songs appeared instead. &quot;Jump&quot;, a cover of song &quot;Jump (for My Love)&quot; by The Pointer Sisters, was recorded for the soundtrack to &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003). Cheryl Cole noted in Girls Aloud&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Dreams That Glitter – Our Story&quot; (2008) that the single &quot;was the point when we realized everything we&#x27;d been doing was quite down and moody [...] and that&#x27;s not what people wanted.&quot; &quot;You Freak Me Out&quot; is a pop-rock song that was written and recorded specifically for the Disney film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; (2003), Also included was Girls Aloud&#x27;s cover of &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, originally a Duran Duran classic, that originally appeared as a B-side to &quot;Life Got Cold&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; was released in Ireland on 23 May 2003 and in the United Kingdom and European countries three days later, through Polydor Records and Universal Music Group. The international versions of the album exclude the bonus tracks &quot;Love Bomb&quot; and &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted&quot;. A reissue of &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; was released on 17 November 2003. It replaced the original bonus tracks and &quot;Don&#x27;t Want You Back&quot; with three new songs: &quot;Jump&quot;, &quot;You Freak Me Out&quot;, and &quot;Girls on Film&quot;. The radio edit of &quot;Life Got Cold&quot; and a remix of &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot;, also replaced the original versions. Originally, the album would be promoted with a tour with their fellow &quot;Popstars: The Rivals&quot; contestants; however, the tour was cancelled due to poor ticket sales. Instead, the group promoted the album on their What Will the Neighbours Say...? Tour (2005) along with their second studio album &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; (2004). &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; and other Girls Aloud releases were made available for sale on the US iTunes Store on 26 June 2007 through Interscope Records.

On 26 March 2023, it was reported that the remaining members of Girls Aloud are to share unreleased tracks from the archives, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album. On 28 April 2023, the band released the promotional single &quot;Sound Of The Underground (Alternative Vocal Mix)&quot;, revealed the tracklisting for the forthcoming album reissue, and released a new 4k version of the original music video. The 2023 reissue will be available on vinyl for the very first time.

== Singles ==
&quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, Girls Aloud&#x27;s debut single, was released on 16 December 2002. Competing against the &quot;&quot; boyband, One True Voice, they used a combative &quot;Buy girls, bye boys&quot; slogan to persuade the public to buy their single. &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; received a positive response from most music critics. The music video was shot in a London warehouse just days after Girls Aloud&#x27;s formation in the last week of competition of &quot;Popstars: The Rivals&quot;. &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart and spent four consecutive weeks at number one, earning a platinum certification in March 2003. &quot;No Good Advice&quot; was released five months later in May 2003. In 2003, the song won the Popjustice £20 Music Prize, awarded to the best British pop single of the past year. The video for &quot;No Good Advice&quot; features the members of Girls Aloud clad in metallic, silver, futuristic outfits which can also be seen on the cover of this album. The song debuted at number two. The third single was intended to be &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot;, but was changed to fan favourite &quot;Life Got Cold&quot;. The music video depicts the band members in stunted movement, wandering around an abandoned city setting. The song failed to achieve the success of Girls Aloud&#x27;s first two singles, peaking at number three. &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot; was replaced again, this time with their cover of &quot;Jump&quot;, recorded for the &quot;Love Actually&quot; soundtrack. The music video for &quot;Jump&quot; was made to appear like it was intertwined with &quot;Love Actually&quot;. The song debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;You Freak Me Out&quot; was due for release, with Girls Aloud even performing it on television; however, Girls Aloud proceeded to record their second studio album &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; received generally favourable reviews from music critics. &quot;The Times&quot; noted that &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; &quot;is packed with everything you want from a pop record – attitude, aggression, guitars, disco beats and steals from Phil Spector.&quot; Yahoo! Music said that Girls Aloud &quot;have made a seriously fine debut album. OK, so it&#x27;s not &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, &quot;Innervisions&quot; or &quot;OK Computer&quot;, but it may well be another &quot;Spice&quot;.&quot; A number of reviews noted the high quality of the album compared to output from other reality show contestants. It was said that &quot;Girls Aloud are on the better end of the commercial pop scale.&quot; Ian Youngs of BBC News bluntly stated, &quot;Reality pop is not supposed to be this good.&quot; BBC Music said &quot;time will tell if they are set to take the mantle as the new Spice Girls or slip rapidly down pops dumper as the new Hear&#x27;Say. But their debut album is sure to shut up at least some of their cynics, myself included.&quot;

However, many reviewers agreed that the album&#x27;s quality declined towards the end. RTÉ.ie wrote, &quot;After a while it does start sounding a bit samey but for a manufactured pop album, this is a fairly standard fault.&quot; The ballads featured on &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; were slated. Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie said that &quot;the ill-advised attempt to show off their sensitive side results in some truly dismal ballads.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart behind Justin Timberlake&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Justified&quot; (2002). Selling 38,000 copies in its first week it went on to sell 300,000, achieving a platinum certificate, their first of many. Spending only eighteen weeks in the charts the album was later re-released to feature new songs. This release only managed to peak at number forty-two but is now the only commercial print of the album.

The album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 6 June 2003. It was certified platinum five months later.

<doc id="1275177" wikidata="Q7569558" url="?curid=1275177" title="Southerly buster">
<text>A southerly buster is the colloquial name of an abrupt southerly wind change in the southern regions of New South Wales and Victoria, Australia, which approaches from the southeast, mainly on a hot day, bringing in cool, usually severe weather and a dramatic temperature drop, thus ultimately replacing and relieving the prior hot conditions. 

Marking the boundary between hot and cool air masses, a southerly buster is sometimes represented by a roll-up cloud perpendicular to the coast, which appears from the south and coexists with the wind change, though sometimes there is little visual signal of the southerly&#x27;s arrival.

Southerly busters occur in the backside of a low pressure trough in the Tasman Sea, followed by the speedy advance of an anticyclone south of Western Australia and South Australia (around the Great Australian Bight). They are caused by the interaction of a shallow cold front with the blocking mountain range that aligns the coast, and frictional contrasts over the mainland and the ocean that disconnect the flow. 

Southerly busters occur about 32 times each year on the coast of southeastern Australia, with variable strength, usually in spring and summer. Although southerly busters are often associated with NSW and Victoria, they also occur on the east coast of Tasmania, New Zealand, and in Argentina and Chile. The name &#x27;southerly buster&#x27; initiated as a slang term used by Sydneysiders, though it has since evolved into an official weather attribute in the Bureau of Meteorology terminology. 

==History==
===19th century===

In 1819, Australian explorer William Wentworth describes the southerly buster experienced in Sydney:

...They [hot northwesterly winds] seldom, however, continue for more than two days at a time, and are always superseded by a cold southerly gale, generally accompanied with rain. The thermometer then sinks sometimes as low as , and a variation of temperature of from 30 to 40°F (about 17 to 22°C) takes place in half an hour. These southerly gales usually last at this season from twelve to twenty-four hours, and then give way to the regular sea and land breezes...

From the early days of settlement at Sydney Cove, sudden southerly squalls had been a problem for boats in the harbour. In 1829, a brickfielder as these squalls as were then called, laid the boat carrying Governor Ralph Darling and his family on its beam ends. Later Port Jackson boatmen would call it, the &quot;Sútherly Búster&quot;. During the early days of the European settlement, Sydney&#x27;s summer storms were accompanied by rolling red dust from the colony&#x27;s brickworks.

In 1869, following the connection of lighthouses and signal stations on the east coast of NSW to the electric telegraph network, a system was instituted to give shipping warning of approaching gales. It would give boats in Port Jackson warning of approaching busters. The new signals were included in Gowland&#x27;s amendments to the NSW Sailing Directory The signal was a diamond shape (see Day shapes) on the southern yard-arm of the signal mast to indicate a squall approaching from the south, and numeral pendants per John Nicholson&#x27;s Code of Signals flying on the masthead to show the location of the squall. The numbers were those already in use from 1842 for identifying ports, e.g. Jervis Bay was 46 and Wollongong, added in 1854, was 82. The signal masts were at South Head Signal Station and Fort Phillip. These masts had two yard-arms at right angles aligned north–south and east–west. The success of the system was seen in 1870 when a newspaper reported, &quot;About 9 o&#x27;clock, however, intelligence of a southerly burster was telegraphed from Eden, and by half-past 12 the expected &#x27;brickfielder&#x27; blew over the city.&quot;

From 1876 signals would be displayed at two additional places - the new flagstaff at Bradley&#x27;s Head and the Floating Light Vessel at the entrance to the Harbour. This direction specified that a cone signal on the flagstaff would indicate the approach of a southerly squall. This signal, &quot;A cone, with the point downwards, shows that a gale is probable; at first from the southward.&quot;, was introduced in England 1861 by Robert Fitzroy, but this appears to be the first time it was used in Port Jackson. In 1879, George Herbert Gibson published a book called &quot;Southerly Busters&quot;, where a buster wreaks havoc near Hyde Park, Sydney.

In November 1898, the Postmaster General, Varney Parkes, announced that a white flag with the letters E, J.B. or W would be flown from the flagstaff on the clock tower of the General Post Office, Sydney to signal the approach of a southerly buster. As the wind reached Eden, Jervis Bay or Wollongong the relevant flag would be hoisted. The J.B. flag was hoisted for the first time on 10 February 1899 but the wind did not travel beyond Kiama. The day had been hot and oppressive and the much anticipated cool change did not eventuate. The original intention was to change the flags as the change moved north but this did not always happen. It was possibly later reduced to just two flags, JB and W.

===20th century===

On the night of 16 December 1908 a new signal, also on the GPO clock tower, made its debut. For warnings at night a red light had been installed in the lantern - the glass enclosed room below the flagstaff. It continued until 1940. Capsizes still occurred, but fishing boats did heed the warnings.

In 1931, with the addition of signals for southerly busters, the practice of displaying the Bureau of Meteorology weather forecast with flags was extended, with the cooperation of the Royal Australian Navy, to the signal staff on Garden Island. The weather flags had been flown since 1912 from the flagstaffs on prominent buildings but as well, at Garden Island, a diamond shape would be hoisted for warnings during the day and a red light at night when a southerly buster was expected. In 1932 Navy League sea cadets flew the same signals as at Garden Island at their station on Snapper Island (New South Wales).

The Weather beacon on the top of MLC Building, North Sydney, built in 1957, could also warn of &#x27;southerly busters&#x27;. Generally, the forecasts displayed by the lights were updated three times a day but could be changed at anytime if a sudden change was imminent. If a &#x27;buster&#x27; was expected the red lights at the bottom of the beacon would flash at half second intervals. This signal, indicating strong winds and rain, was not specific to &#x27;southerly busters&#x27;, but as the jingle advised:
Flashes short, prepare for gales,
 Gather the washing, furl the sails.&quot;

Author Ruth Park makes a reference to the southerly buster in her novel &quot;Poor Man&#x27;s Orange&quot; (1949):

After an unbearably hot day, the old men on the balconies were sniffing the air and saying, &#x27;Here she comes!&#x27; The Southerly Buster, the genie of Sydney, flapped its coarse wing over the city ... The women undid the fronts of their frocks and the little children lifted up their shirts and let it blow on their sweaty bottoms.

==Formation==

On a hot day, a strong offsea gale develops from the south usually in the late afternoon and early evening, causing a rapid fall in temperature as it arrives, and sometimes a short rain and/or thunderstorm may accompany, especially if it is affiliated with a cold front coming from the south and a trough, with the strongest winds being at the leading edge of the buster. The southerly buster, which usually trails a thick layer of low stratus clouds bringing episodic drizzle, banks up against the Great Dividing Range, thus resulting in the transmission of the cool maritime air near the southeastern part of the ranges and the blocking of the airflow on the mountains&#x27; west side. The Buster progresses into a strongly stable boundary layer with warm, prefrontal landmass air that is between 100 and 200 metres deep transporting over the cooler waters.

In some occasions, a cold front in the Southern Ocean may interact with the Great Dividing Range and develop into a Southerly Buster. It is worth noting that some Southerly Busters are not southern ocean fronts, as they have developed on the pre-frontal trough south of Australia or have possibly originated on the southern NSW coast in affiliation with a shallow mesoscale low development. As the Southerly Buster advances to the north, its force would decrease, though in rare occasions it can fortify north of the Hunter Valley due to upslope motion on the valley&#x27;s north, which allows the flow to produce anticyclonic vorticity akin to the original obstruction and arrangement of the Southerly Buster in Victoria.

However, the southerly buster does not always create precipitation, aside from light drizzle and light rain, which tend to occur a day after the southerly buster&#x27;s arrival as its effects may still persist for 24 hours, in addition to creating a weather pattern similar to that of a June Gloom experienced in Southern California. It is proposed that the southerly buster is basically a coastal gravity current that is held against the mountains by the Coriolis force and in transverse geostrophic balance, and is generated when a cold front is obstructed, experiencing anticyclonic distortion near the Great Dividing Range, spreading northward as a coastal trapped orographic jet.

The southerly buster is caused by its interaction with the Great Dividing Range, as the cool air becomes trapped against the ranges, oftentimes in the Gippsland area of Victoria, where the mountains create a channelling effect as the southerly winds move across the New South Wales coast. When the inland portion of the cold front is held against the mountains, the part over the sea proceeds to move along the shore, twisting the front into an &#x27;S&#x27; shape. This activity continues on the southern New South Wales coast, while areas leading the front are still experiencing hot northwesterly winds. Other phenomena that lead to the temperature gradient between the warm air mass and the cold density current include; hot north-westerly or warm dry foehn wind that precede the squall. Furthermore, severe thunderstorms may come from the forced elevation of warm, humid air.

===Characteristics===
The main distinguishing feature of a southerly buster is the sudden, squally southerly change in wind direction which replace the continental northwesterly winds. This is accompanied by a marked temperature drop and sea level pressure rise. Wind gusts in excess of near ground level averages about three per year, which usually come about after very hot days and would tremendously ease within 30 to 60 minutes after the Buster&#x27;s arrival, becoming rather light within a few hours. A regular southerly buster is between 20 and 60 nautical miles wide, with the heavier winds concentrated on the seaward strip, with its depth being around 1000m, restricted by the height of the mountains to west.

An orographic jet, the southerly buster is clearly a mesoscale phenomenon, developing on about one day. Because busters seldom keep a staunch speed while advancing along the coast, its arrival has always been difficult to foretell, though meteorologists nowadays have the gain of satellite imagery and weather radar to foresee it, with wind warning issued by the Bureau of Meteorology. Temperature changes can be dramatic, with falls of often occurring in a few minutes. In extreme conditions, a southerly buster may lower the temperatures from to . To note, some southerly busters can be mild and not very pronounced, where they would arrive on lukewarm days and even during sultry thunderstorm events, bringing in light, though still noticeably cooler winds in the evening, with its effects still remaining in the following few days as well in some cases.

==Regions==
*In New South Wales, southerly busters generally reach their maximum intensity between Nowra in the South Coast and Newcastle, rarely passing beyond the Mid North Coast or Port Macquarie – When they do they are usually strengthened by the presence of a tropical cyclone off the north coast of the state. Sydney receives an average of about five Southerly Busters a year, mostly in late spring and early summer, with the stronger ones generally reaching the city in the late afternoon or early evening on a hot day, though at times it would arrive after several days of hot weather. It is a crucial weather feature in the Sydney area, particularly for yachtsmen. 
*In Victoria, most notably in Melbourne, southerly busters occur during the afternoons where the domineering heat, brought on by north-westerly winds from central Australia, suddenly gives way to a rapid drop in temperature, followed by rain, thunderstorms and a relatively cool night. They would reach as far inland as Swan Hill in the north and Omeo to the east, but would be less pronounced more inland to the north. Temperature drops in these parts of Victoria are more dramatic than those in the east coast of New South Wales, where a drop can occur within half an hour (part of the easily changeable weather). Southerly busters most emerge in spring, as the landmass northbound of Melbourne starts to warm up. Meanwhile, though, the Southern Ocean, which provides cool breezes to Victoria from the west, does not warm up as swiftly as the mainland. As such, the temperature difference between hot air from the north and cold from the ocean would be very great, thus providing good conditions for the formation of thunderstorms.
*In South Australia, Mount Gambier would the most affected by southerly busters in the state due to its southeasterly location. The buster may also reach Adelaide and Whyalla in some occasions.
*In Western Australia, the Buster occasionally reaches Eucla due to its location near the Southern Ocean in the warm months, where it can experience dramatic temperature drops.
*In Wellington, New Zealand these storms are normally short and frequently have winds gusting between 120 km/h and 160 km/h though higher speeds are known.
*In South America, these southerly fronts frequently encroach on the southern coast of Chile and Argentina and would then advance northwards on both sides of the Andes.

===Records===
The strongest recorded southerly buster fell around 4:30 pm on 12 March 2010 in Wellington, New Zealand, with a maximum gust recorded of .
Henry Ambrose Hunt in &quot;An Essay on Southerly Bursters&quot; included the Dandenong Gale in his list of bursters and wrote &quot;the wind attained, locally, to the abnormal velocity of in a gust, the rate of one hundred and twelve miles for ten minutes and fifty seven miles per hour for nine hours.&quot; The sail-steamer &quot;Dandenong&quot; foundered off Jervis Bay during the gale with the loss of forty lives. - hence the name of the gale.

This velocity is no longer officially recognised but the &#x27;Kurnell Tornado&#x27; in December 2015 shows gusts in excess of are possible in the area, and the day before the tornado the possibility of a southerly buster on the following day had been proposed.

The strongest southerly buster on record at Sydney Airport occurred at 6:40 pm on 18 December 1948 with a maximum wind gust of . The second strongest Southerly Buster on record in Sydney reached a maximum gust of at 5:22 pm on 8 January 2003.

==Incidents==

*On 15 January 2001, a southerly buster with a maximum gust of 100 km/h caused blackouts, property damage and uprooted trees in the Greater Sydney area.
*On 8 January 2003, a southerly buster in Sydney brought thunderstorms with small hail, where 70 suburbs lost power due to the lightning strikes.
*On 21 November 2016, at around 6pm, a powerful southerly change occurred in Melbourne, which resulted in the death of 10 people who were asthmatic and succumbed to respiratory failure. Thousands of others across the city experienced allergic reactions and asthma-like symptoms triggered by the storm. This was due to a stark southerly wind (60 km/hour) that distributed ryegrass pollen into the moist air, rupturing them into very fine specks, small enough particles to enter people&#x27;s lungs, as they were sucked up into the warm updraft of air forming the storm cells, before they returned to earth in the storm&#x27;s cool down-draft, spreading across the land in the storm&#x27;s efflux area. Hospitals and medical centres in the city had to arduously manage 8,500 emergency calls in the space of just five hours, and the hospitalisation of 1,400 people.

<text>Luisiana, officially the Municipality of Luisiana (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 20,859 people.

Locals call the town &quot;Little Baguio of Laguna&quot; because of its high elevation and cool climate like the City of Baguio. 

==History==

During the 17th century, there was an area of land in Laguna known as &quot;Terreno de Nasonog&quot; (&quot;Lupaín ng Nasonog&quot; in Tagalog). In 1678, Terreno de Nasúnog was divided into three parts: Nasúnog de Lucban, Nasonog de Cavinti, and Nasúnog de Majayjay.

Nasonog de Majayjay later became the town of Luisiana. It was only on April 3, 1854, that ecclesiastical independence was granted to Nasonog by the Governor-General (the Marqués de Novaliches) with the corresponding approval from the Archbishop of Manila, having Don Marcos Bartolomé as its first interim parish priest. Because of the role of Don Luis Bernárdo, which was then regarded as the Father of Luisiana, and his wife Doña Ana, the town was named &#x27;Luis y Ana&#x27;, later changed to &#x27;Luisiana&#x27;.

In 1903, the towns of Cavinti and Luisiana were combined, Pedro Villanueva of Cavinti was elected mayor and it was during his term that the Aglipay Church was founded in April 1904. The Romana family funded the construction of a couple of Protestant churches. However, in 1907, durin the leadership of Don Blas Oración, through the Civil Commission, Cavinti separated from Luisiana and became an independent town.

In 1948, Visita de Luisiana gained civil independence from Majayjay.

<doc id="1275197" wikidata="Q32307" url="?curid=1275197" title="Islam in Ghana">
<text>Islam was the first Abrahamic religion to arrive in Ghana. Today, it is the second most widely professed religion in the country behind Christianity. Its presence in Ghana dates back to the 10th century. According to the Ghana Statistical Service&#x27;s Population and Housing census (2021), the percentage of Muslims in Ghana is about 19.9%.

According to a comprehensive report by the Association of Religion Data Archives, 63.2% of Muslims are followers of Sunni Islam, while approximately 36.8% belong to the Ahmadiyya movement. Among Sunni Muslims, the Maliki school of jurisprudence is the most common, though Afa Ajura&#x27;s reformist activities in the 1960s saw a rise in popularity of the Hanbali school, particularly as informed by the Salafi movement. Sufism, once widespread, has waned considerably over the years; the Tijaniyyah and the Qadiriyyah Sufi orders, however, are still represented among Ghana&#x27;s traditionalist Muslims.

Muslims and Christians in Ghana have had excellent relations. Guided by the authority of the Muslim Representative Council, religious, social, and economic matters affecting Muslims have often been redressed through negotiations. The National Hajj Council observes the responsibility of arranging pilgrimages to Mecca for believers who can afford the journey. The National Chief Imam of Ghana is the highest authority on Muslim affairs in Ghana.

Some metropolitan areas and cities, especially in areas with a significant Muslim population, have Islamic or Arabic schools offering primary, junior secondary, senior secondary and tertiary education.

==History==
Islam was introduced by traders from the Sahel regions of West Africa. Prior to that, Da&#x27;wah workers had made contact and written extensively about the people including inhabitants of Bonoman states located in the hinterlands of contemporary Ghana.
The introduction of Islam into Ghana was mainly the result of the commercial activities of Mande and Hausa speaking traders.

Islam spread through several pathways; the Mande came through the north and north-western corridors of Ghana while the Borno and Hausa traders came from the north-east. Islam is thought to have successfully penetrated southern Ghana following the &quot;collapse of the Bono and the Begho states, and its increase was encouraged by the fact that the slave trade became more lucrative and competitive&quot;. Furthermore, the British colonial administration in the nineteenth century enlisted people from various northern predominantly Muslim communities into the colonial army. Finally, the mass exodus of immigrants into forest areas of Ghana following the &quot;1892 Sack of Salaga&quot; by joint incursion by Dagomba, Namumba and Gonja tribes depleted Muslim populations in the north while boosting that of the south.

==Demographics ==
 
The Muslim population is concentrated in northern Ghana and in Zongo communities scattered across the country. Zongo communities are settlements predominated by immigrants from Sahelian areas of West Africa (Mandinka, Soninke, Hausa, Songhai, Fulani, etc.) who have adopted the Hausa language as a lingua franca. Members of the Zongo community are mistakenly but commonly regarded as Northerners. However, the two communities are distinct, having different cultures and languages.

The official Ghana Statistical Service census reports approximately 20% as being Muslims although that figure is being protested by independent organizations. The Coalition of Muslim Organizations maintain that the final figures released in 2002 &quot;contained serious flaws and as a result could not be used as reliable data for planning and projecting the country’s development agenda&quot;. The call came at the same time groups mainly from the North petitioned the government to withdraw the results, expressing concern that some ethnic groups were underrepresented in the population count and that the service should open up their procedures for public scrutiny. CIA statistics put the population of Muslims in Ghana at 17.6 percent. Other accounts place the figure at 25 percent. The government of Ghana&#x27;s allocation of funds for national development is heavily influenced by population demographics.

=== Geographical distribution ===
According to the 2017 Census, Muslims constitute about 20 percent of the population of Ghana. 
Muslims constitute a majority in Northern Region, the biggest religion in Upper East Region and a large minority Upper West Region. There a slightly less Muslims in the southern parts of Ghana.

==Sub groups==

===Ahmadiyya===
The Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama&#x27;at was formally established in 1921. By 1957, it had attracted about 100,000 converts, mostly from Muslim and Christian backgrounds. The first Ahmadi missionary to Ghana, Maulvi Abdul Rahim Nayyar, came upon invitation from Muslims in Saltpond. According to the Pew &quot;The World&#x27;s Muslims&quot; survey, 16% of Ghanaian respondents indicated that they identify with the Ahmadiyya movement.

===Sunni===

Islam reached the kingdom of Ghana during the ninth and tenth centuries, during a period of trade and competition with the Berbers of North Africa, who had adopted Sunni Islam, according to the Maliki rite of jurisprudence. By the 14th century, Ghanaian kingdoms featured mosques and palaces, as well as Arabic-style Muslim poetry.

Contemporary Sunnism in Ghana includes a majority that follows the Maliki school, which is predominant in West and North Africa, as well as a large contingent that follows the Hanbali school as interpreted by the Salafi movement.

The Sufi orders have a historic presence in Ghana and, as with much of West Africa, the predominant orders are the Tijaniyya and the Qadiriyya. Sufism is common among the immigrant Muslim population of Ghana, also known as the Zongos. About 37 percent of Muslims in Ghana say they belong to a Sufi order.

Salafism was introduced into Ghana as part of the 1940s reformist activities of the late Ghanaian Imam, Afa Ajura. Ajura&#x27;s campaign challenged the mainstream of Ghanaian Sunnism, which followed the Maliki school of jurisprudence and the Ash&#x27;ari school of theology. It was not until the 1970s that his movement gained popularity. From the onset of Ajura&#x27;s mission, Salafism has been primarily propagated across Ghana in his native Dagbanli language. Recently Salafis in Zongo communities in southern Ghana (18% of Muslims) have formed the &quot;Ahlusunnah wal Jamaa&quot; (ASWaJ) organization in order to reach the Hausa-speaking population. ASWaJ still draws inspiration from their parent Anbariyya leadership, headed by Afa Seidu in Tamale.

===Shia===

Shia Islam is also present in Ghana, primarily among the Lebanese immigrant community that arrived starting in the 1980s. 8% of percent of Ghana&#x27;s Muslim population identify as Shi&#x27;i. Shias freely operate religious schools and mosques.

<text>The Frisian National Party (; , FNP) is a Frisian nationalist political party in the Netherlands. The FNP is mostly involved in Frisian politics. The Independent Senate Group represents the FNP on a national level, the EFA represents the FNP on a European level.

==History==
The party was founded in 1962 by young activists of the Frisian movement (), which developed in the 19th century. It advocated the importance of the (West) Frisian language, culture and sports. The movement was founded in reaction to the use of Dutch in sermons of Dutch Reformed Churches in Friesland. The Frisian movement has links with the reformed Anti-Revolutionary Party; however, in the 1962 provincial elections, it claimed that Frisian interests were less important than Dutch national interests.

In 1966, it won its first seat in the provincial legislature and municipal councils. In 1995, it cooperated with provincial parties and the Greens to get a seat in the Senate, which is elected indirectly, in the so-called Independent Senate Group. Between 1995 and 2003, it was taken by a member of the Greens, since 2003 it is taken by a member of the FNP.

==Ideology==
The FNP is a nationalist party which advocates a federal political system in which Frisians get more autonomy or independence. It calls for greater autonomy of the region, government use, protection and recognition of the Frisian language and Frisian control over its gas reserves.

According to a survey of 554 party members done by the European Policies Research Centre at the University of Strathclyde in 2009, 5.05% of members identified as far-left on the political spectrum, 13.9% as left-wing, 28.16% as centre-left, 17.51% as centrist, 14.98% as centre-right, 7.4% as right-wing, and 2.53% as far-right, with 10.47% unsure.

==Representation==
Since 1995, the party cooperated with several provincial parties and the Greens in the Independent Senate Fraction which had one seat in the Senate. From 2003 till 2011 and 2015 till 2019 this seat was taken by Hendrik ten Hoeve, a member of the FNP. In 2019, the seat was taken by Gerben Gerbrandy also a member of the FNP.

The party has four (out of 43) seats in the Frisian provincial legislative and is part of the provincial government since 2011.

The party has 49 members in 11 of the 18 Frisian municipal councils. It cooperates in the local executive of Tytsjerksteradiel, Waadhoeke, and Noardeast-Fryslân. In Wûnseradiel and Achtkarspelen the party supplied the mayor. In 2020 the party supplies the Mayor in Noardeast-Fryslân.

The party has good relations with other provincial parties like Party New Limburg with which it together forms the Independent Senate Group. Historically, it cooperated very well with the Political Party of Radicals, a left-wing Christian party.

On the European level, the party is a member of the European Free Alliance, although it has no seats in the European Parliament.

==Electoral performance==
The party&#x27;s electorate is limited to Friesland, where it dominates in the Western and North-Eastern part of the mainland of the province. In rural Littenseradiel, the FNP got nearly 28% of the votes and became the largest party in 2003.

In 2010, 33.9% of the people voted FNP in rural Skarsterlân.

<text>Glorious is the title of English comedian Eddie Izzard&#x27;s 1997 performance at the Hammersmith Apollo. The performance was released on VHS and covers topics such as the siege of Troy, Noah&#x27;s Ark, the Royal Family, and the birth of baby Jesus. In many ways, the flow of topics follow from the Bible, starting with the beginning of time according to the Old Testament and ending with Armageddon according to the Book of Revelation, though they are covered in Izzard&#x27;s usual surreal style.

<text>Point Douglas is a provincial electoral district in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is named for a part of the city that is surrounded by a bend in the Red River. The riding covers the neighbourhoods of William Whyte, Dufferin Industrial, North Point Douglas, Lord Selkirk Park and South Point Douglas plus parts of St. John&#x27;s Park, St. John&#x27;s, Inkster-Faraday, Burrows Central, Robertson, Dufferin, Logan C.P.R., Civic Centre and the Exchange District. It was also Winnipeg&#x27;s only government supported red light district.

==History==

The division was created by redistribution for the 1969 provincial election, eliminated in 1978 into Burrows, Logan and St. Johns. It was re-established in 1989 from parts of Burrows, Logan, St. Johns and a small part of Sevenoaks. It is located in north-central Winnipeg, and includes the Point Douglas neighbourhood.

Point Douglas is bordered to the east by St. Boniface and Elmwood, to the south by Logan, to the north by St. Johns, and to the west by Burrows, Wellington and Minto. Different parts of the division are included in the federal ridings of Winnipeg Centre and Winnipeg North.

Point Douglas is named after Thomas Douglas, the 5th Earl of Selkirk, who established the Red River Colony in 1812. His namesake, twentieth-century politician Tommy Douglas, also lived in the Point Douglas neighbourhood in the early 1910s.

The Manitoba New Democratic Party has won every election in the constituency.

<doc id="1275231" wikidata="Q664237" url="?curid=1275231" title="The Beast (roller coaster)">
<text>The Beast is a wooden roller coaster located at Kings Island amusement park in Mason, Ohio, United States. Designed and manufactured in-house for approximately $3 million, the ride opened in 1979 as the tallest, fastest, and longest wooden roller coaster in the world. Decades later, it is still the longest, spanning across of hilly terrain. Two lift hills contribute to the ride&#x27;s duration of more than four minutes, which also ranks as one of the longest among roller coasters. A refurbishment in 2022 increased the angle of the first drop and lengthened the ride by .

The Beast was designed over the course of two years without assistance from scientific calculators or computers. Lead engineers Al Collins and Jeff Gramke consulted with well-known coaster architect , who shared design formulas and strategies to assist during development. Issues discovered during early testing delayed plans to build an enclosure over the helix finale until 1980. Ruth Voss, the park&#x27;s public relations manager who would often overhear construction crews calling it &quot;a beast of a project&quot;, is credited with coming up with the ride&#x27;s name in early 1979.

The record-breaking coaster was well-received at a press event preview held on April 13, 1979. Since its opening, The Beast has consistently ranked in the top ten among wooden coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards publication from &quot;Amusement Today&quot;. It has also earned a favorable reputation across the industry, including praise from American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE), which held one of its first official events at Kings Island in 1979. ACE awarded the ride its Roller Coaster Landmark designation in 2004. After more than 40 years, it also remains one of the most popular rides at Kings Island, having accommodated over 54 million riders.

== History ==
Ruth Voss, public relations manager for Kings Island amusement park, issued a press release on July 10, 1978, announcing plans for a new roller coaster. The statement read, &quot;Kings Island Family Entertainment Center will open America’s champion roller coaster in the spring of 1979.&quot; It was the first official announcement from the park, who had been secretly planning the new ride for three years. Looking to replicate the national exposure received from popular rides such as The Racer and record-breaking events including Evel Knievel&#x27;s nationally televised bus jump in 1975, Kings Island sought to keep the momentum going by introducing another record-breaking attraction.

Original plans focused on building a replica of the Shooting Star, a popular roller coaster which once operated at Coney Island in Cincinnati. Charles Dinn – director of the Kings Island&#x27;s construction, maintenance and engineering division – had recorded measurements of the Shooting Star&#x27;s layout and dimensions prior to its demolition in 1971. The park later selected an area near The Racer where the replica would be built. Eventually, park management decided to suspend plans for the Shooting Star replica in favor of building a bigger design. The Shooting Star would later be resurrected as Mighty Canadian Minebuster at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, which opened in 1981. For the 1979 coaster, Kings Island set a goal to build an attraction that would transcend the Shooting Star&#x27;s nostalgia and appeal to a wider audience.

===Design and construction===
A wooded area in the southeast corner of the park spanning was selected as the site for the new project. The area&#x27;s naturally-occurring, rugged terrain consisted of cliffs, hills, and ravines. Utilizing the landscape, as opposed to leveling it, saved money and allowed for more investment in the layout itself. Beginning in 1976, chief engineer and surveyor Al Collins, along with his assistant Jeff Gramke, spent two years researching and designing the new roller coaster with the help of Dinn and his team, who surveyed major roller coasters across the country. Collins and Gramke would progress through tens of thousands of formulas needed to produce record-breaking results without the assistance of scientific calculators or computers. &quot;Everything had to be calculated by hand&quot;, recalled Gramke in 2014. John C. Allen, world-renowned coaster designer behind The Racer, was asked to lead the design but declined due to pending retirement. He shared design formulas, however, and acted as a consultant throughout development. Among his important contributions were the design of several components, including a tire-driven launch system that increased capacity above 1,000 riders per hour.
The original plans for the Beast featured an airtime hill after the first tunnel followed by a left turn and a double down. After the second lift hill, passengers would approach a trick track element and a right-handed double helix. This helix is a mirror image of the one that is used today.

Primary design and construction was handled internally by Kings Island Engineering and Construction under the direction of Dinn. Part of the design work was subcontracted to Curtis D. Summers, Inc., a structural engineering and architecture firm located in Cincinnati. Summers was tasked with designing the roller coaster footings – underground, steel-reinforced concrete pillars that support the weight of the structure – as well as a cable system for the coaster&#x27;s helix finale. The collaboration between Dinn and Summers would later lead to the pair teaming up and forming the Dinn Corporation, a construction firm that designed and built eleven coasters in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The initial land grading prep work began in May 1978. Vertical construction of the coaster officially began the following month on June 10. By November 9, 1978, approximately 60 percent of the ride was complete, which included both of the ride&#x27;s lift hills and its three tunnels. By March 1979, the remaining construction work was completed. Materials used throughout the project included of lumber, 82,480 bolts, 5,180 washers, of nails, and of poured concrete. The ride cost at least $3.2 million, equivalent to $ million in .

The Beast&#x27;s final design featured two vertical drops of , and it incorporated an overall elevation change of . Its three underground tunnels were designed by Jim Kiosky, with one at the base of the first drop and two more approximately a third of the way into the track layout. The trains were manufactured by Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters, Allen&#x27;s employer, who also implemented their &quot;buzz bar&quot; restraints. An early iteration of the train&#x27;s design was based on the traditional mine car concept, which employed headlamps at the front of each train. Late changes scrapped the mine car theme in favor of a flame-colored paint scheme, and a sculpted logo was attached at the front in place of the headlamps. The logo, created by national advertising firm Lawler Ballard Little, would receive an award from The Advertising Club of New York later that year.

Early testing revealed issues in the design of the final helix track element. The amount of side acceleration the trains experienced was more than the design intended, so the entire helix was reconstructed with a wider diameter. The delay forced Kings Island to forego the enclosing of the helix, which would eventually happen the following off-season. Also at the first tunnel&#x27;s exit, it was discovered that additional banking was needed to reduce stress on the structure. Engineers managed to complete the feat overnight, considering most of the coaster&#x27;s track was relatively close to the ground and large cranes were not needed. In the late 1970s, engineers didn&#x27;t have the benefit of computerized devices that could measure force, and they didn&#x27;t use test dummies which are common in modern-day construction. Instead, crew members of The Beast&#x27;s construction team had to board the ride for test runs and push the train back to the station whenever it stalled.

===Opening and early modifications===
Several months before its scheduled opening as construction was nearing completion, the attraction was still without a name. Voss often overheard construction crews referring to the project as &quot;a monster&quot; or calling it &quot;a beast of a project&quot;. She pitched the idea of naming it &quot;The Beast&quot; to executives who unanimously agreed. To promote the new ride, an animated commercial was released, along with a number of radio contests that granted winners the opportunity to be among the first to ride. After more than three years of planning, design, and construction, The Beast opened to the public on April 14, 1979, the first day of Kings Island&#x27;s 1979 operating season. At the time, The Beast was the tallest, fastest, and longest wooden roller coaster in the world.

Within a few years of the ride&#x27;s opening, the configuration of the original trains were modified. They were originally longer, consisting of five cars with four rows each (20 rows), but the longer length negatively impacted navigation along the track and caused a conflict with the ride&#x27;s safety control system. The trains were shortened to six cars with three rows each (18 rows), reducing the number of riders from 40 to 36. Guests waiting to board in the station will notice that some of the queue gates do not match up to the rows on the train, which is an anomaly that has been present in the station ever since this change was made. The ride also originally featured three underground tunnels, but the second and third were joined together by the second season of operation. The previously-unfinished double helix was also enclosed in time for the second season, resulting in the addition of two separate tunnels.

===2000–present===
Kings Island unveiled Son of Beast in 2000, marketed as a &quot;sequel&quot; to The Beast, located in another area of the park. It became the tallest and fastest wooden roller coaster in the world, as well as the first modern-day wooden coaster to feature an inversion. Although Son of Beast set several new records, The Beast retained its wooden coaster records for length and ride duration. Son of Beast was demolished in 2012 following a series of incidents that halted operation in 2009.

In 2019, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of The Beast, each of its three trains were restored to their original &quot;flame-themed&quot; paint scheme, and the painted paw prints that once lead up to the ride&#x27;s entrance were also restored. Following the 2021 season, approximately of track was refurbished by The Gravity Group. Two of the ride&#x27;s signature elements were reprofiled to provide a smoother ride. The first drop was increased from 45 to 53 degrees, affecting the transition from the first tunnel into the second drop, and the helix finale was modified to improve the distribution of force. was completely re-tracked, and the overall length of the ride was slightly increased by to .

==Ride experience==
===Queue===
After entering through the main entrance, guests proceed down a walkway that winds left. One or two smaller queue areas may be active depending on the number of guests waiting to ride. The path eventually leads up a ramp, in which signs are on display containing historical facts about The Beast. The inside of the station resembles an old mining facility. Warning signs are displayed stating to secure loose articles, along with promotional material with ominous warnings about the upcoming &quot;Beast&quot; encounter. Guests proceed through one last sub-queue within the station before boarding.

===Layout===
The train exits the station making a winding right turn and traveling through a switch track – used to divert trains to a covered storage area. A small prop area designed to resemble a mineshaft can be seen on the right as the train passes. A small left turn then leads the train into the first of two chain lift hills, along with a slow climb to . Dramatic music is played over a speaker as a recorded announcement reminds guests to remain seated throughout the ride. After cresting the top, the train plunges at a 53-degree angle, entering a underground tunnel and passing an on-ride camera. This is followed by a sharp left turn into a airtime hill with a drop at a 32-degree angle.

The train climbs upward, makes a right turn, and speeds into a covered brake shed. A series of magnetic trim brakes engage and slow the train as needed, followed by a turn to the right through a heavily wooded area. Veering left, the track enters a second tunnel that spans . A quarter of the tunnel is underground, and the train exits above ground gaining speed and veering right, which leads into another hard right turn on a slight incline. The train descends downhill, rises uphill, and then passes over a set of trim brakes before entering the second lift hill. 

After climbing , the train turns left and begins a gradual drop at 18.5 degrees. The track tilts to the left as the train enters a double helix that features a highly banked turn to the left. The drop is the longest on the ride, measuring . The signature double helix features two long tunnels and turns riders counterclockwise twice at high speeds while ascending. After exiting, the train dips through another small hill into the final brake run before returning to the station.

==Records==
When it opened in 1979, The Beast set several world records among roller coasters including height, speed, and track length. It still retains the record for length among wooden coasters at , which continues to be recognized by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;. The Beast is also known to have one of the longest ride times at 4 minutes and 10 seconds.

The Beast has held world records for the following:
* Tallest wooden roller coaster at , tied with Screamin&#x27; Eagle at Six Flags St. Louis when it opened
* Longest drop on a wooden roller coaster at 
* Fastest wooden roller coaster at 
** If the brakes were applied, the maximum speed decreased to .
* Longest track length on a wooden roller coaster at 

==Awards and rankings==
The Beast has been well received since its debut. Members of American Coaster Enthusiasts (ACE), an organization that held one of its first official events at Kings Island in 1979, ranked the roller coaster as the &quot;most outstanding thrill ride&quot; in 1981. Additionally, the coaster ranked second on &quot;Roller Coaster&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the top ten rides in 1988. The Beast has also consistently ranked among the top wooden roller coasters in the world in the annual Golden Ticket Awards publication from &quot;Amusement Today&quot;, placing in the top 10 consecutively for more than two decades.

In 2004, ACE designated The Beast a Roller Coaster Landmark, and there is a plaque commemorating the achievement located near the main entrance to the ride. By 2019, The Beast had accommodated over 54 million riders, which at the time had ranked third among active Kings Island attractions.

<text>Jair Ventura Filho (born 25 December 1944), better known as Jairzinho (), is a Brazilian former professional footballer. A quick, skillful, and powerful right winger known for his finishing ability and eye for goal, he was a key member and leading scorer of the legendary Brazil national team that won the 1970 FIFA World Cup.

Jairzinho was nicknamed &quot;the Hurricane&quot; () in reference to the way his jersey would shake as he ran down the wing during his playing days. A versatile forward, he was also capable of playing in a variety of other attacking positions, as a main striker, second striker, or even as an attacking midfielder. He was known for his large afro towards the later stages of his career, as well as his burst of pace, dribbling, ball skills, finishing ability, shot power and physical strength due to his large muscular build. He is widely considered one of the greatest Brazilian players of all time.

Due to the economic and political situation of the time, as well as the Sport Legislation, Jairzinho played most of his club football in South America where he spent eleven years at Rio de Janeiro club Botafogo. He went on to play in Europe for Olympique de Marseille during the final years of his career, a common pattern for South American players until the 1980s, when the economic and political situation changed. Jairzinho replaced his footballing idol Garrincha in both the Botafogo and Brazil teams, and played in three consecutive World Cups: 1966, 1970 and 1974.

==Early years==
Jair Ventura Filho was born on 25 December 1944 in Rio de Janeiro, Jairzinho&#x27;s family left Duque de Caxias for Rio in the late 50s. Living on Rua General Severiano where he went through the youth setup at local club Botafogo.

==Club career==
===Botafogo===

Jairzinho started his football career in 1958 aged 13 assigned to the Botafogo youth teams and working as a ball boy for the first team. He made his professional debut with the club as a striker at the age of fifteen in 1960. His idol Garrincha, whom he would eventually replace for both club and country, also played at Botafogo, albeit in Jairzinho&#x27;s preferred position on the right wing. This resulted in Jairzinho spending most of his early games playing on the left wing or as a centre forward. However, he would fill in as a right winger, by far his strongest position, when Garrincha was injured.

Jairzinho finally established himself as a Botafogo regular in 1965 aged 21 and was seen as a phenomenal rising star to the entire nation. During this young age he was already playing with Brazil and Botafogo superstars such as Gérson, Mario Zagallo and Garrincha.
In 1968, Botafogo won the Brazilian double. Winners of the 1968 Campeonato Carioca and the Taça Guanabara in which Jairzinho would score 9 goals in 11 games. By this time Garrincha had already left Botafogo in 1966 and would enable Jairzinho to play in his natural right wing position. Botafogo would then top off the year with a 3rd trophy towards the end of the year winning the 1968 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A (Taça Brasil) The following 1969 Campeonato Carioca season he would score 7 goals, progressing onto the next 1970 Campeonato Carioca just before the World Cup Jairzinho would finish Botafogo&#x27;s top scorer with 9 goals.

After Jairzinho&#x27;s excellent display in Mexico at the 1970 FIFA World Cup more eyes of the world were focused on his Botofogo side. In the final four years of his time at Botafogo he&#x27;d prove to finalise himself as one of the club&#x27;s most prolific goalscorers in the history of single starred Brazilian club, scoring 186 goals in 416 appearances with a goals per game ratio of 0,45. He ranks 6th in all time top goal scorers for Botafogo. One of his most standout performances starred in 1972 in which he scored a hattrick vs Flamengo during a famous 6–0 victory, one of the most memorable in Botafogo&#x27;s history. In the same year he would also receive the Bronze Award for the South American Footballer of the Year.

===Marseille===

In 1974, when the sports legislation in Brazil finally changed, Jairzinho made a 1,250,000 FF (€300,000, £250,000) move to Ligue 1 side Olympique de Marseille, in October. One of the most expensive signings at the time, along with his Botafogo and Brazil teammate Paulo Cézar Caju.

Jairzinho was welcomed as a superstar by the OM fans, the day before his debut game against AS Monaco more than 10,000 fans came to attend the training session in order to watch his first moments at the club. Jairzinho scored in his first game vs Monaco in a 4–1 victory and was immediately seen as a prominent world class winger to dominate European football.

Jairzinho would go on to score 9 goals in only 18 league games, also notably delivering a memorable performance against FC Nantes in a victory 4–0 in the Coupe de France, scoring 2 goals. Though he made an impact with his goals and aura, his time ended shortly at the French side due to a scuffle in which both Jairzinho and Caju were allegedly found guilty of attacking one of the assistant referees, after a 2–2 draw in the first leg of the Coupe de France quarter-final against Paris Saint-Germain. The &quot;Groupement du football professionnel&quot; (the former LFP) suspended him and Caju for one year (plus one suspended), thus end up leaving in the summer of 1975.

===Kaizer Chiefs===
According to Jairzinho, Kaizer Chiefs co-owner Ewert Nene invited him to play a few games in reaction to his Marseille departure. Jairzinho agreed a short term deal until the start of 1976.

The stadium atmosphere each time he went on the pitch, the warm welcome, and the fact that he was &quot;treated like a king&quot; were the key reasons he agreed to sign, he subsequently said in an interview with the South African newspaper &quot;Soccer Laduma&quot; in 2018.

Jairzinho rarely played for the Chiefs though in only 3 league games, he scored 7 goals during his time in South Africa.

===Cruzeiro===
After the end of Jairzinho&#x27;s contract in South Africa, he would finally rejoin his home country and reestablish himself as the world class forward he was known for. Jairzinho signed with Cruzeiro at the beginning of 1976, just days before the season campaign started.

Jairzinho would score 31 goals in 43 games across all competitions, finishing second highest goal scorer in the 1976 Copa Libertadores with 12 goals in 12 appearances whilst also winning the trophy, the first one for the brazilian club. Cruzeiro would then go on to play and ultimately be defeated at the 1976 Intercontinental Cup against Bayern Munich, losing the first leg 2–0 in Germany and drawing 0–0 at home.

Jairzinho would only spend a year at Cruzeiro, however a successful period.

===Portuguesa===
Jairzinho, while aged 32 and still seen as a naturally gifted player, surprised his pairs when joining Venezuelan side Portuguesa in 1977.

Jairzinho made Portuguesa one of the greatest teams in Venezuelan history, helping Portuguesa win a record 16 games in a row and their fourth of five championships. He scored 22 league goals within 24 games, including 3 hattricks.

===Noroeste and Fast Clube===
Towards the final stages of his career, Jairzinho would have a brief spell at Brazilian club Noroeste competing in the 1978 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, in which Jairzinho would score 10 goals.

A year later Jairzinho would join 2nd tier Campeonato Amazonense side Fast Clube and would score another 10 goals throughout the year.

===Jorge Wilstermann and return to Botafogo===
In 1980, Jairzinho signed for Bolivian side Club Deportivo Jorge Wilstermann aged 35, scoring 6 goals in the Bolivian league campaign.

In 1981, Jairzinho would return to Botafogo for the last true season of his career in which he would be idolised by the upcoming youth players. He would score 1 goal in a friendly match in 1981 however featured in no competitive arrangement.

==International career==
Jairzinho made his international debut as a 19 year old in 1964 against Portugal, again when Garrincha was injured. He played in the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, however with Garrincha back in the side he played as a left winger. Jairzinho struggled to be effective in this position especially at his young age, and he couldn&#x27;t prevent Brazil from exiting the competition at the first round. When, after the tournament, Garrincha announced his retirement from international football, Jairzinho finally took over his idol&#x27;s role for Brazil on the right wing. Jairzinho scored 2 goals out of the 6 1970 FIFA World Cup qualification matches.

Now in his favourite position, Jairzinho became a far more effective and consistent performer for country. At the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, Jairzinho was one of stars of the tournament. He made history by scoring in every game Brazil played in for the Seleção, for which he received the epithet &quot;Furacão da Copa&quot; (&quot;World Cup Hurricane&quot;). His second goal vs Czechoslovakia was one of the best goals of the tournament, completing an incredible solo run, beating a total of 4 players to unleash a powerful low driven shot to ripple the bottom left corner, which goes down as one of the most memorable goals in World Cup history.

He scored his seventh goal of the tournament in Brazil&#x27;s 4–1 world cup win over Italy in the final. However, his impressive goals tally at the finals were not enough to win the Golden Boot, which went to Germany&#x27;s Gerd Müller, who scored ten goals. Jairzinho has claimed that FIFA awarded him a &quot;best body on the planet&quot; prize for his athleticism; however, FIFA has no record of this award.

Jairzinho scored two goals in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, which would prove to be his last World Cup for Brazil. The third-place final was his last match for Brazil until he was given a one-off farewell cap against Czechoslovakia on 3 March 1982 in a game which Brazil drew 1–1. He scored 33 goals in 81 games during his international career.

==Style of play==
Jairzinho was feared as a versatile forward who could cause damage and impose a severe goal threat from any position on the field. He possessed high athlete level pace and a quick burst of acceleration, an excellent first touch and direct dribbling ability, however Jairzinho&#x27;s most unique attribute was his strength.

On countless occasions many opposition defences would attempt to double up on Jairzinho and try deny him space in an effort to deny his direct goal threat imposed by his athleticism. He would apply himself as a hard working team player who would consistently track back and use his body structure to prevent opposition counter attacks by blocking or tracking runs.

Jairzinho&#x27;s movement off the ball was one of the key aspects on which he accumulated so many goals throughout his career. In the 1970 FIFA World Cup he displayed his attacking instincts, especially with his goal vs England which earned Brazil the victory and broke the deadlock. The secondary run off Pelé for him to strike a powerful top left corner finish displayed his threat in front of goal as well as his overall attacking intelligence.

His finishing ability was regularly acclaimed by many coaches and teammates. The timing, accuracy and power Jairzinho would develop behind his shooting were almost perfect and very challenging for goalkeepers to reach at full stretch. He also possessed powerful and accurate shots with his left foot which acclaimed him as a complete forward.

As well as his effective attacking play Jairzinho possessed many talents on the ball and what many destined as &quot;phenomenal technical ability&quot;. One of his signature moves included flicking the ball up from a pass in open play within the boundaries of the opposition box and cushioning the ball perfectly for an open shot. In terms of technical ability he also possessed smart creativity, which was best displayed from the cross Jairzinho put in for Pelé vs England following the famous Gordon Banks save. Some claim Jairzinho is one of the most complete forwards of all time.

==Managerial career==
After retiring as a footballer, Jairzinho became a coach and managed a number of youth teams in his native Brazil. He also worked in Japan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In 1997, Jairzinho began his first journey as manager in Europe being appointed at Greek Super League club Kalamata. He was sacked due to poor results, his side relegated at the end of the season. Jairzinho was named head coach of the Gabon national team. However, he was sacked by Gabon&#x27;s Football Federation after a crushing defeat against Angola in a World Cup 2006 Qualifier held in Luanda. Perhaps his greatest achievement as a coach was spotting Ronaldo as a 14-year-old whilst he was coaching São Cristóvão. He kick-started the career of the future three-time FIFA World Player of the Year by recommending him to Cruzeiro, his former side, and the Brazil youth team.

<text>The Singapore Premier League, commonly abbreviated as the SPL, officially known as the [[AIA Group|AIA]] Singapore Premier League for sponsorship reasons, is a men&#x27;s professional football league sanctioned by the Football Association of Singapore (FAS), which represents the sport&#x27;s highest level in the Singapore football league system.

The competition was founded as the S. League on 14 April 1996, after the FAS announced its intention to promote and expand the growing local football community by having a top level domestic league. As of 2022, the league comprises eight clubs, consisting of three rounds in which each team plays every other team once. Seasons run from late March to October, with teams playing 21 matches each, totalling 147 matches in the season.

Successful SPL clubs gain qualification into Asian continental club competitions, including the AFC Champions League Two. SPL currently does not practice promotion and relegation. Since the league&#x27;s inception in 1996, 7 clubs have been crowned champions. Warriors FC have been the most successful club with 9 titles, followed by Albirex Niigata Singapore (6), Tampines Rovers (5), Lion City Sailors (3), Geylang International (2), DPMM (2) and Étoile (1). The current champions are Albirex Niigata, the Japanese satellite team, having won their fifth S-League title in the 2023 season.

==History==

=== Origins ===
Singapore had been represented in the Malaysia Cup through the Singapore Lions since 1921. The Lions were one of the most successful teams in the competition, having won it 24 times from 1921 to 1994. Following a dispute over gate receipts between the FAS and FAM after winning the league and cup double in 1994, the Lions withdrew from the Malaysian competitions.

Subsequently, FAS decided to build a professional league system. However, as it was estimated to take about a year to put in place the structure of a professional league, the Singapore Lions were given match practice in what was then the top level of domestic football, the semi-professional FAS Premier League. This team won the last FAS Premier League title, finishing the season unbeaten.

=== S. League era (1996–2017) ===

====Inaugural season====
The S.League was founded in 1996. The FAS invited applications for clubs to compete in the newly formed league. Eight successful applications were made. Two clubs from the Premier League – powerhouse Geylang International (renamed Geylang United; 6 consecutive Premier League titles) and Balestier United (renamed Balestier Central – joined six from the amateur National Football League – Police SA, Singapore Armed Forces (SAFFC), Tampines Rovers, Tiong Bahru United, Wellington (renamed Woodlands Wellington) and Sembawang Rangers (merger of Gibraltar Crescent and Sembawang SC) – for the inaugural edition of the S.League. The season was split into the two series. Tiger Beer Series winners Geylang United defeated Pioneer Series winners SAFFC 2–1 in the end of season championship playoff to be crowned the 1st S.League champions. The 30,000 crowd at the playoff remains the record attendance in the S.League.

====Expansion of the league====
Police FC renamed themselves as Home United for the 1997 season to reflect their representation of not only the Singapore Police Force, but also other HomeTeam Departments of the Singapore Ministry of Home Affairs such as the SCDF and the ICA. NFL side Jurong Town, who renamed themselves Jurong FC, joined the competition taking the number of participating clubs to 9. The league switched from its previous format to a round-robin competition. Singapore Armed Forces won their first title.

Gombak United and Marine Castle United joined the S.League in 1998, further taking the number of clubs to 11. Tiong Bahru United renamed themselves to Tanjong Pagar United at the start of the season. Singapore Armed Forces won their second consecutive title.

Clementi Khalsa joined the S.League in 1999 as a representative of the Sikh community in Singapore. The league took on 12 teams for the next five years. Home United won their first title.

====Invited clubs====
During the 2000s, the FAS decided to invite foreign clubs to the league to increase league competitiveness. Sinchi, a side composed of Chinese players became the first foreign club to participate in 2003. Chinese nationals Shi Jiayi and Qiu Li went on to become naturalised Singapore players.

Sporting Afrique, a club made up of African players, and Super Reds, a side comprising South Korean players, became the third and fourth foreign clubs to join the competition in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Sporting Afrique were refused entry into the 2007 S.League due to off-field controversies and poor performance. In 2010, Super Reds were denied a place after three seasons following attempts to convert into a team of local players.

Chinese Super League clubs Liaoning (2007), Dalian Shide (2008) and Beijing Guoan (2010) entered their feeder clubs in the S.League. All three clubs each lasted one season before being pulled out of the league due to poor performances and disciplinary issues. Bruneian club DPMM joined the S.League in 2009 before being pulled from the league as a result of a FIFA ban. They re-entered the league from 2012. They were the first club to base themselves outside of Singapore. In 2010, French club Étoile became the first foreign side to win the S.League. Etoile pulled out of the S.League prior to the 2012 season to focus on grassroots football and youth development.

In 2012, Malaysia national youth sides Harimau Muda A and Harimau Muda B joined the S.League following an agreement between the Football Association of Singapore and the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) to send their representative sides into their respective domestic competitions. Singaporean side LionsXII returned to the Malaysian competitions in 2012. Echoing the former Singapore FA, the LionsXII quickly became a successful force in the Malaysian league system during its short stint, winning the league title in 2013 as well as the FA Cup in 2015.

However, on 25 November 2015, the FAM decided not to extend their Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the FAS. This automatically disqualified LionsXII from further entering any football tournament in Malaysia. Similarly, Malaysia&#x27;s squad Harimau Muda did not participate in the Singapore League from then onwards.

J.League club Albirex Niigata entered their feeder club Albirex Niigata Singapore in the 2004 S.League. The club became the most established foreign side in the S.League, drawing on the support the Japanese expatriate community and some local fans. As of 2023, they are the foreign side with the longest involvement in Singaporean football.

====20th season====
The league took on a number of changes for the 2015 season to increase its competitiveness. The number of clubs was reduced from 12 to 10, with the withdrawal of Tanjong Pagar United due to financial problems, and the merger of Woodlands Wellington and Hougang United. The league returned to a three-round format used from 2001 to 2011. The foreign player quota remained at five per club, but incentives were given to those who signed an under-21 player. The passing time for the mandatory 2.4 km fitness test was lowered from 10 mins to 9 mins 45 s. A new rule on age restrictions – a maximum of five players aged 30 and above and a minimum of three under-25 players for clubs with a 22-man squad, a maximum of four players aged 30 and above and a minimum of two under-25 players for clubs with a 20-man squad – was later reversed.

=== Rebranding as Singapore Premier League (2018–&quot;present&quot;) ===
The league was rebranded as the Singapore Premier League on 21 March 2018. Further revamps were also made to see a greater emphasis on local youth players in a bid to strengthen the national side; this, in effect, has resulted in a number of senior as well as local and foreign stars being purchased by overseas clubs. 

Singapore Premier League clubs can sign a maximum of four foreign players in the 2020 season, up from three as compared in the 2019 season. In the 2022 season, All eight team will play a four-round format for the first time in its entire league history. The 2024–25 Singapore Premier League season will be the first season to have a two-year schedule in the league history.

==Competition format==
===Structure===
Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored.

At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned league champion. If the points, goal difference, goals scored, and head-to-head results between teams are equal, head-to-head records between the teams are used, followed by a better fair play record.

There is no relegation or promotion system in the league. Clubs enter the Singapore Premier League by invitation of the Football Association of Singapore.
==Clubs==
A total of 25 clubs have played in the league from its inception in 1996 up to and including the 2022 season. The following 9 clubs are competing in the league during the 2023 season. There are two non-Singaporean clubs that currently compete in the Singapore Premier League – Albirex Niigata (S) is a satellite team of the Japanese club of the same name and DPMM of the Brunei.

Balestier Khalsa, Geylang International and Tampines Rovers are clubs that have played in all 28 seasons of the Singapore Premier League as of 2024.

=== Former clubs ===

====Invited clubs====


== Sponsorship ==
After an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the league was sponsored by Great Eastern from 2009 until 2018 where Yeo&#x27;s and Hyundai become the joint sponsorship, during which time it was known as the Great Eastern-Yeo&#x27;s S.League and the Great Eastern-Hyundai S.League. In 2019, Hong Kong-based multinational insurance and finance corporation sponsored the league as their main sponsor.

For the 2018 season, the league was rebranded as the Singapore Premier League.
==International competitions==
===Qualification for Asian competitions===
The league&#x27;s winners qualify for the AFC Champions League, while Singapore Cup winners qualify for the AFC Cup playoff spot. In the event of the same club winning both the S.League and Singapore Cup, the runners-up of the league takes up the AFC Cup qualification spot. Foreign clubs are ineligible to represent the Football Association of Singapore in AFC continental competitions. The qualification spot is given to the next best-placed local club in the league if a foreign club wins any of the two competitions.

==Past champions==
The league has seen seven clubs win the title since its inception. Warriors FC (formerly Singapore Armed Forces FC) hold the most titles at nine. In 2010, Étoile became the first foreign side to win the competition.

<text>As the Canadian province with the largest population, Ontario has a particularly prominent role in Canadian music. The provincial capital city of Toronto, Canada&#x27;s largest municipality, is home to much of the English Canadian music industry and many individual musicians, and the most popular destination for musicians from other parts of Canada, besides French-Canadian musicians, looking to advance their careers. Toronto also supports Canadian music as the centre of English language media in Canada. Hamilton, Ottawa, Kingston and Guelph have also been important centres for Canadian music.

In classical music, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the Ottawa-based National Arts Centre Orchestra are two of the most renowned orchestras in the world. Many smaller Ontario cities have orchestras of their own as well. The Canadian Opera Company based in Toronto is the country&#x27;s largest and most influential producer of opera productions.

Other institutions in the province include the Royal Conservatory of Music, MuchMusic, and concert venues such as Roy Thomson Hall, Massey Hall and the National Arts Centre. Record labels in the province include MapleMusic, DROG Records, Duke Street, Sonic Unyon, Three Gut, Zunior, Linus Entertainment, and the Canadian divisions of most major international labels.

The original publication was a &quot;four-shape&quot; shape note book using the shapes and syllables &quot;faw, sol, law, and mi&quot;. Funk designed &quot;A Compilation of Genuine Church Music&quot; for use in singing schools. It contained 208 pages, including rudiments of music and tunes harmonized for three voices. Funk released a second edition in 1835, and a third in 1842. The 1847 fourth edition was the first publication by Joseph Funk and Sons at Singers Glen. The name was changed to &quot;Harmonia Sacra&quot; in 1851, using the original title as a subtitle. In 1851, Funk also changed from the four-shapes to the seven-shape shape note system. Rather than adopt the Aikin system, Funk devised his own. Further editions were released, including 1860, 1866, 1878, 1980 and 1993. In 1866, called the 12th edition, the three voice parts were expanded to four. After 1878 (17th edition), the rudiments of music were deleted. In 1980, the 24th edition, the format was changed, changing the old four stave oblong tunebook to an upright modern soprano-alto-tenor-bass format. The 25th edition (1993) restored the old oblong tunebook format, as well as the rudiments of music and 27 three-voice hymns from the first and second editions. A newly typeset 26th edition is available. An online edition of the 26th edition provides tunes in both four- and seven-shape settings.

According to the &quot;Mennonite Encyclopedia&quot; this &quot;music textbook ... has reached a total issue of nearly 100,000 copies.&quot; The book is still is in use by Mennonites today. Most singings are held in the Dayton-Harrisonburg area of Virginia.

<text>One True Voice were a British boy band created on the ITV television series &quot;&quot;. 

==&quot;Popstars: The Rivals&quot;==
In the show, single gender pop groups were created through a public vote and competed in the UK Singles Chart for the 2002 Christmas number one single. One True Voice&#x27;s debut single was double A-side &quot;Sacred Trust / After You&#x27;re Gone&quot; which competed against ‘girl group’ Girls Aloud and their debut song &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;. Upon release, Girls Aloud topped the chart and One True Voice reached number two. 

===After &quot;Popstars: The Rivals&quot;===
In June 2003, Daniel Pearce left the group to pursue a solo career. The band released a further single in 2003 but cancelled a tour due to poor ticket sales, topping a poll for &quot;Britain&#x27;s Worst Group&quot;. By August 2003, they had fully disbanded without releasing an album.

==Members==
* Anton Gordon auditioned for &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2006, but did not make it through the preliminary screening. He continues with musical projects under the name of Anton Romero, including a joint single with Winta entitled &quot;Hot Romance (Rok With You)&quot;.

* Matt Johnson signed a solo contract with Jive Records after One True Voice, but left the label after being unhappy with the music direction and is currently signed to his own record label Tristar Records which has a distribution deal with Believe Digital since 2013. Matt released a single Get Over You on 29 July 2016, produced by Steve Power

* Daniel Pearce (born 29 May 1978, 46 years old) played a lead role in the musical &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; in London&#x27;s West End. Pearce auditioned for the 6th series of &quot;The X Factor&quot; in 2009, by singing Seal&#x27;s &quot;Kiss From a Rose&quot;. He made it through the auditions, boot camp (singing Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot;) and eventually made it to Judges&#x27; Houses (singing George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Praying for Time&quot;). His mentor Simon Cowell, however, did not choose him for the finals. He was a backing singer for Dizzee Rascal when he performed on Jools Hollands 2009/2010 Hootenanny and also on the &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; 2009 show when he sang on the track &quot;Holiday&quot;. He continues to be a backing singer for Dizzee Rascal and appeared on his No.1 hit &quot;Dirtee Disco&quot;.

After moving to Chicago, he performed with the band 7th Heaven between 2006 and 2012. In 2010, he successfully auditioned for ninth season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, singing &quot;Heaven&quot; by Bryan Adams. But due to immigration status problems, he lost his spot on the program due to US legal status and residency considerations. In 2013 he launched his own new band SEMPLE focusing on his original music and in 2015 appeared in the season 9 of the American series &quot;The Voice&quot; as part of Team Adam. In the Battle Round, Semple paired against Manny Cabo. In the Knockout Round, Semple paired against Dustin Christensen.

He moved from music into television and has worked for the BBC since 2014. He currently works as Executive Publicity Assistant on works in Cardiff on the BBC programmes &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Class&quot;.

<doc id="1275258" wikidata="Q7674529" url="?curid=1275258" title="Tadeusz Sulimirski">
<text>Tadeusz Józef Sulimirski (1 April 1898 – 20 June 1983) was a Polish-born British historian and archaeologist, who emigrated to the United Kingdom soon after the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Sulimirski was a pioneer and leading expert in the study of the archaeology of steppe nomads, particularly the Cimmerians, Scythians and Sarmatians.

==Early life==
Tadeusz Joseph Sulimirski was born on 1 April 1898 in the town of Kobylany, which was then part of the Austria-Hungary. He belonged to Polish nobility, the szlachta. He received his primary education in Chyrów. From 1916 to 1920, Sulimirski served in the Polish Legions, fighting initially against the Russian Empire in World War I, and then against the Russian SFSR in the Polish-Soviet War.

After the peace, Sulimirski enrolled at the University of Lwów, acquiring a Doctor of Law in 1924. In 1929 he acquired a PhD in archaeology. He received a higher doctorate in 1931. Since 1931 he was Head of the Prehistory Department of the University of Lwów. Sulimirski became Chair of Prehistoric Archaeology at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków in 1936. In 1937 he was appointed Professor. While in this position, Sulimirski carried out pioneering archaeological research.

Upon the Invasion of Poland, Sulimirski rejoined the Polish Armed Forces. After the occupation of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Sulimirski escaped to Romania, and from there he left for France. Upon the Fall of France soon afterwards, Sulimirski left for the United Kingdom, where he became Secretary-General to the Polish Government. In that position he wrote a number of geopolitical propaganda articles calling for the expansion of Poland to the west through the annexation of German territory lying east of the Oder River, on the grounds that in early medieval times those territories had been part of the early Polish state.

After recognition of the Polish government-in-exile was withdrawn by the Western governments, Sulimirski was a leading figure in the Committee for the Education of Poles in Great Britain. During this time, Sulimirski returned more and more to teaching. From 1952 he gave regular courses in East European prehistory at the London Institute of Archaeology of the University of London. In 1958 he was made Professor of Middle East and European Archaeology at the London University Institute of Archaeology. He also lectured at Cambridge University, University of Oxford, University of Glasgow, University of Edinburgh, University of Wrocław, and the University of Łódź. He gave lectures and seminars in many European countries in 1952-1965, and in a number of United States universities during a tour in 1968-1969. Sulimirski retired from the University of London in 1969, but continued to travel and lecture after retirement. He contributed immensely to the increasing the understanding of the archaeology of Eastern Europe in the West.

Cut off from carrying out archaeological research by his exile from Poland, Sulimirski dedicated his later career to writing. During World War II, almost all of his previous work was destroyed, but with the help from colleagues both in Poland and abroad, he was able to have his works rewritten and published in 1968. He was writer of more than 200 books, articles and other scientific publications. Of particular note is his work &quot;Prehistoric Russia&quot; (1970), and a series of articles published in the &quot;Bulletin of the Institute of Archaeology&quot;, where he made available in English the most recent research on the archaeology of Russia.

Sulimirski particularly specialized in the study of steppe nomads such as the Cimmerians, Scythians and Sarmatians. Much of this later writing was concerned with them. He was a pioneer and one of the world&#x27;s foremost experts on the archaeology of the steppes.

Sulimirski was a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland and the Society of Antiquaries of London. In 1973 he was the recipient of the Jurzykowski Prize. He was very active in Polish organizations such as Polish University Abroad and the Polish Scientific Society.

Sulimirski died on 20 April 1983. He was survived by his wife, Olga Sulimirska; five children, Felicia Janiszewska (Boba), Maria Romanowska (Ninia), Witold Sulimirski, Karol (Charles) Sulimirski, Jerzy (George) Sulimirski; 15 grandchildren, including Witold&#x27;s children, Ela (Landegger), Adam and Edward; and Karol&#x27;s children, Roger, Mark and Renata (Weiss); and, numerous great grandchildren.
