<text>The Apostolic Movement of Schoenstatt () is a Catholic Marian movement founded in Germany in 1914 by Fr Joseph Kentenich, who saw the movement as a means of spiritual renewal for the Catholic Church. The movement is named after the small locality of Schönstatt (which means &quot;beautiful place&quot;) which is part of the town of Vallendar near Koblenz, in Germany.

As a movement of renewal within the Catholic Church, Schoenstatt works to revitalize the Church and society in the spirit of the Gospel. Its members seek to connect faith with daily life, especially through a deep love for Mary, the Mother of God, who helps, educates and guides them in becoming better followers of Christ. As an international movement, it has expanded to every continent and has members from all vocations and walks in life. It is a spiritual family whose many branches and communities join to form a single Schoenstatt Family.

== History ==
The Schoenstatt Movement was founded in 1914, when Father Joseph Kentenich, the spiritual director in a Pallottine school in Vallendar, Germany, and a young group of seminarians sealed the &quot;Covenant of Love&quot; with the Virgin Mary in a small chapel, now known as the Original Schoenstatt Shrine. Father Kentenich was inspired in part by the success of Bartolo Longo in establishing the Marian shrine to Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompeii, and felt called to establish a new shrine in Schoenstatt, to &quot;create a spirituality which would be adaptable to conditions of rapid changes in the modern world&quot;.

Throughout its early years, Schoenstatt began to grow as a retreat center for different groups. During World War I, many of the young seminarians, such as Joseph Engling, were put to the test when they were called to serve at the battlefronts. There, “the lives and testimonies of the young Schoenstatt members attracted more people from different states of life.”

During the 1930s, with the rise of Adolf Hitler, Fr. Kentenich and other Schoenstatters, such as Fr. Franz Reinisch, criticized Nazism, and as a consequence the Schoenstatt Movement was registered as a threat to the Nazi-Regime. In 1941, Fr. Kentenich was arrested and sent to the Dachau concentration camp, where he began to expand Schoenstatt among the prisoners. He would remain there until 1945 when the concentration camp was liberated.Between 1947 and 1948, Fr. Kentenich visited South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and the United States to help communities in these countries to build up Schoenstatt. During this time, Fr. Kentenich met thousands of people, many of whom would play important roles in the development of the Movement, such as the Chilean Mario Hiriart and the Brazilian deacon Don Joao de Pozzobon. In 1950, Pozzobon began the Pilgrim Mother Apostolate. He travelled thousands of miles on foot to evangelize in schools, prisons, hospitals, and homes.

In May 1949, Fr. Kentenich wrote a letter to the Church authorities in Germany, well known in Schoenstatt as &quot;Epistola Perlonga&quot;. In this letter, Fr. Kentenich highlights the dangers that the Church faces due to some models of theological thinking which “separates the life of God from His creation and our Spirit of humanity.” The letter was considered offensive by German and Vatican Church authorities, and resulted in Fr. Kentenich&#x27;s exile to Milwaukee (USA) for 14 years.
According to the Schoenstatt Movement, “the Second Vatican Council opened a new vision of the Church which better understood the Work of Fr. Kentenich. In 1965, he was called to return to his native land and was fully rehabilitated by Pope Paul VI.” During the following three years, he was able to continue his work with Schoenstatt. He died on September 15, 1968.After the death of Father Kentenich, the Schoenstatt Movement “remained profoundly attached to the person of the Founder, working on the growth of creative loyalty to his mission and his charism, adapting itself to new cultural environments and historical challenges.”

Schoenstatt has continued to grow through the Movement&#x27;s various apostolates, such as the Pilgrim Mother Apostolate, which has reached millions of people in many countries, social and educational actions around the world, the development of Federations, Leagues, and other groups for families, youth, and pilgrims, and the expansion of Schoenstatt shrines (207 at the present).

== Mother Thrice Admirable ==
The picture of Mother Thrice Admirable (&quot;Mater ter Admirabilis&quot; in Latin) was donated by a teacher in 1915 to the Pallotine seminarians under the spiritual direction of Father Kentenich. It was painted in 1898 by Luigi Crosio under the title Refugium Peccatorum Madonna (Refuge of Sinners). It has since been called the Mother Thrice Admirable Madonna, a key symbol of the Schoenstatt movement.

Schoenstatt also makes itself present through the Pilgrim Mother Campaign, which spans more than 110 countries in the world, with around 30 million members.

== Spirituality ==

The central issues in the Schoenstatt Movement are the ideas based on that which Father Joseph Kentenich founded the movement in 1914, including Christian personality development, orientation toward ideals, and community.&quot;[Schoenstatt] wishes to be understood as a universal vision, comprising time and eternity, this world and the next, the economic, social, ethical, political and religious needs of all people, including the dispossessed, the millions of masses. …It wants to help redeem the world not only from its earthly sufferings, but also from sin and from its alienation from God. It tries to do this under the guidance and in the school of Our Lady by applying the original principles of Christianity in a new way to restore the disturbed relationship between the individual person and society, the person and business, the person and technology, and the person and social advancement.&quot; - Joseph Kentenich 

=== Marian Devotion ===
Since the founding in 1914, love for Mary has been at the heart of the Schoenstatt Movement and its spirituality. According to the official website, &quot;Schoenstatt is deeply and devotedly Marian and has repeatedly experienced how the love of Mary opens new avenues to a vibrant relationship with Christ, to the Holy Spirit, and to God the Father, as well as a renewal of love of neighbor and self. [...] In the Schoenstatt Shrine, the Blessed Mother acts as mother and educator of all those who entrust themselves to her. She helps form the new person in the new community.&quot;“An authentic Marian spirituality leads to a deep love for the Church.” - St. Pope John Paul II to the Schoenstatt Family (September 20, 1985)

=== Shrine ===

It is Schoenstatt&#x27;s conviction that the shrine is a place of grace and pilgrimage, &quot;a certain place where God shows His presence and action in a special way, through Mary.&quot; Since the first Covenant of Love sealed by Father Kentenich and the founding members of Schoenstatt in 1914, millions of people have repeatedly observed that the shrine is a place of grace.

According to the official website, &quot;Schoenstatt was founded in an act of invitation: The earthly partners offered their striving for sanctity, and the heavenly partner, Mary, was asked to come and actively dwell in the shrine as Mother and Educator. This is precisely what is known as the covenant of love upon which Schoenstatt was founded.&quot;

What is now known as the Original Schoenstatt Shrine used to be a chapel devoted to St. Michael, near the Pallotine school where Father Kentenich served as spiritual director, in Vallendar, Germany. Since then, more than 200 &quot;daughter shrines&quot; - that is, exact replicas of the Original Shrine - have been built around the world. These shrines serve as the center of the Schoenstatt Movement in the community. From here, pilgrims and members of the Schoenstatt Movement receive the three graces of the shrine:

# The grace of a home - It&#x27;s the &quot;awareness of knowing that Mary totally accepts you and gives you a home in her heart and in her shrine.&quot;
# The grace of inner transformation - It is a &quot;fruit of Mary’s intercession as mother and educator in the shrine, since she encourages us to become disciples of Christ, to interiorly transform and educate ourselves from within.&quot;
# The grace of apostolic fruitfulness - When a person feels &quot;completely at home and knows they are totally accepted and deeply transformed [that is, they have received the first two graces of the Schoenstatt Shrine] they are able to be more fully effective as an instrument of God.&quot;
=== Covenant of Love ===
The Movement describes the Covenant of Love as &quot;an act of consecration (as individual or community) to Mary as the Mother Thrice Admirable of Schoenstatt&quot;, and it is a recognized form of Marian consecration in the Catholic Church. For people who have sealed the Covenant of Love, this act of consecration brings about a deeper relationship with Mary, the Mother of God.

Schoenstatt&#x27;s founding act in 1914 is the moment when Father Kentenich and the founding generation offered their striving for sanctity and asked Mary to come to dwell in their chapel, the Schoenstatt Shrine. It is from this original act that Schoenstatt&#x27;s life, identity, and fruitfulness flow.

According to the official website, &quot;Father Kentenich characterized Marian consecrations as a total and mutual exchange of hearts, goods, and interests. Through this exchange, one grows in love, in one’s overall spiritual life, and in the ability to fulfill one’s mission. In the Catholic experience, Mary has proven to be an outstanding consecration partner, leading persons, nations, communities, and generations to a deeper fervor of love and commitment to Christ and the Triune God.&quot;

=== Capital of Grace ===
The Catholic Church’s teaching on merits and &quot;our possibility to cooperate in Christ’s work of salvation encourages us to actively strive for sanctity and make ourselves available for the building up of Christ’s Kingdom.&quot; In the Schoenstatt Movement, a unique way of expressing this is: c&quot;ontributions to the capital of grac&quot;e. The Movement describes these contributions as stemming from the Covenant of Love with Mary, where members &quot;consciously bring her our prayers, sacrifices, and striving for sanctity. We so-to-say turn over the merits of these good works to the MTA [Mother Thrice Admirable] for her mission in the service of Christ.&quot;

=== Everyday Sanctity ===

In Schoenstatt, the Christian vocation&#x27;s call to holiness is understood as everyday (or workday) sanctity, meaning the integration of one&#x27;s faith with every aspect of ordinary life.

The Schoenstatt Movement describes everyday sanctity as &quot;doing one’s ordinary duties in an extraordinary way (ordinaria extraordinarie) or as fulfilling the duties of one’s state in life as perfectly as possible out of a total love for God.&quot; Father Kentenich developed its most comprehensive definition in 1932:“Everyday sanctity is the God-pleasing harmony between wholehearted attachment to God, work, and fellow human beings in every circumstance of life.”&quot;Everyday sanctity is therefore being attentive about not neglecting God because of the world, nor one’s family because of apostolate, nor one’s neighbor because of work, nor one’s duties in life because of God. [...] Everyday sanctity also seeks to integrate work, prayer, and suffering.&quot; In this context, Schoenstatt understands &quot;work as a person’s share in the creative activity of God, prayer as a dialogue of love with God, and suffering as a crucial part of the Christian vocation.&quot;

=== Practical Faith in Divine Providence ===
In Schoenstatt, Practical Faith in Divine Providence is &quot;a faith in God and His loving care that has been made part of practical everyday life&quot;, and it has the form of &quot;a message of trust in God’s care, of a constant dialogue with the God of life and history, and of actively seeking God’s will.&quot;
In this practice of faith, one seeks God&#x27;s message in every circumstance. Moreover, one seeks to live the covenant with God in an ongoing dialog of prayer and actions. In Schoenstatt, discerning God&#x27;s voice involves &quot;being attentive to the events around us, both on the large scale (Church and world) and on the small scale (personal and family life). One way of doing this is Schoenstatt’s method of meditation.&quot;Fr Kentenich expressed it very well when he said that it was important to keep “an ear to the heart of God and a hand on the pulse of the times”. These are the two pillars of an authentic spiritual life. - Pope Francis addressing the Schoenstatt Fathers (September 3, 2015)

== Schoenstatt life ==
There are five aspects of the Schoenstatt Movement&#x27;s life:

=== Church ===
As a movement of renewal within the Catholic Church, &quot;it sees its main task as being to be close to the local and universal Church, in order to make the Church fruitful with its charism and at the same time allow itself to be fertilized by it&quot;. The Schoenstatt Movement works with parishes, dioceses, other communities, laity, couples and public officials.

=== Education/Pedagogy ===
One of Father Kentenich&#x27;s major focuses in his work was pedagogy. He gave countless lectures to thousands of people, and retreats to families, priests, and other members of the Schoenstatt Movement. What is known today as Kentenich pedagogy &quot;has been successfully applied in innumerable institutions, universities, life groups and religious communities, schools, homes, Children&#x27;s Homes, families and companies&quot;, extending the Schoenstatt spirituality to broad areas of society.

=== Marriage and Family ===

Family life is essential to the Schoenstatt Movement&#x27;s spirituality and pedagogy. Around the world, in the Family Institutes, Federations, and Leagues, the Movement holds various retreats, seminars, and meetings on topics related to marriage, education, and family, all of which are meant to cultivate family relationships. In the field of formation, the Schoenstatt Movement&#x27;s aims are &quot;to strengthen the development towards a mature personality, someone who lives their relationships with responsibility with the world around them. In short, it is about discovering, cultivating, and forming marriage as a vocation of life.&quot;&quot;Whatever you achieve for the benefit of the family will show its effectiveness beyond the family, and will work in many men and women and within society. The future of the world and of the Church depends on the family.&quot; - Pope John Paul II to the Schoenstatt Movement

=== Society ===
The Schoenstatt Movement is active in the areas concerning social commitment, such as &quot;the development of local communities, prison and hospital ministry, business and work, helping abandoned children and children from low-income families, commitment to the sick, commitment to the elderly, commitment to immigrants.&quot; There are countless social projects organized by members of the Schoenstatt Movement (such as the Schoenstatt Fathers, Sisters of Mary, families, and volunteers) that are present worldwide and that seek to transmit &quot;a social spirit, which consists of virtues such as respect, dignity, radiating love, peace, and joy, believing in the good of each person, in their mission, their dignity and their value as a child of God.&quot;

=== Youth ===
The Schoenstatt Movement &quot;accompanies and guides young people to positively face the challenges they encounter in their everyday lives. [...] It offers them support, guidance, social networks, creative fields of action, a lived spirituality and a world of attachments. The youth use their physical, intellectual, and spiritual strengths in planning projects to promote improvements in their environment and in making them a reality&quot;. The Schoenstatt Youth organizes retreats and camps all over the world, celebrates religious festivals, pilgrimages, university, school and family missions, and commits itself in solidarity works.

== Apostolic actions ==

The movement is involved in several apostolic actions, including missionary work, charity, education, and other projects. The most widespread activity is the Pilgrim Mother Campaign, now spanning more than 110 countries in the world, with around 30 million members.

=== Schoenstatt 100-year Jubilee ===
On 18 October 2014 the Apostolic Schoenstatt Movement celebrated 100 years of its founding. According to the official website of the 2014 Jubilee, &quot;this jubilee is a thanksgiving for a richly blessed history. It marks the outpouring of the Schoenstatt Movement into a new era, guided by the grace of its beginnings, and can be summarized by the expression: covenant of love.&quot;

Around 12,000 pilgrims from 100 countries gathered in Schoenstatt, Germany for week-long celebrations and festivities. From there, members went on a pilgrimage to Rome, where they had a General Audience with Pope Francis on 25 October 2014. These celebrations and General Audience with the pope were streamed live to hundreds of thousands of people around the world who celebrated and gathered in their local Schoenstatt shrines.

=== Youth festival ===
In 2005, about four thousand young people from around the world – Germany, Poland, England, Italy, Uruguay, Argentine, Chile, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Africa, United States, etc. – gathered for almost a week in the Original Shrine in Schoenstatt, Vallendar, for the Schoenstatt Youth Festival prior to the World Youth Day in Cologne.

=== Schoenstatt Summer ===

After the success of the youth festival the prior year, it became obvious that there should be something to bring together each year the youth of the world, around the original shrine. During 2006, volunteers from Germany, Mexico, the United States, Poland, Puerto Rico, Chile, Argentina, Portugal, and Kenya, worked together to create a month-long program for young pilgrims from all over the world. This was the first of many Schoenstatt Summers. The Night of the Shrine was the conclusion of this month-long program. At midnight on 27 August, over 400 people gathered for Mass around the original shrine. Together with them, the youth of the world in more than 90 shrines, spread around five continents, celebrated this Mass at the same moment. Each shrine celebrated in their own way, according to the traditions of their country, this World Youth Mass.

<doc id="1302425" wikidata="Q177343" url="?curid=1302425" title="Mikaël Silvestre">
<text>Mikaël Samy Silvestre (born 9 August 1977) is a French former professional footballer who played as a defender. He is best known for a nine-year spell at Manchester United, with whom he won numerous Premier League titles, the FA Cup, the Football League Cup, two FA Community Shields, the Intercontinental Cup and the UEFA Champions League. 

Silvestre began his career at Rennes in 1996, before moving to Italian club Inter Milan in 1998. He joined Manchester United in 1999, where he won multiple Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League in his final season at the club in 2008. He then joined Arsenal, followed by a move to German side Werder Bremen two years later. After a further two years in Germany, he moved to the United States to play for Portland Timbers in Major League Soccer, before signing for Indian Super League side Chennaiyin in 2014, where he retired at the end of the season.

Silvestre has also played for the France national team, earning 40 caps between 2001 and 2006. He was part of the France team that won the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2001 and 2003. Silvestre also represented his country at UEFA Euro 2004, as well as two FIFA World Cups in 2002 and 2006, winning a runners-up medal at the latter.

==Early life==
Silvestre was born in Chambray-lès-Tours, Indre-et-Loire.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Silvestre started playing football with the Rennes Football Academy in Brittany and began his league career with the French club in the 1995–96 season. His time at the club helped build his reputation, and in the 1997–98 season was signed by Inter Milan. He made 31 appearances for Inter in Serie A, Coppa Italia and in the UEFA Champions League.

===Manchester United===
Despite an approach from Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier, Silvestre signed for Manchester United for £4 million on 10 September 1999, and made his debut against Liverpool at Anfield the next day. In his first season at Manchester United he replaced an injured Ronny Johnsen in the centre of defence with Jaap Stam; By the 2001–02 season, Silvestre had established himself in defence ahead of the veteran Denis Irwin, and was proving to be adept both in defence and in getting forward at left back. He set up numerous goals for Ruud van Nistelrooy, notably away to Deportivo de La Coruña in a 2–0 towards the end of the season.

During the next season he carried on initially where he left off at the left of Manchester United&#x27;s back four, but following injury to Rio Ferdinand and the poor performance of an ageing Laurent Blanc, he was switched to his favoured position of central defence. This first happened at half-time in the UEFA Champions League match away in Basel on 26 November 2002 when the team were 1–0 down and struggling with a young John O&#x27;Shea looking shaky at the heart of the defence. Silvestre and O&#x27;Shea were switched for the second half and the team immediately looked more solid defensively. From this point Silvestre forged a successful partnership mid-season with Wes Brown at the heart of the defence until Ferdinand&#x27;s return, looking calm and assured. Using his pace to good effect, while continuing to provide goals with his accurate diagonal balls.

The beginning of the 2003–04 season saw Silvestre paired with Ferdinand in the centre of the team&#x27;s defence. However, this was cut short following Ferdinand&#x27;s eight-month ban for missing a drug test. In the latter half of this season when being paired with an unfit Wes Brown, Manchester United&#x27;s defence proved to be rather less secure and both Brown and Silvestre were at fault for numerous goals and despite winning the FA Cup with a 3–0 victory over Millwall, this uncertainty at the heart of the defence was to continue into the start of the 2004–05 season.

Competition for places grew significantly during the January transfer window in 2006 with the signings of Nemanja Vidić and Patrice Evra. Although both struggled to adapt initially, both went on to establish themselves as firm fan favourites and key members of the Manchester United squad. Following the partnership of Vidić and Ferdinand at the heart of the defence, and Evra&#x27;s holding of the left-back position, Silvestre found it more difficult to secure a place in the Manchester United starting line-up. However, his form improved toward the end of the season. He admitted that he was given the option to leave during the January transfer window during 2006, with an opportunity to join former Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier at Lyon. He did however decide to stay and fight for his place at United.

On 11 August 2006, his loyalty to the club was rewarded with a new contract extending his stay at the club until at least 2009. Alex Ferguson commented: &quot;Mikael has been an important member of the squad for seven years now. His experience at the Club will help the younger players as they develop and he has a central role to play in the first team.&quot;

He started the 2006–07 season against Watford, scoring a goal, his first away goal for United, to give United the lead. He was starting to reassert himself in the left-back role when he broke a metatarsal in a 1–0 defeat to Arsenal. After recovering and playing several games, he dislocated his shoulder in a Champions League win against Lille OSC, meaning he was unable to play for the rest of the season. He did, however, win his fourth Premier League winner&#x27;s medal that season as United won the league for the first time since 2003.

With Gabriel Heinze moving to Real Madrid, Silvestre was set to battle Evra for the starting left-back spot in the first eleven at Manchester United in the 2007–08 season. On 15 September, however, Silvestre was stretchered off with knee ligament damage that would rule him out for the rest of the season. On 24 September, Ferguson revealed that: &quot;I&#x27;m sure Mikael will be back in March.&quot; He also said, &quot;we had him operated on in France last week and it all went well. It was pleasing to see there was no further damage other than the cruciate ligament. That&#x27;s a big bonus because sometimes there can be cartilage problems that also come along.&quot;

On 20 March, Silvestre made his comeback in the Manchester United reserves in a 4–1 win over Manchester City.

On 9 April 2008, Silvestre made his first start for seven months in a Champions League quarter-final match versus Roma.

A transfer to Bordeaux was mooted in the summer of 2008. However, it is believed that Silvestre turned the transfer down to see out the remaining year of his contract, and potentially receive a testimonial match at the end of the 2008–09 season. He received an offer to join Manchester City from manager Mark Hughes and was set to join them; however, during the medical examination, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger called to offer Silvestre a transfer to his club. Given the strong French presence at Arsenal, the rivalry between Manchester United and Manchester City, and the fact that Manchester City were not yet a force in English football, Silvestre opted to join the London club.

===Arsenal===

The transfer to Arsenal was completed for an undisclosed fee on 20 August 2008, with Silvestre signing a two-year contract. The transfer made Silvestre the first player to transfer directly between Manchester United and Arsenal since Viv Anderson (who moved in the opposite direction) in 1987, and the first player to move from United to Arsenal since Brian Kidd in 1974. He was given the number 18 shirt, last worn by Pascal Cygan.

Silvestre made his debut for the club in a 3–1 victory over Everton on 18 October 2008, his 250th game in English football. In his first Champions League game for Arsenal, against Turkish side Fenerbahçe, he scored an own goal as Arsenal won 5–2. His first Premiership goal for Arsenal came against Tottenham Hotspur on 29 October 2008 in a 4-4 draw. On 8 November 2008, Silvestre played his first game against former side Manchester United, in a fixture that Arsenal eventually won 2–1. Silvestre was as well part of the squad, where he played in the first leg, for Arsenal&#x27;s 2009 Champions League semi final also against that of Manchester United.
===Werder Bremen===
After the 2009–10 season, Silvestre was released by Arsenal and became a free agent. He reportedly had offers from Fulham and Kayserispor, but instead signed for Werder Bremen. He managed to score his first goal for Bremen, in a magnificent shot which Bremen won against Bundesliga Champions Borussia Dortmund 2–0. By the end of the season, he made 26 league appearances, scoring a single league goal. He was released at the end of the 2011–12 season. He was offered a trial at English club West Ham United in September 2012. In October 2012, Silvestre began training with his former club, Manchester United, in order to maintain his fitness in the hope of finding a new club. Since then, he received an offer from Indian club Dodsal F.C., with a view to joining them in time for their new season in January 2013.

===Portland Timbers===
Silvestre spent time on trial with MLS side Portland Timbers ahead of the 2013 MLS campaign, and then moved to trial with fellow Cascadia region MLS side Seattle Sounders FC. The Timbers obtained Silvestre&#x27;s MLS discovery rights from the Sounders in exchange for a first-round pick in the 2014 MLS Supplemental Draft and a conditional 2015 draft pick. On 19 February 2013 it was announced that Silvestre had signed a two-year deal with Portland.

On 2 May 2013 Silvestre tore his left anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in a game against the New England Revolution. He missed the rest of the season. Silvestre subsequently had surgery to repair the damage. Despite his injury, Silvestre remained a vocal and engaged member of the team off the field and on social media.

Silvestre was released by Portland on 28 January 2014.

===Chennaiyin===
On 20 September 2014, Silvestre joined newly formed Indian Super League side Chennaiyin for four months and his signing was confirmed through Prashant Agarwal CEO of Kshatriya Sports, who confirmed that Silvestre signed the contract for the season for more than $500,000 (USD). He started in their first match on 15 October 2014, a 2–1 victory at FC Goa.

At the end of the season, after playing 14 games for Chennaiyin, Silvestre announced that would be exploring options to extend his playing career in the Middle-East and if not, he would continue working on his coaching badges, meaning that his time at Chennaiyin was over.

==International career==
Silvestre was previously a member of French junior team at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship. He earned his first senior cap for France on 27 February 2001 in a friendly against Germany that ended in a 1–0 win. He won the Confederations Cup both in 2001 and 2003 with France.

Silvestre also played one game in the French squad that made the final of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but did not play again for the national team after the tournament. He was recalled to the squad by Raymond Domenech for the 19 November 2008 friendly against Uruguay, but was an unused substitute. Raymond Domenech said he was in contention for a place at the 2010 World Cup, but he did not get a place. Silvestre was in the squad for a friendly against Romania in 2011, but again was an unused substitute.

==Style of play==
A versatile defender, Silvestre was capable of playing both as a left-sided full-back and as a centre-back. He was mainly known for his pace and stamina, although he also possessed good distribution and was known for being comfortable on the ball.

==After retirement==
Upon retiring, Silvestre took up a director of football role with former club Rennes in July 2015. He left by mutual consent on 22 December 2016. On 15 December 2021, backed by esports organisation Galaxy Racer, Silvestre launched Talent Lyfe, an agency to represent athletes and young talent in sports.

==Personal life==
Silvestre&#x27;s father, Franck, is from Guadeloupe.

<doc id="1302427" wikidata="Q2466949" url="?curid=1302427" title="Jorge Benítez (Argentine footballer)">
<text>Jorge José Benítez (born 3 June 1950 in Gobernador Castro, Buenos Aires Province) is an Argentine former football player and coach.

Nicknamed &quot;El Chino&quot; (&quot;The Chinese&quot;), Benítez started his career in Racing Club in 1969; in 1973 he was transferred to Boca Juniors, where he stayed until retirement in 1983. A gifted midfielder, he played 305 league matches and scored 40 goals for Boca, being instrumental in achieving the Metropolitano title in 1976 and 1981, the Nacional in 1976, the Copa Libertadores in 1977 and 1978 and the European/South American Cup in 1977.

Since he shared Boca&#x27;s midfield with talented players such as Trobbiani, Suñé, Potente, Ribolzi, Berta, Zanabria, Brindisi, and Maradona, his place in the team was often compromised.

After retirement, Benítez worked as junior division coach in Boca Juniors, and was offered the post of main coach in November 2004 upon the resignation of (former teammate) Brindisi due to poor results.

Benítez&#x27;s first achievement was to stabilize the team&#x27;s performance, and indeed it went on to win the 2004 Copa Sudamericana. As a result, the board of directors was convinced that he was the right man for the job, and extended the term of his contract, instead of going for a big-name coach.

On 15 July 2005, Benítez was sacked from Boca Juniors, following a poor performance by the team in the Copa Libertadores, and an incident in the quarterfinals match against Chivas de Guadalajara. A review of tape showed the manager spitting at Chivas player Adolfo Bautista a few minutes before the match ended. After being sacked, Benítez sought out Bautista to personally apologize by flying to a Chivas practice at Guadalajara. The apology was accepted but a personal meeting was rejected. The match ended 0-0, but Boca had suffered a 4-0 loss in the first leg. Boca then proceeded to hire former national team coach Alfio Basile for the post.

<text>The Pakistan national football team () represents Pakistan in men&#x27;s international football in FIFA-authorized events and is controlled by the Pakistan Football Federation, the governing body for football in Pakistan. Pakistan became a member of FIFA in 1948 and joined the Asian Football Confederation in 1950.

Pakistan&#x27;s national team debuted in 1950 and has yet to qualify for the FIFA World Cup finals. Pakistan has never qualified for any major tournament outside the South Asian region, although on regional level the team has won the 1952 Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament, and has achieved gold at the South Asian Games in 1989 and 1991. Pakistan had a brief period of emergence in the 1950s and early 1960s, but as the global popularity of football surged, the sport’s standing in Pakistan deteriorated. The standard achieved in the early years could not be maintained because of lack of organization of the game and the administration’s lack of attention to football. Football has also struggled to gain popularity in Pakistan largely due to the heavy influence of cricket in South Asia.

==History==
===Early years (1950s)===

Shortly after the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) was created, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah became its first Patron-in-Chief. PFF received recognition from FIFA in early 1948.

Pakistan visited Iran and Iraq for its international debut in October 1950. Pakistan faced Iran in their first official international game in Tehran, losing 5–1 during the Shah of Iran&#x27;s birthday celebrations. Reportedly the Pakistan national team played the match barefoot, which was the norm back in South Asia. Pakistan also engaged in unofficial friendly matches during the tour, defeating &quot;Tehran&#x27;s Taj FC&quot; (now Esteghlal FC) with a 6–1 scoreline and drew 2–2 against a team from Isfahan. In Iraq, due to the Iraqi FA&#x27;s inability to gather a full national team, Pakistan played an unofficial friendly against the club Haris al-Maliki resulting in a 1–1 draw.

Pakistan&#x27;s next international outing came in the 1952 Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament where the team played its first match against India after victories over Ceylon and Burma, which ended in a goalless draw and emerged as joint winners of the tournament after finishing with the same points in the table.

During the 1950s, Pakistan played internationally in the following Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament editions which were played in Burma in 1953, India in 1954, then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) in 1955, and the Asian Games in Philippines in 1954 and in Japan in 1958. Masood Fakhri had most notably scored a hat-trick&quot;,&quot; and became the first player from Pakistan to do so as his national team thumped Singapore 6–2 in a group match at the 1954 Asian Games in Manila, Philippines.
The Pakistan Football Federation became one of the 13 founding members of the Asian Football Confederation on 8 May 1954. Initially scheduled to play against Israel in the inaugural 1956 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, the team withdrew along with Afghanistan due to reluctance to host the Israeli team. However, in 1959, Pakistan finally decided to participate in the 1960 Asian Cup qualifiers hosted by India in Kerala, where Pakistan faced Iran, India and Israel twice each in the qualifiers. Although Israel managed to qualify by topping the group, Pakistan achieved a memorable victory over Iran by 4–1 and secure a draw against Israel, finishing in third place in the group, ahead of hosts India but behind Iran.

===Emergence (1960s)===
Pakistan had participated in various friendly tournaments in the early 1960s, with the Merdeka Cup hosted in Malaysia after the country first participation in 1960. Pakistan recorded some famous victories including a 7–0 walloping of Thailand, and a 3–1 win over the Asian powerhouses Japan. Two years later in the 1962 Merdeka Tournament, Pakistan ended runner up after falling to Singapore by 1–2 in the final.

The era also saw one of the finest players to ever grace the field in Pakistan football history, such as Abdul Ghafoor, nicknamed the &quot;Pakistani Pelé&quot; and &quot;Black Pearl of Pakistan&quot;, Moosa Ghazi, Abid Ghazi, Muhammad Umer Baloch, Turab Ali, Murad Bakhsh, Qadir Bakhsh, Maula Bakhsh, Ayub Dar, Ghulam Rabbani, Mohammad Amin, Ali Nawaz Baloch, among others.
During the China national team tour in Pakistan in 1963, the first test in Dhaka in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) ended in a 0–0 tie. The second match in Peshawar ended in a 3–2 victory for Pakistan, with the third fixture in Lahore ending in another 1–1 draw. The final fourth match in Karachi ended in a 2–0 defeat for Pakistan. The 1964 Summer Olympics qualification the same year included a 4–1 loss in Iran and a 1–0 win in Pakistan. Pakistan visited China the next year for an unofficial test match ending in a 2–0 victory.It was two years before Pakistan played another competitive fixture, when they played in the first 1965 RCD Cup and finished third. In the 1960s, the national team also hosted several teams from China, Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia and most notably Dallas Tornados for unofficial test matches. In 1967, Pakistan lost their Asian Cup qualifiers against Burma and Cambodia and drew their final match against India. They then hosted the second 1967 RCD Cup and finished third. In 1969, they travelled to Iran to take part in a friendly tournament, in which they had a 2–1 win against Iraq and a record 7–0 defeat by Iran. This was before another disappointment at the 1969 and 1970 RCD Cup editions.

Despite the game&#x27;s growth in the 1960s, Pakistan did not actively participate in the Asian Games football tournaments held in 1962, 1966, and 1970 due to financial constraints. The World Cup qualifiers followed a similar pattern, with Pakistan missing crucial matches because of a lack of interest from the federation and insufficient government support.

=== Dark era (1970s) ===
As a result of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, East Pakistan became Bangladesh and the Pakistani team lost the right to call upon Bengali players from the Dhaka First Division League. The national team did not compete again until 1973, when the national team toured the far east, which included several test matches against local teams and a friendly against China ending in a 4–7 defeat.
In the early 1970s the national side participated at the 1974 RCD Cup and the 1974 Asian Games. The most notable result in this period included a 2–2 draw against Turkey at the former and a 5–1 win against Bahrain at the latter.

Later on, the national side participated at the Afghanistan Republic Day Festival Cup in 1976, and held the inaugural Quaid-e-Azam International Cup held in Karachi the same year.

=== Resurgence (1980–1990) ===
After several years without competitive football activity, in the 1981 King&#x27;s Cup, Pakistan secured a goalless draw against Indonesia. After a loss to Thailand, they gained a 3–2 victory against Malaysia and although they lost a close game against China, they were able to win 1–0 in their final game against Singapore.

Pakistan hosted the 1982 Quaid-e-Azam International Cup involving Iran, Bangladesh, Oman, Nepal and the youth team Pakistan Blues. The &quot;Green Shirts&quot; started off with a 2–0 win over Nepal. They then lost to Iran, but came back and beat Bangladesh 2–1. The last game against Oman ended nil-nil and Pakistan ended at the third position behind the Pakistan youth team. However, in 1984, the national team lost 4 out of 5 games in the 1984 AFC Asian Cup qualification, the only victory coming against North Yemen 4–1 with Sharafat Ali scoring a hat-trick.

The national team hosted another 1985 Quaid-e-Azam International Cup, this time inviting North Korea, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Nepal. A goalless draw against the North Koreans boosted the side, and they beat Nepal 1–0. However, they lost in the final two games against Bangladesh and Indonesia. In the 1985 South Asian Games, Pakistan ended fourth after losing a penalty shoot out to Nepal.

After participating at the 1986 Fajr International Tournament, the team finished runner-ups at the 1986 Quaid-e-Azam International Cup involving China, Sri Lanka, Nepal and a South Korean XI. In the 1986 Asian Games, Pakistan lost all their games.

In 1987 after participating at the 1988 Summer Olympics Qualification, the side was more successful at the 1987 South Asian Games, winning the bronze medal match against Bangladesh 1–0. In 1988, after losing the 1988 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Pakistan began with their first ever participation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup qualifiers for Italy in January and February, ending up unsuccessful. The national team bounced back, when several months later they took Gold at the 1989 South Asian Games, beating Bangladesh 1–0 in the final, from a solitary goal by Haji Abdul Sattar in the dying minutes of the game.

===Decline (1990s–present)===

Pakistan had another early exit in the 1990 Asian Games, losing all three games. In the 1991 South Asian Games however, Pakistan beat the Maldives in the final 2–0 to win their second Gold, from goals scored by Qazi Ashfaq and Mohammad Nauman Khan. In 1992, the team lost all matches at the 1992 AFC Asian Cup qualification and the 1992 Jordan International Tournament. After again ending unsuccessful at the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualification and their return to the 1993 ECO Cup (formerly RCD Cup), the team took part in the first SAFF Cup took place in Lahore in 1993, and the national team finished fourth, but at the 1993 South Asian Games, they were unable to get past the group stage.

In 1995, Pakistan went out of the SAFF Cup group stage on goal difference. Between 1996 and 1997, the team lost all their Asian Cup and World Cup qualifying games. Pakistan came third in the 1997 SAFF Cup, thanks to a 1–0 victory over Sri Lanka in the third place playoff. The 1999 SAFF Cup saw Pakistan finish bottom of their group, and Pakistan also failed to get out of the group stage of the final 1999 South Asian Games to hold full internationals.

Pakistan were unable to win any of their 2000 Asian Cup qualifiers. The following year Pakistan achieved their first point in the 2002 World Cup qualification, thanks to a hat-trick by Gohar Zaman in a 3–3 draw against Sri Lanka, but all other matches ended in defeat.

In 2002, Pakistan played in an unsuccessful four match series against Sri Lanka. At the 2003 SAFF Cup, under the inspiration of the attacking midfielder Sarfraz Rasool, Pakistan stunned India, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in three victories as they reached the semi-finals only to fall short against Maldives by 1-0. Pakistan finished fourth, losing 2–1 in extra time to India in the third place playoff. Later in the year, Pakistan won their first Asian Cup qualifier with a 3–0 over Macao, but still were unable to qualify. They rounded off the year with defeats to Kyrgyzstan in the World Cup qualifiers.

2004 saw changes in Pakistan football, with a new administration in place by this time and a new national league up and running. A victory and a draw against India in a three match series, the final match ending 3–0 in favour to the &quot;Green Shirts&quot;, followed by the reach in the semi-finals of the 2005 SAFF Cup, losing against defending champion Bangladesh by 0–1 margin.

The Pakistan team lost their first two Asian Cup qualifiers in 2006, in between which they took part in the first 2006 AFC Challenge Cup. They failed to get past the group stage, but beat Kyrgyzstan 1–0. Back at the Asian Cup qualifiers, they lost their remaining fixtures. In the 2010 World Cup qualifiers in 2007, they fell to a heavy defeat by the Asian champions Iraq, losing 7–0 on aggregate across the two legs after drawing 0–0 in the second round. In 2008, Pakistan travelled to Nepal for two friendlies before taking on the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup qualification. Although they won against Chinese Taipei 2–1 in the first match, and beat Guam in a record-equalling 9–2 win in the final match, other results, including a 7–1 defeat to Sri Lanka, saw them again fail to reach the finals.

In the 2008 SAFF Championship, Pakistan failed to go beyond the group stages, losing to Maldives 3–0, India 2–1 and Nepal 4–1, which signalled the end of Akhtar Mohiuddin&#x27;s tenure as head coach. After Mohiuddin&#x27;s departure, George Kottan was hired and the veteran tactician took the team to the 2009 SAFF Championship. The side were defeated 1–0 by Sri Lanka, before drawing 0–0 with Bangladesh as Adnan Ahmed missed a late penalty to seal a win. Pakistan won against Bhutan 7–0 in their last game.

Kottan was soon sacked in February 2010, Pakistan had no senior games during the entire calendar year. For the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup qualification in 2011, coach Tariq Lutfi was called up once more and failed to deliver. Defeats such as the 3–0 against Turkmenistan and 3–1 against India meant that the side were already out of the qualifiers despite beating Chinese Taipei by 2–0. Later in the 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers in July, Pakistan lost 3–0 to Bangladesh in Dhaka, before earning a 0–0 draw in Lahore a few days later. Pakistan did not qualify for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, being eliminated by Bangladesh in the first round of the AFC qualifying section in 2011, losing 3–0 on aggregate.

That saw the end of Lutfi&#x27;s reign, with Serbian coach Zaviša Milosavljević taking over in November 2011 right before the 2011 SAFF Championship. Despite having little time to influence the team, Zavisa managed to hold Bangladesh 0–0, Maldives 0–0 and Nepal 1–1 in the India-hosted SAFF Championship 2011. However, they were unable to progress into the semi-finals and returned home.

2012&#x27;s sole game was witnessed in November against Singapore, who thrashed Pakistan 4–0 at home. Pakistan started 2013 well, winning two games against Nepal with identical 1–0 margins. A 1–1 draw with Maldives followed, but with congested fixtures Pakistan ended up losing the last game 3–0 in Male.

Pakistan then played the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup qualification in Bishkek, losing out 1–0 to Tajikistan in injury-time. Pakistan also lost 1–0 against the Kyrgyzstan after scoring in the 1st minute, but comfortably beat Macau 2–0.

Pakistan played a friendly against Afghanistan in August, losing 3–0 without their foreign-based players. Coach Zaviša Milosavljević was controversially sacked and replaced by Bahrain&#x27;s Mohammad Al-Shamlan, who acted as a coaching consultant to Shahzad Anwar in the 2013 SAFF Championship. The Shaheens lost their first game 1–0 to India after an own-goal from Samar Ishaq. Against hosts Nepal, Hassan Bashir scored an early goal, only to see 15-year-old Bimal Gharti Magar level things in injury-time. However, Pakistan beat Bangladesh 2–1 but failed to advance to the semi-finals. The team participated at the 2013 Philippine Peace Cup at the end of the year.

For Pakistan&#x27;s campaign for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, they were to face Yemen in Round 1 in the AFC qualifying section. In the first match, Pakistan lost 3–1. For the second match, Pakistan drew 0–0, eliminating Pakistan from the tournament on aggregate.

==== Inactivity and FIFA suspensions (2015–2022) ====
Pakistan was suspended from all football activities by FIFA on 10 October 2017, after the controversial tenure of the PFF president and politician Makhdoom Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat, widely described as a &quot;feudal lord of Pakistani football&quot;.

For three years since March 2015, the top division of the Pakistan Premier League remained suspended because of the crisis created due to his actions, along with the men&#x27;s senior team, who remained suspended from any international competition, and FIFA rankings of the senior team had slumped from 168 in 2003 to the lowest 201 in 2017.
FIFA restored membership of PFF on 13 March 2018. 

Pakistan went to Bangladesh to take part in 2018 SAFF Cup which started in September, 2018 which was their first FIFA recognized tournament after a span of 3 years. Pakistan played its first match of the event against Nepal which ended in a 2–1 win. Pakistan lost its next match to hosts Bangladesh by 1–0 after conceding a late goal. Green shirts played their final group game against Bhutan which ended in a 3–0 win and sealed their place in semis after 13 years. Pakistan faced arch rivals India in semi final and were ultimately knocked out by 3–1. 

After the SAFF Cup, Pakistan negotiated with the Palestine Football Association for a friendly. It was initially reported that the match will be played in Lahore, Pakistan on 15 November 2018 but Palestine decided to host the event afterwards. Due to visa issues, Pakistan team couldn&#x27;t fly to Palestine on the desired date. So, the match was played on 16 November in which Shaheens lost by 2–1. 

Disappointment would soon strike again as Pakistan lost its chance to pass the 2022 FIFA qualification, losing against Cambodia twice in the first round and was eliminated. The preliminary camp for the matches were controversially organised by two different federations. Faisal Saleh Hayat-led Pakistan Football Federation, which was internationally recognised, and non-FIFA recognised Ashfaq Hussain Shah group, which formed a parallel PFF, coming into power by third-party interference through the PFF elections conducted by the Supreme Court.

Pakistan were once again suspended from all football activities by FIFA on 7 April 2021. The suspension was lifted on 29 June 2022.

==== Comeback to International Football (2022–2024) ====
Pakistan made their comeback by playing a friendly match against Nepal in November 2022, losing 0–1 in a late minute goal. They played a second friendly match against Maldives in March 2023 losing 0–1.

Pakistan subsequently took part in the 2023 Mauritius Four Nations Cup featuring Mauritius, Kenya, Djibouti and the 2023 SAFF Championship alongside India, Kuwait and Nepal in the group stages, losing all six matches and finishing last in their group in each competition.

On 27 July 2023, the draw for the first round of the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification took place in which Pakistan were drawn once again against Cambodia, followed by the appointment of the English coach Stephen Constantine. In the first leg in Phnom Penh, Pakistan contested in a goalless 0–0 draw. Pakistan won their second leg beating Cambodia 1–0 in Islamabad, due to a goal by Harun Hamid, recording their first-ever victory in World Cup qualifiers in their first fixture at home for eight years, and qualifying for the second round for the first time.

Following the victory in Islamabad, the Shaheens were drawn in a group with Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Tajikistan. Being the 193rd ranked team, Pakistan were the lowest-ranked team in the qualifiers, and terminated the campaign losing all the games in the group.

====2025 FIFA Suspension====

Pakistan was suspended from all football activities again by FIFA on 6 February 2025 due to failing to adopt a version of the PFF constitution approved by FIFA and the AFC that would have guaranteed fair elections.

== Team image ==
===Kit===
The Pakistan national team&#x27;s home kit has always been a green shirt and white shorts. The colours are derived from the flag of Pakistan which is a green field with a white crescent moon and five-rayed star at its centre, and a vertical white stripe at the hoist side. The away shirt colour has changed several times. The national team has used white shirt with white shorts or white shirt with green shorts. Historically, white shirt with green shorts is the most often used colour combination.

===Home stadiums===
For the first fifty years of their existence, Pakistan played their home matches at various multi-purpose stadiums all around the country, particularly in Karachi. The Hockey Club stadium hosted the 1974 RCD Cup and the inaugural 1976 Quaid-e-Azam International Cup. The consequent 1982 Quaid-e-Azam International Cup was held at the cricket National Stadium, while the 1985 edition was held at the Peshawar Stadium.

Although the Pakistan Football Federation doesn&#x27;t own any stadium to date, since the 1980s Pakistan plays majority of their home matches at the Jinnah Sports Stadium in the capital Islamabad which first hosted the 1986 Quaid-e-Azam International Cup, and where the senior team won the 1989 South Asian Games. By the 1990s, the Railway Stadium in Lahore also served as one of the primary venues which also hosted the inaugural 1993 SAARC Gold Cup. 

By the 2000s, several alternative stadiums emerged such as Karachi&#x27;s People&#x27;s Football Stadium and the Punjab Stadium in Lahore located near the headquarters of the Pakistan Football Federation.

The Jinnah Sports Stadium is the largest football stadium in Pakistan with a capacity of over 45,000, whereas the People&#x27;s Football Stadium is second largest with 40,000.

=== Pakistan B ===

In the Quaid-e-Azam International Cup, two Pakistan national teams usually participated, the Pakistan national football team under the name of &quot;Pakistan Greens&quot;, and the Pakistan national B team under the name of &quot;Pakistan Reds&quot; in 1976, &quot;Pakistan Blue&quot; in 1982, and &quot;Pakistan White&quot; in 1985, 1986 and 1987. Alongside the senior national team, the other national team mainly consisted of &quot;second string&quot; or youth international players. Having a two separate teams was very common during the 80s and 90s for developing South Asian countries, both Nepal (Nepal B) and Bangladesh (Bangladesh B) had second string team&#x27;s. At the Afghanistan Republic Day Festival Cup in 1977, the B team managed by Qayyum Changezi also participated under the name of &quot;Shaheen FC&quot;. In May 1978, the team took part in a Youth Tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where the team faced Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Kenya.

At the inaugural 1993 South Asian Association of Regional Co-operation Gold Cup (now named SAFF Championship) held in Pakistan, Pakistan White also played exhibition matches against the national sides participating in the tournament.

===Rivalries===
==== India ====

Pakistan&#x27;s arch-rivals in several sports including football are India. The two teams first met at the 1952 Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament, which ended in a goalless draw and both teams crowned champions of the tournament. India first won at the consequent 1953 Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament with a 1–0 win, with Neville D&#x27;Souza scoring a goal. Pakistan men’s football team recorded its first official win over India at the 1960 AFC Asian Cup qualification with Abdullah Rahi netting the winner. Currently, Pakistan has won three games, there have been eight draws and sixteen wins for India among the 27 games played so far. In addition, both teams have faced each other two times in unofficial exhibition matches after the finalisation of the 1953 and 1955 Asian Quadrangular Football Tournament editions, with Pakistan winning both times by 1–0.

==== Afghanistan ====
Pakistan is currently rivals with Afghanistan in many sports, including cricket and football. The national teams of Pakistan and Afghanistan regularly held sporting events in early years, but diplomatic ties were cut after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. The ensuing civil war and political instability in Afghanistan prevented the two sides from meeting again until 2003. Due to the historical, cultural and political relationship between the two countries, contests against Pakistan generate much enthusiasm amongst Afghan football fans on account of their mutual relations and have been referred to as a &quot;rivalry&quot;, although the interest in Pakistan toward the rivalry and for football in general is more muted.

<text>The Palestine national football team (), governed by the Palestinian Football Association, represents Palestine in men&#x27;s international football. The squad is under the global jurisdiction of FIFA, and is governed continentally by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

A football federation in Mandatory Palestine was founded in 1928. The national team was not recognized by FIFA until 1998, after the creation of the Palestinian National Authority. The same year, Palestine played their first FIFA-recognized match in a 3–1 defeat to Lebanon in a friendly. The team has won the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup, thanks to a 1–0 win over the Philippines in the final. Their win in the competition qualified them to the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, marking their first appearance in the competition. Palestine also qualified to the following edition of the Asian Cup in 2019, their first through regular qualification. They have yet to qualify for the World Cup.

The Palestinian team is known by various nicknames: &quot;Lions of Canaan&quot; (), &quot;the Fedayoon&quot; (), &quot;the Knights&quot; (). Their main colours are red and white. The team reached an all-time high position of 73rd in the FIFA ranking in February 2018, after going on a 12-match unbeaten streak, from 29 March 2016 to 22 March 2018. Palestine&#x27;s main venue is Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium in Al-Ram, although they have been forced to play in neutral stadiums for home matches on numerous occasions.

== History ==
=== 1928–1940: Mandatory Palestine ===

Football has a long tradition in Palestine. The game was originally introduced during the time of the Ottoman Empire. The Palestinian Football Association was formed in August 1928, and joined FIFA in June 1929, but at the time, the association was made up of Arab clubs, Jewish clubs, and clubs representing British policemen and soldiers serving in the region during the British Mandate rule that spanned the period between World War I and the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948.

The Mandatory Palestine national team made its debut against Cairo (&quot;Egypt&quot;) in 1934 FIFA World Cup qualification, losing 0–5 in Cairo, Egypt. The team played five international matches, including a friendly match against Lebanon that Palestine won 1–5; until the British Mandate for Palestine national team was dissolved. During those five games, the national team fielded only Jewish players.

Maccabi leader Yosef Yekutieli attempted for Maccabi Association&#x27;s membership in the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) as early as 1925. The application was turned down, as only associations representing states could be admitted as members. Yekutieli thus decided to create the Palestine Football Association (PFA). Maccabi officials were obliged to include Arab teams. The association&#x27;s first session was held in the summer of 1928. Notwithstanding the fourteen Jewish representatives that partook, one Arab delegate participated – an individual representing Arab Sports Club of Jerusalem. FIFA accepted the PFA on 17 May 1929 and during the first years of the PFA, Arab clubs partook in PFA sanctioned-matches. During this time, 11 of the 69 PFA teams were Arab, but after the mid-1930s, until its transformation into the IFA, its membership became largely Jewish with only minor Arab membership.

=== 1931–1998: Arab representation and first tournaments ===
The Arab Palestinian Sports Federation (APSF) was born in April 1931 due to the belief that the PFA did not represent Arab interests. A Palestinian national team played its first match against a squad from the American University of Beirut in the same year according to &quot;Falastin&quot;. Due to the 1936 revolt, the activities of the APSF were hampered and the federation completely disappeared toward the end of the 1930s.

While the PFA was established in 1928, the first international match played by Palestine was an 8–1 defeat away to Egypt in 1953. The last game saw Palestine lose to Libya 5–2, to finish bottom of the group.

At the 1965 Arab Games, Palestine were grouped with Aden, Iraq, Lebanon and the United Arab Republic. They finished second, thus advancing to the semi-finals for the first time. Palestine faced Sudan and were beaten 2–1. In the third place play-off, Palestine met Libya, where they lost 4–2. Palestine participated in the 1966 Arab Cup held in Iraq; they were drawn in Group B alongside Syria, Libya and North Yemen. Starting with a 0–0 draw to Libya, Palestine beat North Yemen 7–0 before losing 3–1 to Syria. They ended the tournament with four points and failed to qualify to the knock-out stages of the competition.

Palestine were drawn alongside Libya, North Yemen and Syria in the 1966 Arab Cup. With one win, a draw and a loss, Palestine was eliminated in the group stage.

The national team participated in the 1976 Arab Games, held in Damascus. Palestine started their campaign with two defeats to Morocco (3–0) and Saudi Arabia (3–1), before defeating Jordan (2–1). They lost to hosts Syria (2–0) in their fourth game of the tournament, drew against South Yemen (0–0), and finished with a win against Mauritania (1–0) to end the tournament in 6th place. Palestine participated in the 1992 Arab Cup held in Syria; they were drawn in Group B alongside the hosts and Saudi Arabia but were eliminated from the group stage after one draw and one loss.

=== 1998–2014: International recognition ===
In May 1995, the PFA was granted the status of provisional member in FIFA. Palestine eventually gained FIFA membership on 8 June 1998 after numerous attempts since 1946. Under Ricardo Carugati, Palestine played their first official matches in July 1998 against Lebanon, Jordan and Syria at the 1998 Arab Cup qualification.

In the next year, Palestine took part in the 1999 Arab Games held in Jordan. There, they won games against Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, drew with Libya and Syria, while only losing to hosts Jordan. Palestine finished in the third-place which is their best result to date. In their first ever Asian Cup qualification, Palestine was drawn into a five-team group with Jordan, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, and Qatar. A single victory 2–0 against Pakistan proved to be not enough to qualify as they lost 1–0 to Qatar, 5–1 to Jordan before finishing the campaign with a 2–0 defeat to Kazakhstan.

Managed by Mustafa Yacoub, Palestine drew into Group C of the 2002 World Cup qualification along with Hong Kong, Malaysia and Qatar. The team finished in second place. In the 2002 Arab Cup, Palestine crashed out of the group stage. Under Nicola Hadwa Shahwan, the team were drawn alongside Kuwait, Qatar and Singapore. Palestine finished last with two points.

After a failed Asian Cup qualifying campaign, the PFA hired Austrian coach Alfred Riedl to lead the team during the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification. Palestine was included in a group with Uzbekistan, Iraq and Chinese Taipei. They won both games against Chinese Taipei, drew 2–2 with Iraq, however this was insufficient for Palestine to advance beyond the second round as they lost both fixtures versus Uzbekistan 3–0 apart from a 3–0 defeat at the hands of Iraq. Palestine took part in the inaugural AFC Challenge Cup held in Bangladesh. They were drawn alongside the host team, Cambodia and Guam. In the group stage, Palestine registered their biggest win ever, a 11–0 victory over Guam. Palestine advanced from Group C and met Kyrgyzstan in the quarter-finals. After playing a goal-lees first half, they were beaten with a last-gasp goal. In the summer of 2006, Palestine achieved its highest FIFA ranking at 115, placing them 16th in the Asian continent.

Managed by Azmi Nassar, Palestine were drawn with China national football team, Iraq and Singapore during the 2007 Asian Cup qualification. Palestine finished in the bottom with 4 points. They achieved their only win against Singapore 1–0.

In 2008, with the help of FIFA&#x27;s goal program, the PFA built the Faisal Al-Husseini International Stadium, and on 26 October 2008. Palestine held a match at their home for the first time since they became a member of FIFA, a 1–1 draw with Jordan ahead of a crowd of over 7,000. Palestine entered the first round of 2010 World Cup qualification and were eliminated after only one match that finished 4–0 for Singapore. The second leg was not played as scheduled due to the Palestinian team being barred from traveling. However, the FIFA refused to reschedule the match and Palestine forfeited the game 3–0.

The 2010 AFC Challenge Cup qualifying draw put Palestine in Group C, with Afghanistan (later withdrew), Kyrgyzstan, and Nepal. They started the run with a goalless draw against hosts Nepal. The final game finished in a 1–1 draw with Kyrgyzstan to miss the chance of qualification on goal difference.

Palestine drew into group C with Jordan, Libya and Sudan for the 2011 Arab Games. They lost the opening match 4–1 to Jordan in Doha. The team improved in the second match against Libya which finished 1–1. The last game against Sudan was won by Palestine 2–0 to clinch the second-place berth in the tournament. At the semi-finals they lost 3–1 to Bahrain. The team completed their campaign with a 3–0 loss to Kuwait.

During the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Palestine were drawn with Afghanistan in the first round. The first leg was won 2–0, while the second leg ended in a draw 1–1. On 3 July 2011, the first World Cup qualifying match played at home, Palestine took the lead with a long-range shot by Houssam Wadi. Palestine reached the second round to face Thailand. The first match was lost 1–0 in Buriram, while the second match resulted in Palestine&#x27;s elimination.

The PFA chose not to renew Moussa Bezaz&#x27;s contract after exiting the second round of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying. Jamal Mahmoud, a former player and manager of Al-Wehdat, was announced as the national team manager in November 2011, after two disastrous friendly matches, without a permanent manager saw defeats against Indonesia and Iran 4–1 and 7–0, respectively. Palestine made history by playing and defeating their first UEFA rival Azerbaijan, on 2–0. The match was later registered as unofficial for unknown reasons.

Mahmoud later led the team in the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup. In the run-up, Palestine finished group play at the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup without conceding a goal after 2–0 wins over Nepal and Maldives alongside a 0–0 draw against Turkmenistan on the way to a semifinal exit at the hands of eventual champions North Korea. The third place play-off ended in a 4–3 loss against the Philippines. During the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup qualification, Palestine drew into Group D with Bangladesh, Nepal and the Northern Mariana Islands. They started with a hard win against Bangladesh 1–0. The next game ended in a 9–0 rout over the Northern Mariana Islands. The qualifiers finished in a goalless draw against Nepal to earn a second straight AFC Challenge Cup berth.

=== 2014–2019: Recent success ===

The team ended up winning the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup by drawing only one of the 5 matches without conceding a goal. In the opening match, Palestine won against Kyrgyzstan with a last-gasp goal by Abdelhamid Abuhabib. In the next group game, they played against Myanmar and won 2–0. The ended the first round with a 0–0 draw against hosts Maldives. Palestine advanced as group winners to the semi-finals where they faced Afghanistan. The match ended in favor of the Palestinians with a 2–0 win. At the final, Palestine clinched the win over the Philippines with a lone goal scored by Ashraf Nu&#x27;man through a free-kick. The victory gave the Palestine team their first major trophy and guaranteed their participation in the next year&#x27;s AFC Asian Cup. Following its 2014 AFC Challenge Cup win and qualification for the Asian Cup, Jamal Mahmoud resigned as national team manager citing differences with the Palestine Football Association.

Palestine was placed in Group D along with Japan, Jordan and Iraq in the 2015 AFC Asian Cup having lost all three group matches. They started their campaign with a 0–4 defeat by Japan. In the second game Palestine were beaten 1–5, with the opposing team ending the first half with a 3 goals lead. In the second half, Palestine scored their first ever Asian Cup goal by Jaka Ihbeisheh six minutes before the end. However, at this point they were eliminated. The participation ended with a 0–2 defeat to Iraq. After a disastrous performance in the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, the PFA appointed Olympic team manager Abdel Nasser Barakat as national team manager, who then decided not to pick several veteran players as the team moved to overhaul.

Palestine registered two 6–0 wins over Malaysia during 2018 World Cup qualifying. Those results, combined with a 0–0 draw at home to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, placed Palestine close to qualification for the third round of Asian World Cup qualifiers. They were eliminated from the qualification following a 2–0 defeat to the UAE on 24 March 2016. They won their final FIFA World Cup qualification match at home 7–0 against Timor-Leste, five days later.

Although eliminated from the World Cup, Palestine advanced to the third round of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification. Drawn with Oman, the Maldives and Bhutan, Palestine came second in the group with five wins and one defeat, and qualified to the 2019 AFC Asian Cup for the first time through regular qualification. Between February and March 2018, Palestine reached their best ever FIFA ranking of 73rd, thanks to an unprecedented 12-match unbeaten streak (between 29 March 2016 and 22 March 2018), winning eight and drawing four. In February 2018, Palestine achieved their best-ever FIFA ranking (73rd).

On 19 December 2017, Julio César Baldivieso was hired after Abdel Nasser Barakat was released. The hiring was widely criticized by Palestinian fans. On 22 April 2018, the PFA appointed Noureddine Ould Ali as head coach to lead the team in the next period. Palestine was crowned champion of the 2018 Bangabandhu Cup as an invited country to the tournament. In the road to the final, they topped their group with 6 points, defeating Tajikistan 2–0 before winning against Nepal 1–0 with a Khaled Salem header. In the semi-final Palestine knocked out Bangladesh 2–0 with the goals coming in each half. At the final, Palestine played Tajikistan for the second time. The match ended 0–0 in regular time, to be decided in a penalty shoot-out which Palestine won 4–3.

Drawn with Australia, Syria and Jordan, Palestine started their 2019 AFC Asian Cup campaign on 6 January 2019 with a 0–0 draw to Syria. Five days later, Palestine faced title-holders Australia; a header by Jamie Maclaren and a goal by Awer Mabil sent Palestine trailing 2–0 at half-time. Australia sealed the win with a 90th-minute header from Apostolos Giannou. On 15 January 2019, Palestine headed into their last group-stage match needing all three points against Jordan, and hoping for a Syria win against Australia. In the 17th minute, Palestine came close to scoring when Amer Shafi produced a fingertip save to keep out Abdelatif Bahdari. In the second half, Oday Dabbagh failed to score from two headers, and the match ended in a 0–0 draw.

=== 2019–2023: Decline and managerial instability ===
Between July and August 2019, Palestine participated in the 2019 WAFF Championship; they were drawn with hosts Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. Palestine ended the tournament with two wins, one draw and one defeat, and finished in second place in their group: however, this wasn&#x27;t enough to reach the final.

Palestine were drawn with Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Uzbekistan, Yemen at the 2022 World Cup qualification. They kicked-off with a historic win over Uzbekistan 2–0 in Al-Ram. Five days later, Palestine were defeated 2–1 to Singapore. On 15 October 2019, Palestine drew 0–0 with Saudi Arabia, during which its decades-long boycott of play in the West Bank came to an end in protest against Israel&#x27;s control over Palestinian territories. Thereafter, the team lost again to Yemen 1–0. This was later followed with another away loss to Uzbekistan, thus placing Palestine in the bottom and reducing the country&#x27;s opportunity to reach the final round.

Manager Noureddine Ould Ali lost his job after 2022 World Cup qualification resumed in 2021 following a 5–0 loss to Saudi Arabia. In April 2021, Tunisian coach Makram Daboub, who had previously worked as a goalkeeping coach under the leadership of Noureddine Ould Ali, who was dismissed, was assigned to supervise the national team on a temporary basis. Daboub led Palestine to victory over Singapore and Yemen. In June 2022, Palestine qualified for their third straight AFC Asian Cup finals, winning all three games against Mongolia, Yemen and Philippines.

=== 2024–present: Revival and history made ===
On 23 January 2024, Palestine recorded their first ever Asian Cup victory and their first ever qualification to the Asian Cup knockout stage after a 3–0 victory over Hong Kong in the 2023 AFC Asian Cup. They ended up losing 1–2 to the hosts Qatar in the quarterfinal despite taking the lead through Oday Dabbagh&#x27;s goal in the 37th minute.

On 7 June 2024, Palestine qualified to the Third Round of FIFA World Cup qualification for the first time after a 0–0 draw against Lebanon, securing second place in their qualification group behind Australia. This result also saw them qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, their fourth consecutive qualification to the tournament.

== Problems relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict ==
The Palestinian Football Association faces problems in training and playing due to the Israeli conflict with the Palestinians.

Because of travel restrictions placed by Israel upon people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the difficulty in obtaining an exit visa from Israel, many players in the team are drawn from the Palestinian diaspora, from as far away as Chile and the United States. Recently, Israel&#x27;s refusal to issue exit visas has resulted in players, or in some case the entire team, being unable to represent the territories. In November 2006 all players based inside the West Bank and Gaza Strip were denied exit visas. The AFC cancelled the match since both teams had been eliminated from the competition by virtue of their previous results against China and Iraq.

In October 2007, the second leg of a crucial 2010 World Cup qualifier between Palestine and Singapore was not played due to Palestine&#x27;s inability to obtain exit visas. The AFC and FIFA decided not to reschedule the match despite protests from the PFA, and Singapore was awarded a 3–0 forfeit for their actions. In May 2008, the team was not allowed to travel to the 2008 AFC Challenge Cup. After a 2011 World Cup qualifier against Thailand, two starters, Mohammed Samara and Majed Abusidu, were refused entry to the West Bank and therefore could not travel back with the team from Thailand.

Striker Ziyad Al-Kord was prevented from travelling and had his house destroyed. Tariq al Quto was killed by the Israel Defense Forces, and during Operation Cast Lead, three Palestinian footballers, Ayman Alkurd, Shadi Sbakh, and Wajeh Moshtahe, were among the Palestinian casualties.

Mahmoud Sarsak was administratively detained by Israel in July 2009 for being a member of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine; following a hunger strike and international pressure on his behalf from FIFA president Sepp Blatter, he was released in July 2012. In April of 2012, Olympic Team goalkeeper Omar Abu Ruways was arrested by Israel in connection with an attack on IDF soldiers.

Sameh Maraaba was arrested in April after returning with his team from training in Qatar. The Shin Bet accused Maraaba of exploiting his status as a Palestinian football player to act as a courier for Hamas. Shin Bet released a statement in which it contended that Maraaba admitted that, before he left for Qatar, he met a senior Hamas operative in Kalkilya, asked him to meet an operative from Hamas&#x27; military wing in Qatar and received money, a cellphone and written messages which he brought back to Kalkilya.

Palestinian facilities, such as the Palestine Stadium, have been damaged in military conflicts.

In addition, there have been reports of Israeli forces intentionally shooting Palestinian footballers in the knees and feet, including on one occasion ten bullets in the feet of 19 year old footballer Jawhar Nasser Jawhar.

In 2023, the team had to pull out of the Merdeka Tournament in Malaysia due to the Israel–Hamas war in October. Later that year, all 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification matches had to be held in neutral venues for the same reasons, though Algeria offered to host and was accepted by the PFA until FIFA and the AFC rejected the deal, stating that Palestine needed to play in AFC member venues, resulting in them going to Kuwait, Qatar, and other countries in the Islamic world.

<text>The kyat ( or ; ; ISO 4217 code MMK) is the currency of Myanmar (Burma). The typical notation for the kyat is &quot;K&quot; (singular) and &quot;Ks.&quot; (plural), placed before the numerals followed by &quot;/-&quot;. Amounts less than K. 1/- are typically denoted with the number of pyas following &quot;-/&quot; (e.g. -/ denotes half a kyat).

The term &quot;kyat&quot; derives from the Burmese unit &quot;kyattha&quot; (), equal to 16.3 (16.329324593) grams of silver.

==Current MMK exchange rates==

From 2001 to 2012, the official exchange rate varied between Ks. 5/ and Ks. 6/ per US dollar (Ks. 8/ to Ks. 7/- per euro). However, the street rate (black market rate), which more accurately took into account the standing of the national economy, has varied from Ks. 750/- to Ks. 1,335/- per USD (Ks. 985/- to Ks. 1,475/- per EUR). The black market exchange rates (USD to MMK) decrease during the peak of the tourist season in Burma (December to January). During the 2003 Myanmar banking crisis, the kyat&#x27;s black market rate appreciated when distrust in kyat-deposited banks increased demand for kyat banknotes. At its peak, the kyat traded for as high as Ks. 850/- per USD.

On 2 April 2012, the Central Bank of Myanmar announced that the value of the kyat against the US dollar would float, setting an initial rate of Ks.818/- per US dollar.

On 20 March 2013, the Finance Ministry announced that it would abolish Foreign Exchange Certificates (FEC), which were mandatory for tourists to buy at least US$200 worth of until 2003, a measure used to discourage visitors from exchanging on the black market.

More than a year after a coup d&#x27;état caused the overthrow of the elected government, capital flight from Myanmar and inflation accelerated, causing the value of the kyat to plummet to 3500 kyats per USD in the informal market . By May 2024, the exchange rate had increased to 5000/- per USD on the black market, with the junta reportedly abandoning the fixed exchange rate of 2100.

==History==

===First kyat, 1852–1889===

The kyat was a denomination of both silver and gold coinages in Burma until 1889. It was divided into 16 &quot;pe&quot;, each of 4 &quot;pya&quot;, with the &quot;mu&quot; and &quot;mat&quot; worth 2 and 4 pe, respectively. Nominally, 16 silver kyats equal 1 gold kyat. The silver kyat was equivalent to the Indian rupee, which replaced the kyat after Burma was conquered by the British.

===Second Kyat, 1943–1945===

When the Japanese occupied Burma in 1942, they introduced a currency based on the rupee. This was later replaced by banknotes in all kyat denominations. This kyat was subdivided into 100 &quot;cents&quot;. The currency became worthless at the end of the war when the Burmese rupee was reintroduced in 1945.

===Third kyat, 1952–present===

The present kyat was introduced on 1 July 1952. It replaced the rupee at par. Decimalisation also took place, with the kyat subdivided into 100 &quot;pyas&quot;.

==Coins==

===First kyat===

During the Konbaung dynasty, Mindon Min, the second to last King of Burma, established the Royal Mint in Mandalay (Central Burma). The dies were made in Paris. Silver coins were minted in denominations of 1 pe, 1 mu (2 pe), 1 mat (4 pe), 5 mu (8 pe) and 1 kyat, with gold 1 pe and 1 mu. The obverses bore the Royal Peacock Seal, from which the coins got their name. The reverse contained the denomination and mint date (in the Burmese era, which starts from AD 638). In the 1860s and 1870s, lead coins were issued for and pya, with copper, brass, tin and iron pe (1 pya) and copper 2 pya. Further gold coins were issued in 1866 for 1 pe, mu and 1 kyat, with 5 mu issued in 1878.

===Second kyat===

No coins were issued for this currency.

===Third kyat===

In 1952, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 pyas and K 1/-. The new coins bore the same obverse figure of the Chinthe from the Second kyat coins and the same reverse design, with the value of the coin in Burmese script and numerals surrounded by Burmese flower designs.

In 1966, all coins were redesigned to feature Aung San on the obverse and were all changed in composition to aluminium. Furthermore, the coins were slightly reduced in size. However, they retained the same shapes and overall appearance of the previous series of coins. These were circulated until being discontinued in 1983.

In 1983, a new series of coins was issued in bronze or brass 5, 10, 25, 50 pyas and cupro-nickel 1 kyat. Although the 25 pyas were initially round, it was later redesigned as hexagonal due to size and appearance confusions with the 10 and 50 pyas. These would be the last official series of coins to be issued under the name of &quot;Burma.&quot;

1 pya coins were last minted in 1966, with the 5 and 25 pyas last minted in 1987 and the 10 and 50 pyas in 1991.

In 1999, a new series of coins was issued in denominations of bronze K 1/-, brass Ks. 5/- and Ks. 10/-, and cupro-nickel Ks. 50/- and Ks. 100/- under the name &quot;Central Bank of Myanmar.&quot; These are also the first coins of Burma to depict Latin letters. These coins were intended for vendors and services as an alternative to large amounts of worn out, low denomination banknotes. High inflation has since pushed these coins out of circulation.

In late 2008, the Myanmar government announced that new Ks. 50/- and Ks. 100/- coins would be issued. According to newspaper articles, the new Ks. 50/- coin would be made of copper, with the usual Burmese lion on the obverse and the Lotus Fountain from Naypyidaw on the reverse. The Ks.100/- coin would be of cupro-nickel and depict the Burmese lion on the obverse and the value on the reverse.

==Banknotes==

===First kyat===

No banknotes were issued for this currency.

===Second kyat===

The Burma State Bank issued notes for K 1/-, Ks. 5/-, Ks. 10/- and Ks. 100/- in 1944, followed by a further issue of Ks. 100/- notes in 1945.

===Third kyat===

In 1952, the Union Bank of Burma formed a currency board which took over control of the issuing of currency and a more important change to the currency was the introduction of the decimal system in which 1 kyat was decimalised into 100 pyas.

On 12 February 1958, the Union Bank of Burma introduced the first kyat notes, in denominations of K 1/-, Ks. 5/-, Ks. 10/- and Ks. 100/-. These were very similar in design to the last series of rupee notes, issued earlier. Later on, 21 August 1958, Ks. 20/- and Ks. 50/- notes were introduced. The Ks. 50/- and Ks. 100/- notes were demonetised on 15 May 1964. This was the first of several demonetisations, ostensibly carried out with the aim of fighting black marketeering.

Ever since the Third Kyat was introduced, the Burmese currency has no indication of the date in which the note came into circulation nor the signature of the issuing authority.

==== 1965–1971 ====

The People&#x27;s Bank of Burma took over note production in 1965 with an issue of K 1/-, Ks. 5/-, Ks. 10/- and Ks. 20/- notes.

==== 1972–1988 ====

In 1972, the Union of Burma Bank took over note issuance, with notes introduced between 1972 and 1979 for K 1/-, Ks. 5/-, Ks. 10/-, Ks. 25/-, Ks. 50/- and Ks. 100/-. The notes were printed by the Security Printing Works in Wazi, Upper Burma (established c. 1972) under the technical direction of German printing firm Giesecke &amp; Devrient.

On 3 November 1985, the Ks. 50/-, and Ks. 100/- notes were demonetized without warning, though the public was allowed to exchange limited amounts of these old notes for new ones. All other denominations then in circulation remained legal tender. On 10 November 1985, Ks. 75/- notes were introduced, the odd denomination possibly chosen because of dictator general Ne Win&#x27;s predilection for numerology; the Ks. 75/- note was supposedly introduced to commemorate his 75th birthday. It was followed by the introduction of Ks. 15/- and Ks. 35/- notes on 1 August 1986.

Only two years later, on 5 September 1987, the government demonetised the Ks. 25/-, Ks. 35/-, and Ks. 75/- notes without warning or compensation, rendering some 75% of the country&#x27;s currency worthless and eliminating the savings of millions of Burmese people. On 22 September 1987, banknotes for Ks. 45/- and Ks. 90/- were introduced, both of which incorporated Ne Win&#x27;s favourite number, nine. The resulting economic disturbances led to serious riots and eventually a coup d&#x27;état in 1988 by General Saw Maung.
Banknotes of K -/, K 1/- and Ks. 5/- are rare. Most daily transactions are rounded up to the nearest Ks.10/-.

==== 1989–present ====

Following the change of the country&#x27;s name to Myanmar on 20 June 1989, new notes were issued, returning to more practical denominations. Old notes were not demonetised, but simply allowed to fall into disuse through inflation as well as wear and tear. On 1 March 1990, K 1/- notes were issued, followed by Ks.200/- notes on 27 March 1990. On 27 March 1994, notes for K -/ (50 pyas), Ks. 20/-, Ks. 50/-, Ks. 100/-, and Ks. 500/- were issued, followed on 1 May 1995, by new Ks. 5/- and Ks. 10/- notes. Ks. 1,000/- notes were introduced in November 1998.

In 2003, as public trust eroded during the 2003 Myanmar banking crisis, rumours of another pending demonetisation swept through the country, which the junta denied. The rumours did not materialize.

In 2004, the sizes of the Ks. 200/-, Ks. 500/-, and Ks. 1,000/- notes were reduced to make all Burmese banknotes uniform in size. Larger notes were allowed to remain in circulation. K -/, K 1/-, Ks. 5/-, Ks. 10/- and Ks. 20/- banknotes are now rarely seen, because of their low value.

=====New banknotes of higher denominations=====

On 1 October 2009, Ks. 5,000/- banknotes were issued measuring 150 x 70 mm, with images of a white elephant and the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw This new denomination was five times larger than the previous largest denomination. Some welcomed a higher value note that reduced the number of banknotes needed for transaction. Other responses suggested widespread fear that the banknote would simply fuel the inflation. This fear may have been supported by a jump in the black market exchange rates following the public announcement of the banknote.

On 9 June 2012, the Central Bank announced that Ks. 10,000/- notes would be introduced into circulation to better facilitate financial transactions in a largely cash-oriented economy. They were issued on 15 June 2012.

On 1 October 2014, the Central Bank introduced new Ks. 5,000/- banknotes with additional security features to prevent counterfeiting. The revised notes are varnished and have enhanced printing, watermarks, and security thread. The new notes remained the same size, colour and design as the 2009 issue, which continues to be used. The new notes followed recent incidents of counterfeit Ks. 5,000/- and Ks. 10,000/- banknotes, including a 12 September 2014 seizure of Ks. 10,000/- notes and a printer allegedly used to make them.

In 2019, the Central Bank of Myanmar issued a new series of banknotes that feature a portrait of its national hero Aung San after longstanding calls to redesign the kyat. The first denomination issued for this new series was the Ks. 1,000/- banknote, which was issued into circulation on 4 January 2020, followed by the Ks. 500/- banknote on 19 July 2020.

In July 2023, a new Ks. 20,000/- banknote was announced amidst economic instability from the aftermath of the 2021 Myanmar coup d&#x27;état. The reasoning was not explained, but was likely to commemorate the birth of a white elephant and the construction of the Maravijaya Buddha statue in Naypyidaw. The banknote saw limited circulation at only select central bank branches.

===Foreign exchange certificates===

In 1993, Myanmar began issuing foreign exchange certificates (FEC) denominated in US dollars in denominations of $1, $5, $10, and $20. These were exchanged on a parity ratio with and were valued separately from the regular kyat. Conversion of foreign currency into kyats was made illegal as exchange rates were set artificially high. During much of this period, two valuations of the Myanmar kyat emerged; The official rate which averaged around Ks. 6/- = US$1, and the black market rate which averaged tens of times higher. Foreign visitors to Myanmar could only transact currency in FEC&#x27;s or could only obtain kyats at the artificially high official rates. Illegal peddlers often had to be sought out to exchange currency.

On 1 April 2012, the Government of Myanmar began allowing for a managed float of the kyat and legalised the use and exchange of foreign currencies in Myanmar to better reflect the global exchange rates, attract investment, and to weaken the black markets. On 20 March 2013, the government announced the discontinuation and gradual withdrawal of FEC&#x27;s.

=== Redesign proposal ===

Following the removal of General Aung San&#x27;s portraits from the banknotes of the Burmese kyat in 1987, there have been calls by both the public and opposition politicians to reinstate them, as well as criticizing the use of animals on banknotes in circulation. Writer Nyi Maung notes that foreign countries use portraits of their national leaders and heroes on their banknotes, such as Thailand, and encourages the reinstatement of General Aung San&#x27;s portrait on the kyat to remember his legacy. In October 2017, a proposal was submitted by National League for Democracy MP Aung Khin Win to debate the issue in the Pyithu Hluttaw.

While the Central Bank of Myanmar argues that the cost of reprinting new notes bearing the General&#x27;s portrait would be monumental considering Myanmar&#x27;s current economic situation, Aung Khin Win stated that new notes would only be reprinted to replace damaged notes or in the release of new denominations or size of kyat banknotes.

The debate on this issue took place in the Pyithu Hluttaw on 17 November 2017. The proposal was wholly rejected by the military bloc, but it was passed with 286 votes for, and 109 against.

==== 2020 redesign ====

On 21 December 2019, the Central Bank of Myanmar announced that in conjunction with the 72nd anniversary of Myanmar&#x27;s independence, it would begin circulating Ks. 1,000/- notes bearing the portrait of General Aung San. The bank notes were released to the public on 4 January 2020, marking the return of the national icon&#x27;s image to the country&#x27;s currency for the first time in thirty years.

On 18 June 2020, the Central Bank of Myanmar announced that it would begin circulating Ks. 500/- notes bearing the portrait of General Aung San on 19 July 2020, in conjunction with the 73rd anniversary of Martyr&#x27;s Day.

Both the Ks. 500/- and Ks. 1,000/- banknotes bearing Aung San&#x27;s portrait, are in concurrent circulation with the existing chinthe portrait bank notes, which will continue to remain in legal tender.

Founded on October 16, 1923, and based mainly at the namesake studio lot in Burbank, California, it is the seventh-oldest global film studio and the fifth-oldest in the United States, a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA) and one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; major film studios.

The Walt Disney Studios has prominent film production companies including Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures. Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures distributes and markets the majority of the content produced by these studios for both theatrical exhibition and the company&#x27;s streaming services. In 2019, Disney posted an industry record of $13.2 billion at the global box office. The studio owns eight of the top ten highest-grossing films of all time worldwide, and several of the highest-grossing film franchises of all time.

==Background==
Walt Disney Productions began production of their first feature-length animated film in 1934. Taking three years to complete, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, premiered in December 1937 and became the highest-grossing film of that time by 1939. In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such as &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; (1941) and &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946). That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release of &quot;Seal Island&quot; (1948), the first of the &quot;True-Life Adventures&quot; series and a subsequent Academy Award winner for Best Live-Action Short Film.

Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release of &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures. By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors as RKO Radio Pictures and United Artists and formed their own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution. Disney Productions purchased in 1959 the Golden Oak Ranch for feature films and television series productions complimenting its main Burbank studio.

==History==
=== 1980s ===
By the 1980s, the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s collection of film units emerged as one of Hollywood&#x27;s major film studios, mostly due to newly designed efforts in branding strategies, a resurgence of Walt Disney Productions&#x27; animated releases and unprecedented box office successes, particularly from Touchstone Pictures. The Walt Disney Productions film division was incorporated on as Walt Disney Pictures. In April 1983, Richard Berger was hired by Disney CEO Ron W. Miller as film president. Berger diversified the studio&#x27;s output by green-lighting &quot;more adult, more mature&quot; films targeted toward adult audiences. As a result, Touchstone Films was started by Miller in February 1984 as a label for their films (rated PG and higher) with an expected half of Disney&#x27;s 6 to 8 films yearly slate would be released under the label. Berger was pushed out as a new CEO was appointed for Walt Disney Productions later in 1984, as Michael Eisner brought his own film chief, Jeffrey Katzenberg and film studio president, Richard H. Frank. Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures were formed within that unit on February 15, 1984, and February 1, 1989, respectively.

In October 1984, Daily Variety had identified Disney as the seventh major film studio due to the hiring of Eisner as Disney chairman and his plans for the company. In late 1984, Fred Silverman and his InterMedia production company has struck a deal with the Walt Disney Studios. Organized in 1985, Silver Screen Partners II, L.P. financed films for Disney with $193 million in funding. In January 1987, Silver Screen III began financing films for Disney with $300 million raised, the largest amount raised for a film financing limited partnership by E.F. Hutton. Also in 1985, TV production company Witt/Thomas/Harris Productions begin signing a deal with Disney to produce feature films and TV shows.

In 1987, the Walt Disney Studios, which until now, had sporadically acquired independently produced films, has plans to aggressively pick up properties for distribution in an effort to become &quot;more of a full-service company&quot;, and hired former Circle Films executive Chris Zarpass to the newly created position as vice president of production and acquisitions, and acquisitions had taken on new importance for the company, citing two purchases, which are &quot;Benji the Hunted&quot;, and &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot;.

That year, In June 1987, the Walt Disney Studios decided to restructure their divisions at parent company, which included the financial and administrative divisions of Walt Disney Pictures and Television, appointing four directors to the newly created vice president positions, included were John Covas, Linda Stefansen, Anne Waldeck and Lloyd Wendkos, although Covas became the new vice president of administration for Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, while Linda Stefansen was promoted from director of finance at Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; marketing division to vice president of administration at the same company, Anne Waldeck was moved into the vice president administrative position for Buena Vista Home Video, and Lloyd Wendkos was named vice president of administration at Buena Vista International.

In April 1988, Touchstone became a unit of Walt Disney Pictures with newly appointed head Ricardo Mestres. With several production companies getting out of film production or closing shop by December 1988, Walt Disney Studios announced the formation of Hollywood Pictures division, which would only share marketing and distribution with Touchstone, to fill the void. Walt Disney Television and Touchstone Television were grouped together under Garth Ancier as president of network television for the Walt Disney Studios on April 18, 1989.

Late in the 1980s, Disney purchased a controlling stake in one of Pacific Theatres&#x27; chains leading Disney&#x27;s Buena Vista Theaters and Pacific to renovate the El Capitan Theatre and the Crest by 1989. The Crest was finished first while El Capitan opened with the premiere of &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; film on June 19, 1991.

===1990s===
In September 1990, the Walt Disney Company arranged for financing up to $200 million by a unit of Nomura Securities for Interscope films made for Disney. On October 23, 1990, Disney formed Touchwood Pacific Partners I to supplant the Silver Screen Partnership series as their movie studios&#x27; primary funding source. In 1992, Walt Disney Studios agreed to fund a production company, Caravan Pictures, for exiting 20th Century Fox chairman Joe Roth. In 1993, Miramax Films was purchased for $60 million by Disney.

On March 30, 1992, Disney Studios agreed to sell KCAL-TV to Pineland, Inc. for a 45% ownership stake in Pineland, so as to have interest in TV stations in both large markets, Los Angeles and New York City, allowing for increased original programming. Instead Pineland agreed to an unsolicited bid in May from Chris-Craft Industries thus ending the planned business merger with Disney&#x27;s KCAL.

David Hoberman, president of Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone, was promoted by Katzenberg to president of motion pictures at Walt Disney Studios in , while Ricardo Mestres was forced out as president of Hollywood Pictures in exchange for a production deal.

On August 24, 1994, with Katzenberg&#x27;s resignation, Walt Disney Studios was reorganized by spinning off a new TV group. Richard Frank became head of the newly formed Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications (WDTT). Roth moved in from Caravan Pictures to helm the remaining Walt Disney Studios as chairman. Hoberman stepped down as president in to take a five-year, multi-film deal for his production company, Mandeville Films.

Roth was appointed as chairman of Walt Disney Studios in 1996. In April 1996, due to ongoing post-Disney-CC/ABC merger realignment and retirement of its president, WDTT group&#x27;s division were reassigned to other groups with most transferred to the Walt Disney Studios or CC/ABC. Units returning to the studio were Walt Disney Television, Disney Television Animation, Touchstone Television and Buena Vista Home Entertainment.

Buena Vista International - Latin America and two other companies became owners of Patagonik Film Group, an Argentina-based production company, in 1997. In late 1997, Disney bid on CDR&#x27;s Epic movie library but lost to PolyGram Filmed Entertainment.

Disney&#x27;s Buena Vista Distribution and Cinergi Pictures had a 25-picture distribution deal, with Disney taking a 5% stake in Cinergi stock. After nine films were delivered under the agreement, Cinergi sold its 12-film library (except for &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;, co-financed with 20th Century Fox) to Disney on November 22, 1997, for $20 million in exchange for Disney&#x27;s Cinergi shares, production advances of $35.4 million and other loans.

In 1998, the Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group was formed by Roth to unite the Disney, Touchstone and Hollywood film production units with leadership under David Vogel. This was in order to centralize the various production units and to make live-action film production within Disney more cost-efficient. Roth also determined that the studio&#x27;s year production slate should be cut. In August 1998, Roger Birnbaum, Caravan&#x27;s co-founder, left at Roth&#x27;s prompting to co-found Spyglass Entertainment with former Morgan Creek Productions vice chairman and COO Gary Barber, in which Disney gave Caravan&#x27;s development slate, a five-year distribution agreement and an advance to Spyglass. After Caravan&#x27;s remaining three films were released, it went inactive. By May 2000, Disney had taken an equity stake in Spyglass.

Peter Schneider was promoted to studio president in January 1999, while Thomas Schumacher was promoted to president of Walt Disney Feature Animation and Walt Disney Theatrical Productions while both became co-presidents of Disney Theatrical Group. As the first studio president, Schneider had supervisory control of all films released by the Disney labels. In July, Walt Disney Television, including Buena Vista Television Productions, were transferred from the Walt Disney Studios to ABC Television Network to merge with ABC&#x27;s prime-time division, forming the ABC Entertainment Television Group.

===2000s===
Roth left to form his own production company in January 2000, with Schneider moving to a studio chairman role. Schneider left Walt Disney Studios in June 2001 to form his own theater production company partly funded by Disney. While no successor had been named, Dick Cook, chairman of the Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group (distribution); Thomas Schumacher, president of Walt Disney Animation; and Nina Jacobson, president of the Buena Vista Motion Picture Group (production) would take on the responsibilities of Schneider while continuing in their current positions. In February 2002, Cook was named as studio chairman. In January 2002, Buena Vista International - Latin America formed a joint venture production company, Miravista, with Admira, Telefónica&#x27;s content production and distribution division, for primarily Brazilian and Mexican film productions.

In January 2003, Disney initiated a reorganization of its theatrical and animation units to improve resource usage and continued focus on new characters and franchise development. Walt Disney Feature Animation — sans Walt Disney Television Animation — and Buena Vista Theatrical Worldwide were organized under the Walt Disney Studios. In 2003, the studio set a worldwide box office record of $3 billion gross.

In September 2005, Disney and Kingdom Films formed a joint venture, Magic Films, to finance a slate of 32 films, which would not include sequels. Kingdom would provide financing with $135 million equity and a $370 million revolving credit line. With the exception of &quot;High School Musical 3&quot; as a part of a Disney Channel franchise, Kingdom sued Disney in December 2008. In December 2005, Alan Bergman was promoted to president of the Walt Disney Studios.

In January 2006, the Walt Disney Company announced to acquire computer animation leader Pixar. The deal was finalized in May 2006. Pixar executive Ed Catmull would serve as president of both Pixar and Disney feature animation studios. Pixar executive vice president John Lasseter became chief creative officer for Pixar and the feature animated studios as well as helping to develop new Disney theme park attractions.

In July 2006, Disney announced a shift in its strategy of releasing more Disney-branded (i.e. Walt Disney Pictures) films and fewer Touchstone titles. The move was expected to reduce the Group&#x27;s work force by approximately 650 positions worldwide. This was a cost-cutting move with its yearly slate would consist of 12 to 15 films.

After being transferred to various other division groups since they were acquired in 2004, The Muppets Studio was incorporated into the Walt Disney Studios&#x27; Special Events Group in 2006. In April 2007, Disney retired the Buena Vista brand. Buena Vista Motion Pictures Group and Buena Vista Pictures Distribution were renamed as Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, respectively. Hollywood Pictures was also retired as well. In July 2007, Disney CEO Bob Iger banned the depiction of smoking and tobacco products from Walt Disney Pictures-branded films, as well as limiting such depictions in Touchstone and Miramax films.

In April 2008, the Studio announced the formation of Disneynature, a nature film production label. The Studio launched its Kingdom Comics division in May, led by writer-actor Ahmet Zappa, television executive Harris Katleman and writer-editor Christian Beranek. Kingdom was designed to create new properties for possible film development and re-imagine and redevelop existing movies from the Disney library, with Disney Publishing Worldwide getting a first look for publishing.

On February 9, 2009, Walt Disney Studios entered a 7-year, 30-picture distribution deal with DreamWorks Studios, by which DreamWorks&#x27; films would be released through the Touchstone banner, with Disney collecting a 10 percent distribution fee. The deal also included a $175 million co-financing loan by Disney to DreamWorks for production and access to slots in Disney&#x27;s pay television agreement, then with Starz. In late 2009, Miramax Films, a formerly independent Disney film unit, was transferred to the Walt Disney Studios, until its sale in 2010 to Filmyard Holdings. The Kingdom Comics unit&#x27;s creatives and executives moved its deal to an independent Monsterfoot Productions.

On September 18, 2009, Cook was forced out as chairman, after allegedly having been asked to do so by Iger, for resisting change that Iger felt was needed and the previous year&#x27;s poor results. He was then replaced by Disney Channels Worldwide president Rich Ross on October 5, 2009.

===2010s===
The Walt Disney Company completed its acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in December 2009 for $4.2 billion. Disney closed a deal with Paramount Pictures to transfer worldwide marketing and the distribution rights to Marvel&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot; and &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; in October 2010.

In May 2011, Disney India and UTV Motion Pictures agreed to co-produce Disney-branded family films, with both companies handling creative function and UTV producing, marketing and distributing the films.

In August 2011, Disney fired Marvel Studios&#x27; marketing department in a restructuring. Disney would take over the marketing and distribution of future Marvel titles, beginning with the 2012 release of &quot;The Avengers&quot;.

On April 20, 2012, Ross was fired as studio chairman. Former Warner Bros. chief Alan Horn was named chairman on May 31, 2012. On October 30, 2012, Lucasfilm agreed to be purchased by the Walt Disney Company and a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy was announced. The deal was finalized on December 21. Later on the same day, Disney agreed to have Netflix as its exclusive U.S. television subscription service for first-run Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Marvel Studios and Disneynature feature films starting in 2016, replacing its agreement with Starz that ends in 2015.

In April 2013, the Walt Disney Studios laid off 150 workers, including staff from its marketing and home entertainment units. In July 2013, Disney acquired all of the distribution rights previously held by Paramount for Marvel Studios&#x27; &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, and &quot;Captain America: The First Avenger&quot;. In December of that same year, Disney purchased the distribution and marketing rights to future &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films from Paramount. Paramount will continue distributing the first four films and receive &quot;financial participation&quot; from any additional films. In March 2015, Iger expanded the studio&#x27;s smoking and tobacco prohibition to include all films released by the studio—including PG-13 rated films and below—unless such depictions are historically pertinent. The studio and Shanghai Media Group Pictures signed a multi-year movie development agreement, before the March 6, 2014, announcement, in which Chinese themes would be incorporated into Disney-branded movies.

In August 2015, Marvel Studios was integrated into Walt Disney Studios with president Kevin Feige reporting to Disney studio chief Alan Horn instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Isaac Perlmutter. Perlmutter continued to oversee Marvel Television and Marvel Animation until 2019, in which they were folded back into Marvel Studios.

In January 2016, Disney received ownership of all fourteen DreamWorks films it distributed, in compensation for outstanding loans as DreamWorks was restructured into Amblin Partners. Later that same year, Disney distributed &quot;The Light Between Oceans&quot;—the fourteenth and final film in the DreamWorks distribution deal—and also the last film released under Touchstone.

On December 19, 2016, Walt Disney Studios became the first major studio to reach $7 billion at the global box office. This surpasses Universal&#x27;s record from 2015 of $6.89 billion. Disney did it with five of the top 10 films of the year with a record four of them, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, &quot;Finding Dory&quot;, &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot;, and &quot;Rogue One: A Star Wars Story&quot;, with opening weekend takes of over $100 million. Four films in 2016 grossed over $1 billion and another $966 million globally. Two studio units&#x27; (Pixar and Marvel Studios) combined lifetime library grosses passed $10 billion.

In November 2017, the studio briefly banned reporters of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; from attending pre-release screenings for its films, after it had published reports on Disney&#x27;s political influence in the Anaheim area that the company deemed to be &quot;biased and inaccurate&quot;. After a boycott effort emerged among several notable critics and publications (including &quot;Washington Post&quot; blogger Alyssa Rosenberg, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;Boston Globe&quot; critic Ty Burr), and several major film critic societies threatened to disqualify Disney films from their year-end awards in retaliation, Disney stated that the company &quot;had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; regarding our specific concerns&quot;, and had reversed its ban.

In December 2017, Disney announced plans to purchase 21st Century Fox (21CF) for $52.4 billion. In preparation for integration of 21st Century Fox assets in March 2018, Disney created a new segment named Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer and International, merging two segments and transferring various units to the new segment, including the Janice Marinelli-led Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment. On June 28, 2018, DisneyToon Studios was shut down.

On June 8, 2018, Disney announced Lasseter would be leaving the company by the end of the year, but would take on a consulting role until then. On June 19, 2018, Pete Docter and Jennifer Lee were announced as Lasseter&#x27;s replacements as chief creative officers of Pixar and Disney Animation, respectively.

In December 2018, the studio surpassed $7 billion in global box office for the calendar year. It was the second time in history that any studio had surpassed the $7 billion mark, after Disney&#x27;s own industry-record global gross of $7.6 billion in 2016.

Following the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Disney announced that the film divisions of Fox Entertainment Group (including 20th Century Fox, Fox Searchlight Pictures, Fox 2000 Pictures, 20th Century Fox Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Fox Family) would be folded into the Walt Disney Studios. Fox&#x27;s filmed entertainment CEO Stacey Snider exited following the acquisition. Fox executives Emma Watts, Nancy Utley and Stephen Gilula joined the Walt Disney Company on March 20, 2019. On March 21, 2019, Disney announced that the Fox 2000 label would be shut down by the end of the year after releasing its films in production. 20th Century Fox Animation was also repositioned to directly report to chairman Horn. 20th Century Fox and its related studios will keep their headquarters on their studio lot in Century City, thanks to a seven-year lease from the Fox Corporation.

On May 1, 2019, president Alan Bergman was promoted to co-chairman. Horn added the new title of the studio&#x27;s chief creative officer.

Disney announced a round of layoffs for the studio, mostly from 20th Century Fox, in the production and visual effects departments. They also announced on July 31, 2019, that the Fox Research Library will be folded into the Walt Disney Archives and the Imagineering Research Library by January 2020. The studio announced a 10-year lease of most of the Pinewood Studios near London from the Pinewood Group in September 2019 to start in 2020.

In August 2019, Disney became the first studio to have five films to gross over $1 billion at the worldwide box office in a single year. Walt Disney Studios became the first major studio to reach $10 billion at the global box office in December 2019, breaking their previous record in 2016. The studio ended 2019 eventually earning $13.2 billion in worldwide box office. Disney achieved this on the strength of &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Captain Marvel&quot;, &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;, &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Frozen II&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; all earning over $1 billion.

===2020s===
On January 17, 2020, Disney announced it would drop the &quot;Fox&quot; name from the studio&#x27;s 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight Pictures branding. The two studios were renamed as 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures, respectively. Similar to other Disney film units, films produced under the 20th Century Studios began to be distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures in the same year. Searchlight Pictures continues to operate their autonomous distribution unit in North America.

In December 2020, it was announced that effective January 1, 2021, Bergman would become chairman, overseeing creative, production, marketing, and operations for it, while Horn would remain as the studios&#x27; Chief Creative Officer, focusing solely on Disney&#x27;s creative pipeline, and working in conjunction with Bergman on the studio&#x27;s creative plans.

On February 9, 2021, Disney announced that Blue Sky Studios would be closed effective April 2021, due in part to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic&#x27;s continued economic impact on the company&#x27;s businesses; it was no longer sustainable for Disney to run a third feature animation studio. The studio&#x27;s film library and intellectual properties would still be retained by Disney. Disney Music Group was reorganized back under Walt Disney Studios on February 8, 2023. On April 26, 2023, 20th Digital Studio was dissolved.

<text>Rock in Rio is a biennial Brazilian multi-day music festival held at City of Rock in Rio de Janeiro. It later branched into other locations such as Lisbon, Madrid and Las Vegas.

Ten incarnations of the festival have been held in Rio de Janeiro, in 1985, 1991, 2001, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2022 and 2024; nine in Lisbon, in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2022; three in Madrid in 2008, 2010 and 2012; and one in Las Vegas, in 2015. Brazilian entrepreneur and advertiser Roberto Medina was responsible for the inception and organization of the festival, as well as moving the 2004 edition to Lisbon, while controversially keeping the brand &quot;Rock in Rio&quot;. In 2011, Rock in Rio returned to its original location, Rio de Janeiro, with a new line-up of singers and groups.

Rock in Rio is one of the largest music festivals in the world, with 1.38 million people attending the first event, 700,000 attending the second and fourth, about 1.2 million attending the third, and about 350,000 people attending each of the three Lisbon events.

In May 2018, Live Nation Entertainment acquired a majority stake in the festival (including from previous stakeholder SFX Entertainment), with Medina continuing to manage the festival&#x27;s operations. Live Nation stated that it intended to &quot;[integrate] their industry expertise&quot; into their overall business.

In 2022, Lisbon hosted the 9th edition on several dates in June at Bela Vista Park. Rio de Janeiro hosted its edition on several dates in September.

===&quot;Rock in Rio&quot; (1985)===

The first edition of the festival was held from 11–20 January 1985. Queen, George Benson, Rod Stewart, AC/DC, and Yes were the headliners, each occupying top spot for two nights (Benson, however, ceded it to James Taylor for their second night in the same bill, due to the huge delay Taylor&#x27;s extended performance had caused to his concert two days before). About 1.38 million people attended the 10-day-long festival.

==== &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; in numbers ====
* The City of Rock, which was built for the festival, covered an area of 250,000 m2 (around 2.7 million square feet)

* Both Queen shows were filmed (early on 12 and 19 January) and broadcast throughout Brazil by Globo. Each show was watched by nearly 200 million people in over 60 countries and in front of 250,000-500,000 people for each night setting a world record for the biggest paying audience ever at the time. It was later broadcast in the United States on MTV as &quot;Queen: Live in Rio&quot;.
* Iron Maiden was the only non-Brazilian act to play just one concert at the festival (on its opening night, headlined by Queen), due to other bookings, while every other international act performed twice. During the song &quot;Revelations&quot;, lead singer Bruce Dickinson hit himself accidentally with a guitar and cut his eyebrow. Dickinson continued to sing in spite of heavy bleeding. They performed in front of a crowd of 500,000 people.
* The Go-Go&#x27;s broke up after their two Rock in Rio performances, (headlined by Queen and Rod Stewart) though they would later reunite in the 1990s. The two Rock in Rio shows were the debut and swansong for short-tenured Go-Go&#x27;s member Paula Jean Brown, who had replaced Jane Wiedlin. (Wiedlin would return to the reunited 1990s lineup.)
* Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, at the time Talking Heads drummer and bass player, respectively, took part at the B-52&#x27;s concerts. They joined the band from the third song on and played along with them for the remainder of the performance.
* The 20 January appearance of the B-52&#x27;s would turn out to be their last with guitarist Ricky Wilson, who died from AIDS in October of that year as the band was finishing their next album.
* Initially, Def Leppard was scheduled to play at the festival. However, they dropped out about two months before the event, due to delays on the recording process of the album &quot;Hysteria&quot;. Eleven days before the date Def Leppard would have played at the festival, drummer Rick Allen suffered an accident that cost him his left arm. They were replaced by Whitesnake, which happened to be the last touring date for the supporting &quot;Slide It In&quot; album tour.

===&quot;Rock in Rio 2&quot; (1991)===
The second edition was held from 18–27 January 1991 at the Maracanã stadium. Headliners were Guns N&#x27; Roses, Prince and George Michael, each being top billed for two of the event&#x27;s nine nights. INXS, New Kids on the Block and A-ha also had top billing, for one night each. The third night, headlined by Guns N&#x27; Roses, attracted more than 100.000 people to the stadium, the biggest audience of the nine-day event.
A-ha broke the record for largest paying attendance at a concert with 198,000 fans in attendance.

George Michael&#x27;s second concert, on 27 January, the festival&#x27;s closing day, featured his ex-Wham! partner Andrew Ridgeley, who joined Michael for a few songs at the encore.

===&quot;Rock in Rio 3&quot; (2001)===

The third &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; festival took place in 2001. Its seven nights were headlined, respectively, by Sting, R.E.M., Guns N&#x27; Roses, &#x27;N Sync, Iron Maiden, Neil Young and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

Once O Rappa complained about their assigned time, as the contract predicted a night concert that wound up scheduled for 6:30 PM while the lesser known in the country Deftones remained in the evening, they were expelled, and five other Brazilian bands, Jota Quest, Raimundos, Charlie Brown Jr., Skank and Cidade Negra, withdrew from the festival in protest.

Iron Maiden released their set as &quot;Rock in Rio&quot;. Profits from the sale of the album were donated to the Clive Burr fund, helping their former drummer pay mounting medical bills for his multiple sclerosis.

A notable appearance at &quot;Rock in Rio 3&quot; was that of American hard rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses, their first large show since 1993, with a new line-up featuring vocalist Axl Rose, guitarists Buckethead, Robin Finck &amp; Paul Tobias, bassist Tommy Stinson, drummer Brain and keyboardists Dizzy Reed &amp; Chris Pitman.

Carlinhos Brown, the opening act on the day Guns N&#x27; Roses performed, was attacked by water bottles throughout his performance. Bassist Nick Oliveri of Queens of the Stone Age performed nude for part of their set and was arrested for indecent exposure after the concert, being released soon after.

The fourth edition of Rock in Rio, back to its origins, was held on 23, 24, 25, 29 and 30 September, and 1 and 2 October 2011, at an area (pt) to be built next to the old City of Rock – which was the site of the Olympic Village for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Three different stages were employed, with the headlining concerts at the Palco Mundo (World Stage), the secondary ones in Palco Sunset (Sunset Stage), and DJs playing at a specialized stage for electronic music. The closing acts, Guns N&#x27; Roses and System of a Down, entered following a poll on the festival&#x27;s website. Maroon 5 was a last hour addition, following Jay-Z leaving for personal reasons.

===&quot;Rock in Rio Lisboa&quot; (2004)===
After the huge success of Rock in Rio 3 in Brazil, Roberta Medina decided to organize a festival of the same stature in Lisbon. The decision to maintain the name Rock in Rio was controversial, and detractors of the idea in Brazil started calling it &quot;Rock in Rio Tejo&quot;, after the Tagus river (rio Tejo, in Portuguese) which runs through the Portuguese capital.

The first edition of Rock in Rio Lisboa, as the festival was officially called, took place in 2004. Although the festival had a slight change of name, it kept the same structure as the Brazilian editions. An entire &quot;City of Rock&quot;, with an area of over 260,000 audience was erected at the Bela Vista park, with a large centre stage and several tents where different artists would perform, simultaneously.

<text>The idea of convergence in economics (also sometimes known as the catch-up effect) is the hypothesis that poorer economies&#x27; per capita incomes will tend to grow at faster rates than richer economies. In the Solow-Swan model, economic growth is driven by the accumulation of physical capital until this optimum level of capital per worker, which is the &quot;steady state&quot; is reached, where output, consumption and capital are constant. The model predicts more rapid growth when the level of physical capital per capita is low, something often referred to as “catch up” growth. As a result, all economies should eventually converge in terms of per capita income. Developing countries have the potential to grow at a faster rate than developed countries because diminishing returns (in particular, to capital) are not as strong as in capital-rich countries. Furthermore, poorer countries can replicate the production methods, technologies, and institutions of developed countries.

In economic growth literature the term &quot;convergence&quot; can have two meanings. The first kind (sometimes called &quot;sigma-convergence&quot;) refers to a reduction in the dispersion of levels of income across economies. &quot;Beta-convergence&quot; on the other hand, occurs when poor economies grow faster than rich ones. Economists say that there is &quot;conditional beta-convergence&quot; when economies experience &quot;beta-convergence&quot; but conditional on other variables (namely the investment rate and the population growth rate) being held constant. They say that &quot;unconditional beta-convergence&quot; or &quot;absolute beta-convergence&quot; exists when the growth rate of an economy declines as it approaches its steady state. According to Jack Goldstone, &quot;in the twentieth century, the Great Divergence peaked before the First World War and continued until the early 1970s, then, after two decades of indeterminate fluctuations, in the late 1980s it was replaced by the Great Convergence as the majority of Third World countries reached economic growth rates significantly higher than those in most First World countries&quot;, thus the present-day convergence should be regarded as a continuation of the Great Divergence.

==Limitations==

The fact that a country is poor does not guarantee that catch-up growth will be achieved. Moses Abramovitz emphasised the need for &#x27;Social Capabilities&#x27; to benefit from catch-up growth. These capabilities include an ability to absorb new technology, attract capital and participate in global markets. According to Abramovitz, these prerequisites must be in place in an economy before catch-up growth can occur, and explain why there is still divergence in the world today.

The theory also assumes that technology is freely traded and available to developing countries that are attempting to catch-up. Capital that is expensive or unavailable to these economies can also prevent catch-up growth from occurring, especially given that capital is scarce in these countries. This often traps countries in a low-efficiency cycle whereby the most efficient technology is too expensive to be acquired. The differences in productivity techniques are what separates the leading developed nations from the following developed nations, but by a margin narrow enough to give the following nations an opportunity to catch-up. This process of catch-up continues as long as the following nations have something to learn from the leading nations, and will only cease when the knowledge discrepancy between the leading and following nations becomes very small and eventually exhausted.

According to Professor Jeffrey Sachs, convergence is not occurring everywhere due to the closed economic policy of some developing countries, which could be solved through free trade and openness. In a study of 111 countries between 1970 and 1989, Sachs and Andrew Warner concluded that the industrialized countries had a growth of 2.3% per year per capita, open economy developing countries 4.5% and closed economy developing countries had only 2%.

Robert Lucas stated the &quot;Lucas paradox&quot; which is the observation that capital is not flowing from developed countries to developing countries despite the fact that developing countries have lower levels of capital per worker. However, this statement has recently received serious objections.

==Examples==
There are many examples of countries that have converged with developed countries which validate the catch-up theory. Based on case studies on Japan, Mexico and other countries, Nakaoka studied social capabilities for industrialization and clarified the features of human and social attitudes in the catching-up process of Japan in the Meiji period (1868-1912). In the 1960s and 1970s the East Asian Tigers rapidly converged with developed economies. These include Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan – all of which are today considered developed economies. In the post-war period (1945–1960) examples include West Germany, France and Japan, which were able to quickly regain their prewar status by replacing capital that was lost during World War II.

Some economists criticise the theory, stating that endogenous factors, such as government policy, are much more influential in economic growth than exogenous factors. For example, Alexander Gerschenkron states that governments can substitute for missing prerequisites to trigger catch-up growth. A hypothesis by economic historians Kenneth Sokoloff and Stanley Engerman suggested that factor endowments are a central determinant of structural inequality that impedes institutional development in some countries. Sokoloff and Engerman proposed that in the 19th century, countries such as Brazil and Cuba with rich factor endowments such as soil and climate are predisposed to a guarded franchise with limited institutional growth. Land that is suitable for sugar and coffee such as Cuba experienced economies of scale from the establishment of plantation that in turn created the small elite families with vested interest in guarded franchise. The exogenous suitability of land for wheat versus sugar determines the growth rate for many countries. Therefore, countries with land that is suitable for sugar converge with other countries that also have land that is suitable for growing sugar.

Sokoloff and Engerman explained this convergence in their article &quot;History Lessons: Institutions, Factor Endowments, and Paths of Development in the New World.&quot; They explained that the United States and Canada started out as two of the poorest colonies in the New World but grew faster than other countries due to their soil qualities. They argued that the United States and Canada had land suitable for growing wheat which meant that they had small scale farming, since wheat does not benefit from economies of scale, and this led to a relatively equal distribution of wealth and political power enabling the population to vote for broad public education. This differentiated them from countries such as Cuba that had land suitable for growing sugar and coffee. Such countries did benefit from economies of scale and so had large plantation agriculture with slave labor, large income and class inequalities, and limited voting rights. This difference in political power led to little spending on the establishment of institutions such as public schools and slowed down their progress. As a result, countries with relative equality and access to public education grew faster and were able to converge on countries with inequality and limited education.

==Types of convergence==
As classified by Oded Galor:

*Absolute convergence: Lower initial GDP will lead to a higher average growth rate. 

The implication of this is that poverty will ultimately disappear &#x27;by itself&#x27;. It does not explain why some nations have had zero growth for many decades (e.g. in Sub-Saharan Africa)

* Conditional convergence: A country&#x27;s income per worker converges to a country-specific long-run level as determined by the structural characteristics of that country. 

The implication is that structural characteristics, and not initial national income, determine the long-run level of GDP per worker. Thus, foreign aid should focus on structure (infrastructure, education, financial system etc.) and there is no need for an income transfer from richer to poorer nations.

* Club convergence: It is possible to observe different &quot;clubs&quot; or groups of countries with similar growth trajectories. Most importantly, several countries with low national income also have low growth rates. 

Thus, this is in contrast to the theory of conditional convergence, and would suggest that foreign aid should also include income transfers and that initial income does in fact matter for economic growth.

<text>Frederick Ross Johnson, OC (December 13, 1931 – December 29, 2016) was a Canadian businessman, best known as the chief executive officer of RJR Nabisco in the 1980s.

==Early life and education==
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on December 13, 1931, into a lower-middle-class family, Johnson used a military cadet scholarship program to attend the University of Manitoba, where he graduated in 1952 with a Bachelor of Commerce degree and was President of the fraternity Phi Delta Theta. He went on to earn an MBA from the University of Toronto in 1956.

==Career==
Johnson first worked as an accountant for General Electric in Montreal and as a vice-president of merchandising for the T. Eaton Company before being named president of Standard Brands Ltd.

Johnson negotiated a merger between Standard Brands and Nabisco with Nabisco CEO Bob Schaeberle in 1981. Soon after, Schaeberle left Nabisco, and Johnson took the helm, replacing many Nabisco executives with ones from Standard Brands. Growing restless, he initiated talks that led to the Nabisco-RJ Reynolds merger in 1985. He was soon appointed president and CEO of RJR Nabisco. Johnson appeared on the December 5, 1988, cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine under the headline &quot;A Game of Greed&quot;. After dismal stock performance following the 1987 stock market crash, Johnson decided to put the company in play. Originally, he planned to execute a management-led leveraged buyout with Shearson Lehman Hutton. Events quickly escalated into a takeover contest.

He was extensively profiled in the book &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot; by &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; columnists Bryan Burrough and John Helyar, and in the movie of the same name made for HBO. In the film, Johnson was portrayed by James Garner.

Following the RJR Nabisco takeover by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. led by Henry Kravis, Johnson started his own private investment company, RJM Group, Inc., based in Atlanta, Georgia. Until he resigned in March 2009, he was chairman of AuthentiDate Holding Corp., a United States publicly traded company. He served on the board of directors of several companies including Bentley Pharmaceuticals. Johnson also served on the advisory board of Power Corporation of Canada.

==Personal life==
Johnson maintained homes in La Jolla, California and Jupiter, Florida.

He was made a trustee of Duke University and served on the advisory councils of several universities. The Distinguished Visitors Program at the University of Toronto Centre for the Study of the United States was endowed by Johnson in 2001.

==Death==
Johnson died on December 29, 2016, at his home in Jupiter, Florida, seventeen days after his 85th birthday from pneumonia.

<text>Sir Christopher James Hampton (born 26 January 1946) is a British playwright, screenwriter, translator and film director. He is best known for his play &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot; based on the novel of the same name and the film adaptation. He has thrice received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay: for &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988), &quot;Atonement&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Father&quot; (2020); winning for the former and latter.

Hampton is also known for his work in the theatre including &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot;, and &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;. He also translated the plays &quot;The Seagull&quot; (2008), &quot;God of Carnage&quot; (2009), &quot;The Father&quot; (2016), and &quot;The Height of the Storm&quot; (2019). He also wrote, with Don Black, the book and lyrics for the musical &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1994), for which they received Tony Awards for Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score.

==Early life and theatrical debut==
Hampton was born in Faial, Azores, to British parents Dorothy Patience (née Herrington) and Bernard Patrick Hampton, a marine telecommunications engineer for Cable &amp; Wireless. His father&#x27;s job led the family to settle in Aden, Yemen, and Cairo and Alexandria in Egypt, and later in Hong Kong and Zanzibar. During the Suez Crisis in 1956, the family had to flee Egypt under cover of darkness, leaving their possessions behind.

After a prep school at Reigate in Surrey, Hampton attended the independent boarding school Lancing College near the village of Lancing in West Sussex at the age of 13. There he won house colours for boxing and distinguished himself as a sergeant in the Combined Cadet Force (CCF). Among his contemporaries at Lancing was David Hare, later also a dramatist; poet Harry Guest was a teacher.

From 1964, Hampton read German and French at New College, Oxford, as a Sacher Scholar. He graduated with a starred First Class Degree in 1968.

Hampton became involved in the theatre while at Oxford University. The Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS) performed his original play &quot;When Did You Last See My Mother?&quot;, about adolescent homosexuality. He drew from his own experiences at Lancing. Hampton sent the work to the play agent Peggy Ramsay, who interested William Gaskill in it. The play was performed at the Royal Court Theatre in London, and soon transferred to the Comedy Theatre; in 1966, Hampton was the youngest writer in the modern era to have a play performed in the West End. Hampton&#x27;s work on screenplays for the cinema also began around this time. He adapted this play for Richard Attenborough and Bryan Forbes, but a film version was never made.

==Stage plays and other works==
From 1968 to 1970, Hampton worked as the Resident Dramatist at the Royal Court Theatre, and also as the company&#x27;s literary manager. He continued to write plays: &quot;Total Eclipse&quot;, about the French poets and lovers Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine, was first performed in 1967 and at the Royal Court in 1968, but it was not well received at the time. &quot;The Philanthropist&quot; (1970) is set in an English university town and was influenced by Molière&#x27;s &quot;The Misanthrope&quot;. The Royal Court delayed a staging for two years because of an uncertainty over its prospects, but their production was one of the Royal Court&#x27;s more successful works up to that point. The production transferred to the Mayfair Theatre in London&#x27;s West End and ran for nearly four years, winning the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Award for Best Comedy. It reached Broadway in New York City in 1971.

His agent told him after this success: &quot;You&#x27;ve got a choice: you can write the same play over and over for the next 30 years&quot; or, alternatively, &quot;you can decide to do something completely different every time&quot;. He told her that he was writing a play about the &quot;extermination of the Brazilian Indians in the 1960s&quot;. &quot;Savages&quot;, set during the period of the military government and derived from an article &quot;Genocide in Brazil&quot; by Norman Lewis, was first performed in 1973. His first produced film adaptation, of Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; (1973), was directed by Patrick Garland, and stars Anthony Hopkins and Claire Bloom.

A sojourn in Hollywood led to an unproduced film adaptation of Marlowe&#x27;s play &quot;Edward II&quot; and the original script for &quot;Carrington&quot;. This period also inspired his play &quot;Tales from Hollywood&quot; (1982). This is a somewhat fictionalised account of exiled European writers living in the United States during the Second World War. (The lead character is based on Ödön von Horváth, who died in Paris in 1938). The play also explores the different philosophies of Horwath and the German playwright Bertolt Brecht (who lived in the United States in the 1940s). Hampton told &quot;The Guardian&quot; critic Michael Billington in 2007: &quot;I lean towards the liberal writer, Horvath, rather than the revolutionary Brecht. I suppose I&#x27;m working out some internal conflict&quot;. The play was commissioned by the Center Theatre Group in Los Angeles; the Group first performed it in 1982. The play has been adapted in different versions for British and Polish television.

==Later works==
Hampton won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his screen adaptation of his play &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot; (1988), directed by Stephen Frears and starring Glenn Close, John Malkovich, and Michelle Pfeiffer. He worked on &quot;Carrington&quot; (1995) for 18 years, writing multiple drafts. The play explores the relationship between painter Dora Carrington and author Lytton Strachey. Hampton went on to direct the feature film &quot;Carrington&quot;, starring Emma Thompson and Jonathan Pryce.

He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1999 Birthday Honours for services to literature.

Hampton both wrote and directed &quot;Imagining Argentina&quot; (2003), his adaptation of the 1987 novel by Lawrence Thornton. It explores society during the military dictatorship of Leopoldo Galtieri, when the government conducted a Dirty War against opponents, killing many in &quot;forced disappearances&quot;. It starred Antonio Banderas and Emma Thompson. According to Hampton, this period of Argentinian history had not inspired a dramatic work before. &quot;I decided to do something which it would be difficult to finance at a time when, for once, I was bombarded with offers. In 2007, Hampton was nominated for a second Academy Award for his screenplay and adaptation of Ian McEwan&#x27;s novel &quot;Atonement&quot;, directed by Joe Wright and starring James McAvoy, Keira Knightley, and Saoirse Ronan.

Since the 1990s, Hampton has created the English translations of the works of French dramatists Yasmina Reza and Florian Zeller. Reza&#x27;s &quot;Art&quot; ran for eight years in the West End, and was also produced in the United States. Hampton translated Reza&#x27;s &quot;God of Carnage&quot;, which was the third-longest running Broadway play in the 2000s, playing 24 premieres and 452 regular performances. &quot;God of Carnage&quot; garnered six Tony nominations and three wins in 2009. &quot;God of Carnage&quot; actors James Gandolfini and Marcia Gay Harden, joined Philip Glass, Phillip Noyce and a host of other artists in a short documentary celebrating their Tony Award success and Mr. Hampton&#x27;s 50 published plays and screenplays.

Hampton&#x27;s translation into English of Michael Kunze and Sylvester Levay&#x27;s Austrian musical &quot;Rebecca&quot;, based on Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s novel of the same name, was supposed to premiere on Broadway in 2012, directed by Francesca Zambello and Michael Blakemore. The production did not open, with the producers, Ben Sprecher and Louise Forlenza, relinquishing the rights.

In 2012, Hampton joined forces with Tiana Alexandra-Silliphant to form Hampton Silliphant Management &amp; Productions, which presented the play &quot;Appomattox&quot; at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The play concerns itself with historic events in the United States, 100 years apart in time: the historic meetings between Generals Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, as well as Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass in 1865, and the later machinations of Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover and Martin Luther King – which ultimately led to the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. &quot;Appomattox&quot; was also performed as an opera with Philip Glass at The Kennedy Center in 2015.

In 2020, Hampton served as screenwriter and executive producer for &quot;The Singapore Grip&quot;, an international TV mini-series exploring the Japanese invasion of Singapore during WWII. Adapted from the novel by J.G. Ferrell, the story portrays the intrigues and ultimate upheaval of British colonialism at the time of the Fall of Singapore. 

The same year, Hampton co-wrote &quot;The Father&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, with Florian Zeller (based on Zeller&#x27;s 2012 play &quot;Le Père&quot;), who directed the film in his feature directorial debut. The film received critical acclaim, and both Hampton and Zeller won a BAFTA and an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and received a Golden Globe nomination, while the film was nominated in the Best Picture categories.

Hampton was knighted in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to drama.

In March and April 2021, it was announced that Hampton and Zeller will co-write the adaptation of &quot;The Son&quot; (which serves as Zeller&#x27;s and Hampton&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;The Father&quot;) with Zeller directing, and Hugh Jackman and Laura Dern attached to star in the film.

&quot;The Son&quot; was directed by Florian Zeller from a screenplay by Zeller and Hampton. It is based on Zeller&#x27;s 2018 stage play &quot;Le Fils&quot;. The film stars Hugh Jackman, Laura Dern, Vanessa Kirby, Zen McGrath, Hugh Quarshie, and Anthony Hopkins.

&quot;The Son&quot; had its world premiere at the 79th Venice International Film Festival on 7 September 2022, and is scheduled to be released in the United States on 11 November 2022, by Sony Pictures Classics.

<doc id="1302510" wikidata="Q580477" url="?curid=1302510" title="The Cabinet (professional wrestling)">
<text>The Cabinet was a professional wrestling stable in WWE on the SmackDown! brand from 2004 to 2006. Led by John “Bradshaw” Layfield, the group portrayed a presidential-style cabinet, with members holding titles mirroring those of U.S. government officials. The stable was formed shortly after JBL won the WWE Championship at The Great American Bash in 2004 with the aim of protecting JBL&#x27;s interests as the WWE Champion.

== History ==

=== Formation and dominance (2004–2005) ===

In mid-2004, following his victory for the WWE Championship, John “Bradshaw” Layfield introduced The Cabinet as his entourage to solidify his status as champion. The initial members included Orlando Jordan as his “Chief of Staff” and Amy Weber as his “Image Consultant.”The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham) would later join as the “Co-Secretaries of Defense&quot;.

Throughout late 2004 and early 2005, The Cabinet assisted JBL in retaining the WWE Championship against various challengers, including Eddie Guerrero, The Undertaker, Booker T, Kurt Angle and Big Show. Their frequent interference (along with that of Jon Heidenreich and Kurt Angle&#x27;s proteges Mark Jindrak and Luther Reigns) contributed to JBL&#x27;s nine-month title reign, which was the longest of the decade until it was later surpassed by John Cena, who ended JBL&#x27;s reign.

In addition to the WWE Championship, the Cabinet also secured the WWE US Championship (Orlando Jordan) and WWE Tag Team Championship (The Basham Brothers) belts during this time (the Bashams later lost their championships to the team of Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio while Orlando Jordan retained his championship until Summerslam 2005 when he submitted to Chris Benoit in a record 25.5 seconds).

=== Membership changes and decline (2005–2006) ===

In early 2005, Amy Weber departed from WWE, with her exit explained on-screen by JBL firing her after a series of mishaps. The Basham Brothers grew dissatisfied with their lack of recognition and left The Cabinet on the June 16 episode of ‘‘SmackDown!’’ They were later split during the 2005 WWE draft lottery.

After losing the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 21, JBL attempted to revitalize his career by hiring Jillian Hall as his “Fixer” and publicist in September 2005. Despite this addition, The Cabinet&#x27;s presence dwindled. Orlando Jordan quietly separated from JBL after losing the United States Championship and was released from WWE in May 2006. JBL transitioned to a commentator role before temporarily retiring from in-ring competition, effectively disbanding The Cabinet.

== Members ==

The Cabinet was structured to resemble a political cabinet, with each member holding a specific title:
* President/Leader: John “Bradshaw” Layfield
* Chief of Staff: Orlando Jordan
* Image Consultant: Amy Weber (departed in February 2005)
* Co-Secretaries of Defense: The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham; left the group in June 2005)
* Publicist/Fixer: Jillian Hall (joined in September 2005)

The group&#x27;s signature gesture was the “Longhorn” pose, where members raised their arms horizontally at a 45° angle with hands flat, a symbolic representation of JBL&#x27;s Texas longhorn logo.

<text>Disney Music Group (DMG) is the music recording and publishing arm of Walt Disney Studios, a division of Disney Entertainment, which is owned by The Walt Disney Company. It is located at the studio&#x27;s headquarters in Burbank, California. The division&#x27;s subsidiaries consist of two owned record labels—Walt Disney Records and Hollywood Records—along with Disney Music Publishing, the publishing entity that administers the company&#x27;s music, as well as Disney Concerts. Disney Music&#x27;s Vevo account on YouTube is currently one of the most-viewed YouTube channels as of June 2023.

== Background ==
From the founding of The Walt Disney Company in 1923, music has been key to the success of the organization. Both public-domain and original music were used for the initial cartoons, but, since neither Walt Disney nor Roy O. Disney had any music industry experience, the studio had to rely on outside music publishers. In 1928, Walt Disney released the first Mickey Mouse motion picture, &quot;Steamboat Willie,&quot; which became the first animated short-subject film with sound. Two other unreleased Mickey Mouse shorts had been previously produced and were subsequently given soundtracks prior to their eventual premieres. In 1929, Walt Disney and Carl Stalling wrote &quot;Minnie&#x27;s Yoo-Hoo&quot;, the first song from the Walt Disney Studios, for &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Follies&quot;. On December 16, 1929, the Disney Film Recording Company, Limited was incorporated as a subsidiary of Walt Disney Productions.

Saul Bourne at Irving Berlin Music approached the studio after seeing &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; with interest in the publishing rights for its theme song, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&quot;. With Disney partnering with Bourne and Berlin, this partnership led to the song being recorded twice by the Don Bestor Orchestra (released by Victor Records) and Bill Scotti Orchestra (released by Bluebird Records). The song was a hit and a Depression era anthem.

Walt Disney Productions then began licensing out its music with the record company either selecting its own or Disney&#x27;s talent to record the music. Until 1936, no one had issued an actual song track recording on disc. RCA&#x27;s Victor label released a selection of Disney short film music in England with the US release a year later. The &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; soundtrack album released by Victor was the first feature film soundtrack. Disney had sold its rights to the &quot;Snow White&quot; music to Bourne Co. Music as they needed more funds to complete the film.

In 1938, Fantasound—the first Surround sound system—was designed and tested by Walt Disney Productions for the release of &quot;Fantasia.&quot; In 1943, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Walt Disney Productions for two Academy Award categories in recognition of &quot;Bambi&quot;; Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture and Music, Best Song for its song, &quot;Love is a Song&quot;.

In addition to &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, Disney also sold the music publishing rights to &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Dumbo&quot; to Bourne. To date, all attempts to reacquire the music rights to the three films had failed. After &quot;Bambi&quot;, the effects of World War II reduced the production of new feature length animation, with Disney either making feature length live films with some animation or themed short film into anthology films like &quot;Make Mine Music&quot;. The latter films contain the bulk of the more commercial music which was done by recording stars thus released by their record company.

In April 1947, the Walt Disney Music Company (WDMC) was incorporated, with Fred Raphael putting the company together in late 1949 to publish and license songs from &quot;Cinderella&quot;. &quot;Cinderella&quot; records appeared in stores along with other merchandise in 1949 before the 1950 release of the movie. The original RCA 78 RPM multi-disc-album release was number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine pop charts and as a result, Disney Music was moving rapidly into the Big Business category. While WDMC did not produce the records, Raphael did handle the selection, performance and recording.

James Alexander &quot;Jimmy&quot; Johnson, Jr., a fired Disney publicity staff member who wanted to stay at Disney, moved through a series of jobs there in the traffic department, and then accounting. After a stint in the military, he became assistant to the corporate secretary, then handled merchandising issues among other additional duties. With Roy Disney&#x27;s split of the merchandising division from Walt Disney Productions, Johnson became head of the merchandising division&#x27;s publication department in 1950 and took on managing business affairs for the Walt Disney Music Company.

Raphael took the WDMC into creating original non-film music. WDMC had several successful songs outside of the films, including &quot;Mule Train&quot; by Frankie Laine, &quot;Would I Love You (Love You, Love You)&quot; by Patti Page and &quot;Shrimp Boats&quot; by Jo Stafford, however for every non-film hit there were a score more that flopped. While &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; was a first run failure, its songs became evergreen for the music company with multiple stars performing the music. Raphael moved his office off lot to Hollywood and opened a WDMC in New York.

Walt Disney Productions formed the Wonderland Music Company in 1951.

Disney&#x27;s next push into music came from &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; as eight 6-inch 78 RPM records for the show hit shelves the week it premiered on television. Normal 7-inch 45 RPM versions were cut and released later, both through manufacturing partners of the Walt Disney Music Company. After a year, Golden Records and Am-Par Records turned over production of the show&#x27;s music back to Disney, leading to the creation of the Disneyland Records label in 1956.

== History ==
The Walt Disney Company traces the Disney Music Group back to the founding of Disneyland Records on February 4, 1956. In that year, the Walt Disney Music Company&#x27;s Disneyland Records record company was founded on the strength of Fess Parker&#x27;s 1954 hit recording of the &quot;Ballad of Davy Crockett&quot; using the Disneyland label, which was licensed to Columbia Records. The Disneyland label issued its first album, &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden of Verses&quot;. Also, Disneyland Records issued Parker&#x27;s &quot;Wringle Wrangle&quot; single from the &quot;Westward Ho the Wagons!&quot; film within a year of starting operations; the single became a hit.

In 1959, Walt Disney Productions founded Buena Vista Records as a Disney-endorsed sub-brand without the &quot;Disney&quot; name; the inaugural release from the label was &quot;Annette&quot;, the self-titled album featuring vocalist Annette Funicello.

In November 1989, The Walt Disney Company founded Hollywood Records after acquiring the valuable Queen catalog.

The Lyric Street Records label was founded in July 1997 as a division of Hollywood Records. In August 1997 Mammoth Records was purchased for $25 million to act as an independent music label within Disney.

=== Buena Vista Music Group ===
The industry recognized founding of the group was in March 1998 with the reorganization in Disney that brought all Disney music labels into one unit, Buena Vista Music Group, in the Walt Disney Studios. The group consisted of Hollywood Records, Buena Vista Records, Lyric Street Records and Mammoth Records with Walt Disney Records and Disney Music Publishing transferred out of Disney Consumer Products.

In September 2005, BVMG signed with EMI for distribution of its albums in the UK, Europe, South Africa and the Middle East replacing Warner Music Group. In November 2006, Disney Music Publishing and Warner/Chappell Music Inc. agreed to a licensing agreement for Europe and South America major markets. In 2006, BVMG launched a concert production arm, Buena Vista Concerts starting with The Cheetah Girls: The Party&#x27;s Just Begun Tour and High School Musical: The Concert.

=== Disney Music Group ===
In April 2007, Disney decided to semi-retire the Buena Vista brand from the group&#x27;s name. In November 2008, Disney Music Group formed the Disney Pearl label in conjunction with a multi-part deal with Yanni.

Lyric Street launched a subsidiary label, Carolwood Records, in October 2008 which was soon shuttered in November 2009. On April 14, 2010, Disney Music Group announced the closure of the Lyric Street label with some bands transferred to other branches of Disney Music Group and others dropped altogether.

On January 31, 2012, DMG chair Bob Cavallo retired with Ken Bunt succeeding him as head of DMG with a promotion to executive vice president from his post as senior vice president of marketing. Bunt became president on March 27, 2013. A unified licensing department was formed with in Disney Music Group by December 2012 under vice president of licensing Dominic Griffin.

Lucy Hale signed with Hollywood Records&#x27; Lyric Street sublabel in June 2012 indicated a return to country music changed to DMG Nashville with her single release &quot;You Sound Good To Me&quot; in the 2nd quarter of 2014.

In February 2016, Disney Music Group, in collaboration with Philips Lighting, launched LightVibes. In January 2017, DMG acquired the distribution rights to the entire &quot;Star Wars&quot; music catalog from Sony Classical; the soundtrack albums were then released by Walt Disney Records in digital formats the same day. Disney digitally remastered and reissued the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; soundtrack albums in physical formats on May 4, 2018.

In early April 2017, DMG and Universal Music Group Nashville relaunched Buena Vista Records as a joint venture label for country music and worldwide country music genre projects with the label&#x27;s first signed act of CB30 duo of brothers, Christian and Brody. The company and DigiTour Media formed in June 2017, RMI Recordings, a new label for &quot;digital-first&quot; talent.

During American Idol&#x27;s Disney Night on April 29, 2018, DCappella, Disney Music Group&#x27;s new a cappella singing group, made their debut. On Friday, August 23, 2019, Disney Music Group debuted their first podcast, &quot;For Scores&quot;, a composer interview series, and kicked off at D23.

== Divisions and labels ==
=== Walt Disney Records ===

Walt Disney Records, the flagship record label of the group, was founded on February 4, 1956 as Disneyland Records, so that Disney would not have to release through third-party labels not associated with the studio, such as RCA Victor or Capitol Records, which had issued Disney albums in the past. Under the Disneyland label, among its other recordings, the studio also released new soundtrack LP&#x27;s of some of the animated Disney films, including, a 3-LP album set in monophonic sound of all of the classical music heard in &quot;Fantasia&quot;, perhaps the first soundtrack album containing virtually all the music from a feature-length film. (The &quot;Meet the Soundtrack&quot; intermission segment and the jam session were not included, and Deems Taylor&#x27;s commentary was also omitted.) Disneyland Records released cover versions (rather than soundtracks) of the songs from some of the other animated films, such as &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;. In 1989, the label was renamed to its current branding and now releases a broad range of Disney-branded music, such as soundtracks to films from Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, and Lucasfilm, original studio albums from Disney Channel artists, and compilations albums by Radio Disney.

=== Hollywood Records ===

Hollywood Records, primarily focuses on pop, rock, alternative and country genres, as well as film soundtracks from Marvel Studios, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, and Hulu, as well as 20th Television&#x27;s television series and Disney&#x27;s cable networks. Originally, the label was primarily a soundtrack label for non-Disney branded releases from Touchstone Pictures and Hollywood Pictures, with few major artists, like Queen. The label now releases music from a roster of major artists such as: Breaking Benjamin, Sofia Carson, Olivia Holt and Shawn Hook.

==== DMG Nashville ====
DMG Nashville, is the label used by Hollywood Records to specialize in country music. Patrick Joseph Music and DMG Nashville signed a co-pub agreement with songwriter Melissa Peirce in 2012 with an extension in May 2015. In June 2012, Lucy Hale was signed to Hollywood Record formerly defunct country sublabel, Lyric Street, for a single and album due in 2013. In June 2013, Patrick Clifford was named Vice President of Music Publishing and A&amp;R for Disney Music Publishing in Nashville with responsibility for the A&amp;R functions for Disney Music Group in Nashville. In November 2013, DMG and Bigger Picture Group signed an agreement for DMG to handle music licensing for Bigger Picture. After Bigger Picture&#x27;s closure in 2014, DMG Nashville released its first studio album, Lucy Hale&#x27;s &quot;Road Between&quot;, on June 3.

=== Disney Music Publishing ===
Disney Music Publishing, controls the publishing rights to music from Disney&#x27;s film, television, theater and theme park divisions. Imprints include Walt Disney Music Company, Wonderland Music Company, Agarita Music, Bantha Music, Buena Vista Music Co., Falferious Music, Five Hundred South Songs, Fuzzy Muppet Songs, Holpic Music, Inc., Hollywood Pictures Music, Mad Muppet Melodies, Marvel Comics Music, Marvel Superheroes Music, Pixar Music, Pixar Talking Pictures, Seven Peaks Music, Seven Summits Music, Touchstone Pictures Music &amp; Songs, Inc., Utapau Music, and Wampa-Tauntaun Music.

=== Disney Concerts ===
Disney Concerts, formerly Buena Vista Concerts, is themselves involved in the holding, production, distribution and sponsoring of concert events related to Disney. In November 2024, they announced the Worlds Collide Tour, an interactive live concert celebrating music from the &quot;Zombies&quot; and &quot;Descendants&quot; franchises. The North American tour begins on July 17, 2025. It will feature performances from Kylie Cantrall, Joshua Colley, Malia Baker and Dara Reneé from &quot;&quot;, and Freya Skye, Malachi Barton and Mekonnen Knife from &quot;Zombies 4: Dawn of the Vampires&quot;.

=== Buena Vista Records ===
Buena Vista Records, a label founded in 1959 largely devoted to authentic soundtrack albums of mostly live-action Disney film musicals, such as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Summer Magic&quot;, and &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, as well as recordings by actors then under contract to Disney, such as Annette Funicello and Hayley Mills. Often, at the same time that Buena Vista Records released a genuine soundtrack album of one of the Disney movies, Disneyland Records, another, less expensive Disney label, would release a cover version of the songs from that film. Buena Vista Records also operates as an imprint of Walt Disney Records and most recently has been employed to serve as a pseudonym for certain releases by Walt Disney Records such as the more adult-oriented &quot;Almost Alice&quot; and non Disney-branded releases, as well as releasing traditional albums for Walt Disney Records adult artists such as Billy Ray Cyrus and Nathan Pacheco.

Buena Vista Records was relaunched as a country music label in April 2017, as a joint venture between DMG and Universal Music Group Nashville. The label&#x27;s first signed act was the brotherly music duo, CB30, whose track &quot;Marina&quot; has a Luke Bryan appearance.

=== RMI Recordings ===
RMI Recordings, a new label formed in June 2017 to sign &quot;digital-first&quot; talent. It was formed with the founders of DigiTour Media, which produces live events with social media artists. The first talent signed to the label was Max &amp; Harvey, a pair of UK twins, in April 2018.

=== S-Curve Records ===
In June 2021, Steve Greenberg announced he would be relaunching his record label S-Curve Records under a new partnership with Disney Music Group. Artists with releases as a part of the partnership include Andy Grammer and Netta.

=== Former labels ===
Disney Pearl, also as Disney Pearl Series, was an imprint of Disney Music Group for adult contemporary and pop music launched in November 2008 with a deal with Yanni for &quot;Yanni Voices&quot; albums including a Buena Vista Concert extensive tour, two Yanni PBS specials and deals for the album&#x27;s four vocal talent, Nathan Pacheco, Chloe, Ender Thomas and Leslie Mills. The label released albums, including from Kenny Loggins and Brian Wilson, until 2012.

Lyric Street Records, was an American record label specializing in country music. President Randy Goodman, formerly a general manager for RCA Records, founded the label in 1997. Among its first artists were Lari White, John Berry, Aaron Tippin, SHeDAISY and extremely popular Rascal Flatts. Carolwood Records was a short-lived subsidiary label of Lyric Street launched in October 2008. In April 2010, the label was folded into Hollywood Records.

Mammoth Records, the formerly independent record label was founded by Jay Faires in 1989. In 1993 it became part of a joint venture with WEA-owned Atlantic Records but hit the market again in 1997, when it was bought by the then Buena Vista Music Group, up until which it was based in North Carolina. It had a very successful alternative artist roster including acts such as Antenna, Blake Babies, Chainsaw Kittens, Dash Rip Rock, Dillon Fence, Frente!, Fun-Da-Mental, Fu Manchu, Jason &amp; the Scorchers, Joe Henry, Juliana Hatfield, Kill Creek, Machines of Loving Grace, the Bats, the Melvins, My Friend Steve, Seven Mary Three, Squirrel Nut Zippers, the Sidewinders, Vanilla Trainwreck, and Victoria Williams. In 2003, the label was folded into Hollywood Records.

Touchstone Records was a record label formed as a joint venture between Buena Vista Records and Touchstone Pictures in 1986. It was folded into Hollywood Records in 1998.

== &quot;For Scores&quot; podcast ==
On Friday, August 23, 2019, Disney Music Group debuted their first podcast, &quot;For Scores&quot;, produced with Treefort Media and longtime Disney Music executive Maria Kleinman and kicked of at D23. The podcast is a composer interview series with the composer working in film, television and games and hosted by journalist Jon Burlingame. The first set dropped has four episodes interviewing Henry Jackman, Pinar Toprak and Alan Silvestri. A second set is slated for October 2019 and a third for early 2020.

== Distribution ==
Originally, Disney Music Group did not have its own distribution network, either in its native market of the US or internationally. It had a licensing deal with Warner Music Group from 1995 to 2005, and BMG in Europe and Australia. Furthermore, Sony Music Entertainment was also a distributor of Hollywood Records&#x27; releases in mainland Asia. After the agreement with Warner expired, Disney engaged in distribution negotiations with other third-party companies.

In 2005, Disney relied mainly on Universal Music Group and EMI Music, given the territory. UMG&#x27;s Universal Music Distribution was responsible for distribution in the United States, Canada, India and other territories across North America, South America, Asia and Japan. Meanwhile, EMI conducted distribution in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and several other territories across Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In both agreements, Disney handled its own marketing and other similar functions.

In September 2012, Universal Music Group acquired EMI and initially pledged not to renew EMI&#x27;s European distribution license with Disney. However, in March 2013, Disney Music Group renegotiated their agreement with Universal Music Group, in which distribution and marketing rights were expanded on a worldwide basis, as a method of incurring collaboration between Disney&#x27;s record labels and artists with Universal&#x27;s production department. This allows DMG access to Universal&#x27;s large roster of award-winning music producers and songwriters. In return, UMG now will have access to Disney&#x27;s extensive marketing entities (including ABC, Radio Disney, Disney Channel, ABC Radio etc.).

Seoul Records, now Kakao M – South Korea&#x27;s biggest music distributor – formerly handled the Disney music catalog in the 1990s. The catalog was later acquired by S.M. Entertainment. (Universal Music Korea currently handles the Disney music catalog in South Korea.)

<text>Orlengate () was one of the biggest political scandals in modern Polish history. Disclosed in 2004, the scandal began with the arrest of Andrzej Modrzejewski, former CEO of PKN Orlen, on 7 February 2002 by the Office of State Protection (UOP). In 2004, Sejm initiated an investigatory committee to investigate the scandal.

Modrzejewski was arrested as per the order of the attorney general&#x27;s office. The arrest was a source of controversy from the beginning, carried out on the eve of a board of directors meeting. Two hours before the meeting, Modrzejewki was released and the board removed him from his position.

Former Treasury Minister Wiesław Kaczmarek stated in an interview with Gazeta Wyborcza that the real purpose of the arrest was to provoke Modrzejewki&#x27;s dismissal and to block the signing of a contract for oil worth 14 billion USD. According to this interview, the decision to arrest Modrzejewski was taken during an unofficial meeting of the Prime Minister&#x27;s cabinet with Leszek Miller, Minister of Justice Barbara Piwnik and Chief of the UOP, Zbigniew Siemiątkowski. Kaczmarek, who also participated, disclosed the purpose of the meeting to avoid possible future accusations of misconduct during his term as Treasury Minister.

For their part in the scandal, Ryszard Bieszyński and Zbigniew Siemiątkowski were arrested in 2012 and 2013 respectively.

==PKN Orlen investigation commission==

After the publication of the article, the Katowice attorney general began their investigation into the scandal. Sejm&#x27;s official Committee for Special Services started an independent investigation and found that the UOP put pressure on the attorney&#x27;s office. The ABW, the UOP&#x27;s successor, denied it. In April 2004, Sejm proposed a special investigative committee. This decision was taken by the Sejm on 28 May, and the first session happened on 6 July.

The commission discovered new threads in the case, and on 21 October 2004 it published notes from the Intelligence Agency describing a meeting between Jan Kulczyk and Władimir Ałganow in Vienna in July 2003. Kulczyk allegedly mentioned his influence on president Aleksander Kwaśniewski, who could enable a privatization of the Gdańsk refinery on advantageous conditions for the Russians.

On 10 November 2004, the committee obtained transcripts of 160 wiretapped calls of lobbyist Marek Dochnal from the ABW. Dochnal allegedly negotiated the sale of important energy firms with Treasury Minister Zbigniew Kaniewski. Dochnal was allegedly referred to the Minister by SLD member Andrzej Pęczak, who was working with Dochnal in exchange for a luxurious car. Calls between Pęczak and Dochnal&#x27;s coworker, Krzysztof Popenda were recorded, where the member negotiated the details of the car&#x27;s equipment.

In July 2006 the court acquitted Modrzejewski of charges relating to sharing of confidential information to Grzegorz Wieczerzak, and in December 2006 the court acquitted Modrzejewski and Wieczerak of other charges.

In 2012, Ryszard Bieszyński was convicted in relation to the case, along with Zbigniew Siemiątkowski in 2013. In the verbal justification of the judgement, the judge pointed towards the attorney general&#x27;s assistance of the UOP and the coordinated, extra-legal activities of the UOP and the Prime Minister Leszek Miller&#x27;s office.

The commission did not reach a conclusion. According to public opinion, it was considered a political tool of the right-wing opposition (Law and Justice, Civic Platform, League of Polish Families) to destroy the presidential aspirations of Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz.

<text>The Latidae, known as the lates perches, are a family of perch-like fish found in Africa, Asia, and the Indian and western Pacific Oceans. Including about 13 species, the family, previously classified subfamily Latinae in family Centropomidae, was raised to family status in 2004 after a cladistic analysis showed the original Centropomidae were paraphyletic.

The Latidae are characterised by having dorsal fins that are incompletely separated, or if they are separated, a few isolated spines will be found between the anterior and posterior parts of the fin. Their caudal fin is normally rounded. All species have a vertebral column made up of 25 vertebrae.

Many species in this family are important food fishes, and some have been introduced outside their native ranges to provide fishing stocks. The freshwater Nile perch, a fierce predator, has become infamous, as its introduction into Lake Victoria in the 1950s has wrought devastation on the native fishes of the lake, causing the extinction of many endemic cichlids there.

==Genera==
The Latidae contain three extant and one extinct genera:

* †&quot;Eolates&quot; 
* &quot;Hypopterus&quot; 
* &quot;Lates&quot; 
* &quot;Psammoperca&quot; 

† denotes that this taxon is extinct

<text>NASTRAN is a finite element analysis (FEA) program that was originally developed for NASA in the late 1960s under United States government funding for the aerospace industry. The MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation (MSC) was one of the principal and original developers of the publicly available NASTRAN code. NASTRAN source code is integrated in a number of different software packages, which are distributed by a range of companies.

== History ==

The 1964 annual review of NASA&#x27;s structural dynamics research program revealed that the research centers were separately developing structural analysis software that was specific to their own needs. The review recommended that a single generic software program should be used instead. In response, an ad hoc committee was formed. The committee determined that no existing software could meet their requirements. They suggested establishing a cooperative project to develop this software and created a specification that outlined the capabilities for the software.

A contract was awarded to Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) to develop the software. The first name used for the program during its development in the 1960s was GPSA, an acronym for General Purpose Structural Analysis. The eventual formal name approved by NASA for the program, NASTRAN, is an acronym formed from NASA STRuctural ANalysis. The NASTRAN system was released to NASA in 1968. In the late 1960s, the MacNeal-Schwendler Corporation (MSC) started to market and support its own version of NASTRAN, called MSC/NASTRAN (which eventually became MSC.Nastran). The original software architecture was developed by Joe Mule (NASA) and Gerald Sandler (NASA), and Stephen Burns (University of Rochester).

NASTRAN software application was written to help design more efficient space vehicles such as the Space Shuttle. NASTRAN was released to the public in 1971 by NASA&#x27;s Office of Technology Utilization. The commercial use of NASTRAN has helped to analyze the behavior of elastic structures of any size, shape, or purpose. It is used for example in designing railroad tracks, cars, bridges, power plants, skyscrapers, aircraft and many more. The program alone was estimated to have returned $701 million in cost savings from 1971 to 1984. NASTRAN was inducted into the U.S. Space Foundation&#x27;s Space Technology Hall of Fame in 1988, one of the first technologies to receive this prestigious honor.

The NASTRAN program has evolved over many versions. Each new version contains enhancements in analysis capability and numerical performance. Today, NASTRAN is widely used throughout the world in the aerospace, automotive and maritime industries. 

In 2001 the NASA released with the &quot;NASA Classics&quot; package also the NASTRAN source code to the public via Open Channel Software for fees.

In November 2002 MSC Software reached a final agreement with the FTC to resolve an antitrust case against the company in connection with two acquisitions of rival CAE vendors, Universal Analytics, Inc. (UAI) and Computerized Structural Analysis &amp; Research Corp. (CSAR). The FTC had alleged the acquisitions represented anticompetitive activities. Under the terms of the settlement, MSC divested a clone copy of its current Nastran software. The divestiture was through royalty-free, perpetual, non-exclusive licenses to UGS Corporation. UGS Corporation was acquired by Siemens in 2007.

Commercial versions of NASTRAN are currently available from several vendors.

== Software architecture ==

NASTRAN is written primarily in FORTRAN and contains over one million lines of code. NASTRAN is compatible with a large variety of computers and operating systems ranging from small workstations to the largest supercomputers.

NASTRAN was designed from the beginning to consist of several modules. A module is a collection of FORTRAN subroutines designed to perform a specific task—processing model geometry, assembling matrices, applying constraints, solving matrix problems, calculating output quantities, conversing with the database, printing the solution, and so on. The modules are controlled by an internal language called the Direct Matrix Abstraction Program (DMAP).

Each type of analysis available is called a solution sequence.

Some of the most common solution sequence codes are:
* 101 - Linear Static
* 103 - Modal
* 105 - Buckling
* 106 - Non-Linear Static
* 107 - Direct Complex Eigenvalue
* 108 - Direct Frequency Response
* 109 - Direct Transient Response
* 110 - Modal Complex Eigenvalue
* 111 - Modal Frequency Response
* 112 - Modal Transient Response
* 129 - Nonlinear Transient
* 144 - Static Aeroelastic Analysis
* 145 - Flutter / Aeroservoelastic analysis
* 146 - Dynamic Aeroelastic Analysis
* 153 - Non-Linear static coupled with heat transfer
* 159 - Nonlinear Transient coupled with Heat transfer
* 187 - Dynamic Design Analysis Method
* 200 - Design Optimization and Sensitivity analysis
* 400 - Non-Linear Static and Dynamic (implicit) (MSC.NASTRAN native, supersedes 106, 129, 153 and 159 - part of MSC.NASTRAN)
* 401 - Non-Linear Static, Dynamic, arc length, modal, etc. (Simcenter Nastran, formerly NX Nastran)
* 402 - Non-Linear Static and Dynamic (implicit) (SAMCEF based for NX.NASTRAN)
* 600 - Non-Linear Static and Dynamic (implicit) (front end to MSC.Marc - part of MSC.NASTRAN)
* 601 - Implicit Non-Linear (ADINA for NX Nastran, will no longer be available in NX NASTRAN after 2020)
* 700 - Explicit Non-Linear (LS Dyna plus MSC.Dytran - part of MSC.NASTRAN)
* 701 - Explicit Non-Linear (ADINA for NX Nastran, will no longer be available in NX NASTRAN after 2020)

== Associated software ==

NASTRAN is primarily a solver for finite element analysis. It does not have functionality that allows for graphically building a model or meshing. All input and output to the program is in the form of text files. However, multiple software vendors market pre- and post-processors designed to simplify building a finite element model and analyzing the results. These software tools include functionality to import and simplify CAD geometry, mesh with finite elements, and apply loads and restraints. The tools allow the user to submit an analysis to NASTRAN, and import the results and show them graphically. In addition to pre- and post-processing capabilities, several Nastran vendors have integrated more advanced nonlinear capabilities into their Nastran products.

== NASTRAN options ==

The following software options, based on NASTRAN original source code are available:
* MSC Nastran
* NASTRAN-xMG (acquired by MSC Software)
* NEi Nastran (A PC/Linux-based version of the original NASTRAN source code)
* NX Nastran (acquired by Siemens Digital Industry Software re-branded to Simcenter Nastran)
* Nastran distributed by the Open Channel Foundation

=== MSC Nastran ===

MSC Nastran is the original commercial Nastran product started by Dr. Richard MacNeal and Robert Schwendler in 1963. MSC Nastran is commonly utilized for performing structural analysis. Professor Caleb (Mac) McCormick a professor at Caltech was the key programmer at MSC who had an aha moment in applying matrix math to create structural analysis. Although utilized in every industry, it maintains a strong following in aerospace and automotive industries for performing computational stress and strain analysis of component and system level models of structures. Since 1963, MSC Nastran has continued to evolve and extend capabilities to dynamics, rotordynamics, nonlinear, thermal, high impact, NVH, fluid structural interactive and fatigue analysis. Today it couples with MSC Marc and LS-Dyna to provide highly nonlinear coupled analysis solutions.

=== NASTRAN-xMG ===

Built from the same base code as the original NASTRAN software created by NASA that includes the original NASTRAN architecture and DMAP language, NASTRAN-xMG provides unlimited problem size, high-speed solver technology, and substructuring analysis options. The principal founder of the company is Dr. Richard H. MacNeal.

=== NEi Nastran ===

NEi Nastran is a general purpose finite element analysis solver used to analyze linear and nonlinear stress, dynamics, and heat transfer characteristics of structures and mechanical components. It is available on a variety of platforms including 32/64-bit Windows and Linux.
This software was acquired by Autodesk in May 2014.
=== Simcenter Nastran (formerly known as NX Nastran) ===
NX Nastran resulted from an FTC action against MSC Corporation for alleged antitrust activity. The antitrust settlement allowed the 2003 purchase of a royalty-free, perpetual license for the MSC.Nastran 2001 source code by UGS. UGS was previously the Unigraphics division of EDS. Nastran&#x27;s CAE capabilities were added to NX Unigraphics&#x27; CAD and other components to form the EDS/UGS PLM Solutions product life-cycle management suite. This product line was acquired by SIEMENS in 2007 and became Siemens Digital Industry Software.

The purchase included a perpetual, worldwide, free of royalties, nonexclusive license of the software program MSC.Nastran v2001, other assets related to the software, and all copyright and trademark rights acquired as a result of MSC&#x27;s acquisitions of Universal Analytics Inc. and Computerized Structural Analysis &amp; Research Corp. in 1999.

Simcenter Nastran (NX Nastran) is now part of Siemens Digital Industry Software&#x27;s Simcenter product portfolio as one of the main solvers within their Simcenter 3D CAE application.

=== OCF Nastran ===
Both source and binary copies of Nastran are available from the Open Channel Foundation for an annual license fee. This was part of the NASA COSMIC Collection distribution from the National Technology Transfer Center. It was published in June 2015 on GitHub.

===Off-shoots===
The success of NASTRAN led to development of many other finite element software. One such software is ASTROS that extended NASTRAN type capability to include structural optimization. Currently ASTROS is maintained by Zona Technology, Inc.

=== Competition ===
Currently there are numerous commercially available FEA products, some of them being able to read the NASTRAN input format although not bearing the name NASTRAN. Many of them are listed on the List of finite element software packages, CAE, and FEA pages (see categories below).

<text>Roy Z Ramirez (born February 1968) is an American guitarist, songwriter and record producer, best known for his work with Bruce Dickinson (from Iron Maiden), Halford, and Judas Priest. He also is the founder of Tribe of Gypsies, a Latin-influenced hard rock band. Roy also helped write and produce the band Life After Death in 1996.

==Biography==
Roy Z was born Roy Ramirez in Pacoima, Los Angeles, California, United States, but changed his name in the 1980s because he felt &quot;ethnic names were not trendy at the time&quot;. Roy reversed Ramirez and became &#x27;Roy Zerimar&#x27;, though people began calling him &#x27;Roy Z&#x27; for short. Roy began playing guitar and studying music at a young age, influenced by players such as Peter Green, Uli Roth, Jimmy Page, Frank Marino, Carlos Santana, Michael Schenker, Yngwie Malmsteen, Jeff Beck, and Robin Trower. He was featured in Mike Varney&#x27;s &quot;Spotlight&quot; column in Guitar Player magazine.

A regular on the Southern California hard rock scene in the late 1980s, Roy played with several bands, including Seventh Thunder, Gypsy Moreno, Royal Flush, Driver, Warrior, and Mike Vescera. In 1991, Roy recorded a 5-song demo which netted a record deal with German indie label Dream Circle Records and led to the formation of Tribe of Gypsies.

When Bruce Dickinson split with Iron Maiden in 1993, he hand picked Roy and Tribe of Gypsies members Eddie Casillas (bass), David Ingraham (drums), and Doug van Booven (percussion) to complete his solo band. Adding a Latin feel to the metal legend&#x27;s distinctive voice, the resulting album &quot;Balls to Picasso&quot; is a somewhat eclectic affair, ranging from the power ballad &quot;Tears of the Dragon&quot; (which also received a music video) to the doomy rocker &quot;Cyclops&quot;. Although recorded in 1993, the self-titled Tribe of Gypsies debut album did not surface until 1996 when it was finally released on JVC/Victor in Japan. Three more releases followed in quick succession before the band finally toured the U.S. for the first time, supporting Santana on a handful of dates on the &quot;Supernatural&quot; tour.

After the commercial failure of his alternative rock styled &quot;Skunkworks&quot; album in 1996, Bruce Dickinson re-teamed with Roy on 1997&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Accident of Birth&quot; which also featured guitarist Adrian Smith (of Iron Maiden). The band would follow up strongly with 1998&#x27;s &quot;The Chemical Wedding&quot;, a concept album with a darker feel but equally praised along with &quot;Accident of Birth&quot; as a fan favorite, even jokingly called by some &quot;The best Iron Maiden album since &quot;Seventh Son&quot;.&quot;

Roy gained widespread industry acclaim for his work with Dickinson, and in 2000 he was tapped to produce the Rob Halford solo album &quot;Resurrection&quot;, which featured the duet &quot;The One You Love to Hate&quot; with Dickinson, as well as Helloween&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Ride&quot;. Roy would go on to produce and co-write every Halford album to date as well as taking over on guitar for the departing Pat Lachman in 2003. Roy also re-connected with his former Driver bandmate, vocalist Rob Rock, for a series of albums starting with 2000&#x27;s &quot;Rage of Creation&quot;.

Roy and Bruce again teamed up in 2003 to write and record &quot;Tyranny of Souls&quot;, released on Sanctuary Records. The pair could not find time to write the album together, so Roy would send riffs to Bruce, who was on the road with Iron Maiden, and Bruce would write melodies and lyrics. The album was recorded in Roy&#x27;s studio, and featured session players on drums and bass. Roy himself took a turn on bass for 2 songs, &quot;Believil&quot; and &quot;Power of the Sun.&quot; Vocals for the album were done in less than 2 weeks, with Bruce sleeping on a cot in the studio to maximize time. Dickinson had also been injured during a fall at an Iron Maiden show and was all but unable to stand. The album had to be shelved for more than eight months (later released in 2005), however, when in 2004, Roy got the call to produce and mix Judas Priest&#x27;s reunion album &quot;Angel of Retribution&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Roy was tapped by former Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach to produce his 2007 solo album, &quot;Angel Down&quot;, which included a guest vocal appearance by Guns N&#x27; Roses mainman Axl Rose.

In 2008, Roy and Rob Rock re-activated their long dormant band Driver and released their full-length debut, &quot;Sons of Thunder&quot;, which included re-recordings of the songs from the band&#x27;s 1990 cassette EP. Roy also took part in the Halford reunion and has played guitar alongside &quot;Metal&quot; Mike Chlasciak on all subsequent studio and live releases since, starting with the 2009 Christmas album, &quot;Halford III: Winter Songs&quot;. Roy has also continued his production work, including &quot;Ravenous&quot; by Swedish heavy metal band Wolf in 2009 and Brazilian thrashers Sepultura&#x27;s twelfth album, &quot;Kairos&quot;, in 2011.

In March 2013, news leaked that Roy was once again working with Bruce Dickinson and that the project would also involve former Scorpions guitarist Uli Jon Roth with whom both Z and Dickinson have performed live on different occasions. Ultimately, no new album with Dickinson would materialize but Dickinson has since acknowledged that &quot;If Eternity Should Fail&quot;, the opener on Iron Maiden&#x27;s 2015 album, &quot;The Book of Souls&quot;, stemmed from writing and demo sessions with Roy, although Dickinson is listed as the sole writer in the credits.

In 2014, Z&#x27;s band, Tribe of Gypsies, were invited to play the Rock of Ages Festival in Seebronn, Germany, their first and only show on the European continent to date. They also played a rare L.A. show supporting Latin all-stars De La Tierra, led by Sepultura&#x27;s Andreas Kisser. In early 2016, Tribe released a video for &quot;Yeah!&quot;, their first new song since 2006&#x27;s &quot;Dweller on the Threshold&quot;.

Z has continued to keep busy working as a producer, engineer and mixer, most recently with artists such as former Nevermore vocalist Warrel Dane, Peruvian metal band Flor de Loto, Russian rockers Aria, and all-star project Spirits of Fire featuring Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens (ex-Judas Priest, Iced Earth), Chris Caffery (Savatage, Trans-Siberian Orchestra), Steve Di Giorgio (Testament, Death), and Mark Zonder (ex-Fates Warning, Warlord). Z also co-wrote, played guitar on and produced the 2019 West Bound debut album, &quot;Volume One&quot;, a project fronted by his former Tribe of Gypsies bandmate, vocalist Chas West (Jason Bonham Band, Resurrection Kings).

After 11 years, in 2024, the album Bruce Dickinson and Roy have worked on has been finally released. It was named &quot;The Mandrake Project&quot; and it is a concept album following about Dr. Necropolis. In February 2024 it was officially announced that Roy would not be joining Bruce Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;House Band From Hell&quot; for live performances in support of the new album throughout the summer. It was later confirmed via Roy Z&#x27;s social media posts that there was a falling out between the two and they would no longer be collaborating.

<text>Shirali Farzali oghlu Muslumov, also spelled as Muslimov (, pronounced ; ; ; allegedly March 26, 1805? – September 2, 1973) was an Azerbaijani shepherd of Talysh ethnicity from the village of Barzavu in the Lerik District of Azerbaijan, a mountainous area near the Iranian border. He claimed to be the oldest person who ever lived when he died on September 2, 1973, at the alleged age of 168. In 1966, the studio Azerbaijanfilm shot a documentary film about him, &quot;Shirali descended from the mountain&quot;.

==Life==

A brief description of Muslimov&#x27;s life was first published in an article for &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1966. The article alleged that Muslimov was born in Barzavu in 1805 and that he was given a copper plate with his birth date and name inscribed. The plate was lost and was never verified but Muslimov was issued a passport in 1939. The article also alleged that Muslimov was never sick, worked full days and ate a diet consisting of rice soup, sheep milk, boiled meat, sweet tea and yogurt. Muslimov claimed that he could recall incidents from 150 years ago such as bandits attacking his village. In the absence of accurate records such as a birth certificate, gerontologists have disputed Muslimov&#x27;s age claims.

Muslimov&#x27;s story was picked up in 1973 by &quot;National Geographic&quot;, which told that on occasion he still rode horseback and tended an orchard planted in the 1870s. &quot;National Geographic&quot; later recanted on the claim. According to his obituary, published by &quot;Time&quot;, when Muslimov was 136 years old, he married 57-year-old Khatum-Khanum (1884–1988), and on the same year a baby girl was born to his family. This is the most advanced age in the whole world history which saw a man to become a father. His father lived for 110 years, mother - 90, and his last - third wife - 104 years outliving her husband for 15 years.

The only evidence in favour of Muslimov&#x27;s age claim is a passport that listed his birthdate. Muslimov had no known birth certificate.

==Fame==
The case of Muslumov became known in 1963, when a young photojournalist of TASS, Kalman Kaspiev, went to Barzavu to interview the centenarian. The story was picked up by the Soviet press, by National Geographic, and by the Danone company, which for promotional reasons suggested that the longevity of Muslumov was linked to a diet of dairy, and yogurt in particular. This interest changed the life of the small Azerbaijani village, which was connected to the electricity grid and started receiving radio and television broadcasts.

In the 1970s, Westerners were made aware of these extreme claims of longevity in Azerbaijan and elsewhere in the Caucasus region when a U.S. Danone yogurt commercial invoked some of these people to suggest that the secret of their long lives lay in the frequent consumption of yogurt. However, the idea that peoples of the Caucasus region live longer because of eating yogurt is a myth not supported by any factual evidence.

<doc id="1302589" wikidata="Q1515253" url="?curid=1302589" title="Leakage inductance">
<text>Leakage inductance derives from the electrical property of an imperfectly coupled transformer whereby each winding behaves as a self-inductance in series with the winding&#x27;s respective ohmic resistance constant. These four winding constants also interact with the transformer&#x27;s mutual inductance. The winding leakage inductance is due to leakage flux not linking with all turns of each imperfectly coupled winding.

Leakage reactance is usually the most important element of a power system transformer due to power factor, voltage drop, reactive power consumption and fault current considerations.

Leakage inductance depends on the geometry of the core and the windings. Voltage drop across the leakage reactance results in often undesirable supply regulation with varying transformer load. But it can also be useful for harmonic isolation (attenuating higher frequencies) of some loads.

Leakage inductance applies to any imperfectly coupled magnetic circuit device including motors.

==Leakage inductance and inductive coupling factor==

The magnetic circuit&#x27;s flux that does not interlink both windings is the leakage flux corresponding to primary leakage inductance LPσ and secondary leakage inductance LSσ. Referring to Fig. 1, these leakage inductances are defined in terms of transformer winding open-circuit inductances and associated coupling coefficient or coupling factor formula_1.

The primary open-circuit self-inductance is given by

:formula_2 ------ (Eq. 1.1a)

where

:formula_3 ------ (Eq. 1.1b)
:formula_4 ------ (Eq. 1.1c)

and

:*formula_5 is primary self-inductance
:*formula_6 is primary leakage inductance
:*formula_7 is magnetizing inductance
:*formula_1 is inductive coupling coefficient

Measuring basic transformer inductances &amp; coupling factor

Transformer self-inductances formula_9 &amp; formula_10 and mutual inductance formula_11 are, in additive and subtractive series connection of the two windings, given by,

::::in additive connection, 
::::formula_12, and,

::::in subtractive connection, 
::::formula_13

:::such that these transformer inductances can be determined from the following three equations:
::::formula_14
::::formula_15 
::::formula_16.

The coupling factor is derived from the inductance value measured across one winding with the other winding short-circuited according to the following:

:::Per Eq. 2.7,
::::formula_17 and formula_18 
:::Such that
::::formula_19
The Campbell bridge circuit can also be used to determine transformer self-inductances and mutual inductance using a variable standard mutual inductor pair for one of the bridge sides.
It therefore follows that the open-circuit self-inductance and inductive coupling factor formula_1 are given by
:formula_21 ------ (Eq. 1.2), and,
:formula_22, with 0 &lt; formula_1 &lt; 1 ------ (Eq. 1.3)

where
:formula_24
:formula_25

and

:*formula_11 is mutual inductance
:*formula_27 is secondary self-inductance
:*formula_28 is secondary leakage inductance
:*formula_29 is magnetizing inductance referred to the secondary
:*formula_1 is inductive coupling coefficient
:*formula_31 is the approximate turns ratio

The electric validity of the transformer diagram in Fig. 1 depends strictly on open-circuit conditions for the respective winding inductances considered. More generalized circuit conditions are as developed in the next two sections.

==Inductive leakage factor and inductance==
A nonideal linear two-winding transformer can be represented by two mutual inductance-coupled circuit loops linking the transformer&#x27;s five impedance constants as shown in Fig. 2. 

where

:*M is mutual inductance
:*formula_32 &amp; formula_33 are primary and secondary winding resistances
:*Constants formula_11, formula_9, formula_10, formula_32 &amp; formula_33 are measurable at the transformer&#x27;s terminals
:*Coupling factor formula_1 is defined as
:::formula_40, where 0 &lt; formula_1 &lt; 1 ------ (Eq. 2.1)
The winding turns ratio formula_42 is in practice given as
:formula_43 ------ (Eq. 2.2).

where

:*NP &amp; NS are primary and secondary winding turns
:*vP &amp; vS and iP &amp; iS are primary &amp; secondary winding voltages &amp; currents.

The nonideal transformer&#x27;s mesh equations can be expressed by the following voltage and flux linkage equations,

:formula_44 ------ (Eq. 2.3)
:formula_45 ------ (Eq. 2.4)
:formula_46 ------ (Eq. 2.5)
:formula_47 ------ (Eq. 2.6),

:where

:*formula_48 is flux linkage 
:*formula_49 is derivative of flux linkage with respect to time.

These equations can be developed to show that, neglecting associated winding resistances, the ratio of a winding circuit&#x27;s inductances and currents with the other winding short-circuited and at open-circuit test is as follows,

:formula_50 ------ (Eq. 2.7),

:where,

:*ioc &amp; isc are open-circuit and short-circuit currents 
:*Loc &amp; Lsc are open-circuit and short-circuit inductances.
:*formula_51 is the inductive leakage factor or Heyland factor
:*formula_52 &amp; formula_53 are primary and secondary short-circuited leakage inductances.

The transformer inductance can be characterized in terms of the three inductance constants as follows,
:formula_54 ------ (Eq. 2.8) 
:formula_55 ------ (Eq. 2.9) 
:formula_56 ------ (Eq. 2.10) ,

where,

:*LM is magnetizing inductance, corresponding to magnetizing reactance XM
:*LPσ &amp; LSσ are primary &amp; secondary leakage inductances, corresponding to primary &amp; secondary leakage reactances XPσ &amp; XSσ.

The transformer can be expressed more conveniently as the equivalent circuit in Fig. 3 with secondary constants referred (i.e., with prime superscript notation) to the primary,
:formula_57
:formula_58
:formula_59
:formula_60.

Since 
:formula_61 ------ (Eq. 2.11)

and

:formula_62 ------ (Eq. 2.12),

we have
:formula_63 ------ (Eq. 2.13),
which allows expression of the equivalent circuit in Fig. 4 in terms of winding leakage and magnetizing inductance constants as follows,

:formula_64 ------ (Eq. 2.14 formula_65 Eq. 1.1b)
:formula_66 ------ (Eq. 2.15 formula_65 Eq. 1.1c).
The nonideal transformer in Fig. 4 can be shown as the simplified equivalent circuit in Fig. 5, with secondary constants referred to the primary and without ideal transformer isolation, where,
:formula_68 ------ (Eq. 2.16)
:*formula_69 is magnetizing current excited by flux ΦM that links both primary and secondary windings
:*formula_70 is the primary current
:*formula_71 is the secondary current referred to the primary side of the transformer.

==Refined inductive leakage factor==

Refined inductive leakage factor derivation

a. Per Eq. 2.1 &amp; IEC IEV 131-12-41 inductive coupling factor formula_1 is given by
:formula_73 --------------------- (Eq. 2.1):
b. Per Eq. 2.7 &amp; IEC IEV 131-12-42 Inductive leakage factor formula_51 is given by
:formula_75 ------ (Eq. 2.7) &amp; (Eq. 3.7a)
c. formula_76 multiplied by formula_77 gives
:formula_78 ----------------- (Eq. 3.7b)
d. Per Eq. 2-8 &amp; knowing that formula_79
:formula_80 ---------------------- (Eq. 3.7c)
e. formula_81 multiplied by formula_82 gives
:formula_83 ------------------ (Eq. 3.7d)
f. Per Eq. 3.5 formula_84 Eq. 1.1b &amp; Eq. 2.14 and Eq. 3.6 formula_84 Eq. 1.1b &amp; Eq. 2.14:
:formula_86 --- (Eq.3.7e)

All equations in this article assume steady-state constant-frequency waveform conditions the formula_1 &amp; formula_51 values of which are dimensionless, fixed, finite &amp; positive but less than 1.
Referring to the flux diagram in Fig. 6, the following equations hold:

:σP = ΦPσ/ΦM = LPσ/LM ------ (Eq. 3.1 formula_89 Eq. 2.7)
In the same way,
:σS = ΦSσ&#x27;/ΦM = LSσ&#x27;/LM ------ (Eq. 3.2 formula_89 Eq. 2.7)
And therefore,
:ΦP = ΦM + ΦPσ = ΦM + σPΦM = (1 + σP)ΦM ------ (Eq. 3.3)
:ΦS&#x27; = ΦM + ΦSσ&#x27; = ΦM + σSΦM = (1 + σS)ΦM ------ (Eq. 3.4)

:LP = LM + LPσ = LM + σPLM = (1 + σP)LM ------ (Eq. 3.5 formula_84 Eq. 1.1b &amp; Eq. 2.14) 
:LS&#x27; = LM + LSσ&#x27; = LM + σSLM = (1 + σS)LM ------ (Eq. 3.6 formula_89 Eq. 1.1b &amp; Eq. 2.14),
where

:*σP &amp; σS are, respectively, primary leakage factor &amp; secondary leakage factor
:*ΦM &amp; LM are, respectively, mutual flux &amp; magnetizing inductance
:*ΦPσ &amp; LPσ are, respectively, primary leakage flux &amp; primary leakage inductance
:*ΦSσ&#x27; &amp; LSσ&#x27; are, respectively, secondary leakage flux &amp; secondary leakage inductance both referred to the primary.
The leakage ratio σ can thus be refined in terms of the interrelationship of above winding-specific inductance and Inductive leakage factor equations as follows:

:formula_93 ------ (Eq. 3.7a to 3.7e).
==Applications==
Leakage inductance can be an undesirable property, as it causes the voltage to change with loading.

In many cases it is useful. Leakage inductance has the useful effect of limiting the current flows in a transformer (and load) without itself dissipating power (excepting the usual non-ideal transformer losses). Transformers are generally designed to have a specific value of leakage inductance such that the leakage reactance created by this inductance is a specific value at the desired frequency of operation. In this case, actually working useful parameter is not the leakage inductance value but the short-circuit inductance value.

Commercial and distribution transformers rated up to say 2,500 kVA are usually designed with short-circuit impedances of between about 3% and 6% and with a corresponding formula_94 ratio (winding reactance/winding resistance ratio) of between about 3 and 6, which defines the percent secondary voltage variation between no-load and full load. Thus for purely resistive loads, such transformers&#x27; full-to-no-load voltage regulation will be between about 1% and 2%.

High leakage reactance transformers are used for some negative resistance applications, such as neon signs, where a voltage amplification (transformer action) is required as well as current limiting. In this case the leakage reactance is usually 100% of full load impedance, so even if the transformer is shorted out it will not be damaged. Without the leakage inductance, the negative resistance characteristic of these gas discharge lamps would cause them to conduct excessive current and be destroyed.

Transformers with variable leakage inductance are used to control the current in arc welding sets. In these cases, the leakage inductance limits the current flow to the desired magnitude. Transformer leakage reactance has a large role in limiting circuit fault current within the maximum allowable value in the power system.

In addition, the leakage inductance of a HF-transformer can replace a series inductor in a resonant converter. In contrast, connecting a conventional transformer and an inductor in series results in the same electric behavior as of a leakage transformer, but this can be advantageous to reduce the eddy current losses in the transformer windings caused by the stray field.

<text>Johannes Evangelista Gossner (14 December 1773 – 20 March 1858), German divine and philanthropist, was born at Hausen near Augsburg.

He was educated at the University of Dillingen, where he studied for priesthood with two years course of Philosophy, and Physics in 1791. He, like Martin Boos and others, came under the spell of the Evangelical movement promoted by Johann Michael Sailer, the professor of pastoral theology. He moved to Neuburg in 1790’s where he was influenced by the movement of revival in South Bavaria known as &quot;The Awakening&quot;.

After taking priests&#x27; orders, Gossner held livings at Dirlewang (1804-1811) and Munich (1811-1817). His evangelical tendencies led to difficulties when he was taken to church court in 1802 and eventually brought about his dismissal. In 1826 he formally left the Roman Catholic for the Protestant communion. As Reformed (Calvinist) minister of Bethlehem&#x27;s Church (1829-1846), a Lutheran and Reformed simultaneum in Berlin, he was conspicuous not only for practical and effective preaching, but for the founding of schools, asylums and missionary agencies.

In 1836, he founded the Gossner Mission, which aimed for a holistic understanding of mission (preaching the gospel and church social service). Its purpose was “to train young men from the craftsman class and every other class in a shorter and less expensive way than usual to become assistants in the mission, to become deacons, catechists, school teachers and collaborators in the holy work.” They have to work in “apostolic, unbound and humble simplicity”, following the example of the congregation of the Moravian Church “under the presidency of Jesus Christ.“ Missionaries were initially sent out to Australia. This missionary work is still active today in Germany and, among other places, in India and Nepal.

Lives of Gossner were written by Bethmann Hollweg (Berlin, 1858) and Hermann Dalton (Berlin, 1878).

<text>George Athans (born 6 July 1952) is a Canadian retired competitive water skier. During his career he won 10 consecutive national titles from 1965 to 1974, the first at age 13. Also known as George Athans Jr. to distinguish him from his father, Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame diver George Athans Sr.

Born in Kelowna, British Columbia, Athans was a member of the Canadian water ski team from 1966 to 1974 and participated in his first world championship in 1967. Athans won the world water ski championship in 1971 and 1973 and was named Canada&#x27;s male amateur athlete of the year in both of those years. At his final national championship in 1974, his closest competitor was his brother, Greg Athans. A knee injury prevented Athans from competing for the Canadian title in 1975 and he retired from competition.

During his competitive career, Athans moved to Montreal to attend Sir George Williams University. He competed in the Canadian &quot;Superstars&quot; competition in 1978 (finishing fourth) and 1979 (second). Following his retirement, Athans worked as a commentator for CBC Sports and founded Athans Communications, a video production company based in Montreal.

Athans was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1974 and has been inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame (1971), Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame (1974), the Quebec Sports Hall of Fame (1980), the International Water Ski Federation Hall of Fame (1993), and the Water Ski and Wakeboard Canada Hall of Fame (2004).

<text>François Jules Edmond Got (1 October 1822, in Lignerolles, Orne – 21 March 1901, in Passy, a district in Paris) was a French stage actor, comedian, and opera librettist.

Edmond Got entered the Conservatoire in 1841, winning the second prize for comedy that year and the first in 1842. After a year of military service he made his debut at the Comédie Française on 17 July 1844, as Alexis in &quot;Les Héritiers&quot; and Mascarelles in &quot;Les Précieuses ridicules&quot;. He was immediately admitted &quot;pensionnaire&quot;, and became &quot;sociétaire&quot; in 1850. By special permission of the emperor in 1866 he played at the Odéon in Emile Augier&#x27;s &quot;Contagion&quot;. His golden jubilee at the Théâtre Français was celebrated in 1894, and he made his final appearance the year after.

Got was a fine representative of the grand style of French acting, and was much admired in England as well as in Paris. He wrote two librettos for operas by Edmond Membrée (1820-1892), &quot;François Villon&quot; (1857) and &quot;L&#x27;Esclave&quot; (1874). In 1881, he was decorated with the cross of the Legion of Honour.

<doc id="1302610" wikidata="Q3352067" url="?curid=1302610" title="Omni Television">
<text>Omni Television (stylized as OMNI Television) is a Canadian television system and group of specialty channels owned by Rogers Sports &amp; Media, a subsidiary of Rogers Communications. It currently consists of all six of Canada&#x27;s conventional multicultural television stations, which are located in Ontario (two stations), British Columbia, Alberta (two stations), and an affiliate in Quebec. The system&#x27;s flagship station is CFMT in Toronto, which was the first independent multicultural television station in Canada. 

The Omni brand was first introduced in 2002 after Rogers launched a second station in Toronto, CJMT; the two stations were collectively branded as Omni Television, with CJMT branding as &quot;Omni.2&quot; and focusing on programs targeting Asian and African communities, and CFMT &quot;Omni.1&quot; focusing on targeting the European and Caribbean communities. The Omni brand expanded outside of Toronto for the first time in 2005, with Rogers&#x27; acquisition of religious independent stations in Vancouver and Winnipeg. 

In 2007, Rogers secured new multicultural licenses in Calgary and Edmonton, announced its sale of the Vancouver and Winnipeg stations to S-VOX, and then acquired Vancouver&#x27;s existing multicultural station CHNM. In 2012, Omni added an affiliate in Montreal via the new multicultural station CFHD-DT, with Rogers agreeing to help support the station in exchange for relieving CJNT of its own multicultural remit.

Since September 2017, Omni began to be distributed throughout the remainder of the country, as a group of specialty channels with mandatory carriage. This group is licensed under the blanket name Omni Regional; Rogers argued that revenue from mandatory carriage was necessary to restore and sustain the stations&#x27; local programming. Originally licensed by the CRTC on a three-year interim basis while the commission considered alternative proposals for a national multicultural channel, the Commission ultimately chose to re-licence Omni Regional until at least 2023, on the basis of commitments to expanded Canadian programming production.

==Etymology==
Derived from the Latin word &quot;omnis&quot; meaning &quot;all&quot;, &quot;Omni&quot; is not an acronym, although the name is written all in capital letters.

==History==

Toronto&#x27;s CFMT launched in 1979 as Canada&#x27;s first multilingual/multicultural television station, owned by Multilingual Television (Toronto) Ltd. The station was originally referred to as &quot;MTV&quot; before using its call letters to identify on-air in 1983 due to confusion with the American music video channel. As its initial format was 100% ethnic, the station experienced financial difficulties, and was on the verge of bankruptcy when Rogers stepped in and purchased it in 1986. Rogers then attempted to launch a similar multicultural station in Vancouver in 1996, 1999 and 2002, but all three attempts were rejected by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). It was, however, given a second multicultural licence in Toronto to provide room for additional multicultural programing, and launched CJMT as a sister station to CFMT in fall 2002. It was at this point that the &quot;OMNI Television&quot; brand was introduced, with CFMT and CJMT branded as &quot;OMNI.1&quot; and &quot;OMNI.2&quot; respectively.

The Omni brand was expanded in 2005, when Rogers acquired two religious TV stations, CHNU in the Vancouver market and CIIT in Winnipeg, from Trinity Television. CHNU was rebranded from &quot;NOWTV&quot; to &quot;OMNI.10&quot; in September 2005, while CIIT went on air as &quot;OMNI.11&quot; on February 6, 2006.

===2007 realignment===

Several proposed changes to the Omni system were announced, either by Rogers or by the CRTC, during a one-month span from June to July 2007. First, on June 8, the CRTC granted Rogers licences to operate new multicultural stations in Calgary and Edmonton, beating out a competing proposal from Multivan Broadcast Corporation (which won the bid for the Vancouver multicultural licence in 2002 against Rogers and launched CHNM-TV).

On June 28, 2007, Rogers made public its offer to sell the religious-licensed Omni stations in Winnipeg and Vancouver as part of its contemporaneous purchase of Citytv (which the CRTC ordered CTVglobemedia to sell them off as part of the CHUM Limited takeover deal). Rogers indicated, however, that it viewed retaining the multilingual licences in Toronto, Calgary and Edmonton (effectively creating twinsticks in those three markets) as compatible with CRTC policy, since they are licensed to serve a different programming niche than the general interest Citytv stations.

On July 7, Rogers announced an agreement to purchase the aforementioned CHNM, finally securing a true multicultural television licence in Vancouver. The fact that Rogers had acquired the Calgary and Edmonton multicultural licences, beating out Multivan&#x27;s competing applications, was cited as a major reason for the sale.

On September 28, the CRTC approved Rogers&#x27; takeover of the Citytv stations, giving the company one year to divest itself of the religious Omni stations. A tentative deal to sell the stations to S-VOX, owner of VisionTV, was announced on November 6. On March 31, 2008, the CRTC approved both Rogers&#x27; acquisition of CHNM and its sale of CIIT and CHNU to S-VOX. CHNU was rebranded as &quot;CHNU 10&quot; on October 31, 2007, a year before the Omni brand was transferred to CHNM. CIIT was rebranded &quot;CIIT11&quot; in July 2008, after S-VOX took control of the station. Both stations rebranded as Joytv on September 1, 2008; CHNM rebranded as &quot;Omni BC&quot; on the same date. The two new stations in Calgary and Edmonton launched on September 15, 2008 under the call letters CJCO and CJEO.

===Partnership with ICI Montreal, cutbacks===

Rogers announced an agreement to acquire the one Canadian multicultural television station it did not already own, CJNT-DT Montreal on May 3, 2012, from Channel Zero, after having passed on the opportunity when the station was previously put up for sale in 2009 by Canwest during its financial difficulties. While intending to relaunch it as a Citytv station, Rogers did not rule out the possibility of requesting that CJNT be re-licensed as an English-language station, but in the meantime CJNT aired Omni programs (including &quot;Omni News&quot;) to fulfill much of its ethnic programming requirements after it became affiliated with Citytv prior to the sale. As part of the sale, Rogers requested that the CRTC convert CJNT to an English-language station, on the condition that both Channel Zero and Rogers provide services and resources to CFHD-DT, International Channel/Canal International (ICI), a newly proposed, locally owned multicultural station. Both were approved by the CRTC on December 20, 2012. ICI officially launched on December 11, 2013.

In the mid-2010&#x27;s, the Omni stations struggled financially; Rogers Media president Keith Pelley explained that between 2011 and 2014, advertising revenue had fallen from to . On May 30, 2013, Rogers announced the shutdown of production facilities at CJCO and CJEO, ending the production of local programming and news content from the Omni Alberta stations, and as a result, the discontinuation of the South Asian newscasts. On May 7, 2015, Rogers announced further cuts affecting Omni, including the re-structuring of the &quot;Omni News&quot; programs, the cancellation of &quot;V-Mix&quot; and &quot;Bollywood Boulevard&quot;, and the elimination of redundancy in technical staff between the Omni and Citytv stations.

=== Licensing as a must-carry specialty channel ===

On June 14, 2016, Rogers announced that it had submitted an application to the CRTC for a new, national specialty channel known as Omni Regional. The service would consist of four feeds; &quot;Pacific&quot;, &quot;Prairies&quot;, &quot;East&quot;, and &quot;ICI Quebec&quot;, which mirror the programming of the corresponding Omni Television O&amp;O and affiliate stations in their respective regions (Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal). The East feed specifically mirrors CJMT (Omni.2), which primarily focuses on the south and east Asian communities. CFMT (Omni.1), which focuses on European and Latin American communities, retains its existing distribution in southern and eastern Ontario. Rogers also sought 9(1)(&quot;h&quot;) must-carry status for the service.

Colette Watson, Rogers&#x27; vice president of television, stated that Omni Television was &quot;not sustainable in its current state&quot;; the company stated that must-carry status for the Omni Regional channels would result in an additional $14 million in annual revenue from carriage fees, which it planned to mostly invest into the production of daily half-hour national newscasts in the Cantonese, Italian, Mandarin, and Punjabi languages—programming that had been cancelled in 2015 in the previous round of cuts. Omni also pledged to increase its investments in original domestic content. 

With reservations, CRTC approved Rogers&#x27; application for Omni Regional on May 15, 2017, and granted it must-carry status under a provisional three-year term. This requires the service to be offered on the lowest tier of service by all Canadian digital television providers. In regions where Omni already operates terrestrially, providers may be relieved from carrying the Omni Regional version of the service on their lineups, or vice versa. Omni Regional launched on September 1, 2017.

==== Call for applications and 2020 renewal ====
In its approval, the CRTC felt that Omni Regional&#x27;s business model was financially unsustainable, as there were no significant plans for new original programming beyond newscasts, and Rogers did not sufficiently demonstrate that the service would &quot;ensure a sufficient reflection of Canada&#x27;s third-language communities&quot;, as its structure did not sufficiently serve regions not currently served by an Omni station (such as Atlantic and Central Canada). As such, the CRTC recognized that there was &quot;[an] exceptional need for a national, multilingual multi-ethnic programming service that can provide Canadians with news and current events programming in multiple languages from a Canadian perspective&quot;, and formally requested applications for a national, multicultural specialty service that would receive must-carry status.

The CRTC announced the eight applicants on April 17, 2018, which included competing proposals by companies such as Bell Media, the &quot;Corriere Canadese&quot;, and Ethnic Channels Group among others. Rogers proposed maintaining the existing Omni Regional structure, but with an increased investment in original scripted and factual programming, the addition of Arabic, Hindi, and Tagalog-language newscasts, local newscasts on the East, Pacific, and Prairies feeds in Mandarin and Punjabi, and a local newscast in Italian on the East feed (which would replace the Italian national newscast, as the majority of Canada&#x27;s Italian population lives in Ontario and Quebec).

In May 2019, the CRTC approved Rogers&#x27; application, granting Omni Regional a three-year license renewal taking effect September 1, 2020. Changes included that at least 70% of the broadcast day and 70% of primetime must be devoted to Canadian productions, and at least 12 hours of programming per-week must be acquired from independent producers (including at least two hours per-week of programming reflecting the Atlantic provinces, and two hours reflecting Manitoba and Saskatchewan). The number of daily national newscasts expanded to six, and there will be six hours per-week of local news programming for Calgary/Edmonton, Toronto, and Vancouver. Programming must be governed by advisory panels for each region, and Rogers must maintain the Omni broadcast stations during the services&#x27; license terms. The service must also be operated on a break-even basis, with all additional profit re-invested into its operations. Rogers is only allowed to solicit advertising in the regions of the existing Omni broadcast stations.

The decision to maintain Rogers&#x27; service was controversial; &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; media analyst Steve Faguy noted that the CRTC&#x27;s decision contained no discussion of any of the other applicants, which he considered &quot;shocking&quot;. In June 2019, the &quot;Corriere Canadese&quot; sent a letter to the cabinet requesting an appeal of the CRTC&#x27;s decision, citing that the Commission ignored &quot;widespread and intense dissatisfaction&quot; with Rogers and Omni &quot;in respect of its minimal conditions of license for Omni Regional to serve the multi-lingual multi-ethnic community of Canadians&quot;. The complaint pointed out the CRTC&#x27;s previous disagreement with the structure of Omni Regional upon its initial approval, and argued that the new proposal also weakened Omni&#x27;s mandates to provide ethnic news and public affairs programming (replacing four hour-long programs in specific languages with six half-hour programs in non-specific third languages). It argued that &quot;the CRTC choice is an affront to its original Call for a unique service, to the objectives of the Broadcasting Act and to the constitutionality of the principles of equality inherent in the Multiculturalism Act.&quot;

Independent Community Television Montreal (ICTV)—who had proposed a service known as Tele1—also requested an appeal, accusing CRTC commissioners Ian Scott and Caroline J. Simard of having &quot;communicated independently with representatives of Rogers and Bell on multiple occasions and without notice to ICTV&quot;, resulting in an unfair process.

In August 2019, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the case, and the CRTC&#x27;s decision was upheld by the Department of Canadian Heritage.

==Programming==
All Rogers-owned Omni stations are licensed to air programming in no fewer than 20 languages to communities encompassing at least 20 cultures—ethnic programming comprises 60% of the Omni stations&#x27; schedules. The Toronto-based Omni stations are differently licensed with respect to the languages and communities they serve: CFMT airs programming for European and Caribbean language communities, while CJMT airs programming for the Pan-Asian and Pan-African audiences. Since 2019, Omni Television has carried the Eurovision Song Contest.

Omni stations formerly scheduled a limited amount of English-language entertainment programming aimed at mainstream audiences, such as syndicated sitcoms, talk shows, and game shows, as well as CBS&#x27;s late-night talk shows (primarily &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; under Tom Snyder and the majority of Craig Ferguson&#x27;s run). The Omni stations do not typically air primetime programs simulcast from U.S. networks, but Omni occasionally served as an overflow channel for Citytv after Rogers&#x27; purchase of the network—allowing them to maintain their simsub rights in its duopoly markets. As of the 2015–16 television season, all of these programs have been dropped, and nearly all of the Omni stations&#x27; schedules are devoted exclusively to ethnic programming.

While under Rogers ownership, CHNU and CIIT aired many of the same types of programs as CFMT and CJMT, despite the difference in the nature of service of multicultural and religious stations. CHNU and CIIT had previously aired many of the same types of syndicated sitcoms and multicultural programs shown regularly on the Omni stations in Toronto, and the Toronto stations carried some religious teaching programs. The common brand allowed cost savings for promotions and for the acquisition of the general-entertainment programs that all of the Omni stations had used to generate most of their revenues. However, due in particular to Vancouver multicultural station CHNM (while under Multivan ownership) and Toronto religious station CITS, which both opposed Rogers&#x27;s acquisition of Trinity&#x27;s religious stations, the Omni stations&#x27; core formats remained intact.

===Sports===
Omni Television stations have occasionally aired sporting events in minority languages, and in English as an overflow for Citytv or Sportsnet. Prior to their move to Citytv and the eventual acquisition of late games by CTV, the Omni stations aired late-afternoon NFL games for a period, and in the 2014 season, simulcast selected &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; games from CBS (which also aired on Sportsnet). During the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Omni stations broadcast coverage of the games in minority languages as part of the CTV/Rogers consortium.

On June 27, 2013, CJMT in Toronto broadcast Mandarin-language coverage of a Toronto Blue Jays Major League Baseball game started by Taiwanese player Chien-Ming Wang, marking the first ever Canadian MLB broadcast in the language.

Rogers acquired national media rights to the National Hockey League beginning in the 2014–15 NHL season; the Omni stations added &quot;Hockey Night in Canada: Punjabi Edition&quot;, which features Punjabi-language telecasts of NHL games on Saturday nights, and selected playoff games. The Punjabi broadcasts are carried over from the CBC&#x27;s past digital coverage of games in the language.

Beginning in the later half of the 2018 season, and expanding into the 2019 season, Omni carried a regular schedule of Sunday-afternoon Blue Jays games in Tagalog.

===News===

Prior to its rebranding as Omni 1 in 2002, CFMT aired news in Portuguese, Italian and Cantonese from Monday to Friday, with a Mandarin program on the weekend. With the launch of CJMT (branded as Omni 2), a South Asian news program in English was introduced, and Mandarin was expanded from weekends only to Monday to Friday newscasts.

CHNM, or Omni British Columbia, was branded as Channel M prior to its purchase by Rogers in 2008. As Channel M, and after being bought by Rogers, CHNM produced a national newscast in Punjabi, as well as Cantonese and Mandarin. Omni Alberta also produced newscasts in Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as an English language South Asian newscast, from its launch in 2008 until 2011. The programs featured coverage of Canadian news stories in the language, along with stories from foreign broadcasters in countries in which the language is natively spoken (or the Indian subcontinent, in the case of the Punjabi edition).

On May 7, 2015, Rogers announced a restructuring of Omni News programs as part of cutbacks that led to the loss of 110 jobs across the company. The existing newscasts would by replaced by new public affairs-oriented programs produced in Cantonese, Mandarin and Punjabi. The new programs featured in-depth discussion of local issues, and did not feature original news reporting. Colette Watson, Rogers&#x27; vice president of television, explained that the decision to drop the newscasts was financially motivated; the newscasts only brought in in advertising revenue per-year, but had production expenses of .

Rogers&#x27; decision to drop ethnic newscasts resulted in criticism by Julian Fantino, Member of Parliament for Vaughan, who described the loss of Italian-language news coverage to be &quot;devastating&quot;; Vaughan has a notably large population of Italians, Following an unsatisfactory response by the company, Fantino called upon Rogers representatives to appear before the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.

As part of the Omni Regional service, Rogers reinstated half-hour national newscasts in the Cantonese, Italian, Mandarin and Punjabi languages. In September 2020, Arabic and Filipino newscasts were added.

Meanwhile, Rogers subcontracted production of Omni&#x27;s new Chinese-language newscasts to Fairchild Media Group, owner of the Cantonese Fairchild TV and Mandarin Talentvision channels. Unifor and community groups questioned whether this arrangement was in compliance with Omni Regional&#x27;s CRTC license, which stated that the service would &quot;produce and broadcast&quot; half-hour national newscasts in multiple languages, but leaving it unclear whether they must be produced by the licensee itself. They also cited concerns over Fairchild&#x27;s news coverage having historically skewed conservative. Rogers defended the partnership as compliant with the license, and stated that they had editorial control over the programs. Unifor stated that it would file a grievance and a complaint with the CRTC over this agreement. The CRTC dismissed the complaint in April 2018, ruling that &quot;produce&quot; was broadly defined to allow for subcontracting, and that Rogers&#x27; editorial control (including limits on content sharing with newscasts on Fairchild&#x27;s own channels) were sufficient as to not reduce the diversity of voices.

=== High definition ===
In the fall of 2004, Omni launched high definition simulcasts of both Toronto stations, CFMT and CJMT. However, at the time both stations were only available through digital cable. In the summer of 2008, both stations began broadcasting digitally over-the-air. In December 2009, CHNM began broadcasting an over-the-air digital signal and broadcasts in standard definition.

<text>The Vadstena bracteate (Rundata Ög 178, IK 377.1) is a gold C-bracteate found in the ground at Vadstena, Sweden, in 1774. Along with the bracteate was a gold ring and a piece of gold sheet: all were nearly melted down by a goldsmith who was stopped by a local clergyman. The bracteate was stolen in 1938 from the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities and has not yet been found.

The bracteate is believed to have been made about AD 500. In the middle of the bracteate is a four-legged animal with a man&#x27;s head above it, and in front of this a bird separated from the other images by a line. This image is commonly associated with the Norse god Odin in bracteate iconography. The bracteate is most famous for containing a full listing of the Elder Futhark runic alphabet. The runes in the futhark are divided by dots into three groups of eight runes which are commonly called &quot;ættir&quot;. The entire inscription reads:

:tuwatuwa; fuþarkgw; hnijïpzs; tbemlŋo[d]

The last rune (d) is hidden below the necklace holder piece that has been molded on top of the bracteate, but archaeologists know what it is because it is visible in a bracteate struck using the same die and found nearby in 1906, the Mariedamm bracteate, Nä 10, IK 377.2, which reads:

:(t)uwatuwa; fuþarkgw; hnijïpzs; tbemlŋod.

The first part of the inscription, &quot;tuwatuwa&quot;, is not yet understood but is assumed to be associated with magic; however, this is a stock explanation for runic text that has not yet been interpreted.

<text>CHBM-FM (97.3 FM) is a radio station in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station currently broadcasts a classic hits format branded as &quot;Boom 97.3&quot;. CHBM&#x27;s studios are located at Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue in Toronto&#x27;s Deer Park neighbourhood, while their transmitter is located atop the CN Tower. The station is owned by the Stingray Group.

The station&#x27;s playlist contains songs from the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, with a core focus on music released in the 1980s, while also playing select songs from the 1960s and early 2000s.

==History==
The station was launched at 9:00 a.m. on May 18, 1987, by Redmond Broadcasting, with the call letters CJEZ-FM, and carried an easy listening format under the branding &quot;Easy 97&quot;. Staff for the new station included many long-time Toronto personalities, such as Jay Nelson, Russ Thompson, Bill Anderson and Carl Banas.

In the early 1990s, it changed its moniker to &quot;Lite 97&quot;, but soon after, it changed its format to classic hits as &quot;Z97.3&quot;. In February 1995, Redmond sold the station to Telemedia and on June 30, at 5:30a.m., the station changed monikers to &quot;97.3 EZ Rock&quot;. The slogan was &quot;The Heartbeat of Toronto&quot;, and aired an adult contemporary format. &quot;EZ Rock&quot; launched with the intent of having an audience of mainly women ages 25–44, and the Toronto station became the flagship when several other stations owned by Telemedia at the time broadcasting a similar format also gained the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; branding.

In 2002, Standard Radio bought Telemedia and kept CJEZ under their ownership, while some of the other &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations were sold to either Rogers Communications or Astral Media. In October 2007, Astral Media purchased much of Standard&#x27;s assets, including CJEZ. In early 2009, the station became known as &quot;Today&#x27;s New 97.3 EZ Rock&quot;, pivoting to a hot adult contemporary-leaning direction. During November 2009, certain personalities from the station left. Throughout much of that time until December, CJEZ played nonstop Christmas music, while at the same time, asking their listeners what radio station they want to hear going forward.


===Boom 97.3 (2009–present)===
On December 24, 2009, during its standard Christmas music run during the holidays, the station&#x27;s website was changed completely by hosting only a countdown clock and a posted message urging listeners to tune in at 9 a.m. on December 26. At 6 a.m. that day, after playing EZ Rock&#x27;s final song (which was Christina Aguilera&#x27;s version of &quot;This Christmas&quot;), the station began stunting with a recorded message on how to &quot;view&quot; the launch of the new station.

Finally, at 9a.m., the station ended its 14-year run with AC, and flipped back to classic hits with the branding &quot;Boom 97.3, Toronto&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, adopting the &quot;Boom&quot; branding used by some of Astral&#x27;s small-market French-language stations in Quebec. The first song played on &quot;Boom&quot; was &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Believin&#x27;&quot; by Journey. CJEZ&#x27;s call letters were changed the following day to CHBM-FM. The station&#x27;s airstaff remained intact for a time, but in May 2011, Humble Howard and Colleen Rusholme were let go by the station.

In March 2013, the Competition Bureau approved a proposal by Bell Media to acquire Astral Media, under the condition that it divest itself of several television services and radio stations. Following the closure of the merger, CHBM was placed in a blind trust pending its eventual sale. On August 26, Newcap Radio announced it would acquire CHBM, along with three other former Astral stations and Bell Media&#x27;s CFXJ-FM, for $112 million. The deal was approved by the CRTC on March 19, and the sale closed on March 31.

<doc id="1302626" wikidata="Q906619" url="?curid=1302626" title="Dixie Dregs">
<text>Dixie Dregs is an American rock band from Augusta, Georgia. Formed in 1970, the band is known for instrumental music that fuses elements of rock, classical music, country, jazz and bluegrass into an eclectic sound that is difficult to categorize. Recognized for their virtuoso playing, the Dixie Dregs were identified with the southern rock, progressive rock and jazz fusion scenes of the 1970s.

In 1975, the band recorded their demo album &quot;The Great Spectacular&quot; and self-released it in the following year in a limited pressing. The demo soon garnered attention from record labels, including Capricorn Records, with whom the Dixie Dregs would sign in 1976, and three albums were released for the label: &quot;Free Fall&quot; (1977), &quot;What If&quot; (1978) and &quot;Night of the Living Dregs&quot; (1979); the latter album, which was split between studio and live recordings, was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, and each of the band&#x27;s next three albums would subsequently receive further Grammy nominations. 

After Capricorn declared bankruptcy in 1979, the band signed with Arista Records, releasing the album &quot;Dregs of the Earth&quot; in 1980. The following year, the band changed their name to The Dregs, releasing two albums under this name, &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot; (1981) and &quot;Industry Standard&quot; (1982), which was the only album by the band to feature vocals. The band disbanded in 1983. After reuniting in 1988, the Dixie Dregs released &quot;Full Circle&quot; in 1994, and the live albums &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Back Alive&quot; (1992) and &quot;California Screamin″&quot; (2000).

==History==
===Formation and early years===
Dixie Dregs evolved from an Augusta, Georgia, band called Dixie Grit, formed by Steve Morse and Andy West in 1970. The band featured Morse&#x27;s older brother Dave on drums, Frank Brittingham (guitar and vocals) and Johnny Carr (keyboards). Carr was later replaced by Mark Parrish. Shortly after Steve Morse&#x27;s enrollment at University of Miami&#x27;s School of Music in 1971, Dixie Grit was disbanded. Morse and West continued performing as a duo, calling themselves Dixie Dregs (the &quot;Dregs&quot; of &quot;Dixie Grit&quot;).

In 1973, Steve Morse (guitar), Andy West (bass), Allen Sloan (violin) and Bart Yarnal (drums) met while students at the University of Miami&#x27;s School of Music to play as Rock Ensemble II. West also attended Georgia State University for a year while studying cello and music theory and composition along with Parrish. Parrish remained at GSU during the academic school years only to return to Augusta, Georgia, during summer breaks - re-establishing the guitar/bass/keyboards/drums quartet with Morse, West, Parrish, and Gilbert Frayer (drums) performing as opening acts for concerts and headlining local gigs as Dixie Dregs.

During subsequent academic school years, the remaining members of the Dregs, including Andy West, returned to the University of Miami and Mark Parrish returned to Atlanta, Georgia, to complete his degree in music performance and composition at Georgia State University, under the study of William Masselos, with additional studies of electronic music at Columbia University in New York City under Alice Shields, a protégée of Wendy Carlos.

===First recording===
At the time, the University of Miami hosted a lively musical community, including future professional musicians Pat Metheny, Jaco Pastorius, Danny Gottlieb, T Lavitz and Bruce Hornsby. Rod Morgenstein was asked to fill in as drummer after a surfing accident disabled Yarnal. In 1974, during the school years at UofM, keyboardist Frank Josephs was added to their lineup. In 1975, the group&#x27;s first effort, &quot;The Great Spectacular&quot; (named by ex-&quot;Dixie Grit&quot; second guitarist and singer, Frank Brittingham) was recorded at the University. Approximately 1,000 copies of the original LP were pressed. The album was reissued in 1997 in CD form.

===Signed to Capricorn===
Based on the strength of a three-song demo and a tip from former Allman Brothers Band members Chuck Leavell and Twiggs Lyndon, Capricorn Records signed them in late 1976 to record their debut album &quot;Free Fall&quot; (1977). Steve Davidowski was the keyboardist on &quot;Free Fall&quot;. When Davidowski left to work with fiddler Vassar Clements, former Dixie Grit/Dixie Dregs keyboardist Mark Parrish rejoined the group later that year. The moderate success and critical acclaim of &quot;Free Fall&quot; led to their 1978 effort, &quot;What If&quot;, supported by their first tour with dates in New York, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and California.

Their third album, &quot;Night of the Living Dregs&quot; (featuring Morse, West, Sloan, Parrish, and Morgenstein), was released in April 1979, gaining the band their first Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, won that year by Paul McCartney&#x27;s band Wings. &quot;Night of the Living Dregs&quot; included studio recordings as well as compositions performed live and recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival on July 23, 1978. Ken Scott, The Beatles&#x27; and producer/arranger George Martin&#x27;s right-hand man and engineer, produced both Dixie Dregs albums, &quot;What If&quot; and &quot;Night of the Living Dregs&quot;.

===Switch to Arista===
In October 1979, Capricorn Records declared bankruptcy, and the band was signed by Arista Records in January 1980, to create three more albums. At that time, keyboardist Parrish left and was replaced by T Lavitz. Later that year, &quot;Dregs of the Earth&quot; (featuring Morse, West, Sloan, Lavitz, and Morgenstein) was released.

Parrish went on to play piano and keyboards for vocalists Andy Williams, Roberta Flack, Natalie Cole, Luther Vandross, Peabo Bryson, Celine Dion, Regina Belle, Deborah Gibson, Pat Boone and daughter Debby Boone, Glen Campbell and for guitarist Larry Coryell. He won an Angel Award as co-producer of a Christian album &quot;With Reverence&quot; by singer Charles Land where he arranged and played all the instrumental parts. He has also been musical director, conductor, and keyboard instrumentalist with the touring stage shows of &quot;Cats&quot;, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Nunsense&quot;, &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, and other Broadway stage shows.

===Name change===

For &quot;Unsung Heroes&quot;, released in 1981, the band changed their name to The Dregs in an effort to gain more commercial appeal. Violinist Sloan began pursuing a career in medicine at the Medical College of Georgia culminating in a residency in Anesthesiology and was subsequently replaced by Mark O&#x27;Connor, winner of Nashville&#x27;s Grand Masters Fiddle Championship for their 1982 release, &quot;Industry Standard&quot;. This album introduced vocals for the first time, as a further attempt to gain more airtime. Guest vocalists included the Doobie Brothers&#x27;s Patrick Simmons and Alex Ligertwood (Santana). &quot;Industry Standard&quot; provided the Dregs with another Grammy nomination for Best Rock/Jazz Instrumental Performance. The recent name change, vocal additions and a grueling touring schedule did nothing to improve sales, and in 1983, the members of The Dregs decided to disband the group, parting for individual projects.

===Reunion===
During the early 1980s, the British disc jockey Tommy Vance started using the Dixie Dregs track &quot;Take It Off the Top&quot; as his signature tune for the BBC radio show &quot;The Friday Rock Show&quot;.

In the late 1980s, the group reunited for a tour featuring former members Morse, Morgenstein (who was also playing with Winger), Lavitz, and Sloan. Their return was complemented by a &quot;Best Of&quot; release entitled &quot;Divided We Stand&quot; (1989). Bassist Dave LaRue completed the lineup for a seven date tour culminating in the 1992 live album &quot;Bring &#x27;em Back Alive&quot;, which garnered them a fifth Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in January 1993 - awarded to Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble for &quot;Little Wing&quot;. Violinist Jerry Goodman, of The Mahavishnu Orchestra fame, filled in for Sloan, who was frequently absent as a result of his busy medical career. They signed a deal with former label Capricorn Records for their first studio album in years entitled &quot;Full Circle&quot; in 1994.

===Today===
The Dregs to this day remain a loose collection of its former members, reuniting briefly for short tours and rare studio work. 1997&#x27;s releases were &quot;The Great Spectacular&quot; in April and &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents&quot; (originally recorded in 1979 for the King Biscuit radio show) in September. &quot;California Screamin&quot;&#x27; (2000) is a curious mix of live recordings from the performances at the Roxy Theatre in August 1999. This release features older compositions and covers of the Allman Brothers Band&#x27;s &quot;Jessica&quot;, and Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Peaches en Regalia&quot; (with Dweezil Zappa sharing guitar lead). &quot;20th Century Masters: The Best of the Dixie Dregs&quot; and the DVD &quot;Sects, Dregs and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; were released in 2002.

On July 3, 2017, Rod Morgenstein announced a reunion tour beginning February 2018 in a YouTube video for Rock, Roots, &amp; Blues - Live.

The first show of the reunion tour dubbed &quot;Dawn of the Dregs&quot; took place on February 28, 2018, in Clearwater, Florida. It featured the original lineup of Steve Morse (guitar), Andy West (bass), Rod Morgenstein (drums), Allen Sloan (violin), and Steve Davidowski (keyboards)

== Musical style ==

Dixie Dregs&#x27; performances consist entirely of instrumentals, with &quot;Industry Standard&quot; (1982) being the only album by the band to contain vocals. The band members are noted for their virtuoso playing, and Dixie Dregs&#x27; music incorporates elements of many genres, which makes the band&#x27;s sound difficult to singularly classify; they have been categorized as a jazz rock, instrumental rock, progressive rock or southern rock band. The band&#x27;s influences include The Allman Brothers Band and Mahavishnu Orchestra. &quot;The Boston Herald&quot; described the band&#x27;s music as a fusion of rock, jazz, country, and classical music. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; categorized Dixie Dregs&#x27; music as a fusion of jazz rock and country music. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; defined Dixie Dregs&#x27; music as being a fusion of bluegrass and classical music. &quot;The Times&quot; described Dixie Dregs&#x27; music as a fusion of progressive rock, heartland rock, and jazz.

<doc id="1302629" wikidata="Q1674087" url="?curid=1302629" title="Islam in Albania">
<text>Islam arrived in Albania mainly during the Ottoman period when the majority of Albanians over time converted to Islam under Ottoman rule. Following the Albanian National Awakening (Rilindja) tenets and the de-emphasis of religious tradition in Albania, all governments in the 20th century pursued a secularization policy, most aggressively under the People&#x27;s Socialist Republic of Albania, which actively persecuted Muslims. Due to this policy, Islam, as with all other faiths in the country, underwent radical changes. Decades of state atheism, which ended in 1991, brought a decline in the religious practice of all traditions. The post-communist period and the lifting of legal and other government restrictions on religion allowed Islam to revive through institutions that generated new infrastructure, literature, educational facilities, international transnational links and other social activities.

According to the 2023 census, there were 1,101,718 (45.86%) Sunni Muslims and 115,644 (4.81%) Bektashi Muslims the remaining population consisted of 201,530 (8.38%) Catholics, 173,645 (7.22%) Eastern Orthodox, 9,658 (0.4%) Evangelicals, 3 670 (0.15%) of other religions, 332,155 (13.82%) believers without denomination, 85,311 (3.55%) Atheists and 378,782 (15.76%) did not provide an answer. This represents a 22% decline of the faith since 1945.

== History ==
=== 13th century ===
Albania came into contact with Islam in the 13th century when Angevin expansion into Albania during the reign of Charles I Anjou was made possible in part by Muslim involvement. Lucera is located only about 240 km northwest of Brindisi, which was the main port of disembarkation. Charles claimed rights in Albania, as Manfred&#x27;s successor, since 1267 when the Treaty of Viterbo was drawn up. During the winter of 1271, the Angevin forces took Durrës. Within a year, Charles began to use the title &quot;rex Albaniae&quot;, a title that was later recognized by the king of Serbia and the tsar of Bulgaria.
In 1273 both Muslim and Christian contingents sailed across the Adriatic. In April 1273, a Muslim from Lucera named Leone was appointed captain of the Muslim forces in Durrës. A month later, Musa took Leone&#x27;s place as commander of 200 Muslims stationed &quot;in partibus Romaniae&quot;.
Although relations between the Church of Rome and Byzantium improved, Charles I of Anjou continued to send Muslim and Christian military forces to the east, towards Albania. The Muslim knight Salem, a regular army officer, led 300 Lucerians - archers and lancers - to Vlora, in 1275. In September of that year, Ibrahim became the captain of the Muslims of Durrës, who took the place of Musa. 
On 19 April 1279, Charles I ordered 53 of the best Muslim archers from Lucera to be selected by the Capitanata&#x27;s justiciary, Guy d&#x27;Allemagne, to go to Durrës. As usually happens in the recruitment process, the advice of Muslim military leaders was sought. Ibrahim had to approve the selections. Orders were given that Ibrahim could take four horses with him as he crossed from Brindisi to Durrës. Ibrahim served in Durrës again in the early 1280s, as did a man from Lucera, named Pietro Cristiano. One source identifies him as &quot;de... terra Lucerie Saracenorum&quot;, most likely a Christian convert from Islam.
The demand for Muslim carpenters and blacksmiths to build war machines in Albania was so great during the summer of 1280 that it threatened to exhaust the skilled workers&#x27; pool for the construction of forts on the Italian coast. In June 1280, the king ordered the archers of the Capitanata and the Land of Bari to send 60 Muslim archers, as well as carpenters, stonemasons and blacksmiths to Albania. The archers had to report to Hugues le Rousseau de Sully in Berat. 
In the fall of the same year, 200 archers from Lucera were sent to Vlora. At the beginning of December, 300 archers were stationed in Durrës. Angevin forces took part in the unsuccessful siege of Berat castle, and were repulsed by Byzantine forces.

=== Conversion and consolidation (15th–18th centuries) ===
Islam was first introduced to Albania in the 15th century after the Ottoman conquest of the area. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Albanians in large numbers converted to Islam. As Muslims, many Albanians attained important political and military positions within the Ottoman Empire and culturally contributed to the wider Muslim world.

=== National Awakening (19th and early 20th centuries) ===
By the 19th century, Albanians were divided into three religious groups. Catholic Albanians who had some Albanian ethno-linguistic expression in schooling and church due to Austro-Hungarian protection and Italian clerical patronage. Orthodox Albanians under the Patriarchate of Constantinople had liturgy and schooling in Greek and toward the late Ottoman period mainly identified with Greek national aspirations. Muslim Albanians during this period formed around 70% of the overall Balkan Albanian population in the Ottoman Empire with an estimated population of more than a million. With the rise of the Eastern Crisis, Muslim Albanians became torn between loyalties to the Ottoman state and the emerging Albanian nationalist movement. Islam, the Sultan and the Ottoman Empire were traditionally seen as synonymous in belonging to the wider Muslim community. the Albanian nationalist movement advocated self-determination and strived to achieve socio-political recognition of Albanians as a separate people and language within the state.

Wars and socio-political instability resulting in increasing identification with the Ottoman Empire amongst some Muslims within the Balkans during the late Ottoman period made the terms &quot;Muslim&quot; and &quot;Turk&quot; synonymous. In this context, Muslim Albanians of the era were conferred and received the term &quot;Turk&quot;, despite preferring to distance themselves from ethnic Turks. This practice has somewhat continued amongst Balkan Christian peoples in contemporary times who still refer to Muslim Albanians as &quot;Turks&quot;, &quot;Turco-Albanians&quot;, with often pejorative connotations and historic negative socio-political repercussions. These geo-political events nonetheless pushed Albanian nationalists, many Muslim, to distance themselves from the Ottomans, Islam and the then emerging pan-Islamic Ottomanism of Sultan Abdulhamid II. Another factor overlaying these concerns during the Albanian National Awakening (Rilindja) period were thoughts that Western powers would only favour Christian Balkan states and peoples in the &quot;anti Ottoman struggle&quot;. During this time Albanian nationalists conceived of Albanians as a European people who under Skanderbeg resisted the Ottoman Turks that later subjugated and cut the Albanians off from Western European civilisation. Albanian nationalism overall was a reaction to the gradual breakup of the Ottoman Empire and a response to Balkan and Christian national movements that posed a threat to an Albanian population that was mainly Muslim. Muslim (Bektashi) Albanians were heavily involved with the Albanian National Awakening producing many figures like Faik Konitza, Ismail Qemali, Midhat Frashëri, Shahin Kolonja and others advocating for Albanian interests and self-determination.

During the late Ottoman period, Muslims inhabited compactly the entire mountainous and hilly hinterland located north of the Himarë, Tepelenë, Këlcyrë and Frashëri line that encompasses most of the Vlorë, Tepelenë, Mallakastër, Skrapar, Tomorr and Dishnicë regions. There were intervening areas where Muslims lived alongside Albanian speaking Christians in mixed villages, towns and cities with either community forming a majority or minority of the population. In urban settlements Muslims were almost completely a majority in Tepelenë and Vlorë, a majority in Gjirokastër with a Christian minority, whereas Berat, Përmet and Delvinë had a Muslim majority with a large Christian minority. A Muslim population was also located in Konispol and some villages around the town. The Ottoman administrative sancaks or districts of Korçë and Gjirokastër in 1908 contained a Muslim population that numbered 95,000 in contrast to 128,000 Orthodox inhabitants. Apart from small and spread out numbers of Muslim Romani, Muslims in these areas that eventually came to constitute contemporary southern Albania were all Albanian speaking Muslims. In southern Albania during the late Ottoman period being Albanian was increasingly associated with Islam, while from the 1880s the emerging Albanian National Movement was viewed as an obstacle to Hellenism within the region. Some Orthodox Albanians began to affiliate with the Albanian National movement causing concern for Greece and they worked together with Muslim Albanians regarding shared social and geo-political Albanian interests and aims. In central and southern Albania, Muslim Albanian society was integrated into the Ottoman state. It was organised into a small elite class owning big feudal estates worked by a large peasant class, both Christian and Muslim though few other individuals were also employed in the military, business, as artisans and in other professions. While northern Albanian society was little integrated into the Ottoman world, it was instead organised through a tribal structure of clans (&quot;fis&quot;) of whom many were Catholic with others being Muslim residing in mountainous terrain that Ottomans often had difficulty in maintaining authority and control. When religious conflict occurred it was between clans of opposing faiths, while within the scope of clan affiliation, religious divisions were sidelined. Shkodër was inhabited by a Muslim majority with a sizable Catholic minority.

=== Independence ===
==== Balkan Wars (1912–13) and World War One (1914–18) ====
Realising that the collapse of Ottoman rule through military defeat in the Balkans was imminent, Albanians represented by Ismail Qemali declared Independence from the Ottoman Empire on 28 November 1912 in Vlorë. International recognition of Albanian independence entailed the imposition of a Christian monarch which alongside internal political power struggles generated a failed Muslim uprising (1914) in central Albania that sought to restore Ottoman rule. During World War one, northern, central and south-central Albania came under Austro-Hungarian occupation. In the census of 1916–18 conducted by Austro-Hungarian authorities, the results showed that Muslims in the regions of Dibër, Lumë and Gorë were over 80% of the population. In the western part of the mountainous areas, Shkodër and in the mountains east of the lake were areas that contained a large Muslim population. In central Albania, the area from the Mat region to the Shkumbini river mouth toward Kavajë encompassing the districts of Tiranë, Peqin, Kavajë and Elbasan the population was mainly Muslim. In the area of Berat Muslims were a majority population with an Orthodox minority, while south of Elbasan Muslims were a plurality alongside a significant Orthodox population. In the region of Gramsh Muslims were a majority except for two people and in the southern Peqin area only Muslims were present. Muslims also were a majority population in the Mallakastër region alongside a small Orthodox minority. The experience of World War One, concerns over being partitioned and loss of power made the Muslim Albanian population support Albanian nationalism and the territorial integrity of Albania. An understanding emerged between most Sunni and Bektashi Albanians that religious differences needed to be sidelined for national cohesiveness. Whereas an abandonment of pan-Muslim links abroad was viewed in the context of securing support internationally for and maintaining independence, though some Muslim Albanian clergy were against disavowing ties with the wider Muslim world.

==== Interwar period (1919–39): State interference and reforms ====
From the early days of interwar Albania and due to Albania&#x27;s heterogeneous religious makeup, Albania&#x27;s political leadership defined Albania as without an official religion. Muslim Albanians at that time formed around 70% of the total population of 800,000 and Albania was the only Muslim country in Europe. In the former Ottoman districts of Korçë and Gjirokastër forming southern Albania, the share of the Muslim population increased in 1923 to 109,000 in contrast to 114,000 Orthodox and by 1927, Muslims were 116,000 to 112,000 Orthodox. From 1920 until 1925, a four-member governing regency council from the four religious denominations (Sunni, Bektashi, Catholic, Orthodox) was appointed. Albanian secularist elites pushed for a &quot;reform of Islam&quot; as the process of Islamic religious institutions were nationalised and the state increasingly imposed its will upon them. At the first Islamic National Congress (1923) the criteria for delegates attending was that being a cleric was unimportant and instead &quot;patriots&quot; with a liberal outlook were favoured alongside some delegates being selected by the state. Government representatives were present at the congress. Following the government program of reforms, the Albanian Islamic congress in Tirana decided to deliberate and &quot;reform&quot; some Islamic traditional practices adopted from the Ottoman period with the reasoning of allowing Albanian society the opportunity to thrive. The measures adopted by the congress was a break with the Ottoman Caliphate and to establish local Muslim structures loyal to Albania, banning polygamy (most of the Muslim Albanian population was monogamous) and the mandatory wearing of veil (hijab) by women in public. A new form of prayer was also implemented (standing, instead of the traditional salat ritual).

As with the congress, the attitudes of Muslim clerics were during the interwar period monitored by the state who at times appointed and dismissed them at will. Amongst those were the abolition of Sharia law and replacement with Western law that made Muslims in Albania come under government control while the Quran was translated into Albanian and criticized for its inaccuracies. After prolonged debate amongst Albanian elites during the interwar era and increasing restrictions, the wearing of the veil in 1937 was banned in legislation by Zog. Throughout the interwar period, the Albanian intellectual elite often undermined and depreciated Sunni Islam, whereas Sufi Islam and its various orders experienced an important period of promising growth. After independence, ties amongst the wider Sufi Bektashi community in former Ottoman lands waned. The Bektashi order in 1922 at an assembly of 500 delegates renounced ties with Turkey. In 1925 the Bektashi Order whose headquarters were in Turkey moved to Tiranë to escape Atatürk&#x27;s secularising reforms and Albania would become the center of Bektashism where there were 260 tekes present. In 1929, the Bektashi order severed its ties with Sunnism and by 1937 Bektashi adherents formed around 27% of the Muslim population in Albania. Apart from Bektashis, there were other main Sufi orders present in Albania during the interwar period such as the Halvetis, Qadiris, Rufais and Tijaniyyah.

==== World War Two (1939–45) ====
On 7 April 1939, Italy headed by Benito Mussolini after prolonged interest and overarching sphere of influence during the interwar period invaded Albania. Of the Muslim Albanian population, the Italians attempted to gain their sympathies by proposing to build a large mosque in Rome, though the Vatican opposed this measure and nothing came of it in the end. The Italian occupiers also won Muslim Albanian sympathies by causing their working wages to rise. Mussolini&#x27;s son in law Count Ciano also replaced the leadership of the Sunni Muslim community, which had recognized the Italian regime in Albania with clergy that aligned with Italian interests, with an easily controlled &quot;Moslem Committee&quot; organization, and Fischer notes that &quot;the Moslem community at large accepted this change with little complaint&quot;. Most of the Bektashi order and its leadership were against the Italian occupation and remained an opposition group. Fischer suspects that the Italians eventually tired of the opposition of the Bektashi Order, and had its head, Nijaz Deda, murdered.

==== Communist period, state atheism and violent persecution (1945–91) ====
In the aftermath of World War Two, the communist regime came to power and Muslims, most from southern Albania, were represented from early on within the communist leadership group, such as leader Enver Hoxha (1908–1985), his deputy Mehmet Shehu (1913–1981) and others.
 Albanian society was still traditionally divided between four religious communities. In the Albanian census of 1945, Muslims were 72% of the population, 17.2% were Orthodox and 10% Catholic. The communist regime through Albanian Nationalism attempted to forge a national identity that transcended and eroded these religious and other differences with the aim of forming a unitary Albanian identity. Albanian communists viewed religion as a societal threat that undermined the cohesiveness of the nation. Within this context, religions like Islam were denounced as &quot;foreign&quot; and clergy such as Muslim muftis were criticised as being socially backward with the propensity to become &quot;agents&quot; of other states and undermine Albanian interests. The communist regime through policy destroyed the Muslim way of life and Islamic culture within Albania.

Inspired by Pashko Vasa&#x27;s late 19th century poem for the need to overcome religious differences through Albanian unity, Hoxha took the stanza &quot;the faith of the Albanians is Albanianism&quot; and implemented it literally as state policy. In 1967 therefore the communist regime declared Albania the only non-religious country in the world, banning all forms of religious practice in public. The Muslim Sunni and Bektashi clergy alongside their Catholic and Orthodox counterparts suffered severe persecution and to prevent a decentralisation of authority in Albania, many of their leaders were killed. Jumu&#x27;ah or communal Friday prayers in a mosque that involves a sermon afterwards were banned in Albania due to their revolutionary associations that posed a threat to the communist regime. People who still performed religious practices did so in secret, while others found out were persecuted and personal possession of religious literature such as the Quran forbidden. Amongst Bektashi adherents transmission of knowledge became limited to within few family circles that mainly resided in the countryside. Mosques became a target for Albanian communists who saw their continued existence as exerting an ideological presence in the minds of people. Through the demise of mosques and religion in general within Albania, the regime sought to alter and sever the social basis of religion that lay with traditional religious structures amongst the people and replace it with communism. Islamic buildings were hence appropriated by the communist state who often turned into them into gathering places, sports halls, warehouses, barns, restaurants, cultural centres and cinemas in an attempt to erase those links between religious buildings and people. In 1967 within the space of seven months, the communist regime destroyed 2,169 religious buildings and other monuments. Of those were some 530 tekes, turbes and dergah saint shrines that belonged mainly to the Bektashi order. 740 mosques were destroyed, some of which were prominent and architecturally important like the Kubelie Mosque in Kavajë, the Clock Mosque in Peqin and the two domed mosques in Elbasan dating from the 17th century. Of the roughly 1,127 Islamic buildings existing in Albania prior to the communists coming to power, only 50 mosques remained thereafter with most being in a state of disrepair.

=== Republic of Albania (1992 onward) ===
Following the wider trends for socio-political pluralism and freedom in Eastern Europe from communism, a series of fierce protests by Albanian society culminated with the communist regime collapsing after allowing two elections in 1991 and then 1992. Toward the end of the regime&#x27;s collapse, it had reluctantly allowed for limited religious expression to reemerge. In 1990 along with a Catholic church, the Lead mosque in Shkodër were both the first religious buildings reopened in Albania. Muslims, this time mainly from northern Albania such as Azem Hajdari (1963–1998) and Sali Berisha, who later served multiple terms as president and prime minister were prominent leaders in the movement for democratic change and between 1992 and 1997 people part of the Albanian government were mostly of a Muslim background. Areas that had been traditionally Muslim in Albania prior to 1967 reemerged in a post-communist context once again mainly as Muslim with its various internal complexities. Due in part to the deprivation and persecution experienced during the communist period, Muslims within Albania have showed strong support for democracy and its institutions including official Muslim religious organisations. Within this context Muslim Albanians have also supported the separation of religion from the state with faith being considered as a personal private matter. Today, Albania is a parliamentary secular state and with no official religion.
==== Revival of Sunni Islam ====

In the 1990s, Muslim Albanians placed their focus on restoring institutions, religious buildings and Islam as a faith in Albania that had overall been decimated by the communists. Hafiz Sabri Koçi, (1921–2004) an imam imprisoned by the communist regime and who led the first prayer service in Shkodër 1990 became the grand mufti of the Muslim Community of Albania. During this time the restoration of Islam in Albania appealed to older generations of Muslim Albanian adherents, those families with traditional clerical heredity and limited numbers of young school age people who wished to qualify and study abroad in Muslim countries. Most mosques and some madrassas destroyed and damaged during the communist era had by 1996 been either reconstructed or restored in former locations where they once stood before 1967 and in contemporary times there are 555 mosques. Muslim religious teachers and prayer leaders were also retrained abroad in Muslim states or in Albania. The Muslim Community of Albania is the main organisation overseeing Sunni Islam in Albania and during the 1990s, it received funding and technical support from abroad to reconstitute its influence within the country. Due to interwar and communist era legacies of weakening Islam within Albania and secularisation of the population, the revival of the faith has been somewhat difficult due to people in Albania knowing little about Islam and other religions. Emigration in a post-communist environment of Albanians, many Muslim, has also hindered the recovery of religion, its socio-religious structures and organisation in Albania. In contemporary times the Muslim community has found itself being a majority population that is within a socio-political and intellectual &quot;minority&quot; position with often being on the defensive. Political links also emerged in the 1990s from parts of the Sunni Albanian community with the then new Albanian political establishment of whom some themselves were Muslim Albanians. The Sunni community is recognised by the Albanian state and it administers most of the mosques while also viewed as the main representative of Muslims in the country. As such it interprets its position as safeguarding an Albanian specific version of Islam which follows on institutional and ideological models established during the post-Ottoman state-building period and have gradually gained the status of an Albanian tradition. There are a few prayer houses located throughout Albania and one mosque run by the Sufi Rifai order.

==== Sunni Islam, transnational links, education and administrative institutions ====
The Albanian Sunni Community has over time established links with overseas Muslims. Due to funding shortages in Albania these ties have been locally beneficial as they have mobilised resources of several well funded international Muslim organisations like the OIC which has allowed for the reestablishment of Muslim ritual and spiritual practices in Albania. Particular efforts have been directed toward spreading information about Islam in Albania through media, education and local community centres. Around 90% of the budget of the Albanian Muslim community came from foreign sources in the 1990s, though from 2009 after the signing of agreements, the Albanian government allocates funding from the state budget to the four main religions to cover administrative and other costs. Some of these oversees Muslim organisations and charities coming from Arab countries, Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia, and also the Muslim diaspora in Europe and America have at times exerted sway over the Muslim Albanian community resulting in competition between groups.

The Gülen movement based on Muslim values of Turkish preacher Fethullah Gülen also is present from 1992 onward and its institutions are viewed as a counterweight to more conservative Muslim organisations from Arab countries in Albania, especially in the early 1990s. Some 7 madrasas (Muslim colleges containing complementary religious instruction) were opened up in Albania by Arab NGO&#x27;s, although now 2 are administered by the Muslim Community and the Gülen movement runs 5 madrassas and other schools that are known for their high quality and mainly secular education based on Islamic ethics and principles. In April 2011, Bedër University, Albania&#x27;s first Muslim university was opened in Tiranë and is administered by the Gülen movement. The presence and influence of the Gülen movement in Albania has recently been a source of tension with the Turkish government headed by Recep Tayyip Erdogan since it has blamed the movement for attempting to destabilize Turkey. The main state run Turkish Muslim organisation Diyanet has funded and started construction of the Great Mosque of Tiranë in 2015. The mosque will be the Balkans largest with minarets 50 meters high and a dome of 30 meters built on a 10,000-square-meter parcel of land near Albania&#x27;s parliament building able to accommodate up to 4,500 worshipers. International assistance from oversees organisations such as the Turkish International Cooperation and Development Agency (TIKA) have also helped finance the restoration of Ottoman era mosques, of which only nine survived the communist dictatorship. In a post-communist environment the Muslim Community of Albania has been seeking from successive Albanian governments a return and restitution of properties and land confiscated by the communist regime though without much progress.

==== Revival of Sufi Islam ====

The Muslim Community of Albania in its statutes claims authority over all Muslim groups in Albania. Sufi Sunni Islam was the dominants form of Islam in Albania under the Ottomans However the traditional reliance on the establishment hierarchy and internal structures of the restoration of Sufi Islam, historically synonymous to Sunni Islam, has faced organisational problems in reestablishing and stabilising former systems of authority. That stood in contrast with the activities of local people who were quick to rebuild the destroyed tyrbes and other mausoleums of Sufi saints by the end of 1991. As Albanian migrants went abroad financial resources were sent back to fund other reconstruction projects of various Sufi shrines and tekkes. The Shia Bektashi order in the 1990s was only able to reopen 6 of its tekkes. the rest of Sufi orders are present in Albania such as the Rifais, Saidis, Halvetis, Qadiris and the Tijaniyah are Sunni and combined have 384 turbes, tekes, maqams and zawiyas. In post communist Albania competition between the Sufi orders has reemerged, though the Bektashi remain the largest, most dominant, have 138 tekes and have on occasion laid claims to Sufi shrines of other orders. The Bektashi as the main Sufi order within Albania have attempted to appeal to a younger, urban and also intellectual demographic and placing itself within the wider socio-political space.

====Bektashism====

The Bektashi order in Albania is a Shia Sufi order. They views themselves as the centre of a worldwide movement and have reconnected with various Turkish educational and Iran religious organisations emphasising their common links, something that other Sufi orders in Albania have done. Prominent among these have been Iranian Saadi Shriazi foundation who has funded numerous Bektashi cultural programs, while dervishes from the Bektashi have received educational training at the Theological faculty in Qom. The Bektashi though are selective of outside influence, with sometimes for example editing texts of Iranian Shia thinkers in Bektashi literature or borrowing from others. The Bektashi during most of the 1990s had no privileged links with the political establishment until 1997 when the Socialists came to power. Members from the then Albanian government, some with Bektashi heritage in the late 1990s onward have favoured Bektashism as a milder form of Islam for Albanian Islam and it playing a role as a conduit between Islam and Christianity. Bektashis also highlight and celebrate figures such as Naim Frashëri who was made an honorary &quot;baba&quot; because he was involved in the Albanian National Awakening and often referred to his Bektashi roots. Bektashis also use Shiite related iconography of Ali, the Battle of Karbala and other revered Muslim figures of Muhammad&#x27;s family that adorn the interiors of turbes and tekkes. The Bektashis have a few clerical training centres though no schools for religious instruction. The Ahmadiyya movement has also established recently a presence in Albania and owns one mosque in Tiranë, the Bejtyl Evel Mosque.

== Demographics ==
In 2011, a Pew Research Center population estimate in a global study based on growth rates put the percentage of Muslims in Albania at 82.1% (estimated number 2,601,000) However, a Gallup poll gave percentages of religious affiliations with only 43% Muslim, 19% Eastern Orthodox, 15% Catholic and 23% atheist or nonreligious. In the 2011 census the declared religious affiliation of the population was: 56.70% (1,587,608) Sunni Muslims, 2.09% (58,628) Bektashis, 10.03% (280,921) Catholics, 6.75% (188,992) Orthodox, 0.14% (3,797) Evangelists, 0.07% (1,919) other Christians, 5.49% (153,630) believers without denomination, 2.05% (69,995) Atheists, 13.79% (386,024) undeclared. Controversies surrounded the Albanian census (2011) over whether a religious affiliation option should be part of the count as people like some intellectuals in Albania feared that the results may make Albania appear &quot;too Muslim&quot; to Europe. From previous pre-communist highs of 69.3% (1937) and 72% (1947) the official census of 2011 was the first to count religious affiliation after an absence of many decades that showed the Albanian Muslim population to have decreased to 56.70%. The Muslim community of Albania objected to having the generic Muslim option split according to internal differentiation into categories such as Bektashi. The census results overall have been criticized by the Muslim community of Albania and they have estimated the number of all Muslims in Albania to be 70%. Owing to the large number of people in Albania not having declared a religion the census figures leave scope for other explanations and analyses of what is the actual religious composition of Albania.

=== Ethno-linguistic composition ===

Most Muslims in Albania are ethnic Albanians. There are however small though significant clusters of non-Albanian (speaking) Muslims in the country. The Romani minority in Albania are mostly Muslims and estimated to number some 50,000 to 95,000 located throughout Albania and often residing in major urban centres forming a significant minority population. The Romani community is often economically disadvantaged with at times facing socio-political discrimination and distance from wider Albanian society like for example little intermarriage or neighbourhood segregation. Within the Romani community there exist two main divisions: the Gabels who speak the Romani language and those who self identify as Jevgs that consider themselves separate from the Romani, speak Albanian and are somewhat integrated in Albania. The Romani in Albania were and are still known to be religiously syncretic often combining other elements of religions and nature in Islamic practices and pilgrimages to holy sites.

Other Muslim communities are of a Slavic linguistic background. In the north-eastern borderland region of Gorë, the Gorani community inhabits the villages of Zapod, Pakisht, Orçikël, Kosharisht, Cernalevë, Orgjost, Orshekë, Borje, Novosej and Shishtavec. In the central-eastern borderland region of Gollobordë, a Muslim Macedonian speaking community known as &quot;Gollobordas&quot; inhabits the villages of Ostren i Madh, Kojavec, Lejçan, Lladomericë, Ostren i Vogël, Orzhanovë, Radovesh, Tuçep, Pasinkë, Trebisht, Gjinovec, Klenjë, Vërnicë, Steblevë and three families in Sebisht. In Albania people from the Gollobordas community are considered Albanians instead of Macedonians, even by the Albanian state, and they are known to intermarry with Muslim Albanians and not with Orthodox Macedonians. Until the 1990s an Orthodox Macedonian minority who have since migrated used to live in some villages alongside the Gollobordas and the latter community in recent times numbers some roughly 3,000 people. The Bosniak community of the Shijak area whose presence dates back to 1875 inhabits almost entirely the village of Borakaj and in the neighbouring village Koxhas they live alongside Albanians and form a minority. Bosniaks from these settlements have also settled in Durrës, Shijak and in 1924 some went and settled in the village of Libofshë where they have mostly become linguistically assimilated. There is a small Muslim Montenegrin speaking community near Shkodër whose presence dates back to 1878 and are known as &quot;Podgoriçani&quot;, due to their origins from Podgorica in Montenegro. Podgoriçani inhabit the villages of Boriç i Madh where they form a majority alongside a few Orthodox Montenegrins and some Albanians, while they live compactly in both Shtoj i Vjetër with 30 families and in Shtoj i Ri with 17 families and some families in Shkodër city.

=== Ethno-cultural Albanian identity and Islam ===

Throughout the duration of the Communist regime, national Albanian identity was constructed as being irreligious and based upon a common unitary Albanian nationality. This widely spread ideal is still present, though challenged by religious differentiation between Muslim Albanians and Christians which exists at a local level. In a post communist environment, religious affiliation to either Muslim and Christian groups is viewed within the context of historical belonging (mainly patrilineal) and contemporary social organisation as cultural communities with religious practice playing a somewhat secondary to limited role. Some contemporary Muslim Albanians in Albania see themselves as being the &quot;purest&quot; Albanians. This view is based on the large contribution Muslim Albanians made to the National Awakening (Rilindja) and resistance to the geo-political aims of the Serbs. Some Muslim Albanians, meanwhile, view Islam as a force that maintained Albanian independence from Christian countries like Greece, Serbia and Italy, and united Albanians. Some Albanian Muslims also hold the view that unlike them, Christian Albanian communities of the Orthodox historically identified with the Greeks. Some Muslim Albanians often refer to Orthodox Albanians as &quot;Greeks&quot; and attribute to them pro-Greek sentiments, while Orthodox Albanians view Muslim Albanians as having historically collaborated and identified with the Ottomans thereby earning the epithet &quot;Turk&quot;. Some Muslim Albanians hold and have expressed negative views of Catholic Albanians, while some Catholic Albanians resent past political dominance held by Muslims in Albania and have expressed dislike of Islam and what they have interpreted to be its tenets, mores and values.

=== Islam and Interreligious relations ===

In rural areas in northern Albania and southern Albania, relations between Muslim Albanians and Catholic Albanians or Muslim Albanians with Orthodox Albanians vary and are often distant with both Muslim and Christian communities traditionally living in separate villages and or neighbourhoods, even within cities. Various pejoratives are in use today for different religious groups in Albanian, some based on the Ottoman system of classification: &quot;turk&quot;, &quot;tourko-alvanoi/Turco-Albanians&quot; (in Greek), &quot;muhamedan/followers of Muhammad&quot; for Muslim Albanians, &quot;kaur/infidel&quot;, &quot;kaur i derit/infidel pigs&quot;, for Orthodox Albanians, Catholic Albanians, Greeks, Vlachs and Orthodox Macedonians. Among Muslims in Albania the term used for their religious community is &quot;myslyman&quot; and the word &quot;turk&quot; is also used in a strictly religious sense to connote Muslim and not ethnic affiliation, while Christians also use the word &quot;kaur&quot; to at times refer to themselves. During the Albanian socio-political and economic crisis of 1997, religious differences did not play a role in the civil unrest that occurred, though the Orthodox Church in Albania at the time privately supported the downfall of the Berisha government made up mainly of Muslims. Over the years minor incidents between Muslim Albanians with Christian Albanians have occurred such as pig heads thrown into mosque courtyards, Catholic tombstones being knocked down, an Orthodox church in Shkodër being bombed and damage done to frescoes in a church in Voskopojë. An interreligious organisation called the &quot;Interreligious Council of Albania&quot; was created in 2009 by the four main faiths to foster religious coexistence in Albania.

In southern Albania, urban centres of central Albania and partially in northern Albania, the status of Christianity dominates in contrast to Islam which is viewed by some Muslim Albanians as a &quot;historic accident&quot;. A rejection of Islam has also been attributed to a divide that has opened up between older city dwellers and rural Muslim Albanian and somewhat conservative newcomers from the north-east to cities like Tiranë, where the latter are referred to pejoratively as &quot;Chechens&quot;. Some young Muslim Albanians educated in Islamic Universities abroad have viewed their role as defending Islam in the public sphere over issues such as wearing of the veil, organising themselves socially and criticised the Muslim Albanian establishment. Following the lead mainly of Albanian Christians obtaining visas for work into Greece there have been instances where Muslim Albanian migrants in Greece converted to Orthodoxy and changed their names into Christian Greek forms in order to be accepted into Greek society. Some other Muslim Albanians when emigrating have also converted to Catholicism and conversions in general to Christianity within Albania are associated with belonging and interpreted as being part of the West, its values and culture. A 2015 study estimated some 13,000 Christians exist in Albania who had converted from a Muslim background, though it is not clear to which Christian churches these people were affiliated. Among Albanians and in particular the young, religion is increasingly not seen as important. In a Pew research centre survey of Muslim Albanians in 2012, religion was important for only 15%, while 7% prayed, around 5% went to a mosque, 43% gave zakat (alms), 44% fasted during Ramadan and 72% expressed a belief in God and Muhammad. The same Pew survey also estimated that 65% of Albanian Muslims are non-denominational Muslims.

Despite occasional issues, Albania&#x27;s &quot;religious tolerance&quot; (&quot;tolerance fetare&quot;) and &quot;religious harmony&quot; (&quot;harmonia fetare&quot;) are viewed as part of a set of distinctly Albanian national ideals, and said to serve an important part in Albania&#x27;s civic framework where sectarian communities ideally set aside their difference and work together in the pursuit of national interest. Although considered a &quot;national myth&quot; by some, the &quot;Albanian example&quot; of interfaith tolerance and of tolerant laicism has been advocated as a model for the rest of the world by both Albanians and Western European and American commentators, including Pope Francis who praised Albania as a &quot;model for a world witnessing conflict in God&#x27;s name&quot; and Prime Minister Edi Rama, who marched with Christian and Muslim clergy on either side in a demonstration in response to religious motivated violence in Paris. Meanwhile, Albania&#x27;s &quot;example&quot; has also drawn interest recently in the West, where it has been used to argue that &quot;religious freedom and Islamic values not only can co-exist, but also can flourish together&quot;, and is seen as a positive argument in favor of accelerating Albania&#x27;s accession to the EU.

Interfaith marriages between Muslims and Christians are held to be &quot;common&quot; and &quot;unremarkable&quot; in Albania with little social repercussion, although there is little statistical data on their prevalence. During the communist period, it is known that during the period of 1950–1968, the rates of mixed marriages ranged from 1.6% in Shkodër, 4.3% in Gjirokastër to 15.5% among the textile workers in Tiranë. In the district of Shkodër they reached 5% in the year 1980.
Most Albanian Muslims nowadays approve of mixed marriages, with 77% approving of a son marrying outside of the faith, and 75% for a daughter, the highest rates of all Muslim nationalities surveyed by Pew at the time. Meanwhile, 12% of Albanian Muslims agreed that &quot;religious conflict is a big problem in Albania&quot;, though only 2% thought Christians were &quot;hostile&quot; to Muslims and 4% admitted that they thought Muslims were &quot;hostile&quot; to Christians. 79% of Albanian Muslims said all their close friends were also Muslim, the second lowest number (after Russia) in the survey.

== Religious observances, customs and culture ==
=== Holidays ===
In Albania a series of religious celebrations are held by the Muslim community. Two recognised by the state as official holidays are: 
Bajrami i Madh (Big Bayram, &quot;Eid al-Fitr&quot;) celebrated at the conclusion of Ramadan and Kurban Bajram (Bayram of the sacrifice) or Bajrami i Vogël (Small Bayram, &quot;Eid al-Adha&quot;) celebrated on 10 Dhu al-Hijjah. During the month of Ramadan practicing Sunni Muslims in Albania fast and 5 nights are held sacred and celebrated. These dates change per year as they follow the Muslim lunar calendar. In recent times during April Muhammad&#x27;s birthday is commemorated and the Muslim Community of Albania holds a concert in Tiranë. It is attended by Albanian political and Muslim religious establishment representatives alongside Albanian citizens, many non-practising Muslims. Other than the Sunni related celebrations, the Sufis such as the Bektashi have a series of holidays and observances. The Day of Sultan Novruz (&quot;Nowruz&quot;) on 22 March is an official holiday that celebrates the birth of Imam Ali. Ashura, a day commemorating the massacre at Karbala is also held and multiple local festivals in various areas, some also observed as pilgrimages are held throughout the year at Sufi saints tombs and shrines like that of Sari Salltëk in Krujë. Most prominent of these is the pilgrimage on 20–25 August to Mount Tomorr to commemorate and celebrate the Shi&#x27;ite saint Abbas Ali.

=== Food, dress, law and burials ===

In Albania Halal slaughter of animals and food is permitted, mainly available in the eateries of large urban centres and becoming popular among people who are practicing Sunni Muslims. No centralised organisation exists for Halal certification of food which is unavailable in Albanian state institutions like schools, army, hospitals and so on and people requesting Halal food in those places are usually sidelined. Muslim dress is not prohibited in Albania in public areas. Unofficial restrictions and regulations on religious clothing worn within public institutions in order to maintain the &quot;secular&quot; status of the state were upheld by principals of schools and others. Examples included within schools and universities whereby some young women wearing the hijab were expelled or told to remove it. These have eased especially after the Albanian government in 2011 backed away from proposed legislation that would have officially banned displays of religious symbols in schools. Religious Muslim law as with other religious law is not recognised by the Albanian courts. The Sunni Muslim Community of Albania however recognises &quot;nikah&quot; or religious Muslim marriage although not many people undertake marriage in this form. While chaplaincy though not officially recognised within state institutions, access to, religious advice and preaching in prisons is allowed to inmates while chaplains are banned in state schools. During the communist period Muslim Albanians were buried alongside Albanians of other faiths and due to that legacy in contemporary times separate Muslim graveyards are uncommon.

== Controversies ==

=== Debates about Islam and contemporary Albanian identity ===

Within the Balkans apart from the ethno-linguistic component of Albanian identity, Albania&#x27;s Orthodox neighbours also view it through religious terms. They refer to Albanians as a &quot;Muslim&quot; nation and as &quot;Muslim fundamentalists&quot;, which has placed the secular part of Albanian identity under strain.

Among Albanian intellectuals and other notable Albanians, many Muslim, this has generated much discussion and at times debates about Islam and its role within Albania and amongst Albanians as a whole in the Balkans. Within these discourses, controversial Orientalist and biological terminology has been used by some Albanian intellectuals when discussing Islam and Albanians.
Prominent in those discussions were written exchanges in newspaper articles and books between novelist Ismail Kadare of Gjirokastër and literary critic Rexhep Qosja, an Albanian from Kosovo in the mid-2000s. Kadare asserted that Albania&#x27;s future lay with Europe due to its ancient European roots, Christian traditions, and being a white people, while Qosja contended that Albanian identity was both a blend of Western (Christian) and Eastern (Islam) cultures and often adaptable to historical contexts. In a 2005 speech given in Britain by president Alfred Moisiu of Orthodox heritage, he referred to Islam in Albania as having a &quot;European face&quot;, it being &quot;shallow&quot; and that &quot;if you dig a bit in every Albanian, he can discover his Christian core&quot;. The Muslim Forum of Albania called those and Kadare&#x27;s comments &quot;racist&quot;, and charged that they contained &quot;Islamophobia&quot; and were &quot;deeply offensive&quot;. Following trends dating back from the Communist regime, the post-Communist Albanian political establishment continues to approach Islam as the faith of the Ottoman invader.
Islam and the Ottoman legacy has also been a topic of conversation among wider Albanian society. Islam and the Ottomans are viewed by many Albanians as the outcome of warfare, and Turkification and within those discourses Albania&#x27;s sociopolitical problems are attributed as the outcome of that legacy. In debates over Albanian school textbooks where some historians have asked for offensive content regarding Turks to be removed, some Christian Albanian historians countered angrily by referring to negative experiences of the Ottoman period and wanting Turkey to seek redress for the invasion of Albania and Islamisation of Albanians. Some members of the Muslim community, while deemphasizing the Ottoman past, have responded to these views by criticizing what they say is prejudice toward Islam. Others, like academic Olsi Jazexhi, have added that contemporary Albanian politicians akin to the Communists perceive &quot;Modernisation&quot; to mean &quot;De-Islamisation&quot;, making Muslim Albanians feel alienated from their Muslim traditions instead of celebrating them and embracing their Ottoman heritage. These views, however, are rare and often depicted as extremist in Albanian society.

Other debates, often in the media and occasionally heated, have been about public displays of Muslim practices, mosque construction in Albania, or local and international violent incidents and their relationship to Islam. Issues have also arisen over school textbooks and their inaccurate references of Islam such as describing Muhammad as God&#x27;s &quot;son&quot;, while other matters have been concerns over administrative delays for mosque construction and so on. Catholic and Orthodox Albanians hold concerns that any possible unification of Balkan areas populated by sizable numbers of Albanian Muslims to the country would lead to an increasing &quot;Muslimization&quot; of Albania. Muslim Albanians deemphasize the (Christian) religious heritage of two famous Albanian figures by viewing Skanderbeg as a defender of the nation, while Mother Teresa is acknowledged for her charitable works and both individuals are promoted as Albanian symbols of Europe and the West.

===Discrimination===
The school curriculum of Shkodra in northern Albania was criticized for diminishing the role of Muslims in the history of Albania. For example, &quot;out of over 30 famous writers, historical gures, actors named in [a] textbook, there is only one Muslim in the entire list.&quot; Similarly, in 2014, Professor of Sociology at the University of Tirana Enis Sulstarova performed a comparative study of school textbooks finding that tenets of the Christian faith were often presented as a historical fact, while aspects of the Muslim faith were rendered a &#x27;superstition.&#x27; The Deputy Chairman of the Albanian Muslim Community has accused the media in Albania of anti-Muslim bias, frequently calling individuals arrested as &#x27;jihadists&#x27; and &#x27;terrorists&#x27; before they have been sentenced and perpetuating a &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; narrative between Muslim Albanians and the rest of Europe. Legal experts noted a &quot;violation of legal procedures, and the application of psychological pressure on [detainees] and family members with medical conditions&quot; following the arrests of 150 people suspected of perpetrating the 2016 Balkans terrorism plot. The majority of those arrested had no connection to the incident and were promptly released, but authorities at the time &quot;did not present arrest warrants&quot; and questioned suspects without the presence of an attorney. On 7 August 2016, a Muslim woman wearing a headscarf was beaten on a bus and called a &quot;terrorist.&quot;

=== Religious establishment views of Islam in Albania ===

The official religious Christian and Muslim establishments and their clergy hold diverging views of the Ottoman period and conversion of Islam by Albanians. Both Catholic and the Orthodox clergy interpret the Ottoman era as a repressive one that contained anti-Christian discrimination and violence, while Islam is viewed as &quot;foreign&quot; challenging Albanian tradition and cohesion. The conversion to Islam by Albanians is viewed by both Catholic and Orthodox clergy as &quot;falsification&quot; of Albanian identity, though Albanian Muslims are interpreted as &quot;innocent victims&quot; of Islamisation. Albanian Sunni Muslim clergy however views the conversion of Albanians as a &quot;voluntary&quot; process, while sidelining religious controversies associated with the Ottoman era. Sufi Islam in Albania interprets the Ottoman era as promoting a distorted form of Islam that was corrupted within a Sunni Ottoman polity that persecuted them. Christian clergy consider Muslim Albanians as part of the wider Albanian nation and Muslim clergy do not express derision to people who did not become Muslim in Albania. Christian identities in Albania have been forged on being in a minority position, at times with experiences of discrimination they have had historically in relation to the Muslim majority. Meanwhile, Muslim clergy in Albania highlight the change of fortune the demise of the Ottoman Empire brought with the political empowerment of Balkan Christians making Muslims a religious minority in contemporary times within the Balkans.

=== Conservative Islam and Muslim fundamentalism ===

The Muslim Albanian community has also contended with increasing numbers of Christian charities and missionaries proselytizing (especially those of the Orthodox working often in tandem with official Greek policies) which has made a part of the Sunni Albanian leadership become more assertive and calling for Islam to be declared the official religion of Albania. These calls within the scope of political Islam have greatly waned after non-Muslim Albanians objected to those suggestions. The Muslim Community of Albania opposes the legalisation of same-sex marriages for LGBT communities in Albania, as do the Orthodox and Catholic Church leaders of the country too. Muslim fundamentalism has though become a concern for Albania and its backers amongst the international community. In the 1990s, small groups of militant Muslims took advantage of dysfunctional government, porous borders, corruption, weak laws and illegal activities occurring during Albania&#x27;s transition to democracy. These Muslim militants used Albania as a base for money laundering and as a transit route into the West with at times the assistance of corrupt government employees. There were claims by critics of the Albanian government that high-profile militants like Osama bin Laden passed through Albania while president Sali Berisha and head of Albanian intelligence Bashkim Gazidede had knowledge and assisted militants, though no credible evidence has emerged. Salafi and Wahhabi forms of Islam have also entered Albania and adherents have come mainly from among the young. As of March 2016, some 100 or so Albanians so far have left Albania to become foreign fighters by joining various fundamentalist Salafi jihadist groups involved in the ongoing civil wars of Syria and Iraq; 18 have died. In response to these events the Albanian government has cracked down with arrests of people associated with the few mosques suspected of radicalisation and recruitment.

=== Islam and Albanian geopolitical orientation ===
With the collapse of the isolationist communist regime, Albania&#x27;s geopolitical orientation between West and East and the role of Christianity and Islam became debated among Albanian intellectuals and its politicians. Within the context of nationalist discourses during the 1990s the governing Albanian Democratic Party regarding European aspirations stressed aspects of Catholicism and as some government members were Muslims made overtures to Islam to join international organisations like the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). In 1992 Albania became the only entirely European member of the OIC, generating intense controversy within Albania due to concerns that Albania might deviate from a secular and Western-aligned political direction. The Albanian government viewed membership in the OIC as being a bridge between the Muslim-Christian worlds and also as having a &quot;civilising mission&quot; role within the Islamic world due to the Western orientation of Albania. The government of Sali Berisha in the 1990s generated a Muslim network in Albania which was dismantled by Socialist Party (organizational heirs of the ultra-secularist Communists) when it came to power in 1997. By 1998–99 Albania&#x27;s OIC membership was suspended and temporarily withdrawn by prime-minister Fatos Nano who viewed it as inhibiting Albania&#x27;s European aspirations. In the post communist period different socio-political reactions have occurred by regional neighbours and international powers toward Albania and Muslim Albanians. For example, in the 1990s, Greece preferred and assisted Orthodox Albanian leaders like Fatos Nano in Albania over Muslim Albanian ones like Sali Berisha as they were seen as being friendlier to Greek interests. During the Kosovo crisis (1998–1999), the Albanian political establishment was concerned with Western public opinion viewing Albanians as &quot;Islamic&quot; due to Serbian government claims portraying the &quot;Kosovo Liberation Army&quot; (KLA) as interested in creating a Balkan Islamic state.

In a post-communist environment, Albania emerged as being generally supportive of the US. During the Kosovo War (1999) and ethnic cleansing of mostly Muslim Albanians by Orthodox Serbs alongside the subsequent refugee influx into the country, Albania&#x27;s status as an ally of the US was confirmed. Support for the USA has remained high at 95% in Muslim majority Albania in contrast to the rest of the Islamic world. Albania joined the NATO military alliance in 2009 which remains popular in the country especially due to its intervention in the Kosovo war and Albania has contributed troops to NATO led operations in Afghanistan. Within the wider Balkans Albania is considered to be the most pro-EU and pro-Western country in the region and, unlike its neighbours (except Kosovo), it has little to negligible support for Russia. Albania is an aspirant for European Union membership after formally submitting its application to join in 2009. Sentiments among the EU exist of viewing Albania as a mainly Muslim country cause concerns for the Albanian political establishment who promote an image of Western orientation for Euro-Atlantic integration, especially when overt displays of Muslim practice arise such as dress or rituals. State relations of Albania with Turkey are friendly and close, due to maintenance of close links with the Albanian diaspora in Turkey and strong Turkish sociopolitical, cultural, economic and military ties with Albania. Turkey has been supportive of Albanian geopolitical interests within the Balkans. In Gallup polls conducted in recent times Turkey is viewed as a &quot;friendly country&quot; by 73% of people in Albania. Albania has established political and economic ties with Arab countries, in particular with Arab Persian Gulf states who have heavily invested in religious, transport and other infrastructure alongside other facets of the economy in addition to the somewhat limited societal links they share. Albania is also working to develop socio-political and economic ties with Israel.

<text>Cheltenham West is an area in the western part of Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England. It is the generic name for an area which includes the council wards of Hesters Way, Springbank, Arle, Rowanfield, Alstone, Fiddlers Green, St Mark&#x27;s and some of St Peter&#x27;s and the Moors.

This area has a population of about 30,000 and includes large amounts of social housing.

==Retail==
Coronation Square shopping centre is at the centre of Cheltenham West and includes supermarkets, an optician, a dental practice, charity shops, betting shops and a variety of fast food outlets. After a number of years of decline, a regeneration programme for the shopping centre was started in 2013. More recent signs of new life include the opening of the Cheltenham Science Centre and innovative new business Create on the Square. There is also a public library with a GrowthHub satellite business hub.

==History==
Much of the area was originally built as a Wimpey no-fines council area in the 1950s and 1960s as part of a national initiative to increase housing post WW2. The houses provided accommodation for a variety of people, including those working for GCHQ, which arrived in 1952, and local engineering companies.
Changes that took place over the following thirty years adversely affected the area and reflected changes in society in general. Owner occupation, structural changes in the economy and the make up of the housing stock and subsequent housing allocations led to a concentration of relative poverty in this area of predominantly social housing.

The earliest use of the term “Cheltenham West” to describe the area was around 2016, when local volunteers established the Cheltenham West community website and newsletter. Prior to that, the area was often referred to as Hesters Way or West Cheltenham, both titles being geographically inaccurate, but also carrying the negative image historically associated with them.

==Regeneration==
Cheltenham West wards, particularly Hesters Way, have been the focus of regeneration since the 1990s, with projects like the Hesters Way Neighbourhood Project establishing resource and community centres.

In 2017, Cheltenham Borough Council and Cheltenham Borough Homes instigated a joint “Cheltenham West Vision” listening project. Local residents were invited to give their views on a new vision for the area. The Vision also consolidated the designation of “Cheltenham West” to describe the area.

In addition, several new private housing developments have been completed. The largest of these being on the site vacated by GCHQ, when it moved to its new site, also located in Hesters Way.

==India and Pakistan House==
India and Pakistan House were built February 1959: Two eight-storey blocks of flats approved for Hester&#x27;s Way providing 78 homes. They were heralded as monuments to modern architecture.

1960: The first residents move in.

July 1984: Cheltenham Borough Council carries out £100,000 of repairs to the outer cladding.

November 1989: India House residents complain lifts have been out of action for two weeks.

January 1993: More than 100 residents are evacuated after fire breaks out in Pakistan House.

December 1993: Tenants say the reputation of the flats has been tarred by vandalism, muggings and fears of fire.

July 2004: Council leaders vote to demolish India and Pakistan House.

November 2004: Fire breaks out in India House. The council unveils plans to turn the flats into bed and breakfast accommodation.

September 2005: The flats feature in two episodes of BBC1 drama Casualty .

January 2006: The flats are earmarked for demolition

Overall the blocks of flats were demolished due to the high crime and low maintenance of the blocks.
The demolition of several blocks of council flats (most recently &quot;Pakistan House&quot; and &quot;India House&quot;) which were derelict and deemed an eyesore. They are systematically being replaced by a mix of private and housing association houses and flats.

<text>Martin Gouge (c. 1360 – 25 November 1444), surnamed De Charpaigne, was a French chancellor.

He was born at Bourges about 1360. A canon of Bourges, in 1402 he became treasurer to John, duke of Berry, and in 1406 bishop of Chartres. He was arrested by John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, with the hapless Jean de Montaigu (1349-1409) in 1409, but was soon released and then banished. Attaching himself to Louis, the Dauphin of France, he became his chancellor, the king&#x27;s ambassador in Brittany, and a member of the grand council; and on 13 May 1415 he was transferred from the see of Chartres to the see of Clermont-Ferrand.

In May 1418, when the Burgundians re-entered Paris, he only escaped death at their hands by taking refuge in the Bastille. He then left Paris, but only to fall into the hands of his enemy, the Georges de la Trémoille, who imprisoned him in the castle of Sully. Rescued by the dauphin Charles, he was appointed chancellor of France on 3 February 1422.

He endeavoured to reconcile Burgundy and France, was a party to the selection of Arthur, earl of Richmond, as constable, but had to resign his chancellorship in favour of Regnault of Chartres; first from 25 March to 6 August 1425, and again when La Trémoille had supplanted Richmond. After the fall of La Trémoille in 1433 he returned to court, and exercised a powerful influence over affairs of state almost till his death, which took place at the castle of Beaulieu (Puy-de-Dôme) on 25 or 26 November 1444.

<text>CHAS-FM (100.5 MHz) is a radio station licensed to and serving Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada. Owned and operated by Rogers Radio, a division of Rogers Sports &amp; Media, the station broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format branded as &quot;Kiss 100.5&quot;.

== History ==
The station was originally launched by Highland Broadcasting on May 15, 1964 as CJIC-FM, a sister station to CJIC and CJIC-TV. In 1976, the stations briefly became the property of Huron Broadcasting, retained the television station but sold the radio stations to Gilder Broadcasting under concentration of media ownership rules. With the TV and radio stations no longer having common ownership, the radio stations adopted the new callsigns and signed on as CFYN (for the AM station) and CHAS on February 1, 1977.

The original on air schedule of CHAS included Berg Neuman from 6:00 - 10:00 a.m., CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morningside&quot; from 10:00 a.m. - noon, Brian W. Martin from noon - 2:00 p.m., Fred Edwards from 2:00 - 6:00 p.m., Tony Marziale from 6:00 – 10:00 p.m., CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The World at Ten&quot; and &quot;Mostly Music&quot; from 10:00 p.m. - midnight and &quot;The Incredible Rod Wayne&quot; from midnight – 6:00 a.m. The station dropped its CBC programming after CBSM was launched in 1981.

In 1985, CFYN and CHAS were sold to Telemedia. Telemedia refined the &quot;Beautiful Music&quot; format of CHAS, incorporating elements of the &quot;Music of Your Life&quot; format to create a hybrid that was targeted mainly at the 45 plus listener.

As the influence of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan&#x27;s WYSS attracted more of the Ontario audience, pressure to follow suit grew. CHAS evolved to a younger sound, moving the format to adult contemporary and adopting &quot;Lite 100.5&quot; as the station&#x27;s branding, later changing to &quot;Mix 100&quot;.

By the early 1990s, the Sault Ste. Marie area&#x27;s economic circumstances combined with diminishing audiences on both of the city&#x27;s Canadian commercial AM stations severely curtailed the profitability of Telemedia&#x27;s Soo radio operations, prompting Telemedia to enter into a local management agreement (LMA) with Pelmorex, retaining ownership of CHAS but giving Pelmorex the management rights; the companies&#x27; Sault AM signals (Telemedia&#x27;s CFYN and Pelmorex&#x27;s CKCY) would be turned off as part of the deal. The arrangement, one of the first LMAs in the Canadian radio industry, took effect on August 31, 1992, with CHAS moving into CJQM-FM&#x27;s studios at 642 Great Northern Road, where the two stations remain to this day. The deal also saw all but 3 CHAS staffers being laid off: Marlene Yanni would stay on as sales representative, while James Warner-Smith would become program director; Gino Cavallo was offered the news/sports director position, but instead accepted a public relations and play-by-play position with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds hockey club. Several former CKCY staffers would join CHAS, including Frank Raven, Scott Turnbull, the late John Campbell, John Murtha, the late Mitch Drolet and the late Dan Bonk.

CHAS continued to broadcast for the next seven years as &quot;Mix 100&quot;. Among the benchmarks of that time for the station, were reaching a weekly audience of 30,000 listeners and negotiating the broadcast rights for all Greyhounds home and away games away from the Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan-based WKNW.

In 1999, Telemedia bought CJQM from Pelmorex, assuming full control of both CJQM and CHAS. At this point, CHAS and 3 other Telemedia-owned stations in Northern Ontario adopted the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; format and branding patterned after Standard Broadcasting&#x27;s CJEZ-FM in Toronto. Standard Broadcasting would acquire several Telemedia-owned stations in 2002; CHAS and CJQM were among those stations, but they would be sold to Rogers Radio almost immediately.

On July 4, 2011, CHAS altered its musical format, keeping the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; branding but presenting a more contemporary version of its AC Mainstream Plus blend. With this shift, the station cancelled &#x27;The &quot;80&#x27;s Lunch&quot; program and &quot;Sunday at the &#x27;70s&quot;. &quot;Solid Gold Saturday Night&quot; was replaced by &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot;, a program featuring music from the 1970s to present. Scott Turnbull remains as host. The station also adopted a new logo as well as the positioning statement &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Music&quot;.

CHAS, as noted above, was one of four EZ Rock-branded stations owned and operated by Rogers Media, all of which are located in Northern Ontario (the others being CKGB-FM Timmins, CHUR-FM North Bay, and CJMX-FM Sudbury). With the June 2013 acquisition by Bell Media Radio of Astral Media, which owned the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; trademark in Canada, Rogers would seek new branding for all 4 of its EZ Rock stations; on August 29, 2013, CHAS and its &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations all adopted the &quot;Kiss&quot; branding, with no other discernible on-air changes.

As of the fall of 2019, CHAS-FM and the other &quot;KISS&quot; stations had returned to a mainstream adult contemporary direction with a playlist spanning the 1980s to today&#x27;s hits.

In 2020, CHAS changed its moniker to &quot;The New KiSS 100.5&quot;, but kept the same slogan and format. The station began carrying the &quot;Roz and Mocha Show&quot; from CKIS-FM Toronto which also airs on other Rogers-owned &quot;Kiss&quot; stations across Canada.

<text>CHUR-FM (100.5 MHz) is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format in North Bay, Ontario. The station uses the on-air brand &quot;KiSS 100.5&quot;.

==History==
The station was launched in 1984 by Gateway City Broadcasting, at 1110 AM. It was subsequently acquired in 1985 by Mid-Canada Radio, who also changed the station&#x27;s frequency to 840. In 1990, the station was acquired by the Pelmorex Radio Network.

Pelmorex converted the station to FM in 1994, and sold it to Telemedia in 1999. Under Telemedia&#x27;s ownership, the station adopted the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; brand.

In 2002, Telemedia was acquired by Standard Broadcasting, and CHUR was one of the stations sold by Standard to Rogers Radio.

In July 2010, the station altered its musical format to present a more contemporary version of its AC Mainstream Plus blend more in line with the Hot AC version of &quot;American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest&quot;. With this shift, the station cancelled &quot;The 80&#x27;s Lunch&quot; program and &quot;Sunday at the 70&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;Solid Gold Saturday Night&quot; was replaced by &quot;AT40&quot;. In July 2011, the station adopted a new logo as well as the slogan &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Music&quot;.

By January 2012, more hot adult contemporary and rhythmic contemporary hits were added to the playlist. The station also unveiled the HitStorm countdown, based out of Toronto&#x27;s CKIS-FM. In March 2012, all of the Rogers-owned &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations in Northern Ontario started to air the &quot;Top 20 Most Wanted&quot;, a countdown show produced by CJMX-FM in Sudbury. By June 2012, the station dropped the entire 1980s library and most pre-2000 music from its playlist, making it one of the few AC stations to not follow the adult contemporary pattern.

CHUR was one of four EZ Rock-branded stations owned and operated by Rogers Media, all of which are located in Northern Ontario (the others being CJMX-FM Sudbury, CHAS-FM Sault Ste. Marie, and CKGB-FM Timmins). On August 29, 2013, all four &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations rebranded to &quot;Kiss&quot;, discarding the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; branding now owned by Bell Media Radio.

In 2020, CHUR changed its moniker to &quot;The New KiSS 100.5&quot;, but kept the same slogan and format. The station began carrying the &quot;Roz and Mocha Show&quot; from CKIS-FM Toronto which also airs on other Rogers-owned &quot;Kiss&quot; stations across Canada.

<text>Wise Men of Gotham is the early name given to the people of the village of Gotham, Nottinghamshire, in allusion to an incident where they supposedly feigned idiocy to avoid a Royal visit.

==Legend==

The story goes that King John intended to travel through the neighbourhood. At that time in England, any road the king travelled on had to be made a public highway, but the people of Gotham did not want a public highway through their village. The villagers feigned imbecility when the royal messengers arrived. Wherever the messengers went, they saw the rustics engaged in some absurd task. Based on this report, John determined to have his hunting lodge elsewhere, and the wise men boasted, &quot;We ween there are more fools pass through Gotham than remain in it.&quot;

According to the 1874 edition of Blount&#x27;s &quot;Tenures of Land&quot;, King John&#x27;s messengers &quot;found some of the inhabitants engaged in endeavouring to drown an eel in a pool of water; some were employed in dragging carts upon a large barn, to shade the wood from the sun; others were tumbling their cheeses down a hill, that they might find their way to Nottingham for sale; and some were employed in hedging in a cuckoo which had perched upon an old bush which stood where the present one now stands; in short, they were all employed in some foolish way or other which convinced the king&#x27;s servants that it was a village of fools, whence arose the old adage, &quot;the wise men of Gotham&quot; or &quot;the fools of Gotham&quot;.

The &quot;Towneley Mysteries&quot; mentioned the &quot;foles of Gotham&quot; as early as the fifteenth century, and a collection of their jests was published in the sixteenth century under the title &quot;Merrie Tales of the Mad Men of Gotham, gathered together by A.B. of Phisicke Doctour&quot;. The &quot;A.B.&quot; was supposed to represent Andrew Borde or Boorde (1490?–1549), famous among other things for his wit, but he probably had nothing to do with the compilation.

==Similar stories==

The localizing of fools is common to most countries, and folklorists have a special term for this genre: &quot;blason populaire&quot;. 
There are many other reputed imbecile centres in Britain besides Gotham. Thus there are the people of Coggeshall, Essex; the &quot;carles&quot; of Austwick, Yorkshire; the &quot;gowks&quot; of Gordon, Berwickshire; and for many centuries the charge of folly has been made against silly Suffolk and Norfolk (&quot;Descriptio Norfolciensium&quot; about twelfth century, printed in Wright&#x27;s &quot;Early Mysteries and other Latin Poems&quot;).

In Germany, there are the &quot;Schildbürger&quot;, from the town of Schilda; in the Netherlands, the people of Kampen; in Bohemia, the people of Kocourkov; and in Moravia the people of Šimperk. There are also the Swedish Täljetokar from Södertälje and Kälkborgare from Kälkestad, and the Danish tell tales of the foolish inhabitants of Mols, while the Finnish talk of the Hölmöläiset and the Bembölebor. In Romania, Caracal is known as the place where &quot;the cart of fools tipped over&quot;. Among the ancient Greeks Boeotia and Cyme were the homes of fools; among the Thracians, Abdera; among the ancient Jews, Nazareth; among modern Jews (those in Europe anyway), Chełm; among the ancient Anatolians, Phrygia. 

In the United States, &quot;Florida Man&quot; is a memetic character, representing the supposed outlandishness of Florida and its residents. Its name comes from news article headlines reporting on unusual stories from Florida, frequently formatted as &quot;Florida Man does [x].&quot;

==Nursery rhyme==
The Wise Men of Gotham are recalled in a popular nursery rhyme with a Roud Folk Song Index number of 19695, an adaptation of the tale &quot;Three Sailors of Gotham&quot;. The lyrics are:

&lt;poem&gt;Three wise men of Gotham,
They went to sea in a bowl,
And if the bowl had been stronger
My song would have been longer.&lt;/poem&gt;

The rhyme was first recorded in &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot; published around 1765, and from then appeared in many collections.

==Legacy==
In Thomas Paine’s &quot;Rights of Man&quot; (1791) Paine asserts that Edmund Burke “puts the nation as fools on one side, and places his government of wisdom, all wise men of Gotham, on the other side.”

Reminded of the foolish ingenuity of Gotham&#x27;s residents, Washington Irving gave the name &quot;Gotham&quot; to New York City in his &quot;Salmagundi Papers&quot; (1807).

There is a passing reference to the wise men of Gotham in &quot;Lorna Doone&quot; (1869).

The most notable use of the name &quot;Gotham&quot; in popular culture was by Bill Finger in naming the home of Batman, Gotham City. In a story titled &quot;Cityscape&quot; in &quot;Batman Chronicles&quot; #6 (1996) it is revealed that Gotham was initially built for the purpose of housing the criminally insane, and Robin reads a journal that tells of how Gotham got its name: &quot;I even have a name for it. We could call it &#x27;Gotham&#x27; after a village in England – where, according to common belief, all are bereft of their wits.&quot; In DC Comics&#x27; &quot;The Batman of Arkham&quot; (2000) the Joker recites the &quot;Wise Men of Gotham&quot; rhyme specifically. The existence of Gotham, Nottinghamshire in the DC Universe was acknowledged in &quot;&quot; #206 (2006), and again in &quot;52&quot; #27 (2007), although the connection between two names &quot;within&quot; the DCU has not been fully explained. 

Responding to the connection between Gotham, Nottinghamshire and the name &quot;Gotham&quot; for New York City, Rudolph Giuliani, former mayor of New York, wrote that it was &quot;a pleasure to have this opportunity to acknowledge the cultural and historical link&quot; between the two places.

<text>CJMX-FM (105.3 MHz) is a Canadian radio station, which broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format in Sudbury, Ontario. The station uses the on-air brand &quot;KiSS 105.3&quot;. The station is owned by Rogers Radio, a division of Rogers Sports &amp; Media.

==History==

On April 12, 1979, the CRTC approved an application by the Sudbury Broadcasting Company Limited to operate a new English language FM radio station at Sudbury, Ontario on the frequency 105.3 MHz with an effective radiated power of 100,000 watts. 

CJMX was established on October 13, 1980 by F. Baxter Ricard and Alma Ricard, the owners of Sudbury&#x27;s CHNO and CFBR. CJMX&#x27;s studios were located in the old King George School building at 295 Victoria Street until 1997. Its transmitter site was shared with CICI-TV and CIGM-FM near Huron Street in Sudbury.

In the 1980s the station was branded as &quot;CJMX Stereo 105&quot; and &quot;FM 105 CJMX&quot;. The stations became part of Mid-Canada Radio in 1985, and were then sold to the Pelmorex Radio Network in 1990. Pelmorex&#x27;s ownership of the stations was controversial, as most of their programming was delivered by satellite from a facility in Mississauga. Under Pelmorex&#x27;s ownership, the station was branded as &quot;Mix 105&quot;, and aired a more hot adult contemporary format.

After a change in CRTC media ownership rules, Pelmorex sold CJMX to Telemedia, the owner of CJRQ and CIGM, in 1998. In late April 1999, shortly after the Telemedia purchase was finalized, CJMX dropped its hot AC format in favour of a soft AC format with the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; branding and moved from the 493B Barrydowne studios to 880 LaSalle Boulevard Telemedia studios to join with sister stations CIGM and CJRQ-FM. Prior to the change to &quot;EZ Rock&quot;, CJMX aired the syndicated countdown show &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40&quot; on Saturday afternoons from June 1998, until its last airing on February 13, 1999. The station had also aired satellite programming by Pelmorex radio. Pelmorex subsequently sold its other stations (CHNO and CHYC) in Sudbury to Haliburton Broadcasting Group.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, CJMX overtook former ratings leader CJRQ in the market, based in part on actively promoting itself as a station suitable for workplace listening. In 2006, however, it lost that status to a resurgent CHNO after the latter station flipped to an adult hits format. Telemedia was acquired by Standard Broadcasting in 2002, but Standard sold the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations in Northern Ontario to Rogers before the main acquisition had closed and received regulatory approval.

Under Rogers ownership in 2002, the station laid off several employees, including Dave Lindsay, afternoon drive time disc jockey and president of Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union Local 725-M, which represented staff at CJMX and CHNO. Lindsay was replaced in the shift by program director Mike Allard. It was alleged in the press that Lindsay may have been targeted as a union leader, and the layoff was contested; eventually, Lindsay returned to the afternoon shift.

In late October 2004, a fire damaged a transmission line at the transmitter that knocked CJMX off the air for 25 hours. A replacement antenna was brought in from Thunder Bay to get the station back on the air. The station went back to its regular 100 kW power months after the fire.

In 2009, CJMX&#x27;s sister station CIGM was sold to Newcap Broadcasting, then moved to the FM dial in August that same year.

In July 2011, the station altered its musical format to present a more contemporary version of its AC Mainstream Plus blend. With this shift, the station cancelled &quot;The 80&#x27;s Lunch&quot; program and &quot;Sunday at the 70&#x27;s&quot;. &quot;Solid Gold Saturday Night&quot; was replaced by &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot;, a program featuring music from the 70s to present. Scott Turnbull remains as host. The station also adopted a new logo as well as the positioning statement &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Music&quot;.

By January 2012, more hot adult contemporary and rhythmic contemporary hits were added to the playlist; however, the station is still a Canadian adult contemporary reporter per Mediabase &amp; Nielsen BDS. This was in order to compete up against CHR/Top 40 station CIGM-FM and lessen the competition with Newcap Broadcasting classic hits station CHNO-FM. The station also unveiled the &quot;HitStorm&quot; countdown, based out of Toronto&#x27;s CKIS-FM. In addition, most of the 80s hits were reduced, all pre-1979 hits faded and has also retained the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; branding. By June 2012, the station dropped the entire 80s library and most of pre-2000 music from its playlist, making it one of the few AC stations to not follow the adult contemporary pattern. On June 27, 2012, the station was moved to the Nielsen BDS Canadian hot AC panel, but Mediabase still reported the station on the Canadian AC panel (until July 20, 2012) and per parent Rogers Radio &amp; RadioStationWorld.com, still describes the station as an AC. Rival CHYC-FM airs a French hot AC format with some English hits mixed in.

On August 7, 2012, Rogers received approval to change the authorized contours of the radio programming undertakings CJRQ-FM and CJMX Sudbury, in order to change the polarization of CJRQ&#x27;s antenna, and to increase CJMX&#x27;s effective height of antenna above average terrain from 227.5 to 285 metres.

CJMX was one of four &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations owned and operated by Rogers Media, all of which are located in Northern Ontario (the others being CKGB-FM Timmins, CHUR-FM North Bay, and CHAS-FM Sault Ste. Marie). On August 29, 2013, all of the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations were rebranded to &quot;Kiss&quot;, discarding the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; branding owned by Bell Media.

On May 24, 2015, Rich Griffin, the morning host on CJMX died of a brain aneurysm at the age of 52. Griffin recently celebrated 14 years as a morning show host for CJMX in April. A moment of silence was held on all Sudbury radio stations at 9:00am EDT, May 25, 2015.

<text>CKGB-FM (99.3 MHz) is a Canadian radio station that broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format in Timmins, Ontario. The station uses the on-air brand &quot;KiSS 99.3&quot; and is owned by Rogers Radio, a division of Rogers Sports &amp; Media.

==History==
The station was launched in late 1933 by young Northern Ontario media entrepreneur Roy Thomson, who would later become the owner of &quot;The Times&quot; of London. Thomson acquired the &quot;Timmins Daily Press&quot; in 1934, and the newspaper and radio station shared a building and ownership for many years. In the 1940s and 1950s, CKGB was operating on 94.5 FM as CKRT-FM, until it was shut down. The station broadcast on AM from its inception, periodically changing frequencies until its last AM home at 750 in 1984, and adopting a country format in 1990. Coincidentally, Thompson hired Jack Kent Cooke to be a sales rep in the hungry 1930s. He went on to own the Los Angeles Kings hockey franchise. The station was an affiliate of CBC Radio&#x27;s Trans-Canada Network until 1962 and then the CBC Radio network. In 1984, CKGB was authorized to drop its CBC affiliation as network service was now available in the area from CBC-owned CBCJ-FM.

In 2001, the station received CRTC approval to move to the FM dial, retaining its legendary call letters as CKGB-FM but taking on the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; brand and adult contemporary format, giving the small Timmins radio market its first direct competition, as the Haliburton Broadcasting Group-owned CHMT-FM had launched as AC/CHR hybrid just a few months before. Less than a year after EZ Rock&#x27;s Timmins launch, CHMT flipped to fill the void in country radio as &quot;Moose FM&quot;.

In July 2011, the station altered its musical format to present a more contemporary version of its AC Mainstream Plus blend. With this shift, the station cancelled &quot;The &#x27;80s Lunch&quot; program and &quot;Sunday at the &#x27;70s&quot; &quot;Solid Gold Saturday Night&quot; was replaced by &quot;The Saturday Night Show&quot;, a program featuring music from the 1970s to present. Scott Turnbull remains as host. The station also adopted a new logo as well as the positioning statement, &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Music&quot;.

CKGB was one of four EZ Rock-branded stations owned and operated by Rogers Media, all of which are located in Northern Ontario (the others being CJMX-FM Sudbury, CHUR-FM North Bay, and CHAS-FM Sault Ste. Marie); as of July 2013, Rogers is in the process of rebranding all 4 stations, and is entertaining listener input through surveys on the stations&#x27; websites and through social media. On August 29, 2013, all &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations rebranded to &quot;Kiss&quot;, discarding the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; branding now owned by Bell Media.

In 2020, CKGB changed its moniker to &quot;The New KiSS 99.3&quot;, but kept the same slogan and format. The station began carrying the &quot;Roz and Mocha Show&quot; from CKIS-FM Toronto which also airs on other Rogers-owned &quot;Kiss&quot; stations across Canada.

==Contributions to Canadian Music==
Canadian country musician Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors recorded his first 45-RPM singles at the CKGB radio station in the mid-1960s. They were pressed by Quality Records in Toronto, and paid for (and sold) by Tom personally. Each of these singles features the CKGB logo.

<text>Cleostratus is a lunar impact crater near the northwest limb of the Moon. It lies to the northeast of the crater Xenophanes, and west-southwest of the prominent Pythagoras. From the Earth this crater appears highly elongated due to foreshortening.

The rim of this crater has become soft-shouldered due to steady impact erosion, and the formation is now just a depression in the surface surrounded by an eroded rise. A pair of small craters lie across the southwest rim, forming part of a short chain of craters leading to the west. Along the crest of the southern rim is a linear ridge. The satellite crater Cleostratus E is attached to the northwest rim, and intrudes slightly into the inner wall. The interior floor of this crater is flat and nearly featureless, having only a few tiny craterlets marking the surface.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cleostratus.

<doc id="1302648" wikidata="Q5324762" url="?curid=1302648" title="EZ Rock">
<text>EZ Rock was a brand of adult contemporary radio stations heard primarily in Canada. The branding was originally created by Telemedia in the mid-1990s for its AC stations, and based on the call sign of its former Toronto flagship CJEZ-FM (now adult hits-formatted CHBM-FM).

Via acquisitions, control of the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; brand passed from Telemedia to Astral Media and later Bell Media. By 2021, as the majority of its owned-and-operated stations had been shifted to one of Bell Media&#x27;s other standardized station formats, such as Pure Country, Move Radio (AC, which replaced Ontario&#x27;s final &quot;EZ Rock&quot; station CHRE-FM in St. Catharines, and Kelowna&#x27;s CILK-FM), or Virgin Radio (CHR/Top 40), the only remaining &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations were in British Columbia. On May 18, 2021, the final &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations flipped to adult hits under Bell&#x27;s &quot;Bounce Radio&quot; brand.

==History==

Ownership of the EZ Rock brand passed from Telemedia to Standard Broadcasting in 2002, to Astral Media in 2007, and to Bell Media in 2013.

On August 29, 2013, Rogers Media&#x27;s &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations in Northern Ontario switched to the company&#x27;s standard &quot;Kiss&quot; brand (heard primarily on CHR stations); these stations were former Standard stations that were acquired by Rogers in 2002.

As of January 2021, the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; branding was mostly heard on Bell Media-owned stations in British Columbia making it the last Canadian province to use the &quot;EZ Rock&quot; branding since the other stations have rebranded to Move Radio. On May 18, 2021, Bell flipped all remaining &quot;EZ Rock&quot; stations to its new adult hits branding &quot;Bounce Radio&quot;.

==Programming==
The EZ Rock stations were generally programmed independently, although special Canadian content versions of shows such as &quot;Delilah&quot; and the &quot;John Tesh Radio Show&quot; were heard across the network. Several marketing stations like London and St. Catharines also heard is &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot; and &quot;Rick Dees Weekly Top 40&quot; as well. Some stations in smaller markets may also share voice-tracked programming in weekend and overnight slots.

<doc id="1302659" wikidata="Q2143193" url="?curid=1302659" title="Joe Mullen">
<text>Joseph Patrick Mullen (born February 26, 1957) is an American former professional ice hockey player. He played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the St. Louis Blues, Calgary Flames, Pittsburgh Penguins and Boston Bruins between 1980 and 1997. He was a member of three Stanley Cup championship teams, winning with the Flames in 1989 and the Penguins in 1991 and 1992. Mullen turned to coaching in 2000, serving as an assistant in Pittsburgh and briefly as head coach of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. He was an assistant with the Philadelphia Flyers from 2007 to 2017.

An undrafted player, Mullen was an all-star for the Boston College Eagles before turning professional in the Blues&#x27; organization. He was named the Central Hockey League (CHL) rookie of the year in 1980 and most valuable player in 1981 as a member of the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. He won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most gentlemanly player on two occasions as a member of the Flames, as well as the NHL Plus-Minus Award. Mullen was named to the first All-Star team in 1988–89 and played in three NHL All-Star Games.

Mullen played with the United States National Team on several occasions, including three Canada Cup tournaments. He was the first American player to score 500 goals and to reach 1,000 points in his career. Mullen received the Lester Patrick Trophy in 1995 in recognition of his contributions to the sport in the United States. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998 and the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Early life==
Born February 26, 1957, in New York City, Mullen grew up in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan when it was controlled by Mickey Spillane (Last Gentleman Gangster). It was a rough neighborhood; Mullen later said that many of the people he grew up with fell into gangs and drug use, and several died before turning 21. He has three brothers, Ken, Tom Jr. and Brian, and a sister, Debbie.

The Mullen family lived less than a block from the old site of the third Madison Square Garden on Eighth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. Joe&#x27;s father Tom was a longtime employee on the ice and maintenance staffs at the current Garden. Joe and his brothers often hung around the arena with their father, taking old sticks to play with. He began playing roller hockey at the age of five, playing in a concrete schoolyard and using a sanded down roll of electrical tape as a puck. The boys&#x27; schoolyard games served as a partial inspiration for New York Rangers&#x27; general manager, Emile Francis, to create the Metropolitan Junior Hockey Association in 1966. Mullen did not learn to ice skate until he was ten years old, but at the age of 14 joined the Metropolitan association as one of the league&#x27;s youngest players. Mullen played four seasons in the league between 1971 and 1975. He scored 71 goals in 1973–74, then 182 points in 40 games the following season. Mullen&#x27;s 110 goals in 1974–75 was 52 more than his nearest competitor.

==Playing career==

===College===
Boston College offered Mullen a partial scholarship for the 1975–76 season to attend and play for the Eagles hockey program. He paid $700 out of his own pocket in the first year, but after scoring 34 points in 24 games as a freshman, the school gave him a full scholarship. Including tournament games, he led the Eagles in goals the following three seasons with 39, 38 and 30 respectively, and points in 1977–78 with 68 and in 1978–79 with 56. Mullen led the Eagles to the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) championship in 1977–78, and was named an all-star of the 1978 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) tournament. He scored a goal in the championship game, but the Eagles lost to cross-town rival Boston University, 5–3.

In four seasons with Boston College, Mullen set school records of 110 goals and 212 points (both subsequently broken). He was named to the All-ECAC, All-New England and NCAA All-American teams in 1978 and 1979. He won the Walter Brown Award in 1978 as the top American-born player in New England, and was the team captain in 1978–79. Boston College has twice honored Mullen; He was inducted into the school&#x27;s Varsity Club Hall of Fame in 1998, while the hockey program retired his jersey number 21 the following year.

===St. Louis Blues===
While Mullen had a successful college career, he went undrafted by any National Hockey League (NHL) team. His small stature, coupled with a general bias against American players at the time, especially from non-traditional development areas, contributed to his failure to be selected. However, he received interest as a free agent from several teams following graduation as well as the United States Olympic Team. He passed up the opportunity to play in the 1980 Winter Olympics and signed with the St. Louis Blues on August 16, 1979. The Blues assigned Mullen to their Central Hockey League (CHL) affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles for the 1979–80 season. In 75 games with the Golden Eagles, Mullen scored 40 goals and 72 points. He was named to the CHL&#x27;s second all-star team and was voted rookie of the year. He made his NHL debut in the 1980 Stanley Cup Playoffs, appearing in one game for the Blues.

Mullen returned to Salt Lake for the 1980–81 season where he scored 59 goals and led the league with 117 points. He was named to the first all-star team and won the CHL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award. Opening the 1981–82 season with Salt Lake, Mullen had 21 goals in 27 games before he was recalled to St. Louis. He scored his first two NHL goals on January 5, 1981, against the Minnesota North Stars. They came eight seconds apart and set a Blues&#x27; franchise record for fastest two goals by one player. Mullen scored 25 goals for the Blues that season and became the first player in history to score at least 20 goals in both the minor leagues and the NHL in the same season.

Injuries reduced Mullen to 49 games with the Blues in 1982–83, but he still scored 47 points. His 41 goals in 1983–84 set a record as the most scored by an American-born player in NHL history (broken by Bobby Carpenter the following season). He again reached the 40-goal plateau in 1984–85, and had 92 points total. He missed the first three days of the Blues&#x27; training camp prior to the 1985–86 season in a contract dispute before agreeing to a one-year deal. On February 1, 1986, the Blues dealt him to the Calgary Flames as part of a six player trade. Mullen went to Calgary, along with Terry Johnson and Rik Wilson, for Eddy Beers, Charlie Bourgeois and Gino Cavallini.

===Calgary Flames===
The Flames felt they needed a quality offensive player and expected Mullen to fulfill that role. As it was the first time in his career he had been traded, Mullen was initially upset at the move. He was awed by the reaction he received from fans in Calgary however; fans greeted him warmly even as his flight landed to arrive in the city. Mullen described the experience as being &quot;almost like ... an instant celebrity&quot;. He quickly established himself as a fan favorite, scoring 38 points in 29 games to end the regular season. He then led the league with 12 goals in the 1986 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Flames reached the Finals for the first time in franchise history, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games. Mullen set a personal best of 47 goals in his first full year in Calgary, 1986–87, and with only 14 penalty minutes on the season, was voted the winner of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the NHL&#x27;s most gentlemanly player.

Mullen&#x27;s 40 goals in 1987–88 was the fifth consecutive season he reached that total. He won his first of three consecutive Molson Cups as the Flames player with the most three star selections during the season. 1988–89 was Mullen&#x27;s best season in the NHL. He reached the 50 goal and 100 point milestones, leading the Flames with 51 and 110 respectively, and won his second Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. He was named a first-team All-Star at right wing and won the Plus-Minus Award at +51. Additionally, he played in his first NHL All-Star Game, appearing opposite his brother Brian. He led the 1989 Stanley Cup playoffs with 16 goals as the Flames defeated the Canadiens to win their first Stanley Cup championship.

Though he played in his second All-Star Game in 1990, Mullen&#x27;s production fell by 41 points, to 69, and he failed to score at least 40 goals for the first time in six seasons. Concerned about his age, the Flames chose to trade the 33-year-old Mullen following the season. He was sent to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a draft day trade on June 16, 1990, in exchange for Pittsburgh&#x27;s second round selection.

===Pittsburgh and Boston===
The move to Pittsburgh brought Mullen closer to his New York home and fulfilled his desire to raise his family in his native United States. He also appreciated that the Penguins felt he could aid their team. Penguins&#x27; head coach Bob Johnson, who had previously coached him in Calgary, influenced the team&#x27;s decision to acquire him. Mullen played only 47 games in 1990–91, scoring 17 goals and 39 points. He missed the last two months of the regular season after having surgery to remove a herniated disc in his back, an injury for which he could not identify a specific check or incident as the cause. He returned for the third game of the Penguins&#x27; Division Semifinals series against the New Jersey Devils, scoring a goal. Mullen finished the 1991 Stanley Cup playoffs with eight goals, including two in game six of the Finals, an 8–0 victory over the Minnesota North Stars that clinched Pittsburgh&#x27;s first Stanley Cup.

Healthy throughout the 1991–92 season, Mullen rebounded offensively to score 42 goals and 87 points in 77 games. Midway through the season, he became the first player in Penguins&#x27; history to have consecutive four-goal games, doing so against the New York Islanders on December 23, 1991, and the Toronto Maple Leafs three days later. He appeared in only nine playoff games, however, as he suffered a knee injury that required surgery to repair in the second game of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Division Final series against the New York Rangers. Mullen watched from the sidelines as the Penguins repeated as Stanley Cup champions.

Mullen tested free agency prior to the 1992–93 season, but ultimately chose to remain with the Penguins. He missed the first month of the season while recovering from his knee surgery, but finished the season with 33 goals and 70 points in 72 games. He added 6 points in 12 playoff games, but the Penguins&#x27; attempt at a third consecutive championship ended with a Division Final loss to the New York Islanders. A 38-goal season in 1993–94 led to Mullen&#x27;s third All-Star Game appearance. The game was a homecoming of sorts for Mullen, as it was played in Madison Square Garden.

In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, Mullen scored 37 points in 45 games. He scored the 1,000th point of his career with a pair of assists on February 7, 1995, in a 7–3 victory over the Florida Panthers. He left the Penguins following the season, signing a one-year contract as a free agent with the Boston Bruins. Mullen chose to wear number 11 with the Bruins as his usual number 7 had been retired by the Bruins in honor of Phil Esposito. He missed the majority of the season after requiring surgery for another herniated disc, then suffering a sprained medial collateral ligament. He appeared in only 37 games, scoring 15 points.

Mullen rejoined the Penguins for the 1996–97 season, signing a one-year contract. He appeared in 54 games and scored 22 points. He scored his 500th career goal on March 14, 1997, in a 6–3 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. He retired as a player following the season.

===International===
Mullen made his first appearance with the United States National Team following his graduation from Boston College. He appeared in eight games at the 1979 World Ice Hockey Championships, scoring seven goals and adding an assist for the seventh place Americans. He was a member of three Canada Cup teams, appearing at the 1984, 1987 and 1991 tournaments. He scored two goals in the 1991 tournament, both of which came in a 7–3 semi-final victory over Finland that led the United States into their first tournament final. The Americans settled for second place, however, after losing to Canada in the championship series.

At the age of 41, Mullen emerged from retirement to join the Americans for a qualifying tournament leading into the 1999 Men&#x27;s World Ice Hockey Championships. The United States had a disastrous 12th-place finish in the 1998 tournament, requiring them to go into a qualifying round to avoid relegation to the B division for 1999. As the qualifying tournament was played in November, American NHL players were not available. Mullen recorded three assists in three games, and helped the Americans stay in the top division for the 1999 tournament.

==Playing style==

Mullen arrived in the NHL possessing great balance on his skates, an ability his teammates and coaches believed he gained from playing roller hockey. His coaches praised his willingness to play in the difficult areas of the ice, even though he stood only five foot nine inches tall and knew he would have to take a hit to make a play. Penguins&#x27; play-by-play announcer Mike Lange nicknamed Mullen &quot;Slippery Rock Joe&quot; for his ability to evade opposing players.

The first American player in NHL history to score 500 goals and 1,000 points, Mullen&#x27;s career totals of 502 goals and 1,063 points stood as American records until surpassed by Mike Modano and Phil Housley, respectively. Along with his brother Brian, Mullen was named a recipient of the Lester Patrick Award in 1995 in recognition of his contributions to hockey in the United States. He was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame in 1998, the Pittsburgh Penguins Hall of Fame as well and two years later, to the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2011, the St. Louis Blues honored four players who wore uniform number 7 for their team. Mullen, Red Berenson, Garry Unger and Keith Tkachuk were each celebrated as part of the ceremony.

==Coaching career==
Mullen turned to coaching in 2000, joining the Penguins&#x27; staff as an assistant under Ivan Hlinka. He remained on the staff when Hlinka was fired one year later, under replacement Rick Kehoe, then Ed Olczyk. Mullen was removed from his role midway through the 2005–06 NHL season when the Penguins fired Olczyk and his entire staff. He was retained by the organization, however, and named interim head coach of the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins for the remainder of the American Hockey League (AHL) season. In 52 games, Mullen achieved a record of 28 wins, 16 losses, 3 ties and 5 overtime losses. The Penguins chose not to retain Mullen following the season. He moved to Pittsburgh&#x27;s cross-state rival, the Philadelphia Flyers, first as an assistant with the AHL&#x27;s Philadelphia Phantoms in 2006–07, then joining the NHL team in 2007. Mullen coached the team&#x27;s power play, and was a member of the staff when the team reached the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals. He remained on the Flyers&#x27; staff through the end of 2016–17 season.

==Personal life==
Mullen and his wife, Linda, have four children: sons Ryan, Michael and Patrick, and a daughter: Erin. Patrick is also a professional hockey player. He signed a contract with the Ottawa Senators organization for the 2013–14 season.

<doc id="1302663" wikidata="Q337028" url="?curid=1302663" title="Gir National Park">
<text>Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, also known as Sasan Gir, is a forest, national park, and wildlife sanctuary near Talala Gir in Gujarat, India. It is located north-east of Somnath, south-east of Junagadh and south-west of Amreli. It was established in 1965 in the erstwhile Nawab of Junagarh&#x27;s private hunting area, with a total area of , of which is fully protected as a national park and as wildlife sanctuary. It is part of the Khathiar-Gir dry deciduous forests ecoregion.

The 14th Asiatic Lion Census 2015 was conducted in May 2015. In 2015, the population was 523 (27% up compared to previous census in 2010). The population was 411 in 2010 and 359 in 2005. The lion population in Junagadh District was 268 individuals, 44 in Gir Somnath District, 174 in Amreli District, and 37 in Bhavnagar district. There are 109 males, 201 females and 213 cubs.

Gir National Park is closed from 16 June to 15 October every year, throughout the monsoon season.

== History ==
In the 19th century, the rulers of Indian princely states used to invite the British colonists for hunting expeditions. At the end of the 19th century, only about a dozen Asiatic lions were left in India, all of them in the Gir Forest, which was part of the Nawab of Junagarh&#x27;s private hunting grounds. British viceroys brought the drastic decline of the lion population in Gir to the attention of the Nawab of Junagadh, who established the sanctuary. Today, it is the only area in Asia where Asiatic lions occur and is considered one of the most important protected areas in Asia because of its biodiversity. The Gir ecosystem with its diverse flora and fauna is protected as a result of the efforts of the government forest department, wildlife activists and NGOs. It is now considered the jewel of Gujarat&#x27;s ecological resources.

== Geography ==
=== Water reserves ===

The seven major perennial rivers of the Gir region are Hiran, Shetrunji, Dhatarvadi, Shingoda, Machhundri, Ambajal and Raval Rivers. The four reservoirs of the area are at four dams, one each on Hiran, Machhundri, Raval and Shingoda rivers, including the biggest reservoir in the area, the &quot;Kamleshwar Dam&quot;, dubbed &#x27;the lifeline of Gir&#x27;.

During peak summer, surface water for wild animals is available at about 300 water points. When drought hits the area following poor rainfall, surface water is not available at a majority of these points, and water scarcity becomes a serious problem (mainly in the eastern part of the sanctuary). Ensuring the availability of water during peak summer is one of the major tasks of the Forest Department staff.

== Flora ==

More than 400 plant species were recorded in the survey of Gir forest by &quot;Samtapau &amp; Raizada&quot; in 1955. The botany department of M.S. University of Baroda has revised the count to 507 during their survey. According to the 1964 forest type classification by &quot;Champion &amp; Sheth&quot;, the Gir forest falls under &quot;5A/C-1a—very dry teak forest&quot; classification. Teak occurs mixed with dry deciduous species. The degradation stages (DS) sub-types are thus derived as:
# 5/DS1-Dry deciduous scrub forest and
# 5/DS1-Dry savannah forests (Locally known as &quot;vidis&quot;). It is the largest dry deciduous forest in western India.

Teak bearing areas are mainly in the eastern portion of the forest, which constitutes nearly half of the total area. Several species of acacia trees are found. Also found here are ber, jamun (&quot;Syzygium cumini&quot;), babul (acacia), flame of the forest, zizyphus, tendu and dhak. Also plants like karanj, umlo, amli, sirus, kalam, charal and an occasional Vad (banyan tree) are found. These broadleaf trees provide cool shade and moisture content to the region. As part of the afforestation programme, casuarina and prosopis have been planted along the borders of the Gir forest.

The forest is an important biological research area with considerable scientific, educational, aesthetic and recreational values. It provides nearly 5 million kilograms of green grass by annual harvesting, which is valued approximately at 500 million (US$7.12 million). The forest provides nearly 123,000 metric tons worth of fuel wood annually.

== Wildlife ==

The count of 2,375 distinct fauna species of Gir includes about 38 species of mammals, around 300 species of birds, 37 species of reptiles and more than 2,000 species of insects.

The carnivores group mainly comprises the Asiatic lion, Indian leopard, jungle cat, striped hyena, golden jackal, Bengal fox, Indian gray mongoose, ruddy mongoose, and honey badger. Asiatic wildcat and rusty-spotted cat occur, but are rarely seen.

The main herbivores of Gir are chital, nilgai, sambar, four-horned antelope, chinkara and wild boar. Blackbucks from the surrounding area are sometimes seen in the sanctuary.
Among the smaller mammals, porcupine and hare are common, but the pangolin is rare.

The reptiles are represented by the mugger crocodile, Indian cobra, tortoise and monitor lizard which inhabit the sanctuary&#x27;s bodies of water. Snakes are found in the bush and forest. Pythons are sighted at times along the stream banks. Gir has been used by the Gujarat State Forest Department which formed the Indian Crocodile Conservation Project in 1977 and released close to 1,000 marsh crocodiles into Lake Kamaleshwar and other small bodies of water in and around Gir.

The plentiful avifauna population has more than 300 species of birds, most of which are resident. The scavenger group of birds has six recorded species of vultures. Some of the typical species of Gir include crested serpent eagle, Bonelli&#x27;s eagle, changeable hawk-eagle, brown fish owl, Indian eagle-owl, rock bush-quail, Indian peafowl, brown-capped pygmy woodpecker, black-headed oriole, crested treeswift and Indian pitta. The Indian grey hornbill was not found from the last census of 2001.

=== Asiatic lion ===

The Asiatic lion&#x27;s habitat is dry scrub land and open deciduous forest. The lion population increased from 411 individuals in 2010 to 674 in 2020, and all of them live in or around Gir National Park.

In 1900 it was estimated that the population was as low as 100, and the Asiatic lion was declared a protected species. A census in 1936 recorded 289 animals. The first modern-day count of lions was done by Mark Alexander Wynter-Blyth, the principal of Rajkumar College, Rajkot and R.S. Dharmakumarsinhji sometime between 1948 and 1963; and a further survey, in 1968, recorded that since 1936 numbers had fallen to 162.

Even though the Gir Forest is well protected, there are instances of Asiatic lions being poached. They have also been poisoned in retaliation for attacking livestock. Some of the other threats include floods, fires and the possibility of epidemics and natural calamities. Gir nonetheless remains the most promising long-term preserve for them.

During a prolonged drought from 1899 to 1901, lions attacked livestock and people beyond the Gir Forest. After 1904, the rulers of Junagadh compensated livestock losses. Today, the lions in Gir National Park rarely attack people.

=== Lion conservation ===

The Lion Breeding Programme creates and maintains breeding centres. It also carries out studies of the behaviour of the Asiatic lions and also practices artificial insemination. One such centre has been established in the Sakkarbaug Zoo at the district headquarters of Junagadh, which has successfully bred about 180 lions. A total of 126 pure Asiatic lions have been given to zoos in India and abroad.

The census of lions takes place every five years. Previously indirect methods like using pugmarks of the lion were adopted for the count. However, during the census of April 2005 (which originally was scheduled for 2006, but was advanced following the reports and controversy over vanishing tigers in India), &quot;Block-Direct-Total Count&quot; method was employed with the help of around 1,000 forest officials, experts and volunteers. It means that only those lions were counted that were &quot;spotted&quot; visually. Use of &quot;live bait&quot; (a prey that is alive and used as a bait) for the exercise, though thought to be a traditional practice, was not used this time. The reason believed to be behind this is the Gujarat High Court ruling of 2000 against such a use of animals.

During the 2010 census &#x27;The Cat Women of Gir Forest&#x27; counted more than 411 lions in the park, and 523 in 2015. The women who do the counting are from traditional tribes in neighbouring villages. There are over 40 women van raksha sahayaks, who seek only to protect the animals of the park.

=== Ecological problems ===
Gir National Park and Sanctuary faces a number of threats to its ecosystem. Natural threats include recurrent drought, cyclones, and forest fires. Anthropogenic threats include over-grazing, encroachment, excessive traffic and resultant weed infestation. Tourism contributes to this environmental degradation, as does the mining carried out in the periphery. Pollution results from the railway lines that run through the peripheral zone. The narrow genetic base in the large mammals is also an issue of growing concern.

<text>Gaya (IAST: ) is a city, municipal corporation and the administrative headquarters of Gaya district and Magadh division of the Indian state of Bihar. Gaya is south of Patna and is the state&#x27;s second-largest city, with a population of 470,839. The city is surrounded on three sides by small, rocky hills (Mangla-Gauri, Shringa-Sthan, Ram-Shila, and Brahmayoni), with the Phalgu River on its eastern side.

It is a city of historical significance and is one of the major tourist attractions in India. Gaya is sanctified in the Jain, Hindu, and Buddhist religions. Gaya district is mentioned in the great epics, the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. It is the place where Rama, with Sita and Lakshmana, came to offer piṇḍadāna for their father, Dasharatha, and continues to be a major Hindu pilgrimage site for the piṇḍadāna ritual. Bodh Gaya, where Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment, is one of the four holy sites of Buddhism.

Gaya was chosen as one of twelve heritage cities to benefit from the Government of India&#x27;s four-year Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY) scheme for urban planning, economic growth and heritage conservation projects.

==Etymology==

Gaya is named after the demon &quot;Gayasura&quot; (meaning &quot;the demon Gaya&quot;) who dwelt the area during the Treta Yuga. According to Vayu Purana, Gaya was the name of a demon (Asura) whose body became pious after he performed strict penance and secured blessings from Lord Vishnu. It was said that the body of Gayasura was transformed into the series of rocky hills that make up the landscape of Gaya.

==History==

===Ancient history===
According to modern scholars, the Kikata kingdom from Rigvedic period was located at Gaya, Bihar.

Gaya is an ancient city, with a Buddhist documented history dating back to the 6th century BCE when the sage Gautama Buddha attained enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, from the modern city.

Even before this time, Gaya was a place of pilgrimage for people from around the world. The fame of ancient Gaya derived from the account in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; of the god Rama coming here to the banks of Phalgu River (called the Niranjana), accompanied by his wife and younger brother, to offer pind-daan for their father Dasharatha, for the moksha of his soul. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Gaya is referred to as Gayapuri.

Gaya flourished during the Maurya Empire (321–187 BCE), which ruled from the city of Pataliputra (adjacent to modern Patna) over an area that extended beyond the Indian subcontinent. During this period, Gaya witnessed the rise and fall of many dynasties in the Magadha region, where it occupied an important place in cultural history over some 2,400 years between the 6th century BCE and the 18th century CE.

The city&#x27;s cultural significance began with the dynasty founded by Sisunaga, who exercised power over Patna and Gaya around 600 BCE. Bimbisara, fifth king of the dynasty, who lived and ruled around 519 BCE, had projected Gaya to the outer world. Having attained an important place in the history of civilization, the area experienced the influence of Gautama Buddha and Bhagwan Mahavir during the reign of Bimbisara. After a brief period under the Nanda dynasty (345–321 BCE), Gaya and the entire Magadha region came under Mauryan rule. Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (272–232 BCE) embraced and promoted Buddhism. He visited Gaya, and built the first temple at Bodh Gaya to commemorate the Buddha&#x27;s attainment of supreme enlightenment.

The period of Hindu revivalism began with the Gupta Empire during the 4th and 5th centuries CE. Samudragupta of Magadha brought Gaya into the limelight, making it the capital of Bihar district during the Gupta empire.

In 750 CE, Gaya became a part of the Pala Empire, under the rule of its founder, Gopala. It is believed that the present temple of Bodh Gaya was built during the reign of Gopala&#x27;s son, Dharmapala.

In the 12th century CE, Gaya was invaded by Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji of the Ghaznavid Empire. By 1557, it had become part of the Mughal Empire, and remained under its power until the Battle of Buxar and the beginning of British rule in 1764. Gaya, along with other parts of the country, gained its independence in 1947.

===Modern history===
As attested by Francis Buchanan-Hamilton in the early nineteenth century, the city was divided into two areas: a sacred area in the southern part of the city, called Gaya; and the larger secular area, which may have been known by the Muslim community as Allahabad. During the British rule, the commercial and administrative area of the secular zone was formally named Saheb Ganj by British policy reformer Thomas Law, who was a district officer in Gaya in the late nineteenth century.

Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, founder of the All India Kisan Sabha peasant movement in 1936, established an ashram at Neyamatpur, Gaya, which later became the centre of the freedom struggle in Bihar. Many prominent leaders of the Indian National Congress visited frequently to meet Yadunandan (Jadunandan) Sharma when he was leader of Kisan Sabha, residing in the ashram set up by Swamiji.Yadunandan Sharma became the leader of the peasants of Gaya district and second-in-command to Swami Sahajanand Saraswati.

Gaya played a significant role in the Indian Independence Movement. From 26 to 31 December 1922, the 37th session of the Indian National Congress was held in Gaya under the presidency of Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das. It was attended by prominent leaders and luminaries of the Independence Movement, including Mohandas K. Gandhi, Rajendra Prasad, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad, Jawaharlal Nehru and Sri Krishna Sinha.

Gaya is the birthplace of eminent nationalist &quot;Bihar Vibhuti&quot;, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Bihar&#x27;s first deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister. Former Bihar Chief Minister Satyendra Narayan Sinha also hailed from Gaya. Ishwar Chaudhary, a member of the Fifth, Sixth and Ninth Lok Sabhas from 1971 to 1979 and from 1989 to 1991, represented the Gaya constituency of Bihar.

==Administration==
Until 1864, Gaya was a part of the district of Bihar and Ramgarh (now in the state of Jharkhand). It became a district of Bihar in its own right on 3 October 1865. In May 1981, the Bihar state government created the Magadh division, comprising the district of Gaya, along with Nawada, Aurangabad and Jehanabad, all of which had originally been sub-divisions when Gaya district was created. Aurangabad and Nawada were partitioned from the territory of Gaya in 1973; and Jehanabad in 1988. Gaya district occupies an area of 4,976 km2 (1,921-mile2).

Gaya Municipal Corporation (GMC) is the civic body that governs Gaya. GMC consists of democratically elected members, is headed by a mayor, who administer the city&#x27;s infrastructure, public services, and supplies. As of 2022, the corporation is headed by Birendra Kumar and Deputy mayor Chinta Devi.

==Culture==
===Pilgrimage===

The city of Gaya is a holy place of Hinduism, with a great number of Hindu deities represented in the engravings, paintings and carvings of its shrines. Of particular importance are the sites in the city associated with Vishnu, in particular the Phalgu River and the shrine Vishnupad Mandir, or Vishnupada, which is marked by a large footprint of Lord Vishnu engraved in a basalt block. Gaya is the location at which Rama, with Sita and Lakshmana, offered pind-daan for his father, Dasharatha. Gaya has since remained a site of key importance for the performance of the pind-daan ritual.

Gaya is considered to be one of the most ideal places to perform the Śrāddha. (A Śrāddha is the Hindu ritual that one performs to pay homage to one&#x27;s ancestors, especially to one&#x27;s dead parents). As per Hindu belief system, it is believed that a person goes to hell if he dies in the following circumstances - if he meets an accidental death, if he dies without his consecrations being performed, or if he is killed by a wild animal. But, if Śrāddha of that person are performed at Gaya then the soul of such a man will get rid of the tortures of the hell and will go to heaven. Performing Śrāddha here is of great importance as it helps one to get rid of &quot;pitra rinna&quot; i.e. debts towards one&#x27;s ancestors (male forefathers).

Nearby Bodh Gaya (&quot;Buddha Gaya&quot;), so named to distinguish it from the Hindu town centre of Gaya, is one of the four holiest sites of Buddhism and the site where the Buddha attained enlightenment.

===World Heritage Site at Bodh Gaya===

The Mahabodhi Temple Complex at Bodh Gaya was listed as a World Heritage Site by the World Heritage Committee of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) at its 26th session, on 26 June 2002.

The Mahabodhi Temple central to the complex was first built by the emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. The main part of the present structure dates from the 5th–6th centuries CE. It is one of the earliest and best-preserved Buddhist temples built entirely of brick dating from the later Gupta period. The Bodhi Tree (&quot;Ficus religiosa&quot;), the most important of the sacred places within the complex, is reputedly a descendant of the original tree under which Siddhārtha Gautama attained enlightenment and became the Buddha. Marking this seminal moment, Bodh Gaya is one of the four holiest pilgrimage sites of Buddhism, with Lumbini, Sarnath and Kushinagar.

The various structures on the site have undergone a number of restorations over the centuries. Ongoing maintenance and management is required to protect the complex which, as a major pilgrimage site, is under pressure due to large numbers of visitors. The site is under the responsibility of the state government of Bihar, and is managed by the Bodhgaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) and advisory board under the Bodh Gaya Temple Act, 1949.

<text>John Bartholomew Gough (August 22, 1817 – February 18, 1886) was a United States temperance orator.

==Biography==
He was born at Sandgate, Kent, England, and was educated by his mother, a schoolmistress. At the age of twelve, after his father died, he was sent to the United States to seek his fortune. He arrived in New York City in August 1829, and went to live for two years with family friends on a farm in Oneida County, New York in the western part of the state. He then entered a book-bindery in New York City to learn the trade. There in 1833 his mother and sister joined him, but after her death in 1835 he fell in with dissolute companions, and became a confirmed drunkard.

He lost his position, and for several years supported himself as a ballad singer and story-teller in the cheap theatres and concert-halls of New York and other eastern cities. He had always had a passion for the stage, and made one or two efforts to become an actor, but owing to his habits gained little favor. He married in 1839, and became a bookbinder on his own account. The effort to do his work without giving up his nightly dissipations so affected him that he was on the verge of delirium tremens. He lost his wife and child, and was reduced to the utmost misery.

Even this means of livelihood was being closed to him, when in Worcester, Massachusetts, in October 1842, a little kindness shown him by a Quaker induced him to attend a temperance meeting, and to sign a temperance pledge. After several lapses and a terrific struggle, he determined to devote his life to lecturing on behalf of temperance reform.

He set forth, carpet-bag in hand, to tramp through the New England states, glad to obtain even seventy-five cents for a temperance lecture, and soon became famous for his eloquence. An intense earnestness derived from experience, and his power of imitation and expression, enabled him to work on the sensibilities of his audiences. He was accustomed to mingle the pathetic and humorous in such a way as to attract thousands to hear him who had no purpose but to be interested and amused. In the first year of his travels, he spoke 386 times, and thenceforward for seventeen years he dealt only with temperance. During that period he addressed over 5,000 audiences.
He visited England in 1853, by invitation of the London Temperance League, was entertained by George Cruikshank, the veteran artist and total abstainer, and his first address, delivered at Exeter Hall, produced a great sensation. He intended to stay but six months, but was kept busy for two years. In 1854 he had undertaken to speak at Oxford, and the students had determined to prevent him. He was greeted with hisses, cat calls, and yells. But Gough had a disciplined temper and the courage of his convictions, and an appeal to the Briton&#x27;s proverbial love of fair play ended in his obtaining a hearing. On a subsequent visit, in 1878, he was received with distinguished attention by the Oxonians. He returned to the United States in 1855, and took up his old work with unabated success.

In 1857 he made another journey to England, and lectured for three years. In his temperance efforts, Gough always kept aloof from politics or any organized effort to accomplish results through legislation, relying entirely on moral influences and on the total abstinence pledge.

After confining his addresses to the subject of temperance for 17 years, he began to take up other subjects, literary and social, though from first to last his chief successes were obtained on the temperance platform. After his popularity had led him to vary his subject and to lecture before lyceums, he made a moderate fortune by his eloquence. His subjects were such as to give full scope to his powers of imitation, and to furnish opportunity to stir the feelings. &quot;Eloquence and Orators&quot; and &quot;Peculiar People&quot; were topics of this kind, in which diverting imitations played a prominent part. But he rarely failed to introduce some reference to the evils of intemperance. His oratory was not acquired, but natural. He had no elocutionary training, his reading was singularly restricted, and all his resources were from within. Yet he never failed to hold the attention of his audiences.

He continued his work until the end of his life. For several years, he made his home at Boylston, Massachusetts. He died at his work, being stricken with apoplexy on the lecture platform in the 1st Presbyterian Church of Frankford, Philadelphia, where he died two days later. He is buried at Hope Cemetery in Worcester, Massachusetts.

==Honors==
Gough Street in San Francisco, California was named for him.

==Works==
*&quot;Autobiography&quot; (London, 1846; 3d ed., 1853)

Some of his publications have been translated into French, Dutch, Scandinavian, and Tamil. One of his stories (&quot;The Pilot&quot;), based upon an anonymously published story &quot;The Helmsman of Lake Erie&quot;, caused Horatio Alger to write the ballad &quot;John Maynard&quot;. Gough or Alger, perhaps both, were the source for Theodor Fontane&#x27;s ballad &quot;John Maynard&quot; which remains to this day popular in German speaking countries.

<text>Paul Alexander Baran (; 25 August 1909 – 26 March 1964) was an American Marxist economist. In 1951, Baran was promoted to full professor at Stanford University. He was the only tenured Marxian economist in the United States until his death in 1964. He wrote &quot;The Political Economy of Growth&quot; in 1957 and co-authored &quot;Monopoly Capital&quot; with Paul Sweezy.

==Life and work==
Baran was born in Mykolaiv, Imperial Russia. His father, a Menshevik, left Russia for Vilnius, Lithuania in 1917. From Vilna the Baran family moved to Berlin, and then, in 1925 back to Moscow, but Paul stayed in Germany to finish his secondary school. In 1926 he attended the Plekhanov Institute in Moscow. He left again for Germany in 1928 accepting an appointment as an assistant on agricultural research with his advisor, Dr. Friedrich Pollock. Baran remained in Germany associated with the Frankfurt School Institute for Social Research. He received the Diplom-Volkswirt (graduate degree in political economy, equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree) in 1931 from the Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelm University of Breslau. He next wrote a dissertation under Emil Lederer on economic planning, and received his PhD from the University of Berlin in 1933. During these years in Germany, he met Rudolf Hilferding, author of &quot;Finance Capital&quot; and wrote under the pen name of Alexander Gabriel for the German Social Democratic Party journal &quot;Die Gesellschaft&quot;.

After the Nazi regime took power, Baran fled to Paris and then back to the USSR, and then to Vilnius, Lithuania. With the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and just before the Nazi invasion of Poland he emigrated to the US, where he enrolled at Harvard and received a master&#x27;s degree. Short of funds, he left the PhD program and worked for the Brookings Institution and then for the Office of Price Administration and then the Office of Strategic Services. He worked under John Kenneth Galbraith at the Strategic Bombing Survey traveling to post-war Germany and Japan. Baran then worked for the United States Department of Commerce and lectured at George Washington University. He then worked for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York before resigning to join academia.

He married Elena Djatschenko, had a son Nicholas but soon divorced. Baran had his academic career in the United States, teaching at Stanford University from 1949. From 1949, he was an active participant in the formulation of editorial ideas and opinions in &quot;Monthly Review&quot; magazine edited by Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman. Baran visited Cuba in 1960 along with Sweezy and Huberman, and was greatly inspired. In 1962 he revisited Moscow, Iran, and Yugoslavia. In his last years he worked on &quot;Monopoly Capital&quot; with Sweezy. He died from a heart attack in 1964 before it was completed by Sweezy. He is associated with the Neo-Marxian economics.

Baran introduced the concept of &quot;economic surplus&quot; to deal with novel complexities raised by the dominance of monopoly capital. With Paul Sweezy, Baran elaborated the importance of this innovation, its consistency with Marx&#x27;s labor concept of value, and supplementary relation to Marx&#x27;s category of surplus value. Monthly Review has recently published a book of correspondence between Sweezy and Baran, which illuminates the development of their ideas on political economy, and in particular, their collaboration in writing their seminal work, &quot;Monopoly Capital&quot;. See &quot;The Age of Monopoly Capital, The Selected Correspondence of Paul A. Baran and Paul M. Sweezy, 1949–1964&quot;, edited by Nicholas Baran and John Bellamy Foster, Monthly Review Press, New York, 2017.

According to Baran&#x27;s categories, &quot;Actual economic surplus&quot; is &quot;the difference between society&#x27;s actual current output and its actual current consumption,&quot; and hence is equal to current savings or accumulation. Potential economic surplus,&quot; in contrast, is &quot;the difference between that output that could be produced in a given natural and technical environment with the help of employable productive resources, and what might be regarded as essential consumption.&quot; Baran also introduced the concept of &quot;planned surplus&quot;—a category that could only be operationalized in a rationally planned socialist society. This was defined as &quot;the difference between society&#x27;s &#x27;optimum&#x27; output available in a historically given natural and technological environment under conditions of planned &#x27;optimal&#x27; utilization of all available productive resources, and some chosen &#x27;optimal&#x27; volume of consumption.&quot;

Baran used the surplus concept to analyze underdeveloped economies in his &quot;The Political Economy of Growth&quot;. Baran with Paul M. Sweezy applied the surplus concept to the contemporary US economy in &quot;Monopoly Capital&quot;.

Notable among Baran&#x27;s students was Richard D. Wolff.

<text>Samyukta Socialist Party (; SSP), was a political party in India from 1964 to 1974. SSP was formed through a split in the Praja Socialist Party (PSP) in 1964. In 1965, Ram Manohar Lohia merged his Socialist Party (Lohia) with SSP and contested in 1967 Indian general election. In 1972, SSP was reunited with PSP, forming the Socialist Party. But in December 1972, SSP was recreated after the split in Socialist Party. One faction of SSP led by Madhu Limaye and George Fernandes wanted to merge with PSP but another faction led by Raj Narain resisted the merger with PSP.

The General Secretary of the SSP from 1969 to 1971 was George Fernandes.

The Party President of the SSP from 1964 to 1971 was Anantram Jaiswal.

The SSP merged with Charan Singh&#x27;s Bharatiya Kranti Dal, Swatantra Party and Utkal Congress to form Bharatiya Lok Dal.

<text>Bharatiya Lok Dal () was a political party in India. The BLD or simply BL was formed at the end of 1974 through the fusion of seven parties opposed to the rule of Indira Gandhi, including the Swatantra Party, the Samyukta Socialist Party, the Utkal Congress and the Bharatiya Kranti Dal. The leader of the BLD was Charan Singh.

==History==
In 1977, the BLD combined with the Jan Sangh and the Indian National Congress (Organization) to form the Janata Party. The newly formed Janata Party contested the 1977 elections on the BLD symbol and formed independent India&#x27;s first government not ruled by the Indian National Congress.

Despite a strong start, the Janata government began to wither as significant ideological and political divisions emerged. Through 1979, support for Morarji Desai had declined considerably due to worsening economic conditions as well as the emergence of allegations of nepotism and corruption involving members of his family. Protesting Desai&#x27;s leadership, Charan Singh resigned and withdrew the support of his BLD. Desai also lost the support of the secular and socialist politicians in the party, who saw him as favoring the Hindu nationalist BJS. On 19 July 1979 Desai resigned from the government. Dissidents projected Charan Singh as the new prime minister in place of Desai.

President Reddy appointed Charan Singh as the Prime Minister of a minority government on the strength of 64 MPs, calling upon him to form a new government and prove his majority. The departure of Desai and the BJS had considerably diminished Janata&#x27;s majority, and numerous Janata MPs refused to support Charan Singh. MPs loyal to Jagjivan Ram withdrew themselves from the Janata party. Former allies such as the DMK, Shiromani Akali Dal and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had distanced themselves from the Janata party. Desperately seeking enough support for a majority, Charan Singh even sought to negotiate with Congress (I), which refused. After only three weeks in office, Charan Singh resigned. With no other political party in position to establish a majority government, President Reddy dissolved the Parliament and called fresh elections for January 1980.

After 1980 elections, Charan Singh came out of the Janata Alliance with his party and renamed it as Lok Dal.

Subsequently, Ajit Singh (son of Charan Singh) founded the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). Now Lok Dal is led by Chaudhary Sunil Singh of Aligarh.

<doc id="1302677" wikidata="Q7237613" url="?curid=1302677" title="Pragati Legislature Party">
<text>The Pragati Legislature Party(Also called Pragati Dal) was a political grouping in the Legislative Assembly of the Indian state Orissa. PLP was formed in 1973 by the Utkal Congress, Swatantra Party and others. The PLP leader Biju Patnaik, was elected as the Leader of the Opposition of the Assembly on 9 February 1973. His tenure as Leader of Opposition lasted until 3 March the same year. On that date President&#x27;s Rule was introduced in the state.

PLP and its member organizations later merged into Bharatiya Lok Dal in the end of 1974.

==Background==

Politics in early 70&#x27;s Orissa was very fluid. The election of 1971 threw a hung assembly. A coalition government was formed by Utkala Congress, Swatantra Party, Jharkhand Party and others. This government under leadership of Bishwanath Das lasted about a year. There were defections and it lost majority. A Congress government headed by Nandini Satpathy came into power by inducting the defectors from Utkal Congress. However the Satpathy government lost majority in six months when the ex-Utkal Congress Members decided to revive Utkal Congress. Satpathy Decided to call an election. On the eve of election Swatantra Party, Utkal Congress and Swadhin Congress decided to form Pragati Legislature Party. PLP staked claim to form government, but the Governor B.D Jatti dissolved the assembly and called for election.

==Organisation==
PLP was not a political party in a conventional sense. Its different constituents fought elections under different symbols and campaigned under different flags. It was led by 3 stalwarts of Orissa politics, Rajendra Narayan Singh Deo, Biju Patnaik, and Harekrushna Mahatab.

==Electoral performance== 
PLP won 56 seats in the 1974 mid-term elections. Biju Patnaik was elected as leader of opposition.

<doc id="1302678" wikidata="Q926871" url="?curid=1302678" title="Direct tax">
<text>Although the actual definitions vary between jurisdictions, in general, a direct tax is a tax imposed upon a person or property as distinct from a tax imposed upon a transaction, which is described as an indirect tax. There is a distinction between direct and indirect taxes depending on whether the tax payer is the actual taxpayer or if the amount of tax is supported by a third party, usually a client. The term may be used in economic and political analyses, and may have legal implications in some jurisdictions. In the United States of America, the term has special constitutional significance because of two provisions in the U.S. Constitution that any &quot;direct taxes&quot; imposed by the national government be apportioned among the states on the basis of population. It is also significant in the European Union, where direct taxation remains the sole responsibility of member states.

==General meaning==
In general, a direct tax is one imposed upon an individual person (juristic or natural) or property (i.e. real and personal property, livestock, crops, wages, etc.) as distinct from a tax imposed upon a transaction. In this sense, indirect taxes such as a sales tax or a value added tax (VAT) are imposed only if and when a taxable transaction occurs. People have the freedom to engage in or refrain from such transactions; whereas a direct tax (in the general sense) is imposed upon a person, typically in an unconditional manner, such as a poll-tax or head-tax, which is imposed on the basis of the person&#x27;s very life or existence, or a property tax which is imposed upon the owner by virtue of ownership, rather than commercial use. Some commentators have argued that the distinction rests on whether the burden of taxation can be shifted from one legal person to another.

Direct taxes are thought to be borne and paid by the same person. The person who pays the amount of direct tax does not recover all or part of the tax elsewhere. It is in this sense that direct taxation is opposed to indirect taxation. It is the notion of fiscal incidence which allows to analyse who ultimately, weights the burden of a tax, that determines whether the tax is direct or indirect. Direct taxation is generally declarative (established either by the person concerned or by a third party).

The unconditional, inexorable aspect of the direct tax was a paramount concern of people in the 18th century seeking to escape tyrannical forms of government and to safeguard individual liberty.

In &quot;The Wealth of Nations,&quot; Adam Smith was the first to extensively discuss in English the distinction between direct and indirect taxation by those names, as in the following passage:

Justice William Paterson quotes Smith approvingly, noting that indirect taxes are “circuitous modes of reaching the revenue of individuals,” which implies that direct taxes are those which are not circuitous.

The Pennsylvania Minority, a group of delegates to the 1787 U.S. Constitutional Convention who dissented from the document sent to the states for ratification, objected over this kind of taxation, and explained:

== Examples of direct taxes ==
Direct taxation can apply on income or on wealth (property tax; estate tax or wealth tax). Here below a few examples of direct taxes existing in the United States (though not all of these meet the US constitutional definition of a direct tax, as stated below):

* Income tax: it is the most important direct tax in many developed countries. It is based on incomes of taxpayers. A certain amount of money is taken from the wage of the individuals. When this type of tax is applied to corporations and firms, it is called corporate income tax.
* Transfer taxes: the most frequent form of transfer taxes is the estate tax. Such a tax is levied on the taxable portion of the property of a deceased individual. A gift tax is also another form of transfer taxes when a certain amount is collected from people who are transferring properties to another individual.

* Entitlement tax or payroll taxes: this type of direct tax serves to finance social security and health services. The entitlement tax is collected through payroll deductions. Their importance increases with the rise of the development of the welfare state during the twentieth century. 
* Property tax: property tax is charged on properties such as land and buildings. 
* Capital gains tax: this tax is collected when an individual earns gains from the sale of capital, for example when an individual sells stocks, real estate, or a business. The tax is computed by determining the difference between the acquisition amount and the selling amount.

== Effects of direct taxation and comparison of indirect taxation ==
Direct taxation has a few advantages and also some inconveniences in comparison of indirect taxes. It promotes equality and equity because direct taxes are based on ability to pay of the taxpayer and in the case of a progressive tax structure, every person is taxed differently depending on their income. Another advantage of direct taxation is that the government and the taxpayer know the amount they will receive and they pay, even before the collection of the tax. Direct taxation and in particular income tax act as automatic stabilizers. Some direct taxes are easy to collect for the government and the fiscal administration because they are collected at the source. Yet, tax collection can be expensive depending on the efficiency of the fiscal administration. Running the tax collection office has some administrative costs (keeping the records of incomes of the population for example), in particular when different tax rates are applied. Moreover, direct taxes can be evaded (tax evasion affects mainly direct taxes) whereas indirect taxes cannot be evaded (when the taxed transaction occurs, it is not possible to avoid the burden of the tax).

Direct taxes decrease the savings and earnings of individuals and firms. Indirect taxation however make goods and services more expensive (the burden of the tax is reflected in the prices). Contrary to indirect taxation which leads to inflation (increasing of the prices), direct taxes can help to reduce inflation.

There is no consensus among the academic literature to designate if direct taxation is more efficient or not. Earlier works based on static models favour direct taxation whereas the recent literature, based on neoclassical growth models, shows that indirect taxation is more efficient. The conclusions of these debates are that the answers are mostly conjectural, depending on the economic structure.

== Direct taxes and progressivity ==
Contrary to indirect taxes such as value-added taxes, direct taxes can be adjusted to the ability to pay of the taxpayer according to their status (income, age...). So, direct taxes can be progressive (the tax rate increases as the taxable amount increases), proportional (the tax rate is fixed, it does not change when the taxable base amount increases or decreases) or regressive (the tax rate decreases as the taxable amount increases) according to their structure. It differs from indirect taxes which are generally regressive because everyone pays the same amount regardless of ability to pay (meaning the burden of the tax is greater for the poorer than for the richer). 

Moreover, direct taxation are transfers which can have a redistributive preoccupation (combined with the will of increasing tax revenue). Indeed, taxation is a main tool of the redistributive function of the government identified by Richard Musgrave in his &quot;The Theory of Public Finance&quot; (1959). A progressive direct taxation could participate in the reduction of inequalities and correcting difference in living standards among the population.

Another effect of a progressive direct taxation is that such tax structure act as automatic stabilizers when prices are stable. Indeed, when incomes (in the example of a progressive income tax) decrease, as a result of recession, the average tax rate is reduced – individuals have to face lower tax rates because their earnings and their incomes have been reduced. And similarly, when incomes are increasing, the average tax rate increases also. This mechanism of progressive taxation participates to the stabilization of the economy, another function of the government in the works of Musgrave (stabilization branch of the government which prevents major fluctuations in real GDP). When incomes fall, tax revenues fall too (and in the case of progressive taxation, even tax rates drop also) reducing tax burden on taxpayers.

==U.S. constitutional law==
In the United States, the term “direct tax” has acquired specific meaning under constitutional law: a direct tax includes taxes on property by reason of ownership (such as an ordinary real estate property tax imposed on the person owning the property as of January 1 of each year) as well as capitations. Income taxes on income from personal services such as wages are indirect taxes in this sense. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has stated: “Only three taxes are definitely known to be direct: (1) a capitation [...], (2) a tax upon real property, and (3) a tax upon personal property.” In &quot;National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius,&quot; the Supreme Court held that the ObamaCare penalty imposed upon individuals for failure to possess health insurance, though a tax for constitutional purposes, is not a direct tax, reasoning that the tax is neither a tax on property, nor a capitation in that “it is triggered by specific circumstances” rather than levied “‘without regard to property, profession, or &quot;any other circumstance.&quot;’”

In the United States, the Constitution requires that direct taxes imposed by the national government be apportioned among the states on the basis of population. After the 1895 &quot;Pollock&quot; ruling that taxes on income from property should be treated as direct taxes, this provision made it difficult for Congress to impose a national income tax that applied to all forms of income until the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in 1913. Since then, Federal income taxes have been subject to the rule of uniformity but not the rule of apportionment. Before then, the principal sources of revenue for the federal government were excise taxes and customs duties. Their importance thus decreased during the twentieth century and the main federal government&#x27;s resources have become individual income taxes and payroll taxes. Other evolutions were observed at the local and state level with a decrease of importance of property taxes whereas income and sale taxes became more important.

In the context of income taxes on wages, salaries and other forms of compensation for personal services, see, e.g., &quot;United States v. Connor&quot;, 898 F.2d 942, 90-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,166 (3d Cir. 1990) (tax evasion conviction under affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit; taxpayer&#x27;s argument—that because of the Sixteenth Amendment, wages were not taxable—was rejected by the Court; taxpayer&#x27;s argument that an income tax on wages is required to be apportioned by population also rejected); &quot;Perkins v. Commissioner&quot;, 746 F.2d 1187, 84-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9898 (6th Cir. 1984) ( ruled by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to be “in full accordance with Congressional authority under the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution to impose taxes on income without apportionment among the states”; taxpayer&#x27;s argument that wages paid for labor are non-taxable was rejected by the Court, and ruled frivolous).

==Direct taxation in India==
Direct tax is a form of collecting taxes applicable on the general public by the means of their personal income and wealth generated and collected through formal channels and worthy government credentials such as Permanent account number and bank account details.

Section 2(c) of the Central Boards of Revenue Act, 1963 of India defines &quot;direct tax&quot; as follows: &lt;br&gt;
:″(1) any duty leviable (or) tax chargeable under-
::(i) the Estate Duty Act, 1953 (34 of 1953.);
::(ii) the Wealth-tax Act, 1957 (27 of 1957.);
::(iii) the Expenditure-tax Act, 1957 (29 of 1957.);
::(iv) the Gift-tax Act, 1958 (18 of 1958.);
::(v) the Income-tax Act, 1961 (43 of 1961.)

:(vi) the Super Profits Tax Act, 1963 (14 of 1963.); and

:(2) any other duty or tax which, having regard to its nature or incidence, may be declared by the Central Government, by notification in the Official Gazette, to be a direct tax.″ 

==Direct taxation in other countries==
Tax policy in the European Union (EU) consists of two components: direct taxation, which remains the sole responsibility of member states, and indirect taxation, which affects free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services. With regard to European Union direct taxes, Member States have taken measures to prevent tax avoidance and double taxation. EU direct taxation covers, regarding companies, the following policies: the common consolidated corporate tax base, the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different member states (to avoid withholding tax when the dividend qualifies for application of the EC Parent-Subsidiary Directive, the financial transaction tax, interest and royalty payments made between associated companies and elimination of double taxation if the payment qualifies for application of the EC Interest and Royalties Directive. Regarding direct taxation for individuals, the policies cover taxation of savings income, dividend taxation of individuals and tackling tax obstacles to the cross-border provision of occupational pensions.

<text>&quot;The Province of Jurisprudence Determined&quot; is a book written by John Austin, first published in 1832, in which he sets out his theory of law generally known as the &#x27;command theory&#x27;. Austin believed that the science of general jurisprudence consisted in the clarification and arrangement of fundamental legal notions.

His object in this book is to identify the distinguishing characteristics of positive law to free it from the precepts of religion and morality. The book consists of six lectures designed to be delivered in a law school setting. Although his theory did not receive significant attention in the 19th century, it has since become central to the jurisprudential canon, and has been criticised, adapted and enlarged upon by subsequent jurists such as H. L. A. Hart and Ronald Dworkin.

Austin was a student of Jeremy Bentham, and as such subscribed to Utilitarianism. He adopted this perspective in his understanding of law, and argued that all laws should work toward promoting the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

According to Austin, a law is &#x27;a rule laid down for the guidance of an intelligent being by an intelligent being having power over him.&#x27; This was what Austin defined as positive law. Austin believed that positive law was the appropriate focus of study for jurisprudence. He states that:

According to Austin, the sovereign could not be legally limited, &#x27;supreme power limited by positive law is a flat contradiction in terms&#x27; he states. However, he did concede that a sovereign may be limited in a non-legal sense by &#x27;popular opinion&#x27;.

He defined divine law as &#x27;law set by God to his human creatures&#x27;. Although he contends that God&#x27;s (law) is above and beyond human law, he also states that:

<text>Edward Treacher Collins (28 May 1862 – 13 December 1932) was a British surgeon and ophthalmologist. He is best known for describing the Treacher Collins syndrome.

==Biography==
He was the son of Dr. William Job Collins and Miss Treacher. Treacher Collins used his mother&#x27;s maiden name and his father&#x27;s surname without a hyphen, according to the custom of the time.

He entered University College London. In 1879 he began studies at Middlesex Hospital; he received his medical degree in 1883. Influenced by his older brother Sir William Collins, he decided to specialize in ophthalmology. For his internship, he went to the Moorfields Eye Hospital, where he remained as a faculty member for the next 48 years. His work culminated in the publication &quot;Researches into the Anatomy and Pathology of the Eye&quot; (1896), which earned him worldwide recognition.

He died on 13 December 1932 and is buried in a family grave on the west side of Highgate Cemetery.

<text>Nansen is an old lunar impact crater along the northern limb of the Moon, on the eastern side of the north pole. This feature is viewed from the edge from the Earth, and it must be observed from orbit to see much detail. When brought into view during a favorable libration, this formation can be located by finding the crater Baillaud, then following the surface up towards the limb.

This formation has been heavily worn and eroded by minor impacts, leaving an irregular outer wall that is marked by multiple small craters and indentations. A small crater lies across the northern rim of Nansen, and a similar formation is located along the inner southern wall. A merged chain of tiny craters lies across the eastern rim.

The interior floor of Nansen is more hummocky and irregular in the northern half, while the southern part of the floor is relatively level. There is a small, bowl-shaped crater in the southeastern part of the floor, and many tiny craterlets lie across the interior and along the inner walls.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Nansen.

<text>Sadia S.A. is a major Brazilian food producer that has been a subsidiary of BRF S.A. since 2009. It is among the world&#x27;s leading producers of frozen foods, and is Brazil&#x27;s main exporter of meat-based products.

In Portuguese the word &quot;sadia&quot; means &quot;healthy&quot;, but the name is also an abbreviation of &quot;[[Sadia|S]]ociedade [[Sadia|A]]nônima Indústria e Comércio Concór[[Sadia|dia]]&quot;, with the bold letters being the letters that compose the abbreviation.

Sadia was founded in Concórdia, Santa Catarina, Brazil, and has its headquarters there.

As of 2008, Sadia had about 20 industrial plants that together produced over 2.3 million tons of food including chicken, turkey, pork and beef, pasta, margarine, desserts, and other products. The company supplies over 70 thousand direct points of sale in Brazil and exports to over 100 countries.

Sadia&#x27;s former chairman Luís Fernando Furlan was appointed Minister of Industry and Foreign Trade by president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2003.

In 2008, the company accrued enormous losses on the derivative market.

In 2009, the company announced a merger with its major competitor Perdigão, forming BRF - Brasil Foods (technically a takeover of Sadia by Perdigão, which already changed its corporate name to BRF - Brasil Foods S.A.).

In March 2017, BRF was revealed to have sold processed rotten meat, resulting in food scares and worldwide recalls.

<text>Closers (Korean: 클로저스) is a free-to-play 3D MMORPG developed by Naddic Games and published by Nexon in South Korea with Naddic Games self-published the game worldwide.

In August 2017, En Masse Entertainment announced that is launching the game in North America and Europe. Closed alpha tests began in September, with closed beta launched in November.

Due to En Masse Entertainment ceasing operations, the publishing rights of the game in North America and Europe was transferred to the developer, and on November 5, 2020, the server was relaunched as the global server for Closers.

== Plot ==
Closers is set in the Year is 2020, The Place, Seoul. After the invading dimensional monsters were beaten back, Seoul was rebuilt. Mysterious dimensional gates opened all over the planet and unleashed a worldwide invasion of dimensional monsters and aliens. No monsters and tactics had any effect on the waves of dimensional monsters pouring out of the dimensional gates. City after city was mercilessly destroyed. But the opening of the dimensional gates did not only cause damage and destruction. The psychokinetic power that it awoke also enabled a tiny minority of humans to gain extraordinary psychic powers. With these psychic warriors, governments around the world were able to turn the tide of the war with these monsters. After unspeakable losses, the people of earth at least succeeded in closing the gates. Since they had closed the gates, these psychics began to be called &quot;CLOSERS,&quot; and the invasion of the dimensional monsters was named the First Dimensional War. With the dimensional monsters vanquished, peace returned to the world, and the cities were rebuilt. Through dedicated research into the dimensional gates and psychokinetic power, humans learned that the gates open when there is a singularity in this mysterious power. However, their understanding of the gates was still incomplete. The CLOSERS who survived the First Dimensional War became part of an organization called UNION. Together, they researched the psychokinetic power in all over the world, working to prevent another dimensional war. And that&#x27;s when the dimensional gates all over the world started shaking again - as ever stronger outbreed creatures renewed the attack on earth.&quot;

<text>Claude-Pierre Goujet (19 October 1697 – 1 February 1767), French abbé and &quot;littérateur&quot;, was born in Paris.

He studied at the College of the Jesuits, and at the Collège Mazarin, but he nevertheless became a strong Jansenist. In 1705 he assumed the ecclesiastical habit, in 1719 entered the order of Oratorians, and soon afterwards was named canon of St Jacques l&#x27;Hôpital. On account of his extreme Jansenist opinions he suffered considerable persecution from the Jesuits, and several of his works were suppressed at their instigation. In his latter years his health began to fail, and he lost his eyesight. Poverty compelled him to sell his library, a sacrifice which hastened his death, which took place at Paris on 1 February 1767.

He is the author of &quot;Supplement au dictionnaire de Morri&quot; (1735), and a &quot;Nouveau Supplement&quot; to a subsequent edition of the work; he collaborated in &quot;Bibliothèque française, ou histoire littéraire de la France&quot; (18 vols, Paris, 1740–1759); and in the &quot;Vies des saints&quot; (7 vols, 1730); he also wrote &quot;Mémoires historiques et littéraires sur le collège royal de France&quot; (1758); &quot;Histoire des Inquisitions&quot; (Paris, 1752); and supervised an edition of César-Pierre Richelet&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire&quot;, of which he has also given an abridgment. He helped Jean Claude Fabre to complete Fleury&#x27;s &quot;Histoire ecclésiastique&quot;.

<doc id="1302713" wikidata="Q1756223" url="?curid=1302713" title="Demon Hunter (album)">
<text>Demon Hunter is the debut studio album by American Christian metal band Demon Hunter. It was released on Solid State Records on October 22, 2002.

==Recording==
The album was recorded in Drop C tuning. All of Demon Hunter&#x27;s subsequent releases would be dropped even lower to Drop B. Industrial vocal elements are also featured in various songs.

==Touring and promotion==
Demon Hunter joined Extol on tour in the summer of 2003.

Demon Hunter&#x27;s material first appeared on &quot;This Is Solid State Vol. 3&quot; in February 2002, which included a demo recording of the band&#x27;s song &quot;Through the Black&quot;. &quot;Through the Black&quot; was later re-recorded for Demon Hunter&#x27;s self-titled album. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Infected,&quot; had a music video which debuted on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Extreme Rock&quot; and found considerable airplay on Fuse TV&#x27;s &quot;Uranium&quot;. The intense video revolves around two subjects; one, vocalist Ryan Clark, is shown using an extravagant dagger to carve the word &quot;HELP&quot; into a tree in the pouring rain. The second subject is a white collared man at a desk who, for ambiguous reasons, is overcome with extreme panic. The man finally falls to the floor after typing &quot;help&quot; repeatedly on his keyboard, with the word being shown on a monitor. &quot;Infected&quot; would be featured on the compilation album &quot;MTV2 Headbangers Ball&quot; in 2003. &quot;Demon Hunter&quot; was later included on &quot;Death, a Destination&quot;1, the band&#x27;s second compilation album, in 2011.

==Album art and booklet==
The band members are not credited in the album&#x27;s liner notes. Clark explained this by citing the fact that Demon Hunter&#x27;s members have been in previous groups and that they wanted the band to initially rely solely on its music. The &quot;Demon Hunter&quot; booklet has four chapters: &quot;Letters from the Seventh War&quot;, &quot;The Red Wasp/The Everlasting Death&quot;, &quot;Love and Grace for Fallen Souls&quot;, and &quot;The Awakening&quot;. The first three chapters comprise three tracks each, with the last one consisting only of the last track on the album. When asked about this, Clark responded:
:&quot;It was more an artwork based concept as opposed to a concept pertaining to the music. We wanted to give it an old world feel, with the book and everything. Just a way to make the artwork really come alive.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Demon Hunter&quot; was generally well received. Allmusic&#x27;s Alex Henderson rated the album three out of five stars. He described it as &quot;an album in which moments of intense brutality are followed by hauntingly melodic passages.&quot; He commended the band for its &quot;complementary&quot; use of intensity and melody&quot;. &quot;CMJ&quot; called the album &quot;Christian death metal at its finest&quot;, noting that the album is overstuffed with styles, &quot;but that&#x27;s just the way metalcore kids like it.&quot; &quot;Exclaim!&quot;&#x27;s Greg Pratt called the album &quot;metalcore at its finest.&quot; Though he found the album not up to the standard of the band&#x27;s peers on Solid State, particularly Zao, Norma Jean, and Living Sacrifice, and said that the music was repetitive in places, he wrote that the songwriting keeps things interesting and that &quot; for the teen angst-types looking for something more genuine than whatever the mainstream is pumping out, Demon Hunter will be a good stepping stone to get kids into more underground tunes.&quot;

==Track listing==

: Live recording appears on both &quot;45 Days&quot; (2008) and &quot;Live in Nashville&quot; (2009)
: Re-recorded for &quot;Songs of Death and Resurrection&quot; (2021)

<text>Pascal is a lunar impact crater that lies near the northern limb of the Moon, on the western side of the pole. It is located to the north of the eroded crater Desargues, and just east of Brianchon. Pascal can be located by finding the crater Carpenter and then following the surface to the northwest towards the limb. However the visibility of this formation can be affected by libration.

This crater has undergone a degree of impact erosion that has left its features softened and rounded. The rim can still be followed around the perimeter, but it is no longer sharp-edged and the interior s have been all but worn away. Several craters lie across the outer rim, including the sharp-edged Pascal F intruding into the northwest rim; a more worn Pascal A intruding into the southwest; and the small, bowl-shaped Pascal G along the southeast rim.

Within the wide inner walls is a nearly level interior floor that has been resurfaced by lava. At the midpoint is a low ridge, forming a minor central peak. There are tiny craters at the north end of the floor, and at the northeast end of the central ridge. There is also a small chain of craterlets lying across the northeast inner wall.

Just to the north of Pascal is Poncelet C, a satellite crater of the lava-flooded Poncelet to the east. The rim of this crater is bisected by several grooves in the surface, one of which crosses the southeast rim and cuts across tangentially to the northeastern rim of Pascal.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pascal.
