<text>Tommie Harris Jr. (born April 29, 1983) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the University of Oklahoma, and was recognized as a consensus All-American twice. The Chicago Bears chose him in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft, and he also played a season for the San Diego Chargers. He was a three-time Pro Bowl selection.

==Early life==
Harris was born in Nuremberg, Germany, where his father, Tommie Sr, was stationed as a United States Army drill sergeant. Harris and his family relocated often due to Tommie Sr&#x27;s role in the Army before finally settling in Killeen, Texas. Harris&#x27; father became a Pentecostal minister, while his mother, Janine, worked as a special education teacher. Harris was raised in a devout Christian household alongside his four sisters.

He attended Ellison High School in Killeen. As a member of the Ellison Eagles, Harris became one of the nation&#x27;s top defensive high school prospects, including being ranked as the No. 35 high school prospect in the nation by recruiting analyst Tom Lemming. During the 1998 football season, he was a back-up defensive tackle in his sophomore year for the Eagles who were ranked No. 1 in the state of Texas and No. 13 in the nation. He was also a member of Ellison&#x27;s track and field team, where he participated in the shot put.

==College career==
While attending the University of Oklahoma, Harris played for coach Bob Stoops&#x27;s Oklahoma Sooners football team from 2001 to 2003. He is one of the very few players in OU history to start every game of his true freshman season. He was a two-time All-Big 12 selection, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American in 2002 and a unanimous first-team All-American in 2003. In his junior and final season as a Sooner, Harris won the Lombardi Award as the nation&#x27;s best lineman in 2003. He was named to the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; All-Decade Team in 2009.

==Professional career==

===Chicago Bears===
The Chicago Bears selected Harris in the first round, 14th overall, in the 2004 NFL draft. Harris, a 3-technique defensive tackle, complimented Lovie Smith&#x27;s Cover 2 defense, which relied on mobile lineman to penetrate the line of scrimmage. Smith compared Harris to Warren Sapp, whom he coached during his tenure with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Harris appeared in all 16 games for the Bears during the 2004 NFL season, where he recorded 44 combined tackles, 7 tackles for loss, and 3.5 sacks. He finished second in balloting for the Defensive Rookie of the Year award.

In , Harris was selected for the 2006 Pro Bowl.

Harris enjoyed an excellent start to the season, leading the league with five sacks after four games. He was instrumental in a week 3 victory over the Vikings, disrupting a handoff in the Vikings backfield and forcing a fumble, which allowed the Bears to score the game-winning touchdown. Harris was awarded the NFC&#x27;s &quot;Defensive Player of the Week&quot; award twice in three weeks. Harris suffered a season-ending hamstring injury in the Bears&#x27; Week 13 victory against the Vikings. Harris was selected to play in the 2007 Pro Bowl.

Harris missed the first three games of the preseason while recovering from his hamstring injury. He played in the Bears&#x27; season opener against the San Diego Chargers and forced a fumble. He appeared in all 16 games for the Bears, finishing the 2007 campaign with two forced fumbles and a career high eight sacks. Harris was selected to his third consecutive Pro Bowl, but did not attend due a knee injury.

One June 19, 2008, Harris signed a four-year contract extension with the Bears worth $40 million, which made him the highest paid defensive tackle in the NFL. The incentive-laden contract would award Harris $8.5 million if he was selected to the Pro Bowls in 2008, 2009, and 2010, while also including an additional $2 million bonus based on performance. $17 million of the contract was guaranteed. Harris missed the Bears week four game against the Philadelphia Eagles due to a knee injury. The Bears suspended Harris for their following game against the Detroit Lions for missing scheduled treatments to rehabilitate his knee without a proper excuse. Harris appeared in 14 games for the Bears, tallying 37 tackles and 4 sacks.
Harris&#x27; role with the Bears decreased after he re-injured his knee during week 6 of the season. Harris never fully recovered from the injury. On November 8, Harris was ejected just 65 seconds into the first quarter in a game against the Arizona Cardinals for punching guard Deuce Lutui in the face. He later apologized for the incident.

In , Harris was benched after the second week of the season. Head coach Lovie Smith stated, &quot;We have 45 guys that you can go with; we have everybody healthy right now. Just felt like we wanted to get a look at Marcus Harrison, him and Henry Melton inside, a little bit. Just performance based. Tommie&#x27;s been doing everything we&#x27;ve asked him to do.&quot; The same week, former defensive tackle Warren Sapp criticized Harris, comparing him to &quot;blind dog in a meat house.&quot; Harris struggled to retain his starting position throughout the season. He recorded his only sack of the season in week 17 against the Green Bay Packers. He finished the season with only 13 tackles and 1.5 sacks, his lowest during his time in Chicago.

The Bears released Harris after the season on February 28, 2011. Harris concluded his seven-year tenure with the Bears with 213 tackles, 28.5 sacks, and 5 forced fumbles in 104 games.

===Indianapolis Colts===
On August 2, 2011, Harris signed a one-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts, but was released on September 3.

===San Diego Chargers===
Harris signed with the San Diego Chargers on September 28, 2011 to reinforce the team&#x27;s defensive line following injuries to Luis Castillo and Jacques Cesaire. He appeared in 13 games for the Chargers where he recorded 12 tackles and 3.5 sacks.

===Retirement===
Tommie Harris retired from football in 2012 to raise his children following his wife&#x27;s unexpected death.

==NFL career statistics==
==Post-retirement==
Harris was the co-owner of the Texas Outlaws of the Fall Experimental Football League along with fellow NFL alum Eric Bassey. Harris donated $165,000 to pay for new equipment in the Lions Club Park Family Recreation and Senior Center in Killeen, Texas. The facility&#x27;s recreation center was named after him to honor his donation.

==Personal==
Harris was mentored by NFL Hall of Famer Reggie White, whose influence significantly shaped his life and playing career. Harris remained close with the White family even after his death in 2004.

Harris married his wife, Ashley, in January 2012 and the couple had two children together. In February 2012, Ashley suddenly died of a brain aneurysm while undergoing a routine medical procedure. In 2016, Harris&#x27; daughter died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. In 2017, his agent, William G. Horn, was revealed to be stealing money from Harris&#x27; charity and using it for personal expenses, including entertainment and traveling. Horn was sentenced to 15 months in prison. In 2020, Harris&#x27; father, Tommie Sr., died following a one-year struggle with kidney failure. Harris published a book about coping with his personal struggles, titled &quot;Endure: Playing Through Life&#x27;s Hardest Hits&quot; in 2021.

===Legal troubles===
Harris was arrested in Chicago and charged with indecent exposure, urinating in public and simple assault for threatening a police officer in 2012. He was arrested for trespassing in 2022 after refusing to leave the Omni Hotel in Oklahoma City.

<doc id="1292568" wikidata="Q4839249" url="?curid=1292568" title="Back in '72">
<text>Back in &#x27;72 is the sixth studio album by American rock singer-songwriter Bob Seger, released in 1973. It was the first new album on Seger&#x27;s manager Punch Andrews&#x27; label, Palladium Records, to be released under their distribution deal with the Reprise division of Warner Bros. Records and one of three early Seger albums that has never been reissued on CD.

==Recording==

The album was recorded partly with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, a renowned group of session musicians. According to Seger, there was a financial misunderstanding with the musicians: they offered to record him &quot;for $1500 a side&quot;, which he took to mean $1500 per album side. When he found out that they meant $1500 per song, he left after recording three songs but resolved to work with them in the future.

The album contains the original studio version of &quot;Turn the Page&quot;, a live recording of which would be released on &quot;Live Bullet&quot; in 1976 and would become a staple of classic rock radio. It&#x27;s believed that much of the influence of this album is a result of his brief experience as a member of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity at Michigan State University.

The song &quot;Rosalie&quot; was written in tribute to Rosalie Trombley, the music director of CKLW-AM in Windsor, Ontario, which was an important Top 40 radio station in the 1960s and 1970s. The song was made more famous by the Irish rock band Thin Lizzy, who originally recorded it for their 1975 album &quot;Fighting&quot;; another recording, included on their live album &quot;Live and Dangerous&quot; in 1978, became a hit single in the UK in the same year.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Back in &#x27;72&quot; reached only 188 on the US charts and has since faded into obscurity. Even so, the album and its supporting tour mark the beginnings of Seger&#x27;s long-time relationships with future Silver Bullet Band saxophonist Alto Reed, powerhouse female vocalist Shaun Murphy, and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic retrospectively gave the album 4.5/5 stars, calling it &quot;not only the finest of [Seger&#x27;s] early-&#x27;70s albums but one of the great lost hard rock albums of its era,&quot; and &quot;a testament to great rock &amp; roll, thanks to Seger&#x27;s phenomenal songwriting and impassioned playing.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; called the single &quot;Rosalie&quot; a &quot;thumper that should make Top 40 and progressive ears ring with delight.&quot;

Despite being a fan favorite by many die-hard Seger fans, and including classic live staples and radio hits such as &quot;Neon Sky&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Working&quot; and the original studio version of the epic live ballad &quot;Turn the Page&quot;, this album has never been reissued and is extremely rare to find on any format, even as a bootleg. However, the Allman Brothers cover &quot;Midnight Rider&quot; which appears on the album was later released on Seger&#x27;s compilation record &quot;Early Seger Vol. 1&quot; in 2009. The song was remixed and remastered from the original vinyl LP version, and it was shortened by fading out at the end. The original version did not fade out but instead broke down to where Seger &quot;scat sang&quot; before the final beat.

In 2005, shortly after the reissue of &quot;Smokin O.P.&#x27;s&quot;, there were rumors of the album to be reissued onto a CD. Seger denied these rumors saying that he did not like the vocals on the album and probably will not release it for quite some time. This marks the album as an extremely rare and unheard of Seger gem much like 1969&#x27;s &quot;Noah&quot; and 1971&#x27;s acoustic solo album &quot;Brand New Morning&quot; which Seger has also often stated that he may never reissue.

This album has turned out to have inspired several bands: Steve Miller Band&#x27;s &quot;Rock&#x27;n Me&quot; has a similar melody as &quot;Rosalie&quot;, Crowded House&#x27;s version of &quot;Silent House&quot; is similar to &quot;So I Wrote You A Song&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Time&quot; led to &quot;More Than A Feeling&quot; by Boston.

<text>Lambton Quay (once known as The Beach) is the heart of the central business district of Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. 

==Geography==
Originally, as the name implies, it was the high-water line of the foreshore, and sometimes the sea would roll across the road and enter the shops on the opposite side. It was the site of the original European settlement in 1840 (following initial settlement on flood-prone land at Petone), which grew into Wellington. In the 19th century Pipitea Pa was situated at the extreme northern end of Lambton Quay – the section of road in this area is now known as Thorndon Quay. Land uplift caused by the 1855 Wairarapa earthquake and further reclamation have left Lambton Quay some 250 metres from the current shoreline. Kumototo Stream used to flow from the Terrace, down what is now Woodward Street and across Lambton Quay to the waterfront. This stream was culverted in the late 19th century.

Lambton Quay, Willis Street, Manners Street and Courtenay Place form what is known locally as the &quot;Golden Mile&quot;. The city&#x27;s retail trade has spread further south to also include Cuba Street, but Lambton Quay remains a major commercial thoroughfare. In 2020 it was estimated that about 70,000 people travel on Lambton Quay and Willis Street each day, mostly on foot or by bus. It is also of administrative significance, with the New Zealand Parliament Buildings towards the northern end. The Wellington Cenotaph is also located at this end, next to Parliament. 

The Wellington Cable Car runs from Lambton Quay to the top of the Botanic Garden. James Henry Marriott, who arrived from London in 1843, had a bookshop here.

The length of Lambton Quay is punctuated by several notable sculptures.

== History ==

Lambton Quay is named after John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, the first chairman of directors of the New Zealand Company. Dense bush, down to the harbour&#x27;s edge, covered much of the area until 1840 and, at the site of the Old Bank Arcade, it could be hard to get round the rocks at high tide at what was then Windy Point, or Clay Point. The Point was dug away between 1857 and 1863 to reclaim 7 acres 3 roods 34 perches (almost ). 

The name Lambton Quay was in use by the end of 1840. On 22 October 1840 Barrett&#x27;s Hotel, a 2-storey pub, opened at the north end of the Quay. The Wellington Hotel opened by 1843. Its owner, Baron Alzdorf, was the only Wellington person killed in the 1855 earthquake, when a chimney of the hotel fell on him, after which it became the Criterion Hotel, a name it kept until at least 1887. By 1900 buildings on the Quay included the Royal Hotel, government printer, Old Government Buildings, Central Police Station, Club Hotel, Occidental Hotel, Commercial Union and New Zealand Insurance companies, Trust &amp; Loan Co, Star Hotel, Baker Bros, Union Bank of Australia, Bank of New South Wales, South British Insurance, Colonial Bank, Exchange Building, Barrett&#x27;s Hotel and Equitable Building Investment Co.

On 11 February, the Wellington City Council confirmed that it would begin pedestrianising the Golden Mile area between Lambton Quay and Courtenay Place in April 2025. This project would include removing cars, widening footpaths and building cycling lanes in the area. Wellington Chamber of Commerce chief executive Simon Arcus expressed concern that these changes could affect local businesses and emphasised the need for consultation.

<doc id="1292583" wikidata="Q4677831" url="?curid=1292583" title="Actual sin">
<text>According to Western Christianity, actual sin, as distinguished from original sin, is an act contrary to the will and law of God whether by doing evil (sin of commission) or refraining from doing good (sin of omission). It can be either &quot;mortal&quot; or &quot;venial&quot;.

==Catholicism==
===Kinds of Actual Sin===

===Mortal sin===

In Roman Catholic moral theology, a sin, considered to be more severe or mortal sin is distinct from a venial sin (somewhat similar to the secular common law distinction of classifying the severity of a crime as either a felony or a misdemeanor) and must meet all of the following conditions:
Its subject must be a grave (or serious) matter.
It must be committed with full knowledge, both of the sin and of the gravity of the offense (Article 1860 of The Catechism Of The Catholic Church specifies;) &quot;Unintentional ignorance can diminish or even remove the imputability of a grave offense. But no one is deemed to be ignorant of the principles of the moral law, which are written in the conscience of every man. the promptings of feelings and passions can also diminish the voluntary and free character of the offense, as can external pressures or pathological disorders (mental illness). Sin committed through malice, by deliberate choice of evil, is the gravest.&quot;
It must be committed with deliberate and complete consent, enough for it to have been a personal decision to commit the sin. (Article 1859 of The Catechism Of The Catholic Church specifies;) &quot;Mortal sin requires full knowledge and complete consent. It presupposes knowledge of the sinful character of the act, of its opposition to God&#x27;s law. It also implies a consent sufficiently deliberate to be a personal choice. Feigned ignorance and hardness of heart do not diminish, but rather increase, the voluntary character of a sin.&quot;
====Venial sin====

In Roman Catholic theology, venial sin will not cause loss of heaven in itself, but can eventually lead to the death of the soul by making the doer weaker to resisting mortal sin.
Sin is made venial in two ways:
*The sin is not seriously wrong.
*The sin is seriously wrong, but the sinner honestly believes that it is only slightly wrong, or does not give full consent.
A venial sin weakens our power to resist mortal sin, and a venial sin makes us deserving of God’s punishments in this life or in purgatory.

====Capital vices or the seven deadly sins ====
In Roman Catholic theology, the &quot;Capital vices&quot; or sins, also known as the &quot;seven deadly sins&quot;, are the main roots of sin. They are called capital sins not because they are the greatest sins or necessarily mortal sins, but because all sins are in some way related to at least one of them. These sins are:
#Lust
#Gluttony
#Greed
#Sloth
#Wrath 
#Envy
#Pride
==Methodism==

A prominent Methodist catechism, &quot;A Catechism on the Christian Religion: The Doctrines of Christianity with Special Emphasis on Wesleyan Concepts&quot; contrasts original sin and actual sin:

<doc id="1292592" wikidata="Q1373712" url="?curid=1292592" title="Sam Bowie">
<text>Samuel Paul Bowie (born March 17, 1961) is an American former professional basketball player. A national sensation in high school and outstanding collegian and Olympic team member, Bowie&#x27;s professional promise was undermined by repeated injuries to his legs and feet. In spite of the setbacks, the and center played ten seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Projected as a solid first-rounder in the 1984 NBA draft, Bowie was chosen by the Portland Trail Blazers as the second selection, ahead of Michael Jordan.

==Early life==
Bowie was born on March 17, 1961, as the son of Ben Bowie and Cathy &quot;Sammy&quot; Bowie. His father was and had played basketball for the Harlem Magicians for six seasons. Bowie&#x27;s parents divorced when he was 12. After the divorce, Bowie lived with both of his parents in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. Concerned about not showing favoritism toward either parent, he then lived with his maternal grandmother until going to college.

Bowie was a sophomore in college when his father died suddenly, aged 45, when a cyst on his lung burst. Of his father Ben, after he died, Bowie said, &quot;We loved each other more than two individuals could. But we never could say, &#x27;I love you.&#x27; Neither of us was that kind of person. That&#x27;s the thing I&#x27;m most sorry about, that I didn&#x27;t get to tell him I loved him before he was gone.&quot;

==High school career==
Bowie attended Lebanon High School in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He played on its basketball team under Coach Chick Hess. Hess said of Bowie, &quot;He&#x27;s a father. He&#x27;s responsible. He&#x27;s got a head on his shoulder. He just doesn&#x27;t have two legs that are serving him well. He adjusted to the big-time world. He grew up with blue-collar people who knew what it was like to work for a living. We&#x27;re all proud of him. He got what he could out of playing pro sports.&quot;

A star player, Bowie was heavily recruited. He averaged over 28 points and 18 rebounds per game, and was a McDonald&#x27;s and &quot;Parade&quot; All-American. As a junior, he led the Cedars to the state finals, where they lost by a point to Schenley High School of Pittsburgh. &quot;When I say this, I mean it with all my heart, from the Kentucky experience to all of my years in pro ball, when I reminisce I go back to my Lebanon Cedar days,&quot; said Bowie in 2018. &quot;I just wish we could&#x27;ve won that state championship game. Fifty-one to fifty, we were so close.&quot;

Bowie was named national player of the year in 1979. He received the honor over Harrisonburg, Virginia&#x27;s Ralph Sampson, another highly recruited center. Sampson and Bowie played in the annual Capital Classic all-star game, which was dubbed the &quot;Battle of the Giants&quot; Played at the Capital Centre, the game featured the best players in the Washington, D.C. area playing against an all-star squad composed of players from across the United States.

In February 1979, a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine article feature focused on Bowie, Sampson and Steve Stipanovich as the best high school centers.

Bowie played in the 1979 McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game. The memorable rosters included: Antoine Carr, Quintin Dailey, Sidney Green, Clark Kellogg, Greg Kite, Sidney Lowe, John Paxson, Ralph Sampson, Byron Scott, Steve Stipanovich, Isiah Thomas, Dereck Whittenburg, Dominique Wilkins and James Worthy.

==College career (1979–1984)==
Bowie signed to play for the University of Kentucky, under Coach Joe B. Hall, in 1979.

=== Freshman season (1979–1980) ===
As a freshman during the 1979–80 season at Kentucky, Bowie averaged 6.9 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.1 blocks per game. Kentucky finished 29–6 and advanced to the 1980 NCAA tournament. Bowie had 13 points, 11 rebounds and 3 blocks in Kentucky&#x27;s 97–78 victory over Florida State. He played nine minutes, fouling out with 2 points and 3 rebounds in a 55–54 loss to Duke.

=== Sophomore season (1980–1981) ===
Bowie&#x27;s sophomore season saw him average 17.5 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game. He was named a third-team NCAA Basketball All-American by the Associated Press. In 1981, he set, and now shares, the Kentucky record for most blocked shots in a game, with nine against St. John&#x27;s.

However, Bowie began sustaining injuries that would plague the remainder of his basketball career. In the third-to-last game of his sophomore season against Vanderbilt, Bowie went up for a dunk but came down off balance. He landed with most of his weight on his left leg, saying that he felt pain but initially tried to play through it. Kentucky qualified for the 48-team 1981 NCAA tournament as the #2 seed in the Mideast Region, with a first-round bye. In the Wildcats&#x27; first game of the tournament, against #7 seed Alabama-Birmingham, Bowie fouled out, playing 21 minutes, as Kentucky was eliminated by UAB 69–62.

=== Injuries (1981–1983) ===
After the 1980–1981 season, a stress fracture in his left tibia was discovered, the injury caused Bowie to miss the entire 1981–82 season. The stress fracture did not heal completely and Bowie sat out the entire 1982–83 season as well. Doctors at first thought the pain in the left leg was due to shin splints, but just before the season in 1981, new X-rays revealed Bowie had a stress fracture he had been playing on. He was in a cast for 44 weeks. But, after removing the cast, the injury did not heal properly. Bowie had to have it surgically repaired, with a bone graft. As his class had graduated, Bowie applied for and was granted an NCAA medical redshirt to allow him another year of college eligibility.

=== Senior season (1983–1984) ===
Bowie returned for the 1983–84 season. Having not played in two years, he played in all 34 Kentucky games and averaged 10.5 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks. He was named to the Associated Press second-team All-American team. During his senior season, his heroics in a game against rival Louisville earned him a spot on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Bowie, along with fellow &quot;Twin Tower&quot; Melvin Turpin (as the Kentucky frontcourt duo was called), and Kenny Walker led Kentucky to the SEC championship, the SEC Tournament Championship, a top-three national ranking, and a 26–4 season record.

In the 1984 NCAA tournament, the Wildcats defeated Brigham Young 93–68, in-state rival Louisville 72–67 and Illinois 54–51 to advance to the Final Four in Seattle. Bowie had 16 points and 6 rebounds against BYU, 8 points, 12 rebounds and 3 blocks against Louisville and 11 points and 14 rebounds against Illinois.

In the Final Four, Kentucky met eventual NCAA Champion Georgetown, with Patrick Ewing in the semi-finals. Kentucky led at the half, but Georgetown defeated the Wildcats 53–40, ending Bowie&#x27;s college career. Bowie had 10 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks in the loss. Ewing had 8 points and 9 rebounds with 0 blocks.

In 96 career games at Kentucky, Bowie averaged 13.4 points, 8.8 rebounds, 2.3 blocks and 1.4 assists on 69.9% shooting. Bowie played 3 seasons in five years.

== 1980 Olympic team ==
In the summer of 1980, Bowie was selected for the United States Olympic men&#x27;s basketball team. The 1980 United States Olympic team was coached by Dave Gavitt and assisted by Larry Brown. The 1980 US team was the youngest American national team ever assembled. Alongside Bowie were team members Mark Aguirre, Rolando Blackman, Michael Brooks, Bill Hanzlik, Alton Lister, Rodney McCray, Isiah Thomas, Darnell Valentine, Danny Vranes, Buck Williams and Al Wood.

The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the United States and 66 other countries to boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Unable to compete in the Olympics due to the boycott, Team USA played a series of games against NBA all-star teams in various US cities, ending with a 5–1 record. The games were labeled the &quot;Gold Medal Series&quot;. In the six games against NBA All-Stars, Bowie was Team USA&#x27;s second-leading scorer and leading rebounder and shot-blocker, averaging 11.6 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks. Bowie was 19 years old while playing on Team USA.

Many years later, he received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the 1980 athletes.

==NBA career==

===1984 NBA draft===
Entering the 1984 NBA draft, although the Houston Rockets had tied with the Indiana Pacers for the NBA&#x27;s worst record, the Pacers had traded the top pick to the Portland Trail Blazers in 1981 for center Tom Owens. In 1984, having beat the Blazers in a coin toss for first pick, the Rockets chose Houston center Hakeem Olajuwon. Unable to choose him, yet still seeking a center, the Blazers chose Bowie. Choosing third, the Chicago Bulls then drafted North Carolina shooting guard Michael Jordan.

At the time, picking Bowie made sense from the Blazers&#x27; perspective. The team had not had a solid big man since Bill Walton, one of its first major stars, left in 1979. Soon before the draft, the NBA fined the Blazers $250,000 (equivalent of $,000 in 2018) for improper contact with Olajuwon and center Patrick Ewing. A year earlier, Portland had drafted a shooting guard, Olajuwon&#x27;s college teammate Clyde Drexler. Having both Drexler and Jim Paxson, the Blazers had little need on paper for another shooting guard. Still, in 2005, highlighting Bowie&#x27;s injury-laden college career, ESPN named the Blazers&#x27; choice the worst draft pick in the history of North American professional sports. Also that year, arguing that teams should draft for talent and not need, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Bowie the biggest draft bust in NBA history.

===Portland Trail Blazers (1984–1989)===
During his rookie season, Bowie played in 76 games and averaged 10 points and 8.6 rebounds, earning a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Team. However, in his second season, Bowie&#x27;s leg injuries recurred. During a game against the Milwaukee Bucks at The MECCA, Bowie and teammate Jerome Kersey became entangled going for a rebound, and as they landed, Bowie&#x27;s left tibia broke. He was carried off the floor on a stretcher.

&quot;I firmly believe I can be one of the top centers in the league if I&#x27;m healthy,&quot; said Bowie. &quot;One year, things are going to fall into place, and I&#x27;m going to show people how good I can be.&quot;

The next season, Bowie returned. In the season&#x27;s fifth game against the Dallas Mavericks, Bowie went up for a jump hook shot. As he went up, his legs buckled underneath him and Bowie fell to the floor. He suffered a season-ending fracture of his right tibia. Bowie compared the feeling having his leg chopped by an ax. &quot;It was not a pretty sight,&quot; Portland teammate Clyde Drexler recalled. &quot;He went to make a move, fell, and threw the ball down hard off the court. I remember seeing part of the bone sticking out of his leg and how he was beating the floor over and over with his fist.&quot;

Bowie&#x27;s subsequent surgery utilized three screws being placed in the bone to keep it together. However, two screws did not hold, so another operation was needed to put in three new screws.

Once again, Bowie came back to play. On October 17, 1987, during pregame warmups for a preseason game with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Bowie began feeling intense pain in his right leg just walking. Not wanting a stretcher, Bowie was carried off the court by his teammates and was diagnosed with a hairline fracture of his right tibia. On March 29, 1988, Bowie had surgery where he received a graft from his hip bone and had a metal plate with 10 screws permanently attached to his right shin. The injury effectively sidelined him for the next two seasons; he missed all of the 1987–88 season, as well as the first 62 games of the 1988–89 season. All told, Bowie played 63 games out of a possible 328 during his last four seasons in Portland.

&quot;I have one huge regret,&quot; said Bowie. &quot;I wish I would&#x27;ve been more patient and didn&#x27;t come back as quickly as I did the second year I fractured my leg. You feel like you disappointed Portland. You&#x27;re getting paid a lot of money and you can&#x27;t play. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s guilt or regret. But I&#x27;ve never been one to say, &#x27;Why me?&#x27;. I feel I should have an MD behind my name from all the education I&#x27;ve received from my own cases.&quot;

===New Jersey Nets (1989–1993)===
On June 24, 1989, Bowie, who had averaged 10.5 points per game with the Trail Blazers, was traded, along with a draft pick, to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Buck Williams.

Bowie&#x27;s four seasons in New Jersey were his most productive, as he had no major injuries. Bowie averaged 12.8 points and 8.2 rebounds per game and never missed more than 20 games in a season. His best season was his first with the Nets where he averaged a double-double with 14.7 points and 10.1 rebounds per game. Bowie also hit a career-high in points per game in 1991–92 with 15.0 and played a career-high 79 games in 1992–93 averaging 9.1 points per game and seven rebounds.

&quot;My main objective is to play the game for the fun of it and the love of it,&quot; said Bowie, &quot;Every time I go off the court, I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t get hurt again. I think too many people take their health for granted.

A 2013 &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; article listed Bowie as the 17th greatest Nets player up till that point.

===Los Angeles Lakers (1993–1995)===
After the 1992–93 season, Bowie was traded for Benoit Benjamin, being sent from New Jersey to the Los Angeles Lakers. However, Bowie&#x27;s leg injury problems recurred. Bowie played in 92 games in the two seasons combined, starting in 17 of them. Although Jerry West, the team&#x27;s general manager, wanted Bowie to continue to play for the Lakers, Bowie decided to retire from professional basketball after the 1994–95 season. He desired to follow his passion and become involved in harness racing.

===Career overview===
Bowie, Bill Walton, and Greg Oden are frequently cited together. All three were centers, drafted high by Portland, who failed to achieve their potential due to career-altering injuries.

&quot;You know, I go speak and visit at hospitals a lot—and not to sound mushy—but I&#x27;ve seen 7-, 8-, 9-year-old kids who have had their legs amputated because of bone cancer or a car accident,&quot; Bowie said. &quot;That&#x27;s when it puts things into perspective. There&#x27;s a kid who wishes he had a leg to break. That&#x27;s when I realize how lucky I am. I can&#x27;t complain about the hand I&#x27;ve been dealt. Sure, I&#x27;ve had my share of surgery and broken bones, but these things were meant to be. I&#x27;m a Christian and I&#x27;ve always felt that tomorrow is predetermined and that you will never be put through more than you can handle.&quot;

Over his NBA career, Bowie averaged 10.9 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.78 blocks per game. He hit 45.2% of his attempted field goals (2,127 made of 4,702 attempted), and 30.2% of his three-point shots (32 made of 106 attempted).

==Post-basketball endeavors==
For a time, Bowie performed color commentary for University of Kentucky Basketball.

After he retired from basketball, Bowie returned to Lexington, Kentucky. Bowie is involved in harness racing, both owning and training horses that run at The Red Mile in Lexington.

==Personal life==
Bowie has been married twice. He has three now-grown children. &quot;I was blessed in the sense that I was able to be a full-time father.&quot; Bowie said.

Bowie married Stephanie Bowie in April 2018 in La Fortuna, Costa Rica.

In 2012, Bowie was featured in an ESPN &quot;SEC Storied&quot; documentary, &quot;Going Big&quot;. In it, he admitted hiding the extent of his leg troubles from the Blazers. For instance, he said that when a doctor tapped his left tibia with a mallet, he claimed not to feel anything when he was actually in noticeable pain. He developed leg trouble as early as high school; film from the late 1970s shows him struggling to avoid undue strain on his legs and feet.

==Honors==
* Bowie was inducted into the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005.
* Bowie&#x27;s number 31 was retired by Kentucky Basketball in 2002.

<text>Jill Esmond Moore (26 January 1908 – 28 July 1990) was an English stage and screen actress. 

==Early life==
Esmond was born in London, the daughter of stage actors Henry V. Esmond and Eva Moore. Dramatist W.S. Gilbert and actress Maxine Elliott were her godparents. One of her maternal aunts was Decima Moore. 

She had a brother Jack (an actor) and a sister, Lynette, who did not survive infancy.

While her parents toured with theatre companies, Esmond spent her childhood in boarding schools until she decided at the age of 14 to become an actress. She made her stage debut playing Wendy to Gladys Cooper&#x27;s Peter Pan, but her success was short-lived. When her father died suddenly in 1922, in Paris, due to pneumonia, Esmond returned to school and at the time considered abandoning her ambition to act. 

After reassessing her future and coming to terms with her father&#x27;s death, she studied with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and returned to the West End stage in 1924. In 1925, she starred with her mother in a play &quot;Mary, Mary Quite Contrary&quot;, and after a few more successful roles, won critical praise for her part as a young suicide in &quot;Outward Bound&quot;.

==Marriage and career==

In 1928, Esmond (billed as Jill Esmond Moore) appeared in the production of &quot;Bird in the Hand&quot;, where she met fellow cast member Laurence Olivier for the first time. Three weeks later, he proposed to her. In his autobiography Olivier later wrote that he was smitten with Esmond, and that her cool indifference to him did nothing but further his ardour. When &quot;Bird in the Hand&quot; was being staged on Broadway, Esmond was chosen to join the American production – but Olivier was not.

Determined to be near Esmond, Olivier travelled to New York City where he found work as an actor. Esmond won rave reviews for her performance. Olivier continued to follow Esmond, and after proposing to her several times, she agreed and the couple were married on 25 July 1930 at All Saints&#x27;, Margaret Street, London. Within weeks, the couple regretted their marriage. They had one son, Tarquin Olivier.

Returning to the United Kingdom, Esmond made her film debut with a starring role in an early Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;The Skin Game&quot; (1931), and over the next few years appeared in several British and (pre-Code) Hollywood films, including &quot;Thirteen Women&quot; (1932). She also appeared in two Broadway productions with Olivier, &quot;Private Lives&quot; in 1931 with Noël Coward and Gertrude Lawrence and &quot;The Green Bay Tree&quot; in 1933.

Esmond&#x27;s career continued to ascend while Olivier&#x27;s own career languished, but after a couple of years, when his career began to show promise, she began to refuse roles. Esmond had been promised a role by David O. Selznick in &quot;A Bill of Divorcement&quot; (1932) but at only half-salary. Olivier had discovered that Katharine Hepburn had been offered a much greater salary, and persuaded Esmond to turn down the role.

Esmond and Olivier starred together in one film, &quot;No Funny Business&quot; (1933), a British comedy film directed by Victor Hanbury.

In 1937, Esmond and Olivier appeared together in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; at London&#x27;s Old Vic theatre. During this period, their marriage was disintegrating, as Olivier had started a relationship with Vivien Leigh.

==Later years==
Esmond starred in the Broadway production of Emlyn Williams&#x27; play &quot;The Morning Star&quot; in 1942, a production which featured the acting debut of Gregory Peck. Her acting appearances grew more sporadic with the passage of time, and she made her final film appearance in 1955, around the time she made her two appearances as Eleanor of Aquitaine in the TV series &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;.

==Personal life==

Esmond was married to Olivier between 1930 and 1940; they had one son, Tarquin Olivier (born 21 August 1936). During their marriage, Olivier had affairs with Ann Todd and Vivien Leigh, the latter to whom he was married from 1940 to 1960. Olivier later said that &quot;I couldn&#x27;t help myself with Vivien. No man could. I hated myself for cheating on Jill, but then I had cheated before, but this was something different. This wasn&#x27;t just out of lust. This was love that I really didn&#x27;t ask for but was drawn into.&quot;

Esmond withstood the publicity of Olivier&#x27;s affair with Vivien Leigh and did not seek a divorce. Pressed by Olivier, who was anxious to marry Leigh, she eventually agreed and they were divorced on 29 January 1940. Among the films she appeared in are &quot;Journey for Margaret&quot;, &quot;The Pied Piper&quot; and &quot;Random Harvest&quot;, all in 1942, &quot;My Pal Wolf&quot; (1944), &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Bandit of Sherwood Forest&quot; (1946). In 1946, she returned to the UK where she resumed her acting; her last stage appearance was in 1950, and her last film in 1955.

To the end of his life, Olivier continued alimony payments to Esmond. Esmond kept in touch with Olivier, and in a letter to their son Tarquin, said &quot;It&#x27;s funny after all that time how I can still love him so much.&quot; Frail and in a wheelchair, she attended Olivier&#x27;s memorial service in October 1989 at Westminster Abbey.

==Death==
Esmond was 82 years old when she died on 28 July 1990 in Wandsworth, London.

<doc id="1292607" wikidata="Q7432340" url="?curid=1292607" title="School district drug policies">
<text>School district drug policies are measures that administrators of a school district put into place to discourage drug use by students.

==Background==
Over the decades of the War on Drugs in the United States, primary and secondary school drug and alcohol policies have become increasingly strict, in punishment and in the kinds of behavior regulated. Some school districts include off-campus and out-of-school behavior in their policy&#x27;s jurisdiction. These policies are frequently part of comprehensive &quot;Drug and alcohol&quot; policies, and are particularly common in urban school districts.

Aspects of the policies may include random drug testing, searches of lockers and personal effects, anti-drug education (e.g., &quot;Just Say No&quot; curricula), and punitive measures including expulsion and suspension.

Advocates of random drug testing argue that it is not just a punitive measure, but may deter drug use. Opponents, however, have argued that drugs commonly used by students, such as alcohol, MDMA, and prescription drugs are either not detected by the tests or are metabolized within a short period of time.

There are about 600 school districts in about 15,000 nationwide that use drug tests, according to officials from the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. White House officials liken drug testing to programs that screen for tuberculosis or other diseases, and said students who test positive don&#x27;t face criminal charges.

==Legal challenges==
Civil libertarians have raised concerns with these policies, citing student civil rights and student privacy as principle objections. These cases have resulted in a number of legal challenges in the United States, as well as in related case law (e.g., &quot;Morse v. Frederick&quot;, the so-called &quot;Bong Hits 4 Jesus&quot; case&quot;).

In a 1995 case, &quot;Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton&quot;, the Supreme Court upheld the legality of random drug tests of student athletes who were not suspected of drug use. The Court reasoned that because school athletes routinely face mandatory physicals and other similar invasions of privacy, they have lower expectations of privacy than the average student. The Court specified that its decision should not be seen as a justification for further expansion of drug testing programs.

In the 2002 case Board of Education v. Earls the Supreme Court extended the holding in &quot;Vernonia&quot;, holding that all students who participate in voluntary activities, like cheerleading, band, or debate, could be subjected to random tests as part of a comprehensive program. The Court, in an opinion by Justice Thomas, stated that the diminished expectations of privacy of athletes was less important to their decision in &quot;Vernonia&quot; than a school&#x27;s innate custodial responsibility and authority over its students.

In December 2009, a challenge was made to the Haddonfield, New Jersey, Board of Education&#x27;s 24/7 policy regulating drug and alcohol use of students outside of school property and off school time. The lawsuit contends that the Board of Education does not have the authority to discipline students unless the conduct in question has some connection to school safety and discipline. A federal judge denied a request to stop the policy because the student who filed the lawsuit had already graduated. In 2012, the plaintiff&#x27;s lawyer convinced a different judge to find that the school&#x27;s 24/7 policy was illegal and the judge found that Haddonfield’s policy fails to differentiate between off-campus offenses that simply break the law and those that affect the school district’s ability to provide a safe environment. The NJ Commissioner of Education then reviewed the policy. In 2013, after the Commissioner of Education ruled against the Haddonfield School Board, the Board voted to scrap the policy for good.

==Case study==
In late 2001, in Ashland, Oregon, the Ashland School Board enacted a Drug and Alcohol Policy for students in leadership positions, igniting a local controversy. The policy extended to off-campus and after-school conduct, but the controversy reached the general efficacy and constitutionality of drug testing policies.

Opposing the policy were local student groups and the local Oregon American Civil Liberties Union, which had advocated on behalf of various students expelled by the Ashland School District for drug use in May 2001 at a national forensics tournament. Students at Ashland High School argued that their off campus behavior after school hours should have no effect on their academic standing.

To resolve the dispute, a community committee was formed, meeting for five months. The committee&#x27;s recommendations led to a rewriting of the Code of Conduct and a re-evaluation of the School District&#x27;s entire Drug and Alcohol Policy.

<text>Brandon East () is a provincial electoral division in the province of Manitoba, Canada. It encompasses the southeastern part of the City of Brandon.

==Historical riding==
The original riding of Brandon East existed from 1886 to 1888, when the City and riding of Brandon was divided into two electoral districts for the first time. The city was re-established as a single riding in 1888.

==Current riding==
The modern riding of Brandon East was created in 1968, when the City of Brandon was again divided into two separate ridings. It has formally existed since the provincial election of 1969.

The riding borders on Brandon West to the west, and by Spruce Woods in all other directions. Brandon itself is the second-largest city in Manitoba (after Winnipeg), and is in the southwestern region of the province.

Brandon East&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,850. In 1999, the average family income was $40,233, and the unemployment rate was 8.60%. The service sector accounts for 19% of the riding&#x27;s industry, followed by retail trade at 15% and health and social services at 14%. Eleven per cent of the riding&#x27;s residents are aboriginal.

Brandon East had been a safe seat for the New Democratic Party since its re-creation. This changed at the 2016 election, in which Progressive Conservative candidate Len Isleifson defeated the NDP incumbent Drew Caldwell.

At the 2015 Canadian federal election, according to data from Elections Canada, Brandon East voted heavily Liberal. A provincial riding opinion poll in December 2015 showed Brandon East to be a marginal seat between the Conservative and Liberal parties, with the NDP trailing a poor third.

In the 2018 redistribution, the part of the riding north of the Assiniboine River was moved to Spruce Woods.

<doc id="1292614" wikidata="Q273509" url="?curid=1292614" title="Ellen Foley">
<text>Ellen Foley (born June 5, 1951) is an American singer and actress who has appeared on Broadway and television, where she co-starred in the hit NBC sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot; during its second season. In music, she has released five solo albums, but she is best known for her collaborations with rock singer Meat Loaf, particularly the 14× Platinum selling 1977 album &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Foley was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the daughter of John and Virginia B. Foley. She attended Webster University.

==Career==
===Vocalist===
Foley gained public recognition through singing a duet with Meat Loaf on the hit single &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; from the 1977 album &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;. Foley&#x27;s part was recorded individually and in one take with Meat Loaf present in the room so she could sing in character. Although Karla DeVito (who toured with Meat Loaf in support of the album) is featured in the music video, DeVito is lip synching to Foley&#x27;s vocals.

Her debut album &quot;Night Out&quot; was released in 1979; the album&#x27;s single &quot;What&#x27;s a Matter Baby&quot; reached No. 7 in the Dutch charts and No. 92 on the US charts. The single &quot;We Belong to the Night&quot; reached No.1 in the Netherlands. The album, which peaked at No. 152, was produced by Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson. Foley recorded a duet with Ian Hunter in 1980, &quot;We Gotta Get Outta Here&quot;. Her creative relationship with Hunter led her to singing backing vocals on the Iron City Houserockers&#x27; 1980 album &quot;Have a Good Time but Get Out Alive!&quot;, produced by Hunter, Ronson, and The E Street Band&#x27;s Steven Van Zandt.

She also sings in the title cut of the 1979 Blue Öyster Cult album &quot;Mirrors&quot; and on The Clash album &quot;Sandinista!&quot; (released in 1980) in the songs &quot;Hitsville UK&quot; and &quot;Corner Soul&quot;, and on the unreleased track &quot;Blonde Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. In 1981, all four members of The Clash appeared on her album &quot;The Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, and Mick Jones and Joe Strummer co-wrote a number of songs for the album. Jones produced the album, which featured members of The Blockheads and peaked at No. 137 on the US charts. In 1982, she provided backing vocals on The Clash&#x27;s song &quot;Car Jamming&quot; from the album &quot;Combat Rock&quot;. The Clash&#x27;s hit song &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot;, written and sung by Jones, was about the turbulent relationship he shared with Foley at the time.

She released her third solo album &quot;Another Breath&quot; in 1983; it failed to chart. In 1984, she sang backing vocals on Joe Jackson&#x27;s album &quot;Body &amp; Soul&quot; and had a large role in the music video for Utopia&#x27;s &quot;Crybaby&quot;.

Foley was one of four female vocalists to front the group Pandora&#x27;s Box, formed by Jim Steinman in the late 1980s. Their album &quot;Original Sin&quot;, released in 1989, was the first to feature the song &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; (vocals by Elaine Caswell); both Celine Dion and a duet between Meat Loaf and Marion Raven had separate chart successes with that song in some countries, years later.

===Broadway, film and television===
Foley studied acting at HB Studio in New York City. She has appeared on Broadway in such shows as &quot;Me and My Girl&quot; and the revival of &quot;Hair&quot;, and off-Broadway in &quot;Beehive&quot;. Foley originated the role of The Witch in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Into the Woods&quot; at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, but was replaced by Bernadette Peters before the musical opened on Broadway. Foley eventually played the role on Broadway from August 1, 1989 until the show&#x27;s closing on September 3, 1989.

Her best known television acting role is that of Billie Young on &quot;Night Court&quot; for season two (1984–85), after which she was succeeded by Markie Post as Christine Sullivan, who had been Reinhold Weege&#x27;s first choice for the public defender part, but Post had been unavailable while under contract on the television series &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; on ABC. Foley was reportedly let go from the series because producers felt her relationship with star Harry Anderson was more like that of a brother and sister than as potential paramours. She had roles in Miloš Forman&#x27;s film adaptation of the stage musical &quot;Hair&quot; (1979), as well as in the movies &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987), &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; (1988) and &quot;Cocktail&quot; (1988). Foley was in the short-lived 1977 series &quot;3 Girls 3&quot;, co-starring with Debbie Allen and Mimi Kennedy.

===Other pursuits===
In the mid-2000s, she taught voice at the School of Rock (founded by Paul Green) in Manhattan.

== Personal life ==
In 1990, Foley married writer Doug Bernstein, co-author of the Off-Broadway revue &quot;Showing Off&quot;. They have two children, Henry and Timothy.

<text>The Manual on Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, commonly known as the Istanbul Protocol, is the first set of international guidelines for documentation of torture and its consequences. It became an official United Nations document in 1999; the most recent revision was in June 2022.

The Istanbul Protocol is intended to serve as a set of international guidelines for the assessment of persons who allege torture and ill treatment, for investigating cases of alleged torture, and for reporting such findings to the judiciary and any other investigative body.

==Background and purpose==
The Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment contains internationally recognised standards and procedures on how to recognise and document symptoms of torture so the documentation may serve as valid evidence in court.

As such, the Istanbul Protocol provides useful guidance for doctors and lawyers who want to investigate whether or not a person has been tortured and report the findings to the judiciary and any other investigative bodies.

A revised, expanded version was published by the UN in June 2022.

===Non-binding document===

The Istanbul Protocol is a non-binding document. However, international law obliges governments to investigate and document incidents of torture and other forms of ill-treatment and to punish those responsible in a comprehensive, effective, prompt and impartial manner. The Istanbul Protocol is a tool for doing this.

The Istanbul Protocol was drafted by more than 75 experts in law, health and human rights during three years of collective effort. While the extensive work was initiated and coordinated by the Human Rights Foundation of Turkey (HRFT) and the Physicians for Human Rights USA (PHR USA), it involved more than 40 different organisations, such as the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims. 

The initial steps to work on a manual for the investigation and documentation of torture and other forms of ill treatment were taken at an international meeting in 1996 organised by the Turkish Medical Association and were inspired by the daily needs and practices experienced by the HRFT and the Society of Forensic Medicine Specialists in Turkey. In particular, the efforts to investigate the death of Baki Erdogan during custody became a decisive factor.

Baki Erdogan died during his 11th day in custody after having been transferred to the state hospital in Turkey. The autopsy and official forensic report stated that as a result of a 10-day hunger strike, he died of acute pulmonary oedema.

The Turkish Medical Association carried out an independent investigation and submitted an alternative medical report which disclosed numerous flaws in the autopsy and medical assessment made by the official medical experts.

The point of reference for the development of the alternative medical report was the Minnesota Protocol, the United Nations, Model Protocol for a Legal Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, Doc. ST/CSDHA/12, created in response to the conclusion of the Special Rapporteur on Summary or Arbitrary Executions, appointed by the Economic and Social Council in 1982.

The alternative report stressed that the official forensic investigation was deficient and false and not in accordance with the standards set out in the Minnesota Protocol. Furthermore, in light of the collected evidence and other findings, the cause of death was determined to be Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a result of the use of torture.

Upon finalisation of the Istanbul Protocol in 1999, an article on the Protocol was published in the international medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;.

The Istanbul Protocol is published by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in its Professional Training Series in the six official UN languages.

===International recognition of the Istanbul Protocol===

The Istanbul Protocol was submitted to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights on 9 August 1999. Both the UN General Assembly and the then UN Commission on Human Rights (since 2006, the UN Human Rights Council) have strongly encouraged states to reflect upon the Principles in the Protocol as a useful tool to combat torture.

The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture stressed in his General Recommendations of 2003 the importance of the Istanbul Principles in the context of establishing independent national authorities for investigation; promptness and independence of investigations; independence of forensic medical services by governmental investigatory bodies and obtaining forensic evidence.

On 23 April 2003, the UN Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution on human rights and forensic science, drew the attention of governments to these principles as a useful tool in combating torture. Likewise, reference was made to the Istanbul Protocol in the resolution on the competence of national investigative authorities in preventing torture.

In addition to recognition by the UN system, the Istanbul Protocol has also been adopted by several regional bodies.

The African Commission on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights deliberated on the importance of the Istanbul Protocol during its 32nd ordinary session in October 2002 and concluded that investigations of all allegations of torture or ill-treatment, shall be conducted promptly, impartially and effectively, and be guided by the Istanbul Principles.

The European Union has referred to the Istanbul Protocol in its &quot;Guidelines to EU Policy towards Third Countries on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment&quot; adopted by the General Affairs Council in 2001. The EU guidelines mention that states should &quot;“conduct prompt, impartial and effective investigations of all allegations of torture in accordance with the Istanbul Rules annexed to CHR resolution 2000/43”&quot; and should &quot;“establish and operate effective domestic procedures for responding to and investigating complaints and reports of torture and ill-treatment in accordance with the Istanbul Rules.”&quot;

Other institutions and organisations have reiterated the UN and other bodies’ recommendations in their reports, statements, and comments (including the Advisory Council of Jurists and the Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions). These references can roughly be summarised into three categories:

* References that cite the Istanbul Protocol as a useful tool in the efforts to combat torture and strongly encourage governments to reflect upon the principles contained in the Protocol; 
* References that stress that all investigations and documentation of torture allegations should be conducted promptly, impartially and effectively, and be guided by the Istanbul Principles;
* References that say that states should establish and operate effective domestic procedures for the investigation and documentation of torture allegations in accordance with the Istanbul Protocol.

<doc id="1292627" wikidata="Q7457155" url="?curid=1292627" title="Seven (Bob Seger album)">
<text>Seven is the seventh studio album by American rock singer-songwriter Bob Seger, released in 1974.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Seven&quot; was the first Seger album to feature &#x27;The Silver Bullet Band&#x27;, which he would steadily rely on for the rest of his career. The album gained notorious recognition and is a fan favorite despite its rarity. The very successful tour for this album was kicked off with Seger and his newly formed Silver Bullets as the opening act for Kiss. Kiss asked Seger and the band to support them for a few shows. After seeing the band&#x27;s first set, they offered Seger the rest of the tour, which gained the band much-needed recognition.

Early vinyl copies of the album featured the word &#x27;contrasts&#x27; at the bottom of the cover, leading people to believe the album had two titles. Others believed the album was titled &#x27;Seven Contrasts&#x27;. However, Contrasts is the name of the artwork featured on the album. The word in parentheses is simply a reference to the artwork rather than an actual subtitle or title of the record.

A later bootleg of the album released in the 1980s was entitled Seven Worlds.

== Reception ==
Although the album failed to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 albums chart, the single &quot;Get Out of Denver&quot; reached number 80 on the Pop Singles chart. Critics and longtime Seger fans tend to regard the album as a lost classic, much like its predecessor &quot;Back in &#x27;72&quot;. For example, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic retrospectively gave the album 5/5 stars, calling it &quot;one of [Seger&#x27;s] strongest, hardest-hitting rock records&quot;. Summing up, Erlewine wrote:

<doc id="1292635" wikidata="Q7432016" url="?curid=1292635" title="Schoharie Creek">
<text>Schoharie Creek is a river in New York that flows north from the foot of Indian Head Mountain in the Catskills through the Schoharie Valley to the Mohawk River. It is twice impounded north of Prattsville to create New York City&#x27;s Schoharie Reservoir and the Blenheim-Gilboa Power Project.

The Erie Canal crossed over the creek by an aqueduct at Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site.

Two notable bridge collapses have occurred on Schoharie Creek. In 1987, two spans of the New York State Thruway collapsed. On August 28, 2011, the covered Old Blenheim Bridge collapsed due to flooding from Hurricane Irene.

==Geography==

===Watershed and tributary streams===
Schoharie Creek is part of the drainage system of the Hudson River watershed and a direct tributary of the Mohawk River. Tributaries of Schoharie Creek, listed from upstream to downstream, include:

==== East side ====
* Gooseberry Creek
* Red Kill
* East Kill
* John Chase Brook
* Batavia Kill
* Hunterfield Creek
* Platter Kill
* Keyser Kill
* Little Schoharie Creek
* Stony Brook
* Fox Creek
* Bowman Creek

==== West side ====
* Roaring Kill
* Cook Brook
* West Kill
* Little West Kill
* Johnson Hollow Brook
* Bear Kill
* Mine Kill
* West Kill
* Cole Brook
* Panther Creek
* Pleasant Valley Creek
* Line Creek
* Cobleskill Creek
* Cripplebush Creek
* Fly Creek
* Wilsey Creek
* Irish Creek

==Watershed==
Before European colonization, the watershed was mostly forested with a few small areas cleared by Native Americans for hunting. Early European settlers attempted to farm the land, but soon abandoned it due to the short growing seasons, steep slopes and rocky soil. Between 1800 and the early 1900s, mills, the tanning industry, quarrying for bluestone, logging, railroads, and resorts cleared the Catskills of most of its forest cover.

Starting in the early 1900s, these industries began to decline and areas that were previously cleared have grown back into forest. As of 2001, approximately 85% of the Schoharie Creek&#x27;s watershed has been classified as forested.

==Hydrology==
===Water quality===
New York&#x27;s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) rates the water quality of Schoharie Creek in different sections. The section from Cobleskill Creek to Pleasant Valley Brook is rated Class C, which is most suitable for fishing, but can also be suitable for primary and secondary contact recreation.

Stream flow on the lower Schoharie is significantly influenced by the Schoharie Reservoir. Flow from the reservoir is restricted when the dam is not open, and the lack of flow mostly during the summer increases water temperature, which negatively affects the fishery. Also this section flows through an agricultural valley, which contributes to increased sediment in the creek. This increases streambank erosion and sediment loadings, and during high flows, cause the creek&#x27;s turbidity to increase. Biological tests were conducted in Fort Hunter in 2001, then in Burtonsville in 2001, and showed non-impacted water quality conditions at both sites.

===Discharge===
The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains many stream gauges along Schoharie Creek. The first station is east of Lexington in operation since 1999, had a maximum discharge of per second on August 28, 2011, as Hurricane Irene passed through the area, and a minimum discharge of per second on August 21–22, 2002. Another station by Prattsville in operation since 1902, upstream from Schoharie Reservoir, had a maximum discharge of per second on August 28, 2011, with no minimum discharge recorded.

Below the Schoharie Reservoir is the station by Gilboa in operation since October 1975, downstream from the Schoharie Reservoir dam, had a maximum discharge of per second on August 28, 2011, and a minimum discharge of per second on many days from June to October 1976, and September 11-13, 1980. Another station by North Blenheim in operation continuously since October 1970, upstream from bridge on State Highway 30 in North Blenheim, had a maximum discharge of per second on August 28, 2011, and a minimum discharge of per second on many days from June to October 1976, and September 11-13, 1980. The station by Breakabeen in operation since July 1975, downstream from Keyser Kill, had a maximum discharge of per second on August 28, 2011, and a minimum discharge of per second on October 14, 1988.
Further downstream the station by Middleburgh in operation from July 1927 to September 1939 and since December 2017, slightly downstream of the bridge at intersection of State Highways 30 and 145 in Middleburgh, had a maximum discharge of per second on March 18, 1936, and a minimum discharge of per second on September 1, 1939. Outside the period of record, it had an estimated maximum discharge of per second on August 28, 2011. The station in Schoharie is located upstream from bridge on County Highway 1A has been in operation since December 2017, takes gauge height measurements only. It had a maximum gauge height of on August 14, 2018 and a minimum gage height of on many days between September 22 and October 1 in 2019. The station in Esperance is located by the US Route 20 bridge has been in operation since December 2017, takes gauge height measurements only. It had a maximum gauge height of on April 15, 2019 and a minimum gage height of on July 22, 2018. Outside the period of record, the flood of August 2011 reached a stage of from floodmark. The station in Burtonsville in operation since October 1939, upstream from the mouth, had a maximum discharge of per second on August 29, 2011, and a minimum discharge of per second on September 24–25, 1964.

===Turbidity===
The USGS station along the creek near Burtonsville, collects turbidity data every 15 minutes. The maximum daily suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) mean was 1460 mg/L on June 14, 2013, and the minimum was 2 mg/L on October 1–2, 2014. On June 14, 2013, the maximum daily suspended sediment discharge was 48,400 tons () on June 14, 2013, and .16 tons () on October 1–2, 2014.

==History==
In the 18th century, areas of the south (or right bank) side of Mohawk Valley were sparsely settled in the face of the periodically warlike and always militant Iroquois peoples, who, while diminished by European diseases during colonial times still retained ample war powers after the French and Indian War ended in 1763. Reorganized by then as the Six Nations the tribes had conducted internecine war with other powerful eastern tribes until the 1770s, weakening or eliminating the power of the Delaware, the Susquehanna, and Shawnee tribes— affecting Amerindian populations and power both East and West of the Alleghenies as far south as northern Kentucky in the west, and southern Maryland in the east. By the end of the French and Indian War, they were the one remaining group of eastern native peoples that retained sufficient military power to give even the British authorities pause. Consequently, those authorities cultivated &quot;political arrangements&quot; with the Iroquois and as a prelude to the revolution, the British Crown acted to block trans-Appalachian settlements before the opening of the American Revolution, one of the lesser known grievances of many held by the settlers.
During the Revolution, farms in the valley acted as a breadbasket providing important food supplies to the Colonial forces. The lower Mohawk valley was a scene of uneasy native Amerindian–Colonial Settler contention throughout most of the 18th century until after the American Revolutionary War&#x27;s Sullivan Expedition pacified the region by permanently weakening the Six Nations of the Iroquois. That campaign was a direct result of two atrocities in the region: The May 1778 Battle of Cobleskill (or Cobleskill Creek Massacre) signaled a new guerrilla war offensive by mixed troops of Loyalists and members of the four Iroquois tribes allied to the British in 1778. The incursions resulted in three major raids with major loss of life ranging from Southern New York to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

===New York State Thruway bridge collapse===
On the morning of April 5, 1987, after 30 years of service, two spans of the New York State Thruway bridge over Schoharie Creek near Fort Hunter collapsed. Five vehicles fell into the flooded river, resulting in ten deaths. A subsequent investigation of the collapse determined the cause to be scour. At the time, the creek was higher and flowing faster than normal due to excessive rains in the area. Twelve hours before the Schoharie Creek Bridge collapsed due to heavy rainfall, the rush of water through the Blenheim-Gilboa Pumped Storage Power Project upstream hit a historic high. To cope with the overload, the dam released water into the Schoharie Creek according to the rate at which it was entering the reservoir from upstream, adding to the load in the creek. The segment of NY 5S near Fort Hunter was reconfigured to carry westbound Thruway traffic while the bridge was rebuilt. The eastbound replacement bridge was completed and fully open to traffic on December 7, 1987, and the westbound replacement bridge was opened on May 21, 1988.

===Old Blenheim Bridge===
The Old Blenheim Bridge, one of the longest and oldest single-span covered bridges in the world, formerly spanned the creek. The bridge was destroyed on August 28, 2011 by flooding resulting from Hurricane Irene.

<doc id="1292640" wikidata="Q547419" url="?curid=1292640" title="Philips van Almonde">
<text>Philips van Almonde (29 December 1644 – 6 January 1711) was a Dutch States Navy officer who served in his nation&#x27;s maritime conflicts of the 17th and early 18th centuries.

Philips was born in Den Briel, the son of Pieter Jansz van Almonde, a wealthy burgher. Van Almonde learned the maritime profession under his uncle, the frigate commander Jacob Cleidijck, becoming a cadet on his ship the &quot;Wapen van Dordrecht&quot; in 1661. He was appointed lieutenant in 1664 by the Admiralty of the Maze. During the Battle of Lowestoft in the Second Anglo-Dutch War he in 1665 took over command from his incapacitated uncle and was on return confirmed in his command on 14 August. He distinguished himself in the Four Days Battle of 11–14 June 1666, where Lieutenant-Admiral Michiel de Ruyter defeated a fleet under George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle. In 1667 he was made a full captain. In 1671 he was captain of the &quot;Harderwijk&quot;. 

On 6 October 1673, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War, he was made a Rear-Admiral, after having distinguished himself as captain of the &quot;Wassenaer&quot; in the Battle of Solebay and captain of the &quot;Delft&quot; during the Battle of Schooneveld and the Battle of Texel.

In 1674 Van Almonde on the &quot;Ridderschap van Holland&quot; carried out actions against the French west coast. The following year, he accompanied Tromp&#x27;s squadron in the Mediterranean. In late May and early June 1676 he commanded a squadron during the battles of Bornholm and Öland in the Baltic Sea as part of a Danish-Dutch fleet under Niels Juel and Cornelis Tromp. In the second battle the numerically superior Swedish navy was soundly defeated, granting naval supremacy to Denmark. In 1676, following De Ruyters&#x27; death, Van Almonde led the mediterranean fleet back to Holland. On 5 April 1684 he was appointed Vice-Admiral by the Admiralty of Amsterdam. During the Glorious Revolution he commanded the rear of stadtholder William III of Orange&#x27;s invasion fleet.
He achieved his greatest fame, however, during the War of the Grand Alliance (&quot;The War of the League of Augsburg&quot;), in which the Netherlands and their allies (&quot;The Grand Alliance&quot;) faced off against Louis XIV&#x27;s France. On 28 March 1692 he was made Lieutenant-Admiral. Van Almonde on &quot;De Prins&quot; commanded a squadron in the battle at La Hougue (also known as the Battle of Barfleur) on 29 May 1692. There he assisted in Admiral Edward Russell&#x27;s victory over the French, who were under the command of Tourville, by launching his long boats against the trapped French ships.

In 1702, during the War of the Spanish Succession, Van Almonde was behind a plan to seize richly-laden Spanish treasure galleons arriving from the West Indies. On 23 October, he convinced English Admiral Sir George Rooke to attack the treasure ships despite the lateness of the year and the fact that the vessels were protected by French ships-of-the-line. The Dutch and English forces in the Battle of Vigo Bay destroyed the enemy fleet in the harbor of Vigo. The English took four ships-of-the-line and six galleons, while the Dutch took six warships and five galleons that had been treasure-laden but were unloaded just before the attack. In 1706 he put down command of the Dutch fleet headed for Portugal upon hearing that he would be subordinate to an English Vice-Admiral. On 20 December 1708 he was transferred to his old Admiralty of the Maze at Rotterdam; as this was seen as the most ancient Dutch admiralty, the most honourable function in the Dutch fleet was now his.

Van Almonde later moved back to his Haaswyk estate at Oegstgeest, near Leyden, where he died on 6 January 1711. His memorial stands in the Katherine Church at Briel, where he was buried on 30 December 1712.

<doc id="1292667" wikidata="Q1794839" url="?curid=1292667" title="Beehive (New Zealand)">
<text>The Beehive () is the common name for the Executive Wing of New Zealand Parliament Buildings, located at the corner of Molesworth Street and Lambton Quay, Wellington. It is so-called because its shape is reminiscent of that of a traditional woven form of beehive known as a skep. It is registered as a Category I heritage building by Heritage New Zealand.

Construction began in 1969 and was completed in 1981. Since 1979, the building has housed the offices of government ministers. Thus, the name &quot;Beehive&quot; is closely linked with the New Zealand Government. It is often used as a metonym for the New Zealand leadership at large, with &quot;the 9th floor&quot; specifically referring to the office of the prime minister, which is based on that floor. Cabinet meets on the top floor.

==History==

In the 1960s the government proposed an extension of Parliament House, which had only been partly built in 1922. Prime Minister Keith Holyoake had wanted to complete the original plan, but the government architect persuaded him to approve a modern building which would house parliamentary offices. In 1964, English architect Basil Spence provided the original conceptual design of a round building rising in steps. The detailed architectural design was undertaken by the New Zealand government architect Fergus Sheppard, and structural design of the building was undertaken by the Ministry of Works. W. M. Angus constructed the first stage, beginning in 1969the podium, underground car park and basement for a national civil defence centre. Gibson O&#x27;Connor constructed the ten floors of the remainder of the building.
Bellamy&#x27;s catering facilities moved into the building in the summer of 1975–1976 and Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, unveiled a plaque in the reception hall in February 1977. The Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, formally opened the building in May 1977. The government moved into the upper floors in 1979. The annexe facing Museum Street was completed in 1981.

In the late 1990s, there was consideration of moving the Beehive behind Parliament House and finishing Parliament House according to the 1911 original plans. The plan was scuttled due to public outcry at the cost. Renovations were carried out and the interior was modernised between 1998 and 2006 to plans by Christchurch architecture firm Warren and Mahoney. In 2013 and 2014, the roof was repaired and windows replaced.

In July 2015, Heritage New Zealand declared the Beehive &quot;of outstanding heritage significance for its central role in the governance of New Zealand&quot;. Blyss Wagstaff of Heritage New Zealand called it &quot;one of the most recognisable buildings in the country&quot;. Heritage New Zealand assigned the highest rating for a historic place, Category I, to the building. The original application for the heritage designation was made by Lockwood Smith, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives. The heritage registration with the list number 9629 became effective on 24 July 2015. The tunnel to Bowen House is specifically excluded from the heritage registration.

==Facts and figures==
The building is ten storeys () high and has four floors below ground. The entrance foyer&#x27;s core is decorated with marble floors, stainless steel mesh wall panels, the columns clad in Takaka marble and a translucent glass ceiling.

The Beehive&#x27;s brown roof is made from of hand-welted and seamed copper. It has developed a naturally weathered appearance. A tunnel runs under Bowen Street from The Beehive to parliamentary offices in Bowen House.

The Beehive&#x27;s circular footprint (see rotunda) is generally considered an elegant and distinctive design feature. However it also causes problems, as many of its rooms are wedge-shaped, curved or asymmetrical. An extension has been built at the front to allow for a new security entrance. A new, bomb-proof mail delivery room has already been built at the rear of the building.

The Beehive has, since 1992, featured as part of the design of the New Zealand twenty-dollar note. A survey commissioned by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand found that the Beehive is &quot;a New Zealand icon and as such is readily recognisable&quot;.

===Art work===
The Beehive is extensively decorated with New Zealand art and was designed to showcase the country&#x27;s creative artists. On the inner wall of the Banquet Hall is a mural by John Drawbridge long and high portraying the atmosphere and sky of New Zealand. The foyer contains a textile wall hanging &quot;Forest in the Sun&quot; by Joan Calvert and Guy Ngan which was commissioned for the building. It was hung in 1977 when the Queen opened the building, removed in 2003 during refurbishments and re-hung in 2023.

==Offices and facilities==

The top floor is occupied by the Cabinet room, with the prime minister&#x27;s offices directly beneath on the ninth floor (and part of the eighth). The upper portion of the Beehive also contains the offices of other ministers; senior ministers are situated at proximity to the prime minister&#x27;s office according to their ranking in Cabinet. The seniority of a minister is reflected in how far up the building they are. Some ministers, especially junior ministers, are instead based in Bowen House.

Other facilities within the building include function rooms and a banqueting hall on the first floor of the Beehive, which is the largest function room in the parliamentary complex. The parliamentary catering facilities of &quot;Bellamy’s&quot; include a bar known as &quot;Pickwicks&quot; or &quot;3.2&quot; (due to its position in the building on the third floor and second corridor), &quot;Copperfield&#x27;s&quot; café, and the &quot;Member&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Member&#x27;s and Guests&quot; restaurants. The building also houses, in its basement, the country&#x27;s National Crisis Management Centre. The Beehive contains a theatrette, commonly used for government press conferences. Other facilities include a gym and a swimming pool. The building is also used by members of Parliament who hold meetings or are discussing bills or new laws.

==Public access==
The New Zealand Parliament has a visitor centre located on the ground floor of the Beehive. Tours were suspended in 2020 to limit the spread of COVID-19. The public gallery and select committee meetings remained open to the public, subject to review.

<text>Brandon West () is a provincial electoral division in the province of Manitoba, Canada. It encompasses the southwestern part of the City of Brandon.

==History of the riding==
The original riding of Brandon West existed from 1886 to 1888, after the city and riding of Brandon was divided into two electoral divisions. It was eliminated in 1888, when the city became a single division again.

The modern riding of Brandon West was created in 1968, when the City of Brandon was again divided into two electoral districts. It was formally brought into being in the provincial election of 1969.

The riding is surrounded by Brandon East to the east and by Spruce Woods in all other directions. The City of Brandon itself is located in the southwestern region of the province.

The riding&#x27;s population in 1996 was 19,808. In 1999, the average family income was $56,860, and the unemployment rate was 6.30%. The service sector accounts for 16% of industry in the riding, followed by health and social services at 15%.

Brandon West includes the more affluent section of Brandon, and has usually elected Progressive Conservative members. It was sometimes said that Brandon West voters elected Tories and Brandon East voters elected New Democrats to ensure that the city would have a member on the government side regardless of the provincial outcome.

Scott Smith of the New Democratic Party won the seat in 1999, and retained it with over 60% of the vote in 2003. He lost the seat in 2007 to Progressive Conservative candidate Rick Borotsik by just 56 votes.

In the 2018 redistribution, the part of the riding north of the Assiniboine River was moved to Spruce Woods.

<text>Banco Itaú Unibanco S.A. is a Brazilian financial services company headquartered in São Paulo, Brazil. 
Itaú Unibanco was formed through the merger of Banco Itaú and Unibanco in 2008. It is the largest banking institution in Brazil, as well as the largest in Latin America, and the seventy-third largest bank in the world. The bank is listed on the B3 in São Paulo and in NYSE in New York.

Itaú Unibanco has operations in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Paraguay, United States and Uruguay in the Americas, as well as in Luxembourg, Portugal, Switzerland and the United Kingdom in Europe; China, Hong Kong, Japan and United Arab Emirates in Asia. It has over 33,000 service points globally, including 4,335 branches in Brazil and 55 million customers globally.

Itaúsa, a large Brazilian conglomerate ranking among Fortune magazine&#x27;s top 500 corporations in the world, serves as the parent company. Outside Brazil, Itaú Unibanco has offices in Asunción, Buenos Aires, Cayman Islands, Dubai, Hong Kong, Lisbon, London, Luxembourg, Montevideo, Nassau, New York, Miami, Santiago, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Zürich.

== History ==
In September 2006, Banco Itaú bought BankBoston&#x27;s assets in Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay.

On November 4, 2008, Banco Itaú and Unibanco announced the merger that resulted in Banco Itaú Unibanco. The institution was born with R$575 billion in assets, a net equity of around R$51.7 billion and a portfolio of combined credit of R$225.3 billion. The new bank had 4,800 branches and service branches, representing 18% of Brazil&#x27;s banking network, and 14.5 million account holders (18% of the market). In terms of credit volume, it represented 19% of the Brazilian system and in total deposits, funds and managed portfolios, 21% by 2008. In the insurance and pension plan market, the new group had a 17% and 24% share, respectively. The wholesale operations (corporate) totaled more than R$65 billion, serving more than 2,000 economic groups in Brazil. The private banking (wealth management) business had become the largest in Latin America, with approximately R$90 billion in assets under management. 

On August 22, 2009, Banco Itaú Unibanco and insurance company Porto Seguro announced their alliance. The alliance combined residential and automobile insurance operations and included an operating agreement that provided exclusive access to offer homeowner and vehicle insurance products to clients of Banco Itaú Unibanco in Brazil and Uruguay.

In June 2013, the bank agreed to buy Citibank Uruguay&#x27;s retail banking operations. 

In 2014, Banco Itaú announced that it was merging with Chilean bank Corpbanca. As a result, Itaú bought Helm Bank, Corpbanca&#x27;s operation in Colombia and Panama, and rebranded it under the Itaú name.

<doc id="1292713" wikidata="Q5302752" url="?curid=1292713" title="Dowling v. United States (1985)">
<text>Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207 (1985), was a United States Supreme Court case that discussed whether copies of copyrighted works could be regarded as stolen property for the purposes of a law which criminalized the interstate transportation of property that had been &quot;stolen, converted or taken by fraud&quot; and holding that they could not be so regarded under that law.

==Background==
Paul Edmond Dowling ran a bootleg recording business distributing Elvis Presley records through the United States Postal Service. Dowling, a zealous Presley fan, worked with William Samuel Theaker to produce records of unreleased Presley recordings such as those from concerts and television shows. The two men used the services of a record-pressing company in Burbank, Los Angeles County, California.

==Dowling&#x27;s trial and appeals==
The federal government brought its initial case against Dowling in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, arguing his guilt on the basis that he had no legal authority to distribute the records. Dowling was convicted of one count of conspiracy to transport stolen property in interstate commerce, eight counts of interstate transportation of stolen property, nine counts of copyright infringement, and three counts of mail fraud. The charges of mail fraud arose out of his use of the United States Postal Service to distribute the records.

Dowling appealed all convictions besides those of copyright infringement and the case moved to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he argued that the goods he was distributing were not &quot;stolen, converted or taken by fraud&quot;, according to the language of 18 U.S.C. 2314 - the interstate transportation statute under which he was convicted. The court disagreed, affirming the original decision and upholding the conviction. Dowling then took the case to the Supreme Court, which sided with his argument and reversed the convictions.

<text>Solidarity Youth Movement Kerala is the youth wing of the Islamic organisation Jamaat-e-Islami Hind in the state of Kerala in India. The movement&#x27;s stated objective is to &quot;liberate the generation of youths from moral bankruptcy and debauchery and to transform them into a radical vanguard fighting for the betterment of society&quot;. It, along with its parent organisation Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, has shared common ground with India&#x27;s left-wing parties on issues related to Indo-US relations and globalisation. The organisation has brought to mainstream the issues concerned with the marginalized communities. Solidarity Youth Movement have also initiated legal battles against controversial legislations like NIA.

==History==
The Students Islamic Organisation of India is the youth and student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind all across India. In 2002, the Kerala chapter of the organisation decided to transform SIO into a completely student organisation in Kerala and launch a new wing for the youth. Solidarity Youth Movement, Kerala was thus formed on 13 May 2003 at Muthalakulam Grounds, Calicut. Dr Koottil Mohammed Ali was elected as its first state president and Hameed Vaniyambalam its General Secretary. It held its first state conference at Palakkad on 23 April 2005. The organisational structure today includes 14 district committees, 110 area committees and more than 1000 individual units across the state of Kerala.

The movement played an influential role in bringing into public attention the grassroots struggle against the Coca-Cola factory at Plachimada, Palakkad and campaigned to boycott Coca-Cola in areas where it commands considerable influence.
It led the agitation against a proposed Express Highway by the Kerala Government and views privatisation of roads as a &quot;system which denies it for the underprivileged by levying tolls on the roads &quot;. It also opposes the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) system of road development, and recommends an &quot;all inclusive development of railway and waterway supported by good roads&quot; as the solution for developing the transportation infrastructure of Kerala.

<doc id="1292737" wikidata="Q7332171" url="?curid=1292737" title="Ricky Ray Rector">
<text>Ricky Ray Rector (January 12, 1950 – January 24, 1992) was an American convicted murderer who was executed for the 1981 murder of police officer Bob Martin in Conway, Arkansas. After killing a man in a restaurant and fleeing, Rector spent three days on the run before he agreed to turn himself in. However, instead of giving himself up, he shot the police officer who had negotiated his surrender in the back. He then shot himself in the head in a suicide attempt. The attempt effectively resulted in a lobotomy.

A 1991 request for a writ of &quot;certiorari&quot; to the Supreme Court was denied, with Justice Thurgood Marshall dissenting. Despite Rector&#x27;s mental state, then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton made a point of returning to Arkansas to personally handle Rector&#x27;s case during the 1992 U.S. presidential election campaign.

== Early life ==
Rector was born and raised in Conway, Arkansas, as the sixth of seven children to steakhouse cook George Rector and college dorm maid Clyde Lee Rector. As a child, Rector was described as &quot;different and strange&quot;, having no friends and keeping to himself, most often sitting under a tree to play with branches. Rector was physically abused by his father, who saw his son&#x27;s languid behavior as defiance. Though normally introverted and docile, Rector would react violently if bothered, once stabbing his brother in the foot with a pair of scissors for taunting him.

By the time he entered junior high school, Rector possessed only third-grade level writing skills, which was later ascribed to an undiagnosed learning disability. By age 17, Rector developed severe anger issues and regularly got into fights, reportedly due to a mix of insecurity about his poor academic performance, insults about his perceived lack of intelligence by classmates and abusive racial remarks from white townsfolk.

After Rector was expelled from school in tenth grade for fighting, he began working as a blue-collar laborer in construction, often shuffling between Conway and Detroit. Rector married during this timeframe and had several children, both from his wife and extramarital affairs. His criminal record included disorderly conduct, possession of marijuana with intent to sell, assault and battery, grand larceny, forgery, and assault with intent to kill; all charges either led to monetary fines or were dismissed with prejudice.

==Murders and trial==
On March 21, 1981, Rector and some friends drove to a dance hall at Tommy&#x27;s Old-Fashioned Home-Style Restaurant in Conway. When one friend who could not pay the $3 cover charge was refused entry, Rector became incensed and pulled a .38 caliber pistol from his waist band. He fired several shots, killing 33-year-old Arthur D. Criswell, who died almost instantly after being struck in the throat and forehead, also wounding 52-year-old William Hervey and his 23-year-old son Charles. Rector left the scene of the murder in a friend&#x27;s car and wandered the city for three days, staying in the woods or with relatives.

On March 24, Rector&#x27;s sister convinced him to turn himself in. Rector agreed to surrender, but only to Robert Martin, a local police officer whom he had known since he was a child. Martin arrived at Rector&#x27;s mother&#x27;s home shortly after 3 p.m. and chatted with Rector&#x27;s mother and sister. Shortly thereafter, Rector arrived and greeted Martin. As Martin turned away to continue his conversation with Rector&#x27;s mother, Rector drew his pistol from under his shirt and fired two shots into Martin, striking him in the jaw and neck. Martin became the first officer of the Conway Police Department to die in the line of duty. Rector then turned and walked out of the house.

Once he had walked past his mother&#x27;s backyard, Rector put his gun to his own temple and fired. Rector was quickly discovered by other police officers and taken to the local hospital. The shot had destroyed Rector&#x27;s frontal lobe.

Rector survived the suicide attempt and was put on trial for the first-degree murders of Criswell and Martin, as well as first-degree battery of the Herveys. His defense attorneys argued that Rector was intellectually impaired and not competent to stand trial. However, after hearing conflicting testimony from several experts who had evaluated Rector, Judge George F. Hartje ruled that Rector was competent to stand trial. Rector was convicted on both counts and sentenced to death by the jury.

==Execution==
Rector was subject to a unique overlap of controversies in 1992, during his execution in Arkansas. An oft-cited example of his mental insufficiency is his decision to save the dessert from his last meal &quot;for later,&quot; which would have been after his execution. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the execution of people with intellectual disabilities in &quot;Atkins v. Virginia&quot;, ruling that the practice constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.

===Last meal===
For his last meal, Rector requested and received a steak, fried chicken, cherry Kool-Aid, and pecan pie. As noted above, Rector left the pie on the side of the tray, telling the corrections officers who came to take him to the execution chamber that he was &quot;saving it for later.&quot; The slice of pecan pie was not disposed of until Rector had been executed.

===Execution===
Rector was executed by lethal injection. It took medical staff more than fifty minutes to find a suitable vein. The curtain remained closed between Rector and the witnesses, but some reported they could hear Rector moaning. The administrator of the State Department of Corrections Medical Program said &quot;the moans did come as a team of two medical people—that had grown to five—worked on both sides of his body to find a vein. That may have contributed to his occasional outbursts.&quot; The state later attributed the difficulty in finding a suitable vein to Rector&#x27;s great weight and to his having been administered an antipsychotic medication.

Rector was the third person executed by the state of Arkansas since &quot;Furman v. Georgia&quot;, after new capital punishment laws were passed in Arkansas, which came into force on March 23, 1973.

===Role in 1992 presidential campaign===
By 1992, Bill Clinton was insisting that Democrats &quot;should no longer feel guilty about protecting the innocent&quot; and indicated his support of capital punishment. To make his point, he flew home to Arkansas mid-campaign to affirm that the execution would continue as scheduled. Some pundits considered it a turning point in that race, hardening a soft public image. Others tend to cite the execution as an example of what they perceive to be Clinton&#x27;s opportunism, directly influenced by the failed presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis, who was labeled by Republicans as too soft on crime.

Clinton&#x27;s critics from the anti-capital punishment sector have seen the case of Rector as an unpleasant example of what they view as Clinton&#x27;s cynical careerism. The writer Christopher Hitchens, in particular, devotes much of a chapter of his book on Clinton, &quot;No One Left to Lie To&quot;, to what he regards as the immorality of the then Democratic candidate&#x27;s decision to condone, and take political advantage of, Rector&#x27;s execution. Hitchens argues that among other actions, Clinton was attempting to deflect attention from the ongoing Gennifer Flowers sex scandal.

<text>Sarah Douglas (born 12 December 1952) is an English actress. She is perhaps best known for having played the Kryptonian supervillain Ursa in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980), and she is also known for her roles as Queen Taramis in the sword-and-sorcery epic fantasy film &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984), Pamela Lynch in the primetime drama series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; (1983–85), and Jindah Kol Rozz in &quot;Supergirl&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Douglas was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, the second daughter of Beryl ( Smith), a physiotherapist who often worked upon RSC actors, and Edward Douglas, a career member of the Royal Air Force. She attended Alcester Grammar School before training with the National Youth Theatre and the Rose Bruford College.

Eventually, Douglas&#x27;s career took her in front of the camera with small appearances in the 1973 film &quot;The Final Programme&quot; (alternatively known as &quot;The Last Days of Man on Earth&quot;) and &quot;Rollerball&quot; in 1975. After this, she became known to British television audiences in the 1970s by appearing in &quot;The Howerd Confessions&quot;, the 1973 television edition of &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Inheritors&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Saint&quot;, and appeared in the film &quot;The People That Time Forgot&quot; (1977) and the controversial film &quot;The Brute&quot; (1977), in which she played an abused wife.

After an intensive casting call in which she beat out over 600 actresses for the part, including Caroline Munro and Marilu Tolo, Douglas secured her first major feature film role as the supporting antagonist Ursa in &quot;Superman&quot; (1978) and &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980); her performance garnered critical acclaim and became her signature role. She then accepted the role of the main antagonist Queen Taramis opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, Grace Jones and Maryam d&#x27;Abo in the sword-and-sorcery epic fantasy film &quot;Conan the Destroyer&quot; (1984).

Douglas also continued to appear on television, and was a series regular in the short-lived British sitcom &quot;Thundercloud&quot; in 1979. Throughout the 1980s, she went on to appear in a variety of guest roles in UK and US series such as &quot;The Professionals&quot;, &quot;Bergerac&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; and &quot;Remington Steele&quot;. However, her most prominent television role was that of Pamela Lynch in the primetime soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, which she played for two seasons from 1983 to 1985. She also played Pamela in the 1984 television miniseries &quot;V: The Final Battle&quot; and portrayed supporting characters in &quot;The Return of Swamp Thing&quot; (1989), &quot;Beastmaster 2: Through the Portal of Time&quot; (1991) and &quot;Return of the Living Dead 3&quot; (1993) among others.

In the 1990s, she returned to science fiction, guest starring in &quot;Babylon 5&quot; (in the 1994 episode &quot;Deathwalker&quot;), and in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (in the 1998 two-part episode &quot;The Tok&#x27;ra&quot;).

<doc id="1292785" wikidata="Q5330486" url="?curid=1292785" title="Eastern Standard Tribe">
<text>Eastern Standard Tribe is a 2004 science fiction novel by Canadian writer Cory Doctorow. Like Doctorow&#x27;s first two books, the entire text was released under a Creative Commons license on Doctorow&#x27;s website, allowing the whole text of the book to be read for free and distributed without the publisher&#x27;s permission.

==Plot summary==
The novel takes place in a world where online &quot;tribes&quot; form, where all members set their circadian rhythms to the same time zone even though members may be physically located throughout the world.

The protagonist, Art Berry, has been sent to an insane asylum as a result of a complex conspiracy. Told mostly in flashbacks, Art explains that he works in London as a consultant for the Greenwich 0 tribe. In reality, though, both he and his associate Fede are in fact double-agents for the Eastern Standard Tribe. Despite his talents as a human experience engineer, Art delivers subtly flawed proposals to the GMT tribe in order to undermine them and enable his own tribe to get a coveted contract.

He meets a girl, Linda, after he hits her with his car at 3am. Art has an idea for peer-to-peer music sharing between automobiles, and plans to give it to the EST (taking a cut to himself). However, his girlfriend meets his coworker, Fede, and they plan to double cross the EST and sell the idea to another tribe. Knowing Art won&#x27;t approve of the plan, they do it behind his back.

Fede later claims he would have cut Art in on the deal afterwards. However, Art figures out what is going on, and as a result they have him committed to an insane asylum to protect their plot.

The book alternates between two points of view: Art meeting Linda in London, and Art in the asylum. The London plot culminates in his attack on Fede when he discovers his betrayal. The asylum plot takes place after his attack on Fede, and culminates in his escape from the asylum and founding of a new company to market health care products using his inside knowledge of psychiatric institutions.

==Literary significance and reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; described this novel in their review as &quot;A near-future yarn that would have worked better as a piece of speculative nonfiction.&quot; Regina Schroeder in reviewing for &quot;Booklist&quot; said that &quot;Doctorow’s fast, bizarre follow-up to &quot;Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom&quot; is a reaction to the impact of instant global communication in which it is hard to tell whether the phenomena being reacted to have actually been observed or are the consequences of his imagination.&quot;

Don D&#x27;Ammassa in his review for &quot;Chronicle&quot; addressed satire in science fiction saying &quot;There was a time when broad satires had an honored place in SF, but that has changed over the course of years, and now novelists have to slip their satire in around an otherwise serious story most of the time. Cory Doctorow pushes the envelope a bit, because very little of the present story is particularly serious, but the satire is done with so light a touch that it&#x27;s not intrusive at all.&quot; He described the novel as &quot;funny and superficially lightweight, but when you&#x27;re done, you might find yourself subject to troubling afterthoughts.&quot;

<doc id="1292792" wikidata="Q7282157" url="?curid=1292792" title="Rafael Godoy">
<text>Rafael Godoy Lozano (24 October 1907 – 14 March 1973) was a well-known Colombian composer born in Natagaima, Tolima.

== Biography ==
From a young age, he was linked to the trade-union movement in Barrancabermeja, Santander, from where he had to emigrate when his personal security was threatened. He fled to Venezuela, where he developed his musical career and composed what are often taken to be his best musical pieces.

His most widely known, and possibly best song, is the bambuco &quot;Soy colombiano&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m Colombian&quot;); he composed many other less-known bambucos and andean music songs, such as &quot;Arrunchaditos&quot;, &quot;Pasito&quot;, &quot;Mi cafetal&quot;, &quot;Canto a Colombia&quot;, &quot;Tierra caliente&quot; and many others.

Many versions of &quot;Soy colombiano&quot; have appeared since it was composed, even a vallenato version by Lisandro Meza, although the most popular version is the one from the Tolimense folk music duet Garzón y Collazos.

Rafael Godoy died in Caracas, Venezuela, on March 14, 1973 at the age of 65.

<doc id="1292793" wikidata="Q973513" url="?curid=1292793" title="Palhoça">
<text>Palhoça is a municipality in Santa Catarina, Brazil.

==History==
Palhoça was founded in 1793, when the city was part of the way between Lages and Florianópolis in order to protect the capital state from possible invasions. Its name comes from &quot;straw roof&quot;, named such because of the large number of houses with this kind of roof when the first Palhoça citizens were natives.

==Geography==

Palhoça is located in the greater Florianópolis region. It is bordered on the north by São José, on the west by Santo Amaro da Imperatriz, on the south by Paulo Lopes, on the east by Santa Catarina Island south bay and on the southeast by the Atlantic Ocean.

Its coast consists of a long mangrove and beaches on the south.

The municipality contains part of the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park, a protected area created in 1975. The lushly-forested park protects the sources of the Vargem do Braço, Cubatão and D&#x27;Una rivers, which supply most of the drinking water for greater Florianópolis and the south coast region. The highest point of the city is Cambirela mountain, located in the state park.

==Economy==
The most important industries of the city are located in the industrial area in the neighborhood of Jardim Eldorado. The commerce plays an important role mainly in the Ponte do Imaruim and downtown, although Pagani started to become important for the city&#x27;s economy since the City Hall and the City Chamber moved there in 2005. The south region has developed tourism and fishing as a way to improve the local economy since this region is not so integrated to the rest of the city due to geographical and political reasons.

The economy has been growing, and an important national clothing company and a multinational beverage company have built their centers of distribution in Palhoça. A shopping mall was inaugurated in 2010 together with a large supermarket, a hotel, and recently a middle-sized department store downtown. For that reasons, the number of jobs has increased.

New private neighborhoods have been built, concerned about natural preservation and quality of life, increasing the number of the population and jobs opportunities.

==Transportation==
BR-282 highway connects the city with Santo Amaro da Imperatriz while BR-101 connects Palhoça with São José and Paulo Lopes.

The bus is the only means of public transportation in Palhoça. Jotur, Imperatriz and Paulo Lopes are the bus companies that operate in Palhoça.

<doc id="1292803" wikidata="Q2069121" url="?curid=1292803" title="Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines">
<text>The Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines was a railroad that operated in South Jersey in the 20th century. It was created in 1933 as a joint consolidation venture between two competing railroads in the region: the Pennsylvania Railroad and the Reading Company.

== History ==
In the early 20th century, Atlantic City and the South Jersey seashore were major seaside vacation destinations for Philadelphia area residents. The popularity of South Jersey&#x27;s seashore was made possible by rail transport, which provided inexpensive and fast service between the Philadelphia area&#x27;s population centers and shore points.

There were two competing railroad companies connecting Camden and, by ferry, Philadelphia, with the South Jersey seashore.
Competition was fierce and by its height in the 1920s competition between the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad (WJ&amp;S), owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and the Atlantic City Railroad, owned by the Philadelphia and Reading Railway, was so intense that at one time both lines boasted some of the fastest trains in the world.
Trains often raced one another so as to be the first to arrive at their destination. Racing was encouraged by the fact that in many areas, the two lines were only several hundred feet apart. On the Cape May lines, the trains were in sight of each other for 11 miles between Cape May Court House and Cape May. Over the last 5 miles into Cape May, the tracks were only 50 feet apart.

On July 1, 1926, the Benjamin Franklin Bridge opened, spanning the Delaware River, connecting Philadelphia and Camden. Car, truck, and bus usage increased as the state built roads in the 1920s and 30s next to the railroads going from Camden to the shore, cutting into profits.
On March 4, 1931, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) ordered the two companies to join their southern New Jersey lines into one company. The &quot;Consolidation Agreement&quot; decreed that the Pennsylvania Railroad had two-thirds ownership, and the Reading Company had one-third ownership.
Following World War II, the rise of automobile use, the completion of the Atlantic City Expressway, and growing popularity of air travel led to a reduction in rail use. Increased air travel also led some to abandon Atlantic City for more exotic vacation destinations, including Florida. By the late 1960s, the surviving former Camden and Atlantic City Main Line was reduced to a commuter service funded by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) running trains of Budd RDC railcars operating from a small terminal at Lindenwold PATCO station and Atlantic City.

While the P-RSL did not enter bankruptcy, its owners, the Penn Central, successor to the Pennsylvania, did. The Reading filed bankruptcy a few years after the Penn Central. As a result, Conrail took over the P-RSL on April 1, 1976.

===West Jersey and Seashore Railroad===

Effective May 4, 1896, the Pennsylvania Railroad consolidated all of its railroads and several smaller properties in South Jersey into the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad. The WJ&amp;S had lines coming from its Federal Street Terminal in Camden.

The &quot;Main Line&quot; ran to Atlantic City and to other shore points via Winslow Junction, and its line via Woodbury to Millville. It was electrified with 650 volt DC third rail and overhead lines, with branches going to Salem, and Deep Water Point from Woodbury, and Bridgeton from Glassboro.

While the WJ&amp;S line via Woodbury was a pioneering example of railroad electrification, electric multiple unit (MU) service between Newfield and Atlantic City ended September 26, 1931. The PRSL only inherited the electrified Millville–Camden commuter rail service from WJ&amp;S.

===Atlantic City Railroad===

Effective April 1, 1889, the Philadelphia and Reading Railway consolidated all of its railroads in Southern New Jersey into the Atlantic City Railroad (ACRR).

The ACRR, a subsidiary of the Reading Company, had one line from its Kaighn&#x27;s Point Terminal going to Winslow Junction with lines splitting off to Atlantic City, Ocean City, Wildwood, and Cape May. Branch lines included the Gloucester Branch to Grenloch, and the Willamstown Branch from Willamstown Junction (on the Atlantic City Main) to Mullica Hill to the south, and Atco to the north.

On July 15, 1933, The WJ&amp;S was leased by the ACRR, and changed its name to Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines, as the Consolidation Agreement had decreed.

==Equipment==

===Steam===

The 21 steam locomotives owned by the PRSL were from the PRR subsidiary WJ&amp;S. They all consisted of PRR classes. Before dieselization the PRSL was more apt to lease its motive power from either of its parent railroads as it completely lacked any heavy passenger locomotives (like 4-6-2 Pacifics). As its parent railroads began to replace steam with diesel locomotives, the PRSL became a haven for steam locomotives during their final years of operation.

==== Class B: 0-6-0 ====
The 0-6-0 type was assigned class B, and was used in switcher service.
* B-6sb
* B8

====Class E: 4-4-2====
The 4-4-2 &quot;Atlantic&quot; type was assigned class E. and was used in passenger service.
* E-3sb
* E6s

====Class G: 4-6-0====
The 4-6-0 &quot;Ten-Wheeler&quot; type was assigned class G. and was used in passenger service.
* G5s

==== Class H: 2-8-0 ====
The 2-8-0 &quot;Consolidation&quot; type was assigned class H, and was used in freight service.
* H-6sb
* H9s
* H10s

====Class K: 4-6-2====
The 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot; type was assigned class K. and was used in passenger service.
* K4s

Since the Consolidation Agreement had decreed that the PRR Mechanical Department would oversee equipment policy decisions, the PRSL did not gain ownership of any ACRR-RDG locomotives.

Additional locomotives were leased as needed from PRSL&#x27;s parent companies, PRR and RDG.

===Diesel===

Beginning in the 1950s the PRSL purchased a rather modest fleet of its own diesel locomotives to replace its steam engines for passenger and freight services. When additional power was needed for the busy summer tourist season engines were borrowed from the parent corporations (usually the PRR) as was true previously with the steam locomotives. To further supplement its small fleet the PRSL made increasing use of run through power on certain freight trains to large customers that did not require classification at the PRSL&#x27;s Pavonia yard.

The first generation of PRSL diesel locomotives were all from the nearby Baldwin Locomotive Works, which was the vendor of choice for the parent PRR in both the steam and early diesel era.
The PRSL&#x27;s diesel locomotives were almost all painted in what is commonly referred to as Brunswick Green which was so dark it seemed almost black. The paint scheme was borrowed from its PRR parent and with the company&#x27;s official name for this color being DGLE (Dark Green Locomotive Enamel). The undercarriage of the locomotives were painted in black referred to as &quot;True Black.&quot;

====Baldwin Locomotive Works====
By the late 1960s, the original Baldwin diesels were beginning to suffer reliability problems, which was exacerbated by the fact that Baldwin had gone out of business some 10 years before and could no longer provide spare parts or maintenance. With the new powerplant being constructed at Beesley&#x27;s Point ready to consume several 90 car coal trains per week the PRSL was in need of more powerful and more reliable locomotives and turned to industry-leader EMD to supply 10 new second generation diesel electric locomotives.

====General Motors Electro-Motive Division (GM-EMD)====
===Passenger===
====Gas-electric car (Doodlebug)====
====RDC====
PRSL inherited the following from the WJ&amp;S:
*71 PRR-Type P-70 passenger cars No.&#x27;s 9865-9936 (steel, 44 seats)
*21 PRR-Type PB-70 passenger-combines Cars No.&#x27;s 9938-9958 (steel, 40 seats) 9959-9962 (steel, 40 seats)
*17 various PRR-Type mail and baggage cars No.&#x27;s 25 (steel underfame), 6403 (steel), 6428-6438 (steel), 9963-9966 (steel)

Additional passenger cars were leased as needed from PRSL&#x27;s parent companies, PRR and RDG, and sometimes from the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ).

The PRSL did not own any of the P70s that carried its name. They were leased from the WJ&amp;S. The passenger cars of the PRSL were painted Tuscan Red. This is a brick-colored shade of red.

<doc id="1292805" wikidata="Q935449" url="?curid=1292805" title="Songs of Faith and Devotion Live">
<text>Songs of Faith and Devotion Live is the second live album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released on 6 December 1993 by Mute Records. Recorded during the band&#x27;s 1993 Devotional Tour, the album consists mainly of performances recorded in Liévin, France, with two other tracks recorded in Copenhagen and New Orleans, respectively. It was a track-by-track live duplication of Depeche Mode&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;, which was released earlier in 1993.

The album was poorly received by critics and performed moderately on the charts, reaching number 46 on the UK Albums Chart and number 193 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. As of April 2006, it had sold 114,000 copies in the United States.

A near-complete concert of the Devotional Tour was released on the &quot;Devotional&quot; video album in 1993, and attained more commercial success.

==Critical reception==

In comparison to &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;, &quot;Songs and Faith and Devotion Live&quot; received less acclaim from music critics; AllMusic rated the album two stars out of five.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot; rated &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion Live&quot; as the &quot;Least Essential Live Album&quot; of the 1990s, saying, &quot;Depeche Mode has plugged in plenty of DAT and drum machines during its live performances, thereby allowing the band to crank out note-perfect versions of its studio hits. Featuring every track on &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot;, played live and in order, the album&#x27;s live counterpart is monumentally unnecessary.&quot; In the same feature, the album was listed as one of ten nominees for &quot;Least Essential Album&quot; of the decade with the comment, &quot;It&#x27;s not like Depeche Mode is inclined to rely on radical instrumental improvisation live.&quot;

==Track listing==
===Notes===
* All tracks were recorded live at Stade Couvert Régional in Liévin, France, on 29 July 1993, except &quot;Get Right with Me&quot;, recorded at Forum Copenhagen in Copenhagen on 27 May 1993, and &quot;One Caress&quot;, recorded at Lakefront Arena in New Orleans on 8 October 1993.

<doc id="1292809" wikidata="Q5287494" url="?curid=1292809" title="Doctor in the House (franchise)">
<text>Doctor in the House is a collective name for seven separate British and Australian television comedy series inspired by the &quot;Doctor&quot; books of English author Richard Gordon. The books had also previously been adapted as a series of cinema films. The television versions were less directly based on the Gordon books than was the film series, but were instead half-hour sitcoms chronicling the misadventures of a group of medical students, and their later checkered careers as doctors.

The first five series, &quot;Doctor in the House&quot;, &quot;Doctor at Large&quot;, &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot;, &quot;Doctor at Sea&quot; and &quot;Doctor on the Go&quot;, were produced by London Weekend Television between 1969 and 1977. The sixth series, &quot;Doctor Down Under&quot;, which was filmed and based in Australia, was produced by Australia&#x27;s Seven Network in 1979. The final series, &quot;Doctor at the Top&quot;, was produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1991. The series were broadcast under their individual titles in the U.K. and in some British Commonwealth countries. In the U.S. and Canada, where the Richard Gordon books were less well-known, episodes from the first five series were all syndicated under the original &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; title. 

The same theme music — &quot;Bond Street Parade&quot; by Alan Tew — was used for all of the &quot;Doctor&quot; television series, including the Australian series &quot;Doctor Down Under&quot;.

== Characters ==
The television series employed a set of characters completely different from the original book series (the film and radio series used the characters from the books).

The major protagonists were:
*Michael Upton (Barry Evans), an easy-going, serious and somewhat anxious son of a doctor who is essentially following in his father&#x27;s footsteps. Upton was the central character of the first two series, but Barry Evans left the show following &quot;Doctor at Large&quot;. 
*Duncan Waring (Robin Nedwell), Michael&#x27;s best friend and roommate. He is just as bright as Upton, but far less serious in his studies, although he generally does well. After Barry Evans left the show, Nedwell returned as Waring to become the focus of the show. Duncan Waring appears in all of the series except &quot;Doctor at Large&quot;, and is the main protagonist of the last five. 
*Dick Stuart-Clark (Geoffrey Davies), a thirtyish student who deliberately fails his courses in order to take advantage of his late grandmother&#x27;s will, which bequeathed him a large sum of money for each year he is in medical school. He later becomes an anesthetist who prefers partying and chasing women to his medical duties. Dick Stuart-Clark is the only character present throughout all seven series. Davies and Nedwell essentially became a double act in many of the later episodes of the franchise. 
*Paul Collier (George Layton), a less competent student and friend of Upton and Waring. His character left the series after &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot;, but Layton continued to write scripts for the subsequent series. 
*Lawrence Bingham (Richard O&#x27;Sullivan), a brilliant, but arrogant and irritating doctor who believes he is the best of all possible doctors. He marries the equally obnoxious Dr. Mary Parsons (Helen Fraser) in the series &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot;. His need to continually impress her is the source of much comedy. O&#x27;Sullivan departed after &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot; to star in &quot;Man About the House&quot;

The main antagonist is the well-respected and ill-tempered surgeon Professor (later Sir) Geoffrey Loftus (Ernest Clark). Many of the plot lines revolve around the students&#x27; attempts to meet his demanding expectations. Another hospital official with whom the students have contact is the Dean (Ralph Michael), who is more interested in the hospital&#x27;s Rugby union team than he is in medicine.

Other characters in the early episodes, some of whom later reappeared for single episodes in subsequent series, include:
* Danny Hooley (Jonathan Lynn), an Irish medical student who is a friend of Waring, Collier, Upton and Stuart-Clark. He later returns as an &#x27;out-of-work doctor&#x27; in the &quot;Doctor in Charge&quot; episode &quot;Should Auld Acquaintance be Forgot?&quot;
* Huw Evans (Martin Shaw), a Welsh medical student, another friend of the four students. He reappears as a very nervous expectant father in the episode &quot;Mother and Father Doing Well&quot;.
* Dave Briddock (Simon Cuff), another friend of the students. He spends part of the series living with Helga, his Swedish girlfriend.

==Guest stars==

Hattie Jacques, Mollie Sugden, Roy Kinnear, Maureen Lipman, Patricia Routledge, Graeme Garden, David Jason, John Le Mesurier, Arthur Lowe, Angela Scoular, Tessa Wyatt and John Bluthal.

== Writers ==
Unusually for a British situation comedy series &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; did not depend on a single writer or partnership to write the scripts. The writers who worked on the series are often better known for their other work. Monty Python&#x27;s Graham Chapman and John Cleese and The Goodies Graeme Garden and Bill Oddie were among the regular writers. Chapman and Garden both trained as doctors. Graeme Garden also appeared as a &quot;Television Presenter&quot; in the episode &quot;Doctor on the Box&quot;.

While keeping mostly to the conventions of the situation comedy genre, the shows occasionally stretched the boundaries of what was seen on television. One script by Cleese called for Michael Upton to rip away a woman&#x27;s dress in a single movement (she was hiding a key he needed in her cleavage). Another featured a stripper collapsing on stage mid-act with suspected pneumonia. A script by Garden and Oddie included a scene played out using cartoon drawings of the performers, in the style of a teenage romance magazine, while the actors voiced their lines.

== Location of St. Swithin&#x27;s Hospital ==
The building used as the fictional St. Swithin&#x27;s Hospital is, in fact, the old Wanstead Hospital (based in Wanstead, London, E11). A number of years ago it was converted into a residential building and is now called Clock Court. It is a listed building based on Hermon Hill, within the London Borough of Redbridge. Before becoming a hospital it was an orphanage for children whose parents were lost at sea, and the architecture of the building depicts images of boats carved into the intricate stone. A number of celebrities are rumoured to have lived there over the years including the actor Gary Lucy (The Bill), and Heart FM radio DJ Paul Hollins.

==International telecasts==

=== Australia ===
The show proved to be very popular in Australia, where the series &quot;Doctor Down Under&quot; was filmed and based.

=== North America ===
During the 1970s and 1980s, the five London Weekend Television series were syndicated in the United States and Canada by Group W Productions. The umbrella title &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; was used for all shows, and episodes from different series were sometimes shown out of sequence. The episodes appeared on both commercial and Public Broadcasting Service stations. 

==DVD Release==
The five London Weekend Television series were released complete on a Grenada Network 20-disc box set entitled &quot;Doctor on the Box&quot; in 2009. As of 2024, the set is available only from third-party resellers. 

==Notes==
British doctors study medicine at the undergraduate level, so the characters were new to independent living and university life.

Ernest Clark, who played the part of Professor Loftus in the television series, also appeared in the original film version of &quot;Doctor in the House&quot;. He also played the part of Prof. Sir Loftus&#x27; identical twin brother, Capt. Norman Loftus, heading the cruise ship in &quot;Doctor at Sea&quot;.

A 1981 ITV series &quot;Doctors&#x27; Daughters&quot; was not directly related to the &quot;Doctor in the House&quot; TV franchise. This series was written by Richard Gordon, the author of the original &quot;Doctor&quot; books, adapted from his 1981 novel of the same title, and shared no characters or cast members with the main TV franchise. The series was not well-received and was cancelled after six episodes.

<text>Abdul Jabbar Naeemi (Dari and ) is an Afghan diplomat and politician. He served as the governor of Laghman Province in Afghanistan, and before that was governor Khost province and Maidan Wardak province of Afghanistan. At one time he served as a representative from Kandahar Province to the Loya Jirga (Grand Assembly). In 2004 he was Hamid Karzai&#x27;s election agent in Pakistan, where he campaigned for Karzai and worked on educating local Afghans about the democratic process.

After the presidential elections, Naeemi became the Governor of Wardak Province, which is located 30 kilometers west of Kabul. Since taking up this position he has received credit for re-establishing order in the province, a former Taliban stronghold, and for drastically reducing the cultivation of opium.

He is a follower of the Pashtun spiritual leader Pir Sayed Ahmed Gailani, and a member of Gailani&#x27;s National Islamic Front party.

In early 2010 Abdul was appointed governor of Khost Province.

<text>Riverside South is an urban development project in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, United States. Developed by the businessman and later U.S. president Donald Trump in collaboration with six civic associations, the largely residential complex is on of land along the Hudson River between 59th Street and 72nd Street. The $3 billion project, which replaced a New York Central Railroad yard known as the 60th Street Yard, includes multiple residential towers and a extension of Riverside Park.

There were several proposals for the site in the late 20th century. These included the Litho City plan in the 1960s, Trump&#x27;s 1970s plan, and the Lincoln West plan of the early 1980s. The current proposal stems from Trump&#x27;s late-1980s proposal for Television City. Television City was originally designed to include 16 apartment buildings, of studio space, of office space, ancillary retail space, and a waterfront park. Trump sold Riverside South to investors from Hong Kong and mainland China, which built seven structures starting in 1997. In 2005, the investors sold the remaining unfinished portions to the Carlyle Group and the Extell Development Company. which developed three more buildings. In turn, Extell sold off some of the southernmost plots in the 2010s; these sites became Waterline Square.

==60th Street Rail Yard==
Before Riverside South was developed, the site was a rail freight yard owned by the New York Central Railroad, located between 59th and 72nd streets. By 1849 an embankment near West End Avenue, with a span over a tidal lagoon, carried the Hudson River Railroad, later part of New York Central. At the time, much of the current site of Riverside South was still under water. By 1880, what had been river was transformed by landfill into the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s vast 60th Street Yard. Within the 60th Street Yard, a set of piers extended into the Hudson River, where barges carried railcars across the river to New Jersey. The piers protruded at a 55-degree angle and each contained tracks.

In the 1930s, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses covered New York Central&#x27;s rail track north of 72nd Street as part of the West Side Improvement, which also moved rail lines below grade south of 60th Street. The Moses project was bigger than Hoover Dam and created the Henry Hudson Parkway. The adjacent Riverside Park was expanded to the Hudson River.

Until the 1970s, the rail yard area was generally industrial. The area was home to a printing plant for &quot;The New York Times&quot; between 1959 and 1975, as well as ABC television studios. At the same time, public housing extended to West End Avenue (across the street from the printing plant and the TV studios), and the Lincoln Towers redevelopment project extended to the rail yard boundary along Freedom Place. New York Central merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad to form Penn Central in 1968 as the rail lines were suffering severe financial difficulties. The railroad went bankrupt in 1970, and its assets were sold off in federal court.
==Early redevelopment plans==
In the late 20th century, there had been several proposals to develop structures over the rail yard. These included the Litho City plan in the 1960s; the businessman Donald Trump&#x27;s 1970s plan; the Lincoln West plan of the early 1980s; and Trump&#x27;s Television City plan of the late 1980s. In his book &quot;New York 2000&quot;, Robert A. M. Stern described the site as &quot;one of the city&#x27;s most coveted and contested parcels of open land&quot;. The site was hard to develop in part because it did not have roads or utilities, and because any potential redevelopment would have had to be built over the train yard.

=== 1960s plans ===

In 1961, the railroad proposed a partnership with the Amalgamated Lithographers Union to build Litho City&quot;,&quot; a mixed-use development over the tracks. There would be six 47-story buildings and three 41-story buildings, all designed by Kelly &amp; Gruzen. The development would have included 200 artists&#x27; studios that faced north; the rest of the units would be structured as rental apartments or housing cooperatives. Sources variously cited Litho City as being built to accommodate 12,500 or 25,000 people. The New York City Planning Commission (CPC) deferred action on the Litho City proposal for a year while it reviewed Litho City&#x27;s effects on traffic in the neighborhood, and the consulting firm of Day &amp; Zimmerman warned that the development might worsen traffic. Nonetheless, the union&#x27;s president Edward Swayduck and the city&#x27;s traffic commissioner Henry A. Barnes both endorsed the Litho City plan.

The CPC designated the West Side rail yard as an urban renewal site in October 1962, allowing the plans for Litho City to proceed. Shortly afterward, the Amalgamated Lithographers Union announced plans for a $15 million dormitory in the development, which would house 1,000 foreign students. Plans also called for a promenade linking to Lincoln Center, in addition to a park on the Hudson River shoreline. A scale model of Litho City was unveiled at Grand Central Terminal in 1963. By then, the project was being planned as a high-income development, rather than a middle-income development; the cost of Litho City was estimated at $175 million. There were to be 6,000 apartments, and a new street, running parallel to the yard between 66th and 70th streets, was also proposed. Moses also planned to build an exit from the West Side Highway to Litho City, prompting objections that the street grid could not handle the additional traffic.

The plans for Litho City were formally dropped in January 1966 due to disputes over the air rights; the railroad had terminated the union&#x27;s lease of the site two months prior. In the late 1960s, there were various proposals by the city&#x27;s Educational Construction Fund for mixed residential and school projects, also partly on landfill. This development would have included several athletic fields and between 6,000 and 12,000 apartments. In the early 1970s, Moses proposed relocating the highway between 59th and 72nd streets to ground level to facilitate an extension of Riverside Park, but he was unsuccessful. The state rejected that proposal because of the presumed negative effect on development opportunities and because it would violate the Blumenthal Amendment, which prohibited any highway construction that would alter Riverside Park.

=== First Trump proposal and sale ===
In July 1974, Trump Enterprises Inc., a company controlled by Trump, offered to buy an option on the 60th Street Yard and the 30th Street Yard for a combined $100 million. Trump did not make a down payment. Penn Central, which at the time was under trusteeship due to its insolvency, petitioned its trustees to approve the sale. Though both of the yards were still being used by freight trains, the only structures on the sites were storage buildings and train tracks. Following a private meeting with Trump, his father Fred, and Mayor Abraham Beame, Penn Central&#x27;s trustees gave the option to Trump because he &quot;seemed best positioned [...] to get rezoning and government financing&quot;. A U.S. federal court approved Penn Central&#x27;s sale of the option to Trump in March 1975.

Initially, Trump wanted to build up to 20,000 or 30,000 housing units on the site. At the time, he had never completed a major real-estate development before. Local politicians including U.S. Representative Bella Abzug expressed concerns about the fact that the 60th Street redevelopment would cater mostly to middle- and upper-class families. Trump presented plans for the development to local residents in April 1976. As part of the proposal, designed by Gruzen &amp; Partners, the site would be divided into three sectors with at least four buildings each; about 40 percent of the development would be open space, and there would be one or two schools and a central shopping mall. There would have been 14,500 apartments on the site, funded with federal subsidies. Manhattan Community Board 7, representing the neighborhood that included the rail yard, opposed the plan. Trump twice downsized his plans for the yards. By May 1976, Trump&#x27;s plans called for the West Side Highway to be relocated so he could build a park next to it; the Department of City Planning endorsed this plan. The state ultimately proposed reconstructing the highway viaduct instead.

Another proposal, for 12,450 apartments, was dependent on public financing that never materialized. In May 1979, Trump exercised his option on the site, agreeing to buy the yard for $28 million. Had Trump finalized the acquisition, he would have been required to make payments over 18–30 months, after which he could take title to the site. However, Trump never finalized his purchase, and his father&#x27;s longtime friend Abe Hirschfeld agreed to take over the option instead. By then, the city government was contemplating building a freight yard for piggyback trains on the site. Penn Central signed a sale contract in March 1980, agreeing to sell Hirschfeld and his son Elie the site for $28 million. Under the terms of the contract, the Hirschfelds made a $400,000 down payment and were required to spend $700,000 on planning over the next year. Trump later said that his decision to let his option expire was &quot;the toughest business decision in my life&quot;.

=== Lincoln West ===
Abe Hirschfeld and the Argentine astrophysicist Carlos Varsavsky acquired the 60th Street Yard site in late 1980. Varsavsky&#x27;s company, the Macri Group, became the project&#x27;s majority partner, with a 65% ownership stake; the Hirschfelds held the remaining 35% stake.

==== Initial plan ====

Hirschfeld and Varsavsky formed a partnership named Lincoln West Associates to develop a project known as Lincoln West on the 60th Street Yard site. Macri hired Gruzen &amp; Partners to draw up plans for the project, and he hired former deputy mayor John Eugene Zuccotti and lawyer Judah Gribetz to consult on the project. Rafael Viñoly assisted Gruzen with the plans. The initial plans, announced in January 1981, called for 16 residential towers with a total of 4,850 apartments, arranged around a new avenue called Lincoln Boulevard. There would also be a 500-room hotel, one or two office towers, and of open space. A 4,000-space parking garage would have been located underneath the development. Due to the topography of the site, the buildings at both the northern and southern ends would have been located on a platform, and Lincoln Boulevard would have been built with two levels. The first apartments would have begun construction in 1982, while the rest of the development would have been built in phases over a decade.

Lincoln West Associates submitted a formal proposal for the site in November 1981. When the plans were announced, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote that &quot;much can be improved in the design of Lincoln West&quot; but predicted that the development itself would alleviate the high demand for luxury housing in the city. In late 1981, Lincoln West Associates offered to give $10,000 to Community Board 7 for a study of the project&#x27;s impacts. The plans had to undergo community review. Opponents claimed that the development would overload the area&#x27;s infrastructure, and other critics took issue with the development&#x27;s size and the lack of affordable housing. The firm of McKeown &amp; Franz conducted an environmental impact statement (EIS) for the site. The EIS found that the project would create 7,000 jobs, but that it would also overload existing transit infrastructure due to the presence of 9,200 additional commuters. Community Board 7 refused to support the project unless it was downscaled to include fewer than 4,000 residential units. Ultimately, Hirschfeld and Varsavsky agreed to pay for infrastructure improvements in the neighborhood.

Macri sent the plans to the CPC for review in March 1982 but, despite the concerns over Lincoln West&#x27;s size, initially refused to scale down the plans. The same month, the city asked Lincoln West Associates to postpone its plans so the city could decide whether to build a new freight terminal there, and Lincoln West Associates agreed to restart the community review process. Additionally, part of the parking garage was replaced with space for trucking company, and the number of apartments was reduced to 4,700. Manhattan borough president Andrew Stein wanted the project to be further reduced to 3,700 apartments, which Varsavsky refused. The engineering firm Tippetts Abbett McCarthy Stratton conducted a feasibility study of the proposed freight-rail center, finding that it was feasible to build it under Lincoln West, though Varsavsky opposed the freight center.

==== Approval, lawsuits, and modifications ====
The CPC approved the Lincoln West plans in July 1982, disregarding most of the opponents&#x27; objections to the project, although it asked the developers to reduce the project&#x27;s size. The New York City Board of Estimate also gave its approval that September. The plans called for 1,100 rental apartments (of which one-fifth would be affordable housing), in addition to 3,200 luxury co-ops or condos. In addition, the developers agreed to add several amenities such as a swimming pool, a park, and upgrades to two nearby subway stops. Lincoln West Associates paid $13 million for the northern five blocks shortly after the plans were approved, and it paid $21.6 million that December for the southern eight blocks. The developers had planned to begin construction in April 1983, but the plans were delayed after Varsavsky&#x27;s sudden death in early 1983. Francisco Macri took over Varsavsky&#x27;s 65% interest in the project.

Delays also arose from various lawsuits. Opponents sued in the New York Supreme Court in February 1983, alleging that the EIS had been done improperly. The EIS was invalidated the next month, though the city government successfully appealed the ruling. The New York Court of Appeals, the state&#x27;s highest court, ruled in October 1983 that the EIS had been prepared properly. In addition, Harry Helmsley, who owned an option on a superblock from 61st to 65th streets, sued the city and Lincoln West Associates, claiming that the city wanted to build three streets through his property.

Though work had still not begun by early 1984, Lincoln West&#x27;s developers were already revising the plans significantly, prompting its chairman to resign. Additionally, in July 1984, Chase Manhattan Bank moved to foreclose on two mortgages that had been placed on the site. The city government would have canceled the development if the street grid had not received final approval by that September, but the Board of Estimate voted to extend the deadline by one month. That October, the Board of Estimate approved plans for Lincoln West&#x27;s street grid and voted to give Lincoln West Associates four additional months to obtain financing. By then, public officials doubted that Lincoln West would ever be completed, amid continued opposition to the project. Lincoln West Associates ultimately could not receive financing for the development, partly because of Macri&#x27;s concessions to the city and partly because Trump was trying to retake control of the site.

===Television City===
Trump negotiated to repurchase Lincoln West in mid-1984; he initially decided against it but ultimately made an offer for the site that November. Trump announced in December 1984 that he would pay $95 million for the Lincoln West site; this was part of a $115 million transaction that gave Trump control of the rail yard. Under the agreement, Trump controlled 80% of the project, Elie Hirschfeld retained a 20% stake, and Francisco Macri gave up his interest in the project. Trump initially anticipated constructing towers as tall as 60 stories, rather than a variety of low-rise buildings, as Lincoln West Associates had been proposed. He hired the Chicago–based architect Helmut Jahn in January 1985 to design the as-yet-unnamed development on the site. Trump, who called the Lincoln West tract &quot;one of the best pieces of real estate in the country&quot;, contemplated erecting up to 8,000 apartments there. He also wanted to build a supertall skyscraper, following two unsuccessful approvals to build such a tower at the New York Coliseum site and on Wall Street.

==== Initial plan ====
In November 1985, Trump announced plans for the Television City complex, which would feature a television studio headquarters. The plan involved 7,900 apartments, along with retail, office, and television studio space. A 150-story supertall tower would rise from the middle of the complex, near 66th Street. The skyscraper would have included 750 hotel rooms and 60 floors of residences, and it would have been tall, making it the world&#x27;s tallest building. Several other towers, each 72 or 76 stories high, would flank the 150-story tower, and there would be of television studio space. In addition, the development would have 8,500 parking spaces, of parkland, and of retail space. Shortly after the plans were announced, Trump and the media company NBC discussed the possibility of relocating NBC&#x27;s headquarters from Rockefeller Center to Television City. Trump met with other television networks as well, including ABC and CBS. The urban planner Norman Levin, who had formerly worked for Gruzen, was in charge of 20 separate teams who were working on the project.

&quot;Crain&#x27;s New York&quot; called Trump&#x27;s plan &quot;the most ambitious development project ever in New York&quot;. Goldberger wrote that Television City was &quot;woefully simplistic&quot; and that the towers&#x27; designs had only a tenuous relationship with the street grid. &quot;New York Magazine&quot; architecture critic Carter Wiseman agreed, writing &quot;isolated towers&quot;, such as those proposed in Television City, &quot;survive in most of the world&#x27;s major cities as reminders to planners that this brand of angst-inducing exclusivity is nasty to live with&quot;. Wiseman also said the development would cause overcrowding at the 72nd Street/Broadway station of the New York City Subway. A writer for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; described the buildings as &quot;intimidating and psychologically disturbing, dwarfing everything that&#x27;s human in scale&quot;.

The proposal needed both a new EIS and a public review, and Trump hired McKeown &amp; Franz to conduct the EIS. As such, construction could not start until 1987; Trump predicted that it would take five years to complete. The project soon received large amounts of opposition. Local residents expressed skepticism to the project, citing its size and the fact that it targeted the upper middle class. The Coalition Against Lincoln West called Television City &quot;doubly excessive&quot;, dubbing it as even more extreme than the Lincoln West plan, while other opponents were specifically against the 150-story tower. Opponents ranged from small associations to the Westpride group, the latter of which enlisted notable neighborhood residents and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund the effort. Trump was initially reluctant to acquiesce to opponents&#x27; demands, fearing that doing so would endanger the development. Trump tentatively agreed to sell Kumagai Gumi a 25% ownership stake in the development in 1986, but the agreement was rescinded due to disagreements over how much Kumagai Gumi was to pay.

==== Changes in plans ====
Even though Trump liked the original plans, he ultimately decided to replace Jahn as Television City&#x27;s master planner. Jahn remained the architect for the proposed supertall tower. In June 1986, he appointed Alexander Cooper as the site&#x27;s new master planner; &quot;Newsday&quot; described Cooper as having a &quot;sensitivity to scale&quot; that contrasted with Trump&#x27;s bold style. Trump and Cooper announced revised plans for Television City in October 1986. Cooper reduced the 150-story tower to 136 stories; according to Cooper, the supertall tower would include less floor area than the Sears Tower or either of the World Trade Center&#x27;s twin towers. The modified project still contained roughly the same amount of space, including each of studio and retail space as well as 7,600 housing units. The six 72-story towers were replaced with slightly smaller, 45- to 57-story skyscrapers, which line one side of an avenue that would run north-south through most of the development. The plan included fewer parking spaces and more parkland as well.

Cooper&#x27;s version of Television City still received criticism. Peter Marcuse of Columbia University expressed doubts that the 150-story tower was economically feasible, and Kenneth Frampton, also of Columbia, described the building as &quot;a violent irrelevancy&quot;. By contrast, Goldberger described Cooper&#x27;s design for the site as &quot;vastly more sophisticated&quot; than Jahn&#x27;s plan, and he wrote that Trump&#x27;s decision to hire Cooper may have been part of Trump&#x27;s efforts to ingratiate himself with the local community.

By early 1987, Trump was negotiating to lease the entirety of the supertall skyscraper&#x27;s office space to General Electric (GE), which at the time owned NBC. Trump offered to sell the site to the New York State Urban Development Corporation and lease it back for 99 years. In exchange, Trump would have received a 20-year or 30-year tax abatement for Television City, which would have been the highest-valued abatement ever granted in New York City. Trump also offered to give the city government a portion of Television City&#x27;s profits. Despite widespread public support for Trump&#x27;s tax abatement, the city rejected Trump&#x27;s proposal, and Mayor Ed Koch offered the tax breaks directly to NBC instead of to Trump. Negotiations between Trump and Koch devolved into name-calling; Trump called on Koch to resign, and Koch compared Trump to &quot;a stuck pig&quot;. The plans called for 11 residential buildings, about of office space, several parks, and a 152-story tower by mid-1987. The department store chain Bloomingdale&#x27;s negotiated to lease space in Television City as well. 

The project continued to face major opposition; for example, Westpride raised over $20,000 at a late-1987 fundraiser opposing Television City. Trump indicated that September that he wanted to sell NBC part of the Television City parcel for $20 million, and he also tried to entice financial services firms to move there. The Trump Organization also conducted a new EIS to appease opponents&#x27; concerns about Television City. The new EIS, published in October 1987, found that the development would cast shadows on the neighborhood, overload local transportation infrastructure, and interfere with television broadcasts. A local group known as the Parks Council commissioned a scale model of Television City, showing the shadows that the development would create.

==== Renaming and further revisions ====
At the end of October 1987, NBC decided against moving to Television City, even as Trump Organization officials claimed that the EIS was close to being approved. &quot;Politico&quot; reporter Michael Kruse wrote that the CPC likely would never have approved Trump City, though David W. Dunlap of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that much of the project might have indeed been approved. Afterward, Trump initially planned to replace the television studio with a park or movie theater, even while preserving other aspects of the plans. In February 1988, Trump announced a revised plan for the project, which was renamed Trump City. The TV studio space was replaced with parkland, two small office buildings were added, and 760 of the apartments were designated as affordable housing for the elderly. The 150-story tower was retained, and there were to be 13 smaller towers. Goldberger wrote that Trump had added the affordable housing units to increase the likelihood of getting community approval, a sentiment shared by the project&#x27;s opponents. By October 1988, there was speculation that Trump might sell the site. Despite receiving five offers, all for hundreds of millions of dollars, Trump ultimately decided to keep the site. 

Westpride, which had 4,200 members at the end of 1988, continued to fight Trump City, and local civic groups promised to sue the city government if Trump City were approved. Community Board 7 and the Municipal Art Society jointly sponsored a study that recommended extending Riverside Park and the Manhattan street grid through the site. To increase the development&#x27;s floor area by , Trump suggested transferring air rights from a tract under the Hudson River to the rest of Trump City. Further delays arose in 1989 when the city government investigated complaints that the Trump Organization was relocating possibly-contaminated dirt from Trump City to Fresh Kills Landfill. Trump alleged that Koch&#x27;s administration was delaying the review of the project&#x27;s EIS. In early 1990, Trump submitted a draft EIS to the New York City Council, which called for the structures to be built in several phases. Trump had spent nearly $200 million to date, even though construction had not started. Chase Manhattan Bank, which had given Trump a mortgage loan on the site, expressed concerns that the loan could not be repaid, and Trump was paying tens of millions of dollars a year just to maintain the site. 

Local civic groups filed a lawsuit in June 1990 to prevent the city government from rezoning the 60th Street Yard for the Trump City development. The project was still opposed by groups such as the American Institute of Architects, and local politicians called on the city government to buy the site from Trump. Goldberger wrote that Trump City had turned into &quot;a national symbol both of massive, overreaching development and of diehard community opposition to it&quot;. In response, Trump hired an advertiser to promote the development to residents in the New York metropolitan area. By that August, Trump had submitted three scaled-down plans for the site to the CPC. In November 1990, a New York Supreme Court judge invalidated zoning permits that the CPC had granted to Trump City, although the proposal was still undergoing public review as late as February 1991.

=== Manhattan West and ABC proposals ===
In 1985, the developer Daniel Brodsky acquired the land just east of the yard between 61st and 64th streets. He proposed a development known as Manhattan West, which initially called for 1,375 apartments, and he also wanted NBC to relocate to the site. By 1987, his plans called for 1,200 affordable and luxury apartments across more than , in addition to of parkland. The apartments would have been located in an L-shaped building with several roofs measuring up to 39 stories high, as well as 28-story building to the south. The CPC forced Manhattan West to conform to Television City&#x27;s site plan, which included a block-wide park between 63rd and 64th streets extending east to West End Avenue. A new version of the plan, with 1,000 apartments and only , was proposed in 1989. The Board of Estimate approved the revision in February 1990, and work on Manhattan West began in 1994. 

Meanwhile, Brodsky had sold off the northernmost of the Manhattan West site to Capital Cities/ABC in 1986. By the 1990s, Capital Cities/ABC was planning to erect three 39-story residential buildings and several television studios. The residential buildings, with a combined 930 units, would have been located from 64th to 65th streets, while the studios would have been located to the north. Capital Cities/ABC&#x27;s proposal was submitted for public review in 1992, but Community Board 7 rejected the original plans. Capital Cities/ABC then canceled one of the towers and downsized the project to 500 apartments.

== Riverside South ==

=== Civic organization proposal ===

==== Initial plan ====

At the end of 1989, six civic organizations—the Municipal Art Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, New Yorkers for Parks, Regional Plan Association, Riverside Park Fund, and Westpride—proposed an alternative plan for the site, devised by the engineer Daniel Gutman and the architect Paul Willen. The plans called for residential project of . The West Side Highway would be relocated underground to make room for a expansion of Riverside Park, and a new Riverside Boulevard would run above the relocated highway. Trump was negotiating with these civic groups by the beginning of 1991, and he formally abandoned plans for Trump City in March 1991. The project was to have of space in total. These plans called for 5,500 apartments and up to for television studios. In addition, four artists were hired to design the complex&#x27;s public spaces. Goldberger referred to Trump&#x27;s abandonment of the Trump City plans as a &quot;miracle&quot;.

Trump and the civic groups formed the Riverside South Planning Corporation (RSPC) to develop the project, which they called Riverside South. Chase Manhattan Bank, which still held more than $200 million in mortgages on the site, initially paid all of RSPC&#x27;s expenses. In April 1991, the RSPC hired David Childs of SOM, along with Paul Willen, to oversee Riverside South&#x27;s design. A group of planners and architects, appointed by Manhattan borough president Ruth Messinger, recommended that the plans be downsized even further. The RSPC unveiled a scale model of its proposal in August 1991, which called for several curved towers of up to 50 stories high. By early 1992, RSPC chairman Richard Kahan said the tallest residential buildings would be 40 stories and be clustered at either end of the site. There were to be 16 residential towers and two office towers. Both the city and state governments of New York endorsed the project, even though Trump had not pledged funds to improve nearby subway stations, as local residents had requested. Trump also did not want to add affordable housing units, saying it would be unprofitable to do so.

==== Approval process and objections ====
In May 1992, the CPC granted the Riverside South project a certification, allowing the public review process to commence. However, the project faced opposition because of its size, traffic issues, lack of affordable housing, and its association with Trump. Some residents of Lincoln Towers, which adjoined the rail yard, opposed any development on the site. Minor objections included the fact that the towers might block the west–facing windows of the Chatsworth apartment building on 72nd Street. Residents of 71st Street, a dead end street, objected to the fact that their street would be extended to Riverside Boulevard. A report commissioned for Community Board 7 found that Riverside South would overwhelm the neighborhood&#x27;s transit infrastructure unless it was reduced to 4,300 apartments, and the community board voted in July 1992 to recommend that the project not proceed. Additionally, Messinger said she would not support the plans without further alterations.

Following these objections, Trump agreed to slightly reduce the project&#x27;s size, remove the office space, provide funds for the 72nd Street subway station, reserve 12% of the apartments for affordable housing, and build and maintain the new public park. The RSPC agreed to extend 71st Street for pedestrians while preventing through vehicular traffic, and setbacks were mandated on each of the buildings. Messinger agreed to support the project after Trump acquiesced to the subway improvements, park, and affordable-housing units, but other critics still strongly opposed the project. U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler described the planned public park as a &quot;private backyard for the people who live in these buildings&quot;. Amid the opposition, Trump denied that he planned to sell the site. To convince the CPC to approve his plans, Trump agreed to provide even more money for the 72nd Street subway station and designate 20% of the apartments as affordable housing. Trump also agreed to extend Riverside Drive southward to alleviate congestion on West End Avenue. The CPC approved the Riverside South plan in October 1992. A New York City Council subcommittee approved the plan that November after Trump agreed to delay the television studios&#x27; development, and the full City Council approved Riverside South the next month.

The final project size was —with an option for of television studios on the two southern blocks—as well as a park and improvements to the existing Freedom Place. Goldberger wrote that the final plan &quot;stands a real chance of being a cause for celebration rather than embarrassment.&quot; The media estimated that Riverside South. Manhattan West, and the Capital Cities/ABC project would collectively house between 15,000 and 20,000 residents. There was to be a park at the confluence of the three developments. The first phase of Riverside South called for four 18-to-40-story towers between 65th and 69th streets, with about 1,600 apartments. Ultimately, the development was planned to include 16 buildings with 5,700 apartments, in addition to a park and 1.8 million square feet of retail.

By March 1993, Trump was applying for tax abatements and funding from the New York state government; at the time, he owed the city $4.4 million in back taxes. Philip Johnson was hired as one of the development&#x27;s architects that November. After the Riverside South plan was approved, Trump and proponents of Riverside South wanted the federal government to provide $80 million for the West Side Highway&#x27;s relocation, but this funding was delayed for several years. Other opponents were upset by the decision to close the West Side Highway&#x27;s northbound entrance and exit ramps at 72nd Street and fought to deny the highway project any funding. 

==== Partnership with Asian investors ====
Meanwhile, during the mid-1990s, Chase Manhattan was pressuring Trump to repay the loan on the site, and Trump wanted to refinance the project to pay the debt. Colony Capital offered to buy the debt on Riverside South&#x27;s loan in late 1993, but these negotiations were unsuccessful. Additional attempts at obtaining funding from American financiers were also unsuccessful, and Trump said in early 1994 that he would apply for a loan from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. He subsequently went to Hong Kong to negotiate with the businessman Henry Cheng. The project was also involved in two lawsuits during this time, one of which claimed that the project did not conform to Lincoln West&#x27;s EIS. The other lawsuit centered around sewage disposal; at the time, Trump estimated that the development would generate of sewage a day, but he had not received permission to connect the development&#x27;s sewage lines to the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Trump sold a controlling interest in the project in June 1994, and a group of four developers from Hong Kong and mainland China, including New World Organization and Polylinks International, bought the controlling stake. Polylinks paid Chase $90 million to settle the project&#x27;s debt, plus $20 million in back taxes and other fees. The group also committed to spending $2.5 billion on the project itself. Cheng became Riverside South&#x27;s primary financier and developer, while Trump remained Riverside South&#x27;s chief promoter. Trump retained a 30% ownership stake in Riverside South, which could be increased if he sold or rented a certain number of apartments. The project was jointly developed by the Trump Organization and Hudson Waterfront Associates, the latter of which represented the Asian investors; they hired feng shui consultants to provide advice on Riverside South&#x27;s design.

Though Riverside South&#x27;s financial issues had been resolved, the lawsuits over the development were still pending. Construction was delayed as the lawsuits were resolved and the economy recovered. In February 1995, the city government resolved one of the legal disputes by allowing Trump to connect Riverside South&#x27;s sewage line to the North River plant. That June, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the EIS for Riverside South had been conducted properly. There was another controversy over the RSPC&#x27;s plans to build a temporary playground between 70th and 72nd streets. In the meantime, the new investors sought public financing. Trump applied for a $355 million mortgage for Riverside South from the federal government; if the mortgage were approved, up to 20% of the apartments would have been reserved for low-income or middle-income residents. Trump was accused of paying off New York State Senate majority leader Joseph Bruno for approval, and the project&#x27;s opponents accused Trump of colluding with Mayor Rudy Giuliani on the mortgage application. Nadler asked the Federal Housing Administration not to give a mortgage to Riverside South.

=== Start of construction ===

==== First structures ====

Trump and New World Organization hired Lehrer McGovern Bovis as Riverside South&#x27;s construction manager in April 1995; the firm went on to build eight of Riverside South&#x27;s towers. Work was delayed for two more years. In December 1996, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection granted Trump permission to connect the development&#x27;s first structure to the treatment plant, and Trump received private financing for that building. After the city granted a construction permit in January 1997, a shanty town nearby was removed the next month. Trump also indicated that, due to opposition to the West Side Highway&#x27;s relocation, he would postpone Riverside Park South&#x27;s construction. By mid-1997, Lehrer McGovern Bovis and HRH Construction were erecting the first two towers at 180 and 200 Riverside Boulevard, which had a combined 990 apartments. One hundred and four units at 180 Riverside were set aside for low-income households. Trump was also negotiating to install a massive statue of the explorer Christopher Columbus at Riverside South. Residents of Lincoln Towers continued to oppose the project, saying it would block their views of the Hudson River. Another group of opponents sued to force Trump to construct Riverside Park South.

During the construction of 200 Riverside Boulevard, a subcontractor used substandard concrete to construct columns supporting the fifth floor, ignoring warnings from the building&#x27;s structural engineer. The New York City Department of Buildings (DOB) halted construction of the tower that November, after that tower had reached its 20th floor. In addition, the first seven towers were exempt from the city&#x27;s new seismic code due to a grandfather clause, and two of the towers were also exempt from sprinkler regulations because they were shorter than . Work on 200 Riverside Boulevard resumed in January 1998 after the defective concrete was replaced. By the middle of the year, the TV network CBS was negotiating to occupy studio space in Riverside South, and New World was attempting to sell Riverside South&#x27;s first two buildings. The developers also rented out apartments at 180 Riverside Boulevard, while Pace Advertising Agency was hired to market the apartments. CBS ultimately decided against moving to Riverside South.

By early 1999, several retailers were negotiating to move into the first two buildings, and many of the condos and rental apartments were being leased out. The first structures were initially branded as Trump Place. New World and Trump placed a tract between 59th and 61st streets for sale that May, but they were unable to find a buyer. In addition, work had commenced on a third building: a 33-story tower at 160 Riverside Boulevard. Other developments, such as Tishman Speyer&#x27;s 101 West End Avenue rental building, were also being built nearby. The M72 bus was rerouted to serve the complex, prompting complaints from neighborhood residents.

==== Early 2000s expansion ====

By early 2000, work was about to begin on a fourth Trump Place building, a condo tower. Later that year, Columbia University began negotiating to construct a satellite campus at the southern end of Trump Place, although the university ultimately decided to develop buildings in Manhattanville instead. Simultaneously, Trump developed a waterfront public park known as Riverside Park South. Trump was required to expand the park as additional buildings were erected, and he also had to preserve the 69th Street Transfer Bridge. During the park&#x27;s construction, complaints of sewage smells prompted the Trump Organization to replace 180 Riverside&#x27;s pipes. The park&#x27;s first phase, which cost $14 million, unofficially opened in January 2001 and was dedicated that April. Trump Place&#x27;s real estate brokers, the Corcoran Group, reported higher-than-anticipated interest in the apartments, despite the development&#x27;s relatively remote location. Despite a slight downturn caused by the September 11 attacks later the same year, the apartments remained in high demand. Also in 2001, Community Board 7 approved the addition of another park on Riverside Boulevard, and the Federal Highway Administration approved the West Side Highway&#x27;s relocation eastward. 

Although Trump ceased his active involvement in the development in 2001, he retained his 30% limited partnership. The first retailer at Trump Place, a wine shop, opened in 2002, four years after Trump had begun looking for retail tenants. Trump planned to begin constructing the complex&#x27;s sixth structure, 240 Riverside Boulevard, the same year, which would have required the closure of the West Side Highway&#x27;s 72nd Street exit ramp. Work on 240 Riverside was delayed by opposition from residents of the neighboring Chatsworth Apartments, who feared the building would obstruct their windows, as well as objections from local residents who wanted the 72nd Street exit ramp to remain open. Despite the opposition, 240 Riverside was under construction by 2003. A second segment of Riverside Park South opened that June, and local residents attempted to preserve two burned piers within the park. The city government agreed in early 2004 to close the 72nd Street exit ramp; a state judge placed an injunction preventing the ramp&#x27;s closure, but an appeals court upheld the plans. By the end of 2004, a seventh building at 120 Riverside Boulevard was being completed. Due to legal disputes, the 72nd Street exit ramp remained open for three more years.

=== Site resale and completion ===

==== Carlyle and Extell takeover ====
Trump and his partners sold Riverside South, excluding the finished condominiums, to the Carlyle Group and the Extell Development Company for $1.76 billion in June 2005. The syndicate had beat out several other bidders including the Related Companies, Vornado Realty Trust, and the Durst Organization. Carlyle obtained a 50% ownership stake in the project, while Extell took a 25% stake and sold the remaining 25% to an Irish development consortium. Shortly afterward, Carlyle and Extell resold three rental apartment buildings to Equity Residential for $816 million. Trump, who contended that the sale price was just over half what the property was worth, sued his partners, but he lost. The Corcoran Group also sued Trump, claiming that he had failed to pay sales commissions for apartments sold there. Carlyle and Extell also attempted to sell the land between 59th and 61st streets before withdrawing their plans in December 2005. The seventh structure, 120 Riverside Boulevard, opened in early 2006, and the developers began erecting the northbound West Side Highway tunnel between 62nd and 65th streets that year. The third phase of Riverside Park South opened that August, and the development&#x27;s first supermarket also opened in 2006. 

In the mid-2000s, Extell developed the Avery condominium building at 100 Riverside Boulevard, as well as the Rushmore nearby at 80 Riverside Boulevard. The West Side Highway&#x27;s 72nd Street exit finally closed in June 2007, though the connection from Riverside Boulevard to Riverside Drive did not open for another four years. A fourth section of Riverside Park South opened in 2008. Thomas Balsley subsequently designed three more sections of the park. In addition, Extell began developing the Aldyn condominium and a rental tower between 62nd and 63rd streets in early 2008, and it received a $613 million loan to develop the towers. The Avery was finished in 2008, followed by the Rushmore in 2009 and the Aldyn in 2010. Amid weakening demand for condos at the Aldyn, Avery, and Rushmore, several prospective condo buyers sought to cancel their purchases. Multiple would-be buyers at the Rushmore sued Carlyle and Extell in 2009 after the developers refused to refund their apartment deposits; they received a $15 million refund after three years of litigation. Extell filed plans for 40 Riverside Boulevard (later One Riverside Park), just north of Riverside Center, in 2009, and Hill West Architects was hired to design a 33-story building on that site.

==== Riverside Center and Waterline Square ====

The southernmost section of Riverside South, which had been set aside for television studios, needed to be rezoned before residential structures could be built there. In October 2008, Extell proposed constructing Riverside Center, a set of five mostly residential towers between 59th and 61st streets, to complete the development. Originally, Christian de Portzamparc was hired to design the buildings. Riverside Center, covering , was modeled on the design of Battery Park City, with 2,500 residential units, retail, a cinema, a K-5 school, a hotel, and open space. The first site, known as site 2, would have contained 616 apartments and a school. Local residents quickly organized in opposition to the plans; among other things, they objected to the presence of 1,800 parking spaces and an automobile dealership. In mid-2010, Community Board 7 voted to recommend that the city government disapprove the plans for Riverside Center, and Manhattan borough president Scott Stringer also refused to accept the plans. In response, two lawyers and three lobbyists from Extell began negotiating with the city government. Extell agreed to add a school and affordable housing, cancel plans for a department store, and improve parks in the area.

The City Council approved Riverside Center&#x27;s towers in December 2010 following a protracted dispute over the zoning. Extell hired Dattner Architects to design Riverside Center&#x27;s school in 2011, Community Board 7 approved plans for the first Riverside Center building, occupying site 2, in August 2012. The Carlyle Group subsequently solicited bids for the development of the Riverside Center sites, inviting Extell to submit a bid. Dermot Realty Management Company won the bid to develop site 2, and the company bought the site in December 2012 for $70 million. Dermot also hired SLCE Architects to design the building at site 2, replacing de Portzamparc as the architect there. Silverstein Properties and El-Ad Group paid $160 million in 2013 for One West End Avenue, one of the five sites in the Riverside Center project. Silverstein and El-Ad&#x27;s site became the One West End condominium building, while Dermot&#x27;s site became the 21 West End Avenue rental building. 

In 2014, Extell announced plans for the remaining three sites in Riverside Center. Extell never developed the remaining Riverside Center sites. General Investment and Development Companies (GID) bought the site at 400 West 61st Street in May 2015, and GID bought additional land at 20 Riverside Boulevard that November. GID bought the remaining tract at Riverside Center in December 2015. The project became Waterline Square, which was completed in 2020; the Waterline Square project includes three towers with 1,132 total units. Richard Meier &amp; Partners, Kohn Pedersen Fox, and Rafael Viñoly designed the three Waterline Square towers.

==== 2010s to present ====
The Collegiate School agreed to move to Riverside South in 2013 and announced plans for a 10-story campus building at 301 Freedom Place South the next year. Extell began selling units at One Riverside Park in late 2013, and it subsequently opened a housing lottery for that building&#x27;s affordable apartments. Silverstein and El Ad began selling the condos at One West End in 2015, and they also launched an affordable-housing lottery for that building. Dermot also began renting out units at 21 West End Avenue in 2016. 

The first seven Riverside South buildings were originally known as Trump Place, and six of these buildings (excluding 240 Riverside Boulevard) contained large signs with that name on their facades. After Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election, the residents of 140, 160, and 180 Riverside Boulevard voted to remove the Trump Place signage from their respective structures. Many of these residents had been politically opposed to Trump and had signed petitions in favor of the removal of the Trump name. The Trump signage was removed from 200 Riverside Boulevard in October 2018 after that building&#x27;s residents also voted to remove the signs. The Trump signage was also removed from the facade of 120 Riverside Boulevard in 2019; this was followed shortly afterward by the removal of Trump signage on 220 Riverside Boulevard, the final building in the complex that still bore the Trump Place name.

Riverside Park South&#x27;s fifth phase opened in 2020. A&amp;E Real Estate bought 140 Riverside Boulevard in 2022 for $266 million, and that firm paid another $415 million for 160 Riverside Boulevard the same year.

== Buildings ==

Overall, the development consists of 19 apartment buildings, condominiums, and lease properties. , the buildings housed a combined 8,000 people; the area was collectively called &quot;Riverside Boulevard&quot; after its main street, or &quot;The Strip&quot; after its long, narrow shape. Six more towers with a combined 3,000 units, as well as a school, a hotel, retail and restaurant space, and space for a movie theater, had yet to be completed. A park between the buildings was in the planning stages. The towers were constructed as green buildings. Each structure&#x27;s facade has a setback no higher than from the street; this was intended to reduce the buildings&#x27; visual impact.

Most living units in Riverside South are high-end housing, costing at least $. Per-foot real estate prices for Riverside South housing rose 66% from 2004 to 2014, compared with a 43% increase in real estate on the Upper West Side overall. For instance, baseball player Alex Rodriguez bought a 39th-floor Rushmore condominium for $5.5 million in March 2011, then sold it for $8 million in January 2012. At the same time, 12% to 20% of the units are designated as affordable, as required by the CPC approval of the project. Some buildings in the development, such as One Riverside Park, were controversial having separate entrances for affordable-housing residents, despite the legality of such &quot;poor doors&quot; in mixed-housing buildings.

=== Notable structures ===

Trump and Hudson Waterfront Associates built the first seven buildings at Riverside South. Three additional buildings were completed by Extell: the Avery, the Rushmore, and the Aldyn. To attract families, Extell added various amenities to these three buildings, including playrooms, a bowling alley, a basketball court, and other sports facilities. The southern end of the development includes the 362-unit One West End condominium building, which includes amenities such as a cantilevered swimming pool. Next to One West End is a 616-unit rental building at 21 West End Avenue, which has a fitness center and basement pool.

== Parks ==

=== Riverside Park South ===
The Riverside Park South is an extension of Riverside Park and is funded by fees paid by Riverside South&#x27;s residents. Phase 1, a section from 72nd to 68th Streets, was opened in April 2001. Pier I at 70th Street, part of the railyard, was rebuilt; it maintains its original length of , but is narrower than originally, at . Phase 2 comprises a waterfront section from 70th Street to 65th Street and opened in June 2003. It has two plazas at 66th and 68th Streets, as well as a jagged waterfront. Phase 3, opened in August 2006, stretches from 65th to 62nd streets on the waterfront. Phase 4 opened in 2008 along the waterfront, extending from 63rd to 59th streets (overlapping with phase 3). A new mixed-use bikeway and walkway was also built through the park, linking Hudson River Park with Riverside Park.

The design of phases 5 and 6, located east of the elevated highway viaduct, was partly tied to the fate of the highway relocation. Relocating the highway will require some reconstruction of the park. A fifth phase of Riverside Park South opened in October 2020, encompassing the land east of the West Side Highway from 65th to 68th streets. The city plans to expand the park with new baseball and soccer fields, bikeways, lawns, picnic areas, and restrooms. 
The park contains site-specific sculptures, railway ruins, gardens, a waterfront promenade, and a walkway. Portions of the former rail yard were incorporated into the new park. These include the New York Central Railroad 69th Street Transfer Bridge, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As a reminder of the location&#x27;s history, New York Central Railroad logos are engraved onto park benches. A wooden pier named Pier D was originally preserved as part of the park, but it was demolished in 2011 due to extreme deterioration.

=== Other parks ===
On West End Avenue, a privately owned park has a remnant of a stone wall, as a remaining part of the embankment that dated to 1847. Construction workers had unearthed the stones during construction in 1994; some stones were salvaged for the new park during the four-day construction hiatus for archaeological excavation. There is also a private park at One West End.

== Other structures ==
Manhattan Community Board 7 members blamed Trump for failing to build the proposed enhancement and monument at Freedom Place, though the Riverside South Planning Corporation said that the Freedom Place plan was merely a concept for an arts program that was not included in the final project. A street called Freedom Place South, along the same axis as Freedom Place, runs southward from 64th to 59th streets. In addition, there is an unused tunnel underneath a portion of Riverside Boulevard between 62nd and 65th streets, which was intended to carry traffic from the West Side Highway. The tunnel measures approximately long and wide. Early plans called for the construction of a Metro-North Railroad station on the West Side Line at Riverside South as part of the Penn Station Access project; however, the station was canceled in 2010 because there was not enough space between the foundations of Riverside South&#x27;s buildings.

The IRT Powerhouse, located just south of Riverside South, was designed by Stanford White for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and is a New York City designated landmark. Adjacent to the Powerhouse is a tetrahedron-shaped building known as VIA 57 West, which was designed by Bjarke Ingels Group. In addition, the Abraham Joshua Heschel School is located on West End Avenue next to Riverside South.

<text>Night Moves is the ninth studio album by American rock singer-songwriter Bob Seger, released on October 22, 1976, by Capitol Records. It is his first studio album to credit his backing band, the Silver Bullet Band, although they only perform on five of the nine songs on the album; the other four feature backing by the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section.

The album was well received by critics and brought Bob Seger nationwide success. Three singles were released from the album; two of them made the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album became Seger&#x27;s second to become certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and was his first to be certified platinum by the same association. It later achieved a certification of 6× platinum from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

== Reception ==

&quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau wrote that the riffs on &quot;Night Moves&quot; were classic rock and roll riffs, like those performed by Chuck Berry or the Rolling Stones, and that the album was about rock and roll for those who were no longer in their teens, like the song &quot;Rock and Roll Never Forgets&quot;. The &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of the album by Kit Rachlis stated that the album was one of the best to come out of 1976–77, that Seger sounded like Rod Stewart and wrote lyrics like Bruce Springsteen, and that the album was classic rock and roll. The only criticism that Rachlis made of the album was the production not being strong enough. A later review of the album by Stephen Thomas Erlewine for AllMusic said that the album was very similar to &quot;Beautiful Loser&quot; (1975), but that &quot;Night Moves&quot; was harder than &quot;Beautiful Loser&quot;. Erlewine also said that the album had a wide range of styles and had not lost any of its influence years later.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;&#x27;Ship of Fools&#x27; might turn into a classic rocker.&quot;

&quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Janey Roberts ranked four songs from &quot;Night Moves&quot; among Seger&#x27;s 20 greatest – the three singles as well as &quot;Come to Poppa&quot;.

<doc id="1292823" wikidata="Q1894987" url="?curid=1292823" title="Tom Penny">
<text>Tom Penny (born 13 April 1977) is a professional skateboarder from Abingdon, United Kingdom (UK). As of January 2013, Penny is sponsored by the Flip skateboard deck brand and his Cheech &amp; Chong signature deck is one of the brand&#x27;s highest-selling deck products.

==Early life==
Penny was born in Abingdon, England, UK and grew up skateboarding in Oxford, England, UK. He attended the Dragon School. Penny has described his early years skateboarding in Oxford:
When I first started skateboarding in Oxford, England, there were not so many skateboarders—there were just a few skateboarders that I grew up with. There were no magazines, no skate shop, and we had no vision of the outside world of skateboarding; so, people who influenced me when I was younger, growing up, would be the friends that I grew up skateboarding with: Justin Parker, Erin Chalice, Pete Crucioli and Thomas Kilpatrick.

==Professional skateboarding==
Penny was spotted by Oxford local pro and SS20 co-owner Sean Goff and added to the SS20 shop team. He quickly gained coverage in UK skate magazines, including &quot;RAD&quot; and &quot;Skateboard!&quot;, and was featured in videos such as &quot;Rollersnakes 540&quot; and &quot;720&quot;.

===Deathbox===
Following the initial coverage that Penny received, he was soon added to the Deathbox Skateboards team by owner Jeremy Fox (Deathbox was later merged with Bash Skateboards and was re-branded as &quot;Flip&quot;). In 1993 Penny appeared in the inaugural Flip video &quot;The Long Overdue&quot;, alongside Geoff Rowley, Alex Moul, Andy Scott and Rune Glifberg—the video was made by Goff.

In 1993 Penny made his first international video appearance in &quot;411VM&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Issue 2&quot; and was featured in a &quot;Wheels of Fortune&quot; segment—Penny was 16 years of age and the segment features footage from the Radlands Skatepark in Northampton, UK. At the age of 16 years, Penny was sponsored by Flip, Independent, Droors, Union and SS20.

===United States relocation===
In late 1994, Flip left UK shores and relocated to Huntington Beach, California, US, the &quot;heart&quot; of world skateboarding. Along with other team members, Rowley, Scott and Glifberg, Penny exerted a significant impact on the skateboarding sub-culture with his small part in the Flip industry section in &quot;411VM&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Issue 11&quot;; his switch frontside flip at the Carlsbad Gap; and a five-trick downhill run that ended in a backside tailslide on a nine-stair handrail. By the end of 1995, Penny had received acclaim from notable professional skateboarders, such as Tony Hawk.

During his time in the US, Penny released video parts in the mid-1990s, such as Etnies&#x27; &quot;Hi-Five&quot;, Transworld Skateboarding&#x27;s &quot;Uno&quot;, TSA&#x27;s &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;, &quot;Balance in the World of Chaos&quot; and Dope Clothing&#x27;s &quot;Time for Tea&quot;. During this period, Penny also received his first cover photograph for &quot;Transworld&quot;, in which he is performing a frontside bluntslide in Huntington Beach. Skin Phillips, &quot;Transworld&quot;&#x27;s former editor-in-chief, stated: &quot;The other thing with Tom and really all the Flip guys when they came over was that they were absolutely unfazed by contests or demos. That’s just what they grew up skating.&quot;

During the early 2000s, Penny reappeared in Flip&#x27;s videos, &quot;Sorry&quot;, &quot;Really Sorry&quot; and &quot;Extremely Sorry&quot;.

In 2023, Penny was inducted into the Skateboarding Hall of Fame, which is in the U.S.

===Sponsors===
As of 2021, Penny is sponsored by:

*Flip Skateboards 
*éS Footwear
*Ghetto Child Wheels
*Mosaic Bearings

==Skateboarding influences==
In a 2012 interview, Penny identified the five skateboarders that have been the most influential throughout his career: Daewon Song, Rodney Mullen, Danny Way, Chad Muska and Steve Caballero. He also acknowledged contemporary influences, such as Quim Cardona, Paulo Diaz and Sean Sheffey—&quot;People that are slightly interesting; make it more fun; make it more enjoyable; more original skateboarders; stylish skateboarders&quot;.

==Influence==
Professional skateboarder Chad Muska, has explained his experience of skateboarding with Tom Penny in the 1990s:
That was pretty much the craziest part of it all. It was almost like he didn&#x27;t know he was doing anything special. None of it was conscious. Nothing he&#x27;s done has been conscious [laughs]. It&#x27;s just all-natural. His whole life is like that ... Anywhere you went he would just bust something—no cameras, nothing. None of it was ever planned in any way. It was never like, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna do this and I&#x27;ll get this cover and be a superstar.&quot; It was just, &quot;Oh, there&#x27;s an obstacle in front of me and I want to do this down it.&quot; Boom. &quot;I&#x27;m just doing it.&quot;

Geoff Rowley and Andrew Reynolds are two other professional skateboarders (both are also company owners) who have also publicly praised Penny and Reynolds has described the filming of Penny&#x27;s footage for the &quot;Etnies&quot; &quot;High Five&quot; video:
Oh man. The switch flip. It’s unexplainable. That whole thing is just like the Penny package. It’s like a display. Not many people have got kickflip, frontside flip, switch frontside flip, and switch flip all looking exactly the same. It wasn’t even really that common to do tricks over handrails at that point. He just killed it.

In December 2011, Penny was identified as the twenty-first most influential skateboarder of all time by &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; magazine; however, Phillips had first revealed his perspective on Penny in 2009:
That was just sort of the way Penny was. He was nonchalant. He sort of didn’t realise—I don’t think he’s ever realised the impact he’s had on skateboarding. He never thought about it. Everything was just natural. Were his lines thought out before? Probably to an extent based on what he’d been doing in practice. But none of it was premeditated like, &quot;Right, I’m gonna do this here, then hit the hip, then hit the pyramid&quot;. It was just flow.

&quot;Transworld&quot; then introduced Penny&#x27;s 2012 interview for the &quot;Most Influential&quot; series with the following blurb: &quot;Tom Penny changed everything that came before him. Tom’s technique, on any terrain, was so fluid and nonchalant that within six months of his arrival on US soil back in &#x27;94, every pro on the planet wanted to skate like him.&quot;

In July 2013, professional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez identified Penny in his &quot;top ten&quot; list of professional skateboarders, explaining that &quot;Tom to me was like a mythical figure ... To me his style was my favorite in skateboarding just the way moves, the way he did his tricks, it looked so lazy and so buttery.&quot;

==Contest history==
Penny made his debut at the 1993 UK Championships Contest at Radlands, where he came 3rd—US skateboarder, Willy Santos, won the contest.

Penny returned to Radlands in 1994 for the UK Championships and finished in 6th place; US contestant, Mike Santarossa, won the contest.

Penny won the 1995 Radlands UK Championships Contest, which had evolved into one of the world&#x27;s biggest contests. Penny beat over 100 other competitors, including over 75 US professionals, including Ray Barbee, Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Andrew Reynolds, Ed Templeton, Eric Koston, Phil Shao (now deceased) and Jamie Thomas.

<doc id="1292830" wikidata="Q375630" url="?curid=1292830" title="Muharraq Governorate">
<text>The Muharraq Governorate () is one of the four governorates of Bahrain. It is now co-extensive with the municipality of Al Muharraq and with Muharraq Island together with outlying islets. It includes the former municipality of Al Hadd at the southern end of that island.

The centre of Muharraq contains some of the oldest residential properties in the Kingdom, many of which have been rented out by their Bahraini owners to expatriate workers. There are also many buildings of historic interest in the town&#x27;s crowded lanes, including the Shaikh Isa bin Ali House, Siyadi House, the wind towers, the infamous Falcon Statue and the neighbourhood of journalist Abdullah Al Zayed House, as well as the impressive Arad Fort.

The government has been accused on not putting enough money into the restoration of these historic sites to turn them into tourist attractions. The head of Salafist Asalah party, Ghanim Al Buaneen, responded to news that the government was to invest BD5 million into protecting these sites by dismissing the amount as too little and said the island needed between BD50 million and BD100 million for the facelift of entire old areas. Al-Menbar Islamic Society MP Dr Ali Ahmed said the effort to preserve Bahrain&#x27;s traditions had not been a success story due to the government&#x27;s poor planning and the public unawareness about the initiatives.

Local councillor Majeed Karimi came to international prominence in 2005 when his spearheaded Islamist party, Al Wefaq&#x27;s campaign decided to ban lingerie mannequins, blaming them for rising divorce rates in the area. While Al-Menbar Islamic Society local councillor, Saleh Al Jowder, launched his bid for a parliamentary seat in 2006&#x27;s election by announcing that the council would deal with complaints about peeping toms by fitting all multistorey buildings with one way glass so that residents cannot see out.

Muharraq island is also the site of Bahrain International Airport, although the local Asalah MP has called for it to be relocated because the sound of aeroplanes landing and taking off has disturbed local residents.

<text>Stranger in Town is the tenth studio album by American rock singer Bob Seger and his second with the Silver Bullet Band, released by Capitol Records in May 1978. As with its predecessor, the Silver Bullet Band backed Seger on about half of the songs and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section backed Seger on the other half.

The album became an instant success in the United States, being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) less than a month after the album&#x27;s release, and, like its predecessor &quot;Night Moves&quot;, it would later go 6× Platinum. It was also his first album to chart in the UK, where limited editions were released on silver vinyl and in picture disc format as well as standard black vinyl.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that, &quot;while [the album] reaffirms that Mr. Seger is a fine rock singer and a sometimes sensitive songwriter, it also suggests that his gifts aren&#x27;t so varied or consistent as they might be.&quot;

<doc id="1292859" wikidata="Q12251986" url="?curid=1292859" title="Utopia (Tawfik novel)">
<text>Utopia is a social novel by Egyptian author Ahmed Khaled Tawfik, published in 2008. It is his first novel released outside the Modern Arab Association, and it ranked second on the best-selling books list at Merit Publishing.

The novel was serialized in six parts in the Egyptian newspaper &quot;Al-Dustour&quot; in 2006, but additional events were included in the book. It was published by Merit Publishing in 2008, and an English translation was released by Bloomsbury Publishing.

== Synopsis ==
The novel is set in the year 2023, where Egypt is divided into two classes. The first is extremely wealthy and lives in luxury in Utopia, a city surrounded by walls and guarded by Marines, located on the North Coast. The second class lives in abject poverty, residing in slums and fighting for food. The story follows a wealthy young man from Utopia who seeks adventure to break the monotony and boredom of life by hunting a poor human from the Shubra area. He plans to toy with him alongside his friends for enjoyment before killing him and keeping a part of his body as a trophy, which is a new hobby among the rich living in Utopia, representing the world of the affluent.

Ahmed Khaled Tawfik explicitly relies on scientific statistics and reports in certain parts, such as a report by Dr. Ahmed Okasha on addiction in Egypt and a journalistic report from the Forum for Development and Human Rights Dialogue on violence against women. He also references the website Masrawy as one of the online sources.

The poet &quot;Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi&quot; appears with his political and national poems on the pages of the novel.

== Main characters ==
* Utopian young man: He introduced himself as &quot;Alaa&quot;, the son of (&quot;Murad Pasha&quot;), a wealthy young man living in Utopia who has grown tired of his affluent life.
* Germinal: &quot;Alaa&#x27;s&quot; friend who leaves Utopia with him.
* Jaber: The poor, educated young man who shelters &quot;Alaa&quot; and &quot;Germinal&quot; in his home.
* Safiya: &quot;Jaber&#x27;s&quot; sister.

== Reception ==
The English translation has been reviewed in several journals and books.

In 2015, it was announced that &quot;Utopia&quot; was going to be adapted into a movie.

<doc id="1292882" wikidata="Q2826357" url="?curid=1292882" title="Against the Wind (album)">
<text>Against the Wind is the eleventh studio album by American rock singer Bob Seger and his third which credits the Silver Bullet Band. Like many of his albums, about half of the tracks feature the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section as backing musicians. It was released in February 1980. It is Seger&#x27;s only number-one album to date, spending six weeks at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart, knocking Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; from the top spot. Seger said that the album &quot;is about trying to move ahead, keeping your sanity and integrity at the same time.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Against the Wind&quot; was an immediate commercial success, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart in its third week and remaining there for five weeks behind Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot; before reaching No. 1 and holding the top position for six weeks. By late 1981 the album sold 3.7 million copies in the United States and was certified 5× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2003.

Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band won the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for the album &quot;Against the Wind&quot; and Capitol Records art director Roy Kohara won the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package.

==Critical reception==

Rock critic Dave Marsh, writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, strongly criticized the album as a betrayal of Seger&#x27;s longtime fans: &quot;I&#x27;d like to say that this is not only the worst record Bob Seger has ever made, but an absolutely cowardly one as well&quot; saying that Seger had crafted &quot;failureproof songs that are utterly listenable and quite meaningless.&quot; Marsh had followed Seger since before &quot;Night Moves&quot;, when Seger finally gained national fame, and said in his review that Seger&#x27;s long, tireless struggle to stardom is trivialized by this record. &quot;He had to fight hard to prove there was still a place in rock &amp; roll for a guy like him, and, with &quot;Night Moves&quot;, he won. This is the LP that makes such a victory meaningless ... It makes me sad, and it makes me angry (another emotion that&#x27;s disappeared here, though it&#x27;s often fueled Seger&#x27;s finest work).&quot;

Marsh did concede that on the album &quot;Seger sings fantastically well&quot; and called it a &quot;carefully constructed album.&quot; A review in &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; echoed some of Marsh&#x27;s criticisms, saying that Seger offered nothing that hadn&#x27;t been heard before or equaled his best work, &quot;only heavy-handed efforts to simulate it.&quot;

In a more positive review in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, critic Robert Hilburn said the album was &quot;close to [Seger&#x27;s] earlier works&quot; but represented a &quot;mastering of the form&quot; and that the reflective ballads stood out. John Rockwell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it an &quot;honest, attractive album&quot; and a &quot;nice return to his &quot;Night Moves&quot; form.&quot;

<text>Auburndale is one of the thirteen villages within the city of Newton in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. It lies at the western end of Newton near the intersection of interstate highways 90 and 95. It is bisected by the Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90). Auburndale is surrounded by three other Newton villages (West Newton, Waban, and Newton Lower Falls) as well as the city of Waltham and the Charles River. Auburndale is the home of Williams and Burr elementary schools, as well as Lasell College. Auburndale Square is the location of the Plummer Memorial Library, which is run by the Auburndale Community Library and no longer affiliated with the Newton Free Library, the Turtle Lane Playhouse, and many small businesses.

==History==
The first major settler in the area was William Robinson, who built a house in 1678 on what is now Freeman Street. The oldest house in Auburndale stands at 473 Auburn Street and was built in 1730 by William Robinson.

Auburndale, once billed as &quot;Auburndale-on-the-Charles&quot;, was the home of Norumbega Park, which closed in 1963. The park included rides, a zoo, and boating. The nationally famous big band venue Totem Pole Ballroom was associated with Norumbega Park and closed in 1964. The area now contains over 80 acres of conservation land, as well as access to the Charles River.

==Transportation==
Auburndale is divided into two parts by the Massachusetts Turnpike, which connects it to neighboring villages of Newton and downtown Boston. The village is located adjacent to the intersection of interstate highways 90 and 95.

A number of public transportation options connect Auburndale to neighboring communities. The MBTA Green Line&#x27;s D Branch light rail line serves Auburndale at Woodland and Riverside stations, the latter being the line&#x27;s terminus. Both stations have bus connections; Woodland station is served by MWRTA bus routes 1 and 8, while Riverside connects to MBTA bus route 558.

The MBTA Commuter Rail&#x27;s Framingham/Worcester Line serves the village at Auburndale station, adjacent to the Massachusetts Turnpike. MBTA bus routes 505 and 558, which offer express service to downtown Boston, both stop at the station.

<doc id="1292902" wikidata="Q967056" url="?curid=1292902" title="SoundFont">
<text>SoundFont is a brand name that collectively refers to a file format and associated technology that uses sample-based synthesis to play MIDI files. It was first used on the Sound Blaster AWE32 sound card for its General MIDI support.

SoundFont is a registered trademark of Creative Technology, Ltd., and the exclusive license for re-formatting and managing historical SoundFont content has been acquired by Digital Sound Factory.

Starting in the late 2010s, the derived term &quot;soundfont&quot; has gradually gained online colloquial status to refer to chiptune – specifically the soundscape of a console&#x27;s sound chip. Any video game console that utilizes sequenced audio is often referred as having &quot;the [console] soundfont&quot;, similar to the usage of to refer to any soft drink. Additionally, it can also refer to a video game&#x27;s audio data that specifically uses reusable digital samples.

== Specification ==
The newest version of the SoundFont file format is 2.04 (or 2.4). It is based on the RIFF format.

== History ==
The original SoundFont file format was developed in the early 1990s by E-mu Systems and Creative Labs. A specification for this version was never released to the public. The first and only major device to utilize this version was Creative&#x27;s Sound Blaster AWE32 in 1994. Files in this format conventionally have the file extension of .

SoundFont 2.0 was developed in 1996. This file format generalized the data representation using perceptually additive real world units, redefined some of the instrument layering features within the format, added true stereo sample support and removed some obscure features of the first version whose behavior was difficult to specify. This version was fully disclosed as a public specification, with the goal of making the SoundFont format an industry standard. All SoundFont 1.0 compatible devices were updated to support the SoundFont 2.0 format shortly after it was released to the public, and consequently the 1.0 version became obsolete. Files in this and all other 2.x formats (see below) conventionally have the file extension of .

Version 2.01 (or 2.1) of the SoundFont file format was introduced in 1998, with an E-mu sound card product called the Audio Production Studio. This version added features allowing sound designers to configure the way MIDI controllers influence synthesizer parameters. It is bidirectionally compatible with 2.0, which means that synthesizers capable of rendering 2.01 format will also by definition render 2.0 format, and synthesizers that are only capable of rendering 2.0 format will also read and render the new format, but just not apply the new features.

SoundFont 2.04 was introduced in 2005 with the Sound Blaster X-Fi. The 2.04 format added support for 24-bit samples. The 2.04 format is bidirectionally compatible with the 2.01 format, so synthesizers that are only capable of rendering 2.0 or 2.01 format would automatically render instruments using 24-bit samples at 16-bit precision.

== Functionality ==

MIDI files do not contain any sounds, only instructions to play them. To play such files, sample-based MIDI synthesizers use recordings of instruments and sounds stored in a file or ROM chip. SoundFont-compatible synthesizers allow users to use SoundFont banks with custom samples to play their music.

A SoundFont bank contains base samples in PCM format (the audio data format most commonly used in WAV containers) mapped to sections on a musical keyboard. A SoundFont bank also contains other music synthesis parameters such as loops, vibrato effect, and velocity-sensitive volume changing.

SoundFont banks can conform to standard sound sets such as General MIDI, or use other wholly custom sound-set definitions like Roland GS and Yamaha XG.

== SoundFont creation software ( format) ==

Several editors are available:

* Vienna from Creative Labs, requiring a particular sound card (such as Sound Blaster)
* Viena (with a single &quot;n&quot;), created in 2002
* Swami is a collection of free software for editing and managing musical instruments for MIDI music composition, used mainly under Linux
* Polyphone, free editor for Windows, Mac OS and Linux created in 2013

<text>Agricultural Society Fair Grounds was a fairground on the west side of Rockford, Illinois. It served as the grounds for the Winnebago County Agricultural Society. It was used as a baseball grounds by the Rockford Forest Citys baseball club of the National Association during the 1871 season, so it is considered a major league ballpark by those who consider the NA to have been a major league. The Forest Citys had played their home games at the Fair Grounds beginning in 1866, and continued to call it home for the 1871 season.

The Forest Citys had been a strong team during their amateur / semi-professional years, but before the 1871 season began, their star pitcher Al Spalding had signed with the Boston Red Stockings. The Forest Citys played only 6 home games during the 1871 season, and finished in last place in the new league. The rest of their star players, including Cap Anson and Bob Addy, signed with other teams for 1872, and the Rockford Forest Citys disbanded.

Contemporary and historical accounts describe the park during the 1866-1871 period as woefully inadequate for organized baseball, with trees blocking much of foul ground, and third base being uphill from the rest of the diamond.

By the 1890s the property was called Fair Grounds Park and was an occasional home field for Rockford&#x27;s minor league clubs. The Winnebago County Fair, after some 50 years at this location, temporarily folded in 1903 and the fairgrounds were sold to the city of Rockford. The fair was revived a few years later, moving into rural land. In modern times the old fairgrounds is neither a fairgrounds nor a ballpark, but Fairgrounds Park (as it is now spelled) still exists, as a part of the Rockford Park District.

The original boundaries of the fairgrounds, as shown on contemporary maps, were Oak (now Acorn) Street (north); Pecatonica Street and Cherry Street (northeast); buildings and Horsman Street (east); Mulberry Street (south); and Kent Creek and railroad tracks (west). 

The current footprint of the park is somewhat smaller than it originally was, with the boundaries being the Harkins Aquatic Center and Acorn Street (north); Kilburn Avenue, buildings and Horsman Street (east); West Jefferson Street aka Business US-20 (south); and Mulberry Street, Kent Creek and railroad tracks (west). The street address now 900 West Jefferson.

<text>Athletic Park is a former baseball ground located in Washington, D.C. The ground was home to the Washington Nationals aka &quot;Statesmen&quot;, of the American Association in .

The ballfield was located at S Street NW (south); 9th Street NW (east); T Street NW (north); and 10th Street NW (west); about a quarter mile southwest of the eventual site of Griffith Stadium. The club folded before the 1884 season ended.

The ballpark was first mentioned by that name in local newspapers in 1883, and continued to appear as a site for a variety of public events as late as 1888. By 1889 the block was being cut into lots for new housing. The site is now occupied by residences and education-related buildings.

<text>is a 2004 anime television series. Written differently (泡沫), the title can refer to bubbles and is used as such in the ending theme.

The series can be loosely considered a magical girl story. However, this series deviates from more conventional magical girl themes in that it addresses topics that are for a more mature audience, such as child abuse, eating disorders, and possibly misanthropy. Nevertheless, it illustrates the main character&#x27;s coming of age with each episode, becoming more and more emotionally intense as the story goes on.

The story follows Ichika Tachibana&#x27;s life over a summer holiday when she meets Manatsu Kuroki. The series details their summer activities and the use of special creatures called Djinn (ジン &quot;jin&quot;) that lend their powers to Ichika to help her and her friends when they invariably find themselves in danger and eventually for their own motives.

==Plot==
On the day before the summer holiday, Ichika Tachibana discovers that the charm attached to her cell phone has somehow wound up inside a mirror in the old school building. A girl named Manatsu Kuroki, inside the mirror, offers to return the charm and phone in exchange for a favor. When Ichika accepts, Manatsu emerges from the mirror, but Ichika finds to her chagrin that the charm&#x27;s stones have taken on different colors. Her indignation soon turns to delight as she is transformed by the charm and given an incredibly moving experience in the skies above Kamakura.

After returning to the old classroom, Manatsu asks that Ichika use all the colored stones in the charm and record her experiences and thoughts. Starting with the facade of Manatsu as her text-message pal, Ichika begins to entangle herself in a web of small lies and deceptions.

When Ichika faces dangers during the summer holiday, she at first uses the Djinn&#x27;s power in the stones to resolve them supernaturally. But as the summer draws on, she begins to use the power even though there is no imminent danger. Through each experience with the Djinn she learns about her willfulness and that of others. Slowly, the power of the Djinn erodes her emotional, physical, and mental strength, and she abuses the power to the point of attempting murder.

Meanwhile, Ichika&#x27;s tutors, Sei and Kai, are tormented by Ichika&#x27;s ordeal — Sei went through the very same thing six years ago. They very much want to prevent Ichika from experiencing the same trials but are bound to the rules of the ritual. When Sei tried to interfere, he was turned into stone as a penalty. Although Ichika tries to abandon using the Djinn&#x27;s power altogether, she finds herself losing control over her actions. Faced with fear, sadness, or anger, she finds that the Djinn grant her power against her will. Not only this, she finds that she cannot discard the charm, as it will fly back to her.

Ichika had been subjected to a ritual judgment determined from the time she was conceived. Saya, the final Djinn, would take a person of fourteen years — the age between the innocence of childhood and the hardness of adulthood — and show him or her the world through the eyes of the Djinn. The individual would experience seven trials that contrasted seven virtues and sins: affection and resentment, temperance and hubris, devotion and rebellion, honesty and treachery, reason and envy, passion and lust, wisdom and machination. When Ichika is thus led to despair in humanity and disgust of herself, Saya binds her to the mirror and asks her to decide whether to destroy humanity or herself.

In response, Ichika refuses to choose either. Saya declares that as a violation of the rules and drives her scythe toward Ichika&#x27;s body. Sei shatters his stone skin and tries to stop the scythe, but Ichika decides that it is better that she die rather than see him hurt. Manatsu, in defiance, drives herself into the scythe, saving Ichika&#x27;s life. Kai returns the life energy that kept him in human form to Sei, and he and Manatsu revert to their original forms: shards of the old mirror.

When school resumed in the fall, Ichika decided to remain at Kamakura rather than join her parents in Italy. Elsewhere, Saya determined to move on and judge the next teenager.

===OVA===
In the OVA , Ichika hears that Manatsu has been seen again, one week before her birthday. Not long after the fall term had begun, Sei had transferred to a German university in an exchange program. On Christmas Eve, both discover that Manatsu and Kai&#x27;s shards had vanished, and they reunite with Ichika and Sei, respectively. They had returned for one last night and to say goodbye. After an evening with Ichika and Sei, the shards return to Saya&#x27;s old mirror during the night. The next spring, Ichika enters a new school year with her friends, while Saya&#x27;s experiments continue with a new test subject.

==Characters==
:Ichika is a 14-year-old Japanese middle school student living in Kamakura, who discovers on the day before summer holiday that a gift from her tutor is much more than a good-luck charm.

:She is honest and polite to everyone, including her own parents, and always tries to do the right thing. She detests lying, especially if she finds herself doing it. As a result, her friends often playfully tease her for being straight-laced. Ichika is easily scared, and the thought of ghosts terrifies her, especially when she first sees Manatsu in a mirror they find in the school&#x27;s oldest building.

:&quot;Voiced by&quot; Yōko Honda
:Manatsu is a girl that Ichika met in dreams and a mirror.

:Manatsu seems to be the polar opposite of Ichika in personality. When Ichika is hesitant, Manatsu is carefree and assertive; where the former is reserved, the latter is cheerfully outgoing. She also has striking similarities to Ichika — she knows and loves many of the same things Ichika does, and she shares the same fear of ghosts.

:&quot;Voiced by&quot; Masumi Asano
:Ichika introduces her friend Satsuki as &quot;a very responsible and strong person. You can always count on her.&quot; She is a brash girl who often takes the lead of Ichika and the other friends. A painful memory causes her to avoid most boys, despite her seemingly strong personality. Satsuki has an older brother, with whom she apparently gets along well, despite the fact that they bicker a fair bit.

:&quot;Voiced by&quot; Tomoko Kawakami
:Ichika describes her friend Keiko as &quot;a proper young lady from a good family, gentle and kind.&quot; She is easily amused by simple things, such as shaking a duster in a sunbeam. Her parents appear to be rather controlling, which causes Keiko some distress in regard to a boy she liked.

:&quot;Voiced by&quot; Yurika Ochiai
:Ichika says of her friend Michiru, &quot;She&#x27;s really into literature, and her instincts are amazingly sharp.&quot; Due to being a miko and having the &quot;power of vision&quot;, she can allegedly see ghosts and spirits. She is a quiet, if not shy, person. Michiru has a younger sister named Rui, of whose feelings she appears to be rather protective. Michiru is prone to making slightly odd comments and is unable to swim in the sea, claiming her skin is sensitive to saltwater. She tends to speak in a subdued tone of voice.

:&quot;Voiced by&quot; Yukari Tamura
:Sei is one of Ichika&#x27;s tutors and a high school student. He instructs her in grammar, literature, and social sciences. He is introduced as the twin brother of Kai. Of the two, Sei usually seems to be the calmer, gentler one. Ichika has developed romantic feelings for him.

:&quot;Voiced by&quot; Nobuo Tobita
:Kai is Ichika&#x27;s other tutor. He teaches her math and science. He is introduced as the twin brother of Sei. Of the two, Kai seems the more extroverted one and more physical. He is in love with his twin brother.

:&quot;Voiced by&quot; Nobutoshi Kanna
:Saya is an enigmatic woman who is, at times, hidden from view of most people. She is the Tachibanas&#x27; next door neighbor and is in the fashion industry.

:But this is only an illusion — she covertly pushes circumstances in Ichika&#x27;s life to bring her to use the power of the Djinns. She can move anywhere at will, turn her scarf into a deadly scythe and other objects and keeps an eye on Ichika throughout the series. She strictly enforces rules concerning the activation of the stones: The current bearer must remain completely in the dark as to their true nature and purpose and no one may interfere with the bearer&#x27;s decision to use the power.

:&quot;Voiced by&quot; Maria Kawamura

==Episode list==
Similar to gímik&#x27;s earlier work, &quot;Kiddy Grade&quot; (where a different guest artist drew the eyecatches for each episode), each episode&#x27;s main costume was designed by a guest artist who also created artwork for the ending sequence of that episode.

Each episode preview in the anime was narrated by Ichika in the style of a diary entry. On the website, a corresponding entry narrated by Manatsu is available.

In a possible variation of the four-character yojijukugo, every title is composed of a pair of two-kanji words separated by a &quot;no&quot; particle. A literal, if rough, translation of most titles can be derived by assembling the phrase &quot;[second word] of (the) [first word]&quot;.

The TV series and OVA has been licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks; anime distributor Section23 Films released the complete collection set on November 2, 2010.

==Reaction==
&quot;The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917&quot; compares the series&#x27; underlying themes to those of &quot;Mahoromatic&quot;, noting that the story is &quot;an allegory of the end of childhood and one last vacation before the responsibilities of the grown-up world start to impinge&quot;. It criticizes the OVA episode, calling it &quot;a rather pointless rehash that to some minds betrays the elegiac quality of the original series—if everything can be reset and reprised à la &quot;Tenchi Muyo!&quot;, where&#x27;s the drama?&quot;

<doc id="1292953" wikidata="Q7248782" url="?curid=1292953" title="Progressive Party (Philippines)">
<text>The Progressive Party of the Philippines (PPP), also known as the Party for Philippine Progress, was a reformist political party that existed in the late 1950s and the 1960s. It is considered to be the earliest Filipino form of a genuine alternative party to the then-dominant political pair of the Nacionalista Party and the Liberal Party. The party ceased to exist by 1969.

==History==
===1950s===
The party was founded in 1957 by Manuel Manahan and Raul Manglapus, both of whom had served as key members of the administration of President Ramon Magsaysay before his untimely death earlier that year. The formation came as a result of the dissatisfaction of members of the Nacionalista Party over the &quot;cold treatment&quot; given to them by allies of newly installed President Carlos P. Garcia.

In the 1957 general election held later that year, Manahan ran as the standard-bearer of the new party while Vicente Araneta served as his running mate. The party also fielded a complete slate of eight senatorial candidates, among them being Manglapus.

Manahan launched a campaign similar to that of the deceased but still popular Magsaysay, thus allowing him to become popular with the masses and pose a credible threat to President Garcia and Jose Yulo of the Liberal Party. In the end, Manahan only ranked third behind President Garcia, managing to acquire 20.90 percent of the vote. Araneta, on the other hand, lost to Diosdado Macapagal of the Liberal Party, garnering 7.97 percent of the vote. None of the senatorial candidates in the party won seats in the Senate.

In the 1959 midterm election, the party allied itself with defectors of the Liberal Party and the Nacionalista Party to form the Grand Alliance. During the campaign, the Grand Alliance highlighted the graft and corruption taking place under the Garcia administration. Eventually, the Alliance was successful in diminishing the Senate majority of the Nacionalista Party.

===1960s===
In 1961, the Progressive party, under the Grand Alliance, joined forces with the Liberal Party in order to prevent the re-election of President Garcia. Together, the united parties supported Vice-President Macapagal of the Liberal Party as its candidate for the 1961 presidential election and Emmanuel Pelaez of the Progressive Party as his running mate. Progressives Manglapus and Manahan also ran as guest senatorial candidates of the Liberal Party, with both of them managing to win seats in the Senate.

By 1965, members of the Grand Alliance separated themselves from the Liberal Party due to their dissatisfaction with the Macapagal administration for not fulfilling their expectations. Soon, the Progressive Party was renamed as the Party for Philippine Progress. It fielded Manglapus as its presidential candidate for the general election held later that year, and Manahan ran as its vice-presidential candidate. The rejuvenated party also fielded its own senatorial slate, though it was incomplete.

Widely known as the Third Force, the Party for Philippine Progress was seen as a genuine alternative to President Macapagal and Senator Ferdinand Marcos of the Nacionalista Party. Manglapus, in particular, showed surprising strength in the larger cities and the young voters. But unlike the 1957 election in which Manahan was seen as a viable contender, Manglapus was not seen as having a good chance of winning the election. In the end, Manglapus lost to Marcos with 5.17 percent of the vote, while Manahan lost to Fernando Lopez, the running mate of Marcos, with 3.40 percent of the vote.

The party continued to exist until it quietly disbanded in 1969.

==Legacy==
Despite the decline of the party, it had considerable influence in current Philippine politics. For instance, the Lakas–CMD, an active center-right political party in the country, considers the Progressive Party as its predecessor, largely because Manglapus was one of the earliest members of Lakas in the 1990s.

Elements of progressive political philosophy are also believed to have been passed on to later politicians no matter what part of the political spectrum they may belong to, such as former senator Raul Roco, and the philosophy was one of the main ideology of Roco&#x27;s founded party Aksyon.

It was home to the short-lived Philadelphia Centennials baseball club of the National Association during the 1875 season, so it is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the NA as a major league. It was also the site of one home game by the Athletics. It occupied the same block as the later Recreation Park.

<text>The Sunshine Coast Regional District is a regional district in British Columbia, Canada. It is located on the southern mainland coast, across Georgia Strait (part of the Salish Sea) from Vancouver Island. It borders on the qathet Regional District to the north, the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District to the east, and, across Howe Sound, the Metro Vancouver District to the south. The regional district offices are located in the District Municipality of Sechelt.

==Geography==
The majority of the Sunshine Coast is sparsely populated. The Coast Mountains make up the inland area. Population is concentrated along the coast. Midway up the coast, beginning at the town of Sechelt, the coastal area forms a peninsula separated from the inland area by Sechelt Inlet. The 2016 census reported a total population of 29,970 persons living on a land area of 3,778.17 km2 (1,458.76 sq mi).

The Sunshine Coast is typically accessed via boat or plane; no roads connect the district with the rest of the province. From Vancouver, ferries run from Horseshoe Bay to Gibsons across Howe Sound. At the northern end of the peninsula, ferries run from Earl&#x27;s Cove to Saltery Bay.

<doc id="1292967" wikidata="Q3520643" url="?curid=1292967" title="The Distance (Bob Seger album)">
<text>The Distance is the twelfth studio album by US-American rock singer Bob Seger, released in December 1982. It peaked at #5 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album chart and sold close to two million copies in the United States.

Seger, influenced by the Woody Allen film &quot;Annie Hall&quot;, originally intended the album to be built around the theme of relationships but eventually that fell apart when Seger decided that sticking to the theme too strictly would make the album &quot;maudlin&quot;. Several songs based on the original theme made it on the album: the hit single &quot;Even Now&quot;, &quot;Love’s the Last to Know&quot;, &quot;House Behind a House&quot; and the album closer &quot;Little Victories&quot;.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Shame on the Moon&quot;, was one of Seger&#x27;s biggest hits, holding at #2 for four weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It also hit #1 Adult Contemporary and crossed over to #15 Country.

Capitol Records had stopped manufacturing albums in the 8-track tape cartridge format by the time this album was released. However, Seger asked the label to include that format for this album, knowing that many of his fans still used 8-track players.

<doc id="1292974" wikidata="Q7712568" url="?curid=1292974" title="The Adventures of Lano and Woodley">
<text>The Adventures of Lano and Woodley is an Australian comedy television show starring the comedic duo of Lano and Woodley (Colin Lane and Frank Woodley), consisting of two series which aired on ABC TV from 1997 to 1999. The first series was distributed on VHS and in 2004 &quot;The Complete Adventures of Lano and Woodley&quot; was released as a two-disc DVD rather than each series being released separately.

According to Tony Martin, Seasons 3 and 4 of the show were written, but never were produced due to the head of comedy at the ABC at the time saying the show was not topical enough. Martin said that Lane and Woodley wrote six episodes for a third season, and comedy writers such as himself, Matthew Quartermaine and Matt Cameron wrote seven episodes for a fourth season.

==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1997)===
&quot;The Adventures of Lano and Woodley&quot; first screened on the ABC on 1 September 1997, and in the UK it was shown on BBC2 in September 1999. The series was produced by Working Title/Polygram UK, with Marc Gracie as the Australian Producer. The episodes &quot;Starquest&quot; and &quot;The Girlfriend&quot; were directed by Bob Spiers (who also directed &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;), with Jon Olb and Mandy Smith directing 7 and 4 other episodes each, respectively. The series&#x27; music was by Mal Webb (except for &quot;Starquest&quot;, to which Yuri Worontschak contributed).




===Season 2 (1999)===
First screened on The Comedy Network in Canada in March 1999 and then screened on the ABC TV on 15 May 1999. The series&#x27; music was by Mal Webb.

<text>Eclipse Park, also known as Milwaukee Base-Ball Grounds, is a former baseball ground located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. The ground was home to the Milwaukee Grays of the National League during the 1878 season. The first game was played on May 14 and the last on September 14.

The ballpark was on the block bounded by West Clybourn Street, West Michigan Street, North Tenth Street, and North Eleventh Street. Like another baseball stadium which succeeded it in Milwaukee, Borchert Field, the ballpark&#x27;s site now contains Interstate 43, along with the northern quadrant of the Marquette Interchange.

<doc id="1292988" wikidata="Q2384012" url="?curid=1292988" title="Like a Rock">
<text>Like a Rock is the thirteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Seger, released in 1986. The title track is best known for being featured in Chevrolet truck commercials throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.

==Content==
&quot;Fortunate Son&quot; is a live cover of the 1969 Creedence Clearwater Revival hit, recorded March 31, 1983 at Cobo Hall in Detroit. It was originally available only as the B-side of the &quot;American Storm&quot; single, and was added as a bonus track to the CD release of the album. The vinyl version ends with &quot;Somewhere Tonight&quot;. The song &quot;Miami&quot; is featured in an episode of the TV series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. 

Seger said of &quot;The Ring&quot;:

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said of &quot;It&#x27;s You&quot; that &quot;This mid-tempo ballad has a mellow country inflection with the customary Seger rock edge.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;subdued mid-tempo song&quot; that &quot;fairly begs for a country cover.&quot; 

&quot;Cash Box&quot; called &quot;Miami&quot; a &quot;more relaxed, meldodic outing.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;wistful boogie that contemplates the immigrant&#x27;s dilemma.&quot; 

This is the first studio album credited to &quot;Bob Seger &amp; the Silver Bullet Band&quot; that does not feature the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section replacing the Silver Bullet Band on any tracks.

==History==
The album was originally going to be named &quot;American Storm&quot; after the first track and was going to be released in December 1985, but it was delayed and the name was changed.

<doc id="1293050" wikidata="Q7734012" url="?curid=1293050" title="The Fire Inside (Bob Seger album)">
<text>The Fire Inside is the fourteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Seger. The album was released in mid 1991 on the record label, Capitol. It was Seger&#x27;s first album of entirely new music since &quot;Like a Rock&quot; in 1986. Though credited to &quot;The Silver Bullet Band&quot;, much of the album used guest and session musicians, with limited contributions from Silver Bullet Band members. Among the guest artists on the album are Joe Walsh, Bruce Hornsby, Roy Bittan, Steve Lukather, Don Was, Waddy Wachtel, Rick Vito, Mike Campbell, Patty Smyth, Lisa Germano, and Kenny Aronoff.

On release, &quot;The Fire Inside&quot; received a mixed critical reception, but was still a commercial success peaking at number 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, and achieved Platinum status from the RIAA.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing for AllMusic, critic Bret Adams wrote of the album &quot;Overall, the 12-track album is a disappointing piecemeal effort with five different production credits, and Seger uses two Tom Waits covers and one other outside song to pad it.&quot;

==Track listing==

&quot;New Coat of Paint&quot; and &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; were left off the album&#x27;s LP release.

==Personnel==
As listed in the liner notes.

<text>Hamilton Park, also known as Brewster Park and Howard Avenue Grounds, was a sports venue in New Haven, Connecticut, located at the intersection of Whalley Avenue and West Park Avenue.

Hamilton Park hosted Yale University sports competitions in the 19th century. It was the first home field for Yale&#x27;s football team, used from 1870 until Yale Field was acquired in the 1880s.

The park hosted horse races and was home to the New Haven Elm Citys baseball team of the National Association during the 1875 season. It is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the National Association as a major league as well as by those who recognize isolated games, as the Hartford club hosted one game there in 1877.

<doc id="1293054" wikidata="Q4655826" url="?curid=1293054" title="A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving">
<text>A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving is the tenth prime-time animated television special based upon the comic strip &quot;Peanuts,&quot; by Charles M. Schulz. It originally aired on the CBS network on November 20, 1973, and won an Emmy Award the following year. It was the third holiday special after &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; in 1965 and &quot;It&#x27;s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown&quot; in 1966. Except for the opening football gag, it is the first &quot;Peanuts&quot; TV special to have a completely original script without relying on the strip.

==Plot==
In the cold open, Lucy encourages Charlie Brown to try and kick her football to honor the tradition of Thanksgiving football, then as usual pulls the ball away just before Charlie Brown reaches it and tells him that some traditions fade away.

As the Brown siblings prepare to go to their grandmother&#x27;s for Thanksgiving dinner, Charlie Brown gets a phone call from Peppermint Patty, whose father is out of town so she invites herself — and soon after, Marcie and Franklin — to the Browns&#x27; house for Thanksgiving, even though Charlie Brown is not having dinner there nor can he cook anything beyond &quot;maybe toast.&quot; Linus suggests that they prepare a Thanksgiving dinner for their friends before the Browns go to their own family meal and recruits Snoopy and Woodstock to help; Snoopy sets up a ping pong table and chairs outside. Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock and Linus then prepare a feast of toast, pan-fried popcorn, pretzel sticks, jelly beans and sundaes.

After Peppermint Patty, Marcie and Franklin arrive, Linus leads the group in a prayer that details the First Thanksgiving before Snoopy serves the meal. Peppermint Patty, who expected turkey and other traditional Thanksgiving food, angrily yells at Charlie Brown, who leaves the table dejected. Marcie suggests Peppermint Patty was too hard on Charlie Brown and asks whether he invited her or she just invited herself. Peppermint Patty, realizing she was in the wrong, asks Marcie to apologize to Charlie Brown on her behalf (unintentionally paralleling &quot;The Courtship of Miles Standish&quot;). Marcie reluctantly agrees, but Peppermint Patty soon follows and apologizes directly. Realizing that he and Sally are late for the Brown family dinner, Charlie Brown explains the situation over the phone to his grandmother, who invites all his friends to come along for dinner. On the drive over, they sing &quot;Over the River and Through the Wood&quot;, but as they finish the song, Charlie Brown says there&#x27;s one problem with that song: His grandmother lives in a condominium, not a house.

Snoopy and Woodstock go to Snoopy&#x27;s doghouse and cook their own traditional Thanksgiving meal. They break the wishbone, with Woodstock receiving the larger piece. Over the end credits, the two eat pumpkin pie.

==Broadcast history==
The special first aired on CBS on Tuesday, November 20, 1973, two days before Thanksgiving. It placed third in the Nielsen ratings for the week, behind &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;Sanford &amp; Son&quot;.

The special continued to air every year on CBS (skipping 1982, 1983, and 1988) through Nov. 23, 1989.

The Disney Channel and Nickelodeon returned the special for re-airing in the 1990s (in the latter channel&#x27;s case, under the &quot;You&#x27;re on Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown&quot; umbrella of productions) and then, in 2001, it moved, along with the rest of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; specials, to ABC. In contrast to CBS, ABC aired the special every year through 2019, on several days in the week leading up to Thanksgiving, and it regularly won its time slot. As the special runs slightly over a half-hour with commercials, ABC typically filled the remaining portion of the full hour with other &quot;Peanuts&quot; programming. From 2008 to 2019, the remaining time was filled by a slightly abridged edit of &quot;The Mayflower Voyagers,&quot; the premiere episode of the 1988 miniseries &quot;This Is America, Charlie Brown&quot;.

Starting in 2020, the special (along with the rest of the &quot;Peanuts&quot; library) has exclusively aired on Apple TV+; under the terms of the agreement, Apple TV+ must provide a three-day window in November in which the special is available for free. On November 18, 2020 Apple announced they had reached an agreement to air the special on Sunday, November 22, 2020, the Sunday before Thanksgiving, commercial free on PBS and PBS Kids. In accordance with most PBS affiliates&#x27; non-commercial educational licenses, the special was presented on PBS unedited without commercial interruption, with only a brief underwriting spot before and after the special: &quot;This special broadcast of &quot;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving&quot; was made possible by Apple.&quot; Apple renewed the agreement with PBS in 2021 but did not renew it for 2022.

The special is also broadcast in Canada, usually in early October in line with the Canadian observance of Thanksgiving. The special is aired on Family Channel as of 2018, with the special aired on the day before Thanksgiving and on Thanksgiving Day, which takes place on the second Monday of October in Canada.

<doc id="1293063" wikidata="Q1023452" url="?curid=1293063" title="CFB Shilo">
<text>Canadian Forces Base Shilo (CFB Shilo; ) is an operations and training base of the Canadian Armed Forces, located east of Brandon, Manitoba and adjacent to Sprucewoods. During the 1990s, Canadian Forces Base Shilo was also designated as an Area Support Unit, which acts as a local base of operations for south-west Manitoba in times of military and civil emergency.

It is located at the very south-west corner of the Municipality of North Cypress – Langford, and the very northwest corner of the Municipality of Glenboro – South Cypress. Additionally, it lies adjacent to the eastern border of the Rural Municipality of Cornwallis. The base has an 18-hole golf course, which hosts numerous military and civilian golf events.

== History and demographics ==

CFB Shilo has been a training facility for the Canadian Army since 1910, and saw an increase in its use as a training facility following the outbreak of World War I. The base is also home to the Royal Canadian Artillery Museum and many artillery pieces are on display including a cannon used at the North-West Rebellion.

The principal purpose of this base is for training in artillery and munitions, activities audibly recognized, though not begrudged, by generations of nearby residents. In 1942, training of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was transferred here from Fort Benning, Georgia and RAF Ringway in the United Kingdom. The existence of the base has enhanced the economic stability of the surrounding area through contracted employment with the Department of National Defence, and provision of off-base services to staff and trainees. CFB Shilo provides employment for approximately 1,400 military personnel, as well as an additional estimated 450 civilian personnel. The base is located within the federal electoral district of Brandon—Souris.

== Geographic/geological significance ==

The landscape in this area is particularly well suited to these operations. The rolling hills are well suited to hidden target firing drills. Soil compositions of loose sand/gravel aggregates are also ideal for artillery and munitions training. The lack of surface bedrock outcropping greatly reduces the chances of hazardous ricochets during live-fire exercises and also assists in the safe retrieval and secure disposal of both detonated and un-detonated ordnance.

== Units ==
CFB Shilo is the home to the following operational units:

*1st Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery
*2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry

It hosts the following detachments supporting 3rd Canadian Division:

*3rd Canadian Division Training Centre, &quot;C&quot; Company Shilo
*1 Military Police Regiment, detachment Shilo.
*11 CF Health Services Centre
*3rd Canadian Division Support Group Signal Squadron, detachment Shilo

== External connections/partnerships ==
Throughout the years both Regular Forces and Primary Reserve troops have trained at CFB Shilo. Troops from other countries, such as Germany, France, Denmark and the United States, have used the area for training. In particular the German Army Training Establishment Shilo has, from 1974 to 2000, trained in excess of 140,000 troops.

CFB Shilo has also seen use by Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers and employees of the Manitoba Department of Corrections.

==Transportation==
The base is south of the Trans-Canada Highway on PR 340. There were two heliports associated with the base. Shilo Heliport was located on the base while Shilo (Flewin Field) , was located south at |.

== Royal Canadian Artillery Museum ==
The Royal Canadian Artillery Museum is the only museum in the world that explores the history of Canadian gunners who served Canada since 1855. Established in 1962 at CFB Shilo and provides a national portrait of Canadian gunnery. It includes more than 65,000 artifacts, including more than 150 artillery pieces and vehicles.

== Financial information ==
CFB Shilo expends $105 million yearly in salaries and purchases, has 1,350 military people and employs 350 civilians. Having a population of 1,700 people

The Janata Dal (Secular) ({{translation|People&#x27;s Party (Secular)}}; {{small|abbr.}} JD(S)) is an Indian political party recognised as a state party in the Indian states of Karnataka, Kerala and Arunachal Pradesh. It was founded by the former prime minister of India H. D. Deve Gowda in July 1999 as a breakaway faction from the Janata Dal.

==History==
The Janata Dal (Secular), formed in 1999, had its origins in the Janata Party, founded in 1977 as a coalition of several smaller parties that combined forces to oppose the Indian National Congress. In 1988 the Janata Party and other smaller parties merged to form the Janata Dal. In 1996, Janata Dal reached its pinnacle when H. D. Deve Gowda became Prime Minister of India, heading the United Front (UF) coalition government.

The Janata Dal split in 1999, when a faction led by Chief Minister J. H. Patel lent support to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance leading to the formation of Janata Dal (Secular) under H. D. Deve Gowda and Siddaramaiah. The Sharad Yadav faction of the Janata Dal, the Lok Shakti and the Samata Party merged as the Janata Dal (United). Even though the premise for the split was its opposition to allying with the National Democratic Alliance, H. D. Deve Gowda stayed equally away from the Indian National Congress from the outset.

The 2004 Karnataka Assembly election witnessed the revival of the party&#x27;s fortunes with JD(S) becoming part of the ruling coalition in the state.

On 14 April 2015, the JD(S), Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Indian National Lok Dal, Samajwadi Party, and Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya) announced that they would merge into a new national Janata Parivar alliance in order to oppose the BJP, thus leaving the UPA. It has a political presence mainly in Karnataka and is in decline. In September 2023, JD(S) joined the BJP controlled National Democratic Alliance. In Kerala, the party had a small state unit which is part of the state government coalition, the Left Democratic Front. The state unit has refused to be part of the right wing NDA and are in rebellion against their national leadership for having joined hands with the BJP.

<text>Colin Stuart Lane (born 25 March 1965) is an Australian comedian, actor and TV host, best known for being one-half of comedy duo Lano and Woodley.

==Lano and Woodley==
Lane performed with fellow comedian Frank Woodley as part of the duo Lano and Woodley for a period of almost 20 years. The two met through theatresports in the mid-1980s and first performed together at an open mike night at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, Victoria, in 1987 along with their friend Scott Casley, calling themselves the Found Objects.

Over the next six years, the trio performed in venues throughout Australia and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. They became semi-regulars on ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Big Gig&quot;, a show known for boosting the careers of new comedy acts, had their own commercial radio show for six months and were part of the short-lived Seven Network sketch show &quot;The Comedy Sale&quot;. When in 1992 Casley moved away to Alice Springs, Woodley and Lane decided to continue as a duo, drawing their name from childhood nicknames.

As Lano and Woodley, the two adopt humorous onstage personas, with Woodley playing a &quot;goofy innocent&quot; who is frequently bullied by Lane&#x27;s pompous, controlling character. Their first show as a comedy duo, &quot;Fence&quot;, debuted in 1993. It toured throughout Australia, winning the Moosehead Award at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival for best act and was eventually taken the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1994, where it won the prestigious Perrier Comedy Award. Subsequent live productions have included &quot;Curtains&quot;, &quot;Glitzy&quot;, &quot;Slick&quot;, &quot;Bruiser&quot;, &quot;The Island&quot; and their 2006 farewell show, &quot;Goodbye&quot; which won the 2006 Helpmann Award for Best Comedy. In 2000, they co-hosted the televised Melbourne Comedy Gala.

Woodley and Lane have created two television shows together. &quot;The Adventures of Lano and Woodley&quot;, which premiered on the ABC in 1997, was a comedy series which featured the duo living together in a fictional suburban Melbourne flat and frequently getting into trouble. It aired for two seasons, airing in 38 other countries. Although they were offered the opportunity to make the series in England, the pair decided to remain in Australia because they did not want to live in London. In 2004 their live show, &quot;The Island&quot;, was filmed as a TV special and aired on The Comedy Channel. The duo have also released an album, &quot;Lano &amp; Woodley Sing Songs&quot;, and a novel, &quot;Housemeeting&quot;.

In 2006, after close to 20 years of working together, Woodley and Lane decided to part ways. Woodley states the split was due to a desire to pursue new challenges. &quot;We just got to the stage where we felt we had to make a decision,&quot; he says. &quot;Either we were going to spend the next 20 years doing this, this&#x27;d be our career, our lives forever. And that wouldn&#x27;t have been a terrible thing. Or we could go, &#x27;Let&#x27;s have a bit more variety in our lives&#x27;.&quot; In one final tour, the duo travelled through 37 Australian cities with their farewell show, &quot;Goodbye&quot;.

In 2016, Colin reunited with Frank Woodley for a surprise performance as part of the Melbourne Comedy Festival&#x27;s 30th Birthday Bash.

In 2018, the duo reprised their roles as Lano and Woodley for FLY, a show which won the 2018 Melbourne Comedy Festival People&#x27;s Choice Award.

==Solo work==
Since Lano and Woodley&#x27;s farewell tour, Lane has appeared in &quot;Don&#x27;s Party&quot; for the Melbourne Theatre Company, followed by a season with the Sydney Theatre Company. In 2008, he was cast as Pooh-Bah in Essgee Productions&#x27; &quot;The Mikado&quot;.

Lane wrote and performed a solo cabaret show, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Sure About the Music&quot;, about a man who loses the music and finds it again. He performed it in the Melbourne International Comedy Festival in 2009 and again for a limited return season in 2010.

He has made numerous appearances on Australian television, having had guest appearances on &quot;Good News Week&quot;, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, &quot;Welcher &amp; Welcher&quot;, &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot;, &quot;All Star Family Feud&quot; and &quot;Show Me the Movie!&quot;. He has also been a presenter for two Nine Network shows, &quot;Wine Me, Dine Me&quot; and &quot;Kings of Comedy&quot;. His film credits include Jimeoin&#x27;s 2005 movie &quot;The Extra&quot;, in which he played a movie extra, Danny, and the short film &quot;White Lines&quot;.

In 2011, Lane was a fill in host on &quot;The Circle&quot; for both Gorgi Coghlan (early 2011) and Chrissie Swan (late 2011) while they both took maternity leave. Also in 2011, it was announced that Lane would host &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot; replacing Peter Everett from June that year.

In 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2020 Lane appeared as a panellist on the UK comedy show &quot;QI&quot;. He also made an appearance on Channel 7&#x27;s &quot;SlideShow&quot;. In November 2014, he appeared as a late replacement on the inaugural cruise of the Australian performing arts on the along with, among others, Cheryl Barker, David Hobson, Teddy Tahu Rhodes, Simon Tedeschi, Elaine Paige, Marina Prior, and Jonathon Welch. With David Hobson, he appeared since 2016 at various festivals in the show &quot;In Tails – A Comedian and an Opera Singer&#x27;s Worlds Collide&quot; which also toured Australia.

<text>Frank Woodley ( Wood; born 29 February 1968) is an Australian comedian, author and musician who is best known for his work alongside Colin Lane as part of the comedic duo Lano and Woodley. The two first performed together for almost 20 years in live shows, a television series and an album of comedic songs, before deciding to pursue individual careers in 2006. They announced their reformation in November 2017.

==Personal life==
Woodley was born Frank Wood, the youngest of seven children. He grew up in suburban Melbourne, where his family ran a milk bar in Glen Waverley. He adopted the stage name &quot;Frank Woodley&quot;—drawn from a childhood nickname—when he began performing as part of the comedy duo Lano and Woodley in 1993. In 2000 he changed his name by deed poll to avoid confusion.

Woodley is married with a son and daughter and lives in Melbourne&#x27;s inner north.

==Career==

===Lano and Woodley===
Woodley first performed with fellow comedian Colin Lane as part of the duo Lano and Woodley for a period of almost 20 years. The two met through theatresports in the mid-1980s and first performed together at an open mike night at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, Victoria, in 1987 along with their friend Scott Casley, calling themselves the Found Objects. Over the next six years, the trio performed in venues throughout Australia and at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. They became semi-regulars on ABC TV&#x27;s &quot;The Big Gig&quot;, a show known for boosting the careers of new comedy acts. They also had their own commercial radio show for six months and were part of the short-lived Seven Network sketch show &quot;The Comedy Sale&quot;. In 1992, when Casley moved to Alice Springs, Woodley and Lane decided to continue as a duo, drawing their name from childhood nicknames.

As Lano and Woodley, the two adopt humorous onstage personas, with Woodley playing a &quot;goofy innocent&quot; who is frequently bullied by Lane&#x27;s pompous, controlling character. Their first show as a comedy duo, &quot;Fence&quot;, debuted in 1993. It toured throughout Australia, winning the Moosehead Award at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival for best act and was eventually taken to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1994 where it won the Perrier Comedy Award. Subsequent live productions have included &quot;Curtains&quot;, &quot;Glitzy&quot;, &quot;Slick&quot;, &quot;Bruiser&quot;, &quot;The Island&quot; and their 2006 farewell show, &quot;Goodbye&quot;. In 2000, they co-hosted the televised Melbourne Comedy Gala.

Woodley and Lane have created two television shows together. &quot;The Adventures of Lano and Woodley&quot;, which premiered on the ABC in 1997, was a comedy series which featured the duo living together in a fictional suburban Melbourne flat and frequently getting into trouble. It aired for two seasons, becoming the first Australian show to be sold to the BBC and airing in 38 other countries. Although they were offered the opportunity to make the series in England, the pair decided to remain in Australia because they did not want to live in London. In 2004 a live show, &quot;The Island&quot;, was filmed as a TV special and aired on The Comedy Channel. The duo have also released an album, &quot;Lano &amp; Woodley Sing Songs&quot;, and a novel, &quot;Housemeeting&quot;.

In 2006, after close to 20 years of working together, Woodley and Lane decided to part ways. Woodley stated that the split was due to a desire to pursue new challenges. &quot;We just got to the stage where we felt we had to make a decision&quot;, he said. &quot;Either we were going to spend the next 20 years doing this, this&#x27;d be our career, our lives forever. And that wouldn&#x27;t have been a terrible thing. Or we could go, &#x27;Let&#x27;s have a bit more variety in our lives&#x27;.&quot; In one final tour, the duo travelled through 37 Australian cities with their farewell show, &quot;Goodbye&quot;.

In 2018, the duo reprised their roles as Lano and Woodley for a show titled &quot;Fly&quot; which won the 2018 Melbourne Comedy Festival People’s Choice Award.

===Solo work===

Woodley made his solo debut in 2003 at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival with &quot;The Happy Dickwi&quot;, a show about &quot;a whole lot of unrelated ideas&quot;. He has since performed a number of solo stand-up shows, and in 2008 debuted a one-man play entitled &quot;Possessed&quot;. Directed by Kate Denborough and featuring music from Paul Mac, &quot;Possessed&quot; is the story of Louie, a lonely recluse who falls in love with, and becomes possessed by, the ghost of a 19th-century shipwreck victim. Woodley says that the show came out of the desire to do a big solo show and his interest in doing a romantic comedy: &quot;So I was thinking that maybe I could do a solo romantic comedy where I fell in love with myself. Although it was just a stupid joke initially, I started thinking about having a ghost possess me and then I fall in love with the ghost. I have to help free her from the curse she&#x27;s under.&quot; The show has toured both nationally and internationally, and draws inspiration from Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Don Adams, Peter Sellers, Jerry Lewis and Laurel and Hardy.

Woodley played a television vet named &quot;Frank Woodley&quot; in the twelfth episode of the 1998 Australia television series &quot;The Games&quot;.

Woodley has made regular guest appearances on Australian television, including &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, &quot;Good News Week&quot;, &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, &quot;The Sideshow&quot;, &quot;Big Question&quot;, &quot;Rove Live&quot;, &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Comedian&quot; and &quot;Show Me the Movie!&quot;. In 2008, he appeared in a series of television advertisements for Metlink promoting public transport in Melbourne, in particular buses.

In 2007, Woodley performed in the stage show &quot;The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)&quot;, a 97-minute production which encompasses 37 Shakespearian plays.

From 2008 to 2009, Woodley co-hosted a show on The Comedy Channel called &quot;Aussie Gold&quot; every Saturday night.

In 2012, Woodley had a small role in the Australian comedy film &quot;Kath &amp; Kimderella&quot;. In 2015, he co-starred as the dogcatcher in &quot;Oddball&quot;.

Aside from being a comedian, Woodley is also a children&#x27;s author and has written a series of children&#x27;s books called &quot;Kizmet&quot;.
In 2020, Woodley participated in the first Australian season of the Amazon Prime comedy competition series &quot;&quot;, going on to win the grand prize.

In 2022, Woodley was appointed as one of the team captains in &quot;Would I Lie to You? Australia&quot; alongside Chris Taylor.

In 2023, Woodley had a small role as a fertility specialist in the Australian drama comedy Love Me.

==&quot;Woodley&quot;==
A television project entitled &quot;Woodley&quot; screened in 2012. It is a half-hour visual comedy about a largely innocent-seeming man who is caught up in real-world problems. The series follows his attempts to bond with his daughter and his estranged wife (Justine Clarke), though this proves difficult for the accident-prone Woodley, as she tries to move forward with her life with her new partner Greg. The show was announced with a number of other projects in a $1.2 million funding from the Victorian government. The show premiered on Wednesday 22 February at 8.00pm on ABC1. The show is built around an extensive use of visual (often slapstick) humour, rather than dialogue, although this is also used sparingly.

<text>League Park is a former baseball ground located in Toledo, Ohio, US. The ground was home to the Toledo Blue Stockings baseball club of the then-major American Association from May 14, 1884, to September 23, 1884. The club also played minor league games here in 1883 and 1885.

The ballpark was located on a block bounded by Monroe Street (southwest), 15th Street (northwest), Jefferson Avenue (northeast), and 13th Street (southeast), a few blocks northwest of the site of the current Fifth Third Field.

This was the home field in 1884 for Moses Fleetwood Walker, the best-known of the black American major league ballplayers in the 19th century prior to the color line being drawn.

<doc id="1293112" wikidata="Q6091251" url="?curid=1293112" title="It's a Mystery">
<text>It&#x27;s a Mystery is the fifteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Seger, released in 1995 (see 1995 in music). As with his prior album, it is credited to the Silver Bullet Band, though many of the tracks feature a wide array of session musicians and the members of the Silver Bullet Band itself only make limited contributions to the album.

Despite hit singles and fan favorites such as &quot;Lock and Load,&quot; &quot;Manhattan,&quot; and &quot;Hands in the Air,&quot; the album charted at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. This was Seger&#x27;s lowest chart position since 1976&#x27;s &quot;Live Bullet&quot; which charted at No. 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

&quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery&quot; was Seger&#x27;s last album before taking a hiatus from the music industry to be with his family. He would return in 2006 with the album &quot;Face the Promise&quot;.

<text>Mansfield Club Grounds, also known as Mansfield Park and Fort Hill Grounds, was a baseball ballpark located in Middletown, Connecticut. The ballpark was home to the Middletown Mansfields baseball club during the 1872 season, from May 2nd until July 4th. Like the team, it was named after Civil War General Joseph K. Mansfield.

The land for the ballpark, which overlooked Middletown, the Connecticut River, and the Valley Railroad, was donated in 1871 by Dewitt Clinton Sage who owned a nearby brick factory. The former site is now a residential development.

<doc id="1293167" wikidata="Q5142395" url="?curid=1293167" title="Cold Sunday">
<text>&quot;Cold Sunday&quot; was a meteorological event which took place on January 17, 1982, when unprecedentedly cold air swept down from Canada and plunged temperatures across much of the United States far below existing all-time record lows.

The phenomenon was caused by an unusually strong high pressure system over Saskatchewan with a core pressure of 1055mb (31.15 inHg), a level rarely seen outside of permanent polar areas such as Siberia and Antarctica. A recent snowfall had left the ground without any way to hold on to its heat and temperatures dropped precipitously. This mass of cold air was so strong that the temperature at Mequon, Wisconsin, dropped to −40 °F (−40 °C); the previous record was −28 °F (−33 °C) and temperatures below −20 °F (−29 °C) had been felt there only six times in the previous 100 years. The lowest temperature recorded that day in the United States was −52 °F (−47 °C), measured near Tower, Minnesota.

Below is a partial list of cities which set all-time record low temperatures in the United States. This is only a small fraction of all locales setting record low temperatures: Hundreds of towns and cities from North Dakota to New Jersey to Mississippi broke records, and the vast majority of the records set on &quot;Cold Sunday&quot; still stand, as of 2024. The cold was not confined to the night, either. In Princeton, New Jersey, and Cincinnati, Ohio, the daytime high temperatures were 2 °F (−17 °C) and −9 °F (−23 °C). The average high temperature in January is 39 °F (4 °C) in both cities.

<text>Joseph Gordon Coates (3 February 1878 – 27 May 1943) served as the 21st prime minister of New Zealand from 1925 to 1928. He was the third successive Reform prime minister since 1912.

Born in rural Northland, Coates grew up on a farm, which he took charge of at a young age due to his father&#x27;s mental illness, before becoming a member of Parliament in 1911. He maintained a focus on farming issues and stood as an independent candidate. After distinguished service during World War I, he was appointed as Minister of Justice and Postmaster-General in the Reform government of William Massey (1919); he served as Minister of Public Works (1920–26) and Native Affairs (1921–28) and became prime minister in 1925 on Massey&#x27;s death.

Defeated in the elections of 1928, Coates returned to government in 1931 as the key figure in the coalition government of George Forbes. Serving as Minister of Public Works (1931–33) and of Finance (1933–35), he instituted rigorous policies to combat the economic depression of the 1930s. He became a member of Peter Fraser&#x27;s War Administration from 1940, serving as Minister of Armed Forces and War Co-ordination until his death.

==Early life==
Born at Ruatuna, the family home on their sheep and cattle farm at Hukatere in the Matakohe district on the Kaipara Harbour, New Zealand, Coates took on significant responsibility at a relatively early age because his father suffered from bipolar disorder. He received a basic education at a local school, and his well-educated mother also tutored him. He became an accomplished horseman, although an accident left him with a bad leg for the rest of his life. The large Māori population of the area meant that Coates learned to speak some Māori and understood a lot more. Gossip suggests that before his marriage, Coates had two children by a Māori woman. He allegedly became engaged to Eva Ingall, a teacher, but her father forbade marriage on the grounds that the illness of Coates&#x27; father might prove hereditary. Eventually, on 4 August 1914, he married Marguerite Grace Coles, better known as Marjorie Grace Coles, by whom he had five daughters.

== Early political career ==





While farming, Coates became active in farmers&#x27; organisations. He first became involved in politics with the Otamatea County Council, to which he won election in 1905. He served as the Council&#x27;s chairman from 1913 to 1916. He had previously distinguished himself as commander of the Otamatea Mounted Rifle Volunteers, and had a good local reputation. In the 1911 parliamentary election, Coates won the Kaipara seat, having stood as an independent candidate aligned with the Liberal Party. In Parliament he generally voted with the Liberals, and formed part of the group that allowed Joseph Ward to keep his position as prime minister. When Ward resigned and Thomas Mackenzie replaced him, Coates declined the offer of a ministerial position.

Gradually, however, Coates distanced himself from the Liberal Party – primarily because of his strong belief in freehold for farmers, which the Liberals generally opposed. Coates had developed this belief due to his own experience with leasehold on his family&#x27;s farm. When a vote of no confidence took place in 1912, Coates voted against the Liberals, helping the opposition Reform Party come to power. By 1914, Coates had formally joined Reform. He did not, however, act as a particularly partisan member, and made friends with politicians of many different political shades. His political activities focused primarily on improving services for the Far North.

At the outbreak of World War I, Coates attempted to enlist for active service, but the prime minister, William Massey, dissuaded him from doing so by – the Reform Party had only a tenuous majority. In November 1916, however, Coates finally gained permission to join up – he served with considerable distinction, winning a Military Cross and bar. When he returned to New Zealand, many saw him as a hero, and on 2 September 1919 Massey appointed him to Cabinet as Minister of Justice, Postmaster-General, and Minister of Telegraphs. He later became Minister of Public Works and Minister of Railways. He also encouraged publicity for rail travel. From March 1921, Coates served as Minister of Native Affairs, where his knowledge of Māori proved a useful asset. He became a friend of Āpirana Ngata, and worked with him to help address Māori concerns. As Minister of Public Works Coates set up the regulatory framework for generation of electricity and reticulation. Likewise he initiated several major state hydro power schemes such as the Mangahao Power Station in the Tararua Range near Shannon which was officially opened on 3 November 1924.

== Premiership ==

Coates&#x27; prominence gradually increased to the point where people saw him as a natural successor to Massey. When Massey died on 10 May 1925, Sir Francis Bell became caretaker prime minister while the Reform Party could make a decision on it long-term leadership. On 27 May 1925 Coates was elected Reform&#x27;s leader having defeated William Nosworthy in a caucus ballot. The 74 year old Bell resigned to make way for Coates to become prime minister, aged 47, on 30 May.

The leaders of the Liberal Party met with Coates in June 1925 to discuss the &#x27;fusion&#x27; of the two parties to better oppose the Labour Party. Coates had little enthusiasm for the idea, nor did Bell or any other seniors MPs in Reform, and the idea was rejected thinking that Reform would win the election on its own. Coates decided against making any changes to the cabinet before the election. The remainder of the parliamentary session was rather dull and seen as business as usual, rather than anything new in terms of legislation. The biggest talking point was Nosworthy&#x27;s budget which revealed a healthy surplus. It included a reduction to the land tax and lowered the maximum rate of income tax. Also created were child welfare provisions including a children&#x27;s court system, state supervision for support and supervision of delinquent, neglected and illegitimate children by child welfare officers.

The Reform Party&#x27;s campaign organiser, Albert Davy, made Coates and his personality the focus of the 1925 election campaign. Being relatively young and New Zealand born Coates was seen as something of a political novelty which in and of itself garnered public interest. Reform&#x27;s slogans were also about its leader such as &#x27;Coates and confidence&#x27;, &#x27;Coates and certainties&#x27; and &#x27;coats of with Coates&#x27; which were aggressively advertised in newspapers to convey safety and decisiveness. Personally, Coates was not ideologically committed any particular political or economic philosophy more noted for his good sense and pragmatism. Accordingly, when Reform&#x27;s manifesto was released on 2 October was light on detail and mainly discussed broad sentiments. It spoke of Reform promising government stability, economic security, equal opportunities and New Zealand&#x27;s role in imperial defence. Also included were commitments to complete all public works schemes already underway and gradually reduce overseas borrowing. It also famously borrowed the line &quot;more business in government, less government in business&quot; from American president Calvin Coolidge.
Coates drew large crowds during his election campaign, conducting a speaking tour. His speeches were likewise broad on sentiment and light on detail. Most spoke of the need for &#x27;strong and stable government&#x27; with intention to &#x27;govern for all&#x27; while labelling his own views as &#x27;liberal and progressive&#x27;. This last point was discussed as atypical of the Reform Party which was made mostly of social and fiscal conservatives. During the campaign one of Coates&#x27; ministers, Sir James Parr, told a crowd in Auckland Coates was &quot;no Tory ... he came from the people and was for the people; he stood all the time for justice to all sections of the community.&quot; He defended freehold land policy from Labour Party attacks and even promised to introduce a contributary insurance scheme to fund payments for the invalided and unemployed. Reform won a massive victory with 47% of the vote and 55 out of 80 seats.

The sheer scale of his victory would later turn into a difficulty of its own as Coates found it difficult to live up to the high expectations on him. This was seen almost immediately after the election when, contrary to the decisiveness promised in the campaign, Coates dithered as to his cabinet reshuffle. A somewhat sentimental man, he eventually revealed that he would retain most of Massey&#x27;s cabinet with a few new additions which bloated the cabinet to 13 members. The reshuffle was not fully complete until April 1926 when Parr was sent to London as the new High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Coates was losing his reputation for decisiveness. Unsure on how to capitalise on his election win, Coates had created a new Prime Minister&#x27;s Department with his private secretary Frank David Thomson as department head to provide a &#x27;greater measure of efficiency in dealing with official matters&#x27;. Parr&#x27;s departure triggered a by-election in his seat of . The by-election was a disaster for Reform as its vote was split between the official candidate and an independent Reformer, allowing Labour to win the seat. Only five months after Reform&#x27;s landslide general election result, this was a huge election turnaround. Coates seemed unable to impose order on his party, a trait Massey had always been noted for.

He retained the native affairs portfolio throughout his premiership. He set up a royal commission on Māori land confiscations, known as the Sim commission after its chairman Sir William Sim a supreme court judge. The Sim commission looked into historic land confiscations, which was the cause of much bitterness. By mid-1926 serious problems were mounting. Export prices for meat, wool and butter were falling resulting in the country being in a trade deficit. The problem was spreading as lower profits from producers was causing unemployment to rise steadily. Coates&#x27; government came under attack in the house by the opposition, particularly over unemployment. Coates responded by pushing through emergency legislation empowering local authorities to borrow funds to create jobs. This had minimal effect leading the government to contemplate pausing immigration. By August a Family Allowances bill was introduced. It was a means-tested allowance from the Pensions Department for families on incomes of less than £4 a week with more than two children. Men in employment were assumed to be paid enough to support themselves, a wife and two children so no payments were made for the first two children. It was criticised from the left by Labour as being inadequate to the situation, as only 5% of the population were recipients. Rather than raise taxes, £250,000 was appropriated by Parliament. An innovative policy, and without precedence in the western world, it was also criticised from the right as encouraging dependence on the state.

Coates had a temporary reprieve from domestic troubles when he left to lead the New Zealand contingent to attend the 1926 Imperial Conference in London. Though performing well, he disliked the formalities and protocols which he felt left little room for action after talk. Bell accompanied him through much of the conference which established the Balfour Declaration of 1926 which declared New Zealand and the other dominions as autonomous communities within the British Empire with equal in status. Coates and Bell were both against the idea. They were in agreement on defence with Britain and Australia for establishing a naval base at Singapore. Coates pledged that New Zealand would pay £1 million toward the construction. Late in the year Coates visited France and Belgium to visit cemeteries where New Zealand First World War soldiers were buried. He also briefly visited Ireland and while in Dublin was awarded an honorary doctorate. On route back to New Zealand he visited Canada and the United States. He met with Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, US Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg and President Calvin Coolidge mostly discussing matters of the South Pacific. Soon after returning he hosted Prince Albert, Duke of York on his royal tour of New Zealand.

By February 1927 unemployment was still growing. Coates suspended immigration for several months as a reprieve for the problem. Farmers incomes were suffering due to the economic downturn in its British export market. The Dairy Board proposed to fix the price of butter on the British market to try and stabilise farmers&#x27; incomes. The government, recognising market conditions were unable to meet the board&#x27;s demand, was forced to persuade the board to desist in March 1927. Coates was to receive much hostility from the farmers who continued to blame him for their continued financial woes. Rural areas, usually Reform&#x27;s stronghold, were deeply dissatisfied with the government and had the opportunity to make their dissatisfaction known at the Raglan by-election in September 1927. Reform was embarrassed for the second time that term in losing a normally safe seat to Labour. Vote splitting was again rife with many farmers, who normally voted Reform, having a Liberal, Country Party and independent Reformer to vote for. Labour&#x27;s successful candidate won mostly with votes from local coal miners. Even Reform friendly papers acknowledged popularity for Coates and his government had collapsed since 1925, though he still was able to attract crowds when he visited the electorate during the campaign.

Coates premiership was marked by an intention to develop the rural economy of New Zealand, from which he stemmed, particularly in terms of roads and transport infrastructure. To this goal, he dedicated a number of projects, such as the construction of the Kopu Bridge in the Coromandel Peninsula, which gave the local farmers better road access, and approving the construction of a Rotorua-Taupo railway which had long been sought after by settlers living between Rotorua and Taupo to open up the district. He also supported public works schemes as they offered jobs for unemployment releif.

As the Great Depression loomed and New Zealand&#x27;s economy began to further deteriorate, Coates and the Reform Party attracted considerable criticism. Promised legislation had to be shelved such as the contributary insurance scheme promised at the 1925 election and in late-1928 it was dropped altogether. By 1927 Davy had fallen out with Coates and had left Reform and created the new United Party mostly out of the remainder of the Liberal Party with funds from disaffected former Reform donors. At the 1928 general election Reform and United Party won an almost equal number of parliamentary seats. When parliament met a vote of no confidence was called. Both United and Labour voted against the government, as did four independent MPs and the sole Country Party member, which saw Coates&#x27; government defeated 50 votes to 28. As a result Coates lost the premiership.

== Opposition ==
With the formation of the United government Coates became Leader of the Opposition. When United put forward their proposed Unemployment Act of 1930 to deal with the still growing numbers of unemployed Labour refused to support it. It required men to register as unemployed, but insisted on the principle of no pay without work, requiring men to labour in work schemes of dubious value receiving pay from an unemployment board. Without Labour&#x27;s votes the bill could not be passed but Coates pledged Reform&#x27;s support to allow it to pass. Coates though the government was largely incompetent and were risking social cohesion with its austerity. He sensed a political opportunity to let United take the blame for the depression while leaving his own party comparatively clean. However the Reform Party conference in 1931 advised further co-operation with United. Against his better judgement Coates was persuaded to do so.

== Coalition ==
In 1931, the Labour Party completely withdrew its support from the United government, protesting about various economic measures which it regarded as hostile to workers. Coates and the Reform Party subsequently agreed to form a coalition with United, preventing a general election in which Labour might have made significant gains. United&#x27;s leader, George Forbes, remained prime minister, but Coates and his Reform Party colleagues gained a number of significant posts. William Downie Stewart Jr, Coates&#x27; colleague, became Minister of Finance.

In the 1931 general election the United-Reform Coalition retained power, although Labour increased its share of the vote. Economic problems persisted, however, and unemployment continued to rise. Coates quarrelled with William Downie Stewart Jr over the government&#x27;s response, and Coates himself became Minister of Finance. The Prime Minister, George Forbes, became increasingly apathetic and disillusioned, and increasingly Coates ran the government. Talk persisted about the emotional state of Coates. As finance minister he devalued the New Zealand currency and established the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1934.

In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.

In the 1935 general election the coalition suffered a major defeat, winning only 19 seats: Coates nearly lost Kaipara. The Labour Party, which had won 53 seats, formed its first government and Michael Joseph Savage became prime minister.

== Later political career ==
After the defeat of the coalition government, Coates withdrew from public attention to a large extent. He experienced a period of financial difficulty resulting from the sudden loss of income, but his situation improved when a group of friends presented him with a large sum of £550 as thanks for his long service.

When United and Reform merged to establish the National Party in May 1936, Coates sat as a National MP. Some of his supporters urged him to seek the party&#x27;s leadership, but others within the party believed that both Coates and Forbes remained too closely associated with the country&#x27;s economic problems, and that the new party needed fresh faces. Forbes supported Charles Wilkinson for the leadership, but Coates and his supporters rejected this choice, going so far as to threaten a re-establishment of the Reform Party if it went through. Eventually Coates preferred choice Adam Hamilton, a former Reform member, won the leadership ballot by one vote. Coates was a loyal supporter of Hamilton, who retained him on the frontbench as finance spokesperson. In the house Coates was critical of Labour&#x27;s finance minister Walter Nash, arguing the government&#x27;s new regulations would restrict competition, inflate costs and slow economic growth. At the same time he did concede that on reflection that the coalition government&#x27;s austerity had gone too far and caused unnecessary hardship. Coates deputised at times for Hamilton including in August 1940 when, while Hamilton was ill, Coates was acting Leader of the Opposition when war was imminent with Germany. He ceased all politicking by National and advocated for co-operation with the government for the sake of national defence.

With the outbreak of World War II, the Labour government invited both Coates and Hamilton to join a special War Cabinet, which would be responsible for matters related to the war&#x27;s prosecution. Their acceptance created a rift between them and their National colleagues – the party replaced Hamilton as leader over the issue, and relations between Coates and the new leader, Sidney Holland, deteriorated. Coates strongly believed partisanship was a misplaced approach during war, and attempted to convince both Labour and National to work together. He expressed pleasure when the two parties established a joint War Administration, with the War Cabinet serving as its executive body. The War Administration quickly collapsed, with the National members choosing to resign. Coates and Hamilton openly criticised this decision, and the day after their resignation became effective, they rejoined the War Cabinet on the invitation of the prime Minister, Peter Fraser. Coates thus became an Independent, and he decided that he would contest the next election as an independent National candidate, not as the National Party&#x27;s officially-nominated candidate. In the face of British decline during the war, Coates encouraged Fraser to develop closer strategic relationships with the United States instead.

== Death ==
Coates&#x27; health, however, had begun to fail. He had smoked heavily for most of his life, and had also developed heart trouble. On 27 May 1943 he collapsed and died in his office in Wellington. The Labour Party eulogised him more strongly than did his National Party colleagues, although politicians from all sides of the House paid tribute to him.

== Legacy ==
Coates&#x27; style lived on through his mentee Keith Holyoake, later prime minister himself (1957; 1960–72), who saw Coates as his political role model. Both held each other in mutual admiration and respect and held shared views on opposition to socialism and state control while supporting individual freedom and private enterprise. Coates forayed into social welfare policy and centralised agricultural marketing which made enemies on the right in the 1920s and oversaw financial austerity which made him unpopular with the left in the 1930s. Historian Jim McAloon labelled Coates&#x27; policies as that of a pragmatic centrist.

Coatesville a small town in Auckland north of Albany was called Fernielea until 1926, when it was renamed after Coates.

<text>Théoneste Bagosora (16 August 1941 – 25 September 2021) was a Rwandan military officer. He was chiefly known for his key role in the 1994 Rwandan genocide for which he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). In 2011, the sentence was reduced to 35 years&#x27; imprisonment on appeal. He was due to be imprisoned until he was 89. According to René Lemarchand, Bagosora was &quot;the chief organizer of the killings&quot;. On 25 September 2021, he died in a prison hospital in Mali, where he was being treated for heart issues.

==Early life and career==
Bagosora was born in Giciye in what is now Nyabihu District, Western Province, Rwanda. In 1964 he graduated from the &quot;École des officiers&quot; (Officers&#x27; School) in Kigali with the rank of second lieutenant. In 1982, he graduated with a commendation from the Institut des hautes études de défense nationale in France. During his military career, he served as second-in-command of the &quot;École supérieure militaire&quot; (Superior Military School) in Kigali and as commander of Kanombe military camp.

On 29 April 1970, he was promoted to the rank of captain. He became a full colonel in October 1989. He was appointed to the position of &quot;directeur du cabinet&quot; (chief of staff) in the Ministry of Defence in June 1992. Despite officially retiring from the military on 23 September 1993, he retained this post until fleeing the country in July 1994.

==Role in the genocide==
Bagosora was born in the same northern region as Juvénal Habyarimana, the president of Rwanda from 1973 to 1994. He was linked to &quot;le Clan de Madame&quot;, known later as the &quot;akazu&quot;, a group associated with Agathe Habyarimana, the president&#x27;s wife, who was at the nexus of the Hutu Power ideology.

Although he was present at the negotiations of the Arusha Accords in August 1993, he never supported them. He is widely cited as saying, in the context of the Arusha Accords, that he was returning to Rwanda to &quot;prepare for the apocalypse&quot;, but that is apocryphal. Luc Marchal, a Belgian officer, who served as Kigali sector commander in UNAMIR, reported that Bagosora told him that the only way to solve Rwanda&#x27;s problems was to get rid of the Tutsi.

Bagosora was responsible for establishing paramilitary &quot;self-defense&quot; units, the Interahamwe, that would operate in every commune in the country. These groups were to act in concert with the local police, militias, and military authorities. Bagosora was also responsible for distributing arms and machetes throughout Rwanda. Between January 1993 and March 1994, Rwanda imported more than 500,000 machetes, twice the number imported in previous years.

At about 8:15 pm on the evening of 6 April 1994, President Habyarimana was flying back to Kigali after a meeting when his plane was struck by two missiles fired from the ground. The plane crashed, killing everyone on board. The position of the American and Rwandan governments is that the missiles were fired from the Kanombe barracks, which were controlled by the Presidential Guard, but that conclusion is disputed. News of the President&#x27;s death was broadcast and the killings began.

After the assassination, Colonel Bagosora along with Colonel Rwagafilita gathered supporters and convened a meeting of a Crisis Committee. Roméo Dallaire, the UN commander was invited, and arrived to find the senior leadership of the Rwandan army. Dallaire rejected Bagosora&#x27;s proposal of having the military take control of the political situation until they could hand it over to the politicians and he reminded him that Rwanda still had a government headed by Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. Bagosora responded that she was incapable of governing the nation. A few hours later, Madame Agathe was murdered with her husband by members of the Presidential Guard and the army. After Bagosora&#x27;s failed attempt to have the military take over the role of government, the group proceeded to pick a provisional government. The interim government was a multiparty group, but all came from the hardliner sections of their respective parties.

Massacres began all over the country. Many prominent Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed right away, their names and addresses having been on lists. Radio Mille Collines broadcast incitements to murder. Trucks began arriving to pick up scores of bodies. On the morning of 7 April, ten Belgian peacekeepers who had been guarding Prime Minister Agathe and who were witnesses to the government troops laying siege to her residence were disarmed and taken to Camp Kigali, approximately 200 metres from where Colonel Bagosora was holding a meeting of military officers. The peacekeepers were murdered over the course of several hours by military personnel. During his testimony, Colonel Bagosora admitted attending to the scene while the murders were in progress, although claiming he could do nothing to stop the killings. As anticipated, the death of the ten Belgian peacekeepers prompted the withdrawal of most peacekeeping troops from Rwanda, effectively clearing the way for slaughter.

Over the next 100 days, people were being killed at an astonishing rate. The number of dead in the genocide varies from 500,000 to more than 1,000,000 people, depending on the source.

Upon the interference of Tutsi army in response to the genocide, Bagosora fled into neighbouring Zaire. &quot;Fed and protected in refugee camps supported by millions of dollars in international aid, the Hutu Power leaders were able to hold regular planning meetings and to recruit new members.&quot; With Bagosora actively involved, they rebuilt their military structures with the purpose of wiping out the Tutsi population.

===ICTR trial===
Bagosora later moved to Cameroon with several other Hutu Power leaders. It was there that he was detained with André Ntagerura in 1996. In 1997, he first appeared before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in Arusha, Tanzania, to face thirteen counts of eleven different international crimes, based on the laws of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The joint trial with three other senior military officers charged as co-conspirators opened on 2 April 2002.

During his trial further evidence was submitted that in 1991 he and other co-accused helped to draft a document where they referred to the Tutsi ethnic group as the &quot;principal enemy&quot; which was widely distributed in the army. They were also accused of supporting the media outlets responsible for spreading hate messages and making lists of victims. The trial wrapped up on 1 June 2007, after five years, with Colonel Théoneste Bagosora still maintaining his innocence.

On 18 December 2008, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda found Bagosora and two other senior Rwandan army officers, Major Aloys Ntabakuze and Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva, guilty of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In ruling that life imprisonment was the appropriate sentence for Bagosora the three trial judges concurred that &quot;The toll of human suffering was immense as a result of crimes which could have only occurred with his orders and authorisation.&quot; The tribunal court stated that Bagosora had been &quot;the highest authority in the Rwandan Defense Ministry, with authority over the military&quot; in the aftermath of the assassination of President Habyarimana. The court ruled that Bagosora was responsible for the murders of Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the ten Belgian peacekeepers who had been guarding the Prime Minister at Camp Kigali, the president of the Constitutional Court Joseph Kavaruganda, and three major opposition leaders, Faustin Rucogoza, Frederic Nzamurambaho, and Landoald Ndasingwa. In addition, the court found Bagosora guilty of orchestrating the mass killings of Tutsis in Kigali and Gisenyi. However, the trial court held there was a reasonable doubt that events prior to 6 April could only be explained by Bagosora conspiring with others, so he was therefore acquitted on a charge of conspiracy to commit genocide prior to 7 April 1994.

In the end result at trial, Bagosora was convicted of 10 counts of eight different crimes, including genocide, two counts of murder (one for Rwandans and one for peacekeepers), Extermination, Rape, Persecution, Other Inhumane Acts, two counts of Violence to Life (one for Rwandans and one for peacekeepers) as well as Outrages Upon Personal Dignity. He was serving his sentence in the Koulikoro prison in Mali. On 1 April 2021, his request for parole was denied. Bagosora died five months later.

==In popular culture==
In the 2005 film by HBO &quot;Sometimes in April&quot;, a historical drama about the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, Bagosora is portrayed by Abby Mukiibi Nkaaga.

In the 2007 film &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;, a dramatisation of Canadian military officer Roméo Dallaire&#x27;s book about his time as commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda, Bagosora is portrayed by Burundian actor Michel-Ange Nzojibwami.

<text>A royal guard or the palace guard, is a group of military bodyguards, soldiers or armed retainers responsible for the protection of a royal family member, such as a king or queen, or prince or princess. They often are an elite unit of the regular armed forces, or are designated as such, and may maintain special rights or privileges.

==Institution and tasks==

Royal guards have historically comprised both purely ceremonial units serving in close proximity to the monarch, as well as regiments from all arms, forming a designated substantial elite and intended for active service as part of the army. An example of the first category would include the &quot;Tropas de la Casa Real&quot; of the Spanish monarchy prior to 1930, comprising halberderos and a mounted escort. Examples of the second would include the Imperial Guards of the Russian and German Empires prior to 1917–18.

Monarchs frequently modelled their royal guards upon those of fellow rulers. Thus, Napoleon I&#x27;s &quot;Garde Imperiale&quot; was imitated by his opponent Alexander I of Russia, his Bourbon successor Louis XVIII, and his nephew Napoleon III. The modern &quot;Garderegiment Grenadiers en Jagers&quot; regiment of the Netherlands and the &quot;Escorte Royale&quot; of Belgium retain features of uniform and other distinctions that can be traced back to Napoleonic influences.

==Political importance==
Because of their location, status, role and nature, royal guards have frequently been able to play a political role beyond their intended military and social ones. In times of revolution, the continued loyalty or defection of such units has often played a key part in the outcome of wider unrest. Historical examples were England in 1688, Spain in 1808, Sweden in 1809, France in 1789 and again in 1814-15, Russia in 1917 and Persia in 1906 and again in 1953.

<text>A telesync (TS) is a bootleg recording of a film recorded in a movie theater, often (although not always) filmed using a professional camera on a tripod in the projection booth. The audio of a TS is captured with a direct connection to the sound source (often an FM microbroadcast provided for the hearing-impaired, or from a drive-in theater). If a direct connection from the sound source is not possible, sometimes the bootlegger will tape or conceal wireless microphones close to the speakers, as it is better than a mic on the camera. A TS can be considered a higher quality type of cam, that has the potential of better-quality audio and video. 

The true definition of telesync would include the film being synchronized to the camera&#x27;s own frame rate and shutter timing as done by television companies when preparing celluloid film for broadcast. A bootleg TS rarely, if ever, uses this form of synchronization which can lead to additional temporal aliasing. Most cameras used to make modern telesyncs run at 24 frames per second, like the movie projectors, to reduce artifacts compared to the 60 frames per second cameras of old.

As technology gets better, the quality of telesyncs also improves, although even the best telesyncs are lossy and will be inferior in quality to direct rips from Blu-ray, DVD or digital transfers from the film itself (see telecine). Some release groups use high-definition video cameras to get the clearest picture possible. When an unlicensed copy of a film exists even before its official publication, it is often because a telesync version could be easily produced.

In the German warez scene additional tags for the audio source can be added to a telesync release. These are LD (line dubbed) for when the audio track of an unlicensed copy has been ripped from the line out connection of a projector or MD (mic dubbed) when a microphone is used for the recording. These tags are not used exclusively on cam releases though.

<doc id="1293194" wikidata="Q2298766" url="?curid=1293194" title="Allister">
<text>Allister is an American pop-punk band from Chicago, Illinois. The four-piece formed in 1994 as Phineas Gage when the original band members were still in high school. In 1998, Allister became one of the first bands to sign to Drive-Thru Records. They went on hiatus in 2007, then reunited in 2010, and have been touring and recording again since. They have released six studio albums: &quot;Dead Ends and Girlfriends&quot; (1999), &quot;Last Stop Suburbia&quot; (2002), &quot;Before the Blackout&quot; (2005), &quot;Countdown to Nowhere&quot; (2010), &quot;Life Behind Machines&quot; (2012), and &quot;20 Years and Counting&quot; (2019). The band also made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film &quot;Sleepover&quot;.

==History==

===Commercial success (2002–2007)===
With the aid of producer Chris Fudurich, the band recorded their second full-length album &quot;Last Stop Suburbia&quot; in 2002, showcasing a certain degree of growth in the songwriting of Rogner and Murphy. The album featured several fan-favorites, such as &quot;Radio Player&quot;, &quot;Overrated&quot;, and &quot;Somewhere on Fullerton&quot; (an ode to the legendary Chicago punk venue, Fireside Bowl), though the band had to part ways with both Rossi and Chris Rogner, who would concentrate on his own band August Premier. The following year, the band added Kyle Lewis (guitar) – formerly of Showoff, Now She&#x27;s Gone, and The Fold – and Mike Leverence (drums), formerly of PARR5. &quot;Last Stop Suburbia&quot; reached No. 9 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart.
The song &quot;Somewhere on Fullerton&quot; was featured in Disney&#x27;s Extreme Skate Adventure.

In 2004, Allister toured the world (including Europe and Japan) and scored a small guest appearance on the big screen in the film &quot;Sleepover&quot;, before releasing their third album &quot;Before The Blackout&quot; (2005) and supporting it by co-headlining the &quot;Before the Blackout, after the Breakup Tour&quot; with Fenix*TX.

In 2006, the group was invited to a two and a half-month tour of Japan with Japanese band Ellegarden, with whom they had become friends while playing together at the SXSW music festival in Austin, Texas. The tour consisted of 40 sold-out shows all over Japan. At this time, the group released a cover EP titled &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;, on which Murphy sang half of the songs in Japanese. Before the departure, Rogner learned that he was becoming a father and made the decision to take a job where he was more available to his family. As such, Allister decided to go on hiatus following one final Japanese tour that the band had already committed to in the spring of 2007 – for which former Allister member Chris Rogner took his brother&#x27;s place – and a final farewell show in Chicago at The Metro on 20 July 2007, at which Tim Rogner returned to perform. Former member John &quot;Johnny&quot; Hamada returned to sing backing vocals on the final song, &quot;Somewhere on Fullerton&quot;, as well as other members of support bands Punchline and The Fold.

===Breakup and side projects (2007–2010)===
Soon after, Murphy and Lewis went on to start the band The Get Go with friends and former members of bands Home Grown and Mest. The Get Go released 2 records and toured the UK and Japan, but due to conflicting schedules has since ceased activity.

In 2008, Scott Murphy signed as a solo artist to the label Universal Music in Japan, recording his debut solo album, &quot;Guilty Pleasures II&quot;, as a continuation of the band&#x27;s past work. The album contains a number of Japanese and English songs.
On the album&#x27;s release date, &quot;Scott Murphy&quot; was the number 1 searched word on Google in Japan. Murphy released another follow-up EP, &quot;Guilty Pleasures 3&quot;, on 3 December 2008. &quot;Guilty Pleasures 3&quot; was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipment of 100,000 copies on 10 September 2009 and &quot;Guilty Pleasures II&quot; was also certified Gold by RIAJ on 10 December 2009. Throughout the following years, he released several more albums in the &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; series, including: &quot;Guilty Pleasures Love&quot;, &quot;Guilty Pleasures 4&quot;, &quot;Guilty Pleasures Animation&quot;, &quot;Guilty Pleasures Christmas&quot; and &quot;Guilty Pleasures Thriller&quot;, a track for track rock cover of the Michael Jackson album &quot;Thriller&quot;.

In 2010, Murphy began working on a project with alternative rock band Weezer&#x27;s frontman Rivers Cuomo entitled Scott &amp; Rivers. The pair met in Los Angeles in 2010, and soon began writing and recording an album of original songs sung in Japanese. They share lead vocal duties and play guitar in the group. They played their first show at the Countdown Japan Festival in Chiba on 31 December 2012, as the first non-Japanese act to perform at the 10-year-old festival. They released a full-length album, &quot;Scott &amp; Rivers&quot;, in 2013.

In 2012, Rogner recorded and released a solo acoustic EP entitled &quot;The Ravenswood Sessions.&quot;

===Reunion and recent events (2010–present)===
Allister announced their intention to reunite in the spring of 2010, and the band broke their hiatus at the Bamboozle Festival in Chicago on 2010 May 15 at the Charter One Pavilion. They recorded and released their 4th full-length album &quot;Countdown to Nowhere&quot; on Universal Music Japan on 16 July 2010. In 2012, Allister recorded and released their 5th full-length album entitled &quot;Life Behind Machines&quot;, and promoted its release with a tour of Japan and their first ever tour of China. In 2014, Allister toured the United States playing dates with MxPx and Showoff. Former Allister members Chris Rogner and Eric &quot;Skippy&quot; Mueller have both been playing in new bands, Rogner in Hey Einstein and Mueller in We&#x27;ve Got Ours.

On 19 December 2018, Tim Rogner announced that the band would release a new record to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do that on Vinyl&quot;. The record, called &quot;20 Years and Counting&quot;, is a &quot;20 song compilation that features songs from previous records as well as four brand new tracks.&quot; Since Allister did not own the recording licenses for songs on its first three records, but owned the rights to the songs themselves, the band re-recorded and &quot;re-imagined&quot; some of them. A video for the re-recording of &quot;Somewhere on Fullerton&quot; was released on YouTube the same day as Rogner&#x27;s announcement. The new record was officially released through Universal Japan on 30 January 2019, available digitally via iTunes and Google Play.

<doc id="1293253" wikidata="Q3360322" url="?curid=1293253" title="Al Hidd">
<text>:&quot;To be distinguished from Ras al Hadd (رأس الحد), a district with a famous turtle breeding beach in Oman&quot;
Al Hidd (; transliterated: Al-Ḥidd) is a town in Bahrain, located on a sand spit on the southeastern extremity of Muharraq Island. The town, which has a large native Sunni population, is well known for its rich sea crabs as well as its clear blue seas. Before the discovery of oil in Bahrain, the inhabitants of Hidd were largely involved in the fishing or pearl diving industries. Many of Bahrain&#x27;s fijiri performance groups are based in Hidd.

Al Hidd is considered a very religiously and culturally conservative area of Bahrain, with many of the town&#x27;s &quot;firjan&quot;, or neighborhoods, being composed of old buildings. 

==Geography==

Al Hidd lies south of the Bahrain International Airport and the town of Arad. Situated close by is East Hidd City, a large public housing project under construction. The Shaikh Khalifa Causeway connects Hidd to Juffair on Bahrain Island. The altitude of Al Hidd is 3m.

==Government and infrastructure==
Hidd used to be administered under its own municipality, but today it falls under the Muharraq Governorate. 

To the south of Hidd lies the Hidd Industrial Area, built on newly reclaimed land. In addition to several factories, the Industrial Area is the site of a large power plant, a water desalination plant (which supplies 75% of Bahrain&#x27;s clean water requirements), and a drydock (Arab Shipbuilding and Repair Yard or ASRY). The Office of Ports and Maritime Affairs of the Ministry of Transportation has its headquarters in Building 702 in Hidd.

==Education==
The Ministry of Education operates public government schools. Government schools for boys include Al-Hidd Primary Intermediate Boys School and South Hidd Primary Boys School. Government schools for girls include Asma That Al-Nequin Primary Intermediate Girls School and Al-Hadd Secondary Girls School.

<doc id="1293263" wikidata="Q3017515" url="?curid=1293263" title="David Blake (general)">
<text>Major General David Valentine Jardine Blake (10 November 1887 – 6 March 1965) was a senior commander of the Australian Army who served in both world wars.

==Early life==
David Blake was born on 10 November 1887 in Parramatta, New South Wales. He was educated at Marist Brothers, Parramatta.

==First World War==

Blake was commissioned as a career officer in the Australian Army&#x27;s Permanent Military Forces in 1911. In September 1916, as a major, he became the first commanding officer of the newly formed No. 3 Squadron Australian Flying Corps (then part of the army). The squadron was deployed to Belgium and France in late 1917, performing a combined reconnaissance and offensive role.

From early 1918, No. 3 Squadron flew in a sector of the Somme Valley, facing German planes commanded by the &quot;Red Baron&quot;, Manfred von Richthofen. When the baron was shot down and killed behind allied lines on 21 April 1918, the disposal of his remains became Blake&#x27;s responsibility. Blake initially reported that a 3 Sqn R.E.8 may have shot down Richthofen. However, following an autopsy, Blake became a strong proponent of the view that ground-based Australian machine-gunners had killed the baron. Blake remained 3 Sqn CO until October 1918. The following year, he was transferred to Australia.

==Second World War==
After the outbreak of the Second World War, Blake&#x27;s first significant command (as a major general) was Officer Commanding, 7th Military District (the Northern Territory), based in Darwin, from September 1941. The post gained in importance when war with Japan broke out in December. In January 1942, Blake&#x27;s position was incorporated into the short-lived American-British-Dutch-Australian Command.

Blake was the senior Allied officer present during the first air raids on Darwin on 19 February 1942. In the wake of the initial Japanese raids—and fearing a surface attack—Blake decided to remove all Allied forces from central Darwin and other coastal areas. He was later criticised for this decision, as withdrawing from a major supply node was considered a cardinal error in military theory. Later that year, as a major Allied build-up in northern Australia got underway, Blake was moved to the position of General Officer Commanding, Lines of Communication, Northern Territory Area.

Blake retired from the army in 1947.

<doc id="1293289" wikidata="Q535446" url="?curid=1293289" title="It's the economy, stupid">
<text>&quot;It&#x27;s the economy, stupid&quot; is a catchphrase that means that the primary concern of American voters is the state of the U.S. economy, and how the economy affects their personal finances.

The phrase was coined by James Carville in 1992 as &quot;The economy, stupid&quot;. It is often quoted from a televised quip by Carville as &quot;It&#x27;s the economy, stupid&quot;. Carville was a strategist in Bill Clinton&#x27;s successful campaign in the 1992 U.S. presidential election against incumbent George H. W. Bush. His phrase was directed at the campaign&#x27;s workers and intended as one of three messages for them to focus on. The others were &quot;Change vs. more of the same&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t forget health care&quot;.

Clinton&#x27;s campaign advantageously used the then-prevailing recession in the United States as one of the campaign&#x27;s means to successfully unseat George H. W. Bush. In March 1991, days after the ground war in Kuwait, 90% of polled Americans approved of President Bush&#x27;s job performance. During the following year, Americans&#x27; opinions turned sharply; 64% of polled Americans disapproved of Bush&#x27;s job performance in August 1992.

==History==
In order to keep the campaign on message, Carville hung a sign in Bill Clinton&#x27;s Little Rock campaign headquarters that read:

#Change vs. more of the same.
#The economy, stupid.
#Don&#x27;t forget health care.

Although the sign was intended for an internal audience of campaign workers, the second phrase became a &quot;de facto&quot; slogan for the Clinton election campaign.

==Legacy==
The phrase has become a snowclone repeated often in American political culture, usually starting with the word &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; and with commentators sometimes using a different word in place of &quot;economy&quot;. Examples include &quot;It&#x27;s the deficit, stupid!&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s the corporation, stupid!&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s the math, stupid!&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s the voters, stupid!&quot; Judge Mark E. Walker wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s the First Amendment, stupid&quot;, in a decision regarding a case between Florida Department of Health officials and the pro-abortion group Floridians Protecting Freedom after the department filed cease-and-desist letters against television stations that aired an advertisement produced by the group.

<text>Isa Town (, &quot;Madīnat ʿĪsā&quot;) is a middle class town located in Bahrain, in the north central part of the country.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Isa&quot; refers to Isa ibn Salman Al Khalifah, a former ruler of Bahrain, from 1961 to 1999.

==History==
Isa Town largely comprises affluent newly constructed villas, and is home to many members of Bahrain&#x27;s educated middle class. In 2002&#x27;s election it was one of the few areas of Bahrain not to be entirely represented by an Islamist or right-wing MP, with Abdnabi Salman of the formerly communist Democratic Bloc winning the seat. In 2006&#x27;s election, ex-Harvard academic Dr Munira Fakhro of Wa&#x27;ad lost in controversial circumstances to Sunni Islamist Dr Salah Ali of Al-Menbar Islamic Society.

It was one of the twelve municipalities of Bahrain after being split off of the municipality of al Mintaqah al Wusta in 1988, then became part of the Central Governorate till September 2014 when it became part of Capital Governorate.

=== Pakistan School, Bahrain ===
Pakistan School, Bahrain (PSB; ) is a Pakistan International School located in Isa Town, Bahrain. The school was founded in July 1968 by a group of overseas Pakistanis. Originally the school was housed at a rented building in Manama with 100 students. With a gradual increase in enrollment, the need to construct a school building was deemed necessary, to provide all modern educational facilities. At the request of the managing committee of the school, the Kingdom of Bahrain leased land in Isa Town for the construction of the school. The Minister of Education Ali M. Fakhro, laid the foundation stone of the school on 10 January 1983 while H.E Salman, Crown Prince of Bahrain performed the inauguration of the building on 23 March 1985. The building was again expanded and on 25 September 1993, Jinnah Block was inaugurated. On 5 June 1995, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan inaugurated Sir Syed Block.

===Isa Town Market inferno===
On 15 July 2012, the Isa Town marketplace caught fire, damaging more than 450 shops and causing damages amounting to hundreds of thousands of dinars. It took dozens of firefighters and around 30 fire engines more than five hours to control the blaze. There were no reported casualties although two firemen were hospitalized due to smoke inhalation. It was estimated that two-thirds of the market was destroyed.

Bahrain&#x27;s Prime Minister, Khalifa bin Salman al-Khalifa, ordered a probe to be set up to investigate the incident.

<doc id="1293302" wikidata="Q433291" url="?curid=1293302" title="Ellen Kushner">
<text>Ellen Kushner (born October 6, 1955) is an American writer of fantasy novels. From 1996 until 2010, she was the host of the radio program &quot;Sound &amp; Spirit&quot;, produced by WGBH in Boston and distributed by Public Radio International.

== Background and personal life ==
Kushner was born in a Jewish family in Washington, D.C. and grew up in Cleveland, Ohio. She attended Bryn Mawr College and graduated from Barnard College. She lives in New York City with her wife and sometime collaborator, Delia Sherman. They held a wedding in 1996 and were legally married in Boston in 2004. Kushner identifies as bisexual.

== Career ==
Kushner&#x27;s first books were five &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; gamebooks. During that period, she published her first novel, &quot;Swordspoint&quot;, in 1987. A sequel set 18 years after &quot;Swordspoint&quot;, called &quot;The Privilege of the Sword&quot;, was published in July 2006, with a first hardcover edition published in late August 2006 by Small Beer Press. &quot;The Fall of the Kings&quot; (2002) (co-authored by Sherman) is set 40 years after &quot;Swordspoint.&quot; All three books are considered mannerpunk novels, and take place in a nameless imaginary capital city and its raffish district of Riverside, where swordsmen-for-hire ply their trade.

From 2011 to 2014 audiobook versions of all three novels were produced under the label of Neil Gaiman Presents. The &quot;Swordspoint&quot; adaptation won the 2013 Audie Award for Best Audio Drama, an Earphones Award from &quot;AudioFile&quot;, and the 2013 Communicator Award: Gold Award of Excellence (Audio). The adaptation of &quot;The Fall of the Kings&quot; won the 2014 Wilbur Award.

Kushner&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot;, won the World Fantasy Award and the Mythopoeic Award in 1991. She has also published short stories and poetry in various anthologies, including The Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy and Horror and the &quot;Borderland&quot; series of urban fantasy anthologies for teenage readers.

In 1987, Kushner relocated from New York to Boston, and began working as a presenter in radio. She worked with public radio station WBGH-FM, first hosting its all-night radio program &quot;Night Air&quot;. In 1989 she hosted the &quot;Nakamichi International Music Series&quot; for American Public Radio (now Public Radio International), and later produced three Jewish holiday specials with APR, &quot;Festival of Liberation: the Passover Story in World Music&quot;, &quot;The Door is Open: a Jewish High Holiday Meditation&quot;, and &quot;Beyond 1492&quot;.

Beginning in 1996, Kushner wrote, programmed and hosted the series &quot;Sound &amp; Spirit&quot;, produced by WGBH/PRI. &quot;Sound &amp; Spirit&quot; was an hour-long weekly series &quot;exploring the human spirit through music and ideas.&quot; Episodes featured folk, classical, and world music, with a wide variety of special guests including Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, religious historian Elaine Pagels, and writer Neil Gaiman. &quot;Sound &amp; Spirit&quot; remained on the air until 2010.

In 2002, she released a CD of her story &quot;The Golden Dreydl: A Klezmer Nutcracker,&quot; which uses music from Pyotr Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; to tell a Hanukkah story. The music on the CD is performed by Shirim Klezmer Orchestra. &quot;The Golden Dreydl&quot; won a Gracie Award from American Women in Radio and Television. A live theater version of &quot;The Golden Dreydl&quot; was performed in 2008 and 2009 at Vital Theater in New York City, written by Kushner (who played &quot;Tante Miriam&quot; in the 2008 production) and directed by Linda Ames Key.

In 2007, Kushner, along with Elizabeth Schwartz and Yale Strom, scripted the musical audio drama &quot;The Witches of Lublin&quot; for public radio. Based on the history of Jewish women who were klezmer musicians in 18th Century Europe, &quot;The Witches of Lublin&quot; premiered on radio stations nationwide in April 2011 with performances by Tovah Feldshuh and Simon Jones. It won the 2012 Wilbur Award for Best Single Program, Radio; the 2012 Grace Allen Award for Best Director, and the 2012 Gabriel Award: Arts, Local Release, Radio.

In 2011 she co-edited (with Holly Black) &quot;Welcome to Bordertown,&quot; an anthology of new stories from Terri Windling&#x27;s seminal shared-world series. In an audiobook adaptation Neil Gaiman read his own work, set to an original score by Boiled in Lead&#x27;s Drew Miller.

In 2015, Kushner created &quot;Tremontaine&quot;, a serialized prequel to &quot;Swordspoint&quot;, for the Serial Box platform. The series ran for four seasons.

With Sherman and others, she is actively involved in the interstitial art movement. She is the co-founder and past president of the Interstitial Arts Foundation.

She is also a member of the Endicott Studio and has taught classes and seminars as part of Hollins University&#x27;s MFA program; the Odyssey Writing Workshop; and the Clarion Writers&#x27; Workshop.

<text>David Arnold Niehaus (February 19, 1935 – November 10, 2010) was an American sportscaster. He was the lead play-by-play announcer for the American League&#x27;s Seattle Mariners from their inaugural season in until his death after the 2010 season. In 2008, the National Baseball Hall of Fame awarded Niehaus the Ford C. Frick Award, the highest honor for American baseball broadcasters. Among fans nationwide and his peers, Niehaus was considered to be one of the greatest sportscasters in history.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Niehaus was born and raised in Princeton, Indiana. He graduated from Indiana University in 1957, entered the military, and began his broadcasting career with Armed Forces Radio. He became a partner of Dick Enberg on the broadcast team of the California Angels in 1969. Niehaus also broadcast for the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL and the UCLA Bruins football and basketball teams during this period.

===Seattle Mariners===
In 1977, Danny Kaye, part-owner of the Seattle Mariners expansion team, recruited Niehaus to become the franchise&#x27;s radio voice. Despite working for a franchise which from its first year in 1977 until 1991 was without a winning season, Niehaus&#x27;s talent gained recognition, and he was considered one of the few attractions for Mariners fans. Even in the period before the team&#x27;s memorable 1995 season, the Mariners were regularly one of the leading major-league teams in terms of the percentage of radios in use.

Niehaus became immensely popular in Seattle, twice being named Washington Sportscaster of the Year. The team chose him to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the opening of its new ballpark, Safeco Field, on July 15, 1999. That same year, Niehaus was added to the Nintendo 64 game &quot;Ken Griffey Jr.&#x27;s Slugfest&quot; as an announcer during gameplay.
In 2000 he was the second person to be inducted into the Mariners Hall of Fame, and in he was named the winner of the Ford C. Frick Award, which recognizes career excellence in baseball broadcasting and is considered the highest baseball broadcasting honor.

As of the end of the 2007 season, Niehaus had called 4,817 of the 4,899 games the Mariners had played since their inception.
May 7, 2009, was Niehaus&#x27; 5,000th game as a Mariners broadcaster. Niehaus broadcast 5,284 of the 5,385 Mariners games which had taken place as of the end of the 2010 season, and had intended to broadcast the full 2011 season.

===Notable catchphrases===
Niehaus is noted for using the following catchphrases on Mariner broadcasts:

*&quot;My, oh my!&quot; – a variant of former Angels partner Enberg&#x27;s &quot;Oh, my!&quot;, used for big, exciting plays.
*&quot;Swung on and belted!&quot; – used on long fly balls that may go over the wall for a home run.
*&quot;It will fly away!&quot; (sometimes &quot;Fly, fly away!&quot;) – used for home runs.

====Notable calls====


===Death===
Heart problems had forced Niehaus to undergo two angioplasties in 1996, causing him to give up smoking and change his diet. On November 10, 2010, he suffered a heart attack at his home in Bellevue, Washington, while preparing to barbecue some ribs on his deck, and died that day at the age of 75.

In a formal statement, Mariners Chairman Howard Lincoln and President Chuck Armstrong said &quot;Dave has truly been the heart and soul of this franchise since its inception in 1977... He truly was the fans&#x27; connection to every game.&quot; Washington governor Chris Gregoire said &quot;Today the Pacific Northwest lost one of its sports icons...Dave was an institution here starting with the team&#x27;s first pitch in 1977. With all due respect to the great Alvin Davis, Dave is &#x27;Mr. Mariner.&#x27;&quot; At news of Niehaus&#x27;s death, tributes came from Jay Buhner, Ken Griffey Jr., Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn, other Mariners broadcasters, and fans.

Prior to the Mariners&#x27; home opener in 2011 against the Cleveland Indians, the city of Seattle and King County declared April 8 &quot;My oh My! Dave Niehaus Day.&quot; After a successful petition drive by fans Glen Garnett and Mark Caylor, the city also gave the block of First Avenue S. between Edgar Martínez Dr. S. and S. Royal Brougham Way the honorary designation of Dave Niehaus Way S. A sign which paid tribute to Niehaus was unveiled in the press area.

===Tributes in Seattle===
On December 22, 2010, Seattle rapper Macklemore released a song called &quot;My Oh My&quot; in tribute to Niehaus. It describes the sportscaster&#x27;s influence on not only Macklemore&#x27;s own childhood but the lives of Seattleites in general. The song also features the audio clip of the winning call from the 1995 American League Division Series. When it was debuted by a radio host, numerous calls were received from Mariners fans who had pulled over on the highway in tears from the lyrical work and memory of Niehaus. Macklemore performed the song at Safeco Field on Opening Day 2011 during the team&#x27;s tribute to the late broadcaster.

A bronze statue of Niehaus was unveiled on September 16, 2011, at Safeco Field. Niehaus&#x27;s longtime broadcast partner Rick Rizzs presided over the private unveiling ceremony. The statue is located on the main concourse near Section 105 in right centerfield. It depicts Niehaus sitting at a desk behind a microphone, with his Mariners scorebook in front of him. 
The artist, Lou Cella, viewed dozens of photos before creating the statue, which was first sculpted in clay, then cast in bronze. There is an empty seat next to the statue so fans may sit next to Niehaus and pose for photos.

<text>N&#x27;Dea Davenport (born September 22, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer and producer. She was the lead vocalist in the UK acid jazz band The Brand New Heavies and made pioneering contributions to the genre of acid jazz.

==Career==
Her diverse projects include collaborations with music producers and artists, such as Mark Ronson, Louie Vega, Roger Sanchez, Guru’s &quot;Jazzmatazz&quot;, Madonna, Natalie Merchant, Mos Def, Sly and Robbie, J Dilla, and Malcolm McLaren. Dance scholarships, acting and music were the core of her developments as an artist and entertainer. Immediately after finishing college, she left her then home of Atlanta, Georgia, en route to Los Angeles. There she engaged in theatrical productions and commercial music video and was embraced by artists in both art, music and popular culture. Her legacy as an artist began also with her involvement in the burgeoning Los Angeles underground club and rave scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Working simultaneously as a dance artist and recording and commercial studio session singer, Davenport was soon connected with Fab Five Freddy, who recommended her to a DJ friend at new upstart label Delicious Vinyl. Eurythmics member and producer Dave Stewart offered Davenport a recording contract a year prior when introduced through a collaboration with Bootsy Collins and Malcolm McLaren, where she was featured on McLaren&#x27;s &quot;Waltz Darling&quot; LP. She declined Stewart’s offer at the time due to his requirement for her to relocate to London, England. Later to ink a solo development deal with Delicious Vinyl, who made introductions to her future bandmates, The Brand New Heavies who at the time had no singer. With the core band members based in London, she decided to relocate there.

The band’s initial UK indie label Acid Jazz Records, struck a deal with London Records for distribution in Europe and the rest of the world. During this period, the band produced a string of international albums and singles, invigorating a global movement and popularized the musical term known as acid jazz. Parallel to this, Davenport completed work on &quot;Guru&#x27;s Jazzmatazz, Vol. 1&quot;, with Guru.

In 1995, Davenport left the group citing irreconcilable differences, returning to the US and choosing New Orleans as a home base while she pursued other collaborations, and completed work on her solo recording with Delicious Vinyl. Encouragement received from her associate and record producer Daniel Lanois, resulted in the completion of her debut solo effort as producer, all except for four songs, produced by Dallas Austin. While her association with Delicious Vinyl was dissolving, Davenport&#x27;s project was picked up by the newly formed label owned by Sir Richard Branson. In 1998, her self-titled debut solo recording on V2 Records was released. She toured extensively in support of the album, around Europe, North America and Australia and with the concert series Lilith Fair. When the relationship at V2 came to an end she continued musically primarily focusing on European dance music projects.

Davenport held residency in New Orleans but lived primarily in New York City. Her diverse musical tastes led to an eventual stance as a New York club DJ, and she continues to DJ on special events around Asia. In 2006, she re-emerged once more with the Brand New Heavies for one last album release of &quot;Get Used To It.&quot; Her latest project is with collaborator Katsuya Everywhere in the multi-media based electronic and acoustic duo Celectrixx, which was conceived in Japan.

<doc id="1293320" wikidata="Q2088687" url="?curid=1293320" title="Hamad Town">
<text>Madinat Hamad or &quot;Hamad Town&quot; () is a primarily commuter city within northern Bahrain. It was a municipality of Bahrain in the central part of the country. Split from the municipality of Ar Rifa&#x27; wa al Mintaqah al Janubiyah in 1991, its territory is now in the Northern Governorate. Its name refers to the current king of Bahrain, Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa. The city is culturally diverse, housing a proportionally mixed Shia-Sunni population of varying socio-economic backgrounds. Today, Hamad Town is an epitome of Bahraini multiculturalism, with no single ethnic or religious group making up the majority of inhabitants.

== History ==

Hamad Town was set up in 1984 as a &#x27;housing town&#x27; where the government built council houses for those who could not afford the ever increasing house prices in other parts of the country. In 1990 the government opened the door of Bahrain to the Kuwaiti people who were suffering from the effects of the Gulf War with Iraq. It provided free houses and schools in Hamad Town allowed them to use the town&#x27;s facilities. The Kuwaitis returned home in early 1991 at the end of the war. In 2001 the government gave the council houses to the people of Hamad town for free.

== Geography ==

Hamad Town is 18 km from the capital Manama and 19 km from the airport. It is close to the Sakhir area, which contains the huge Formula One motor racing circuit (Bahrain International Circuit), which is the biggest circuit in the Middle East.

Hamad Town is famous for its 22 roundabouts. Residential addresses are based on the number of the nearest roundabout. By 2005 the population of the town was 52718. It has now supplanted Isa Town in regard to population-density ranking.

== Law and government ==

Hamad Town is part of the North Governorate, one of five governorates of Bahrain. However, governorates are forbidden from passing their own laws and must abide by all national laws of the Kingdom of Bahrain.

== Economy ==

The people of Hamad Town tend to go the capital Manama to work. Most of Hamad Town is a residential area but there is a large shopping centre called Sooq Waqif which contains many shops and provides some employment in Hamad Town itself.

==Mosques==
* Kanoo Mosque — Shakh Hamad road, between the second and third roundabouts
* Masjid Al Ajoor — tenth roundabout

== Transport ==
Bahrain International Airport is located 19.7 km from Hamad Town.

The town&#x27;s road system consists of a series of roundabouts - 22 major numbered roundabouts and several unnamed roundabouts, - that serve as the arterial roads within the town. These roundabouts play a crucial role in facilitating transportation and communication within the town.

In addition to its extensive road system, Hamad Town also has some transport links with sparse public bus stops served by the Bahrain Public Transport Buses. These buses provide a convenient and affordable transportation option for those who prefer not to drive or do not have access to a personal vehicle.

It is served by the Shaikh Khalifa bin Salman Highway on the east, which has five highway exits located at Roundabout 0, Roundabout 6, Roundabout 14, Roundabout 18, and Roundabout 22 to the south. On the west, Hamad Town connects to Road 106, which connects to all the villages incorporated into the town.

== Demographics ==

:Population (2001):166824.
:Density: 1204.16/km²

== Neighbourhoods ==

<text>The Craigieburn line is a commuter railway line in the city of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Operated by Metro Trains Melbourne, it is the city&#x27;s seventh shortest metropolitan railway line at . The line runs from Flinders Street station in central Melbourne to Craigieburn station in the north, serving 21 stations via North Melbourne, Essendon, and Broadmeadows. The line operates for approximately 19 hours a day (from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 am) with 24 hour service available on Friday and Saturday nights. During peak hour, headways of up to 5 minutes are operated with services every 20–30 minutes during off-peak hours. Trains on the Craigieburn line run with a two three-car formations of Comeng or Siemens Nexas trainsets.

Services on the line began from North Melbourne to Essendon by the Melbourne &amp; Essendon Railway Company in November 1860. It was closed shortly after, however, the Victorian Railways reopened the Flemington Racecourse line (including the Essendon line as far as Newmarket) in November 1867, and in January 1871, to Essendon. The line was progressively electrified and, in 1921, the line was electrified to Broadmeadows, where it remained until the extension of electrification in 2007.

Since the 2000s, due to the heavily utilised infrastructure of the Craigieburn line, improvements and upgrades have been made. Works have included replacing sleepers, upgrading signalling technology, the extension of the line to Craigieburn, the construction of new stations, the removal of level crossings, the introduction of new rolling stock, and station accessibility upgrades.

== History ==

=== 19th century ===
The line from North Melbourne to Essendon was opened by the Melbourne &amp; Essendon Railway Company in November 1860. Soon after, the company opened a branch from Newmarket to Flemington Racecourse. Both lines were closed shortly after, in July 1864. The Victorian Railways reopened the Flemington Racecourse line (including the Essendon line as far as Newmarket) in November 1867, and in January 1871, to Essendon. In April 1872, the line was extended to a temporary terminus outside Seymour, awaiting completion of a bridge over the Goulburn River. In December 1894, through services were provided from Essendon to Brighton Beach on the Sandringham line.

=== 20th century ===
Automatic Block Signalling was introduced on the line in 1918, with Kensington to Essendon being converted in June of that year, and North Melbourne to Kensington in October. In May 1919, Flinders Street to Essendon and the Sandringham line were the first lines to be electrified in Melbourne, apart from a test installation on the Flemington Racecourse line. In 1921, the line was electrified to Broadmeadows, where it remained until the extension of electrification in 2007.

In January 1924, an extra pair of tracks, including a flying junction, opened between North Melbourne and Kensington, enabling the separation of passenger and goods traffic in the busy section. Further works were carried out in 1929, when the double tracked Albion–Jacana freight line opened, permitting freight trains to avoid the line via Essendon.

A branch line was opened during the Second World War to Broadstore, designed to connect Broadmeadows station with the Maygar Barracks. The line opened on 12 October 1942 and remaining in operation until 1982, when usage of the base began to cease.

Automatic Block Signalling was extended to Broadmeadows in November 1965.

=== 21st century ===

In 2003, an unmanned suburban train rolled the length of the line from Broadmeadows station for nearly , eventually crashing into another stationary train at Spencer Street station. 11 people sustained minor injuries, however, nobody was seriously injured or killed from the accident.

On 30 September 2007, electrification of the Broadmeadows line was extended along the regional V/Line tracks to Craigieburn. The Craigieburn rail project delivered projects including:

* Upgrading Craigieburn station to premium station status
* A new station at Roxburgh Park
* New train stabling facilities at Craigieburn
* Construction of overhead wiring system with new sub-stations
* Installation of new signalling systems along the Broadmeadows—Craigieburn corridor
* The provision for a new station at Coolaroo (this ended up being built under another government)

The Craigieburn Rail project started construction in May 2005 and was completed in late September 2007. An additional set of projects were delivered later on, with a new station at Coolaroo opened in 2010 and the construction of a fully-fledged train maintenance facility under the Brumby government.

=== Level Crossing Removals ===

The Level Crossing Removal Project announced the removal of 2 level crossings on the line, to be completed in stages from 2018 to 2022. In 2018, one level crossing was removed at Buckley Street, Essendon. The crossing was removed by lowering the road line underneath the rail line. The second crossing to be removed was the one at Glenroy Road, Glenroy, by lowering the rail line underneath the road. In addition, Glenroy station was rebuilt with a modern, wheelchair accessible, lowered design. As a result of these removals, the Craigieburn line now has five remaining crossings on the corridor that are not slated for removal.

== Future ==

=== Wallan extension ===
Highlighted in the 2018 Victorian Rail Plan, a proposal exists for the Craigieburn line to be connected to the Upfield line, via the construction of a rail link along the Somerton rail corridor. In addition, the Upfield line would be extended to Wallan. The 2018 Victorian Rail Plan has proposed the following projects take place as part of the Wallan extension:

In 2018, the government announced that a business case would be completed for to further investigate the positivity for these series of projects to commence. A business case was completed, however, it was not released to the public. Since the business case in 2018, there has been little developments despite the &#x27;Metro Tunnel Day One&#x27; milestone of the 2018 Plan fast approaching. Only a small amount of attention has been given by local residents, council, an action group and some political parties.

== Network and operations ==

=== Services ===
Services on the Craigieburn line operates from approximately 5:00 am to around 12:00 daily. In general, during peak hours, train frequency is 5–10 minutes in the AM peak on the Craigieburn line while during non-peak hours the frequency is reduced to 20–30 minutes throughout the entire route. On Friday nights and weekends, services run 24 hours a day, with 60 minute frequencies available outside of normal operating hours.

Train services on the Craigieburn line are also subjected to maintenance and renewal works, usually on selected Fridays and Saturdays. Shuttle bus services are provided throughout the duration of works for affected commuters.

==== Stopping patterns ====

* ▼ – Only outbound trains stop
* | – Trains pass and do not stop


=== Operators ===
The Craigieburn line has had a total of 8 operators since its opening in 1860. The majority of operations throughout its history have been government run: from the acquisition of the service from private operator the Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company in 1871 until the 1999 privatisation of Melbourne&#x27;s rail network, four different government operators have run the line. These operators, Victorian Railways, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Public Transport Corporation, and Bayside Trains have a combined operational length of 129 years.

Bayside Trains was privatised in August 1998 and later rebranded M&gt;Train. In 2002, M&gt;Train was placed into receivership and the state government regained ownership of the line, with KPMG appointed as receivers to operate M&gt;Train on behalf of the state government. Two years later, rival train operator Connex Melbourne took over the M&gt;Train operations including the Frankston line. Metro Trains Melbourne, the current private operator, then took over the operations in 2009. The private operators have had a combined operational period of years.
=== Route ===

The Craigieburn line forms a somewhat linear route from the Melbourne central business district to its terminus in Craigieburn. The route is long and is fully double tracked. The only underground section of the Craigieburn line is in the City Loop, where the service stops at 3 underground stations. Exiting the city, the line steadily rises after leaving North Melbourne until after Essendon, when it then drops slightly to cross Moonee Ponds Creek. Soon after the line encounters the Glenroy Bank, a continuous rising gradient of 1 in 50 for almost 3 kilometres (1.9 mi). After Glenroy, it continues to rise to the end of the suburban line (and beyond). Some sections of the line has been elevated or lowered into a cutting to eliminate level crossings. Despite some removals, there are a number of level crossings still present with no current plans to remove them.

The line follows the same alignment as multiple lines with the Craigieburn line splitting off at North Melbourne. The Craigieburn line continues on its north western alignment, whereas the other lines continue onto a northern, western, or south-western alignment. Most of the rail line goes through built-up suburbs and some industrial areas.

=== Stations ===
The line serves 21 stations across of track. The stations are a mix of elevated, lowered, underground, and ground level designs. Underground stations are present only in the City Loop, with the majority of elevated and lowered stations being constructed as part of level crossing removals. 

== Infrastructure ==
=== Rolling stock ===
The Craigieburn line uses two different types of electric multiple unit (EMU) trains that are operated in a split six-car configuration. The primary rolling stock featured on the line is the Comeng EMUs, built by Commonwealth Engineering between 1981 and 1988. These train sets are the oldest on the Melbourne rail network and subsequently will be replaced by the mid 2030s. The second type of rolling stock is the Siemens Nexas EMUs which are also widely featured on the line, originally built between 2002 and 2005, these train sets feature more modern technology than the Comeng trains.

Alongside the passenger trains, Craigieburn line tracks and equipment are maintained by a fleet of engineering trains. The four types of engineering trains are: the shunting train; designed for moving trains along non-electrified corridors and for transporting other maintenance locomotives, for track evaluation; designed for evaluating track and its condition, the overhead inspection train; designed for overhead wiring inspection, and the infrastructure evaluation carriage designed for general infrastructure evaluation. Most of these trains are repurposed locomotives previously used by V/Line, Metro Trains, and the Southern Shorthaul Railroad.

==== Planned rolling stock ====
From the middle of 2020s, the next generation of the X&#x27;Trapolis family of electric EMUs—the X&#x27;Trapolis 2.0—will be introduced. This new model will fully replace the existing fleet of Comeng EMUs currently operating on the line currently with new, modern, and technologically advanced trains. The new trains will feature:

* Modernised doors to reduce the boarding times at stations to under 40 seconds
* Passenger information systems to display that train&#x27;s journey in real time
* Higher energy efficiency to work with a lower network voltage, to fit in line with modern rail systems overseas
* New interior designs including tip-up seating to allow space for wheelchair spaces.
* Designated bicycle storage areas
* Passenger operated automatic wheelchair ramps located behind driver cabs
* 6 car fully walk through carriages

=== Accessibility ===

In compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992, all stations that are new-built or rebuilt are fully accessible and comply with these guidelines. Just over half of the stations on the corridor are fully accessible, however, there are some stations that haven&#x27;t been upgraded to meet these guidelines. These stations do feature ramps, however, they have a gradient greater than 1 in 14. Stations that are fully accessible feature ramps that have a gradient less than 1 in 14, have at-grade paths, or feature lifts. These stations typically also feature tactile boarding indicators, independent boarding ramps, wheelchair accessible myki barriers, hearing loops, and widened paths.

Projects improving station accessibility have included the Level Crossing Removal Project, which involves station rebuilds and upgrades, and individual station upgrade projects. These works have made significant strides in improving network accessibility, with more than 57% of Craigieburn line stations classed as fully accessible. Future station upgrade projects will continue to increase the number of fully accessible stations overtime.

=== Signalling ===
The Craigieburn line uses three position signalling which is widely used across the Melbourne train network. Three position signalling was first introduced in 1918, with the final section of the line converted to the new type of signalling in 2007.

<text>Muharraq () is Bahrain&#x27;s third most populous city (after the capital Manama and Riffa) and served as its capital until 1932 when it was replaced by Manama. The population of Muharraq in 2020 was 263,373.

The city is located on Muharraq Island. Bahrain International Airport is also located on the island. Adjacent to Muharraq are the man-made Amwaj Islands, known for their large buildings, hotels and beaches. Muharraq is home to Muharraq Club, which is Bahrain&#x27;s most successful football club. It is home to the famous Siyadi House. The city is also known for its souq (traditional market) and as a home of traditional arts and music; Ali Bahar, a popular and successful Bahraini singer is from Muharraq.

==History==

Muharraq was originally part of Dilmun, a Semitic speaking Bronze Age polity. Later, it became the city of Arwad on the island of Tylos (as Bahrain was referred to in antiquity), believed by some (including Strabo and Herodotus) to be the birthplace of Phoenicia. At the end of Persian rule, Bahrain came under the domination of the Seleucid Greeks, and Muharraq was the centre of a pagan cult dedicated to the ox god, Awal. 

By the 5th century AD, Muharraq had become a major centre of Nestorian Christianity, which had come to dominate the southern shores of the Persian Gulf. As a sect, the Nestorians were often persecuted as heretics by the Byzantine Empire, but Bahrain was outside the Empire&#x27;s control offering safety. The names of several of Muharraq&#x27;s villages today reflect this Christian legacy, with Al-Dair meaning &#x27;the monastery&#x27; and Qalali meaning a &#x27;monk&#x27;s cloisters&#x27;.

Taken by the Portuguese (1521) and the Persians (1602), Al-Muḥarraq passed to the control of the Āl Khalīfah dynasty in 1783 with the rest of Bahrain.

==Economy==
Gulf Air has its headquarters in Muharraq, and Bahrain Air formerly had its headquarters in the Mohamed Centre in Muharraq.

==Government and infrastructure==
Building 586 in Muharraq houses the headquarters of the Civil Aviation Affairs, an agency of the Ministry of Transportation.

==Education==

The Ministry of Education of Bahrain operates public government schools.

Girls schools include A&#x27;amena bint Wahab Primary Girls School, Al-Muharraq Primary Girls School, Mariam bent Omran Primary Girls School, Zubaida Primary Girls School, Istiklal, Khadija al-Kubra Intermediate Girls School, Zanoobia Intermediate Girls School, and Muharraq Secondary Girls School.

The French School of Bahrain is located in Busaiteen, in Muharraq Municipality.

==Firjan (districts)==

Firjan is the plural of the Arabic word &quot;Fareej&quot; which translates to district. The oldest and largest Fareej in Muharraq is Fareej Al Bin Ali. It was established by Sunni Arabs belonging to the Al Bin Ali tribe in the 17th century and until recently, members of the tribe still lived in that Fareej.

Other Firjan in Muharraq include: Al Bu Khmais, Al-Gumra, Al-Zayayina, Al-Ma&#x27;awida, Bin Ghatim, Al-Jowder, Bin Hindi, Al-&#x27;Amamira, Al-Mahmeed, Al-Hayaj (or Al-Hayayej), Al-Sanqal, Al-Dosa, Al-Sagha, Sheikh Abdullah Sheikh Hamad, and Bin Khatir are all Sunni districts. Unlike Manama&#x27;s firjans which are mostly Shia, Muharraq has fareejs which are mostly Sunni.

<doc id="1293340" wikidata="Q2603912" url="?curid=1293340" title="Classical field theory">
<text>A classical field theory is a physical theory that predicts how one or more fields in physics interact with matter through field equations, without considering effects of quantization; theories that incorporate quantum mechanics are called quantum field theories. In most contexts, &#x27;classical field theory&#x27; is specifically intended to describe electromagnetism and gravitation, two of the fundamental forces of nature.

A physical field can be thought of as the assignment of a physical quantity at each point of space and time. For example, in a weather forecast, the wind velocity during a day over a country is described by assigning a vector to each point in space. Each vector represents the direction of the movement of air at that point, so the set of all wind vectors in an area at a given point in time constitutes a vector field. As the day progresses, the directions in which the vectors point change as the directions of the wind change.

The first field theories, Newtonian gravitation and Maxwell&#x27;s equations of electromagnetic fields were developed in classical physics before the advent of relativity theory in 1905, and had to be revised to be consistent with that theory. Consequently, classical field theories are usually categorized as &quot;non-relativistic&quot; and &quot;relativistic&quot;. Modern field theories are usually expressed using the mathematics of tensor calculus. A more recent alternative mathematical formalism describes classical fields as sections of mathematical objects called fiber bundles.

== History ==

Michael Faraday coined the term &quot;field&quot; and lines of forces to explain electric and magnetic phenomena. Lord Kelvin in 1851 formalized the concept of field in different areas of physics.

== Non-relativistic field theories ==
Some of the simplest physical fields are vector force fields. Historically, the first time that fields were taken seriously was with Faraday&#x27;s lines of force when describing the electric field. The gravitational field was then similarly described.

===Newtonian gravitation===
The first field theory of gravity was Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation in which the mutual interaction between two masses obeys an inverse square law. This was very useful for predicting the motion of planets around the Sun.

Any massive body &quot;M&quot; has a gravitational field g which describes its influence on other massive bodies. The gravitational field of &quot;M&quot; at a point r in space is found by determining the force F that &quot;M&quot; exerts on a small test mass &quot;m&quot; located at r, and then dividing by &quot;m&quot;:
formula_1
Stipulating that &quot;m&quot; is much smaller than &quot;M&quot; ensures that the presence of &quot;m&quot; has a negligible influence on the behavior of &quot;M&quot;.

According to Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, F(r) is given by
formula_2
where formula_3 is a unit vector pointing along the line from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;G&quot; is Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant. Therefore, the gravitational field of &quot;M&quot; is
formula_4

The experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal to unprecedented levels of accuracy leads to the identification of the gravitational field strength as identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the equivalence principle, which leads to general relativity.

For a discrete collection of masses, &quot;Mi&quot;, located at points, r&quot;i&quot;, the gravitational field at a point r due to the masses is
formula_5

If we have a continuous mass distribution &quot;ρ&quot; instead, the sum is replaced by an integral,
formula_6

Note that the direction of the field points from the position r to the position of the masses r&quot;i&quot;; this is ensured by the minus sign. In a nutshell, this means all masses attract.

In the integral form Gauss&#x27;s law for gravity is
formula_7
while in differential form it is
formula_8

Therefore, the gravitational field g can be written in terms of the gradient of a gravitational potential :
formula_9
This is a consequence of the gravitational force F being conservative.

=== Electromagnetism ===
==== Electrostatics ====
A charged test particle with charge &quot;q&quot; experiences a force F based solely on its charge. We can similarly describe the electric field E generated by the source charge &quot;Q&quot; so that :
formula_10

Using this and Coulomb&#x27;s law the electric field due to a single charged particle is
formula_11

The electric field is conservative, and hence is given by the gradient of a scalar potential, 
formula_12

Gauss&#x27;s law for electricity is in integral form
formula_13
while in differential form
formula_14

==== Magnetostatics ====
A steady current &quot;I&quot; flowing along a path &quot;ℓ&quot; will exert a force on nearby charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. The force exerted by &quot;I&quot; on a nearby charge &quot;q&quot; with velocity v is
formula_15
where B(r) is the magnetic field, which is determined from &quot;I&quot; by the Biot–Savart law:
formula_16

The magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. However, it can be written in terms of a vector potential, A(r):
formula_17

Gauss&#x27;s law for magnetism in integral form is
formula_18
while in differential form it is
formula_19

The physical interpretation is that there are no magnetic monopoles.

==== Electrodynamics ====
In general, in the presence of both a charge density &quot;ρ&quot;(r, &quot;t&quot;) and current density J(r, &quot;t&quot;), there will be both an electric and a magnetic field, and both will vary in time. They are determined by Maxwell&#x27;s equations, a set of differential equations which directly relate E and B to the electric charge density (charge per unit volume) &quot;ρ&quot; and current density (electric current per unit area) J.

Alternatively, one can describe the system in terms of its scalar and vector potentials &quot;V&quot; and A. A set of integral equations known as &quot;retarded potentials&quot; allow one to calculate &quot;V&quot; and A from ρ and J, and from there the electric and magnetic fields are determined via the relations
formula_20
formula_21

=== Continuum mechanics ===
==== Fluid dynamics ====
Fluid dynamics has fields of pressure, density, and flow rate that are connected by conservation laws for energy and momentum. The mass continuity equation is a continuity equation, representing the conservation of mass
formula_22
and the Navier–Stokes equations represent the conservation of momentum in the fluid, found from Newton&#x27;s laws applied to the fluid,
formula_23
if the density , pressure , deviatoric stress tensor of the fluid, as well as external body forces b, are all given. The velocity field u is the vector field to solve for.

=== Other examples ===
In 1839, James MacCullagh presented field equations to describe reflection and refraction in &quot;An essay toward a dynamical theory of crystalline reflection and refraction&quot;.

== Potential theory ==
The term &quot;potential theory&quot; arises from the fact that, in 19th century physics, the fundamental forces of nature were believed to be derived from scalar potentials which satisfied Laplace&#x27;s equation. Poisson addressed the question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation from the perturbation forces, and derived the Poisson&#x27;s equation, named after him. The general form of this equation is

formula_24

where &quot;σ&quot; is a source function (as a density, a quantity per unit volume) and ø the scalar potential to solve for.

In Newtonian gravitation, masses are the sources of the field so that field lines terminate at objects that have mass. Similarly, charges are the sources and sinks of electrostatic fields: positive charges emanate electric field lines, and field lines terminate at negative charges. These field concepts are also illustrated in the general divergence theorem, specifically Gauss&#x27;s law&#x27;s for gravity and electricity. For the cases of time-independent gravity and electromagnetism, the fields are gradients of corresponding potentials
formula_25
so substituting these into Gauss&#x27; law for each case obtains
formula_26

where &quot;ρg&quot; is the mass density, &quot;ρe&quot; the charge density, &quot;G&quot; the gravitational constant and &quot;ke = 1/4πε0&quot; the electric force constant.

Incidentally, this similarity arises from the similarity between Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation and Coulomb&#x27;s law.

In the case where there is no source term (e.g. vacuum, or paired charges), these potentials obey Laplace&#x27;s equation:
formula_27

For a distribution of mass (or charge), the potential can be expanded in a series of spherical harmonics, and the &quot;n&quot;th term in the series can be viewed as a potential arising from the 2&quot;n&quot;-moments (see multipole expansion). For many purposes only the monopole, dipole, and quadrupole terms are needed in calculations.

== Relativistic field theory ==
Modern formulations of classical field theories generally require Lorentz covariance as this is now recognised as a fundamental aspect of nature. A field theory tends to be expressed mathematically by using Lagrangians. This is a function that, when subjected to an action principle, gives rise to the field equations and a conservation law for the theory. The action is a Lorentz scalar, from which the field equations and symmetries can be readily derived.

Throughout we use units such that the speed of light in vacuum is 1, i.e. &quot;c&quot; = 1.

=== Lagrangian dynamics ===
Given a field tensor formula_28, a scalar called the Lagrangian density formula_29 can be constructed from formula_28 and its derivatives.
From this density, the action functional can be constructed by integrating over spacetime,
formula_31

Where formula_32 is the volume form in curved spacetime. formula_33

Therefore, the Lagrangian itself is equal to the integral of the Lagrangian density over all space.

Then by enforcing the action principle, the Euler–Lagrange equations are obtained

formula_34

== Relativistic fields ==
Two of the most well-known Lorentz-covariant classical field theories are now described.

=== Electromagnetism ===
Historically, the first (classical) field theories were those describing the electric and magnetic fields (separately). After numerous experiments, it was found that these two fields were related, or, in fact, two aspects of the same field: the electromagnetic field. Maxwell&#x27;s theory of electromagnetism describes the interaction of charged matter with the electromagnetic field. The first formulation of this field theory used vector fields to describe the electric and magnetic fields. With the advent of special relativity, a more complete formulation using tensor fields was found. Instead of using two vector fields describing the electric and magnetic fields, a tensor field representing these two fields together is used.

The electromagnetic four-potential is defined to be , and the electromagnetic four-current . The electromagnetic field at any point in spacetime is described by the antisymmetric (0,2)-rank electromagnetic field tensor
formula_35

==== The Lagrangian ====
To obtain the dynamics for this field, we try and construct a scalar from the field. In the vacuum, we have
formula_36

We can use gauge field theory to get the interaction term, and this gives us
formula_37

==== The equations ====
To obtain the field equations, the electromagnetic tensor in the Lagrangian density needs to be replaced by its definition in terms of the 4-potential &quot;A&quot;, and it&#x27;s this potential which enters the Euler-Lagrange equations. The EM field &quot;F&quot; is not varied in the EL equations. Therefore,
formula_38

Evaluating the derivative of the Lagrangian density with respect to the field components
formula_39
and the derivatives of the field components
formula_40
obtains Maxwell&#x27;s equations in vacuum. The source equations (Gauss&#x27; law for electricity and the Maxwell-Ampère law) are
formula_41
while the other two (Gauss&#x27; law for magnetism and Faraday&#x27;s law) are obtained from the fact that &quot;F&quot; is the 4-curl of &quot;A&quot;, or, in other words, from the fact that the Bianchi identity holds for the electromagnetic field tensor.
formula_42

where the comma indicates a partial derivative.

=== Gravitation ===

After Newtonian gravitation was found to be inconsistent with special relativity, Albert Einstein formulated a new theory of gravitation called general relativity. This treats gravitation as a geometric phenomenon (&#x27;curved spacetime&#x27;) caused by masses and represents the gravitational field mathematically by a tensor field called the metric tensor. The Einstein field equations describe how this curvature is produced. Newtonian gravitation is now superseded by Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, in which gravitation is thought of as being due to a curved spacetime, caused by masses. The Einstein field equations,
formula_43
describe how this curvature is produced by matter and radiation, where &quot;Gab&quot; is the Einstein tensor,
formula_44
written in terms of the Ricci tensor &quot;Rab&quot; and Ricci scalar , is the stress–energy tensor and is a constant. In the absence of matter and radiation (including sources) the &#x27;vacuum field equations&quot;,
formula_45
can be derived by varying the Einstein–Hilbert action,
formula_46
with respect to the metric, where &quot;g&quot; is the determinant of the metric tensor &quot;gab&quot;. Solutions of the vacuum field equations are called vacuum solutions. An alternative interpretation, due to Arthur Eddington, is that formula_47 is fundamental, formula_48 is merely one aspect of formula_47, and formula_50 is forced by the choice of units.

=== Further examples ===
Further examples of Lorentz-covariant classical field theories are
* Klein-Gordon theory for real or complex scalar fields
* Dirac theory for a Dirac spinor field
* Yang–Mills theory for a non-abelian gauge field

== Unification attempts ==
Attempts to create a unified field theory based on classical physics are classical unified field theories. During the years between the two World Wars, the idea of unification of gravity with electromagnetism was actively pursued by several mathematicians and physicists like Albert Einstein, Theodor Kaluza, Hermann Weyl, Arthur Eddington, Gustav Mie and Ernst Reichenbacher.

Early attempts to create such theory were based on incorporation of electromagnetic fields into the geometry of general relativity. In 1918, the case for the first geometrization of the electromagnetic field was proposed in 1918 by Hermann Weyl.
In 1919, the idea of a five-dimensional approach was suggested by Theodor Kaluza. From that, a theory called Kaluza-Klein Theory was developed. It attempts to unify gravitation and electromagnetism, in a five-dimensional space-time.
There are several ways of extending the representational framework for a unified field theory which have been considered by Einstein and other researchers. These extensions in general are based in two options. The first option is based in relaxing the conditions imposed on the original formulation, and the second is based in introducing other mathematical objects into the theory. An example of the first option is relaxing the restrictions to four-dimensional space-time by considering higher-dimensional representations. That is used in Kaluza-Klein Theory. For the second, the most prominent example arises from the concept of the affine connection that was introduced into the theory of general relativity mainly through the work of Tullio Levi-Civita and Hermann Weyl.

Further development of quantum field theory changed the focus of searching for unified field theory from classical to quantum description. Because of that, many theoretical physicists gave up looking for a classical unified field theory. Quantum field theory would include unification of two other fundamental forces of nature, the strong and weak nuclear force which act on the subatomic level.

<text>Rajab () is the seventh month of the Islamic calendar. The lexical definition of the classical Arabic verb &quot;rajaba&quot; is &quot;to respect&quot;, which could also mean &quot;be awe or be in fear&quot;, of which Rajab is a derivative.

This month is regarded as one of the four sacred months (including Muharram, Dhu al-Qadah and Dhu al-Hijjah) in Islam in which battles are prohibited. The pre-Islamic Arabs also considered warfare to be blasphemous during these four months.

Muslims believe Rajab is the month in which ‘Alī ibn Abī Tālib, the first Shia Imam and the fourth Rashidun caliph, was born.

Rajab is also the month during which Isra and Mi&#x27;raj (Muhammad&#x27;s journey from Mecca to Jerusalem and then through the seven Heavens) took place.

Rajab and Shaʿbān are a prelude to the holy month of Ramaḍān.

==Name==

The word &quot;Rajab&quot; came from &quot;rajūb&quot; (رجوب), the sense of veneration or glorification, and Rajab was also formerly called &quot;Mudhar&quot; because the tribe of &quot;Mudhar&quot; did not change it but rather expected its time to be different than the rest of the Arabs, who changed and altered the months according to the state of war.

The name of Rajab literally means respected, regarded, and admired. It seems that the word is originally a Semitic one. There are two important events during the month, namely the birthday of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Muhammad&#x27;s first revelation in Shia tradition. There are other names for the month, such as Rajab Al-Morrajjab, Rajab Al-Asab, and Rajab Sharif.

===The 27th of Rajab===
Shias believe that the month of Rajab is one of the 4 holy months. The 27th of Rajab 5 verses of the holy Quran(first 5 verses of Surah al alaq) slowly ascended from the 4th heaven to Prophet Muhammad (saws) while in cave of hira. Shias believe the remainder of the Quran was later given directly to prophet muhammad(saws) heart during the month of ramadan. It is recommended to fast as many days as possible in the month of rajab and highly recommended on the 27th of rajab. 

==Timing==
The Islamic calendar is a purely lunar calendar, and months begin when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. Since the lunar year is 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year, Rajab migrates throughout the seasons. The estimated start and end dates for Rajab, based on the Umm al-Qura of Saudi Arabia, are:

* 7 Rajab: Twelvers observe the Festival of Imam Musa al-Kazim in dedication of Musā&#x27; al-Kādhim. This is so as to avoid missing celebrating the birth of the seventh imam, which took place in Safar.

<text>Okamanpeedan (or Okamanpadu) Lake, partially located in Martin County, Minnesota, and Emmet County, Iowa, is also known as Tuttle Lake. Okamanpeedan Lake is a roughly 2,300-acre (9.3 km2) riverine lake located on the East Fork of the Des Moines River. It has an average depth of about four to six feet (1.2 to 1.8 m). The lake has a contributing watershed of approximately 120,056 acres (486 km2) and watershed:lake ratio on the order of about 50:1. The lake is situated in a glacial till plain and is generally in an area dominated by loamy, poorly drained soils. The area is primarily level but does have some rolling hills.

Okamanpeedan Lake was explored by Joseph Nicollet during his 1838 expedition. He recognized the Sioux name for the lake, which means &quot;nesting place of the herons&quot;, because of the large number of herons nesting in tall trees along its shores. Calvin Tuttle was the first settler along the lake, thus that became another name for this body of water.

Okamanpeedan&#x27;s southwest shore is home to the Tuttle Lake Recreation Area, which includes sixty campsites and a boat launch. Okamanpeedan State Park, maintained by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, is located on the body&#x27;s southeast shoreline.

Fish found in Okamanpeedan Lake include walleye, northern pike, crappie, yellow perch, bullhead, catfish and American Grass carp.

<text>The following is an extensive catalogue of the variants and specific unique elements of each variant and/or design stage of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, a heavy bomber used by the United States Army Air Forces and other Allied air forces during World War II.

==Boeing Model 299 (B-17) ==
The Model 299 was the original aircraft built by Boeing to fulfill an August 1934 requirement by the United States Army Air Corps for a bomber capable of carrying of bombs at . The 299 was powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney S1EG Hornet radial engines, giving a maximum speed of and a maximum gross weight of . It carried a bomb load of up to eight bombs, with a defensive armament of five machine guns, with one in a nose turret and one each in dorsal and ventral mounts and two in waist blisters. In 1935, Boeing&#x27;s Model 299 competed with entries from other aircraft companies at an evaluation at Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio, USA.

On its flight from Seattle, Washington to Wright Field for the competition, the 299 set a nonstop speed record of . Though it crashed and burned on takeoff during a demonstration, the crash was due to flight-crew error, when unreleased gust locks prevented flight surfaces from moving, not from any technical flaw in the aircraft. Subsequently, a mandatory pre-flight checklist prior to take-off was required. Despite the crash and its much higher unit cost, the Army Air Corps leaders was impressed by its performance, so Boeing was awarded a development contract. The aircraft has since been referred to as the XB-17, but this designation was not contemporary or official.

==Y1B-17 (YB-17)==


Though still enthusiastic about the Boeing design, despite it being disqualified from the fly-off contest following the crash of the Model 299 prototype, the Army Air Corps cut its order from 65 service test YB-17s to just 13. On November 20, 1936, the bomber&#x27;s normal acquisition funding was changed to &quot;F-1&quot;, indicating funding outside of normal annual allocations, and the heavy YB-17 bomber was redesignated &quot;Y1B-17&quot;, as a result.

Unlike the first example, which had used Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1690 Hornet radial engines, the Y1B-17 used the more powerful Wright R-1820 Cyclone that would be the standard power plant for all subsequent B-17s. Changes were also made in the armament, and the crew was reduced from seven to six. Most changes were minor: the most notable was switching from double-wishbone to single-arm landing gear for ease of maintenance.

On 7 December 1936, five days after the first flight of the Y1B-17, the brakes fused during landing, and it nosed over. Though damage was minimal, the cumulative impact of this event, combined with the crash of the Model 299, triggered a Congressional investigation. Following the crash, the Army Air Corps was put on notice and another crash would mean the end of the bomber&#x27;s &quot;F-1&quot; procurement program.

The commander of Army General Headquarters (Air Force), Major General Frank Andrews, assigned twelve Y1B-17s to the 2nd Bomb Group located at Langley Field, Virginia to develop heavy bombing techniques. Of the thirteen Boeing aircraft built, one was assigned for stress testing. Most of the time spent with the bombers entailed eliminating problems with the aircraft but the most important development was the use of a detailed checklist reviewed by the pilot and copilot prior to each takeoff. It was hoped that this procedure would prevent further accidents.

In May 1938, the Y1B-17s (now redesignated as B-17) of the 2nd Bombardment Group, led by the lead bombers&#x27; navigator Curtis LeMay, took part in a demonstration in which they intercepted the Italian liner &quot;Rex&quot;. Coming into contact with the liner while it was still out at sea, the demonstration was meant to prove the range and capabilities of the B-17. It also showed that the bomber could attack a naval invasion force before it could reach land. The Navy was furious about the Army&#x27;s intrusion into their mission, and forced the War Department to issue an order restricting the Army Air Corps from operating more than a hundred miles from America&#x27;s coastline.

After three years of flight, no serious incidents occurred with the B-17s. In October 1940, they were transferred to the 19th Bombardment Group at March Field.

==B-17A (Y1B-17A)==

The aircraft that became the sole Y1B-17A was originally ordered as a static test bed. However, when one of the Y1B-17s survived an inadvertent violent spin during a flight in a thunderhead, Army Air Corps leaders decided that there would be no need for static testing. Instead, it was used as a testbed for improving engine performance. After studying a variety of configurations, use of a ventral-nacelle-mount turbocharger was chosen for each of its four engines. A successive series of General Electric-manufactured turbochargers would equip B-17s as standard items, starting with the first production model, allowing it to fly higher and faster than the Y1B-17. When testing was completed, the Y1B-17A was reconfigured as a B-17A.

==B-17B==

The B-17B (299M) was the first production model of the B-17 and was essentially a B-17A with a slightly larger rudder, larger flaps, a redesigned nose and R-1820-51 engines. The small, globe-like, machine gun turret used in the Y1B-17&#x27;s upper nose blister was replaced with a machine gun, its barrel run through a ball-socket in the heavily framed Perspex nose glazing. The Y1B-17&#x27;s separate triangular-shaped bombardier&#x27;s aiming window, located further back in the lower nose in an indent, was eliminated, and was replaced with a framed window panel in the lower portion of the nose glazing. All B-17B aircraft were later modified at Boeing, being brought up to the B-17C/D production standard. While the new nose glazing still used only a single caliber machine gun, two additional ball-sockets were installed in the nose, one in the upper left panel and another in a lower right. This configuration was continued up through the B-17E series. During Army Air Corps service, the bulged teardrop-shaped machine gun blisters were replaced with flush-mounted Perspex side windows of the same type used in the B-17C/D series. Various aircraft had different levels of upgrades performed. Some of the &quot;B&quot; series Fortresses had only their bulged side blisters replaced with slide-out flush windows, while others also had their bulged upper blister changed to a much flatter, more aerodynamic Perspex window panel. In addition, some &quot;B&quot; series Fortresses also had ventral &quot;bathtub turrets&quot; (see the &quot;C/D&quot; section below) installed, replacing their lower, teardrop-shaped gun blisters.

Crew locations were rearranged, and the original pneumatic brakes were replaced with hydraulic brakes.

In October 1942 all in-service B-17B aircraft were redesignated RB-17B, the &quot;R&quot; indicating &quot;Restricted&quot; and these aircraft were now used only for training and transport duties. The &quot;R&quot; prefix designated combat obsolescence.

Many of these RB-17B aircraft, along with at least one still-airworthy YB-17, were stationed at Sebring Airfield, where the exterior scenes were filmed for the Warner Bros. war drama &quot;Air Force&quot; (1943), directed by Howard Hawks, and starring (among others) John Garfield, Arthur Kennedy, Gig Young, and Harry Carey. The film&#x27;s real star, however, was an RB-17B. It passed as a later model B-17D Flying Fortress, having had its machine gun blisters replaced and a lower &quot;bathtub&quot; ventral gun turret installed. Many of these aircraft can be seen in both ground and aerial scenes during the film.

The &quot;B&quot; series Flying Fortress first flew on 27 June 1939. Thirty nine were built in a single production run, but Army Air Corps serial numbers were scattered over several batches. This was because of limited government funding: The Army Air Corps could only afford to purchase a few B-17Bs at a time.

==B-17C==
The B-17C introduced a number of improvements over the B-17B, including more powerful Wright R-1820-65 engines. To improve crew safety, the waist-mounted machine gun blisters were replaced with teardrop-shaped, slide-out Perspex window panels flush with the fuselage, and the ventral blister was replaced by a lower metal gondola housing dubbed a &quot;bathtub turret&quot;. The most important additions made to the &quot;C&quot; series were self-sealing fuel tanks and armor plate.

The first of the B-17C series flew in July 1940, with 38 being built. The 18 remaining in Army Air Forces service, after 20 had been transferred to the RAF, were upgraded to the B-17D configuration, although one of these crashed on a ferry flight in the US.

===Fortress Mk.I===
With the passage of the Lend-lease Act in 1941, the Royal Air Force requested B-17s. At that time, the US Army Air Corps was suffering from shortages, but supplied 20 to the RAF. Though the Air Corps hadn&#x27;t cleared the B-17 for combat, they were desperately needed in Britain. The 20 ferried bombers were production B-17Cs (company designation Model 299T), designated Fortress Mk I by the RAF. The aircraft&#x27;s single .30 caliber nose-mounted machine guns were replaced with Brownings.

Following delivery, the 20 Fortress Mk.Is went almost immediately into frontline service, however they performed poorly. By September 1941, 39 sorties had only resulted in 22 missions, with nearly half of the sorties aborted due to mechanical and electrical problems. Eight of the 20 aircraft had been destroyed by September, half to accidents. Their guns froze-up at altitude and were unable to protect the Fortresses from attack and their effectiveness as bombers was also limited, largely because of problems with achieving an adequate level of bombing accuracy.

==B-17D==
Though changes in the design made the Army Air Force decide that the B-17D was worthy of a new sub designation, the B-17C and B-17D were very similar. In fact, both were given the same sub designation (299H) by Boeing.

Minor changes were made, both internally and externally. Outside, the engines received a set of adjustable cowl flaps for improved cooling, and the externally-mounted bomb racks were removed. On the interior, the electrical system was revised, and another crew position was added, bringing the total number to ten. In the aft-dorsal radio compartment was a new overhead twin-.50s machine gun mount; in the central-aft section&#x27;s ventral &quot;bathtub&quot; gun position, twin .50s were also added, as was additional armor plating. Nose gun ball sockets were added to the side windows for the first time, in a longitudinally staggered layout (the starboard ball socket was further forward than the port-side ball socket). The number of machine guns aboard brought the total armament to seven: one portable nose and six . The B-17D also featured more extensive armored plate protection. A total of 42 &quot;D&quot; series were built, and the 18 remaining B-17Cs were converted to Boeing&#x27;s new B-17D standard. The sole-surviving example of the &quot;D&quot; series (originally built in 1940 and nicknamed &quot;Ole Betsy&quot; by her original aircrew) is currently undergoing restoration at the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. This B-17D was later renamed &quot;The Swoose&quot; by her last pilot Col. Frank Kurtz, who after the war, kept the Fortress from being scrapped; he later named his daughter, actress Swoosie Kurtz, after the bomber.

==B-17E==

The B-17E (299O) was an extensive redesign of the previous B-17D. The most obvious change was the larger, completely new vertical stabilizer, originally developed for the Boeing 307 Stratoliner, and the addition of a tail gunner. Experience had shown the Flying Fortress was vulnerable to attack from behind. The redesign added a tail gunner&#x27;s position and a powered, dorsal turret located just behind the cockpit. Each of these positions were armed with a pair of Browning AN/M2 .50 cal. machine guns). Until these modifications, specific maneuvers were needed against attacks from behind, including yawing the bomber laterally, allowing the waist gunners to alternate bursts at enemy fighters. For better visibility the waist gunner teardrop sliding panels were replaced by rectangular windows. In the first production run, the ventral gunner&#x27;s &quot;bathtub&quot; from the B-17D was replaced by a remotely-sighted Bendix turret. It was similar to the one used in the B-25B through -D Mitchell bombers, but was difficult to use and was a failure in combat. This resulted in remaining B-17E (and following F and G) aircraft being fitted with a manned Sperry ball turret.

As many as 512 were built based on the USAAC&#x27;s July 1940 order for B-17s.) The B-17E production order was too large for Boeing alone, so Douglas and the Vega division of Lockheed joined Boeing in B-17 production. Boeing also built a new production plant, and Douglas added one specifically for building B-17s. One of the Vega-built aircraft was later converted to the XB-38 Flying Fortress, which remained a single prototype. 

Four examples of B-17Es still exist in museums, none of which are currently known to be airworthy.

===Fortress Mk.IIA===
In the middle of 1942, 45 B-17Es were transferred to the RAF, where they served under the designation Fortress Mk.IIA. Because of the shortcomings experienced with the Mk.I, the RAF did not use the Mk.IIA in its intended role but instead they were operated by the Coastal Command for anti-submarine patrols.

==B-17F==

The B-17F was an upgrade of the B-17E. Outwardly, both types were distinguished primarily by the extensively framed nose glazing on the &quot;E&quot; series being replaced with a molded, one-piece or two-piece all plexiglas nose cone on the &quot;F&quot; series and later. Fully-feathering paddle-blade propellers were also adopted. Many internal changes were also made to improve the effectiveness, range, and load capacity. Once placed in combat service, however, the &quot;F&quot; series was found to be tail-heavy. The combined weight, when fully combat-loaded, of the four rear gunners and their heavy .50 caliber ammunition, moved the bomber&#x27;s center of gravity rearward. This forced the constant use of the bomber&#x27;s elevator trim tab, stressing that component to eventual failure. In combat the B-17F also proved almost immediately to have inadequate defensive protection when being attacked directly from the front. Various armament configurations of two-to-four flexible machine guns were added to the plexiglass nose cone and side window positions (the starboard position was placed further forward). Late production &quot;F&quot; series aircraft received substantially-enlarged bulged &quot;cheek&quot; mounts for their .50 caliber machine guns, on each side of the nose. These replaced the previous side window-mounted .50s. These &quot;cheek&quot; mounts allowed for firing more directly ahead. An overhead astrodome was also added for the navigator on top of the nose.

The problem of head-on defense was not adequately addressed until the introduction of a powered, Bendix-designed, remotely operated &quot;chin&quot; turret in the final production blocks of F-series Fortresses, starting with the last 65 (86 according to some sources) B-17Fs built by Douglas, from the B-17F-70-DL production block — directly derived from its debut on the YB-40 experimental &quot;gunship&quot; version.

With reinforced landing gear, the maximum bomb capacity increased from to . Though this modification reduced cruising speed by , increased bomb-carrying capacity was favored over speed. A number of other modifications were made, including reinstalling external bomb racks, but because both rate-of-climb and high-altitude flight performance suffered, these were rarely used and were removed.

Range and combat radius were extended with the installation in mid-production of additional fuel cells in the wings. Called &quot;Tokyo tanks&quot;, nine self-sealing rubber-composition fuel tanks were mounted inside each wing on each side of the reinforcing joint between the inner and outer wing spars. With an extra to the available on the first B-17Fs, the &quot;Tokyo tanks&quot; added approximately to the bomber&#x27;s target capability.

3,405 &quot;F&quot; series Flying Fortresses were built: 2,300 by Boeing, 605 by Douglas, and 500 by Lockheed (Vega). This includes the famous &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;. 

Three examples of the B-17F remain in existence, including the restored &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;.

===Fortress Mk.II===
19 B-17Fs were transferred to the RAF, where they served with RAF Coastal Command as the Fortress Mk.II. 

==B-17G==

All changes made to the Flying Fortress were incorporated into the final production version, the B-17G. These included the Bendix remotely-operated chin turret, bringing the bomber&#x27;s defensive armament to thirteen machine guns. The waist gun windows were staggered to improve the gunner&#x27;s freedom of movement, another carryover from the YB-40 &quot;gunship&quot; variant. The earliest B-17Gs lacked the &quot;cheek&quot; machine gun mounts, as it was believed that the chin turret provided sufficient forward firepower; they were quickly reintroduced. In a reversal of the B-17F&#x27;s design, the starboard &quot;cheek&quot; machine gun mount was moved rearward and the port side mount was moved forward, just behind the edge of the bombardier&#x27;s nose glazing to avoid interference with the storage of the chin turret&#x27;s control yoke when it was not in use. For late production blocks of the G-series, the tail gun turret was revised. Referred to as the &quot;Cheyenne&quot; configuration (after the modification center where it was introduced, the United Airlines Modification Center in Cheyenne, Wyoming), its guns were mounted in a new turret with a reflector sight and a much greater field of fire. Some 8,680 were built, and dozens were converted for several different uses:

* CB-17G: Troop transport version, capable of carrying 64 troops.
* DB-17G: Drone variant
* DB-17P: Drone director
* EB-17G: Engine test-bed, company designation Model 299Z. Two aircraft modified from Lockheed-built B-17Gs. Later redesignated JB-17G.
* MB-17G: Missile launcher 
* QB-17L: Target drone
* QB-17N: Target drone
* RB-17G: Reconnaissance variant
* SB-17G: Rescue version, later redesignated B-17H: Featured A-1 lifeboat under fuselage. After World War II, armament on the B-17Hs was removed; it was reinstated when the Korean War began.
* TB-17G: Special duty training version
* TB-17H: Training version of B-17H
* VB-17G: VIP transport
* PB-1: This designation was given to one B-17F and one B-17G. They were used by the U.S. Navy for various test projects.
* PB-1G: This designation was given to 17 B-17Gs used by U.S. Coast Guard as air-sea rescue aircraft.
* PB-1W: This designation was given to 31 B-17Gs used by the U.S. Navy as the first airborne early warning aircraft (AWACS).
* Model 229AB: Single B-17G converted as a VIP transport for Trans World Airlines.

===Fortress Mk.III===

Eighty-five B-17Gs were transferred to the RAF, where they received the designation Fortress Mk.III. Three were assigned to Coastal Command in the Azores and were fitted with radar before being reused by meteorological survey squadrons. 

The rest were operated as Fortress Mk.III (SD) (Special Duties) from February 1944 by two squadrons of Bomber Command&#x27;s No. 100 Group RAF, where they carried out electronic countermeasures to confuse or jam German radar in support of bombing missions. 

These carried an extensive array of electronic equipment including airborne Grocer air-interception jammers, the Jostle VHF jammer, Monica tail-warning receiver, Gee and LORAN for navigation, and an H2S radar which replaced the chin turret. They were also used as decoys during night bombing attacks. Fortress Mk.IIIs were operational until the units disbanded in July 1945.

==B-17H==
About 130 B-17Gs were converted for air-sea rescue missions for the USAAF, carrying an airborne lifeboat. Of these, twelve received the new designation B-17H, with five B-17Hs becoming TB-17Hs. The B-17H and TB-17H were redesignated SB-17G in 1948.
==XB-38==

The XB-38 was a modification undertaken by the Vega division of Lockheed on the ninth B-17E built. It was to test the feasibility of using liquid-cooled Allison V-1710-89 engines, if the Wright R-1820 engine became scarce. Completing the modifications took less than a year, and the XB-38 made its first flight on 19 May 1943. While it showed a slightly higher top speed, after just a few flights it had to be grounded due to a problem with engine manifold joints leaking exhaust gases. Following this problem being resolved, testing continued until the ninth flight on 16 June 1943 when the inboard starboard engine caught fire, and the crew bailed out. The XB-38 was destroyed and the project was cancelled. The gains in modification were minimal and would have been disruptive to the existing Flying Fortress production. Allison engines were also considered to be more badly needed for fighters.

==YB-40==
Prior to the introduction of the P-51 Mustang, a B-17 &quot;gunship&quot; escort variant called the YB-40 was trialled. This aircraft differed from the standard B-17 in that a second dorsal turret was installed atop the radio operator&#x27;s position between the forward dorsal turret and the waist guns, where only an upward firing single or double Browning M2 had been mounted; and a single machine gun at each waist station was replaced by a pair of guns, of basically the same twin-mount design used for the tail guns. In addition, the bombardier&#x27;s equipment was replaced with twin machine guns in a remotely operated &quot;chin&quot; turret directly under the bombardier&#x27;s position, augmenting the existing &quot;cheek&quot; machine guns; and the bomb bay was converted to a .50 caliber magazine. The YB-40 would provide a heavily armed gunship escort capable of accompanying the bombers all the way to a target and back. The aircraft was deemed a failure, however, because it could not keep up with standard B-17s once they had dropped their heavy bomb loads. It was withdrawn from service after just fourteen missions. (Twenty-six were built: one XB-40 prototype, 21 YB-40 pre-production aircraft, four TB-40 training aircraft.)

==C-108 Flying Fortress==

Four B-17s were converted to serve as cargo carriers and V.I.P. transports under the designation C-108 Flying Fortress. Many more served in the same roles under the designations CB-17 and VB-17, respectively. The first of them, designated XC-108, was a B-17E partially stripped of military equipment and outfitted for passengers. It served as a V.I.P. transport for General Douglas MacArthur. A similar conversion was made on a B-17F, designated YC-108. The third plane, designated XC-108A, was made to test the feasibility of converting obsolete bombers to cargo aircraft. The B-17E chosen for the conversion was based in India, where it ferried supplies over the Himalaya to the base for the B-29 Superfortress in Chengdu, China. It proved a difficult aircraft to maintain, due to lack of spares for the Cyclone engines, and was returned to the United States, where it was based in Bangor, Maine, and flew a cargo route to Scotland until the end of the war. It was sold to a local dealer for scrap, but the airframe survived, and is currently being restored in Illinois. A final aircraft was built under the designation XC-108B, and was used as a tanker to transport fuel from India to Chengdu.

==F-9 Flying Fortress==

Several B-17s were converted to long-range photographic reconnaissance aircraft, designated F-9 Flying Fortress. (The &quot;F&quot; was for &#x27;foto&#x27; and is not to be confused with the use of &quot;F&quot; for &#x27;fighter&#x27;.)

The first F-9 aircraft were sixteen B-17Fs, with bombing equipment replaced by photographic equipment. Some of the defensive armament was kept. An uncertain number of additional airframes were converted to a similar configuration to the F-9, but differed in minor details of their cameras, and received the designation F-9A. Some of these, along with more B-17Fs, received further camera alterations and became the F-9B. The final model was the F-9C, which was given to ten B-17G, converted in a similar fashion to the previous aircraft. Those surviving in 1948 were initially redesignated RB-17G (&quot;R&quot; indicating &#x27;reconnaissance&#x27;).

*FB-17: Post-war redesignation of all F-9 photo-reconnaissance aircraft.

==BQ-7 Aphrodite==
Late in World War II, at least 25 B-17s were fitted with radio controls as BQ-7 drones for Operation Aphrodite. Loaded with of Torpex high explosive and enough fuel for , they were to be used to attack Nazi U-boat pens, V-1 flying bomb sites, and bomb-resistant fortifications.

The BQ-7s would be taken up to by two volunteers before transferring control to another B-17 and bailing out while still over England. The controlling B-17 would follow the BQ-7, aim to at the target and set its controls for a collision course, before itself returning. The normal cockpit lost its roof and the fairing behind it was removed.

Because the remote-control hardware was inadequate, Operation Aphrodite was riddled with problems. Between August 1944 and January 1945, 15 BQ-7s were launched against Germany, but none hit their targets, and several crew were killed, many in parachuting accidents. One BQ-7 left a crater in Britain and another circled an English port out of control. The program was cancelled in early 1945.

==PB-1 and PB-1W==
The U.S. Navy (USN) received 48 B-17s towards the end of World War II, renamed PB-1 and used for maritime patrol missions. Post-war, the USN acquired 31 more B-17Gs, renamed PB-1W, and fitted with AN/APS-20 radar for Airborne Early Warning equipment and procedure development.

The Naval Air Material Center&#x27;s Naval Aircraft Modification Unit (NAMU) at Johnsville, Pennsylvania modified the B-17s to PB-1W specification by sealing up the bomb bay doors and installing 300 gallon drop tanks on each wing, in addition to the &quot;Tokyo Tanks&quot; mounted in the outer wings, holding a total of 3,400 gallons of fuel, giving the PB-1W an endurance of 22+ hours. Initially PB-1W&#x27;s retained the natural metal finish with a protective wax coat, but later the PB-1Ws were painted gloss Navy Blue overall.

The scanner for the one-megawatt AN/APS-20 Seasearch S-band Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), manufactured by Hazeltine Corporation/General Electric, was ventrally mounted in a bulbous housing below the redundant bomb bay, with the RADAR relay transmitter, Identification friend or foe (IFF), Radio Direction Finder (RDF), Instrument Landing System (ILS), and LOng RAnge Navigation (LORAN) also being installed during conversion.

The conversion introduced the following changes:

* Chin turret removed.
* Norden bombsight removed.
* Bombardier&#x27;s station retained as a lookout post, while on ASW or airborne search and rescue (SAR) missions.
* Top forward turret removed.
* Cockpit armor removed.
* 300 U.S. gallon drop tanks fitted under the outer wings.
* Extra fuel tanks in the outer wings (&quot;Tokyo Tanks&quot;).
* AN/APS-20 Seasearch S-band Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR), with transmitter in the fuselage and aerial in a bulbous di-electric fairing under the former bomb-bay.
* Modernized Identification, Friend or Foe (IFF).
* Radio Direction Finder (RDF).
* Instrument Landing System (ILS).
* LOng RAnge Navigation (LORAN).
* 2 RADAR consoles facing aft in the former bomb-bay
* Radio operator&#x27;s seat turned to face outboard.
* Waist gun positions and ball turret removed.
* Bench seats fitted for observers at the waist positions.
* Floating smoke markers carried.
* A latrine and a galley were fitted amidships.
* Tail guns and armor removed.
* Provision for spares and/or cargo to be carried in the tail section.

The crew for USN PB-1Ws consisted of six officers (Pilot in Command, Second in Command, Navigator, CIC Officer, and two RADAR Operators/Controllers) and five enlisted men (Plane Captain (now referred to as Crew Chief), 2nd Mechanic, Electronics Technician, and two Radio Operators).

First delivered to Patrol Bomber Squadron 101 (VPB-101) in the spring of 1946, the Navy was eventually to have twenty-two, out of thirty-one post-war B-17s, fully upgraded to PB-1W standard. Late in 1946, VPB-101 would move to NAS Quonset Point, Rhode Island, and be redesignated Airborne Early Warning Development Squadron Four (VX-4).

==PB-1G==

After the war, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) realized the need for a long range search and rescue aircraft to supplement its peace-time Sea Air Rescue (SAR) capabilities. Concurrently, the Army Air Force was retiring thousands of B-17 four-engine bombers, many still &quot;factory-new&quot; as they were delivered too late to see action. The USCG, always quick to take advantage of anything they could get inexpensively, requested that the Army Air Force loan eighteen of the bombers to the Coast Guard. The powerful, long-legged and stable bombers proved to be excellent additions to the Coast Guard&#x27;s aviation fleet.

The Army Air Force had developed a lifeboat that was slung underneath the fuselage of a B-17 that would be dropped to survivors in the water. A parachute rig would deploy from the lifeboat after its release and allow it to descend safely to the surface. The Coast Guard adopted the A-1 lifeboat for many of its PB-1Gs (the naval designation for the Flying Fortress).Furthermore the PB-1Gs were equipped with an ASV radar to assist in the SAR operations. Additionally, these aircraft were also used for the International Ice Patrol while another of the versatile PB-1Gs was modified to carry a nine-lens, 1.5 million dollar, aerial camera for mapping purposes. Interestingly, the Norden bombsight, used by the B-17s in their bombing campaign against Nazi Germany, was kept with this PB-1G and used to pinpoint targets for the camera.

In total 17 PB-1Gs served with the Coast Guard from 1945 through 1959. The final flight of the last PB-1G in USCG service ended at 1:46 p.m. on Wednesday 14 October 1959 when PB-1G 77254 landed at AIRSTA Elizabeth City. She had faithfully served the nation&#x27;s oldest continuous sea service for fourteen years. 
== Model 299J ==
The Model 299J was an unbuilt high-wing variant of the B-17 proposed in October 1938. It was to have been powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2180 engines and would have had tricycle landing gear. The 299J was expected to have a top speed of and a maximum takeoff weight of .

<text>Jonathan ben Joseph was a Lithuanian rabbi and astronomer who lived in Risenoi, Grodno in the late 17th century and early 18th century. Jonathan studied astronomy and mathematics.

In 1710 Jonathan and his family lived a year in the fields due to a plague at Risenoi. He vowed that, on surviving, he would spread astronomical knowledge among his fellow believers. After he became blind, he went to Germany, where the bibliographer Wolf met him in 1725. Jonathan authored two astronomical commentaries: the &quot;Yeshu&#x27;ah be-Yisrael,&quot; on Maimonides&#x27; neomenia laws (Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1720); and &quot;Bi&#x27;ur,&quot; on Abraham ben Ḥiyya&#x27;s &quot;Ẓurat ha-Areẓ&quot; (Offenbach, 1720).

<text>Daniel Leo Gallivan (April 11, 1917 February 24, 1993) was a Canadian radio and television broadcaster and sportscaster.

==Early life==
Born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Gallivan was an avid athlete and was a baseball pitcher on the St. Theresa&#x27;s parish team from Sydney that won the Maritime Intermediate Baseball Championship in 1937. Gallivan started the deciding game against the Pugwash Maple Leafs in the best-of-three series and pitched a three-hit gem while striking out 11 batters in the game.

In 1938, Gallivan was invited to a New York Giants training camp as a power pitcher, but an early injury to his arm ended any thoughts of a major league career.

Gallivan began his broadcast career at a local radio station in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, while attending St. Francis Xavier University. While at St. Francis Xavier, he was once roommates with Hollywood film director Daniel Petrie around 1940 or 1941. He taught high school algebra and Latin in Antigonish following graduation and took a stint in the Canadian Army before returning to continue his broadcasting career.

During the summers Gallivan worked in the blast furnace department of the steel plant at Dosco, a Sydney-based manufacturer of steel, coal and assorted products, to pay his way through school. His late father, Luke, was a Dosco employee for 58 years and was a foreman at International Piers, Sydney. Gallivan graduated from St. FX in 1942. Following overseas service with the Knights of Columbus Hostel Auxiliary Services in the war, Gallivan returned to Antigonish as a sportscaster for CJFX.

==&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;==
In 1946, Gallivan moved to a radio station in Halifax where he became sports director and voice of the St. Mary&#x27;s junior hockey team. He was spotted by a CBC producer of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; while in Montreal to broadcast a junior hockey playoff between Halifax and Montreal and was asked to fill in for a sick announcer in 1950.

In 1952, Gallivan began a 32-year stint with &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, mostly calling games involving the Montreal Canadiens, before retiring after the 1983–84 season. Immediately after Bill Hewitt was forced to retire in 1981, Gallivan motored to Toronto to announce mid-week Maple Leaf games during the 1981–82 season – he announced the night when Rick Vaive scored his 50th goal of the season, a first in Maple Leaf history. Gallivan did play-by-play for at least 1,900 regular season and playoff matches, including 16 Stanley Cup victories for the Canadiens. His colour commentator for 18 years was Dick Irvin Jr., from 1966 until his retirement in 1984. From 1980 to 1984, Mickey Redmond joined the pair as the third man in the broadcast booth.

On October 9, 1970, he had the distinction of announcing the Vancouver Canucks&#x27; first-ever game in the NHL, a 3–1 loss to the Los Angeles Kings on CKNW radio.

==&quot;Gallivanisms&quot;==

Gallivan was known for his colourful descriptions of action on the ice. Hard shots became &quot;cannonading drives&quot;; saves were &quot;scintillating&quot;, &quot;larcenous&quot; or &quot;enormous&quot; rather than merely spectacular, and after a save the puck tended to get caught in a goalie&#x27;s &quot;paraphernalia&quot; (goalie equipment). If the goaltender made a fantastic or impossible save, he would refer to it as a &quot;hair raising save&quot; or that the goalie &quot;kicked out his pad in rapier-like fashion&quot; to foil a &quot;glorious scoring opportunity&quot;.

He would use words such as &quot;anemic&quot; to describe an ineffective offence or powerplay. He also coined phrases like &quot;nowhere near the net&quot; when a shot would go wide, and commented that &quot;there has not been a multitudinous amount of shots&quot; to describe a game with a &quot;dire dearth&quot; of shots on net. Passes from the corner and through the crease area would always feature Gallivan shouting &quot;centred right out in front!!&quot;. Players were also known to &quot;dipsy-doodle&quot; with the puck or come out of their own zone &quot;rather gingerly&quot;.

Gallivan would comment that late in the game was an &quot;inopportune time&quot; for a team to take a penalty, would mention that a penalty killer was &quot;wasting valuable seconds in the penalty&quot; when he was ragging the puck, and would almost always announce, &quot;and the penalty has expired!&quot; at the end of a penalty.

When a university professor wrote to Gallivan protesting that there was no such word as &quot;cannonading&quot;, Gallivan wrote back: &quot;There is now.&quot;

The ultimate Gallivanism was another word he coined: the &quot;spinarama,&quot; which described a player evading a check or deking a defender with a sudden 180- or 360-degree turn. Its chief practitioner was Montreal Canadien Serge Savard so that the move was also known as &quot;The Savardian Spinarama&quot;. The Canadian Oxford Dictionary now includes an entry for &quot;spinarama&quot;.

==Later life==
Gallivan retired after the 1984 Stanley Cup playoffs when a severe illness rendered him blind in one eye. He was active in retirement, working with several charities, and was the recipient of several television/broadcast industry awards. He made a cameo appearance in the 1975 Canadian feature film &quot;The Million Dollar Hockey Puck&quot;. Gallivan also had a cameo as the voice of sportcaster Ferlin Fielddigger in the 1981 animated TV special, &quot;The Raccoons on Ice&quot;.

==Death==
According to a Canadian Press report, Gallivan died on Thursday, February 24, 1993 in his sleep at his Montreal apartment, where he lived alone. The obituary said heart failure, possibly brought on by bronchitis, was the apparent cause. He was 75 years old.

==Personal and legacy==
Gallivan was married to Mary &quot;Eileen&quot; Gallivan (née MacPhee, 1925–1981) of Prince Edward Island, until her death three years prior to his final year on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; in 1984. In the early 1940s, Eileen transferred from UPEI to St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish where she eventually met Gallivan. Together they had four children: a son Danny Jr., and daughters Pat, Paula and Susan.

In the mid-1950s, Gallivan was known to assist with the Department of Education&#x27;s Physical Fitness Division&#x27;s annual hockey school in PEI, along with NHL chief referee Red Storey and NHL star Buddy O&#x27;Connor.

Cape Breton University awards the Danny Gallivan Memorial Fund Bursary in his honour, and St. Francis Xavier University awards an annual scholarship in his name. The Danny Gallivan Golf Tournament was created by Gallivan, Red Storey and a group of Halifax businessmen 30 years ago to raise research funds for the fight against cystic fibrosis. It continues to be one of the longest-standing, and most successful fundraising events of its nature in Atlantic Canada. The Tournament has raised nearly $1,400,000 for cystic fibrosis.

==Tribute==
Upon learning of Gallivan&#x27;s death, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman issued the following statement, &quot;I join with hockey fans throughout the world, and particularly the millions in Canada whose lives were touched by Danny Gallivan, in expressing the NHL&#x27;s sadness at the loss of a broadcast legend.&quot;

<text>Eastern Provincial Airways (EPA) was an airline that operated in Atlantic and eastern Canada. At its peak, the carrier operated jet service with Boeing 737-200 aircraft connecting many communities that in the first quarter of the 21st century only have scheduled passenger flights provided by 18-seat commuter turboprop aircraft. The airline traces its history from Maritime Central Airways (MCA) from 1961. It merged with CP Air to form Canadian Pacific Air Lines in 1986.

== History ==
Eastern Provincial Airways began operations from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland in 1949 acquiring and reorganizing the Newfoundland Aero Sales and Services. Early air services, like those of MCA, included a mixed bag of ambulance and mail services, cargo, charters, and forest and ice patrols, but would evolve into a modern air traffic carrier twenty years later. The company was founded with a Noorduyn Norseman aircraft by Eric Blackwood, a bush pilot and Royal Canadian Air Force veteran from World War II. Blackwood had the backing of St. John&#x27;s businessman C.A. Crosbie.

The purchase of a PBY Canso amphibian aircraft in 1953 allowed EPA to take larger charter jobs, and a converted Canso allowed water-bombing flights on behalf of the government. In 1954, EPA moved its headquarters from St. John&#x27;s to the now bustling international aviation hub in Gander where EPA planes mingled with the likes of Pan American and BOAC en route to or from Europe. But EPA&#x27;s work still consisted mostly of a wide variety of government contracts. In Gander, EPA set up administrative offices and a maintenance hangar and with the addition of larger Douglas DC-3s and Lockheed Model 10 Electra twin prop aircraft, commenced regular passenger services between St. John&#x27;s, Gander and Deer Lake in 1955–56. In addition to regional charter work, international projects were operated as well, including a contract beginning in 1958 to do extensive work in Greenland with PBY Cansos and de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters for Greenland Air until July 1965.

===1960s===
In 1960, regular passenger services began to Wabush and Twin Falls in Labrador. Curtiss C-46s were leased for the routes with the first Handley Page Dart Herald twin turboprop aircraft being purchased in 1962. EPA was one of the few operators of the Herald in Canada and the type was never operated by any airline in the U.S. In 1963, EPA purchased Maritime Central and the two companies merged to form Eastern Provincial Airways (1963) Limited. The amalgamation allowed for a strong regional carrier to compete against government owned Trans Canada Airlines which later became Air Canada. According to the June 1, 1968 Eastern Provincial system timetable, the airline was operating all scheduled flights with 40-passenger Herald, 24-passenger Douglas DC-3 and 46-passenger Carvair aircraft with the latter being a converted version of the Douglas DC-4 which could transport either passengers or freight in an all-cargo configuration (the airline was operating both passenger and scheduled all-cargo flights with the Carvair at this time). This same timetable also includes charter information for a number of aircraft types operated by the airline in 1968, including not only the Herald, DC-3 and Carvair but also the four-passenger Beechcraft Baron, six-passenger de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, eight-passenger de Havilland Canada DHC-2T Turbo Beaver (which was a turboprop conversion of the original piston engine Beaver) and the ten-passenger de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter.

The mixed-bag operation continued until 1970. The 1960s saw EPA operate a varied fleet of 36 aircraft, including four Handley Page Heralds, six PBY Cansos, two Curtiss C-46s, two Sikorsky S-55 helicopters, one Douglas DC-4, five DC-3 workhorses, and the other smaller aircraft types mentioned above. The airline had a distinguished decade with work in India and Pakistan and they enjoyed the novelty of being the first Canadian airline in the new Soviet bloc Eastern Europe when EPA operated a cargo charter into Czechoslovakia.

===1970s===
By 1970, EPA had started to resemble a modern airline. That year, EPA&#x27;s bush operations were sold to some senior staff as a separate airline - Labrador Airways, now Air Labrador.

EPA decided to standardize with Boeing 737-200 jetliners in the 1970s. The airline acquired seven of the jets from Boeing. The same colour scheme that EPA developed in the 1960s was adopted. They were painted white with a silver belly and an orange stripe along the window line. The orange gander logo was put on the tail, and the nose cone was painted black. Inside, passengers sat in flower patterned seats of various colours of purple, orange, and yellow - fashionable colours in the 1970s.

EPA expressed an intent in the early 1970s to have an all-jet fleet as soon as practically possible. As it turned out, this was never to happen. EPA entered the decade with three Handley Page Heralds and two DC-3s. The Heralds were responsible for flights into Iles-de-la-Madeleine, Quebec and Charlo, Chatham and Fredericton, New Brunswick until 1974 when they were sold to British Air Ferries. EPA started jet service into the northern New Brunswick cities while a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 twin turboprop was acquired to replace the Heralds on the flights to Iles-de-la-Madeleine.

1972 and 1973 were good years for EPA. The number of passengers carried grew dramatically every year from 1969 until 1973. The company expanded, starting jet services into Saint John and Fredericton (New Brunswick) and Stephenville (Newfoundland). New employees were hired and EPA was successful in obtaining a Foreign Air Carrier Permit for the United States. EPA had interest in Sydney to Boston and Halifax to Portland and Bangor (Maine), but these routes never materialized. Instead, the company began to fly charters to Florida and the Caribbean in 1974.

Negotiations were begun with de Havilland Canada and the Canadian federal government for a subsidiary carrier to operate using de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7 turboprops. The Canadian federal application for the new service was rejected two years later and although the company renewed the application in 1977, Atlantic Canada wouldn&#x27;t see Dash 7s until the mid-1980s when deregulation of the Canadian Aviation industry allowed for the Canadian Pacific feeder carrier Air Atlantic.

1975 was the first year EPA had a loss since entering the jet age in 1969. Over-capacity was partly dealt with by leasing 737s for six-month periods to Wien Air Alaska, Aloha Airlines, and Aer Lingus over the next couple of years. The airline&#x27;s DC-3s were operated on the Gander-St. Anthony-Goose Bay and Sydney-St.Pierre routes until 1975 when the St. Anthony service was taken over by another carrier and early in 1976 the St. Pierre route was upgraded to a Hawker Siddeley 748. The DC-3 were disposed of—the last piston engined aircraft in EPA&#x27;s fleet.

===1980s===
In 1981 and 1982, EPA acquired three more Hawker Siddeley HS 748s from Austin Airways, Ghana Airways, and COPA of Panama. These planes were used to feed jet services on flights from Moncton, New Brunswick, Charlottetown, Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon. In 1982 EPA set up Air Maritime as a wholly owned subsidiary to operate the 748s.

EPA&#x27;s headquarters were moved from Gander, now no longer a major aviation centre, to Halifax. This allowed EPA to make Halifax a hub of operations and when schedules were coordinated with CP Air in 1983, Halifax became the main point of transit for passengers connecting from points further west to various places in the Maritimes and Newfoundland. By that time, EPA flew throughout Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island as well as far west as Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto.

EPA introduced a new colour scheme in the early eighties as well. Gone was the orange, replaced by a more up to date large navy blue &quot;EPA&quot; painted on the side of an all white side with the white gander on a blue background on the tail. Inside the 70s flower print seats were replaced by a more subtle beige with blue and red triangles.

The 1980s and deregulation meant dramatic changes for Canadian airlines, including EPA. By 1984, EPA had entered into a strategic alliance with CP Air of Vancouver. CP lacked a Canadian route network east of Montréal and EPA&#x27;s Atlantic province network complemented CP very well with Toronto and Montréal acting as connecting hubs.

Soon afterwards, CP bought EPA and by 1986 EPA was no more as its operations were merged into CP Air. A new corporate personality soon was unveiled for CP with the resurrection of the Canadian Pacific Air Lines name and a modern blue, white and red colour scheme. Canadian Pacific later operated as Canadian Airlines International before being acquired by Air Canada.

<doc id="1293466" wikidata="Q801595" url="?curid=1293466" title="West Brompton station">
<text>West Brompton is a Grade II-listed interchange station located on Old Brompton Road (A3218) in West Brompton, West London. The station is served by the District line of the London Underground; the Mildmay line of the London Overground; and National Rail services operated by Southern along the West London line.

The station is situated immediately south of the demolished Earls Court Exhibition Centre and west of Brompton Cemetery in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The station&#x27;s location on the West London line forms a borough boundary and its tracks are shared between Kensington &amp; Chelsea and the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.

==History==
The West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR) was opened in the early 1860s. It joined the southern end of the West London Joint Railway at Kensington (Olympia) station with Clapham Junction station and ran through West Brompton although a station was not opened until 1866. The original station was designed by the chief engineer of the Metropolitan and District Railway, Sir John Fowler and thus has local railway associations that go back to 1838. The current Lillie (road) bridge dates from 1860 and is the work of Fowler. The soon to disappear Lillie Bridge Railway and Engineering Depot, opened in 1872, is close by. Other historic associations are with the Lillie Bridge Grounds, a noted 19th c. athletics, cricket, ballooning and cycling venue adjacent to the West of the station and Brompton Cemetery adjacent to the East. From 1887, the station gave access to John Robinson Whitley&#x27;s Earl&#x27;s Court exhibition grounds and from 1937 to 2014 it was the alternative access to Earls Court Exhibition Centre, now demolished.

On 12 April 1869, the District Railway (DR, now the District line) opened its own station adjacent to the WLEJR station as the terminus and only station on its extension from station (Earl&#x27;s Court station did not open until 1871). The original plan was to connect the DR to the WLEJR but this did not take place.

On 1 March 1880, the DR opened an extension south from West Brompton to . In 1906 a heat wave affected the railway such that one of the Underground&#x27;s electric rails was warped at the station; trains coasted over the affected track until it was repaired.

In 1940, during World War II, several WLL stations sustained bomb damage. Passenger services on the WLL between and were withdrawn on 21 October 1940. The Underground station remained in use and the WLL continued in use for freight traffic. The WLL station buildings and platforms were subsequently demolished.

Full passenger services resumed on the WLL in 1994, but it was not until 1 June 1999 that new Network Rail platforms were opened at West Brompton by the then Minister of Transport, Glenda Jackson. There is a commemorative plaque to this effect on the Western lift tower. The station design was by Robinson Kenning and Gallagher of Croydon. The lift tower design is an echo of the decorative brickwork by the 19th c. City of London architect and surveyor, John Young designer of the nearby Empress Place and Lillie Road terrace in Fulham. The works were funded by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea and the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham on whose border the station lies.

The Mildmay line platforms do not have a separate entrance and access is from the Underground station. The District line serves platforms 1 and 2 and the Mildmay line serves platforms 3 and 4. There is a fence between platforms 2 and 3, but they are on the same level and it is possible to pass directly between them.

There are lifts to both Overground platforms for wheelchair access, and this means there is also step-free access to the eastbound District line platform, but not the westbound one. The station is in a cutting that is covered at one end.

<doc id="1293469" wikidata="Q3343575" url="?curid=1293469" title="Nordair">
<text>Nordair was a Quebec-based airline in Canada founded in 1947 from the merger of Boreal Airways and Mont Laurier Aviation.

==History==
The airline operated from the 1940s to the 1980s. Initially, most of its business was international and transatlantic passenger and freight charters and other contracts. It also operated scheduled flights to a number of destinations in eastern Canada and the Northwest Territories. Nordair flew out of Montreal&#x27;s two airports: initially from Dorval Airport, now Montréal–Trudeau International Airport, and later from Montréal–Mirabel International Airport as this latter airfield did not open until 1975. It was headquartered in Montreal with operations at Dorval, Quebec and their head office at 1320 Boulevard Graham in Mont Royal.

Nordair was operating scheduled passenger services in July 1959 utilizing Douglas DC-3 and Douglas DC-4 propeller aircraft with routings of Montreal - Frobisher Bay (now Iqaluit) - Cape Dyer Airport; Montreal - Roberval - Fort Chimo (now Kuujjuaq) - Frobisher Bay; and Montreal - Quebec City - Roberval - Chibougamau.

The airline was still operating scheduled passenger flights 20 years later. According to Nordair&#x27;s July 1, 1979 system timetable and route map, jet service was being operated as far west as Winnipeg and as far north as the Resolute Bay Airport in the Canadian Arctic with a number of destinations in Ontario and Quebec in Canada being served including Montreal (via Dorval Airport), Ottawa, Toronto, Quebec City, Hamilton, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario as well as Pittsburgh in the United States, primarily with Boeing 737-200 jetliners but also with Fairchild Hiller FH-227 turboprop aircraft. The airline was also operating scheduled passenger flights in 1975 with Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprop aircraft primarily to destinations in Quebec. Nordair was continuing to operate scheduled passenger flights in 1986 primarily with Boeing 737-200 jets.
===Introduction of Boeing 737 jet aircraft===

The airline was operating Boeing 737-200 passenger jet service in 1969 in both scheduled and charter operations according to the June 15, 1970 Nordair system timetable which contained the following marketing message concerning its leisure charter flights: &quot;SUNNY HOLIDAYS - BLUE TAIL JET CHARTER FLIGHTS TO THE SUN...BARBADOS - JAMAICA - BAHAMAS - FLORIDA - MEXICO&quot;. This same timetable also lists scheduled passenger service operated by Nordair with the Boeing 737-200 between Montreal Dorval and Fort Chimo (now Kuujjuaq), Frobisher Bay (now Iqaluit), Great Whale (now Kuujjuarapik), Hamilton and Resolute.

===Merger and aftermath===

Nordair was purchased by Canadian Pacific Air Lines which had operated as CP Air. On March 27, 1987, Pacific Western Airlines purchased Canadian Pacific Air Lines and then emerged as Canadian Airlines. The jet operation was absorbed into Canadian Airlines, while the turboprop operations were absorbed into Inter-Canadien. In 2000, that airline was acquired by Air Canada.

Intair, a scheduled passenger airline that was based in Canada and operated jet and turboprop aircraft, used Nordair&#x27;s two letter &quot;ND&quot; airline code for its domestic flights in eastern Canada in 1989 until it ceased operations and went out of business.

Another company called Nordair Quebec 2000 Incorporated operated in 2000 as a domestic regional carrier and cargo operator in Quebec, but the licence and licence applications for the airline were suspended in 2006 by Transport Canada, and again the Nordair name disappeared from the airline industry

<text>Lynda Lopez (born June 14, 1971) is an American journalist and author based in New York City. She is also a co-founder of Nuyorican Productions, an American production company founded in 2001 with Benny Medina which became active in 2006 with the release of &quot;South Beach.&quot; Lopez has anchored numerous media platforms. In 2020, Lopez authored the book &quot;AOC: The Fearless Rise and Powerful Resonance of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&quot;, published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

==Early years==
Lopez was born in the South Bronx and raised in the Castle Hill neighborhood of the Bronx borough within New York City, to Puerto Rican parents Guadalupe Rodríguez, a kindergarten teacher, and David López, a computer specialist. She has two older sisters: Leslie Ann, a teacher, and Jennifer, a singer and actress. Lopez received her primary and secondary education while growing up in the Bronx. After graduating from Preston High School in 1989, she enrolled at the C.W. Post Campus of Long Island University, where she majored in broadcasting and communications.

==Career==
===Radio broadcasting===
Lopez started her radio broadcasting career at WBAB and WLIR on Long Island. She later worked for WXXP-FM, also on Long Island, as both Assistant Program Director and Music Director. She then worked as a DJ for WKTU in the 10PM-2AM timeslot. After working for five years in radio, she landed a position as entertainment correspondent for WPIX&#x27;s morning show.

Lopez was employed by WCBS Radio in Manhattan as a news anchor until August 2013, when she left to work for her sister Jennifer Lopez in Los Angeles. She returned to the station a year later, in the summer of 2014.

In February 2023, Lopez joined all-news WINS-AM/FM in New York City as midday news anchor.

===Television===
During the late 1990s and early 2000s, she worked as a VH1 VJ for a short time with Kane and Rebecca Rankin. In 2000, she hosted a special in which she interviewed her sister, Jennifer. The two discussed their childhood as well as Jennifer&#x27;s rising music career. Some of J-Lo&#x27;s music videos were played and her then-newest video for &quot;Feelin&#x27; So Good&quot; made its VH1 premiere during this special. During this time, Lopez was also the morning news entertainment reporter for the WB11 in New York City, WPIX.

In 2002, she became the host of Style Network&#x27;s &quot;GLOW&quot;, a cable TV show dealing with women&#x27;s beauty issues, while working as an entertainment reporter at the same time. Lopez reported the latest entertainment news and stories on WNBC-TV, cable entertainment TV program &quot;E! News Live&quot;, and Spanish-language WNJU.

In 2003, Lopez became a DJ for WNEW-FM, with her boyfriend at the time, Chris Booker, a New York disc jockey and correspondent for &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. In October 2003, she joined WCBS-TV as a part-time correspondent, after their show was canceled at WNEW-FM. In August 2004, Lopez was named anchor of WCBS&#x27; weekend morning show, making this her first news-anchor job. For unknown reasons, she had not been presented on-air television since early April 2006, and she officially left the employ of WCBS-TV in June 2006.

===Co-anchor===
On July 29, 2006, Lopez debuted as the weekend co-anchor (with Mike Gilliam) on the News Corp-owned WWOR-TV&#x27;s &quot;My 9 Weekend News at 10&quot;. They replaced the team of Cathleen Trigg, who departed the station, and Rolland Smith, who retired. Lopez moved to WNYW-TV&#x27;s &quot;Good Day New York&quot; in 2007 and anchored &quot;Fox 5 Live&quot; at 11am. Reid Lamberty joined her as co-anchor for the 5am hour and 11am hour on FOX 5. Lopez was replaced from WNYW-TV&#x27;s &quot;Good Day New York&quot; by former &quot;CNN Headline News&quot; anchor Christina Park, and after returning to WWOR and her previous role she left television news altogether after the station ended weekend newscasts.

==Awards and recognition==
She won a 2001 New York Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Morning News Program as a co-host for WB 11 Morning News.

==Personal life==
Lopez was in a relationship with radio/television personality Chris Booker. They met in early 2002 at WNEW-FM in New York City, where they worked as co-hosts for the morning show. The couple separated in early 2005. 

In 2008, Lopez had a daughter with her boyfriend Adam Goldfried. She and Goldfried subsequently separated.
