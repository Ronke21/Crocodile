<text>The Adventures of Superman is a long-running radio serial that originally aired from 1940 to 1951 featuring the DC Comics character Superman.

The serial came to radio as a syndicated show on New York City&#x27;s WOR on February 12, 1940. On Mutual, it was broadcast from August 31, 1942, to February 4, 1949, as a 15-minute serial, running three or, usually, five times a week. From February 7 to June 24, 1949, it ran as a thrice-weekly half-hour show. The series shifted to ABC Saturday evenings on October 29, 1949, and then returned to afternoons twice a week on June 5, 1950, continuing on ABC until March 1, 1951. In all, 2,088 original episodes of &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; aired on American radio.

==History==
Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the Man of Steel first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 in 1938. The following year, the newspaper comic strip began and four audition radio programs were prepared to sell &quot;Superman&quot; as a radio series. When Superman was first heard on radio less than two years after the comic book appearance, the character took on an added dimension with Bud Collyer in the title role. During World War II and the post-war years, the juvenile adventure radio serial, sponsored by Kellogg&#x27;s Pep, was a huge success, with many listeners following the quest for &quot;truth and justice&quot; in the daily radio broadcasts, the comic book stories and the newspaper comic strip. Airing in the late afternoon (variously at 5:15pm, 5:30pm and 5:45pm), the radio serial engaged its young after-school audience with its exciting and distinctive opening, which changed slightly as the series progressed. Most familiar today is the television opening, which copied the radio opening from 1945 onward (save for &quot;and the American Way&quot; line, which was an even later addition), but the most often heard radio opening through the mid-1940s was:


By September 5, 1945, the opening (repeated at the close) had morphed into:
===Narrative notes===
In the first few episodes, Superman&#x27;s home planet of Krypton is located on the far side of the sun, as opposed to a distant star system as it is in most stories. During the journey to Earth, baby Kal-El grows into an adult and emerges fully grown from his ship after it lands on Earth. He is never adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent and immediately begins his superhero career. This was eventually retconned in later episodes to match the narrative of the comic books.

This serial introduced the fictional mineral kryptonite, the radiation from which can weaken and even (in some continuities) kill Superman. Aside from giving Superman&#x27;s foes a plausible way to fight him, it also allowed Superman&#x27;s voice actor to take the occasional break: Superman would spend the next episode incapacitated, his groans voiced by a substitute actor.

==Ratings==
In January 1945, the show was listened to on 3.1% of radios. In January 1946, it was listened to on 4.4% of radios.

==Jackson Beck==
That well-known signature opening, one of the most famous in radio history, was delivered by Jackson Beck, the announcer-narrator for the program from 1943 to 1950. He also had recurring roles, voicing an occasional tough guy and also portraying Beany Martin, the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;&#x27;s teenage copy boy. On &quot;Superman&quot; episodes featuring Batman, he played Bruce Wayne&#x27;s butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Decades later, Beck portrayed Perry White, Clark Kent&#x27;s boss, in Filmation&#x27;s &quot;The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1966–1970), in addition to serving as the show&#x27;s narrator.

==Bud Collyer==
Just as Superman&#x27;s true identity remained a secret, the identity of radio actor Collyer also remained a secret from 1940 until 1946, when the character of Superman was used in a promotional campaign for racial and religious tolerance and Collyer did a &quot;Time&quot; magazine interview about that campaign.

Since there were no reruns at that time, the series often used plot devices and plot twists to allow Collyer to have vacation time. Kryptonite allowed Superman to be incapacitated and incoherent with pain while the secondary characters took the focus instead. At other times, Batman (Stacy Harris) and Robin (Ronald Liss) appeared on the program in Superman&#x27;s absence.

The scripts by B. P. Freeman and Jack Johnstone were directed by Robert and Jessica Maxwell, George Lowther, Allen Ducovny and Mitchell Grayson. Sound effects were created by Jack Keane, Al Binnie, Keene Crockett and John Glennon.

Many aspects associated with Superman, such as kryptonite, originated on radio, as did certain characters, including &quot;Daily Planet&quot; editor Perry White, copy boy Jimmy Olsen and police inspector Bill Henderson. On March 2, 1945, Superman met Batman and Robin for the first time.

Paramount&#x27;s animated &quot;Superman&quot; short films used voices by the radio actors, and Columbia&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; movie serials (1948, 1950) were &quot;adapted from the Superman radio program broadcast on the Mutual Network&quot;.

==&quot;Clan of the Fiery Cross&quot;==
In 1946, the series delivered a powerful blow against the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s prospects in the northern United States. Stetson Kennedy, a human rights activist, infiltrated the KKK and other white supremacist terrorist groups. Concerned that the organization had links to the government and police forces, Kennedy decided to use its findings to strike at the Klan in a different way. He contacted the &quot;Superman&quot; producers and proposed a story where the superhero battles the Klan. Looking for new villains, the producers eagerly agreed. Kennedy provided information, including details of Klan rituals and the like to the writers. The result was a series of episodes, &quot;Clan of the Fiery Cross&quot;, in which Superman took on the Klan. The trivialization of the Klan&#x27;s rituals and natures had a negative impact on Klan recruiting and membership numbers.

Reportedly, Klan leaders denounced the show and called for a boycott of Kellogg&#x27;s products. However, the story arc earned spectacular ratings, making &quot;Superman&quot; the most highly rated kids&#x27; radio program, and the food company stood by its support of the show.

Superman historian Michael Hayde has cast doubt on whether actual KKK codewords and details were broadcast in the Clan of the Fiery Cross story arc. He wrote: &quot;[O]ne is hard pressed to uncover anything that might be construed as proprietary to the KKK, with the exception of one – and &quot;only&quot; one – sequence, heard in episode #2&quot;.

The story-arc was loosely adapted for a DC Comics limited series, &quot;Superman Smashes the Klan&quot; by Gene Luen Yang, and was released in October 2019.

==Stories==
The syndicated series, titled simply &quot;Superman&quot;, first aired via pre-recorded transcription disks over 11 stations beginning on February 12, 1940, with an origin story, &quot;The Baby from Krypton&quot;. The series aired in 15-minute episodes three times a week until May 9, 1941, with the conclusion of the &quot;Nitrate Shipment&quot; storyline. By that time, it had expanded to 63 stations.

In June, the Mutual Network discovered it would be losing its #1 juvenile show, &quot;Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy&quot; to NBC&#x27;s Blue Network at the end of August. To counter, MBS decided to revive the show, now officially titled &quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot;, on August 31, 1942. The new series aired live, five days a week. The revival began with two individual episodes, and then returned to the cliffhanger serial format.

The stories were of varying lengths—some stories were only five parts, while others could go into the dozens. Some of the longer stories include &quot;Looking for Kryptonite&quot; (25 episodes), &quot;The Hate Mongers&#x27; Organization&quot; (25 episodes) and &quot;Superman vs Kryptonite&quot; (33 episodes).

<doc id="1271872" wikidata="Q1448714" url="?curid=1271872" title="New Beginning (Tracy Chapman album)">
<text>New Beginning is the fourth album by singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, released in 1995. According to Nielsen Soundscan, it is her biggest-selling recording since 1991, with 3.8 million copies sold, and according to the RIAA, it has shipped five million copies in the United States.

The album&#x27;s sound consists of Chapman&#x27;s trademark acoustic folk-rock sound and is mainly made up of slow low-key tunes and a few upbeat tracks. One notable exception is the hit &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot;, which is a blues piece. Chapman earned the Grammy Award for Best Rock Song for the track, and it was also nominated for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1997.

Aside from the single “Give Me One Reason”, all of the songs are at least 4:56. The song &quot;Unsung Psalm&quot; was originally written and recorded for this album, but was cut. It was later included on her 2000 album &quot;Telling Stories&quot;. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, the &quot;New Beginning&quot; single was the first disc to have a sticker printed on the back of the packaging detailing system requirements to play the multi-media footage.

The use of a didgeridoo in the &quot;New Beginning&quot; track was a source of controversy. Chapman was taught to play at the Didgeridoo University in Alice Springs; however, the use of a didgeridoo by women is taboo in many aboriginal nations. The album also featured an extensive use of backup singers, which was very rare in Chapman&#x27;s earlier works.

<doc id="1271875" wikidata="Q75905" url="?curid=1271875" title="Pagsanjan">
<text>Pagsanjan (pronounced &quot;PAG-sang-han&quot;), officially the Municipality of Pagsanjan (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 44,327 people.

Pagsanjan is the tourist capital of Laguna and is the home of the Bangkero Festival held every March. The &quot;bangkeros&quot; are tour guides who steer boats along the river to Pagsanjan Falls (also called Magdapio Falls), for which the town is well known but is actually in neighboring Cavinti.

Pagsanjan was the capital of the province of Laguna for 170 years (1688–1858) during which the town prospered as the commercial, cultural and learning center of the province.

==Etymology==
Pagsanjan is located in the riparian delta formed by the confluence of the Balanac and Bumbungan rivers. Originally called &quot;Pinágsangahán&quot; (&quot;branching&quot; or &quot;juncture&quot;), this was shortened to &quot;Pagsanjan&quot; by early Spanish colonists because they found the name very difficult to pronounce.

==History==

Pagsanjan was originally a &quot;barrio&quot; of Lumban. In 1668, eight Japanese and Chinese traders, who were highly impressed by the strategic location of the barrio at the juncture of Balanac and Bumbungan, rivers founded the town. They established a trading settlement and engaged in the betel nut industry. In time, the barrio became the flourishing trading center of eastern Laguna and attracted families from the surrounding communities of Cavinti and Pila. On December 12, 1668, then-Governor-General Juan Manuel de la Peña Bonifaz issued a decree elevating its status to a town. In 1688, Pagsanjan replaced Bay as the capital of the province. It remained such until 1858, during which it bloomed as the cultural and commercial center of the province.

<doc id="1271885" wikidata="Q50892" url="?curid=1271885" title="WrestleMania X-Seven">
<text>WrestleMania X-Seven (also known as WrestleMania 17) was the 17th annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It took place on April 1, 2001, at the Reliant Astrodome in Houston, Texas. It was the first WrestleMania held in the state of Texas. Twelve matches were contested at the event, including one broadcast exclusively on the &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; pre-show.

The main event was a No Disqualification match between The Rock and &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin for the WWF Championship. The undercard included Triple H versus The Undertaker, the second Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the WWF Tag Team Championship and a Street Fight between Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon with Mick Foley as special guest referee. This was the first WrestleMania debut of Paul Heyman, in which it was the only time on commentary.

A record-breaking attendance for the Reliant Astrodome of 67,925 grossed US$3.5 million. Many in professional wrestling considered WrestleMania X-Seven to be the pinnacle of the company&#x27;s famous Attitude Era, similar to how WrestleMania III was the pinnacle of the 1980s wrestling boom. The WWF bought out rival competition World Championship Wrestling (WCW) the week prior. In addition to its commercial success, the event has received acclaim from critics and fans, and is often regarded as the greatest WrestleMania of all time, and the greatest professional wrestling pay-per-view event ever produced.

== Production ==

=== Background ===
WrestleMania is considered the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF, now WWE) first flagship pay-per-view (PPV) event, having first been held in 1985. It has become the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of the WWF&#x27;s original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the &quot;Big Four&quot;, and was considered one of the &quot;Big Five&quot; PPVs, along with King of the Ring. WrestleMania 17, stylized as WrestleMania X-Seven, was scheduled to be held on April 1, 2001, at the Reliant Astrodome in Houston, Texas, the first WrestleMania held in the state of Texas.

===Storylines===

The event included eleven matches that each resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by writers of the World Wrestling Federation, while storylines were produced on WWF&#x27;s weekly television shows, &quot;Raw is War&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; along with its supplementary programs, &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; and &quot;Jakked/Metal&quot;.

====Major matches====

The main feud leading into WrestleMania X-Seven involved Stone Cold Steve Austin challenging The Rock for the WWF Championship. The Rock and Austin had fought for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania XV and in 1999. Austin earned his opportunity to compete for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania X-Seven by winning the 2001 Royal Rumble match when he last eliminated Kane, while The Rock became the first ever six-time WWF Champion when he defeated Kurt Angle at No Way Out. During their feud, Austin&#x27;s wife Debra, who was trying to get back into managing, was ordered by WWF chairman, Vince McMahon, to be The Rock&#x27;s manager against her wishes as well as both Rock and Austin&#x27;s. As a result, Austin would hold The Rock and McMahon responsible if any harm came to her. On the March 12 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, The Rock was placed in an overlong Ankle Lock hold during his rematch with Kurt Angle. When Debra went to check on The Rock, Angle also placed her into an Ankle Lock hold. Austin soon ran in to save her and knocked Angle out of the ring. Keeping to his word, he immediately gave The Rock a Stone Cold Stunner as punishment. The following week on Raw is War, during a handicap tag team match involving The Rock, Chris Jericho, Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit, and William Regal, Austin made his way down to the ring and ended up getting a Rock Bottom from The Rock in response to the stunner from the previous week. On the March 29 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Debra was relieved from her managerial role by Mr. McMahon after failing to prevent a brawl between The Rock and Austin.
Another major feud that was built up in the lead to WrestleMania was the one involving Vince McMahon and his son Shane McMahon. The feud started with Vince&#x27;s disapproval of Mick Foley&#x27;s job as then-WWF commissioner as well as Foley&#x27;s decision of holding a six-man Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon 2000, taking into consideration about the well-being of the wrestlers involved in the match. Despite his attempts Foley was given full support by Linda McMahon, Vince&#x27;s wife and the WWF&#x27;s CEO. Not pleased with this result, Vince immediately demanded a divorce from Linda. Shortly after Armageddon, secretly to Vince&#x27;s delight, it was revealed Linda was rushed to hospital suffering with a nervous breakdown. With Linda hospitalized, the Board of Directors appointed Vince as the new CEO of the WWF, allowing him to fire Foley as commissioner. With Linda in a coma-like state, Vince started to have a public affair with Trish Stratus. Vince&#x27;s daughter, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, was at first far from pleased about the turn of events. At No Way Out, Stephanie and Trish squared off, with Stephanie scoring the victory after a run-in by William Regal. On the February 26 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, however, during a match that placed Vince and Trish against Stephanie and William Regal, Stratus was turned on by the other participants in the match and had sewage dumped over her. In the following shows, Vince continued to demean Trish by having her do such actions as bark like a dog around the ring and stripping down to her lingerie. Despite this, Trish remained loyal to Vince and begged for his forgiveness. On the March 12 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot;, Shane McMahon made his return to the WWF. Angry with his father&#x27;s actions, Shane started to throw punches at Vince only to be stopped by William Regal. Shane explained his actions on the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; as a result of frustrations over the manipulation of his sister, his mother&#x27;s state and Vince&#x27;s treatment of Trish. On March 23, the WWF purchased the assets of their longtime rival promotion, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) from AOL Time Warner. With it, the purchase brought in an extra twist to the storyline. On the March 26 episode of &quot;Raw is War&quot; (which was held at Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio), Vince McMahon made a live speech that was also simulcast on the final episode of &quot;WCW Monday Nitro&quot; (which was held in Panama City Beach, Florida). In the speech, Vince announced that the signing was not final and that he wanted Ted Turner to come to WrestleMania to hand-deliver the contract for signing. He then promised that with the purchase he was going to bury his rival forever. However, Shane, who was at the venue for &quot;Nitro&quot;, interrupted the speech and said:

To make matters worse for Vince, Mick Foley appeared shortly afterward that night and revealed that prior to his firing, Linda had made multiple contracts for him to sign, one of them was for Foley to referee a match of his choice at WrestleMania. Foley then chose the match between Vince and Shane, which was designated a street fight.

====Undercard matches====
The secondary feud leading into the event pitted The Brothers of Destruction (The Undertaker and Kane) against Triple H and The Big Show. After defeating &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin in a Three Stages of Hell match at No Way Out, Triple H felt that he deserved to be in the WrestleMania main event having defeated everyone in the WWF, including The Rock and Austin. The Undertaker took exception to that and told him that Triple H had never defeated him. Before WrestleMania X-Seven, the two had never faced each other in a one-on-one match on a pay-per-view event. During his entrance for a Hardcore Championship match against Big Show, Triple H ambushed The Undertaker. Kane ran in and saved The Undertaker from a further attack but was met with his own ambush by The Big Show. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Undertaker tried to break into the limousine of Triple H and his wife, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, on arrival but ended up being arrested by the police. As a result, Kane requested a match against Triple H later that night but lost when Big Show interfered on behalf of Triple H. In retaliation, Kane interfered in Big Show&#x27;s Hardcore Championship match against Raven on &quot;Raw is War&quot;, helping Raven pin Big Show to become the new Hardcore Champion. The Undertaker&#x27;s arrest led to a restraining order from Stephanie. To circumvent this, the Brothers of Destruction interfered in Triple H&#x27;s match against Test, with Kane ordered to run after Stephanie. With Stephanie held at ransom by Kane on a balcony in the arena, WWF commissioner William Regal gave The Undertaker and Kane matches at WrestleMania against Triple H and Big Show respectively and The Undertaker told Kane to put her down. After being attacked during a Hardcore Championship title defense, Regal would later include Raven into Kane and Big Show&#x27;s match, making it a Triple Threat Hardcore match for the Hardcore Championship.

At the Royal Rumble, Chyna (kayfabe) injured her neck during a match with Ivory, causing her to lose the match and fail to capture the Women&#x27;s Championship. In order for Chyna to again challenge for the title, Ivory required the match contract to include a &quot;hold harmless&quot; clause, stating that if Ivory injures Chyna&#x27;s neck again, there could be no legal recourse against Ivory. In doing so, the contract also included a provision to ban Ivory&#x27;s Right To Censor (RTC) stablemates from ringside.

== Event ==
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, a &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; match was aired with Steve Blackman and Grand Master Sexay squaring off against X-Factor members X-Pac and Justin Credible. Near the end of the match, fellow X-Factor member Albert interfered by pulling Sexay out of the ring, allowing X-Pac and Credible to hit their X Marks the Spot finisher on Blackman for the win.

The first match of the event was the WWF Intercontinental Championship match between Chris Jericho and WWF commissioner William Regal. During the match, Regal exposed one of the top turnbuckles to throw Jericho&#x27;s shoulder into it before giving him a double underhook superplex. Jericho attempted the Walls of Jericho submission hold but had it reversed into a Regal Stretch. After Jericho managed to grab a ring rope to break the hold, he retaliated with numerous chops before throwing Regal into the exposed turnbuckle and finishing him off with a Lionsault to retain the Intercontinental Championship.

Tazz and The APA (Bradshaw and Faarooq) took on Right to Censor (The Goodfather, Val Venis, and Bull Buchanan) next in a short match that ended with Bradshaw pinning the Goodfather after a Clothesline from Hell.

The third match was the triple threat hardcore match between Raven, Kane and The Big Show for the WWF Hardcore Championship. Raven came out with a shopping cart full of weapons. Kane and Raven began fighting before Big Show made his entrance. During the match, the three wrestlers fought their way out of the ring and through the crowd into the backstage area. Big Show tried to lock himself, Raven and the referee in a security cage but Kane broke the padlock and afterward threw Raven through a glass window. Big Show and Kane continued to brawl ending with the two throwing each other through a wall. Raven tried to escape by driving off in a golf cart, but Big Show stopped him and caused him to crash. The golf cart also ran over some cords that allegedly almost knocked the power out of the building. Kane shortly followed with another golf cart, accompanied by the referee, and ran into Raven. The fight headed back into the stadium with Big Show attempting to press slam Raven off the entrance stage but both were kicked off it by Kane. Kane followed this with a diving leg drop off the stage onto Big Show, pinning him to become the new Hardcore Champion.

The fourth match was the WWF European Championship match between Test and Eddie Guerrero. During the match, Test went over the top rope but got his foot caught between the top two ropes, forcing the referee and Guerrero to have to untangle him. With the help of his fellow Radicalz members Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn, Guerrero hit Test in the face with the European Championship belt while the referee was distracted and pinned him to become the new champion.

The fifth match pitted Kurt Angle against Chris Benoit. The match started with mat wrestling between the two but Angle soon punched Benoit out of frustration and threw him out of the ring, so he could throw him into the broadcast table and the steel steps. Back in the ring, both men tried to submit their opponent using the other&#x27;s signature hold with Benoit using the ankle lock on Angle, and Angle using the Crippler Crossface on Benoit. Benoit eventually succeeded in forcing Angle to tap out to the Crippler Crossface but the referee was knocked down and did not see it. Near the end of the match, Benoit tried to pin Angle after a diving headbutt but was met with a two-count. Angle then quickly rolled-up Benoit, using the tights for leverage to win the match.

The following match saw Chyna challenge the WWF Women&#x27;s Champion Ivory. After an early bit of offense from Ivory, Chyna performed a Chynabomb and looked to have the pinfall, but picked Ivory up after the 2-count. Chyna then performed a gorilla press drop and nonchalantly pinned Ivory to win the Women&#x27;s Championship.

The seventh match was the street fight between Shane McMahon and Vince McMahon with Mick Foley as the special guest referee. Shane dominated his father during the earlier part of the match by attacking him with various weapons such as a kendo stick and monitors from the Spanish broadcast table. Shane laid Vince on said table and performed a diving elbow drop off the top rope but his sister, Stephanie, pulled Vince out of the way, causing Shane to crash through it. Trish Stratus came towards the ring, pushing Linda McMahon out in a wheelchair, and then slapped Vince, causing her and Stephanie to get into a fight that led them out of the stadium. As referee Foley tried to wheel Linda out to safety, Vince hit him with a steel chair, and then pulled Linda into the ring to make her watch as he beat down Shane with a garbage can. However, Linda stood up and low-blowed Vince, allowing Foley to recover and attack him. With Vince prone in the corner, Shane placed a garbage can in front of Vince&#x27;s face and hit a Coast-to-Coast dropkick, pinning his father to win the match.

The eighth match, dubbed &quot;TLC II&quot;, was the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the WWF Tag Team Championship between the Hardy Boyz, Edge and Christian and the Dudley Boyz, the defending champions. Respective associates of each tag team, Spike Dudley for the Dudley Boyz, Rhyno for Edge and Christian, and Lita for the Hardy Boyz, interfered during the match. With Spike (who had just taken a chair shot to the head from Lita) and Rhyno (who had already been dispatched by Jeff Hardy) both laying on two tables outside the ring, Jeff Hardy set up a huge ladder beside them and performed a Swanton Bomb onto them through the tables with most of his body landing on Spike, taking him out of the match. Lita was taken out of the match when Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley performed a 3-D on her. Jeff tried to unhook the belts but had the ladder beneath him pulled away by Bubba Ray, leaving him hanging in the air, and allowing Edge to jump off another ladder and spear Jeff to the ground at a height of 12 feet. Bubba Ray and Matt Hardy climbed the same ladder but Rhyno tipped the ladder over, sending Bubba Ray and Matt through four stacked tables at ringside and taking them out of the match. D-Von then set the ladder up again and attempted to grab the titles, but was held back by Edge. With Edge holding onto D-Von&#x27;s legs, Christian sat on Rhyno&#x27;s shoulders as he climbed up the ladder and unhooked the belts, making him and Edge the new Tag Team Champions. A total of 9 tables were destroyed in this match, and every performer involved except D-Von and Lita went through at least one table.

The ninth match was a gimmick battle royal, involving nineteen WWF alumni famous for their outlandish gimmicks. To further increase the nostalgia, former announcers &quot;Mean Gene&quot; Okerlund and Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan handled commentary for the match. The Iron Sheik won the match by throwing Hillbilly Jim out of the ring. In revenge for being eliminated, Sgt. Slaughter reentered the ring and put him in the Cobra Clutch.

The penultimate match was between The Undertaker and Triple H. For his entrance, Triple H had British heavy metal band Motörhead perform his theme song, &quot;The Game&quot;, live. The match started with the two fighting outside of the ring with Triple H quickly being put through the replacement Spanish announcers&#x27; table. Later on, referee Mike Chioda accidentally had Triple H catapulted into him and was then attacked by The Undertaker due to his dissatisfaction over a two-count. With Chioda knocked out, the two brawled outside the ring, through the crowd, and into the technical area. On top of scaffolding, Triple H used a steel chair to attack The Undertaker&#x27;s legs, but The Undertaker retaliated with a chokeslam off the scaffolding, followed by a diving elbow drop. Back in the ring, The Undertaker hit Triple H with a Tombstone piledriver and went for the pin but Chioda was still unconscious. Later in the match, Triple H tried to pin The Undertaker after hitting him in the head with a sledgehammer while in the Last Ride position but only gained a two-count. Triple H sent The Undertaker into the corner and stood on the second rope to hit him with more punches, but The Undertaker countered with a Last Ride, allowing him to pin Triple H and increase his WrestleMania winning streak to 9–0.
The final contest of the night was the WWF Championship match between The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin, which had a surprise no disqualification stipulation added just before the superstars were introduced. During the match, the two brawled inside and outside of the ring, with both men bleeding after hitting each other with the ring bell. The Rock attempted to place Austin in a Sharpshooter hold, but Austin reversed it into a Sharpshooter of his own. After The Rock reached the ropes to force a break, Austin applied the Million Dollar Dream, a submission hold best known from his former gimmick, The Ringmaster. Shortly after, The Rock used Austin&#x27;s own finishing maneuver on Austin by executing a Stunner. Vince McMahon then came to ringside to observe the match. When The Rock tried to pin Austin after the People&#x27;s Elbow, McMahon seized The Rock&#x27;s leg and pulled him off Austin, breaking the pin attempt. After chasing McMahon around the ring, Austin responded by using The Rock&#x27;s signature move, the Rock Bottom. Later, The Rock executed a Rock Bottom for a near fall. After The Rock attacked McMahon, he was given a Stunner by Austin for a near fall. After The Rock kicked out of the Stunner, McMahon handed Austin a steel chair to hit The Rock with at Austin&#x27;s request, revealing that Austin had sided with McMahon, a man he once considered his nemesis. With this, Austin turned heel. Austin attacked The Rock with the steel chair, hitting him sixteen times, before pinning him and becoming the new WWF Champion. The show ended with Austin and McMahon shaking hands and sharing beers.

== Reception and legacy ==
The event was met with universal acclaim from fans and critics alike. John Powell of Canadian Online Explorer&#x27;s professional wrestling section rated the event a perfect 10 out of 10 stars, with the main event between The Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin in a No Disqualification Match for the WWF Championship rated 10 out of 10 stars. The Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the WWF Tag Team Championship between The Hardy Boyz, Edge and Christian, and The Dudley Boyz also received a perfect 10 out of 10 stars, the Street Fight between Vince and Shane McMahon rated 7 out of 10 stars, the match between Triple H and The Undertaker rated 6 out of 10 stars and the match between Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit rated 8 out of 10 stars.

X-Seven was also awarded Best Major Show for 2001 by Dave Meltzer&#x27;s Wrestling Observer Newsletter. The Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the WWF Tag Team Championship between The Hardy Boys, Edge and Christian and The Dudley Boyz was also placed #5 on IGN&#x27;s list of Top 20 Matches in WrestleMania History and noted that the match included &quot;some of the most memorable bumps wrestling fans have ever witnessed.&quot; D-Von Dudley expressed his belief that the match should be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, stating: &quot;In my opinion, I think that we should — you know, the n.W.o got inducted into the Hall of Fame and those guys were already in it. How about a TLC induction? How about recognizing how special that match was? Because think about it, not only was the match special, but they actually named a pay-per-view after it. So, you know, it has some relevance to it to be special, so why not put that match in the Hall of Fame?&quot; Matt Hardy said it was his favorite career TLC match.

In 2013, WWE released a list of their &quot;15 best pay-per-views ever&quot;, with WrestleMania X-Seven ranked at number one. In 2019, Troy L. Smith of &quot;cleveland.com&quot; released a list of the &quot;50 greatest wrestling pay-per-views of all time&quot; from every professional wrestling promotion in the world, with WrestleMania X-Seven again ranked at number one.

The promotional match preview video package for the main event, set to Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot;, is widely considered one of the greatest wrestling video packages of all time.

== Aftermath ==
The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Austin and The Rock faced each other in a rematch held in a steel cage which Triple H entered the cage and teased a fight with Austin before turning on The Rock. For several minutes Austin, Triple H, and Vince McMahon triple-teamed the outnumbered Rock forging an alliance with Triple H and Austin called The Two-Man Power Trip. The Rock was written out of the WWF&#x27;s storylines with McMahon giving him a suspension. This allowed The Rock time off to begin filming &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;. The Rock returned on the July 30 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; and chose to fight for Team WWF over Team WCW/ECW. Three weeks later at SummerSlam, The Rock won his first WCW Championship by defeating Booker T. The Rock and Austin would face each other again at WrestleMania XIX in a rematch with The Rock winning.

Following The Rock&#x27;s suspension, Triple H&#x27;s feud with the Brothers of Destruction continued with Austin now on his side. On the April 5, 2001 edition of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Triple H challenged Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho for his title and after interference from Commissioner William Regal and his wife Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley defeated Jericho to win his third Intercontinental Championship. The feud with Undertaker and Kane was temporarily put on hold after Triple H and Austin entered a brief rivalry with the Hardy Boyz, which resulted in Jeff Hardy beating Triple H for the Intercontinental Championship the following week and Triple H promptly regaining the title the next Monday on &quot;Raw&quot;.

Meanwhile, the Brothers of Destruction defeated Edge and Christian to become the new WWF Tag Team Champions on the edition of April 19, 2001, of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in a no-disqualification match. Austin and Triple H decided to challenge Undertaker and Kane for their newly won titles, but due to some wrangling by Linda McMahon the match between the teams signed for Backlash forced the two to put up their singles titles against the tag team titles in a &quot;winner-take-all&quot; match. Triple H scored the pin after attacking Kane with his sledgehammer and the Power Trip became the second team in WWF history to hold both major singles titles and the tag team titles at the same time. The feud came to a climax at Judgment Day when Austin defeated Undertaker to retain the WWF Championship while Kane defeated Triple H for the Intercontinental Championship. The next night Austin and Triple H lost the tag team titles to Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit; during the course of the match Triple H tore his quadriceps tendon and would miss the remainder of the year, leaving Austin to feud with the tag team champions alone. The feud culminated in a Triple Threat Match at King of the Ring, where Austin pinned Benoit to retain the WWF Championship. Ten years later in 2011, Undertaker and Triple H would once again renew their rivalry, went on to face each other in a rematch at WrestleMania XXVII with The Undertaker defeating HHH via submission, to set his WrestleMania winning streak to 19–0. A year later, they faced each other a third time at WrestleMania XXVIII in a Hell in a Cell match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. The Undertaker once again won the match to extend his WrestleMania winning streak to 20–0.

Due to the acquisition of WCW, Vince&#x27;s feud with Shane would later spiral into The Invasion storyline that dominated the WWF in the latter half of the year. It consisted of WCW wrestlers &quot;invading&quot; the WWF&#x27;s televised shows in an attempt to &quot;take over&quot; the WWF. The Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion would also be involved with Stephanie as its new owner, merging WCW and ECW into The Alliance. Despite giving her own demands for a divorce shortly after WrestleMania, Linda would eventually reconcile with Vince in the wake of the Alliance&#x27;s threat to the WWF.

Shane McMahon&#x27;s next feud would involve Kurt Angle as he would crash Angle&#x27;s Olympic Gold Medal Ceremony reenactment on the May 21 edition of &quot;Raw&quot;. Angle was celebrating the return of his Gold Medal from Chris Benoit which he won back the previous night at Judgment Day. Shane mocked him while declaring the return of WCW, and he got an Angle slam for his efforts. Shane would return the favor on the June 11 edition of &quot;Raw&quot; with an assist from The Undertaker. The two would eventually meet in a streetfight at King of the Ring, which was the third of three matches for Kurt Angle on the night.

The other two matches were the Semifinals and Final of the King of the Ring tournament which Angle was the defending champion. He would lose to Edge thanks to interference from Shane. Following King of the Ring, Edge let success go to his head and this led to Christian becoming jealous of Edge&#x27;s success. They would break up on the September 3, 2001, edition of &quot;Raw&quot; following Christian&#x27;s loss to The Rock in a WCW title match. After a brief feud for the WWF Intercontinental Championship, both would go on to become successful singles wrestlers in their own right with Edge being best known as the &quot;Rated R Superstar.&quot;

This would be the only WrestleMania for Paul Heyman as a commentator. However, he has served in a variety of roles for the WWE for the better part of the time since, including creative team member and manager of his longtime friend and client Brock Lesnar.

<doc id="1271886" wikidata="Q6486684" url="?curid=1271886" title="Language Spoken at Home">
<text>Language Spoken at Home is a data set published by the United States Census Bureau on languages in the United States. It is based on a three-part language question asked about all household members who are five years old or older. The first part asks if the person speaks a language other than English at home. If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, the respondent is asked what that language is. The third part of the question asks how well the person speaks English (&quot;Very well&quot;, &quot;Well&quot;, &quot;not well&quot;, &quot;Not at all&quot;).

The three-part question was first asked in 1980; It replaced a question about mother tongue. In 2000, the language question appeared on the long-form questionnaire which was distributed to 1 out of 6 households. After the long form census was eliminated (after the 2000 census), the language question was moved to the American Community Survey (ACS). The language questions used by the US Census changed numerous times during 20th century. Changes in the language questions are tied to the changing ideologies of language in addition to changing language policies.

== Data published ==
The published data varies in the amount of detail provided each year. 

In 2000 and 1990, language spoken was a part of Summary File 3. For the 2000 census, data was published for 30 languages, chosen for their nationwide distribution, and 10 language groupings (see list below). Data from households which report languages other than the 30 are reported under the language groupings. Thus, languages which are widespread in certain areas of the country but not nationally get put together, even in block level data. Lithuanian, and Welsh are simply &quot;Other Indo-European languages,&quot; Yoruba and Swahili are simply &quot;African languages,&quot; and Indonesian and Hakka are simply &quot;Other Asian languages.&quot; Several locally very well represented languages, such as Punjabi and Pennsylvania German, are collated into smaller groupings. Native North American languages besides Navajo are also collated, though they are reported on several geographic levels in another data set. 

For the 2009-2013 ACS data, detailed information was provided on over 300 languages. In addition to the number of speakers reported for each language, the count of speakers whose English speaking ability is less than &quot;very well&quot; is also reported. 

Updated information is available via the Census Bureau&#x27;s American Fact-finder.

== Data usage ==
Statistics on English-speaking ability and language spoken at home are used by the Justice Department in the implementation of the Voting Rights Act and to allocate funds for to schools for programs for English Language Learners. Federal and local governments, as well as non-governmental and private interests also use these statistics.

<text>The 2004 Saxony state election was held on 19 September 2004 to elect the members of the 4th Landtag of Saxony. The incumbent Christian Democratic Union (CDU) government led by Minister-President Georg Milbradt lost its majority. The CDU subsequently formed a grand coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and Milbradt was re-elected as Minister-President.

==Outcome==
The most striking result of the election was the entrance of the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) into the Landtag with 12 seats. This gained international attention. The party&#x27;s support was concentrated in the rural areas; commentators attributed its success to alienation stemming from economic depression. The continuing strength of the SED successor party, the Party of Democratic Socialism, which again was the second largest party, was also notable.

The CDU remained the largest party with 55 of 124 seats, but lost its majority, forcing it to find coalition partners. The most logical was the classical liberal Free Democratic Party, who entered the Landtag in the election, but a CDU–FDP government would be one seat short of the necessary majority. Cooperation with the PDS or The Greens was ideologically unfeasible. A theoretical alliance between the CDU and NPD would hold a majority, but this was out of the question. The result was a grand coalition CDU and SPD. This government outcome was later mirrored in the 2005 federal election. The CDU&#x27;s Georg Milbradt remained in office as Minister-President. Notably, the NPD received two more votes on the ballot for Minister-President than it had members in the Landtag. It is presumed that two CDU Landtag members backed the NPD as a protest against the grand coalition.

<doc id="1271894" wikidata="Q7811483" url="?curid=1271894" title="Tobacco Road (rivalry)">
<text>Tobacco Road is a term used in college sports, mainly basketball, for the four rival universities of North Carolina that play in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The term refers to the area&#x27;s history as a major tobacco producer. The Tobacco Road teams represent the following universities: 
* North Carolina Tar Heels (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in Chapel Hill)
* Duke Blue Devils (Duke University in Durham)
* NC State Wolfpack (North Carolina State University in Raleigh)
* Wake Forest Demon Deacons (Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem)
North Carolina, Duke, and NC State lie in the Research Triangle and are separated by no more than 25 miles (40 km). Before moving to Winston-Salem in 1956, Wake Forest University was located in the town of Wake Forest within the Triangle region, to the northeast of Raleigh. The schools are historical and present powerhouses among college sports, especially basketball. The universities&#x27; proximity and membership in the ACC, coupled with their reputation for academic prestige and as hubs for research and innovation, has created a natural rivalry among students, fans, and alumni.

==Basketball==

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

These four universities are also known in the state as the &quot;Big Four&quot; and competed in the Dixie Classic men&#x27;s basketball tournament from 1949 to 1961, in which the four schools won all 13 tournaments played. They also played in the Big Four Tournament in Greensboro, North Carolina, from 1971 to 1981. The Wake–Duke rivalry is the oldest basketball rivalry among the four schools in that it dates back to the 1905–06 season and was the first intercollegiate basketball game in North Carolina. The Wake-Duke rivalry is just ahead of the more well known UNC-Duke rivalry in terms of games played by two games. The rivalries between the four schools also account for six of the most frequently played men&#x27;s basketball rivalries in the ACC. The four schools have a combined 13 men&#x27;s national basketball championships (UNC has 7 (6 NCAA), Duke has 5, NC State has 2). The four schools also won 2 NIT titles (UNC won 1, and Wake won 1). In the men&#x27;s tournament they have combined to have 11 runners-up (Duke has 6 and UNC has 5) and 39 Final Fours (UNC has 20, Duke has 16, NC State has 4, and Wake has 1). At least one Tobacco Road team has made the NCAA Tournament every year since 1974. Since the NCAA Tournament started in 1939, all four teams have missed the same tournament eleven times. The years in which none of the teams were in the tournament was 1940, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1958, 1971, and 1973. All four teams have made the same tournament 4 times (1991, 2003, 2004, 2005). Prior to the 2014 NCAA Tournament, at least one of the teams had made the Sweet 16 since 1979. 

Aside from the ACC Tournament, the four schools have only played each other in the postseason four times, only twice in the NCAA tournament. The first two times came in the NIT Tournament: Wake beat NC State in a semifinal game of the 2000 NIT Tournament and went on to win the tournament, and UNC beat Duke in a semifinal game of the 1971 NIT Tournament, also winning the tournament. The third time was UNC’s victory over Duke in the Final Four of the 2022 NCAA Tournament in New Orleans. The fourth time was NC State’s win over Duke on Easter Sunday in the Elite Eight of the 2024 NCAA Tournament in Dallas. 

Furthermore, in 1991 in Indianapolis, Duke and UNC came within one game of playing each other for the national championship. North Carolina lost 79–73 to Kansas, coached by former Tar Heel assistant and future head coach Roy Williams, while Duke upset previously undefeated UNLV 79–77 in a rematch of the previous year&#x27;s championship game, which UNLV had won by 30 in Denver.

The four schools have combined to win 71 men&#x27;s conference tournaments with 21 SoCon tournaments and 50 ACC tournaments (UNC won 26, Duke won 24, NC State won 17, and Wake Forest won 5). While in the Southern Conference they won or shared 17 SoCon regular season titles between the 1922–23 and 1952–53 seasons. They have also dominated ACC regular season play, having won or shared 52 regular season titles between them, including all but seven since the 1980–81 season.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===
While the women&#x27;s basketball teams have not been as successful, one team from the region has won the NCAA championship with North Carolina, who did so in 1994. They have reached the Final Four on three occasions, reaching in 1994, 2006, and 2007. They have won the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament nine times while winning the regular season title four times. Duke has made the NCAA Tournament Championship twice, losing in 1999 and 2006. They made the Final Four on four occasions (1999, 2002, 2003, 2006). They have won eight ACC tournament championships and twelve regular season titles. NC State has advanced to the Final Four twice, doing so in 1998 and 2024. They have won the ACC Tournament seven times and the regular season six times. Wake Forest has had the least amount of success, as they have only reached the NCAA Tournament on two occasions (1988, 2021). At least one of the four schools has made all but 10 of the 46 combined CIAW, AIAW, and NCAA tournaments since 1969, and all since 1980.

==Football==

Though the Tobacco Road rivalry predominantly relates to basketball, football between these programs is also competitive. As of the 2024 season, the four schools have combined to appear in 108 bowl games (Duke has 17, won 8; UNC has 38, won 15; NC State has 36, won 17; Wake has 17, won 11). They have also shared or won outright a combined 32 conference championships (20 ACC and 12 SoCon). Through 2024, NC State is the only school out of the four to not appear in the ACC Championship Game since the ACC adopted a divisional format in 2005. The format divided the four schools in which Wake Forest and NC State were put in the Atlantic Division, while Duke and UNC were put in the Coastal Division. Wake Forest and Duke were &quot;permanent cross-division&quot; rivals, meaning that they played every year regardless of division, as did UNC and NC State. The Wake–UNC and Duke–NC State games were played two of every twelve years, excluding additional matchups played as non-conference games. After the ACC divisions were abolished in 2023, a protected rivalry scheduling system was adopted. All four teams have the three other Tobacco Road schools as rivals, except Wake–UNC. In football, the four schools have produced 5 players and no coaches in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. They have also produced 15 players and 6 coaches in the College Football Hall of Fame. The oldest of the football rivalries between the four schools belongs to the UNC-Wake rivalry, which dates back to October 10, 1888 and was the first intercollegiate football game in North Carolina.

*The 2020 UNC-Wake Forest Game did not count as an ACC Conference Win
==Baseball==
In baseball, the four schools won a combined 15 ACC Baseball Tournaments (UNC won 6, NC State and Wake won 4, Duke won 1). In the College World Series, Wake Forest held the only national championship of any ACC school while a member of the ACC in 1955 until Virginia won it in 2015. Other schools have national championships, but all came before joining the ACC, or since leaving the ACC in the case of South Carolina. Wake was the runner-up in 1949, while UNC was the runner-up in 2006 and 2007.

==Soccer==
In men&#x27;s soccer, the four schools have won a combined four national titles (UNC has 2, Wake has 1, Duke has 1), three NCAA runners-up (Duke with 2, UNC with 1), 11 ACC Tournament titles, and won or shared 7 ACC regular season titles. Women&#x27;s soccer has produced much more success among the four schools. On the national level, they have combined for 21 national championships (UNC won all 21), six NCAA runners-up (UNC with 3, Duke with 2, NC State with 1). Tobacco Road teams have won 22 ACC tournaments since its inception in 1987. The years not won by a Tobacco Road team are 1987, 2004, 2011, 2012, and 2013. They have also won or shared 20 ACC regular season titles since 1987. UNC&#x27;s 21 national titles in women&#x27;s soccer are the most among Division 1 schools.

== Lacrosse ==
Only Duke and North Carolina currently compete in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, though NC State had a program in the 1970s and 1980s. The current two Tobacco Road competitors have had a significant presence on the national stage, as the Blue Devils have won three national titles (2010, 2013, 2014), while the Tar Heels lay claim to five (1981, 1982, 1986, 1991, 2016). Duke and North Carolina have met 81 times, with UNC leading the rivalry 44–37 through 2024. However, Duke leads the ACC and NCAA postseason series by records of 9–4 and 4–0 respectively. For further information, see Duke–North Carolina lacrosse rivalry.

==Overall team national championships==
As of 2020, the four schools have combined to win 73 NCAA team national championships in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports.

<text>The Performing Arts Training Center (PATC) was opened in 1967 in East St. Louis, Illinois by African American dancer Katherine Dunham who was then Artist-in-Residence at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville. Dunham partnered with SIUE&#x27;s Experiment in Higher Education to add educational resources to the program and give the youth of East St. Louis a better educational experience.

The PATC (later known as the Katherine Dunham Center for the Performing Arts) offered credit and non-credit courses in such arts as dance, martial arts, and crafts. At times, its company of dancers has toured widely. Now known as the Performing Arts Program, it is a part of SIUE&#x27;s East St. Louis Center,

<text>In mathematics, the projective line over a ring is an extension of the concept of projective line over a field. Given a ring &quot;A&quot; (with 1), the projective line P1(&quot;A&quot;) over &quot;A&quot; consists of points identified by projective coordinates. Let &quot;A&quot;× be the group of units of &quot;A&quot;; pairs and from are related when there is a &quot;u&quot; in &quot;A&quot;× such that and . This relation is an equivalence relation. A typical equivalence class is written .

, that is, is in the projective line if the one-sided ideal generated by &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; is all of &quot;A&quot;.

The projective line P1(&quot;A&quot;) is equipped with a group of homographies. The homographies are expressed through use of the matrix ring over &quot;A&quot; and its group of units &quot;V&quot; as follows: If &quot;c&quot; is in Z(&quot;A&quot;×), the center of &quot;A&quot;×, then the group action of matrix formula_1 on P1(&quot;A&quot;) is the same as the action of the identity matrix. Such matrices represent a normal subgroup &quot;N&quot; of &quot;V&quot;. The homographies of P1(&quot;A&quot;) correspond to elements of the quotient group .

P1(&quot;A&quot;) is considered an extension of the ring &quot;A&quot; since it contains a copy of &quot;A&quot; due to the embedding 
. The multiplicative inverse mapping , ordinarily restricted to &quot;A&quot;×, is expressed by a homography on P1(&quot;A&quot;):
: formula_2
Furthermore, for , the mapping can be extended to a homography:
: formula_3
: formula_4
Since &quot;u&quot; is arbitrary, it may be substituted for &quot;u&quot;−1.
Homographies on P1(&quot;A&quot;) are called linear-fractional transformations since

== Instances ==
Rings that are fields are most familiar: The projective line over GF(2) has three elements: , , and . Its homography group is the permutation group on these three.

The ring Z/3Z, or GF(3), has the elements 1, 0, and −1; its projective line has the four elements , , , since both 1 and −1 are units. The homography group on this projective line has 12 elements, also described with matrices or as permutations. For a finite field GF(&quot;q&quot;), the projective line is the Galois geometry . J. W. P. Hirschfeld has described the harmonic tetrads in the projective lines for &quot;q&quot; = 4, 5, 7, 8, 9.

=== Over discrete rings ===
Consider when &quot;n&quot; is a composite number. If &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are distinct primes dividing &quot;n&quot;, then and are maximal ideals in and by Bézout&#x27;s identity there are &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; in Z such that , so that is in but it is not an image of an element under the canonical embedding. The whole of is filled out by elements , where and , &quot;A&quot;× being the units of . The instances are given here for &quot;n&quot; = 6, 10, and 12, where according to modular arithmetic the group of units of the ring is , , and respectively. Modular arithmetic will confirm that, in each table, a given letter represents multiple points. In these tables a point is labeled by &quot;m&quot; in the row at the table bottom and &quot;n&quot; in the column at the left of the table. For instance, the point at infinity , where &quot;v&quot; is a unit of the ring.

The extra points can be associated with , the rationals in the extended complex upper-half plane. The group of homographies on is called a principal congruence subgroup.

For the rational numbers Q, homogeneity of coordinates means that every element of P1(Q) may be represented by an element of P1(Z). Similarly, a homography of P1(Q) corresponds to an element of the modular group, the automorphisms of P1(Z).

=== Over continuous rings ===
The projective line over a division ring results in a single auxiliary point . Examples include the real projective line, the complex projective line, and the projective line over quaternions. These examples of topological rings have the projective line as their one-point compactifications. The case of the complex number field C has the Möbius group as its homography group.

The projective line over the dual numbers was described by Josef Grünwald in 1906. This ring includes a nonzero nilpotent &quot;n&quot; satisfying . The plane of dual numbers has a projective line including a line of points . Isaak Yaglom has described it as an &quot;inversive Galilean plane&quot; that has the topology of a cylinder when the supplementary line is included. Similarly, if &quot;A&quot; is a local ring, then P1(&quot;A&quot;) is formed by adjoining points corresponding to the elements of the maximal ideal of &quot;A&quot;.

The projective line over the ring &quot;M&quot; of split-complex numbers introduces auxiliary lines and Using stereographic projection the plane of split-complex numbers is closed up with these lines to a hyperboloid of one sheet. The projective line over &quot;M&quot; may be called the Minkowski plane when characterized by behaviour of hyperbolas under homographic mapping.

== Modules ==
The projective line P1(&quot;A&quot;) over a ring &quot;A&quot; can also be identified as the space of projective modules in the module . An element of P1(&quot;A&quot;) is then a direct summand of . This more abstract approach follows the view of projective geometry as the geometry of subspaces of a vector space, sometimes associated with the lattice theory of Garrett Birkhoff or the book &quot;Linear Algebra and Projective Geometry&quot; by Reinhold Baer. In the case of the ring of rational integers Z, the module summand definition of P1(Z) narrows attention to the , &quot;m&quot; coprime to &quot;n&quot;, and sheds the embeddings that are a principal feature of P1(&quot;A&quot;) when &quot;A&quot; is topological. The 1981 article by W. Benz, Hans-Joachim Samaga, &amp; Helmut Scheaffer mentions the direct summand definition.

In an article &quot;Projective representations: projective lines over rings&quot; the group of units of a matrix ring M2(&quot;R&quot;) and the concepts of module and bimodule are used to define a projective line over a ring. The group of units is denoted by , adopting notation from the general linear group, where &quot;R&quot; is usually taken to be a field.

The projective line is the set of orbits under of the free cyclic submodule of . Extending the commutative theory of Benz, the existence of a right or left multiplicative inverse of a ring element is related to P1(&quot;R&quot;) and . The Dedekind-finite property is characterized. Most significantly, representation of P1(&quot;R&quot;) in a projective space over a division ring &quot;K&quot; is accomplished with a -bimodule &quot;U&quot; that is a left &quot;K&quot;-vector space and a right &quot;R&quot;-module. The points of P1(&quot;R&quot;) are subspaces of isomorphic to their complements.

== Cross-ratio ==
A homography &quot;h&quot; that takes three particular ring elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; to the projective line points , , is called the cross-ratio homography. Sometimes the cross-ratio is taken as the value of &quot;h&quot; on a fourth point .

To build &quot;h&quot; from &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; the generator homographies
: formula_6
are used, with attention to fixed points: +1 and −1 are fixed under inversion, is fixed under translation, and the &quot;rotation&quot; with &quot;u&quot; leaves and fixed. The instructions are to place &quot;c&quot; first, then bring &quot;a&quot; to with translation, and finally to use rotation to move &quot;b&quot; to .

Lemma: If &quot;A&quot; is a commutative ring and , , are all units, then is a unit.

Proof: Evidently formula_7 is a unit, as required.

Theorem: If is a unit, then there is a homography &quot;h&quot; in G(&quot;A&quot;) such that 
: , , and .

Proof: The point is the image of &quot;b&quot; after &quot;a&quot; was put to 0 and then inverted to , and the image of &quot;c&quot; is brought to . As &quot;p&quot; is a unit, its inverse used in a rotation will move &quot;p&quot; to , resulting in &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; being all properly placed. The lemma refers to sufficient conditions for the existence of &quot;h&quot;.

One application of cross ratio defines the projective harmonic conjugate of a triple &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, as the element &quot;x&quot; satisfying . Such a quadruple is a harmonic tetrad. Harmonic tetrads on the projective line over a finite field GF(&quot;q&quot;) were used in 1954 to delimit the projective linear groups for &quot;q&quot; = 5, 7, and 9, and demonstrate accidental isomorphisms.

== Chains ==
The real line in the complex plane gets permuted with circles and other real lines under Möbius transformations, which actually permute the canonical embedding of the real projective line in the complex projective line. Suppose &quot;A&quot; is an algebra over a field &quot;F&quot;, generalizing the case where &quot;F&quot; is the real number field and &quot;A&quot; is the field of complex numbers. The canonical embedding of P1(&quot;F&quot;) into P1(&quot;A&quot;) is
: formula_8
A chain is the image of P1(&quot;F&quot;) under a homography on P1(&quot;A&quot;). Four points lie on a chain if and only if their cross-ratio is in &quot;F&quot;. Karl von Staudt exploited this property in his theory of &quot;real strokes&quot; [reeler Zug].

=== Point-parallelism ===
Two points of P1(&quot;A&quot;) are parallel if there is &quot;no&quot; chain connecting them. The convention has been adopted that points are parallel to themselves. This relation is invariant under the action of a homography on the projective line. Given three pair-wise non-parallel points, there is a unique chain that connects the three.

== History ==
August Ferdinand Möbius investigated the Möbius transformations between his book &quot;Barycentric Calculus&quot; (1827) and his 1855 paper &quot;Theorie der Kreisverwandtschaft in rein geometrischer Darstellung&quot;. Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach and Julius Plücker are also credited with originating the use of homogeneous coordinates. Eduard Study in 1898, and Élie Cartan in 1908, wrote articles on hypercomplex numbers for German and French &quot;Encyclopedias of Mathematics&quot;, respectively, where they use these arithmetics with linear fractional transformations in imitation of those of Möbius. In 1902 Theodore Vahlen contributed a short but well-referenced paper exploring some linear fractional transformations of a Clifford algebra. The ring of dual numbers &quot;D&quot; gave Josef Grünwald opportunity to exhibit P1(&quot;D&quot;) in 1906. Corrado Segre (1912) continued the development with that ring.

Arthur Conway, one of the early adopters of relativity via biquaternion transformations, considered the quaternion-multiplicative-inverse transformation in his 1911 relativity study. In 1947 some elements of inversive quaternion geometry were described by P.G. Gormley in Ireland. In 1968 Isaak Yaglom&#x27;s &quot;Complex Numbers in Geometry&quot; appeared in English, translated from Russian. There he uses P1(&quot;D&quot;) to describe line geometry in the Euclidean plane and P1(&quot;M&quot;) to describe it for Lobachevski&#x27;s plane. Yaglom&#x27;s text &quot;A Simple Non-Euclidean Geometry&quot; appeared in English in 1979. There in pages 174 to 200 he develops &quot;Minkowskian geometry&quot; and describes P1(&quot;M&quot;) as the &quot;inversive Minkowski plane&quot;. The Russian original of Yaglom&#x27;s text was published in 1969. Between the two editions, Walter Benz (1973) published his book, which included the homogeneous coordinates taken from &quot;M&quot;.

<doc id="1271913" wikidata="Q823833" url="?curid=1271913" title="2002 Saxony-Anhalt state election">
<text>The 2002 Saxony-Anhalt state election was held on 21 April 2002 to elect the members of the 4th Landtag of Saxony-Anhalt. The incumbent Social Democratic Party (SPD) minority government led by Minister-President Reinhard Höppner was defeated. The SPD fell to third place, while the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) moved into first. The CDU subsequently formed a coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), and CDU leader Wolfgang Böhmer was elected Minister-President.

==Background==
After both the 1994 and 1998 state elections, the SPD formed a minority government with the external support of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS). This marked the first time the PDS had been involved in determining government in a German state, and was a unique arrangement, dubbed the &quot;Magdeburg model&quot; after the capital of Saxony-Anhalt. In Germany, governments are typically coalition governments, in which the parties which support the government take part in cabinet and hold a majority of seats between them. However, the SPD/PDS arrangement functioned on a model of &quot;tolerance&quot;, in which the PDS remained outside cabinet and abstained from the vote for Minister-President, rather than voting in favour, allowing the SPD to form a minority government. In 1994, this allowed the investment of an SPD–Green minority government; in 1998, after the Greens lost their Landtag representation, the SPD governed alone.

==Campaign and issues==
At the time, Saxony-Anhalt was the &quot;poorest&quot; state of Germany, and that with the highest unemployment rate. The state election campaign was also influenced by the upcoming federal election.

The German People&#x27;s Union, which won 12.9% of the vote and 12 seats in 1998, did not run in the election. This came after internal strife and the secession of the Freedom and Democracy People&#x27;s Party (FDVP), which did run in the election.

==Outcome==
The SPD suffered a major defeat, falling to third place behind both the CDU and PDS. The CDU became the largest party with 37% of the vote. The FDP achieved an unexpected victory with 13% of the vote. The Party for a Rule of Law Offensive (Schill party) failed to win seats, despite polling suggesting they would narrowly enter the Landtag.

While polls before the election indicated the SPD and PDS would likely retain a slim majority, the success of the FDP at the SPD&#x27;s expense meant that the CDU and FDP held a comfortable majority between them. Thus, the PDS-backed SPD government no longer had the numbers to retain power. The CDU and FDP negotiated a coalition, with CDU leader Wolfgang Böhmer heading the new government.

The election, which took place five months before the 2002 federal election, was a major defeat for the federal SPD–Green government, and weakened its standing in the Bundesrat.

<doc id="1271915" wikidata="Q1448636" url="?curid=1271915" title="Telling Stories (album)">
<text>Telling Stories is the fifth album by American singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman, released on February 14, 2000, by Elektra Records.

A two-disc special edition was released in Europe in 2000. The album is composed of contemporary rock songs in the first half, and folk songs in the second half.

The record marked a return to shorter songs for Tracy; on &quot;New Beginning&quot; they had been somewhat longer.

==Background and Writing==
In 1999, Chapman began working on her first new record in four years, her longest ever hiatus at the time. For the record, she reunited with producer David Kershenbaum, the producer of her first album, &quot;Tracy Chapman&quot; (1988), and co-producer of her second album, &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1989). The song &quot;Unsung Psalm&quot; was originally written for her previous album, &quot;New Beginning&quot; (1995), but it didn&#x27;t make it onto the album.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Tracy Chapman.


=== Cover versions ===
* &quot;Three Little Birds&quot; is a Bob Marley cover. The song was originally released on the album &quot;Exodus&quot; in 1977.
* &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; is a cover of a traditional folk song. It was firstly released by Ashley and Foster on the single &quot;Rising Sun Blues&quot; under the same title in 1933.

=== Trivia ===
* &quot;Three Little Birds&quot; was recorded at the TNT concert and television special &quot;One Love: An All Star Tribute to Bob Marley&quot; in Oracabessa on December 4, 1999.
* &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; was recorded at the Greek Theatre, Berkeley and the A&amp;M Studios in Los Angeles in 1990. It seems, that it is actually more a live in the studio recording than a real live recording because you don&#x27;t hear any crowd noise. 
* &quot;Mountains o&#x27; Things&quot; was recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival on July 4, 1988.
* &quot;Behind the Wall&quot; was recorded at The Donmar Warehouse in London on March 25, 1988.
* &quot;Baby Can I Hold You&quot; is the same version as the one that was originally released on the album &quot;Tracy Chapman&quot; in 1988.

<doc id="1271927" wikidata="Q113453" url="?curid=1271927" title="Gender equality">
<text>Gender equality, also known as sexual equality or equality of the sexes, is the state of equal ease of access to resources and opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making, and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations, and needs equally, also regardless of gender. To avoid complication, other genders (besides women and men) will &quot;not&quot; be treated in this Gender equality article.

UNICEF (an agency of the United Nations) defines gender equality as &quot;women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources, opportunities and protections. It does not require that girls and boys, or women and men, be the same, or that they be treated exactly alike.&quot;

 gender equality is the fifth of seventeen sustainable development goals (SDG 5) of the United Nations; gender equality has not incorporated the proposition of genders besides women and men, or gender identities outside of the gender binary. Gender inequality is measured annually by the United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s Human Development Reports.

Gender equality can refer to equal opportunities or formal equality based on gender or refer to equal representation or equality of outcomes for gender, also called substantive equality.
Gender equality is the goal, while gender neutrality and gender equity are practices and ways of thinking that help achieve the goal. Gender parity, which is used to measure gender balance in a given situation, can aid in achieving substantive gender equality but is not the goal in and of itself. Gender equality is strongly tied to women&#x27;s rights, and often requires policy changes.

On a global scale, achieving gender equality also requires eliminating harmful practices against women and girls, including sex trafficking, femicide, wartime sexual violence, gender wage gap, and other oppression tactics. UNFPA stated that &quot;despite many international agreements affirming their human rights, women are still much more likely than men to be poor and illiterate. They have less access to property ownership, credit, training, and employment. This partly stems from the archaic stereotypes of women being labeled as child-bearers and homemakers, rather than the breadwinners of the family. They are far less likely than men to be politically active and far more likely to be victims of domestic violence.&quot;

==History==
Christine de Pizan, an early advocate for gender equality, states in her 1405 book &quot;The Book of the City of Ladies&quot; that the oppression of women is founded on irrational prejudice, pointing out numerous advances in society probably created by women.

===Shakers===

The Shakers, an evangelical group, which practiced segregation of the sexes and strict celibacy, were early practitioners of gender equality. They branched off from a Quaker community in the north-west of England before emigrating to America in 1774. In America, the head of the Shakers&#x27; central ministry in 1788, Joseph Meacham, had a revelation that the sexes should be equal. He then brought Lucy Wright into the ministry as his female counterpart, and together they restructured the society to balance the rights of the sexes. Meacham and Wright established leadership teams where each elder, who dealt with the men&#x27;s spiritual welfare, was partnered with an eldress, who did the same for women. Each deacon was partnered with a deaconess. Men had oversight of men; women had oversight of women. Women lived with women; men lived with men. In Shaker society, a woman did not have to be controlled or owned by any man. After Meacham&#x27;s death in 1796, Wright became the head of the Shaker ministry until her death in 1821.

Shakers maintained the same pattern of gender-balanced leadership for more than 200 years. They also promoted equality by working together with other women&#x27;s rights advocates. In 1859, Shaker Elder Frederick Evans stated their beliefs forcefully, writing that Shakers were &quot;the first to disenthrall woman from the condition of vassalage to which all other religious systems (more or less) consign her, and to secure to her those just and equal rights with man that, by her similarity to him in organization and faculties, both God and nature would seem to demand&quot;. Evans and his counterpart, Eldress Antoinette Doolittle, joined women&#x27;s rights advocates on speakers&#x27; platforms throughout the northeastern U.S. in the 1870s. A visitor to the Shakers wrote in 1875:
The Shakers were more than a radical religious sect on the fringes of American society; they put equality of the sexes into practice. It has been argued that they demonstrated that gender equality was achievable and how to achieve it.

===Suffrage movement===
In wider society, the movement towards gender equality began with the suffrage movement in Western cultures in the late-19th century, which sought to allow women to vote and hold elected office. This period also witnessed significant changes to women&#x27;s property rights, particularly in relation to their marital status. (See for example, Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882.)

===Early Soviet Union===
Starting in 1927 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union enforced gender equality within Soviet Central Asia during Hujum campaign.

===Post-war era===
Since World War II, the women&#x27;s liberation movement and feminism have created a general movement towards recognition of women&#x27;s rights. The United Nations and other international agencies have adopted several conventions which promote gender equality. These conventions have not been uniformly adopted by all countries, and include:
* The Convention against Discrimination in Education was adopted in 1960, and came into force in 1962 and 1968.
* The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly. It has been described as an international bill of rights for women, which came into force on 3 September 1981.
* The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, a human rights declaration adopted by consensus at the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993 in Vienna, Austria. Women&#x27;s rights are addressed at para 18.
* The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1993.
* In 1994, the twenty-year &quot;Cairo Programme of Action&quot; was adopted at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo. This non binding programme-of-action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals&#x27; reproductive needs, rather than demographic targets. As such, it called for family planning, reproductive rights services, and strategies to promote gender equality and stop violence against women.
* Also in 1994, in the Americas, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women, known as the Belém do Pará Convention, called for the end of violence and discrimination against women.
* At the end of the Fourth World Conference on Women, the UN adopted the Beijing Declaration on 15 September 1995 – a resolution adopted to promulgate a set of principles concerning gender equality.
* The United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSRC 1325), which was adopted on 31 October 2000, deals with the rights and protection of women and girls during and after armed conflicts.
* The Maputo Protocol guarantees comprehensive rights to women, including the right to take part in the political process, to social and political equality with men, to control their reproductive health, and an end to female genital mutilation. It was adopted by the African Union in the form of a protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights and came into force in 2005.
* The EU directive &quot;Directive 2002/73/EC – equal treatment of 23 September 2002 amending Council Directive 76/207/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions&quot; states that: &quot;Harassment and sexual harassment within the meaning of this Directive shall be deemed to be discrimination on the grounds of sex and therefore prohibited.&quot;
* The Council of Europe&#x27;s Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women, came into force in 2014.
* The Council of Europe&#x27;s &quot;Gender Equality Strategy 2014–2017&quot;, which has five strategic objectives:
:*Combating gender stereotypes and sexism
:*Preventing and combating violence against women
:*Guaranteeing Equal Access of Women to Justice
:*Achieving balanced participation of women and men in political and public decision-making
:*Achieving Gender Mainstreaming in all policies and measures

Such legislation and affirmative action policies have been critical to bringing changes in societal attitudes. A 2015 Pew Research Center survey of citizens in 38 countries found that majorities in 37 of those 38 countries said that gender equality is at least &quot;somewhat important&quot;, and a global median of 65% believe it is &quot;very important&quot; that women have the same rights as men. Most occupations are now equally available to men and women, in many countries.

Similarly, men are increasingly working in occupations which in previous generations had been considered women&#x27;s work, such as nursing, cleaning and child care. In domestic situations, the role of Parenting or child rearing is more commonly shared or not as widely considered to be an exclusively female role, so that women may be free to pursue a career after childbirth. For further information, see Shared earning/shared parenting marriage.

Another manifestation of the change in social attitudes is the non-automatic taking by a woman of her husband&#x27;s surname on marriage.

A highly contentious issue relating to gender equality is the role of women in religiously orientated societies. Some Christians or Muslims believe in Complementarianism, a view that holds that men and women have different but complementing roles. This view may be in opposition to the views and goals of gender equality.

In addition, there are also non-Western countries of low religiosity where the contention surrounding gender equality remains. In China, a cultural preference for a male child has resulted in a shortfall of women in the population. The feminist movement in Japan has made many strides which resulted in the Gender Equality Bureau, but Japan still remains low in gender equality compared to other industrialized nations.Developing countries like Kenya, on the other hand, do not have official national statistics and have to rely on some gender-disaggregated statistics, usually funded by international organizations, for their analysis.

The notion of gender equality, and of its degree of achievement in a certain country, is very complex because there are countries that have a history of a high level of gender equality in certain areas of life but not in other areas. Indeed, there is a need for caution when categorizing countries by the level of gender equality that they have achieved. According to Mala Htun and S. Laurel Weldon &quot;gender policy is not one issue but many&quot; and:
Not all beliefs relating to gender equality have been popularly adopted. For example, topfreedom, the right to be bare breasted in public, frequently applies only to males and has remained a marginal issue. Breastfeeding in public is now more commonly tolerated, especially in semi-private places such as restaurants.

===United Nations===

It is the vision that men and women should be treated equally in social, economic and all other aspects of society, and to not be discriminated against on the basis of their gender. Gender equality is one of the objectives of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. World bodies have defined gender equality in terms of human rights, especially women&#x27;s rights, and economic development. The United Nation&#x27;s Millennium Development Goals Report states that their goal is to &quot;achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women&quot;. Despite economic struggles in developing countries, the United Nations is still trying to promote gender equality, as well as help create a sustainable living environment is all its nations. Their goals also include giving women who work certain full-time jobs equal pay to the men with the same job.

==Contemporary efforts to fight inequality==

In 2010, the European Union opened the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) in Vilnius, Lithuania to promote gender equality and to fight sex discrimination. In 2015 the EU published the Gender Action Plan 2016–2020.

Gender equality is part of the national curriculum in Great Britain and many other European countries. By presidential decree, the Republic of Kazakhstan created a Strategy for Gender Equality 2006–2016 to chart the subsequent decade of gender equality efforts. Personal, social, health and economic education, religious studies and language acquisition curricula tend to address gender equality issues as a very serious topic for discussion and analysis of its effect in society.

A large and growing body of research has shown how gender inequality undermines health and development. To overcome gender inequality the United Nations Population Fund states that women&#x27;s empowerment and gender equality requires strategic interventions at all levels of programming and policy-making. These levels include reproductive health, economic empowerment, educational empowerment and political empowerment.

UNFPA says that &quot;research has also demonstrated how working with men and boys as well as women and girls to promote gender equality contributes to achieving health and development outcomes.&quot;

The extent to which national policy frameworks address gender issues improved over the past decade. National policies and budgets in East Africa and Latin America, for example, have increasingly highlighted structural gaps in access to land, inputs, services, finance and digital technology and included efforts to produce gender-responsive outcomes. However, the extent to which agricultural policies specifically address gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment varies.

Even though more than 75 percent of agricultural policies that the Food and Agriculture Organization analysed recognized women&#x27;s roles and/or challenges in agriculture, only 19 percent had gender equality in agriculture or women&#x27;s rights as explicit policy objectives. And only 13 percent encouraged rural women&#x27;s participation in the policy cycle.

In the Philippines, the country&#x27;s second woman President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed on August 14, 2009 into law the Republic Act No. 9710 or the Magna Carta of Women of 2009 to address the long-standing struggle of Filipino women for equal rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against them. This comprehensive law compiles human rights laws aimed at eliminating discrimination against women. It declares the State&#x27;s commitment to recognizing women&#x27;s roles in nation-building, affirming women&#x27;s rights as human rights, condemning all forms of discrimination against women in line with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), and enforcing legal measures to promote equal opportunities for women to participate in and contribute to development. It also reaffirms women&#x27;s rights to participate in policy formulation, planning, monitoring, and evaluation of all programs, projects, and services.

===Health and safety===
====Effect of gender inequality on health====
Social constructs of gender (that is, cultural ideals of socially acceptable masculinity and femininity) often have a negative effect on health. The World Health Organization cites the example of women not being allowed to travel alone outside the home (to go to the hospital), and women being prevented by cultural norms to ask their husbands to use a condom, in cultures which simultaneously encourage male promiscuity, as social norms that harm women&#x27;s health. Teenage boys suffering accidents due to social expectations of impressing their peers through risk taking, and men dying at much higher rate from lung cancer due to smoking, in cultures which link smoking to masculinity, are cited by the WHO as examples of gender norms negatively affecting men&#x27;s health. The World Health Organization has also stated that there is a strong connection between gender socialization and transmission and lack of adequate management of HIV/AIDS.

Certain cultural practices, such as female genital mutilation (FGM), negatively affect women&#x27;s health. Female genital mutilation is the ritual cutting or removal of some or all of the external female genitalia. It is rooted in inequality between the sexes, and constitutes a form of discrimination against women. The practice is found in Africa, Asia, Middle East and Indonesia, and in Europe among immigrant communities from countries in which FGM is common. UNICEF estimated in 2016 that 200 million women have undergone the procedure.According to the World Health Organization, gender equality can improve men&#x27;s health. The study shows that traditional notions of masculinity have a big impact on men&#x27;s health. Among European men, non-communicable diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory illnesses, and diabetes, account for the vast majority of deaths of men aged 30–59 in Europe which are often linked to unhealthy diets, stress, substance abuse, and other habits, which the report connects to behaviors often stereotypically seen as masculine behaviors like heavy drinking and smoking. Traditional gender stereotypes that keep men in the role of breadwinner and systematic discrimination preventing women from equally contributing to their households and participating in the workforce can put additional stress on men, increasing their risk of health issues, and men bolstered by cultural norms tend to take more risks and engage in interpersonal violence more often than women, which could result in fatal injuries.
====Violence against women====


Violence against women (VAW) is a technical term used to collectively refer to violent acts that are primarily or exclusively committed against women. This type of violence is gender-based, meaning that the acts of violence are committed against women expressly &quot;because&quot; they are women, or as a result of patriarchal gender constructs. Violence and mistreatment of women in marriage has come to international attention during the past decades. This includes both violence committed inside marriage (domestic violence) as well as violence related to marriage customs and traditions (such as dowry, bride price, forced marriage and child marriage).

According to some theories, violence against women is often caused by the acceptance of violence by various cultural groups as a means of conflict resolution within intimate relationships. Studies on Intimate partner violence victimization among ethnic minorities in the United Studies have consistently revealed that immigrants are a high-risk group for intimate violence.

In countries where gang murders, armed kidnappings, civil unrest, and other similar acts are rare, the vast majority of murdered women are killed by partners/ex-partners. By contrast, in countries with a high level of organized criminal activity and gang violence, murders of women are more likely to occur in a public sphere, often in a general climate of indifference and impunity. In addition, many countries do not have adequate comprehensive data collection on such murders, aggravating the problem.

In some parts of the world, various forms of violence against women are tolerated and accepted as parts of everyday life.

In most countries, it is only in more recent decades that domestic violence against women has received significant legal attention. The Istanbul Convention acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring this form of violence.

In some cultures, acts of violence against women are seen as crimes against the male &#x27;owners&#x27; of the woman, such as husband, father or male relatives, rather the woman herself. This leads to practices where men inflict violence upon women in order to get revenge on male members of the women&#x27;s family. Such practices include payback rape, a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the Pacific Islands, which consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers, with the rape being meant to humiliate the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators.

Richard A. Posner writes that &quot;Traditionally, rape was the offense of depriving a father or husband of a valuable asset — his wife&#x27;s chastity or his daughter&#x27;s virginity&quot;. Historically, rape was seen in many cultures (and is still seen today in some societies) as a crime against the honor of the family, rather than against the self-determination of the woman. As a result, victims of rape may face violence, in extreme cases even honor killings, at the hands of their family members. Catharine MacKinnon argues that in male dominated societies, sexual intercourse is imposed on women in a coercive and unequal way, creating a continuum of victimization, where women have few positive sexual experiences. Socialization within rigid gender constructs often creates an environment where sexual violence is common. One of the challenges of dealing with sexual violence is that in many societies women are perceived as being readily available for sex, and men are seen as entitled to their bodies, until and unless women object.

=====Types of VAW=====

Violence against women may be classified according to different approaches.
* WHO&#x27;s life cycle typology:

The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a typology of violence against women based on their cultural life cycles.
Significant progress towards the protection of women from violence has been made on international level as a product of collective effort of lobbying by many women&#x27;s rights movements; international organizations to civil society groups. As a result, worldwide governments and international as well as civil society organizations actively work to combat violence against women through a variety of programs. Among the major achievements of the women&#x27;s rights movements against violence on girls and women, the landmark accomplishments are the &quot;Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women&quot; that implies &quot;political will towards addressing VAW &quot; and the legal binding agreement, &quot;the Convention on Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)&quot;. In addition, the UN General Assembly resolution also designated 25 November as International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.
* &quot;The Lancets over time typology&quot;&#x27;:

A typology similar to the WHO&#x27;s from an article on violence against women published in the academic journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; shows the different types of violence perpetrated against women according to what time period in a women&#x27;s life the violence takes place. However, it also classifies the types of violence according to the perpetrator. One important point to note is that more of the types of violence inflicted on women are perpetrated by someone the woman knows, either a family member or intimate partner, rather than a stranger.
* Council of Europe&#x27;s nine forms of violence:

The Gender Equality Commission of the Council of Europe identifies nine forms of violence against women based on subject and context rather than life cycle or time period:
* &#x27;Violence within the family or domestic violence&#x27;
* &#x27;Rape and sexual violence&#x27;
* &#x27;Sexual harassment&#x27;
* &#x27;Violence in institutional environments&#x27;
* &#x27;Female genital mutilation&#x27;
* &#x27;Forced marriages&#x27;
* &#x27;Violence in conflict and post-conflict situations&#x27;
* &#x27;Killings in the name of honour&#x27;
* &#x27;Failure to respect freedom of choice with regard to reproduction&#x27;

=====Violence against trans women=====
Killings of transgender individuals, especially transgender women, continue to rise yearly. 2020 saw a record 350 transgender individuals murdered, with means including suffocation and burning alive.

In 2009, United States data showed that transgender people are likely to experience a broad range of violence in the entirety of their lifetime. Violence against trans women in Puerto Rico started to make headlines after being treated as &quot;An Invisible Problem&quot; decades before. It was reported at the 58th Convention of the Puerto Rican Association that many transgender women face institutional, emotional, and structural obstacles. Most trans women do not have access to health care for STD prevention and are not educated on violence prevention, mental health, and social services that could benefit them.

Trans women in the United States have been the subject of anti-trans stigma, which includes criminalization, dehumanization, and violence against those who identify as transgender. From a societal standpoint, a trans person can be victim to the stigma due to lack of family support, issues with health care and social services, police brutality, discrimination in the work place, cultural marginalisation, poverty, sexual assault, assault, bullying, and mental trauma. The Human Rights Campaign tracked over 128 cases that ended in fatality against transgender people in the US from 2013 to 2018, of which eighty percent included a trans woman of color. In the US, high rates of Intimate Partner violence impact trans women differently because they are facing discrimination from police and health providers, and alienation from family. In 2018, it was reported that 77 percent of transgender people who were linked to sex work and 72 percent of transgender people who were homeless, were victims of intimate partner violence.

====Reproductive and sexual health and rights====

The importance of women having the right and possibility to have control over their body, reproduction decisions, and sexuality, and the need for gender equality in order to achieve these goals are recognized as crucial by the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing and the UN International Conference on Population and Development Program of Action. The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that promotion of gender equality is crucial in the fight against HIV/AIDS.

Maternal mortality is a major problem in many parts of the world. UNFPA states that countries have an obligation to protect women&#x27;s right to health, but many countries do not do that. Maternal mortality is considered today not just an issue of development but also an issue of human rights.

The right to reproductive and sexual autonomy is denied to women in many parts of the world, through practices such as forced sterilization, forced/coerced sexual partnering (e.g. forced marriage, child marriage), criminalization of consensual sexual acts (such as sex outside marriage), lack of criminalization of marital rape, violence in regard to the choice of partner (honor killings as punishment for &#x27;inappropriate&#x27; relations). The sexual health of women is often poor in societies where a woman&#x27;s right to control her sexuality is not recognized.

Adolescent girls have the highest risk of sexual coercion, sexual ill health, and negative reproductive outcomes. The risks they face are higher than those of boys and men; this increased risk is partly due to gender inequity (different socialization of boys and girls, gender based violence, child marriage) and partly due to biological factors.

=====Family planning and abortion=====
Family planning is the practice of freely deciding the number of children one has and the intervals between their births, particularly by means of contraception or voluntary sterilization. Abortion is the induced termination of pregnancy. Abortion laws vary significantly by country. The availability of contraception, sterilization and abortion is dependent on laws, as well as social, cultural and religious norms. Some countries have liberal laws regarding these issues, but in practice it is very difficult to access such services due to doctors, pharmacists and other social and medical workers being conscientious objectors. Family planning is particularly important from a women&#x27;s rights perspective, as having very many pregnancies, especially in areas where malnutrition is present, can seriously endanger women&#x27;s health. UNFA writes that &quot;Family planning is central to gender equality and women&#x27;s empowerment, and it is a key factor in reducing poverty&quot;.

Family planning is often opposed by governments who have strong natalist policies. During the 20th century, such examples have included the aggressive natalist policies from communist Romania and communist Albania. State mandated forced marriage was also practiced by some authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets: the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia systematically forced people into marriages, in order to increase the population and continue the revolution. By contrast, the one-child policy of China (1979–2015) included punishments for families with more than one child and forced abortions. The fine is so-called &quot;social maintenance fee&quot; and it is the punishment for the families who have more than one child. According to the policy, the families who violate the law may bring the burden to the whole sociey. Therefore, the social maintenance fee will be used for the operation of the basic government. Some governments have sought to prevent certain ethnic or social groups from reproduction. Such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in Europe and North America in the 20th century, and more recently in Latin America against the Indigenous population in the 1990s; in Peru, President Alberto Fujimori (in office from 1990 to 2000) has been accused of genocide and crimes against humanity as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people (mainly the Quechuas and the Aymaras).

====Investigation and prosecution of crimes against women and girls====
Human rights organizations have expressed concern about the legal impunity of perpetrators of crimes against women, with such crimes being often ignored by authorities. This is especially the case with murders of women in Latin America. In particular, there is impunity in regard to domestic violence.

Women are often, in law or in practice, unable to access legal institutions. UN Women has said that: &quot;Too often, justice institutions, including the police and the courts, deny women justice&quot;. Often, women are denied legal recourse because the state institutions themselves are structured and operate in ways incompatible with genuine justice for women who experience violence.

====Harmful traditional practices====
&quot;Harmful traditional practices&quot; refer to forms of violence which are committed in certain communities often enough to become cultural practice, and accepted for that reason. Young women are the main victims of such acts, although men can also be affected. They occur in an environment where women and girls have unequal rights and opportunities.
These practices include, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights:

Son preference refers to a cultural preference for sons over daughters, and manifests itself through practices such as sex selective abortion; female infanticide; or abandonment, neglect or abuse of girl-children.

Abuses regarding nutrition are taboos in regard to certain foods, which result in poor nutrition of women, and may endanger their health, especially if pregnant.

The caste system in India which leads to untouchability (the practice of ostracizing a group by segregating them from the mainstream society) often interacts with gender discrimination, leading to a double discrimination faced by Dalit women. In a 2014 survey, 27% of Indians admitted to practicing untouchability.

Traditional customs regarding birth sometimes endanger the mothers. Births in parts of Africa are often attended by traditional birth attendants (TBAs), who sometimes perform rituals that are dangerous to the health of the mother. In many societies, a difficult labour is believed to be a divine punishment for marital infidelity, and such women face abuse and are pressured to &quot;confess&quot; to the infidelity.

Tribal traditions can be harmful to males; for instance, the Satere-Mawe tribe use bullet ants as an initiation rite. Men must wear gloves with hundreds of bullet ants woven in for ten minutes: the ants&#x27; stings cause severe pain and paralysis. This experience must be completed twenty times for boys to be considered &quot;warriors&quot;.

Other harmful traditional practices include marriage by abduction, ritualized sexual slavery (Devadasi, Trokosi), breast ironing and widow inheritance.

=====Female genital mutilation=====

UNFPA and UNICEF regard the practice of female genital mutilation as &quot;a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality. It persists for many reasons. In some societies, for example, it is considered a rite of passage. In others, it is seen as a prerequisite for marriage. In some communities – whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim – the practice may even be attributed to religious beliefs.&quot;

An estimated 125 million women and girls living today have undergone FGM in the 29 countries where data exist. Of these, about half live in Egypt and Ethiopia. It is most commonly carried out on girls between infancy and 15 years old.

=====Forced marriage and child marriage=====
Early marriage, child marriage or forced marriage is prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa. The majority of victims seeking advice are female and aged between 18 and 23. Such marriages can have harmful effects on a girl&#x27;s education and development, and may expose girls to social isolation or abuse.

The 2013 UN Resolution on Child, Early and Forced Marriage calls for an end to the practice, and states that &quot;Recognizing that child, early and forced marriage is a harmful practice that violates abuses, or impairs human rights and is linked to and perpetuates other harmful practices and human rights violations, that these violations have a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls [...]&quot;. Despite a near-universal commitment by governments to end child marriage, &quot;one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18.&quot; UNFPA states that, &quot;over 67 million women 20–24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls. Half were in Asia, one-fifth in Africa. In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day. This will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue.&quot;

=====Bride price=====

Bride price (also called bridewealth or bride token) is money, property, or other form of wealth paid by a groom or his family to the parents of the bride. This custom often leads to women having reduced ability to control their fertility. For instance, in northern Ghana, the payment of bride price signifies a woman&#x27;s requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face threats, violence and reprisals. The custom of bride price has been criticized as contributing to the mistreatment of women in marriage, and preventing them from leaving abusive marriages. UN Women recommended its abolition, and stated that: &quot;Legislation should ... State that divorce shall not be contingent upon the return of bride price but such provisions shall not be interpreted to limit women&#x27;s right to divorce; State that a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge.&quot;

The custom of bride price can also curtail the free movement of women: if a wife wants to leave her husband, he may demand back the bride price that he had paid to the woman&#x27;s family; and the woman&#x27;s family often cannot or does not want to pay it back, making it difficult for women to move out of violent husbands&#x27; homes.

===Economy and public policy===
====Economic empowerment of women====

Promoting gender equality is seen as an encouragement to greater economic prosperity. Female economic activity is a common measure of gender equality in an economy.
Gender discrimination often results in women obtaining low-wage jobs and being disproportionately affected by poverty, discrimination and exploitation. A growing body of research documents what works to economically empower women, from providing access to formal financial services to training on agricultural and business management practices, though more research is needed across a variety of contexts to confirm the effectiveness of these interventions.

Gender biases also exist in product and service provision. The term &quot;Women&#x27;s Tax&quot;, also known as &quot;Pink Tax&quot;, refers to gendered pricing in which products or services marketed to women are more expensive than similar products marketed to men. Gender-based price discrimination involves companies selling almost identical units of the same product or service at comparatively different prices, as determined by the target market. Studies have found that women pay about $1,400 a year more than men due to gendered discriminatory pricing. Although the &quot;pink tax&quot; of different goods and services is not uniform, overall women pay more for commodities that result in visual evidence of feminine body image.

In addition, gender wage gap is a phenomenon of gender biases. That means women do the same job or work with their male counterpart, but they could not receive the same salary or opportunity at workforce. Across the European Union, for example, since women continue to hold lower-paying jobs, they earn 13% less than men on average. According to European Quality of Life Survey and European Working Conditions Survey data, women in the European Union work more hours but for less pay. Adult men (including the retired) work an average of 23 hours per week, compared to 15 hours for women.

Women continue to earn around 25% less than males. Almost a billion women are unable to obtain loans to establish a company or create a bank account in order to save money. Increasing women&#x27;s equality in banking and the workplace might boost the global economy by up to $28 trillion by 2025. Funding is becoming more available for this, for example with the European Investment Bank establishing the SheInvest program in 2020 with the goal of raising €1 billion in investments to assist women in obtaining loans and running enterprises across Africa.

The European Investment Bank funded an additional €2 billion in gender-lens investment in Africa, Asia, and Latin America at the Finance in Common Summit at the end of 2022.

====Gendered arrangements of work and care====

Since the 1950s, social scientists as well as feminists have increasingly criticized gendered arrangements of work and care and the male breadwinner role. Policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers as a tool of changing gender relations.
Shared earning/shared parenting marriage, that is, a relationship where the partners collaborate at sharing their responsibilities inside and outside of the home, is often encouraged in Western countries.

Western countries with a strong emphasis on women fulfilling the role of homemakers, rather than a professional role, include parts of German speaking Europe (i.e. parts of Germany, Austria and Switzerland); as well as the Netherlands and Ireland. In the computer technology world of Silicon Valley in the United States, &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Nellie Bowles has covered harassment and bias against women as well as a backlash against female equality.

Females are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) at all levels of society. Fewer females are completing STEM school subjects, graduating with STEM degrees, being employed as STEM professionals, and holding senior leadership and academic positions in STEM. This problem is exacerbated by the gender pay gap; family role expectations; lack of visible role models or mentors; discrimination and harassment; and bias in hiring and promotion practices.

A key issue towards insuring gender equality in the workplace is the respecting of maternity rights and reproductive rights of women. Different countries have different rules regarding maternity leave, paternity leave and parental leave. Another important issue is ensuring that employed women are not &quot;de jure&quot; or &quot;de facto&quot; prevented from having a child. In some countries, employers ask women to sign formal or informal documents stipulating that they will not get pregnant or face legal punishment. Women often face severe violations of their reproductive rights at the hands of their employers; and the International Labour Organization classifies forced abortion coerced by the employer as labour exploitation. Other abuses include routine virginity tests of unmarried employed women.

====Gendered arrangements of conscription====

Military and conscription has been historically generally gender inequal. Increasingly women are included in the military. Currently only a few countries in the world, including Norway and Sweden, have gender-equal formal rules for conscription. Gender Equality Indices have been criticized for neglecting conscription as a source of formal gender inequality.

====Freedom of movement====
The degree to which women can participate (in law and in practice) in public life varies by culture and socioeconomic characteristics. Seclusion of women within the home was a common practice among the upper classes of many societies, and this still remains the case today in some societies. Before the 20th century it was also common in parts of Southern Europe, such as much of Spain.

Women&#x27;s freedom of movement continues to be legally restricted in some parts of the world. This restriction is often due to marriage laws. In some countries, women must legally be accompanied by their male guardians (such as the husband or male relative) when they leave home.

The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) states at Article 15 (4) that:
In addition to laws, women&#x27;s freedom of movement is also restricted by social and religious norms. Restrictions on freedom of movement also exist due to traditional practices such as baad, swara, or vani.

====Girls&#x27; access to education====

In many parts of the world, girls&#x27; access to education is very restricted. In developing parts of the world women are often denied opportunities for education as girls and women face many obstacles. These include: early and forced marriages; early pregnancy; prejudice based on gender stereotypes at home, at school and in the community; violence on the way to school, or in and around schools; long distances to schools; vulnerability to the HIV epidemic; school fees, which often lead to parents sending only their sons to school; lack of gender sensitive approaches and materials in classrooms. According to OHCHR, there have been multiple attacks on schools worldwide during the period 2009–2014 with &quot;a number of these attacks being specifically directed at girls, parents and teachers advocating for gender equality in education&quot;. The United Nations Population Fund says:
According to UNESCO, extreme exclusion still characterizes some countries, and pockets of exclusion remain in others. In Afghanistan, where girls have been banned again from secondary schools, there had been rapid progress in completion rates. For example, girls&#x27; primary completion increased from 8% in 2000 to 56% in 2020, although the gender gap remained at 20 percentage points. In some provinces, such as Uruzgan, just 1% of girls completed primary in 2015. A 20 percentage point gender gap in access to upper secondary education is also observed in sub-Saharan African countries, including Chad and Guinea.

====Political participation of women====
 

Women are underrepresented in most countries&#x27; National Parliaments. The 2011 UN General Assembly resolution on women&#x27;s political participation called for female participation in politics, and expressed concern about the fact that &quot;women in every part of the world continue to be largely marginalized from the political sphere&quot;. Only 22 percent of parliamentarians globally are women and therefore, men continue to occupy most positions of political and legal authority. As of November 2014, women accounted for 28% of members of the single or lower houses of parliaments in the European Union member states.

In some Western countries women have only recently obtained the right to vote.

In 2015, 61.3% of Rwanda&#x27;s Lower House of Parliament were women, the highest proportion anywhere in the world, but worldwide that was one of only two such bodies where women were in the majority, the other being Bolivia&#x27;s Lower House of Parliament. (See also Gender equality in Rwanda).

====Marriage, divorce and property laws and regulations====
Equal rights for women in marriage, divorce, and property/land ownership and inheritance are essential for gender equality. The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) has called for the end of discriminatory family laws. In 2013, UN Women stated that &quot;While at least 115 countries recognize equal land rights for women and men, effective implementation remains a major challenge&quot;.

The legal and social treatment of married women has been often discussed as a political issue from the 19th century onwards. Until the 1970s, legal subordination of married women was common across European countries, through marriage laws giving legal authority to the husband, as well as through marriage bars. In 1978, the Council of Europe passed the &quot;Resolution (78) 37 on equality of spouses in civil law&quot;. Switzerland was one of the last countries in Europe to establish gender equality in marriage, in this country married women&#x27;s rights were severely restricted until 1988, when legal reforms providing for gender equality in marriage, abolishing the legal authority of the husband, come into force (these reforms had been approved in 1985 by voters in a referendum, who narrowly voted in favor with 54.7% of voters approving). In the Netherlands, it was only in 1984 that full legal equality between husband and wife was achieved: prior to 1984 the law stipulated that the husband&#x27;s opinion prevailed over the wife&#x27;s regarding issues such as decisions on children&#x27;s education and the domicile of the family.

In the United States, a wife&#x27;s legal subordination to her husband was fully ended by the case of &quot;Kirchberg v. Feenstra&quot;, , a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held a Louisiana Head and Master law, which gave sole control of marital property to the husband, unconstitutional.

There have been and sometimes continue to be unequal treatment of married women in various aspects of everyday life. For example, in Australia, until 1983 a husband had to authorize an application for an Australian passport for a married woman. Other practices have included, and in many countries continue to include, a requirement for a husband&#x27;s consent for an application for bank loans and credit cards by a married woman, as well as restrictions on the wife&#x27;s reproductive rights, such as a requirement that the husband consents to the wife&#x27;s acquiring contraception or having an abortion. In some places, although the law itself no longer requires the consent of the husband for various actions taken by the wife, the practice continues &quot;de facto&quot;, with the authorization of the husband being asked in practice.

Although dowry is today mainly associated with South Asia, the practice has been common until the mid-20th century in parts of Southeast Europe.

Laws regulating marriage and divorce continue to discriminate against women in many countries. In Iraq husbands have a legal right to &quot;punish&quot; their wives, with paragraph 41 of the criminal code stating that there is no crime if an act is committed while exercising a legal right. In the 1990s and the 21st century there has been progress in many countries in Africa: for instance in Namibia the marital power of the husband was abolished in 1996 by the &quot;Married Persons Equality Act&quot;; in Botswana it was abolished in 2004 by the &quot;Abolition of Marital Power Act&quot;; and in Lesotho it was abolished in 2006 by the &quot;Married Persons Equality Act&quot;. Violence against a wife continues to be seen as legally acceptable in some countries; for instance in 2010, the United Arab Emirates Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks. The criminalization of adultery has been criticized as being a prohibition, which, in law or in practice, is used primarily against women; and incites violence against women (crimes of passion, honor killings).

===Social and ideological===

====Political gender equality====
Two recent movements in countries with large Kurdish populations have implemented political gender equality. One has been the Kurdish movement in southeastern Turkey led by the Democratic Regions Party (DBP) and the Peoples&#x27; Democratic Party (HDP), from 2006 or before.
The mayorships of 2 metropolitan areas and 97 towns are led jointly by a man and a woman, both called co-mayors. Party offices are also led by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed, which also had to be co-presided over by a man and a woman together. However, in November 2016 the Turkish government cracked down on the HDP, jailing ten of its members of Parliament, including the party&#x27;s male and female co-leaders.

A movement in northern Syria, also Kurdish, has been led by the Democratic Union Party (PYD). In northern Syria all villages, towns and cities governed by the PYD were co-governed by a man and a woman. Local councils were formed where each sex had to have 40% representation, and minorities also had to be represented.

====Gender stereotypes====
Gender stereotypes arise from the socially approved roles of women and men in the private or public sphere, at home or in the workplace. In the household, women are typically seen as mother figures, which usually places them into a typical classification of being &quot;supportive&quot; or &quot;nurturing&quot;. Women are expected to want to take on the role of a mother and take on primary responsibility for household needs. Their male counterparts are seen as being &quot;assertive&quot; or &quot;ambitious&quot; as men are usually seen in the workplace or as the primary breadwinner for his family. Due to these views and expectations, women often face discrimination in the public sphere, such as the workplace. Women are stereotyped to be less productive at work because they are believed to focus more on family when they get married or have children.
A gender role is a set of societal norms dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their sex. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of femininity and masculinity, although there are exceptions and variations.

====Portrayal of women in the media====

The way women are represented in the media has been criticized as perpetuating negative gender stereotypes. The exploitation of women in mass media refers to the criticisms that are levied against the use or objectification of women in the mass media, when such use or portrayal aims at increasing the appeal of media or a product, to the detriment of, or without regard to, the interests of the women portrayed, or women in general. Concerns include the fact that all forms of media have the power to shape the population&#x27;s perceptions and portray images of unrealistic stereotypical perceptions by portraying women either as submissive housewives or as sex objects. The media emphasizes traditional domestic or sexual roles that normalize violence against women. The vast array of studies that have been conducted on the issue of the portrayal of women in the media have shown that women are often portrayed as irrational, fragile, not intelligent, submissive and
subservient to men. Research has shown that stereotyped images such as these have been shown to negatively impact on the mental health of many female viewers who feel bound by these roles, causing amongst other problems, self-esteem issues, depression and anxiety.

According to a study, the way women are often portrayed by the media can lead to: &quot;Women of average or normal appearance feeling inadequate or less beautiful in comparison to the overwhelming use of extraordinarily attractive women&quot;; &quot;Increase in the likelihood and acceptance of sexual violence&quot;; &quot;Unrealistic expectations by men of how women should look or behave&quot;; &quot;Psychological disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, anorexia, bulimia and so on&quot;; &quot;The importance of physical appearance is emphasized and reinforced early in most girls&#x27; development.&quot; Studies have found that nearly half of females ages six–eight have stated they want to be slimmer. (Striegel-Moore &amp; Franko, 2002)&quot;.

====Statistics on women&#x27;s representation in the media====
* Women have won only a quarter of Pulitzer prizes for foreign reporting and only 17 per cent of awards of the Martha Gellhorn Prize for Journalism. In 2015 the African Development Bank began sponsoring a category for Women&#x27;s Rights in Africa, designed to promote gender equality through the media, as one of the prizes awarded annually by One World Media.
* Created in 1997, the UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize is an annual award that honors a person, organization or institution that has made a notable contribution to the defense and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world. Nine out of 20 winners have been women.
* The Poynter Institute since 2014 has been running a Leadership Academy for Women in Digital Media, expressly focused on the skills and knowledge needed to achieve success in the digital media environment.
* The World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA), which represents more than 18,000 publications, 15,000 online sites and more than 3,000 companies in more than 120 countries, leads the Women in the News (WIN) campaign together with UNESCO as part of their Gender and Media Freedom Strategy. In their 2016 handbook, WINing Strategies: Creating Stronger Media Organizations by Increasing Gender Diversity, they highlight a range of positive action strategies undertaken by a number of their member organizations from Germany to Jordan to Colombia, with the intention of providing blueprints for others to follow.

====Informing women of their rights====
While in many countries, the problem lies in the lack of adequate legislation, in others the principal problem is not as much the lack of a legal framework, but the fact that most women do not know their legal rights. This is especially the case as many of the laws dealing with women&#x27;s rights are of recent date. This lack of knowledge enables to abusers to lead the victims (explicitly or implicitly) to believe that their abuse is within their rights. This may apply to a wide range of abuses, ranging from domestic violence to employment discrimination. The United Nations Development Programme states that, in order to advance gender justice, &quot;Women must know their rights and be able to access legal systems&quot;.

The 1993 UN Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women states at Art. 4 (d) [...] &quot;States should also inform women of their rights in seeking redress through such mechanisms&quot;. Enacting protective legislation against violence has little effect, if women do not know how to use it: for example a study of Bedouin women in Israel found that 60% did not know what a restraining order was; or if they do not know what acts are illegal: a report by Amnesty International showed in Hungary, in a public opinion poll of nearly 1,200 people in 2006, a total of 62% did not know that marital rape was an illegal (it was outlawed in 1997) and therefore the crime was rarely reported. Ensuring women have a minimum understanding of health issues is also important: lack of access to reliable medical information and available medical procedures to which they are entitled hurts women&#x27;s health.

====Gender mainstreaming====

Gender mainstreaming is described as the public policy of assessing the different implications for women and men of any planned policy action, including legislation and programmes, in all areas and levels, with the aim of achieving gender equality. The concept of gender mainstreaming was first proposed at the 1985 Third World Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya. The idea has been developed in the United Nations development community. Gender mainstreaming &quot;involves ensuring that gender perspectives and attention to the goal of gender equality are central to all activities&quot;.

According to the Council of Europe definition: &quot;Gender mainstreaming is the (re)organization, improvement, development and evaluation of policy processes, so that a gender equality perspective is incorporated in all policies at all levels and at all stages, by the actors normally involved in policy-making.&quot;

An integrated gender mainstreaming approach is &quot;the attempt to form alliances and common platforms that bring together the power of faith and gender-equality aspirations to advance human rights.&quot; For example, &quot;in Azerbaijan, UNFPA conducted a study on gender equality by comparing the text of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women with some widely recognized Islamic references and resources. The results reflect the parallels between the Convention and many tenets of Islamic scripture and practice. The study showcased specific issues, including VAW, child marriage, respect for the dignity of women, and equality in the economic and political participation of women. The study was later used to produce training materials geared towards sensitizing religious leaders.&quot;

== Gender biases ==

A study involving predicting personality characteristics of individuals in photographs across 44 countries found that the women-are-wonderful effect is lower in countries with high measures of gender equality, with the decrease arising from men being viewed less negatively. The gender-equality paradox is the observation that gendered differences in personality tend to be higher in countries with higher gender equality.

==Measuring Gender Equality==
Gender equality is measured using a framework that evaluates four key areas: political empowerment, educational attainment, health and survival, and economic participation and opportunity. The Global Gender Gap Report, released annually by the World Economic Forum, analyzes these factors to assess the progress towards gender equality. The report highlights the extent of gender disparities and notes that while some nations have made significant strides, there is still a long way to go to achieve full gender equality.

For instance, political empowerment is the area with the largest gender disparity, with only about 24% of legislative seats held by women globally. There&#x27;s also a substantial gap in economic participation, with women facing challenges in accessing equal opportunities1. Despite some progress in education and health, gender inequality remains deeply rooted and continues to affect women and girls worldwide3.

The report emphasizes that achieving gender equality requires concerted efforts from governments, businesses, and societies. By promoting gender diversity and implementing supportive policies, it is possible to create a more equitable world for all genders. 

== Criticism ==
There has been criticism from some feminists towards the political discourse and policies employed in order to achieve the above items of &quot;progress&quot; in gender equality, with critics arguing that these gender equality strategies are superficial, in that they do not seek to challenge social structures of male domination, and only aim to improve the situation of women within the societal framework of subordination of women to men, and that official public policies (such as state policies or international bodies policies) are questionable, as they are applied in a patriarchal context, and are directly or indirectly controlled by agents of a system which is for the most part male. One of the criticisms of the gender equality policies, in particular, those of the European Union, is that they disproportionately focus on policies integrating women in public life, but do not seek to genuinely address the deep private sphere oppression. A criticism of the Western concept and policies of gender equality relates to the degree to which this approach is able to genuinely address in a successful way the problem of violence against women.

A further criticism is that a focus on the situation of women in non-Western countries, while often ignoring the issues that exist in the West, is a form of imperialism and of reinforcing Western moral superiority; and a way of &quot;othering&quot; of domestic violence, by presenting it as something specific to outsiders – the &quot;violent others&quot; – and not to the allegedly progressive Western cultures. These critics point out that women in Western countries often face similar problems, such as domestic violence and rape, as in other parts of the world. They also cite the fact that women faced de jure legal discrimination until just a few decades ago; for instance, in some Western countries such as Switzerland, Greece, Spain, and France, women obtained equal rights in family law in the 1980s. Another criticism is that there is a selective public discourse with regard to different types of oppression of women, with some forms of violence such as honor killings (most common in certain geographic regions such as parts of Asia and North Africa) being frequently the object of public debate, while other forms of violence, such as the lenient punishment for crimes of passion across Latin America, do not receive the same attention in the West. It is also argued that the criticism of particular laws of many developing countries ignores the influence of colonialism on those legal systems. There has been controversy surrounding the concepts of Westernization and Europeanisation, due to their reminder of past colonialism, and also due to the fact that some Western countries, such as Switzerland, have been themselves been very slow to give women legal rights. There have also been objections to the way Western media presents women from various cultures creating stereotypes, such as that of &#x27;submissive&#x27; Asian or Eastern European women, a stereotype closely connected to the mail order brides industry. Such stereotypes are often blatantly untrue: for instance women in many Eastern European countries occupy a high professional status. Feminists in many developing countries have been strongly opposed to the idea that women in those countries need to be &#x27;saved&#x27; by the West. There are questions on how exactly should gender equality be measured, and whether the West is indeed &quot;best&quot; at it: a study in 2010 found that among the top 20 countries on female graduates in the science fields at university level most countries were countries that were considered internationally to score very low on the position of women&#x27;s rights, with the top 3 being Iran, Saudi Arabia and Oman, and only 5 European countries made it to that top: Romania, Bulgaria, Italy, Georgia and Greece.

Controversy regarding Western cultural influence in the world is not new; in the late 1940s, when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was being drafted, the American Anthropological Association warned that the document would be defining universal rights from a Western perspective which could be detrimental to non-Western countries, and further argued that the West&#x27;s history of colonialism and forceful interference with other societies made them a problematic moral representative for universal global standards.

There has been criticism that international law, international courts, and universal gender neutral concepts of human rights are at best silent on many of the issues important to women and at worst male centered; considering the male person to be the default. Excessive gender neutrality can worsen the situation of women, because the law &quot;assumes&quot; women are in the same position as men, ignoring the biological fact that in the process of reproduction and pregnancy there is no &#x27;equality&#x27;, and that apart from physical differences there are socially constructed limitations which assign a socially and culturally inferior position to women – a situation which requires a specific approach to women&#x27;s rights, not merely a gender neutral one. In a 1975 interview, Simone de Beauvoir talked about the negative reactions towards women&#x27;s rights from the left that was supposed to be progressive and support social change, and also expressed skepticism about mainstream international organizations. There have been questions about the acceptability of international intervention into societal domestic issues from international organizations, especially since the multitude of such international bodies can create confusion, including through contradictory rulings on the same issue: for example the ECtHR upheld in 2014 France&#x27;s ban on wearing a burqa in public, while the United Nations Human Rights Committee concluded in 2018 that France&#x27;s ban on burqa in public violates human rights. International bodies have been criticized for being based on an ideology of one size fits all approach to issues, which does not take into account that a specific approach may work in one culture but not in another, and that historically international intervention into another country has often done more harm than good; and that ultimately the problems from a culture must be solved from within that culture, not through forceful foreign intervention. A criticism of international organizations is that while they purport to support universal global human rights, they often support the interests of Western elites. The legitimacy of international organizations has come into question in the 21st century especially in the light of international scandals, such as child sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers.

<text>The Euratom Treaty, officially the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, established the European Atomic Energy Community. It was signed on 25 March 1957 at the same time as the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (EEC Treaty).

The Euratom Treaty is less well known because of the lower profile of the organisation that it founded. The EEC has evolved into what is now the European Union, but Euratom has remained much the same as it was in 1957 although it is governed by the institutions of the European Union. It was established with its own Commission and Council, but the 1967 Merger Treaty merged these institutions of Euratom and the European Coal and Steel Community with those of the EEC.

The Euratom treaty has seen very little amendment because of later sensitivity surrounding nuclear power in European public opinion. That has caused some to argue that it has become too outdated, particularly in the areas of democratic oversight. It was not included as part of the (unratified) Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, which sought to combine all previous treaties, over fears that including nuclear power in the treaty would turn more people against it. Nevertheless, it is one of the active treaties of the European Union.

<text>The British-Israel-World Federation (also stylized as the British-Israel World Federation) is a United Kingdom-based organization that promotes British Israelism, the historical belief that the people of the British Isles are direct descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of ancient Israel. The group was founded in London on 3 July 1919, although its roots can be traced back to the 19th century.

== Background ==
In the 19th century, much of the British Israel movement was made up of smaller, localized associations. In 1919, some 80 independent associations throughout the British Isles, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Canada, and the United States joined into the British-Israel-World Federation.

The main patron of this movement was HRH The Countess of Athlone. She attended the federation&#x27;s first Congress in July 1920, and remained a patron of the BIWF until her death in January 1981.

One of its founders was Reuben H. Sawyer, a clergyman in Portland, Oregon, where he was involved in setting up an Anglo-Israelism group and as leader of the Oregon Ku Klux Klan. He spoke to the Federation&#x27;s first conference in 1920. Sawyer&#x27;s supremacist views were influential in the development of the anti-semitic Christian Identity movement out of the philo-semitic British Israelism.

William Pascoe Goard was involved in early negotiations of developing the BIWF, and became vice president of the organisation in 1921. In 1922, Goard founded Covenant Publishing, the BIWF&#x27;s publishing company. He also became the first editor of &quot;The National Message&quot;. &quot;The National Message&quot; was published until 1981. The federation now publishes &quot; The Covenant Nations&quot; magazine.

From 1924, the organization maintained an office next to Buckingham Palace. In 1990, it moved to Putney on the Thames, but since 2003 has been based near Bishop Auckland in County Durham.

==Beliefs==

British Israelism (also called Anglo-Israelism) states that people of Western Europe descent, particularly those in Great Britain, are the direct lineal descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. The doctrine often includes the tenet that the British Royal Family is directly descended from the line of King David.

The central tenets of British Israelism have been refuted by evidence from modern genetic, archaeological, ethnological, and linguistics and philological research.

== International endeavors ==
The British-Israel-World Federation, with its headquarters in the United Kingdom, has expanded to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the Netherlands.

<text>The Treaty of Fes (, ), officially the Treaty Concluded Between France and Morocco on 30 March 1912, for the Organization of the French Protectorate in the Sharifian Empire (French: ), was a treaty signed by Sultan Abd al-Hafid of Morocco under duress and French diplomat on 30 March 1912. It established the French protectorate in Morocco, and remained in effect until the Franco-Moroccan Joint Declaration of 2 March 1956.

The treaty gave France the right to occupy certain parts of the country with the pretext of protecting the Sultan from internal opposition, and to hold actual reins of power while preserving the mask of indirect rule consisted of the Sultan and the Sharifian government. Under the terms, the French Resident-General held absolute powers in external as well as internal affairs, and was the only one capable of representing Morocco in foreign countries. The Sultan however, retained the right to sign the decrees (dahirs), which were submitted by the Resident-Generals.

When news of the treaty finally leaked to the Moroccan populace, it was met with immediate and violent backlash in the Intifada of Fes.

== Background ==
=== Context ===
Weakened by defeat in the Franco-Moroccan War, Morocco signed the Anglo-Moroccan Treaty of 1856, which broke the Moroccan state&#x27;s monopoly on customs revenue, a vital source of income for the Makhzen. The Treaty of Wad Ras following the Hispano-Moroccan War (1859–60) forced Morocco to take a massive British loan—larger than its national reserves—in order to pay off a massive war indemnity to Spain, putting the Makhzen further in debt.

European presence in Morocco—in the form of advisors, doctors, businessmen, adventurers, and even missionaries—dramatically increased after the Madrid Conference of 1880, which was held at the behest of Sultan Hassan I in response to France and Spain&#x27;s abuse of the &quot;protégé&quot; system. More than half of the Makhzen&#x27;s expenditures went abroad to pay war indemnities and buy weapons, military equipment, and manufactured goods.

From 1902 to 1909, Morocco&#x27;s trade deficit increased 14 million francs annually, and the Moroccan rial depreciated 25% from 1896 to 1906. Morocco became bridled under loans and debts to balance its budget. The first of these came in December 1901–7.5 million francs borrowed from French banks 6% interest. This was followed by British and Belgian loans. Abdelaziz tried to impose a &quot;tartib&quot; ()—a flat tax universally hated that failed by 1903. In June 1904, France bailed out the Makhzen with 62.5 million franks, guaranteed by a portion of customs revenue.

The Moroccan historian Abdallah Laroui noted: &quot;The more those at the top borrowed, the more those at the bottom were impoverished.&quot; Morocco experienced a famine from 1903 to 1907, as well as insurrections led by El-Rogui (Bou Hmara) and Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni. Abd al-Hafid wrested the throne from his brother Abd al-Aziz in the Hafidiya (1907–1908) coup d&#x27;état.

=== French concessions to competing powers ===
Private agreements among the United Kingdom and France in 1904, collectively known as the Entente Cordiale, made without consulting the sultan, had divided the Maghreb into spheres of influence, with France given Morocco. The 1906 Treaty of Algeciras formalized the French pre-eminence over other European great powers in Morocco, and affirmed its right to collect customs revenue from Moroccan ports.

In the aftermath of the Agadir Crisis of 1911, Germany recognised the French position in Morocco and received in return territories in the French Equatorial Africa the colony of Middle Congo (now the Republic of the Congo). The land, known as Neukamerun, became part of the German colony of Kamerun, part of German West Africa, although it lasted only briefly because it was captured by the Allies during World War I. As part of the treaty, Germany ceded France a small area of territory to the south-east of Fort Lamy, now part of Chad.

=== Makhzen view ===
In Morocco, the young Sultan Abdelaziz acceded in 1894 at the age of 16, Europeans became the main advisers at the court and local rulers became more and more independent from the sultan. Sultan Abdelaziz was deposed in 1908. Moroccan law and order continued to deteriorate under his successor, Abdelhafid, who abdicated in favor of his brother Yusef after signing the Treaty of Fez.

Makhzen officials believed the protectorate system in Morocco would resemble British Egypt, with substantial autonomy in domains such as internal administration and justice. However, the Treaty of Fes was modelled after the Treaty of Bardo of 12 May 1881, which made Tunisia a French protectorate and severely limited the Bey&#x27;s authority.

An interim government, led by Abdelhafid&#x27;s brother, , who was promoted sultan in Meknes on 17 April 1911, also put pressure on Abdelhafid.

Eugène Regnault, &quot;ministre plénipotentiaire&quot; of France in Tangier, arrived in Fes on 24 March after long meetings in Paris with the Treaty of Fes in his possession.

In March 1912, negotiations at the Royal Palace in Fes between Sultan Abd al-Hafid of Morocco and Eugène Regnault were interpreted by Abdelqader Benghabrit, who was then working as the translator at the French Legation in Tangier. The negotiations on 29 March, held with the French military surrounding the city, lasted for 6 hours from 6:00 pm until midnight. They culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Fes, which established the French Protectorate in Morocco on 30 March.

== Effects ==
France gained authority over non-Moroccan citizens in legislative, military, foreign policy and jurisdictional transactions, though nominally leaving the Moroccan government in control of its own citizens. Moroccan nationalists dispute this, noting that France still influenced Moroccan affairs as a result of the treaty.

The Treaty Between France and Spain Regarding Morocco, concluded on 27 November 1912, established the Spanish protectorate in Morocco. By this agreement, Spain gained a zone of influence in the Rif and the Cape Juby areas, where the Sultan remained nominally the sovereign and was represented by a vice regent under the control of the Spanish high commission. The treaty also granted the concession for exploitation of the iron mines of Mount Uixan to the Spanish Rif Mines Company, which was also given permission to build a railroad to connect the mines with Melilla.

== Moroccan reception ==
=== 1912 Fes riots ===
The treaty was kept secret until, on 17 April, the population of Fes learned of it and riots broke out. Abdelhafid had already left Fes seeking safety in Rabat, but the Mellah, or Jewish quarter, of Fes was bombarded by French artillery and then sacked by tribesmen in Fes for the weekly market. After the violence, Resident General Hubert Lyautey decided to make Rabat the capital instead of Fes.

=== Moroccan resistance ===
Moroccan resistance to French colonialism continued after the Treaty of Fes, with the Zaian War and the Rif War, for example.

<doc id="1271946" wikidata="Q6033294" url="?curid=1271946" title="Ingrid Sheldon">
<text>Ingrid Blom Sheldon (born 1945) is an American politician who served as the 59th mayor of Ann Arbor, Michigan from 1993 to 2000. A moderate Republican, she served four two-year terms in the post. To date, Sheldon remains the city&#x27;s last Republican mayor.

==Education==
Sheldon earned a Bachelor of Science in education from Eastern Michigan University and a master&#x27;s in education from the University of Michigan. Sheldon then worked as a sixth grade teacher for three years.

== Career ==
Sheldon became involved in city government during these years, and first ran for elected office in 1988, when she was elected to the city council as a Republican.

Four years later, Sheldon ran for mayor against incumbent Democrat Liz Brater. The campaign was seen as one of Ann Arbor&#x27;s more divisive mayoral contests of recent years. Sheldon defeated Brater in the April 5, 1993 election. Sheldon won reelection over Democratic challenger David F. Stead in November 1994.

In Sheldon&#x27;s reelection campaigns of 1996 and 1998, she won narrowly against Ann Arbor city councilman Chris Kolb. Sheldon left office in 2000 when she decided not to run for re-election, and was succeeded by Democrat John Hieftje.

As a Republican mayor in an overwhelmingly Democratic city, and facing large Democratic majorities on the city council throughout her tenure, Sheldon took a moderate approach to governance. Like many Ann Arbor Republicans, she was a fiscal conservative and a social liberal.

During her years as mayor, Sheldon served on the board of the Michigan Association of Mayors, and served as president of the Michigan Municipal League. She chaired the league&#x27;s Let Local Votes Count campaign, an attempt in 2000 to pass a state initiative that would limit the state government&#x27;s ability to overturn local municipalities&#x27; ordinances.

Since leaving office, Sheldon has been involved with a number of local nonprofit organizations, including the Ann Arbor Summer Festival and the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre. Sheldon discusses her childhood and experiences as mayor in an essay in the book &quot;Ann Arbor (W)rites: A Community Memoir.&quot;

Sheldon remains an active member of the Ann Arbor community, including working as a bookkeeper at a tennis club.

== Personal life ==
Sheldon&#x27;s husband, Cliff Sheldon, served as a member of the Ann Arbor city council from 1978 to 1982. She has two children and six grandchildren.

<doc id="1271947" wikidata="Q3517986" url="?curid=1271947" title="First-wave feminism">
<text>First-wave feminism was a period of feminist activity and thought that occurred during the 19th and early 20th century throughout the Western world. It focused on legal issues, primarily on securing women&#x27;s right to vote. The term is often used synonymously with the kind of feminism espoused by the liberal women&#x27;s rights movement with roots in the first wave, with organizations such as the International Alliance of Women and its affiliates. This feminist movement still focuses on equality from a mainly legal perspective.

The term &quot;first-wave feminism&quot; itself was coined by journalist Martha Lear in a &quot;New York Times Magazine&quot; article in March 1968, &quot;The Second Feminist Wave: What do these women want?&quot; First- wave feminism is characterized as focusing on the fight for women&#x27;s political power, as opposed to &quot;de facto&quot; unofficial inequalities. The first wave of feminism generally advocated for formal equality, while later waves typically advocated for substantive equality. The wave metaphor is well established, including in academic literature, but has been criticized for creating a narrow view of women&#x27;s liberation that erases the lineage of activism and focuses on specific visible actors. The term &quot;first-wave&quot; and, more broadly, the wave model have been questioned when referencing women&#x27;s movements in non-Western contexts because the periodization and the development of the terminology were entirely based on the happenings of Western feminism and thus cannot be applied to non-Western events in an exact manner. However, women participating in political activism for gender equity modeled their plans on western feminists demands for legal rights. This is connected to the Western first-wave and occurred in the late 19th century and continued into the 1930s in connection to the anti-colonial nationalist movement.

== Global terminologies ==
The issues of inclusion that began during the first-wave of the feminist movement in the United States and persisted throughout subsequent waves of feminism are the topic of much discussion on an academic level. Some scholars find the wave model of western feminism to be troubling because it condenses a long history of activism into distinct categories that characterize generations of activists instead of acknowledging a complex, interconnected, and intersectional history of women&#x27;s rights. This is thought to diminish the struggles and achievements of many people as well as worsen the separations between marginalized feminists. The points of contention that persist in modern discussions of Western and global feminism began with the inequity that hallmarked first-wave feminism. The way in which the west has been oriented as an authority in global feminist discussions has been criticized by feminists in the United States such as bell hooks for replicating colonial hierarchies of discussion, possession of knowledge and centering gender as the foundation of equality. The idea of decolonizing feminism is a response to the political and intellectual position of power western feminism holds. By acknowledging that there are multiple feminisms around the world the narrow scope and lack of consideration for intersectional identities that has persisted since first-wave feminism in the west is responded to. The existence of multiple feminisms and forms of activism is a result of the first-wave of feminism being shaped by a history of colonialism and imperialism.

==Origins==
Movements to broaden women&#x27;s rights began much earlier than the 20th century. In her book &quot;The Second Sex,&quot; Simone de Beauvoir wrote that the first woman to &quot;take up her pen in defense of her sex&quot; was Christine de Pizan in the 15th century. Other &quot;proto-feminists&quot; working in the 15th-17th centuries include Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi, Anne Bradstreet and François Poullain de la Barre. Ancient literature and mythology such as Euripides&#x27; Medea have become closely associated with the feminist movement and have been interpreted as icons of feminism. Ancient literature plays an important role in feminist theory and scholarly study. Olympe de Gouges is regarded as one of the first feminists. She published a pamphlet named &quot;Déclaration des Droits de la Femme et de la Citoyenne&quot; (&quot;Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the [Female] Citizen&quot;) as a response to &quot;Déclaration des Droits de l&#x27;Homme et du Citoyen&quot; (&quot;Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the [Male] Citizen&quot;) in 1791.

=== Wollstonecraft ===
The period in which Mary Wollstonecraft wrote was affected by Rousseau and the philosophy of the Enlightenment. The father of the Enlightenment defined an ideal democratic society that was based on the equality of men, where women were often discriminated against. The inherent exclusion of women from discussion was addressed by both Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries. Wollstonecraft based her work on the ideas of Rousseau. Although at first it seems to be contradictory, Wollstonecraft&#x27;s idea was to expand Rousseau&#x27;s democratic society but based on gender equality. Mary Wollstonecraft spoke boldly on the inclusion of women in the public lifestyle; more specifically, narrowing down on the importance of female education. She took the term &#x27;liberal feminism&#x27; and devoted her time to breaking through the traditional gender roles.

Wollstonecraft published one of the first feminist treatises, &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792), in which she advocated the social and moral equality of the sexes, extending the work of her 1790 pamphlet, &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Men&quot;. Her later unfinished novel, &quot;&quot;, earned her considerable criticism as she discussed women&#x27;s sexual desires. She died young, and her widower, the philosopher William Godwin, quickly wrote a memoir of her that, contrary to his intentions, destroyed her reputation for generations.

Wollstonecraft is regarded as the &quot;fore-mother&quot; of the British feminist movement and her ideas shaped the thinking of the suffragettes, who campaigned for the women&#x27;s vote.


== Education ==
Education amongst young Swiss women was very important during the suffrage movements. Educating young women in society on the importance of self-identity, and going to school was very important to the public and for women to realize what their full potential was. The Swiss suffrage movements believed it was important for young women to know that there was more to their life than just bearing children, which was a very universal thought and action during the suffrage movements in the 1960s and 70s. In a 2015 evaluation from Lord David Willetts, he had discovered and stated that in 2013 the percentage of undergraduate students in the UK were 54 percent females and 46 percent were male undergrads. Whereas in the 1960s only 25 percent of full-time students in the United Kingdom were females. The increase of females going to school and contributing in the educational system can be linked to the women&#x27;s suffrage movements that aimed to encourage women to enroll in school for higher education. This right and political affair eventually came after the right for women to vote in political elections which was granted in 1971. In the 1960s in the United Kingdom, women were usually the minority and a rarity when it came to the higher education system.

== Country ==
===Argentina===

During the last decade of the nineteenth century and the first of the twentieth century, women in Argentina organized and consolidated one of the most complex feminist movements of the western world. Closely associated with the labor movement, they were socialists, anarchists, libertarians, emancipatorians, educationists and Catholics. In May 1910 they organized together the First International Feminist Congress. Well known European, Latin, and North American workers, intellectuals, thinkers and professionals like Marie Curie, Emilia Pardo Bazán, Ellen Key, Maria Montessori and many others presented and discussed their ideas research work and studies on themes of gender, political and civil right, divorce, economy, education, health and culture.

=== Australia ===

In 1882, Rose Scott, a women&#x27;s rights activist, began to hold weekly salon meetings in her Sydney home left to her by her late mother. Through these meetings, she became well known amongst politicians, judges, philanthropists, writers and poets. In 1889, she helped to found the Women&#x27;s Literary Society, which later grew into the Womanhood Suffrage League in 1891. Leading politicians hosted by Scott included Bernhard Wise, William Holman, William Morris Hughes and Thomas Bavin, who met and discussed the drafting of the bill that eventually became the Early Closing Act of 1899.

=== Canada ===
Canada&#x27;s first-wave of feminism became apparent in the late 19th century into the early 20th. The build up of women&#x27;s movements started as consciously raising awareness, then turned into study groups, and resulted into taking action by forming committees. The premise of the movement began around education issues. The particular reason education is targeted as a high priority is because it can target younger generations and modify their gender-based opinions. In 1865 the superintendent of an Ontario public school, Egerton Ryerson, was one of the first to point out the exclusion of females from the education system. As more females attended school throughout the years, they surpassed the male graduation rate. In 1880 British Columbia, 51% high school graduates were female. These percentages continued to increase right through to 1950. Other reasons for the first feminist movement involved women&#x27;s suffrage, and labour and health rights; thus, feminists narrowed their campaigns to focus on gaining legal and political equity. Canada took action in the International Council of Women and has a specific section called the National Council of Women in Canada, with its president, Lady Aberdeen. Women started to look outside of groups such as garden and music clubs, and dive into reforms furthering better education and suffrage. It was behind the idea that the women would be more powerful if they joined to create a united voice.

===China===
In the 1880s and 1890s, both male and female Chinese reformist intellectuals, concerned with the development of China to a modern country, raised feminist issues and gender equality in public debate; schools for girls were founded, a feminist press emerged, and the Foot Emancipation Society and Tian Zu Hui, promoting the abolition of foot binding.

Many changes in women&#x27;s lives took place during the Republic of China (1912–1949). In 1912, the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Alliance, an umbrella organization of many local women&#x27;s organizations, was founded to work for the inclusion of women&#x27;s equal rights and suffrage in the constitution of the new republic after the abolition of the monarchy, and while the effort was not successful, it signified an important period of feminism activism. 
A generation of educated and professional new women emerged after the inclusion of girls in the state school system and after women students were accted at the University of Beijing in 1920, and in the 1931 Civil Code, women were given equal inheritance rights, banned forced marriage and gave women the right to control their own money and initiate divorce.
No nationally unified women&#x27;s movement could organize until China was unified under the Kuomintang Government in Nanjing in 1928; women&#x27;s suffrage was finally included in the new Constitution of 1936, although the constitution was not implemented until 1947.

===Denmark===
The first women&#x27;s movement was led by the &quot;Dansk Kvindesamfund&quot; (&quot;Danish Women&#x27;s Society&quot;), founded in 1871. Line Luplau was one of the most notable woman in this era. Tagea Brandt was also part of this movement, and in her honor was established the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat or Travel Scholarship for women. The Dansk Kvindesamfund&#x27;s efforts as a leading group of women for women led to the existence of the revised Danish constitution of 1915, giving women the right to vote and the provision of equal opportunity laws during the 1920s, which influenced the present-day legislative measures to grant women access to education, work, marital rights and other obligations.

===Finland===

In the mid 19th-century, Minna Canth first started to address feminist issues in public debate, such as women&#x27;s education and sexual double standards. The Finnish women&#x27;s movement organized with the foundation of the Suomen Naisyhdistys in 1884, which was the first feminist women&#x27;s organisation in Finland. This represented the first wave feminism. The Suomen Naisyhdistys was split into the Naisasialiitto Unioni (1892) and the Suomalainen naisliitto (1907), and all women&#x27;s organisations were united under the umbrella organisation Naisjärjestöjen Keskusliitto in 1911.

Women where granted their basic equal rights early on with the suffrage in 1906. After the introduction of women&#x27;s suffrage, the women&#x27;s movement was mainly channelled through the women&#x27;s branches of the political parties. The new marriage law of 1929, &quot;Avioliittolaki&quot;, finally established complete equality for married women, and after this, women were legally equal to men by law in Finland.

===France=== 
The issue of women&#x27;s rights were discussed during the Age of Enlightenment and the French Revolution. Some success was achieved by the new inheritance rights (Loi sur l&#x27;héritage des enfants) and the divorce law (Loi autorisant le divorce en France).

A movement that brought feminism into play happened during the same time a republican form of government came to replace the classic Catholic monarchy. A few females took on leadership roles to form groups divided by financial stability, religion, and social status. One of these groups, the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, managed to draw significant interest within the national political scene, and advocated for gender equality in revolutionary politics. Another such group were Société fraternelle des patriotes de l&#x27;un et l&#x27;autre sexe. These groups were driven to increase economic opportunities by hosting meetings, writing journals, and forming organizations with the same means.

However, the Code Napoléon of 1804 eradicated the progress made during the revolution. Women&#x27;s rights were supported by the rule of the Communist Paris Commune of 1870, but the rule of the Commune came to be temporary.

An 1897 newspaper, La Fronde, was the most prestigious women-run newspaper. It maintained as a daily paper for 6 years and covered controversial topics such as the working women and advocating for women&#x27;s political rights.

The First wave women&#x27;s movement in France organized when the &quot;Association pour le Droit des Femmes&quot; was founded by Maria Deraismes and Léon Richer in 1870. It was followed by the &quot;Ligue Française pour le Droit des Femmes&quot; (1882) which took up the issue of women suffrage and became the leading suffrage society in parallel to the &quot;Union française pour le suffrage des femmes&quot; (1909-1945).

===Germany===

The First wave women&#x27;s movement in Germany organized under the influence of the Revolutions of 1848. It organized for the first time in the first women&#x27;s organization in Germany, the &quot;Allgemeiner Deutscher Frauenverein&quot; (ADF), which was founded by Louise Otto-Peters and Auguste Schmidt in Leipzig 1865.

Women in the middle class sought improvements in their social status and prospects in society. A humanist aspiration connected the women together as they wanted to identify and be respected as full individuals. They were drawn into the socialist political struggles of the revolution because they were promised full equity afterwards. The agenda of women&#x27;s improvements consisted of gaining rights to work, education, abortion, contraception, and the right to seek a profession. The premise of German feminism was revolved around the political common good, including social justice and family values. The pressure women put on society led to women&#x27;s suffrage in 1918. This created further feminist movements to expand women&#x27;s rights.

In comparison to the United States, German feminism targets a collective representation and women&#x27;s autonomy whereas the American feminism is focused on general equality.

=== The Netherlands===

Although in the Netherlands during the Age of Enlightenment the idea of the equality of women and men made progress, no practical institutional measures or legislation resulted. In the second half of the nineteenth century, many initiatives by feminists sprung up in The Netherlands.

Aletta Jacobs (1854–1929) requested and obtained as the first woman in the Netherlands the right to study at university in 1871, becoming the first female medical doctor and academic. She became a lifelong campaigner for women&#x27;s suffrage, equal rights, birth control, and international peace, travelling worldwide for, e.g., the International Alliance of Women.

Wilhelmina Drucker (1847–1925) was a politician, a prolific writer and a peace activist, who fought for the vote and equal rights through political and feminist organisations she founded. In 1917–1919, her goal of women&#x27;s suffrage was reached.

Cornelia Ramondt-Hirschmann (1871–1951), President of the Dutch Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom [WILPF].

Selma Meyer (1890–1941), Secretary of the Dutch Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom [WILPF]

=== New Zealand ===
Early New Zealand feminists and suffragettes included Maud Pember Reeves (Australian-born; later lived in London), Kate Sheppard and Mary Ann Müller. In 1893, Elizabeth Yates became Mayor of Onehunga, the first time such a post had been held by a female anywhere in the British Empire. Early university graduates were Emily Siedeberg (doctor, graduated 1895) and Ethel Benjamin (lawyer, graduated 1897). The Female Law Practitioners Act was passed in 1896 and Benjamin was admitted as a barrister and solicitor of the Supreme Court of New Zealand in 1897 (see Women&#x27;s suffrage in New Zealand).

===Norway=== 
The First wave women&#x27;s movement in Norway organized when the Norwegian Association for Women&#x27;s Rights was founded in 1884.

===Russia===

In Imperial Russia, it was not legal to form political organisations prior to the 1905 Russian Revolution. Because of this, there was no open organised women&#x27;s rights movement similar to the one in the West before this. There was, however, in practice a women&#x27;s movement during the 19th century.

In the mid-19th century, several literary discussion clubs were founded, one of whom, which was co-founded by Anna Filosofova, Maria Trubnikova and Nadezjda Stasova, which discussed Western feminist literature and came to be the first de facto women&#x27;s rights organisation in Russia. The Crimean War had exposed Russia as less developed than Western Europe, resulting in a number of reforms, among them educational reforms and the foundation of schools for girls. Russian elite women de facto spoke for reforms in women rights through their literary clubs and charity societies. Their main interest were women&#x27;s education- and work opportunities. The women&#x27;s club of Anna Filosofova, Maria Trubnikova and Nadezjda Stasova managed to achieve women&#x27;s access to attend courses at the universities, and the separate courses held for women became so popular that they were made permanent in 1876. However, in 1876 women students were banned from being given degrees and all women&#x27;s universities were banned except two (Bestuzhev Courses in Saint Petserburg and Guerrier Courses in Moscow).

In 1895, Anna Filosofova founded the &quot;Russian Women&#x27;s Charity League&quot;, which was officially a charitable society to avoid the ban of political organisations but which was in effect a women&#x27;s rights organisation: Anna Filosofova was elected to the International Council of Women in 1899. Because of the ban of political activity in Russia the only thing they could do was to raise awareness of feminist issues.

After the 1905 Russian Revolution, political organisations was made legal in Russia and the women&#x27;s movement was able to organise in the form of &quot;Liga ravnopraviia zhenshchin&quot;, which started a campaign of women&#x27;s suffrage the same year. The Russian Revolution of 1917 formally made men and women equal in the eyes of the law in the Soviet Union.

===South Korea===

The Korean women&#x27;s movement started in the 1890s with the foundation of Chanyang-hoe, followed by a number of other groups, primarily focused on women&#x27;s education and the abolition of gender segregation and other didscriminatory practices.

When Korea became a Japanese colony in 1910 women&#x27;s associations were banned by the Japanese and many women instead engaged in the underground resistance groups such as the Yosong Aeguk Tongji-hoe (Patriotic Women&#x27;s Society) and the Taehan Aeguk Buin-hoe (Korean Patriotic Women&#x27;s Society). 

After the end of the War and the partition of Korea in 1945, the Korean women&#x27;s movement was split. In North Korea, all women&#x27;s movement was channelled in to the Korean Democratic Women&#x27;s Union; in South Korea, the women&#x27;s movement where united under the Korean National Council of Women in 1959, which in 1973 organized the women&#x27;s group in the Pan-Women&#x27;s Society for the Revision of the Family Law to revise the discriminating Family Law of 1957, a cause that remained a main focus for the rest of the 20th-century and did not result in any major reform until 1991.

===Sweden===

Feminist issues and gender roles were discussed in media and literature during the 18th century by people such as Margareta Momma, Catharina Ahlgren, Anna Maria Rückerschöld and Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, but it created no movement of any kind. The first person to hold public speeches and agitate in favor of feminism was Sophie Sager in 1848, and the first organization created to deal with a women&#x27;s issue was &quot;Svenska lärarinnors pensionsförening&quot; (Society for Retired Female Teachers) by Josefina Deland in 1855.

In 1856, Fredrika Bremer published her famous &quot;Hertha&quot;, which aroused great controversy and created a debate referred to as the &quot;Hertha Debate&quot;. The two foremost questions was to abolish coverture for unmarried women, and for the state to provide women an equivalent to a university. Both questions were met: in 1858, a reform granted unmarried women the right to apply for legal majority by a simple procedure, and in 1861, Högre lärarinneseminariet was founded as a &quot;Women&#x27;s University&quot;. In 1859, the first women&#x27;s magazine in Sweden and the Nordic countries, the &quot;Tidskrift för hemmet&quot;, was founded by Sophie Adlersparre and Rosalie Olivecrona. This has been referred to as the starting point of a women&#x27;s movement in Sweden.

The organized women&#x27;s movement begun in 1873, when Married Woman&#x27;s Property Rights Association was co-founded by Anna Hierta-Retzius and Ellen Anckarsvärd. The prime task of the organization was to abolish coverture. In 1884, Fredrika Bremer Association was founded by Sophie Adlersparre to work for the improvement in women&#x27;s rights. The second half of the 19th century saw the creation of several women&#x27;s rights organisations and a considerable activity within both active organization as well as intellectual debate. The 1880s saw the so-called &quot;Sedlighetsdebatten&quot;, where gender roles were discussed in literary debate in regards to sexual double standards in opposed to sexual equality. In 1902, finally, the National Association for Women&#x27;s Suffrage was founded.

In 1919–1921, women&#x27;s suffrage was finally introduced. The women suffrage reform was followed by the &quot;Behörighetslagen&quot; of 1923, in which males and females were formally given equal access to all professions and positions in society, the only exceptions being military and priesthood positions. The last two restrictions were removed in 1958, when women were allowed to become priests, and in a series of reforms between 1980 and 1989, when all military professions were opened to women.

=== Switzerland ===

The Swiss women&#x27;s movement started to form after the introduction of the Constitution of 1848, which explicitly excluded women&#x27;s rights and equality. However, the Swiss women&#x27;s movement was long prevented from being efficient by the split between French- and German speaking areas, which restricted it to local activity. This split created a long lasting obstacle for the national Swiss women&#x27;s movement. However, it did play an important role in the international women&#x27;s movement, when Marie Goegg-Pouchoulin founded the first international women&#x27;s movement in the world, the &quot;Association Internationale des Femmes&quot;, in 1868.

In 1885, the first national women&#x27;s organisation, the &quot;Schweizer Frauen-Verband&quot;, was founded by Elise Honegger. It soon split, but in 1888, the first permanent, national women&#x27;s organisation was finally founded in the &quot;Schweizerischen Gemeinnützigen Frauenverein&quot; (SGF), which became an umbrella organisation for the Swiss women&#x27;s movement. From 1893 onward, a local women&#x27;s organisation, the Frauenkomitee Bern, also functioned as a channel between the Federal government and the Swiss women&#x27;s movements. The question of women&#x27;s suffrage in Switzerland was brought forward by the &quot;Schweizerischer Frauenvereine&quot; from 1899, and by the &quot;Schweizerischer Verband für Frauenstimmrecht&quot; from 1909, which were to become the two main suffrage organisations of many in Switzerland.

The Swiss suffrage movement had struggled for equality in their society for decades until the early 1970s; this wave of feminism also included enfranchisement. October 31, 1971, Swiss women were granted the right to vote in political elections. According to Lee Ann Banaszak the main reasons for lack of success in women&#x27;s suffrage for Swiss women was due to the differences in mobilization of members into suffrage organizations, financial resources of the suffrage movements, alliances formed with other political actors, and the characteristics of the political systems. Therefore, the success of the Swiss women&#x27;s suffrage movement was heavily affected by the resources and political structures. &quot;The Swiss movement had to operate in a system where decisions were made carefully by a constructed consensus and where opposition parties never launched an electoral challenge that might of prodded governing parties into action.&quot; This explains how the closed legislative process made it way more difficult for suffrage activists to participate in, or even track women&#x27;s voting rights. Swiss suffrage also lacked strong allies when it came from their struggle to vote in political elections. The 1970s saw a turning point for Swiss feminist movements, and they began to steadily make more progress in their struggle for equality to present day.

=== United Kingdom ===

The early feminist reformers were unorganized, and including prominent individuals who had suffered as victims of injustice. This included individuals such as Caroline Norton whose personal tragedy where she was unable to obtain a divorce and was denied access to her three sons by her husband, led her to a life of intense campaigning which successfully led to the passing of the Custody of Infants Act 1839 and the introduction of the Tender years doctrine for child custody arrangement. The Act gave married women, for the first time, a right to their children. However, because women needed to petition in the Court of Chancery, in practice, few women had the financial means to petition for their rights.

The first organized movement for English feminism was the Langham Place Circle of the 1850s, which included among others Barbara Bodichon (née Leigh-Smith) and Bessie Rayner Parkes. The group campaigned for many women&#x27;s causes, including improved female rights in employment, and education. It also pursued women&#x27;s property rights through its Married Women&#x27;s Property Committee. In 1854, Bodichon published her &quot;Brief Summary of the Laws of England concerning Women&quot;, which was used by the Social Science Association after it was formed in 1857 to push for the passage of the Married Women&#x27;s Property Act 1882. In 1858, Barbara Bodichon, Matilda Mary Hays and Bessie Rayner Parkes established the first feminist British periodical, the &quot;English Woman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, with Bessie Parkes the chief editor. The journal continued publication until 1864 and was succeeded in 1866 by the &quot;Englishwoman&#x27;s Review&quot; edited until 1880 by Jessie Boucherett which continued publication until 1910. Jessie Boucherett and Adelaide Anne Proctor joined the Langham Place Circle in 1859. The group was active until 1866. Also in 1859, Jessie Boucherett, Barbara Bodichon and Adelaide Proctor formed the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women to promote the training and employment of women. The society is one of the earliest British women&#x27;s organisations, and continues to operate as the registered charity &quot;Futures for Women&quot;. Helen Blackburn and Boucherett established the Women&#x27;s Employment Defence League in 1891, to defend women&#x27;s working rights against restrictive employment legislation. They also together edited the &quot;Condition of Working Women and the Factory Acts&quot; in 1896. In the beginning of the 20th century, women&#x27;s employment was still predominantly limited to factory labor and domestic work. During World War I, more women found work outside the home. As a result of the wartime experience of women in the workforce, the &quot;Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919&quot; opened professions and the civil service to women, and marriage was no longer a legal barrier to women working outside the home.

In 1918, Marie Stopes published the very influential &quot;Married Love&quot;, in which she advocated gender equality in marriage and the importance of women&#x27;s sexual desire. (Importation of the book into the United States was banned as obscene until 1931.)

The &quot;Representation of the People Act 1918&quot; extended the franchise to women who were at least 30 years old and they or their husbands were property holders, while the &quot;Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918&quot; gave women the right to sit in Parliament, although it was only slowly that women were actually elected. In 1928, the franchise was extended to all women over 21 by the &quot;Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928&quot;, on an equal basis to men.

Many feminist writers and women&#x27;s rights activists argued that it was not equality to men which they needed but a recognition of what women need to fulfill their potential of their own natures, not only within the aspect of work but society and home life too. Virginia Woolf produced her essay &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot; based on the ideas of women as writers and characters in fiction. Woolf said that a woman must have money and a room of her own to be able to write.

It ought to be recognized that the early British feminist movement was deeply intertwined with the British imperial project and an essential arm of it. Contemporary writers like Mona Caird asserted that women deserved representation in the &quot;councils of the nation&quot; as defenders of the white race and its supremacy. In order to achieve status and value as women, these feminists framed themselves as the benevolent feminine liberators of the &quot;foreign woman&quot;. Antoinette Burton writes that rather than upending Victorian gendered assumptions, &quot;early feminist theorist used [them] to justify female involvement in the public sphere by claiming that the woman&#x27;s moral attributes was crucial to social improvement.&quot; Burton calls to our attention that women exerted real power over their male counterparts by making claims to the very moral assumptions that bound them to the home. It would be naïve to suggest that these women were not complicit in or did not contribute to imperial oppression abroad, but what is missed by previous treatments of feminisms and feminist movements is the diversity and flexibility of power relationships that navigated the superstructure of the moral order. The place of sex and gender in Victorian society was more diverse and plural than Victorian morality imagined for itself.

=== United States ===

The beginning of first-wave Feminism in the United States is traditionally marked by the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848; however this event was empowered by women becoming increasingly politically active in the years leading up to 1848 through the Abolitionist Movement and Temperance Movement and activists began to have their voices heard. Some of these early activists include, Sojourner Truth, Elizabeth Blackwell, Jane Addams, and Dorothy Day. The first wave of feminism was primarily led by white women in the middle class, and it was not until the second wave of feminism that women of color began developing a voice. The term Feminism was created like a political illustrated ideology at that period. Feminism emerged by the speech about the reform and correction of democracy based on equalitarian conditions.

Leading up to the early 19th century, white women in Colonial America were socially expected to remain domestically confined and their property and political rights were severely limited and controlled by marriage. Social expectations preceding and following the American Revolution did not encourage women to be politically active or seek formal education. Women were also expected to pass on and teach Christian values to their children. Thus the impact of alcohol on many men post Civil War became not only a moral motivation for women to become active in the Temperance Movement but also a way to exert control over finances and property. Communities of women in churches congregated and rallied outside of the home for the cause. The most direct and impactful movement on first-wave feminism was the Abolitionist Movement. Black men and women had been fighting for rights during and before the Temperance Movement. White women began to identify themselves with the struggle for rights and became involved in the abolition of slavery.

Judith Sargent Murray published the early and influential essay &quot;On the Equality of the Sexes&quot; in 1790, blaming poor standards in female education as the root of women&#x27;s problems. However, scandals surrounding the personal lives of English contemporaries Catharine Macaulay and Mary Wollstonecraft pushed feminist authorship into private correspondence from the 1790s through the early decades of the nineteenth century. Feminist essays from John Neal in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;The Yankee&quot; in the 1820s filled an intellectual gap between Murray and the leaders of the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention, which is generally considered the beginning of the first wave of feminism. As a male writer insulated from many common forms of attack against female feminist thinkers, Neal&#x27;s advocacy was crucial to bringing feminism back into the American mainstream.

&quot;Woman in the Nineteenth Century&quot; by Margaret Fuller has been considered the first major feminist work in the United States and is often compared to Wollstonecraft&#x27;s &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;. Prominent leaders of the feminist movement in the United States include Lucretia Coffin Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucy Stone, and Susan B. Anthony; Anthony and other activists such as Victoria Woodhull and Matilda Joslyn Gage made attempts to cast votes prior to their legal entitlement to do so, for which many of them faced charges. Other important leaders included several women who dissented against the law in order to have their voices heard, (Sarah and Angelina Grimké), in addition to other activists such as Carrie Chapman Catt, Alice Paul, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells, Margaret Sanger and Lucy Burns.

First-wave feminism involved a wide range of women, some belonging to conservative Christian groups (such as Frances Willard and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union), others such as Matilda Joslyn Gage of the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) resembling the radicalism of much of second-wave feminism. The creation of these organizations was a direct result of the Second Great Awakening, a religious movement in the early 19th century, that inspired female reformers in the United States.

The majority of first-wave feminists were more moderate and conservative than radical or revolutionary—like the members of the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) they were willing to work within the political system and they understood the clout of joining with sympathetic men in power to promote the cause of suffrage. The limited membership of the NWSA was narrowly focused on gaining a federal amendment for women&#x27;s suffrage, whereas the AWSA, with ten times as many members, worked to gain suffrage on a state-by-state level as a necessary precursor to federal suffrage. The NWSA had broad goals, hoping to achieve a more equal social role for women, but the AWSA was aware of the divisive nature of many of those goals and instead chose to focus solely on suffrage. The NWSA was known for having more publicly aggressive tactics (such as picketing and hunger strikes) whereas the AWSA used more traditional strategies like lobbying, delivering speeches, applying political pressure, and gathering signatures for petitions.

During the first wave, there was a notable connection between the slavery abolition movement and the women&#x27;s rights movement. Frederick Douglass was heavily involved in both movements and believed that it was essential for both to work together in order to attain true equality in regards to race and sex. Different accounts of the involvement of African-American women in the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Movement are given. In a 1974 interview, Alice Paul notes that a compromise was made between southern groups to have white women march first, then men, then African-American women. In another account by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), difficulties in segregating women resulted in African-American women marching with their respective States without hindrance. Among them was Ida B. Wells-Barnett, who marched with the Illinois delegation.

The end of the first wave is often linked with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1920), granting women the right to vote. This was the major victory of the movement, which also included reforms in higher education, in the workplace and professions, and in health care.
Women started serving on school boards and local bodies, and numbers kept increasing. This period also saw more women gaining access to higher education. In 1910, &quot;women were attending many leading medical schools, and in 1915, the American Medical Association began to admit women members.&quot; A &quot;Matrimonial Causes Act 1923&quot; gave women the right to the same grounds for divorce as men. The first wave of feminists, in contrast to the second wave, focused very little on the subjects of abortion, birth control, and overall reproductive rights of women. Though she never married, Anthony published her views about marriage, holding that a woman should be allowed to refuse sex with her husband; the American woman had no legal recourse at that time against rape by her husband.

The rise in unemployment during the Great Depression which started in the 1920s hit women first, and when the men also lost their jobs there was further strain on families. Many women served in the armed forces during World War II, when around 300,000 American women served in the navy and army, performing jobs such as secretaries, typists and nurses.

==== State laws ====
The American states are separate sovereigns, with their own state constitutions, state governments, and state courts. All states have a legislative branch which enacts state statutes, an executive branch that promulgates state regulations pursuant to statutory authorization, and a judicial branch that applies, interprets, and occasionally overturns both state statutes and regulations, as well as local ordinances. States retain plenary power to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate. Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state institutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of certiorari. State laws have dramatically diverged in the centuries since independence, to the extent that the United States cannot be regarded as one legal system as to the majority of types of law traditionally under state control, but must be regarded as 50 &quot;separate&quot; systems of tort law, family law, property law, contract law, criminal law, and so on.

Marylynn Salmon argues that each state developed different ways of dealing with a variety of legal issues pertaining to women, especially in the case of property laws. In 1809, Connecticut was the first state to pass a law allowing women to write wills.

In 1860, New York passed a revised Married Women&#x27;s Property Act which gave women shared ownership of their children, allowing them to have a say in their children&#x27;s wills, wages, and granting them the right to inherit property. Further advances and setbacks were experienced in New York and other states, but with each new win the feminists were able to use it as an example to apply more leverage on unyielding legislative bodies.

==== White feminism====
=====Imperialism=====

Anxiety in the United States over the moral degeneracy and temptation of American men in the Philippines inspired women&#x27;s involvement in the politics of the colonial government. An article published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1900 describes the Philippines as an environment where relatively permissive conceptions of morality caused white men to &quot;lose all notions of right and wrong&quot;. It was said that white men &quot;disgraced the offices to which they had been appointed&quot;, and that, despite having left their homes &quot;with records that were above reproach&quot;, they were &quot;degenerated by the conditions of their new existence&quot;. Away from the social pressures imposed by their community, they did not possess the strength of moral character or principle needed to maintain the &quot;social discipline&quot;.

White women feminists, in this historical context, asserted their superiority over white men and brown women. They have in been criticized by modern women writers of color like Valerie Amos and Pratibha Parmar.

=====Inequality=====
In the First Wave context, there are two different fights for the equal rights of white women and black women. White women were fighting for rights equal to white men in society. They wanted to correct the discrepancy in education, professional, property, economic, and voting rights. They also fought for birth control and abortion freedom. Black women, on the other hand, were facing both racism and sexism, contributing to an uphill struggle for black feminists. While White women could not vote, black women &quot;and&quot; men could not vote. Mary J. Garrett who founded a group consisting of hundreds of Black women in New Orleans, said that black women strove for education and protection. It is true that &quot;black women in higher education are isolated, underutilized, and often demoralized,&quot; and they fought together against this. They were fighting against &quot;exploitation by White men&quot; and they wanted to &quot;lead a virtuous and industrious life.&quot; Black women were also fighting for their husbands, families, and overall equality and freedom of their civil rights. Racism restricted white and black women from coming together to fight for common societal transformation.

First Wave Feminism in the United States did not chronicle the contributions of black women to the same degree as white women. Activists, including Susan B. Anthony and other feminist leaders preached for equality between genders; however, they disregarded equality between a number of other issues, including race. This allowed for white women to gain power and equality relative to white men, while the social disparity between white and black women increased. The exclusion aided the growing prevalence of White supremacy, specifically white feminism while actively overlooking the severity of impact black feminists had on the movement.

Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton were abolitionists but they did not advocate for universal suffrage. They did not want black men to be granted the right to vote before white women. The National American Woman Suffrage Association was created to distinguish themselves from advocating for black men to vote. The Fifteenth Amendment states no person should be denied the right to vote based on race. Anthony and Stanton opposed passage of the amendment unless it was accompanied by a Sixteenth Amendment that would guarantee suffrage for women. Otherwise, they said, it would create an &quot;aristocracy of sex&quot; by giving constitutional authority to the belief that men were superior to women. The new proposal of this amendment was named the &quot;Anthony Amendment&quot;. Stanton once said that allowing black men to vote before women &quot;creates an antagonism between black men and all women that will culminate in fearful outrages on womanhood&quot;. Anthony stated, she would &quot;cut off this right arm of mine before I will ever work for or demand the ballot for the negro and not the woman&quot;. Mary Church Terrell exclaimed in 1904 that, &quot;My sisters of the dominant race, stand up not only for the oppressed sex, but also for the oppressed race!&quot; The National American Woman Suffrage Association sustained the inequalities between black and white women and also limited their ability to contribute.

Susan B. Anthony and Frederick Douglass together formed the American Equal Rights Association, advocating for equality between &quot;both&quot; gender and sex. In 1848, Frederick Douglass was asked to speak by Susan B. Anthony at a convention in Seneca Falls, New York. Frederick Douglass was an active supporter. Later, Douglass was not permitted to attend an Atlanta, Georgia NAWSA convention. Susan B. Anthony exclaimed, &quot;I did not want to subject him to humiliation, and I did not want anything to get in the way of bringing the Southern white women into our suffrage association, now that their interest had been awakened&quot;. Douglass opposed the fact that Cady and Anthony were extremely unsupportive of black voting rights. White women condoned racism at the cost of black women if it meant benefitting and more support of the white suffrage movement.

===== Institutional racism =====
It was not just through personal racism that black women were excluded from feminists movements; institutional racism prevented many women from having an avid say and stance. It is important to consider the history of black women&#x27;s labor in the economic, social and political history of America and when orienting the role of black women in first-wave feminism because that history indicates an entirely different experience between black and white women. Black Americans regardless of gender face a violent history of oppression that exploited, abused and commoditized the body for labor as an essential aspect of the early development and success of the United States&#x27; economy. Black women were essential to maintaining the mass labor of enslaved people because they could have children that would later become subject to forced labor as well. This uniquely ties black women to the foundation of the United States&#x27; economic success. Black women thusly face oppression based on class, race as well as gender that means their interactions with the legal, social, political, educational and economic institutions that feminism aims to change is different from how white women interact with those same systems. The goal of first-wave feminism being mainly to resolve legal issues, chiefly to secure voting rights, only considered the needs of white high class women. First-wave feminism entirely mimicked the racial hierarchy that maintained the power dynamics that exploit black women and completely alienated black women from the feminist movement. The National American Woman Suffrage Association, established by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton did not invite black women to attend specific meetings, excluding them entirely. Feminist and women&#x27;s suffrage conventions held in Southern states, where black women were a dominant percentage of the population, were segregated.

Institutional racism excluded black women in the March on Washington in 1913. Black women were asked to march separately, together, at the back of the parade. They were forced to be made absent which can be seen in the lack of photographs and media of black women marching in the parade. White women did not want black women associated with their movement because they believed white women would disaffiliate themselves from an integrated group and create a segregated, more powerful one.

===== Sojourner Truth&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman?&quot; =====
Despite participating and contributing a great deal to all feminists movements, black women were rarely recognized. Mary McLeod Bethune said that the world was unable to accept all of the contributions black women have made. Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton together wrote the &quot;History of Woman Suffrage&quot; published in 1881. The book failed to give adequate recognition to the black women who were equally responsible for the change in United States history. Sojourner Truth became an influential advocate for the women&#x27;s rights movement. In 1851 she delivered her &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman&quot; speech at the women&#x27;s rights convention in Akron, Ohio. Black women at this point were beginning to become empowered and assertive, speaking out on the disproportionate inequalities. Truth speaks of how she, and other women, are capable of working as much as men, after having thirteen children. This speech was one of the ways white and black women became closer to working towards fighting for the same thing. Sojourner Truth&#x27;s speech was originally documented by Marius Robinson, a good friend of hers, who was present at the women&#x27;s rights convention. Sojourner voiced her thoughts on the civil rights of women. In 1863, twelve years after she delivered the speech Frances Gage published her recollection of Sojourners speech on that day. Gage changed a majority of Sojourner&#x27;s words and made her appear as if she had a southern slave dialect which she in fact did not as shown in Robinson&#x27;s accurate version. Gage wrote phrases such as &quot;chillen, whar dar&#x27;s so much racket dar must be som&#x27;ting out o&#x27;kilter.&quot; when Sojourner actually said &quot;May I say a few words? I want to say a few words about this matter.&quot; Thought this speech was a huge stepping stone for the women&#x27;s movement, it was still evident who the movement was focused on. Truth made a speech at the American Equal Rights Association in New York in 1867. In the speech, she said, &quot;If colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.&quot; Her speeches brought attention to the movement, for black women, but also for white. Although private lives continued to be segregated, feminist coalitions became integrated. Two separate reasons aided integration in the feminist movement. Paula Giddings wrote that the two fights against racism and sexism could not be separated. Gerda Lerner wrote that black women demonstrated they too were fully capable of fighting and creating change for equality.

== Criticism ==
For Kyla Schuller in &quot;The Biopolitics of Feeling: Race, Sex, and Science in the Nineteenth Century&quot;, &quot;biopower is feminism&#x27;s enabling condition ... movements for gender equality have materialized amid a field of power in which, at least since Malthus, the interdependence of reproduction and economics forms the primary field of the political.&quot; Schuller argues that &quot;[the] evolutionary notion of the distinct sexes of male and female, understood as specialized divergences in physiology, anatomy, and mental function that only the most civilized had achieved, was itself a racial hierarchy ... the very idea of sex as a biological and political subjectivity is a product of the biopolitical logics unfolding hand in hand with the sciences of species change.&quot; Schuller quotes Canadian philosopher Michelle Murphy in &quot;Seizing the Means of Reproduction: Entanglements of Feminism, Health, and Technoscience&quot;: &quot;Historicizing feminisms as a biopolitics that has taken &#x27;sex,&#x27; and its subsidiary, &#x27;reproduction,&#x27; as central concerns requires that we understand feminisms in all their variety and contradiction as animated within - and not escaping from - dominant configurations of governance and technoscience.&quot; From this perspective, 19th- and early 20th-century feminisms reproduced the very social hierarchies they had the potential to struggle against, exemplifying the claim of Michel Foucault in his &quot;The History of Sexuality, Volume I: An Introduction&quot; that &quot;resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power.&quot;

First-wave feminism offered no intersectional perspective. Gender was not thought of as a social construction, nor was the roles that each gender plays thought of as sexist. This time period also focused on biological differences, and that only the way to be considered a woman was through biology or sex. It did not consider and fight for women of color, or women of lower socioeconomic status. It also reinforced and made colonization stronger, as well increasing the eroticization of women from different nations. First-wave theorists also leave out all of the activism women of color contributed. Activists like Maria Stewart, and Frances E. W. Harper are hardly mentioned with any credit for the abolitionist or suffrage movements during this time period. First wave feminism is male centric meaning it was made in the form of the way men see women. Another issue with First-Wave feminism is that the white, middle-class women were able to decide what is a woman problem and what is not. First-wave lacked the sexual freedom women aspired to have but could not have while men could. It is also said that many of the white fundamental First Wave feminists were in alliance with women of color but stayed silent when they figured they could reach progression for middle class, white women.

<text>The Coliseo de Puerto Rico José Miguel Agrelot (English: José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum of Puerto Rico) is the largest indoor entertainment and sports arena in Puerto Rico, located nearby the Milla de Oro financial district of Hato Rey in San Juan, the capital municipality of the archipelago and island. Opened in 2004 with a seating capacity of 18,500 spectators, the venue is colloquially known as the Choliseo or El Choli, which is a portmanteau of the words &quot;coliseo&quot; (coliseum) and &quot;Cholito&quot;, a reference to &quot;Don Cholito&quot;, a character created by Puerto Rican comedian José Miguel Agrelot and his own adopted nickname. The venue is owned by the Puerto Rico Convention District Authority, a public corporation of Puerto Rico, and managed by ASM Global. It can be reached by public transport via the Hato Rey Station of the Tren Urbano and the Puerto Rico Metropolitan Bus Authority from nearby stops. 

The José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum has consistently been ranked among the highest ticket-selling venues globally. On May 26, 2011, the arena was ranked 8th on the Top 50 Arena Venues of the world and second of the West Hemisphere in worldwide ticket sales by &quot;Pollstar&quot;. As of 2022, the arena has received over ten million spectators, hosting more than a thousand events with a gross ticket revenue of over $200 million. The largest attendance record that the &quot;Choliseo&quot; has hosted was achieved on July 28, 2022 by Bad Bunny&#x27;s Un Verano Sin Ti, with an all-time record of 18,749 spectators, exceeding 249 over the venue&#x27;s capacity. 

The arena has suffered two major closings, the first one after the hit from Hurricane Maria, during the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, when events after mid-September 2017 were cancelled. The &quot;Choliseo&quot; was used as a warehouse and collection center by the Government of Puerto Rico to prepare and distribute food, water and basic necessities to those affected by the deadliest and costliest hurricane in Puerto Rican history, before it resumed hosting events in March 2018. The second major closing was due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the entertainment and the music industry, when events at the venue were cancelled or postponed beginning March 2020, until the venue resumed hosting events in June 2021, with attendance modifications.

==History==
===Original plans===

The Coliseum was a project started during the administration of Governor Rafael Hernández Colón, initially as part of a bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games. The facility was supposed to be constructed between the Roberto Clemente Coliseum and Hiram Bithorn Stadium, about a mile and a half away from the current arena site. The Coliseum would have been used for events such as Gymnastics and Olympic Basketball had the games been held in San Juan.

===Controversy===
However, in 1997, the International Olympic Committee selected Athens to host the Olympics and the construction of the Coliseum was jeopardized. Recognizing the need for such a facility anyway, the government decided to continue the construction, this time at a site physically close to San Juan&#x27;s financial district, the Golden Mile. Since the new site was adjacent to a future Tren Urbano station, the Coliseum&#x27;s planners decided not to incorporate parking facilities to the arena, as to induce visitors to use mass transportation to reach it.

Political opponents of Pedro Rosselló&#x27;s administration raised various objections to the original plan, claiming that the lot of land purchased for the construction would benefit some of his political party&#x27;s (PNP) heaviest financial contributors. They also objected to the lack of parking space, claiming that nearby private parking operators, supposedly also money donors to Rosselló&#x27;s party, would extort high parking fees from people who could not or would not use public transportation to the venue. At the time, the Tren Urbano was in its initial stages of construction; by the time the facility opened it was still under construction. Objectors would also point out that a private operator would take control of the facility under contract from the government of Puerto Rico under what was perceived as a highly expensive contract. The Rosselló administration countered by stating that previous experience with public sports facilities in Puerto Rico, which would quickly fall into disrepair at an accelerated rate requiring constant remodeling, demanded that a private entity should manage the facility. The contract&#x27;s expense would be justified by bringing in an operating partner with international experience managing world-class facilities, whose reputation would ensure that performers and sport events that had never been staged in Puerto Rico could visit the island.

The Coliseum&#x27;s construction was stopped for close to two years during the administration of governor Sila María Calderón, the leader of the opposition party (PPD) whose administration followed Rosselló&#x27;s. She claimed that the Puerto Rican government had spent $242 million for a facility where only 42% of its scheduled project plan had been completed when she took office. The planners and constructors had overlooked the fact that a water pumping station next to the facility had been built over unstable land, and a portion of the building&#x27;s foundations would have had to be redone because of this. There was even talk of demolishing what had been built and starting from scratch, which infuriated Rosselló supporters, who dismissed the suggestion as merely an excuse to spend more government money, this time to benefit the PPD&#x27;s financial backers. Plans for a redesigned interior added during the Calderón administration added fuel to the intense public controversy.

Another controversy came about when Banco Popular&#x27;s subsidiary Ticketpop was named the ticketing distributor through an exclusive contract, almost ignoring the bid by competitor TicketCenter. Ticketpop remained the sole ticketing distributor, from the venue&#x27;s opening day until August 28, 2019, when rising competitor Ticketera was given the exclusive contract; Ticketpop&#x27;s entire subsidiary operations were later sold to Ticketera in April 2021, whose founders also founded Ticketpop.

The original ticket vendor bidding controversy almost went to trial, as both parties argued over who would receive the contract, but the Government of Puerto Rico stood by their original contract with Ticketpop. Local producer Angelo Medina spearheaded a group that wanted the legislature to curb the managing powers of SMG (before merging to ASM Global in 2019), recently-named to oversee operations and activities, because they feared that the company&#x27;s relationship with non-local television companies would limit the participation of local talent in the arena.

The Coliseum was finally inaugurated on September 4, 2004. The first major show was Van Halen, on September 13, 2004.

===Dedication===

The naming of the structure caused a controversy by itself. During the construction phase, plans called for the coliseum to be named simply &quot;El Coliseo de Puerto Rico&quot; (The Coliseum of Puerto Rico). It was also suggested to have a private entity sponsor the facility and lend its name to it. Most local politicians objected to the idea, due to the 2001 Enron financial scandal, which made the company go bankrupt at a time when their corporate sponsorship named the Houston Astros&#x27; home ballpark as the Enron Field.

Some politicians argued over the naming the Coliseum after a Puerto Rican celebrity. Some of the names mentioned were that of pop star Chayanne, boxer Félix &quot;Tito&quot; Trinidad and actor Raúl Juliá. Puerto Rican law demanded that no facility could be named after a living individual and there were talks of making an exception to the law should a living Puerto Rican icon be honored with the name. However, the name of beloved local comedian José Miguel Agrelot was chosen in 2004, the same year of his death, when the Coliseum was near its completion. Agrelot himself had suggested the name of Rafael Hernández Marín to be used, and when someone suggested his name instead he was both surprised and concerned.

==Parking and transportation==

A major public parking space or garage was not included in the planning or construction for the arena. Instead, only three parking lots were constructed, one for backstage entrance for authorized talent, production, equipment, props, etc., a medium-sized lot to the West entrance mostly for handicapped and the smallest lot, access-controlled, located across the box office and nearby the heavy rail station; privately-owned parking lots around the &quot;Choliseo&quot; can be found and charge a fee. The Tren Urbano is by far the most used transportation mode to and from the &quot;Choliseo&quot;; the Hato Rey station, located at a short walking distance, is the only station to extend operating hours after nighttime events end until all passengers using the system have exited at the station of their respective destinations.

==Awards and recognitions==
On May 26, 2011, the &quot;Coliseo&quot; was ranked 8th on the Top 50 Arena Venues of the world and second of the West Hemisphere in worldwide ticket sales by &quot;Pollstar&quot;, surpassing the Staples Center in Los Angeles, the American Airlines Arena in Miami and Wembley Arena in London, among others. In the first three months of 2011, the coliseum received an overwhelming number of people of over 205,000. During the first trimester, the coliseum was ranked 13 times in the 25 best arenas worldwide, according to &quot;Pollstar&quot;, &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;Venues Today&quot;.

==Notable events held at the venue==
The largest attendance record that the &quot;Choliseo&quot; has hosted was achieved on July 28, 2022, with Bad Bunny&#x27;s Un Verano Sin Ti. The singer established an all-time record of 18,749 spectators, 249 spectators over the venue&#x27;s capacity, on the first night of his three-night performances, breaking a previous record that was also achieved by him in 2019. This was the first time a concert was fully broadcast live on national television in Puerto Rico, which was exclusively through the airwaves of Telemundo Puerto Rico. Wisin &amp; Yandel hold various records, some of which they have previously broken as well, including most performances at the &quot;Choliseo&quot;, by any performing artist, duo or group, increasing it to 39 and largest number of shows sold out in 24 hours. The &quot;Choliseo&quot; will host the first concert residence at the venue, as well as in Puerto Rico, for Bad Bunny&#x27;s No Me Quiero Ir de Aquí, which will also be the singer&#x27;s first residency. The 30-date residency will take place July 11–September 14, 2025.

<doc id="1271962" wikidata="Q3500725" url="?curid=1271962" title="Billiard table">
<text>A billiard table or billiards table is a bounded table on which cue sports are played. In the modern era, all billiards tables (whether for carom billiards, pool, pyramid or snooker) provide a flat surface usually made of quarried slate, that is covered with cloth (usually of a tightly woven worsted wool called baize), and surrounded by vulcanized rubber cushions, with the whole thing elevated above the floor. More specific terms are used for specific sports, such as snooker table and pool table, and different-sized billiard balls are used on these table types. An obsolete term is billiard board, used in the 16th and 17th centuries.

==Parts and equipment==
===Cushions===
Cushions (also sometimes called &quot;rail cushions&quot;, &quot;cushion rubber&quot;, or rarely &quot;bumpers&quot;) are located on the inner sides of a table&#x27;s wooden . There are several different materials and design philosophies associated with cushion rubber. These cushions are made from an elastic material such as vulcanized rubber (gum or synthetic). The purpose of the cushion rubber is to cause the billiard balls to rebound off the rubber while minimizing the loss of kinetic energy.

The &quot;profile&quot; of the rail cushion, which is the cushion&#x27;s angle in relation to the bed of the table, varies between table types. The standard on American pool tables is the K-66 profile, which as defined by the Billiard Congress of America (BCA) has a base of and a nose height of . When installed properly the distance from the nose of the cushion to the covered slate surface is while using a regulation ball set.

On a carom table, the K-55 profile is used (with a somewhat sharper angle than pool cushions). K-55 cushions have cloth, usually canvas, vulcanized into the top of the rubber to adjust rebound accuracy and speed.

Snooker tables use an L-shaped profile, such as the L77 profile.

===Bed===
The bed table – the cloth-covered, horizontal playing surface – is, on high-quality equipment, made of solid, smooth slabs of slate, most often from Italy, Brazil or China. Small pool tables may use only one or two pieces of slate, while carom, English billiards and tournament-size pool tables use three. Full-size snooker tables require five. The gap between slates is filled with a hard-drying putty, epoxy or resin, then sanded to produce a seamless surface, before being covered with the cloth. When several pieces of slate are joined poorly it is possible for the resin to deform and cause an uneven playing surface; it can also be difficult to move once joined.

Tables for the home market usually use slate beds as well, but the slate is often thinner, down to about . The early table beds were made of cloth-covered wooden boards. Today, inexpensive but not very rigid or durable materials used for the beds of low-end tables (e.g. for children&#x27;s recreation rooms) still include wood, especially medium-density fibreboard and plywood, as well as plastics and other synthetic materials under various trade names.

===Cloth===
Billiard cloth (sometimes erroneously called felt) is a specific type of cloth that covers the top of the table&#x27;s &quot;playing area&quot;. Both the rails and slate beds are covered with 21–24-ounce billiard cloth (although some less expensive 19-ounce cloths are available) which is most often green in colour (representing the grass of the original lawn games from which billiards evolved), and consists of either a woven wool or wool-nylon blend called baize.

Most bar tables, which get much use, use the slower, thicker blended felt because it is cheaper. This type of cloth is called a woollen cloth. By contrast, high-quality pool cloth is usually made of a napless weave such as worsted wool, which gives a much faster roll to the balls. This &quot;speed&quot; of the cloth affects the amounts of and of the balls, among other aspects of game finesse. Snooker cloth traditionally has a directional nap, upon which the balls behave differently when rolling against vs. running with the direction of the nap.

===Markings===
, also known as (for their traditional shape), are inlaid at precise, evenly spaced positions along the rails of some tables (not usually on snooker tables) to aid in the aiming of bank or kick shots. There are six along each long rail (with the side pocket interfering with where the seventh one would go, on pocket billiard tables) and three along each short rail, with each of the four corners counting as another in the mathematical systems that the diamonds are used to calculate. These sights divide the playing surface into equal squares. Books, even entire series of books, have been written on geometric and algebraic systems of aiming using the diamonds.

Spots are often used to mark the and on the cloth. Other markings may be a line drawn across the (or across the with , in British-style pool). Another case is the outline of the behind the foot spot where the balls are in straight pool, since the outline of this area is strategically important throughout the game. In artistic pool, lines may be drawn between opposite sights putting a grid on the playing surface. Other grid patterns are used in various forms of balkline billiards. A recent table marking convention, in European nine-ball, is the .

==Carom billiards tables==
Pocketless carom billiards tables are used for such games as straight rail, balkline, one-cushion billiards, three-cushion caroms, and artistic billiards.

===Dimensions===
Regulation 10 × 5-foot carom billiards tables have a playing surface (measured between the noses of the cushions) of with a 5-millimetre allowance. The standard height range of the table, measured from the playing surface to the ground is between 75 and 80 centimetres.

===Bed===
The slate bed of a carom billiards table must have a minimum thickness of 45 millimetres and in tournaments recommended heating temperatures is , which helps to keep moisture out of the cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner, and generally makes a table play faster. A heated table is required under international carom rules and is an especially important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards.
==Pool tables==
A pool table, or pocket billiards table, has six – one at each corner of the table () and one at the midpoint of each of the longer sides ( or ).

===Dimensions===

Pool tables come in different sizes, typically referred to as , , , or tables. In all cases, the table is rectangular with a ratio (e.g. ).

There are only two sizes approved for tournament play by the International Olympic Committee–recognized sport governing body of pool, the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA), and its various regional and national affiliates; under the world standardized rules of pool, these are the and models. For a table, the playing surface (the dimensions between the noses of the cushions) measures with a (3.2 mm) margin of error for either dimension. For an , the playing surface measures , with the same inch variance allowed.

In the UK as well as a number of other British Commonwealth and European countries, the typical pool table is a , although tables for the pub and home market are also common. These are the sizes used by internationally standardized blackball and the amateur World Eightball Pool Federation, as well as informal pub pool. The 7-foot size is also frequently used in North American amateur leagues, and are common coin-operated fixtures in bars and other venues. The playing surface for a 7-foot table is .

===Pockets===
Pockets, typically rimmed at the back with leather or plastic traditionally have &quot;drop pockets&quot;, which are small receptacles below each pocket to contain the balls. More modern tables may instead employ &quot;ball return pockets&quot;, a series of gutters inside the table, which deliver the balls into a collection compartment on one side of the table, in a similar manner to the ball return on a bowling alley. On a coin-operated table, the object balls are deposited inside an inaccessible window until the table is paid again, allowing the balls to be released into the compartment, while the cue ball is usually separated into its own ball return, often utilizing a different sized ball. A possible result of drop pockets is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it would fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.

Regardless of table size, the WPA standard (sometimes informally called &quot;American-style&quot;) table has wide, angular pockets that funnel notably inward, generally 1.75 to 2.25 times as wide at the opening as the diameter of the balls, wider at the side (middle) pockets than the corners. WEPF pool (sometimes informally called &quot;British-style&quot; or &quot;Commonwealth-style&quot;) is played with balls, and this type of table has smaller, narrow pockets (the width is calculated as the ball diameter multiplied by 1.6, and is consistent at all six pockets), with rounded entrances and nearly parallel sides, like those on a snooker table. One tactical consequence of this design difference is that the jaws of the WPA-type pocket are often used exactly like a horizontal version of the backboard of a basketball goal, to rebound the ball into the pocket; this technique does not work on blackball tables, and even shots down the cushion into a corner pocket are more difficult.

===Bed===
For tournament competition under WPA world-standardized rules (and league play under derived rulesets), the bed of the pocket billiard table must be made of slate no less than thick. The flatness of the table must be divergent by no greater than lengthwise and across the width.

===Scoring device===
Some pool tables may feature a mechanical scorekeeper on one side, which can be changed to denote points for games such as straight pool or rotation.

==Snooker and English billiards tables==

A table designed for the games snooker and English billiards is usually called a snooker table.

===Dimensions===
The playing area of a tournament snooker table, as standardized by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) and the amateur International Billiards and Snooker Federation (IBSF), measures 11 feet 8.5 inches by 5 ft 10 in (3569 mm by 1778 mm) with a tolerance of ± 0.5 in (13 mm), though commonly referred to as 12 ft by 6 ft, the nominal outer dimensions including the rails. Smaller tables, approximately 10 ft by 5 ft down to half size, are also sometimes used in pubs, homes and smaller snooker halls. The height from the floor to the top of the cushion is between 2 ft 9.5 in and 2 ft 10.5 in (851 mm and 876 mm).

===Pockets===
A snooker table has six pockets, one at each corner and one at the centre of each of the longest side cushions. The pockets are around 86 mm (3.5 in), though high-class tournaments may use slightly smaller pockets to increase difficulty. The amount of (trimmed underside of the rubber cushion&#x27;s protruding at the pocket opening), if any, has a strong effect on how easily a ball is accepted by the pocket (the &quot;). On snooker and English billiards tables, the pocket entries are rounded, while pool tables have sharp &quot;. This affects how accurate shots need to be to get into a pocket, and how fast they can be when not dead-on, including shots that run along and against a cushion, making snooker more difficult to play than pool. According to the WPBSA official rule book, &quot;the pocket openings shall conform to the owned and authorised by The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA)&quot;. The WPBSA and IBSF rule books&#x27; equipment sections do not actually specify the measurements and shapes of these proprietary templates which change from time to time, requiring that the templates be dated. The organizations do not recognize tournament play or records (maximum breaks, etc.) if not performed on tables that conform to then-current templates.

===Cushions===
The cushions (sometimes known as rails, though that term properly applies to the wood sections to which the cushions are attached) are usually made of vulcanized rubber.

===Markings===
The area is marked by a drawn on the cloth across the width of the table at from and parallel to the face of the . A semicircle with a radius of centred on this line within baulk forms in which the cue ball must be placed when breaking or after the cue ball has been or shot off the table. The position of four of are marked along the (lengthwise centre) of the table, perpendicular to the baulk line: the , from the ; the or , located at the midpoint between the bottom and top ; the or , located midway between the centre spot and the top cushion; and the or , located at the midpoint of the baulk line (and, thus of the &quot;D&quot;). Due to its obviousness, the brown spot is not always marked (neither are the unmistakable and , at the left and right intersections, respectively, of the baulk line and the &quot;Ds curve. The exact placing of these markings are different on smaller tables, but proportional to the full-size model.

===Bed===
The of a good-quality snooker table has a of slate and is covered with baize cloth, traditionally green, though many other colours are now available. The thickness of this cloth determines the table&#x27;s (lack of friction) and responsiveness to , thicker cloths being longer lasting but slower and less responsive. The nap of the cloth can affect the run of the balls, especially on slower shots and shots played with applied to the . A snooker table traditionally has the nap running from the baulk to the top end and is brushed and ironed in this direction.

==Tables for other games==
Other types of billiard tables are used for specific games, such as Russian pyramid which uses a &#x27;12 ft by 6 ft&#x27; table (similar to a snooker table but with much smaller pockets), and Asian four ball which uses a pocketless 8 ft by 4 ft table. Games such as bagatelle often had more than six holes, including straight through the bed in the middle of the table, a feature still found in bar billiards and bumper pool.

==Novelty and home tables==
There are novelty billiard tables, often for pool, that come in various shapes including zig-zag, circular, and (especially for bumper pool) hexagonal. A circular table featured prominently in the 1972 film &quot;Silent Running&quot;. For the home market, many manufacturers have produced convertible billiard tables (in the broad sense) that double as dining tables or as table tennis, foosball, or air hockey, tables, with removable hard tops. Home pool tables, which often lack a ball-return system, are commonly either 4 × 8 ft or 3.5 × 7 ft models, a medium between 3 × 6 ft. bar/pub tables and 4.5 × 9 ft tournament-size models. Low-end tables tend toward the smaller range, and may have MDF or wood beds as an alternative to slate; those with light-weight beds may be foldable for storage, as with table tennis. Miniature tables range in size from tabletop 1 × 1.6 ft to free-standing 2.5 × 5 ft models, and use scaled-down cues and balls.

== Heating ==
Billiard table beds are commonly heated with electricity, in order to keep the cloth dry, and allow the balls to roll better. Queen Victoria (1819–1901) had a billiard table that was heated using zinc tubes, although the aim at that time was chiefly to keep the then-used ivory balls from warping. The first use of electric heating was for an 18.2 balkline tournament held in December 1927 between Welker Cochran and Jacob Schaefer Jr. &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced it with fanfare: &quot;For the first time in the history of world&#x27;s championship balkline billiards a heated table will be used...&quot;

An electrically heated table is required under international carom billiard tournament rules &#x27;in order to ensure the best possible rolling&#x27;, although temperatures are not specified. In tournaments, carom billiard tables have recommended heating temperatures of , while billiard associations may heat their carom tables to as much as . An average modern billiard heater has an output of 600 watts. If it is not switched off outside operating hours, consumption is 3,500 kilowatt-hour (kWh) per year, costing 525 euros (0.15 EUR/kWh). Switching off a billiard table heater whenever it is not used can save more than 50% in energy consumption and costs; this can be done automatically with timers. Another way to reduce energy consumption and costs is to use synthetic cloth rather than wool cloth, which requires much more energy to warm up. A disadvantage of synthetic cloth may be that certain types of games, such as balkline, may result in damaging the synthetic cloth too quickly because of the way players hit the balls.

The 2022 Russia–European Union gas dispute caused rising energy costs around Europe, making heating billiard tables almost prohibitively expensive. The Royal Dutch Billiards Federation&#x27;s director said in October 2022 that &quot;billiard and snooker localities are simply incapable of affording these energy prices anymore, as heating a billiard costs about 3,500 kilowatts a year (...). At current energy prices, that is about 2,400 to 2,500 euros a year per billiard table.&quot;

<doc id="1271965" wikidata="Q7192149" url="?curid=1271965" title="Pierre Clergue">
<text>Pierre Clergue was a priest in the village of Montaillou, France in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century. He is the central figure in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;Montaillou&quot;, a pioneering work of microhistory. Since then he has appeared in a number of other histories, and as the villain in the fictional work &quot;The Good Men&quot; by .

==Family==

Pierre was the son of Pons and Mengarde Clergue. The Clergues were a family of wealthy peasants, by far the wealthiest in Montaillou and their power extended throughout the region. Pierre, the head of the family after the death of his father, became the priest of the village. His brother Bernard Clergue became the local bayle, the enforcer of laws and collector of taxes. The Clergue brothers thus had a central role in being the representatives of both religious and secular power in the town. As one of the few educated men in town Pierre Clergue also served as a notary and performed other such tasks.

==Catharism==

Despite being a priest in a Roman Catholic church Pierre Clergue was a staunch Albigensian having been converted by the parfait Guillaume Authié. For many years he played an important role by convincing the inquisition to ignore Montaillou, despite its being filled with heretics. This changed in about 1300, when Pierre Clergue began to inform on some members of his parish. In 1308 he played a central role in the inquisition&#x27;s move to arrest the entire adult population of the town. Pierre decided which villagers would be freed and which punished. He used this power to satisfy personal grievances. During this time he and his brother continued to provide shelter and aid to certain Cathars.

==Affairs with women==

Pierre Clergue is notable for his sexual appetite—celibacy among priests was not strictly enforced in the Pyrenees at this time—having many mistresses over his long career as priest and virtual ruler of the town. The most important of these was Béatrice de Planisoles who as châtelaine was the nominal ruler of the village. Le Roy Ladurie lists nine women of Montaillou with whom he conducted affairs: Alazaïs Fauré, Raymonde Fauré, Béatrice de Planisoles, Grazide Lizier, Alazaïs Azéma, Gaillarde Benet, Alissende Roussel, Mengarde Buscailh, Na Maragda, Jacotte den Tort, Raymonde Guilhou, and Esclarmonde Clergue, his sister in law.

Pierre Clergue justified his philandering in several ways. Cathar doctrine taught that all sex was sinful, though more so within the confines of marriage, as the couple did not believe that they were erring. Since he expected to be absolved from all his sins upon his deathbed in the &quot;consolamentum&quot; he also felt he could sin without having to suffer for it.

In 1320 Pierre Clergue was arrested by the inquisition under the orders of Bishop Jacques Fournier. Despite a concerted campaign of bribery and calling in favours by his brother Bernard, Pierre remained in prison and eventually died there. There is no record of his testifying before the Inquisition.

<text>is a video game published by ELF Corporation and the sequel to &quot;Dōkyūsei&quot;. &quot;Dōkyūsei 2&quot; was released in 1995 for PC-98, FM Towns and MS-DOS, in 1996 on PC-FX and in 1997 for Super Famicom, Sega Saturn, PlayStation and Microsoft Windows.

The player plays the role of a high school male student. In the winter vacation of the last school year (from 22 December to 7 January), he has to choose one girl to be his girlfriend. There are 15 choices for him to make, some are his classmates and some have to be met in the city.

<text>Jean Pellissier was a 14th-century shepherd in the Comté de Foix, made notable by appearing in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s &quot;Montaillou&quot;. Pellissier was born in Montaillou to a family of poor peasants. One of a number of sons, he became a shepherd as the family land would not sustain all of them. At the age of twelve, as was the custom, he began tending his family&#x27;s flock of sheep. Soon he was apprenticed in Tournon to a woman named Thomassia, likely a widow. He worked there for five or six years before returning home and living with his widowed mother and his four brothers, Raymond, Guillaume, Bernard, and Pierre.

Some years later he again left home to become a shepherd in Niort. Staying there two years, he went to Mompret for a year before again returning to Montaillou. He then moved in with Bernard and Guillemette Maurs and worked tending their flock, the couple&#x27;s children being too young for the job. His brother Bernard also resided there working as a ploughboy for the couple. The Maurs were Cathars and Jean was briefly converted to the movement.

In 1308, however, the town of Montaillou was raided by the local inquisition and the Maurs arrested. Pellissier left for the neighbouring town of Prades d&#x27;Aillon where he was hired by Bernard Malet; two months later Malet was also imprisoned by the inquisition. Pellissier remained in the employ of Malet&#x27;s sons Bernard, Raymond, and André.

Eventually Pellissier left to resume travelling through the region for several years before accumulating enough money to settle in Montaillou with his own flock.

<text>Raymonde Arsen née Vital was a servant in the Comté de Foix in the early fourteenth century. She was made notable by appearing in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s &quot;Montaillou&quot;. Born in Prades d&#x27;Aillon to a poor peasant family in 1306 she left to work in the home of Bonet de la Coste in town Pamiers.

Whilst in the city she had an illegitimate child who she named Alazaïs. As a servant she could not care for the girl and she lived with a series of nurses. Later she was approached by her cousin Raymond Belot of Montaillou who needed a servant to replace his sister, Raymonde, who was soon to be wed to Bernard Clergue. She agreed and worked for the Belots. She lived in a small barn and her primary duties were baking bread and washing clothes. Also in the home was her brother Arnaud Vital a cobbler who was boarding with the Belots. She worked for the Belots for one year, later marrying Prades den Arsen and settling in Prades d&#x27;Aillon.

<text>Majayjay (), officially as the Municipality of Majayjay (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. As of the 2020 census, the municipality has a population of 27,893 residents.

==Etymology==
The original name of Majayjay was Malay Barangay, but many residents assume that Spaniards found it difficult to pronounce, which may have led to early colonizers shortening it to Malay-ay until it became Majayjay. Legends, however, say that it was the difficult journey to Majayjay which gave the town its name; tired travelers supposedly sighed, “Hay!” after scaling a cliff, “Hay!” after ascending a hill, and “Hay!” after crossing a raging river. Thus, guests referred to the place as “Mahayhay,” meaning many sighs, and the Spaniards then spelled this “Majayjay.”

==History==

In 1571, The Spanish colonial government made Majayjay into a town, which at the time was one of the most populated settlements in the newly founded province. It competed with Bay and Pagsanjan during the selection of the province&#x27;s capital.

The popularity of the town grew during the Spanish period, in part due to its location at the foot of the mountain, which gave it an abundant supply of fresh mountain spring water. Four rivers flowed through the town: Initian, Oobi, Olla, and Balanac (from the falls of Botocan) where all the rivers meet.

Botocan Falls and the town&#x27;s scenery were uniquely famous, which led to many Europeans and wealthy natives from Manila frequently visiting the town. However, the road to Malay Barangay was considered to be tough. Guests have to be ferried from Manila through the Pasig River to Laguna de Bay. Land travel was done by mounting horses through a path in the forest and then being borne by natives in hammocks on the way up to Malay Barangay.

After the conversion of the natives of Malay Barangay, a makeshift church was built near May-it River, but was destroyed by a fire in 1578. A new church made of bamboo and cogon thatch was built; however, another fire destroyed it again. A stone church was then built, which was also burned down. Despite the fire incidents, the image of their patron saint, San Gregorio Papa Magno survived.

Through the efforts of Padre José de Puertollano, contributions enforced by parishioners, and forced labor of natives, a new church was built in 1730, with its construction taking 19 years.

==Geography==
Majayjay is situated in the southernmost part of Laguna. It nestles at the foot of Mt. Banahaw, and due to its higher altitude at some 2,700+ ft above sea level, the town makes for a popular vacation destination during summer in the Philippines. It was once branded as the &#x27;Summer Capital of the Philippines&#x27; 300–400 years ago during the Spanish era, when most of the prominent names in the Spanish colonial Philippines visited the area. Other sights along the streets include the remnants of the said era of Spanish-inspired houses that still stand at periodic key locations, mostly in the town square. Affluent families still have their ancestral houses maintained.

Majayjay is situated at the base of Mount Banahaw; approximately 1,000 feet (300 meters) above sea level. It is from Santa Cruz, from Manila, and from Lucban. It shares borders with Magdalena on the northwest, Lucban in Quezon to the southeast, Luisiana to the northeast, and Liliw to the west.

===Climate===
Majayjay is classified as Am in the Köppen–Geiger climate classification, which refers to a tropical monsoon climate. There is significant rainfall in most months of the year, with the annual rainfall averaging 2,571 mm, and the precipitation between the driest month and the wettest month differing by 332 mm. The short dry season has little effect on the overall climate. The temperature here averages 25.8 °C, and during the year, the average temperatures vary by 3.2 °C. The warmest month of the year is May, with an average temperature of 27.4 °C. January has the lowest average temperature of the year, which is 24.2 °C.

===Barangays===
Majayjay is politically subdivided into 40 barangays, which is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines. Each barangay consists of puroks, or unofficial divisions within a barangay, and some barangays also have sitios, which are also unofficial divisions in a barangay.

==Tourism==

* Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church: Majayjay is home to one of the oldest Roman Catholic churches in the Philippines, the Saint Gregory the Great Parish Church. It was built in 1575 through forced labor by the town folks. Inside the church are antique statues of saints brought by the Spaniards in the early era of propagating Christianity. The church underwent fire incidents in 1576, 1606, and 1660, but later underwent reconstructions and rehabilitation works. A view of Laguna de Bay can be seen atop the roof of the church.
* Taytay Falls: Majayjay is also home to the Taytay Falls. Others call it the Majayjay Falls or even Imelda Falls because ex-First Lady Imelda Marcos financed the promotion of tourism in this place. It is a two-story high fall located in remote scenery where forestry is abundant. To reach Taytay Falls, one has to go down the stone steps leading to a kilometer-long trail, constructed in 2008. Recently, the World Bank has sponsored the promotion of tourism in Taytay Falls.
* Puente de Capriccio: In Rizal&#x27;s &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot;, he spoke of an old Spanish bridge made of stone in the year 1851. It was a one-arch bridge since it was not finished, early natives put a bamboo footbridge to connect the opposite sides to make it accessible. Puente de Capriccio was initiated by Spanish Franciscan priest Victoriano del Moral. But the priest was cruel and autocratic, anyone who did not labour in the construction would be later punished by whipping the buttocks. The workers were reportedly not paid a single centavo. Because of his cruelty, the workers campaigned against him, thus, the bridge&#x27;s construction never resumed since 1851. The bridge is still standing firm today crossing the Olla River. It is called &quot;Tulay ng Pige&quot; (Bridge of Buttocks) by modern Majayjayenos. The bridge now symbolizes the defiance of Filipino workers against the oppressive Spanish colonialists during the colonial period.
* Mount Banahaw: Majayjay is located at the foot of this mountain. In the early Spanish era, Mount Banahaw was called Monte de Majayjay, because it was the town the only way to travel to the mountain. Many European elites visited the town for Mount Banahaw.
* Bukal Falls: Popular to most tourists as the &quot;Enchanted Falls&quot;
* Botocan Hydroelectric Power Plant and Dam: It is the first hydroelectric power plant constructed in the Philippines in the 20th century (1930). It is now owned by the CBK Power Company Limited.
* Ermita Church: Then, a tribunal. This holy place houses the image of Nuestra Señora de la Portería.
* Our Lady of the Gate Grotto: Situated along the Olla riverbank is a sacred place where masses at times are being held. It is a small tourist destination for religious excursionists.

The 1st AniLinang Festival was held on October 2, 2016, as an initiative of the local government to promote the town&#x27;s laid-back, and peaceful way of life seen in its agricultural produce as well as in its indigenous cuisines.

SaGreMa Festival (San Gregorio Magno Majayjay), is a parochial festivity celebrated on September 3, the day when Saint Gregory, the town&#x27;s patron saint, became a pope, and March 12, the day he died. In the festival, Majayjayenos honor the saint for the fortunes of their town.

<text>Local 33–UNITE HERE, formerly the Graduate Employees and Students Organization (“GESO–UNITE HERE”), is a union of graduate student teachers and researchers at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.

Local 33 is affiliated with the international union UNITE HERE, which also represents Yale University&#x27;s service, maintenance, clerical, and technical workers. After more than three decades of organizing, Yale graduate workers submitted over 3,000 signed union authorization cards to the Hartford, Connecticut, office of the National Labor Relations Board, or NLRB, representing the greatest number of graduate workers who have ever supported unionizing. On January 9, 2023, Yale graduate workers won their union, with 1,860 members voting in favor and 179 voting against, a 10.4 to 1 ratio in favor of unionization. The proposed worker bargaining unit of about 4,000 graduate and professional school workers was the second largest election filing in the country in 2022.

Local 33 has received support from many prominent academics, including Corey Robin, Michael Denning, David Graeber, and Michael Bérubé, and elected officials, including Governor Dannel Malloy, Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, New Haven Mayor Toni Harp, US Senator Bernie Sanders, and US Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro.

==History==

In 2014, Local 33 took its campaign public at a rally on October 21, unveiling a petition with the photographs of over 1000 graduate students calling on Yale to negotiate the terms of a neutral election. Local 33 is asking Yale to address four main issues: fairness in teaching and funding; mental healthcare for graduate students; racial and gender equity; and affordable childcare.

On August 29, 2016, following the NLRB&#x27;s decision in &quot;Columbia&quot;, Local 33 members in 10 academic departments filed election petitions with the NLRB.

On January 25, 2017, the Regional Director for Region 1 of the National Labor Relations Board ordered union elections for graduate teachers in the Departments of East Asian Languages and Literatures, English, Geology and Geophysics, History, History of Art, Math, Physics, Political Science, and Sociology.

==Activities==

In 2012, GESO hosted a conference on academic labor entitled, &quot;The Changing University: An Interdisciplinary Symposium&quot;. In 2014, GESO re-emerged with two &quot;majority petition&quot; rallies. The first, held on April 30, presented a petition to the Yale administration with over 1000 signatures of graduate students. The second, on October 21, 2014, presented a petition with over 1000 photographs of graduate students paired with allies from the local unions, the community, and elected officials, including Governor Dannel Malloy, New Haven Mayor Toni Harp, and US Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro. In February 2015, GESO released a report on the expansion of Yale College, entitled &quot;Teaching in a Growing Yale: Critical Questions.&quot; GESO presented a petition with over 1100 signatures to the university in May 2015. The petition calls on Yale to &quot;begin contract negotiations on issues of immediate concern including funding security, racial and gender equity, and mental health care.&quot;

<text>Arnaud Vital was a cobbler in the Comté de Foix in the early fourteenth century. He is notable for appearing in Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie&#x27;s &quot;Montaillou&quot;. Originally from a peasant family in Prades d&#x27;Aillon, he moved to Montaillou living as a boarder in the house of the Belot family. He was later joined by his sister Raymonde who came to work as a servant in the Belot home.

Arnaud was a committed Albigensian and spent much time guiding parfaits through the mountains. He was also a great womanizer, the lover of Alazaïs Fauré whom he converted to Catharism. At one point he tried to force himself upon Raymonde Testanière, mistress to Bernard Belot, but she resisted him. Arnaud later married another servant in the Belot household named Raymonde. The couple lived with the Belots another two months before leaving and setting up their own home.

Vital was one of only two artisans in town the other being Raymond Maury the weaver. While his business was somewhat limited by the lack of money in the village he was successful enough to become only the third villager to add a solier to his home. He also became assistant bayle in the town to Bernard Clergue. His marriage was unhappy, however, he ignored his wife and continued to philander with women such as Raymonde Rives and Alazaïs Gavela.

<text>The NM142 (&quot;Norwegian Model&quot;) is an anti-tank missile carrier variant of the American M113 Armored Personnel Carrier, which has been fitted with a TOW2 turret developed in Norway by Kværner Eureka.

== Armament ==
The NM-142 mounts a turret containing a TOW2 guided anti-tank missile system, with one launch tube on each side of the turret.

Additionally, mounted on the commander&#x27;s hatch, there is an MG3 machine gun for use as secondary armament and in situations where the TOW2-system is unsuitable.

== Organization ==
The vehicle has a crew of four. The commander leads the crew, including designating targets, operating communication systems and navigating. The gunner is responsible for operating and maintaining the TOW2 weapon system. The loader assists the gunner, especially by reloading the launch tubes whenever necessary. Finally, the driver maneuvers the APC and is responsible for maintaining the engine, treads and other driving mechanisms.

Usually, a platoon consists of four NM-142s, led by a lieutenant (who also is the commander on one of the NM-142s). In some cases, three platoons are put together to constitute an anti-tank squadron, but individual platoons are also incorporated in various mechanized formations.

The Norwegian Army had approximately 100 NM-142s. By the end of the service life, all but 12 were withdrawn from service. These received some modifications and then named NM-142F1. As of 2021, all NM142 and NM142Fs have been withdrawn from active service.

== Turret==

Other nations have made variants using the same turret on other vehicles.

* Canada : M113 (TOW)
* Turkey: FNSS ACV-15 (ACV-ATV) 
* Switzerland: Mowag Piranha IB 6×6 ()

<doc id="1271989" wikidata="Q160869" url="?curid=1271989" title="Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)">
<text>Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (Russian: Николай Николаевич Романов (младший – &quot;the younger&quot;); 18 November 1856 – 5 January 1929) was a Russian general in World War I (1914–1918). The son of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1831–1891), and a grandson of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, he was commander in chief of the Imperial Russian Army units on the main front in the first year of the war, during the reign of his first cousin once removed, Nicholas II. Although held in high regard by Paul von Hindenburg, he struggled with the colossal task of leading Russia&#x27;s war effort against Germany, including strategy, tactics, logistics and coordination with the government. After the Gorlice–Tarnów offensive in 1915, Tsar Nicholas replaced the Grand Duke as commander-in-chief of the army. He later was a successful commander-in-chief in the Caucasus region. He was briefly recognized as emperor in 1922 in areas controlled by the White movement in the Russian Far East.

==Biography==
===Family===
A very tall man at , Nicholas, named after his paternal grandfather, the emperor, was born as the eldest son to Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaevich of Russia (1831–1891) and Alexandra Petrovna of Oldenburg (1838–1900) on 18 November 1856. His father was the sixth child and third son born to Nicholas I of Russia and his Empress consort Alexandra Fedorovna of Prussia (1798–1860). Alexandra Fedorovna was a daughter of Frederick William III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

Nicholas&#x27;s mother, his father&#x27;s first cousin&#x27;s daughter, was a daughter of Duke Konstantin Peter of Oldenburg (1812–1881) and Princess Therese of Nassau (1815–1871). His maternal grandfather was a son of Duke George of Oldenburg and Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, daughter of Paul I of Russia and Maria Fedorovna of Württemberg. (Catherine was later remarried to William I of Württemberg.) His maternal grandmother was a daughter of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau (1792–1839) and Princess Louise of Saxe-Hildburghausen. The Duke of Nassau was a son of Friedrich Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau (1768–1816) and Burgravine Louise Isabelle of Kirchberg. His paternal grandparents were Duke Karl Christian of Nassau-Weilburg (1735–1788) and Carolina of Orange-Nassau. Carolina was a daughter of William IV of Orange and Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange. Anne was the eldest daughter of George II of Great Britain and Caroline of Ansbach.

Grand Duke Nicholas was the first cousin once removed of Tsar Nicholas II. To distinguish between them, the Grand Duke was often known within the Imperial family as &quot;Nikolasha&quot;: the Grand Duke was also known as &quot;Nicholas the Tall&quot; while the tsar was &quot;Nicholas the Short&quot;.

===Early military career===

Grand Duke Nicholas was educated at the school of military engineers and received his commission in 1873. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), he was on the staff of his father who was commander in chief. He distinguished himself on two occasions in this war. He worked his way up through all the ranks until he was appointed commander of the Guard Hussar Regiment in 1884.

He had a reputation as a tough commander, yet one respected by his troops. His experience was more as a trainer of soldiers than a leader in battle. Nicholas was a very religious man, praying in the morning and at night as well as before and after meals. He was happiest in the country, hunting or caring for his estates.

By 1895, he was inspector-general of the cavalry, a post he held for 10 years. His tenure has been judged a success with reforms in training, cavalry schools, cavalry reserves and the remount services. He was not given an active command during the Russo-Japanese War, perhaps because the tsar did not wish to hazard the prestige of the Romanovs and because he wanted a loyal general in command at home in case of domestic disturbances. Thus, Nicholas did not have the opportunity to gain experience in battlefield command.

Grand Duke Nicholas played a crucial role during the Revolution of 1905. With disorder spreading and the future of the dynasty at stake, the tsar had a choice of instituting the reforms suggested by Count Sergei Witte or imposing a military dictatorship. The only man with the prestige to keep the allegiance of the army in such a coup was the grand duke. The tsar asked him to assume the role of a military dictator. In an emotional scene at the palace, Nicholas refused, drew his pistol and threatened to shoot himself on the spot if the tsar did not endorse Witte&#x27;s plan. This act was decisive in forcing Nicholas II to agree to the reforms.

From 1905 to the outbreak of World War I, he was commander of the Petersburg Military District. He had the reputation there of appointing men of humble origins to positions of authority. The lessons of the Russo-Japanese War were drilled into his men.

===Marriage===

On 29 April 1907, Nicholas married Princess Anastasia of Montenegro (1869–1935), the daughter of King Nicholas I, and sister of Princess Milica, who had married Nicholas&#x27;s brother, Grand Duke Peter. They had no children. She had previously been married to George Maximilianovich, 6th Duke of Leuchtenberg, by whom she had two children, until their divorce in 1906. Since the Montenegrins were a fiercely Slavic, anti-Ottoman people from the Balkans, Anastasia reinforced the Pan-Slavic tendencies of Nicholas.

===Hunting===

Nicholas was a hunter. Ownership of borzoi hounds was restricted to members of the highest nobility, and Nicholas&#x27;s packs were well-known. After the revolution, the dogs in his kennel were sold off by the new Soviet government. In his lifetime, Nicholas and his dogs caught hundreds of wolves. A pair of borzoi were used, which caught the wolf, one on each side, while Nicholas dismounted and cut the wolf&#x27;s throat with a knife. Hunting was his major recreation, and he traveled in his private train across Russia with his horses and dogs, hunting while on his rounds of inspection.

===World War I===
====Eastern Front====
The grand duke had no part in the planning and preparations for World War I, that being the responsibility of General Vladimir Sukhomlinov and the general staff. On the eve of the outbreak of World War I, his first cousin once removed, the Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, yielded to the entreaties of his ministers and appointed Grand Duke Nicholas to the supreme command. He was 57 years old and had never commanded armies in the field before, although he had spent almost all of his life on active service. His appointment was popular in the army. He was given responsibility for the largest army ever put into the field up to that date. He recalled that &quot;... on receipt of the Imperial order, he spent much of his time crying because he did not know how to approach his new duties&quot;.

On 14 August 1914, he published the Manifesto to the Polish Nation.

Grand Duke Nicholas was responsible for all Russian forces fighting against Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. He decided that their major effort must be in Poland, which thrust toward Germany like a salient, flanked by German East Prussia in the north, and Austro-Hungarian Galicia in the south. He planned to attend first to the flanks and when they were secure to invade German Silesia. In the north poor coordination of the two invading Russian armies resulted in the disaster of Tannenberg. In the south they conquered much of Galicia. Their subsequent move toward Silesia was blocked by the Battle of the Vistula River and Battle of Łódź. The grand duke picked and chose from the various plans offered by his generals. The grand duke begged for the artillery and ammunition they desperately lacked, so he could not embark on a coherent plan for victory. Nicholas came to power because of his royal status, and the tsar&#x27;s belief that God was guiding his decision. He lacked the broad strategic sense and the ruthless drive to command all the Russian armies. His headquarters had a curiously calm atmosphere, despite the many defeats and the millions of casualties. He failed in terms of strategy and tactics, as well as logistics, selection of generals, maintaining morale, and gaining support from the government. On a personal level he was well liked by both officers and men.
After the Great Retreat of the Russian army, the Chief of the General Staff Nikolai Yanushkevich, with the full support of the Grand Duke Nicholas, ordered the army to devastate the border territories and expel the &quot;enemy&quot; nations within. The Russian authorities launched pogroms against German populations in Russian cities, massacred Jews in their towns and villages and deported 500,000 Jews and 250,000 Germans into the Russian interior. On 11 June 1915, a pogrom began against Germans in Petrograd, with over 500 factories, stores and offices looted and mob violence unleashed against Germans. The Russian military leadership regarded Muslims, Germans and Poles as traitors and spies, while Jews were considered political unreliables.

As a result of his failure, the tsar removed the Grand Duke as commander of the Russian armed forces on 21 August 1915 and took personal command.

====The Caucasus====
Upon his dismissal, the grand duke was immediately appointed commander-in-chief and viceroy in the Caucasus (replacing Count Illarion Vorontsov-Dashkov). While the grand duke was officially in command, General Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich was the driving figure in the Russian Caucasus Army, so the grand duke focused on the civil administration. Their opponent was the Ottoman Empire. While the grand duke was in command, the Russian army sent an expeditionary force through to Persia to link up with British troops. Also in 1916, the Russian army captured the fortress town of Erzerum, the port of Trebizond and the town of Erzincan. The Turks responded with an offensive of their own. Fighting around Lake Van swung back and forth, but ultimately proved inconclusive.

It is reported that, while visiting the garrison of Kostroma he met Said Nursi, a famous Muslim cleric who was a prisoner of war. Because of Nursi&#x27;s disrespectful attitude (he refused to greet the grand duke first saying that the faithful were more senior than infidels), the grand duke gave an order to execute him. But after seeing Nursi&#x27;s devotion to his religion during his last prayer, the grand duke changed his mind and amnestied Nursi. However, nothing in the Grand Duke&#x27;s record suggests that he would have even considered such a war crime. At the time he was urging the tsar to set up colleges for training Muslim clerics so they would not have to study abroad.

Nicholas tried to have a railway built from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories with a view to bringing up more supplies for a new offensive in 1917. But, in March 1917, the tsar was overthrown and the Russian army began slowly to fall apart.

== Revolution ==
The February Revolution found Nicholas in the Caucasus. He was appointed by the emperor, in his last official act, as the supreme commander in chief, and was wildly received as he journeyed to headquarters in Mogilev; however, within 24 hours of his arrival, the new prime minister, Prince Georgy Lvov, cancelled his appointment. Nicholas spent the next two years in Crimea, sometimes under house arrest, taking little part in politics. There appears to have been some sentiment to have him head the White Army forces active in southern Russia at the time, but the leaders in charge, especially General Anton Denikin, were afraid that a strong monarchist figurehead would alienate the more left leaning constituents of the movement. He and his wife escaped just ahead of the Red Army in April 1919, aboard the British Royal Navy battleship HMS &quot;Marlborough&quot;.

On 8 August 1922, Nicholas was proclaimed as the emperor of all the Russias by the Zemsky Sobor of the Priamurye region in the Far East by White Army general Mikhail Diterikhs. Nicholas was already living abroad and consequently was not present. Two months later the Priamurye region fell to the Bolsheviks.

== In exile ==
After a stay in Genoa as a guest of his brother-in-law, King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, Nicholas and his wife took up residence in a small chateau at Choigny, 20 miles outside of Paris. He was under the protection of the French secret police as well as by a small number of faithful Cossack retainers.

He became the symbolic figurehead of an anti-Soviet Russian monarchist movement, after assuming on 16 November 1924 the supreme command of all Russian forces in exile and thus of the Russian All-Military Union, which had been founded in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by General Pyotr Wrangel two months prior. The monarchists made plans to send agents into Russia. Conversely a top priority of the Soviet secret police was to penetrate this monarchist organization and to kidnap Nicholas. They were successful in the former, infiltrating the group with spies (OGPU later lured the anti-Bolshevik British master spy Sidney Reilly back to the Soviet Union (1925) where he was killed). They did not succeed however, in kidnapping Nicholas. As late as June 1927, the monarchists were able to set off a bomb at the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow.

Grand Duke Nicholas died on 5 January 1929 of natural causes on the French Riviera, where he had gone to escape the rigors of winter. He was originally buried in the church of St. Michael the Archangel Church in Cannes, France. In 2014 Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia (1922–2014) and Prince Dimitri Romanov (1926–2016) requested the transfer of his remains. The bodies of Nicholas Nikolaevich and his wife were re-buried in Moscow at the World War I memorial military cemetery in May 2015.

==Legacy==
Historian Richard Pipes said he was the most outstanding member of the Romanov dynasty in its final decades and the only member of the family to enjoy the respect and admiration of ordinary Russians.

<text>Billy James Hargis (August 3, 1925 – November 27, 2004) was an American Christian evangelist. At the height of his popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, his &quot;Christian Crusade&quot; ministry was broadcast on over 500 radio stations and 250 television stations. He promoted an anti-Communist, segregationist message as well as evangelizing, and founded a radio station, monthly newspaper, and a college in Tulsa, Oklahoma to support his ministries. In 1974, several students at his American Christian College accused Hargis of sexual misconduct; however, the Tulsa district attorney found no evidence of wrongdoing. Hargis went into partial retirement, and the college closed in 1977. He continued to publish his newspaper and write books.

==Biography==
Hargis was adopted by a railroad employee, Jimmie Earsel Hargis, and his wife, Laura Lucille Hargis. By the time the boy was ten, his adoptive mother was in poor health and close to death. The boy had been baptized, and had few pleasures other than the family&#x27;s daily Bible readings because his family was too poor during the Great Depression to own a radio. When his mother was hospitalized, Hargis promised to devote himself to God if she was spared from death. She recovered and, at age 17, Hargis was ordained in the Disciples of Christ denomination, even before completing Bible college. After a few years, he left his pastorate for a ministry of radio preaching.

In 1943, Hargis entered Ozark Bible College in Bentonville, Arkansas, and studied there for one year. By 1947, when he became concerned about Communism, he was pastor of the First Christian Church in Sapulpa, a city west of Tulsa. He later received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Pikes Peak Bible Seminary in 1957 and a theology degree from Burton College and Seminary in Colorado in 1958.

In 1950, he established an organization called the Christian Crusade. In the mid-1950s, Hargis was closely associated with the evangelist Carl McIntire and in the early 1960s Hargis had developed a close relationship with the resigned United States Army Major General Edwin Walker, but he increasingly went his own way in preaching anti-Communism. His targets included government and popular singers. In 1957, the Disciples of Christ denomination withdrew his ordination because he attacked other churches in his anti-Communist crusade. Still, by then, Hargis&#x27; radio program was bringing in $1 million annually, and he had established a degree of financial and theological independence. In 1960, the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated Hargis, suspecting him of being linked to recent bombing attacks on Little Rock public schools and of planning to bomb Philander Smith College. No evidence was found and no charges were filed. On May 31, 1961, Bob Jones University honored Hargis with an honorary Doctor of Laws.

1966 Hargis founded a congregation in Tulsa, Oklahoma called the Church of the Christian Crusade. This was part of a complex of organizations that he founded in Tulsa, including the American Christian College in 1971 and the &quot;Christian Crusade&quot; monthly newspaper.

==Marriage and family==
Hargis married Betty Jane Secrest of Sciotoville, Ohio in 1951. They had three daughters and a son, Billy James Hargis II, who died on September 9, 2013, and Bryan Joseph Hargis who died in infancy. His grandson, Billy James Hargis III, was born on May 10, 1989, and currently resides in Houston, Texas.

==Career==
Hargis&#x27; motto was &quot;All I want to do is preach Jesus and save America.&quot;
Drawing on premillennialist theology, Hargis believed national and world events were part of a cosmic struggle, where the ultimate actors were Christ and Satan. To him communism represented the latter, the United States represented the former. He used this as justification for why the United States should return to what he believed were its founding Christian ideals.

===Positions and activities===
Hargis preached on cultural issues: against sex education and Communism, and for the return of prayer and Bible reading to public schools, long before the rise of the late 20th century Religious Right. His belief in conspiracy theories led to a belief that the government, the media, and pop culture figures were promoting &quot;communism&quot; in the late 1960s. Hargis&#x27; subordinate, Rev. David Noebel, wrote the short work, &quot;Communism, Hypnotism and the Beatles&quot; (1965), which he expanded into &quot;Rhythm, Riots and Revolution&quot; the following year. Both pamphlets were published by the Christian Crusade. Hargis claimed to have written a speech for the infamous anti-communist Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.

Hargis was a member of the John Birch Society and strongly favored segregation, arguing that desegregation violated the Eighth Commandment by allowing the government to steal from one&#x27;s property. He also accused Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of being Communist-educated, and published Dr. James D. Bales&#x27; anti-King book, &quot;The Martin Luther King Story&quot;. He opposed the crusades of rival evangelist Billy Graham and endorsed George Wallace in the 1968 presidential election in part because of Republican nominee Richard Nixon&#x27;s relationship with Graham. Along with his friend Carl McIntire, who was staunchly anti-Catholic, Hargis was one of the most influential people in a movement later known as the &quot;Old Christian Right.&quot; However, both Hargis and McIntire lost influence by failing to capitalize on the fact that most American Catholics were staunchly anti-communist.

Hargis addressed audiences with his revival style. He was the author of at least 100 books, including &quot;The Far Left&quot;, and &quot;Why I Fight for a Christian America&quot;. In addition, his organization published a pamphlet on sex education, entitled &quot;Is the School House the Proper Place to Teach Raw Sex?&quot;, by Gordon V. Drake, the Christian Crusade&#x27;s educational director.

In 1964, Hargis supported Republican Senator Barry Goldwater in that year&#x27;s presidential race. However, Goldwater lost the election in a landslide and the Old Christian Right soon began an irreversible downward spiral. A movement known as the New Christian Right, which sought to capitalize on the mistakes of the Old Christian Right by embracing Roman Catholicism, was formed in the late 1970s following the loss of the Vietnam War. Many had feared the defeat in Vietnam would revive the Counterculture of the 1960s.

=== Red Lion case ===
On November 25, 1964, Hargis attacked a book and an article called “Hate Clubs of the Air&quot; he believed to be written about him in the Nation magazine by journalist Fred J. Cook in a recorded broadcast heard on WGCB in Red Lion, Pennsylvania. When the radio station refused a right of reply, Cook successfully sued the station who then unsuccessfully countersued the FCC for First Amendment violations. This ultimately lead to a landmark 1969 United States Supreme Court decision &quot;Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC&quot; upholding the fairness doctrine.

==Founding of institutions==
In 1950, Hargis founded the Christian Crusade, an interdenominational movement. In 1964, the Internal Revenue Service alleged that Hargis&#x27; involvement in political matters violated the terms of the Internal Revenue Code for religious institutions and withdrew the tax-exempt status of the Christian Crusade. Richard Viguerie, a pioneer in using direct mail in the 1970s and 1980s to support conservative movements and their causes, began his career working for Hargis. Viguerie developed direct mail databases to solicit small donations in an average of 2000 mailings a day from a wide field of ideological supporters. At the time, Hargis had reported that the average contribution to his movement was $4, from a constituency of 250,000 donors, and it was receiving $1 million annually. 

In association with his Christian Crusade Hargis published the monthly &quot;Christian Crusade Newspaper&quot;, with a circulation of 55,000, and &quot;Weekly Crusade.&quot;

He founded the David Livingstone Missionary Foundation, which operated hospitals, orphanages, leprosy villages, medical vans, and mission services in South Korea, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines, and Africa.

Hargis founded American Christian College in Tulsa during 1971 to teach Christian principles and provide an alternative to perceived left-wing and counterculture influences. When asked what was taught there, Hargis said, &quot;anti-communism, anti-socialism, anti-welfare state, anti-Russia, anti-China, a literal interpretation of the Bible, and states&#x27; rights.&quot;

Concerned with the liberalization of abortion laws following the United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, Hargis launched Americans Against Abortion in 1973 with David Noebel as its leader. Noebel went on to author his book &quot;Slaughter of the Innocents&quot; that was published by the American Christian College within months of the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision, and wrote many provocative articles for fundamentalist publications on the abortion issue.

He also started a television show &quot;Billy James Hargis and his All-American Kids.&quot; It was sold to independent television stations. Students from the college performed in the musical group.

==Scandal==
In 1974, when Hargis was nearly fifty, he was forced to resign as president of American Christian College because of allegations that he had seduced college students. Two of his students claimed that they had had sexual relations with Hargis—one was female, one was male. Other students corroborated the story. Hargis denied the sexual allegations until his death, both publicly and in his autobiography, &quot;My Great Mistake&quot; (1985). The account was reported by &quot;Time&quot; in 1976, along with other alleged incidents at Hargis&#x27; farm outside of Neosho, Missouri, and while on tour with his &quot;All American Kids&quot; musical group. The Tulsa district attorney investigated but never brought charges against Hargis. The local newspapers, the &quot;Tulsa World&quot; and the defunct &quot;Tulsa Tribune,&quot; declined to publish the accusations.

When Hargis stepped down as president of American Christian College, he was succeeded by former vice president David Noebel. In February 1975, Hargis tried to regain control of the college but was rejected by its board. By September, he returned to his other ministries. They were said to welcome him after he repented. As Jess Pedigo, president of the David Livingstone Society, said, &quot;There was a danger of bankruptcy.&quot; Hargis did not give the deed to the property to the college for months after leaving, which prevented it from gaining regional accreditation. In addition, he withheld the fundraising lists, which all the organizations had previously shared. With declining enrollment after the scandal became public, the college closed in 1977. In 1985 Hargis told a Tulsa reporter, &quot;I was guilty of sin, but not the sin I was accused of.&quot;

About 1976, he eventually retreated to his Missouri farm, where he continued to work, resuming a greatly diminished ministry, issuing daily and weekly radio broadcasts. He continued to publish the monthly newspaper, &quot;The Christian Crusade Newspaper,&quot; and wrote numerous books.

In his final years, suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and a series of heart attacks, Hargis died in a Tulsa nursing home on November 27, 2004, at seventy-nine.

==Legacy==
His son, Billy James Hargis II, continued his ministry until his own death. Hargis&#x27; organization and college also established and operated Tulsa radio station KBJH (FM 98.5) in the early 1970s. After the college&#x27;s closing and the demise of his ministry, the station was sold to Epperson Broadcasting.

Hargis and his church owned and operated a small AM radio station in Port Neches, Texas, from 1980 to the early 1990s. KDLF radio (so named after the David Livingston Foundation) played Southern Gospel Music and religious programming until it was sold around 1993. In the latter days of Hargis&#x27; ownership, the radio station had a local marketing agreement to others but was required to play Hargis&#x27; hour-long program daily.

Hargis&#x27; papers, described as &quot;a goldmine for students of American politics,&quot; are held at the special collections department of the University of Arkansas Libraries in Fayetteville.

==In popular culture==
In the late 1970s, the popular WNBC disk jockey Imus in the Morning would occasionally do a segment where he would present himself as a &quot;holy roller&quot; evangelical Christian preacher named &quot;Reverend Billy Sol Hargis&quot;. These brief sermons typically promoted a product which would give some form of spiritual benefit to the buyer of the product. One such product was &quot;Sin Soap&quot; which would purify any part of a person&#x27;s body which had committed an act of sin. &quot;Reverend Billy Sol Hargis&quot; was an intentional satire of Christian ministers who were more interested in financial gain than the spiritual needs of their followers.

Hargis also appears in the Stephen King novel 11.22.63. The novel looks at the attempt on the life of General Edwin Walker (and associate of Hargis as part of Operation Midnight Ride), in the build up to the assassination of John F Kennedy.

<text>Pool is a series of cue sports played on a billiard table. The table has six pockets along the , into which balls are shot. Of the many different pool games, the most popular include: eight-ball, blackball, nine-ball, ten-ball, seven-ball, straight pool, one-pocket, and bank pool. Eight-ball is the most frequently played discipline of pool, and it is often thought of as synonymous with &quot;pool&quot;.

The generic term pocket billiards is sometimes also used, and favored by some pool-industry bodies, but is technically a broader classification, including games such as snooker, Russian pyramid, and kaisa, which are not referred to as pool games. There are also hybrid games combining aspects of both pool and carom billiards, such as American four-ball billiards, bottle pool, cowboy pool, and English billiards.

==Etymology==
The etymology of &quot;pool&quot; is uncertain. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; speculates that &quot;pool&quot; and other games with collective stakes is derived from the French &quot;poule&quot; (literally translated &quot;hen&quot;), in which the &quot;poule&quot; is the collected prize, originating from &quot;jeu de la poule,&quot; a game that is thought to have been played during the Middle Ages. Supposedly, participants would put an equal amount of money into a pot and throw stones at a live chicken, and the person who successfully hit the chicken first would win the pooled money. Alternatively the term could derive from the verb &quot;to pool&quot; in the sense of combining objects or stakes. The oldest use of the word &quot;pool&quot; to describe a billiards-like game was made in 1797 in a Virginia newspaper. The OED defines it as generally &quot;any of various types of billiards for two or more players&quot; but goes on to note that the first specific meaning of &quot;a game in which each player uses a cue ball of a distinctive colour to pocket the balls of the other player(s) in a certain order, the winner taking all the stakes submitted at the start of the contest&quot; is now obsolete, and its other specific definitions are all for games that originate in the United States. In the British Empire for most of the nineteenth through early twentieth century, &quot;pool&quot; referred specifically to the game of life pool.

Although skittle pool is played on a pocketless carom billiards table, the term &quot;pool&quot; later stuck to all new games of pocket billiards as the sport gained in popularity in the United States, and so outside the cue sports industry, which has long favored the more formal term &quot;pocket billiards&quot;, the common name for the sport has remained &quot;pool&quot;. The &quot;OxfordDictionaries.com&quot; definition no longer even provides the obsolete meaning found in the print edition, and refers only to the typical game &quot;using two sets [each] of seven coloured and numbered balls ... with one black ball and a white cue ball&quot; on a table with pockets.

==History==

With the exception of one-pocket, games typically called &quot;pool&quot; today are descended from two English games imported to the United States during the 19th century. The first was English billiards which became American four-ball billiards, essentially the same game but with an extra red to increase scoring opportunities. It was the most popular billiards game in the mid-19th century until dethroned by the carom game straight rail. American four-ball tournaments tried switching to carom tables in the 1870s but this did not save it from being doomed to obscurity; the last professional tournament was held in 1876. Cowboy pool is a surviving member of this group of games.

The second and more influential game was pyramid pool. By 1850 a variant called fifteen-ball pool became popular. Both games were supplanted by continuous pool in 1888, the immediate forerunner of straight pool (1910). New games introduced at the turn of the 20th century include Kelly pool and eight-ball. The distinctive appearance of pool balls with their many colors and division between solid and striped balls came about by 1889. Prior to this, object balls were uniformly deep-red and differentiated only by numbers. English pyramid pool and life pool players were the first to adopt balls with different colors. The stripes were the last addition.

==Equipment==

Pool is played on a six pocket table. Modern pool tables generally range in size from , to .

Under World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA) official equipment specifications, pool balls weigh from and have a diameter of , plus or minus . Modern coin-operated pool tables generally use one of three methods to distinguish and return the cue ball to the front of the table while the numbered balls return to an inaccessible receptacle until paid for again: the cue ball is larger and heavier than the other balls, or denser and heavier, or has a magnetic core. 
Modern cue sticks are generally long for pool while cues prior to 1980 were designed for straight pool and had an average length of . By comparison, carom billiards cues are generally shorter with larger tips, and snooker cues longer with smaller tips.

==Game types==
===Racked games===
These are games descended from the early 19th century games of pyramid pool and fifteen-ball pool which required balls to be racked due to the large number of them on the table. Of the other pyramid traditions of Continental Europe, only Russian pyramid survives. Snooker, originally known as snooker&#x27;s pool, can be considered a member of this family. 

====Rotation games====

Rotation games require players to make legal contact with the lowest numbered ball on the table or a foul is called. The earliest rotation game, originally known as 61, started off as a variant of fifteen-ball pool during the mid-nineteenth century. The name &quot;rotation&quot; came from how the balls were placed around the table in its unracked offshoot Chicago. 61 has spawned many variations of its own such as American rotation, nine-ball, ten-ball, and Kelly pool. Of these, nine-ball is the most popular and the predominant professional game with ten-ball as the second-most prominent. There are many local and regional tours and tournaments that are contested with nine-ball. The World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA) publishes the world standardized rules. The European professional circuit has instituted rules changes to make it more difficult to achieve a legal break shot.

The largest nine-ball tournaments are the US Open Nine-ball Championship and the WPA World Nine-ball Championship for men and women. A hotly contested event is the annual Mosconi Cup, which pits invitational European and U.S. teams against each other in one-on-one and nine-ball matches over a period of several days. The Mosconi Cup games are played under the more stringent European rules, as of 2007.

====Straight pool====
Also known as 14.1 continuous, this game originated as a slight modification of continuous pool, another offshoot of fifteen-ball pool. The shooter may attempt to shoot at any object ball on the table. The goal is to reach a set number of points determined by agreement before the game. One point is scored for each object ball pocketed where no is made. A typical game might require a player to score 100 points to win. In professional competition, straight pool is usually played to 125 points. Straight pool is a &quot;&quot; game, meaning the player must indicate the intended object ball and pocket on every shot.

====Eight-ball====
The most commonly played pool game is eight-ball, which appeared at the beginning of the twentieth century. It is often thought of as synonymous with &quot;pool&quot;. The game has numerous variations, mostly regional. It is the second most played professional pool game, after nine-ball, and for the last several decades ahead of straight pool.

The goal of eight-ball, which is played with a full rack of fifteen balls and the cue ball, is to claim a suit (commonly stripes or solids in the US, and reds or yellows in the UK), pocket all of them, then legally pocket the 8 ball, while denying one&#x27;s opponent opportunities to do the same with their suit, and without sinking the 8 ball early by accident. In the United Kingdom the game is commonly played in pubs, and it is competitively played in leagues on both sides of the Atlantic. The most prestigious tournaments including the World Open are sponsored and sanctioned by the International Pool Tour. Rules vary widely from place to place (and between continents to such an extent that British-style eight-ball pool/blackball is properly regarded as a separate game in its own right). Pool halls in North America are increasingly settling upon the World Pool-Billiard Association International Standardized Rules. But tavern eight-ball (also known as &quot;&quot;), typically played on smaller, coin-operated tables and in a &quot;winner keeps the table&quot; manner, can differ significantly even between two venues in the same city. The growth of local, regional and national amateur leagues may alleviate this confusion eventually.

====One-pocket====

One-pocket owes its origins to 18th century &quot;cramp&quot; (handicapped) games. It is a strategic game for two players in which each player is assigned one of the corner pockets on the table. This is the only pocket into which that player can legally pocket balls. The first player to pocket the majority of the balls (8) into their pocket wins the game. The game requires far more defensive strategy than offensive strategy, much unlike eight-ball, nine-ball, or straight pool. Most times, accomplished players choose to position balls near their pocket instead of trying to actually pocket them. This allows them to control the game by forcing their opponent to be on defense instead of taking a low percentage shot that could result in a loss of game. These low percentage shots are known as &quot;flyers&quot; by one-pocket aficionados.

====Bank pool====

Bank pool can be played with a full rack (can be a &quot;long&quot; game), but is more typically played with nine balls (frequently called &quot;nine-ball bank&quot;). The balls are racked in nine-ball formation, but in no particular order. The object of the game is simple: to be the first player to bank five balls in any order (eight balls when played with a full rack). Penalties and fouls are similar to one pocket in that the player committing the foul must spot a ball for each foul. This must be done before the incoming player shoots.

===Artistic pool===
Artistic pool is the competitive discipline of trick shots inspired by its carom equivalent. Played on pool or snooker tables, players must complete a set number of shots of varying difficulty.

===Hybrid carom or obstacle games===
Cowboy pool and bottle pool are games involving only a few balls which are placed at specific spots on the table. Elements of their games go back to the eighteenth century before balls needed to be racked. Bottle pool shares traits with pin billiards games such as Danish pin billiards. Cowboy pool is a descendant of English billiards. Kaisa is a similar game played with different equipment.

==Governing bodies==

As a competitive sport, pool is governed internationally by the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA), which has multi-national, regional affiliates comprising the All Africa Pool Association (AAPA), Asian Pocket Billiard Union (APBU, including the Middle East), Billiard Congress of America (BCA, Canada and the US), Confederación Panamericana de Billar (CPB, Latin America and Caribbean), European Pocket Billiard Federation (EPBF, including Russia and the Near East), and Oceania Pocket Billiard Association (OPBA, Australia, New Zealand, Pacific islands).
The WPA represents pool in the World Confederation of Billiards Sports, which in turn represents all forms of cue sports (including carom billiards and snooker) in the International Olympic Committee.

<doc id="1272006" wikidata="Q5224788" url="?curid=1272006" title="Darren Bennett (football player)">
<text>Darren Bennett (born 9 January 1965) is an Australian former professional player of Australian rules football and American football. He played in the United States as a punter in the National Football League (NFL).

As an Australian rules footballer, he played for East Fremantle in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) between 1982 and 1987 and then in the Australian Football League (AFL) for the West Coast Eagles and the Melbourne Football Club. He was most successful at Melbourne, where he was named as one of the club&#x27;s 150 Heroes of the last 150 years, kicking 208 goals from just 74 games for the club.

As an American football player, following a three-club career in the National Football League he is regarded as one of the greatest players of the 1990s and a member of the NFL 1990s All-Decade Team.

This combination made him notable as arguably the most successful of the Australian sportsmen linked to professional American football in history.

==Australian rules football career==
Born in Sydney, Bennett grew up in Perth, Western Australia, where he began playing Australian rules football, first playing senior football with East Fremantle in the West Australian Football League. His career with the Sharks was severely affected by injuries to his knee, which kept him out for over a season during 1985 and 1986 – in the interim denying him a WAFL premiership. However, training with former star Harry Neesham allowed Bennett to be fit for the 1986 finals, and in the second semi he became the first player ever to score ten goals in a WA(N)FL final.

As a consequence of his devastating late-1986 form, which included eleven goals in the last round against Claremont as well as his second semi effort, Bennett was recruited to be a member of the West Coast Eagles&#x27; inaugural squad in 1987. A serious knee injury curtailed his career with the Eagles after four games. Released by the Eagles, at the end of the 1988 season, he was drafted by the Melbourne Demons with the 13th selection in the 1988 VFL Draft. In both 1989 (34 goals) and 1990 (87 goals) Bennett led the Demons&#x27; goalkicking.

Bennett was known for kicking long goals, torpedo punts and taking strong marks.

Bennett was regarded as one of Melbourne&#x27;s finest players in the early 1990s. But injuries caught up with him, and he played just two games in 1993. After the season, Bennett quietly retired from the Australian Football League, having totalled 78 games and 215 goals.

Most pre- or early 1990s Australian rules players had other jobs besides playing football; Bennett worked as a youth counsellor, and until being drafted by Melbourne planned to work on a shrimp boat. He participated in an exhibition match at SkyDome in Toronto in 1989; it is believed that Bennett was first exposed to American football during that trip.

==NFL career==
Bennett married in 1993. Having won airplane tickets to the US he and his wife went on their honeymoon to California in November 1993, where Bennett asked Chris Jones, his fitness coach at Melbourne to contact the coaching staff of the San Diego Chargers and asked for a tryout. While the coaches laughed at Bennett when the first snap hit him in the face, they liked his kicks and invited him to the 1994 minicamp. Bennett kicked during the 1994 preseason then spent the season with the Chargers&#x27; practice squad.

During the spring of 1995, the Chargers sent him to the Amsterdam Admirals of NFL Europe, where he led the league in net punting average and earned all-league honours. That fall, he became the Chargers&#x27; regular punter. In his rookie season, he finished second in the NFL in punting average and made the AFC Pro Bowl team. He went on to establish himself as arguably the best punter in the NFL for the rest of the 1990s. Despite playing in the league for only half of that decade, he was named as the punter on the NFL&#x27;s All-Decade Team for the 1990s.

Bennett&#x27;s initial 1995 contract with the Chargers was, while the NFL rookie minimum of $119,000 plus a $30,000 Pro Bowl bonus, much more than the salaries of Australian rules players. On 7 August 1999, Bennett returned home with his adoptive sport and took part in Australia&#x27;s first American Bowl in Sydney&#x27;s brand new Stadium Australia against the Denver Broncos.

Bennett was named to another Pro Bowl team in 2000, and continued to be one of the league&#x27;s leading punters well into the 21st century. Going into the 2004 season, he had averaged 43.8 yards per punt, averaged 27 punts per season inside the 20-yard-line, and had only three blocked punts in his career (two of which happened when the Chargers had only 10 men on the field). As a former Aussie rules player, and considerably larger than most specialist kickers in American football ( and ), he did not shy away from physical contact on special teams. This willingness to hit, rare among kickers, was never more evident than when he knocked an opposing punt returner out cold in his rookie season. In 2004, after 144 games for the Chargers, he signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Vikings, where he spent one season until being injured in pre-season and then cut in September 2005. However, he was recalled by the team in December 2005, after starting punter Chris Kluwe (who had replaced him on the Vikings squad) was injured; Bennett was signed to a temporary contract. He played one game before being released by the Vikings, having made his final NFL appearance after 15 Vikings games and a total of 159 NFL games.

Bennett is also credited for the introduction into the NFL of the &quot;Aussie Rules kick&quot; or &quot;drop punt&quot; as it is known in Australia. The technique was instrumental in the advancement of Australians into the NFL, and is a widely accepted punt now in all levels of football from NFL, NCAA and high schools around the country.

Bennett was named to the San Diego Chargers 50th Anniversary Team in 2009. He was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame in 2012, the first time the Chargers allowed fans to decide the newest member.

==Personal life==
Bennett and his wife Rosemary reside in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and became US citizens in 2010. One of their sons, Thomas, followed Bennett into punting, and played college football at Baylor and Tulsa. Their other son, William, died in August 2020 at the age from 25 from Duchenne muscular dystrophy; Bennett is deeply involved with charities associated with that disease.

Bennett coaches high school kickers and punters in San Diego and Tulsa and mentors high school, NCAA and NFL players. Through a partnership with Puntfactory Australia, he mentors Australian punters playing NCAA football in the United States.

Bennett and fellow former punter Sav Rocca established a camp to help aspiring Australia punters.

<text>Onslow College is a state co-educational secondary school located in Johnsonville, a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand. In 2022 it had 1405 students. The current principal is Sheena Millar.

==History==
Onslow College opened in 1956 to serve Wellington&#x27;s rapidly growing northern suburbs. It was named after the 4th Earl of Onslow, governor of New Zealand from 1889 to 1892.

The school roll grew from 201 third form pupils in 1956 to 1180 pupils in 1969.

Former principal Stuart Martin described the &quot;Onslow Way&quot; as &quot;socially liberal but educationally conservative, decile 10 but physically run down&quot;. In 1969, Peggy-Anne Wendelken became New Zealand&#x27;s first woman chair of a school board of governors; at this time Onslow&#x27;s board had student representation, twenty years before this became a legal requirement.

The school has not had a school uniform since 1974 when it was abolished following student protest, despite the strong opposition of the Headmaster. In 2016 Onslow was one of the first schools in the region to have gender-neutral toilets for students.

Several staff have received awards for teaching excellence. Terry Burrell, received the prestigious Prime Minister&#x27;s Science Teacher Prize in 2014, and the same year Esme Danielsen (Maths) received a Woolf Fisher Fellowship.

Onslow students won The Prime Minister&#x27;s Future Scientist Prize in 2009, 2016 and 2018.

Music – Smokefree Rockquest Wellington regional finalists in 2021 were Obsidian Sun. In 2016 Onslow College bands and individuals took out five of the eight awards the Regional Final: Best Vocalist – Raquel Abolins-Reid, Musicianship Award – Noah Spargo, Best Lyricist – Sarah Mc Bride, 3rd placed band – Bird on a Wire, 1st placed band and overall winners of the Wellington Regional Final – Retrospect.

In 2017 Onslow College won the Wellington regional &quot;Festival Cup&quot; for the school best representing the spirit of the Big Sing, a school choral festival organised by the New Zealand Choral Federation.

On 13 February 1997, 18-year-old former student Nicholas Hawker murdered 15-year-old St Mary&#x27;s College student Vanessa Woodman on the school&#x27;s grounds. Hawker was sentenced to life imprisonment with a 10-year non-parole period. He was released on parole in 2015, but is not allowed in the North Island.

== School Buildings ==
On Friday 25 October 2024 the school received an engineering report on two of the school&#x27;s blocks stating they were earthquake prone. The first building listed was the O block which was discovered to have a New Building Standard (NBS) ratting of 30%, with an inner stairwell having a ratting of 15% and the building having a 6% inter-story drift between floors. The second building listed was the Gym (Block Q) which has an NBS ratting of 15% with the celling braces posing the greatest risk. As a result of the low NBS ratting on these two buildings the school has made the decision for the two buildings to be closed until further notice.

The school has had the following principals:

* 2018–present Sheena Millar
* 2010–2018 Peter Leggat

<doc id="1272009" wikidata="Q1955922" url="?curid=1272009" title="Beilschmiedia tawa">
<text>Beilschmiedia tawa, commonly known as the tawa, is a New Zealand broadleaf tree common in the central parts of the country. Tawa is often the dominant canopy tree species in lowland forests in the North Island and the north east of the South Island, but will also often form the subcanopy in primary forests throughout the country in these areas, beneath podocarps such as kahikatea, matai, miro and rimu. Individual specimens may grow up to 30 metres or more in height with trunks up to 1.2 metres in diameter, and they have smooth dark bark. The Māori word &quot;tawa&quot; is the name for the tree.

Tawa produce small inconspicuous flowers followed by long fruit of a dark red plum colour. With such large fruits, tawa is notable for the fact that it relies solely on the New Zealand pigeon (kererū) and (where present) the North Island kōkako for dispersal of its seed. These are the only remaining birds from New Zealand&#x27;s original biota large enough to eat the fruits of this tree and pass the seeds through their guts and excrete them unharmed. Tawa can also support significant epiphyte gardens in their canopies, which are one of the few habitats known to be frequented by the enigmatic, arboreal striped skink.

This tree gives its name to a northern suburb of Wellington, Tawa.

==Description==

&quot;Beilschmiedia tawa&quot;, or tawa, is a medium sized evergreen tree in the family Lauraceae endemic to New Zealand. It grows to a height of up to tall and has a trunk up to in diameter.

Flowering typically occurs in January, but can occur as early as October or as late as May, producing an inflorescence (flower spike) up to long. Its flowers are in diameter and palish green. Fruiting typically occurs in January, but can come as early as December or as late as March. The fruit is an oval shaped drupe typically measuring 30mm long and 12mm wide, potentially 20–38mm long and 9–18mm wide. The fruit is contains a single seed surrounded by a fleshy pericarp. The pericarp can be glaucous (covered in a pale waxy coating) or shiny and turns dark purple when ripe.

&quot;B. tawa&quot; has slender to moderately robust erecting branches. Its leaves are lanceolate, typically measuring 40–80mm in length (rarely 30–95mm) and 11–16mm wide (rarely 8–40mm). Their color ranges from yellowish to green. They are glabrous (hairless) with a pale glaucous underside. Its petioles are typically 8mm long, ranging from 6 to 12mm in length.

==Distribution==
&quot;B. tawa&quot; is a tree endemic to New Zealand. It is most commonly found in the North Island, and on many of its off-shore islands. In the South Island, the tree is less common with its population being mainly centred in the Marlborough Region, with its southernmost population located in the Kaikōura Ranges, in the northern Canterbury Region.

&quot;B. tawa&quot; is only naturally absent in the highest regions of the Central Volcanic Plateau, the montane forests, and locally unfavourable locations in the lowland woods of the North Island. Additionally, secondary forests caused by fire are unusual for it. The Aupōuri Peninsula&#x27;s sand-dune terrain and the beaches of Kaipara and Manawatū are the only places in the country where there are gaps due to the lack of native forest lowland distribution. Between the Mōkau and Whanganui Rivers and in the hilly terrain of the eastern Bay of Plenty hinterland hold the largest populations of &quot;B. tawa&quot;.

In the South Island, &quot;B. tawa&quot; is largely present in the seawards valleys near of the Marlborough Region, but is it uncommon inland. Its most westerly known occurrence in the South Island is in the Tākaka Valley, north-west of the Nelson Region. The Kaikōura Ranges in the Canterbury region are the southernmost geographical location where &quot;B. tawa&quot; naturally occur.

==Habitat==

Tawa is notable for the fact that it relies solely on the New Zealand pigeon (kererū) and (where present) the North Island kōkako for dispersal of its seed. These are the only remaining birds from New Zealand&#x27;s original biota large enough to eat the fruits of this tree and pass the seeds through their guts and excrete them unharmed. Tawa can also support significant epiphyte gardens in their canopies, which are one of the few habitats known to be frequented by the enigmatic, arboreal striped skink.

Tawa is one of three known native New Zealand species which is host to &quot;Coptomma variegatum&quot;, a beetle species also known by the name tawa longhorn.

==Uses==
The wood of this tree can be used for attractive and resilient floorboarding. Although largely protected in conservation areas and by robust environmental legislation, licences are occasionally granted for the odd fallen tree to be milled for its timber.

The kernel of the tawa berry was used by Māori as food. The berries were steamed in a hāngī (earth oven) for two days, then washed to remove the turpentine-flavoured pulp. The dried kernels were stored. When required, they were soaked in hot water and pounded, sometimes flavouring being added to the mashed meal.

<text>Luigi Roberto Einaudi (born March 1, 1936) is an American career diplomat. He assumed the post of Acting Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) in October 2004 upon the resignation of Secretary General Miguel Ángel Rodríguez.

== Early life and education ==
An Italian American, Einaudi was born to Mario and Manon Einaudi on 1 March 1936 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Educated at Harvard University, he attained a Bachelor of Arts in 1957 and completed his PhD from Harvard in 1967.

== Career ==
He served in the US Army between 1957 and 1959. Following his military service, Einaudi was at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Between 1962 and 1974, he was a researcher at the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica, California, attaining his PhD from Harvard in 1966. From the 1970s onward, Einaudi served as the United States Department of State&#x27; policy-planning chief for Latin America. While at the US State Department, Einaudi met with Vladimiro Montesinos – then a captain in the Peruvian Army – during a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation that brought Montesinos to Washington, D.C., which later resulted with the army captain&#x27;s temporary imprisonment.

Einaudi has taught at Harvard University, Wesleyan University, University of California, Los Angeles and Georgetown University, and lectured at other universities and other societies in the United States, Latin America and Europe. A published author, Einaudi has written articles and monographs. He was the principal author of the book &quot;Beyond Cuba, Latin America Takes Charge of Its Future&quot; (1974).

From 1989 to 1993, Einaudi was the US Ambassador to the Organization of American States. He was elected as Assistant Secretary General in June 2000 by a 27–7 vote of the member states at the 30th regular session of the OAS General Assembly, held in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. He assumed the post of Acting Secretary General of the Organization of American States (OAS) in October 2004 upon the resignation of Secretary General Miguel Ángel Rodríguez.

Today Einaudi is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and is on the board of educational and non-profit institutions in the United States and Italy, particularly the Fondazione Luigi Einaudi (Turin), named for his grandfather, the second postwar President of Italy.

== Personal life ==
Einaudi is married to Carol Ann Peacock, a lawyer specialising in intellectual property. They have four children and ten grandchildren.

<doc id="1272016" wikidata="Q3866195" url="?curid=1272016" title="Bug-eyed monster">
<text>The bug-eyed monster (BEM) is an early convention of the science fiction genre. Extraterrestrials in science fiction of the 1930s were often described (or pictured on covers of pulp magazines) as grotesque creatures with huge, oversized
or compound eyes and a lust for women, blood or general destruction. 

In the contactee/abductee mythology, which grew up quickly beginning in 1952, the blond, blue-eyed, and friendly Nordic aliens of the 1950s were quickly replaced by small, unfriendly bug-eyed creatures, closely matching in many respects the pulp cover clichés of the 1930s which have remained the abductor norm since the 1960s.

==Popular culture==

* The Daleks from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. When the show was created, the BBC producers stated that &quot;Doctor Who&quot; would be a &quot;hard&quot; science fiction show, and there would be no bug-eyed monsters – explicitly stated by show creator Sydney Newman. Writer Terry Nation created the Daleks in the show&#x27;s second serial, much to Newman&#x27;s disapproval.
* In &quot;What Is This Thing Called Love?&quot;, Isaac Asimov&#x27;s parody of both pulp fiction and the bug-eyed monster idea, a woman captured by aliens for the purposes of study keeps using the term when referring to her captor.
* In &quot;The Gap Cycle&quot; of books by Stephen R. Donaldson, the alien creatures are referred to by the main characters as BEMs.

<doc id="1272024" wikidata="Q436492" url="?curid=1272024" title="Altec Lansing">
<text>Altec Lansing, Inc. is an American audio electronics company founded in 1927. 
Their primary products are loudspeakers and associated audio electronics for professional, home, automotive and multimedia applications.

Engineers at Western Electric, who later formed Altec Services Company, developed the technology for motion picture sound that was introduced in 1927, with the release of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.

Originally, Altec Services Company serviced the theater sound systems the company founders had helped develop. In 1941, the Altec Services Company purchased the nearly bankrupt Lansing Manufacturing Company and melded the two names, forming the Altec Lansing Corporation, and with the manufacturing capabilities of the former Lansing Manufacturing Company, they quickly expanded into manufacturing horn loudspeakers.

In 1958 the Altec Lansing Corporation was purchased by James Ling who made it part of LTV Ling Altec. LTV spun off Altec which it loaded down with debt first. By 1974, the company was saddled with debt. It was reorganized under Chapter 11 as Altec Corporation and continued for 10 years. Altec filed a second bankruptcy. In 1984, Gulton Industries purchased the brand out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Gulton was acquired by Mark IV Audio. Since then, there has been a string of owners, purchased in 1986 by Sparkomatic, with the Pro equipment still made by Mark IV Audio, Mark IV sold out to Telex, who closed down the Pro division and folded its products into Electro-Voice. In 2005 Altec Lansing Technologies was acquired by Plantronics, 2009 bought by Prophet Equity, and has been owned since 2012 by the Infinity Group, a company which acquires struggling companies.

Popular loudspeakers included the Altec Lansing Duplex 600-series coaxial loudspeaker, studio monitors from the 1940s to the 1980s, and the Altec &quot;Voice of the Theatre&quot; line of loudspeakers widely used in movie theaters, concert halls, and also in rock concerts from the 1960s to the 1990s, such as custom designs used at Woodstock Festival.

==History==

===Conception and early products===
In 1930 AT&amp;T&#x27;s Western Electric established a division to install and service loudspeakers and electronic products for motion-picture use. Named Electrical Research Products, Inc. and commonly referred to by the acronym ERPI, it became the target of an anti-trust suit brought by Stanley K. Oldden. By 1936, Western Electric had shed its audio-equipment manufacturing and sales division, bought by International Projector and Motiograph, and was looking to dissolve the associated service division. ERPI was purchased as part of a consent decree in 1937 by a group of ERPI executives, including George Carrington Sr., Leon Whitney &quot;Mike&quot; Conrow, Bert Sanford Jr., and Alvis A. Ward, with funding from three Wall Street investors. They reincorporated as &quot;Altec Service Company&quot;, the &quot;Altec&quot; standing for &quot;all technical&quot;. Company executives promised they would never make or sell audio equipment.

The Altec Services Company purchased the bankrupt Lansing Manufacturing Company and melded the two names, forming the Altec Lansing Corporation on May 1, 1941. The first Altec Lansing power amplifier, Model 142B, was produced that same year. James Bullough Lansing worked for Altec Lansing, then in 1946 he left to found the James B. Lansing Company (JBL), another manufacturer of high-quality professional loudspeakers, which competed with Altec Lansing. Altec Lansing produced a line of professional and high-fidelity audio equipment, starting with a line of horn-based loudspeaker systems. First developed for use in motion-picture theaters, these products were touted for their fidelity, efficiency and high sound-level capability. Products included &quot;biflex&quot; speakers (where frequency range was increased by a flexible &quot;decoupling&quot; of a small center area of the speaker&#x27;s cone from a larger &quot;woofer&quot; area) and the 604-series of coaxial speakers (which employed a high-efficiency compression driver mounted to the rear of the 604&#x27;s low-frequency magnet, and exited through a multicellular horn that passed through center of the woofer&#x27;s cone).

Altec Lansing also made the Voice of the Theatre systems. The design resulted from a collaboration between John Hilliard and Jim Lansing. Douglas Shearer didn&#x27;t hesitate to approve the Hilliard&#x27;s proposal and authorized &quot;any reasonable budget&quot;. Hilliard became the team leader of this new project. Hilliard immediately recruited Lansing Manufacturing, Robert Stephens, a design draftsman on MGM&#x27;s staff, and Harry Kimball. The speaker was named the Shearer horn. Later on, a more refined model, the VOTT, was introduced. The smallest model, the A-7, used a large-sized sectoral metal horn for high frequencies, which featured dividers (sectors) to provide control sound dispersion, plus a medium-sized wooden low-frequency enclosure, which functioned as a hybrid bass-horn/bass-reflex enclosure.

The most often used Voice of the Theatre system was the A-4, many of which are still in use in motion picture theaters measuring 9 feet tall . . The efficiency of all of these products originally provided high sound pressure levels from the limited amplifier power available at the time. The original Voice of the Theatre series included the A-1, A-2, A-4, and the A-5. The A-7 and A-8 were designed for smaller venues. In 2004, the A-7 Voice of the Theatre system was inducted into the TECnology Hall of Fame, an honor given to &quot;products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology.&quot;

Bill Hanley used Altec high frequency drivers and horns along with JBL bass drivers in his custom-built loudspeaker system for the Woodstock Festival in 1969.
Some professional Altec Lansing products remained in use well into the 1990s.

===Altec Service Co. and Altec Lansing Professional audio products===
James Ling purchased the Altec Lansing Corporation from the ailing George Carrington Sr., in 1958. By the time James Ling spun Altec Lansing off in 1974, his company, LTV-Ling-Altec, had heavy debts. In 1984, Gulton Industries, Inc., purchased the Altec Sound Products Division from the Altec Lansing Corporation, which was operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Included with the purchase were the tooling, parts and product inventories, distributor network, designs, patents, and assets of the Sound Products Division of Altec Lansing. The motion picture theater sound installation and repair business, Altec Service Co., was sold to J. Bruce Waddell, then head of Altec Service, and comptroller Robert V. Gandolfi. They established it as A.S.C. Technical Services in Richardson, Texas.

The Altec Lansing Corporation was formed by Gulton Industries as part of the purchase and headquartered in Oklahoma City, the site of the University Sound factory built by Jimmy Ling when he moved there from White Plains, New York. Prior to the purchase, Altec Lansing had been headquartered in Yorba Linda, California, but it was moved as part of an effort to reduce operating costs.

Altec Lansing Corporation produced professional audio products until 1995, when Telex Communications, who had purchased Altec Lansing&#x27;s parent company, EVI Audio, Inc., in 1997, consolidated all of their electronics manufacturing facilities into one location in Minnesota.

===Post-1996===
In 1996, Altec Lansing Technologies Multimedia established an R&amp;D center in Kfar Saba, Israel. The center, known as ALST Technical Excellence Center, cooperate with STMicroelectronics (ALST = Altec Lansing + STMicro) and focused on advanced multimedia technologies such as USB audio, surround sound and wireless audio as well as on handheld video. The center was closed in 2001 and the development activities moved to the Milford headquarters. In May 2000, Altec Lansing&#x27;s Professional division was closed by Telex and the Altec Lansing was later sold to Sparkomatic and renamed Altec Lansing Technologies. The Altec Lansing Professional line was relaunched in April 2002 by Altec Lansing Technologies using a few former executives and sound engineers of the old Oklahoma City-based Altec Lansing Corporation, bringing Altec&#x27;s professional and consumer products under the same roof for the first time since 1986. The company later dropped the professional audio products and Altec Lansing Professional&#x27;s Oklahoma City offices were closed in late 2006 and all remaining activities relocated to the headquarters in Milford, Pennsylvania.


On 30 April 2001 Altec Lansing Technologies launched their first line of headphones named as the AHP series. This series of headphones had various different designs and price ranges. In February 2004, Altec Lansing Technologies reissued a number of loudspeakers starting with the A7 Voice of the Theatre, manufactured in the US with some changes to the enclosure. Similarly, Altec Lansing Technologies reissued the 510, 508 and 305 loudspeakers. Very few were actually made. On July 11, 2005, Altec Lansing Technologies announced that it was to be acquired by Plantronics for approximately $166 million. On September 10, 2008, Altec Lansing Technologies went through a corporate makeover changing its name to Altec Lansing LLC and its logo from a &quot;whirlpool&quot; to an abstraction of a multi-cellular horn.

On 1 October 2009 Altec Lansing LLC announced that it was to be acquired by Prophet Equity for approximately 18 million dollars. In July 2011, Altec Lansing LLC announced the opening of new West Coast headquarters in San Diego, California. Brendon Stead joined as Vice President of Product Management and Engineering. Stead was formerly the General Manager and Vice President of Harman International and Labtec. On October 18, 2012, The Infinity Group bought Altec Lansing for $17.5 million at auction thus saving the company from bankruptcy. Infinity specializes in acquiring and turning around struggling or bankrupt consumer brands.

<text>Victoria, officially the Municipality of Victoria (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 43,408 people.

Duck Raising Capital of the Philippines, or Victoria, is a municipality offering some of the most bizarre yet delicious dishes including goats’ and ducks’ meat. Following the town&#x27;s nickname, the Itik Festival is celebrated, along with the town&#x27;s founding anniversary, to give honor and to know more about the products that come from itik (duck). Through &quot;Presidential Proclamation 663&quot;, October 14, 2024 was declared a special non-working day in celebration of its 75th Founding Anniversary and the 23rd Itik Festival.

==Etymology==
The name of Victoria means &quot;victory&quot; in Spanish. It got its name from Victoria Quirino, the daughter of former President Elpidio Quirino under whose presidency the municipality was established. The younger Quirino also served as the First Lady as her father was a widower.

==History==
Prominent citizens and civic leaders found new hope to make Nanhaya, then a barrio part of Pila, a town, when the Americans granted the Philippines Independence in 1946. They revived the move to separate from Pila. During this time, citizens proposed to name the town Trinidad, after the young republic&#x27;s First Lady, the wife of then-President Manuel Roxas. Strong oppositions shelved the proposal once more.

After Roxas&#x27;s death, Elpidio Quirino took over the presidency. Nanhaya&#x27;s residents remained undaunted. They tried once more, intensifying the campaign. Most prominent and wealthiest family of the town is the Fernandez clans, Judge Jose Fernandez, then Mayor Alejandro Fernandez, Atty. Ramon H. Fernandez Sr., Andres Franco, Dr. Agrifino Oca, Gregorio Herradura, and Leonardo Rebong stood for the proposal. On November 15, 1949, President Elpidio Quirino signed into effect Executive Order No. 282, segregating barrios Nanhaya, Bancabanca, Daniw, Masapang, San Benito, San Felix, San Francisco, and San Roque from Pila and formed a new independent municipality.

After Pateros became highly urbanized and densely populated, Victoria became a destination of balut traders and became the &quot;Duck Raising Center of the Philippines&quot;. The town was featured as the detour challenge of Leg 11 of the 5th Season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;. Victoria celebrates the &quot;Itik Festival&quot; every second week of November.

The municipal seat of Pila was once located in Barangay Pagalangan, now one of Victoria&#x27;s barangays. The remains of Pila&#x27;s original parish church can still be found in Pagalangan, which in the past made that community a target of treasure hunters seeking antiques. Pagalangan ceased to be Pila&#x27;s capital when the town center was relocated due to frequent flooding.

==Geography==
Victoria is southeast of Laguna de Bay, south of Manila and from Santa Cruz. It is bordered by the Municipality of Calauan to the south-west, Nagcarlan to the southeast and Pila to the north-east.

===Barangays===
Victoria is politically subdivided into 9 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

Currently, there are two barangays which are classified as urban.

<doc id="1272029" wikidata="Q4704621" url="?curid=1272029" title="Al Purdy">
<text>Alfred Wellington Purdy (December 30, 1918 – April 21, 2000) was a 20th-century Canadian free verse poet. Purdy&#x27;s writing career spanned fifty-six years. His works include thirty-nine books of poetry; a novel; two volumes of memoirs and four books of correspondence, in addition to his posthumous works. He has been called English Canada&#x27;s &quot;unofficial poet laureate&quot; and &quot;a national poet in a way that you only find occasionally in the life of a culture.&quot;

==Biography==

Born in Wooler, Ontario, Purdy went to Albert College in Belleville, Ontario, and Trenton Collegiate Institute in Trenton, Ontario. He dropped out of school at 17 and rode the rails west to Vancouver. He served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. Following the war, he worked in various jobs until the 1960s, when he was finally able to support himself as a writer, editor and poet.

In 1957, Purdy and his wife Eurithe moved to Roblin Lake in Ameliasburgh, Ontario (southeast of Trenton, in Prince Edward County), where they built an A-frame cottage, and this became his preferred location for writing. In his later years, he divided his time between North Saanich, British Columbia, and his cottage at Roblin Lake.

In addition to his poems and novel, Purdy&#x27;s work includes two volumes of memoirs, the most recent of which was &quot;Reaching for the Beaufort Sea&quot;. He also wrote four books of correspondence, including &quot;Margaret Laurence - Al Purdy: A Friendship in Letters&quot; and radio and television plays for the CBC. He was writer-in-residence at several Canadian universities; contributed to Acta Victoriana, literary journal of Victoria College; and edited a number of anthologies of poetry.

He wrote the introduction to the last book of poetry by his friend Milton Acorn, &quot;The Whiskey Jack&quot;. Purdy was also a long-time friend of American author Charles Bukowski. Bukowski once said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know of any good living poets. But there&#x27;s this tough son of a bitch up in Canada that walks the line.&quot;

However, acclaim is not universal. Noted Canadian formalist poet James Pollock, when asked to &quot;Name one poet, living or dead, it seems everyone loves but you,&quot; answered: &quot;In Canada, Al Purdy. The emperor has no clothes.&quot;

Al Purdy died in North Saanich. His final collection of poetry, &quot;Beyond Remembering: The Collected Poems of Al Purdy&quot;, was released posthumously in the fall of 2000.

==Memorial==
A grass-roots movement to preserve Purdy&#x27;s A-frame cottage in Ameliasburgh has been organized by Jean Baird (wife of poet George Bowering) and Purdy&#x27;s publisher Howard White of Harbour Publishing, who together founded the A-Frame Trust with the intent of raising $1 million to preserve the house as a memorial to Purdy and a writing retreat for other writers. The campaign is profiled in Brian D. Johnson&#x27;s 2015 documentary film &quot;Al Purdy Was Here&quot;.

In 2016 it was revealed in Toronto Life that John Hofsess contributed to the assisted suicide of Purdy when the poet was dying of cancer.

==Awards and recognition==
Honours and awards Purdy received include the Order of Canada (O.C.) in 1982, the Order of Ontario in 1987, and the Governor General&#x27;s Award, in 1965 for his collection &quot;The Cariboo Horses&quot;, and again in 1986 for &quot;The Collected Poems of Al Purdy&quot;. The League of Canadian Poets gave Purdy the Voice of the Land Award, a special award created by the League to honour his unique contribution to Canada.

Purdy&#x27;s collection of poems, &quot;Rooms for Rent in the Outer Planets: Selected Poems, 1962–1996&quot;, was chosen for inclusion in &quot;Canada Reads 2006&quot;, where it was championed by poet Susan Musgrave. On May 20, 2008, a large bronze statue of Purdy was unveiled in Queen&#x27;s Park in downtown Toronto.

<doc id="1272033" wikidata="Q1048984" url="?curid=1272033" title="International Wrestling Association (Puerto Rico)">
<text>The International Wrestling Association is a conglomerate of professional wrestling promotions that originated in Puerto Rico and currently operates there. Founded in 1994 by wrestler promoter Víctor Quiñones and wrestler Miguel Perez Jr. it quickly entered an agreement to serve as a development territory for the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE) that lasted until 2001. During its first decade, IWA grew to rival the long-standing World Wrestling Council (WWC). Its business model relies on pushing younger talents, using veterans and foreign wrestlers to get them over with the public.

Besides a number of alliances with foreign promotions that included Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, International Wrestling Association of Japan (which Quiñones also co-founded in 1994), IWA Mid-South, and Ring of Honor (ROH), the company was also a member of the National Wrestling Alliance between 2007 and 2008. The original incarnation ceased operations in 2012. On October 24, 2018, the reopening of IWA-PR was also announced.

==History==
===IWA-WWF (1999–2000)===
The International Wrestling Association had a working agreement with the World Wrestling Federation in the first year of operations from 1999 to 2000. During that time some developmental and regular WWF talent often appeared on IWA Puerto Rico shows. That included The Rock&#x27;s first and only wrestling match in Puerto Rico on April 28, 2000, at Paquito Montaner Stadium in Ponce, Puerto Rico when he teamed with Kane against the Dudley Boyz. During that year IWA began promoting two of their most popular annual events, IWA Christmas in PR and Histeria Boricua. On the second night IWA Christmas in PR Histeria Boricua on January 6, 1999 at &quot;Juan Pachin Vicens Auditorium&quot; on Ponce, Puerto Rico with Kane vs. The Undertaker on the main event drew 15.000 fans, the largest crowd for a wrestling event in Ponce.

===IWA-PR vs. WWC===
IWA adopted a strict protocol of expelling problematic fans, such as those that threw objects to the ring.
On April 1, 2001, the IWA parodied Jovica&#x27;s accent and referred to WWC as an independent company with mediocre performers in a segment of El Tocotón. In June 2001, the IWA held a joint show along independent promotion Puerto Rico Wrestling Association. On July 28, 2001, it was published that the promotion had extended the contract of their top stars Ricky Banderas and Apolo for five years plus another additional year of no competing in case of abandoning the promotion. In August 2001, the IWA made efforts to exploit The Invasion angle being featured in WWF by bringing members of the regular roster and The Alliance such as Mike Awesome, Billy Gunn, Justin Credible, Tajiri, Tommy Dreamer, Hugh Morris, Steve Blackman, Hakú, Scotty 2 Hotty or Shawn Stasiak. This was combined with a move to bring Balls Mahoney, another ex-ECW figure to the company. On October 10, 2002, an extension of the contract between IWA and Telemundo was made public. On October 13, 2002, both promotions announced a card to be held on the same date and venue for October 18. Ultimately, IWA presented its event, while WWC did not hold one on that day. 
In 2003, Savio Vega tried to bring Randy Savage to IWA-PR.
In May 2003, the Wrestling Observer reported that Dutch Mantel, the IWA&#x27;s creative head, had applied for work at WWE and been declined. He responded by expressing that Meltzer was “100% wrong” and that he only had informal conversations with the promotion in the past. In May 2003, Rivera and Eddie Colón encountered each other in a restaurant, entering into an argument about the practices and product of their respective promotions. The IWA turned this into an angle, where they belittled Colón as a “fan” of Armando Gorbea. On May 29, 2003, a copy of a letter that WWC sent to Telemundo in response for its use of the name “TNT” was made public. In June 2003, the IWA began an onscreen storyline where Víctor Quiñones would sell the company to an unnamed buyer in order to expand and begin an internationalization of the brand. This was a tie in to a legitimate expansion, in which the promotion reached an agreement with Sunshine TV, a network based in Florida, to begin the transmission of an English version of their programming. The taped show was named IWA: Total Impact, and was narrated by Dutch Mantell and Mario Savoldi. The program was produced by the latter&#x27;s filming studios. Prior to Summer Attitude 2003, the promotion contacted several small businesses to sell the tickets from the event, avoiding its regular distributor, Ticket Center. After contracting José Huertas González, the IWA used him to promote their Summer Attitude card in Telemundo&#x27;s programming, including a variety show named Atrevete.

===Broadcasting abroad===
IWA: Total Impact debuted the first week of July, being broadcast by Sunshine Network in Florida and Latin TV in New York. During its initial run, the program was complimented by classic footage from the USWA. The promotion was expected to employ this to create a fan base in the United States, eventually hosting cards in these states. In this show, Rivera was referred to as “The Boss” instead of “Savio Vega” due to copyright claims by WWE. 
The show was quickly retransmitted in other stations throughout the United States, including WCYB - TV (Bristol, Virginia), KTUD-TV (Las Vegas, Nevada), AIN Cresson (Texas), WBGN-TV (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), XCVS-TV (Shreveport, Louisiana), KBBR-TV (Baton Rouge, Louisiana), KBCB-TV (Bellingham, Washington), WRCX-TV (Dayton, Ohio), WVII-TV (Bangor, Maine), WPXT-TV (Portland, Maine), KLDT-TV (Lewisville, Texas), WBQP-TV (Pensacola, Florida), WBII-TV (Ashland, Mississippi), WBGT-TV (Rochester, New York), WYCS-TV (Louisville, Kentucky), WYLE-TV (Sheffield, Alabama), WCOM-TV (Griffin, Georgia), WLOT-TV (New York) and 
Comcast (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). At its peak, this internationalization effort grew to include more that 100 channels.
On August 27, 2003, it was reported that a series of conversations between the promotion and TNA-NWA were in an advanced stage. The idea was to bring talent from the IWA to perform in the latter&#x27;s X Division as a promotional stunt to attract Latin American audiences. In September, the promotion created a second show directed to the United States public titled Zona Impactante. Produced by Hector Moyano and Axel Cruz, the show was televised through Telemundo 40 in Orlando and América Azteca in Kissimmee. Several other stations were reportedly interested in the promotion&#x27;s product. In September, the promotion lost Mantell as booker when he signed with TNA-NWA, despite the loss, both parts parted on good terms. Soon afterwards, these programs were retransmitted locally.

===Apolo lawsuit===
The promotion held its first show abroad for October 7, 2003, in the Kissimmee Civic Center in the city of Kissimmee, Florida. During this event, Kein Kelly joined the promotion. After participating in this card, Figueroa decided to stay in that state, being removed from the promotion&#x27;s storylines. Weeks later, Figueroa made an appearance in a local promotion, No Name Wrestling (NNW) being also scheduled for a subsequent appearance the following month. Figueroa then revealed that he had left the promotion unsatisfied with a situation involving the health of one of his daughters and expected to relocate to Florida permanently. The promotion retaliated by sending a letter to NNW, TNA and WWE, informing them of the wrestler&#x27;s ongoing contract and that the ring name “Apolo” was registered.

2004 opened with German Figueroa returning to NWA-TNA as part of a talent exchange, but there soon was a setback in the promotion&#x27;s agreement, which was precipitated by an exclusivity clause that prevented NWA-TNA talent from appearing in an IWA cable PPV. Nonetheless, IWA continued its plans to do the PPV with its own talent and distribute it through both cable and Dish Network. The event&#x27;s name was changed to “Total Impact” after being taped and prior to its distribution began on March 5, 2004. The event was sold for $19.95 and was rerun on March 6 and 11. During this month, Mantell approached the promotion and offered his services as a consultant, but the approach was declined. Shortly afterwards, Mantell signed with WWC and the promotion&#x27;s working agreement with NWA-TNA was cancelled, reportedly because of disagreements regarding IWA&#x27;s incursion in the PPV market. The rivalry between promotions also resulted in occasional confrontations to ensure the availabilityof a venue. On the other hand, the promotion also held friendly relations, and even some degree of working relationships, with local independent promotions such as CWF. The promotion also benefited from its previous ties with WWE, who allowed Val Venis to make a campaign for it due to not possessing any plans for him at the moment. However, it lost its narrator and producer, Hector Meléndez, to NWA-TNA, when Mantell recruited him for the same purpose.
Following the death of close collaborator Miguel Aponte, the promotion held a series of special events in his honor. The IWA responded by contacting NWA-TNA and prohibiting the use of contracted wrestler Apolo, while they had a working relationship with WWC.

===Collaborations===
On May 15, 2004, it was announced that “El Café del Milenio”, a television segment that originally aired in WWC&#x27;s Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, was being brought to IWA&#x27;s programming. The promotion also held a benefic wheelchair basketball game.
On June 20, 2004, one of the promotion&#x27;s talents, Víctor Rodríguez, died of a heart attack. The promotion then changed all of its schedule to hold a number of homages to the wrestler. From this point onwards, the momentum gained during the year was lost and the assistance was irregular. During the 2004 Summer Olympics, the promotion was forced to change the horary of its programs to accommodate Telemundo&#x27;s coverage of the event.
During the summer of 2004, IWA collaborated with Ring of Honor (ROH) in a talent exchange, where several of the latter&#x27;s wrestlers came in representation. On September 11, 2004, two of the promotion&#x27;s talents, Carlos Cotto and Slash Venom, competed in a ROH card. The passing of tropical storm Jeanne over Puerto Rico affected the organization of cards during this month. 
Besides its ongoing relationship with ROH and the rekindled agreement with NWA-TNA, the IWA also tried to bring professional boxers into the promotion as special referees, unsuccessfully approaching Félix Trinidad and Miguel Cotto (who is the cousin of Carlos Cotto). During this timeframe, the IWA prevented the participation of some of its talents in a card held by independent promotion NWG, deviating from its previous cooperation with independents.
For Histeria Boricua 2005, the promotion contacted several international talents, including Abdullah the Butcher and Nidia. After Figueroa wrestled with independent promotion CWF, the IWA threatened the company with legal action. During the offseason, the promotion modified the horary of their shows to accommodate special programming in the channel. Leading to Histeria Boricua 2005, the IWA aired special programming to promote the event. The promotion also repackaged the content of their PPV as a DVD. The IWA also readjusted the days in which secondary wrestlers were used. In February 2005, the promotion held a massive tryout. On March 24, 2005, the IWA rekindled its relationship with WWE, reaching an agreement that would see some developmental talent arrive to the promotion without it being considered a territory itself. Along their previous working relationships with NWA-TNA and ROH, this meant that the promotion had reached accords with all three major North American promotions. Locally IWA and NWS joined forces for the Juicio Final 2005 card. Entering the summer, the IWA began coordinating a show in collaboration with International Gladiators of Wrestling, to be held at the Coliseum of Puerto Rico. As part of its alliance with WWE, Eugene was brought for the Víctor Rodríguez Memorial Cup. In July 2005, it was announced that Shane Sewell would jump from the IWA to NWS. The acquisition of an active maineventer lead to the cancellation of the collaboration between both promotions. The IWA responded by filing a legal complaint over the ownership of a ring, but the case was dismissed. In August 2005, it was reported that WWE had further plans for both IWA and WWC. In August, reports noted that the promotion was having issues running shows in its habitual venue, the José Cestero Court. However, this issue was solved within weeks. During this month, the promotion also faced other difficulties including a lawsuit filed against them by the family of Víctor Rodríguez and losing their narrator, Willie Urbina. On March 18, 2006, independent promotion PWA accused the IWA and NWS of sabotaging one of its cards, with both promotions reflecting the blame.

===Death of Víctor Quiñones===
On April 2, 2006, the IWA lost its founder and owner, when Víctor Quiñones suddenly died of a heart attack at the age of 46. The event lead to a series of cross-promotional homages by wrestlers and corporations that knew him, including some that were actively competing with IWA-PR at the moment such as WWC&#x27;s Rico Suave and several of NWS’ employees. Advertisers and promoters also joined on the condolences. On their part, several wrestlers that began their career at IWA-PR reacted expressing both grief and gratitude. Former employees such as announcer Hugo Savinovich, referee Eliezer Rosado and managers Jorge Casanova and Joe Don Smith reacted the same. Foreign wrestlers such as Fidel Sierra, the Youngbloods, Tahitian Warrior, Angel Mexicano, Bret Sanders and Andy Anderson also made public statements. On April 8, 2006, the IWA held its own homage to Quiñones.

In June 2006, Figueroa appeared in a NWS show despite remaining under contract. The IWA responded with a number of legal actions involving the use of the wrestler and his character. On July 9, 2006, it was reported that the IWA administration and the WWC administration had discussed the possibility of cooperating with each other, even discussing a potential interpromotional angle.
During the first week of August, IWA and NWS offshoot World Wrestling Stars (WWS) announced an alliance where both promotions would share cards and cooperate on the television product. Later in the month, the promotion recovered Sewell from NWS and González made his return after a hiatus. After acquiring Joan Guzmán from WWC, the IWA debuted a new section named La Chercha, which aired along IWA classics. In November, the promotion collaborated with independent NWG in a community activity. In December 2006, it was announced that the promotion&#x27;s programming would air in the western coast of Puerto Rico through WOLE-TV. Parallel to this, Zona Caliente moved to the 3:00 p.m. - 5:00 p.m. slot in Telemundo. During this time, the promotion also emphasized a lack of support from the public during its storylines, making reference to a real decline in assistance. Outside of wrestling, the promotion was involved in visits to hospital where children suffering cancer were treated. 
In January 2007, the IWA debuted a new television segment hosted by Los Rabiosos. During this month, one of the IWA&#x27;s talents, John Moxley, performed for WWE Heat. On February 7, 2007, the IWA announced that in March they would be hosting their first cards at Ecuador, also announcing an alliance with local promotion WAR. In March 2007, WWC and Mario Savoldi broke their working relationship, with the IWA capitalizing by bringing in the agent and Billy Kidman and Psychosis, both of which were announced to perform in their rival&#x27;s cards.
On April 7, 2007, Zona Caliente returned to its original 1:00 p.m. slot. On June 2, 2007, independent promotion Puerto Rico Wrestling Alliance (PRWA) accused the IWA of preventing one of its talents from performing there. On June 5, 2007, Miguel Pérez was sued in his role as IWA promoter by DRD, who cited faults to articles IX and XVI of a regulation that had just been approved by the agency. On June 9, 2007, the IWA introduced a new intro for its shows. One of the promotion&#x27;s wrestlers, Joan Guzmán, became WWS Heavyweight Champion. On June 14, 2007, the IWA joined NWG, WWR and WWS in a card named Junte para la Historia in memorial of deceased wrestler Omar Pérez Barreto. In July, the IWA held an angle where one of its wrestlers would win a WWE contract due to the impending departure of Colossus to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW).

===La Rabia, heist of the Universal Championship===
The final week of the month, the promotion aired a special programming titled Mega Momentos de la IWA. However, the same day WWC contacted several wrestlers with ties to Hector Meléndez and filmed a segment with them concealing their identities. During this time, the NWA also began considering hosting the finals of a tournament to crown the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion in an IWA card, being a finalist along New York and Los Angeles. Faced with losing their talent, IWA reinforced its roster with foreign wrestlers such as Vampiro, Ricky Vega and Vito. Of the performers that left, Cotto returned weeks later. 
IWA was ultimately selected to host the NWA final, with Bryan Danielson and Adam Pierce being the contenders. However, after the former underwent eye surgery he was replaced by Brent Albright. Afterwards, it was announced that Danielson would be the guest enforcer. In the event titled NWA Weekend held on September 1, 2007, Pierce became the new NWA World Heavyweight Champion. During this timeframe, the promotion made several adjustments such as holding cards every two weeks and firing several talents, including the entire Women&#x27;s Division, which had been irregularly used for months. In October, the IWA continued downsizing, firing Venom due to unspecified differences. On November 22, 2007, the IWA collaborated with NWG in organizing Thanksgiving Riot. In December 2007, Williams suddenly left his office as IWA booker. On January 11, 2008, IWA announced that Zona Caliente would be airing on Video Max.

On January 5, 2008, WWC announced that Rubysnky had opted to sign with IWA following failed negotiations, in the process revealing both the character that he would take as well as the storyline. All of his teammates at los Templarios left for IWA as well. 
None of La Rabia members made their scheduled appearances for the first date of the Euphoria tour. Following the absences, it was reported that there had been conversations between the group and IWA during the offseason. On January 6, 2008, Big made a surprise appearance at Histeria Boricua while carrying WWC&#x27;s Universal heavyweight Championship belt and challenged the IWA World Heavyweight Champion, his former partner Lozada, to an unification match. After he made his initial appearance, WWC&#x27;s merchandising executive José Roberto Rodríguez entered the building and demanded that the belt was returned, but IWA personnel had taken the belt elsewhere and Salovi confronted him. For the unification, Big carried the Revolution X-Treme wrestling belt that belonged to Rivera and lost the match to Lozada.
In an interview with mainstream newspaper Primera Hora, Colón Sr. denied that Big was still champion and warned that they would pursue a case for illegal appropriation if the belt was not immediately returned. The promoter also claimed that Meléndez and La Rabia were aware that they would be fired and decided to do a preemptive strike. For its following program, IWA announced that they would air footage of the event, which was done in an edited fashion. In an NWA Report, the IWA announced that they would retire the old belt and introduce a new one to represent the Undisputed Championship. WWC responded by airing a segment where it boasted putting down La Rabia (which is translated as “The Rabies”) and aired a segment where the commission and insisted that Big was not champion at Histeria Boricua. 
The same month, IWA announced the acquisition of Cassandra and The Bad Boys from Hell&#x27;s Kitchen. In February, IWA continued with its roster moves, firing Joan Guzmán and bringing in The Amazing Kong and Jeffreys. However. Weeks later Guzmán was contracted again and La Chercha was included in the programming.

===Lawsuit against Mario Savoldi===
On March 22, 2008, reports noted that Mario Savoldi had unilaterally moved the IWA headquarters without informing Pérez or Rivera, who learned of the move when they arrived at their former offices and found them vacant. This division left Telemundo without new programming, with old shows being aired in the meanwhile. Pérez and Rivera retained control of the webpage, the production truck and the ring and the following day they published their account of the events, which they called “a coup against IWA“, claiming that production materials and the film library were moved to a warehouse in the process and that they would take legal action. During this time period, there were doubts that about which part would retain the IWA&#x27;s name. Despite this, Pérez and Rivera began considering the option of forming a new group and contacted several members of the roster towards this goal. A schism happened within the talents, with Huertas, Los Aéreos, The Naturals, Shane Sewell, Ricky Vega and Toledo siding with Savoldi, most remaining with Pérez and Rivera, and a neutral group led by Ray González and Bison also emerging. Savoldi also made attempts to stop the holding of further cards for the moment. 
Pérez and Rivera then announced that they would shoot on the situation during the next card. Despite facing serious economic difficulties due to the situation, Pérez and Rivera retained the Telemundo spot and resumed their programming. Meanwhile, Savoldi considered running under the name of International Wrestling Entertainment. On March 29, 2008, the IWA held a card where the conflict was turned into an angle and Rivera was apparently arrested by corrupt cops. On April 6, 2008, IWA announced that the IWA World Heavyweight and Extreme Cruiserweight titles were vacated due to the allegiances of the wrestlers. The following day, Rivera and Pérez won their lawsuit against Savoldi, who was ordered to return the equipment. While new material could be edited, the IWA aired old shows with a current promo. On May 10, 2008, the IWA announced the acquisition of Ricky Vega from Savoldi&#x27;s group, which had stagnated. In May 2008, the IWA held negotiations with Ramón Álvarez. In June, the IWA announced an acquisition by reviving the “hooded” gimmick, later revealing Joe Bravo.

===Cobra promotions===
During this timeframe, promoter Edwin Vázquez Ortega had presence in television and was involved in a number of angles. Referred on screen by the title of “El Promotor”, he was given a role as an authority figure, with power to order matches. Vázquez was given other roles, such as facilitating storylines by getting attacked by Lozada, who disagreed with his actions as promoter. In general, his skits sided him with the heroic, or “face”, characters. For the following months, matches that were “ordered by the promotor” we’re ubiquitous in IWA-PR&#x27;s cards. He was involved in storylines with Los Dueños de la Malicia and Joe Bravo. Vázquez was involved in the angle for the IWA Undisputed World Heavyweight Championship, stripping Bravo and declaring it vacant. His role in storylines involving Los Dueños de la Malicia, Gilbert and others continued being pervasive in IWA-PR&#x27;s programming and events.

In July, IWA announced that Savio Vega had been contacted by TNA to work as an agent. On July 31, 2008, IWA announced that Zona Caliente would return in August and be available to the clients of local cable companies.

In August, both WWC and IWA lost talent to a re-branded Extreme Wrestling Organization (EWO), in the case of this promotion it lost both of their announcers, some referees and wrestlers.
On August 23, 2008, IWA announced that Impacto Total was returning to its former slot on Telemundo. On September 4, 2009, several IWA talents joined independent performers in a charity card.
In October, the promotion cancelled a card citing weather reasons due to the passing of Omar through the region. It also released announcer and commenter Héctor “Voz de Trueno” Meléndez.
The new set of rules was enforced in titular matches. In November, IWA announced that they had lost communication with Noriega after reaching an agreement and that he no-showed an event, that part of its talent would wrestle abroad and the integration of Figueroa. 
For Christmas in PR, Vázquez Ortega made a special offer for tickets preordered at his own business, Cobra Music Center.

For Histeria Boricua 2009, IWA announced that it was making a significant investment in set, which also included bringing TNA talents including the incumbent Legends Champion Booker T and LAX. Greet and meet events were held. At Histeria Boricua, the promotion announced the arrival of Samoa Joe. It also made arrangements to bring back Chet Jablonski. In February, IWA announced the return of Banderas and Sewell.

The promotion was then active in a talent exchange with DWE of the Dominican Republic, but also a localcard. The working agreement between RXW and IWA lead to Panamanian talents appearing in Puerto Rico in March. After IWA announced the return of Sewell to its roster, WWC made arrangements so that he would join them instead.
In April, the issues with the television show continued, forcing the IWA to cancel a card. On April 4, 2009, IWA debuted a segment called Malicia TV hosted by Dennis Rivera and Noel Rodríguez. Luke Williams was also featured in the product.
During this time, the IWA held an agreement with independent promotion NWG, allowing some of its talents to wrestle there. In May the promotion rearranged the alignments of the wrestlers to compensate for dates outside Puerto Rico and unclear long-term contractual situations. In June the promotion was forced to cancel a card.
In June, Vázquez Ortega officially became the IWA&#x27;s promoter.

===Tenth anniversary===
For its anniversary event, IWA brought talent from the TNA Knockouts division.
In the lead up to the tenth anniversary event, the IWA booked OBD to a future date despite her scheduled appearance at WWC&#x27;s Aniversario 2009, airing a promo segment. For the event, the promotion resigned Bryan and Castillo.
For its own Tenth Anniversary event, the IWA brought back Banderas and involved him in an angle with Dennis Rivera. A press conference was held prior to the event, which featured meet and greet events with the Beautiful People, Banderas, Bryan and Cotto, among others.
On August 7, 2009, the IWA announced the return of Dutch Mantell, who resumed creative functions. The promotion became involved in a number of non-profit events, helping charities and high school classes. Towards this end, they collaborated with other promotions such as Manny&#x27;s Wrestling authority by loaning their talents. On October 10, 2009, Rivera addressed the crowd informing of an expansion to South American television. The IWA began promoting the future integration of Banderas, Apolo and “two other world champions”.
In November, WWC began promoting the “unimaginable”, later revealed to be the debut of Ricky Banderas for the promotion. The arrival marked the latest in a series of attempts to take the wrestler away from the IWA, and served to set a match against Carly Colón to open the 2010 season.
In December, reports of an internal restructuration surfaced, including the integration of a new investor. Among these changes, there were issues with the permanency of Mantell, a situation complicated by health issues being faced by Luke Williams. Prior to Christmas in PR, the reinstallation of Vázquez Ortega as promoter was announced.
After WWC spoiled that Sewell had left to join to join the IWA and make a surprise appearance at Christmas in PR, they responded by filing a lawsuit prohibiting the use of the character of “Ricky Banderas” and forcing the use of “El Triple Mega Campeón“ as replacement. WWC&#x27;s own Gorbea refuted the content of the press release, becoming involved in a public dispute with BJ.
During the offseason, the promotion loaned talent to be used in the season closer of independent promotion HWR. As the issues with Mantell persisted, the IWA contracted Luis Santiago to perform the role of booker. It also brought in Booker T and Colossus and placed them in a first contender&#x27;s match.
On January 15, 2010, the IWA loaned several talents to a CWF charity card, including the incumbent Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion, Shane Sewell. The promotion then experienced several difficulties, including issues with its program and a cancelled card. In April 2010, IWA announced that Impacto Total was moving to a new time slot, Saturdays from 2 to 4. The company also lost its champion, Shane Sewell, to the PRWA. In June 2010, IWA postponed the José Miguel Pérez Cup due to weather conditions, a situation that also affected its production of Impacto Total. Approaches to Vega by WWC eventually concluded in a skit where he appeared along Carlos Colón in a television show insulting Carlito. This segment was well received, receiving an approval of 64% among polled wrestling fans. IWA emphasized it in its programming, while WWC did not. Ultimately, the angle was abandoned before Aniversario. On its part, the IWA celebrated its 11th anniversary in Summer Attitude. In August 2010, IWA prevented several of its talents from participating in the MMA reality show Fighting for Real, produced by Shane Sewell. The company made several changes to its programming, removing Joe Bravo from his on-screen role as GM and incorporating the commission with more frequency. For Golpe de Estado 2010, IWA featured WWE superstar Daniel Bryan, who wrestled twice against both of the Rivera brothers. Afterwards, the promotion released Joe Bravo and Mostro and added interviewer Keila Huertas to Impacto Total. IWA continued collaborating with NWG. In November 2010, booker Luis Santiago and announcer Frankie Berdecia left IWA.

===Ricky Banderas lawsuit===
IWA claimed ownership of the character of “El Mesías” Ricky Banderas, forcing WWC to bill the wrestler as “El Hombre que ellos llaman El Mesías Ricky Banderas” and “El Mega Campeón”. In December 2010, Axel Cruz, Bryan and Eric Escobar returned to IWA. Impacto Total returned to its original slot. As rumors swirled about negotiations with a number of performers, the promotion discarded several in a public statement. The change in slot brought several issues in its implementation during January 2011. The return of Ray González, as Rey Fénix, at Histeria Boricua was well received. IWA was forced to cancel a card. During the final months of 2010 an investor joined IWA, which allowed them to brought in some wrestlers.

Citing “technical problems”, IWA aired Impacto Total online despite claiming that it continued in Telemundo and was working with some “beneficial changes”. The issue persisted in April, while the company “worked things out” with the station. In the meantime, Impacto Total aired on Play TV. Afterwards, IWA released a press statement in which it announced that it would stay in Telemundo. After another program failed to air as scheduled, the promotion revealed that it was trying to continue working with the station, but admitted that if that was the case it would be relegated to Punto Dos. Instead, IWA-PR opted to expand its deal with Play TV by reintroducing Zona Caliente. However, the internal issues of the promotion continued and a card was cancelled without prior notice and lost backstage staff. Another was cancelled citing the weather conditions.

===La Invasión===
Days before the celebration of Aniversario 2011, WWC began teasing about an “explosive” storyline. Savio Vega initially denied the implication that he was involved. Instead, as references were made to IWA in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre, Thunder and Lightning appeared. Vega once again denied that the “invasion” was going on. Despite this, both sides continued in negotiations and ultimately reached an agreement late in the final week, with Vega appearing in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. Thunder and Lightning remained the storyline representatives of IWA in WWC. IWA hyped the arrival of WWC wrestlers to Summer Attitude, mentioning Carlito. The angle was well received by the wrestling fans of Puerto Rico. Vega mentioned that both Miguel Pérez and Víctor Jovica opposed to the idea, though he stated that Pérez later warmed up to it. He also confirmed that for the time being its programming was going to continue on Play TV. Four chairs were reserved for IWA the first night of Aniversario 2011, with Thunder and Lightning hinting that they were not alone. The main night of Aniversario, Los Fujitivos wrestled Thunder and Lightning to a no contest in a match were two referees, representing WWC and IWA, counted at the same time. Afterwards, Savio Vega accompanied by a host of IWA wrestlers including Dennis Rivera, Noel Rodiguez, Spectro, Hiram Tua and Carlos Cotto attacked them. He insulted Shane Sewell, Mr. Big and Blitz due to their association with WWC at the moment and insulted Carlito. At IWA Summer Attitude, Gilbert interrupted an homage to Víctor Quiñones, promting a confrontation with Savio Vega. He was backed by WWC wrestlers Díaz, Los Rabiosos, Los Fujitivos and Shane Sewell. The invading team was repelled by the IWA-PR roster, but accepted a challenge issued by Vega. WWC recorded the intervention. Impacto Total continued moving slots at Play TV. On his part, WWC aired footage of its wrestlers at Summer Attitude. Colón answered the insults thrown at him by Savio Vega in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. The collaboration was cancelled when both promotions failed to reach an economic agreement. Another card was cancelled due to a tropical storm. IWA cancelled Golpe de Estado. 
Despite the failure of the collaboration, Los Dueños de la Malicia appeared in Superestrellas and challenged Los Fujitivos for the WWC World Tag Team Championship. At Septiembre Negro they won the match, immediately leaving the venue afterwards. WWC used the commission as a plot device to declare the titles held up, reaffirming the posture later in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. Despite refusing to return the belts to WWC, when interviewed by mainstream media outlet NotiCel Los Dueños de la Malicia assured that they “had not stolen anything” and were the legitimate champions per the rules of professional wrestling. The report also noted that the actions that followed the event were not part of a storyline. WWC later changed the official result of the match through the commissioners, declaring it null and declared that Los Fujitivos remained champions. 
IWA moved its programming to Mega TV. More issues emerged when it went off air, with IWA uploading its shows to YouTube. In December, they announced the return of the show to MegaTV. To open 2012, IWA postponed Histeria Boricua. Savio Vega reappeared in WWC, challenging Carlito both in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre and Euphoria. Afterwards, Carlito answered.

===Foreign use of the brand===
Since at least May 19, 2011, independent Mexican wrestler Exorcista had made the claim of being the &quot;IWA Puerto Rico Champion&quot; in social media, being billed as such in appearances throughout the summer, wearing an unlicensed belt (with a sideplate globe design similar to that of the IWA World Tag Team Championship&#x27;s centerplate) to sell the ruse. On August 5, 2011, Mexico City-based independent promotion Lucha Libre Mexicana del Sureste teased the participation of the purported &quot;IWA World Heavyweight&quot; and CMLL World Middleweight within the promotion. For its first defense that took place two days later, the name of the bootleg title was amended to the fictional &quot;IWA World Lightweight Championship&quot;, although it was still promoted as a heavyweight championship afterwards. For another appearance that took place on September 17, 2011, LLMS used the IWA&#x27;s actual logo to promote the card. On October 12, 2012, former Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion Enrique &quot;Ricky&quot; Cruz denounced that the brand had been appropriated in a message to his followers in Mexico (where he performed for International Wrestling Revolution Group), since a backstory had been created for the &quot;IWA Lightweight Championship&quot; where Exorcista had won it from him.

On November 10, 2011, promoter José E. Mateo launched an independent offshoot named IWA Florida with the approval of Savio Vega, basing it in the city of Orlando in the eponymous American state where a significant portion of the Puerto Rican diaspora is located. Although the company&#x27;s actual name was Independent Wrestling Association, it used the same logo as IWA Puerto Rico due to their inter-promotional affiliation. During its run (2011–2012), Vega also performed as part of the roster.

===Recess, interpromotional events and bankruptcy (2011–2012)===
In ate 2011 the company took a recess to restructure the company and return a few months later in 2012 and make inter-promotional shows with WWC and EWO, but the administration confronted economic problems and announced that it would enter another recess. IWA continued an interpromotional angle with EWO for months, which eventually led to title unifications. In June 2012, IWA announced the postponement and later cancellation of Juicio Final. IWA main figure Savio Vega then started working for WWC as wrestler and occasional booker.

===World Wrestling League (2014–2017)===
When the World Wrestling League (WWL) shifted its focus from international tours to more home events in 2014, it acquired several locals including Savio Vega and Dennis Rivera. An invasion by IWA talents began at the 2015 International Cup, where Vega made his intentions of taking over and renaming the promotion clear. However, two days after the event owner Richard Negrín announced that the promotion was shutting down as part of a public diatribe, entering a period of inactivity that lasted until June and aborting the angle. Vega was brought back in March 2016, beginning another angle that hinted at his intentions of taking over WWL and relaunching IWA, which included having an edition of WWL High Voltage replaced with Impacto Total.

In July 2016, with the angle still unfinished, Negrín entered another sabbatical citing health issues and Vega acquired the promotion. WWL retained its acronym and initially served as a spiritual successor to the IWA, first using flashbacks of his work as General Manager to place him in a similar role as president and then resuming and concluding an unfinished storyline from 2006. The year was concluded with the revival of Christmas in PR, in which the downfall of the IWA was used as a plot element. In May 2017, Golpe de Estado was also reintroduced, with the backlash of Vega&#x27;s long history of authority abuse dating back to the IWA as the main storyline behind a coup d&#x27;état by long running booker Héctor &quot;MoodyJack&quot; Meléndez, in which both him and Dennis Rivera were ousted from the company.

===Team IWA&#x27;s invasion of WWL (2018)===

The passing of hurricane Maria over Puerto Rico forced WWL into an eight-month hiatus, with Juicio Final being revived to serve as its return show. In the event, Vega and Rivera made their return along Noel Rodríguez and announced themselves as Team Savio/IWA (later completed by Richard Rondón and Roxy Tirado). WWL president Manny Ferno opposed them in representation of WWL, along the stable known as Puros Machos that he led. When the promotion for Golpe de Estado 2018 began, the brand was formally reintroduced with the unveiling of a new logo and the reintroduction of several titles. The event featured the first confrontation between factions, with Team Manny/WWL emerging victorious and preventing the name change in the first attempt. However, the storyline continued with Ferno intending to &quot;destroy&quot; the legacy of the brand after &quot;breaking the man&quot; and grew to include Shane Sewell and Slash Venom, in representation of IWA.

Former Impacto Total/Zona Caliente narrator Axel Cruz was brought in to join WWL&#x27;s High Voltage team, while the segment El Tocotón also made a comeback led by Stefano. A rematch was pushed, while emphasis was placed on the fact that Team Savio had only one of the wrestlers that headlined the IWA during its peak (himself) and that one of the members (Roxy Tirado) had never been part of the promotion. IWA picked two straight wins over WWL at Summer Blast (later being joined by Jesús Castillo Jr.) and War in the West, with a returning Apolo being approached by Vega and a disappointed Mr. Big by Ferno. The storyline, however, was written off following a skit where the leader of Puro Macho supposedly ordered an &quot;accident&quot; on his counterpart.

On July 20, 2018, a relaunch of IWA Florida was announced, this time with the inclusion of narrator Willie Urbina to the staff. Additionally, a tournament to fill the vacancies for the Undisputed World Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships was scheduled. This initiative ultimately led to Savio Vega leaving WWL, of which he was a minority owner, to focus on the first card to be held under the brand in more than six years.

===Corporate revival (2018–2019)===

On October 24, 2018, Savio Vega announced the return of the original incarnation of the International Wrestling Association in Puerto Rico, with its return show scheduled for 2019. This followed the reactivation of its official accounts earlier that week. On the other hand, IWA-FL held its first set of tapings on October 27, 2018. In November, the spinoff announced that it would host Histeria Boricua in 2019, in a revelation that also featured the debut of longtime rival headliner Carly Colón under the brand.

On November 29, 2018, Vega announced that the first series to be held by IWA-PR, Impacto Total: El Tour, which was scheduled for January. The IWA also reached agreements with several other local promotions (including WWC and Champion Wrestling Association, which had replaced EWO as the largest independent in the scene in the years since) for the use of classic roster talents that had moved on during the hiatus. To close the book on WWL, Puro Macho was brought in and featured in a confrontation against Vega, Sewell, Apolo and Dennis Rivera over the angle that had been dropped months before. As part of its relaunch, IWA-PR became involved with charity events. Savinovich was brought back, promoting the event in the media. In June 2019, IWA announced the return of flagship show Impacto Total, which would stream on the internet. However, the promotion cancelled Summer Attitude and rescheluded for Golpe de Estado.

===Alliances with WWC and MLW; UPLL (2020–2021)===
On February 13, 2020, a video where Ray González extended an invitation to Savio Vega to attend a WWC to present him with a proposal that would be mutually beneficial was posted in the IWA-PR&#x27;s social media platforms. After some anticipation, the summon was accepted in a subsequent segment aired in Superestrellas de la Lucha Libre. On February 15, 2020, Vega accepted a copy of the document from González and informed that he would give his final answer at the IWA-PR event Histeria Boricua 2020. During this skit, the heel faction known as Dynasty (composed by Eddie Colón, Gilbert and Peter John Ramos) where placed in antagonism to the agreement. The COVID-19 pandemic pauses the progression of the storyline, but both promotions passively helped each other by sharing their weekly shows.

After Savio Vega&#x27;s arrival to Major League Wrestling (MLW) in June 2019, a de facto collaboration between both promotions began, with the emergence of angles involving the IWA Caribbean Heavyweight Championship and Salina de la Renta. In addition, the eventual arrival of MLW World Heavyweight Champion Jacob Fatu and Josef Samael (collectively known as Contra Unit) to IWA-PR was announced prior to the global outbreak, this as part of a collaboration with PCW Ultra.

In July 2020, the creation of a regional alliance known as the &quot;Unión Panamericana de Lucha Libre&quot; (lit. “Pan American Union of Professional Wrestling”) was announced, with IWA-PR joining Society Action Wrestling (SAW-WAG) of Colombia, Súper Lucha Panamá of Panama, ARENA Fight: El Renacer Maya of Nicaragua and Renegados Lucha of Costa Rica as founding members.

In October 2020, IWA-PR&#x27;s association with MLW evolved into a formal strategic alliance for the “celebration of inter-promotional events, direct support to the events of each of the companies and collaboration in other types of promotions”. It was later incorporated into a storyline between Vega and Salina de la Renta over the acquisition by a shady entity known as Azteca Underground.

===IWE Takeover IWA (2021–2022)===
In 2021, IWA began holding cards in bubble format, also televising the pre-recorded Histeria Boricua through MEGA-TV. To close the summer of 2021, IWA aired its iPPV La Gran Amenaza.
A rise in COVID-19 cases due to variants and government restrictions forced IWA to postpone Histeria Boricua and then film the event without fans and air on iPPV. The promotion made its return card on March. 
In mid, end of 2021 Fernando Tonos Alongside of Many Ferno revived the International Wrestling Entertainment (IWE), Tonos says he get a percentage of control on IWA and after the group won all the IWA Championships they rename it and claim as part of IWE rename it all as IWA/IWE.

In Juicio Final the company IWA announce they were going to crown new champions (New IWA World Heavyweight, New IWA Intercontinental Champion &amp; New IWA Tag Team Champions) after the event the company got 2 champions in all divisions except for the Caribbean Championship. (As part of IWE takeover IWA angle) In an attempt to break a world record for oldest champion in professional wrestling, IWA booked Huertas to defeat Ferno for the World Heavyweight Championship at Juicio Final.

Throughout 2022, Epico Colón’s Latin American Wrestling Entertainment (LAWE) was IWA-PR’s direct competition, temporarily displacing WWC in ticket sales and successful events. The sudden folding of this promotion allowed others to pick wrestlers that were previously contracted. IWA-PR secured LAWE World Heavyweight Champion Pedro Portillo III, who began appearing masked and carrying the belt inside a black pouch, as Noriega had done with the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship in 2008.

<doc id="1272042" wikidata="Q380231" url="?curid=1272042" title="Gary Pallister">
<text>Gary Andrew Pallister (born 30 June 1965) is an English former professional footballer and sports television pundit. As a player he was a defender from 1984 to 2001 and is most noted for his nine-year spell at Manchester United, where he formed a formidable defensive partnership with Steve Bruce and won 15 trophies including four Premier League titles, three FA Cups and the European Cup Winners Cup.

Pallister also had several spells with Middlesbrough that yielded over 200 appearances combined over both periods, as well as briefly playing on loan with Darlington in 1985. He was capped 22 times by England between 1988 and 1996, as well as earning nine caps for the England B team.

Following his retirement, Pallister has worked in the media and has appeared as a television pundit for both BBC Sport and ITV Sport, with appearances on &quot;Football Focus&quot; and &quot;Final Score&quot;.

==Club career==

===Middlesbrough===
Although born in Ramsgate, Kent, Pallister grew up in Norton, County Durham and supported nearby Middlesbrough F.C. His footballing career started at non-league Billingham Town. At the age of 19 he joined his boyhood club, Middlesbrough, as a defender; he made 156 league appearances over nearly five seasons, and helped them win consecutive promotions to the Football League Second Division in 1987, and then the First Division in 1988. He moved to Manchester United on 29 August 1989 for £2.3 million.

===Manchester United===
Pallister&#x27;s transfer broke the national record for a fee paid for a defender, as well as being the highest fee between British clubs, and the second highest fee to be paid by a British club (second only to Ian Rush&#x27;s return to Liverpool from Juventus a year earlier).

Pallister had the rare achievement of representing the England national side before appearing in the top flight; in 1988 when playing in the Second Division for Middlesbrough. Later that year he helped &#x27;Boro win their second successive promotion and reach the First Division, just two years after they almost went out of business, but was unable to keep them there and they were relegated on the final day of the 1988–89 season. He began the 1989–90 season with Middlesbrough in the Second Division before his move to United was completed.

Although it was his excellent defensive displays that helped Manchester United to the league title along with Steve Bruce at the heart of the defence, forming one of the best central defensive partnerships in the club&#x27;s history, in the 1992–93 season, he scored a memorable goal in the final home game of the season against Blackburn Rovers. Into stoppage time, with his team winning 2–1, he stepped up to drive a free-kick into the bottom corner from the edge of the penalty area. It was his first goal of the season. He partnered Bruce in central defence for virtually every game until Bruce left United to join Birmingham City on a free transfer at the end of the 1995–96 season. The following campaign saw Pallister partnered with either Bruce&#x27;s former understudy David May or with new signing Ronny Johnsen, and ended with United winning their fourth league title in five seasons. A highlight of this season for Pallister was scoring twice in a 3–1 win against Liverpool at Anfield.

The final season Pallister played for Manchester United was the 1997–98 season in which Manchester United came second in the league table, losing by one point to Arsenal.

During his time at Manchester United, Pallister won the FA Cup in 1990, 1994 and 1996, the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1991, the Football League Cup in 1992 and Premier League titles in 1993, 1994, 1996 and 1997, amongst other honours. He was also part of the team that came second in the league in 1992, 1995 and 1998, as well as the team that finished runners-up in the League Cup in 1991 and 1994 and the FA Cup in 1995. By the time of his departure from Old Trafford after nine years, he was the only player to have collected winner&#x27;s medals in all of the club&#x27;s successes under Alex Ferguson&#x27;s management, and second only to Brian McClair (who left United at the same time) he was the club&#x27;s longest serving player.

He also scored some crucial goals for United. He scored an equaliser in extra time against Crystal Palace in the 1994–95 FA Cup semi-final at Villa Park, forcing a replay which United won and in which Pallister made the scoresheet once again. In April 1997, he scored twice against Liverpool in a match billed the &quot;title decider&quot; which ended in a 3–1 United win at Anfield. These would be the last two goals he scored for the club, who went on to win their fourth league title in five seasons shortly afterwards. His first goal for United had come on 12 November 1989, as he scored their only goal in the 1–0 home win over Nottingham Forest in the First Division.

===Return to Middlesbrough===
With Pallister now aged 33 and United having signed Jaap Stam from PSV Eindhoven, Pallister was sold back to Middlesbrough in July 1998 for £2.5 million, £200,000 more than when he first moved to Manchester United. He was brought back to Teesside by manager Bryan Robson, who had played alongside Pallister at Old Trafford until 1994. He scored once against Southampton in 55 league appearances, as well as appearing in two FA Cup matches and four League Cup matches.

His final playing season, in which Middlesbrough finished 14th in the table, was season 2000–01. He retired from playing due to a succession of injuries on 4 July 2001, at the age of 36, just three weeks after the appointment of Steve McClaren as manager following the departure of Robson.

==International career==
===B team===
Pallister made his debut for the England B team in May 1989; he started the match against Switzerland before being replaced by Alan McLeary in the 2−0 win at Stadion Schützenwiese. He made eight more appearances over the next three years with the last coming in the 3−0 victory against France in February 1992.

===Senior===
Pallister made his debut for England in the friendly with Hungary in April 1988. He played the whole game in the goalless draw at Népstadion in Budapest. He had to wait over three years to make his competitive debut when he played in the win against Turkey during qualifying for UEFA Euro 1992. England qualified for the tournament finals in Sweden but Pallister was not selected in the squad. He featured in the United States Cup in June 1993; he started the defeats against the United States and Germany, and the draw against Brazil, as England finished last place in the group. Pallister played three matches as England failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. He was used sporadically over the next three years, mainly playing in friendlies, before making his last appearances in the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Moldova and Poland in the autumn of 1996. Overall, Pallister won 22 caps and scored no goals.

==Media career==
He has since worked as a TV football pundit, appearing on the BBC and ITV.

==Personal life==
In September 2010, Pallister became an Operations Director with former club Darlington.

<doc id="1272044" wikidata="Q725166" url="?curid=1272044" title="Michael Clarke (musician)">
<text>Michael Clarke (born Michael James Dick; June 3, 1946 – December 19, 1993) was an American musician, best known as the drummer for the 1960s rock group the Byrds from 1964 to 1967. He died in 1993, at age 47, from liver failure, a direct result of more than three decades of heavy alcohol consumption.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Clarke was born in Spokane, Washington. His father was a pipefitter and his mother was an amateur musician. Clarke left home when he was 17 years old and hitchhiked to California to become a musician. In legend, Clarke was said to have been discovered by Byrds&#x27; founder David Crosby while playing bongos on a beach. In fact he was discovered by singer-songwriter Ivan Ulz, in North Beach, San Francisco.

===The Byrds===

Clarke was not an accomplished musician prior to joining the Byrds but he did have previous experience of drumming in his younger years before joining the group. He had played the drums before but, after joining the Byrds, not having a drum set, practiced on a makeshift kit of cardboard boxes and a tambourine, but he did have real drum sticks. According to lead guitarist Roger McGuinn&#x27;s web site, Clarke was hired by McGuinn and Gene Clark for his resemblance to Rolling Stones&#x27; guitarist Brian Jones. Clarke&#x27;s strength as a drummer is considered to be illustrated by his jazz-oriented playing on the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, on the &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot; album.

Though not a prolific songwriter, unlike the other members of the Byrds, Clarke’s compositional contributions with the band encompass co-writing credits for the songs &quot;Captain Soul&quot;, an instrumental from the &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot; album (based on Lee Dorsey&#x27;s &quot;Get Out Of My Life, Woman&quot;), and &quot;Artificial Energy&quot; from &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot;. He was also given an arrangement co-credit for two traditional songs that appeared on &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot;: &quot;Wild Mountain Thyme&quot; and &quot;John Riley&quot; (although the latter is credited to Bob Gibson and songwriter/arranger Ricky Neff on the album itself).

In August 1967, during the recording sessions for &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; album, Clarke walked out on the Byrds and was temporarily replaced by session drummers Jim Gordon and Hal Blaine. Clarke had recently become dissatisfied with his role in the band and didn&#x27;t particularly like the new material that the songwriting members were providing. However, Clarke continued to honor his live concert commitments, appearing at a handful of shows during late August and early September 1967. Clarke returned from his self-imposed exile in time to contribute drums to the song &quot;Artificial Energy&quot; in early December 1967, but was subsequently fired from the band by McGuinn and bass player Chris Hillman once &quot;The Notorious Byrd Brothers&quot; album was completed.

===Hiatus from music, Dillard and Clark and Flying Burrito Brothers===

After a short stint in Hawaii working in the hotel business and pursuing his interest in painting, Clarke played briefly with Gene Clark in Dillard and Clark, before following Hillman and Gram Parsons to country-rock pioneers The Flying Burrito Brothers, after their first album had been recorded. Clarke served with the Burritos between early 1969 and 1972, appearing with the band at the infamous Altamont Free Concert in California, headlined by The Rolling Stones, in December 1969. During the 1974-1980 period, Clarke was a member of Firefall, followed by a period as the drummer for Jerry Jeff Walker, ending in 1982.

===Byrds lawsuit controversy and Hall of Fame induction===
Between 1983 and 1985, Clarke joined former Byrds&#x27; singer Gene Clark in The Firebyrds, a touring band which had been put together to promote Gene Clark&#x27;s 1984 solo album &quot;Firebyrd&quot;. In 1985, following the breakup of The Firebyrds, Clarke and Clark again joined forces for a series of controversial shows billed as a &quot;20th Anniversary Tribute to The Byrds&quot;. Among the other musicians involved in this project were John York, another ex-Byrd from the late 1960s line-up of the group, ex-Burritos and Firefall singer Rick Roberts, ex-member of The Beach Boys early 1970s line-up Blondie Chaplin, and Rick Danko, formerly of The Band. Many nightclubs simply shortened the billing to &quot;The Byrds,&quot; and the pair soon found themselves involved in acrimonious court battles with Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman over use of the group&#x27;s name.
The Byrds set aside their differences long enough to appear together at their induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in January 1991, where the original lineup played three songs together: &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;. Gene Clark died less than five months later, of a heart attack, on May 24, 1991.

From 1987 until his death in 1993, Clarke toured as The Byrds featuring Michael Clarke. Skip Battin and John York, who had played with Roger McGuinn in later versions of the Byrds, also played at various points in The Byrds featuring Michael Clarke. Following the failure of McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman to obtain an injunction against Clarke, it was generally accepted that Clarke&#x27;s continuing usage of the name was tantamount to ownership, particularly when not used by any other group member and where other group members, particularly Roger McGuinn, had repeatedly denied any interest in performing again under the Byrds name. Roger McGuinn later acknowledged that ownership of the Byrds name had likely passed to Michael Clarke&#x27;s estate upon Clarke&#x27;s death, but David Crosby secured the rights to the band&#x27;s name in 2002.

===Declining health and death===
By the late 1980s, Clarke&#x27;s health had declined from a lifetime of hard drinking, resulting in a number of hospital stays. He died of liver failure at the age of 47 at his Treasure Island, Florida, condominium on December 19, 1993. Billy Moore, who had organized a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at a resort where Clarke and his band were scheduled to perform, stated that at the time of his death, Clarke had recently learned that he had become terminally ill due to his liver problems.

During his final days, Clarke had expressed a wish to appear on television in the hope of alerting children to the dangers of alcoholism. Following his wishes, Clarke&#x27;s girlfriend Susan Paul started a foundation in Clarke&#x27;s name, called the Campaign for Alcohol-Free Kids.

In 1994, a year after his death, Clarke&#x27;s paintings were published in Dick Gautier and Jim McMullan&#x27;s book, &quot;Musicians As Artists.&quot;

<text>Winston Antonio Parks Tifet known also as &quot;Jupa de Carnicero” (born 12 October 1981) is a Costa Rican former professional footballer who played as a forward.

He played in Europe for Udinese, Ascoli, Slovan Liberec, Lokomotiv Moscow, Saturn Ramenskoye, Politehnica Timişoara and Baku.

== Club career ==
Winston made his debut in the Costa Rican Primera División in 1999 with only in 17-year-old, playing with his hometown team Limonense and scored his first goal back on 28 November of the same year, he played this season mostly as a substitute, because he was competing at that moment against some players that succeeded during the next few years, like Kurt Bernard, Andy Herron, Rayner Robinson and Ricardo Douglas for a place in the starting line-up. The following season and after the sale of most of the players mentioned before, it was usual to see him in the starting line-up making a dangerous offensive triplet with Victor Núñez and Andy Herron.

His high internationally performances led the Italian club Udinese to purchase the player for $2.1 million from Limonense. However, due to injuries Parks was unable to earn a place in the club&#x27;s first team, he was loaned for six months to Ascoli and eventually moved on to Lokomotiv Moscow, he was again loaned to Saturn Ramenskoye and then he was sold to Slovan Liberec.

After spending six years in Europe he decided to moved back to Costa Rica looking for more minutes on the field in other the get in shape and find again his game and ability. He signed with Alajuelense in summer 2007, but he has had a lot of injuries and only scored two goals in the Apertura&#x27;s tournament.

=== Politehnica Timișoara ===
He returned to Europa and signed for the Romanian club in summer 2008. Parks made his debut in an away match against FC Argeş where he played just one minute. He scored his first two goals against CS Otopeni in a 2–2 draw. In an away match at Gloria Bistriţa he made his worst match of his career and was criticized by the chairman Marian Iancu and put him on transfer list.

=== Khazar Lankaran ===
On 13 August 2010, he was loaned out to Khazar Lankaran with option to buy him at end of the season. He was the goalscorer of the team on 2010–11 season.

=== Baku ===
Parks joined Baku from at the start of the 2011–12 season. After 9 goals in 36 appearances in all competitions for Baku, he left the club at the end of the 2012–13 season.

=== Uruguay Coronado ===
In September 2013, Parks joined Costa Rican Primera División side Uruguay Coronado.

Ahead of the 2014 Verano season, Parks moved to second division side Siquirreña and in summer 2014 he returned to his hometown to play for Limón. He joined Santos de Guápiles in January 2015.

==International career==
Parks gained recognition as an exceptional youth player, appearing in FIFA World Youth Championships U-17 in 1999 held in Nigeria and U-20 in 2001 held in Argentina, and leading Costa Rica during the 2001 U-20 tournament, with four goals.

After making his full national team debut in a November 2001 FIFA World Cup qualification match against Jamaica, he made the roster for the 2002 World Cup, where he appeared in two games as a substitute. Against Turkey he scored the equalizing goal, but failed to score on a second opportunity. He also had a great game against Brazil. His lack of playing time and injuries have, however, resulted in Parks seeing little time during 2006 World Cup qualifying.

He earned a total of 27 caps, scoring 6 goals and represented his country at the 2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

His final international was a November 2011 friendly match against Spain.

<text>Tomoe Gozen (, ) was an onna-musha, a female samurai, mentioned in &quot;The Tale of the Heike.&quot; There is doubt as to whether she existed as she doesn&#x27;t appear in any primary accounts of the Genpei war. She only appears in the epic &quot;The tale of the Heike&quot;. She served under samurai lord Minamoto no Yoshinaka during the Battle of Awazu, part of the Genpei War in the late Heian period, which led to the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate.

== Genpei War ==

She commanded, under the leadership of Yoshinaka, 300 samurai against 2,000 warriors of the rival Taira clan during the war. After defeating the Taira in 1182 and driving them into the western provinces, Yoshinaka took Kyoto and desired to be the leader of the Minamoto clan. His cousin Yoritomo was prompted to crush Yoshinaka, and sent his brothers Yoshitsune and Noriyori to kill him. 

Yoshinaka fought Yoritomo&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Awazu on February 21, 1184, where Tomoe Gozen took at least one head of the enemy. Although Yoshinaka&#x27;s troops fought bravely, they were outnumbered and overwhelmed. When Yoshinaka was defeated there, with only a few of his soldiers standing, he told Tomoe Gozen to flee because he wanted to die with his foster brother .

There are varied accounts of what followed. At the Battle of Awazu in 1184, she is known for beheading Honda no Morishige of Musashi. She is also known for having killed Uchida Ieyoshi and for escaping capture by Hatakeyama Shigetada. After Tomoe Gozen beheaded the leader of the Musashi clan, she presented his head to her master Yoshinaka.

<doc id="1272048" wikidata="Q149510" url="?curid=1272048" title="Bootylicious">
<text>&quot;Bootylicious&quot; is a song recorded by American group Destiny&#x27;s Child for their third studio album &quot;Survivor&quot; (2001). It was written and produced by Rob Fusari, Beyoncé and Falonte Moore. The song contains a prominent sample from Stevie Nicks&#x27; song &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;. It was released as the second single from &quot;Survivor&quot; on May 22, 2001, by Columbia Records.

&quot;Bootylicious&quot; was a commercial success, becoming the group&#x27;s fourth and final US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one single. It also reached the top five in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. A Rockwilder remix of the song featured Missy &quot;Misdemeanor&quot; Elliott and appeared on the soundtrack of the 2001 musical &quot;&quot; and the group&#x27;s remix album &quot;This Is the Remix&quot; (2002).

Although the term &quot;bootylicious&quot; had already been used by rapper Snoop Dogg in Dr. Dre&#x27;s song &quot;Dre Day&quot; (1992), the popularity of &quot;Bootylicious&quot; caused the slang word to become widespread, being added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2004 under the definition &quot;(of a woman) sexually attractive&quot;.

== Writing and production ==
&quot;Bootylicious&quot; was written and produced by Beyoncé, Rob Fusari and Falonte Moore, and was recorded at SugarHill Recording Studios#SugarHill Recording Studios in Houston, and Sound on Sound Studios in New York City. There are conflicting stories about the song&#x27;s origins. According to Knowles, she was inspired to write the song on a flight to either London or Japan as she was listening to the guitar riff of Stevie Nicks&#x27; song &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot;, which reminded her of a &quot;voluptuous woman&quot;. According to Fusari, he wanted to build a track on a sample of Survivor&#x27;s &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;. Unable to locate the song, he chose to sample &quot;Edge of Seventeen&quot; instead. He wanted to replay the guitar riff himself in the studio so as not to lose publishing royalties, but group manager Mathew Knowles (father of Beyoncé Knowles) would not let him do this.

==Music==
According to the sheet music published by EMI Music Publishing at Musicnotes.com, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; is a pop song set in common time with a medium funk tempo of 104 beats per minute. It is written in the key of E minor (recorded in D minor), and Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s vocals span from G3 to B5. Rowland sings the majority of the lead vocals on the track, with her leading both verses, Knowles leading choruses, and Michelle Williams leading the bridge.

== Remixes ==
A hip hop-styled remix (the Rockwilder remix) was produced by Rockwilder, Knowles, and Missy Elliott. This version was issued to urban markets, and had a hip-hop culture-based music video to accompany it, in which Beyoncé wears a belt that has the word &quot;Bootylicious&quot; misspelled as &quot;Bootyliciuos&quot;, as pointed out by Carson Daly on an episode of &quot;TRL&quot;.

A combination of the R&amp;B vocals from this song and the grunge rock music of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; is one of the best-known examples of the &quot;bastard pop&quot; or &quot;mashup&quot; genre, where elements from seemingly incompatible songs are mixed together. A later mashup used the music of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Superstition&quot; with the &quot;Bootylicious&quot; vocals.

== Music video ==
The music video for &quot;Bootylicious&quot;, directed by Matthew Rolston and filmed from May 7–9, 2001, showed Destiny&#x27;s Child performing dance steps from Michael Jackson&#x27;s famous &quot;Billie Jean&quot; performance from the special &quot;Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever&quot;. During the video, moves from several other Michael Jackson videos can be seen such as parts of the choreography from &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, and &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;. Dance moves that were used by Jackson during live performances of &quot;They Don&#x27;t Care About Us&quot; can be seen as well.

As the group is dancing, the members appear in several different costumes. These scenes are interloped with the group dancing in front of a dance troupe made of all boys. The dance sequence ends with a diamond-shaped stage where the group appears wearing pink crop-tops, while the all-male dance troupe appears shirtless, wearing Michael Jackson&#x27;s signature one glove and sagging pants that showed their underwear with &quot;Destiny&quot; at the back. Stevie Nicks is featured playing the sampled riff on a guitar. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé&#x27;s sister, also makes a brief cameo in the video.

The video for &quot;Bootylicious&quot; began airing on BET, VH1, and MTV on the week ending May 27, 2001, with the video premiering on the latter channel&#x27;s &quot;Making the Video&quot; series. The version of the song featured in the music video is slightly different from the album version, removing the synth strings and DJ scratching and percussion fills in favour of a drier mix, with the bass guitar cut out part-way through the final choruses and a fade-out of the instrumental leaving only the vocals near the end. This version was never commercially released.

The music clip is featured on the DualDisc edition of the album &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot; and as an enhanced video on the UK and French editions of the single. The video for the Rockwilder remix featuring Missy Elliott is available on the &quot;Urban Remixes&quot; version of the UK CD single for &quot;Emotion&quot;.

The music video uses a slightly altered version of the song; the difference being the song&#x27;s instrumental. A notable difference in the music video is that the song&#x27;s instrumental fades out at the end of the song, resulting in the final chorus being sung, acapella. Whereas, on the album version, the song&#x27;s instrumental is heard throughout the song and during the final chorus and ends just before Knowles sings her final line.

== Live performances ==
Destiny&#x27;s Child opened the inaugural BET Awards (2001) with a performance of &quot;Bootylicious&quot;. They also performed it on both Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special concerts, complete with their rendition of his dance moves. Before the video&#x27;s premiere, the group had dedicated the video to Michael Jackson. According to Kelly Rowland, Jackson liked the song so much that when he saw them for the first time, he started to sing it and they were very surprised. On February 3, 2013, Beyoncé performed the song along with Rowland and Williams during the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show. They also performed Beyonce&#x27;s &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Bootylicious&quot; debuted at number 66 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on June 9, 2001. Nine weeks later, the song reached number one, becoming the group&#x27;s fourth and final number-one single in the United States. It remained on the chart for 19 additional weeks. As of , it remains the last song by a girl group to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song also peaked at number five on the Hot 100 Airplay chart and number two on the Hot 100 Singles Sales chart, behind Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Loverboy&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; debuted and peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart, behind the Atomic Kitten&#x27;s &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;. It sold over 169,000 copies and propelled &quot;Survivor&quot; back to the top of the UK Albums Chart. Additionally, the song reached the top ten in several other countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Bootylicious&quot; created moderate controversy due to pushing the boundaries of female sexuality. Destiny&#x27;s Child was claiming &quot;G-rated fun&quot; and confidence in body image through the lyrics, yet the song&#x27;s music video suggested much more with the group wearing heavy make-up, form-fitting clothes, performing sexually suggestive dancing, and the video featuring close-ups on several dancers&#x27; buttocks. The song popularized the portmanteau term &quot;bootylicious&quot;, a combination of the words &quot;&quot; and &quot;delicious&quot;, although the term had already been used by Snoop Dogg in the song &quot;Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody&#x27;s Celebratin&#x27;)&quot; (aka &quot;Dre Day&quot; from Dr. Dre&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;The Chronic&quot;) as a pejorative. &quot;Bootylicious&quot; is also mentioned by a character named Champ in the 1993 &quot;Homey, Don&#x27;t Ya Know Me?&quot; episode of &quot;A Different World&quot;. The term was also used previously in the 1999 video game &quot;Duke Nukem: Time to Kill&quot; as the name of a strip club.

The success of the song came after the rise in media visibility of voluptuous personalities such as Jennifer Lopez. There was a media perception that the appearance of these women corresponded to an appreciation of the supposedly neglected larger hips and thighs common in the figures of black and Latina women. The approving neologism &quot;bootylicious&quot; has entered the mainstream English language as part of the crossover of African-American popular culture, fashion, and sexual politics. In September 2011, VH1 ranked &quot;Bootylicious&quot; at number 19 on its list &quot;The 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s&quot;. Rowland has mentioned that &quot;Bootylicious&quot; is the most irritating Destiny&#x27;s Child song to her since she has heard it too many times.

=== Use in commercials ===
&quot;Bootylicious&quot; was used in a commercial for the video game Candy Crush Jelly Saga in 2016.

=== In other media ===
It appeared on the season 11 finale of drag queen reality competition &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;, where contestants Brooke Lynn Hytes and Silky Nutmeg Ganache had to lipsync to it in order to advance to the final round. American singer Normani used the song in her performance on the reality competition show &quot;Lip Sync Battle&quot;, which aired on February 1, 2018. Her set was reminiscent of the song&#x27;s music video, and at some point, one of the back-up dancers &quot;trips&quot; in front of Normani, a callback to Michelle William&#x27;s infamous fall during a performance of the group on &quot;106 &amp; Park&quot; in 2004.

The song appeared in Disney and Pixar&#x27;s 2022 animated film &quot;Turning Red&quot;.

<text>Miguel Ángel Suárez (July 5, 1939 – April 1, 2009) was a Puerto Rican soap opera and movie actor.

==Early years==
Suárez and his sister were born into a middle-class family and raised in the Santurce section of San Juan, Puerto Rico. His father worked at a local supermarket and his mother was a housewife. When Suárez was a child, he went with his mother to see a play. This was his first experience with the theater and Suárez was so impressed that after the curtains rose and the actors did their show, he knew that he wanted to become an actor. Suárez went to school and received his primary and secondary education in his hometown. When Suárez and his sister returned from school, their mother would read stories or prepare little plays which helped to develop their imagination.

The supermarket where the elder Suárez worked was located next to the radio station Radio El Mundo. Manuel Méndez Ballester, a well-known playwright, who worked as a writer for the radio station, frequently visited the supermarket and Suárez&#x27;s father soon became friends with Ballester. In 1947, Ballester told the elder Suárez that he was in need of an 8-year-old for the protagonist role in a play that he wrote because the person he had in mind didn&#x27;t pass the audition. When the elder Suárez realized that the &quot;part&quot; paid more than what he was making working in the supermarket, he took his son to the auditions and this was the beginning of Suárez&#x27;s acting career. In 1956, when Suárez was 17 years old, he enlisted in the United States Navy and was assigned to the submarine division.

==Television==
When Suárez was discharged from the Navy, he returned to Puerto Rico, where he began doing theater work and later starred as Rev. Sullivan in &quot;Las Almas No Tienen Color&quot; (1969), the first soap opera produced by Tommy Muniz for WAPA-TV. In 1972, he was cast in &quot;El Hijo De Angela María&quot;, which was so successful that was soon made into a movie. Afterward the artistic class in the island went through a crisis, and because he was unable to get an acting job, Suarez went to Argentina, where he was given a role in the soap opera &quot;Amor Gitano&quot; (&quot;Gypsy Love&quot;). He later went to Venezuela, where he participated in the soap operas &quot;Corazon de Diamante&quot; (&quot;Heart of Diamonds&quot;) and &quot;Laura Benson&quot;. In Puerto Rico, he participated in many locally produced soap operas, such as &quot;Vivir Para Ti&quot; (&quot;I Live for You&quot;). In 1994, he was cast in &quot;Señora Tentacion&quot; (&quot;Mrs. Temptation&quot;) with Mexican movie star Lucía Méndez. This soap opera was a hit in the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Europe.

==Film==
In 1971, Suárez was cast in the locally produced Woody Allen movie &quot;Bananas&quot; with Jacobo Morales. In 1980, he played an inmate in the TV movie &quot;Escape&quot;, partially filmed in Puerto Rico, with Timothy Bottoms and Colleen Dewhurst. He then went to Hollywood, and in 1980, landed a role in the movie &quot;Stir Crazy&quot;, directed by Sidney Poitier starring Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. He was sometimes credited under the names Miguelángel Suárez and Miguel Suárez.

Other movies in which Suárez participated include &quot;La Gran Fiesta&quot; (1985); &quot;Isabel la Negra&quot; (1978) with Míriam Colón and Raúl Juliá; &quot;Havana&quot; (1990) produced by Sidney Pollack and &quot;Under Suspicion&quot; (2000) with Gene Hackman, Morgan Freeman, and Nydia Caro. In 2007, Suárez performed one of the main roles in Jacobo Morales&#x27; movie &quot;Ángel&quot;.

==Death==
Suárez died on April 1, 2009, losing his battle with esophageal cancer; he was 69 years old. He is survived by his widow, the actress Amneris Morales, his daughter Alondra Suárez and his stepdaughter Belange Rodríguez. Suárez&#x27;s remains were cremated on April 5 in accordance to his wishes. On 4 April 2010, his cremated remains where interred in a family plot located in Santa Maria Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery in Old San Juan.

<text>Monoco (died 1676) was a 17th-century Nashaway sachem (chief), known among the New England Puritans as One-eyed John.

After decades of peaceful coexistence, tensions arose between settlers and natives. The Nashaway attacked the neighboring English settlement in the Lancaster Raid of Lancaster, Massachusetts, in August 1675 and again in February 1676 with Sagamore Sam as part of the more general native-settler conflict known as King Philip&#x27;s War. During the latter action, Monoco kidnapped a villager, Mary Rowlandson, and took her and her children with him and his party for many weeks. Rowlandson later wrote and published what became a best-selling narrative about her captivity with the Indians and release, &quot;A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson&quot;.

On March 13, 1676, Monoco raided Groton, Massachusetts. He took control of a garrison house in the center of town and proceeded to parley with a Captain James Parker, threatening to burn &quot;Chelmsford, Concord, Watertown, Cambridge, Charlestown, Roxbury, Boston, adding at last in his dialect: &quot;What me will - me do.&quot; He then burned the town to the ground, forcing its inhabitants to flee to Concord.

In September 1676 Monoco was captured in Dover, New Hampshire and executed on the Boston Common in Boston, Massachusetts when his associate Tantamous&#x27; son, Peter Jethro intentionally (or unintentionally) turned in his fellow Native Americans to be executed and enslaved through negotiations with Richard Waldron.

<doc id="1272080" wikidata="Q10863702" url="?curid=1272080" title="Post-metallocene catalyst">
<text>A post-metallocene catalyst is a kind of catalyst for the polymerization of olefins, i.e., the industrial production of some of the most common plastics. &quot;Post-metallocene&quot; refers to a class of homogeneous catalysts that are not metallocenes. This area has attracted much attention because the market for polyethylene, polypropylene, and related copolymers is large. There is a corresponding intense market for new processes as indicated by the fact that, in the US alone, 50,000 patents were issued between 1991-2007 on polyethylene and polypropylene.

Many methods exist to polymerize alkenes, including the traditional routes using Philips catalyst and traditional heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts, which still are used to produce the bulk of polyethylene.

==Catalysts based on early transition metals==

Homogeneous metallocene catalysts, e.g., derived from or related to zirconocene dichloride introduced a level of microstructural control that was unavailable with heterogeneous systems. Metallocene catalysts are single-site systems, implying that a uniform catalyst is present in the solution. In contrast, commercially important Ziegler-Natta heterogeneous catalysts contain a distribution of catalytic sites. The catalytic properties of single-site catalysts can be controlled by modification of the ligand. Initially ligand modifications focused on various cyclopentadienyl derivatives, but great diversity was uncovered through high throughput screening. These post-metallocene catalysts employ a range of chelating ligands, often including pyridine and amido (R2N−). These ligands are available in great diversity with respect to their steric and electronic properties. Such postmetallocene catalysts enabled the introduction of Chain shuttling polymerization.

==Catalysts based on late transition metals==
The copolymerization of ethylene with polar monomers has been heavily studied. The high oxophilicity of the early metals precluded their use in this application.
Efforts to copolymerize polar comonomers led to catalysts based upon nickel and palladium, inspired by the success of the Shell Higher Olefin Process. Typical post-metallocene catalysts feature bulky, neutral, alpha-diimine ligands. DuPont commercialized the Versipol olefin polymerization system. Eastman commercialized the related Gavilan technology. These complexes catalyze the homopolymerize ethylene to a variety of structures that range from high density polyethylene through hydrocarbon plastomers and elastomers by a mechanism referred to as “chain-walking”. By modifying the bulk of the alpha-diimine, the product distribution of these systems can be &#x27;tuned&#x27; to consist of hydrocarbon oils (alpha-olefins), similar to those produced by more tradition nickel(II) oligo/polymerization catalysts. As opposed to metallocenes, they can also randomly copolymerize ethylene with polar comonomers such as methyl acrylate.

A second class of catalysts feature mono-anionic bidentate ligands related to salen ligands. and DuPont. 

The concept of bulky bis-imine ligands was extended to iron complexes Representative catalysts feature diiminopyridine ligands. These catalysts are highly active but do not promote chain walking. The give very linear high-density polyethylene when bulky and when the steric bulk is removed, they are very active for ethylene oligomerization to linear alpha-olefins.

A salicylimine catalyst system based on zirconium exhibits high activity for ethylene polymerization. The catalysts can also produce some novel polypropylene structures. Despite intensive efforts, few catalysts have been successfully commercialized for the copolymerization of polar monomers.

<text>Torvosaurus () is a genus of large megalosaurine theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 165 to 148 million years ago during the Callovian to Tithonian ages of the late Middle and Late Jurassic period in what is now Colorado, Portugal, Germany, and possibly England, Spain, Tanzania, and Uruguay. It contains two currently recognized species, Torvosaurus tanneri and Torvosaurus gurneyi, plus a third unnamed species from Germany.

In 1979, the type species &quot;Torvosaurus tanneri&quot; was named. Measuring around long and weighing approximately , &quot;T. tanneri&quot; was among the largest terrestrial carnivores in North America during the Late Jurassic. Specimens of &quot;Torvosaurus gurneyi&quot; were measured up to in length and in body mass, suggesting that it was much larger than &quot;T. tanneri&quot; and was the largest terrestrial carnivore in Europe during the Late Jurassic. Based on bone morphology, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; is thought to have had very powerful short arms.

== Discovery ==


Fossilized remains of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; have been found in North America, Portugal, Germany, and possibly in England, Spain, Tanzania, and Uruguay. The first discovered remains referable to &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; were discovered in 1899 by Elmer Riggs in the &quot;Freeze-out Hills&quot; of southeastern Wyoming, northwest of Medicine Bow. The material consisted of part of the left foot and right hand and they were taken to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where they were stored until being re-discovered around 2010. The specimen was assigned to &quot;Torvosaurus tanneri&quot; after being described in 2014.

More remains of a large theropod that is now believed to have been &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; were discovered in the Tendaguru Formation of Tanzania and was named &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; &quot;ingens&quot; by Werner Janensch in 1920, based on the specimen MB R 1050, a long tooth from German East Africa (now Tanzania). It was eventually reclassified as a probable member of Carcharodontosauridae before being reclassified as a probable member of the &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; genus in 2020. Although it was only referred to as &quot;Torvosaurus sp.&quot;, one commentator has noted it could potentially be called &quot;Torvosaurus ingens&quot;. Soto &quot;et al.&quot; described teeth of a member of the genus &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; from the Tacuarembó Formation of Uruguay. The authors noted that some of the specimens of “&quot;Megalosaurus” ingens&quot; figured by Werner Janensch share the features of the Uruguayan material and stated that the materials from Tanzania and Uruguay may represent the same taxon, due to geographical proximity, but ultimately concluded that, based on only teeth, they do not share any derived characteristics to distinguish them from the described species of the genus, &quot;T. tanneri&quot; and &quot;T. gurneyi&quot;. However, Rauhut &quot;et al.&quot; consider the teeth to be undiagnostic, being coherent in size and shape with a variety of other theropods (including carcharodontosaurids), thus considering their attribution to the genus to be problematic.

In 1971, Vivian Jones of Delta, Colorado, in the Calico Gulch Quarry in Moffat County, discovered a single gigantic thumb claw of a theropod. This was shown to James Alvin Jensen, a collector who was working for Brigham Young University. In an effort to discover comparable fossils, Vivian&#x27;s husband Daniel Eddie Jones directed Jensen to the Dry Mesa Quarry, where abundant gigantic theropod bones, together with &quot;Supersaurus&quot; remains, proved present in rocks of the Morrison Formation. From 1972 onward, the site was excavated by Jensen and Kenneth Stadtman. The type species &quot;Torvosaurus tanneri&quot; was named and described in 1979 by Peter Malcolm Galton and Jensen. The genus name &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;torvus&quot;, meaning &quot;savage&quot;, and the Greek word &quot;sauros&quot; (σαυρος), meaning &quot;lizard&quot;. The specific name &quot;tanneri&quot; comes from the, first counselor in the First Presidency of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Nathan Eldon Tanner.
In 1985, Jensen could report a considerable amount of additional material, among it being the first skull elements. The fossils from Colorado were further described by Brooks Britt in 1991. The holotype, BYU 2002, originally consisted of upper and lower arm bones. The paratypes included some back bones, hip bones, and hand bones. When the material described in 1985 is added, the main missing elements are the shoulder girdle and the thighbone. The original thumb claw, specimen BYUVP 2020, was only provisionally referred, as it had been found in a site away from the Dry Mesa Quarry. The holotype and paratypes represented at least three individuals, these being two adults and a juvenile. In 1991, Britt concluded that there was no proof that the front limbs of the holotype were associated and chose the left humerus as the lectotype. Several single bones and teeth found in other American sites have been referred to &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;.
In 1992, fossils of a large theropod found at Como Bluff in Wyoming contained skull, shoulder girdle, pelvic, and rib elements. They were named by Robert T. Bakker &quot;et al.&quot; as the species &quot;Edmarka rex&quot;. Bakker &quot;et al&quot; were impressed with the size of &quot;Edmarka&quot;, noting that it &quot;would rival &quot;T. rex&quot; in total length,&quot; and viewing this approximate size as &quot;a natural ceiling for dinosaurian meat-eaters.&quot; This was often considered a junior synonym of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;, but a detailed analysis has not been carried out yet. The same site has rendered comparable remains for which the &quot;nomen nudum&quot; &quot;Brontoraptor&quot; has been used. Most researchers now regard both specimens as belonging to &quot;Torvosaurus tanneri&quot;. However, &quot;Edmarka rex&quot; and &quot;Brontoraptor&quot; require reclassification to determine whether or not they actually belong to &quot;T. tanneri&quot;, as all the specimens described prior to their discovery indicate that they reached their adult size and both incomplete specimens lack detailed osteological descriptions.

In 2012, a still undescribed, 55% complete specimen was discovered in Colorado in the Skull Creek Quarry, which is an exposure of the Morrison Formation. The specimen, nicknamed &quot;Elvis&quot;, included the pelvic, spine, and hind limb bones, a complete, associated backbone, as well as cranial elements. It is the most complete specimen of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; found to date. A mounted skeleton of the specimen, with missing parts reconstructed with casts from other &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; specimens, is currently on display in the Museum of Natural History &amp; Science in Cincinnati.

In 2000, material from Portugal was referred to a &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; sp. by Octávio Mateus and Miguel Telles Antunes. In 2006, fossils from the Portuguese Lourinhã Formation were referred to &quot;Torvosaurus tanneri&quot;. In 2012, however, Matthew Carrano &quot;et al.&quot; concluded that this material could not be more precisely determined than a &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; sp. In 2013 and 2014, eggs with and without embryos were reported from Portugal and referred to &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;. The species from Portugal was named &quot;T. gurneyi&quot; in honor of James Gurney in 2014, the creator of the &quot;Dinotopia&quot; series of books. It is the largest named theropod known from Europe, although an isolated anterior caudal vertebra from the Vega Formation in Spain, which may belong to &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; or a closely related taxon, is about 15% larger than the one found on &quot;T. gurneyi.&quot; It was the morphological distinctiveness of the holotype maxilla ML1100 that led to the naming of the Portuguese species. In 2017, a set of Portuguese cranial material assigned to &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; was described, including a specimen interpreted as belonging to the same individual as the holotype of &quot;Torvosaurus gurneyi&quot;.

In 2020, Soto &quot;et al.&quot; described FC-DPV 2971, a tooth from Uruguay, as belonging to a new unnamed species of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;. They also assigned &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;/&quot;Ceratosaurus ingens&quot; (specimen MB R 1050) from Tanzania to &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;. Also in 2020, a fragmentary maxilla referable to &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; was described from the middle Callovian Ornatenton Formation of Germany. This is the oldest record of the genus and suggests that megalosaurines originated in Europe, or at least that Europe was a biogeographical turntable for them from the Middle to the early Late Jurassic. Other possible &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; instances in Europe include fragmentary remains from the Kimmeridge Clay of England that possibly belong to the genus. These consist of a tibia (OUMNH J.29886) and a maxilla fragment that were collected separately from each other.

== Description ==

&quot;Torvosaurus&quot; was a very large and robust predatory dinosaur. &quot;T. tanneri&quot; was initially described as long, but a detailed osteological description has revised its length estimate to . &quot;T. gurneyi&quot; was initially estimated around long, but its body length estimate was revised to in its specific description. Claims have been made indicating even larger sizes for the American species &quot;T. tanneri&quot;, with estimates of up to in length and more than based on incomplete remains of &quot;Edmarka rex&quot; and &quot;Brontoraptor&quot;. However, &quot;Edmarka rex&quot; and &quot;Brontoraptor&quot; lack detailed analyses to verify whether or not they actually belong to &quot;T. tanneri&quot;. &quot;T. tanneri&quot; is estimated to have weighed approximately , while &quot;T. gurneyi&quot; is estimated to have weighed .

Among the differentiating features originally recognized between &quot;T. gurneyi&quot; and &quot;T. tanneri&quot; are the number of teeth, alongside the size and shape of the mouth. While the upper jaw of &quot;T. tanneri&quot; has more than 11 teeth, that of &quot;T. gurneyi&quot; has less. However, later examination of a new right maxilla, probably belonging to the same individual as the holotype of &quot;T. gurneyi&quot;, has determined that, while the two species can be distinguished based on the morphology of the maxillary medial wall and interdental plates, the supposedly lower number of maxillary teeth in the Portuguese form may be an artifact of preservation, since it is not possible to know the exact number of teeth in the complete maxilla at the moment.

The material from Germany is further distinguished by the other two species by a temporal difference of c. 10 Ma and a few morphological differences which indicate that it was the third species outside a sister taxon relationship between &quot;T. tanneri&quot; and &quot;T. gurneyi&quot;. The material is only 10% smaller than the maxilla of &quot;T. tanneri&quot;, although the ontogenetic stage of the specimen is unknown. This indicates that derived megalosaurines were already among the largest terrestrial predators of the late Middle Jurassic, with only a moderate increase in size in the genus by the Late Jurassic.
&quot;Torvosaurus&quot; had an elongated, narrow snout, with a kink in its profile just above the large nostrils. The frontmost snout bone, the premaxilla, bore three rather flat teeth oriented somewhat outwards with the front edge of the teeth crown overlapping the outer side of the rear edge of the preceding crown. The maxilla was tall and bore at least eleven rather long teeth. The antorbital fenestra was relatively short. The lacrimal bone had a distinctive lacrimal horn on top. Its lower end was broad in side view. The eye socket was tall with a pointed lower end. The jugal was long and transversely thin. The lower front side of the quadrate bone was hollowed out by a tear-shaped depression, the contact surface with the quadratojugal. Both the neck vertebrae and the front dorsal vertebrae had relatively flexible ball-in-socket joints. The balls on the front side of the vertebral centra had a wide rim, a condition by Britt likened to a Derby hat. The tail base was stiffened in the vertical plane by high and in side view wide neural spines. The whole of the arm was very strong, but somewhat short. Whether the thumb claw was especially enlarged is uncertain. In the pelvis, the ilium resembled that of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and had a tall, short, front blade and a longer pointed rear blade. The pelvis as a whole was massively built, with the bone skirts between the pubic bones and the ischia contacting each other and forming a vaulted closed underside.

== Systematics and classification ==

When first described in 1979 by Galton and Jensen, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; was classified as a megalosaurid, which is the current consensus. It was later assigned to Carnosauria by Ralph Molnar &quot;et al.&quot; in 1990, then to a basal position in Spinosauroidea by Oliver Walter Mischa Rauhut in 2003, and to a very basal position in Tetanurae by Thomas Holtz in 1994. All these assignments are not supported by present phylogenetic analysis. In 1985, Jensen assigned &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; to a family of its own, Torvosauridae. Despite support for this concept by Paul Sereno and Mateus, it seems redundant because &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; is closely related to, and perhaps the sister species of, the earlier &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; within Megalosaurinae. However, Torvosauridae may be used as an alternative name for Megalosauridae if &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; is considered an indeterminable &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. Though a close relative of &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; is seemingly more advanced, or apomorphic. &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;″s larger clade, Megalosauridae, is most commonly held as a basal branch of Tetanurae, considered to be less derived than carnosaurs or coelurosaurs and likely related to the spinosaurids.
The following is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Carrano, Benson, and Sampson (2012) showing the relationships of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;:

=== Distinguishing anatomical features ===
According to Carrano &quot;et al.&quot; (2012), &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; can be distinguished based on the following characteristics:
* The presence of a very shallow maxillary fossa (it lacks a &quot;fenestra maxillaris&quot; piercing the bone wall)
* The presence of fused interdental plates
* The pneumatic fossae in the posterior dorsal and the anterior caudal vertebrae centra being expanded to form enlarged, deep openings
* The puboischiadic plate being highly ossified (the paired bony plates of both sides connect and close off the entire underside of the pelvis, a very basal trait that Galton &amp; Jensen saw as an indication that Theropoda was polyphyletic, with Carnosauria having independently evolved from carnivorous Prosauropoda)
* A distal expansion of the ischium shaft with a prominent lateral midline crest and an ovalur outline when examined in lateral view
* The cervical vertebrae are opisthocoelous with a pronounced flat rim around the anterior ball (according to Rauhut, 2000)
* A transverse fenestra is situated in the neural arch of the dorsal vertebrae in front of the hyposphene (according to Rauhut, 2000)

== Paleobiology ==

The study of fossilized embryos of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; provides researchers with information about the transformation of the embryo over time, the different developmental pathways present in dinosaur lineages, dinosaur reproductive behavior, and dinosaur parental care. In 2013, Araújo &quot;et al&quot;. announced the discovery of specimen ML1188, a clutch of crushed dinosaur eggs and embryonic material attributed to &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;. This discovery further supports the hypothesis that large theropods were oviparous, meaning that they laid eggs and hence that embryonic development occurred outside the body of female dinosaurs. This discovery was made in 2005 by the Dutch amateur fossil-hunter Aart Walen at the Lourinhã Formation in Western Portugal in fluvial overbank sediments that are considered to be from the Tithonian age of the Jurassic, approximately 152 to 145 million years ago. This discovery is paleontologically significant for a number of reasons: (a) these are the most primitive dinosaur embryos known; (b) these are the only basal theropod embryos known; (c) fossilized eggs and embryos are rarely found together; (d) it represents the first evidence of a one-layered eggshell for theropod dinosaurs; and (e) it allows researchers to link a new eggshell morphology to the osteology of a particular group of theropod dinosaurs. The specimen is housed at the Museu da Lourinhã in Portugal. As the eggs were abandoned due to unknown circumstances, it is not known if &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; provided parental care to its eggs and young or abandoned them shortly after laying. However, the eggshells are highly porous, allowing efficient gaseous exchange between the external and internal media, thus indicating the eggs were buried for incubation within substrate in a manner similar to modern seaturtles. This is also corroborated by the undisturbed taphonomic setting and low-energy geological context.

All documented &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; specimens from the Morrison Formation are from similarly sized, likely adult individuals and the lack of immature individuals may be explained by many factors, none of which are mutually exclusive. For one thing, the formation is known to preserve large vertebrates better than smaller ones. Immature individuals may also have occupied a different ecological niche from adults in habitats where their remains were likely to preserve as fossils and they may have been the prey of choice of larger predators as well. &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; may also have experienced Type B1 population survivorship, as has been found in other dinosaurs, with mortality increasing after sexual maturity was achieved, leading to an abundance of mature individuals in the fossil record. A final possibility is that immature &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; remains could be misidentified due to having different proportions compared to the very large and robust adults.

== Paleoecology ==
=== Provenance and occurrence ===
The type specimen of &quot;Torvosaurus tanneri&quot;, BYU 2002, was recovered in the Dry Mesa Quarry of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation in Montrose County, Colorado. The specimen was collected by James A. Jensen and Kenneth Stadtman in 1972 in medium-grained, coarse sandstone that was deposited during the Tithonian and Kimmeridgian ages of the Jurassic, approximately 153 to 148 million years ago. This specimen is housed in the collection of Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.

=== Fauna and habitat in North America ===
Studies suggest that the paleoenvironment of this section of the Morrison Formation included rivers that flowed from the west into a basin that contained a giant, saline alkaline lake and there were extensive wetlands in the vicinity. The Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry of western Colorado yields one of the most diverse Upper Jurassic vertebrate assemblages in the world. The Dry Mesa Quarry has produced the remains of the sauropods &quot;Apatosaurus&quot;, &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;, &quot;Diplodocus&quot;, &quot;Barosaurus&quot;, &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, and &quot;Camarasaurus&quot;, the iguanodonts &quot;Camptosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dryosaurus&quot;, and the theropods &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, &quot;Tanycolagreus&quot;, &quot;Koparion&quot;, &quot;Stokesosaurus&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Ornitholestes&quot;, as well as &quot;Othnielosaurus&quot;, &quot;Gargoyleosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;.

The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Other animal fossils discovered include bivalves, snails, ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, amphibians, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial (like &quot;Hoplosuchus&quot;) and aquatic crocodylomorphs, cotylosaurs, several species of pterosaurs, like &quot;Harpactognathus&quot;, and early mammals, such as multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and triconodonts.

=== Fauna and habitat in Europe ===
The Ornatenton Formation is a Callovian aged shallow marine deposit, within the formation &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; was sympatric with the closely related and also large &quot;Wiehenvenator.&quot; The Lourinhã Formation is Kimmeridgian-Tithonian in age. The environment is coastal and therefore has a strong marine influence. Its flora and fauna are very similar to that of the Morrison. &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; appears to be the top predator here. It lived alongside the European species of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; (&quot;A. europaeus&quot;), &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, &quot;Stegosaurus&quot;, and presumably &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;. The theropod &quot;Lourinhanosaurus&quot; also stalked the area. &quot;Lusotitan&quot; was the largest sauropod in the region, while the diplodocids &quot;Dinheirosaurus&quot; and &quot;Lourinhasaurus&quot; were also present. &quot;Dacentrurus&quot; and &quot;Miragaia&quot; were both stegosaurs, while &quot;Dracopelta&quot; was an ankylosaurian. &quot;Draconyx&quot; was an iguanodontid related to &quot;Camptosaurus&quot;. Due to the marine nature of the Lourinhã Formation, sharks, plesiochelyid turtles, and teleosaurid crocodyliforms are also present.

===Fauna and habitat in Africa===
The small-scale trough and ripple cross-bedded fine-grained sandstone at the base of the Upper Dinosaur Member of the Tendaguru Formation, of which possible &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; material is known from, is interpreted as tidal flat deposits. Stagnant water bodies, such as small lakes and ponds, were present and a freshwater depositional environment close to the sea was also probably present.

The possible unnamed &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; species from the Tendaguru Formation would have shared its habitat with many species of sauropods, such as &quot;Australodocus&quot;, &quot;Dicraeosaurus&quot;, &quot;Giraffatitan&quot;, &quot;Janenschia&quot;, &quot;Tornieria&quot;, &quot;Wamweracaudia&quot;, three unnamed species of diplodocine sauropods, an unnamed species of flagellicaudatan, and &quot;The Archbishop&quot;. The theropods it coexisted with were &quot;Allosaurus tendagurensis&quot;, &quot;Ceratosaurus roechlingi&quot;, &quot;Elaphrosaurus&quot;, &quot;Labrosaurus stechowi&quot;, &quot;Ostafrikasaurus&quot;, &quot;Veterupristisaurus&quot; (of which it would have possibly competed with to be top predator), a possible abelisauroid, and an indeterminate megalosauroid, while the ornithischians it coexisted with were &quot;Dysalotosaurus&quot; and &quot;Kentrosaurus&quot;. As far as pterosaurs are concerned, it coexisted with &quot;Tendaguripterus&quot;, an indeterminate archaeopterodactyloid, an indeterminate azhdarchid, two indeterminate dsungaripteroids, an indeterminate rhamphorynchoid, and an indeterminate pterosaur of unknown classification. Due to the coastal environment of the Tendaguru Formation, crocodyliformes, such as &quot;Bernissartia&quot;, amphibians, including an unnamed lissamphibian, and sharks are also present.

===Fauna and habitat in South America===
Within South America, possible &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; remains are only present within the Tacuarembó Formation of Uruguay. Because the formation was laid down in fluvial to lacustrine sandstones, siltstones, and mudstones, this indicates that the environment of the formation would have been dominated by rivers, streams, and lakes.

If present, &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; would probably have been the apex predator in the Tacuarembó Formation, although it may have been rivalled by &quot;cf. Ceratosaurus&quot;. It shared its habitat with two unnamed theropods, an unnamed coelurosaur, an unnamed sauropod known solely from footprints, an unnamed ornithopod also known from footprints, an indeterminate mesoeucrocodylian, an indeterminate turtle species that lived alongside the named turtle species &quot;Tacuarembemys kusterae&quot;, and the possible pholidosaur &quot;Meridiosaurus vallisparadisi&quot;. Fish, such as &quot;Arganodus tiguidiensis&quot;, &quot;Asiatoceratodus cf. tiguidensis&quot;, &quot;Neoceratodus africanus&quot;, and &quot;Priohybodus arambourgi&quot;, and bivalves, such as &quot;Diplodon&quot;, are also present.

=== Coexistence with other large carnivores ===
&quot;Torvosaurus&quot; coexisted with other large theropods such as &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; in the United States and Portugal, possibly &quot;Veterupristisaurus&quot; in Tanzania, and possibly &quot;cf. Ceratosaurus (?)&quot; in Uruguay. The three, possibly four, species appear to have had different ecological niches, based on anatomy and the location of fossils. &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; and &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; may have preferred to be active around waterways and had lower, more sinuous, bodies that would have given them an advantage in forest and underbrush terrains, whereas &quot;Allosaurus&quot; had shorter bodies, longer legs, were faster and less maneuverable, and seem to have preferred dry floodplains. Also, Rauhut et al. (2016) proposed that allosaurids and megalosaurids would have had different environmental preferences, the former being more common in inland areas, while the latter being dominant in marine and coastal environments.

On the other hand, the majority of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; remains from the Morrison Formation have been found in localities preserving multiple taxa, including &quot;Allosaurus,&quot; with &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; itself being a minor component of the bonebeds. This pattern has been interpreted as indicative of &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; sharing habitats with other predators, most notably &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, but at much lower abundances. The three may also have had different dietary preferences, with &quot;Allosaurus&quot; being more suited for bone slicing (thanks to its short and stout serrated teeth, deep and narrow skull, and powerful dorsoventral movement capacity of the neck), while &quot;Ceratosaurus,&quot; with its long and blade-like teeth and relatively straight neck, would have probably been incapable of doing so, instead concentrating on the deepest organs of a carcass. While probably capable of some bone consumption, &quot;Torvosaurus,&quot; with its large skull and teeth and large, powerful, and lithe body may have been specialized in opening up and dismembering exceptionally large sauropod carcasses. This would have allowed smaller theropods, like &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, better access in a possible commensalism relationship.

&quot;Allosaurus&quot; was itself a potential food item to other carnivores, as illustrated by an &quot;Allosaurus&quot; pubic foot marked by the teeth of another theropod, probably &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; or &quot;Torvosaurus&quot;. The location of the bone in the body (along the bottom margin of the torso and partially shielded by the legs) and the fact that it was among the most massive in the skeleton indicates that the &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was being scavenged.
Bite marks on &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Mymoorapelta&quot; remains were found among other bones with feeding traces in the Upper Jurassic Mygatt-Moore Quarry. Unlike the others, these have left striations that, when measured to determine denticle width, produced tooth and body size extrapolations greater than any known specimen of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; or &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;, the two large predators known for osteological remains from the quarry. The extrapolations are instead coherent, either with an unusually large specimen of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; or a separate large taxon like &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; which is not known from the quarry. The result either increases the known diversity of the site based on ichnological evidence alone or represents powerful evidence of cannibalism in &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. Based on the position and nutrient value associated with the various skeletal elements with bite marks, it is predicted that while &quot;Mymoorapelta&quot; was either predated upon or scavenged shortly after death, &quot;Allosaurus&quot; was scavenged some time after death.

<doc id="1272097" wikidata="Q965649" url="?curid=1272097" title="Nian Rebellion">
<text>The Nian Rebellion () was an insurrection against the Qing dynasty in northern China from 1851 to 1868, contemporaneously with the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1864) in southern China. The rebellion was suppressed, but the population and economic losses contributed to the collapse of the empire in the early 20th century.

== Origin ==
Nian is a word borrowed from the Huaibei dialect, a form of Central Plains Mandarin, where it was used to refer to loosely affiliated gangs or groups or “bandits”. The Nian movement was formed in the late 1840s by Zhang Lexing and, by 1851, numbered approximately 2000. Unlike the Taiping Rebellion movement, the Nian initially had no clear goals or objectives, aside from criticism of the Qing government. Their slogan was &quot;&#x27;kill the rich and aid the poor.&#x27;&quot; However, the Nian were provoked into taking direct action against the Imperial regime following a series of environmental disasters.

The 1851 Yellow River flood deluged hundreds of thousands of square miles and caused immense loss of life. The Qing government slowly began cleaning up after the disaster but could not provide effective aid, as government finances had been drained during the First Opium War and the ongoing Taiping Rebellion. The damage created by the disaster had still not been repaired when, in 1855, the river burst its banks again, drowning thousands and devastating the fertile province of Jiangsu. Along with the destruction caused by the floods famine spread. At the time, the Qing government was trying to negotiate a deal with the European powers, and as state finances had been so severely depleted, the regime was again unable to provide effective relief. This enraged the Nian movement, which blamed the Europeans for contributing to the nation troubles, and increasingly viewed the Qing government as incompetent.

The Nian rebels seemed to have been influenced by the previous 1794 White Lotus Rebellion, recruiting from secret societies and sects such as the White Lotus, and actively borrowing their terminology and symbols, examples being the practice of sworn brotherhood, five colours of banners, flags with eight trigrams, and the widespread use of units of woman warriors. Zhang Lexing, leader of the rebellion, used the title &quot;Bright King of the Great Han&quot;, an address reminiscent of White Lotus leadership positions.

Political scientists Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer suggest that the rebellion was fueled, at least in part, by decades of female infanticide caused by the flood-related economic misery, leading to a large population of frustrated young men without any women to marry, perhaps as many as a quarter of all young men in the area being in this category of &quot;bare branches&quot;.

== The conflict ==
The Nian rebels were to a large degree desperate and poor peasants who banded together in bandit groups simply to survive. However, as natural disasters grew worse, these bandit groups grew increasingly large, and eventually became armies that were able to directly challenge the government. Nevertheless, the main interest of most Nian members remained plundering communities that were better off, as well as resisting taxation. Religious motifs likewise were of little importance to the Nian rebels. While the Nian forces possibly inherited some of their symbols such as red turbans and Eight Trigram flags from the White Lotus, the overall influence of spiritual movements such as the White Lotus or the God Worshipping Society on them was low. For example, White Lotus rebels sometimes fought alongside Nian groups, but the latter sometimes also attacked the former in hopes of plunder. On average, the Nian groups in Henan remained more similar to mere bandits than the Nian in Anhui. Overall, the Nian movement &quot;remained primarily the expression of mundane strategies of survival&quot; according to historian Elizabeth J. Perry. They were never revolutionaries, and besides slogans that called for death of government officials and the rich, as well as hopes for a more just society, they lacked clear, well-defined goals. That some Nian armies became actual rebel movements was mostly due to the ambitions of individual Nian leaders who wanted to become legitimate rulers.

The Nian utilized cavalry in part to aid in looting, which served to support both the Nians&#x27; forces and their home communities. In contrast to their mobile cavalry, the Nians&#x27; defensive tactics were based on the so-called &quot;earthwall communities&quot; they controlled. Support of the peasantry proved crucial and provided the true base of the Nians&#x27; power.

In 1851, the Nian began raiding the grain stores and silver caches of villages. Upon the seizure of Nanjing by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, some Nian leaders sought an alliance with the Taiping. While Hong Xiuquan bestowed titles upon the Nian leaders and the Nian and the Taiping occasionally cooperated, full coordination between the two rebellions was never achieved. Cases in which Nian armies submitted or even fully joined the Taipings remained rare, as most remained bandit armies that were only interested in imminent profit and survival.

In 1855, Zhang Lexing took direct action by launching attacks against government troops in central China. By the summer, the fast-moving Nian cavalry, well-trained and fully equipped with modern firearms, had cut the lines of communication between Beijing and the Qing armies fighting the Taiping rebels in the south. Qing forces were badly overstretched as rebellions broke out across China, allowing the Nian armies to conquer large tracts of land and gain control over economically vital areas. The Nian fortified their captured cities and used them as bases to launch cavalry attacks against Qing troops in the countryside, prompting local towns to fortify themselves against Nian raiding parties. This resulted in constant fighting which devastated the previously rich provinces of Jiangsu and Hunan.

In 1856, several Nian bands formed an alliance led by Zhang Lexing, organizing themselves into a loose confederation of five armies. Each army was identified by a colored banner, operated largely autonomously, and recruited mostly people belonging to a single clan. As result, each banner army had a core area which consisted of a number of villages whose inhabitants were related to each other. Due to the widely differing numbers of the involved clans, the banner armies were accordingly smaller or bigger: the yellow banner army, led by Zhang himself, drew its forces from 18 villages; the white banner army of Kung Teh from 13; the red banner army of Hou Shih-wei from 12; the blue banner army of Han Lao-wan from just six; and the black banner army of Su T&#x27;ien-fu from one hundred villages. Though Zhang tried to impose more order and coordination upon the alliance, he enjoyed only limited success in this regard. Internal differences caused the alliance to quickly fall apart, and by 1858 it was effectively dissolved.
In early 1856, the Qing government sent the Mongol General Senggelinqin, who had recently crushed a large Taiping army, to defeat the Nian. Senggelinqin&#x27;s army captured several fortified cities and destroyed most of the Nian infantry, and killed Zhang Lexing himself in an ambush in 1863. However, in late 1864, the Nian movement survived as skilled Taiping commanders Lai Wenguang (賴文光) (1827–1868) and Fan Ruzeng (1840–1867) arrived to take control of the Nian forces, and the bulk of the Nian cavalry remained intact. Senggelinqin&#x27;s infantry-based army could not stop the fast moving cavalry from devastating the countryside and launching surprise attacks on Imperial troops.

In late 1865, Senggelinqin and his bodyguards were ambushed by Nian troops and killed, in the Battle of Goulawjai. The Qing regime sent General Zeng Guofan (曾国藩), who had recently ended the Taiping Rebellion by capturing the Taiping capital, to take command of Imperial forces protecting Beijing. They provided him with modern artillery and weapons, purchased from the Europeans at exorbitant prices. Zeng&#x27;s army set about building canals and trenches to hem in the Nian cavalry, an effective but slow and expensive method. General Zeng was relieved of command after Nian infantry broke through one of his defense lines, and he was replaced by Generals Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang equipped with more European artillery and firearms.

In late 1866, the remaining Nian forces split into two, with the Eastern Army, under command of Lai Wenguang, stationed in central China whilst the Western Army advanced on Beijing. The Western Army, commanded by Zhang Zongyu, Zhang Lexing&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son, was defeated southwest of Beijing by Qing troops, leaving large swathes of Nian territory exposed to a Qing counter-attack. By late 1867, Li Hongzhang&#x27;s and Zuo Zongtang&#x27;s troops had recaptured most Nian territory, and in early 1868, the remnants were crushed by the combined forces of the government&#x27;s troops and the Ever Victorious Army.

== Military equipment ==
The Nian rebels were equipped with guns (including modern Western guns), muskets, and a significant quantity of cannons up to 5000 pounds in weight.

== Assessment ==
The Nian rebellion failed to topple the Qing dynasty largely because it failed to make alliances with other rebels, especially the Taiping movement. The Nian only symbolically supported Taiping efforts by accepting the Taiping king&#x27;s &quot;appointments&quot;, but refusing to follow his orders. Had the Nian and Taipings joined forces, the Qing government would have been faced with a formidable threat, in spite of its alliances with European powers.

Despite the Nians&#x27; failure to seize power, the events of the rebellion dealt a severe blow to the Qing dynasty. The environmental disasters of 1851 and 1855 devastated the richest provinces of China, depriving the Qing regime of tax income and trade duties. The endless fighting between Nian troops and Qing forces, who made widespread use of scorched earth tactics, ruined the countryside and resulted in countless deaths. Although the Nian rebellion was smaller than that of the Taiping, it severely drained government finances, devastated the richest areas of China, and left China&#x27;s economy in a very precarious state. In the long term, the Nian rebellion was to become one of the major factors in the collapse of Qing China.

<doc id="1272103" wikidata="Q2793913" url="?curid=1272103" title="Nightmare at 20,000 Feet">
<text>&quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot; is the third episode of the fifth season American television anthology series &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, based on the short story of the same name by Richard Matheson, first published in the short story anthology &quot;Alone by Night&quot; (1961). It originally aired on October 11, 1963, and is one of the most well-known and frequently referenced episodes of the series. The story follows a passenger on an airline flight, played by William Shatner, who notices a hideous creature trying to sabotage the aircraft during flight.

In 2019, Keith Phipps of &quot;Vulture&quot; stated that the episode &quot;doubles as such an effective shorthand for a fear of flying&quot;, making it endure in popular culture. This is the first of six episodes to be directed by Richard Donner.

==Opening narration==
==Plot==
While traveling by airplane on a dark stormy night, Robert Wilson sees a gremlin on the wing outside his window. He tries to alert his wife Julia and the stewardess, but every time they look out the window, the gremlin hides, so Robert&#x27;s claim seems crazy. Robert admits the oddness of he being the only one to see the gremlin. His credibility is further undermined by this being his first flight since suffering a nervous breakdown six months earlier, which also occurred on an aircraft. Robert realizes that his wife is starting to think he needs to go back to the sanitarium, but his more immediate concern is the gremlin tinkering with the engines, which could cause the aircraft to crash.

In response to his repeated attempts to raise an alarm, the flight engineer comes out to evaluate the situation and the stewardess gives Robert a sedative, which he pretends to take but spits out. Robert then takes a sleeping police officer&#x27;s revolver, straps himself in, and opens the emergency exit door by which he is sitting. Fighting against the wind and rain, he shoots repeatedly at the gremlin, who is struck and falls off the wing.

Once the airplane has landed, Robert is whisked away on a gurney and in a straitjacket. He tells his wife that only he really knows happened during the flight. In the final scene, the camera pans up and away to reveal damage to one of the aircraft&#x27;s engines, as of yet unnoticed by anyone.

==Closing narration==
==Cast==
* William Shatner as Robert Wilson
* Christine White as Julia Wilson
* Edward Kemmer as the flight engineer
* Asa Maynor as stewardess Betty Crosby
* Nick Cravat (uncredited) as the gremlin

William Shatner and Christine White each appeared in one earlier episode of the original series. Shatner starred in &quot;Nick of Time&quot; (October 1960) and White had the female lead in &quot;The Prime Mover&quot; (March 1961).

==Short story version==
The short story which appeared in 1961 in &quot;Alone by Night&quot; differs from the TV episode. In the short story, the name is Arthur Jeffrey Wilson, while in the TV episode it is Robert or Bob Wilson. The major difference is that Wilson is flying alone in the story. His wife&#x27;s name is given as Jacqueline, while in the episode it is Julia. Wilson has two sons in the story. In the story, the gun is brought aboard the airplane by Wilson undetected. He experiences nausea when he flies and takes Dramamine pills. This explains his anxiety.

In the episode, Wilson&#x27;s earlier hospitalization is detailed as the background to his anxiety. He has had a nervous breakdown and is in recovery. In the short story, by contrast, this background is absent. Instead, Wilson is suicidal. At one point, he takes out his gun and contemplates shooting himself.

He describes the apparition as a &quot;gremlin&quot; and explains that Allied pilots had seen unidentified objects during World War II. This detail is absent in the episode.

The story and the episode are both ambiguous about the creature. In the story, it is described as a &quot;filthy little animal&quot; but also as a &quot;man&quot; like in the episode. The creature has &quot;a face not human&quot; in the story.

In the story, Wilson stated that it would be revealed that what he said was true when the airplane was inspected. In the episode, the damaged engine is shown that vindicates Wilson&#x27;s account. Nevertheless, both endings are ambiguous. In the story, we have to rely on Wilson&#x27;s own account of events. In the episode, the damaged engine suggests his version may be true, but there is no evidence that it was due to the gremlin.

==Remakes==
===&quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; version===
The episode was remade in 1983 by director George Miller as a segment of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;. John Valentine, played by John Lithgow, suffers from severe fear of flying. The plane flies through a violent thunderstorm, and Valentine hides in the lavatory trying to recover from a panic attack, but the flight attendants coax him back to his seat. He notices a hideous gremlin on the wing of the plane and begins to spiral into another severe panic. He watches as the creature wreaks havoc on the wing, damaging the plane&#x27;s engine. Valentine finally snaps and attempts to break the window with an oxygen canister, but is wrestled to the ground by another passenger (an off-duty security guard). Valentine takes the passenger&#x27;s gun, shoots out the window (causing a breach in the pressurized cabin), and begins firing at the gremlin. This catches the attention of the gremlin, who rushes up to Valentine and destroys the gun, then leaps away into the sky. The police, crew, and passengers write off Valentine as insane. However, while a straitjacketed Valentine is carried off in an ambulance claiming that he is a hero, the aircraft maintenance crew arrives and finds the damage to the plane&#x27;s engines, complete with claw marks which alerts everyone.

===2019 version===
Adam Scott was cast in an episode for the 2019 reboot series, entitled &quot;Nightmare at 30,000 Feet&quot;. Other cast mates include Chris Diamantopoulos, China Shavers, Katie Findlay and Nicholas Lea. The remake removes the gremlin completely, though it makes a cameo as a doll that washes up on the atoll near the end, and instead focuses on a sinister podcast hosted by the enigmatic Rodman Edwards (voiced by Dan Carlin).

====Opening narration====
====Plot====
Justin Sanderson is a magazine journalist suffering from PTSD, who is boarding Golden Airways Flight 1015 for a flight to Tel Aviv. While awaiting his flight, he befriends Joe Beaumont, a former pilot for the company and alcoholic who suffered some unspecified failure in the past.

At his seat, Sanderson discovers an MP3 player that has a podcast playing called &quot;Enigmatique&quot;, which describes a &quot;Flight 1015&quot; which was lost without explanation. Sanderson begins to panic and tries to make sense of the situation, but is told to calm down. He listens further and hears speculation about passengers who might have been involved somehow in the plane&#x27;s disappearance; his attempts to investigate only annoy the other passengers and crew. He learns that the last words heard from the pilot were &quot;Good night, New York&quot;, and desperately tries to warn the pilot not to say that, but is restrained by an air marshal.

Beaumont approaches and confides that he believes him. Guessing that the flight number – and coincidental departure time – is the code to the cockpit, Sanderson gets Beaumont access, who overpowers the crew and takes control of the flight. As Beaumont subdues the passengers and crew with oxygen deprivation, he reveals his plan to crash the plane to atone for his past failures. As Beaumont signs off with &quot;Good night, New York&quot;, it dawns on Sanderson that he indirectly causes the crash.

He awakens on an island and learns from the MP3 player that all the passengers and crew actually survived and were rescued, except for Sanderson who mysteriously disappeared. The other passengers and crew reveal themselves where they blame Sanderson for stranding them. Taking a nearby rock, he shouts to them that he saved their lives as he tells the approaching irate crowd to stay back. They start to beat Sanderson to death. The MP3 player is then picked up by Jordan Peele. The final shot pulls away from the distant fight scene and more approaching passengers to show the island and the burning wreckage of Golden Airways Flight 1015 offshore.

====Closing narration====
==Reception==
===Accolades===
Keith McDuffee of &quot;TV Squad&quot; listed the gremlin as the ninth scariest television character of all time in 2008.

==In popular culture==
The episode is considered one of the most popular of the series and parts of the plot have been repeated and parodied several times in popular culture, including television shows, films, radio and music:

===Parodies===
* On the October 20, 1984, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in a skit with guest host Jesse Jackson, Ed Grimley sits next to Jackson on a plane, sees the gremlin, and disturbs Jackson, who eventually walks off the set.
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror IV&quot; (1993) is a segment called &quot;Terror at 5 1/2 Feet&quot;. It takes place on a school bus rather than an aircraft, and puts Bart Simpson in the role of Bob Wilson. An AMC Gremlin driven by Hans Moleman drives alongside the bus.
* Episode 12a of season 1 of &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot;, &quot;The Man Who Cried &quot;Clown&quot;&quot;, parodies the episode. On a flight, Johnny Bravo is noticing a clown standing on the wing and spends the episode trying to alert the bizarre passengers. In the twist ending, Johnny gets rid of the clown only to be told that there is a clown on the other wing as well and they are supposed to balance the plane. 
* In the &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun&quot; episode &quot;Dick&#x27;s Big Giant Headache: Part 1&quot; (1999), John Lithgow&#x27;s character meets a character played by Shatner as he gets off an aircraft. When Shatner describes seeing something horrifying on the wing, Lithgow replies, &quot;The same thing happened to me!&quot; This references not only Lithgow&#x27;s portrayal of the nervous passenger in the 1983 &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; remake, but also an earlier &quot;3rd Rock&quot; episode &quot;Frozen Dick&quot; (Season 1, Ep 12, 1996) when he and Jane Curtin&#x27;s characters were due to fly to Chicago to pick up awards before Dick panicked about something on the wing while the plane was still on the tarmac and gets them both kicked off the plane.
* On the March 16, 2010, episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, guest host Jude Law plays Shatner&#x27;s original role, while cast regular Bobby Moynihan is the gremlin on the wing of the jet. At one point, musical guest Pearl Jam are all on the wing as well, talking with the gremlin.
* In the July 7, 1996, episode of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, Miss Piggy is bothered by a gremlin while riding in an airplane. Miss Piggy goes to tell another passenger, who turns out to be William Shatner (playing himself). Shatner looks at the Gremlin and nonchalantly says, &quot;Oh. Him again.&quot; He claims that he has been complaining about the gremlin for years, but nobody does anything about it.
* In &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot;, Jim Carrey parodies Shatner and his character in this film.
* In the movie &quot;Sharknado 2: The Second One&quot;, Fin Shepard checks the wing of the plane, and sees a shark on the wing of the plane. The flight attendant tells him to calm down.
* &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; features gremlins from the film &quot;Gremlins&quot; attacking a plane.
* In the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;I Dated a Robot&quot;, the main characters watch a TV show entitled &quot;The Scary Door&quot;, which features a gremlin damaging a plane along with parodies of other story-lines from &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In the season 7 episode, “Zapp Dingbat,” Zapp Brannigan says to Kif Kroker, “Kif, I’m bored. What say you go out on the wing and pretend you’re a gremlin.”
* In the 2015 sketch &quot;Airplane Continental&quot; of sketch comedy show &quot;Key &amp; Peele&quot;, Peele&#x27;s character encounters a gremlin while looking out the airplane window. Interestingly, Peele would later produce a non-parodic remake of this story for the 2019 Twilight Zone series, although omitting the gremlin (see above).
*In Madagascar 2, there is a scene in which Alex the Lion looks out of the window and sees Mort hanging out of the plane&#x27;s wing in a similar manner to the gremlin.

===Other references===
* American band Anthrax made a video (directed by Marcos Siega) for their 1998 song Inside Out inspired by this episode. 
* UK band Pop Will Eat Itself&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Cure for Sanity&quot; include the song &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 feet&quot;. The track is said to be inspired by singer Clint Mansell&#x27;s fear of flying.
* The episode inspired the opening sequence of the 2000 slasher movie &quot;Urban Legends: Final Cut&quot;, directed by John Ottman.
* In the 2014 horror film &quot;Flight 7500&quot;, a character watches the episode as part of the in-flight services, paralleling their own dire situation.
* A 1973 made-for-television horror film, unrelated to this episode of The Twilight Zone, similarly titled &quot;The Horror at 37,000 Feet&quot;, also co-stars William Shatner.
* In episode 14 of &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, two references are made to &quot;that &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode with Captain Kirk&quot; during dealings with a gremlin. The second reference takes place on a plane in which the gremlin has been let loose.

<doc id="1272105" wikidata="Q462105" url="?curid=1272105" title="Brian McClair">
<text>Brian John McClair (born 8 December 1963) is a Scottish football coach and former professional footballer. As a player, he was a forward from 1980 to 1998, notable for his near 11-year spell at Manchester United where he won 14 trophies including four Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. 

McClair also had important tenures at Scottish clubs Celtic and Motherwell, winning the Scottish League and Scottish Cup with the former. At Motherwell, he combined his football with studying mathematics at the University of Glasgow. He was nicknamed &quot;Choccy&quot;, as his last name rhymed with the delicacy &quot;chocolate éclair&quot;.

McClair played in 30 international games for Scotland between 1986 and 1993, and was selected for their squad at UEFA Euro 1992.

After retiring from playing, McClair took on a coaching role at Blackburn Rovers before returning to Manchester United, where he spent several years as Youth Academy Director.

==Club career==
===Early career===
McClair began his career with Aston Villa on leaving school in 1980, but left after one season (in which Villa were Football League champions) having never played a competitive game.

He then returned to Scotland in the summer of 1981 and signed for Motherwell. Initially a midfielder, manager Jock Wallace converted him to a striker. McClair went on to score 15 league goals in two seasons, including a hat-trick at Fir Park in a 3–0 win over Rangers on 3 January 1983, and both goals in a 2–1 win over Celtic eleven days later.

===Celtic===
In May 1983, Billy McNeill signed McClair for Celtic, for a fee of £100,000. McClair was effectively signed as a replacement for the recently departed Charlie Nicholas. However, McClair would never actually play for McNeill, as the Celtic manager resigned in June 1983 and was replaced by Davie Hay.

McClair scored in a 2–0 win on his debut against Partick Thistle at Firhill in the Glasgow Cup on 9 August 1983. By the end of an impressive first season at Celtic, McClair had scored 32 goals and established himself as a first team regular. A four-goal haul against Dundee in a 6–2 win during September, an outstanding solo goal in a 5–0 win over Sporting CP in the UEFA Cup, and a goal in the 3–2 extra time defeat against Rangers in the League Cup Final in March 1984 highlighted McClair&#x27;s goalscoring ability.

The following season saw the arrival of Mo Johnston from Watford and, despite their contrasting personalities, McClair and Johnston would quickly form a deadly goalscoring partnership for Celtic. McClair continued to score regularly for Celtic, and at the end of the season won his first winner&#x27;s medal, coming on as a substitute in Celtic&#x27;s 2–1 win over Dundee United in the 1985 Scottish Cup Final.

Despite competition from Alan McInally and Mark McGhee, McClair and Johnston remained the regular pairing playing up front for Celtic. Their goals helped Celtic to a dramatic league championship win in 1985–86. This culminated in a memorable final-day 5–0 win over St Mirren at Love Street, with McClair and Johnston both scoring twice as title-rivals Hearts capitulated to a 2–0 defeat at Dundee.

The 1986–87 season was McClair&#x27;s last at Celtic. Despite a bright start to the campaign from Celtic, the team&#x27;s form began to fade during the winter months and they squandered a nine-point lead in the league, which was won by Rangers. Another League Cup final defeat against Rangers (despite an outstanding goal by McClair) and a fourth-round defeat at Hearts in the Scottish Cup saw Celtic finish the season without any silverware. Despite this collective disappointment, McClair was an outstanding success that year. He scored 41 goals in total to finish top scorer in the league with 35 goals, and won both the Scottish Football Writers&#x27; Association Player of the Year and the Scottish Players&#x27; Player of the Year awards.

In four seasons at Celtic, McClair made 204 appearances in all competitions and scored 126 goals. He won the Scottish Cup in 1985 and the Scottish Premier Division in 1986.

===Manchester United===
McClair joined Manchester United in July 1987 for a transfer fee of £850,000 that was determined by a tribunal. Celtic initially wanted £2 million for him, a fee which would have made him the most expensive player at the time to have signed for any British club, whilst Manchester United had offered only £400,000.

In his first season for Manchester United he scored 24 league goals, becoming the first Manchester United player to surpass 20 league goals in one season since George Best in the 1967–68 season. His first goal for Manchester United came in the third game of the season, a 2–0 home win over Watford. He then scored in the next game, a 3–1 away win over Charlton Athletic. He scored a brace in the 4–2 away win over Sheffield Wednesday on 10 October 1987, and another double in the late December win over defending champions Everton. He put a further double over Sheffield Wednesday in the March return game at Old Trafford, and scored a hat-trick against Derby County in early April. He managed further braces in the final two games of the season (against Portsmouth and Wimbledon). Only Liverpool&#x27;s John Aldridge netted more First Division goals that season and, in all competitions, McClair scored a total of 31 goals. He could have had even more, but his late penalty miss at Arsenal in the FA Cup fifth round meant that Manchester United were eliminated with a 2-1 loss in what was a trophy-less season.

1988–89 was a trying season for United after the excellent progress of 1987–88. Having spent his first year playing alongside Peter Davenport, McClair now found himself paired with returning hero Mark Hughes (back at Manchester United after two years abroad) and much was expected of the newly formed partnership. By the end of November, however, McClair had scored just twice in the league, whereas Hughes had found the net eight times, with Manchester United finding themselves in mid-table after a run of eight draws and one defeat. Results improved over the next couple of months as United crept to the fringes of the title challenge, but fell away in the final quarter of the season as the club finished 11th. McClair and Hughes both managed 16 goals in all competitions, with Hughes being the club&#x27;s leading scorer in the league with 14 goals to McClair&#x27;s 10.

Having scored in both the quarter-final and the replay of the semi-final, he was on the winning side as Manchester United won 1–0 over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup Final replay at Wembley on 17 May 1990, five days after drawing 3–3 in the first match. In the league, however, it had been a disappointing time for McClair as he scored just five goals and Manchester United finished 13th – their lowest finish since they were relegated from the top flight 16 years earlier. He was now facing competition from highly promising young striker Mark Robins, who had scored 10 goals in 23 first team games that season.

He did however score the winning goal for Manchester United in the 1991 UEFA Super Cup against Red Star Belgrade, which followed his role in their European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup triumph over Barcelona. McClair had now won the fight to keep his place in the first team as he rediscovered his goalscoring touch and Robins was now struggling to get into the team.

In October 1990, McClair was involved in controversy when in reaction to a late challenge he repeatedly kicked Arsenal&#x27;s Nigel Winterburn in the back as he lay prone on the ground, sparking a 21-man brawl. The two had a history, as Winterburn had been seen mocking McClair after his penalty miss in the FA Cup fifth round three seasons before, which earned the Arsenal player a lot of criticism. Manchester United had a point deducted for this episode, and Arsenal (who went on to be league champions that season) had two points docked.

In 1991–92, McClair scored the only goal in the 1992 League Cup Final against Nottingham Forest at Wembley. However, he missed out on a league title winner&#x27;s medal as United&#x27;s shortage of goals in the second half of the season cost them the championship, which was clinched by Leeds United. Alex Ferguson then made unsuccessful bids for strikers David Hirst and Alan Shearer, before signing Dion Dublin, who was bought as backup for McClair and Hughes.

Having been the main striker for Manchester United during his first season, and then partnered Mark Hughes when the Welshman returned from Barcelona, McClair was switched to a central midfield role when Eric Cantona joined United in November 1992. The casualty of this shift was the veteran midfielder Bryan Robson, who from this point onwards was mostly used as a substitute.

When Roy Keane was signed the following summer, McClair&#x27;s first team opportunities became increasingly limited. He did, however, manage another cup final appearance and goal at Wembley, coming off the bench to score Manchester United&#x27;s fourth goal as they beat Chelsea 4–0 in the 1994 FA Cup Final. He was rarely left out of the squad, often coming on as a substitute to play in midfield or attack. In 1993–94, the first season where he was no longer considered a first team regular, he appeared in 26 league games (though started just 12 of them) and scored one goal. In all competitions, he managed a total of six goals from 38 appearances (19 starts, 19 as a substitute). He had a much more active campaign in 1994–95, playing in all but two of the 42 league games, scoring five goals. In total, he played 53 games in all competitions and scored eight goals.

When squad numbers were introduced in the Premier League for its second season in 1993–94, McClair was issued with the number 9 shirt that had traditionally been his during the days of 1–11 shirt numbering. However, this number went to Andy Cole at the start of the 1996–97 season, after which McClair wore the number 13 shirt.

Despite his infrequent first team appearances, McClair opted to stay on at Manchester United as a squad player to provide reliable cover in midfield and attack, making, in 1994–95, over 40 appearances (in the first eleven or as a substitute). The following season, he featured in 22 league games, gaining him his third (of four) league winner&#x27;s medal with the club. He was still receiving playing time in 1996–97, and on the first day of that season, McClair was credited with an assist for David Beckham&#x27;s spectacular goal from the halfway line against Wimbledon. Later that year, McClair had a hand in another memorable goal, assisting Eric Cantona in his famous chipped goal on 21 December 1996 against Sunderland at Old Trafford. On 15 April 1997 a crowd of over 44,000, including an estimated 10,000 Celtic supporters, attended McClair&#x27;s testimonial game against his former club Celtic at Old Trafford.

He scored a total of 127 goals for Manchester United, the last two coming against Coventry City in a 4–0 away league win on 22 November 1995, although he made some 60 first team appearances over the next two and a half years (mostly as a substitute). In eleven years at Old Trafford, he made a total of 471 appearances in all competitions. In later years, as his first team opportunities were reduced, McClair became something of a cult hero at Manchester United due to his &quot;Choccy&#x27;s Diary&quot; being published in the official Manchester United magazine.

At the end of the 1997–98 season, McClair was given a free transfer to complete his playing days elsewhere. He accepted an offer to return to Motherwell, where he spent six months before announcing his retirement.

==International career==
In international football, McClair won 30 caps for Scotland. He made his debut in November 1986 in a 3–0 win over Luxembourg at Hampden Park. The match was a qualifier for Euro 88, and McClair played in midfield behind his Celtic teammate and striker partner, Mo Johnston. Scotland failed to qualify for this tournament, but McClair became a regular in the Scotland squad for the next six years. He made five appearances for Scotland in the qualifiers for the 1990 World Cup. McClair also played for Scotland in a &#x27;B&#x27; international against East Germany in April 1990 shortly before the 1990 World Cup. However, although Scotland qualified for this tournament, he failed to make manager Andy Roxburgh&#x27;s 22-man squad.

Despite his omission, McClair continued to feature regularly for Scotland and represented his country at the 1992 European Championships, where he scored his first international goal in a 3–0 win over the CIS (formerly USSR). His final appearance for Scotland came in June 1993, when he scored the opening goal for Scotland in a 3–1 win over Estonia at Pittodrie.

==Management and coaching career==
McClair returned south of the border in December 1998 to become Brian Kidd&#x27;s assistant at Blackburn Rovers. But the pair were unable to prevent Blackburn from slipping out of the Premier League, and within a year, both had been sacked. He returned to Old Trafford as a youth team coach soon afterwards.

Ironically, when Kidd first joined Blackburn after being assistant manager at Manchester United, McClair was one of several high-profile names to be linked with the assistant manager&#x27;s vacancy at Old Trafford, as was former teammate Steve Bruce, who was then managing Sheffield United.

In 2001, he was appointed as Manchester United reserve team manager, and promptly won the Premier Reserve League in his first season as coach. In his second season, he was in charge of the Under-19 team which clinched the 2003 FA Youth Cup. Some players from that team, such as David Jones, Chris Eagles and Kieran Richardson, went on to make appearances in the first team.

At the end of the 2004–05 season, the first team finished trophyless, but the Reserve Teams headed by Ricky Sbragia, with McClair as his assistant, won an unprecedented quadruple of the Pontins&#x27; Holidays League, the FA Premier Reserve League, The Pontins&#x27; Holidays League Cup and the Premier Reserve League Playoff. Their quest for an unprecedented five trophies was thwarted when they lost to Manchester City in the Manchester Senior Cup.

After a year of shadowing Les Kershaw, McClair replaced him as the director of the Manchester United youth academy at the start of the 2006–07 season. His son, Liam, was once a member of the United academy.

McClair left Manchester United after being appointed by the Scottish Football Association in February 2015 as their national performance director, effective from 1 June 2015. McClair succeeded Mark Wotte, who resigned from the position in October 2014. McClair left the role in July 2016.

==Personal life==
Though born in Bellshill, McClair was brought up in Airdrie and supported Airdrieonians as a child.

McClair has three children, Siobhan, Laura and Liam.
