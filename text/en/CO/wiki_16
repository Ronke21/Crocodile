<text>Shape optimization is part of the field of optimal control theory. The typical problem is to find the shape which is optimal in that it minimizes a certain cost functional while satisfying given constraints. In many cases, the functional being solved depends on the solution of a given partial differential equation defined on the variable domain.

Topology optimization is, in addition, concerned with the number of connected components/boundaries belonging to the domain. Such methods are needed since typically shape optimization methods work in a subset of allowable shapes which have fixed topological properties, such as having a fixed number of holes in them. Topological optimization techniques can then help work around the limitations of pure shape optimization.

==Definition==
Mathematically, shape optimization can be posed as the problem of finding a bounded set formula_1, minimizing a functional
:formula_2, 
possibly subject to a constraint of the form
:formula_3 
Usually we are interested in sets formula_1 which are Lipschitz or C1 boundary and consist of finitely many components, which is a way of saying that we would like to find a rather pleasing shape as a solution, not some jumble of rough bits and pieces. Sometimes additional constraints need to be imposed to that end to ensure well-posedness of the problem and uniqueness of the solution.

Shape optimization is an infinite-dimensional optimization problem. Furthermore, the space of allowable shapes over which the optimization is performed does not admit a vector space structure, making application of traditional optimization methods more difficult.

==Examples==
==Techniques==

Shape optimization problems are usually solved numerically, by using iterative methods. That is, one starts with an initial guess for a shape, and then gradually evolves it,
until it morphs into the optimal shape.

=== Keeping track of the shape ===
To solve a shape optimization problem, one needs to find a way to represent a shape in the computer memory, and follow its evolution. Several approaches are usually used.

One approach is to follow the boundary of the shape. For that, one can 
sample the shape boundary in a relatively dense and uniform manner, that is, to consider enough points to get a sufficiently accurate outline of the shape. Then, one can evolve the shape by gradually moving the boundary points. This is called the &quot;Lagrangian approach&quot;.

Another approach is to consider a function defined on a rectangular box around the shape, which is positive inside of the shape, zero on the boundary of the shape, and negative outside of the shape. One can then evolve this function instead of the shape itself. One can consider a rectangular grid on the box and sample the function at the grid points. As the shape evolves, the grid points do not change; only the function values at the grid points change. This approach, of using a fixed grid, is called the &quot;Eulerian approach&quot;. The idea of using a function to represent the shape is at the basis of the level-set method.

A third approach is to think of the shape evolution as of a flow problem. That is, one can imagine that the shape is made of a plastic material gradually deforming such that any point inside or on the boundary of the shape can be always traced back to a point of the original shape in a one-to-one fashion. Mathematically, if formula_5 is the initial shape, and formula_6 is the shape at time &quot;t&quot;, one considers the diffeomorphisms

:formula_7

The idea is again that shapes are difficult entities to be dealt with directly, so manipulate them by means of a function.

=== Iterative methods using shape gradients ===

Consider a smooth velocity field formula_8 and the family of transformations formula_9 of the initial domain formula_5 under the velocity field formula_8:

:formula_12,

and denote

:formula_13

Then the Gâteaux or shape derivative of formula_2 at formula_5 with respect to the shape is the limit of

:formula_16

if this limit exists. If in addition the derivative is linear with respect to formula_8, there is a unique element of formula_18 and

:formula_19

where formula_20 is called the shape gradient. This gives a natural idea of gradient descent, where the boundary formula_21 is evolved in the direction of negative shape gradient in order to reduce the value of the cost functional. Higher order derivatives can be similarly defined, leading to Newtonlike methods.

Typically, gradient descent is preferred, even if requires a large number of iterations, because, it can be hard to compute the second-order derivative (that is, the Hessian) of the objective functional formula_22.

If the shape optimization problem has constraints, that is, the functional 
formula_23 is present, one has to find ways to convert the 
constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Sometimes ideas based on Lagrange multipliers, like the adjoint state method, can work.

=== Geometry parametrization ===

Shape optimization can be faced using standard optimization methods if a parametrization of the geometry is defined. Such parametrization is very important in CAE field where goal functions are usually complex functions evaluated using numerical models (CFD, FEA...). A convenient approach, suitable for a wide class of problems, consists in the parametrization of the CAD model coupled with a full automation of all the process required for function evaluation (meshing, solving and result processing). Mesh morphing is a valid choice for complex problems that resolves typical issues associated with re-meshing such as discontinuities in the computed objective and constraint functions.

In this case the parametrization is defined after the meshing stage acting directly on the numerical model used for calculation that is changed using mesh updating methods. 
There are several algorithms available for mesh morphing (deforming volumes, pseudosolids, radial basis functions).
The selection of the parametrization approach depends mainly on the size of the problem: the CAD approach is preferred for small-to-medium sized models whilst the mesh morphing approach is the best (and sometimes the only feasible one) for large and very large models.
The multi-objective Pareto optimization (NSGA II) could be utilized as a powerful approach for shape optimization. In this regard, the Pareto optimization approach displays useful advantages in design method such as the effect of area constraint that other multi-objective optimization cannot declare it. The approach of using a penalty function is an effective technique which could be used in the first stage of optimization. In this method the constrained shape design problem is adapted to an unconstrained problem with utilizing the constraints in the objective function as a penalty factor. Most of the time penalty factor is dependent to the amount of constraint variation rather than constraint number. The GA real-coded technique is applied in the present optimization problem. Therefore, the calculations are based on real value of variables.

<text>Hillbilly Hare is a 1950 Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon directed by Robert McKimson. The short was released on August 12, 1950 and stars Bugs Bunny.

==Plot==

Bugs Bunny is vacationing in the Ozarks and stumbles into the territory of two hillbilly brothers, Curt and Punkinhead Martin. The brothers mistake Bugs as being a member of The Coy Clan with whom they are feuding and make several attempts to shoot him. Bugs foils them each time. Curt and Punkinhead are determined to get revenge on Bugs for their humiliation; Bugs easily outsmarts them and eventually, dressed as an attractive hillbilly girl, tricks them into doing a square dance. The dance tune starts as a straightforward version of &quot;Skip to My Lou&quot; played and called by the jukebox band, &quot;The Sow Belly Trio&quot;. Shortly after, Bugs removes the dress, dons a hillbilly hat, deliberately unplugs the jukebox and seamlessly takes over fiddling and calling the square dance. He continues to follow the beat and rhythm of the song while manipulating the Martins through a series of slapstick comedy gags. Bugs proceeds to assign the Martins increasingly bizarre and violent directives, which the brothers unquestioningly follow with hilarious results. Finally, with the Martins having promenaded off a cliff, Bugs finishes the dance by having the Martins groggily bow to each other (before collapsing due to exhaustion from the whole &quot;dance&quot;) and saying, &quot;And THAT is all!&quot; and playing six final notes on the fiddle before the cartoon ends.

== Voice cast ==
*Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Curt Martin
*John T. Smith as Punkinhead Martin, Sow Belly Trio Caller

== Censorship ==
* This cartoon saw major editing when aired on ABC due to violent content. The following scenes were edited out:
** The scene where Bugs mistakes Curt&#x27;s gun for a camera and has his carrot shot full of holes;
** The scene where Curt unties his rifle barrel, gets blasted in the face;
** The scene where Bugs meets up with Punkinhead and Bugs reverses the gun barrel so that the second hillbilly is blown up;
** The aftermath of the explosion in the dynamite shack sequence where Curt comes out with Bugs&#x27; lit lighter and says, &quot;I think y&#x27;all are usin&#x27; too strong a fluid!&quot;;
** The line during the square-dance ending that goes: &quot;Grab a fence post, hold it tight/Whomp yer partner wit&#x27; all yer might/Hit &#x27;im in the shin, hit &#x27;im in the head/Hit &#x27;im again, the critter ain&#x27;t dead/Whomp &#x27;im low an&#x27; Whomp &#x27;im high/Stick yer finger in his eye/Pretty li&#x27;l rhythm, pretty li&#x27;l sound/Bang yer head against the ground&quot; (and the ensuing comic violence that follows).

Despite the cartoon being a product of its time in regard to broadcast violence, it is occasionally shown, wholly unedited and without any disclaimer, on MeTV&#x27;s &quot;Toon in with Me&quot; and on MeTV Toons&#x27; various scheduled cartoon matinée shows.

==Appearance in pop culture==
The hillbillies in &quot;Hillbilly Hare&quot; have appeared in the DC &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; comic book series and had a cameo along with Bugs in the &quot;Histeria!&quot; episode &quot;Great Heroes of France&quot;. They also make a brief cameo in &quot;Space Jam&quot; (they are briefly seen with the other &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters watching the basketball game between the Tune Squad and the Monstars). They are also part of the characters in the television series &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;.

==Reception==
Animation historian Mike Mallory writes, &quot;With &quot;Hillbilly Hare&quot;, director Robert McKimson, story man Tedd Pierce, and composer Carl Stalling combined to create a comedic perfect storm: the picture without the soundtrack is funny; the soundtrack without the picture is funny; and the music by itself is funny...What elevates &quot;Hillbilly Hare&quot; to the top rank of Looney Tunes cartoons is its second half: a relentless, hilariously insane square dance called by Bugs (channeling the Western swing musician Bob Wills). The rabbit&#x27;s instructions are religiously carried out by the hillbillies, who bludgeon each other senseless in the process. This three-minute crescendo of slapstick is one of the greatest sustained pieces of comedy ever drawn.&quot;
The gag of Bugs Bunny refixing his opponent&#x27;s gun so it will literally backfire is seen in &quot;Pre-Hysterical Hare&quot; (1958).

Months after the short&#x27;s release, a letter from Warren, Pennsylvania was sent to the studio, requesting for Bugs&#x27; square dancing calls that were used during the film&#x27;s climax. McKimson also considered putting the short up for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film; however, producer Edward Selzer refused to submit it for consideration.

==Home media==
* &quot;Hillbilly Hare&quot; is available (uncensored and uncut) on &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 3&quot;, Disc 1.
* A shortened version featuring just the square dance is available on WB Kids&#x27; channel on YouTube.

<doc id="1271423" wikidata="Q2577338" url="?curid=1271423" title="Ribat-i Sharaf">
<text>Ribat-i Sharaf ( or ) is a historical caravanserai, or rest place for travellers, located in Razavi Khorasan province, Iran, between Merv and Nishapur. Built in the 12th century (first built 1114–15), the building looks like a fortified rectangle from the exterior. The internal courtyard and four-iwan floor plan is a traditional characteristic of Iranian architecture and of Islamic architecture in the wider region.

== Historical background ==
In a desert area along the route between the cities of Marv and Nishapur lies the &quot;Ribat-i Sharaf&quot;, named after Sharaf al-Din ibn Tahir or Sharaf al-Din Qummi who is believed to be its patron. Sharaf al-Din served as the governor of Khorasan for forty years and as a vizier during the reign of Sultan Sanjar (1118–1157). Not long after its construction, the building suffered destruction at the hands of Bedouins. However, it was soon, in 1154 restored and remodeled by Turkan Khatun, the daughter of the Khan and the wife of Sultan Sanjar. 

== Architecture ==

The ribat preserves significant decorative elements and exquisite inscriptions that reflect the artistic characteristics of the period. It stands as an exceptional example of caravanserais and ribats from that era.

The ribat consists of two sections within a single architectural framework. The entrance is located on the southeast side through a &quot;pishtaq&quot;, leading to a long &quot;iwan&quot; that opens onto an open rectangular courtyard. Along the same axial alignment, a corridor connects this courtyard to another open space, this time square-shaped. Continuing along this straight path leads to the second section of the ribat, culminating in another &quot;iwan&quot; and a dome. This axial line, beginning from the &quot;pishtaq&quot; at the façade and ending at the dome, divides the ribat into two nearly symmetrical halves.

The first section of the building, which includes the rectangular courtyard, is surrounded on three sides: the southeast side housing the main entrance, the northeast aisle, and the southwest aisle. These three aisle are covered, with each featuring a central &quot;iwan&quot;. The northeast and southwest &quot;iwans&quot; share identical architectural compositions, each topped with a shallow dome. The main entrance &quot;iwan&quot;, however, is distinguished by the &quot;pishtaq&quot; at the entrance. The remaining covered areas, excluding the &quot;iwans&quot;, comprise small rooms intended for travelers and merchants. This section was primarily designated for visitors and itinerant merchants traveling along the Silk Road and the trade route on which this caravanserai is situated.

<doc id="1271425" wikidata="Q2305827" url="?curid=1271425" title="Home for Christmas (NSYNC album)">
<text>Home for Christmas is the first Christmas album and second studio album by American boy band NSYNC. The album was released, exclusively in the United States, on November 10, 1998, by RCA Records following the success of their self-titled debut album. On October 27, 1999, &quot;Home for Christmas&quot; was certified Double Platinum by the RIAA for shipment of two million copies in the United States. &quot;Home for Christmas&quot; was released on September 30, 2002 in the United Kingdom as &quot;The Meaning of Christmas&quot; on Ariola Express with an altered track listing.

&quot;Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays&quot; was released as a single in the United States, and in Germany as well, due to its inclusion on the group&#x27;s German seasonal album, &quot;The Winter Album&quot;. As of December 2014, &quot;Home for Christmas&quot; has sold 2.8 million copies in the United States, making it the fifteenth best-selling Christmas/holiday album in the U.S. since Nielsen SoundScan started tracking music sales in 1991.

== Critical reception ==
During its time of release in 1998, &quot;Home for Christmas&quot; was met with lukewarm to negative reviews from critics who derided the song lyrics as “sentimental-sounding non sequiturs” and contended the group did not have the same charisma of fellow pop groups like the Backstreet Boys or the Spice Girls. At Rate Your Music, a website where users submit reviews, &quot;Home for Christmas&quot; was given a very low rating: 1.43 out of 5. However, critics also praised the album for having eleven original tracks, as well as for its “slickly produced adult contemporary ballads and lite dance-pop”.

In the years since, the album has been commended for the strength of its five-part harmonies, displayed in songs like the group’s a capella of “O Holy Night.” It is also known as a rare NSYNC album that gives Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone, and Lance Bass vocal opportunities to shine.

<doc id="1271430" wikidata="Q4993686" url="?curid=1271430" title="EB Games">
<text>EB Games (formerly known as Electronics Boutique, EBX, and EB World) was an American computer and video games retailer. First established as an American company in 1977 by James Kim with a single electronics-focused location in the King of Prussia mall near Philadelphia, the company later grew into an international corporation. EB Games&#x27;s parent company, GameStop, has its headquarters in Grapevine, Texas, a suburb of Dallas. When Electronics Boutique was an independent company, its headquarters was in West Goshen Township, Pennsylvania, near West Chester.

The EB Games brand is defunct in the United States &amp; Canada but still operates in Australia and New Zealand. GameStop also operates certain stores under the &quot;EBX&quot; brand.

==History==
Originally, the operation mainly sold calculators and digital watches. Between 1977 and the mid-1990s, the company expanded to (and later stopped) selling computers, software, and other related items (according to the EB Games employee handbook). Electronics Boutique also operated stores under the name Games &#x27;n Gadgets. The Games &#x27;n Gadgets stores were more centered on entertainment and gaming, rather than business and productivity. In the mid-1990s, the company&#x27;s focus switched to TV-based video games and consoles, though many stores still maintain PC game sections.

On April 3, 2000, Electronics Boutique made an offer to purchase rival business FuncoLand for $110 million, paying $17.50 in cash for each of parent company Funco&#x27;s shares. CEO Joseph Firestone remarked that his company had been &quot;stalking&quot; FuncoLand for two years, and waited until the stock price was right. On April 5, Funco received an unsolicited $135 million buyout offer from Barnes &amp; Noble subsidiary Babbage&#x27;s Etc., who offered to pay in either cash or a combination of cash and Barnes &amp; Noble stock. On April 12, Funco gave Electronics Boutique five days to raise its offer before they would accept Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s offer. In response, Electronics Boutique matched Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s offer. On April 26, Barnes &amp; Noble raised its bid to $161.5 million, or $24.75 a share, leaving Electronics Boutique with another five days to respond to the bid. On May 3, Electronics Boutique announced the withdrawal of its bid, and Funco accepted Barnes &amp; Noble&#x27;s buyout the following day. Electronic Boutique&#x27;s original definitive agreement with Funco included a breakup fee of $3.5 million, the cost of which was covered by Barnes &amp; Noble.

In May 2000, in order to unify their company, Electronics Boutique changed the vast majority of its current EB and EB Gameworld stores to the name EB Games. They also announced that they would be either closing or selling all of their EB Kids and Brandywine Sports Collectible Stores.

For years EB Games&#x27; primary distribution center was in Louisville, Kentucky, with two smaller distribution centers and a World Headquarters all located in West Chester, Pennsylvania. With video games becoming increasingly popular, EB Games decided it was time for a new distribution center. In October 2004, EB Games opened its doors to its new distribution center in Sadsbury Township, Pennsylvania. The world headquarter office in West Chester remained open, however anyone working at the old distribution centers were transferred to the new location. As of July 30, 2005, the company operated 2,280 stores in the United States, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Puerto Rico, Sweden, Austria and Spain, primarily under the names EB Games and Electronics Boutique. The company changed its corporate name to &quot;EB Games&quot; but the retailer is often still referred to as &quot;Electronics Boutique&quot;. The company had stores named Electronics Boutique, EB Games, EBGameworld, EBX, Stop-N-Save, and EB Kids.

===EB Games and GameStop merger===
On Thursday, October 6, 2005, shareholders from EB Games and GameStop agreed to a $1.44 billion takeover deal. The deal offered $38.15 in cash as well as approximately ¾ of a share of GameStop stock for every 1 share of EB Games stock. This offer was a 34.2% premium on the $41.12 per share closing price of EB Games stock. GameStop decided to close EB Games&#x27;s newly constructed distribution center in Sadsbury, PA, their call center in Las Vegas, NV, and their International Headquarters in West Chester, PA, eliminating more than 800 jobs. Only 65 former EB Games employees were offered jobs at GameStop&#x27;s headquarters in Grapevine, TX.

===International===
EB began its international expansion with the opening of three stores in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1993. The Canadian division was the largest of the international divisions with over 300 stores as of May 2008.

In 1995, the company expanded to the UK with the purchase of 25% of the financially troubled British game retailer Rhino Group. The name of the chain was changed from Future Zone to &quot;Electronics Boutique&quot; to match the new owner. John Steinbrecher, Electronic Boutique&#x27;s VP of Stores in the US and Canada, was seconded to the UK to manage the chain. Store remodels, product mix changes and used video games combined to restore the chain&#x27;s finances.

Electronics Boutique commenced operations in Australia in 1997 and rapidly became the number one video game specialty retailer in the country and the only one with a nationwide footprint.

Although the merger created a company separate from the U.S. parent, EB retained a 24% ownership stake in the merged chain for a period of time and, under the merger agreement, collected substantial management fees from it until 2004, when the companies agreed to sever the remainder of their ties with a one time settlement. The GAME brand replaced the EB name at all former EB stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The new company was the biggest video game retailer in the United Kingdom. However, GameStop is once again operating in Ireland under the GameStop brand.

On May 23, 2005, EB Games announced a definitive agreement to acquire Jump, a retailer based in Valencia, Spain that sells PCs and other consumer electronics. EB Games plans to begin introducing video game hardware and software into Jump&#x27;s 141 stores over the next several months. The acquisition provides EB Games entry into the Spanish marketplace and continues EB Games&#x27;s aggressive international expansion.

In July 2008, EB Games announced an agreement to acquire The Gamesman, which was the largest independently owned chain of video game stores in New Zealand.

On July 28, 2021, EB Games announced that its Canadian operations would be rebranded under the GameStop name, with the rebranding expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Stores began to be converted to GameStop signage by September 2021.

<doc id="1271434" wikidata="Q7169139" url="?curid=1271434" title="Perley A. Thomas Car Works">
<text>Perley A. Thomas Car Works, Inc. was an American manufacturer of streetcars based in High Point, North Carolina. Following the liquidation of Southern Car Works, its engineer Perley A. Thomas in 1916 founded the new company named for himself. Along with the manufacture of complete streetcars, Thomas Car Works also renovated and repaired existing cars to supplement its production.

At the beginning of the Great Depression, mass transit in the United States largely transitioned in format from streetcars to automotive-based buses, leading Thomas Car Works to convert to bus production. From the mid-1930s onward, the company dedicated its production towards school buses. Following World War II, the company became one of the primary manufacturers of large school bus bodies in the United States, leading Perley A. Thomas Car Works to be renamed as Thomas Built Buses, Inc. in 1972.

As Thomas Built Buses, the company is still based in High Point, operating as a subsidiary of Freightliner Trucks (of Daimler AG) since 1998.

== History ==

=== 1910s ===
In 1910, Perley A. Thomas joined Southern Car Company in High Point, North Carolina as an engineer and designer. By 1915, the company had begun its transition from wood-bodied designs to all-steel vehicles. However, Southern Car was unable to remain competitive, leading to its closure in early 1916. Following the closure of Southern Car Company, Thomas relied on his woodworking background and the furniture industry of High Point to found his own company, producing fireplace mantles and other home furnishings.

In the summer of 1916, Thomas was contracted by Southern Public Utilities Company in Charlotte, North Carolina to enclose its fleet of streetcars. As they were Southern Car Company streetcars designed by Thomas, the utility company sought him out for the renovation. Along with a small crew of former Southern Car Company builders, Thomas performed the work in a Charlotte car barn.

One month after securing the contract in Charlotte, Perley A. Thomas Car Works was officially organized in High Point, with Thomas hiring 30 employees from the former Southern Car Company. With a $6,000 loan, Thomas acquired the equipment of his former employer at auction, opening an assembly facility in a former ice manufacturing plant in High Point. By the end of the year, four additional cars were renovated for Southern Public Utilities in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. During 1917, Thomas Car Works renovated 9 streetcars for the United States Navy in Mobile, Alabama and a group of streetcars for Montgomery, Alabama.

In 1918, Thomas Car Works would see several company milestones, commencing production of new streetcars for the first time. The factory was capable of producing wooden or steel bodies, with the latter quickly becoming the most common (Southern Car had introduced all-steel bodies in 1911). At the end of the year, a 30-acre property was secured outside of High Point; the company constructed a larger assembly facility, allowing for simultaneous construction and repair/renovation of streetcars. In total, 25 streetcars were produced in the first year of production.

=== 1920s ===

As a streetcar manufacturer, Thomas Car Works saw its greatest success during the 1920s, becoming one of the largest manufacturers of electric streetcars in the United States. In 1921, the company secured its largest-ever order of streetcars, from NOPSI (New Orleans Public Service Inc.). In total, 173 streetcars were ordered from 1921 to 1924, as NOPSI sought to standardize their fleet. The steel-bodied 800-900-series streetcars were double-ended (two sets of operating controls and two trolley poles), double-trucked, with an arched roof. Unable to fill the massive order entirely on their own, Thomas Car Works subcontracted a portion of the order to Philadelphia-based competitor J. G. Brill (using the Thomas design).

In September 1922, after the company had delivered 25 streetcars to NOPSI, the High Point factory was destroyed by fire, causing $225,000 in damage (along with 14 streetcars under construction). In response, Perley Thomas secured $100,000 from NOPSI to secure the parts to construct an order of 55 streetcars; a second order of 25 streetcars was delivered by the end of 1923. In total, NOPSI would order 173 800-900-series streetcars, with Thomas Car Works producing 98 (not including the 14 destroyed in the factory fire). The High Point factory was rebuilt to hold three tracks inside the factory; three stations on each track allowed 9 cars to be worked on simultaneously. The factory employed a 125-employee workforce, with seven complete streetcars produced each week on average.

In 1926, the Detroit United Railroad ordered 100 streetcars from Thomas Car Works; the long design was the longest streetcar ever built by the company. The sole manufacturer of the design, Thomas delivered streetcars to Detroit from 1926 to 1929.

=== 1930s ===
During the 1930s, Thomas Car Works would see several changes that would alter the company forever. Following the large order from Detroit, demand for streetcars began to decline sharply. In 1930, the company received its last order for streetcars, producing 4 for Mobile, Alabama. Subsequently, all production would transition away from rail to road-based vehicles. During 1931 and 1932, no vehicles were produced, shifting to repairs, streetcar renovations, and automotive refinishing. In 1933, the company produced its first trolley coach (an electric bus with a pair of trolley poles).

In mass transit, by the 1930s, rail-based streetcars were losing ground to automotive-based buses; the latter were not dependent on the power grid for their operation (and ownership), and buses offered more flexibility in routing. In 1934, Thomas built its first transit bus for Duke Power (the successor to the first Thomas customer).

In 1936, Thomas Car Works entered a bid to produce school bus bodies for the state of North Carolina. While required to produce 500 bodies, the company was only able to secure the materials for 200; North Carolina would split the bid between Thomas and Hackney Brothers. After five months of production, the bid was completed at a profit. For 1937, Thomas returned to bid for North Carolina school bus production, commencing a tradition that remains to this day.

=== Post World War II ===

In 1940, Perley A. Thomas retired (at age 65), remaining as president and design consultant. During World War II, Thomas Car Works was active in war production, shifting from buses to bodies for the GMC CCKW 2½-ton 6x6 truck. As an additional means of revenue, the company renovated and repaired its former streetcars. Although streetcars had largely fallen out of favor, the suspension of domestic vehicle production was also applied towards transit vehicles as well as private automobiles; some cities had retained the networks for the operation of streetcars into the 1940s.

After World War II, Thomas Car Works returned to vehicle production, concentrating nearly entirely on school buses. In 1957, Thomas Car Works introduced the &quot;Saf-T-Liner&quot; trade name for the first time.

In 1958, Perley Thomas died at the age of 84; until his death, he would remain a design consultant in his retirement.

In 1972, as a third generation of the Thomas family assumed leadership, Perley A. Thomas Car Works was reorganized as Thomas Built Buses, Inc. Adopting a brand name in use by Thomas since the 1950s, the change was explained as bringing the company closer to its core product line of buses, 42 years after producing its final streetcar.

== Operators ==

In total, over 400 newly built streetcars were assembled by Perley A. Thomas Car Works from 1918 to 1930.

During streetcar production, Thomas produced streetcars for the following cities:

* Philadelphia, PA
* Washington, D.C.
* New York, NY
* Chicago, IL
* New Orleans, LA (see below)
* Charlotte, NC
* Greenville, NC
* High Point, NC
* Mobile, AL
* Sheffield, AL
* Detroit, MI
* Miami, FL
* Augusta, GA
* Knoxville, TN
* San Juan, Puerto Rico
* Havana, Cuba
=== Usage in New Orleans ===

As of 2019, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority operates 35 Perley Thomas 900-series streetcars in active daily use, nearly a century after their construction. Dating from 1923 and 1924, the Thomas streetcars are operated on the St. Charles line (the oldest continuously operating streetcar line in the world). In 2005, all 35 Thomas streetcars survived Hurricane Katrina unharmed, while 30 of the 31 replica streetcars required restoration, placing them out of service through 2009. The Thomas cars are painted the traditional olive green color. Most of the replica cars are bright red, although a few have been painted olive green to provide ADA-compliant service on the St. Charles line.

To keep the Thomas streetcars in service, the RTA established a parts shop with the capability of building a complete replica of the Thomas streetcar design on its own to maintain a stock of replacement parts. The shop designed and produced the replica cars used on the Canal Street Line and the Riverfront Line. Along with the difference in color, the newer designs are ADA-compliant, and the Canal Street cars are air-conditioned.

== Preservation ==
Outside of their active usage in New Orleans, four Thomas streetcars (all from New Orleans) have been preserved by railway museums across the United States. Two additional streetcars are undergoing renovations for use as heritage streetcars in San Francisco. Two other cars, #919 and #924, retired from the Riverfront line, are owned by New Orleans RTA, but are currently inoperable.

Examples include:

* Connecticut Trolley Museum (NOPSI Car #836)
* Seashore Trolley Museum (NOPSI Car #966)
* Pennsylvania Trolley Museum (NOPSI #832)
* Shore Line Trolley Museum (NOPSI #850)

NOPSI Cars #913 and #952 are under the operation of San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni). Both built in 1923, 952 is leased to Muni from New Orleans RTA since 1998; 913 was purchased from Orange Empire Railway Museum in 2005. As of 2019, both cars are in the process of restoration; 913 has not seen active service since 1964 and funds are being raised for its restoration.

Hagerstown and Frederick Railway Suburban Coach 150 is preserved inside the Myersville Public Library in Myersville, MD. 150 was built in 1918 for the Columbia Street Railway in South Carolina. H&amp;F acquired 150 (along with three other Thomas cars) in 1923 for service out of Hagerstown to Boonsboro and Funkstown. In 1938, service to Boonsboro and Funkstown ended and the 150 was sold for scrap value. 150 was discovered as part of a home near Gambrill State Park and was purchased by Donald Easterday in 1990. Mr. Easterday moved the car to his property outside Myersville where it was restored and displayed for Myersville&#x27;s Trolley Days. Following Easterday&#x27;s passing in 2016, the car was donated to the town of Myersville. In 2019, 150 found its new permanent home inside the brand new public library.

== In popular culture ==
A famous Tennessee Williams play (and later, film) was set in New Orleans, Louisiana where Perley A. Thomas streetcars were operated on the Desire line around the period of 1947 in which the story was set, hence the name: &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

<text>İnce Minareli Medrese (; ) is a 13th-century madrasa (Islamic school) located in Konya, Turkey, now housing the Museum of Stone and Wood Art (Taş ve Ahşap Eserler Müzesi), noted for its ornate entrance, domed courtyard, ornamentally bricked minaret, partially destroyed in 1901, and exemplar Anatolian Seljuk architecture.

==History==
The Ince Minaret Medrese was commissioned in 1265 by the Seljuk vizier Ṣāḥib &#x27;Aṭā Fakhr al-Dīn &#x27;Alī, who was one of was one of two major patrons of architecture in Konya in the decades after the city&#x27;s recapture from the Mongols. Upon his death in 1285, he was buried in his &quot;mosque complex&quot; within the city.

== Architecture ==
=== Complex Layout ===
The Ince Minaret Medrese is built close to the old center of Seljuk rule, at the foot of the citadel hill in Konya. The complex of the medrese is approximately 23.60 meters by 20.30 meters, or about 77.4 feet by 66.6 feet. In the center of the rectangular complex is a dome-covered courtyard which is surrounded by the rooms of the medrese, or Islamic religious school, on the north, south and west sides. The student rooms are located on the north and south sides of the centrally-placed dome and the medrese&#x27;s classrooms are located on the west side. On the east side of the courtyard is a single-domed mosque with the minaret with two balconies, or şerefes in Turkish, on the south-eastern corner. The courtyard includes a single iwan facing the entrance, or a courtyard space with barrel-vaulted halls and rectangular and square side chambers, which emulates an ancient Persian rectangular space layout that became a standard type during the era of Seljuk Anatolia.

Typical of medieval Islamic architecture, the integration of the mosque into the medrese&#x27;s architectural plan is evidence of the complex&#x27;s multitude of purposes as a religious place of worship and of teaching. The exterior of the complex is made of cut stone, the outer side walls are made of rubble and stone, and the interior uses brick for structural and ornamental purposes. The use of brick decoration was a common feature of Seljuk buildings due to its connections to traditional Anatolian brick architecture.

=== Portal and Facade ===
The portal of the building is surrounded by highly ornamented stonework which stretches up the entire facade. While other contemporary Seljuk constructions made use of muqarnas hoods above the entry, the Ince Minaret Medrese instead includes large stone banners of text. Sura 36 and Sura 110 are inscribed in prominent vertical bands of thuluth calligraphy that intertwine and separate just above the doorway. Geometric and vegetal designs likewise adorn the facade, taking the form of knots, branches, and leaves. Apart from displaying the stonework and script, the facade also conceals the layout of the interior spaces behind it. Within two rosettes framing the portal are inscriptions attesting to the building&#x27;s architect, Kölük bin Abdullah, who also designed the Gök Medrese in Sivas as well as the nearby Sahip Ata Complex in Konya. Abdullah is hypothesized to have worked on a number of Ṣāḥib &#x27;Aṭā Fakhr al-Dīn&#x27;s commissions.

=== Dome ===
At the center of the courtyard is the centrally-planned, covered dome. Although central plans were common in late Seljuk architecture, the Ince Minaret Medrese diverged from previous centrally-planned courtyards with the addition of the covered dome space. The large central dome emulates pre-Seljuk Anatolian architecture, specifically earlier mosque plans and the standard Anatolian Byzantine church style.

The dome itself receives light by means of a lantern, which illuminates the covered courtyard space. It is supported by four triangular fan pendentives made of exposed brickwork. The side chambers of the dome are not decorated at all, which increases the striking aesthetic properties of the central space. The interior of the dome is covered in alternating turquoise and black tiles in geometric patterns that bear an inscription in kufic script.
=== Minaret ===
The Ince Minaret Medrese&#x27;s name refers to the structure&#x27;s original extremely tall minaret, which once possessed two balconies. In 1901, however, the minaret was partially destroyed by a lightning strike. The lightning strike caused the minaret to fall on the complex&#x27;s mosque, which destroyed its dome and resulted in subsequent repairs using concrete and glass. The minaret is located near the gateway of the dome. The base of the minaret is square shaped and built out of brick. As the base goes upward, the square shape gives way to a cylindrical form. Glazed bricks are strategically placed a slight distance apart in a cylindrical geometric pattern, generating an illusion of free-hanging materials. In addition, green tiles as well as geometric motifs decorate the outer portion of the minaret, creating a distinct Seljuk style of architecture and artwork. It was common practice for Seljuk buildings to be lined in glazed brick and ornamented with a decorative style.

<text>Nina Grieg, née Hagerup (24 November 1845 – 9 December 1935) was a Danish–Norwegian lyric soprano.

==Early life and family==
Nina Hagerup was born in Bergen, Norway. Her parents were the malt inspector Herman Didrik Hagerup and the actress Luise Adeline Werligh, née Falck. She was the first cousin of composer Edvard Grieg, whom she married in 1867.

==Career==
The couple often performed concerts together in Europe; on 6 December 1897, they performed some of his music at a private concert at Windsor Castle for Queen Victoria and her court. Her husband Edvard considered her the best performer of his songs, and her performances usually received rave reviews. However, one of Victoria&#x27;s courtiers called her singing &quot;passée&quot;.

She was featured as a soloist in Felix Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; with &quot;Musikselskabet Harmonien&quot; (later known as the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra) in 1866.

The English composer Frederick Delius dedicated two sets of songs to her in the years 1888–1890.

Nina Grieg never recorded professionally, but two amateur recordings made on wax cylinders have been preserved (in quite poor condition) and have been issued on the Simax label.

==Personal life and death==
She married her first cousin, Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg, on 11 June 1867, in Copenhagen, Denmark. They were Unitarians.

After his death in 1907, she moved to Denmark. In Copenhagen, she attended a Unitarian church. She died in 1935 at the age of 90. She was cremated and her ashes were placed with her husband&#x27;s ashes in a mountain tomb near Troldhaugen, outside Bergen, where the couple had shared a home for most of their married years.

<text>Estrées is a commune in the Aisne department in Hauts-de-France in northern France.

In the Picard dialect, it is called &quot;Etré&quot;. It is one of many villages in the north of France bearing the name &quot;Estrées&quot;. The etymology of the name is from &quot;strata&quot; (cognate of English &quot;street&quot;), the word for the stone-layered Roman roads in the area (some of which turned into modern highways). Hence &quot;Estreti&quot;, &quot;village on the road&quot; which developed into &quot;Estrées&quot;.

Also known in ancient times as &quot;Strata&quot; or &quot;Estreti&quot;, history mentions an abbey in the 12th century. A parish was created there about 1189 with a priest sent from the abbey of Mont Saint Martin to buy land and help the poor. In 1777 Pierre Nicolas Leroy began manufacturing silk gauze here. Inhabitants are called Estrésiens.

<doc id="1271445" wikidata="Q4935932" url="?curid=1271445" title="Bobrinski Bucket">
<text>The Bobrinski Bucket, also called the Bobrinski Kettle or Bobrinski Cauldron (also spelled Bobrinsky), is a bronze bucket produced in Herat, present-day Afghanistan in 1163 C.E. (during the month Muharram in 559 A.H). The bucket’s height is a mere 18.5 cm and consists of a rounded body with a rim and heightened base, and a handle in the shape of real and mythological creatures. The bucket is cast in bronze, with copper and silver inlaid decorations and inscriptions throughout the bucket’s handle, rim, and body. The body of the bucket features seven horizontal bands of inlaid decorations, including the rim, consisting of inscription and iconography. Discussion of the purpose of the bucket has sparked speculation among scholars of Islamic Art.

The bucket is named after its former owner, Count Aleksei Bobrinsky (1852–1927) and now resides in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The bucket is one the of most famous and earliest pieces of Persian metalwork associated with Herat in the late 12th century and is one of the earliest examples of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic scripts.

== Production ==
The Bobrinski Bucket is a prominent example of the inlay technique developed in twelfth century Herat. The bucket’s inlaid calligraphy was created using silver and copper wire that was laid down in shallow recesses in the bronze body and hammered down until the wire was firmly inlaid. Similarly, for the spatial inlays, used in larger areas such as the human heads or bodies of animals, a silver or copper sheet was laid over an area where only the edges were trimmed back, and hammered until held well in place. The copper and silver inlays create a multicolored, polychromatic surface for the bucket.  

The division of labor between the caster and decorator of the bucket follows a trend commonly observed in Persian art of the time. Allocating the designing of different elements of the metalwork to multiple people allowed artists to apply their designs to a variety of different objects, rather than only being able to create one object. This, along with the choice to use Persian and Arabic for the inscription solidifies the Bobrinski Bucket as an early and important work showcasing Herat as an important hub of production and craftsmanship, and highlights the emergence of Persian art during this period.

== Inscription ==
The bucket features three bands of calligraphy. The first band of calligraphy is in an anthropomorphic script, meaning that the letters have human features. The second band is an interlaced Kufic script with a geometric pattern. The third band consists of anthropomorphic script with the tails of the letters interlaced with running animals. Such anthropomorphic and zoomorphic scripts are commonly found in works from the twelfth century. These bands of inscription along the bucket’s body are written in Arabic. The text consists of well wishes for the owner of the bucket, as is typical for portable Islamic metalwork.

The rim of the bucket is inscribed in Persian. The inscription lists the bucket’s caster, Muhammed ibn ‘Abd al-Wāhid, and the person who applied the decorative elements to the bucket, Mas’ūd ibn Ahmad. It also describes the person who ordered the bucket, ‘Abd al Rahmān ibn ‘Abdallāh al-Rashīdi, and the person who the bucket was made for, who the inscription refers to as “the eminent hajji Rukn ad-din, the glorious of merchants, the Muslims trusted man, an ornament to the hajj and both holy places Rashid ad-Din Azizi ibn al-Husayn az-Zanjani, may his fame endure”.

A Kufic inscription on the top of the handle reveals the month and year the bucket was completed.

== Iconography ==
From the top down, starting with the handle and ending at the bottommost band, the Bobrinski bucket is filled with iconography.

# At the top of the Bobrinski bucket’s handle are lions heads; four heads make a square on either side that connects at the very center of the handle. Connecting the handles to the rest of the bucket are hares extending towards the lions, and dragons paralleling them, also extending towards the lions.
# Directly below the handle are pairs of ducks, one facing the other, all the way around the rim.
# The uppermost band displays anthropomorphic script with human torsos and heads on the upward strokes. Separating the text four times throughout the band are suns with twenty-eight alternating black and white rays. Inside the suns is a human figure, sitting on a throne, with two dragon-like staffs.
# The second band, directly below, shows people sitting or standing doing a variety of activities. Some activities include drinking, feasting, dancing, or playing games.
# Below the third band, which exclusively displays Kufic script, is the fourth band, which displays males figures, who are mostly on horseback that are hunting and fighting. In one part of the band, several men are fighting a dragon.
# The penultimate band features anthropomorphic script, similar to the first band. Instead of human torsos and heads, this band only includes human heads. Joining the script and heads are animals such as dogs, birds, antelope, and hares weaving throughout the words like they are in a forest.
# Finally, the bottommost band on the bucket depicts the same animals as the previous band chasing each other along with geometric-like columns.

The images on the bucket are associated with the ideal kingship but due to their lack of visual hierarchy are actually thought to be stock images. While most of the images are stock scenes, the meaning behind the sun in the uppermost band has been discussed. According to Willy Hartner the sun’s twenty-eight rays may be a coincidence, a reference to the draconian calendar (which has twenty-seven and some months), or the twenty-eight lunar mansions.

== Purpose ==
There is much scholarly debate about the purpose and uses of the bucket. Early scholars such as Richard Ettinghausen and Ralph Harari have hypothesized that the bucket was used as a water bucket, as it exhibits similarities to one exhibited in a fifteenth century painting of a bathhouse. The bucket’s bail handle could have been helpful in a bathhouse setting. The historian Nikolay Veselovsky had asserted that the bucket was a vessel for carrying food; However, the bucket lacks tinning on the interior that would have prevented corrosion from food. Souren Melikian and Robert Hillenbrand have connected the bucket to the Hajj, suggesting that it was either a Pilgrimage accessory or marked the completion of the Hajj, based on the references to this in the bucket’s inscriptions. Others have concluded that the bucket was a gift. Ruba Kana’an’s interpretation of the bucket’s purpose is most widely accepted in present day scholarship of the Bobrinski Bucket. Kana‘an uses her extensive study of the legal writings of Muslim jurists to better understand the production and patronage of Islamic metalware. She concludes that the bucket was produced as a showpiece of new designs and images that was presented as a gift to the workshop owner.

<text>LeBaron Russell Briggs (December 11, 1855 – April 24, 1934) was an American educator. He was appointed the first dean of men at Harvard College, and subsequently served as dean of the faculty until he retired. He was concurrently president of Radcliffe College and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.

==Early life==
Briggs was born in Salem, Massachusetts on December 11, 1855. He was the son of Unitarian minister George Ware Briggs and Lucia Jane (née Russell) Briggs. Among his siblings was brother George Russell Briggs.

He received A.B. (in 1875) and A.M. degrees (in 1882) from Harvard University.

==Career==
After graduating from Harvard, he began teaching there; he began as a Greek tutor before moving to English, eventually becoming the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric from 1904 until 1925.

Briggs was appointed dean of Harvard College in 1891 (to 1902) and dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences from 1902 until his retirement in 1925. His appointment as dean of men was the first &quot;student personnel&quot; appointment, which later became the catalyst for the Student Affairs field in higher education. Briggs was responsible for advising students academically, and on personal issues. &quot;His fairness in dealing with the Faculty and students alike, his patience in dealing with erring undergraduates, and his always kindly humor endeared him to everyone,&quot; wrote George Henry Chase.

===Radcliffe College===
In 1903, Briggs succeeded co-founder Elizabeth Cary Agassiz as the second president of Radcliffe College, which had been founded as the Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women in 1882 before becoming Radcliffe College in 1894. During his presidency (which was then a part-time position), the college purchased the Greenleaf estate and built five new dormitories. Also during his tenure, the student body grew from less than 500 in 1903 to more than 700 in 1923. The geographical diversity of students also increased, with the number of students matriculating from outside of Massachusetts rising from 19 percent in 1903 to 33 percent in 1923.

He served as president for twenty years until 1923, when he was succeeded by Ada Louise Comstock who also served as president for twenty years from 1923 to 1943. Before Briggs left office, the administration of Radcliffe requested that Radcliffe become a college for women within Harvard, but were again refused. In his last presidential report, Briggs wrote: “I believe that ultimately Radcliffe will become a women’s college in Harvard, but that neither institution is as yet prepared for such a union.”

After his retirement from Radcliffe, he wrote the novel, &quot;Men, Women And Colleges&quot;, which was published in 1925 by the Houghton Mifflin Company.

==Personal life==
In 1883, Briggs was married to Mary Frances De Quedville (b. 1862) of Cambridge. Together, they were the parents of three children:

* John DeQuedville Briggs (1885–1965), who married Marjorie Scott Winslow (1900–1994), daughter of William Herman Winslow, in 1925.
* Lucia Russell Briggs (1887–1960), who served as president of Milwaukee-Downer College for thirty years.
* LeBaron Russell Briggs Jr. (1895–1972), who married Elizabeth Mason.

Briggs died on April 24, 1934, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the home of his daughter Lucia. He was buried at Oak Grove Cemetery in Plymouth, Massachusetts, where he had a summer home.

===Legacy===
Briggs was also a trustee of Middlesex School, where the LeBaron Briggs House dormitory is named for him, as is Briggs Hall at Harvard&#x27;s Cabot House. He received honorary degrees from Harvard, Yale, Western Reserve University and Lafayette University.

His nautical namesake, the liberty ship &quot;LeBaron Russell Briggs&quot;, was scuttled with its cargo of nerve gas on August 18, 1970, as the last installment of a project in which the United States disposed of much of its stockpile by dumping it at sea.

<text>Edward J. Cahill, S.J. (18 February 1868–16 July 1941) was an Irish Jesuit priest and academic, born in Ballyvocogue, Cappagh, County Limerick. He was educated in Theology at Maynooth, and ordained a priest in 1897. He served on the staff of Mungret College and in the years before the Easter Rising he was known for facilitating Irish Volunteers in their training in Mungret. In 1924, he joined the staff of the Jesuit Milltown Park Institute in Dublin as Professor of Church History, Lecturer in Sociology, and later, Spiritual Father.

In October 1926, on the occasion of the first celebration of the Feast of Christ the King, he founded &quot;An Ríoghacht&quot;, the League of the Kingship of Christ. The object of this society was to ensure the use of Catholic Social Teaching in the Irish Free State. &quot;An Ríoghacht&quot;, under Fr. Cahill&#x27;s guidance, organised public meetings three or four times a year, published pamphlets on current topics and even attempted to produce a weekly paper to further its ideals. This organisation would go on to form the basis of Fr. Denis Fahey&#x27;s Maria Duce.

Cahill&#x27;s anti-mason message, delivered in the 1920s and 1930s, also served as an analysis and apologetic against Talmudic Judaism. In his works he cites papal teaching which describes the Masons as enemies of the Catholic Church, and gives evidence that these same Masons are influenced and given guidance by Jews: 
He was a regular contributor the &quot;Irish Ecclesiastical Record&quot; and the &quot;Irish Monthly&quot;. His works often stressed the link between Catholicism and nationalism.

He died on 16 July 1941, aged 73, after a long illness.

<doc id="1271458" wikidata="Q847386" url="?curid=1271458" title="Noriyuki Makihara">
<text>, nicknamed by his fans, is a Japanese pop singer-songwriter. He has sold a total of 21 million copies in Japan alone.

== Biography ==
Makihara was born on 18 May 1969 in Takatsuki, Osaka, Japan. He attended Aoyama Gakuin University to study English literature. In addition to creating songs for his own music career, he has written, produced and performed songs for many other artists, the most notable being SMAP&#x27;s &quot;Sekai ni Hitotsu Dake no Hana&quot;. He is ranked at No.84, in a list of Japan&#x27;s top 100 musicians, provided by HMV.He was also invited to write the song &quot;The Gift&quot; for English band blue in their album &quot;Guilty&quot;.

Makihara made his debut to the J-Pop scene in the early &#x27;90s after performing on a televised song competition program. He made a name for himself with the release of songs such as &quot;Mou Koi Nante Shinai&quot; () and &quot;Donna Toki mo.&quot; (), both of which, among several others, are covered to this day by current popular artists (including English-language covers by various American artists). Some of his music has been translated into other languages, and &quot;Donna Toki mo&quot;, specifically has been remixed by Bemani artists &quot;Dream Line Out&quot; for use on Konami&#x27;s Beatmania game series.

Much of his music&#x27;s lyrical content has revolved around the subject of romantic love, though themes of profound joy, reminiscence, gratitude and deeper spiritual aspects of the human condition have become predominant in recent years.

In 1999, he was given a suspended 18-months prison sentence for possession of amphetamines.

In 2003 he became famous for composing &quot; Sekai ni Hitotsu Dake no Hana&quot;&quot; (世界に一つだけの花, &quot;The One and Only Flower in the World&quot;) which was recorded by Japanese boy band SMAP and sold double millions.

On 13 February 2020, Makihara was arrested for alleged illegal stimulant possession, as police found 0.083 gram of stimulant at his condominium in Tokyo&#x27;s Minato Ward in April 2018. On 2 August 2020, Makihara was sentenced to 2 years in prison, suspended for 3 years by the Tokyo District Court.

<doc id="1271461" wikidata="Q2153912" url="?curid=1271461" title="Greatest Hits Vol. 1 (Korn album)">
<text>Greatest Hits Vol. 1 is a compilation album released by American nu metal band Korn in October 2004. The album features select tracks from their first six studio albums presented in reverse chronological order. There are two previously unreleased songs on the compilation: a cover of Cameo&#x27;s &quot;Word Up!&quot; and a compilation of all three parts of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Another Brick in the Wall&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;. These were the final songs recorded with their full original lineup, as guitarist Brian Welch left the band shortly after the album&#x27;s release in February the following year, until his return in 2013, by which time drummer David Silveria had departed permanently.

&quot;Greatest Hits Vol. 1&quot; debuted and peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, achieving a Platinum certification by the RIAA. For unspecified reasons Korn left off three of their hits, &quot;Thoughtless&quot;, &quot;No Place to Hide&quot; and &quot;Good God&quot; but included songs &quot;Trash&quot; and &quot;Twist&quot; on the album, though neither were released as singles. The version of &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; on this album features an extended intro. Because of this, the back cover lists the length of the track as being 4:15 (the length of the album version on &quot;Follow the Leader&quot;), when the length of the version on this album is 4:27.

<text>Game Retail Limited (doing business as GAME) is a British video game retailer, owned by Frasers Group since June 2019.

The company&#x27;s origins lie in the founding of the Rhino Group by Terry Norris and Bev Ripley in 1992. A number of mergers and acquisitions followed during the 1990s, and in 1999, the company was purchased by Electronics Boutique Limited, which rebranded itself as The Game Group. The company continued to expand during the 2000s, purchasing several retailers including Gameswizards in Australia. In 2007, its parent company purchased its rival store, Gamestation.

In March 2012, several suppliers, including publishers Nintendo, Electronic Arts and Capcom refused to supply their latest products due to concerns over Game&#x27;s creditworthiness. Game subsequently entered administration on 26 March 2012, and was purchased by OpCapita the following week. Baker Acquisitions was subsequently renamed Game Retail. The company reported a £10.4 million loss for the 12-month period from July 2016 to July 2017 in its full year results. In the corresponding 2015–2016 period, the company had a net profit of £7.1 million.

In June 2019, Game agreed to a takeover of the company by Frasers Group for £52 million. The group have since closed down most of the standalone Game outlets, reopening these as concessions inside nearby House of Fraser, Sports Direct, Brand Max and Lillywhites stores, as well as expanding Game&#x27;s online business.

In January 2024, the retailer announced it would phase out trade-ins and pre-owned games by February. Of its 363 stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 64 are standalone.

In June 2024, the retailer announced it would be ending its reward point scheme in July 2024.

==History==

===Formation===
The company that went on to become Game was founded by Bev Ripley and Terry Norris as Rhino Group in 1992, with stores branded as Future Zone. A year earlier in 1990, a separate company, called Game, was founded by Peter Wickins and Neil Taylor. Rhino Group acquired Virgin Games Stores from W H Smith in November 1993, increasing the total number of stores to 77.

In October 1995, the gaming retailer Electronics Boutique acquired 25% of the Rhino Group, the name of which was changed to &quot;Electronics Boutique Limited&quot; under license from the business in America, and John Steinbrecher was sent from the United States to manage the chain.

In November 1999, Electronics Boutique Limited purchased a chain of retail outlets known as Game, from which the current name of the company was derived, for £99 million. at the time of the takeover Game had 86 stores. In October 2001, Electronics Boutique Limited went on to purchase the BarrysWorld online gaming service, the French retailer &quot;ScoreGames&quot;, and the Spanish retailer &quot;Centro Mail&quot;.


In 2002, Electronics Boutique stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland were rebranded as Game, and the company name was changed to The Game Group. Despite the name change, a 1% sales royalty to Electronics Boutique in the United States continued to be paid until January 2006. Attempts to have this overturned in court in February 2003 were unsuccessful.

In July 2004, the Game group acquired Gameplay (GB) Limited, an online and mail order retailer of video games, computer software and associated products. Gameplay (GB) Ltd started trading as Game.co.uk, the group&#x27;s main online arm in the United Kingdom.

In September 2006, Game acquired Australian speciality video games retailer Gameswizards for A$3.8 million and rebranded all Gameswizards outlets as Game stores.

In May 2007, the company announced the acquisition of rival specialist video game chain Gamestation for £74 million. The company stated that they intended to retain the brand. On 21 April 2010, Lisa Morgan stepped down as CEO, to be replaced by Chris Bell as interim CEO. On 17 June 2010, it was announced that Ian Shepherd had been appointed as CEO, and took up the position on 28 June.

===Financial problems===
On 29 February 2012, it was announced that both Game and Gamestation would no longer stock new titles from Electronic Arts. This was due to the major games distributor limiting Game&#x27;s credit terms. This affected the pre-orders of &quot;Mass Effect 3&quot;, due out the following week. On 5 March 2012, it was announced that Game and Gamestation stores would not be stocking titles by Capcom. The first title affected by the move was &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;. Customers who pre-ordered the special edition from either store were refunded.

In early March 2012, Game and Gamestation began heavily discounting stock in an attempt to bring in cash ahead of administration.

On 14 March 2012, OpCapita made an unsuccessful bid for the company. The business had been in talks with Game&#x27;s lenders with the aim of buying its debt and settling its bills with suppliers in full. The offer was rejected by Game&#x27;s lenders. Microsoft and Activision ceased the supply of their products to Game on 15 March. On 19 March, the company&#x27;s shares were suspended from the London Stock Exchange at its own request.

===Administration===
The company entered administration on 26 March 2012, with PricewaterhouseCoopers appointed and Ian Shepherd stepping down as CEO. No administrator was appointed for the stores in Ireland and redundancies were only offered to staff in the United Kingdom, resulting in a continuing protest from Irish staff. 277 of Game&#x27;s 609 stores in the United Kingdom were closed immediately, resulting in 2,104 job losses.

On 31 March 2012, Game Group was purchased out of administration by OpCapita. David Hamid was announced as the new executive chairman of Game.

On 14 May 2012, TGW Pty Ltd, trading as Game Australia announced it would also enter administration. On 25 May 2012, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the administrators of Game Australia made 264 staff redundant and closed 60 stores. An expected further round of redundancies and closures was confirmed on 19 June 2012 when the administrators announced that 16 of the remaining 31 stores would close that day and the remaining 15 would close over the coming weeks, marking the end of Game Australia.

Game&#x27;s Scandinavian operations were purchased by Nordic Games (parent company of Nordic Games Publishing AB) at the end of May 2012. Nordic Games purchased 55 stores (44 in Sweden and 11 in Norway) and Game&#x27;s Scandinavian website from the retailer. Nordic and Game agreed a licensing deal that allowed the continued use of the Game brand within Sweden and Norway. In May 2015 the Swedish subsidiary went into administration. During this time Nordic decided to reshuffle the company with no effect as the Swedish subsidiary of the company went into liquidation by June 2015, as a result of this Nordic had to sell all of their stock as soon as possible at half the retail price they were originally listed as. All Swedish and Norwegian locations shut down in the summer of 2015.

==Public listing==
In May 2014, the company announced plans to relist on the London Stock Exchange. The initial public offering took place in June 2014.

In June 2019, Game Digital agreed to a takeover of the company by Frasers Group for £52 million.

==Operations==
As of 14 May 2023, Game has 240 stores in the United Kingdom. Game has also re-entered the Irish market as of December 2023, inside of a Sports Direct in Roscommon. Stores traded under the Game and Gamestation brands until the latter was replaced by Game from November 2012. Stores sell games for all major video game platforms. Games were also sold under a &#x27;preowned&#x27; label, where a customer has returned a used game for cash or credit. The company also operates a transactional website, Game.co.uk.

===Insomnia Gaming Festival===

Insomnia Gaming Festival is a large-scale gaming event ran by Game sub-brand Player1 Events, with a professional Main Stage, an Expo Hall and a large-scale LAN (Local Area Network) event which is the largest LAN in the UK. Originally this was a PC gaming only event, but in recent years has incorporated console gamers. The series of events, referred to as the ‘iSeries’ are sequentially numbered and run three times a year, typically with one around Easter, with the others usually hosted in August and November. The original events were hosted at Newbury Racecourse in the United Kingdom from i5 to i33 when the venue was relocated to Stoneleigh Park for i34. From i38 to i42 the event returned to Newbury. The home of i43 to i50 events was The Telford International Centre and from i51 to i55 it took place at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry. i56 - present day is being held at the NEC in Birmingham due to its growth and popularity. These events have evolved with professional competitive tournaments and large exhibition halls. Popular segments of the festival include main stage shows by special guests, often YouTube personalities, as well as evening entertainment such as the &quot;World Famous Insomnia Pub Quiz&quot;. Sometimes referred to as &quot;The Glastonbury of Gaming&quot;, Insomnia continues to be the biggest festival of its kind in the UK. The first Insomnia: Insomnia99 was a 300-player event. At that point, it was, and remains, the largest LAN party held in the United Kingdom. It was announced during i55 that the festival would relocate to the NEC in Birmingham in time for i56 in December 2015.

<text>Southern Fried Rabbit is a 1953 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The cartoon was released on May 2, 1953, and stars Bugs Bunny and Yosemite Sam.

==Plot==
Bugs Bunny hears of a record carrot crop in Alabama, prompting him to head South. At the Mason–Dixon line, he comes under fire from Yosemite Sam, who is wearing a Confederate uniform and claims to have orders from General Lee to stop any &quot;Yankee&quot; who tries to cross the border. Bugs points out that the Civil War ended almost 90 years ago, but his protests fall on deaf ears.

Bugs uses a series of disguises in order to fool Sam: first a banjo-playing slave, then Abraham Lincoln, then &quot;Brickwall Jackson&quot;, then a Southern belle, and finally an injured Confederate soldier. In the last guise, he tricks Sam into heading for Tennessee by telling him &quot;the Yankees are in Chattanooga&quot;. The short ends with Sam brandishing his gun at the New York Yankees, who have come to Chattanooga for an exhibition game.

==Publication notes==
Due to later controversies about the portrayal of ethnic stereotypes in cartoons, the scene where Bugs crosses the border disguised as a slave and Abraham Lincoln was cut from the episode&#x27;s television broadcastings.

==Home media==
&quot;Southern Fried Rabbit&quot; was made available on a VHS tape, and its restored, uncut version on DVD in &quot;Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 4&quot;.

<doc id="1271478" wikidata="Q3424638" url="?curid=1271478" title="Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation">
<text>The Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) is a directorate under the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is primarily concerned with offering development aid to international partners, but in matters regarding Norway&#x27;s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), Norad reports to the Norwegian Ministry of Climate and Environment.

Norad&#x27;s functions are laid down in the agency&#x27;s terms of references and annual letters of allocation issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Climate and Environment.

Norad works to ensure effective foreign aid, with quality assurance and evaluation. Norad finances NGOs and does its own research and projects. The current director general is Bård Vegar Solhjell. Norad used to be the official development assistance organization in Norway. As of mid-2004, the responsibility for state-to-state official development assistance has been transferred to the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, while Norad continues to fund NGO activities in developing countries (particularly through its NORHED program), and contributes to the management of development funds while ensuring that Norwegian development cooperation is accurately evaluated and efficiently implemented.

== Organization ==
Norad consists of the following departments:

* Director General&#x27;s Office
* Department for Climate, Energy, Environment and Research
* Department for Education and Global Health
* Department for Economic Development, Gender and Governance 
* Civil Society Department
* Department for Quality Assurance
* Department for Communication
* Department of Human Resources and Administration
* Evaluation Department

==Finances==
Norway granted NOK 36.6 billion in development assistance in 2016, corresponding to 1.11 per cent of Norway&#x27;s gross national income (GNI).

According to the OECD, Norway’s total ODA (USD 5.2 billion, preliminary data) increased in 2022 due to aid to Ukraine and increased in-donor refugee costs, and represented 0.86% of GNI.

<text>Operation Pierce Arrow was a U.S. bombing campaign at the beginning of the Vietnam War.

In response to the Gulf of Tonkin incident when the destroyers and of the United States Navy engaged North Vietnamese ships, sustaining light damage as they gathered electronic intelligence while in the international waters of the Gulf of Tonkin, U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered Operation &quot;Pierce Arrow&quot; which was conducted on 5 August 1964.

The operation consisted of 64 strike sorties of aircraft from the aircraft carriers and against North Vietnamese naval vessels (mostly Swatow gunboats--only two were torpedo boats) and the oil storage depot at Vinh. The U.S. lost two aircraft to anti-aircraft fire, with one pilot killed, Lieutenant Richard Sather, piloting an A-1 Skyraider. Another, Lt. (jg) Everett Alvarez Jr. an A-4 Skyhawk pilot, became the first U.S. Navy prisoner of war in Vietnam. North Vietnam claimed to have shot down eight U.S. aircraft.

Pilots estimated that the Vinh raid destroyed 10 percent of North Vietnam&#x27;s entire petroleum storage, together with the destruction of or damage to 29 P-4 torpedo boats or gunboats.

The United States had begun air operations over South Vietnam in 1962 (see Operation Farm Gate). Pierce Arrow was the first extension of those operations to North Vietnam. Operations over North Vietnam would expand greatly in 1965, attempting to destroy the infrastructure, war material, and military units needed by North Vietnam to prosecute the guerrilla war in the South. The air operations following Pierce Arrow would swell so that by war&#x27;s end, the United States bombing campaign was the longest and heaviest in history. The 7,662,000 tons of bombs dropped in Indochina during the Vietnam War nearly quadrupled the 2,150,000 tons the U.S. had dropped during World War II.

<doc id="1271503" wikidata="Q907387" url="?curid=1271503" title="Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius">
<text>The Equestrian Statue of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (; ) is an ancient Roman equestrian statue on the Capitoline Hill, Rome, Italy. It is made of bronze and stands 4.24 m (13.9 ft) tall. Although the emperor is mounted, the sculpture otherwise exhibits many similarities to the standing statues of Augustus. The original is on display in the Capitoline Museums, while the sculpture now standing in the open air at the Piazza del Campidoglio is a replica made in 1981 when the original was taken down for restoration.

==Description==
The statue projects an impression of power and god-like grandeur: the emperor is over life-size and extends his hand in a gesture of &quot;adlocutio&quot; used by emperors when addressing their troops. Some historians assert that a conquered enemy was originally part of the sculpture (based on medieval accounts, including in the &quot;Mirabilia Urbis Romae&quot;, which suggest that a small figure of a bound barbarian chieftain once cowered underneath the horse&#x27;s front right leg). Such an image was meant to portray the emperor as victorious and all-conquering. However, shown without weapons or armour, Marcus Aurelius seems to be a bringer of peace rather than a military hero, for this is how he saw himself and his reign.

The emperor is shown riding without the use of stirrups, which had not yet been introduced to the West. While the horse has been meticulously studied in order to be recreated for other artists&#x27; works, the saddle cloth was copied with the thought that it was part of the standard Roman uniform. The saddle cloth is actually Sarmatian in origin, suggesting that the horse is a Sarmatian horse and that the statue was created to honour the victory over the Sarmatians by Marcus Aurelius, after which he adopted &quot;Sarmaticus&quot; to his name.

== History ==
The statue was erected around 175 AD. Its original location is debated: the Roman Forum and Piazza Colonna (where the Column of Marcus Aurelius stands) have been proposed. However, it was noted that the site where it had originally stood had been converted into a vineyard during the early Middle Ages.

Although there were many equestrian imperial statues, they rarely survived because it was the common practice to melt down bronze statues for reuse as material for coins or new sculptures in the late empire. Indeed, that of Marcus Aurelius is one of only two surviving bronze statues of a pre-Christian Roman emperor; the Regisole, destroyed after the French Revolution, may have been another. The equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome owes its preservation on the Campidoglio to a common misidentification of Marcus Aurelius, the philosopher-emperor, with Constantine the Great, the Christian emperor; indeed, more than 20 other bronze equestrian statues of various emperors and generals had been melted down since the end of the Imperial Roman era. 

It has been speculated that its misidentification stems from the prior existence of an equestrian statue of Constantine which had stood beside the Arch of Septimius Severus, and which had been most likely taken on the orders of the emperor Constans II during his visit to Rome in 663. With its removal, the people eventually mistakenly identified Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s statue for Constantine&#x27;s.

In the Middle Ages this was one of the few Roman statues to remain on public view, in the Campus Lateranensis, to the east of the Lateran Palace in Rome, from 1474 on a pedestal provided by Pope Sixtus IV. Its placement next to the Lateran Palace was due the fact that this site used to contain the house of Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s grandfather Marcus Annius Verus, which was where the emperor&#x27;s birth and early education took place. According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, an unpopular prefect of the city under Pope John XII (d. 964) was hung from it by the hair by the mob.

By order of Pope Paul III, it was moved to the Piazza del Campidoglio (Capitoline Hill) during Michelangelo&#x27;s redesign of the hill in 1538, to remove it from the main traffic of the square. Though Michelangelo disagreed with the central positioning, he designed a pedestal for it. The original bronze statue is now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori of the Musei Capitolini; that in the square is a modern replica.

On the night of 29 November 1849, at the inception of the revolutionary Roman Republic, a mass procession set up the red–white–green (now the flag of Italy, then a new and highly &quot;subversive&quot; flag) in the hands of the mounted Marcus Aurelius.

In 1979, a bomb attack in the nearby Palazzo Senatorio damaged the marble base of the statue.

== Cultural significance ==

The statue appears on the reverse of an aureus of Marcus Aurelius struck in 174 AD. It is depicted on the reverse of the modern Italian €0.50 coin, designed by .

The statue was formerly clad in gold. An old local myth says that it will turn gold again on the Day of Judgment.

===Replicas===
In 1981 work began on producing a replica of the statue for outdoor display. Digital image files were used for reference while a laser beam ensured accurate measurements. Conservators used this copy to cast a faithful bronze replica of the statue, now in the Campidoglio.

<text>CSS &quot;Chickamauga&quot;, originally the blockade runner &quot;Edith&quot;, was purchased by the Confederate States Navy at Wilmington, North Carolina, in September 1864. In September, when she was nearly ready for sea, the Confederate Army sought unsuccessfully to retain her at that place for use as a troop and supply transport. On October 28, 1864, she put to sea under Lieutenant John Wilkinson (CSN) for a cruise north to the entrance of Long Island Sound, thence to St. George, Bermuda, for repairs and coal. She took several prizes before returning to Wilmington on November 19.

During the bombardment of Fort Fisher, December 24–25, 1864, a portion of &quot;Chickamauga&quot;″s crew served the guns at the fort. Although not immediately engaged in defense of Fort Fisher, the ship rendered further aid in transporting ammunition. She lent support to the fort when it was bombarded again on January 15, 1865.

After the evacuation of Wilmington, &quot;Chickamauga&quot; went up the Cape Fear River where she was burned to prevent capture on February 25, 1865.

==Service history==
The ship, &quot;Edith&quot;, from Tallahassee, Florida, became the new Confederate cruiser. Its name was CSS &quot;Chickamauga&quot;. CSS stands for Confederate States Ship. Lieutenant John Wilkinson, who was a lieutenant of the new Confederate Navy, commanded the ship. Wilkinson as he was commanding &quot;Chickamauga&quot;, ran into the same problems faced by Woods, who was the previous commander. The ship had been a productive blockade runner, but it did not have the qualities needed for a Raider. &quot;Chickamauga&quot; was fast, but she could only be at sea as long as they had coal supply.
On October 26, &quot;Chickamauga&quot; set sail for the open sea. After she also grounded on the bar, backed herself free, tried once more again, she finally cleared the obstruction, and made it out into the open sea. &quot;Chickamauga&quot; was once seen by . &quot;Dumbarton&quot; as well as two more Union ships chased &quot;Chickamauga&quot;. However, speed saved the ship, and she sailed off into the ocean, once again. US ships reported that another ship, &quot;Tallahassee&quot;, was sailing out and about again, and was searching for exactly the same thing as what &quot;Chickamauga&quot; was looking for.

The ship then captured in quick succession the &quot;Mark L. Potter&quot;, the &quot;Emily L. Hall&quot;, the &quot;Albion Lincoln&quot;, and the &quot;Shooting Star.&quot; All the prisoners were put aboard the &quot;Albion Lincoln&quot;, while the other vessels were burned. The &quot;Lincoln&quot;&#x27;s captain headed straight to New York to raise the alarm, instead of going to Fort Monroe as ordered. On 4 November, Secretary Welles learned that he had to search for another raider, but since he did not know anymore information, he telegraphed Rear Admiral Porter: &quot;It is reported that four privateers are out of Wilmington. Three have actually committed depredations, namely, Tallahassee, Chickamauga, and Olustee.&quot; &quot;Olustee&quot; was actually &quot;Tallahassee&quot;, but just under a different new name. The next day, Porter ordered to find the raiders, so therefore the nine Union warships could be reunited. 
Lieutenant John Wilkinson kept busy, he captured &quot;Goodspeed&quot;, &quot;Otter Rock&quot;, and &quot;Speedwell&quot;. While Porter’s ships were trying to find &quot;Chickamauga&quot;, she sailed down in the Bermuda Triangle looking for coal. Wilkinson, on 15 November, left the Bermuda Triangle and set course towards his homeport. He arrived on 18 November waiting to anchor in safety. Before he reached his haven, four Union blockade ships, , , and all fired shots. &quot;Chickamauga&quot; herself got into the act, but not a single shot from either side ever found a target.
In three weeks &quot;Chickamauga&quot; had taken only seven ships, &quot;Olustee&quot; only four. &quot;Tallahassee&quot; was responsible for capturing more than 55 ships. When the Feds stormed Fort Fisher, it was &quot;Chickamauga&quot; who took part in this final battle. She then had to retreat up river back to Wilmington, where her crew burned her. &quot;Olustee&quot; had another name change due to its duties as a blockade runner. and was renamed &quot;Chameleon&quot;. Lieutenant John Wilkinson took her out to the Bermuda Triangle to provide General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s armies with food and supplies. After that, he sailed off to Liverpool, and when he got there, Lee surrendered, and the British Government seized his ship.

<doc id="1271520" wikidata="Q271260" url="?curid=1271520" title="Mandane of Media">
<text>Mandane (Greek: , &quot;Mandánē&quot;) was a Median princess and, later, the queen consort of the Persian king Cambyses I and the mother of Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Achaemenid Empire. The name likely originates from the Old Iranian &quot;*Mandanā-&quot;, which means “&quot;delighting&quot;, &quot;cheerful&quot;”.

Mandane was the daughter of Astyages, but the name of her mother is not mentioned. It is said that Astyages married Aryenis in 585 BC, but it is unlikely that Aryenis was the mother of Mandane. She possibly was the daughter of a previous wife of Astyages. According to the Greek historian Herodotus, Astyages had a dream in which his daughter stood before him, and suddenly a vine began to grow from her back, extending its tendrils to cover all of Asia. He called upon the Magi and priests to interpret the dream, and they explained that the vine represented his grandson, the son of Mandane, who would take his place on the throne and rule over all of Asia. In 577 BC, when Mandane reached marriageable age, Astyages gave her in marriage to Cambyses I, a Persian with noble ancestry who was mild-mannered and held a lower position than the Medes. Therefore, he did not believe that Cambyses I would pose a threat to his kingdom. Mandane&#x27;s marriage to Cambyses was encouraged by Astyages to strengthen the bonds between the Medes and Persians.

Mandane gave birth to a son named Cyrus, whom Astyages ordered to be executed by Harpagus. However, Harpagus handed the child over to a shepherd and lied to Astyages, saying that Cyrus had been killed. When Cyrus grew up, his grandfather Astyages discovered that he was alive and allowed him to return to his parents in Persia. Xenophon also mentions Mandane in his work &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;. According to his story, Mandane and her son traveled to the court of Astyages, where the adolescent Cyrus surprised his grandfather, who decided to keep him at the court. Mandane, however, returned to her husband Cambyses I in Persia. After several years, Cyrus asked Astyages to let him return to Persia, but some time after his departure from Ecbatana, the Persian Revolt began. Astyages&#x27; dreams and their interpretation became reality when Cyrus led the revolt that resulted in the overthrow of Astyages from the throne, the fall of the Median kingdom, and the rise of the Achaemenid Empire.
Mandane serves as the genealogical link connecting the kings of the Achaemenid dynasty with the ancient Median royal family. Some scholars have suggested that the Gur-e Dokhtar tomb, discovered in 1960, could be the burial site of Mandane. However, other scholars believe that the tomb might belong to Atossa, Teispes, or Cyrus I.

There is some doubt about the historical accuracy of the marriage between Cambyses and Mandane. The Median mother of Cyrus may have been invented to justify the later Persian rule over the Medes. It appears that the purpose of this story is to establish a direct relationship between Astyages and Cyrus, that is, between Media and Persia. Due to the historical record of the battle between Astyages and Cyrus and the conquest of Media by Cyrus as reported in the Nabonidus Chronicle, the story of the marriage between Cambyses I and Mandane, as well as the birth of Cyrus from this couple, is highly questionable in terms of its historicity. There is also the account by Ctesias, which claims that Cyrus married a daughter of Astyages named Amytis. If both the accounts of Ctesias and Herodotus are correct, then Cyrus marrying Amytis would be an unusual case of incest, as he would be marrying his aunt. Nevertheless, Herodotus&#x27; account is considered reliable by most modern scholars, such as George G. Cameron.

<doc id="1271526" wikidata="Q1060042" url="?curid=1271526" title="South Region, Brazil">
<text>The South Region of Brazil ( ) is one of the five regions of Brazil. It includes the states of Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina, and covers , being the smallest region of the country, occupying only about 6.76% of the territory of Brazil. Its whole area is smaller than that of the state of Minas Gerais, in Southeast Brazil, for example or the whole metropolitan France.

It is a tourist, economic and cultural pole. It borders Uruguay, Argentina, and Paraguay, as well as the Centre-West and Southeast regions, and the Atlantic Ocean. The region is considered the safest in Brazil to visit, having a lower crime rate than other regions in the country.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian history===


By the time the first European explorers arrived, all parts of the territory were inhabited by semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer native tribes. They subsisted on a combination of hunting, fishing, and gathering.

===Portuguese colonization===
European colonization in Southern Brazil started with the arrival of Portuguese and Spanish Jesuit missionaries. They lived among the Natives and converted them to Catholicism. Colonists from São Paulo (&quot;Bandeirantes&quot;) arrived in the same period. For decades, the Portuguese and Spanish crowns disputed over this region.

Due to this conflict, the King of Portugal encouraged the immigration of settlers from the Azores Islands to Southern Brazil, in an attempt to build up a Portuguese population. Between 1748 and 1756, six thousand Azoreans arrived. They composed over half of the population of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina by the late 18th century.

===German settlement===

The first German immigrants came to Brazil soon after it gained independence in 1822 from Portugal. They were recruited to work as small farmers because there were many land holdings without sufficient workers. To attract the immigrants, the Brazilian government had promised them large tracts where they could settle with their families and colonize the region. The first immigrants arrived in 1824, settling in the city of São Leopoldo. Over the next four decades, another 27,256 Germans were brought to Rio Grande do Sul to work as smallholders in the country. By 1904, it is estimated that 50,000 Germans had settled in this state.

In Santa Catarina, most German immigrants were not brought by the Brazilian government but by private groups that promoted the immigration of Europeans to the Americas, such as the Hamburg Colonization Society. These groups created rural communities or colonies for immigrants, many of which developed into large cities, such as Blumenau and Joinville, the largest city in Santa Catarina.

Considerable numbers of immigrants from Germany arrived at Paraná during the civil war, most of them coming from Santa Catarina; others were Volga Germans from Russia.

===Ragamuffin War===
The Ragamuffin War was a Republican uprising that began in Southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina) in 1835. The rebels, led by generals Bento Gonçalves da Silva and Antônio de Souza Netto with the support of the Italian warrior Giuseppe Garibaldi, surrendered to imperial forces in 1845. This conflict occurred because in Rio Grande do Sul, the state&#x27;s main product, the charque (dried and salted beef), suffered stiff competition from charque from Uruguay and Argentina. The imports had free access to the Brazilian market while gaúchos had to pay high taxes to sell their product inside Brazil. The Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi joined the rebels in 1839. With his help the revolution spread through Santa Catarina, in the northern border of Rio Grande do Sul. After many conflicts, in 1845 peace negotiations ended the war.

===Italian settlement===

Italian immigrants started arriving in Brazil in 1875. They were mostly peasants from the Veneto in Northern Italy (but also from Trentino and Lombardia) attracted to Southern Brazil for economic opportunities and the chance to acquire their own lands. Most of the immigrants worked as small farmers, mainly cultivating grapes in the Serra Gaúcha. Italian immigration to the region lasted until 1914, with a total of 100,000 Italians settling in Rio Grande do Sul in this period, and many others in Santa Catarina and Paraná.

In 1898, there were a total of 300,000 people of Italian origin in Rio Grande do Sul; 50,000 in Santa Catarina; and 30,000 in Paraná. Today their Southern Brazilian descendants number 9.7 million and comprise 35.9% of Southern Brazil&#x27;s population.

==Demographics==

As noted, the region received numerous European immigrants during the 19th century, who have had a large influence on its demography and culture. The main ethnic origins of Southern Brazil are Portuguese, Italian, German, Austrian, Luxembourger, Polish, Ukrainian, Spanish, Dutch and Russian. Smaller numbers that follow are French, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, African, Swiss, Croat, Lebanese, Lithuanian and Latvian, Japanese, Finnish and Estonian, Belarusian, Slovene, Ashkenazi Jew, Caboclo, British, Czech, Slovak, Belgian and Hungarian

===Racial composition===

==Geography==
===Climate===

Southern Brazil has subtropical or temperate climate. The annual average temperatures vary between 12 °C (53.6 °F) and 22 °C (71.6 °F). It snows in the mountain ranges.

==Characteristics==

The region is highly urbanized (82%) and many cities are famous for their urban planning, like Curitiba and Maringá, both in Paraná State. It has a relatively high standard of living, with the highest Human Development Index of Brazil, 0.859 (2007), and the second highest per capita income of the country, $13,396, behind only the Southeast Region. The region also has a 98.3% literacy rate.

==Languages==
Portuguese, the official language of Brazil, is spoken by the entire population. In the south countryside, dialects of German or Italian origins are also spoken. The predominant dialects are Hunsrückisch and Venetian (or Talian). In Rio Grande do Sul and Curitiba there are some Yiddish speakers. In the northern region of Paraná there are some Japanese speakers. In the region around Ponta Grossa there are also some Dutch speakers. There are Polish language and Ukrainian language speakers in Paraná as well. Indigenous languages still spoken in some villages include Guarani and Kaingang.

== Economy ==
=== Agriculture ===


The main agricultural products grown are:

* soy (35% of the country&#x27;s production, which is the world&#x27;s largest producer);
* maize (35% of the country&#x27;s production, which is the 3rd world producer);
* tobacco (almost all the production of the country, which is the second largest producer in the world and the largest exporter);
* rice (80% of the country&#x27;s production, which is the ninth largest producer in the world);
* grape (almost all the production of the country, which is the eleventh largest producer in the world);
* apple (almost all the production of the country, which is the thirteenth world producer);
* wheat (almost all the country&#x27;s production);
* oat (almost all the country&#x27;s production);
* sugar cane (8% of the country&#x27;s production, which is the world&#x27;s largest producer);
* cassava (25% of the country&#x27;s production, which is the fifth largest producer in the world);
* yerba mate (almost all the production of the country, which is one of the largest producers in the world);
* bean (26% of the country&#x27;s production, which is the third largest producer in the world);

in addition to producing relevant quantities of:

* orange (6% of the country&#x27;s production, which is the world&#x27;s largest producer);
* tangerine (30% of the country&#x27;s production, which is the sixth largest producer in the world);
* persimmon (20% of the country&#x27;s production, which is the sixth largest producer in the world);
* barley, peach, fig and onion (most of the country&#x27;s production);
* strawberry.

=== Livestock ===

In 2017, the southern region gathered around 12% of Brazil&#x27;s cattle (27 million head of cattle).

In sheep farming, in 2017, the South Region was the second largest in the country, with 4.2 million head. Sheep shearing activity continued to be predominant in the South, which is responsible for 99% of wool production in the country. Rio Grande do Sul continued to be the state with the highest national participation, representing 94.1% of the total. The municipalities of Santana do Livramento, Alegrete and Quaraí led the activity. Currently, meat production has become the main objective of sheep farming in the State, due to the increase in prices paid to the producer that made the activity more attractive and profitable.

Intensive livestock farming is also highly developed in the South, which ranks first in the ranking of Brazilian milk production. Some of the milk produced in the South benefits from the dairy industries. The South has 35.7% of the Brazilian milk production, competing with the Southeast (which was the largest producer until 2014), which has 34.2%. The southeast has the largest herd of cows milked: 30.4% of the total of 17.1 million existing in Brazil. The highest productivity, however, is that of the Southern Region, with an average of 3,284 liters per cow per year, which is why it has led the ranking of milk production since 2015. The municipality of Castro, in Paraná, was the largest producer in 2017, with 264 million liters of milk. Paraná is already the second largest national producer with 4.7 billion liters, only surpassed by Minas Gerais.

In pork, the 3 southern states are the largest producers in the country. Santa Catarina is the largest producer in Brazil. The State is responsible for 28.38% of the country&#x27;s slaughter and 40.28% of Brazilian pork exports. Paraná, for its part, has a breeding stock of 667 thousand inhabited dwellings, with a herd representing 17.85% of the Brazilian total. Paraná occupies the second position in the country&#x27;s productive ranking, with 21.01%, and the third place among exporting states, with 14.22%. In third place in Brazil is Rio Grande do Sul, with almost 15% participation.

Poultry farming is strong in the South. In 2018, the South region, with an emphasis on the creation of chickens for slaughter, was responsible for almost half of the Brazilian total (46.9%). Paraná only represented 26.2%. Paraná occupies the Brazilian leadership in the ranking of chicken producing and exporting states. Rio Grande do Sul ranks third in national production, with 11%.

In egg production, the South Region is the 2nd largest in Brazil, with 24.1% of the country&#x27;s production. Paraná ranks 2nd in the Brazilian ranking, with 9.6% of the national participation.

In fish farming, western Paraná, in municipalities close to Toledo and Cascavel, has become the largest fishing region in the country, with tilapia as the main cultivated species. The west represents 69% of all the production of Paraná, the largest national producer, with 112 thousand tons. Of this amount, 91% refers to tilapia farming.

The South region was the main producer of honey in the country in 2017, representing 39.7% of the national total. Rio Grande do Sul was the first with 15.2%, Paraná in second place with 14.3%, Santa Catarina in fifth place with 10.2%.

=== Mining ===
Santa Catarina is the largest producer of coal in Brazil, mainly in the city of Criciúma and its surroundings. Crude mineral coal production in Brazil was 13.6 million tons in 2007. Santa Catarina produced 8.7 Mt (million tons); Rio Grande do Sul, 4.5 Mt; and Paraná, 0.4 Mt. Despite the extraction of mineral coal in Brazil, the country still needs to import around 50% of the coal consumed, since the coal produced in the country is of low quality, since it has a lower concentration of carbon. Countries supplying mineral coal to Brazil include South Africa, the United States and Australia. Mineral coal in Brazil supplies, in particular, thermoelectric plants that consume around 85% of production. The cement industry in the country, on the other hand, is supplied with approximately 6% of this coal, leaving 4% for the production of cellulose paper and only 5% in the food, ceramic and grain industries. Brazil has reserves of peat, lignite and hard coal. Coal totals 32 billion tons of reserves and is mainly located in Rio Grande do Sul (89.25% of the total), followed by Santa Catarina (10.41%). The Candiota (RS) deposit only has 38% of all the national coal. As it is an inferior quality coal, it is used only in thermoelectric power generation and at the deposit site. The oil crisis in the 1970s led the Brazilian government to create the Energy Mobilization Plan, with intense research to discover new coal reserves. The Geological Survey of Brazil, through works carried out in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina, greatly increased previously known coal reserves between 1970 and 1986 (mainly between 1978 and 1983). Then good quality coal, suitable for use in metallurgy and in large volumes (seven billion tons), was discovered in several deposits in Rio Grande do Sul (Morungava, Chico Lomã, Santa Teresinha), but at relatively great depths (up to 1,200 m), which has prevented its use until now. In 2011, coal represented only 5.6% of the energy consumed in Brazil, but it is an important strategic source, which can be activated when, for example, the water levels in the dams are very low, reducing the excess supply of water. hydroelectric power. This happened in 2013, when several thermoelectric plants were closed, thus maintaining the necessary supply, although at a higher cost.

Paraná is the largest producer of oil shale in Brazil. In the city of São Mateus do Sul, there is a plant Petrobras specialized in the production of the material. Approximately 7,800 tons are processed daily.

Rio Grande do Sul is an important producer of gemstones. Brazil is the world&#x27;s largest producer of amethyst and agate, and Rio Grande do Sul is the country&#x27;s largest producer. Agate has had local extraction since 1830. The largest producer of amethyst in Brazil is the city of Ametista do Sul. This stone was very rare and expensive throughout the world, until the discovery of large deposits in Brazil, which caused a considerable drop in its value.

=== Industry ===



The region concentrates 20% of the industrial GDP of the country.

In 2019, Paraná was the second largest vehicle producer in the country (Brazil is one of the 10 largest vehicle producers in the world). Paraná has in its territory the Volkswagen, Renault, Audi, Volvo and DAF factories; Santa Catarina has GM and BMW plants and Rio Grande do Sul, a GM plant.

In the food industry, in 2019, Brazil was the second largest exporter of processed foods in the world, with a value of US$34.1 billion in exports. Regarding the creation of national or multinational companies, Rio Grande do Sul created companies such as Neugebauer, Camil Alimentos, Fruki, Cervejaria Polar, Vinícola Aurora and Vinícola Salton. Santa Catarina created companies such as Sadia and Perdigão (which later merged into BRF), Seara Alimentos (which today belongs to JBS), Aurora, Gomes da Costa, Cervejaria Eisenbahn and Hemmer Alimentos. Paraná created companies such as: Frimesa, C.Vale, Nutrimental, Copacol, Coopavel and Matte Leão.

In the footwear industry, in 2019 Brazil produced 972 million pairs, being the fourth largest producer in the world, behind China, India and Vietnam, and ranks 11th among the largest exporters. The Brazilian state that most exports the product is Rio Grande do Sul: in 2019 it exported US$448.35 million. Most of the product goes to the United States, Argentina and France. Santa Catarina also has a shoe production center in São João Batista.

In the textile industry, Brazil, despite being among the 5 largest producers in the world in 2013, and being representative in the consumption of textiles and clothing, had very little insertion in world trade. In 2015, Brazilian imports ranked 25th (US$5.5 billion). And in exports, it only ranked 40th in the world ranking. Brazil&#x27;s participation in the world trade of textiles and clothing is only 0.3%, due to the difficulty of competing in price with producers in India and mainly in China. The South had 32.65% of the country&#x27;s textile production. Santa Catarina is the second largest textile and clothing employer in Brazil. It held the national leadership in the manufacture of pillows and is the largest producer in Latin America and the second in the world in woven labels. It&#x27;s the nation&#x27;s largest exporter of toilet / kitchen linen, cotton terry fabrics and cotton knit shirts. Some of the most famous companies in the region are Hering, Malwee, Karsten and Haco.

In the electronics industry, the industry turnover in Brazil reached R $153.0 billion in 2019, around 3% of the national GDP. The number of employees in the sector was 234,500 people. Brazil has two large electroelectronic production poles, located in Campinas, in the State of São Paulo, and in the Manaus Free Zone, in the State of Amazonas. The country also has other smaller centers, one of which is Curitiba, the capital of Paraná. The Curitiba technology center has companies such as Siemens and Positivo Informática. In total, 87 companies and 16 thousand employees work in Tecnoparque, an area of 127 thousand square meters created by state law in 2007. Tecnoparque can grow to 400 thousand square meters and receive up to four times the number of workers it has today, reaching 68 thousand people.

In the home appliance industry, sales of so-called &quot;white line&quot; equipment were 12.9 million units in 2017. The sector had its sales peak in 2012, with 18.9 million units. The brands that sold the most were Brastemp, Electrolux, Consul and Philips. Consul is originally from Santa Catarina, merged with Brastemp and today is part of the multinational Whirlpool Corporation. Another famous brand from the South was Prosdócimo, founded in Curitiba, which was sold to Electrolux. In the small electrical appliances sector, the Britânia company is originally from Curitiba.

In the metallurgical sector, the South has one of the most famous companies in the country, Tramontina, which employs more than 8,500 employees and has 10 production units. Other famous companies in the South are Marcopolo, a bus body manufacturer, which had a market value of R $2.782 billion in 2015, and Randon, a group of 9 companies specialized in transport solutions, which groups together vehicle manufacturers, auto parts, and road equipment – employs around 11 thousand people and recorded gross sales in 2017 of R $4.2 billion.

The following month, he led the team to win the Copa MX final on 4 November against León in a 1–0 away victory, attaining their first major title in nine years. Bravo finished the 2015–2016 season scoring 11 goals in 34 games. On 10 July 2016, Bravo scored his last goal for &quot;Chivas&quot; playing against Veracruz in the last minute of the game ending in 2–0 win giving them their first Supercopa MX title their second in nine months and clinched Guadalajara a spot for the 2017 Copa Libertadores.

<doc id="1271590" wikidata="Q613014" url="?curid=1271590" title="Bert (name)">
<text>Bert is a hypocoristic form of a number of various Germanic male given names, such as Robert, Albert, Elbert, Herbert, Hilbert, Hubert, Gilbert, Wilbert, Filbert, Fulbert, Norbert, Osbert, Roberto, Roberta, Bertram, Berthold, Bertrand, Umberto, Humbert, Humberto, Alberto, Alberta, Albertine, Albertina, Cuthbert, Delbert, Dagobert, Rimbert, Egbert, Siegbert, Gualbert, Gerbert, Lambert, Engelbert, Bertie, Uberto and Colbert.

There is a large number of Germanic names ending in &quot;-bert&quot;, second in number only to those ending in &quot;-wolf&quot; (&quot;-olf&quot;, &quot;-ulf&quot;). Most of these names are early medieval and only a comparatively small fraction remains in modern use.

The element &quot;-berht&quot; has the meaning of &quot;bright&quot;, Old English &quot;beorht/berht&quot;, Old High German &quot;beraht/bereht&quot;, ultimately from a Common Germanic *&quot;berhtaz&quot;, from a PIE root *&quot;bhereg-&quot; &quot;white, bright&quot;. The female hypocoristic of names containing the same element is Berta.

Modern English bright itself has the same etymology, but it has suffered metathesis at an early date, already in the Old English period, attested as early as AD 700 in the Lindisfarne Gospels. The unmetathesized form disappears after AD 1000 and Middle English from about 1200 has &quot;briht&quot; universally.

==Names containing &quot;berht&quot;==
There is no evidence of the &quot;berht&quot; element in Germanic personal names prior to the 6th century. It is mostly unknown in names of Goths, Vandals, Frisians or Norse, and only rarely occurs in names of Saxons. By contrast, it is very common among Anglo-Saxons, Lombards, Franks and Bavarians. The popularity of the element in certain areas may be related to religion, similar to the &quot;wolf&quot; element being due to the worship of Wodanaz, the names with &quot;berht&quot; can be considered theophoric, in connection with the goddess Perchta. The full form of Old High German &quot;beraht&quot; is reduced in two ways, by omission of either the second (&quot;berht, perht, pert&quot;) or the first vowel (&quot;braht, praht, brat, prat, brecht&quot;). Early attestations of such names include &quot;Ethberictus&quot;, &quot;Garberictus&quot;, and &quot;Transberictus&quot; mentioned in Hontheim&#x27;s &quot;Historia Trevirensis&quot; s. a. 699. Pardessus&#x27; &quot;Diplomata&quot; s. a. 745 has &quot;Berdbert&quot; as a rare example of a reduplicated Germanic name. Förstemann counts 369 names with final &quot;-bert(a)&quot;, of which 61 are feminine.

Given names that remain in modern use include:

<text>Baroness Jemima von Tautphoeus (née Montgomery) (23 October 1807 – 12 November 1893) was an Irish novelist writing in English. She spent much of her life in Germany and wrote several stories that deal with Bavarian life, manners and history.

==Life==
Born Jemima Montgomery on 23 October 1807 at Seaview, County Donegal, Ireland, she was the daughter of James Montgomery of Seaview and his wife, Jemima (daughter of James Glasgow of Aughadenvarn, County Leitrim). She was also the niece of Sir Henry Conyngham Montgomery, first baronet. The writer Maria Edgeworth was a cousin, whom she described as one of the most interesting people it was possible to know.

Jemima was married on 29 January 1838 to Cajetan Josef Friedrich, Baron von Tautphœus of Marquartstein (1805–1885), Chamberlain to the king of Bavaria. The remainder of her life was spent principally in Bavaria, where she was equally at home in court circles, and as her works show, among the peasantry and the middle classes.

Baron von Tautphœus died on 14 November 1885, a few days after his only son, Rudolf Edgeworth Josef (20 November 1838 – 1 November 1885), who had risen to be Bavarian minister in Rome. The Baroness died on 12 November 1893.

==Career==
Baroness von Tautphoeus is a member of an interesting group of writers of English fiction, who became residents in foreign countries and devoted their talents to the illustration of foreign manners. Having been extremely popular in the second half of the 19th century, they have since fallen into obscurity.

Her four novels were described by Richard Garnett as &quot;entertaining combinations of romance and travelogue,&quot; drawing on a knowledge of English and German manners and scenery. Her heroines (such as Hildegarde in &quot;The Initials&quot; and Leonora in &quot;Quits&quot;) are forceful and intellectually curious. Her first, &quot;The Initials&quot; (London, 1850) became highly popular despite attracting little critical attention. It contrasts a pair of German sisters and is a tale of skilful suspense with a happy dénouement. &quot;Quits&quot; (London, 1857; in German, Leipzig, 1863) concerns how the life of the mind may protect someone from frivolous society. It devotes 60 pages in three chapters to the Oberammergau Passion Play performance of 1850. &quot;Cyrilla&quot; (1853 in German, Leipzig, 1854) is founded on the true-life murder trial of Assessor Zahn. The last novel, &quot;At Odds&quot; (1863), suffered in the author&#x27;s view from being written in a period of prolonged ill-health.

A more recent account of Baroness von Tautphoeus states that her novels point to a person of conservative tastes, very well read in English, German and French. She was mistrustful of the modernity of the 19th century and tended to see Bavaria as a refuge for traditional values in a fast-changing world. Her silence in the 33 years that followed her last novel probably reflects a lack of sympathy with events in Bavaria in the latter half of that century. As her obituarist in The New York Times put it, &quot;She always lived a retired life, and had published nothing for many years, and her death seems not to have been regarded in Germany as a matter of news.&quot;

<text>Isaac Taylor (17 August 1787 – 28 June 1865) was an English philosophical and historical writer, artist, and inventor.

==Life==
He was the eldest surviving son of Isaac Taylor of Ongar. He was born at Lavenham, Suffolk, on 17 August 1787, and moved with his family to Colchester and, at the end of 1810, to Ongar. In the family tradition, he was trained as draughtsman and engraver. After a few years&#x27; occupation as a designer of book illustrations, he turned to literature as vocation.

From 1812 to 1816 he wintered in the west of England, and he spent most of this time at Ilfracombe and Marazion in the company of his sister, Jane. About 1815 through the works of Sulpicius Severus he started to collect patristic literature. Shortly afterwards Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;De Augmentis&quot; excited his interest in inductive philosophy. In 1818 a friend of the family, Josiah Conder, then editor of the &quot;Eclectic Review&quot;, persuaded Taylor to join its regular staff, which already included Robert Hall, John Foster, and Olinthus Gilbert Gregory.

In 1825 he settled at Stanford Rivers, about two miles from Ongar, in a rambling old-fashioned farmhouse. There he married, on 17 August 1825, Elizabeth, second daughter of James Medland of Newington, the friend and correspondent of his sister Jane. In 1836 Taylor contested the chair of logic at Edinburgh University with Sir William Hamilton, and was narrowly beaten. In March 1841, in Hanover Square, he delivered four lectures on &#x27;Spiritual Christianity&#x27;. Though he joined the Anglican communion at an early stage in his career, Taylor remained on good terms with friends among the dissenters.

Taylor was granted a civil list pension of £200 in 1862 as acknowledgment of his services to literature, and he died at Stanford Rivers three years later, on 28 June 1865.

Taylor was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1895.

==Works==
As a young man he executed designs for his father and for the books issued by his sister Jane Taylor. He executed anatomical drawings for a surgeon, and painted miniatures, one a portrait of his sister, another of himself in 1817. Some of his designs for John Boydell&#x27;s &#x27;Illustrations of Holy Writ&#x27; (1820), were admired by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and compared by Alexander Gilchrist with some of the plates of William Blake (&quot;Life of Blake&quot;, 1863).

In 1822 appeared Taylor&#x27;s first book, &quot;The Elements of Thought&quot; (London, 1823; 11th edit. 1867), later recast as &quot;The World of Mind&quot; (London, 1857). This was followed in 1824 by a new translation of the &quot;Characters of Theophrastus&quot; (by &#x27;Francis Howell,&#x27; London). The translator added pictorial renderings of the characters drawn on wood by himself. In 1825 there followed the &quot;Memoirs, Correspondence, and Literary Remains of Jane Taylor&quot; (London, 1825, 2 vols.; 2nd edit. 1826; incorporated in &quot;The Taylors of Ongar&quot;, 1867).

&quot;History of the Transmission of Ancient Books to Modern Times&quot; (London, 1827) and &quot;The Process of Historical Proof&quot; (London, 1828) were later remodelled as a single work (1859), in which he attempted to show grounds for accepting literary documents like the Bible as a basis for history. Next appeared an expurgated translation of Herodotus (London, 1829), work which seems to have suggested an anonymous romance, &quot;The Temple of Melekartha&quot; (London, 1831), dealing with the prehistoric migration of the Tyrians from the Persian Gulf to the Levant. Taylor is said to have depicted his wife in the heroine. His next and best-known work, &quot;The Natural History of Enthusiasm&quot; (London; Boston, 1830; 10th edit. London, 1845), appeared anonymously in May 1829. It was a sort of historico-philosophical disquisition on religious imagination, and had an instant vogue. Taylor developed the subject in his &quot;Fanaticism&quot; (London, 1833; 7th edit. 1866) and &quot;Spiritual Despotism&quot; (London, 1835, three editions). Three further volumes on scepticism, credulity, and the corruption of morals were included in the author&#x27;s plan of a &#x27;morbid anatomy of spurious religion,&#x27; but these complementary volumes were never completed. Those that appeared were praised by John Wilson in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and the last of the three particularly by Sir James Stephen in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; (April 1840).

In the meantime Taylor had published a devotional volume, &quot;Saturday Evening&quot; (London, 1832; many editions in England and America). Subsequently, he developed a part of that book into &quot;The Physical Theory of Another Life&quot; (London, 1836; 6th edit. 1866), a work of speculation, anticipating a scheme of duties in a future world, adapted to an assumed expansion of human powers after death.

His next book was &quot;Home Education&quot; (London, 1838; 7th edit. 1867), in which he insisted on the beneficial influence of a country life, the educational value of children&#x27;s pleasures, and the natural rather than the stimulated growth of a child&#x27;s mental powers. He then completed and edited a translation of the &quot;Jewish Wars&quot; of Josephus by Robert Traill (1793–1847); it appeared in two sumptuous illustrated volumes (1847 and 1851), but lost money.

In his publication during 1839–40 of &quot;Ancient Christianity and the Doctrines of the Oxford Tracts&quot; (in 8 parts, London; 4th edit. 1844, 2 vols.), Taylor argued as controversialist against the &quot;Tracts for the Times&quot;, his contention being that the Christian Church of the fourth century had already matured into superstition and error. This view was contested. &quot;Loyola and Jesuitism in its Rudiments&quot; (London, 1849; several editions) and &quot;Wesley and Methodism&quot; (London, 1851; 1863, 1865, and New York, 1852) were followed by a popular work on the Christian argument, &quot;The Restoration of Belief&quot; (London, 1855,; several American editions), an anonymous publication. &quot;Logic in Theology&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Civilisation&quot; were volumes of essays reprinted in part from the &quot;Eclectic Review&quot; during 1859 and 1860, and were followed in turn by &quot;The Spirit of Hebrew Poetry&quot; (London, 1861; numerous editions), a volume of lectures, originally delivered at Edinburgh. After &quot;Considerations on the Pentateuch&quot; (London, 1863; two editions), in which he opposed the conclusions of John William Colenso, and a number of short memoirs for the &quot;Imperial Dictionary of Biography&quot;, his last work was &quot;Personal Recollections&quot; (London, 1864), a series of papers, in part autobiographical, which had appeared in &quot;Good Words&quot;.

==Inventor==
Taylor was interested in mechanical devices and inventions, and he had a workshop that he fitted up at Stanford Rivers. Early in life he invented a beer-tap (patented 20 November 1824) which came into wide use, and he designed a machine for engraving on copper (pat. 12248, 21 August 1848). Though it did not profit him, the idea was eventually applied on a large scale by a syndicate to engraving patterns on copper cylinders for calico printing in Manchester.

==Family==

Two of his sisters had a reputation as poets. Ann Taylor, later Mrs. Gilbert (1782–1866), and Jane (1783–1824), responsible for the well-known rhyme &quot;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&quot;. Josiah Gilbert, son of Ann Taylor, was an artist and author.

Taylor&#x27;s children were:

* Jane, who married, first, Dr. Harrison, and secondly, the Rev. S. D. Stubbs; 
* Isaac Taylor (1829–1901), churchman and author;
* Phœbe; 
* James Medland Taylor, architect, born 1834; 
* Rosa; 
* Henry Taylor, architect and author, born in 1837; 
* Catherine; 
* Jessie, who married Thomas Wilson; and 
* Euphemia.

<text>Sir William Temple, 1st Baronet (25 April 162827 January 1699) was an English diplomat, politician and writer. An important diplomat, he was recalled in 1679, and for a brief period was a leading advisor to Charles II of England, with whom he then fell out. Temple subsequently retired to the countryside, and thereafter occupied himself with gardening and writing. He is best remembered today for two aspects of his life after retirement: a passage on the designs of Chinese gardens, written without ever having seen one, and for employing a young Jonathan Swift as his secretary. The first is sometimes given as an early indication of the English landscape garden style, praising irregularity in design.

==Biography==

William Temple was the son of Sir John Temple of Dublin, an Irish judge and Master of the Rolls. Born in London, and educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, Temple travelled across Europe, and was for some time a member of the Irish Parliament, employed on various diplomatic missions. During his time as a diplomat, Temple successfully negotiated the Triple Alliance of 1668 and the marriage of the Prince of Orange and Princess Mary of England in 1677. On his return in 1679 he was much consulted by Charles II, but disapproving of the anti-Dutch courses adopted, retired to his house at Sheen.

He was called out of retirement to implement a plan of his design to reform government rule. He was the architect of the Privy Council Ministry of 1679, which, though it failed, was an early effort to establish an executive along the lines of what later came to be understood as Cabinet government. Charles II disapproved of the scheme, which in his view took away too much of the Royal Prerogative, although in the exceptional circumstances of the Exclusion Crisis he was willing to give it a brief trial.

Temple later left Sheen and purchased Compton Hall, Farnham around 1686. He renamed the house More Park after Moor Park, Hertfordshire, a house he much admired and which influenced the formal gardens he built at Farnham. Here the later-famous Jonathan Swift was his secretary for most of the period from 1689 onward. It was here that Swift met Esther Johnson, who became his lifelong companion and whom he immortalised as &quot;Stella&quot;. Despite rumours that she was Temple&#x27;s own daughter, the evidence suggests that her widowed mother lived in the house as companion to Temple&#x27;s sister Martha. Temple installed his family motto &quot;God has given us these opportunities for tranquility&quot; above the door and took great pleasure from this house in his retirement from public life.

He took no part in the Glorious Revolution, but acquiesced to the new regime, and was offered, but refused, a role as Secretary of State.

Temple died in More Park, Surrey, England in 1699. 
His memorial in Westminster Abbey names also his wife Dorothy, and their daughter Diana; in 1722 his sister Martha was also buried in the abbey and her name was added as she had left money for a monument. He was much loved by his friends; Swift wrote that all that was good and amiable in mankind departed with him. The normally cynical Robert Spencer, 2nd Earl of Sunderland, was deeply grieved by his death, writing to Temple&#x27;s sister Martha that &quot;the chief pleasure I proposed to myself was to see him sometimes&quot;.

==Marriage and children==
Temple married Dorothy Osborne (d. 1695), a daughter of Sir Peter Osborne and Dorothy Danvers, in 1654. It was a love marriage and the couple were noted for constancy during their long engagement: Dorothy resisted pressure from her family to accept any of several other more eligible suitors, including Henry Cromwell and her cousin Thomas Osborne, 1st Duke of Leeds. She and William outlived all of their nine children, most of whom died in infancy; the suicide of their adult son John in 1689 was the greatest tragedy of their lives. Dorothy died in 1695 and after her death William&#x27;s strong-minded sister Martha, Lady Giffard kept house for him. She had married Sir Thomas Giffard in 1662 and been widowed young; she spent many years with William and Dorothy, for both of whom she had a deep affection. In her last years she wrote a short Life of her brother which was published in 1728 after her death in 1722. However Martha believed that Jonathon Swift had lifted parts of her biography to include in his &quot;Memoirs of Sir William Temple, Part 3&quot;, although Swift denied her accusation.

Sir William and Dorothy Osborne&#x27;s children included:

*John Temple (d. 1689), who &quot;as a compliment to his father&quot; was made Paymaster General and, on 12 April 1689, Secretary at War in succession to William Blathwayt. A few days later, having filled his pockets with stones, he threw himself from a boat into the strong current beneath London Bridge, and was drowned. The suicide, which created the greatest sensation at the time, was probably due to official anxiety, aggravated by the treachery of a confidential agent whom he had recommended to the king. He married Marie du Plessis-Rambouillet, daughter of Paul du Plessis-Rambouillet of France, of a Huguenot family, by whom he left two daughters: 
**Elizabeth Temple of Moor Park, who married her cousin, John Temple (d. 1753), second son of Sir John Temple, Speaker of the Irish House of Commons, but left no issue; 
**Dorothy Temple, who married Nicholas Bacon (1686–1767) of Shrubland Hall, Coddenham, Suffolk, and left issue. His funeral hatchment showing the arms of Temple survives in Coddenham Church.

Letters written by Dorothy to Temple before their marriage have been published in a number of editions.

==Retirement and gardening==
Temple saw his retirement from political life to his country estate at Moor Park as following the example of the Greek philosopher Epicurus. In his essay of 1685 (first published in 1690), &quot;Upon the Gardens of Epicurus&quot; Temple wrote of &quot;the sweetness and satisfaction of this retreat, where since my resolution taken of never entering again into any public employments, I have passed five years without once going to town&quot;. As a result of his introducing the term &quot;sharawadgi&quot; in this essay, Temple has been sometimes considered the originator of the English landscape garden style.

As a garden writer, Temple was rather typical of his period in England, but perhaps to an extreme degree, in being highly interested in growing fruit trees of all sorts and very little interested in flowers:I will not enter upon any Account of Flowers, having only pleased my self with seeing and smelling them, and not troubled my self with the Care, which is more the Ladies Part than the Mens; but the Success is wholly in the Gardener.

The passage in which Temple outlines the concept of &quot;Sharawadgi&quot; or &quot;Sharawaggi&quot; is the following:Amongst us, the Beauty of Building and Planting is placed chiefly in some Proportions, Symmetries and Uniformities; our Walks and our Trees ranged so, as to answer one another, and at exact Distances. The &quot;Chineses&quot; scorn this way of Planting, and say a Boy that can tell an Hundred, may plant Walks of Trees in strait Lines, and over-against one another, and to what Length and Extent he pleases. But their greatest reach of Imagination, is employed in contriving Figures, where the Beauty shall be great, and strike the Eye, but without any Order or Disposition of Parts, that shall be commonly or easily observ&#x27;d. And though we have hardly any Notion of this sort of Beauty, yet they have a particular word to express it; and where they find it hit their Eye at first Sight, they say the &quot;Sharawadgi&quot; is fine or is admirable, or any such Expression of Esteem. And whoever observes the Work upon the best &quot;Indian&quot; gowns, or the Painting on their best Skreens and Purcellans, will find their Beauty is all of this Kind, (that is) without Order. But I should hardly advise any of these Attempts in the Figure of Gardens among us; they are Adventures of too hard Atchievement for any common hands; and tho&#x27; there may be more Honour if they succeed well, yet there is more Dishonour if they fail, and &#x27;tis Twenty to One they will; whereas in regular Figures, &#x27;tis hard to make any great and remarkable Faults.

In 1690, Temple intervened in the debate about the difference between the ancients and the moderns with his essay &quot;On Ancient and Modern Learning&quot;, and his prose style was praised by later critics. Hume called it negligent and infected by foreign idioms, but agreeable and interesting; not like the perusal of a book, but conversation with a companion. Samuel Johnson called him &quot;the first writer who gave cadence to English prose. Before his time they were careless of arrangement, and did not mind whether a sentence ended with an important word or an insignificant word, or with what part of speech it was concluded&quot;. His style was also highly praised by Swift. Macaulay called his prose singularly lucid and melodious.

==Death==
Temple died on 27 January 1699. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, but his heart, by his special wish, was placed in a silver casket under the sun-dial at Moor Park, near his favourite window seat. Swift recorded, &quot;He died at one o clock in the morning and with him all that was great and good among men&quot;.

==Bibliography==
His literary works consist for the most part of essays, which were published as &quot;Miscellanea&quot; in volumes in the 1690s, then collected by Swift and given a collected volume in 1720. However, he did write some longer pieces such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Essay on the Original and Nature of Government&quot;.

<text>Frederick Tennyson (5 June 1807 in Louth, Lincolnshire – 26 February 1898 in Kensington) was an English poet.

==Life==

Frederick Tennyson was the eldest son of George Clayton Tennyson, Rector of Somersby, Lincolnshire, and brother of Alfred, Lord Tennyson. He was educated at Eton College (where, as a skilled cricketer, he was Captain of the Oppidans) and, from 1827, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. While at Cambridge he contributed four poems to &quot;Poems, by Two Brothers&quot;, which Frederick, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, and their brother Charles Tennyson Turner published in 1827. He also won the Browne medal for Greek verse composition (a Sapphic ode on the pyramids) in 1828, but was rusticated for three terms for refusal to accept punishment for not attending chapel. Re-admitted to Cambridge in 1830, he graduated BA in 1832.

Tennyson passed most of his subsequent life in Italy and Jersey. On his inheritance of an estate near Grimsby in 1833, he went firstly to Corfu, then settled for twenty years in Florence, where he was a friend of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. In 1839 he married Maria Carolina Giuliotti, the daughter of the Chief magistrate of Tuscany.

He became an Anglo-Israelite and later joined the Church of the New Jerusalem.

He died on the 26th February 1898 and is buried on the west side of Highgate Cemetery.

<doc id="1271624" wikidata="Q1149831" url="?curid=1271624" title="Legends (comics)">
<text>&quot;Legends&quot; is a comic book crossover story line that ran through a six-issue, self-titled limited series and various other titles published by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987. Each of the individual crossover/tie-in issues had a &quot;Legends Chapter #&quot; header added to their trade dress.

The series was plotted by John Ostrander, scripted by Len Wein, pencilled by John Byrne, and inked by Karl Kesel.

==Publication history==
The six issues of the &quot;Legends&quot; series could be read as an abbreviated story by themselves, or all 22 chapters could be read as a longer story that included the &quot;Legends&quot; issues as well as issues from other titles including &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, and &quot;Secret Origins&quot;. It was also the first major DC Universe crossover after the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;.

&quot;Legends&quot; served mainly as a launching pad for several new comic series, including the latter-day &quot;Flash&quot; title, Keith Giffen and J. M. DeMatteis&#x27; comedy/action take on the &quot;Justice League&quot;, and the villain-based black ops &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;. The series also saw the post-Crisis introduction into the DC Universe of Captain Marvel (who was spun off in the miniseries &quot;Shazam!: The New Beginning&quot;) as well as Wonder Woman, who had been rebooted by DC Comics at the same time &quot;Legends&quot; was being published.

==Plot==
Darkseid makes a wager with the mysterious Phantom Stranger that he can turn humanity against its heroes. To win the bet, Darkseid sends his minion Glorious Godfrey to Earth, where Godfrey uses the sound of his voice to control people&#x27;s minds and turn them against Earth&#x27;s heroes. To further his scheme, Darkseid sends a fire elemental called Brimstone to Earth to defeat the Detroit-based Justice League along with Firestorm and a time-traveling Cosmic Boy. Darkseid also arranges for the cyborg villain Macro-Man to be killed by the mystic lightning that Captain Marvel uses to change into Billy Batson, and Captain Marvel is blamed by the media for Macro-Man&#x27;s death. Batman suffers his own loss when Robin (Jason Todd) is trampled by a crazed mob. Fearing widespread panic, President Ronald Reagan (the U.S. Commander-in-Chief at the time of publication) declares martial law and bans all superheroic activities in America. This angers several members of Reagan&#x27;s department of defense, who - at the behest of Amanda Waller - activate &quot;Project: Task Force X&quot;, a.k.a. the Suicide Squad. Recruiting a team of expendable imprisoned supervillains, Amanda Waller has the Suicide Squad destroy Brimstone.

Doctor Fate is forced to intervene when Godfrey uses his army of followers to invade Washington, DC. Dr. Fate organizes Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, Guy Gardner, Black Canary, Changeling, The Flash, and the Blue Beetle to oppose Godfrey. They are joined by the Martian Manhunter, who responds to a JLA distress call from the President. They manage to defeat Godfrey&#x27;s forces, including Darkseid&#x27;s cyborg Hounds of War. The masses are subsequently freed from Godfrey&#x27;s power when Robin gathers an army of children untouched by his powers to serve as a human shield between the heroes and Godfrey. Godfrey strikes one of the children, and the shock frees the mob from his power. Godfrey is defeated when he steals Dr. Fate&#x27;s helmet and puts it on, rendering him mindless. In the aftermath, the Martian Manhunter, Batman, Blue Beetle, Guy Gardner, Black Canary, Captain Marvel and Dr. Fate form a new Justice League. Superman and the Flash decline membership, stating that they will assist if needed, Wonder Woman quietly exits and Changeling opts to remain with the Teen Titans.

<text>Mary Tighe (9 October 1772 – 24 March 1810) was an Irish poet.

==Life and career==
Mary Blachford (or Blanchford) (or Blackford) was born in Dublin, 9 October 1772. Her parents were Theodosia Tighe, a Methodist leader, and William Blachford (d.1773?), a Church of Ireland clergyman and librarian. She had a strict religious upbringing, and when she was twenty-one she married Henry Tighe (1768–1836), her first cousin and a member of the Parliament of Ireland for Inistioge, County Kilkenny. The marriage is said to have been unhappy, though little is known.

The couple moved to London in the early nineteenth century. She became acquainted with Thomas Moore, an early admirer of her writing, and others interested in literature. Although she had written since girlhood, she published nothing until &quot;Psyche&quot; (1805), a six-canto allegorical poem in Spenserian stanzas. &quot;Psyche&quot; was admired by many and praised by Moore in his poem, &quot;To Mrs. Henry Tighe on reading her Psyche&quot;.

Having suffered for at least a year, Mary Tighe endured a serious attack of tuberculosis in 1805. In February 1805 Moore states that she had &quot;a very serious struggle for life&quot; and in August of the same year that she was &#x27;ordered to the Madeiras&#x27;. Moore also claimed that &quot;another winter will inevitably be her death&quot;. Tighe lived for another five years and spent her last few months as an invalid at her brother-in-law&#x27;s estate in Woodstock, County Kilkenny, Ireland. She was buried in the church at nearby Inistioge. Her diary was destroyed, though a cousin had copied out excerpts.

The year following her death, a new edition of &quot;Psyche&quot; was released, along with some previously unpublished poems; it was this edition that established her literary reputation. John Keats was one of her admirers and paid tribute to her in his poem, &quot;To Some Ladies&quot;. Pam Perkins writes that &quot;[d]espite the bleakness of many of the short poems in the 1811 volume, in much of the nineteenth-century writing on Tighe there is a tendency to make her an exemplar of patiently (and picturesquely) long-suffering femininity, a tendency exemplified most famously in Felicia Hemans&#x27;s tribute to her, &#x27;The Grave of a Poetess&#x27;.&quot;

A statue of her was sculpted by Lorenzo Bartolini, and was held at Woodstock House until it was burned down in 1922. According to the Uffizi, the statue was commissioned by her son after her death, and was delivered to Ireland around 1820.

== &quot;Psyche&quot; ==
&quot;Psyche, or the legend of love&quot; is Mary Tighe&#x27;s rendition of the Greco-Roman folktale of Cupid and Psyche, which is recorded in &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; (or &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;) by Lucius Apuleius, the Silver Age Roman author. &quot;Psyche, or the Legend of Love&quot; was privately printed in a run of only 50 copies in 1805. It was republished posthumously in 1811 with other, previously unpublished works by Longman, London.

The story is about a princess named Psyche who is so beautiful that the people of her kingdom begin to worship her as the goddess Venus. Venus becomes envious of the attention that Psyche receives and sends her son Cupid to Psyche to make her fall in love with a monster. Instead Cupid falls in love with Psyche, and marries her without his mother&#x27;s knowledge. He whisks her away to a far-away palace, where she is served by invisible servants, and he visits her only at night, so she cannot discover his true identity. One night Psyche&#x27;s curiosity gets the better of her, and after he falls asleep she lights a lamp to see her husband&#x27;s face. When she realises her husband is no monster, rather a god, she is so surprised a drop of oil falls from her lamp and burns Cupid, waking him. He flees, and to regain her husband Psyche seeks the help of his mother Venus, who sends her out to complete various tasks in penance. In her final task, she is sent to retrieve a box from the underworld containing some of Proserpina&#x27;s beauty. Although instructed not to look inside the box, she opens it, and Psyche is overcome by a never-ending sleep. Cupid saves her, and in the end Psyche is transformed into a goddess herself by Jupiter.The bulk of Tighe&#x27;s version of the story is taken from Apuleius, but her poem, written in Spenserian stanzas, is riddled with small details which point to Cupid&#x27;s and Psyche&#x27;s shared characteristics and equal standing, implying that their love is mutual, and this idea is taken further in the heavily adapted second half of the epic, where Cupid joins Psyche on her penitent journey. In the first encounter between the two lovers, Tighe mirrors a passage from Apuleius but reverses the roles, showing the similarities between the two. As Cupid comes to Psyche at his mother&#x27;s request, ready to use his love-inducing arrows, he leans over her, but is then overcome by her beauty and:
:The dart which in his hand now trembling stood, 
:As o&#x27;er the couch he bent with ravished eye, 
:Drew with its daring point celestial blood 
:From his smooth neck&#x27;s unblemished ivory: (canto 1, 244–247). 
Much of the same imagery is found in the Metamorphoses, but later in Apuleius’ narrative, as Psyche is overcome at the sight of Cupid and the weapons that testify to his divinity. Tighe was familiar with the ancient novel, so this similarity is likely deliberate. In his novel, Apuleius wrote:
:Now Psyche, with her insatiable mind, examined these with more than a little curiosity, and as she was studying and admiring the weapons of her husband, trembling she drew one arrow from the quiver to test the point on the tip of her thumb, but she pressed too deeply, so that tiny drops of rosy-red blood dotted her skin like dew. Thus did unknowing Psyche suddenly fall in love with Love, burning more and more with desire for Desire. (Apuleius, Metamorphoses, 5.23).

The many similarities between the two passages strengthen the relationship and the comparison between the two figures. Arrows are held with “trembling” hands, blood stains perfect skin, and neither is aware of the fateful prick. In Tighe&#x27;s version, Cupid is as much a victim of himself as Psyche is, and she makes explicit that her feelings are mutual. In a major departure from Apuleius’ storyline, Cupid accompanies Psyche on her series of trials, disguised as a on his own journey to regain his beloved. This unique element of Tighe&#x27;s narrative serves to emphasise the equal responsibility of both genders in romantic relationships. When the white knight first introduces himself to Psyche, hiding his true identity as Cupid, he tells her:
:“I too (he said) divided from my love, 
:“The offended power of Venus deprecate, 
:“Like thee, through paths untrodden, sadly rove 
:“In search of that fair spot prescribed by fate, 
:“The blessed term of my afflicted state,” (canto 3, 127–131).
By describing him thus, Cupid becomes a male version of Psyche, needing to perform his own series of trials to become worthy of his lover. The tasks Venus sends them to do cease to be a form of penance and become a mutual journey, and both lovers grow as individuals, helping each other to defeat various vices and temptations, in a very moralising and Christian version of the Roman tale.

She also makes allusions to Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Fairie Queene&quot; during Psyche&#x27;s final task set by Venus. &quot;A cruel monster now her steps pursued, Well known of yore and named the Blatant Beast.

<text>John Tobin (28 January 17707 December 1804) was a British playwright, who was for most of his life unsuccessful, but in the year of his death made a hit with &quot;The Honey Moon&quot;. Other plays were &quot;The Curfew&quot; and &quot;The School for Authors&quot;.

==Life==
Tobin was born in Salisbury, the son of James Tobin, a merchant, and his wife, born Webbe, the daughter of a rich West India sugar planter. George Tobin was his elder brother. Another brother, James Webbe Tobin (died 1814), an acquaintance of Charles Lamb and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, went to Nevis. About 1775 the father set out with his wife to Nevis in the West Indies. The children were left behind, and John was placed for a while under the care of Dr. Richard Mant, the father of Richard Mant the bishop, at Southampton. After the American War of Independence, James Tobin having returned to England and settled at Redland, near Bristol, John was sent to Bristol Grammar School under Dr. Charles Lee. In 1787 he left Bristol to be articled to a solicitor in Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and, some ten years later, on his employer&#x27;s death without a successor, he took over the practice in partnership with three other clerks in the office. Dissensions arose, and the arrangement broke down. Tobin eventually entered a new firm.

From 1789, Tobin had devoted time to dramatic composition. He imitated Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the Elizabethans, and Gay or Foote. Tobin approached managers thirteen times with different pieces without success. One of them, &quot;The Faro Table&quot;, was provisionally accepted by Sheridan, but then rejected. The manager of Drury Lane dallied in a similar manner with his picturesque drama &quot;The Curfew&quot;. In 1800 his &quot;School for Authors&quot;, which afterwards achieved success, was rejected, and it was not until April 1803 that he (due to the good opinion of Joseph Shepherd Munden) saw a piece of his own on the boards, a farce, &quot;All&#x27;s Fair in Love&quot;. In 1804, having submitted his fourteenth production, a romantic play in blank verse called &#x27;The Honey Moon,&#x27; to the management at Drury Lane (it had failed to win acceptance at Covent Garden), he left his rooms near the Temple and went for his health to Cornwall. He then heard that &quot;The Honey Moon&quot; had been accepted; but in the meantime symptoms of consumption had manifested themselves. He was told that to save his life he must winter in the West Indies. He set sail accordingly on 7 December 1804, but died the first day out. The ship put back, and he was buried in the little churchyard of Cove, near Cork, where the remains of Charles Wolfe, author of the &quot;Burial of Sir John Moore&quot;, were laid nineteen years later. Tobin was unmarried.

==Works==
&quot;The Honey Moon&quot; was given at Drury Lane on 31 January 1805, with Elliston and Bannister in the leading rôles, and proved a decided success. It remained a favourite on the English stage for twenty years. Hazlitt thought the plot owed much to the &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot;; John Genest detected reminiscences of Massinger and other Elizabethans. Tobin excelled at light comedies and stage lyrics. After his early death, his rejected pieces were sought after by managers.

Tobin&#x27;s works, all posthumously published, were:
* &#x27;The Honey Moon: a comedy&#x27; (five acts, mainly verse), London, 1805; New York, 1807; frequently reprinted, translated by Charles Nodier as &#x27;La Lune de Miel&#x27; in &#x27;Chefs d&#x27;œuvre des Théâtres Étrangers,&#x27; 1822.
* &#x27;The Curfew: a play&#x27; (in five acts, prose and verse), London, 1807; 7th edit. 1807. It was produced at Drury Lane on 19 February 1807, and would have run longer than twenty nights but for Sheridan&#x27;s anxiety to avoid the obligation of a benefit for Tobin&#x27;s relatives.
* &#x27;The School for Authors: a comedy&#x27; (in three acts, prose), London, 1808. Based on &#x27;The Connoisseur,&#x27; one of Marmontel&#x27;s tales; the part of Diaper, the sensitive author, afforded a triumph to Munden when he created the rôle at Covent Garden on 5 Dec. 1808.
* &#x27;The Faro Table; or the Guardians: a comedy&#x27; London, 1816. This was given at Drury Lane on 5 November 1816, or nearly twenty years after it had been written, when the manners it satirises were already passing away; it was not a success.

Several of Tobin&#x27;s unpublished dramas were published in one volume in 1820; among them &#x27;The Gypsy of Madrid,&#x27; after the &#x27;Gitanilla&#x27; of De Solis, &#x27;The Indians,&#x27; and two light operas, &#x27;Yours or Mine&#x27; and &#x27;The Fisherman.&#x27; Among other pieces by him, apparently no longer extant, are mentioned &#x27;The Reconciliation,&#x27; &#x27;The Undertaker,&#x27; and &#x27;Attraction.&#x27;

<doc id="1271644" wikidata="Q2616608" url="?curid=1271644" title="Edward John Trelawny">
<text>Edward John Trelawny (13 November 179213 August 1881) was a British biographer, novelist and adventurer who is best known for his friendship with the Romantic poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. Trelawny was born to a family of modest income but extensive ancestral history. Though his father became wealthy while he was a child, Edward had an antagonistic relationship with him. After an unhappy childhood, he was sent away to a school. He was assigned as a volunteer in the Royal Navy shortly before he turned thirteen.

Trelawny served on multiple ships as a naval volunteer while in his teen years. He traveled to India and saw combat during engagements with the French Navy. He did not care for the naval lifestyle, however, and left at nineteen years of age without becoming a commissioned officer. After retiring from the navy, he had a brief and unhappy marriage in England. He then moved to Switzerland and later Italy where he met Shelley and Byron. He became friends with the two poets, and helped teach them about sailing. He enjoyed inventing elaborate stories about his time in the navy, and in one he claimed to have deserted and become a pirate in India. After Shelley&#x27;s death, Trelawny identified his body and arranged the funeral and burial.

Trelawny then travelled to Greece with Lord Byron in order to fight in the Greek War of Independence. Byron and Trelawny split up near Greece and Trelawny travelled into Greece to act as the agent of Lord Byron. After Byron died, Trelawny oversaw the preparations for the funeral and the return of his body to England. He also wrote his obituaries. Trelawny joined the cause of the Greek Revolutionary Odysseas Androutsos and helped to provide him with additional arms. He also married Androutsos&#x27; sister Tarsitsa. After Androutsos fell out of favour with the Greek government and was arrested, Trelawny took control of his mountain fortress. During this time, Trelawny survived an assassination attempt. After leaving Greece, he divorced Tarsitsa and returned to England, where he was well received by members of London society. He then wrote a memoir titled &quot;Adventures of a Younger Son&quot;. After the book was published he travelled to America for two years before returning to Britain. He then became politically active but soon remarried and moved to the Welsh countryside.

He then lived the life of a country squire for 12 years and raised a family with his third wife. They eventually separated and he moved back to London with a mistress. He then wrote a well received book about Shelley and Byron. He soon became friends with several prominent artists and writers in London. He was able to share his firsthand experience with Romantic-era writers with the leading Victorian writers of the day. He later retired to Sompting, where he led an ascetic lifestyle. He died in Sompting at the age of 88, having outlived almost all of his friends from the Romantic era.

==Early life==
Trelawny&#x27;s birthplace is unknown, although he claimed that he was born in Cornwall. Some of his biographers have contended that he was actually born in London, as he was baptised in Marylebone as John Trelawney on 29 November 1792. His father, Charles Trelawny-Brereton (a descendant of Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 2nd Baronet, who married Mary, daughter of Sir Edward Seymour, 2nd Baronet, a descendant of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset) was a British military officer who retired after reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. His mother, Maria Hawkins, was of Cornish descent. She had inherited a small sum of money from her father, but the family soon spent most of the inheritance. When Edward was six years of age, his father inherited a large sum of money from one of his wealthy cousins. The family soon used the inheritance to move to London, where they lived in a large house. As a condition of receiving the inheritance, his father was required to adopt the last name &quot;Brereton&quot;. His cousin, Owen Brereton, wished to have his last name continued along with his wealth. They lived in Cheshire while Edward was a young man.

At some point in his youth, he began referring to himself as Edward, which was the name used by most of his friends. Later in his life he referred to himself as &quot;John Edward&quot; for several years. Edward later recalled that his father had a fierce temper. He described his father&#x27;s disposition as often &quot;tyrannical&quot;. His father also tried to calculate the financial worth of all his relatives and kept detailed records of the numbers. In addition to his father, many of Edward Trelawny&#x27;s other ancestors had strong tempers, as well. His elder uncle on his mother&#x27;s side, Sir Christopher Hawkins was also wealthy. He held a seat in the House of Commons and in 1809 Trelawny&#x27;s father also became a Member of the British Parliament. As a child, he was often told of the long history and adventures of his ancestors in the Trelawny family. As an adult, he was proud of having such prestigious ancestors. The recorded history of his family dated back to the reign of Edward the Confessor and included many prominent citizens.

Edward had five siblings who survived to adulthood and several who died as children. Edward shared a disdain for his father with his siblings. Though he hated his father, Edward was close with his mother. His mother worked hard to find wealthy husbands for her daughters, to the extent that her actions were satirised by some. In addition, many people found her to be a disagreeable person as she grew older. Trelawny&#x27;s parents regarded their children as potential sinners and frequently used harsh measures to try to instill a sense of discipline in them. He resented being treated in this manner.

Edward only had one brother, Harry Trelawny. They were close in age and were close friends during their childhood. Harry was quiet and reserved, which sharply contrasted with Edward&#x27;s extroverted and confrontational personality.

As an adult, Edward Trelawny often told stories about his childhood that focused on his early willingness to take confrontational positions and conceal things from others. One often used story described the time that he killed a vicious raven which had belonged to his father. He cited this event as an example of his habit of accepting offences up to a certain point before later taking revenge as the offences mounted. He later described the raven incident in his autobiography, &quot;Adventures of a Younger Son&quot;. In the book he described the fight with the raven as the &quot;most awful duel&quot; that he ever had.

==Education==
At the age of eight Charles Brereton decided to send Edward to live at the Seyer school, which was located two miles from their home in Bristol at that time. Trelawny later claimed that his father had resisted sending him to the school for some time due to its cost, but decided to enroll him after he caught him stealing apples from an orchard in the back yard. Trelawny hated the school and was angry at his father for sending him there. He often complained that the school served terrible food and subjected him to frequent flogging as a form of punishment. In addition to flogging, one of his classmates recorded that caning was a frequent method of punishment there, as well. The school&#x27;s treatment of its students was actually comparable to many other schools of that time. He was also bullied and treated cruelly by other students there.

The schoolmaster there frequently condemned the French Revolution. These condemnations may have given Trelawny an early sympathy with revolutionary ideals. He was expelled from the school after two years due to violent behaviour towards teachers as well as starting fires after being confined in his room as punishment.

==Naval career==

Charles Brereton had originally hoped that his sons would attend Oxford. He became disappointed by the slow pace of Edward&#x27;s learning as a child. In October 1805, shortly before his thirteenth birthday, he enrolled Edward in the Royal Navy as a first class volunteer. The younger sons of the gentry traditionally entered the military at that time. His family enrolled him as early as they could because seniority was crucial to career advancement at that time.

His first experiences in the navy were serving on ships that had returned from the Battle of Trafalgar with many badly wounded sailors. In November he was transferred to &quot;Temeraire&quot; and then to &quot;Colossus&quot;. He later attended a naval school in Portsmouth. In 1806 he served aboard HMS &quot;Woolwich&quot;. While serving on &quot;Woolwich&quot; he travelled to the Cape of Good Hope and to St. Helena. In 1808 he moved to the frigate &quot;Resistance&quot;, and in 1809 to the frigate &quot;Cornelia&quot;. While serving aboard &quot;Cornelia&quot; he travelled to Bombay. Trelawny&#x27;s name was entered on the books of HMS &quot;Superb&quot; as volunteer first class in October 1812.

Trelawny was initially happy to have joined the navy and enjoyed the rough lifestyle there. He often exaggerated his age while he was in the navy. Some biographers believe he commanded a vessel as a midshipman in an engagement with the French at Mauritius in 1810. Some also believe that he was wounded engaging the French in Java in August 1811. He left the Navy in 1812 at the age of 19; receiving a final settlement of pay in 1815. He had grown to resent the discipline of the Navy due in part to the frequent punishment that he experienced. He was often sent to the masthead for several hours at a time. During that time, he frequently entertained fantasies of mutiny and desertion. Some biographers believe that Trelawny was inspired by hearing accounts of the French pirate Robert Surcouf. He was never commissioned as a lieutenant, though many of his contemporaries were. This disappointed him, although he began referring to himself as Lieutenant Trelawny anyway.

==First marriage==
Trelawny returned to England in 1812. Soon after he arrived he fell in love with Caroline, daughter of John Addison, of Bengal. She was several years younger than he but as well educated; she had studied French and was a skilled pianist. Though both of their families disapproved of the match they were not dissuaded. Trelawny&#x27;s father was particularly infuriated by his son&#x27;s disobedience. They were married in May 1813 and first lived in London before moving to Bristol. After their first daughter was born in 1814, they experienced financial difficulties that forced Trelawny to ask his father for money. Although he had a mutually disdainful relationship with his father, he was able to secure extra funds. Edward and Caroline soon became unhappy, causing Edward to begin leaving home often to spend time with his friends or to travel to the theatre by himself. Their second child was born in 1816.

Caroline soon began having an affair with a much older man, a naval captain named Coleman. They successfully hid the affair from Trelawny for some time; he discovered it long after many others had known. Although he dearly wished to fight a duel with Coleman, he simply filed for divorce instead. The proceedings were well covered in many of London&#x27;s &quot;penny press&quot; tabloid papers. This publicity caused Trelawny tremendous frustration and humiliation. The divorce order was granted in July 1817, but was not finalised until 1819. Caroline was granted custody of the elder child and Edward kept the younger.

==Studies==
Trelawny&#x27;s father soon attempted to purchase him a commission in the British Army, but he refused to consider joining the army. His father was furious at his refusal, leading to their estrangement. Brereton became estranged with Harry around the same time, due to a marriage that he entered into against his father&#x27;s wishes. Edward began staying with a former landlord whom he had befriended. She helped him find someone to take care of his child. Trelawny then began using the name &quot;Edward&quot; rather than &quot;John&quot;.

Due in part to the short time he spent in school, Trelawny struggled with spelling as a young man. He often spelled phonetically. This caused him significant difficulties when he tried to correspond with his friends. His spelling indicated a strong Westcountry accent. His parents were concerned about this, particularly his habit of occasionally misspelling his own name. His problem with spelling might have been due to dyslexia, evidence for which has been provided by one of Trelawny&#x27;s biographers. After he left the Navy he read voraciously. He often read Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and attended the theatres in Covent Garden. He began incorporating references to Shakespeare in his personal letters. He also enjoyed reading the works of Lord Byron, including &quot;Childe Harold&#x27;s Pilgrimage&quot;. During this time he also accompanied his mother and sisters on a trip to Paris.

==Switzerland==
Even though they often quarrelled, Charles Brereton continued to provide Trelawny with an allowance. He received an allowance of £300 a year, which was roughly the same amount as retired captains received as a pension at that time. He began to present himself as Captain Edward Trelawny, Royal Navy, Retired. He decided to leave England to find a cheaper place to live. After initially considering a move to Buenos Aires, he decided to move to Switzerland. In Switzerland he was not directly affected by the inflation that was occurring in England. After moving to Geneva he soon became bored by the city and spent much of his time on hunting and fishing expeditions. In the summer of 1820, while staying in Lausanne, Trelawny befriended a local bookseller. The bookseller soon recommended to him that he read &quot;Queen Mab&quot; by Percy Bysshe Shelley. This was the first time that he had heard of Percy Shelley. He read &quot;Queen Mab&quot; and he greatly enjoyed the work.

He soon met Edward Ellerker Williams and Thomas Medwin at the home of a friend in Geneva. He had served on the same ship as Williams in the navy, although not at the same time. They also introduced him to the work of Percy Bysshe Shelley.

In the fall of 1820 Trelawny learned that his father had died and returned to England from Switzerland. After arriving in England he learned that he only had received a much smaller inheritance than he had expected. He was sorely disappointed and soon returned to Switzerland.

==Pisa==
In early 1822 he travelled to Pisa to meet Edward Ellerker Williams and his wife Jane, Thomas Medwin, Percy Bysshe and Mary Shelley, and Lord Byron. Trelawny greatly enjoyed meeting Percy and Mary Shelley after having looked forward to meeting them for some time. He also met Mary&#x27;s half-sister Claire Clairmont. Trelawny began spending much of his time with Mary Shelley. He often accompanied her to parties because Percy Shelley refused to do so.

In their age, class origin, and preferences, Trelawny resembled Percy Shelley, whose attitude toward authority figures he began to emulate. Mary Shelley enjoyed his company, and she was fascinated by the stories that Trelawny told of his naval career: &quot;Trelalawny is extravagant—&quot;un giovanni stravagante&quot;… He tells strange stories of himself, horrific ones.&quot; Trelawny was a figure of great interest to these Romantic friends, for his lack of wealth and education was offset by the adventurous experiences that he had lived through, and which Byron had only written about. In fact, Byron once described Trelawny as the &quot;personification of my Corsair&quot;.

Trelawney often exaggerated his adventures, especially when discussing the details of his naval career. For example, he claimed that he had deserted the navy and formed a band of pirates that traveled throughout Asia and fought the British Navy. Descriptions of his adventures often included duels and romance, such as his marrying an Arab girl name Zella who was later poisoned by a jealous rival. This kind of embellishment or exaggeration was common in his stories about his past, and his biographers have been divided as to whether he intentionally created a persona that he presented to the world, or if he really believed the stories that he created.

Trelawny greatly enjoyed his time in Pisa. He practised boxing and fencing with his friends. He frequently attended theaters with them at night. He also enjoyed listening to Jane Williams sing and play songs with the guitar that Shelley had given to her.

In March, Trelawny was involved in a high-profile confrontation. The incident began when an Italian soldier confronted Count John Taafe, who was travelling with Shelley, Trelawny, Byron, and Byron&#x27;s entourage. Although Shelley was slightly wounded as he fell from his horse chasing after the soldier, one of Byron&#x27;s servants later caught the soldier and wounded him severely. The incident was controversial and received a significant amount of publicity in Pisa. This was in part due to the anti-English sentiment that existed there at that time. After a lengthy investigation by the Italian authorities, Trelawny and his friends were cleared of all charges that had been pending against them.

Shelley and Edward Williams had wanted to begin sailing for some time, and Trelawny used his naval experience to help them make plans. Together they decided to have an American-style schooner constructed; he had often observed this type of boat during his time in the navy. After Shelley and Williams had constructed their boat, the &quot;Don Juan&quot;, Trelawny was hired by Byron to be the Captain of his vessel, the &quot;Bolivar&quot;. Trelawny also moved into a room in Byron&#x27;s mansion at that time. Trelawny&#x27;s friend Daniel Roberts designed and supervised the construction of both vessels. The construction of the &quot;Bolivar&quot; cost £750, a sum which Byron found irritatingly high.
Trelawny had planned to accompany the &quot;Don Juan&quot; in the &quot;Bolivar&quot; during the voyage in which the &quot;Don Juan&quot; sank. He was held back by the Port Authority because he was not carrying his port clearance with him, though he had sailed without bringing his clearance several times in the past. After Shelley and Williams did not return to their home by the time that they were expected, Jane Williams and Mary Shelley informed Trelawny that their husbands were missing. He began making urgent inquiries and attempted to find news about them. For the next several days, he frequently met with members of the Italian Coast Guard and promised them rewards if they were able to find the boat.

After Shelley&#x27;s body was found, Trelawny was able to confirm the identity of the body. He then notified their wives and escorted Mary and Jane to Pisa for the funeral. Trelawny made the arrangements for the cremation and oversaw the ceremony. After Shelley&#x27;s body was cremated, Trelawny removed what he thought was Shelley&#x27;s unburned heart from the fire. He later wrote a full account of the funeral. He also arranged to have a memorial built at Shelley&#x27;s final resting place in Rome. Trelawny then reserved a spot for himself in the same cemetery.

After the funeral, Trelawny went on a hunting trip with Daniel Roberts. After he returned, he soon developed tension with Byron, in part due to Byron&#x27;s habit of leaving bills unpaid. This often put Trelawny in a difficult position as the captain of his boat. Byron sold the &quot;Bolivar&quot; for 400 guineas in late 1822. This left Trelawny unemployed. He split his time between Genoa and Albaro, and hunted often. He began spending much of his time with Mary Shelley and he supplied the funds for her to return to England. Trelawny soon fell in love with Claire Clairmont. She ultimately spurned his proposals, however. He decided to move after his mother found his address and began sending him letters.

==Greece==
Shelley had been supportive of the idea of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire before he died. In June 1823 Byron decided to go to Greece to fight for independence, and Trelawny enthusiastically accompanied him. With the assistance of Captain Daniel Roberts, Byron chartered a boat named &quot;Hercules&quot; to transport them there. During the voyage, Trelawny and Byron sometimes irritated each other. They often joined in swimming, boxing, and fencing together during the trip. They also practised their aim by shooting ducks for target practice. They initially spent much time together because the rest of Byron&#x27;s entourage suffered from seasickness and were unable to participate in their activities. On the voyage, &quot;Byron sometimes expressed his intention, should his services prove of no avail to Greece, of endeavouring to obtain by purchase, or otherwise, some small island in the South Sea, to which, after visiting England, he might retire for the remainder of his life, and very seriously asked Trelawny if he would accompany him, to which the latter, without hesitation, replied in the affirmative&quot;. After they arrived in the Ionian Islands, Byron decided to stay there for a while in order to consult with the London Greek Committee and other experts regarding the political situation in Greece before proceeding further. They then left him in Kefalonia and traveled to Greece. Byron approved of Trelawny&#x27;s plan to travel deeper into Greece and presented him with a sword and a letter of introduction shortly before he departed. Byron also asked them to soon return to him with more information.

After initially staying with a shepherd after they arrived in Greece, they travelled to Tripoli. Trelawny wore authentic Souliote dress on the journey. After arriving in Tripoli, Trelawny met with Alexandros Mavrokordatos whom he soon came to strongly dislike. He also met Theodoros Kolokotronis, whom he later came to admire. They traveled together to Salamis, on the journey Trelawny viewed the sites of previous battles. He recorded that he could see the bones of those who had been slain there. He spoke with many Greek leaders after arriving in Salamis. He was well respected as the agent of Lord Byron, whom they held in high esteem. He frequently corresponded with Lord Byron and encouraged him to come to Greece. He was disappointed when Byron did not come for some time, and that when he did come he came to territory that was overseen by Mavrokordatos. Trelawny, however, greatly enjoyed Corinth and Athens. Rumours later emerged that he purchased a harem of twelve to fifteen women while staying in Athens. However, some have maintained that he may have actually redeemed the women from slavery.

He soon left on a raiding expedition with the warlord Odysseas Androutsos, who controlled much of Eastern Greece. Trelawny thought highly of Odysseas, describing him as a brother and comparing him to George Washington and Simón Bolívar. During this time Trelawny commanded a group of twenty-five Arvanite soldiers. In the winter of 1823–24, Odysseas and his men fought several battles with the Turks and destroyed villages in the Euboea region. Trelawny lobbied Byron to send them more arms, but Byron decided to wait before shipping any to consider the political implications. Some have called into question the effectiveness of Odysseas&#x27; campaign and many view Byron&#x27;s delay as a polite refusal.

After Byron died in April 1824, Trelawny returned from an expedition with Odysseas. Trelawny claimed that upon arriving in Messolonghi, he began overseeing the funeral preparations. In the days before his death, Byron often said he wished Trelawny would return to him. Trelawny then wrote several accounts of Byron&#x27;s last years and sent them to papers in England. In these accounts he often exaggerated the role he played in Byron&#x27;s life. Shortly after Byron died, Trelawny reportedly took the opportunity to view his deformed foot with a servant of Byron&#x27;s.

==Mountain fortress==
Trelawny then began lobbying members of the London Greek Committee to fully support Odysseas. He also lobbied for a Greek Congress and criticised Mavrokordatos. In a letter to Mary Shelley Trelawny described Mavrokordatos as a &quot;miserable Jew&quot; and said that he hoped to see him beheaded. Trelawny was able to transfer some portions of weapons shipments from London to Odysseas. This was a controversial move among Greek leaders and the London Greek Committee, many of whom saw it as a foolish move. He also suggested that the Greek authorities should hire privateers to harass Turkish ships.

In May 1824 Trelawny brought a load of guns to the fortified cave in which Odysseas was based. He arrived with a British military officer, Whitcomb, and a military engineer, Fenton. Trelawny recorded that Odysseas commanded a force of 5,000 men, who killed over 20,000 people during their campaign. Odysseas and his men retired to Parnassus after they learned the Greek government would not give them more funds. The Greek Government had decided to try to raise a regular army and take power away from the warlords. The size of his force soon diminished.

Trelawny hoped to convince Odysseas to leave with him for the Ionian islands, but Odysseas refused. He also helped Odysseas hide some valuable antiquities; they were never found. Some sources claim that Odysseas was attempting to strike a deal with the Turks at that time. Trelawny soon married Tarsitsa, the half-sister of Odysseas. She was much younger than he, and was probably a teenager. Some have speculated that their wedding was performed by a local Greek Orthodox priest. Tarsitsa then lived with him in the cave. At this point Trelawny&#x27;s life had actually began to resemble many of the stories that he had previously constructed about his past. Word soon spread to England that Trelawny was working for the Turks with Odysseas now. Trelawny again tried to convince Odysseas to escape with him to the Ionian Islands in order to prevent the Greek government from arresting him. Odysseas was caught on his way to find a boat. He was charged with treason and imprisoned in Athens. Trelawny administered the cave in his absence.

===Assassination attempt===
Tension between Trelawny and his two English companions Fenton and Whitcomb had been growing. When a shooting match was proposed, Trelawny arrogantly said that even with a pistol he could outshoot the other two with rifles. During the contest, when Trelawny was checking the target, he was shot in the back by Whitcomb, who was urged on by Fenton. Fenton was quickly shot and killed by one of Trelawny&#x27;s Greek soldiers. Seeing this, Whitcomb tried to flee but was captured by soldiers. The soldiers initially hung Whitcomb off a cliff by his ankles as punishment, but Trelawny asked them to stop and they imprisoned the man. There was no doctor available and Trelawny lived on a diet of raw eggs that was suggested by his wife, who tended to him there. He needed to have a musket ball removed, however. His men soon kidnapped a Klept doctor and forced him to operate at gunpoint. The doctor&#x27;s efforts were unsuccessful. Although Trelawny was in poor condition for several weeks he eventually recovered. His living assailant was later released. The soldiers wanted to roast Whitcomb alive, but Trelawny insisted on releasing him.

Trelawny was bedridden for five weeks after he was shot. After word spread to England that Trelawny had survived, many of his relatives unsuccessfully lobbied the British government to extract him from Greece. The British Army Major D&#x27;Arcy Bacon learned of his situation and came to an agreement with Mavrokordatos to allow Trelawny to leave Greece. Bacon went searching for Trelawny and was captured by some of Odysseas&#x27; soldiers. They had mistaken him for a doctor and hoped that he would operate on Trelawny. A British Corvette sailed to Corinth to pick him up, Tarsitsa accompanied him. His story was widely published in English newspapers then. Some biographers believe that Fenton and Whitcomb were bribed by Mavrokordatos to kill Trelawny and give over the cave. Bacon successfully lobbied the Greek government to allow him to leave the country. Odysseas was executed in Athens shortly before the attempt on Trelawny&#x27;s life. Trelawny regained full use of his arm, but he walked with a slight hunch after recovering from his injury.

==Return to England==
Trelawny moved to Zante in May 1826 and stayed there for a year. There he lived next to the house of Thomas Gordon. While they were living in Zante, Tarsitsa gave birth to their first child, Zella.

He filed for divorce from Tarsitsa in 1827 in Kefalonia after four years of marriage. There were later rumours that Trelawny had been abusive towards her and had forbidden her to wear non-Greek clothing. Tarsitsa then moved into a nunnery and gave birth to their second child there. The child died at a young age, however. Tarsitsa was awarded a small alimony and soon left the nunnery to remarry. Her second husband was a Greek chieftain.

Trelawny then returned to England to visit his family in Cornwall. He also visited Mary Shelley, and asked her to consider entering a romantic relationship with him. She refused his offers, however. He also briefly visited Claire Clairmont in Italy in 1828. Though he was attracted to her, she too spurned his advances, although they did correspond up until her death in 1879.

In 1828 he began referring to himself as &quot;John Edward Trelawny&quot;, but he returned to &quot;Edward John Trelawny&quot; three years later. In late 1828 he returned to England and met with Thomas Jefferson Hogg and Jane Williams. He soon developed a strong dislike for Hogg.

Trelawny then decided to write a book about his life and friendship with Shelley and Byron. He initially had wanted to write about Shelley but abandoned the plan after he was unable to secure the assistance of Mary Shelley. He then decided to write about himself. He discussed many actual events in his life, but greatly embellished many details. He also discussed radical politics in the book.

In 1829 Trelawny made plans to live with his three daughters in Italy. He abandoned this plan after his eldest daughter died and his finances became strained. His financial problems were caused in part by a large gift to the Medwin family after they encountered financial difficulties.

==&quot;Adventures of a Younger Son&quot;==
Trelawny wrote &quot;Adventures of a Younger Son&quot; in Arcetti while staying in a room that he rented from Charles Armitage Brown. Brown was irritated that Trelawny burned furniture for firewood, but agreed to copy-edit the book for him. He began work on the book in 1829 but did not finish it until 1831. He was likely dyslexic and his draft required extensive editing by Brown.

Trelawny then sent his draft to Mary Shelley to arrange publication under the title &quot;A Man&#x27;s Life&quot;. Mary insisted on removing some passages from the book that could be viewed as offensive. He decided to publish it anonymously, but it was expected that many would be able to guess his identity. He did not earn as much money from the publisher as he had hoped. In Autumn 1831 his book was finally published.

His book was published anonymously but within a month it had become well known that he was the author. Most contemporary reviewers accepted the book as factual, but subsequent scholarship has demonstrated that most of the book is no more than a fictional account of his life. Writing in the &quot;Keats-Shelley Journal&quot; of 1956, Anne Hill concluded that &quot;the proportion of truth to fiction in &quot;Adventures of a younger son&quot; turns out to be small, not more than one tenth.&quot; His biography has since been translated into French, German, Swedish, and Gaelic. Trelawny returned to England in 1832 and was famous and well received by London society and was treated like a hero. He began meeting with Godwin regularly.

==America==

His younger daughter by his first wife was adopted by a British general, and his youngest daughter was adopted by an Italian family. Trelawny&#x27;s financial condition improved significantly around that time. In 1832, while on a visit to Liverpool, he decided to travel to the United States. He arrived in Charleston, in early 1833. He then travelled to New York in early summer, where he met Fenimore Cooper and Fanny Kemble. They then travelled to Niagara. Wherever they went, he often talked of staying permanently. He repeatedly raised political issues and furiously argued when disagreed with. In August he decided to try to swim across the rapids below the falls. He successfully made it across, but nearly drowned on the way back. He then travelled to Saratoga, New Haven, New York City, and Philadelphia. He returned to Charleston, preferring the climate there. He was disappointed that his atheism was poorly received in the United States. He later claimed to have travelled to California in 1833. He was bothered by the way wealthy Americans tried to copy the habits of Europe. It is unknown exactly what he did in late 1833 and early 1834; some have speculated that he made plans to build a utopian community. He travelled to Philadelphia again by autumn 1834. He was depressed at that time and returned to England in spring 1835.

==Philosophical Radicals==
Upon his return to England, Trelawny became politically active with a group known as the Philosophical Radicals. The group advocated left-wing politics and often focused its efforts on the rights of women. Trelawny began associating with its supporters, many of whom were among the upper-class members of London society. Most of London society was willing to overlook his claims of disloyalty against the British after his claimed desertion and accepted him into society. At this time many women were attracted to him, and there was frequent speculation about his sexual escapades in many London tabloids, such as &quot;The Satirist&quot;.

He soon had a falling out with Mary Shelley. He was offended in part because she turned to Thomas Jefferson Hogg for advice instead of asking him. He later described Mary as &quot;the blab of blabs&quot; in a letter to Claire Clairmont. Trelawny and Mary Shelley also disagreed about a custody reform bill that was proposed by the Philosophic Radicals.

During this time he published short stories about piracy. In 1839 he disappeared from London society due to a controversial new romance.

==Third marriage==
He moved into a villa on Putney Hill that was owned by John Temple Leader, a political friend of his. His affair with Augusta Goring began shortly after he returned to England. She claimed to have been badly treated by her husband, who was a member of Parliament. Many people in London society believed that he was practising a strict ascetic routine there. Trelawny then eloped with Augusta. After she separated from her husband she began using a pseudonym. She gave birth to a son in August 1839. Her husband tracked her down, however, and filed for divorce. The divorce was granted in 1841. Trelawny married Augusta and they settled in a small country town of Usk, in Monmouthshire, Wales. They bought a farmhouse and had a daughter named Laetitia. They later moved to a large house on a 440-acre farm two miles outside Usk. He worked hard maintaining the farm and was friends with several leading citizens from the town. He lived in Usk in Wales for twelve years total, which was longer than he had ever lived in one place in his entire life. He planted trees and lawns and flower gardens. Townspeople were offended by his breaking the sabbath. In the mid-1850s he began writing a book about his memories of Byron and Shelley. His marriage split up in 1857 due to his relationship with a young woman who became his mistress and later common-law wife. The girl&#x27;s name was never discovered; she is only known as Miss B. He frequently had tea with the vicar of Usk on Sunday afternoons. After he separated from his wife in Usk he sold a large amount of the furniture and books and held a well-attended open house for villagers to come in and buy his possessions. After his third divorce, he criticised the institution of marriage in a letter to Claire. He frequently wrote the wrong dates on his letters.

==&quot;Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron&quot;==

Trelawny became friends with several artists and writers, including Algernon Charles Swinburne, Joseph Boehm, Edward Lear, and Richard Edgcumb. He became a friend of Rossetti as he was working on a new edition of Shelley&#x27;s poems. In 1844 Robert Browning met with Trelawny in Italy.

In 1858 Trelawny published &quot;Recollections of the Last Days of Shelley and Byron&quot;. This book was better received than previous biographies of Shelley, such as &quot;The Life of Percy Bysshe Shelley&quot;. Although he had known Shelley for only six months, Trelawny was thereafter recognised as the preeminent Shelley expert. His first memoir was republished then, as well. He often edited his letters before they were published. The edits attempted to cover up some of his insecurities and defend his reputation. He frequently characterised himself as a survivor in his writings.

Trelawny was then widely received in society and met Benjamin Disraeli at a meeting that was held about possibly building a statue for Lord Byron. Though he had never met her, Trelawny was often a defender of Percy Shelley&#x27;s first wife Harriet. He often shocked people by applauding Shelley&#x27;s atheism and disparaging Browning and Tennyson. At the age of eighty he read &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; and welcomed its conclusions. He greatly admired Garibaldi and John Brown, as well.

Trelawny spoke with the French painter Jean-Léon Gérôme after he began work on a portrait of Shelley. In 1878 Trelawny&#x27;s memoir was reissued and edited by Rossetti under the title &quot;Records of Shelley Byron and the Author&quot;. This book contained somewhat harsher treatments of poets than the previous edition had, and some have speculated that this may have been due to Rossetti&#x27;s influence. He was particularly critical of Mary Shelley, the Godwin family, and Leigh Hunt. Lady Shelley was furious, and had Trelawny&#x27;s relics removed from the Shelley shrine.

As he grew older, Trelawny&#x27;s guests noted that he told them amazing stories about himself that he purported to be true, such as meeting with Captain Morgan and circumnavigating the globe.

==Retirement==
Trelawny then adopted a more ascetic life and moved to Sompting, Sussex. As he grew old, he remained active. He did not hire a housekeeper until he was very old. He regularly swam, chopped wood, and dug in his gardens. He remained active into his eighties. He made his garden into a bird sanctuary and did not allow hunters onto his property. He was very friendly with the neighbourhood children and often gave them sweets. He corresponded with Claire regularly from 1859 until 1876. He unsuccessfully tried to persuade Claire to write a biography of him.

He often presented items to his friends and visitors that he claimed to have found on his world travels or during his days with Shelley and Byron. As an old man, he lived with a much younger woman, Emma Taylor. They told people she was his niece.

He closely oversaw his sons&#x27; education and taught them foreign languages. They were sent to a military academy in Germany. Frank died a young man while serving as a soldier in the Prussian army. His son Edward converted to Catholicism and told people that he was the son of Sir John Trelawny. They later became estranged. Zella became a housewife in London. Trelawny outlived four of his seven children. The only child whom he enjoyed good relations with was Laetitia, who also lived with him in Sompting. He had chosen to name her Laetitia as several women on Sir Jonathan&#x27;s side of the family were named Laetitia. Late in his life, he became a teetotaler and vegetarian.

In 1874 he sat as a model for John Everett Millais as he painted the picture &quot;The North-West Passage&quot;. This picture depicted an old sailor declaring that England would find a way through the Northwest Passage. Millais had seen Trelawny at the funeral of John Leech years before and decided that he would make the perfect figure for the drawing. Trelawny initially liked the picture, but he was angered when he saw that Millais had included a glass of grog in the picture. It was ultimately well received by critics.

Trelawny was able to visit Augusta Draper in 1874. He also visited Jane Williams in 1872. Williams was the only close friend of Percy Shelley to outlive Trelawny. In August 1881 he suffered a fall while out on a walk. He was bedridden and died two weeks later.
His ashes were buried in Rome in a plot of ground adjacent to Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s grave. He had purchased this plot in 1822 at the time he had arranged for Shelley&#x27;s ashes to be reburied in a more suitable site within the Protestant Cemetery. At his request his grave marker bears a quote from Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;Epitaph&quot;.

==Reception==
There have been six biographies written about Trelawny. The characterizations of him vary greatly. Several of the authors were negative in their portrayal of him, others presented a favorable romantic portrait, and some have presented a mixed picture of his character. The authors of the biographies conducted varying amounts of scholarship and often contradicted each other about details of Trelawny&#x27;s life. Trelawny has been credited with helping Byron and Shelley become recognized as celebrities after their deaths. Jonathan Bate has described him as one of the &quot;key makers of modern celebrity&quot;. He was the last major figure of the Romantic era living in Victorian England.

Besides being the subject of numerous biographies, Trelawny is one of the primary characters in the novella &quot;A Time to Cast Away Stones&quot; (Chapbook 2009), collected in &quot;The Bible Repairman and Other Stories&quot; [Tachyon, 2011] and &quot;Down and Out in Purgatory: The Collected Stories of Tim Powers&quot; [Baen, 2017]) and the novel &quot;Hide Me Among the Graves&quot; (William Morrow, 2012), both by Tim Powers, as well as playing a major role in &quot;Shelley&#x27;s Boat&quot;, by Julian Roach (Harbour Books, 2005).

<text>John Trevisa (or John of Trevisa; ; fl. 1342–1402 AD) was a Cornish writer and professional translator.

Trevisa was born at Trevessa in the parish of St Enoder in mid-Cornwall, in Britain and was a native Cornish speaker. He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, and became Vicar of Berkeley, Gloucestershire, chaplain to the 5th Lord Berkeley, and Canon of Westbury on Trym.

He translated into English for his patron the Latin &quot;Polychronicon&quot; of Ranulf Higden, adding remarks of his own, and prefacing it with a &quot;Dialogue on Translation between a Lord and a Clerk&quot;. He likewise made various other translations, including Bartholomaeus Anglicus&#x27; &quot;On the Properties of Things&quot; &quot;(De Proprietatibus Rerum)&quot;, a medieval forerunner of the encyclopedia. It seems likely that he was the translator of the Bible into Cornish, a language, which until recently, was thought not to have possessed a bible translation. 

A fellow of The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, from 1372 to 1376 at the same time as John Wycliff and Nicholas of Hereford, Trevisa may well have been one of the contributors to the Early Version of Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible. The preface to the King James Version of 1611 singles him out as a translator amongst others at that time: &quot;even in our King Richard the second&#x27;s days, John Trevisa translated them [the Gospels] into English, and many English Bibles in written hand are yet to be seen that divers translated, as it is very probable, in that age&quot;. Trevisa does not seem to have been a Wycliffite or Lollard, though he had some views in common about corruption.

Subsequently, he translated a number of books of the Bible into French for Lord Berkeley, including a version of the &quot;Book of Revelation&quot;, which his patron had written up onto the ceiling of the chapel at Berkeley Castle.
Trevisa&#x27;s reputation as a writer rests principally on his translations of encyclopaedic works from Latin into English, undertaken with the support of his patron, Thomas (IV), the fifth Baron Berkeley, as a continuous programme of enlightenment for the laity.

John Trevisa is the 18th most frequently cited author in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and the third most frequently cited source for the first evidence of a word (after Geoffrey Chaucer and the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;).

<text>The Batasang Pambansa (; ), often referred to simply as the Batasan, was the legislature of the Philippines, established as an interim assembly in 1978 and later as an official body in 1984. It was the fourth unicameral legislature in Philippine history. Members of the Batasang Pambansa were referred to as &quot;Mambabatas Pambansa&quot; (English: Member of Parliament, literally &quot;National Lawmaker&quot;), shortened to &quot;MP&quot;.

The Batasan was instituted under the 1973 Constitution promulgated by then-President Ferdinand Marcos, replacing the earlier Congress of the Philippines established by the 1935 Commonwealth Constitution. It was abolished immediately after the People Power Revolution in 1986, and Congress was restored with the passage of the 1987 Constitution.

== History ==
The original provisions of the 1973 Constitution, which was ratified on January 17, 1973, provided for the establishment of a unicameral National Assembly. Upon its ratification, an interim National Assembly composed of the president and the vice president, those who served as president of the 1971 Constitutional Convention, members of the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the delegates to the 1971 Constitutional Convention, was established and functioned as the legislature. Before the Regular Batasang Pambansa convened, a 120-member interim body served as the national legislature. The body was composed of the incumbent president, representatives elected from different regions and from different sectors, and select Cabinet officials appointed by the president. In 1981, the semi-parliamentary legislature was formally convened as the Batasang Pambansa, and in 1985, some dissident members unsuccessfully tried to impeach President Marcos.
On March 25, 1986, Proclamation No. 3, commonly known as the 1986 Freedom Constitution, was promulgated, effectively abolishing the Batasang Pambansa.

<doc id="1271657" wikidata="Q271961" url="?curid=1271657" title="Frances Milton Trollope">
<text>Frances Milton Trollope, also known as Fanny Trollope (10 March 1779 – 6 October 1863), was an English novelist who wrote as Mrs. Trollope or Mrs. Frances Trollope. Her book, &quot;Domestic Manners of the Americans&quot; (1832), observations from a trip to the United States, is the best known.

She also wrote social novels: one against slavery is said to have influenced Harriet Beecher Stowe, and she also wrote the first industrial novel, and two anti-Catholic novels, which used a Protestant position to examine self-making.

Some recent scholars note that modernist critics have omitted women writers such as Frances Trollope. In 1839, &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; claimed, &quot;No other author of the present day has been at once so read, so much admired, and so much abused&quot;.

Two of her sons, Thomas Adolphus and Anthony, became writers, as did her daughter-in-law Frances Eleanor Trollope (née Ternan), second wife of Thomas Adolphus Trollope.

==Biography==
Born at Stapleton, Bristol, Frances was the third daughter and middle child of the Reverend William Milton and Mary Milton (née Gresley). Frances was five years old when her mother died in childbirth. Her father was remarried to Sarah Partington of Clifton in 1800. She was baptised at St Michael&#x27;s, Bristol, on 17 March 1779. As a child, Frances read a great amount of English, French and Italian literature. She and her sister later moved to Bloomsbury, London, in 1803 to live with their brother, Henry Milton, who was employed in the War Office.

===Marriage and family===
In London, she met Thomas Anthony Trollope, a barrister. At the age of 30, she married him on 23 May 1809 in Heckfield, Hampshire. They had four sons and three daughters: Thomas Adolphus, Henry, Arthur (who died in 1824) Emily (who died in a day), Anthony, Cecilia and Emily. When the Trollopes moved to a leased farm at Harrow-on-the-Hill in 1817, they faced financial struggles for lack of agricultural expertise. This was where Frances gave birth to her last two children. 
Two of her sons and one daughter also became writers. Her eldest surviving son, Thomas Adolphus Trollope, wrote mostly histories: &quot;The Girlhood of Catherine de Medici&quot;, &quot;History of Florence&quot;, &quot;What I Remember&quot;, &quot;Life of Pius IX&quot;, and some novels. Her fourth son Anthony Trollope became a well-known and received novelist, establishing a strong reputation, especially for his serial novels, such as those set in the fictional county of Barsetshire, and his political series the Palliser novels. Cecilia Trollope Tilley published a novel in 1846.

Despite producing six living children, the Trollopes&#x27; marriage was reputedly unhappy.

====Move to America====
Soon after the move to the leased farm, her marital and financial strains led Frances to seek companionship and aid from Fanny Wright, ward of the French hero Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. In 1824 she visited La Grange, Lafayette&#x27;s estate in France. Over the next three years, she made several other visits to France and was inspired to take an American excursion with Wright. Frances thought of America as a simple economic venture and figured that she could save money by sending her children through Wright&#x27;s communal school, as Wright had planned to reform the education of African American children and the formerly enslaved on their property in Tennessee. In November 1827, Frances Trollope went with some of her family to Fanny Wright&#x27;s utopian community Nashoba Commune in the United States. She took her son, Henry, and her two daughters, Charlotte and Emily. Her husband, Thomas Anthony, and remaining sons, Tom and Anthony, stayed at home and continued their education. In October 1828, Tom and his father joined Frances in Cincinnati, leaving Anthony at boarding school. They returned to England in January 1829.

Arriving in the United States one year earlier than her husband, she developed an intimate relationship with Auguste Hervieu, a collaborator in her venture. (This is not verified.) After the community failed, Trollope moved to Cincinnati, Ohio with her family. She also encouraged the sculptor Hiram Powers to do Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Commedia&quot; in waxworks.

Nonetheless, all the ways she tried to support herself in America were unsuccessful. She found the cultural climate uninteresting and came to resent democracy. Furthermore, after her venture failed, her family was more in debt than when she had migrated there and they were forced to move back to England in 1831.

====Return to Europe====
From her return at the age of 50 until her death, Trollope&#x27;s need of an income for her family and to escape her debts led her to begin writing novels, memoirs of her travels, and other shorter pieces, while travelling around Europe. She became well acquainted with elites and figures of Victorian literature including Elizabeth Barrett, Robert Browning, Charles Dickens, Joseph Henry Green and R. W. Thackeray (a relative of William Makepeace Thackeray).

She wrote more than 41 books: six travelogues, 35 novels, countless controversial articles, and poems. In 1843, Frances visited Italy and eventually moved to Florence permanently.

==Writing career==

Trollope already gained notice with her first book &quot;Domestic Manners of the Americans&quot; (1832). She gave an unfavourable, and in the opinions of America&#x27;s partisans, an exaggerated account. Her novel, &quot;The Refugee in America&quot; (1832), expressed similar views, prompting Catharine Sedgwick to respond that &quot;Mrs. Trollope, though she has told some disagreeable truths, has for the most part caricatured till the resemblance is lost.&quot; She was thought to reflect the disparaging views of American society that were allegedly commonplace at that time among English people of the higher social classes.

Later Trollope wrote further travel works, such as &quot;Belgium and Western Germany in 1833&quot; (1834), &quot;Paris and the Parisians in 1835&quot; (1836), and &quot;Vienna and the Austrians&quot; (1838). Among those with whom she became acquainted in Brussels was the future novelist Anna Harriett Drury.

===Novels===
Next came &quot;The Abbess&quot; (1833), an anti-Catholic novel, as was &quot;Father Eustace&quot; (1847). While both borrowed from Victorian Gothic conventions, the scholar Susan Griffin notes that Trollope wrote a Protestant critique of Catholicism that also expressed &quot;a gendered set of possibilities for self-making&quot;, which has been little recognised by scholars. She noted that &quot;Modernism&#x27;s lingering legacy in criticism meant overlooking a woman&#x27;s nineteenth century studies of religious controversy.&quot;

Trollope received more attention in her lifetime for what are considered several strong novels of social protest: &quot;Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw&quot; (1836) was the first anti-slavery novel, influencing the American Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852). It focuses on two powerful families – one that strongly encourages slavery and another that strongly opposes it and provides sanctuary for slave refugees. It antagonizes pro-slavery characters, making them appear foolish and uncultured. Frances also brings out her idea of a stereotypical American by drawing certain characters as shrewd, convincing, sly and greedy.

Published in 1840, &quot;Michael Armstrong, the Factory Boy&quot; was the first industrial novel to be published in Britain, inspired by Frances&#x27;s visit to Manchester in 1832, where she examined the conditions of children employed in the textile mills. The story of a factory boy who is rescued by a wealthy benefactor at first, but later returns to the mills, illustrates the misery of factory life and suggests that private philanthropy alone will not solve the widespread misery of factory employment. Other socially conscious novels of hers include &quot;The Vicar of Wrexhill&quot; (1837, Richard Bentley, London, 3 volumes), which took on the issue of corruption in the Church of England and evangelical circles. Possibly her greatest work is the &quot;Widow Barnaby&quot; trilogy (1839–1855), which includes the first ever sequel. In particular, Michael Sadleir considers the skilful set-up of &quot;Petticoat Government&quot; [1850], with its cathedral city, clerical psychology and domineering female, as something of a formative influence on her son&#x27;s elaborate and colourful cast of characters in &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;, notably Mrs. Proudie.

==Later life and death==
In later years Frances Trollope continued to write novels and books on miscellaneous subjects – in all over 100 volumes. In her own time, she was considered to have acute powers of observation and a sharp and caustic wit, but her prolific production coupled with the rise of modernist criticism caused her works to be overlooked in the 20th century. Few of her books are now read, but her first and two others are available on Project Gutenberg.

After the death of her husband and daughter, in 1835 and 1838 respectively, Trollope moved to Florence, Italy, having lived, briefly, at Carleton, Eden in Cumbria, but finding that (in her son Tom&#x27;s words) &quot;the sun yoked his horses too far from Penrith town.&quot; One year, she invited Theodosia Garrow to be her house guest. Garrow married her son Thomas Adolphus, and the three lived together until Trollope&#x27;s death in 1863. She was buried near four other members of the Trollope household in the English Cemetery of Florence.

<text>Abraham Tucker (2 September 1705 – 20 November 1774) was an English country gentleman, who devoted himself to the study of philosophy. He wrote &quot;The Light of Nature Pursued&quot; (1768–1777) under the name of Edward Search.

==Biography==
Tucker was born in London of a Somerset family, the son of a wealthy city merchant. His parents died during his infancy, and he was brought up by his uncle, Sir Isaac Tillard. In 1721, he entered Merton College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner, and studied philosophy, mathematics, French, Italian and music. He afterwards studied laws at the Inner Temple, but was never called to the bar.

In 1727 he bought Betchworth Castle, near Dorking, where he passed the remainder of his life. In 1736 Tucker married Dorothy Barker, daughter of Edward Barker of East Betchworth, cursitor baron of the exchequer. They had two daughters, Judith (died 1794), and Dorothea Maria, who married in 1763 Sir Henry St John, 2nd Baronet of Dogmersfield Park. On his wife&#x27;s death in 1754, Tucker occupied himself in collecting together all the letters that had passed between them, which, we are told, he transcribed twice over under the title of &quot;The Picture of Artless Love.&quot;

He then concentrated on his major work, &quot;The Light of Nature Pursued&quot;, of which in 1763 he published a specimen under the title of &quot;Free Will, Foreknowledge, and Fate&quot;, by &quot;Edward Search&quot;. The strictures of a critic in the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; of July 1763 drew from him a pamphlet called &quot;Man in Quest of Himself&quot;, by &quot;Cuthbert Comment&quot; (reprinted in Samuel Parr&#x27;s &quot;Metaphysical Tracts&quot;, 1837), &quot;a defence of the individuality of the human mind or self.&quot; In 1768 the first two volumes of his work were published. The remaining volume appeared posthumously. His eyesight failed him completely in 1771, but he contrived an apparatus which enabled him to write legibly enough that the result could be transcribed by his daughter. The final volume was ready for publication when he died.

Tucker took no part in politics, and wrote a pamphlet, &quot;The Country Gentleman&#x27;s Advice to his Son on the Subject of Party Clubs&quot; (1755), cautioning young men against its snares.

==Work==
Tucker&#x27;s magnum opus is &quot;The Light of Nature Pursued&quot;, originally published in three volumes:

* Volume 1: Human Nature (1768)
* Volume 2: Theology (1768)
* Volume 3: Lights of Nature and Gospel Blended (1777)

The author&#x27;s intention is to draw up &quot;a scheme of nature and the fundamentals of natural religion, founded upon the basis of experience and observations resulting therefrom&quot;. His work contains many psychological and more strictly metaphysical discussions, but it is chiefly in connexion with ethics that Tucker&#x27;s speculations are best remembered. In important points he anticipated the utilitarianism of William Paley, who expressed obligations to his predecessor. &quot;Every man&#x27;s own satisfaction&quot; Tucker held to be the ultimate end of action; and satisfaction or pleasure is one and the same in kind, however much it may vary in degree. This universal motive is further connected, as by Paley, through the will of God, with the &quot;general good, the root where out all our rules of conduct and sentiments of honour are to branch.&quot;

&quot;The Light of Nature Pursued&quot; was republished with a biographical sketch by Tucker&#x27;s grandson Sir Henry St John-Mildmay, 3rd Baronet (1805, other editions 1831, 1834, &amp;c.), and an abridged edition by William Hazlitt appeared in 1807.

<doc id="1271669" wikidata="Q7104100" url="?curid=1271669" title="Orris root">
<text>Orris root (&quot;Rhizoma iridis&quot;) is the root of &quot;Iris germanica&quot; and &quot;Iris pallida&quot;. It had the common name of Queen Elizabeth Root. It is commonly used as a fixative and base note in perfumery and as a botanical in gin.

== Constituent chemicals ==
The most valued component of orris root is oil of orris (0.1–0.2%), a yellow-white mass containing myristic acid. Oil of orris is sometimes sold as orris butter.

Other components include fat, resin, starch, mucilage, bitter extractive, and a glucoside called iridin or irisin.

== Uses ==
Once important in western herbal medicine, it is now used mainly as a fixative and base note in perfumery; it is the most widely used fixative for potpourri. Orris is also an ingredient in many brands of gin, including Bombay Sapphire.

Fabienne Pavia, in her book &quot;L&#x27;univers des Parfums&quot; (1995, ed. Solar), states that in the manufacturing of perfumes using orris, the scent of the iris root differs from that of the flower. After preparation the scent is reminiscent of the smell of violets.

In Japan, the roots and leaves of the plant were hung in the eaves of a house to protect the house and occupants from attacks by evil spirits. Other magic uses include using it as a love potion, with the root powder in sachets, or sprinkled around the house or sheets of a bedroom.

== Preparation ==
After an initial drying period, which can take five years or more depending on the use (for potpourri only two to three months), the root is ground. For potpourri, this powder is used without further processing. For other uses, it is dissolved in water and then distilled. It achieves a highly scented, yellow-brown crystalline form. One ton of iris root produces two kilos of essential oil, also referred to as orris root butter or butter of iris, and it is the most expensive substance used in the fragrance industry. Its fragrance has been described as tenaciously flowery, heavy and woody (paraphrasing &quot;Pavia&quot;, Dutch translation, page 40). It is similar to violets.

== In perfume ==
Typical iris perfumes (where orris prevails over the other components) include &quot;Orris Noir&quot; by the London-based perfume house Ormonde Jayne Perfumery, &quot;Infusion d&#x27;iris&quot; (Prada), &quot;N°15&quot; by Auphorie, &quot;Iris Silver Mist&quot; (Serge Lutens), &quot;Tumulte&quot; (Christian Lacroix), &quot;Iris nobile&quot; (Aqua di Parma), &quot;Irisia&quot; (Creed), &quot;Y&quot; (Yves Saint Laurent), &quot;Vol de nuit&quot; (Guerlain), and &quot;Fantasy The Naughty Remix&quot; (Britney Spears). &quot;Orris Noir&quot; contains regular orris root oil, &quot;not&quot; the oil of &quot;Iris nigricans&quot;, which is an endangered species.

== In cuisine ==
Orris root is often included as one of the many ingredients of ras el hanout, a blend of herbs and spices used across the Middle East and North Africa, primarily associated with Moroccan cuisine.

Orris root has been used in tinctures to flavour syrups; its taste is said to be indistinguishable from raspberry.

Orris root powder also had a use as the base in the making of nonpareils.

Joey Wong Cho-Yee ( Joey Wang, Wang Tsu Hsien) (, born 31 January 1967) is a Hong Kong–based Taiwanese former actress and singer. Along with Maggie Cheung, Rosamund Kwan and Cherie Chung, she was widely regarded as one of the ‘Four Flowers’ of Hong Kong cinema.

==Biography==
Wong was born on 31 January 1967 and raised in Taipei, where she completed her secondary school. She has an older brother, a younger brother and a sister.
Her father was a basketball player and encouraged her to become a professional basketball player when she was fourteen. Shortly thereafter she shot a TV commercial for sport shoes which drew the attention of a film producer who made her the leading lady of film &quot;It&#x27;ll Be Very Cold by the Lakeside This Year&quot;. Her appearance in the film attracted the attention of producer Mona Fong of Shaw Brothers who invited Wong to come to Hong Kong. In 1985, Wong then appeared in the Hong Kong film &quot;Let&#x27;s Make Laugh II&quot;, opposite Derek Yee Tung Sing. 

In 1987, she portrayed a beautiful ghost in &quot;A Chinese Ghost Story.&quot; Her portrayal led to her becoming a film idol in Japan and South Korea. In the following years, Wong continued to star in a dozen more movies playing similar characters, such as a ghost or a vixen. 

In 1989, she starred in the Japanese TV series &quot;A Woman From Hong Kong,&quot; later also starring in commercials and publishing photo albums.

In 1992, she made her singing debut with the Japanese and Mandarin CD single, &quot;Hold You In My Arms Forever&quot;. In 1993, she appeared as the White Snake in Tsui Hark&#x27;s &quot;Green Snake&quot;, a revision of the Madame White Snake legend told from the perspective of the younger Green Snake.

In 1994, Wong expressed a desire to retire from film making, staying away from the limelight until 1997 when she returned to the silver screen in the Japanese movie &quot;Peking Genjin&quot; (&quot;Peking Man&quot;) and released the companion CD single &quot;Who Are You?&quot;.

In 1998, she released the extended Japanese CD &quot;Angelus&quot; and her first and only full CD, in Mandarin, &quot;Isolation&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Isolated From The World&quot;.

She returned to semi-retirement after the release of &quot;Isolation&quot;, but returned once again to films in 2001 with &quot;Peony Pavilion&quot;, then once again announced her retirement in 2002 after leaving Chyi Chin.

In 2004, she appeared in &quot;Shanghai Story&quot; and reportedly appeared in a Taiwanese TV series with on again, off again beau Chyi Chin. It was reported that she enjoyed her return to films and reportedly signed a multi-film contract. However, the unexpected suicide of her friend and former movie co-star Leslie Cheung caused her to withdraw once again from the limelight.

In September 2005, coinciding with the worldwide release of &quot;Shanghai Story&quot;, she once again announced her formal retirement. She currently resides in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and is studying English.

Joey Wong was also very well known for her relationship with Chyi Chin, a Taiwanese singer. Their relationship lasted about 16 years, from 1987 to 1991 and 1993 to 2002.

<doc id="1271677" wikidata="Q1508382" url="?curid=1271677" title="George Tucker (author)">
<text>George Tucker (August 20, 1775April 10, 1861) was an American author, educator and historian in Virginia, following early years as an attorney and politician. His literary works include &quot;The Valley of Shenandoah&quot; (1824), the first fiction of colonial life in Virginia, and &quot;A Voyage to the Moon&quot; (1827), which is among the nation&#x27;s earliest science fiction novels. He also published the first comprehensive biography of Thomas Jefferson in 1837, as well as his &quot;History of the United States&quot; (1856). Tucker&#x27;s authorship, and his work as a teacher, served to redeem an earlier life of unprincipled habits which had brought him some disrepute.

Tucker was a son of the first mayor of Hamilton, Bermuda, Daniel Tucker. He immigrated to Virginia at age 20, was educated at the College of William and Mary, and was admitted to the bar. His first marriage to Mary Farley ended childless with her death in 1799; he remarried and had six children with wife Maria Carter, who died at age 38 in 1823. His third wife of 30 years was Louisa Thompson, who died in 1858.

Aside from his law practice, Tucker began to write compositions for various publications. His topics ranged widely from the conceptual to the technical—from slavery, suffrage, and morality to intracoastal navigation, wages, and banking. He was elected in 1816 to the Virginia House of Delegates for one term, and served in the United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825. From his youth until early middle age, Tucker&#x27;s lofty social lifestyle was often profligate, and occasionally scandalous. Nevertheless, upon completion of his congressional term, his eloquent publications led Thomas Jefferson and James Madison to offer him an appointment as Professor of Moral Philosophy at the newly founded University of Virginia; he accepted and held that post until 1845.

After retiring, Tucker relocated to Philadelphia, continuing his research, and expounding upon a variety of subjects, which included monetary policy and socio-economics, until his death in Virginia at the age of 85.

==Family and early life in Bermuda==
George Tucker was born August 20, 1775, on St. George&#x27;s Island, Bermuda. He was the second son of Daniel and Elizabeth Tucker, who were distant cousins, and members of the Tucker family that included Henry Tucker. Daniel and his brothers established a mercantile partnership with a fleet of vessels shipping goods to British America, Newfoundland, and the West Indies. Daniel was also a founder and mayor of the port of Hamilton, Bermuda. Tucker offers a description of his physique in his Autobiography: “I was in height, and tho’ somewhat slender, well proportioned. I had great animal spirits, and unceasing mobility. My face was somewhat of a feminine cast.&quot;

Tucker was educated primarily by a tutor engaged from Great Britain and also by Josiah Meigs. His assigned reading included &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, &quot;The Vicar of Wakefield&quot;, and &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, among the mainstays of an education on the American continent. At age fifteen he helped form a literary club, which he says he named the Calliopean Society; this may have been an imitation of the original started earlier in New York. Tucker at age 16 began to read the law under a successful and prosperous lawyer, George Bascomb. At Bascomb&#x27;s death, the firm&#x27;s clients urged Tucker to assume their representation, but feeling quite unqualified, he declined, and initiated plans for a career in the United States.

According to Tucker&#x27;s Autobiography, at this time he encountered his first love interest, in a distant cousin, Nancy Tucker. The longer he suffered in silence with his feelings, the stronger they grew, until finally he resolved to call upon her at home and make his declaration. Upon his arrival, the two entered a parlor where he offered her his hand, which was accepted, all in silence. The tongue-tied handholding continued for 10–15 minutes until interrupted by the entrance of her mother, and the visit ended. Very soon thereafter the girl fell ill and died and left Tucker in grief, which he described as a &quot;most serious affliction.&quot; Six years passed before he expressed an interest in another woman.

==Immigration to the United States, education and first marriage==

Shortly after his mother&#x27;s death in 1795, Tucker sailed for Philadelphia, intending to continue his legal education in the United States. He briefly considered London for his studies but discarded the idea, in order to optimize his chances for &quot;political advancement.&quot; After a free-spending time with other Bermudians in the capital city, he ran out of funds, and proceeded to Williamsburg, Virginia to seek advice and borrow money from his famous cousin St. George Tucker, a maneuver he would repeat. He was admitted to the College of William &amp; Mary, where he studied law under St. George and graduated after two years. Tucker was pleased to find the academic work undemanding, and his social life entertaining, as he gained access to the finer homes through his cousin.

Tucker traveled to New York and Philadelphia and, with letters of introduction in hand, was able to further acquaint himself with his adopted country and noted leaders, including George Washington and New York governors John Jay and George Clinton. Despite his enjoyment of this high society, he returned to Williamsburg and there began a courtship with Mary Byrd Farley, who was possessed of much charm and fortune, and to whom he proposed. Though he had initially preferred to delay the wedding until he was admitted to the bar, he gave in to his heart&#x27;s desire, borrowed the needed funds from an uncle, and they married in April 1797. To help Mary, who was chronically ill with consumption, Tucker arranged a trip to his old home in Bermuda. The stay there provided Mary no relief from her illness and confirmed their desire to be in Virginia. They returned to Williamsburg, setting up residence, and he began to read for admission to the bar, which was completed after some procrastination. Except for trips to North Carolina to collect rents on his wife&#x27;s property, Tucker avoided work, attending horse races in Fredericksburg, and frequenting fashionable watering places with friends and family. He made Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s acquaintance at this time. Mary never recovered from her infirmities, and died childless in 1799.

Mary&#x27;s death complicated Tucker&#x27;s facile life, as her estate, though considerable, was fraught with legal problems. It included a sugar plantation, thousands of acres of land, and a share in the Dismal Swamp Company. After a prolonged trip to the sugar plantation in Antigua, and on to Martinique and Bermuda, he returned to Williamsburg and then determined his future was in the nearby state capital of Richmond, Virginia as a practicing attorney. Tucker ultimately succeeded in salvaging only part of his late wife&#x27;s fortune.

==Richmond society, second marriage, slavery and politics==

Tucker arrived in Richmond in the summer of 1800 with a letter of introduction from St. George to Governor James Monroe. His cousin&#x27;s letter accurately portrayed Tucker&#x27;s character and also foretold his future there: &quot;To the best qualities of the heart he unites an excellent understanding, which has been well cultivated, and a very comprehensive knowledge of the world; nature has blessed him with a most exuberant flow of spirits, which sometimes betray him into acts of levity...&quot; Tucker effectively entered the desired social circles in Richmond, bolstered by a well-furnished home near the Governor&#x27;s own, and soon could count among his acquaintances not only the Governor (whom Tucker called &quot;that slow dull man&quot;), but also George Wythe, Edmund Pendleton, and George Hay. (Tucker later boasted that, with the exception of John Adams, he had conducted personal intercourse with every president from Washington to Buchanan.)

While in Richmond, he met Charles Carter (1765–1829), who introduced him to daughter Maria Ball Carter—a granddaughter of Elizabeth Washington Lewis and descendant of Robert Carter I. Tucker described her as, &quot;being a decided beauty, she had a face distinguished for sweetness and intelligence, conversed sensibly and sang sweetly.&quot; They soon fell in love, and in February 1802 he married Maria, age seventeen and pregnant.

While Tucker began writing for publication, as an attorney he was initially deficient, being disabled by his fear of speaking in the courtroom; he later gained the requisite self-confidence. Tucker later became a founding member of the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society (now the Virginia Museum of History and Culture) in Richmond. This was an effort led by John Marshall and John Floyd; Tucker was named to the Society&#x27;s Standing Committee.

Politically, Tucker was a Jeffersonian Republican, who delighted at the split in the Federalists between John Adams and Alexander Hamilton. He joined in the resentment toward Federalist attempts to &quot;appoint a president&quot; by party caucus; in time he became a pro-bank Republican. He once gave a speech in support of a Federalist in a local election, and a staunch Republican, Lewis Harvey, called him a party traitor and liar. In reaction Tucker, routinely prone to a hot temper, took a swing at Harvey, but missed due to the intervention of a neutral party. Assuming his challenge unsuccessful, Tucker demanded satisfaction, which Harvey accepted. Tucker carefully arranged the duel, stipulating an extraordinary distance in paces, so as to diminish the superior marksmanship of his opponent. Fortunately for Tucker the duel was avoided at the last moment—though not before he had completed his will and arranged his estate for his expecting wife. Their first child, Daniel George, was born November 23, 1802.

===Positions on slavery===
Tucker sought out the foremost authors in Richmond to advance his interest in literature and the arts. A conspiracy of slaves initiated a futile attempt to destroy the city, and he was prompted to publish an essay suggesting a remedy to slavery, entitled &quot;Letter to a Member of the General Assembly of Virginia&quot; (1801). Tucker&#x27;s &quot;Letter&quot; expressed his early opposition to slavery, portraying it as unproductive and uneconomical. He wrote that no country &quot;can attain great heights in manufactures, commerce or agriculture where one half of the community labours unwillingly, and the other half does not labour at all.&quot; He recommended that revenues be secured (with a tax on slaveholders) and used to establish a colony for the slaves west of the Mississippi. He further asserted that the slave&#x27;s inferiority was a result of time and circumstance, and not heredity.

In the 1820s, however, Tucker&#x27;s views of slavery changed notably with personal experience, and profit, realized in his purchase and sale of slaves for his account and that of his father-in-law, Charles Carter. For years, he opposed the concepts of abolition and colonization as impractical, but he later reverted to his earlier conclusion that a more beneficial, commercially oriented, society was inevitable. While noting the spurious benefits of slavery, he predicted its eventual demise; he ultimately freed his own slaves in 1845, 16 years before his death.

==Scandal, rustic life and valor==

===Dissipation and rigged lottery===
Tucker&#x27;s law practice could not support the expenses essential to his extravagant social exploits, which included gambling at cards and races, and he proceeded to waste the capital from Mary Tucker&#x27;s estate. He was drawn to speculative investments and ultimately was embroiled in a financial scandal. In 1803, he joined other prominent citizens in organizing a lottery to raise funds for the Richmond Academy. He bought several chances for himself and, as remaining chances dwindled, resold some of them for a profit; he also was said to have positioned himself as one of four or five holders sure to be a winner. He held the winning stub when his ticket was found lodged in a joint of the drawing drum.

Tucker was asked for reimbursement, and after negotiation, paid it in part, borrowing the remainder from members of the academy board. He also acted as custodian of other funds, blended them with his own and spent it on overindulgence and land speculation. Later he was required to defend himself in these matters before the Virginia General Assembly. Though he was officially cleared of wrongdoing, the incidents tarnished his reputation and highlighted the style of his living in Richmond. Meanwhile, Maria gave birth to their eldest daughter, Eleanor Rosalie, on May 4, 1804.

Tucker in his Autobiography confessed to frequently misplacing his pocketbook over the years, and estimated his loss in the aggregate to be more than a thousand dollars in cash (the equivalent of $26,000 in 2020). To this he added, &quot;This heedlessness I had from a child, and during my practice of the law, I strewed the upper country as well with countless umbrellas, gloves, watches, cufflinks, handkerchiefs, and knives.&quot;

===Rural settings===
In 1806, Tucker relocated his family, including newborn daughter Maria, to the Carters&#x27; home in Frederick County, Virginia, and attempted to put his financial house in order. Business required his frequent return to Richmond, and on one occasion he was arrested there for a delinquency owed to a loan company. The immediate problem was solved with the intervention of St. George. Tucker economized for two years, living a rural life with the Carters and other family members and was able to purchase a home near the Dan River.

In May 1808, the family moved to &quot;Woodbridge&quot; in Pittsylvania County, where daughter Eliza Lewis Carter was born in December. Maria was then faced with rearing four children in more rural, less favorable living conditions. For his part, Tucker was disappointed with the local social life. While he thought all his neighbors &quot;friendly and civil,&quot; they were also &quot;unpolished and plain.&quot; Tucker put greater effort into his law practice and became more successful, acquiring additional clients spread across four counties. He was also elected Commonwealth&#x27;s Attorney for Pittsylvania County. Maria gave birth to daughter Lelia in October 1810 and Harriett in May 1813.

===Self-described act of chivalry===
In 1811, Tucker was in Richmond to attend a benefit performance, and put his life in danger during the infamous Richmond Theatre fire. The event, including a play entitled &quot;The Father, or Family Feuds&quot; and a pantomime afterwards named &quot;Raymond and Agnes&quot;, was held in December at the Richmond Theatre. It being Christmas time, the auditorium was packed—with 518 adults and 80 children.

In his &quot;Autobiography&quot; Tucker relates that, &quot;The play was over... and there appearing to be much delay in bringing on the afterpiece... I had fortunately quitted the [play]house while it was on fire, tho&#x27; I did not know the fact... but the cry of fire prevented my reaching my lodgings, and hurried me back to witness a spectacle of human woe which I have never seen equalled. I was instrumental in saving several females from the flames.&quot; In the process, Tucker suffered a head injury when struck by a falling timber, and was left with a permanent scar above his eye. The tragedy took the lives of 72 people, including the sitting Governor of Virginia, George William Smith. Victims also included many of the upper echelons in Richmond society.

==Elective office and early writing==

Tucker&#x27;s maritime roots in Bermuda instilled an interest in intracoastal navigation, and he began an intense campaign with the legislatures of North Carolina and Virginia to improve the waterways to Norfolk along the Roanoke, Dan, and Staunton Rivers, in order to avoid inefficient portage required to Petersburg and Richmond. This effort culminated in his own bids for election to a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates representing Pittsylvania County, which failed in 1813 and 1814 but then succeeded in 1816. It was at this time that Tucker and Maria suffered the first loss of a child, Harriett, from whooping cough at age three.

In the House of Delegates Tucker&#x27;s most valued contributions were made in writing rather than speaking. He was asked to draft a valedictory address in tribute to James Madison, whose administration was then drawing to a close. It was well received, except for the critique of fellow delegate Philip Doddridge who regretted that a &quot;foreigner&quot; should be assigned the task. Tucker took strong exception to the insult. Nevertheless, when he was offered a cane with which to attack Doddridge, though tempted, he thought better of it.

Tucker continued his work in literature along with his law practice, and in 1814–1815 the Philadelphia &quot;Port Folio&quot; published a series of his essays entitled &quot;Thoughts of a Hermit&quot;. Financial success was for once his as a result of these endeavors. He also realized profits from land sales near the Dan River, and the sale of Woodbridge when the family moved again, to Lynchburg, Virginia in 1818.

The death of daughter Harriett had been painful enough, but Maria&#x27;s depression became uncontrollable and chronic when daughter Rosalie died unexpectedly at age 14 in 1818. Also during this period Maria&#x27;s father, Charles Carter, encountered his own financial setbacks, and prevailed upon Tucker for assistance. Tucker, with the help of Lawrence Lewis, was able to settle the Carters at &quot;Deerwood&quot;, sharing part of the profits from Charles&#x27; management there.

With financial success came more clients and opportunities to serve his community. Tucker received many cases in debt collection, and he was appointed trustee of the Lynchburg Female Academy and vestryman at St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church. He was also elected to serve in the United States House of Representatives from 1819 to 1825, representing the Lynchburg area in the 16th, 17th, and 18th United States Congresses. His financial largess was short-lived, as Tucker was unable to resist the allure of society and lavish living in Washington, not to mention the increased expenses of a larger immediate family.

Though Tucker and Maria were warned against her having more children in her vulnerable physical and emotional state, she again conceived, and died in pregnancy in February 1823. In the carriage to Washington after the funeral, Tucker muffled his face with a handkerchief to hide his tears and feigned a toothache in response to inquirers. Maria&#x27;s death indeed weighed heavily upon him, as he reflected on his plausible neglect in the midst of her travails. He also was much concerned for his son Daniel&#x27;s indolence and unbalanced behavior, which years later resulted in the son&#x27;s hospitalization and ultimate death in 1838 in Philadelphia.

Due in part to these personal trials, he made no momentous contributions to Congress beyond his reliable positions representing Virginia&#x27;s interests, with a consistent Jeffersonian Republican voting record. He did serve as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of War. There are notable disparities between Tucker&#x27;s more statist voting record and the nationalism predominant in his writings during this period and later. In his essay &quot;On Instructions to Representatives&quot;, he provides an explanation in political theory—an inevitable obligation to think one way and yet vote another, in compliance with constituent preferences.

Tucker&#x27;s self-assessment as a congressman is otherwise much less forgiving: “In addition to the pecuniary engagements and difficulties which unfitted my mind for the current business of legislation, I spent all my leisure hours playing chess, to which I was shamefully and regretfully, but passionately devoted. I had then a livelier ambition to be a great chess player than to be a distinguished member of Congress.“

==Academics==

Near the end of Tucker&#x27;s third congressional term in 1824, Thomas Jefferson presented him with an offer on behalf of the fledgling University of Virginia, sanctioned by Trustees James Madison and Joseph C. Cabell, to serve as the first Professor of Moral Philosophy. The offer met the school&#x27;s desire to appoint a non-Federalist to the post, and Tucker&#x27;s connections with Cabell and St. George would also have facilitated his selection. Another factor was Tucker&#x27;s recent 1822 &quot;Essays on Various Subjects of Taste, Morals, and National Policy&quot;, which included papers from the &quot;Port Folio&quot;. Madison had been provided a copy of these and recommended them to Jefferson, saying they were &quot;among the best answers to the charges of our national ...backwardness.&quot; Tucker&#x27;s selection may also have been an accommodation to some of the school&#x27;s opponents, including Episcopalians, Federalists, and notable western Virginians, many of whom were friends of Tucker&#x27;s. Presumably, his prior monetary indiscretions were overlooked since no related formal charges were extant.

From Tucker&#x27;s perspective, the offer was most opportune, as he considered his congressional seat in jeopardy, as well as his pocketbook. The professorship included a steady income, extra fees from philosophy students, tenure, and rent-free quarters on the University Lawn. Tucker accepted the offer, effective in 1825, and also was chosen the first chairman of the faculty. As well as his primary discipline, he also assumed charge of the subjects of Political Economics and Rhetoric for the university. 

He was content with an expanding family life in Charlottesville, Virginia, as daughter Eliza married a fellow professor, Gessner Harrison of the Harrison family of Virginia; they eventually produced ten grandchildren for Tucker. He nevertheless &quot;found solitude unbearable&quot; after Maria&#x27;s death and began an earnest search for a wife, whom he found in Louisa A. Thompson, a widow from Baltimore. In their thirty years together Tucker later said he had found &quot;the same warmth and devoted affection with which I have been previously blest.&quot;

Tucker&#x27;s primary philosophical interest was what he and his contemporaries called &quot;mental philosophy,&quot; which involved the investigation of the principles and faculties of the human mind. He maintained that modern philosophers had acquired the discipline to free themselves from medieval &quot;mysticism and folly,&quot; in the same manner that modern chemists cast aside alchemy.

Tucker&#x27;s effectiveness in the lecture hall is not objectively certain, and he may well have encountered difficulty with public speaking as he had in the courtroom previously. His continued faculty chairmanship certainly testified to his relative popularity among colleagues, and he published numerous works—including one satire, a fiction, three books on economics and statistics, a Jefferson biography, as well as two pamphlets. Together with Robley Dunglison he founded and edited the &quot;Virginia Literary Museum&quot; (1829–1830) in which he published voluminous writings, and he frequently sent essays to newspapers and other magazines.

==Later politics and major literary works==

===Politics===

Some of Tucker&#x27;s writing reflected a growing political skepticism of the workings of democracy beginning with the 1796 election. By the late 1820s, he was persuaded that political leadership positions should be reserved primarily for prosperous people with a tangible, and taxable, interest in government. Andrew Jackson&#x27;s election in 1828 was for Tucker an example of the &quot;triumph of democratic demagoguery which could bring about class warfare.&quot; Tucker worked arduously in Virginia to oppose Jackson and was a solid supporter of Henry Clay, with his second choice being Daniel Webster.

He opposed universal suffrage, and favored limiting the franchise to half of free men, and allowing slaveholders to cast votes on behalf of three-fifths of their slaves; he also argued in favor of eliminating the secret ballot. Tucker also promoted the Second National Bank and strongly criticized Jackson for defunding it.

===Works of fiction===

Tucker&#x27;s premier literary work was &quot;The Valley of Shenandoah&quot; (1824), the first fictional tale of life in Virginia. His writing began on July 1 and the book was completed by August 31. In relating the downfall of an aristocratic family in the commonwealth&#x27;s valley, it drew upon his personal witness of the financial ruin of his in-laws, the family of Charles Carter, and described the inability of an estate owner to manage his monetary affairs, such as he had personally experienced. Tucker further used the novel&#x27;s characters, again reflecting personal experience, to emphasize that happiness in love and life resulted from the moderation of one&#x27;s passions. &quot;The Valley&quot; stressed Tucker&#x27;s professorial objective, that history must inform the reader with &quot;the progress of society and the arts of civilization; with the advancement and decline of literature, laws, manners and commerce.&quot; He also conveyed through the fiction his view that gentility was independent of wealth, that the relationship between masters and slaves was imbued with mutual trust and happiness, and that the strong currents of socio-economic change were on the whole beneficent.

In his negotiations with the publisher Harpers, Tucker relates: &quot;As an excuse for not offering me more liberal terms, one of them, the eldest partner, said, “Why, we shall have to give a man fifty dollars to read your book. &#x27;Oh,&#x27; said I, &#x27;what chance have you then to sell it if you have to hire a man to read it?&#x27;&quot; Harpers offered to pay him $500, which he declined, and the publication was delayed at an unknown price.

Using the pseudonym Joseph Atterley, in 1827 he wrote the satire &quot;A Voyage to the Moon: With Some Account of the Manners and Customs, Science and Philosophy, of the People of Morosofia, and Other Lunarians&quot;. It is one of the earliest American works of science fiction, and was relatively successful, earning Tucker $100 from the sale of 1000 copies. It received positive reviews from the &quot;American Quarterly Review&quot; and the &quot;Western Monthly Review&quot;. Tucker uses &quot;The Voyage&quot; to ridicule the social manners, religion and professions of some of his colleagues, and to criticize some erroneous scientific methods and results apparent to him at the time.

===First biography of Jefferson===

In 1836, Tucker completed his manuscript of a comprehensive biography, &quot;The Life of Thomas Jefferson, Third President of the United States&quot;. He sent his composition to James Madison for his approval, as the latter had assisted in its formation. Tucker included for his sanction a proposed dedication to the recipient. Madison replied with his full approbation and signature on June 26, 1836, just hours before his death the following day.

This study of the life of Jefferson was published in two volumes the following year, and received complimentary assessment in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; from Lord Brougham, as &quot;a very valuable addition to the stock of our political and historical knowledge. In it, Professor Tucker does not always accord with the illustrious subject of his biography. The work, indeed, manifests a laudable desire to do justice, and to decide impartially on contested topics; and hence, perhaps, it failed to give satisfaction to the ardent supporters, as well as to the bitter opponents, of Mr. Jefferson.&quot; Tucker gave the publication a positive assessment, saying he was paid 50 cents per copy upon an initial printing of 2000 copies.

==Sabbatical abroad, retirement, and work of U.S. history==

===Sojourn in Great Britain===
Tucker considered a trip abroad would enhance his insight and résumé generally, and specifically prepare him for a possible, though not likely, diplomatic appointment. He expected there was much to be learned for his country&#x27;s benefit in the British factories, great estates, and crowded cities. With his finances in order and a three-month leave from the university, in 1839 he made a trip to Great Britain and after some time in Shakespeare country, Stratford-Upon-Avon, he settled in Liverpool. He did not succeed in making all the expected social connections, with the exception of the 1st Earl of Leicester and his wife, with whom he frequently discussed politics and agriculture. Though admiring the succinct debates in Parliament, he found Queen Victoria&#x27;s procession &quot;more fit to amuse a child than one of my age.&quot; On the whole he found conversation did not come easily with the British, and concluded that &quot;...there were more churls in England than in all of Europe besides.&quot; This journey, along with his interest in the doctrines of Thomas Robert Malthus on populace, inspired Tucker to expound upon the mixed blessings of a prospective urbanized world. Some of his hypotheses were included in &quot;The Progress of the United States in Population and Wealth&quot; (Boston, 1843). This work gained him one of his proudest honors, a membership in the Statistical Society of Paris.

His enthusiasm for teaching at the university ebbed in his final years there. He was also perturbed by an increase in religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement, which he mildly protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the university reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary.

===Resignation from faculty and relocation===
With the resignation of Henry St. George Tucker, Tucker&#x27;s last contemporary on the faculty, Tucker in 1845 resigned his own professorship and moved with his wife to Philadelphia. There he enjoyed a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison, and the availability of more libraries, and meetings at the American Philosophical Society to which he was elected in 1837. Nevertheless, there were drawbacks—for one, the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him—he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville. He later expressed doubt about the wisdom of this decision when he learned that three of them had, by law, been exiled from Virginia, and shortly thereafter died. As well, the two freed slaves who accompanied him to Philadelphia immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there.

Social life in the urban setting did not initially live up to his expectations, but after a time his writing and lecturing upon a variety of subjects filled the void. He also joined The American Institute for the Advancement of Science and successfully urged its members to establish a section on Political Economics and Statistics. He as well engaged in a debate, as antagonist of Malthusian population theory with proponent Alexander Hill Everett.

===History of the United States===
In 1856, Tucker completed his four-volume &quot;History of the United States, From Their Colonization to the End of the 26th Congress in 1841&quot;. Tucker had sprightly begun his work on this production in 1850, at the age of 75. Robley Dunglison commented as follows on the work: &quot;To aid him in the execution of his work, as [Tucker] himself remarks, it had been his good fortune to have a personal knowledge of many, who bore a conspicuous part in the Revolution, and of nearly all those who were the principal actors in the political dramas which succeeded. The history extends to the elevation of General William Henry Harrison to the Presidency in 1841, which is as far as Tucker thought he could prudently go.&quot; The work includes a brief review of slavery, in which Tucker took issue with Jefferson&#x27;s decades-old view in his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; (1781), that slavery still had a degenerative effect upon slaveholders.

According to Tucker, previews of the work by his colleagues brought commendation, the reception of the publisher was encouraging, and payment advances were arranged with a bank. Then came the bank failures and loss of credit from the Panic of 1857, and printing was halted. Tucker&#x27;s final comment on the situation was an optimistic one, for the future of the economy and for his authorship.

==Final years==

Though Tucker may have displayed in his old age &quot;a spirit of pugnacity becoming earlier years,&quot; as one critic claimed, such a nature was not in evidence with his family. He corresponded positively and frequently with his children and vacationed with them in the summers in Virginia and New York. He appears to have been consistent in his devotion to his family, which was returned by them in kind. His exchanges with them were replete with a concern for their financial well-being. Musing on his own past errors, he told them that &quot;except for the loss of friends, a want of prudence in money matters has contributed nine-tenths of the pain and vexation of [my] life.&quot;

Even after the death of his wife Louisa in 1858, Tucker&#x27;s vitality persisted and, not long before the American Civil War began, in January 1861 he journeyed south through Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia to Alabama to visit a friend in Mobile. In reaction to Georgia&#x27;s secession from the union, speaking from his lingering southern loyalty, he commented, &quot;it seems a poor remedy for an unpopular President.&quot; He thought the overriding need for &quot;a wise provident government&quot; would bring the southern states back under a modified constitution. But after some time spent in the south, he was compelled to say the people &quot;seemed to be crazed in the fancies of imaginary evils and their strange remedies.&quot; Indeed, Tucker&#x27;s youthful loyalties to the agrarian south had in his maturity given way to a belief in the value and necessity of a commercial-industrial society. Nationalism had replaced statism as the foundation of his politics, and he could not understand why a compromise in lieu of war would not be embraced.

Tucker concluded his literary career, at age 84, with his 226-page book, &quot;Political Economy for the People&quot; (1859).

Tucker sustained head injuries at Mobile Bay when, awaiting his ship&#x27;s departure for return to the north, he was struck by a large bale of cotton being loaded on board. He was moved to the home of daughter Eleanor and husband George Rives in Albemarle County, Virginia, where he died on April 10, 1861, two days prior to the Battle of Fort Sumter and the beginning of the American Civil War. He was buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery.

<doc id="1271687" wikidata="Q3040541" url="?curid=1271687" title="Dubmatique">
<text>Dubmatique is a French Canadian hip hop group formed in the 1990s in Montreal, Quebec. Groupmates Dj Choice, OTMC, and Jérôme-Philippe are the first French-language hip-hop group from Canada to have a number one hit single on the francophone pop charts. Dubmatique is often regarded as one of the groups that launched French Canadian Hip Hop, and within this category they are the only group to have an album certified Platinum.

== Career ==

=== 1980s to breakthrough: early career and breakthrough ===
In the 1980s, Disoul and OTMC became friends in the country of Senegal. In the early 1990s Disoul moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He joined a hip-hop radio show named Dubmatique, with co-host Cedric it was eventually decided that it would become a group. In the mid-1990s, OTMC came to Canada and joined the group. Shortly after, they invited Dj Choice. In 1994, they made their first appearance by doing a freestyle on the mix-tape &quot;Tape 9-Too Leust&quot; by Cut Killer.

By 1995, the group were doing shows in local clubs. They participated at the launch of the album &quot;Simple et Funky&quot; by Alliance Ethnik and the soundtrack for the movie &quot;La Haine&quot;. They won the award Best Hip Hop Group of the Year at the Gala Mimi. That same summer, they performed at the music festival Les FrancoFolies de Montréal.

In 1997, on the French Canadian market, they released their first album named &quot;La force de comprendre&quot;. It was soon certified platinum, selling over 125,000 copies. Because of the singles and music videos for &quot;Soul Pleureur, La force de comprendre,&quot; and &quot;Plus rien n’est pareil&quot;, they reached the top of the charts on commercial radio stations and TV channels for music videos. The reviews were favourable on both lyrics and the production. The album featured French rappers Menelik and 2 Bal.

Dubmatique went on to perform 150 shows on stages throughout Quebec. At the French Canadian equivalent of the &quot;Grammy Awards&quot; called &quot;Le Gala de L&#x27;ADISQ&quot;, the band won the Félix Award of &quot;Best Rock Alternative Album&quot; (Their first year at &quot;Le Gala de L&#x27;ADISQ&quot;, there was no Hip Hop section). They were nominated for Group of the year, and Revelation of the year.

In 1998 the band won the Félix Award for Group of the year, and two more nominations for Show of the year and Best Seller. On the English side of Canada they were nominated for a Juno Award for the Best selling Francophone album.

=== 1999 to 2001: subsequent success ===
Their second album, the self-titled Dubmatique was released in 1999. They launched the singles and music videos of &quot;La vie est si fragile&quot; with the violinist Ashley MacIsaac and &quot;Mémoires&quot;. The album was certified gold and sold 35,000 copies in the first week. They collaborated with two members of the group IAM: Shurik’n was featured on the song &quot;L’avenir&quot;, and Akhenathon remixed the single &quot;La force de comprendre&quot; from the first album. Montreal artists were also featured: El Winner of Latitude Nord, D-Shade of Shades of Culture and Mr. Len. The record was well received and Dubmatique continued to perform around Quebec and fill up large venues. Finally at &quot;Le Gala de L&#x27;ADISQ&quot;, they won the Félix Award for &quot;Hip Hop Album of the year&quot;, were nominated for Group of the year. Additionally at &quot;Le Gala Soba&quot; they won two Sound of Blackness Awards for Best Group of the year, and Best Francophone Hip Hop Group of the year.

Dj Choice did not participate on the production of their third album. Disoul and OTMC worked with Sonny Black, Jaynaz, Ray Ray, and Stéphane Dufour. In 2001 they released the album &quot;Influences&quot;. &quot;Ragga Dub&quot; and &quot;Sexcite-Moi,&quot; a collaboration with the rock singer Éric Lapointe, were chosen as the singles and music videos to launch the album. The group continued to do well on the charts. They won the Félix Award for Best Hip Hop Album of the year. This record is also annotated to be the first appearance by best selling R&amp;B singer Corneille on a professional project.

=== 2004 to present day: solo projects and reunions ===
In 2004, their label Tox released the compilation &quot;Mémoires&quot; that contained all of their hits. Shortly after, Disoul and OTMC launched solo projects. In 2005, Disoul decided to use his real name, Jérôme-Philippe and released a self-titled album where he mixed rapping and singing. OTMC followed up in 2006 with a Hip Hop album named &quot;Sincérité volontaire&quot;. Their respective songs would play on the radios throughout Quebec and sales were respectable.

In 2008, a group was created by a fan on Facebook to urge Dubmatique to reunite, and over 50,000 fans joined. This motivated OTMC and Disoul to make an album. In 2009 they launched &quot;Trait d’union&quot;. Dj Choice participated and produced the song &quot;Patience&quot; a collaboration with Sir Pathetik, Imposs and John John. Singers Barnev Valsaint, Jennifer Silencieux, and Mike Coriolan also participated. Singles and music videos for &quot;La Vibe&quot; and &quot;Cold World&quot; were released. Les FrancoFolies de Montréal music festival organised their first reunion show.

<text>Polyester is a 1981 American satirical comedy film directed, produced, and written by John Waters, and starring Divine, Tab Hunter, Edith Massey, and Mink Stole. It satirizes the melodrama film genre and the &quot;woman&#x27;s film&quot; category, particularly the work of Douglas Sirk, which directly influenced this film. The film is also a satire of suburban life in the early 1980s, involving topics such as divorce, abortion, adultery, alcoholism, racial stereotypes, foot fetishism, and the religious right.

&quot;Polyester&quot; was filmed in Waters&#x27; native Baltimore, Maryland, like many of his previous films. It featured a gimmick called Odorama, whereby moviegoers could smell what they were viewing on-screen with special scratch-and-sniff cards (a stylistic tribute to the work of William Castle, whose films typically featured attention-grabbing gimmicks).

Following &quot;Stunts&quot;, it was among the earliest films that New Line Cinema produced.

==Plot==

Early 1980s housewife Francine Fishpaw watches her upper-middle-class family&#x27;s life crumble in their suburban Baltimore home. Her husband Elmer is a polyester-clad lout who owns an adult movie theater, causing anti-pornography protesters to picket the Fishpaws&#x27; house. Francine&#x27;s Christian beliefs are offended by the behavior of her children—Lu-Lu, her spoiled, promiscuous daughter; and Dexter, her delinquent, glue-sniffing son who derives sexual pleasure from stomping on women&#x27;s feet.

Francine&#x27;s cocaine-snorting mother, La Rue, is a class-conscious snob. She compounds her daughter’s troubles by robbing her blind, constantly deriding her obesity and berating her for befriending her former housecleaner Cuddles Kovinsky; Cuddles is a “simple-minded” woman who tries to console Francine with &quot;seize-the-day&quot; bromides and has inherited a large sum of money from a wealthy former employer.

After Francine discovers Elmer having an affair with his secretary Sandra Sullivan, she confronts them during a motel tryst and demands a divorce. Francine then falls into alcoholism and depression, exacerbated by her children&#x27;s behavior; Lu-Lu is impregnated by her degenerate boyfriend Bo-Bo Belsinger, and she announces she is getting an abortion. Soon after, Dexter is arrested at a supermarket for stomping on a woman&#x27;s foot, and the media reveals that he is the “Baltimore Foot-Stomper” who has been terrorizing local women.

Lu-Lu attempts to go to an abortion clinic, but anti-abortion picketers attack her. She returns home and tries to induce a miscarriage, causing Francine to put her in the care of a Catholic unwed mothers&#x27; home. Bo-Bo and his friend, who come to trash the Fishpaw house on Halloween, shoot La Rue, but she retrieves the gun and shoots Bo-Bo dead. After Lu-Lu flees the unwed mothers&#x27; home, she returns home to find Bo-Bo&#x27;s body; she is so distraught that she attempts suicide. Francine faints after witnessing her daughter&#x27;s suicide attempt—and the apparent suicide (by hanging) of the family dog Bonkers, based on a suicide note left near the dog&#x27;s dangling body.

Sometime later, Francine&#x27;s life begins to look up, as a rehabilitated Dexter is released from jail; Lu-Lu suffers a miscarriage from her suicide attempt, and she is contrite about her past, becoming an artistic flower child who embraces macramé. Francine quits drinking, confronts and rebukes her mother, and finds new romance with Todd Tomorrow. Todd proposes marriage to an elated Francine, but she discovers that Todd and La Rue are romantically involved and conspiring to embezzle her divorce settlement, drive her insane and sell her children into prostitution.

Elmer and Sandra break into the house to murder Francine, but Dexter and Lu-Lu kill them: Dexter steps on Sandra&#x27;s foot, causing her to accidentally shoot Elmer, and Lu-Lu uses her macramé to strangle Sandra. When Cuddles arrives with her German chauffeur/fiancé Heintz, their car runs over La Rue and Todd, killing them. The film concludes with a happy ending for Francine, her children and newlyweds Cuddles and Heintz.

==Production==

The Dreamlanders, Waters&#x27; usual acting troupe, serve minor roles in &quot;Polyester&quot;, compared to Waters&#x27; previous films &quot;Desperate Living&quot;, &quot;Female Trouble&quot; and &quot;Pink Flamingos&quot;, which starred several Dreamlanders in major roles. Only two, Divine and Edith Massey, receive top billing. This movie was also Massey&#x27;s final collaboration with Waters before her 1984 death. Dreamlander perennials Mink Stole, Mary Vivian Pearce, Cookie Mueller, Sharon Niesp, Marina Melin, Susan Lowe and Jean Hill have plot integral roles; however, they are much smaller compared to earlier films. Principal photography took place over the course of three weeks in October 1980.

&quot;Polyester&quot; was the first Waters film to skirt the mainstream, even garnering an R rating (his previous films were all unrated or rated X—the equivalent of the Motion Picture Association of America&#x27;s present-day NC-17 rating). The film is set in a middle-class Baltimore suburb instead of its slums and bohemian neighborhoods, the setting of Waters&#x27; earlier films.

During an interview on The Ghost of Hollywood, cinematographer David Insley revealed that the helicopter used to shoot the opening scenes had to make an emergency landing on a nearby golf course while it was open. After the helicopter was cleared for safety, it was towed from the fairway using a flatbed.

This was Insley&#x27;s third collaboration with Waters and his first as lead cinematographer. Insley also photographed &quot;Hairspray&quot; and &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;.

===Music===
Three songs are featured.
# &quot;Polyester&quot; by Tab Hunter – words and music by Chris Stein and Debbie Harry
# &quot;Be My Daddy&#x27;s Baby (Lu-Lu&#x27;s Theme)&quot; by Michael Kamen – words and music by Harry and Kamen
# &quot;The Best Thing&quot; by Bill Murray – words and music by Harry and Kamen

===Women&#x27;s pictures===
&quot;Polyester&quot; was a send-up of women&#x27;s pictures, an exploitative film genre popular from the 1950–1960s and typically featured bored, unfulfilled, or otherwise troubled women, usually middle-aged suburban housewives, finding release or escape through the arrival of a handsome younger man. Women&#x27;s pictures were typically hackneyed B-movies, but Waters specifically styled &quot;Polyester&quot; after the work of the director Douglas Sirk, asking Insley to make use of similar lighting and editing techniques, even using film equipment and movie-making techniques from Sirk&#x27;s era. By chance, Insley viewed some of Sirk&#x27;s films at a local screening celebrating the director.

===Odorama===

Odors, especially Francine&#x27;s particularly keen sense of smell, play an important role. To highlight this, Waters designed Odorama, a &quot;scratch-and-sniff&quot; gimmick inspired by the work of William Castle and the 1960 film &quot;Scent of Mystery&quot;, which featured a device called Smell-O-Vision. Special cards with spots numbered 1 through 10 were distributed to audience members before the show, in the manner of 3D glasses. When a number flashed on the screen, viewers were to scratch and sniff the appropriate spot. Smells included the scent of flowers, pizza, glue, gas, freshly cut grass, and feces. For the first DVD release, the smell of glue was changed due to, as Waters states, &quot;political correctness&quot;. The gimmick was advertised with the tag &quot;It&#x27;ll blow your nose!&quot; After being prompted to scratch and sniff a bouquet of roses, viewers are subjected to a series of mostly foul-smelling odors, and thus fall victim to the director&#x27;s prank.

The ten smells (developed by 3M per Waters in the supplements section of the DVD release) are:
# Roses
# Flatulence
# Model airplane glue
# Pizza
# Gasoline
# Skunk
# Natural gas
# New car smell
# Dirty shoes
# Air freshener

A video release omits the onscreen flashing numbers as well as the opening introduction explaining Odorama. This version, created by Lorimar-Telepictures, was shown on cable TV in the United States. The Independent Film Channel released reproduction Odorama cards for John Waters film festivals in 1999. Waters expressed his delight at having audiences actually &quot;pay to smell shit&quot; on the 2004 DVD release commentary track.

Paramount Pictures used the Odorama name and logo as part of the &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; release in 2003, upsetting Waters when he learned that New Line Cinema had let the copyright lapse. The 2011 film &quot;Spy Kids: All the Time in the World&quot; used a scratch-and-sniff card branded &quot;Aromascope&quot;, advertised as providing the fourth dimension in its &quot;4D&quot; format.

Odorama cards were recreated by Midnight Movies, Little Joe Magazine, and The Aroma Company to allow viewers to interact with &quot;Polyester&quot; as intended for a screening at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in June 2011.

==Critical response==
&quot;Polyester&quot; received some positive reviews from the mainstream press. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 94% based on reviews from 31 critics, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The critics&#x27; consensus states, &quot;As proudly tacky as its titular fabric, &quot;Polyester&quot; finds writer-director John Waters moving ever so slightly into the mainstream without losing any of his subversive charm.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The 2000 single &quot;Frontier Psychiatrist&quot; by the Australian electronic music group The Avalanches samples the film.

<doc id="1271716" wikidata="Q24260" url="?curid=1271716" title="Canillo">
<text>Canillo () is one of the seven parishes which make up Andorra. Canillo is also the name of the main town of the parish. The parish is considered the religious center of Andorra with the Sanctuary and Chapel of Our Lady of Meritxell, patron saint of Andorra, and contains one of the best-preserved romanesque churches in the Pyrenees, Sant Joan de Caselles. It has a population of 4,826 as of 2011. Despite having a tourist vocation, the parish of Canillo still retains many livestock and agricultural traits. It borders France to the north and east.

==History==
The etymological origin of the name of the parish Canillo and its capital is pre-Roman, Iberian or Celtic. It is documented for the first time in the &quot;Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d&#x27;Urgell&quot; (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d&#x27;Urgell), during the 9th century, as &quot;Kanillave&quot; or &quot;Sant Serni de Kanillave&quot;. Later on it was referred to as &quot;Canilau&quot; as it appears in a document from 1176.

In Prats is located the sanctuary of &quot;Roc de les Bruixes&quot;, a set of rock-engraved ritual themes dating from the Bronze Age and the Iberian era, to the Early Middle Ages. Originally it was a sacred place from where the Iberians extracted stone powder to make ointments. Late Gothic remains such as the necropolis of Sant Joan de Caselles or the one aside Sant Serni de Canillo in the late 7th and 8th century provide proof of the early Christianity in Andorra.

The parish maintains its traditional character from the Medieval Period including old mills and traditional mountain houses. Such as the flour mill of the &quot;Peano&quot;, a sample of the old sources of wealth of the country, and the buildings that can be found in the old quarter of the capital, such as &quot;Ca Armany&quot;, &quot;Cal Fluix&quot; or &quot;Cal Ferrer Nou&quot;, as well as the old quarter of Soldeu or Incles.

The church of Sant Joan de Caselles, Romanesque building from the end of the 11th century, is perhaps one of the most emblematic churches of the Principality. Inside the temple there is a Romanesque stucco Majesty on a mural painting (12th century) and a Gothic altarpiece from the 16th century with German and Italian influences. The other churches in Canillo include the parish church of Sant Serni located in the old town of Canillo, original from the 12th century with the structure and interior elements of Baroque style (17th-18th centuries), the church of Sant Miquel de Prats (12th-13th centuries) and the church of Santa Creu de Canillo (1781) located in Canillo at the river bank of the Valira river.

==Culture and folklore==
The town figures into the Andorran legend &quot;El buner d&#x27;Ordino&quot;, in which a bagpiper from the parish of Ordino, en route to a festival in Canillo, is chased and treed by wolves, but frightens them off by playing his instrument.

The parish is intimately related to the national legend of Charlemagne. The legend explains that Charlemagne entered through the Valleys from Incles, and made a ring on the mountain of &quot;Pic Negre of Juclà&quot; to tie his horse, marking the borders between Andorra and &quot;Sabartés&quot; (Ariège), which It was in the Carolingian era &quot;Sabart&quot;, a small town today annexed to Tarascon. Not far from the place it&#x27;s found the &quot;Creu Gótica de Carlemany&quot; (Gothic Cross of Charlemagne), a tribute to the blacksmiths of the country.
Also the &quot;Creu dels Set Braços&quot; (Cross of the seven arms) can be found in the parish. The cross is the origin of the tragic legend about a boy from Prats who thought that the devil could go find him someday. He accidentally killed one of his friends who wanted to scare him to make him a joke after returning from the town of Canillo to bring a barrel of wine. The body disappeared mysteriously, some say by the devil himself. In the place where the accident happened, they placed a cross in order that the passers remember and removed the consequence of such ugly act. The cross had seven arms, like seven were the young people who wanted to make fun of their compatriot. One of them disappeared, and, strangely coinciding, the cross also lost one of his arms.

Canillo is the place of the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Meritxell. According to legend, a shepherd found the image of the Virgin on a winter day under some flowering roses and decided to take it home. The image, however, returned three times to the same place where it had been found. Finally, the Andorrans decided to build a chapel there. In 1873, the General Council of the Valleys declared her the patron saint of the country and on 8 September 1921 it was declared the National Holiday of the Principality.

The original sanctuary was of Romanesque style and was completely restored in the 17th century. In 1972, the sanctuary burned down, being completely destroyed along with the Romanesque statue of the Virgin. The construction of a new sanctuary was entrusted to the Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill Levi. The new building was inaugurated in 1976. Inside it is still revered a replica of the Romanesque carving statue of the Virgin that was destroyed in the fire.

The sanctuary was declared a Minor basilica on 13 May 2014 by Pope Francis and joined the Marian Route (&quot;Ruta Mariana&quot;), a cultural-religious nature route, together with Our Lady of the Pillar, Our Lady of Torreciudad, Our Lady of Montserrat and Our Lady of Lourdes.

The etymological origin of the name of the parish Ordino and its capital is pre-Roman, and it is documented for the first time in the &quot;Acta de Consagració i Dotació de la Catedral de la Seu d&#x27;Urgell&quot; (Deed of Consecration and Endowment of the Cathedral of La Seu d&#x27;Urgell), during the 9th century, as &quot;Hordinavi&quot; or &quot;Sant Cebrià d&#x27;Hordinavi&quot;.

Ordino is historically known for its ironworks of the 16th century, especially &quot;Farga del Serrat&quot; and &quot;Farga de l&#x27;Areny&quot;. Besides being the industrial center of Andorra, Ordino is considered the cultural center of Andorra. Here Antoni Fiter i Rossell wrote the &quot;Manual Digest&quot; (1748), called the &quot;Bible of Andorra,&quot; which tells the story, the government and the Andorran customs.

The town of Ordino include the parish church of Sant Corneli i Sant Cebrià, already mentioned in 839, was mainly built during the 12th and 13th centuries. The Romanesque church of Sant Martí de la Cortinada, with 12th-century murals, is also a good example of romanesque Andorran art.

Manor houses like Fiter-Riba or Casa Rossell, which holds the original &quot;Manual Digest&quot; and Areny-Plandolit family house, owners of &quot;Farga de l&#x27;Areny&quot;, represented the good society of Andorra between the 17th and 19th centuries. Both mansions were acquired in 1972 by Consell General and converted into an ethnological and historical museum.
The parish and town is the namesake of the Andorran legend El buner d&#x27;Ordino, in which a bagpiper from Ordino, en route to a festival in Canillo, is chased and treed by wolves, but frightens them off by playing his instrument.

<text>Matvei Vasilevich Zakharov (; August 17, 1898 – January 31, 1972) was Marshal of the Soviet Union, Chief of the General Staff, and Deputy Defense Minister.

==Biography==

Zakharov was born in Voylovo, a village in Kalininsky District, Tver Oblast to peasant parents. Zakharov joined the Red Guards (precursor to the Red Army) in 1917, and took part in the Storming of the Winter Palace. He served under Kliment Voroshilov during the Russian Civil War. Zakharov graduated from the Frunze Military Academy in 1928, and from Soviet General Staff Academy in 1937 (his graduation was actually a year ahead of schedule, due to the lack of officers in the Red Army because of the explosive growth of the army, as well as Stalin&#x27;s purges.) Zakharov held a number of high-ranking positions before World War II even began. In 1937 he was made the Chief of Staff of the Leningrad Military District, then in 1938–1940 he was the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, and then the Chief of Staff of the Odessa Military District.

By the end of 1941, after the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, he was moved north, where he was made the Chief of Staff of the Northwestern Theatre. Soon thereafter, he was made the Chief of Staff of the Kalinin Front, a role he held for most of 1942. In 1943, he was made the Chief of Staff of the Steppe Front, which was renamed the 2nd Ukrainian Front around mid-year. It was in this capacity that Zakharov proved himself as one of the Soviet Union&#x27;s top military commanders. He helped plan a number of brilliant operations against German forces, first as a subordinate to Marshal Ivan Konev, and then under Marshal Rodion Malinovsky. After the cessation of hostilities with Germany, Zakharov was transferred east, where he was made the Chief of Staff of the Transbaikal Front, and helped plan the subsequent Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation.
Zakharov described in his memoirs how in April–June 1941, the commanders of the Odessa military district were aware of German reconnaissance aircraft violating soviet airspace, and claimed that the Red Army did not have the equipment to shoot them down - though other sources say that Stalin had given an order that German aircraft were not to be fired on.

After the war, Zakharov held a number of key positions in the army. In 1945–1960, Zakharov was the Commandant of the General Staff Academy, Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Chief Inspector of the Army, Commanding General of the Leningrad Military District and, from November 1957, Commander in Chief of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. On May 8, 1959, Zakharov was made a Marshal of the Soviet Union.

In January 1960, the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev announced that within two years, 1,200,000 men, including 250,000 officers, were to be demobilised from the armed forces. When this decision was ratified by the Supreme Soviet on 14 January, the only officers to say anything were Malinovsky and Zakharov, who supported it. It is likely that officers more senior than Zakharov who did not speak, such as Marshal Sokolovsky kept quiet because they opposed the decision. 

In April 1960, Zakharov was appointed Chief of the General Staff and Deputy Minister of Defence, replacing Marshal Sokolovsky. In 1963, having apparently fallen out with Khrushchev, he was demoted to the job he had held 18 years earlier, as head of the General Staff Academy. Khrushchev later stated that Zakharov was removed because he used to fall asleep during important meetings. He was reinstated in October 1964, he was reinstated as Chief of the General Staff and USSR First Minister for Defence, after his successor Marshal Biryuzov had been killed in an airplane crash, and Khrushchev had been ousted. When he retired through ill health in September 1971, he was the last active Marshal to have taken part in the events of 1917.

Marshal M. V. Zakharov died on January 31, 1972. The urn containing his ashes is buried by the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. His memoirs, which appear to have been written after 1964, were not published until 1989.

<doc id="1271730" wikidata="Q17131094" url="?curid=1271730" title="Matrix of domination">
<text>The matrix of domination or matrix of oppression is a sociological paradigm that explains issues of oppression that deal with race, class, and gender, which, though recognized as different social classifications, are all interconnected. This theory also applies to other forms of classification, such as sexual orientation, religion, or age. Patricia Hill Collins is credited with introducing the theory in her work entitled &quot;Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment&quot;. 
As the term implies, there are many different ways one might experience domination, facing many different challenges in which one obstacle, such as race, may overlap with other sociological features. Characteristics such as race, age, and sex, may intersectionally affect an individual in extremely different ways, in such simple cases as varying geography, socioeconomic status, or simply throughout time. Other scholars such as Kimberlé Crenshaw&#x27;s &quot;Mapping the Margins: Intersectionality, Identity Politics, and Violence against Women of Color&quot; are credited with expanding Collins&#x27; work. The matrix of domination is a way for people to acknowledge their privileges in society. How one is able to interact, what social groups one is in, and the networks one establishes are all based on different interconnected classifications.

== Theory applied ==
Though Collins&#x27; main focus of the theory of the matrix of domination was applied to African-American women, there are many other examples that can be used to illustrate the theory. Other examples include Log Cabin Republicans, female criminality, and African-American Muslim women. One of the key concepts of the matrix of domination is that the different categories, like race and gender, are separate groups, rather than a combination. This is a problem that can be seen in the law as well when it comes to discrimination because the courts fail to view discrimination as an overarching umbrella of intersectionality.

A way in which the matrix of domination works with regards to privilege can be if two people all have the same classification, except one person has an education and one does not have as high of an education. Their gender, race, sexuality, educational attainment all intersect to identify who they are. However, compared to other people one classification can point out privilege and, in turn, open more opportunities for one individual over the other.

One of the main aspects of the matrix of domination is the fact that one may be privileged in one area, yet they can be oppressed in a different aspect of their identity. Some people believe that racial discrimination is on its way to being eradicated from the United States when they look as people like Colin Powell, a very successful, African-American, middle-aged man. Although Powell obtains the characteristics of a person that may not face oppression (upper-class, middle-aged, male), he is still discriminated against because of his race. This shows one of the key components of the matrix of domination; the idea that one cannot look at the individual facets of someone&#x27;s identity, but rather that they are all interconnected.

== Matrix of domination compared to intersectionality ==

=== Historical background on the matrix of domination ===
In Collins&#x27; &quot;Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment&quot;, she first describes the concept of matrix thinking within the context of how black women in America encounter institutional discrimination based upon their race and gender. A prominent example of this in the 1990s was racial segregation, especially as it related to housing, education, and employment. At the time, there was very little encouraged interaction between whites and blacks in these common sectors of society. Collins argues that this demonstrates how being black and female in America continues to perpetuate certain common experiences for African-American women. As such, African-American women live in a different world than those who are not black and female. Collins notes how this shared social struggle can actually result in the formation of a group-based collective effort, citing how the high concentration of African-American women in the domestic labor sector in combination with racial segregation in housing and schooling contributed directly to the organization of the black feminist movement. The collective wisdom shared by black women that held these specific experiences constituted a distinct viewpoint for African-American women concerning correlations between their race and gender and the resulting economic consequences.

Moolman points out the main issue concerning matrix thinking is how one accounts for the power dynamics between varying identifying categories that are ingrained in both oppression and domination instead of the traditional approach, reducing experiences to a single identity. For instance, black women&#x27;s experiences with society are used to illustrate how even though white scholars have attempted to use intersectionality in their research, they may still be inclined to default towards single-identity thinking that often fails to address all aspects of black women&#x27;s experiences, thus ignoring the organization the matrix objectively offers.

The matrix of domination in the colonial era and white society has also been carefully examined. The societal hierarchy determined by race and implemented under apartheid locates different racial populations in regards to their privilege, with African Americans usually at the bottom of the ladder. Dhamoon argues that on a global scale, the spot occupied by African Americans in such context is interchangeable with indigenous populations, as marginalized peoples are systematically working both within and across a matrix of interrelated axes of &quot;penalty and privilege&quot;. The interconnectivity of different identities in regards to power in racial structures in post-colonial era societies help illustrate what changes make a difference. The framework setup of the matrix of domination connects its origin theory and thought to existing struggles in the political and social spheres of society. A closer look at both specific and broader aspects of matrix thought will shed more light on the inner-workings and mechanisms that determine how different relationship dynamics influence matrix categorizations.

May cites that an important implication that matrix thinking inspires is that it directly goes against what is often described as the socially inclusive ‘add and stir’ approach. This is often used when describing the addition of one or more identity group to existing epistemological approaches, political strategies or research methodologies. This accounts for the proper weighing of power dynamics and their impact on different groups of people. Intersectionality centers power in a multi-pronged way as shifting across different sites and scales at the same time. Therefore, it is not neutral but evolved out of histories of struggle that pursue multidimensional forms of justice.

=== Historical background on intersectionality ===
Kimberlé Crenshaw, the founder of the term intersectionality, brought national and scholarly credential to the term through the paper &quot;Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics&quot; in The University of Chicago Legal Forum. In the paper, she uses intersectionality to reveal how feminist movements and antiracist movements exclude women of color. Focusing on the experiences of Black women, she dissects several court cases, influential pieces of literature, personal experiences, and doctrinal manifestations as evidence for the way Black women are oppressed through many different experiences, systems and groups.

Though the specifics differ, the basic argument is the same: Black women are oppressed in a multitude of situations because people are unable to see how their identities intersect and influence each other. Feminism has been crafted for white middle-class women, only considering problems that affect this group of people. Unfortunately, this only captures a small facet of the oppression women face. By catering to the most privileged women and addressing only the problems they face, feminism alienates women of color and lower-class women by refusing to accept the way other forms of oppression feed into the sexism they face. Not only does feminism completely disregard the experiences of women of color, it also solidifies the connection between womanhood and whiteness when feminists speak for &quot;all women&quot;. (Crenshaw:154) Oppression cannot be detangled or separated easily in the same way identities cannot be separated easily. It is impossible to address the problem of sexism without addressing racism, as many women experience both racism and sexism. This theory can also be applied to the antiracist movement, which rarely addresses the problem of sexism, even though it is thoroughly intertwined with the problem of racism. Feminism remains white, and antiracism remains male. In essence, any theory that tries to measure the extent and manner of oppression Black women face will be wholly incorrect without using intersectionality.

Patricia Hill Collins wrote a book entitled &quot;Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness and the Politics of Empowerment&quot;, which articulated &quot;Black Feminist Thought&quot; in relation to intersectionality with a focus on the plight of Black women in face of the world, the white feminist movement, and the male antiracism movement. Collins references Crenshaw&#x27;s concept of intersectionality and relates it to the matrix of domination, &quot;The term matrix of domination describes this overall social organization within which intersecting oppressions originate, develop, and are contained.&quot;.

=== Intersectionality and the matrix of domination ===
Both intersectionality and the matrix of domination help sociologists understand power relationships and systems of oppression in society. The matrix of domination looks at the overall organization of power in society while intersectionality is used to understand a specific social location of an identity using mutually constructing features of oppression.

The concept of intersectionality today is used to move away from one dimensional thinking in the matrix of domination approach by allowing for different power dynamics of different identity categories at the same time. Researchers in public health are using Intersectionality-Based Policy Analysis (IBPA) Framework to show how social categories intersect to identify health disparities that evolve from factors beyond an individual&#x27;s personal health. Ferlatte applied an IBPA framework and used structural interviews to identify barriers to the allocation of HIV prevention funding for gay men. He highlighted policy more likely to cause harm than reduce the epidemic stemming from policy makers missing the ‘intersections of oppression, sex panic, and medicalization’.

Intersectionality can also be used to correct for the over-attribution of traits to groups and be used to emphasize unique experiences within a group. As a result, the field of social work is introducing intersectional approaches in their research and client interactions. At the University of Arkansas, the curriculum for a Master of Social Work (MSW) is being amended to include the Multi-Systems Life Course (MSLC) approach. Christy and Valandra apply an MSLC approach to intimate partner violence and economic abuse against poor women of color to explain that symbols of safety (such as police) in one population can be symbols of oppression in another. By teaching this approach to future social workers, the default recommendation for these women to file a police report is amended and an intervention rooted in the individual case can emerge.

== Implications of the matrix of domination ==
Many approaches have been used that consider the concepts of identity, societal structures, and representation to be mutually exclusive, but the introduction of Patricia Hill Collins’ matrix of domination addresses the interlocking patterns of privilege and marginalization along the lines of race, class, gender, and class inside social institutions as well as at the community level. With this work has come greater recognition of the various effects that each identity holds in different societal contexts, in both the micro- and macro-level structures within the systems of oppression that exist.

=== In female criminality ===
In April Bernard&#x27;s article, &quot;The Intersectional Alternative: Explaining Female Criminality&quot;, Bernard applies Patricia Hill Collins’ work to the study of feminist criminology, as a means of explaining the cumulative effects of identity in a system of oppression on women&#x27;s decisions to commit a crime. Bernard employs an intersectional approach to dissect the complexities that act as determinant factors in a woman&#x27;s decision to partake in criminal activities, and more specifically, the limiting pressures of a patriarchal society. In particular, this article is framed in response to Robert Merton&#x27;s claims about deviance as a response to a lack of adequate resources to achieve cultural goals, as Bernard employs an intersectional paradigm model that explores female criminality as an expression of constraint and circumscription, rather than a &quot;strained reality&quot;. With this alternative framework, Bernard suggests that societal goals are not unanimous, and are instead shaped by individuals’ experiences in economic, political, and social spaces; for marginalized women, access to the means through which they build success are impacted by micro- and macro-level norms and histories that have created indicators of class (e.g. racial, economic, political, sexual) and subjugated them to limited networks. Thus, identity makes women with marginalized identities more vulnerable in the legal system, subjugates to oppressive states within multiple institutions, and creating a need for policies that move toward creating an equitable reality for them.

Nancy A. Heitzeg&#x27;s article, &quot;&#x27;Whiteness&#x27;, criminality, and double standards of deviance/social control&quot; focuses on the construct of white racial framing and the impact that has on constructing Blackness with criminality. In doing so Heitzeg speaks on the methods of social control, placed on those who are deviant from the norm of society. Mechanisms of social control find themselves helping to categorize those who are not cis-gendered and white as the &quot;Other&quot;. Heitzeg, using Patricia Hill Collin&#x27;s &quot;matrix of domination&quot; explores how shapes access to social control as well as opportunity. Deviating from the social control base that finds itself at the intersections of race, gender, and class among other differences helps to solidify who is categorized as the &quot;Other&quot;.

Markers associated with race, class, gender, etc., argues Heitzeg allows for stereotypes that allows for mitigation of a &quot;redeemable&quot; white middle class and criminalization for poor Black people and other people of color. White racial framing creates a space for constructing storylines of white deviance, simultaneously creating storylines of Black criminality. This extends itself to the &quot;medicalization&quot; of whiteness, allowing for racial framing around whiteness to allow for associations of purity and redeem-ability. The opposite is imposed upon Black people. The identifiers associated with whiteness and Blackness allow for a framework in which subjects Blackness to something that is accepted as criminal.

In the context of criminality, the Matrix of Domination, may best present itself in the statistics:

Currently the number of women imprisoned in the United States is more than one million, making them the fastest growing population in the prison industrial complex. The number of women in prison has massively increased from statistics found in the 1980s, more than eight times as many women have been reported to be either in prison, or are at the control of the criminal justice system.

Within these numbers, Black and brown women are an overrepresented population. Black women represented roughly thirty percent of the prison population while only representing thirteen percent of the female population in the United States. In addition, Hispanic women currently make up roughly sixteen percent of the prison population, while only making up eleven percent of the female population in the United States.

The facts surrounding the cases for Black and brown women who are incarcerated show a pattern of these women being from urban areas, with an emphasis on their alleged crimes being ones of involvement or association, as opposed to being the sole perpetrator. Scholars have attributed these numbers to the over-policing of these neighborhoods in which house an almost exclusively minority population. Other attributes come from the variations in arrest and sentencing policies and practices, prison expansions, especially with for profit prisons being on the rise.
=== In the welfare state ===
In the United States, especially, the matrix of domination has implications within the welfare state. Several sociological studies on the welfare state take note of state-market relations while ignoring the salient roles held by other identities such as gender, race, class, language, and age, among others. Due to the nature of the welfare state, there has not been much regard for exploring the existence of multiple axes of oppression which has led to lineation of categories of race, class, and gender. In &quot;Politics, Gender, and Concepts&quot;, Gary Goertz and Amy Mazur assert that literature about the welfare state should focus on the relationship between social positions and social policies, as well as provide a framework for investigations into the causal effects of class, gender, and race. As such, using the idea of a matrix of domination in these kinds of studies provides a basis for empirical research on the relationship between social positions and policies, and also, for a comparison between the outcomes of social policies on marginalized and privileged women.

== Intersectionality of gender and class ==

=== Benefits among class ===

The benefits that upper-class citizens receive from their employer are far different from that of working-class employees. This is due to the upper class taking jobs that give them a higher status or position, whereas the working class take jobs with lower status such as retail and blue-collar jobs. The most obvious benefit that differs between classes is the amount of money made. Upper-class workers receive significantly more pay than the working class, and while the upper class receive salaries, the lower class typically receive their pay based on hourly wages. Moreover, the chance of getting a raise is greater for the higher-ups. More benefits that the upper class enjoy over the working class are vacation time, flexible hours, retirement savings, and greater coverage of healthcare and insurance.

=== Benefits among gender ===

When it comes to workplace benefits such as health insurance coverage, pensions, sick leave, and disability plans, there are gender differences in whether or not these benefits are offered. Women are less likely to be offered pensions, health coverage and disability plans. In fact, high poverty rates among elderly women have been linked to lack of pension coverage. Additionally, many female heads of household remain on welfare because they cannot find jobs with adequate health insurance coverage. When it comes to union contracts, men are also twice as likely to be covered. This gender gap in benefits coverage may be due to the fact that women tend to have higher medical expenditures than males of the same age. As a result, some of the observed gap in wages between males and females in the United States could be the result of employers compensating for the higher cost of employer-sponsored health insurance. This further perpetuates gender discrimination because it means that firms who offer ESI (Employer Sponsored Insurance) will prefer to hire males. Another effect of women generally having greater healthcare expenses than men is that they are likely to place a higher value on insurance and be more inclined to pass up jobs for insurance-related reasons. This lowers the probability of obtaining jobs that pay higher wages directly and decrease a woman&#x27;s bargaining power with her current employer. Indeed, health insurance has a larger (negative) effect on the job mobility of women, which they attribute to women&#x27;s elevated healthcare expenses.

=== Wage gap among class ===

In the United States there is an unequal distribution of income between social classes for multiple reasons. Level of education has a great influence on average salaries. The higher the socioeconomic status (SES) of an individual the more likely they are to graduate from high school and potentially obtain a college degree, which in return increases their chances of a larger salary. The average salary of an individual with a high school diploma is about $35,000, but increases to about $60,000 by obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree after. The gap in salary increases with each additional level of education received. Those in the lower class face more obstacles and have less opportunities to pursue additional education due to their lack of resources. The wage gap is even larger for individuals affected by poverty and racial barriers. Whites have a median income of about $71,000 while blacks have a median income of about $43,000. Statistics show that blacks make up 16% of public high school graduates, 14% of those enrolling in college, and only 9% of those receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree. At the same time, whites make up 59%, 58%, and 69%, respectively. That is a 61% difference between blacks not obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree and whites graduating with one. Individuals in poverty already face a disadvantage in obtaining the same level of income as their upper class coworkers, but when also affected by racial barriers the chances of reaching the same income are even fewer.

=== Wage gap among gender ===

There is definitely intersectionality and inequality with women and men when it comes to wage gaps. Careers that pay well are often male dominated, and do not tolerate women and their personal needs. There has been a stable &quot;pay gap&quot; between men and women which has remained between 10–20% difference in their average earnings. (Women, careers and work life preferences). When discussing wage gaps between genders, scientists takes into account two questions, the first being &quot;is there differential access jobs on the basis of gender?&quot; and the second being, &quot;is women’s work perceived to have less value than comparable work done by men?&quot;. When women begin to increase their numbers in certain job positions the status or value of the job decreases. Conceptualizing intersectionality through class, gender and race then identifying the barriers that create inequality in Work organizations is found in the idea of &quot;inequality regimes&quot;. Workplaces are prominent locations to analyze the continuous efforts of inequalities because many societal inequality issues stem in such areas. In the works of Inequality Regimes: Gender, Class, and Race in Organizations, inequality in gender, race, class are examined through intersectionality in organizations. Joane Acker discussed Inequality Regimes: Gender, Class, and Race in Organizations in Sociologists for Women in Society Feminists Lecture through studies conducted using Swedish Bank. Studies have shown in the 1980s depict that wage gaps were increasing between genders. Men were being rewarded the higher paying positions such as local managers, and believed fair wages for men should be higher than fair wages for women.

=== Representation among class ===

Social class plays a large role on people&#x27;s everyday life, yet their representation is not always fair. In television and popular culture, those who fall into the lower class are often portrayed differently based on if they are a woman or a man. If they are a woman, they often are portrayed as being more intelligent and responsible than their husbands, almost acting as their mothers. The male head of the household is typically portrayed as being less intelligent, with some redeeming qualities, but typically is not respected. Together they can be shown in a light that makes them seem lazy or dishonest. The upper class however, does not face these same issues with representation in the media. The man of the household takes on stereotypical male qualities, while the woman takes on stereotypical female qualities. The children in this upper class scenario are what provides entertainment value, rather than focusing on the unintelligent and unorganized adults as in the lower class model. Overall, in the upper-class family unit, they are portrayed as organized and put together, while the lower class model are portrayed as lazy and unorganized.

=== Representation among gender ===

Whether one is a manager of a fast food restaurant or the CEO of a Fortune 500 company, authority is power and power is advantage. But just like the widespread power struggle, there is a widespread equality struggle. One of the largest workplace and societal inequalities is the inequality between genders. A prime example of this is the wage gap. Women in 2016 earned, on average, 82 cents to a man&#x27;s dollar. This unequal pay is part of the reason that many women are the ones to leave the workforce when it is determined that a stay-at-home parent is required; if women are contributing less to the household income, it will make less of an impact if they quit their jobs. Women are also not granted the same opportunities for employment as men. A clear example is the U.S. military. Women were banned from all combat roles until recently. In 2011, only 14 percent of the armed forces were female, and only 14 percent of officers were female. Another example is the U.S. congress. In 2015, 80 percent of the Senate was male, and only 20 was female. This numbers were similar for the House, at 80.6 percent male and 19.4 percent female. The gender composition of the military and the government, along with the wage gap, shines a lights on the gender inequality experienced right here at home, but this inequality is more greatly felt abroad. Some countries place strict limitations on women, not allowing them to vote or work or even drive a car. While the U.S. is seen as a country of dreams and opportunity, is far easier to see this when compared to an even more unequal country. The United States has been trending toward gender equality in recent years, but it has a while to go.

=== Research contributions ===

An article found in the November 1998 issue of &quot;Social Problems&quot; details the conflict involving racial domination by identifying the complexity African-Americans face. In many cases, sociologists and laypersons alike are often limited in their approach to the problem. Michelle Byng, in &quot;Mediating Discrimination: Oppression among African-American Muslim Women&quot;—the 1998 article—brings to focus new approaches to understanding discrimination, but also, she writes to illustrate the many overlooked opportunities in which the discriminated are able to empower themselves in certain situations.

==Intersectionality in court cases==
There are certain cases that are widely cited in discussing intersectional discrimination.

In &quot;DeGraffenreid vs. General Motors&quot; Emma DeGraffenreid and four other black female production workers were laid off, and took it to court claiming that the company was violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because, &quot;it perpetrated past discriminatory practices of not hiring Black females.&quot; The court looked at each of the categories, race and gender, separately therefore they missed the discrimination of a person being both African-American and female. &quot;It was argued, black women can expect little protection as long as approaches, such as that in &quot;DeGraffenreid&quot;, which completely obscure problems of intersectionality prevail.&quot;

Another case, &quot;Maivan Lam v. University of Hawai&#x27;i&quot;, where intersectionality was the core reason behind the problem that emerged. Maivan Lam was not offered a job twice when she applied to be the Director of the Law School&#x27;s Pacific Asian Legal Studies Program. Two times, the university was looking for a director and when the final offer came around, and she was the best candidate available, the university simply cancelled their search. In the first search, Professor Lam made it to the final round, but was not offered the job before the whole search was simply shut down. The second time, the position was offered to another candidate and the other candidate refused to accept, the search was simply cancelled without it being offered to Professor Lam. When Lam brought this situation up to the Dean, he suggested reopening the search so that male candidates who had not applied on time could submit their applications. It is stated, &quot;Early in the 1989-90 academic year, the new appointments committee reviewed applications for a commercial law position. At one meeting, a male committee member stated that the Law School should not have two women teaching commercial law. This comment was reported to the Dean, who said that he recognized that the professor had difficulty dealing with women but took no action to remove him from the committee or otherwise to remedy the problem.&quot;. There was clear intersectionality as Professor Lam was not only arguing regards to race but also how her gender affected her position.

In the case, &quot;Jefferies v. Harris County Community Action Association&quot;, April 21, 1980, Dafro M. Jefferies claimed that her former employer failed to promote her to a higher position because of her race and sex. In 1967 she was employed by Harris County Community Action Association as a Secretary to the Director of Programs. She was later promoted to Personal Interviewer in 1970. Everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction for her. However, between 1971 and April 1974, Jefferies applied for promotions in various positions and departments without any luck. She realized that her employer was discriminating against her when two Field Representative positions opened. Jefferies immediately applied. However, the positions were already staffed by a white female and black male the same day that she was told about the vacant position. The company had purposefully told her about the open positions knowing that they were already filled by other staff members. After several complaints to the company, on April 23, 1974 Jefferies was placed on probation. In June 1974, she was terminated from the job because she had called the company out for discriminating against her because of her race and sex. There was clear evidence of intersectionality in this case, she argued; she was not promoted to a higher position because she was both black and a female. However, the court ultimately disagreed with her, insofar as there existed zero concrete evidence to support her case.

<text>Austral University of Chile ( or UACh) is a Chilean research university based primarily in Valdivia, with satellite campuses in Puerto Montt and Coyhaique. Founded on September 7, 1954, it is one of the eight original Chilean Traditional Universities. It operates as a nonprofit self-owned corporation under private law, and receives significant state-funding.

==History==

===Foundation and early years (1942-1968)===
In 1942, the &quot;Sociedad de Amigos del Arte (Society of friends of art)&quot; was formed in the city of Valdivia. Aside from promoting culture, one of the society&#x27;s main goals was to establish a university in the city. The idea of creating a university was presented to the national congress in the 1950s by the senator for Valdivia, Carlos Acharán Pérez de Arce, who later succeeded in consolidating the project. In a meeting held on 16 February 1954 supporters of installing a university created a directory and proclaimed Eduardo Morales Miranda as president of it. The initial founding depended on donations from private persons including some industrial businessmen. After have been founded by decree on 7 September 1954 the university was inaugurated on 12 March 1955 by president Carlos Ibáñez del Campo. The inauguration was also attended by the rectors of the University of Chile and the States Technical University as well as the ambassadors of Venezuela and Argentina and representatives of the Netherlands, Germany and the United States.

The first degree programmes to be taught at the university were fine arts, agronomy, forestry engineering and veterinary medicine, each of which had also its own faculty.

On June 3 of 1968 UACh was granted autonomy from the University of Chile as law 16.848 was enacted. The autonomy did that UACh became allowed to decide its own plans and study programs and put the university out of the tutelage of the University of Chile.

===Development (1969-1999)===

During the military regime&#x27;s privatization of higher education in the 1980s UACh incorporated the successor regional see of &quot;Universidad Técnica del Estado&quot;, the &quot;Instituto Profesional de Valdivia&quot;. By doing this, UACh prevented an offshoot university from being created there as it happened around the country with regional sees of major universities. With the incorporation of &quot;Instituto Profesional de Valdivia&quot;, that corresponds to present day &#x27;Campus Miraflores, UACh started to grant bachelor degrees in engineering and got its Engineering Faculty.

In 1993 the university held the Valdivia International Film Festival for the first time to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its cinema Cine Club which has since then developed to one of the most important film festivals in Chile.

===Recent history (2000-present)===
With the arrival of Centro de Estudios Científicos (CECS) to Valdivia in 2000 the city was further outlined as a research center, as CECS brought expertise on biophysics, molecular physiology, theoretical physics, glaciology and climate change to the city. The arrival of CECS was seen as positive by UACh&#x27;s administration since CECS research do not overlap UACh&#x27;s main research areas and, as a scientific research corporation, do not compete in student enrollment. However, in 2007 UACh and CECS got involved in a controversy when the Regional Council of Los Lagos Region granted regional funds that had been put into tender to CECS without attending to the meeting where UACh&#x27;s and University of Los Lagos joint project was presented. Deputy Gabriel Ascencio (DC) accused Claudio Bunster, director of CECS, of using his personal influence among politicians and the Council of Innovation for Competitiveness (of which he is member of) to gain more resources.

On Monday 3 December 2007 the Emilio Pugín building of the Faculty of Sciences caught fire. The building, located on Teja island Campus housed considerable amounts of chemicals and scientific equipment which could not be saved. Several research projects had to be halted or aborted due to loss of equipment, samples and data. Due to the spreading of toxic smoke the police had to evacuate a total of 10,000 people from Isla Teja. Firefighting companies from the neighboring cities of Osorno, La Unión and Paillaco had to come to assist to control and extinguish the fire. The building hosted the institutes of chemistry, physics, zoology, microbiology and botanics, including some laboratories. The cost of the damage was estimated at 5000 million Chilean pesos (about 10 million US dollars). Finally, 22% of the damage were not covered by the according insurances, but directly financed by the Chilean government. 
On May 13 of 2008 the student federation of UACh decided to go on strike since they considered that a request list sent to the university administration was answered in too loose terms. The strike and occupation of the university by students ended in late June when the rector Victor Cubillos and the directory ceded on several points but was however still heavily criticized both from students and from sectors of the faculty where they considered that he had ceded too much to students. In April 2010 the reconstruction of the Emilio Pugin building of the Sciencie Faculty, started the competitive bidding. And in this year it would start the reconstruction. Cubillos won the 2010 election with 229 votes, 13 less than the prior election. the second term ended in June 2014.

==Campus==

UACh main campus, Isla Teja Campus, occupies the whole northwest of Isla Teja in Valdivia. Campus Isla Teja is the home of UACh&#x27;s administration, Cine Club, botanical garden and most faculties. The botanical garden is a recreational area as well as a place of study with a total of around 950 plant species growing in its 12 ha. Most plants in the botanical garden belong to Valdivian temperate rain forest but there are others with exotic origins. The waters of Cau-Cau River that flows through the northern parts of the botanical garden allows a section of wetland plant species included in the garden.

The engineering faculty operates in Campus Miraflores located along Valdivia River south of Valdivia&#x27;s Plaza de Armas. A third campus exists in Puerto Montt where business administration, speech and language pathology and aquaculture are studied. UACh has several other properties spread through Los Ríos and Los Lagos Region such as Parque Arboretum in northern Isla Teja, the Calfuco field station in the coast near Niebla and the forests of San Pablo de Tregua in the Andean foothills. A much smaller campus known as Campus Patagonia is located in Coyhaique.

==Research==

UACh is one of the leading universities of Chile in matters of scientific research. It was ranked second only to the University of Chile in scientific research by &quot;El Mercurio&quot; and was the third university to receive most of government &quot;Mecesup&quot; research funds in 2008. Some of the fields where UACh scientists have made contributions include:

*Archaeology: In archeology university scientist Tom Dillehay, led the excavations of at Monte Verde, one of the earliest archaeological sites in the Americas. Another site investigated by university scientists is Chan-Chan a site that gives name to the Archaic Chan-Chan Complex.
*Dairy technology and science: The university&#x27;s &quot;Centro Tecnológico de la Leche&quot; (lit. Milk Technology Centre) have been credited by scholar Paulina Rytkönen for being behind the higher dairy productivity in Los Ríos Region when compared with adjacent Los Lagos Region.
*Dendrochronology: Scientists at the Dendrochronology Laboratory of UACh has set up the longest dendrochronology in the Southern Hemisphere going back 5666 years. Researchers have also reconstructed the temperatures of the last 3622 years with tree rings from Fitzroya and have used a dendrochronology network of Lenga Beech, spanning from Talca to Navarino Island, to investigate global warming in the recent decades.
*Mapudungun language: UACh is one of the main sites of Mapudungun linguistic studies and teaching. This is partly due to Professor María Catrileo Chiguailaf, who received in 2009 the &quot;Provincial Prize for Conservation of National Monuments&quot; for her studies. Her work has focused on the phonology and morpho-syntax of the Mapudungun language and especially the verb forms. Catrileo may be the only living Mapuche to have mastered Spanish, English, and Mapudungun.
*Palaeontology: Palaeontological studies at Southern Chile have involved several UACh academics among them geoarchaeologist Mario Pino who participated at the excavation of the Quaternary fossil site of Pilauco Bajo in Osorno where the remains of a species of &quot;Gomphotherium&quot; were discovered. Two other &quot;Gomphotherium&quot; fossil sites in Los Ríos Region are planned to be excavated by university scientists in the future.
*Virology: Researchers from the Faculty of Medicine and Faculty of Science led a series of joint medical, viral and zoological research on the transmittance of Hantavirus between rodents and humans. Hantavirus was first detected in Chile in 1995 but is believed to have been present much time before. According to Dr. Luis Zaror the most important UACh discovery regarding Hantavirus was made in 2005 when Hanta antigens were found on the salivary glands of deceased persons. UACh academics working at the Laboratory of Virology had contributed to diminish the initial mortality of Pulmonar Hantavirus with 60% in Los Ríos Region below the national average of 37%.

===Scientific journals===
The university publishes several scientific journals three of them, &quot;Bosque&quot;, &quot;Archivos de Medicina Veterinaria&quot; and &quot;Estudios Filológicos&quot; are part of ISI&#x27;s bibliographic database. &quot;BOSQUE&quot; is published by the Faculty of Forest Science. &quot;BOSQUE&#x27;s&quot; first number was published in 1975 and was yearly issued until 1985. From 1985 to 2003 it was issued twice a year and from 2003 on thrice a year. The topics covered in &quot;BOSQUE&quot; are management and production of forestry resources, wood science and technology, silviculture, forestry ecology, natural resources conservation, and rural development associated with forest ecosystems. Contributions are articles, notes and opinions, both in Spanish and English. &quot;BOSQUE&quot; became part of ISI&#x27;s bibliographic database in 2009.

In matters of literature, communication science and linguistics the university has published the journal &quot;Documentos Lingüísticos y Literarios&quot; (DLL) since 1977. &quot;Documentos Lingüísticos y Literarios&quot; has two sections, one dedicated to articles and comments on literature, linguistics and communication science and another were original literary pieces are published. DLL is one of the few journals containing native Mapudungun literature and linguistic articles.

== Museum network ==
Universidad Austral de Chile runs through its museology department several museums in Valdivia and southern Chile, including; UACh&#x27;s Contemporary Art Museum, Philippi Museum on the 19th century exploration and settlement of southern Chile and Maurice van de Maele Museum on history and anthropology. The museology department has collections of indigenous artifacts including early indigenous ceramics as well as Mapuche silverwork and textiles. In addition to this there is a collection of objects from the early human settlement of Monte Verde. Other collections include 19th century clothing and toys and an extensive photographical archive dating back to 1850.

==Rankings==

In a 2011 university ranking of Quacquarelli Symonds the Austral University of Chile was ranked 30th among Latin American universities, 5th among Chilean universities and second among Chilean universities outside Santiago.

In &quot;El Mercurio&quot;&#x27;s 2006 ranking of the &quot;Best Universities in the Country&quot;, UACh received the highest score in &quot;teaching quality&quot; of any Chilean university. The same article also listed UACh second only to Universidad de Chile in research quality, and ranked the Valdivia-based university third place overall among Chilean universities. As both universities that earned higher rankings are located in Santiago (U. de Chile and Pontifical Catholic University of Chile), UACh thus became the highest ranking university in Chile outside of the nation&#x27;s capital.

In the most recent Chilean university ranking released by AméricaEconomía magazine, released in 2009, UACh earned an overall ranking of 7th place, and 4th among universities outside Santiago. In the undergraduate ranking, nursing performed best with 3rd place, then medicine and agronomy at 4th place, then law at 7th place, kinesiology at 8th place and Business Administration (Ingeniería Comercial) at 10th place.

In 2006 UACh&#x27;s medical students got the second highest marks in Chile in the National Medicine Exam after PUC. In 2007, though, UACh medical students dropped down to fifth place, and by 2008 they were down to sixth place.

The proclamation grants the university special protection and conservation of the campus and its space by the state; therefore, any intervention to the same has to be reported to the Council of Monuments, while any damage and type of vandalism that jeopardizes the integrity and security of the campus will be seriously penalized according to the law that regulates and covers the National Monuments, as well as the prompt construction of the 1st and only Bío Bío Technological Science Park (PACYT) in all of Chile located in the Bío-Bío Region, near the campus of the Universidad de Concepción; which at the same time will be in charge of the administration, organization, and projection of new ideas with a view to the future of it together with the Government of Chile; this initiative is going to be projected as a productive space of the future and a relevant pole of the development of the country, the place where all the creative potential will be housed, knowledge and innovations of high impact will be generated.

==History==
===Background===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many scholars from Concepción started to plead for the construction of a university for the south of Chile where it would be possible to study professional degrees outside the capital, Santiago. However, a project of this magnitude required a high level of organization, which as yet did not exist. In February 1917, the newspaper El Sur reported:
===Committee Pro-University===
On March 23, 1917, the first official meeting took place to realise two goals of the citizens of Concepción: a clinical hospital and a university.

After debate, a committee was named to take charge of the construction of these two projects. The projects were closely related because the hospital would become the base of the new university&#x27;s medical school. Some notable members of the committee included Enrique Molina Garmendia, Pedro Nolasco, Edmundo Larenas and Virginio Gómez.

===Foundation===
The commission then presented the documentation to Congress that would officially create the university. These were sent and approved, and on May 14, 1919, Enrique Molina Garmendia founded the university and became its first rector.

Nowadays, the university is funded by various organisations belonging to the &quot;University of Concepción Corporation&quot;. The Lottery is one of the main organisations. With this funding, the University of Concepción has become one of the most modern and important universities in Chile.

==Organization==

The University of Concepción is divided into three campuses, located in Chillán, Los Ángeles and Concepción. The latter is the main and most important campus.

===Concepción Campus===
The university is located in the University District. The whole campus comprises what is known as the Ciudad Universitaria (University City), which also contains museums, sculptures and parks. Today, the campus has an area of 1,425,000 m2, of which 239,856 are built upon. It is the knowledge, science, culture, technology and research centre of the city of Concepción. The &quot;Presencia de América Latina&quot; mural by Jorge González Camarena is within the Casa del Arte on the university campus.

In 2010, the University of Concepción campus was named one of Chile&#x27;s most important architectural works from the first half of the 20th century. The &quot;Obra Bicentenario&quot; award distinguishes works that, in the last 100 years, have changed the face of Chile&#x27;s cities and most improved the quality of life of its inhabitants.

===Chillán Campus===

The Chillán campus was founded in 1955 with the support of many institutions such as the United Nations, the OAS, American and European universities, and others. It mainly focuses on agricultural sciences and has approximately 2,000 students, more than 100 academic staff and 250 administrative staff.

===Los Ángeles Campus===

The Los Ángeles campus was founded in 1962 at the request of the people of the province to the university rector, David Stitchkin Branover. Currently, it has 1,300 students and 35 full-time teachers, plus other part-time academic staff.

==History==

University of Magallanes, a member of the Honorable Council of Rectors of Chilean Universities, is a corporation of public law, autonomous, with legal personality and own patrimony.

The university registers its origin in 1961, giving its first courses in Mechanics and Electricity. Through the following 50 years, it developed through various stages and denominations. It was originally created as a campus of the Technical State University. Three years later in 1964 it was denominated University College of Punta Arenas. In March 1981 it became the Magellan Professional Institute and finally on October 3 of the same year it acquired its actual formalization as University of Magallanes. Since then, it legitimizes and consolidates its position as the only state institution of higher education in the Magallanes region, with a strong tradition in the Chilean university system and quality accreditation from the time when universities were summoned to participate in these processes at the country level.

The Faculty of Engineering was one of the first to be created. The Faculty of Economics and Law was created in late 2002 as a result of academic reorganization of the former Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences.

More recently, the Faculty of Health Sciences and the Faculty of Education and Social Sciences were created in May 2014, as a result of the reorganization of the former Faculty of Humanities, Social Sciences and Health. The School of Medicine was established in January 2014 being Dr. Marcelo Navarrete Signorile its founding director.

==Curriculum innovation and the Bologna process==

In 2004 the ALFA Tuning Latin America Project aimed to &#x27;fine tune&#x27; the educational structures that exist in Latin America, initiating a debate whose aim were to identify and improve co-operation between higher education institutions, so as to develop excellence, effectiveness, and transparency. This was an independent project, promoted and coordinated by universities in many different countries, both Latin American and European.

Since 2008 to date, the university started a process of curriculum redesign to focus on competences, skills development and learning outcomes. During the redesign process the university ascribed to the Credit Transfer and Accumulation System for its graduate and postgraduate courses. As to 2015 80% of the courses are redesigned and denominated in credits.

<doc id="1271745" wikidata="Q634259" url="?curid=1271745" title="Playa Ancha University">
<text>Playa Ancha University of Educational Sciences (), mostly known as Playa Ancha University or UPLA, is a public university in Valparaíso, Chile. It is part of the Chilean Traditional Universities, belonging to the Council of Rectors, a select group of twenty-five chilean universities. The university has two campuses: the major one in Playa Ancha, Valparaíso, and the second one in San Felipe.

==History==
The university was founded in 1948 as the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile with the intention to enhance the study of languages.

=== The Creation of the Pedagogical Institute (1948–1973) ===

The Pedagogical Institute of Valparaíso was founded in 1948, as the initiative of Oscar Guzmán Escobar, a lawyer and professor at the then Valparaíso Law School of the University of Chile, with the intention of promoting the study of Spanish and some foreign languages. It was initially located on Calle Colón in Valparaíso, in the former campus of the current School of Law of the University of Valparaíso, currently the School of Social Work of the same university. It was supported in its initiative by the professors of Valparaíso Emilio Muñoz Mena, Juan Montedónico Napoli and Pedro Contreras Valderrama, among others.

In 1950, due to the quality of its activity, and after inspection by the members of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education of the University of Chile, it received by Supreme Decree the status of State cooperator in education, its exams being valid and rendered before the official commissions designated by the Casa de Bello.

The first courses taught by the then Institute were Pedagogy in Spanish, French and English, while in 1951 a Philosophy course was created and a year later the first School of Journalism in the country and a Women&#x27;s Normal School were established. The University of Chile initially contributed with very outstanding professors from Santiago, such as Héctor Castillo, Ricardo Benavides, and Professor Cedomil Goic, among others, together with outstanding professors from the region such as Juan Montedónico, Carlos Pantoja Gómez, and Félix Morales Pettorino, who formed a team that took advantage, together with teachers from the Liceo Eduardo de la Barra in Valparaíso and with people who had begun their professional training in Pedagogy, emerging as assistant professors.

Due to the request of its director and the dean of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education of the University of Chile, Mr. Eugenio Pererira Salas, Decree No. 9,118 of October 13, 1954 was issued, on the basis of which the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile in Valparaíso was created, which began to function as such the following year. This document was signed by the President of the Republic, Mr. Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, and his Minister of Education, Mr. Tobías Barros Ortiz.

=== The Military Dictatorship (1973–1990) ===

On September 11, 1973, a coup d&#x27;état took place, to which, according to various accounts, the University did not offer resistance, being invaded by military assault around 12:15 by the &quot;Maipo&quot; 2nd Infantry Regiment, despite the fact that at that time there were already few students at the University (alerted by the situation in the country). The intervention led to massive arrests of students, academics and officials. In 1981 —by decision of the military dictatorship— the Valparaíso branch of the University of Chile was separated from its main campus (located in the city of Santiago de Chile), creating the University of Valparaíso first. Two months later, in a second split, the Faculty of Education and Letters was transformed into the Instituto Profesional Academia Superior de Ciencias Pedagógicas de Valparaíso (Professional Institute of the Higher Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Valparaíso). This transition meant the significant loss of its infrastructure and the allocation of a reduced state contribution (0.6% of the total direct fiscal contribution), in addition to other problems arising from the policies and definitions implemented by the authoritarian regime that affected academics, officials and students.

Law 18,434 of 4 September 1985, created the Playa Ancha University, which succeeded the Academia Superior de Ciencias Pedagógicas de Valparaíso and the University of Chile.

=== The UPLA nowadays (1990–present) ===
The return to democracy in 1990 brought with it the election of the first democratically elected rector by direct vote of academics, Professor Pedro Norman Cortés Larrieu being elected on that occasion. In 1991, its San Felipe campus began operating.  On the other hand, there was an important development of the infrastructure: the Faculty of Arts is built in 1995, the adjacent lands to the central house are acquired, the FEUPLA is put in operation with Confech vote and the kindergarten &quot;Colmenita&quot; is built, with the purpose of providing room to university parents or employees of the University.

With the advent of the year 2000, the changes continue to take place.  The new building of Natural and Exact Sciences is inaugurated, as well as the Faculty of Social Sciences, which offers degrees in Sociology (2002), Psychology (2013), Journalism and Library Science.  The performing arts hall (for students of Theatre) is created, and moving the casino to a new location next to the Faculty of Arts.  In 2008 the new University library is inaugurated.

Towards 2013, the Faculty of Health and Engineering is created, acquiring the Independencia campus.  In 2012 two multipurpose domes were acquired, one located in the Patio de los Vientos, next to the Faculty of Arts, and the other in the San Felipe Campus. In 2014 the Nursing laboratories were created, in 2012 the Center for Advanced Studies (CEA) and the Vice-Rector&#x27;s Office for Research, Innovation and Postgraduate Studies were installed in Viña del Mar.

In October 2014, with 71.5% of the votes in a trystman plebiscite, the elimination of the Board of Directors and the creation of a University Senate, which represents the three estates, students, officials and academics, is approved.

== Symbols ==

=== Emblem ===
The emblem of the Playa Ancha University is a lighthouse illuminating both sectors with a lone star leading the way (in reference to being at night). Its inspiration comes from the Punta Ángeles Lighthouse, created in 1837 under the presidency of José Joaquín Prieto. This is located next to the University.

==Faculties and careers==



The Playa Ancha University has 36 undergraduate degrees in Valparaiso (of which 3 are dual day and evening courses) and 6 in San Felipe. Additionally, it has 14 technical careers (7 in Valparaíso and 7 in San Felipe)

In 2007 the construction of the new university library began, located near the most important buildings of the institution.

=== Administration ===

During its existence, the Playa Ancha University has belonged to the University of Chile, depending directly on the Faculty of Humanities and Letters of Santiago; and, after the 1968 University Reform, to the Valparaíso branch of the Casa de Bello, both as an Area-Faculty of Humanities, at first, and later as a Faculty of Education and Letters. This determined that its superior authorities were named Director, and later, Dean.

As a consequence of the 1981 University Reform, it became an independent entity, either as the Higher Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of Valparaíso, or as the University of Playa Ancha. Here, its superior authority is called Rector.

A high percentage of its instructors have had access to various training programs, and 82% of them have master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees.
Additionally, the university publishes &quot;Revista Chungará&quot; a journal on anthropology and archaeology.

== History ==

The University of Tarapacá was founded in 1981 through DFL No. 150, issued on December 11, 1981, as an autonomous public corporation with legal personality and its own assets. It was established as part of the decentralization process carried out during the higher education reform under the military dictatorship, beginning its activities in 1982.

Although officially founded in 1981 from the Professional Institute of Arica, the University of Tarapacá has a history spanning over 40 years as the successor of both the Arica branch of the University of Chile (which was transformed into the Professional Institute of Arica in 1981) and the Arica branch of the Universidad Católica del Norte. Most of its faculty members originally came from the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso, which founded the Universidad Católica del Norte.

During its first year, the university established the Faculty of Sciences and the Faculty of Education and Humanities.

Years later, in 1994, through a real estate acquisition, the university obtained the Saucache and Azapa campuses.

In 2004, the university launched the Iquique branch and inaugurated its central library at the Saucache campus. The following year, an annex to the library was opened, and university schools were created. In 2006, the Institute of Advanced Research was established. By 2007, the Esmeralda branch in Iquique was under construction.

Since its founding, the University of Tarapacá has played a key role in the economic, social, and cultural development of the region. It was accredited for five years (2012-2017) by the National Accreditation Commission, covering the areas of institutional management, undergraduate teaching, research, and community engagement.

== Administration ==

The highest organizational body of the University of Tarapacá is the Board of Directors. Among its functions is proposing a shortlist to the President of the Republic for the appointment of the Rector and designating the senior officials of the university in accordance with its statutes.

The Rector&#x27;s Office is the highest unit responsible for overseeing the academic, administrative, and financial activities of the university. This responsibility is held by the Rector.

Regarding the oversight of the legality of the actions of the university&#x27;s authorities, the responsibility lies with the Comptroller&#x27;s Office. This office also monitors the income and use of funds, reviews the accounts of individuals in charge of the Corporation&#x27;s assets, and performs other related functions as assigned by the Board of Directors. Its support units are the Audit Office and the Legal Control Office.

The current Rector of the University of Tarapacá is Emilio Rodríguez Ponce.

== Campus and Branches ==

Geographically, the Main Campus is located in the Arica and Parinacota Region. The university has three campuses in Arica, one of which is situated in the locality of San Miguel de Azapa. Additionally, the university has a branch in the Tarapacá Region, in Iquique. 

=== Velásquez Campus === 
This campus is located in downtown Arica, very close to the city&#x27;s coastline. It has over 1.5 hectares of constructed area on a total surface exceeding three hectares. Previously, the facilities housed the Arica branch of the University of Chile, and in 2007, part of its premises were leased to the Regional Government of Arica and Parinacota for temporary use. 

The university&#x27;s Rectorate, Vice-Rectorate, and Grand Auditorium are located on this campus. Academically, it hosts the Technical Training Center of Tarapacá (CFT) and most of the Faculty of Sciences.

<text>The University of Valparaíso (UV) is a state public university in Chile, with its headquarters and the majority of its campuses in the city of Valparaíso. It has several other campuses in the Valparaíso Region and in Santiago, which is 100 km from Valparaiso.

Taking its current name as an autonomous university on February 12, 1981, UV is heir to the most longstanding higher education tradition in Valparaiso and its region.

As the major Pacific port south of San Francisco, Valparaiso was an important centre of business in the nineteenth century. Formal studies in law began there in 1878. By 1911, teaching had evolved into Chile’s first regional School of Law, part of the national University of Chile (&quot;UCH&quot;, which in turn can trace its origins back through two colonial universities to 1622, some 82 years after the Spanish began their colonisation of today’s central Chile).

Two private universities would form in Valparaiso in the 1920s and 1930s—what would become Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María (UTFSM, or USM) and Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (PUCV, or UCV)—as state-backed higher education was also consolidated under the aegis of the national Universidad de Chile system.

In 1972, public university education in Valparaiso was organized as a Seat (&quot;Sede&quot;) of UCH; UV inherited all of this except for the Teaching Institute, which would eventually become the basis of the Universidad de Playa Ancha. On February 12, 1981 the University of Valparaiso adopted its present name and autonomous form. The creation of public regional universities was an important component of the economic reforms undertaken under the military rule that lasted until 1990.

UV is one of sixteen members of the Consortium of State Universities of Chile. All of these took their more or less current structure following a decision to divide the Universidad de Chile and the State Technical University into autonomous entities. UV and all state universities are among the 25 members of Chile’s Council of University Rectors (“CRUCH”); these 25 are often referred to as the “traditional” universities, as opposed to the other “new private” universities. UV is also in the Grouping of Regional Universities of Chile, all of whose members are public and have been discussed (in English) together as public regional universities.

Higher education contributing much to its economy, Valparaiso is Chile&#x27;s &quot;college town&quot;. Three other traditional universities are based in Valparaiso – UTFSM, PUCV and &quot;Universidad de Playa Ancha&quot; (UPLA) – all of these are organized more in a “campus” style than UV, although Católica has departments strewn throughout the city and branch campuses in the region. UV’s various faculties and schools form a university quarter the length of the plain (&quot;plano&#x27;) &#x27;of central Valparaiso, between the main UPLA campus in the south and in the north the main PUVC building.

Since January 2021 the rector of the university has been Osvaldo Corrales.

<text>The Metropolitan University of Educational Sciences ( (UMCE), is a public and traditional university located in the commune of Ñuñoa, Chile. It is the fourth oldest university in the country, founded in 1889 as college of the University of Chile.

== History ==
===Origins===

Ignacio Domeyko, scientist and professor of the National Institute José Miguel Carrera, manifests for the first time -during one year of 1842- the need to change the education system in Chile, inspired by the models that are being implemented in Europe where it was starting to develop a new science: pedagogy. At that time, Domeyko was a young immigrant in the university lessons around his homeland, particularly in Paris, France, he gave a lot of knowledge that was not limited to the natural sciences, if it was not an innovation in ideas for the organization that did not find education in this country, and that motivated him to start a slow but significant intellectual work.

The proposal of the Polish-nationalized Chilean teacher was that a normal school was created similar to the one he had known by the hand of the French philosopher Victor Cousin. In this project, use a dozen of the laws that were granted from the liberal government of Francisco Antonio Pinto and Diaz de la Puente to the National Institute in 1829, students from all over the country, settle in a special department of the prominent lyceum for two years, reviewing the studies that have already been taught in their schools, and then specialize in the area they are most interested in for another two years at the university.

Diego Barros Arana, philosopher and historian, assumes the rector of the National Institute between 1863 and 1872. Noticing from the outset the lack of preparation of Chilean teaching staff, he also realized that even under the direction of this institution, which had the best national teachers (among them the professors Amunátegui, Vendel-Heyl, Lobeck, Pizarro) 14, the teaching was rough and did not have the didactics that he considered necessary. In this period, he would create a failed Teachers&#x27; Association.

Many intellectuals were educated by this eminent historian (who before becoming rector, was professor since 1838 in which he is also his alma mater) among which Valentín Letelier, the main intellectual manager of the Pedagogical Institute, who would be strongly moved with the way of educating Arana, who never stopped visiting the classrooms or the students, concerned at all times not to be a simple minister of faith in charge of certifying a certain event, but to excite, interest and guide the intelligences educated.

Its creation was firmly defended by numerous statesmen and teachers, among whom Don Valentín Letelier distinguished himself, who defended the Pedagogical with so much integrity that he even affirmed that suppressing it is making it impossible to train Chilean professors; is to make us perpetual tributaries of foreign pedagogy. Especially influenced by the aforementioned experience he had with Barros Arana during his basic studies:
&quot;In Chile it is generally believed that any engineer can be a good teacher of mathematics, that every doctor is competent in the natural sciences, and that the teaching of the humanities is put in good hands when entrusted to lawyers. This is a very serious error because the most proper thing to assess the suitability of a teacher is not his knowledge, it is his didactics.&quot;

Manuel Montt would try to take up Domeyko&#x27;s original idea of annexing the hypothetical Pedagogical Institute to the National Institute, which would award 20 scholarships for aspiring professors, but in doing so it would be inevitable to absorb the old establishment for the new one, as had happened before when the Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera disarmed the entire building and academic body of the Royal University of San Felipe in 1813, so the idea was discarded.

===The Pedagogical Institute===
In 1888, during the government of the liberal president José Manuel Balmaceda, the Minister of Justice, Worship and Public Instruction (equivalent to the current Ministry of Education) Federico Puga Borne - as well as Letelier, a former institute and former student of Professor Arana - builds the formation decree of the Pedagogical Institute of the University of Chile, which safeguarded the budget that allowed to give life to the project after 40 years of waiting. The sum was forty thousand Chilean pesos, and was signed the following year by the new minister Julio Bañados Espinosa on April 29, 1889.

Minister Bañados contacted Valentín Letelier and Claudio Matte, who were members of the Chilean delegation in Germany between 1883 and 1885 where they studied the German education system (Matte served as a translator for Letelier, since he was the only one who handled the German language) to implement it in the institution. Later, the future teachers would be precisely Germans.

The pedagogical was born as a boarding school, free of charge and with the obligation to provide housing, food and board to the fellows. Education was divided into two axes: humanities and sciences. Humanities was separated into four courses: Castilian / Latin, French / Greek, English / German and History / Geography. While science would be divided into mathematics and natural sciences.

Letelier knew how to channel and cement the aspirations in an establishment of international renown that took the name of Institute, since it was created under the auspices of the prestigious University of Chile, but with a modern constitution that favored research and teaching in topics related to the pedagogy, as it was used in European universities and institutes such as the Institute for Political Studies in Paris or the Colleges of Cambridge University. This model served as an example not only in Chile, where the University of Concepción highlighted with a department of teacher training created in 1919 with the same guidelines of El peda, but also in Latin America. They would be pioneers in pedagogical training in the continent. The work of the Pedagogical Institute was so important that about 80% of Chilean teachers were trained in these classrooms, coming to be considered one of the most prestigious teacher training centers in America. Numerous Pedagogical Missions were destined to form new Pedagogical Centers in other countries like Venezuela and Costa Rica.

===First Academic Group===
Minister Puga commissioned for the first time in 1888 the ambassador of Chile in Berlin, Domingo Gana Cruz, six professors of higher education: one of philosophy, one of history and geography, one third of philology, one quarter of mathematics, one fifth of physical sciences and a last of natural sciences. Thus, the ambassador understood that his future depended on the pedagogical, which for the founders of the institution, was ideal.

A select group of German teachers with extensive experience was hired who with exclusive dedication could create their chairs and dedicate themselves to research, the first academic body of the Pedagogical Institute was constituted by a Chilean, Enrique Nercasseau and Morán, and by the German professors:

*Augusto Tafelmacher, professor of mathematics, graduated from the well-known University of Göttingen, published more than twenty studies in the Annals of Mathematical and Natural Sciences of Leipzig and the Annals of the University of Chile on mathematics, educational methods and Fermat&#x27;s theorem, fact particularly remarkable since in these years nobody had written about mathematics in Chile.
*Jorge Enrique Schneider (pedagogy, philosophy, logic, methodology, moral and philosophy of science). German that since adolescence that manifested his vocation. He studied Philosophy and Zoology at the University of Jena and then Pedagogy at the University of Leipzig. Known also for founding the Liceo de Applicacion as a small academy for young people of middle and upper class and that was dependent on the Pedagogical Institute.
*Federico Albert Botanist, paleontologist and ornithologist, professor of natural sciences. Son of a merchant from Lübeck. He received his doctorate at the University of Strasbourg with a dissertation called The Commodity Metric Art. In 1883 he received the title to teach and already in Chile was a collaborator of the Annals of the University of Chile.
*Hans Steffen (history and geography). The youngest academic in the Germanic group, and that however, according to Baron Richthroten, professor at the Berlin University of Young Steffen, &quot;in the art of teaching, was superior to his peers who had long years of experience &quot;
*Federico Hanssen (philology, general grammar, linguistics, Latin, Greek, French, English, German, rhetoric and literary history).
*Reinaldo Von Lilienthal (arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry and mechanics, who spent a few months in Chile and returned to Germany, where he stood out as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time and was replaced by Augusto Tafelmacher, who practiced until 1907) .
*Federico Johow, notable botanist, who was appointed as the first director of the Pedagogical Institute (natural sciences, biology, zoology, botany and hygiene); nephew of a jurisconsult of the same name who was minister in the Supreme Court of Prussia. In 1880 he received the title of PhD in Philosophy and in 1882 the faculty of docenti, that is, the certification to practice university teaching. He was also assistant at the Botanical Institute of the University of Bonn, in 1883 he was commissioned by the Academy of Sciences of Berlin to study the Antilles and sectors of Venezuela. Professor Johow had published and continued to publish in the Gazette of Botany of Leipzig, in the Annals of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin and others, including later the Annals of the University of Chile.
*Rodolfo Lenz (grammar). He taught the &quot;living languages&quot;, studied almost all the Neo-Latin dialects, Old French, Modern, Provençal, Italian, Spanish, Gothic, Old and Modern German, Old Saxon, English, Arabic, Greek, Russian and Latin. Today in the current UMCE there is bibliographic material from the 19th century and early twentieth century of original authors in a library that bears his name (Historical Library of the Pedagogical Institute &quot;Rodolfo Lenz).
*Alfredo Beutell (chemistry and mineralogy). doctor of philosophy in 1879 and facultas docenti in 1885, assistant of the Laboratory of Chemistry of the University of Breslau and of the University of Greifswald. Important public studies on the chemical composition and optical properties of feldspars, on the precision pipette, on the water torch, on the spontaneous vial valve, etc.

Most of the teachers who came to the old Pedagogical Institute did so, in part, due to the large number of European war conflicts and the exhaustive anti-Semitic persecution. On this, the famous Chilean philosopher Carla Cordua remembers her first year at the Ricardo Cumming Street house in the following way:

We had, due to the National Socialist racial persecution in Europe, many very prominent and famous Jewish professors, who came to Spanish-America, many to Argentina, others arrived to Chile, and in that sense, their misfortune was our luck, because We had fabulous teachers, completely exceptional for the general level of Chilean university studies. (...) these people were completely exceptional, and had been scammed from Europe, particularly in Germany, but also in other countries that are anti-Semitic to this day.

=== Early 20th century ===
Despite the insistence of Letelier in leaving the Pedagogical to the wing of the Faculty of Philosophy and Humanities of the University of Chile, only at the end of 1890 the house of studies accepted this request by order of the Council of Public Instruction. This fact is extremely important for the consolidation of the university status that still preserves the pedagogical profession. Until the end of the 19th century teachers had been trained very precariously in the Normal Schools of Chile. The management of the institute was handed over to the German Fr Friedrich Richard Adelbart Johow18 and his first generation of professors graduated in 1896.
==== Liceo de Aplicación ====
The minister of public instruction of Jorge Montt&#x27;s government, Joaquín Rodríguez Rosas, issued the supreme decree No. 1554 creating the Application Lyceum, attached to the Pedagogical Institute, which began operating on March 28, 1892, with the objective of giving a space for new teachers to practice their skills with a select group of middle and upper class students from Santiago:

&quot;(...) whose vacancies are disputed every year by hundreds of parents&quot;

The first rector of this annexed establishment was the German professor of philology, philosophy and pedagogy (graduated from the University of Jena and Leipzig), Mr. Jorge Enrique Schneider, who had installed the idea of the Liceo de Aplicación in a report delivered on October 10. 1890 to the Council of Professors of Chile with the support of the director of the Pedagogical Institute, the also German, Friedrich Richard Adelbart Johow.

The first classes of the lyceum were made in a small room located in Manuel Rodriguez street, and had the particularity that they taught subjects not taught in the pedagogical such as gymnastics, singing and drawing until the success of the project increased the initial enrollment of a couple of dozens to more than 100 students per year forced to buy an installation attached to the mansion of the Cumming house. Being so close to the central house of the Pedagogical Institute further improved its educational quality and prestige, positioning it at the level of such prestigious schools as the General National Institute José Miguel Carrera or the School of the Sacred Hearts of Santiago.

====Growth and social movements of the early twentieth century====
The creation of the Institute increased the enrollment of the University of Chile considerably. 15% of the enrolled (of a total 1056 for the year 1901) were future teachers, in 1900 there were 210 enrolled and in 1917 the number increased to almost 600. Of the 1098 students housed the pedagogical in 1921, more than half were women, becoming the first instance of massive female entry to the university in the country. This increase also meant difficulties, since the old mansion of Cumming with Alameda, which also housed a small number of students from the Lyceum of Application, could not cope and the rooms soon became insufficient. The lack of was such that even the Peda, being saturated, sporadically received students from the School of Pharmacy and the Dental School, belonging to the Faculty of Medicine.

At the beginning of the 1920s, the politics of Chile - and the world - would be confronted with new ideologies and movements that would surpass the traditional political parties completely. In this sense, the university student movement took a greater maturity to understand and deal with the issues that stressed the Chilean conflict, and that the possibility of socialism came to power for the first time in national history. The students at that time showed their disagreement with the prevailing political and social system and strongly supported the workers&#x27; movement. The Student Federation of the University of Chile, which was relatively new, was composed mainly of students of the Pedagogical Institute among which Rudecindo Ortega, José Domingo Gómez Rojas, Pedro León Loyola, Pablo de Rokha, Juan Gómez Millas (who would end disappointed) of the left and socialism, years later would form the Nationalist Union Party of Chile, a fascist movement) and above all, Eugenio González Rojas, philosophy student who came to preside over the FECH between 1922 and 1923 and was Minister of Education of the Republic Socialist of Chile (this former student also founded the Federation of Secondary Students of Santiago during his stay at the National General Institute José Miguel Carrera). Years later, González travels to Venezuela to create the Pedagogical Institute of Caracas. Upon returning he is appointed Director of the Pedagogical and later Rector of the University of Chile

===Pioneers in Psychological Research===

With the twentieth century, Experimental Psychology began in Chile. This had a magnificent boom thanks to professors Guillermo Mann and J.E. Schnider who created the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, which inaugurated the experimental movement in the country. Although, since 1889 both professors were teaching psychology, it was not until 1908 that Mann was appointed to buy modern instruments and bibliographical material in Europe, establishing in a solid manner the laboratory that aimed to have the characteristics that Wilhelm Wundt used in his University of Leipzig. This would be the first psychology laboratory in a Chilean university institution21 and Wundt himself would have oriented the two teachers to the selection of instruments. While most of the instruments came from Leipzig, there was also a considerable amount of material purchased in Berlin, Paris and Milan.

Despite the good performance of this initiative, the lack of state funding (it stopped being subsidized in 1917) meant its early closure. Today, part of the laboratory survives in the Department of Psychology of the current Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Chile. About these Guillermo Mann declared in a report to the Rector Valentín Letelier:

The office of the instruments destined for psychological research can not be other than that of fixing of an exact and measurable physical conditions relations with the psychological processes that are being studied (...) We can distinguish between the methods of the psychological experiment the categories : first, methods of stimulation. Second, methods of measuring the time of psychic processes. Third, methods of determining the expressions or manifestations of these processes. And fourth, methods of measuring physical phenomena, related to psychic facts indirectly

Mann&#x27;s laboratory was reopened by Luis A. Tirapegui, a psychologist at Columbia University, who wanted to promote the advances of experimental psychology along the lines of his predecessor, the field of education and pedagogical initiatives such as the adaptation of the Binet-Terman scale to the Chilean context.20

This reopening encouraged other universities to create their own versions of the Pedagogical Laboratory, such as the Psychotechnology Laboratory of the University of Concepción, whose material was similar to the original. A laboratory was also born in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the Normal School of Copiapó with which there were several intellectual clashes in which the liberal and conservative positions of each other clashed.

<text>Metropolitan University of Technology () is a university in Chile. It is part of the Chilean Traditional Universities.The Metropolitan Technological University, better known by its acronym as UTEM, is a state institution of public higher education in Chile, founded on August 30, 1993, after the breakup of the University of Chile.

It is one of the sixteen universities of the Consortium of Universities of the State of Chile, and belongs to the Council of Rectors of Chilean Universities.

It has four branches, all located in the Metropolitan Region. Its head office is in the municipality of Santiago, being part of the old houses of Dieciocho street, which was declared a heritage Zone by the National Monuments Council of Chile.

The UTEM is currently accredited by the National Accreditation Commission (CNA-Chile) for three years, since its renovation in December 2013 to December 2016.

==History==
The Metropolitan Technological University (UTEM) was founded from Santiago Professional Institute (IPS), which was formed in 1981 after the military regime dismembered the University of Chile, disappeared from IPUCH (Polytechnic Institute of the University of Chile) and other races that were left out of the University of Chile, such as: Construction, Architecture, Library, Cartography, Social Work and Design. The enactment of Law No. 19,239, was made in a ceremony led by the then rector of this study, and founder Luis Pinto prepulsor Faverio, Patricio Aylwin Azócar and Education Minister Jorge Arrate, at the Palace of La Moneda. On August 30, 1993, was published in the Official Journal of the Republic of Chile, the decree creating the Metropolitan Technological University (UTEM), which constitutes the last of the Universities Council of Rectors.

In the beginning, i.e. from 1993 to 2002, the UTEM starts delivering careers professional area of Engineering and the Social Area, becoming the state university which receives more young people in the first two income quintiles, from schools municipal and subsidized. In 2002, the UTEM begins to dictate the race of Criminology at the levels of technical (expert), graduates (scientists) Degree, which will have a major impact on subsequent attempts of institutional accreditation.

The UTEM is a Chilean state university which receives every year about 1,500 students, has four offices in Santiago, with an area of 58,000 m2.
Doctor Honoris Causa

The March 20, 1996, the UTEM delivered its first title Doctor Honoris Causa former President Patricio Aylwin Azócar, in recognition of his outstanding professional and academic career, and her starring role in the history of our country.

In May of that same year, the UTEM awarded its second title Doctor Honoris Causa Edgardo Henriquez Frodden doctor for his professional and academic career.

The third Honoris Causa was awarded to former President Ricardo Lagos Escobar on April 30, 1998, and seven years later, as high honor was awarded to Dr. Gui Bonsiepe, recognized theoretical, industrial designer, international consultant and author required reading numerous texts in the discipline of design.
In December 2010, the institution was accredited by CNA-Chile, but due to administrative problems and academic 9 only achieved by a year. However, appeared in the newspaper La Nacion audited annual balance sheet, showing positive number, thus giving clear progress of their term of crisis.

The November 15, 2011, a study by the Council of State of Chile Transparency ranked the UTEM as the state university that best met the Government Transparency Act, a 59.53%. On 29 December that year, the university got reaccreditation, this time for the period 2011 to 2013. Reacreditarse again in December 2013 to December 2015. After an administrative appeal to CNA Chile, accreditation was extended for 3 years (until 29 December 2016).
The Metropolitan Technological University has 5 faculties distributed in Santiago, reaching an approximate 58,000 m2 of buildings and landscaping area, has 53 Undergraduate Degree, 34 and 19 PSU login evening special income.

His most extensive, and more number of students based, is the Faculty of Engineering which has an enrollment of nearly 4,000 students, ranking in the commune of Providencia, at the intersection of Avenida Greece Avenida José Pedro Alessandri (Though ago few years communal boundaries between Providencia and Macul changed leaving the seat in the municipality of Providencia, it still retains the name of Macul headquarters). In it there recently constructed buildings that blend with the old buildings of the Hebrew Institute, which operated until about 1980.

Likewise, the college acquired property and building in the town of Providence, for the operation of the Faculty of Management and Economics by the Dean, with capacity for over 2,000 students.

Within Headquarters, is the Chapel of Gothic Revival style, located in the second courtyard of a historical Casona Colonial, which is open to the public on Heritage Day in Chile.

== Exploration ==
Visits to the cave occurred as early as the 1880s.

The cave was explored by an expedition led by Captain Thompson in 1935. The explorers described a cave that was in length, wide and deep. After progressing a further the group found the passage forked into two passages one of which continued a further leading to a huge cavern.

Photographs of the cave were published after the 1935 expedition.

It was a well documented cave by the 1960s.

<text>Thomas Built Buses, Inc. (commonly known as Thomas) is an American bus manufacturer. Best known for its production of the first ever rear engine Type C school bus, Thomas produces other bus designs for a variety of usages. Currently, its production is concentrated on school buses and activity buses, along with their commercial derivatives.

Founded in 1916 as Perley A. Thomas Car Works, the company was renamed in 1972 to better represent its primary product lines. Headquartered since 1916 in High Point, North Carolina, Thomas has been a subsidiary of Daimler Trucks North America (the parent company of Freightliner) since 1998. Prior to its acquisition, the company was operated by the Perley A. Thomas family, the final major school bus manufacturer operated under family control.

Since 1936, Thomas has produced school buses in High Point, North Carolina. In addition to bus bodies, the company also produces vehicle chassis for its Saf-T-Liner/Transit Liner EFX and HDX2 Hbuses.

==History==

=== Foundation ===
The oldest surviving bus manufacturer in North America, Thomas Built Buses traces its roots to 1916. Following the closure of streetcar manufacturer Southern Car Company, Perley A. Thomas (trained as a woodworker and engineer) founded a company specializing in fireplace mantels and home furnishings. In the summer of 1916, Thomas shifted from furniture to streetcar construction, as he secured a contract to enclose existing streetcars in Charlotte, North Carolina, renovating them in a car barn.

In the summer of 1916, Thomas Car Works was founded; with a $6,000 loan ($ in 2018), Thomas acquired the equipment of Southern Car Works at auction, opening an assembly facility in a former ice manufacturing plant in High Point. During 1917, the company renovated 9 streetcars for the United States Navy in Mobile, Alabama, and for the city of Montgomery, Alabama.

1918 marked several milestones for the company, as Thomas Car Works began production of brand-new streetcars; 25 were produced. All-steel bodies were produced by the company for the first time, quickly overtaking wooden designs. At the end of 1918, the company began construction on larger factory, a 30-acre facility outside of High Point allowing for both construction and repair of streetcars.

=== 1920s ===
While best known from their use in New Orleans, Perley Thomas streetcars produced during the 1920s would also be utilized by communities across the United States, including Charlotte, NC; Chicago, IL; Detroit, MI; Miami, FL; Mobile, AL; New York City; Philadelphia, PA; Washington, DC, and exported as well, with Havana, Cuba as a user.

In total, Thomas Car Works produced approximately 400 streetcars from 1918 to 1930; at its peak, the company was the fourth-largest manufacturer of streetcars in the United States.

==== New Orleans streetcars ====
In 1921, Thomas Car Works secured its largest order for streetcars. In New Orleans, NOPSI (New Orleans Public Service, Inc.) decided to standardize their streetcar fleet upon 150 Thomas-designed streetcars, delivered from 1921 to 1924. Unable to fill the massive order on their own, Thomas subcontracted a portion to Philadelphia-based competitor J. G. Brill (using the Thomas design).

In September 1922, after Thomas delivered 25 streetcars to NOPSI, the High Point factory was destroyed by fire, causing $225,000 in damage and destroying 14 streetcars under construction. Following the fire, Perley Thomas secured a $100,000 advance from NOPSI, rebuilding the factory and securing parts to build 55 more streetcars; 25 more were completed by the end of 1923 (bringing the total produced to 105).

As of 2020, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority operates 35 Perley Thomas 900-series streetcars in active daily use (on the St. Charles line, the oldest streetcar line in the world); the streetcars date from 1923 and 1924.

===1930s===
In 1930, Thomas Car Works was reincorporated as a stock company, with Perley Thomas making his family stockholders in Perley A. Thomas Car Works, Inc. For the last time, the company received an order for streetcars, producing 4 for Mobile, Alabama. While rail-based streetcars offered higher capacity, for public transit, automotive-based buses grew in popularity as they offered a greater degree of routing flexibility. In a transition away from streetcars, Thomas produced its first trolley bus in 1933; while still drawing power from overhead wires, a trolley bus was constructed from a bus chassis. For 1934, the company produced 10 transit buses for South Carolina-based Duke Power.

Following the collapse of its primary source of revenue, Thomas Car Works diversified its work, expanding into automotive refinishing and construction of bus and truck bodies. From 1929 to 1934, the company workforce decreased from 125 to nearly 10 (which included Perley Thomas and his 3 children). Eventually, a company creditor filed for receivership, with the lack of potential buyers allowing for the survival of the company.

==== Transition to bus construction ====
In 1936, Thomas Car Works secured part of a bid to produce 500 school bus bodies for North Carolina. As the company was only financially able to acquire materials for 200 bodies, North Carolina split the bid between Thomas and Hackney Brothers. Dependent on length, Thomas offered wood-bodied school buses for $195 to $225. Following the completion of its second school bus bid in 1937, the company focused nearly all production on school bus bodies. In what is a long tradition that continues to the present day, Thomas remains the primary supplier of school buses to North Carolina.

In 1938, several major innovations were introduced by the company to its school bus design, including its first steel-bodied school bus. While Perley Thomas streetcars had adopted steel construction in 1918, school bus design had slowly evolved from farm wagons, with wooden body construction continuing into the 1930s. Although not the first to construct an all-steel body, Thomas introduced one-piece roof bows, internal roll bars welded to each side of the floor/frame structure. While the design has been updated for added strength, the one-piece roof bow is in use in all school buses manufactured in North America today. In another innovation, Thomas introduced an outward-opening entry door, designed to aid egress in emergency evacuation situations.

=== 1940s ===
In 1940, day-to-day operation of Thomas Car Works was turned over from Perley Thomas (who remained company president) to his three children. John W. Thomas managed company operations along with sales, along with James Thomas handling the High Point factory. Following the outbreak of World War II, as with its competitors, Thomas bus production was shifted towards the armed forces. In a contract shared with Ward Body Works, Thomas also produced various bodies for the GMC CCKW truck.

While the war had brought school bus production to a halt, the High Point factory remained utilized in civilian capacity. To supplement its armed forces production, Thomas Car Works was put to use by refurbishing streetcars. As rationing had placed increased demands on public transportation, the upkeep of existing equipment was considered a priority.

Following World War II, with a rise in student populations, Thomas Car Works began to expand its sales market beyond the South, opening dealerships across the eastern half of the United States. To better weatherproof its entry door, the company developed a reinforced rubber-covered door hinge; the rubber also covered the gap between the two door panels as they closed.

After World War II, a third generation of the family joined the company, with John W. Thomas Jr. and Perley (Pat) Thomas II, with the former becoming director of sales and the latter taking over control of government contracts.

=== 1950s ===
During the decade, Thomas Car Works began exports of its product lines, establishing satellite facilities in Ecuador and Peru. From North Carolina, bodies were shipped to South America in CKD form for final assembly on locally sourced chassis.

In 1957, the &quot;Thomas Saf-T-Liner&quot; name made its first appearance, denoting updated bus bodies (with an enlarged two-piece windshield). Used full-time by 1972, the name remains in use for all full-size Thomas buses over 60 years later.

Company founder Perley Thomas died in 1958 at the age of 84; at the time of his death, Thomas retained his title of company president and also actively served as a design consultant.

=== 1960s ===
In 1962, Thomas Car Works officially expanded its production beyond High Point as Thomas Built Buses of Canada, Ltd. was established in Woodstock, Ontario. At the time, the company became the third-largest producer of school buses in the United States.

To demonstrate the strength of its internal roof bows, Thomas stacked a full-size school bus on the roof of another (using a crane) in 1964; the company has subsequently repeated the demonstration several times using more recent product lines.

For 1967, to reduce blind spots in front of the bus, Thomas developed a convex blind-spot mirror. Initially mandated in North Carolina, the device (allowing a 150-degree field of vision directly in front of the bus) would be adopted by 16 other states in only two years. In various forms, blind-spot mirrors are currently required on all school buses in North America.

=== 1970s ===

In the early 1970s, Thomas underwent a number of major transitions in company leadership and market positioning. Company president John W. Thomas died in 1972, giving leadership to his brother James Thomas, who retired within a year. A third generation of the Thomas family assumed control of the company leadership, with John Thomas Jr. (President) and Perley Thomas II (VP, international operations).

As Thomas Car Works had ended its involvement with streetcars since World War II, the new generation of company leaders chose a new name for the company tied closer to its current product lines; in 1972, &quot;Perley A. Thomas Car Works&quot; was renamed &quot;Thomas Built Buses, Inc&quot; (used in its emblems and marketing material since the 1950s).

==== Expanded school buses ====
Since producing its first school bus in 1936, virtually all Thomas school bus bodies had been produced in the &quot;conventional&quot; style: a body mated to a cowled truck chassis. While the design was the most popular configuration, the transit-style configuration allowed for a higher passenger capacity (up to 90 passengers). In the early 1970s, Thomas developed the Saf-T-Liner ER (Engine Rear) as an alternative to the Blue Bird All American. In line with other body manufacturers (Carpenter, Superior, Ward, and Wayne), Thomas was dependent on a second-party manufacturer for rear-engine chassis (using Ford, Dodge, GMC, International Harvester and Volvo).

In the early 1970s Thomas Built Buses introduced the first of its &quot;Mighty Mite&quot; series of buses and were the smallest conventional bus ever produced by Thomas. Most were built on Dodge D300 chassis but when production of this series ended at the main plant in High Point, NC, production was moved to Hamilton, Ontario and the Canadian built Mighty Mites used modified International Harvester Loadstar chassis. 


For 1972, the Saf-T-Liner body underwent a major redesign. Along with extending the rub rails completely around the body, the front and rear roof caps were flattened (to accommodate 8-lamp warning systems), and the windshield was enlarged. Following the addition of safety upgrades to comply with safety mandates in 1977, the Saf-T-Liner body saw use in the Conventional through the end of 2006; in modified form, it remains in use with the EFX and HDX (and resized to fit the Minotour). At the smaller end of the size scale, the Saf-T-Liner body was resized to produce the Mighty Mite, a narrow-body school bus on a shorter-wheelbase conventional chassis.

In 1978, Thomas made a major change to the production of the Saf-T-Liner ER. Coinciding with a design update, Thomas introduced a company-sourced chassis, along with the front-engine Saf-T-Liner EF. With the introduction of the EF, Thomas became the first school bus manufacturer to produce its own chassis for both front and rear-engine school buses, ahead of Blue Bird by a decade (California manufacturers Crown Coach and Gillig Corporation had not produced a front-engine school bus since before World War II). As a competitor to the Blue Bird Mini Bird and Carpenter Cadet, Thomas reintroduced the Mighty Mite as a Type B bus, a school bus body paired with a stripped chassis.

=== 1980s ===

The late 1970s and early 1980s was a period of struggle for all school bus manufacturers. Coupled with the slow economy, manufacturers could no longer count on the factor that had driven school bus sales for the past two decades: the entirety of the baby-boom generation had finished school; it would be years before student populations would create sufficient demand again. During this time, a number of manufacturers either encountered financial difficulty or closed their doors altogether.

At the beginning of the decade, Thomas introduced a new logo, displayed on the roofline of its buses; a &quot;T-bus&quot; logo replaced the previous scripted &quot;Thomas Built Buses&quot; company logo (still attached elsewhere to the body).

To better secure the future of the company, the Thomas family sought to raise capital for Thomas Built Buses, leading the company board to bring in the Odyssey Group investment firm to oversee the process. In return, Odyssey Group received a stake in the company (remaining under full family control).

In the early 1980s, Thomas launched a diversification of its product line, expanding its presence in the transit bus segment. Derived from the Saf-T-Liner, the Transit Liner was developed for commercial use. In 1982, the CL960 &quot;Citiliner&quot; was introduced as a dedicated transit bus; while sharing its underpinnings with the Saf-T-Liner ER, the two-door CitiLiner was rebodied (with a sloped windshield). Sharing its body with the CL960, the Chartour was developed for charter use, using a single entry door.

==== Product innovations ====

Following the mid-1970s launches of the Wayne Busette and Blue Bird Micro Bird, Thomas would launch its own cutaway-chassis school bus, the Thomas Minotour, in 1980. Alongside the small Minotour, Thomas introduced the WestCoastER, a heavy-duty variant of the Saf-T-Liner ER marketed against Crown Supercoach and Gillig Phantom school buses. Sold only in 84 and 90-passenger configurations, the WestCoastER used heavier-duty driveline and suspension components; tandem rear axles were offered as an option.

In the late 1980s, the Saf-T-Liner product line (with the exception of the WestCoastER) adopted the MVP suffix, standing for &quot;M&quot;aneuverability, &quot;V&quot;isibility, and &quot;P&quot;rotection.

In 1989, Thomas introduced a second conventional-style bus to its model line, launching the Thomas Vista school bus. To optimize forward sightlines for drivers, the layout of the driver&#x27;s compartment and forward chassis were redesigned. Along with a shorter hood and redesigned windshield, the engine and front axle were repositioned. In contrast to a standard conventional bus, the driver of the Vista sat beside the engine (rather than behind it). 
=== 1990s ===

In 1991, the Saf-T-Liner transit-style buses saw their first redesign since 1978. The ER and WestCoastER were given a much larger windshield, redesigned driver&#x27;s compartment, and saw the introduction of several new diesel engines. To better compete with the Blue Bird TC/2000 and Ward Senator (which became the AmTran Genesis), Thomas replaced the Saf-T-Liner EF with the All Star, using an Oshkosh-produced chassis. The Thomas Vista continued production, shifting chassis in 1991 from General Motors to a variant of Navistar chassis shared with the Saf-T-Liner Conventional.

In 1992, the fourth generation of the Thomas family took over daily operations of the company (becoming the first family-owned school bus company to do so).

During the mid-1990s, the company began development of environmentally cleaner buses, with compressed natural gas (CNG) school buses entering production in 1993; several battery-electric school buses were produced in 1994 as prototype vehicles.

By 1996, Thomas had become the largest school bus manufacturer in the United States (by market share). To keep up with added demand, the company opened a third factory in Monterrey, Mexico. As a design change, the &quot;T-bus&quot; roof emblem (used since the early 1980s) was replaced by a scripted Thomas Built Buses emblem (its predecessor).

During the later 1990s, Thomas Built Buses would undergo a number of significant changes, with some that have changed the future of school bus manufacturing. For the 1997 model year, Freightliner introduced the Freightliner FS-65 school bus chassis. Derived from the Freightliner FL60/FL70 medium-duty trucks introduced in 1995, the FS-65 chassis was paired with the Saf-T-Liner Conventional body, after several modifications (distinguished by the addition of a 4-piece windshield).

==== Transit expansion ====
During the 1990s, Thomas modernized and expanded its product range within the transit segment. Alongside the Chartour and CL960/Citiliner, Thomas marketed Transit Liners, commercial derivatives of the Saf-T-Liner school buses, along with commercial versions of the Minotour and Vista. A dedicated transit bus derived from the Saf-T-Liner ER, the TL960 was a two-door bus that offered an integrated wheelchair ramp as an option.

In 1999, Thomas entered a joint venture with British bus manufacturer Dennis to import the Dennis Dart SLF (in CKD form). Following assembly by Thomas in North Carolina; while badged as Thomas vehicles (the Thomas Dennis SLF200), distribution of the low-floor buses was undertaken by Orion Bus (itself becoming a Daimler subsidiary in 2000).

==== Company acquisition ====

Into the late 1990s, Thomas Built Buses remained a family-owned company, controlled by the fourth generation of the Thomas family and the Odyssey Group. Following the departure of Wayne Wheeled Vehicles from the manufacturing segment, Thomas became the largest manufacturer, holding a 34% market share in 1996. The same year, the Thomas family sold a majority stake of the company to the Berkshire Partners equity firm.

Freightliner entered school bus manufacturing as a chassis producer in May 1996, unveiling the Freightliner FS-65 (derived from its FL60/FL70 Business Class medium-duty truck); developed in cooperation with Thomas, the first production Freightliner-chassis buses were produced at the beginning of 1997. The product launch marked the first completely new school bus chassis since 1980, with Freightliner becoming the first new cowled-chassis manufacturer since the 1977 withdrawal of Dodge.

Following its collaboration with Thomas in developing the FS-65 chassis, in October 1998, Freightliner acquired Thomas Built Buses in its entirety from the Thomas family and the Berkshire, retaining company president John W. Thomas III. The largest school bus manufacturer in North America at the time, Thomas Built Buses was the last major manufacturer operating under family control. At the time, Freightliner was undergoing a series of company acquisitions to diversify its product range beyond highway trucks. Along with acquiring the rights to the Ford heavy-truck line (and Ford Cargo) in 1997 (continued as Sterling Trucks), Freightliner acquired Thomas alongside the chassis production of Oshkosh Corporation (1995), American LaFrance (1996).

For school bus manufacturers, the 1990s marked a period of association between major body and chassis manufacturers. In 1991, Navistar began its purchase of AmTran (completed in 1995); a year later, Blue Bird entered in a supply agreement with General Motors for conventional bus chassis. 1998 marked both the purchase of Thomas by Freightliner and the sale of Carpenter to Spartan Motors (its front/rear-engine chassis supplier).

At the end of the 1990s, several changes made to the Thomas product line were related to its purchase by Freightliner. At the end of 1998 production, Navistar ended its chassis production for the Vista; as the Vista body was developed solely for its chassis, Thomas discontinued the model line. While Freightliner did not purchase the Ford medium-duty truck range or the school bus chassis derived from it, Ford ended production of the latter after 1998. Consequently, from 1999 onward, the Saf-T-Liner Conventional was limited to Navistar or Freightliner chassis (along with AmTran/Ward, Carpenter, and Wayne, the last General Motors chassis for a Thomas bus was produced in 1991).

=== 2000s ===
In the school bus manufacturing segment, the beginning of the 2000s marked a period of uncertainty. In 2001, following the closure of Carpenter, the number of body manufacturers had declined from seven to three in ten years; AmTran would rebrand itself (twice, in less than two years). The acquisition of Thomas by Freightliner brought financial stability to the company (something not initially afforded to the Blue Bird Corporation).

In the early 2000s, Thomas restructured its manufacturing footprint, centering it around its High Point headquarters. Following the closure of the Monterrey facility in the late 1990s, the company opened a separate facility in High Point for Minotour assembly in 1999; in 2000, a facility was opened to produce Thomas Dennis low-floor buses in Jamestown, North Carolina. Thomas Built Buses of Canada in Woodstock, Ontario, was closed in 2001 (as part of a Freightliner restructuring), with Thomas opening a third school bus assembly facility High Point in 2004.

In 2002, John W. Thomas III retired, becoming the final family member to manage the firm; serving as president since 1992, Thomas remained with the company as a consultant. He was succeeded by John O&#x27;Leary, a financially educated manager in charge of the turnaround of parent company Freightliner.

During the 2000s, Thomas began to wind down its presence in the transit bus segment. While the Thomas Dennis SLF200 found buyers, the product line struggled to gain a foothold against established transit buses; after 2002, the Thomas Dennis joint venture was reorganized by Daimler (effectively replacing Thomas with distributor Orion) and the SLF200 was discontinued when Dennis&#x27; successor Transbus International withdrew from the venture. The Thomas-designed TL960 (which replaced the aging Chartour/CL960) was discontinued in 2002, replacing dedicated transit buses with school bus derivatives as Thomas consolidated commercial production to the Transit Liner EF/ER.

In 2005, company founder Perley Thomas became one of the first inductees (posthumously) of the North Carolina Transportation Hall of Fame in Raleigh, North Carolina. In 2007, the North Carolina Transportation Museum received the donation of a 1940 Thomas Car Works school bus from Thomas Built Buses.

Following the 2004 introduction of the Saf-T-Liner C2, Thomas produced the model line along its Saf-T-Liner Conventional predecessor. After nearly 35 years of production of the Saf-T-Liner Conventional body; the 62,764th and final example on the FS-65 chassis was produced on December 13, 2006.

==== New-generation buses ====
At the beginning of the 2000s, Thomas began to introduce its most extensive updates to its product lines since the 1970s. For 2001, the Saf-T-Liner HD was introduced (combining the Saf-T-Liner ER, WestCoastER, and the MVP ER). Distinguished by its large mirror housings (integrating sideview, convex, and crossview mirrors into a single assembly), the HD also visibly shared several components from Freightliner, including its instrument cluster and headlamps. For 2003, Freightliner became the sole chassis supplier for the Saf-T-Liner Conventional, with all Conventionals becoming Saf-T-Liner FS-65s. In 2004, Thomas renamed the HD the Saf-T-Liner HDX.

Following the 2001 replacement of the FL-series Business Class with the Business Class M2, development was underway on a new-generation Thomas Saf-T-Liner conventional school bus. In 2004, the Thomas Saf-T-Liner C2 made its debut, marking the first completely new bus body from Thomas since 1972. In a shift from industry precedent, both the Thomas body and Freightliner chassis were designed together as a common unit (allowing the use of the dashboard in nearly its entirety); as a drawback, the pairing negated the use of the Freightliner C2 chassis by other body builders. In contrast to the Saf-T-Liner Conventional, the C2 is designed with a larger, sloped windshield, larger windows and exits, and different body construction.

For 2009, Thomas launched a second model line of small buses. Named the Thomas MyBus, the model line is geared towards the MFSAB (activity bus) segment. Sharing its internal structure with the Minotour, the non-yellow MyBus is designed for applications without any need for traffic control. 
=== 2010s ===

In 2010, John O&#x27;Leary was succeeded as company president by Kelley Platt; the first female leader of a major school bus manufacturer, Platt served as manager of treasury services during the Freightliner acquisition of Thomas Built Buses.

In 2011, Thomas marked the introduction of the 2012 Saf-T-Liner EFX, its first all-new front-engine bus since 1994. Using similar design features as the Saf-T-Liner HDX (its windshield and upper bodywork), the EFX also utilized a center-mounted Freightliner instrument panel.

During the early 2010s, Thomas expanded its environmentally friendly product line. The Saf-T-Liner C2e hybrid diesel-electric school bus (introduced in 2007) met with little success, leading to its withdrawal in 2013; instead, the company invested in its alternative-fuel product lines. Having offered compressed natural gas (CNG) since 1993 in the Saf-T-Liner ER, the Saf-T-Liner C2 gained propane and CNG offerings (in 2014 and 2016, respectively). Alternative fuels became available on the Minotour (coinciding with chassis specification).

In 2016, Thomas Built Buses marked 100 years since the founding of Perley Thomas Car Works, becoming the first current bus body manufacturer to reach 100 years of production in North America.

In 2018, Thomas Built Buses would introduce Detroit Diesel engines into their school buses, marking the first time that Detroit Diesel engines have been used in school buses since the late 80s.

In late 2019, Thomas entered into a joint venture with Trans Tech to jointly develop a small school bus. Named the Minotrek, The Ford Transit cutaway-chassis school bus is designed with an aerodynamically enhanced body to optimize fuel economy.

==== Environmental stewardship ====

In 2011, the High Point facilities of Thomas Built Buses achieved Zero-Waste-to-Landfill status in its vehicle production. A year later, the company was designated a North Carolina Environmental Steward, citing its superior environmental performance, commitment to continued reduction of its environmental impact, and demonstrated commitment to exceed compliance regulations.

In late 2017, in line with each major school bus manufacturer, Thomas unveiled a fully electric school bus prototype. The Saf-T-Liner C2 Jouley (deriving its name from the unit of energy) is scheduled to enter full production during 2020.
===2020-present===

==Products==
Thomas Built Buses is a manufacturer of school bus bodies in cutaway van (Minotour), conventional (early Mighty-Mite series) (Saf-T-Liner C2), and transit-style (Saf-T-Liner EFX/HDX) configurations.

<text>The Christina Noble Children&#x27;s Foundation, also known as simply the CNCF, is an international non-government organization, dedicated to serving the world&#x27;s oppressed and marginalized children. It was founded following a visit to Vietnam by Christina Noble, who was prompted by a dream she had had during the time of the Vietnam War, of Vietnamese children begging for her help. After visiting the country in 1989, Noble founded the foundation in 1991 in Ho Chi Minh City. In 1997, the foundation extended its services to Mongolia.

==Programmes==
The Christina Noble Children&#x27;s Foundation has established a number of health centres and has been involved in a number of community development projects such as rural water programs. It has also established kindergartens and schools for underprivileged children in Vietnam, such as the Sunshine School.

The Sunshine School provides primary education to street children and children from underprivileged families. Children also receive medical care and participate in extracurricular activities.

The Tay Ninh Centre is a residential and education centre, located in the Tay Ninh province, in which visually impaired students are given an education and taught life skills.

==Fundraising==
According to the charity&#x27;s 2018 annual report, of its approximately US$3 million in income for that year, 76% came from donations (including institutional, corporate and individual donors), with 18% coming from fundraising activities, and the remainder from other sources and tax relief.

CNCF is one of the chosen charities of the Mongol Rally. All 300 cars that enter the rally must raise a minimum of £1000. £500 of this must go towards CNCF.

<text>Ad extirpanda (&quot;To eradicate&quot;; named for its Latin incipit) was a papal bull promulgated on Wednesday, May 15, 1252 by Pope Innocent IV which authorized under defined circumstances the use of torture by the Inquisition as a tool for interrogation.

==Context==

The bull was issued in the wake of the murder of the papal inquisitor of Lombardy, St. Peter of Verona, who was killed by a conspiracy of Cathar sympathizers on 6 April 1252. It was addressed to the heads of state or rulers, ministers and citizens established in the states and districts of Lombardy, Riviera Romagnola, and Marchia Tarvisina in the Venetia. Judicial torture had become a common practice in the 11th and 12th centuries, following the rediscovery of Roman law. By 1252, it was regarded as an established method by secular tribunals.

==Content==

The bull argued that as heretics are &quot;murderers of souls as well as robbers of God’s sacraments and of the Christian faith&quot;, they are &quot;to be coerced—as are thieves and bandits—into confessing their errors and accusing others, although one must stop short of danger to life or limb.&quot; The following parameters were placed on the use of torture by the state:
*that it did not cause loss of life or limb (&quot;citra membri diminutionem et mortis periculum&quot;)
*that the Inquisitor deemed the evidence against the accused to be virtually certain.

The bull conceded to the State a third portion of the property to be confiscated from convicted heretics, another third to the officials who handled the cases, and another third &quot;deposited in some secure place to be kept by the aforesaid Diocesan bishop and inquisitors, and spent as they shall think fit to promote the faith and extirpate heretics&quot;. The State in return assumed the burden of carrying out the penalty. The secular authorities were obliged to do so, under pain of excommunication and interdiction. Some of the measures prescribed were hardly in accordance with any reasonable rule of the law. The houses of the heretics and some of their supporters were to be razed to the ground.

The relevant portion of the bull read: &quot;Those convicted of heresy by the aforesaid Diocesan Bishop, surrogate or inquisitors, shall be taken in shackles to the head of state or ruler or his special representative, instantly, or at least within five days, and the latter shall apply the regulations promulgated against such persons.&quot; The 1199 bull &quot;Vergentis in senium&quot; by Innocent III already declared heresy a crime of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;, so deserving the death penalty.

<text>Lar Lubovitch Dance Company (founded in 1968) is a dance company based in New York City and founded by Lar Lubovitch in the late 1960s. They have performed at Carnegie Hall, and worldwide.

In 2003–04, the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company celebrated its 35th anniversary with:
*The world premiere of Artemis (2003) in May 2003 at Lincoln Center. Based on Greek mythology, the dance was created in honor of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.
*The nationwide TV broadcast of Othello (1997) by PBS in June 2003.
*The world premiere of a new production of Othello in Norway in October 2003.
*The world premiere of Pentimento (2004) in May 2004 as the featured dance during the company&#x27;s self-produced 35th anniversary season in New York City
*A special anniversary tour including Great Britain and (in the US) the Jacob&#x27;s Pillow Dance Festival
*Numerous re-stagings around the world of earlier works by the company.

Other recent company work includes &quot;Elemental Brubeck&quot; (2005) (music by Dave Brubeck), &quot;Love Stories&quot; (2005) (to songs sung by Kurt Elling) and &quot;Do You Be&quot; (2005) (to music by Meredith Monk).

In 2002, the company created “…smile with my heart” (2002), a tribute to the legendary Broadway composer Richard Rodgers, and in 2001 the company presented three new dances at City Center:
#The Wedding (2001) – the premiere of a major new production resulting from a re-imagination of Stravinsky&#x27;s Les Noces, originally choreographed by Lubovitch 25 years ago
#My Funny Valentine (2001) – the world premiere of a tribute to the composer Richard Rodgers on the occasion of the centennial of his birth
#Men&#x27;s Stories (2000) – the restaging of the company&#x27;s big hit from the prior year.

The most impressive new work created by the company in the last few years was the acclaimed evening-length version of Othello (1997) – produced by the Lubovitch company in an unprecedented 3-way collaboration with American Ballet Theatre and San Francisco Ballet.

In New York, the company performs most frequently at City Center Theater (12 seasons), in addition to seasons at Avery Fisher Hall (twice), Carnegie Hall (twice), the Joyce Theater, the New York State Theater and other venues.

Based in New York, the company is internationally renowned, having toured extensively throughout America (virtually all 50 states) and the rest of the world (more than 30 countries). In 1995 the company decided to increase its focus on creating new dances (and other activities) in New York (declining all invitations to tour during the past nine years). During the 27 years of touring prior to 1995, the company had been seen in live performances by more than a million people. On television it has been seen by millions more. Nowadays the company limits its performances to New York City and television, except for the special 35th anniversary tour. In recognition of its work, the company has received many awards and grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York State Council on the Arts and numerous foundations.

The company has appeared in the US on nationwide television as part of the PBS “Great Performances” series. The most recent broadcast, featuring Fandango (1989), was honored with an International Emmy Award. In Great Britain the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company was featured on television as part of an hour-long program produced by the BBC, in which the company performed Concerto Six Twenty-Two (1986) and North Star (1978). On June 18, 2003 the company&#x27;s co-production of Othello (as danced by San Francisco Ballet) was broadcast nationwide on “Great Performances” and watched by 900,000 people.

<text>RBBS-PC (acronym for Remote Bulletin Board System for the Personal Computer) was a freeware, open-source BBS software program. It was written entirely in BASIC by a large team of people, starting with Russell Lane and then later enhanced by Tom Mack, Ken Goosens and others.

It supported messaging conferences, questionnaires, doors (through the dropfile), file sharing and much more. 

==History==
In 1982, Larry Jordan of the Capital PC Users Group started modifying some existing BBS software that had been ported from CP/M by Russell Lane. The first major release of this effort, RBBS-PC CPC09, in May 1983 was written in interpreted BASIC and included the Xmodem file transfer protocol added by Jordan. In June 1983, Jordan turned over maintenance and enhancements to Tom Mack and Ken Goosens. The first release under Mack, version 10.0, was released July 4, 1983. New versions and features were released steadily throughout the rest of the 1980s. The final complete version, 17.4, was released June 21, 1992.

Since version 17.4 at least four other code paths have developed. Some work has been done to unify the code paths and to develop version 18.0. Dan Drinnons CDOR Mods and Mapleleaf versions were further enhanced by beta testers Mike Moore and Bob Manapeli using Ken Goosens LineBled program to manipulate the source code to endless variations of the program.

==License==
RBBS-PC was not in public domain, but copyrighted and released under a limited license. The license allowed free distribution of both source code and binary in non-modified form. The documentation from an early 1984 CPC12.1 release lists the following conditions:
* RBBS-PC CPC12 is not distributed in modified form,
* No fee or other consideration is charged, and
* Reference to the authors is retained.

In the final 17.4 release from 1992 the license conditions were almost identical:
* You may NOT distribute RBBS-PC in modified form.
* You may NOT charge a fee for RBBS-PC itself, and
* You MUST retain all references to the copyright and authors.

While the modified form distribution was not allowed, the documentation encouraged to publish and share modifications (bug fixes, new features) as patch files against the original source code. RBBS-PC had its own .MRG file format and tool for patching.

==Philosophy==
From the beginning of RBBS-PC&#x27;s development, the authors of the software had two goals as stated in the RBBS-PC documentation:
* To show what could be done with the BASIC language and that &quot;real programmers can/do program in BASIC.&quot;
* To open a new medium of communication where anyone with a personal computer has the ability to communicate freely. This idea was summarized as &quot;Users helping users for free to help the free exchange of information.&quot;

<text>Non-monogamy (or nonmonogamy) is an umbrella term that describes a relationship arrangement where one or more partners are not sexually and/or romantically exclusive to each other. Monogamy and non-monogamy are not strictly binary categories, but rather exist on a continuum encompassing various degrees of exclusivity and openness - at one end of this continuum lie strictly monogamous relationships, while at the other end are openly non-exclusive arrangements with numerous nuanced forms of varying degrees of openness in between. Non-monogamous relationships have been practiced across cultures and throughout history, reflecting diverse social norms, legal frameworks, and personal preferences.

In contemporary discourse, non-monogamy is understood to encompass a variety of practices, ranging from culturally institutionalised arrangements like polygamy to consensual agreements such as open relationships and polyamory, as well as non-consensual forms like infidelity.

== Major forms of non-monogamy ==
In the Western world, from a legal perspective, marrying more than one person is not permitted, as the law recognises only monogamous marriage—a union between two individuals. However, in many other regions, particularly Muslim-majority countries, polygamy is legally recognized and culturally normalized. Another key characteristic that distinguishes different forms of nonmonogamous relationships is whether they are practiced with the knowledge and consent of all involved parties. These distinctions allow non-monogamy to be broadly categorised into three major forms:

* Culturally institutionalised non-monogamy refers to legally and culturally sanctioned practices of non-exclusive relationships that are formalised, regulated, and embedded within specific cultural traditions. The most prominent example is polygamy, which includes polygyny (when a man has more than one wife at the same time), and, less commonly, polyandry (when a woman has more than one husband), and polygynandry (a group marriage when more than one husband is married to more than one wife). Other culturally embedded practices, such as temporary marriages (e.g., &quot;Nikah Mut&#x27;ah&quot; in Shia Islam), may also fall under this category.  
* Consensual non-monogamy (CNM), also known as ethical non-monogamy (ENM), refers to a relationship that explicitly allows for extra-dyadic romantic or sexual relationships. Consensual non-monogamy can take many different forms, depending on the needs and preferences of the individuals involved in specific relationships. The most studied and prevalent forms of consensual non-monogamy are swinging, polyamory, and open relationships. In a swinging relationship a couple tend to engage in sexual activities with people other than their primary partner, typically at a party or in another social settings. Polyamorous relationships are those in which people experience both sexual and emotional relationships with multiple partners concurrently, placing emphasis on a romantic and emotional aspects of the relationship, rather than on strictly sexual. An open relationship is a relationship arrangement in which one or both partners seek sexual relationships independently of each other. Some authors suggest the concept of relationship anarchy, which describes intimate relationships characterised by principles aligned with anarchism, that include autonomy, the rejection of hierarchies, the absence of state intervention, rejection of societal norms, and a focus on community interdependence. Unlike culturally institutionalised non-monogamy, CNM typically exists outside legal frameworks, as it does not involve formal marriage to multiple partners, but relies on mutual consent.
* Secretive non-monogamy (or non-consensual non-monogamy), commonly known as infidelity or cheating, refers to a situation in which one or both partners in a committed relationship engage in secret extra-dyadic sexual or romantic relationships with one or more additional partners, without the knowledge or consent of the other partner/s.

It is important to note that the above-described categories are not mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive as individual experiences often diverge from standard definitions due to the intricate nuances inherent in the complexity of human sexual relationships. The fluid and complex nature of human sexual and romantic relationships allows for diverse expressions that may not fit neatly into a single category, with subtle nuances often blurring the boundaries between these forms.

== Prevalence ==
Non-monogamy is practiced globally, but its prevalence varies significantly depending on cultural, legal, and societal factors.

* Culturally Institutionalised Non-Monogamy. Polygyny (a form of polygamy in which a man marries multiple women) is permitted in many Muslim-majority countries and is most often found in sub-Saharan Africa, where 11% of the population lives in arrangements that include more than one spouse. However, reliable statistics on the prevalence of polygamous marriages in Gulf countries and Sub-Saharan Africa are limited. Existing evidence suggests that while Islamic law permits polygamy in some regions, its actual practice is relatively uncommon and varies widely by country. For instance, the 2017–2018 Jordan Population and Family Health Survey found that approximately 4% of married women reported their husband had other wives, being most common among women with no education (13%). In contrast, the 2017 Senegal DHS reported that 32% of married women were in polygynous unions, demonstrating that rates can differ significantly across regions. Contemporary studies have identified 53 societies (out of over a 1000) practicing polyandry (a form of polygamy in which a woman marries multiple men), though its prevalence within these societies is difficult to determine, with the highest recorded rate being approximately 12 percent. Polyandry is practiced in regions such as the Himalayan areas of India, Nepal, and Tibet, the Marquesas Islands in the South Pacific, and among indigenous groups like the Yanomamö in South America and the Inuit in the Arctic. 
* Consensual non-monogamy. Studies suggest that CNM arrangements, such as open relationships and polyamory, are becoming increasingly visible in Western societies. It is estimated that 3%-7% of Americans, 2.5% of Canadians, around 3% of Norwegians, and 3.3% of Dutch and Flemish are engaged in consensual non-monogamy at an any given time and around a quarter of the Americans, Canadians, Norwegians, and Dutch and Flemish at least once have engaged in a consensually non-monogamous relationship in their lifetime. In two surveys in 2013 and 2014, one fifth of surveyed single United States adults had, at some point in their lives, engaged in consensual non-monogamy. YouGov poll reported that in 2020 about one-third of US adults believe that &quot;their ideal relationship is non-monogamous to some degree&quot; and in 2024 9% of Brits have been or would like to be in a polyamorous relationship.
* Secretive non-monogamy. Measuring the prevalence of infidelity presents significant methodological challenges, as estimates vary depending on the research design, sample population, and the definition of adultery used by the researchers. Studies differ in whether they categorize infidelity as sexual, emotional, or both, and they rely on respondents’ subjective interpretations of what behaviors qualify as unfaithful – ranging from sexual intercourse to kissing, or even online interactions like cybersex. Additionally, infidelity is often underreported due to associated guilt and shame, leading to potential biases in self-reported data. Typically, studies report infidelity rates in the range from 25% to 75%. Infidelity is generally more common among cohabiting and dating couples than married couples and has been found to show seasonal variation, peaking during summer months due to travel and reduced chances of detection. While older studies report men engaging in infidelity more often than women, more recent studies report that men and women engage in infidelity at similar rates. However, men tend to report their extra-dyadic relationships as more sexual, while women report theirs as more emotional. 

== Legal frameworks of non-monogamy ==

=== Culturally institutionalised non-monogamy ===
Polygyny is legally recognised and regulated in many Muslim-majority countries, where Islamic law permits a man to marry up to four wives under specific conditions. In some countries like Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, Jordan, Yemen, Algeria, and Mauritania polygyny is legal and regulated by a Family Law. In other countries like Pakistan, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Morocco, Indonesia and Malaysia polygyny is allowed only under conditions like first wife’s disability or infertility, requires the written consent of the first wife and sometimes of a judge. However, over the past several decades, some of the Muslim-majority countries have experienced significant reforms in Muslim Family Law and several countries have taken steps to ban polygyny, reflecting changing societal attitudes and efforts to promote gender equality. For example, Tunisia banned polygyny as part of its family law reform under president Habib Bourguiba in 1956. As part of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s secular reforms, Turkey banned polygyny in 1926, replacing Islamic family law with a Swiss-inspired civil code. In Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan polygyny was prohibited under Soviet law and these bans were reaffirmed or codified into new national family laws in 1998 after these countries regained independence.

Polyandry is considered incompatible with Sharia law and is therefore not recognised in Muslim-majority countries. Polyandry persists informally in certain traditional societies, such as in the Himalayan regions of Tibet and Nepal, where fraternal polyandry helps preserve family property and manage limited agricultural land, and among communities like the Toda tribe in South India and parts of Himachal Pradesh, though it is not legally recognised.

In the United States, Canada, all European countries, and Russia, marriage is legally defined as a union between two individuals, and no form of polygamy is legally recognised. In the United States and Canada, polygamy is strictly prohibited, with violations resulting in criminal penalties such as fines or imprisonment. Across Europe, polygamous marriages are not recognised due to public policy conflicts, gender equality principles, and fundamental legal values. For example, in France and Germany, polygamy is not recognised under civil law, and attempts to enter into such unions can result in criminal charges, denial of marital benefits, or annulment of subsequent marriages. Polygamy is broadly unrecognised in European countries, posing challenges for asylum seekers with multiple spouses, as typically only one spouse is granted a residence permit and international protection. However, some countries may evaluate such cases individually, considering specific circumstances.

=== Consensual non-monogamy ===
Unlike polygamy, CNM does not involve multiple legally recognised marriages but instead consists of consensual agreements between adults to engage in multiple romantic or sexual relationships. This distinction allows CNM to operate within the bounds of the law in jurisdictions where monogamy is the legal marital standard. At the same time, the lack of legal recognition for CNM relationships means they are excluded from many legal protections, such as inheritance rights, hospital visitation, spousal visas, and parental responsibilities, as existing legal frameworks typically do not accommodate multiple concurrent partnerships. However, in recent years Canada and some of the U.S. states have taken steps toward recognising CNM relationships. In April 2018, the Newfoundland and Labrador Supreme Court in Canada recognized three adults in a polyamorous relationship as the legal parents of a child, marking a significant precedent in family law. Similarly, in June 2020, Somerville, Massachusetts, became the first U.S. city to adopt an ordinance permitting domestic partnerships involving more than two adults, thereby legally recognising CNM relationships.

Consensually non-monogamous relationships have no legal recognition in Muslim-majority countries, and extramarital relationships, even consensual, are typically criminalised.

=== Infidelity ===
Secretive non-monogamy (non-consensual non-monogamy), commonly referred to as infidelity or adultery, is addressed differently across global legal frameworks, with variations based on cultural, religious, and societal norms. In most Western nations like the United States, Canada, and much of Europe, while viewed as a moral transgression, infidelity is not punishable under criminal law. Conversely, in several Muslim-majority countries and others with laws influenced by religious doctrine, infidelity is criminalised under adultery laws. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Pakistan classify extramarital relationships as criminal acts, with punishments ranging from fines and imprisonment to flogging or, in extreme cases, capital punishment. Marital infidelity is explicitly recognised as grounds for divorce under the laws of Iraq, Algeria and the United Arab Emirates. In some jurisdictions, infidelity laws apply differently based on gender, with women often facing harsher consequences than men.

== Social attitudes toward non-monogamy ==
In Western cultures, monogamy is widely regarded as superior to relationships involving multiple partners. This preference for monogamous relationships is often referred to as mononormativity or monocentrism.

Consensually non-monogamous individuals face widespread stigma and are often misunderstood due to various stereotypes and myths. One of them is that those in CNM relationships are primarily motivated by a desire for more sex, leading to an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Studies have found that individuals practicing consensual non-monogamy are more likely to engage in safer sex practices and less likely to use condoms incorrectly compared to individuals who engage in extra-dyadic sex within ostensibly monogamous relationships or compared to monogamous population. This can be explained by the fact tha CNM individuals tend to prioritize open communication and explicit agreements about sexual boundaries, which often include discussions about safer sex practices. Several studies have explored societal attitudes toward different forms of CNM relationships, but the findings are often conflicting and inconclusive. While some research indicates more positive attitudes toward polyamorous relationships, emphasising emotional and romantic connections, other studies suggest that swinging or group sex, which focus primarily on sexual activity, are viewed more favourably.

Social attitudes toward secretive non-monogamy are overwhelmingly negative across most cultures. While being the most prevalent form of non-monogamy and as common as monogamy, secretive non-monogamy is widely condemned due to its association with betrayal, dishonesty, and the violation of trust within relationships. Factors such as societal gender norms, power dynamics, and the perceived acceptability of infidelity within certain contexts (e.g., among men versus women) influence attitudes toward non-consensual non-monogamy.

== Factors influencing successful non-monogamous relationships ==

Non-monogamy introduces unique challenges to involved partners, such as managing emotions like jealousy, maintaining trust and boundaries, and navigating social stigmas. Couples are more likely to adapt positively to non-monogamy if specific foundational conditions are met. This includes both partners wanting their relationship to remain primary, the couple having an established reservoir of good will, and a minimum of lingering resentments from past hurts and betrayals. A shared agreement on the decision to pursue non-monogamy, along with a sense of equality and autonomy between partners, is also crucial in building trust and navigating the complexities of a non-exclusive arrangement. Studies emphasise the importance of direct communication between partners. Key topics for discussion include the degree of openness versus secrecy in their arrangement, ensuring voluntary participation and avoiding coercion and inequality, and clarity versus vagueness.

== Other minor forms of non-monogamy ==
While it is tempting to categorise non-monogamy in broad categories, human relationships are complex and multifaceted with many terms emerging to reflect the nuanced nature of non-monogamous arrangements. Some people use the term &quot;monogamish&quot; to describe relationships that are primarily monogamous but allow for some degree of flexibility in terms of sexual or romantic experiences outside the primary partnership. Partners in such relationships may, for example, agree to occasional flings, participation in group activities, or other consensual experiences that do not threaten the emotional core of their partnership. Similarly, the term &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; is used to describe a relationship arrangement where partners tacitly agree to allow sexual or romantic activities outside the primary relationship, but without explicitly discussing or disclosing the details of those activities.

<text>Lar Lubovitch (born April 9, 1943) is an American choreographer. He founded his own dance company, the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company in 1968. Based in New York City, the company has performed in all 50 American states as well as in more than 30 countries. As of 2005, he had choreographed more than 100 dances for the company. In addition to the company, Lubovitch has also done creative work in ballet, ice-skating venues, and musical theater, notably &quot;Into the Woods&quot;. He has played a key role in raising funds to fight AIDS.

==Early life and education==
Born in Chicago, Lubovitch was educated at the University of Iowa and at New York City&#x27;s Juilliard School, where he graduated in 1964. His teachers at Juilliard included Antony Tudor, José Limón, Anna Sokolow and Martha Graham.

==Career==
Lubovitch danced in numerous modern, ballet, jazz and ethnic companies before forming the Lar Lubovitch Dance Company in 1968.

His works are included in the repertories of companies throughout the world, including the New York City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Paris Opera Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Baryshnikov&#x27;s White Oak Dance Project and Netherlands Dance Theater. His work is renowned for its musicality, rhapsodic style and sophisticated formal structures. His radiant, highly technical choreography and deeply humanistic voice have been acclaimed throughout the world.

In 1972, Lubovitch won a Guggenheim Fellowship in Choreography. Lubovitch made his Broadway debut in 1987 with the musical staging for the Stephen Sondheim/James Lapine musical, &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, for which he received a Tony Award nomination. In 1993 he choreographed the highly praised dance sequences for the Broadway show &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;. The final ballet from that show joined the repertories of American Ballet Theatre and the National Ballet of Canada. For his work on that show, he received the 1993-94 Astaire Award from the Theater Development Fund.

Starting in 1995, the company began focusing on creating dances in New York and teaching throughout the world. A prolific choreographer, Lubovitch created three new dances during the 2004–05 season. The first, &quot;Love Stories&quot;, was a collaboration between the Lubovitch company and Hubbard Street Dance Chicago (it premiered in Chicago in March 2005), the second, &quot;Do You Be&quot;, was created solely with the Lubovitch company in honor of Meredith Monk and premiered in NYC in November 2004). The third, &quot;Elemental Brubeck&quot;, is a collaboration between the Lubovitch company and the San Francisco Ballet (premiered in Paris in July 2005). Also in 2005 the Lubovitch company collaborated with the Limón Dance Company in the creation of another new dance, and staged its annual New York City season at the 850-seat Skirball Center on Washington Square in November.

In 1996 he created the musical staging (and two new dances) for the Tony Award-winning Broadway revival of &quot;The King and I&quot;. Most recently he devised the musical staging for Walt Disney&#x27;s stage version of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot; in Berlin. In 2004 he was honored with the Elan Award for his outstanding choreography. United States Artists named him a 2011 Fellow.

Recent projects (as of 2005) have included: the Lubovitch company&#x27;s world premiere of &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; as part of the company&#x27;s 2001 season in New York at City Center, and (the year before that) staging the world premiere of its acclaimed hit &quot;Men&#x27;s Stories&quot; as part of the company&#x27;s 2000 season in New York at the Orensanz Center for the Arts. Recent projects also include the creation of a full-evening-length (3-act) ballet composed by Elliot Goldenthal based on &quot;Othello&quot; in an unprecedented collaboration between the Lubovitch company and American Ballet Theatre and San Francisco Ballet. &quot;Othello&quot; was broadcast nationwide on PBS&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; and nominated for an Emmy Award for its music.

In addition to his work for stage, screen and television, Lubovitch has also made a notable contribution to the advancement of choreography in the field of ice dancing. He has created dances for Olympic gold medalists John Curry, Peggy Fleming and Dorothy Hamill and has choreographed a full-length ice-dancing version of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, starring Olympic medalists Robin Cousins and Rosalynn Sumners. The ballet was broadcast throughout Great Britain and America. He also choreographed a TV project with Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay, who won the silver medal for France at the 1992 Olympics. The show, based on &quot;The Planets&quot; by Gustav Holst, was broadcast by the A&amp;E television network in June 1995 and was nominated for an International Emmy Award, a Cable ACE Award and a Grammy Award. Most recently he created two new ice dances for Paul Wylie, a duet for Renée Roca and Gorsha Sur, and an ensemble piece for the Ice Theatre of New York.

<doc id="1271800" wikidata="Q2877408" url="?curid=1271800" title="BR-101 (Brazil highway)">
<text>The BR-101 (also called &quot;Translitorânea&quot; (transcoastal), officially named &quot;Rodovia Governador Mário Covas&quot;. and nicknamed &quot;Briói&quot; in some regions) is a longitudinal highway of Brazil. It is the longest in the country with a length of nearly , and it is considered one of the most important highways in the country, along with BR-116.

It crosses 12 Brazilian states: Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia, Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. It also connects more state capitals than any other &quot;rodovia&quot; (highway) in the country. In total, 12 capitals are directly connected by BR-101.

Its northern terminus is located in the city of Touros-RN and its southern terminus is located in São José do Norte-RS.

It follows virtually the entire east coast of Brazil from Rio Grande do Norte to Rio Grande do Sul. The highway has not been built between two stretches between Peruíbe (SP) and Iguape (SP), and between Cananéia (SP) and Garuva (SC).

Between Curitiba and Garuva (SC), the highway was replaced by the BR 101 / BR 376 and was widened by the Paraná government, not by the federal government.

The northern section between Curitiba and the border with São Paulo was not built to preserve an area of the Atlantic Forest.

The Rio-Niterói Bridge is part of the BR-101.

== Duplication ==
In the southern region of the country, the 312 km section between Curitiba and Florianópolis doubled completely around the year 2000. In 2005, the duplication of the 350 km section between Palhoça – SC and Osório – RS began. The 88.5 kilometers of the Rio Grande do Sul section were delivered only in February 2011; in the southern state of Santa Catarina, the delay was even longer: in 2018, 14.5 km (10 km in Laguna and 2 km in Tubarão) had yet to double. In 2019, the section was completed and opened to traffic.

In the Southeast Region of the country, in 2009, the duplication of 26 km between the Santa Cruz district, in the West Zone of the city of Rio de Janeiro, to the Itacuruçá district, in the municipality of Mangaratiba, was opened to the public, a section located in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Janeiro, near the capital of Rio de Janeiro. The urban section that comprises Avenida Brasil is 58 km long and is completely duplicated and is administered by the municipality of Rio de Janeiro and ends near the beginning of the Río – Niterói Bridge. The bridge is about 13 km long. Between the capital of Rio de Janeiro and the city of Campos, the stretch between Niterói and Rio Bonito has already doubled since the 1980s. The 176.6 km stretch between Rio Bonito and Campos dos Goytacazes was awarded to the company Arteris in 2008, for 30 years. The duplication work started in 2011, and in 2018 the company had already duplicated 126.3 km.

In the Northeast Region of the country, the BR-101 section in the northeast, between Natal and Salvador, has been duplicated since 2005. Not yet completed, it&#x27;s expected to be finished in 2021. About 70 km that cut the Recife Metropolitan Region already were duplicated before 2005. In the 688 km section connecting the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Pernambuco and Alagoas (section between Natal-RN, João Pessoa-PB, Recife-PE, Maceió-AL and the AL-SE border), the road is almost completely duplicated. In February 2019, there was a 59 km section in Alagoas, between São Miguel and Rio Largo, whose inauguration was scheduled for the second half of 2020. A 10 km section in the indigenous reserve in Joaquim Gomes-AL is pending release for construction. In Sergipe, the works are progressing at a slow pace, with no anticipation of completion. In the Sergipe state, the 67 km stretch between Aracaju and Estância has been completed and the link between Maruim and Propriá is almost interrupted, and the Brazilian army is only carrying out work. At the end of 2018, duplicate 18 km were delivered in this section. The section of Bahia, with no forecast of completion, will be 165.4 kilometers from Feira de Santana to the border with the state of Sergipe. Another part will double from Eunápolis to the border with Espírito Santo.

<doc id="1271803" wikidata="Q6268554" url="?curid=1271803" title="Johnsonville, New Zealand">
<text>Johnsonville is a large suburb in northern Wellington, New Zealand. It is seven kilometres north of the city centre, at the top of the Ngauranga Gorge, on the main route to Porirua (State Highway 1). It is commonly known by locals as &quot;J&#x27;ville&quot;. Johnsonville was settled from the 1840s, became a town by 1896 and grew rapidly during the twentieth century. Johnsonville became an independent borough in 1908 and amalgamated with Wellington City in 1953.

==History==

===Johnson&#x27;s clearing===

Johnsonville was originally the site of a Māori track from Wellington to Porirua (the Old Porirua Road), and had no indigenous inhabitants prior to European settlement. Vegetation was dense native forest, dominated by tōtara, mixed podocarp trees (notably tōtara and rimu), rātā and hīnau. Johnsonville was settled in 1841 by, among others, Frank Johnson who had purchased a certificate of selection and had drawn the 100 acre &#x27;Section 11 Kinapora (Kenepuru) District&#x27;. Initially called &#x27;Johnson&#x27;s clearing&#x27;, Frank Johnson built a house by the Johnsonville stream and a timber mill near the centre of modern Johnsonville. He quickly denuded the entire Johnsonville area of virgin native forest, with timber sold to help build the nearby town of Wellington. He soon sold his land at a substantial profit, and returned to England by 1858 leaving the environment massively changed, and on which site a farming industry to support nearby Wellington City grew. The Daisy Hill Farm House was built about 1860, and is still standing.

Over the 20th century, farmland slowly gave way to suburbia, with the first tiny township of Johnsonville steadily growing to become populated principally by a &quot;mid-level&quot; socio-economic strata. Johnsonville was a town by 1896.

===1886: the railway arrives===
The opening of the railway to Wellington by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company in 1886 (see Johnsonville Branch and Johnsonville Station) enabled people to commute to Wellington, and the line was electrified with more frequent and faster trains in 1938.

About 1894 stockyards were built in Broderick Road adjacent to the station sidings by Freeman R. Jackson. Stock (cattle and sheep) railed from the Manawatu and elsewhere were driven through the streets and down Fraser Avenue to the Ngauranga abattoir. The suburb got the name &quot;Cowtown&quot;, and residents complained about hygiene and noise. So a new siding and stockyard was opened near Raroa station in 1958.

=== Town Board ===
Johnsonville was proclaimed a local board in 1874. From 1881 it was a dependent town district, renamed in 1887 the Johnsonville Town District. In 1908 the Town Board became independent. In 1909 John Rod, Chairman of the Town Board, negotiated for electric power; supplied by the Hutt Valley Electric Power Board and installed in Johnsonville by Norman Heath &amp; Co. The board was active in the 1912-1922 period when gas lighting and drainage were installed and streets kerbed and channeled. In 1912 a water reservoir was built for water supplied from Ohariu Valley, and a new reservoir built in 1922. Drainage installed in 1912 was to a septic tank in Ngauranga Gorge. The septic tank lasted to 1953; when Johnsonville amalgamated with the Wellington City Council in April and the council completed a main sewer to the area. Surrounding areas also joined Wellington; like Raroa, which had been in the Hutt County Council.

The Town Board area was extended to the Hawtrey Estate north of Ironside Road from 1 April 1932, and the board installed some standpipes to fill water buckets.

The population grew from 143 in 1874 to 206 in 1878 and 438 (in 83 dwellings) in 1897. The population almost doubled between 1901 (502) and 1911, and was just over 3000 by 1951. In 1976 it was 9230; a 37% increase 1956-66 and 106% increase 1966–76.

=== Wellington suburb ===
The town grew rapidly from 1938 with state houses built on the former Native Reserve between Broderick Road and Fraser Avenue; the first was built in Bould Street. From 1938 to 1956, 329 state houses were built.

In the 1960s, the first shopping mall in the Wellington region was built in Johnsonville.

==Demographics==

== Infrastructure ==
Johnsonville has a modestly large commercial infrastructure and is self-sufficient in many ways; it has a shopping mall, two supermarkets, library and a community hub.

=== Public transport ===

Johnsonville is a reasonably large residential and commercial suburb. Johnsonville Station is the northern terminus of the Johnsonville branch line of the Tranz Metro electric passenger service to central Wellington, with an adjacent bus stop for several routes known as the &quot;Johnsonville Hub&quot;. Johnsonville supports a large commuter population. Housing is spread around the shopping hub in the centre and extends out to the base of Mt Kaukau to the west, and out across the hill towards the suburb of Newlands to the south-east.

===Keith Spry Pool===
Keith Spry pool is an indoor 25 metre heated pool with a diving pool, toddler pool, spa, and sauna: opened in June 1982. The pool is run by Wellington City Council. In June 2013, work started on a $6 million revamp of the facilities which expanded the complex by 50 percent, adding a new learn to swim pool, replacing the roof and expanding the changing rooms. In 2019, Keith Spry Pool and Johnsonville Library was brought under the wings of Waitohi Hub.

===Alex Moore Park===
Alex Moore park is a sporting ground located on Broderick Road / Moorefield Road. The grounds host football, rugby, cricket, softball and athletics. The facilities include an artificial cricket surface, changing rooms and club house. The Alex Moore Park Development Project is planning a $6 million sports centre on the site that will replace disparate and outdated sports clubrooms with a centralised gym, meeting rooms and function area.

===Johnsonville Community Centre===
The Johnsonville Community Centre is located on the corner of Frankmoore Avenue and Moorefield Road and provides community services including education, Citizens Advice Bureau, support groups and youth groups. The building is owned by the Wellington City Council and was opened in 1995 after significant investment and fund raising by local community groups.

=== Regional planning ===
As a part of the Northern Growth Management Plan from Wellington City Council, there exists a proposal to redevelop Johnsonville&#x27;s main precinct into the &quot;Johnsonville Town Centre&quot;. This plan recognises Johnsonville as Wellington&#x27;s most economically important commercial and population hub outside the city centre. The plan recommends the creation of a unique and identifiable &quot;Johnsonville culture&quot; around the triangular precinct - bounded by Johnsonville Road to the east, Broderick Road to the south and Moorefield Road to the west.

==Community and social groups==
Johnsonville has a number of community groups including:
* The Johnsonville Club
* Johnsonville Community Centre (next to Keith Spry pool)
* Johnsonville Lions &amp; Rotary
* Johnsonville Community Association (Inc.)

==Economy==

===Retail===

Johnsonville Shopping Centre consists of 500 carparks and 70 shops, including a Countdown supermarket. Johnsonville Shopping Centre is part of the Stride Property Limited portfolio and (as of December 2023) was owned 50/50 with Diversified NZ Property Trust, and managed by Stride Investment Management Limited.

<doc id="1271805" wikidata="Q426809" url="?curid=1271805" title="Organochlorine chemistry">
<text>Organochlorine chemistry is concerned with the properties of organochlorine compounds, or organochlorides, organic compounds that contain one or more carbon–chlorine bonds. The chloroalkane class (alkanes with one or more hydrogens substituted by chlorine) includes common examples. The wide structural variety and divergent chemical properties of organochlorides lead to a broad range of names, applications, and properties. Organochlorine compounds have wide use in many applications, though some are of profound environmental concern, with TCDD being one of the most notorious.

Organochlorides such as trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, dichloromethane and chloroform are commonly used as solvents and are referred to as &quot;chlorinated solvents&quot;.

==Physical and chemical properties==
Chlorination modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways. These compounds are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen. They have higher boiling and melting points compared to related hydrocarbons. Flammability reduces with increased chlorine substitution in hydrocarbons.

Aliphatic organochlorides are often alkylating agents as chlorine can act as a leaving group, which can result in cellular damage.

==Natural occurrence==
Many organochlorine compounds have been isolated from natural sources ranging from bacteria to humans. Chlorinated organic compounds are found in nearly every class of biomolecules and natural products including alkaloids, terpenes, amino acids, flavonoids, steroids, and fatty acids. Dioxins, which are of particular concern to human and environmental health, are produced in the high temperature environment of forest fires and have been found in the preserved ashes of lightning-ignited fires that predate synthetic dioxins. In addition, a variety of simple chlorinated hydrocarbons including dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride have been isolated from marine algae. A majority of the chloromethane in the environment is produced naturally by biological decomposition, forest fires, and volcanoes.

The natural organochloride epibatidine, an alkaloid isolated from tree frogs, has potent analgesic effects and has stimulated research into new pain medication. However, because of its unacceptable therapeutic index, it is no longer a subject of research for potential therapeutic uses. The frogs obtain epibatidine through their diet which is then sequestered into their skin. Likely dietary sources are beetles, ants, mites, and flies.

==Preparation==

===From chlorine===
Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be chlorinated under free radical conditions, with UV light. However, the extent of chlorination is difficult to control. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst.

The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chloroform was formerly produced thus.

Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds.

===Reaction with hydrogen chloride===
Alkenes react with hydrogen chloride (HCl) to give alkyl chlorides. For example, the industrial production of chloroethane proceeds by the reaction of ethylene with HCl:
:H2C=CH2 + HCl → CH3CH2Cl

In oxychlorination, hydrogen chloride instead of the more expensive chlorine is used for the same purpose:
:CH2=CH2 + 2 HCl + O2 → ClCH2CH2Cl + H2O.

Secondary and tertiary alcohols react with hydrogen chloride to give the corresponding chlorides. In the laboratory, the related reaction involving zinc chloride in concentrated hydrochloric acid:
: &lt;chem&gt;{R-OH} + HCl -&gt;[\ce{ZnCl2}] [\Delta] \overset{alkyl\ halide}{R-Cl} + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;
Called the Lucas reagent, this mixture was once used in qualitative organic analysis for classifying alcohols.

===Other chlorinating agents===
Alkyl chlorides are most easily prepared by treating alcohols with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) or phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5), but also commonly with sulfuryl chloride (SO2Cl2) and phosphorus trichloride (PCl3):
:ROH + SOCl2 → RCl + SO2 + HCl
:3 ROH + PCl3 → 3 RCl + H3PO3
:ROH + PCl5 → RCl + POCl3 + HCl

In the laboratory, thionyl chloride is especially convenient, because the byproducts are gaseous. Alternatively, the Appel reaction can be used:

==Reactions==
Alkyl chlorides are versatile building blocks in organic chemistry. While alkyl bromides and iodides are more reactive, alkyl chlorides tend to be less expensive and more readily available. Alkyl chlorides readily undergo attack by nucleophiles.

Heating alkyl halides with sodium hydroxide or water gives alcohols. Reaction with alkoxides or aryloxides give ethers in the Williamson ether synthesis; reaction with thiols give thioethers. Alkyl chlorides readily react with amines to give substituted amines. Alkyl chlorides are substituted by softer halides such as the iodide in the Finkelstein reaction. Reaction with other pseudohalides such as azide, cyanide, and thiocyanate are possible as well. In the presence of a strong base, alkyl chlorides undergo dehydrohalogenation to give alkenes or alkynes.

Alkyl chlorides react with magnesium to give Grignard reagents, transforming an electrophilic compound into a nucleophilic compound. The Wurtz reaction reductively couples two alkyl halides to couple with sodium.

Some organochlorides (such as ethyl chloride) may be used as alkylating agents. Tetraethyllead was produced from ethyl chloride and a sodium–lead alloy:
Reductive dechlorination is rarely useful in chemical synthesis, but is a key step in the biodegradation of several organochlorine persistent pollutants.

==Applications==

===Vinyl chloride===
The largest application of organochlorine chemistry is the production of vinyl chloride. The annual production in 1985 was around 13 million tons, almost all of which was converted into polyvinylchloride (PVC).

===Chlorinated solvents===
Most low molecular weight and liquid chlorinated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, 1,2-Dichloroethane and hexachlorobutadiene are useful solvents. These solvents tend to be relatively non-polar; they are therefore immiscible with water and effective in cleaning applications such as degreasing and dry cleaning for their ability to dissolve oils and grease. They are mostly nonflammable or have very low flammability.

Some, like carbon tetrachloride and 1,1,1-Trichloroethane have been phased out due to their toxicity or negative environmental impact (ozone depletion by 1,1,1-Trichloroethane).

===Chloromethanes===
Several billion kilograms of chlorinated methanes are produced annually, mainly by chlorination of methane:
:CH4 + x Cl2 → CH4−xClx + x HCl

The most important is dichloromethane, which is mainly used as a solvent. Chloromethane is a precursor to chlorosilanes and silicones. Historically significant (as an anaesthetic), but smaller in scale is chloroform, mainly a precursor to chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2) and tetrafluoroethene which is used in the manufacture of Teflon.

===Pesticides===

The two main groups of organochlorine insecticides are the DDT-type compounds and the chlorinated alicyclics.
Their mechanism of action differs slightly.
* The DDT like compounds work on the peripheral nervous system. At the axon&#x27;s sodium channel, they prevent gate closure after activation and membrane depolarization. Sodium ions leak through the nerve membrane and create a destabilizing negative &quot;afterpotential&quot; with hyperexcitability of the nerve. This leakage causes repeated discharges in the neuron either spontaneously or after a single stimulus.
* Chlorinated cyclodienes include aldrin, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, chlordane and endosulfan. A 2- to 8-hour exposure leads to depressed central nervous system (CNS) activity, followed by hyperexcitability, tremors, and then seizures. The mechanism of action is the insecticide binding at the GABAA site in the GABA-gated chloride channel (IRAC group 2A), which inhibits chloride flow into the nerve.
* Other examples include dicofol, mirex, kepone, and pentachlorophenol. These can be either hydrophilic or hydrophobic, depending on their molecular structure.
===Insulators===
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were once commonly used electrical insulators and heat transfer agents. Their use has generally been phased out due to health concerns. PCBs were replaced by polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which bring similar toxicity and bioaccumulation concerns. 

==Toxicity==
Some types of organochlorides have significant toxicity to plants or animals, including humans. Dioxins, produced when organic matter is burned in the presence of chlorine, are persistent organic pollutants which pose dangers when they are released into the environment, as are some insecticides (such as DDT). For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid-20th century, also accumulates in food chains, as do its metabolites DDE and DDD, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species. DDT also posed further issues to the environment as it is extremely mobile, traces even being found in Antarctica despite the chemical never being used there. Some organochlorine compounds, such as sulfur mustards, nitrogen mustards, and Lewisite, are even used as chemical weapons due to their toxicity.

However, the presence of chlorine in an organic compound does not ensure toxicity. Some organochlorides are considered safe enough for consumption in foods and medicines. For example, peas and broad beans contain the natural chlorinated plant hormone 4-chloroindole-3-acetic acid (4-Cl-IAA); and the sweetener sucralose (Splenda) is widely used in diet products. , at least 165 organochlorides had been approved worldwide for use as pharmaceutical drugs, including the natural antibiotic vancomycin, the antihistamine loratadine (Claritin), the antidepressant sertraline (Zoloft), the anti-epileptic lamotrigine (Lamictal), and the inhalation anesthetic isoflurane.

Christopher Gillis was born on February 26, 1951, in Montreal, Quebec.

His sister, Margie Gillis, is also a dancer and choreographer; they were dance partners from childhood and collaborated on numerous shows. His brother, Jere Gillis, played professional hockey from 1977 to 1987 for the Vancouver Canucks, New York Rangers, Quebec Nordiques, Buffalo Sabres, and the Philadelphia Flyers.

Gillis studied with Finis Jhung, with Paul Taylor and with choreographers May O&#x27;Donnell and Norman Walker. He performed with José Limón&#x27;s company.

He joined the Paul Taylor Dance Company in 1976 in New York City. He lived and worked in New York for the next seventeen years. He was designated Taylor&#x27;s heir-apparent.

<text>KSEV (700 AM) is a commercial radio station, licensed to Tomball, Texas, and serving Greater Houston. It broadcasts a talk radio format and is owned by Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick. (Patrick is not related to sports radio and TV host Dan Patrick.) The studios and offices are on Katy Freeway (I-10) in Houston.

AM 700 is a clear-channel frequency reserved for WLW in Cincinnati, a Class A, 50,000-watt station. While KSEV operates with 15,000 watts by day, it must reduce power at night to 1,000 watts to avoid interference. It uses a directional antenna with a three-tower array. The transmitter is off Farm to Market Road 2978 in The Woodlands, Texas. There are only 13 other stations in the United States that broadcast on 700 kHz.

==Programming==
On weekdays, KSEV features local hosts in the morning and afternoon drive times, with paid brokered programming in middays and syndicated conservative talk shows heard the rest of the day. Chris Salcedo hosts the wake-up show, while Chris X. Blayney hosts afternoons. Syndicated programs include &quot;The Brian Kilmeade Show, The Dana Loesch Show, The Joe Pags Show&quot; and &quot;Red Eye Radio&quot;. On weekends, KSEV carries programs about money, health, lifestyle, food, cigars, home repair and gardening. Weekend syndicated hosts include Guy Benson and Rich Valdes. Most hours begin with an update from Townhall News.

The station&#x27;s primary competitors are two well-established talk stations, both owned by iHeartMedia, AM 740 KTRH and AM 950 KPRC, as well as Salem Media talk radio outlet AM 1070 KNTH and independently-owned AM 920 KYST.

==History==
On December 1, 1986, the station first signed on as KTBT. It was owned by Duncan Broadcasting and aired a middle of the road (MOR) music format. At first, the power was 2,500 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night. 
Howard Sellers acquired the station in September 1989. He kept the format as MOR. Sellers sold the station the following month.
In October 1989, the station changed owners again, as Sunbelt Broadcasting bought the station for only $47,164. Sunbelt&#x27;s president and owner was Dan Patrick, who was already hosting a show on KTBT. Previously, Patrick had served as sports director for KHOU-TV Channel 11 in Houston. Sunbelt changed the call sign to KSEV and switched the format to conservative talk. The station became an NBC Radio Network affiliate and also got a boost in power to 25,000 watts in the daytime, and 1,000 watts at night.

Patrick wore several hats as owner, general manager, and morning drive sports talk host in the early years of KSEV. Also in 1989, KSEV acquired the Houston-area rights to run the nationally syndicated &quot;Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;, while Limbaugh was relatively unknown. (Limbaugh later switched to 740 KTRH, owned by iHeartMedia, which also syndicated Limbaugh&#x27;s show.) In April of that year, Los Angeles Kings hockey games were aired; it ended in June 1993. Dallas Stars took over in the fall of that year. By 1990, along with Limbaugh and Patrick, KSEV had a lineup of local hosts which included Roger Gray, Jerry Trupiano, and former Houston Chronicle sportswriter Ed Fowler. Bob Hallmark was the program director and Rod Evans served as the news director. 
In 1995, KSEV was acquired by San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications. The format remained talk and Patrick stayed on as vice president and general manager. 
The station changed hands again in 2001, as Clear Channel sold KSEV to Liberman Broadcasting, based in Southern California. Even though Lieberman usually programs Spanish-language formats, KSEV remained a conservative talk station in English. Patrick remained KSEV&#x27;s vice president, running the station through a local marketing agreement (LMA). Patrick later bought the station from Lieberman. He now owns the station but no longer hosts a show on 700 AM, concentrating on his Lieutenant Governor duties.

<text>The Family Party of Germany () is a minor conservative political party in Germany. It has elected members to several local councils in the state of Saarland. The party wants to introduce a right to vote for children carried out by the legal guardians.

== History ==
In the 2005 federal election, the Family Party received 0.4% of the national vote, its best result in a federal election yet.

In the 2009 federal election, the Family Party received 0.3% of the national vote (120,718 votes in total).

In the 2013 federal election, the Family Party fell to 0.02% of the national vote (7,449 votes in total). This was the party&#x27;s worst result in a federal election since the 1994 federal election, when it did not participate. 

In the 2014 European parliament elections, the Family Party received 0.69% of the national vote (202,871 votes in total) and elected one Member of the European Parliament - Arne Gericke, however he later went on to join Freie Wähler in June 2017. 

In the 2017 federal election, the Family Party did not run a list, and instead only ran candidates in the constituencies. The party received 506 votes. 

In the 2019 European Parliament election, the Family Party slightly increased their vote share to 0.73% of the national vote (273,828 votes in total). Lead candidate Helmut Geuking was elected as an MEP.

In the 2024 European Parliament election, the Family Party received 0.61% of the national vote (243,975 votes in total). Helmut Geuking was succeeded by Niels Geuking.

== Ideology and Platform ==
The Family Party is a firmly right-wing party that is socially conservative. It was formerly part of the ECR group and now is part of the EPP group. However, the party claims to be a party of the political center in its federal election platform. The party also calls for equal treatment of family work and paid work, and wants to create political framework conditions to enable women and men to start families without economic, political or social disadvantages.

<text>&quot;The Adventure of the &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&quot;, one of the 56 Sherlock Holmes short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is one of 12 stories in the cycle collected as &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. It was first published in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in the United Kingdom in April 1893, and in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; in the United States on 15 April 1893.

It is chronologically the earliest case in Sherlock Holmes canon. This story is related mainly by Holmes rather than Watson, and is the first case to which Holmes applied his powers of deduction, having treated it as a mere hobby until this time. This is one of numerous Sherlock Holmes stories in which a protagonist is haunted by an old acquaintance for an old crime. The others include &quot;The Boscombe Valley Mystery&quot; &quot;Black Peter&quot;, &quot;The Sign of Four&quot;, &quot;The Five Orange Pips&quot;, &quot;The Resident Patient&quot;, etc. It is also one of his many stories that deal with the fate of characters who return to England after having spent time abroad in the colonies of the British Empire.

== Plot ==

In his university days, Holmes spent a month with his friend, Victor Trevor, at Victor&#x27;s father&#x27;s estate in Norfolk. While there, Holmes amazed his host, Victor&#x27;s father, who was a Justice of the Peace and a landowner. He had made his fortune in the goldfields in Australia. One of Holmes&#x27;s deductions was that the elder Mr. Trevor was once connected with someone with the initials &quot;J. A.&quot; whom he wanted to forget. His host then passed out on the table. Holmes had touched a sore spot, and possibly did not believe the old man&#x27;s explanation once he had come back to himself that J. A. had been an old lover.

Holmes perceived that he was making his host uncomfortable and decided to take his leave. The evening before he did this, another old man suddenly appeared at the house causing the elder Mr. Trevor to rush for a shot of brandy before greeting him. They had apparently been shipmates some 30 years earlier, and Mr. Trevor said something about finding him some work. Soon afterwards, Holmes and his friend found Mr. Trevor drunk.

Holmes then left the Trevor estate and spent the next seven weeks at his chemistry experiments, suddenly receiving a telegram from the younger Trevor begging him to come back to Norfolk. Once he got there, Victor told Holmes that his father was dying as a result of a stroke suffered after he received a letter. They found that he had died while Victor had been meeting Holmes at the station.

After Holmes had left the house seven weeks earlier, it seems that this old man who had come looking for work, and whose name was Hudson, proved to be as unruly an employee as could be imagined. He had demanded to be promoted from gardener to butler and had got what he wanted. He had taken unforgivable liberties which would normally have resulted in an employee&#x27;s dismissal. He was often drunk. Victor could not stand him and would have beaten Hudson up if he had been younger. The other staff had complained about him. However, Victor&#x27;s father always let him get away with any infamy. Suddenly, Hudson announced that he was leaving because he had tired of Norfolk, and he was going to Hampshire to see Beddoes, another old shipmate.

Now, Holmes&#x27;s friend had become thin and careworn by the ordeal. He had thought that the trouble was over when Hudson had left, but then came the letter, from Fordingbridge in Hampshire. It read:

:&quot;The supply of game for London is going steadily up. Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your hen pheasant&#x27;s life.&quot;

It meant nothing to Victor, and it was quite a while before Holmes saw anything in it. He found the key. If one read every third word beginning with the first, there was an intelligible message: &quot;The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for your life.&quot;

Holmes had deduced that the game was blackmail. Some guilty secret had been the power that Hudson had held over the elder Mr. Trevor. The old man&#x27;s dying words to his doctor unlocked the secret. Some papers were found in Mr. Trevor&#x27;s Japanese cabinet.

The document was a confession. The elder Mr. Trevor had once borne the name James Armitage (initials: J. A.) and had been a criminal having embezzled money from the bank where he worked and been caught. He was sentenced to transportation.

Once on the ship, the &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;, bound for Australia from Falmouth, Armitage found out from a neighbouring prisoner that there was a conspiracy to take over the ship. The neighbour, Jack Prendergast, had financed the scheme out of the nearly £250,000 in unrecovered money from his crime. Many of the crew, even officers, were in his employ, and even the chaplain Wilson, who was not truly a clergyman at all. Wilson, while pretending to minister to the prisoners, was actually furnishing them with pistols and other equipment to be used when the time was right. Armitage also drew his other neighbour, Evans, into the scheme.

As might be expected, all did not go as planned. The takeover was accomplished unexpectedly when the ship&#x27;s doctor discovered a pistol while treating a prisoner. The prisoners then had to make their move right away or they would lose the element of surprise. In the ensuing mêlée, the Captain and many other men were killed, and there arose a dispute between Prendergast with his supporters and a group including Armitage over what to do with the few loyal crewmen still left alive. Armitage and others would not stand for cold-blooded murder. They were cast adrift in a small boat to make their way as they would.

Shortly after leaving in their small boat, the &quot;Gloria Scott&quot; blew up as the result of the violence spreading to where the gunpowder was kept. The men in the small boat, among whom was also Evans, hurried back to the site and rescued one survivor—Hudson.

The next day, as luck would have it, the men were rescued by another ship, the &quot;Hotspur&quot;, also bound for Australia. They passed themselves off as survivors from a passenger ship and once in Australia, headed for the goldfields. Armitage changed his name to Trevor, and Evans changed his name to Beddoes. Both later returned to England as rich men.

All had gone well until Hudson had suddenly shown up.

Since no scandal involving the &quot;Gloria Scott&quot; ever followed the odd message from Beddoes (Evans), and since neither Hudson nor Evans was ever heard from again, the Police believed Hudson had done away with Evans while Holmes believed that Evans had likely killed Hudson, believing that he had told all, when in fact he had not, and then fled with as much money as he could lay his hands on.

The case is referenced by Holmes once more in &quot;The Adventure of the Sussex Vampire&quot; when Holmes consults an index of his past exploits for references to &quot;vampires&quot; and remarks on &quot;the Voyage of the &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&quot; listed under &quot;V&quot;. It is also mentioned in passing in &quot;The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual&quot; as Holmes recounts to Watson his early cases when he first became a detective.

== Discrepancy ==
The confession account contained a scribbled footnote from the elder Trevor that recorded the fatal note delivered to him. This contradicts the stated fact that Trevor never regained consciousness until the very end of his life, at which time he merely revealed where the confession lay.

According to Trevor&#x27;s confession the &quot;Gloria Scott&quot; left Falmouth &quot;thirty years ago&quot; and precisely in 1855, but that would set Holmes&#x27;s enquiry in 1885 and not in his college years, as he told Watson. Since further in the story the elder Trevor writes also: &quot;For more than twenty years we have led peaceful and useful lives&quot;, we can assume that the exact date is around 1875, which would fit Holmes&#x27;s reference to his college years. It is also possible that the &quot;thirty years&quot; was a rounding of twenty-five years, which would place the case in 1880.

== Publication history ==
The story was published in the UK in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in April 1893, and in the US in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; on 15 April 1893. It was also published in the US edition of the &quot;Strand&quot; in May 1893. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot;, and with two illustrations by W. H. Hyde in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. It was included in the short story collection &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which was published in the UK in December 1893 and in the US in February 1894.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film and television ===
The story was adapted as a 1923 short film for the Sherlock Holmes Stoll film series, with Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson.

The 1954–1955 &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; television series starring Ronald Howard as Holmes and H. Marion Crawford as Watson loosely adapted the story for its episode &quot;The Case of the Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot;, changing the name of the ship to the &quot;Gloria North&quot;. It retains elements from the story, such as a respectable character with a tattoo he has tried to erase but which Holmes observes anyway (in the episode, the tattoo was the initials &quot;G.N.&quot; for &quot;Gloria North&quot; rather than &quot;J.A.&quot;). The episode was later remade, retaining the plot structure and much of the dialogue, for the 1980 American-Polish series &quot;Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson&quot; starring Geoffrey Whitehead, which was also produced by Sheldon Reynolds.

&quot;The &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&quot; was a 2001 episode of the animated series &quot;Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century&quot;, in which the titular prison ship was a spacecraft en route to the Moon.

In the 2014 episode &quot;The Empty Hearse&quot;, the first episode of the third series of the BBC television series &quot;Sherlock&quot;, Dr. Watson&#x27;s fiancee, Mary Morstan, solves a coded text message on a cellphone by reading every third word. In the fourth series episode &quot;The Final Problem&quot; in 2017, it is revealed that Holmes had a childhood friend named Victor Trevor.

=== Radio and audio dramas ===
Edith Meiser adapted the story as an episode of the American radio series &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson. The episode aired on 21 January 1932. Other episodes adapted from the story aired on 14 April 1935 (with Louis Hector as Holmes and Lovell as Watson) and 1 October 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson).

Meiser also adapted the story for the American radio series &quot;The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; as an episode with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson, which aired on 28 December 1941.

The story was adapted as an episode of the American radio series &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; titled &quot;The Gloria Scott&quot;. The episode, which starred Kevin McCarthy as Sherlock Holmes and Court Benson as Dr. Watson, first aired in November 1977.

&quot;The Gloria Scott&quot; was dramatised by Vincent McInerney for BBC Radio 4 in 1992, as part of the 1989–1998 radio series starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. It featured Simon Treves as Victor and Terence Edmond as Trevor.

A 2008 episode of &quot;The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, a series on the American radio show &quot;Imagination Theatre&quot;, was adapted from the story, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

In 2024, the podcast Sherlock&amp;Co adapted the story in a two-episodes adventure called &quot;The Gloria Scott&quot;, starring Paul Waggot as Watson and Harry Attwell as Sherlock.

=== Print ===
In 2005, Croatian writer Mima Simić published a short story collection entitled &quot;Pustolovine Glorije Scott&quot; 
(&quot;Adventures of Gloria Scott&quot;). This loose adaptation introduces a queer parody of the Sherlock Holmes canon through the gender reversal of the protagonists: disastrous detective Gloria Scott and her faithful assistant Mary Lambert. A TV animation series based on this adaptation was under development as of 2014.

The 2016 book &quot;The Murder of Mary Russell&quot; by Laurie R. King is based on the premise that &quot;Gloria Scott&quot;&#x27;s Hudson is none other than the father of Holmes&#x27; landlady Mrs. Hudson.

<text>Verchères () is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in Montérégie, Quebec, located on the south bank of the Saint Lawrence River. The population as of the Canada 2021 Census was 5,759.

== History ==

In the 17th century, the settlement at Verchères was the scene of an Iroquois raid that was apparently thwarted by the ingenuity of a 14-year-old girl named Madeleine (now known as Madeleine de Verchères). A cast-iron statue of Madeleine de Verchères stands today by the former location of the settlement stronghold on the shore of the Saint-Lawrence river.

In French, the word Verchères can be used as an adjective to describe a specific type of rowboat invented in Verchères at the end of the 19th century, i.e. &quot;chaloupe verchères&quot;. A specimen of the rowboat is on permanent outdoor display during the summer and fall at the Parc Jean-Marie Moreau across from the town office.

The motto of Verchères is &quot;In Tenebris Lumen Rectis Corde&quot;. The streets of Verchères are mostly named after the patronyms of residing families but also after local people who rose to celebrity in Canadian history.

== Geography ==
Verchères is located about 40 km east of Montréal. The municipality is traversed by Road 132, an important road that runs along the St. Lawrence River and connects several municipalities along the south shore. The river plays a significant role in the economy of Verchères, offering picturesque views and opportunities for recreational activities.

The terrain is relatively flat, typical of the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands, with some gentle elevations and wooded areas. The landscape of Verchères is typically rural, with farmland, natural areas and residential zones.

<doc id="1271862" wikidata="Q693249" url="?curid=1271862" title="Prima donna">
<text>In opera or &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, a prima donna (; Italian for &#x27;first lady&#x27;; : &quot;prime donne&quot;) is the leading female singer in the company, the person to whom the &quot;prime&quot; roles would be given. 

&quot;Prime donne&quot; often had grand off-stage personalities and were seen as demanding of their colleagues. Because of this, the term has spread in contemporary usage, from its original usage in opera to referring to anyone behaving in a demanding or temperamental fashion or having an inflated view of oneself.

The prima donna in opera was normally, but not necessarily, a soprano. The corresponding term for the male lead (usually a castrato in the 17th and 18th centuries, later a tenor) is primo uomo.

==Opera==

In 19th century Italy, the leading woman in an opera or &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; company was known as the prima donna, literally the &quot;first lady&quot;. This woman, usually the principal soprano of the company, would typically perform leading roles and generally sing more music than other women in the company. Famous opera &quot;prime donne&quot; have often caused opera enthusiasts to divide into opposing &quot;clubs&quot;, supporting one singer over another. The rivalry between the fans of Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi, for example, was one of the most famous, despite the friendship of the two singers.

The designation &quot;prima donna assoluta&quot; () is occasionally applied to a prima donna of outstanding excellence. It has also been used to describe the creators of heroic coloratura roles in the first half of the 19th century.

The woman who sang the second major part in an opera was, correspondingly, referred to as the &quot;seconda donna&quot;; by the late 18th century, this role was sometimes called the &quot;altra prima donna&quot;.

==Personality==
At times, these &quot;prime donne&quot; had grand off-stage personalities and strict demands of fellow troupe members, musicians, set and wardrobe designers, producers, and other staff. However, they were deferentially tolerated because of their consummate talent and their draw at the box office. From this experience, the term &quot;prima donna&quot; has come into common usage in any field, denoting someone who behaves in a demanding, often temperamental fashion, revealing an inflated view of themselves, their talent, and their importance. Due to this association, the contemporary meaning of the word has taken on the negative connotation of a vain, undisciplined, egotistical, obnoxious, or temperamental person who finds it difficult to work under direction or as part of a team but whose contributions are essential to the success of the team.
