<doc id="1273349" wikidata="Q312357" url="?curid=1273349" title="Chinguetti">
<text>Chinguetti ( ; ) is a ksar and a medieval trading center in northern Mauritania, located on the Adrar Plateau east of Atar. Chinguetti had a population of 4,800 as of 2013.

Founded in the 13th century as the center of several trans-Saharan trade routes, this small city continues to attract a handful of visitors who admire its spare architecture, scenery, and ancient libraries. The city is seriously threatened by the encroaching desert; high sand dunes mark the western boundary and several houses have been abandoned to the sand.

The town is split in two by a wadi. On one side, there is the old sector, and on the other the new one. The indigenous Saharan architecture of older sectors of the city features houses constructed of reddish dry-stone and mud-brick techniques, with flat roofs timbered from palms. Many of the older houses feature hand-hewn doors cut from massive ancient acacia trees, which have long disappeared from the surrounding area. Many homes include courtyards or patios that crowd along narrow streets leading to the central mosque.

== History ==
Occupied for thousands of years, the Chinguetti region was once a broad savannah; rock paintings at Agrour Amogjar, in the nearby Amogjar Pass, feature images of giraffes, cows, and people in a green landscape. It is quite different from the sand dunes of the surrounding desert, which make up most of the region today.

===Founding===
The city was founded in AD 777. The name &quot;Chinguetti&quot; means &quot;spring of horses&quot; in the Azayr language, an extinct dialect of Soninke that was heavily mixed with Berber. The area, at that time far more green than today, was home to agricultural peoples ancestral to several sub-Saharan ethnic groups, including the Soninke. 

===Center of Trade===
By the 11th century, Chinguetti had become a trading center for a confederation of Berber tribes, known as the &quot;Sanhaja&quot;. They eventually melded with the Almoravids, represented by Abdallah ibn Yasin, who would eventually control an empire stretching from present-day Senegal to &quot;al-Andalus&quot; in modern-day Spain. The city&#x27;s stark, unadorned architecture reflects the strict religious beliefs of the Almoravids, who spread the Malikite rite of Sunni Islam throughout the Western Maghreb.

After two centuries of decline, the city was effectively re-founded in the 13th century as a fortified trading-center for nomadic trans-Saharan caravans, and as a means of connecting the Mediterranean with Sub-Saharan Africa. Although the walls of the original fortification disappeared centuries ago, many of the buildings in the old section of the city date from this period.

===World Heritage Site===
In 1996, UNESCO designated Chinguetti, along with the cities of Ouadane, Tichitt and Oualata, also in the dunes area, as a World Heritage Site. Notable buildings in the town include The Friday Mosque of Chinguetti, an ancient structure of dry-stone construction, featuring a square minaret capped with five ostrich egg finials; the former French Foreign Legion fortress; and a tall watertower. The old quarter has five important manuscript libraries of scientific and Qur&#x27;anic texts, with many dating from the later Middle Ages. In recent years, the Mauritanian government, the U.S. Peace Corps, and various NGOs have attempted to position the city as a center for adventurous tourists. Visitors may &quot;ski&quot; down its sand dunes, visit the libraries, and appreciate the stark beauty of the Sahara. 

The Friday Mosque is widely considered by Mauritanians to be the national symbol of the country. The recently discovered offshore oilfield was named Chinguetti in its honor.

== Religious importance ==
For centuries, the city was a principal gathering place for pilgrims of the Maghreb to gather, on their way to Mecca. It became known as a holy city in its own right, especially for pilgrims unable to make the long journey to the Arab Peninsula. It also became a center of Islamic religious and scientific scholarship in West Africa. In addition to religious training, the schools of Chinguetti taught students rhetoric, law, astronomy, mathematics, and medicine. For many centuries, all of Mauritania was commonly known in the Arab world as &quot;Bilad Shinqit,&quot; &quot;the land of Chinguetti.&quot; It is sometimes said to be the seventh-most holy city of Islam, The city remains one of the world&#x27;s most important historical sites both in terms of the history of Islam and the history of West Africa.

Although largely abandoned to the desert, the city features a series of medieval manuscript libraries without peer in West Africa. The area around the &quot;Rue des Savants&quot; (or “street of intelligent ones”) was once famous as a gathering place for scholars, and as a place to debate the finer points of Islamic law. Today, the quiet city still offers the urban and religious architecture of the Moorish empire as it existed in the Middle Ages.

==Climate==
In 2021 Chinguetti was featured in a BBC documentary &quot;Life at 50 degrees C&quot;, which looked at ordinary people living in increasingly inhospitable areas.

<text>A boilersuit (or boiler suit), also known as coveralls, is a loose fitting garment covering the whole body except for the head, hands and feet.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;boilersuit&quot; is most common in the UK, where the 2023 edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; lists the word as having been first used on 31 July 1883 in the &quot;Liverpool Mercury&quot; newspaper. The garments are typically known as &quot;coveralls&quot; in North America, while &quot;overall(s)&quot; is used elsewhere. In North America, &quot;overall&quot; is more usually understood as a bib-and-brace overall, which is a type of trousers with attached suspenders.

A more tight-fitting garment that is otherwise similar to a boilersuit is usually called a jumpsuit. The &quot;siren suit&quot; favoured by Winston Churchill (but also worn by many others in the UK when air raids were a threat) during the Second World War was closely similar to a boilersuit.

== Description ==
A boilersuit is a one-piece garment with full-length sleeves and legs like a jumpsuit, but usually less tight-fitting. Its main feature is that it has no gap between jacket and trousers or between lapels, and no loose jacket tails. It often has a long thin pocket down the outside of the right thigh to hold long tools. It usually has a front fastening extending the whole length of the front of the body up to the throat, with no lapels. It may be fastened with buttons, a zip, velcro, or snap fasteners. Boilersuits with an attached hood are available. The word &quot;boilersuit&quot; may also refer to disposable garments such as DuPont&#x27;s Tyvek suits.

==Usage==
Coveralls are most often worn as protective clothing over &quot;street&quot; clothes at work. They can be used for painting and decorating, mechanical work, farming, factory work, and other activities where clothes may become soiled. Many companies provide workers with corporate branded boilersuits for identification and marketing.
Coveralls are also sometimes used as prison uniforms in the U.S and other countries.

Police tactical units often use boilersuits as a uniform, for instance the French police unit Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité, and the Austrian units EKO Cobra and WEGA. Similar coveralls made of Nomex in olive drab (and more recently, desert tan) are also used by the crews of armoured fighting vehicles in the US Army and Marine Corps, where the men and also their suits are sometimes called &quot;CVCs&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;Combat Vehicle Crewman&quot;.

More form fitting coveralls with many zippered pockets, originally made of cotton treated for flame resistance, but made of Nomex since the late 1960s, have been used as flight suits since the beginning of World War II. There are two main categories for coveralls: cloth and disposable.

Both cloth and disposable coveralls are manufactured with their own unique protective properties including: high-visibility, insulation to protect against cold weather, waterproof, flame resistant to protect against fire, arc resistant to protect against flash fires, and even microporous fabrics when exposed to hazardous chemicals.

Japanese politicians have been known to use boiler suits to convey an image of preparedness.

Coveralls called student boilersuits are used by university students in some Nordic countries as a sort of party-uniform, with insignia on the back and colour varying with programme and university.

The suit is associated with the slasher subgenre, being worn by Michael Myers of the &quot;Halloween&quot; films.

Pete Townshend of The Who frequently wore a white boiler suit during performances and in publicity photographs from 1969-71.

The Church of Scientology has punished Sea Org members in the Rehabilitation Project Force by making them wear black boiler suits.

<doc id="1273364" wikidata="Q838695" url="?curid=1273364" title="First Congo War">
<text>The First Congo War, also known as Africa&#x27;s First World War, was a civil and international military conflict that lasted from 24 October 1996 to 16 May 1997, primarily taking place in Zaire (which was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the conflict). The war resulted in the overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, who was replaced by rebel leader Laurent-Désiré Kabila. This conflict, which also involved multiple neighboring countries, set the stage for the Second Congo War (1998–2003) due to tensions between Kabila and his former allies.

By 1996, Zaire was in a state of political and economic collapse, exacerbated by long-standing internal strife and the destabilizing effects of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, which had led to the influx of refugees and militant groups into the country. The Zairean government under Mobutu, weakened by years of dictatorship and corruption, was unable to maintain control, and the army had deteriorated significantly. With Mobutu terminally ill and unable to manage his fractured government, loyalty to his regime waned. The end of the Cold War further reduced Mobutu&#x27;s international support, leaving his regime politically and financially bankrupt.

The war began when Rwanda invaded eastern Zaire in 1996 to target rebel groups that had sought refuge there. This invasion expanded as Uganda, Burundi, Angola, and Eritrea joined, while an anti-Mobutu coalition of Congolese rebels formed. Despite efforts to resist, Mobutu&#x27;s regime quickly collapsed, with widespread violence and ethnic killings occurring throughout the conflict. Hundreds of thousands died as the government forces, supported by Sudanese troops, were overwhelmed.

After Mobutu&#x27;s ousting, Kabila&#x27;s government renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, his regime remained unstable, as he sought to distance himself from his former Rwandan and Ugandan backers. In response, Kabila expelled foreign troops and forged alliances with regional powers such as Angola, Zimbabwe, and Namibia. These actions prompted a second invasion from Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the Second Congo War in 1998. Some historians and analysts view the First and Second Congo Wars as part of a continuous conflict with lasting effects that continue to affect the region today.

==Background==

===Decline of Zaire===

A ethnic Ngbandi, Mobutu came to power in 1965 and enjoyed support from the United States government because of his anti-communist stance while in office. However, Mobutu&#x27;s totalitarian rule and corrupt policies allowed the Zairian state to decay, evidenced by a 65% decrease in Zairian GDP between independence in 1960 and the end of Mobutu&#x27;s reign in 1997. Following the end of the Cold War in 1992, the United States stopped supporting Mobutu in favor of what it called a &quot;new generation of African leaders&quot;, including Rwanda&#x27;s Paul Kagame and Uganda&#x27;s Yoweri Museveni.

A wave of democratization swept across Africa during the 1990s. Under substantial internal and external pressure for a democratic transition in Zaire, Mobutu promised reform. He officially ended the one-party system he had maintained since 1967, but ultimately proved unwilling to implement broad reform, alienating allies both at home and abroad. In fact, the Zairian state had all but ceased to exist. The majority of the Zairian population relied on an informal economy for their subsistence, since the official economy was not reliable. Furthermore, the Zairian national army, &quot;Forces Armées Zaïroises&quot; (FAZ), was forced to prey upon the population for survival; Mobutu himself allegedly once asked FAZ soldiers why they needed pay when they had weapons.

Mobutu&#x27;s rule encountered considerable internal resistance, and given the weak central state, rebel groups could find refuge in Zaire&#x27;s eastern provinces, far from the capital, Kinshasa. Opposition groups included leftists who had supported Patrice Lumumba (1925–1961), as well as ethnic and regional minorities opposed to the nominal dominance of Kinshasa. Laurent-Désiré Kabila, an ethnic Luba from Katanga province who would eventually overthrow Mobutu, had fought Mobutu&#x27;s régime since its inception.
The inability of the Mobutuist régime to control rebel movements in its eastern provinces eventually allowed its internal and external foes to ally.

===Ethnic tensions===
Tensions had existed between various ethnic groups in eastern Zaire for centuries, especially between the agrarian tribes of Congo and the Banyarwanda in the Eastern region of Congo of Kivu. When colonial boundaries were drawn in the late nineteenth century many Banyarwanda found themselves on the Congolese side of the Rwandan border, in Kivu province. The earliest of these migrants arrived before colonisation in the 1880s, followed by emigrants whom the Belgian colonizers forcibly relocated to Congo to perform manual labour (after 1908), and by another significant wave of emigrants fleeing the social revolution of 1959 that brought the Hutu to power in Kigali.

Tutsi who emigrated to Zaire before Congolese independence in 1960 are known as Banyamulenge, meaning &quot;from Mulenge&quot;, and had the right to citizenship under Zairian law. Tutsi who emigrated to Zaire following independence are known as Banyarwanda, although the native locals often do not distinguish between the two, calling both Banyamulenge and considering them foreigners.

After coming to power in 1965, Mobutu gave the Banyamulenge political power in the east in hopes that they, as a minority, would keep a tight grip on power and prevent more populous ethnicities from forming an opposition. This move aggravated the existing ethnic tensions by strengthening the Banyamulenge&#x27;s hold over important stretches of land in North Kivu that indigenous people claimed as their own. From 1963 to 1966 the Hunde and Nande ethnic groups of North Kivu fought against Rwandan emigrants — both Tutsi and Hutu – in the Kanyarwanda War, which involved several massacres.

Despite a strong Rwandan presence in Mobutu&#x27;s government, in 1981, Zaire adopted a restrictive citizenship law which denied the Banyamulenge and Banyarwanda citizenship and therewith all political rights. Though never enforced, the law greatly angered individuals of Rwandan descent and contributed to a rising sense of ethnic hatred. From 1993 to 1996 Hunde, Nande, and Nyanga youth regularly attacked the Banyamulenge, leading to a total of 14,000 deaths. In 1995 the Zairian Parliament ordered all peoples of Rwandan or Burundian descent repatriated to their countries of origin, including the Banyamulenge. Due to political exclusion and ethnic violence, as early as 1991 the Banyamulenge developed ties to the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a mainly Tutsi rebel movement based in Uganda but with aspirations to power in Rwanda.

===Rwandan genocide===

The most deciding event in precipitating the war was the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda in 1994, which sparked a mass exodus of refugees known as the Great Lakes refugee crisis. During the 100-day genocide, hundreds of thousands of Tutsi and sympathizers were massacred at the hands of predominantly Hutu aggressors. The genocide ended when the Hutu government in Kigali was overthrown by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF).

Of those who fled Rwanda during the crisis, about 1.5 million settled in eastern Zaire. These refugees included Tutsi who fled the Hutu &quot;génocidaires&quot; as well as one million Hutu that fled the Tutsi RPF&#x27;s subsequent retaliation. Prominent among the latter group were the &quot;génocidaires&quot; themselves, such as elements of the former Rwandan Army, &quot;&quot; (FAR), and independent Hutu extremist groups known as &quot;Interahamwe&quot;. Often, these Hutu forces allied themselves with local Mai Mai militias, who granted them access to mines and weapons. Though these were initially self-defense organizations, they quickly became aggressors.

The Hutu set up camps in eastern Zaire from which they attacked both the newly arrived Rwandan Tutsi as well as the Banyamulenge and Banyarwanda. These attacks caused about one hundred deaths a month during the first half of 1996. Furthermore, the newly arrived militants were intent on returning to power in Rwanda and began launching attacks against the new regime in Kigali, which represented a serious security threat to the infant state. Not only was the Mobutu government incapable of controlling the former &quot;génocidaires&quot; for previously mentioned reasons but actually supported them in training and supplying for an invasion of Rwanda, forcing Kigali to act.

==Banyamulenge rebellion==
Given the exacerbated ethnic tensions and the lack of government control in the past, Rwanda took action against the security threat posed by &quot;génocidaires&quot; who had found refuge in eastern Zaire. The government in Kigali began forming Tutsi militias for operations in Zaire probably as early as 1995 and chose to act following an exchange of fire between Rwandan Tutsi and Zairian Green Berets that marked the outbreak of the Banyamulenge Rebellion on 31 August 1996.

While there was general unrest in eastern Zaire, the rebellion was probably not a grassroots movement; Uganda president Yoweri Museveni, who supported and worked closely with Rwanda in the First Congo War, later recalled that the rebellion was incited by Zairian Tutsi who had been recruited by the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA). The initial goal of the Banyamulenge Rebellion was to seize power in Zaire&#x27;s eastern Kivu provinces and combat the extremist Hutu forces attempting to continue the genocide in their new home. However, the rebellion did not remain Tutsi-dominated for long. Mobutu&#x27;s harsh and selfish rule created enemies in virtually all sectors of Zairian society. As a result, the new rebellion benefited from massive public support and grew to be a general revolution rather than a mere Banyamulenge uprising.

Banyamulenge elements and non-Tutsi militias coalesced into the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) under the leadership of Laurent-Désiré Kabila, who had been a long-time opponent of the Mobutu government and was a leader of one of the three main rebel groups that founded the AFDL. While the AFDL was an ostensibly Zairian rebel movement, Rwanda had played a key role in its formation. Observers of the war, as well as the Rwandan Defense Minister and vice-president at the time, Paul Kagame, claim that the AFDL was formed in and directed from Kigali and contained not only Rwandan-trained troops but also regulars of the RPA.

==Foreign involvement==

===Rwanda===
According to expert observers, as well as Kagame himself, Rwanda played the largest role of a foreign actor, if not the largest role of all, in the First Congo War. Kigali was instrumental in the formation of the AFDL and sent its own troops to fight alongside the rebels. While its actions were originally sparked by the security threat posed by the Zairian-based &quot;génocidaires,&quot; Kigali was pursuing multiple goals during its invasion of Zaire.

The first and foremost of these was the suppression of &quot;génocidaires&quot; who had been launching attacks against the new Rwandan state from Zaire. Kagame claimed that Rwandan agents had discovered the plans to invade Rwanda with support from Mobutu; in response, Kigali began its intervention with the intention of dismantling the refugee camps in which the &quot;génocidaires&quot; often took refuge and destroying the structure of these anti-Rwandan elements.

A second goal cited by Kagame was the overthrow of Mobutu. While partially a means to minimize the threat in eastern Zaire, the new Rwandan state also sought to set up a puppet regime in Kinshasa. This goal was not particularly threatening to other states in the region because it was ostensibly a means to securing Rwandan stability and because many of them also opposed Mobutu. Kigali was further aided by the tacit support of the United States, which supported Kagame as a member of the new generation of African leaders.

However, the true intentions of Rwanda are not entirely clear. Some authors have proposed that dismantling refugee camps was a means of replenishing Rwanda&#x27;s depleted population and workforce following the genocide; because the destruction of the camps was followed by forced repatriation of Tutsi regardless of whether they were Rwandan or Zairian. The intervention may also have been motivated by revenge; the Rwandan forces, as well as the AFDL, massacred retreating Hutu refugees in several known instances. A commonly cited factor for Rwandan actions is that the RPF, which had recently come to power in Kigali, had come to see itself as the protector of the Tutsi nation and was therefore partially acting in defense of its Zairian brethren.

Rwanda possibly also harbored ambitions to annex portions of eastern Zaire. Pasteur Bizimungu, president of Rwanda from 1994 to 2000, presented the then-US ambassador to Rwanda, Robert Gribbin, with the idea of a &quot;Greater Rwanda.&quot; This idea purports that the ancient state of Rwanda included parts of eastern Zaire that should actually belong to Rwanda. However, it appears that Rwanda never seriously attempted to annex these territories. The history of conflict in the Congo is often associated with illegal resource exploitation but, although Rwanda did benefit financially by plundering Zaire&#x27;s wealth, this is not usually considered their initial motivation for Rwandan intervention in the First Congo War.

===Uganda===
As a close ally of the RPF, Uganda also played a major role in the First Congo War. Prominent members of the RPF had fought alongside Yoweri Museveni in the Ugandan Bush War that brought him to power, and Museveni allowed the RPF to use Uganda as a base during the 1990 offensive into Rwanda and subsequent civil war. Given their historical ties, the Rwandan and Ugandan governments were closely allied and Museveni worked closely with Kagame throughout the First Congo War. Ugandan soldiers were present in Zaire throughout the conflict and Museveni likely helped Kagame plan and direct the AFDL.

Lt. Col. James Kabarebe of the AFDL, for example, was a former member of Uganda&#x27;s National Resistance Army, the military wing of the rebel movement that brought Museveni to power, and French and Belgian intelligence reported that 15,000 Ugandan-trained Tutsi fought for the AFDL. However, Uganda did not support Rwanda in all aspects of the war. Museveni was reportedly much less inclined to overthrow Mobutu, preferring to keep the rebellion in the East where the former &quot;génocidaires&quot; were operating.

===Angola===
Angola remained on the sidelines until 1997, but its entrance into the fray greatly increased the already superior strength of anti-Mobutu forces. The Angolan government chose to act primarily through the original-Katanga Gendarmeries later called the &quot;Tigres&quot;, proxy groups formed from the remnants of police units exiled from Congo in the 1960s, fighting to return to their homeland. Luanda did also deploy regular troops. Angola chose to participate in the First Congo War because members of Mobutu&#x27;s government were directly involved in supplying the Angolan rebel group, UNITA.

It is unclear exactly how the government benefited from this relationship, other than personal enrichment for several officials, but it is certainly possible that Mobutu was unable to control the actions of some members of his government. Regardless of the reasoning in Kinshasa, Angola entered the war on the side of the rebels and was determined to overthrow the Mobutu government, which it saw as the only way to address the threat posed by the Zairian-UNITA relationship.

===UNITA===
Due to its ties to the Mobutu government, UNITA also participated in the First Congo War. The greatest impact that it had on the war was probably that it gave Angola reason to join the anti-Mobutu coalition. However, UNITA forces fought alongside FAZ forces in at least several instances. Among other examples, Kagame claimed that his forces fought a pitched battle against UNITA near Kinshasa towards the end of the war.

===Others===
Numerous other external actors played lesser roles in the First Congo War. Burundi, which had recently come under the rule of a pro-Tutsi leader, supported Rwandan and Ugandan involvement in Zaire but provided very limited military support. Zambia, Zimbabwe, and the South Sudanese rebel army, the SPLA, also gave measured amounts of military support to the rebel movement. Eritrea, an ally of Rwanda under Kagame, sent an entire battalion of its army to support the invasion of Zaire. Likewise, Tanzania, South Africa and Ethiopia provided support to the anti-Mobutu coalition. Other than from UNITA, Mobutu also received some aid from Sudan, whom Mobutu had long supported against the SPLA, though the exact amount of aid is unclear and ultimately was unable to hinder the advance of opposing forces. Zaire also employed foreign mercenaries from several African and European countries, including Chadian troops. France also provided Mobutu&#x27;s government with financial support and military aid, facilitated by the Central African Republic, and diplomatically advocated for international intervention to stop the AFDL&#x27;s advance, but later backed down due to U.S. pressure. China and Israel provided the Mobutu regime with technical assistance, while Kuwait also reportedly provided $64 million to Zaire for the purchase of weapons, but later denied doing so.

In 1997 United States European Command supervised the U.S. Army&#x27;s Southern Europe Task Force (SETAF) and elements of two Marine Expeditionary Units to carry out Operation Guardian Retrieval, to evacuate approximately 550 US citizens from the country. SETAF prepared Joint Task Force Guardian Retrieval to carry out the non-combatant evacuation (NEO). The Marine Corps supported the evacuation with the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), special operations capable, which had initially been sent to Albania, to support Operation Silver Wake. The 26th MEU was relieved two weeks early by the and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit.

== Course of the war ==

=== 1996 ===

With active support from Rwanda, Uganda, and Eritrea, Kabila&#x27;s AFDL was able to capture 800 x 100 km of territory along the border with Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi by 25 December 1996. This occupation temporarily satisfied the rebels, because it gave them power in the east and allowed them to defend themselves against the former &quot;génocidaires&quot;. Likewise, the external actors had successfully crippled the ability of the same &quot;génocidaires&quot; to use Zaire as a base for attacks. There was a pause in the rebel advance following the acquisition of this buffer territory that lasted until Angola entered the war in February 1997.

During this time, Rwanda destroyed refugee camps the &quot;génocidaires&quot; had been using as safe-bases, and forcibly repatriated Tutsi to Rwanda. It also captured many lucrative diamond and coltan mines, which it later resisted relinquishing. Rwandan and aligned forces committed multiple atrocities, mainly against Hutu refugees. The true extent of the abuses is unknown because the AFDL and RPF carefully managed NGO and press access to areas where atrocities were thought to have occurred. However Amnesty International said as many as 200,000 Rwandese Hutu refugees were massacred by them and the Rwandan Defence Forces and aligned forces. The United Nations similarly documented mass killings of civilians by Rwandan, Ugandan and the AFDL soldiers in the DRC Mapping Exercise Report.

=== 1997 ===
Kabila&#x27;s forces launched an offensive in March 1997, and demanded that the Kinshasa government surrender. The rebels took Kasenga on 27 March. The government denied the rebels&#x27; success, starting a long pattern of false statements from the Defense Minister on the progress and conduct of the war. Negotiations were proposed in late March, and on 2 April a new Prime Minister of Zaire, Étienne Tshisekedi—a longtime rival of Mobutu—was installed. Kabila, by this point in control of roughly one-quarter of the country, dismissed this as irrelevant and warned Tshisekedi that he would have no part in a new government if he accepted the post.
There are two explanations for the restart of the rebel advance in 1997. The first, and most probable, is that Angola had joined the anti-Mobutu coalition, giving it numbers and strength far superior to the FAZ, and demanding that Mobutu be removed from power. Kagame presents another, possibly secondary, reason for the march on Kinshasa: that the employment of Serbian mercenaries in the battle for Walikale proved that &quot;Mobutu intended to wage real war against Rwanda.&quot; According to this logic, Rwanda&#x27;s initial concerns had been to manage the security threat in eastern Zaire but it was now forced to dispose of the hostile government in Kinshasa.

Whatever the case, once the advance resumed in 1997, there was virtually no meaningful resistance from what was left of Mobutu&#x27;s army. Kabila&#x27;s forces were only held back by the dilapidated state of Zaire&#x27;s infrastructure. In some areas, no real roads existed; the only means of transport were infrequently used dirt paths. The AFDL committed grave human rights violations, such as the carnage at a refugee camp of Hutu at Tingi-Tingi near Kisangani, where tens of thousands of refugees were massacred.

Coming from the east, the AFDL advanced westward in two pincer movements. The northern one took Kisangani, Boende, and Mbandaka, while the southern one took Bakwanga, and Kikwit. Around this time, Sudan attempted to coordinate with remnants of the FAZ and White Legion that were retreating northward to escape the AFDL. This was to prevent Zaire from becoming a safe haven for the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army (SPLA) and its allies, which were fighting the Sudanese government in the Second Sudanese Civil War at the time. The Mobutu loyalist forces were collapsing so quickly that they could not prevent the AFDL, SPLA and Ugandan military from occupying northeastern Zaire. Sudanese-backed Ugandan insurgent groups which had been based in the region were forced to retreat into southern Sudan alongside FAZ troops that had not yet surrendered and a smaller number of Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers. They attempted to reach the SAF base at Yei, not knowing that it had already been overrun by the SPLA. The column of about 4,000 fighters and their families was ambushed by the SPLA during Operation Thunderbolt on 12 March, and mostly destroyed; 2,000 were killed, and over 1,000 captured. The survivors fled to Juba. Meanwhile, the AFDL reached Kinshasa by the middle of May. Another AFDL group captured Lubumbashi on April 19 and moved on by air to Kinshasa. Mobutu fled Kinshasa on May 16, and the rebels entered the capital without serious resistance. The AFDL-allied Eritrean battalion had aided the rebels during the entire 1,500 km advance despite being not well equipped for the environment and lacking almost all logistical support. By the time the Eritreans arrived at Kinshasa along the AFDL, they were exhausted, starving and ill, having suffered heavy casualties as a result. They had to be evacuated from the country by the war&#x27;s end.

Throughout the rebel advance, there were attempts by the international community to negotiate a settlement. However, the AFDL did not take these negotiations seriously but instead partook so as to avoid international criticism for being unwilling to attempt a diplomatic solution while actually continuing its steady advance. The FAZ, which had been weak all along, was unable to mount any serious resistance to the strong AFDL and its foreign sponsors.

Mobutu fled first to his palace at Gbadolite and then to Rabat, Morocco, where he died on 7 September 1997. Kabila proclaimed himself president on 17 May, and immediately ordered a violent crackdown to restore order. He then attempted to reorganise the nation as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

==Aftermath==

The new Congolese state under Kabila&#x27;s rule proved to be disappointingly similar to Zaire under Mobutu. The economy remained in a state of severe disrepair and deteriorated further under Kabila&#x27;s corrupt rule. He failed to improve the government, which continued to be weak and corrupt. Instead, Kabila began a vigorous centralisation campaign, bringing renewed conflict with minority groups in the east who demanded autonomy.

Kabila also came to be seen as an instrument of the foreign regimes that put him in power. To counter this image and increase domestic support, he began to turn against his allies abroad. This culminated in the expulsion of all foreign forces from the DRC on 26 July 1998. The states with armed forces still in the DRC begrudgingly complied although some of them saw this as undermining their interests, particularly Rwanda, which had hoped to install a proxy-regime in Kinshasa.

Several factors that led to the First Congo War remained in place after Kabila&#x27;s accession to power. Prominent among these were ethnic tensions in eastern DRC, where the government still had little control. There the historical animosities remained and the opinion that Banyamulenge, as well as all Tutsi, were foreigners was reinforced by the foreign occupation in their defence. Furthermore, Rwanda had not been able to satisfactorily address its security concerns. By forcibly repatriating refugees, Rwanda had imported the conflict.

This manifested itself in the form of a predominantly Hutu insurgency in Rwanda&#x27;s western provinces that was supported by extremist elements in eastern DRC. Without troops in the DRC, Rwanda was unable to successfully combat the insurgents. In the first days of August 1998, two brigades of the new Congolese army rebelled against the government and formed rebel groups that worked closely with Kigali and Kampala. This marked the beginning of the Second Congo War.

In addition, elements of Mobutu&#x27;s army and loyalists as well as other groups involved in the First Congo War retreated into the Republic of the Congo (Congo-Brazzaville), where they fought in the 1997–1999 civil war.

<doc id="1273367" wikidata="Q735645" url="?curid=1273367" title="Atar, Mauritania">
<text>Atar (, Berber for &quot;mountain&quot;) is a town in northwestern Mauritania, the capital of the Adrar Region and the main settlement on the Adrar Plateau. Situated on the Oued Seguellil, it is home to an airport, a museum and a historic mosque, constructed in 1674.

In 2023, it had a population of 35,170.

==Geology and geography==
The Adrar&#x27;s mountains are from the primary era against the precambrian Tiris Zemmour. Near Atar, you can find stromatolites. In the North, you can find Choum with the train that comes from Nouadhibou and goes to Zouerate. East of Atar, through Amojjar Pass, is the difficult way to Chinguetti, Ouadane and the astonishing Richat Structure.

==Climate==
Atar has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) typical of the Sahara Desert, south of the tropic of Cancer. The weather is usually very hot, very sunny and very dry but it can be overcast sometimes. The annual average temperature is close to 30 °C (86 °F), meaning that excessive heat persists year-round. The annual mean rainfall amount is very low, averaging no more than 35 mm and it mainly falls in August and in September while the sunshine duration is high, at over 3,540 h of bright sunshine yearly. In 2019, Khadijetou Lekweiry reported the first appearance of the &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; parasite in the town.


==Tourism==
Today, the Atar is best known to outsiders as an entryway for tourists to visit the ruins of the ancient Moorish cities of Ouadane and Chinguetti. It was a key stop in the world&#x27;s longest off-road race, the Paris Dakar Rally, held every January.

==Small business sector==
The &quot;samaras&quot; (from Arab smela : sole) are made in Atar and well known in Mauritania. It&#x27;s a leather sole with straps.

==Military==

In 2012, an air force school was founded in Atar to train pilots and crew for the Military of Mauritania.

==Notable people==
*Med Hondo - film director (1936–2019)
*Maaouya Ould Sid&#x27;Ahmed Taya - 5th President of Mauritania (born 1941)

<doc id="1273369" wikidata="Q343587" url="?curid=1273369" title="Action! (programming language)">
<text>Action! is a procedural programming language and integrated development environment written by Clinton Parker for the Atari 8-bit computers. The language, which is similar to ALGOL, compiles to high-performance code for the MOS Technology 6502 of the Atari computers. Action! was distributed on ROM cartridge by Optimized Systems Software starting in 1983. It was one of the company&#x27;s first bank-switched 16 kB &quot;Super Cartridges&quot;. The runtime library is stored in the cartridge; to make a standalone application requires the Action! Toolkit which was sold separately by OSS.

Parker, working with Henry Baker, had previously developed Micro-SPL, a systems programming language for the Xerox Alto. Action! is largely a port of Micro-SPL concepts to the Atari with changes to support the 6502 processor and the addition of an integrated fullscreen editor and debugger.

Action! was used to develop at least two commercial products—the &quot;HomePak&quot; productivity suite and &quot;Games Computers Play&quot; client program—and numerous programs in &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot; and &quot;Antic&quot; magazines. The editor inspired the PaperClip word processor. The language was not ported to other platforms.

The assembly language source code for Action! was made available under the GNU General Public License by the author in 2015.

==Development environment==
Action! is one of the earlier examples of the OSS SuperCartridge format. Although ROM cartridges for the Atari could support 16 kB, OSS opted for bank-switching 16 kB, organized as four 4 kB blocks, mapped onto 8kB of address space. The lower 4 kB did not change, and system could bank switch between the other three blocks by changing the value in address $AFFF. This allowed for more RAM available for user programs.

Action! used this design by breaking the system into four sections, the editor, the compiler, a monitor for testing code and switching between the editor and compiler, and the run-time library. The run-time library is stored in the cartridge itself. To distribute standalone applications requires a separate run-time package which was sold by OSS as the Action! Toolkit.

Action! constructs were designed to map cleanly to 6502 opcodes, to provide high performance without needing complex optimizations in the one-pass compiler. For example, local variables are assigned fixed addresses in memory, instead of being allocated on a stack of activation records. This eliminates the significant overhead associated with stack management, which is especially difficult in the case of the 6502&#x27;s 256-byte stack. However, this precludes the use of recursion.

Unlike the integrated Atari BASIC and Atari Assembler Editor environments, the Action! editor does not use line numbers. It has a fullscreen, scrolling display capable of displaying two windows, and includes block operations and global search and replace.

The monitor serves as a debugger, allowing an entire program or individual functions to be run, memory to be displayed and modified, and program execution to be traced.

== Language ==
=== Data types ===
Action! has three fundamental data types, all of which are numeric.

BYTE is internally represented as an unsigned 8-bit integer. Values range from 0 to 255.&lt;br&gt;
The CHAR keyword can also be used to declare BYTE variables.

 BYTE age=[21] ; declare age and initialize it to the value 21
 BYTE leftMargin=82 ; declare leftMargin at address 82

CARDinal is internally represented as an unsigned 16-bit integer. Values range from 0 to 65,535.

 CARD population=$600 ; declare population and store it at address 1536 and 1537
 CARD prevYear, curYear, nextYear ; use commas to declare multiple variables

INTeger is internally represented as a signed 16-bit integer. Values range from -32,768 to 32,767.

 INT veryCold = [-10]
 INT profitsQ1, profitsQ2, ; declaring multiple variables can 
 profitsQ3, profitsQ4 ; span across multiple lines

Action! also has ARRAYs, POINTERs and user-defined TYPEs. No floating point support is provided.

An example of a user-defined TYPE:

 TYPE CORD=[CARD x,y]
 CORD point
 point.x=42
 point.y=23

=== Reserved words ===
A reserved word is any identifier or symbol that the Action! compiler recognizes as something special. It can be an operator, a data type name, a statement, or a compiler directive.

 AND FI OR UNTIL = (
 ARRAY FOR POINTER WHILE &lt;&gt; )
 BYTE FUNC PROC XOR # .
 CARD IF RETURN + &gt; [
 CHAR INCLUDE RSH - &gt;= ]
 DEFINE INT SET * &lt; &quot;
 DO LSH STEP / &lt;= &#x27;
 ELSE MOD THEN &amp; $ ;
 ELSEIF MODULE TO % ^
 EXIT OD TYPE ! @

=== Example code ===
The following is example code for Sieve of Eratosthenes written in Action!. In order to increase performance, it disables the ANTIC graphics coprocessor, preventing its DMA engine from &quot;stealing&quot; CPU cycles during computation.

 BYTE RTCLOK=20, ; addr of sys timer
 SDMCTL=559 ; DMA control
 BYTE ARRAY FLAGS(8190)
 CARD COUNT,I,K,PRIME,TIME
 PROC SIEVE()
 SDMCTL=0 ; shut off Antic
 RTCLOK=0 ; reset the clock to zero
 COUNT=0 ; init count
 FOR I=0 TO 8190 ; and flags
 DO
 FLAGS(I)=&#x27;T ; &quot;&#x27;T&quot; is a compiler-provided constant for True
 OD
 FOR I=0 TO 8190 ; now run the sieve
 DO
 IF FLAGS(I)=&#x27;T THEN
 PRIME=I+I+3
 K=I+PRIME
 WHILE K&lt;=8190
 DO
 FLAGS(K)=&#x27;F ; &quot;&#x27;F&quot; is a compiler-provided constant for False
 K==+PRIME
 OD
 COUNT==+1
 FI
 OD
 TIME=RTCLOK ; get timer reading
 SDMCTL=34 ; restore screen
 PRINTF(&quot;%E %U PRIMES IN&quot;,COUNT)
 PRINTF(&quot;%E %U JIFFIES&quot;,TIME)
 RETURN

==History==
===Micro-SPL===
While taking his postgraduate studies, Parker started working part-time at Xerox PARC working on printer drivers. He later moved to the Xerox Alto project where he wrote several games for the system. His PhD was in natural language parsing and he had worked on compiler theory during his graduate work.

Henry Baker and Parker released Micro-SPL in September 1979. Micro-SPL was intended to be used as a systems programming language on the Xerox Alto workstation computer, which was normally programmed in BCPL. The Alto used a microcode system which the BCPL compiler output. Micro-SPL output the same format, allowing BCPL programs to call Micro-SPL programs.

Aside from differences in syntax, the main difference between Micro-SPL and BCPL, and the reason for its existence, was that Micro-SPL produced code that was many times faster than the native BCPL compiler. In general, Micro-SPL programs were expected to run about ten times as fast as BCPL, and about half as fast as good hand-written microcode. In comparison to microcode, they claimed it would take half as long to write and 10% of the time to debug it.

===Action!===
It was during this period that Parker purchased an Atari computer for use at home. He was disappointed with the lack of development systems for it, which was the impetus for creating Action! Parker considered releasing the system himself, but decided to partner with Optimized Systems Software (OSS) for sales and distribution. OSS focused on utilities and programming languages like BASIC XL, so this was a natural fit for Action! Sales were strong enough for Parker to make a living off the royalties for several years.

The IBM PC had C compilers available, and Parker decided there was no point in porting Action! to that platform. As the sales of the Atari 8-bit computers wound down in North America, OSS wound down as well. Late in its history Action! distribution moved from OSS to Electronic Arts, but they did little with the language and sales ended shortly after. In a 2015 interview, Parker expressed his surprise in the level of interest in the language continued to receive, suggesting it was greater than it had been in the late 1980s.

==Reception==
Brian Moriarty, in a February 1984 review for &quot;ANALOG Computing&quot;, concluded that Action! was &quot;one of the most valuable development tools ever published for the Atari.&quot; He cited the manual as the only weak point of the package, claiming it &quot;suffers from lack of confidence, uncertain organization and a shortage of good, hard technical data.&quot;

Leo Laporte reviewed Action in the May/June 1984 edition of &quot;Hi-Res&quot;. He began the review, &quot;This is the best thing to happen to Atari since Nolan Bushnell figured out people would play ping-pong on a TV screen.&quot; Laporte praised the editor, noting its split-screen and cut and paste capabilities and describing it as a &quot;complete word processing system that&#x27;s very responsive.&quot; He said that Action! ran about 200 times as fast as Atari BASIC, concluding that &quot;This language is like a finely tuned racing car.&quot;

&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1985 praised the compilation and execution speed of software written in Action!. Using the Byte Sieve benchmark as a test, ten iterations of the sieve completed in 18 seconds in Action!, compared to 10 seconds for assembly and 38 minutes in BASIC. The magazine also lauded the language&#x27;s editor. &quot;BYTE&quot; reported that the language resembled C closely enough to &quot;routinely convert programs between the two&quot;, and approved of its pointer support. The magazine concluded that &quot;Action! is easy to use, quick, and efficient. It can exploit the Atari&#x27;s full power. Action! puts programming for the Atari in a whole new dimension&quot;.

Ian Chadwick wrote in &quot;Mapping the Atari&quot; that &quot;Action! is probably the best language yet for the Atari; it&#x27;s a bit like C and Pascal, with a dash of Forth. I recommend it.&quot;

<doc id="1273370" wikidata="Q163271" url="?curid=1273370" title="Kherson Oblast">
<text>Kherson Oblast (, ; ), also known as Khersonshchyna (, ), is an oblast (province) in southern Ukraine. It is located just north of Crimea. Its administrative center is Kherson, on the northern or right bank of the Dnieper river, which bisects the oblast. The oblast has an area of 28,461 km2 and a population of It is considered the &#x27;fruit basket&#x27; of the country, as much of its agricultural production is dispersed throughout the country, with production peaking during the summer months.

Most of the area of the oblast has been under Russian military occupation since early in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 30 September 2022, Russia claimed to annex Kherson Oblast, along with the Donetsk (Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic), Luhansk (Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic) and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, but the referendums and subsequent claimed annexations are internationally unrecognized. Ukraine recaptured the whole area on the right bank of the Dnieper, including Kherson city, by mid-November 2022, in the Kherson counteroffensive.

==History==

Historically, at various times, the territory was ruled either entirely or partly by Scythia, ancient Greeks, Old Great Bulgaria, Khazars, Kipchaks, the Byzantine Empire, Kyivan Rus&#x27;, Italians, the Mongol Empire, Lithuania, the Crimean Khanate, the Ottoman Empire, Poland and Russia. Medieval towns of greatest importance were the former Byzantine, Kyivan Rus&#x27; and Genoese trading port of Oleshia and former Lithuanian customs point and Polish and Turkish fortress of Tawan/Kazikermen, now Beryslav. Another notable town in the early modern period was &quot;Bilchowisce&quot;, now Kherson.

In 1917–1920 the territory at various times passed between the Ukrainians, Bolsheviks and White Russians, decisively becoming part Soviet Ukraine in 1920. It was the scene of Soviet genocidal crimes, chiefly the Holodomor of 1932–1933 and part of the Katyn massacre of 1940. During World War II, it was occupied by Germany from 1941 to 1944.

The province was established in 1944 within Soviet Ukraine.

In the 1991 Ukrainian independence referendum, 90.13% of votes in Kherson Oblast were in favor of the Declaration of Independence of Ukraine.

A survey conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in December 2014 found that 90.9% of the oblast&#x27;s population opposed their region joining Russia, 1% supported the idea, and the rest were undecided or did not respond.

=== Russian invasion ===

Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February 2022, Russian forces have occupied most of the oblast, with government by the &quot;Kherson military–civilian administration&quot; from 28 April to 30 September 2022.

On 27 July 2022, the Ukrainian army destroyed the Antonivka Road Bridge as part of its wider campaign to isolate the Russian 49th Combined Arms Army on the right bank of the Dnieper river. On 31 August, it was reported that the defenders of the occupied Kherson territory were the 49th Combined Arms Army and what was left of the 35th Combined Arms Army.

On 5 September it was announced that the newly-installed Russian administration had postponed its plans to hold a referendum on the planned secession from Ukraine. The plebiscite had been scheduled to occur on 11 September, in order to coincide with the Russian electoral calendar. Due to the contestation of the oblast by the Ukrainian forces, it was found to be impractical to hold at this time. 

On 23–27 September 2022, the Russian Federation held referendums in the occupied territories of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts for &quot;independence and subsequent entry into the Russian Federation&quot;, recognized by most states to be staged and against international law.

On 29 September, the Russian Federation recognized Kherson Oblast as an independent state. On 30 September, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of the Kherson Oblast and three other Ukrainian territories, and signed &quot;accession decrees&quot; that are widely considered to be illegal. At that time, Russia was not in control of the province as a whole. 

The United Nations General Assembly subsequently passed a resolution calling on countries not to recognise what it described as an &quot;attempted illegal annexation&quot; and demanded that Russia &quot;immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw&quot;.

On 9 November 2022, the city of Kherson and a remaining pocket of land on the right bank of the Dnieper were recaptured by Ukrainian forces. The territory on the left bank is still under Russian control.

On 6 June 2023, the Kakhovka Dam was breached, causing extensive flooding downstream and prompting mass evacuations in the oblast, while the Kakhovka Reservoir was drained.

Russian authorities claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin won 88.12% of the vote in the occupied Kherson region in the 2024 Russian presidential election, which has been described as rigged and fraudulent.

==Geography==
Kherson Oblast is bordered by Dnipropetrovsk Oblast to the north, the Black Sea and Crimea to the south, Mykolaiv Oblast to the west, and the Azov Sea and Zaporizhzhia Oblast to the east. The Dnieper River, which includes the Kakhovka Reservoir, runs through the oblast.

Before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, two bridges spanned the Dniper: the Khakovsky Bridge near Nova Kakhovka and the Antonivka Road Bridge at Kherson. Another significant bridge, the Daryivka Bridge crosses the Inhulets river and connects Kherson via the M14 highway to Beryslav, the other abutment of the Khakovsky Bridge.

The oblast&#x27;s Henichesk Raion includes the northern portion of the Arabat Spit, a thin strip of land between the brackish Syvash and the Sea of Azov that is geographically part of the Crimean Peninsula. Due to Russia gaining &quot;de facto&quot; control of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in 2014, this strip within Kherson Oblast was the only part of the Crimean Peninsula under Ukrainian control immediately prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Historically, it is located in Yedisan (north-western part), Zaporizhzhia (northern part) and Pryazovia (southern and eastern parts).

Kherson is the only city with a population over 100,000. Four other cities have over 30,000 – they are, in order from largest, Nova Kakhovka, Kakhovka, Oleshky and Henichesk.

==Administrative divisions==
Until the 2020 re-organisation, the Kherson Oblast was administratively subdivided into 18 &quot;raions&quot; (districts) and 3 municipalities. The municipalities – Kherson (administrative center of the oblast), Nova Kakhovka, and Kakhovka – were directly subordinate to the oblast government. The Kherson municipality was subdivided into 3 urban districts. All information below was current as of 2015.

.* Note: Though the administrative center of the raion is housed in the city/town that it is named after, cities do not answer to the raion authorities only towns do; instead they are directly subordinated to the oblast government and therefore are not counted as part of raion statistics.

At a lower level of administration, these district-level administrations are subdivided into:
* Settlements – 697, including:
** Villages – 658; – &quot;See List of villages in Kherson Oblast&quot;
** Cities/Urban-type settlements – 36, including:
*** Cities of raion subordinance – 4 (Beryslav, Henichesk, Skadovsk, Tavriisk, and Oleshky);
*** Urban-type settlement – 30;
* Selsovets – 260.

The local administration of the oblast is controlled by the Kherson Regional Council. The governor of the oblast is the Kherson Regional Council speaker, appointed by the President of Ukraine.

==Demographics==

The population of the oblast is 1,083,367 (2012), which is 2.4% of the total population of Ukraine. It is also ranked 21st by its population. The population density is 38 per km2.

About 61.5% or 745,400 people live in urban areas of the Oblast and 38.5% or 467,600 people live in agricultural centers/villages. Men make up 46.7% or 565,400 people of the population, women make up 53.3% or 644,600 people, and pensioners make up 26.2% or 317,400 people of the Oblast population.

* Ukrainians – 82.0%
* Russians – 14.1%
* Belarusians – 0.7%
* Meskhetian Turks – 0.5%
* Crimean Tatars – 0.5%

<text>The Adrar (, Berber for &quot;mountain&quot;) is a highland natural and historical region of the Sahara Desert in northern Mauritania. The Adrar Region, an administrative division of Mauritania, is named after the traditional region. It is sometimes called Adrar Tamar to distinguish it from other areas called Adrar in the Sahara.

==Geography==
The Adrar is an arid plateau, known for its gorges, regs (stony deserts) and sand dunes. Structurally the Adrar is a low central massif which rises to over above sea level just east of Atar near the Amojjar Pass on the track to Chinguetti, then loses elevation and becomes subsumed by dunes to the south and east. Limited cultivation is only possible in the gorges at lower elevations such like oued Seguellil, where the water table is high enough to support large palm groves.

Features include the Oued el Abiod or &#x27;White Valley&#x27;, a dune-filled fault line along which many small settlements and palm groves are found. The Guelb Aouelloul crater is 3.1 million-old impact crater which was studied by the noted Saharan scholar Théodore Monod. To the east beyond Ouadane is the distinctive Richat Structure, an uplifted and then heavily eroded dome of strata approximately 40 km across and whose concentric rings resemble an impact crater when observed from space.

The Adrar region is home to a small human population, centered on the town of Atar. The ancient town of Ouadane, formerly an important caravan and gold-trading center, is located towards the eastern edge of the Adrar. Chinguetti is another important historical town in the region.

==History==
The Adrar was settled in the Neolithic era as shown by cave and rock paintings found in the area such as the Agrour Amogjar. The more recent aridification has left much of the archaeology intact, most notable several stone circles, e.g. Atar Stone Circle, and the later town of Azougui.

Beginning in the mid-17th century, migrants from the Adrar Plateau region moved into the Tagant Plateau and displaced the native population.

<text>Neurotmesis (in Greek tmesis signifies &quot;to cut&quot;) is part of Seddon&#x27;s classification scheme used to classify nerve damage. It is the most serious nerve injury in the scheme. In this type of injury, both the nerve and the nerve sheath are disrupted. While partial recovery may occur, complete recovery is impossible.

==Symptoms==
Symptoms of neurotmesis include but are not limited to pain, dysesthesias (uncomfortable sensations), and complete loss of sensory and motor function of the affected nerve.

==Anatomy==
Neurotmesis occurs in the peripheral nervous system and most often in the upper-limb (arms), accounting for 73.5% of all peripheral nerve injury cases. Of these cases, the ulnar nerve was most often injured. Peripheral nerves are structured so that the axons are surrounded by most often a myelinated sheath and then an endoneurium. A perineurium surrounds that and the outermost layer is considered the epineurium. When injury occurs, &quot;local vascular trauma leads to hemorrhage and edema (swelling), which results in vigorous inflammatory response resulting in scarring of the injured segment. In most cases, due to the extreme nature of the injury, there is typically complete loss of function.

==Mechanisms ==
Trauma is the most frequent cause of peripheral nerve lesions. There are two classifications of trauma which include civilian trauma and military trauma. Civilian trauma is most commonly caused by motor vehicle accidents but also by lacerations caused by glass, knives, fans, saw blades or fractures and occasionally sports injuries. Of the civilian injuries, stretch injuries are the most common types and are considered to be a closed injury, where the tissue is unexposed. Stretch injures are commonly the result of dislocation, such as a shoulder dislocation that stretches nerves. Opposite of civilian trauma, there is military trauma which most commonly results in open injuries from blasts often by bombs or improvised explosive devices. Other mechanisms of injury are less common but include ischemia, thermal, electric shock, radiation, adverse reactions to certain chemotherapy medications, percussion and vibration.

==Diagnosis==
With Seddon&#x27;s classification of nerve injuries, it is often tough to identify whether a particular nerve injury is neurotmesis, or axonotmesis, which has damage to the nerve fibres but preservation of the nerve trunk. Due to the damage involved in both of these conditions they will both show paralysis of muscles that are supplied by nerves below the site of the lesion, and will have sensory deficits in accordance with the individual nerves that are damaged. The only way to know for sure if a nerve injury is in fact neurotmesis is to allow for the normal progression of nerve regeneration to take place (nerves regenerate at a rate of approximately 2–4 mm/day proximal to the lesion), and if, after that time, there is still profound muscle paralysis and degeneration in these areas, then it is likely to have been a neurotmesis injury.

Neurotmesis is diagnosed through clinical evaluation of symptoms, physical evaluation, and other diagnostic studies. Patients often undergo a series of muscle strength tests, sensory exam which includes feeling the sensation of light touch, pinprick, vibration, and others. Other tests involved with diagnosis of nerve injury are electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS). These help to distinguish upper from lower motor neuron disorder as well as diagnose primary muscle disease.

===Classification===
Peripheral nerve injuries can be classified in two different ways. Neurotmesis is classified under the Seddon system which is defined by three grades of nerve injury. The mildest grade is referred to as neurapraxia and is characterized by a reduction or complete blockage of conduction across a segment of nerve while axonal continuity is maintained and nerve conduction is preserved. These injuries are almost always reversed and a recovery takes place within days or weeks. The second classification of the Seddon system is referred to as axonotmesis which is a more severe case of peripheral nerve injury. Axonotmesis is classified by an interruption of the axons, but a preservation of the surrounding connective tissues around the axon. These injuries can heal themselves at about 1mm/day, therefore resulting in recovery to be possible but at a slower rate than neurapraxia. The last and most severe case of peripheral nerve injury is known as neurotmesis, which in most cases cannot be completely recovered from even with surgical repair.

The second classification of nerve injury is known as the Sunderland classification which is more complex and specific. This classification uses five different degrees of nerve injury, the first one being the least severe and the equivalent to neurapraxia and the most severe being the fifth degree and having the same classification as neurotmesis. The second through fourth degrees are dependent on the variance of axon discontinuity and are classified under Seddon&#x27;s classification of axonotmesis.

==Treatment==
The first line of treatment is often to treat the patient&#x27;s pain with neuropathic drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and anticonvulsants. The second lines of drugs to treat pain are non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, tramadol, and opioids. Other techniques used to facilitate healing of the nerve and pain are either static or dynamic splinting that can both help protect the injured part as well as improve function. Sometimes surgery is an option, although the prognosis is still very poor of regaining function of the affected nerve. The goal of surgery is to join healthy nerve to unhealthy nerve. The most common surgical techniques include external neurolysis, end-to-end repair, nerve grafting, and nerve transfer from somewhere else in the body.

==Prognosis==
People with neurotmesis often face a poor prognosis. They will more than likely never regain full functionality of the affected nerve, but surgical techniques do give people a better chance at regaining some function. Current research is focused on new ways to regenerate nerves and advance surgical techniques.

<text>Axonotmesis is an injury to the peripheral nerve of one of the extremities of the body. The axons and their myelin sheath are damaged in this kind of injury, but the endoneurium, perineurium and epineurium remain intact. Motor and sensory functions distal to the point of injury are completely lost over time leading to Wallerian degeneration due to ischemia, or loss of blood supply. Axonotmesis is usually the result of a more severe crush or contusion than neurapraxia.

Axonotmesis mainly follows a stretch injury. These stretch injuries can either dislocate joints or fracture a limb, due to which peripheral nerves are severed. If the sharp pain from the exposed axon of the nerve is not observed, one can identify a nerve injury from abnormal sensations in their limb. A doctor may ask for a nerve conduction velocity (NCV) test to completely diagnose the issue. If diagnosed as nerve injury, electromyography performed after 3 to 4 weeks shows signs of denervations and fibrillations, or irregular connections and contractions of muscles.

== Injury classification ==
There are two kinds of nerve injury classifications:
=== Sunderland&#x27;s Stage II classification ===

* Endoneurial tube remains intact
* Emergence of Wallerian degeneration
* Can be detected with Tinel&#x27;s sign
=== Sunderland&#x27;s Stage III classification ===

* Endoneurial tube is damaged
* Perineurium remains intact
* Scarring occurs
* Intrafascicular fibrosis occurs due to edema

=== Sunderland&#x27;s Stage IV classification ===

* Perineurium is damaged
* Epineurium remains intact
* Neuroma could occur
* Surgery is required for treatment

==Assessment==
A nerve contains sensory fibers, motor fibers, or both. Sensory fibers lesions cause the sensory problems below to the site of injury. Motor fibers injuries may involve lower motor neurons, sympathetic fibers, and or both.

Assessment items include:
* Sensory fibers that send sensory information to the central nervous system.
* Motor fibers that allow movement of skeletal muscle.
* Sympathetic fibers that innervate the skin and blood vessels of the four extremities.

In assessment, sensory-motor defects may be mild, moderate, or severe. Damage to motor fibers results in paralysis of the muscles. Nervous plexus injuries create more signs and symptoms from sensory-motor problems (such as brachial plexus injuries). In these cases, the prognosis depends on the amount of damage and the degree of functional impairment.

==EMG and NCV findings==

=== Changes in EMG ===

Electromyography (EMG) is a medical test performed to evaluate and record the electrical activity (electromyogram) produced by skeletal muscles using an instrument called electromyograph. In axonotmesis, EMG changes (2 to 3 weeks after injury) in the denervated muscles include:
# Fibrillation potentials (FP)
# Positive sharp waves

=== Changes in NCV (nerve conduction velocity) ===

EMG test is often performed together with another test called nerve conduction study, which measures the conducting function of nerves. NCV study shows loss of nerve conduction in the distal segment (3 to 4 days after injury). According to NCV study, in axonotmesis there is an absence of distal sensory-motor responses.

==Treatment==
Schwann cells provide the nerve with protection through the production of Nerve Growth Factors, and because these cells are intact this kind of nerve injury can be cured and normal feeling and sensations can be restored. Surgery can be done in order to help the nerve heal. The surgery will help with nerve regeneration, providing guidance to the nerve sprouts on where to attach on the proximal side of the injury. Damaged nerve axons can reattach themselves after surgery. Treatment of axonotmesis also consists of:
* Physical therapy or Occupational Therapy. Physical or Occupational therapy aims include:
** Pain relief
** Maintain range of motion
** Reducing muscular atrophy
** Patient education
* Use of assistive devices (Orthotic needs)

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is usually good in terms of recovery. Rate of recovery depends on the distance from the site of injury, and axonal regeneration can go up to 1 inch per month. Complete recovery can take anywhere from 6 months to a year.

<doc id="1273375" wikidata="Q544302" url="?curid=1273375" title="Neurapraxia">
<text>Neurapraxia is a disorder of the peripheral nervous system in which there is a temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, usually lasting an average of six to eight weeks before full recovery. Neurapraxia is derived from the word apraxia, meaning “loss or impairment of the ability to execute complex coordinated movements without muscular or sensory impairment”.

This condition is typically caused by a blunt neural injury due to external blows or shock-like injuries to muscle fibers and skeletal nerve fibers, which leads to repeated or prolonged pressure buildup on the nerve. As a result of this pressure, ischemia occurs, a neural lesion results, and the human body naturally responds with edema extending in all directions from the source of the pressure. This lesion causes a complete or partial action potential conduction block over a segment of a nerve fiber and thus a reduction or loss of function in parts of the neural connection downstream from the lesion, leading to muscle weakness.

Neurapraxia results in temporary damage to the myelin sheath but leaves the nerve intact and is an impermanent condition; thus, Wallerian degeneration does not occur in neurapraxia. In order for the condition to be considered neurapraxia, according to the Seddon classification system of peripheral nerve injury, there must be a complete and relatively rapid recovery of motor and sensory function once nerve conduction has been restored; otherwise, the injury would be classified as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Thus, neurapraxia is the mildest classification of peripheral nerve injury.

Neurapraxia is very common in professional athletes, especially American football players, and is a condition that can and should be treated by a physician.

==Signs and symptoms==
A variety of nerve types can be subjected to neurapraxia and therefore symptoms of the injury range in degree and intensity. Common symptoms of neurapraxia are disturbances in sensation, weakness of muscle, vasomotor and sudomotor paralysis in the region of the affected nerve or nerves, and abnormal sensitivity of the nerve at the point of injury. It has been observed that subjective sensory symptoms include numbness, tingling, and burning sensations at the site of the injury. Objective sensory symptoms are generally minimal in regards to touch, pain, heat, and cold. In cases of motor neuron neurapraxia, symptoms consist of flaccid paralysis of the muscles innervated by the injured nerve or nerves.
Symptoms are often transient and only last for a short period of time immediately following the injury. However, in severe cases of neurapraxia, symptoms can persist for weeks or months at a time.

==Causes==
The cause of neurapraxia is a neural lesion which causes a temporary block of nerve conduction without transection of the axon. A conduction block is classified as a 40% reduction in action potential amplitude over a short distance on the nerve, or a 50% reduction for a longer distance on the nerve. In neurapraxia, stimulation to the injured nerve results in a greater reduction in the action potential amplitude on the proximal site of the injury as opposed to the distal site.

==Anatomy==
Neurapraxia occurs in the peripheral nervous system typically in the ulnar, median, and radial nerves of the upper body and in the sciatic and peroneal nerves of the lower body. Peripheral nerves are myelinated, relatively large, spatially complex cells whose size and connectivity typically make them more susceptible to damage and compromise their capacity to self-repair, although this is not the case in neurapraxia. Microscopic evidence has shown that there is damage to the myelin sheath, but not to the axon. Therefore, distal nerve fibers do not degenerate and the myelin damage can be repaired.

=== Order of pathology ===
The order of pathology within the first 24 hours after injury follows a general pattern of nerve injury. The first physical manifestation of the injury is focal swelling adjacent to the site of the injury. In the cellular dimension, a fragmentation of neurotubules and neurofilaments occurs as a result of pressure exerted on the nerve. Axons swell at some sites and are compressed at others, leading to a beaded appearance.

=== Mechanisms of injury ===
There are several mechanisms of nerve injury including mechanical lesions, ischemia, immunologic attack, metabolic disorder, toxic agents, and exposure to radiation. The most common mechanism of injury is nerve compression in which external pressure causes decreased blood flow to the nerve and deformation of the nerve fibers. Repeated or prolonged compression of the nerve results in ischemia and ultimately edema above and below the source of the pressure (I). The thinning of myelin sheaths or focal demyelination are the main consequences of the injury that lead to conduction blockage.

==Diagnosis==
=== Seddon classification ===
There are three distinct classifications and degrees of nerve injury:
*Neurotmesis is the most serious degree of nerve injury. It involves the disruption of the nerve and the nerve sheath.
*Axonotmesis occurs when the majority of the supporting structures of the nerve are preserved, but disruption of the nerve fibers is still observed. Wallerian degeneration often occurs in the near the proximity of the injury site.
*Neurapraxia is least serious form of nerve injury.

There are two different forms of mechanical nerve injury involving neurapraxia. The underlying causes of transient nerve injury typically include a brief ischemic episode or any form of compression. More persistent forms of nerve injury involve demyelination and axonal constriction. In certain circumstances, diagnosing neurapraxia can be uncomfortable because of the presence of severe neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is an indication that the lesion of the nerve is still in progress. Diagnosis of neurapraxia is almost always followed by a quick and complete recovery period.

==Treatment and recovery==
The entire nerve is involved in the response to traumatic injuries. The outcome of nerve repair is dependent on the degree of the nerve injury and the circumstances at the site of injury. Since neurapraxia is the least serious form of peripheral nerve injury, recovery and treatment are not extensive. Once the cause of neurapraxia is eliminated, recovery of the lesions in the nerve occurs within a short time span.

=== Non-operative treatment ===
Neurapraxia is often treated and cured by non-operative means. The primary goals of treatment are to maintain the proper nutrition of the paralyzed muscles, prevent contraction by the antagonists of the paralyzed muscles, and to consistently keep the joints mobile. A splint is often used in cases of neurapraxia because it is able to maintain a relaxed position of the paralyzed muscle. The splint prevents the paralyzed muscle from being overstretched either by the force of gravity or by other non-paralyzed antagonists. During the recovery period of neurapraxia, it is essential that the joints constantly undergo passive movement in order to preserve proper mobility. If joints are kept mobile, the limb has the best possible chance of benefit from the return of nervous function. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications can also help to reduce swelling at the injury site. In addition to these non-operative remedies, it is suggested that muscles affected by neurapraxia be kept warm at all times. Circulation in the limb is stimulated with the use of heat. 
Once voluntary movement has returned to the muscle, recovery and treatment continues by the participation in active exercises. Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy are common sources of treatment during these early stages of restoration of active movement. Almost all cases of neurapraxia can be completely treated by non-operative means.

=== Treating cervical cord neurapraxia on the field ===
According to medical professionals with the Cleveland Clinic, once an athlete suffers from an episode of cervical spinal cord neurapraxia, team physician or athletic trainer first stabilize the head and neck followed by a thorough neurologic inspection. If the injury is deemed severe, injured parties should be taken to a hospital for evaluation. Athletes that suffer from severe episodes of neurapraxia are urged to consult orthopaedic or spinal medical specialists. In mild cases of neurapraxia, the athlete is able to remove themselves from the field of play. However, the athlete is still advised to seek medical consultation.

==Prognosis==
In cases of neurapraxia, the function of the nerves are temporarily impaired. However, the prognosis for recovery from neurapraxia is efficient and quick. Recovery begins within two to three weeks after the injury occurs, and it is complete within six to eight weeks. There are instances when function is not completely restored until four months after the instance of injury. The recovery period of neurapraxia is not an entirely ordered process, but the recovery is always complete and fast.

==Epidemiology==
Neurapraxia is most commonly observed in athletes involved in collision sports, such as American football. Athletes participating in collision sports most often suffer from cervical cord neurapraxia, also known as transient neurapraxia. Cervical cord neurapraxia is the result of a severe collision in which a blow to the crown of the athlete&#x27;s head forcefully extends or compresses the neck. Numbness, stinging, and/or weakness in the arms, legs or both, distinguish cervical cord neurapraxia. Typical episodes of transient neurapraxia only last a few seconds and symptoms dissipate entirely. Though the severity of the injury can range, transient neurapraxia does not lead to permanent paralysis of the affected muscles. Subsequent spinal cord injury after an episode of cervical cord neurapraxia has not been observed. However, athletes who experience an episode of transient cervical neurapraxia face an approximately 50% chance of a repeat episode if they continue to participate in collision sports.

=== American football ===

Cervical cord neurapraxia among American football players is commonly observed in athletes playing positions involving high-speed collisions and open-field tackling. Cases of neurapraxia in the National Football League were first described in 1986 by Joseph Torg, M.D., founder of the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry (established in 1975). As a result of Dr. Torg&#x27;s findings the NFL as well as other levels of American football have outlawed the act of spearing, or the lowering of the head and hitting an opponent with the crown of the helmet. The cervical spine cannot properly absorb the force of a collision when the head is even slightly lowered as is the case in spearing. In addition to outlawing acts such as spearing, prevention of neurapraxia on the football field relies on instruction and reinforcement of proper tackling technique by coaches and trainers.

==In popular culture==

In &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; Season 4 Episode one, Benjamin &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Pierce claims that Walter &quot;Radar&quot; O&#x27;Reilly has neurapraxia as an excuse for driving past a military checkpoint. Hawkeye lies about the causes and treatments to keep them from getting into trouble. When questioned by Radar if it was a real disease, he answered &quot;Yes, but only people that bite their nails can get it&quot; (which Radar was currently doing).

<text>The Italian railway system is one of the most important parts of the infrastructure of Italy, with a total length of of which active lines are . The network has recently grown with the construction of the new high-speed rail network. Italy is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC). The UIC Country Code for Italy is 83.

==The network==
&quot;RFI&quot; (&quot;Rete Ferroviaria Italiana&quot;, Italian Rail Network), a state owned infrastructure manager which administers most of the Italian rail infrastructure. The Italian railway system has a length of , of which standard gauge. The active lines are , of which are double tracks. Italy has 2,507 people and 12.46 km2 per kilometre of rail track, giving Italy the world&#x27;s 13th-largest rail network.

Lines are divided into 3 categories: 
*&quot;fundamental lines&quot; (&quot;fondamentali&quot;), which have high traffic and good infrastructure quality, comprise all the main lines between major cities throughout the country. Fundamental lines are long;
*&quot;complementary lines&quot; (&quot;complementari&quot;), which have less traffic and are responsible for connecting medium or small regional centres. Most of these lines are single track and some are not electrified;
*&quot;node lines&quot; (&quot;di nodo&quot;), which link complementary and fundamental lines near metropolitan areas for a total .

Most of the Italian network is electrified (). The electric system is 3 kV DC on conventional lines and 25 kV AC on high-speed lines.

A major part of the Italian rail network is managed and operated by &quot;RFI&quot; (&quot;Rete Ferroviaria Italiana&quot;, Italian Rail Network). Other regional agencies, mostly owned by public entities such as regional governments, operate on the Italian network.

Travellers who often make use of the railway during their stay in Italy might use rail passes, such as the European Interrail / Eurail passes or Italy&#x27;s national and regional passes. These rail passes allow travellers the freedom to use regional trains during the validity period, but all high-speed and intercity trains require up to a 15-euro reservation fee. Regional passes, such as &quot;Io viaggio ovunque Lombardia&quot;, offer one-day, multiple-day and monthly periods of validity. There are also saver passes for adults, who travel as a group, with savings up to 20%. Foreign travellers should purchase these passes in advance so that the passes can be delivered by post prior to the trip. When using the rail passes, the date of travel needs to be filled in before boarding the trains.

== History ==


The first line to be built on the peninsula was the Naples–Portici line, in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, which was long and was inaugurated on 3 October 1839, nine years after the world&#x27;s first &quot;modern&quot; inter-city railway, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The following year the firm Holzhammer of Bolzano was granted the &quot;Imperial-Royal privilege&quot; to build the Milano–Monza line (), the second railway built in Italy, in the then Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, a part of the Austrian Empire.

After the creation of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, a project was started to build a network from the Alps to Sicily, in order to connect the country. After unification, construction of new lines was boosted: in 1875, with the completion of the section Orte-Orvieto, the direct Florence–Rome line was completed, reducing the travel time of the former route passing through Foligno-Terontola. Private companies were definitively bought back by the Italian state on 1 July 1905, with the creation of the Ferrovie dello Stato (State Railways), or FFSS, with a total of of lines, of which it already owned . The move was completed the following year with the acquisition of the remaining SFM network: by then FFSS possessed of lines, of which with double tracks.

The period from 1922 to 1939 was heavy with important construction and modernisation programmes for the Italian railways, which also incorporated from the &quot;Ferrovie Reali Sarde&quot; of Sardinia. The most important programme was that of the Rome–Naples and Bologna–Florence &quot;direttissimas&quot; (&quot;most direct lines&quot;): the first reduced the travel time from the two cities by an hour and a half; the second, announced proudly as &quot;constructing Fascism&quot;, included the second longest tunnel in the world at the time. Electrification on 3,000 V direct current was introduced, which later supplanted the existing three-phase system. Other improvements included automatic blocks, light signals, construction of numerous main stations (Milan Central, Napoli Mergellina, Roma Ostiense and others) and other technical modernisations. The first high-speed train was the Italian ETR 200, which in July 1939 went from Milan to Florence at , with a top speed of . With this service, the railway was able to compete with the upcoming aeroplanes. The Second World War stopped these services.

After World War II, Italy started to repair the damaged railways and built nearly of new tracks. Entire lines were out of action and much of the rolling stock was destroyed. Thanks to the Marshall Plan, in the following years they could be rebuilt, although the possibility of reorganizing the network was missed due to short-sighted policies. The main Battipaglia-Reggio Calabria line (running along the west coast) was doubled, while a program of updating of infrastructures, superstructures, services, colour-light signalling and cars was updated or extended. The three-phase lines were gradually turned into standard 3,000 V dc lines.

Increasing numbers of steam locomotives were replaced by electric or diesel ones; in the 1960s also the first unified passenger cars appeared and the first attempts of interoperability with foreign companies were started, culminating in the creation of Trans Europe Express services. Nowadays the rail tracks and infrastructure are managed by Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI), while the train and the passenger section is managed mostly by Trenitalia. Both are Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) subsidiaries, once the only train operator in Italy.

==High-speed rail==


The Italian high-speed service began in 1938 with an electric-multiple-unit ETR 200, designed for , between Bologna and Naples. It too reached in commercial service, and achieved a world mean speed record of between Florence and Milan in 1938.

High-speed trains were developed during the 1960s. E444 locomotives were the first standard locomotives capable of top speed of , while an ALe 601 electrical multiple unit (EMU) reached a speed of during a test. Other EMUs, such as the ETR 220, ETR 250 and ETR 300, were also updated for speeds up to . The braking systems of cars were updated to match the increased travelling speeds.

On 25 June 1970, work was started on the Rome–Florence &quot;Direttissima&quot;, the first high-speed line in Italy and in Europe. It included the bridge on the Paglia river, then the longest in Europe. Works were completed in the early 1990s.

In 1975, a program for a widespread updating of the rolling stock was launched. However, as it was decided to put more emphasis on local traffic, this caused a shifting of resources from the ongoing high-speed projects, with their subsequent slowing or, in some cases, total abandonment. Therefore, 160 E.656 electric and 35 D.345 locomotives for short-medium range traffic were acquired, together with 80 EMUs of the ALe 801/940 class, 120 ALn 668 diesel railcars. Some 1,000 much-needed passenger and 7,000 freight cars were also ordered.

In the 1990s, work started on the Treno Alta Velocità (&quot;TAV&quot;) project, which involved building a new high-speed network on the routes Milan – (Bologna–Florence–Rome–Naples) – Salerno, Turin – (Milan–Verona–Venice) – Trieste and Milan–Genoa. Most of the planned lines have already been opened, while international links with France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovenia are underway.

Most of the Rome–Naples line opened in December 2005, the Turin–Milan line partially opened in February 2006 and the Milan–Bologna line opened in December 2008. The remaining sections of the Rome–Naples and the Turin–Milan lines and the Bologna–Florence line were completed in December 2009. All these lines are designed for speeds up to . Since then, it is possible to travel from Turin to Salerno (ca. ) in less than 5 hours. More than 100 trains per day are operated.

Other proposed high-speed lines are Salerno-Reggio Calabria (connected to Sicily with the future bridge over the Strait of Messina), Palermo-Catania and Naples–Bari.

The main public operator of high-speed trains (&quot;alta velocità AV&quot;, formerly Eurostar Italia) is Trenitalia, part of FSI. Trains are divided into three categories (called &quot;Le Frecce&quot;): &quot;Frecciarossa&quot; (&quot;Red arrow&quot;) trains operate at a maximum of on dedicated high-speed tracks; &quot;Frecciargento&quot; (Silver arrow) trains operate at a maximum of on both high-speed and mainline tracks; &quot;Frecciabianca&quot; (White arrow) trains operate at a maximum of on mainline tracks only.

Since 2012, a new and Italy&#x27;s first private train operator, NTV (branded as Italo), run high-speed services in competition with Trenitalia. Even nowadays, Italy is the only country in Europe with a private high-speed train operator.

Construction of the Milan-Venice high-speed line began in 2013 and in December 2016 the Milan-Treviglio-Brescia section has been opened to passenger traffic; the Milan-Genoa high-speed line (Terzo Valico dei Giovi) is also under construction.

Today it is possible to travel from Rome to Milan in less than 3 hours (2h 55&#x27; without intermediate stops) with the Frecciarossa 1000, the new high-speed train. As of June 2024, there are 46 Trenitalia and 33 Italo round-trip high-speed trains every weekday that cover this route,

==Night trains==

The &quot;Nightjet&quot; of the Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) serves different major cities in Italy like Rome, Venice, Florence and Milano. The trains can be used for rides inside Italy as well as for journeys abroad.

&quot;Nightjet&quot; trains offer beds in sleeper carriages (Nightjet&#x27;s most comfortable service category), couchette carriages, and seated carriages. On certain connections, cars can also be transported on the train. Bikes can be transported in a bike transport bag, or on some connections also in special bike racks.

==Intercity trains==

With the introduction of high-speed trains, intercity trains are limited to a few services per day on mainline and regional tracks.

The daytime services (&quot;InterCity&quot; IC), while not frequent and limited to one or two trains per route, are essential in providing access to cities and towns off the railway&#x27;s mainline network. The main routes are Trieste to Rome (stopping at Venice, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Milan to Rome (stopping at Genoa, La Spezia, Pisa and Livorno / stopping at Parma, Modena, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Bologna to Lecce (stopping at Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Rome to Reggio di Calabria (stopping at Latina and Naples). In addition, the Intercity trains provide a more economical means of long-distance rail travel within Italy.

The night trains (&quot;Intercity Notte&quot; ICN) have sleeper compartments and washrooms, but no showers on board. The main routes are Rome to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Florence, Bologna, Verona, Rovereto and Trento), Milan to Lecce (calling at Piacenza, Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna, Faenza, Forlì, Cesena, Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi), Turin to Lecce (calling at Alessandria, Voghera, Piacenza, Parma, Bologna, Rimini, Pescara, Termoli, San Severo, Foggia, Barletta, Bisceglie, Molfetta, Bari, Monopoli, Fasano, Ostuni and Brindisi) and Reggio di Calabria to Turin (calling at Naples, Rome, Livorno, La Spezia and Genova). Most portions of these ICN services run during the night; since most services take 10 to 15 hours to complete a one-way journey, their daytime portion provides extra train connections to complement the Intercity services.

There are a total of 86 intercity trains running in Italy per day.

==Regional trains==

Trenitalia operates regional services (both fast &quot;veloce RV&quot; and stopping &quot;REG&quot;) throughout Italy.

Regional train agencies exist: their train schedules are largely connected to and shown on Trenitalia, and tickets for such train services can be purchased through Trenitalia&#x27;s national network. Other regional agencies have separate ticket systems which are not mutually exchangeable with that of Trenitalia. These &quot;regional&quot; tickets could be purchased at local newsagents or tobacco stores instead.

* Trentino-Alto Adige / : Südtirol Bahn () runs regional services on Ala/Ahl-am-Etsch to Bolzano/Bozen (calling at Rovereto/Rofreit, Trento/Trient and Mezzocorona/Kronmetz), Bolzano/Bozen to Merano/Meran, Bressanone/Brixen to San Candido/Innichen, and a direct &quot;Tirol regional express REX&quot; service between Bolzano/Bozen in Italy and Innsbruck in Austria.
* Veneto: Sistemi Territoriali runs regional trains in Veneto region.
* Lombardy: Trenord runs the Malpensa Express airport train, many Milan&#x27;s suburban lines and most regional train services in Lombardy. Trenord also co-operates with DB and ÖBB on the EuroCity Verona-Munich service, and with SBB CFF FFS (joint-venture TiLo) on the regional express and suburban trains between Lombardy and the towns of Canton of Ticino, such as Lugano, Locarno, Cadenazzo, Bellinzona and Mendrisio.
* Emilia-Romagna: Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna provides vital connections across cities on different mainline networks, including Modena, Parma, Suzzara, Ferrara, Reggio Emilia and Bologna.
* Tuscany: La Ferroviaria Italiana operates in Arezzo province.
* Abruzzo: Sangritana runs daily services between Pescara and Lanciano.

In addition to these agencies, there is a great deal of other little operators, such as AMT Genova for the Genova-Casella railway.

===Tram-train===


2 cities have tram-train system, Rome and Sassari. The Rome–Giardinetti railway connects Laziali (a regional train station some from Termini&#x27;s main concourse) with Giardinetti to the east just past the Grande Raccordo Anulare, Rome&#x27;s orbital motorway. It is run by ATAC, the company responsible for public transportation in the city, which also operates the Rome Metro. The present railway is the only part of the old and longer Rome–Fiuggi–Alatri–Frosinone railway to be in service. The latest shortening of the line occurred in 2008 with the closing of the Giardinetti–Pantano section, which has now become part of the Metro Line C. The line had been due to be dismantled in 2016 to be replaced with a bus lane along Via Casilina, but in March 2015 it was announced that the line would instead be retained and modernised.

Metrosassari, also called &quot;Sassari tramway&quot;, &quot;Sassari tram-train&quot; or &quot;Sassari metro-tramway&quot; ( or ) is the commercial name of a tram-train line in Sassari, Sardinia, Italy, operated by the regional public transport company &quot;ARST&quot; (&quot;Azienda Regionale Sarda Trasporti&quot;). Despite having been built in the early 2000s, in the urban section the line was built with single track and narrow gauge, to connect with the same gauge used in the secondary railway lines in Sardinia. The tramway part of the line (&quot;Stazione&quot; - &quot;Emiciclo Garibaldi&quot;) opened in October 2006, linking the railway station with the city centre via the hospital district. On 27 September 2009 the line was extended into the peripheral district of Santa Maria di Pisa, running on the electrified portion of the Sassari–Sorso railway. The main part of the network was in 2013 in the advanced development phase. It is under construction is the extension of the line from Santa Maria di Pisa to Li Punti and Baldinca, and the electrification of the railway to Sorso, 10 km from Sassari. It is also planned to convert and electrify the 28 km Sassari-Alghero railway to allow the trams to reach the village of Olmedo, Fertilia Airport and the town of Alghero.

== Rail links to adjacent countries ==

Italy has 11 rail border crossings over the Alpine mountains with her neighbouring countries: six are designated as mainline tracks and two are metre-gauge tracks. The six mainline border crossings are: two with France (one for Nice and Marseille; the other for Lyon and Dijon), two with Switzerland (one for Brig, Bern and Geneva; the other for Chiasso, Lugano, Lucerne and Zürich), and two with Austria (one for Innsbruck; the other for Villach, Graz and Vienna). The two-metre-gauge track crossings are located at the border town of Tirano (enters Switzerland&#x27;s Canton Graubünden/Grisons) and Domodossola (enters Switzerland&#x27;s canton of Ticino).

There was a railway line connecting Italy&#x27;s northeastern port of Trieste to Ljubljana
(Slovenia) and Vienna, built when Trieste was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire:the Austrian Southern Railway. This railway stopped operating at the end of World War II.Direct connections between Trieste and Ljubljana have resumed since september 2018.

==Heritage railways==

In Italy, the heritage railways institute is recognized and protected by law no. 128 of 9 August 2017, which has as its objective the protection and valorisation of disused, suspended or abolished railway lines, of particular cultural, landscape and tourist value, including both railway routes and stations and the related works of art and appurtenances, on which, upon the proposal of the regions to which they belong, tourism-type traffic management is applied (art. 2, paragraph 1). At the same time, the law identified a first list of 18 tourist railways, considered to be of particular value (art. 2, paragraph 2).

The list is periodically updated by decree of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, in agreement with the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the Ministry of Culture, also taking into account the reports in the State-Regions Conference, a list which in 2022 reached 26 railway lines. According to article 1, law 128/2017 has as its purpose: &quot;the protection and valorisation of railway sections of particular cultural, landscape and tourist value, which include railway routes, stations and related works of art and appurtenances, and of the historic and tourist rolling stock authorized to travel along them, as well as the regulation of the use of ferrocycles&quot;.

Below is the list of railway lines recognized as tourist railways by Italian legislation.

The Bernina railway line is a single-track railway line forming part of the Rhaetian Railway (RhB). It links the spa resort of St. Moritz, in the canton of Graubünden, Switzerland, with the town of Tirano, in the Province of Sondrio, Italy, via the Bernina Pass. Reaching a height of above sea level, it is the third highest railway crossing in Europe. It also ranks as the highest adhesion railway of the continent, andwith inclines of up to 7%as one of the steepest adhesion railways in the world. The elevation difference on the section between the Bernina Pass and Tirano is , allowing passengers to view glaciers along the line. On 7 July 2008, the Bernina line and the Albula railway line, which also forms part of the RhB, were recorded in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, under the name &quot;Rhaetian Railway in the Albula / Bernina Landscapes&quot;. The whole site is a cross-border joint Swiss-Italian heritage area. Trains operating on the Bernina line include the Bernina Express.

In July 2023, Ferrovie dello Stato established a new company, the &quot;FS Treni Turistici Italiani&quot; (English: FS Italian Tourist Trains), with the mission &quot;to propose an offer of railway services expressly designed and calibrated for quality, sustainable tourism and attentive to rediscovering the riches of the Italian territory. Tourism that can experience the train journey as an integral moment of the holiday, an element of quality in the overall tourist experience&quot;. There are three service areas proposed: 
* &quot;Luxury trains&quot;, which includes the circulation of the &quot;Orient Express - La Dolce Vita&quot; from 2024, and Venice Simplon Orient Express, already operating on European routes;
* &quot;Express and historic trains&quot;, with the express trains of the 1980s and 1990s being redeveloped and modernized in the railway workshops of Rimini, while the historic trains are used for journeys that include stops with guided tours and tastings; 
* &quot;Regional trains&quot;, also with trips that include experiential tourist stops, which pass through places rich in history, with villages and areas of landscape, naturalistic, food and wine and agri-food interest.

== Funding ==
The Italian railways are partially funded by the government, receiving €8.1 billion in 2009.

<text>Surviving Christmas is a 2004 American romantic comedy film directed by Mike Mitchell, written by Harry Elfont, Deborah Kaplan, Jennifer Ventimilia, and Joshua Sternin, based on a story by Elfont and Kaplan. It stars Ben Affleck, James Gandolfini, Christina Applegate, and Catherine O&#x27;Hara.

The film was panned by critics and performed poorly at the box office, as it earned $15.1 million worldwide against a budget of $45 million. At the Golden Raspberry Awards, the film received nominations for Worst Picture, Worst Actor, and Worst Screenplay, but won none.

==Plot==
Just before Christmas, wealthy advertising executive Drew Latham surprises his girlfriend Missy with first-class tickets to Fiji, but she is horrified that he would want to spend Christmas away from his family. Citing the fact that Drew has never even introduced her to his family, she concludes that he will never get serious about their relationship and dumps him. Drew has his assistant send her a Cartier bracelet to apologize. Desperate not to spend Christmas alone, Drew calls all his contacts to find a place to stay on Christmas, but he is not close enough to anyone to be invited.

Drew tracks down Missy&#x27;s therapist Dr. Freeman at the airport, hoping for a therapy session. The hurried doctor tells him to list all of his grievances and burn them at his childhood home, which is now occupied by the Valcos.

As Drew is acting suspiciously when he sets his grievances on fire, Tom Valco sneaks up behind him and knocks him out with a shovel. When he comes to, they let him come in to look around. He is thrilled to see his old room, so he impetuously offers Tom $250,000 to let him spend Christmas with them. He accepts, and Drew&#x27;s lawyer draws up a contract that requires the Valcos to pose as his family.

The next day, Drew forces the family to go out and buy a tree together, requiring Tom to wear a Santa cap in public. While they are trimming the tree, their daughter Alicia arrives for the holidays and is stunned by Drew&#x27;s presence. He suggests that she could portray the maid since she is an unexpected addition to the scenario. 

Drew writes a script for the family to read at the table at dinner. He hires Saul, a local actor to play the part of his grandfather, whom he calls Doo-Dah, and Tom agrees to let Saul stay with them for the holidays for an extra $25,000. Drew takes Alicia and her brother Brian sledding the next day. After crashing at the bottom of a hill, he moves in to kiss Alicia, who sneezes instead. 

As they recover at home from their colds, Alicia shares a childhood memory with Drew about an old tree that was coated in ice during a storm. Tom asks Drew to leave because he plans to divorce his wife Christine, but Drew encourages the couple to indulge themselves. Tom buys a Chevelle SS, which he had in high school, and Christine goes to a photographer for some glamour shots.

Drew takes Alicia to the old tree of her childhood, which he has covered in ice again. The gesture touches her, but he overdoes it, bringing in a full pageant production to surround the tree. Disgusted by his lack of restraint, Alicia demands that he leave, which he decides to do, and he ends their agreement and is set to write them a check. 

Meanwhile, Missy is won over by the bracelet, and when Drew&#x27;s assistant informs her that he is spending Christmas with his family, she phones Drew to tell him she&#x27;s outside the house with her parents. Drew quickly promises the Valcos an extra $75,000 if they keep playing along for the evening, and they agree. 

The visit between the two families steadily descends into chaos, culminating with everyone seeing Christine&#x27;s glamour shots manipulated into pornography on Brian&#x27;s computer. Missy&#x27;s parents storm out, and Drew informs her that their relationship is over, as Alicia had kissed him a bit earlier. 

Drew tells Alicia the truth about his family: his father left them when he was just four, and his mother, a waitress, who would give him an adult stack of pancakes on Christmas until he was 18, died when he was in college. 

Drew returns to his apartment to spend Christmas alone. Tom visits him to collect his money, and the two decide to go watch Saul perform in the local production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; as he&#x27;d given the whole family tickets. At the play Tom and Christine decide not to divorce. Drew and Alicia make up outside the theater, and everyone then eats in the diner where Drew&#x27;s mother worked double shifts to make extra money at Christmastime.

==Cast==
==Production== 
In May 2001, it was announced that Ben Affleck was in talks to star in &quot;Surviving Christmas&quot; when the project was at Columbia Pictures.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Surviving Christmas&quot; opened theatrically on October 22, 2004, in 2,750 venues, earning $4,441,356 in its opening weekend and ranking seventh in the North American box office and second among the week&#x27;s new releases. The film ended its run on November 23, 2004, with $11,663,156 domestically and $3,457,644 overseas for a worldwide total of $15,120,800.

===Home media===
The film was released on DVD on December 21, 2004, two months after its theatrical release.

===Critical response===
 Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Writing in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Lisa Schwarzbaum said, &quot;Really, critics and audiences ought to turn thoughts and wallets discreetly away from &quot;Surviving Christmas&quot;, ignoring the sight as if Santa had just stepped in droppings from Donner and Blitzen.&quot; In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden concluded, &quot;This is a film that perversely refuses to trust its own comic instincts. Perhaps out of a fear of not having enough jokes, it throws in extra subplots and unnecessary characters to keep the pace frantic, and the action muddled.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for three Golden Raspberry Awards at the 2005 ceremony:
* Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture (lost to &quot;Catwoman&quot;)
* Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actor (Affleck; lost to George W. Bush in &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;)
* Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay (lost to &quot;Catwoman&quot;)

<text>Zouérat () is the largest town in northern Mauritania and the capital of the Tiris Zemmour region, with an approximate population of 62,380 (2023). It lies at the eastern end of the Mauritania Railway to Nouadhibou. 

== History ==

The town developed from its importance to iron ore mining. It is surrounded by the hematite mines of Fderîck, Tazadit and Rouessa. The town houses the regional administration and military for Tiris Zemmour. Most of the town&#x27;s population are employed directly and indirectly in the mining industry. A sizeable number of foreign workers from other African countries live in the town. Amenities include a medical clinic, social club, pool, school and shop. 

Since 2006, a shanty town has grown around the town. In response authorities have begun construction of a wall, nicknamed locally as the &quot;mur de la honte&quot; (wall of shame), to separate the two areas. 

===Mining===
Mining at the mountain was first recorded from the Kediet ej Jill in the 11th century, but it was not until 1952 that iron ore deposits were first commercially extracted on an industrial scale. Beginning in 1958, the first concessions on iron ore extraction were given to Miferma, Société des mines de fer de Mauritanie. At the time it was majority-controlled by European-based mining interests, however, in 1974 Miferma was nationalized by the Mauritanian government. 

In 1981 a new iron ore deposit was discovered at Guelb el Rhein, north of Zouérat. Almost a decade later, another was found in 1990 at Guelb Mhadaouat about from Zouérat. Other companies exploring for iron ore in the region include Xstrata and Arcelor Mittal. The reserves at the SNIM&#x27;s Tazadit mine are estimated to be 200 million tonnes of hematite. 

==Transport==

Zouérat is connected to the port of Nouadhibou by the Mauritania Railway. Freight trains that transport the iron ore to the coast can be as long as in length. The line is also used to bring in all the town&#x27;s drinking water from Boulenoir. 

Tazadit Airport is served by regular flights from/to Nouadhibou and seasonally from/to Casablanca using Mauritania Airlines International Boeing 737-500 and Boeing 737-700 planes. 

Outside the mines, traffic drives on the right side of the road like the rest of Mauritania. However, all vehicles within the mining areas drive on the left. Traffic switches sides at the mine entrances. 

==Climate==
Zouérat has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;). The climate is hot and dry throughout the year, a description accredited to the town&#x27;s location within the extremes of the Sahara.

<text>Kaédi () is the largest city and administrative center of the Gorgol Region of Southern Mauritania, located on the border with Senegal. It is approximately 435 km from Mauritania&#x27;s capital, Nouakchott. 

== Overview ==
The city sits within the &quot;Chemama&quot; Riverine zone along the north bank of the River Senegal where it connects with the Gorgol River. This region is one of the few areas of settled agriculture in the country. Culturally, the city is among the most diverse in Mauritania, consisting of ethnic &quot;White Moors&quot; (Arabic: البيضان) and &quot;Black Moors&quot; (Arabic: السودان), as well as Pulaar, and Soninke communities. 
It is known as a market town, a medical center, and a center for local farmers. The market reflects the sub-Saharan culture of neighboring Senegal somewhat more than the Moorish-Arabic culture found further north in the country. 
Most of the architecture consists of brown, flat-roofed buildings, undistinguished except that most are surrounded by &quot;dutch brick&quot; enclosures. The one exception is the unusual architecture of the Kaédi Regional Hospital, which was constructed in 1989 and features multiple beehive-style domes. The award-winning architecture was designed by the Association for the Development of Traditional African Urbanism and Architecture (ADAUA), which aims to develop indigenous African urban architectural designs using local materials and technologies.

<text>In botany, a staminode is an often rudimentary, sterile or abortive stamen, which means that it does not produce pollen. Staminodes are frequently inconspicuous and stamen-like, usually occurring at the inner whorl of the flower, but are also sometimes long enough to protrude from the corolla.

Sometimes, the staminodes are modified to produce nectar, as in the witch hazel &quot;(Hamamelis)&quot;.

Staminodes can be a critical characteristic for differentiating between species, for instance in the orchid genus &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;, and among the penstemons.

In the case of cannas, the petals are inconsequential and the staminodes are refined into eye-catching petal-like replacements.

A spectacular example of staminode is given by &quot;Couroupita guianensis&quot;, a tropical tree growing in South America also known as the cannonball tree.

<text>Alan Ameche (; June 1, 1933 – August 8, 1988), nicknamed &quot;the Iron Horse&quot;, or simply &quot;the Horse&quot;, was an American football fullback who played for six seasons with the Baltimore Colts in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Wisconsin Badgers and won the Heisman Trophy during his senior season in 1954. He was elected to the Pro Bowl in each of his first four seasons in the league. He is often remembered for scoring the winning touchdown in overtime in the 1958 NFL Championship Game against the New York Giants, labeled &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played&quot;.

With colleague and former Colts teammate Gino Marchetti, Ameche founded the Gino&#x27;s Hamburgers chain. He also founded the Baltimore-based Ameche&#x27;s Drive-in restaurants.

==Early life==
Ameche was born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as Lino Dante Amici to Italian immigrant parents who came to the United States in the late 1920s, although they returned for a year to Italy during his childhood. The family then returned to Kenosha, where he attended Bradford High School. Ameche was a cousin of actor brothers Don and Jim Ameche.

==College career==
Ameche earned unanimous All-America honors at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he played linebacker as well as fullback in single-platoon days. In four years as a Badger, he gained 3,212 yards, then the NCAA record, scored 25 touchdowns, and averaged 4.8 yards per carry. He played in the program&#x27;s first bowl game, the 1953 Rose Bowl, as a sophomore, rushing for 133 yards on 28 carries. Ameche won the Heisman Trophy in 1954, the first for the Badger program.

Ameche is one of six Wisconsin football players to have a number retired by the program (35) and enshrined on the Camp Randall Stadium façade as of 2008: fellow Heisman winner and current career rushing record holder Ron Dayne (33), Elroy Hirsch (40), Dave Schreiner (80), Allan Schafer (83), and Pat Richter (88) are the others. Ameche was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1967, the College Football Hall of Fame in 1975, and the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 2004.

==NFL career==
Ameche was the third overall selection of the 1955 NFL draft and played fullback for the Baltimore Colts from 1955 until 1960. Named NFL Rookie of the Year in , he was a four-time Pro Bowler (1955–58), and the only rookie named to the Associated Press All-Pro team in 1955. Ameche averaged 4.2 yards per carry over his career, and held the record for most rushing yards in his first three NFL games (410) until Carnell &quot;Cadillac&quot; Williams broke the record by gaining 434 yards in 2005.

Ameche may be best remembered for his role in the 1958 NFL Championship Game at Yankee Stadium, often cited as &quot;The Greatest Game Ever Played.&quot; Ameche scored the winning touchdown for the Colts on a one-yard run with 6:45 left in overtime as the Colts beat the Giants, 23–17. It was his second touchdown of the day as he also scored a touchdown on a 2-yard run in the second quarter. His overtime touchdown was the last in championship history until Super Bowl LI in February 2017, when James White scored at 3:58 of overtime as the New England Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons, 34–28.

Due to an Achilles tendon injury in December 1960, Ameche finished a relatively short six-season NFL career with 4,045 rushing yards, 101 receptions for 733 yards and 44 touchdowns. He is one of only four players named to the National Football League 1950s All-Decade Team &quot;not&quot; elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The others are Joe Fortunato, Dick Barwegen and Bobby Walston. In 2015, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Ameche to the P.F.R.A. &quot;Hall of Very Good&quot; Class of 2015.

==NFL career statistics==

==Business career==
Ameche&#x27;s Drive-in was a fast-food restaurant chain based in Baltimore, founded by Alan Ameche. Ameche&#x27;s had five locations, all located in Baltimore or its suburbs:
* Governor Ritchie Highway and 5th Avenue, Glen Burnie
* 5800 Reisterstown Road, Baltimore City
* Loch Raven Boulevard and Taylor Avenue
* 7700 Wise Avenue, Dundalk
* York Road and Timonium Road, Timonium

The restaurants were known for &quot;no charge&quot; carry out service, signature &quot;Powerhouse&quot; hamburgers (&quot;A banquet on a bun&quot;), akin to today&#x27;s Big Mac or Whopper sandwiches, and &quot;Cheerleader&quot; sandwiches (hot ham and Swiss cheese with mustard) and their onion rings. The Loch Raven and Taylor location was open during the Summer of 1960. There is a McDonald&#x27;s on the location today. The restaurants were typical drive-ins, with car side order boxes. Orders were delivered by a carhop who attached a tray to the lowered window. The company trademark was a Big Boy-like football player (#35) running through the uprights carrying a hamburger. In addition, Ameche&#x27;s secret sauce was sold in many local grocery stores. The company slogan was &quot;Meetcha at Ameche&#x27;s!&quot; Ameche&#x27;s restaurants were informally known by many teenaged patrons as &quot;UM-cheez.&quot;

== Death ==
Ameche had undergone triple bypass surgery at age 46 in 1979. He died of a heart attack in 1988 at age 55 at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, a few days after undergoing another heart bypass surgery, under the care of Dr. Michael DeBakey. He is interred at Calvary Cemetery in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="1273434" wikidata="Q1690145" url="?curid=1273434" title="Stick-fighting">
<text>Stick-fighting, stickfighting, or stick fighting, is a variety of martial arts which use simple long, slender, blunt, hand-held, generally wooden &quot;sticks&quot; for fighting, such as a gun staff, bō, jō, walking stick, baston, arnis sticks or similar weapons. Some techniques can also be used with a sturdy umbrella or even with a sword or dagger in its scabbard.

Thicker and/or heavier blunt weapons such as clubs or the mace are outside the scope of &quot;stick-fighting&quot; (since they cannot be wielded with such precision, so sheer force of impact is more important), as are more formed weapons such as the &quot;taiaha&quot; used by the Māori people of New Zealand, and the &quot;macuahuitl&quot; used by the Aztec people of Mesoamerica in warfare.

Although many systems are defensive combat techniques intended for use if attacked while lightly armed, others such as &quot;kendo&quot;, &quot;arnis&quot;, and &quot;gatka&quot; were developed as safe training methods for dangerous weapons. Whatever their history, many stick-fighting techniques lend themselves to being treated as sports.

In addition to systems specifically devoted to stick-fighting, certain other disciplines include it, either in its own right, as in the Tamil martial art &quot;silambam&quot;, or merely as part of a polyvalent training including other weapons and/or bare handed fighting, as in Kerala&#x27;s &quot;kalaripayattu&quot; tradition, where these wooden weapons serve as preliminary training before practice of the more dangerous metal weapons.

Stick-fights between individuals or large gatherings between sub-tribes where men fight duels were an important part of the anthropological heritage of various cultures. On tribes such as the Surma people of Ethiopia, &quot;donga&quot; stick-fighting is an important cultural practice and the best means of showing off to look for a bride, nude or nearly so, and their more warlike neighbors, the Nyangatom people, Pokot people , Turkana people who fight duels bare-chested, the aim being to inflict visible stripes on the back of the adversary, using not plain staffs but sticks with a flexible, whipping tail-end.

==Styles==
Traditional European systems of stick-fighting included a wide variety of methods of quarterstaff combat, which were detailed in numerous manuscripts written by masters-at-arms. Many of these methods became extinct but others adapted and survived as folk-sports and self-defence systems. Examples include Portugal&#x27;s &quot;jogo do pau&quot;, the related &quot;juego del palo&quot; of the Canary Islands, France&#x27;s &quot;canne de combat&quot; or &quot;la canne&quot;, Poland&#x27;s &quot;palcaty&quot; and Italy&#x27;s &quot;scherma di bastone&quot;. Giuseppe Cerri&#x27;s 1854 manual &quot;Trattato teorico e pratico della scherma di bastone&quot; is influenced by masters of the Italian school of swordsmanship, Achille Marozzo and perhaps Francesco Alfieri.

The French system of &quot;la canne&quot; is still practiced as a competitive sport. A self-defense adaptation of &quot;la canne&quot; developed by Swiss master-at-arms Pierre Vigny in the early 1900s has been revived as part of the curriculum of bartitsu.

In the US during the early years of the 1900s, fencer and self-defense specialist A. C. Cunningham developed a unique system of stick-fighting using a walking stick or umbrella, which he recorded in his book &quot;The Cane as a Weapon&quot;.

Singlestick was developed as a method of training in the use of backswords such as the cavalry sabre and naval cutlass. It was a popular pastime in the UK from the 18th to the early 20th century, and was a fencing event at the 1904 Summer Olympics. Although interest in the art declined, a few fencing coaches continued to train with the stick and competitions in this style of stick-fighting were reintroduced into the Royal Navy in the 1980s by commander Locker Madden. The art continues to gain a small following amongst the martial art community in the UK, Australia, Canada and the US.

Latin America also has its share of martial arts devoted to stick-fighting, including Venezuela&#x27;s &quot;juego del garrote&quot;, Brazil&#x27;s &quot;palo do Brasil&quot; and &quot;Maculelê&quot;, Trinidad&#x27;s &quot;calinda&quot; and the South Americans&#x27; &quot;Eskrima Kombat&quot;.

Sticks and staves of various sizes are common weapons in Asian martial arts, in which they vary in design, size, weight, materials and methodology, and are often used interchangeably and alongside open-hand techniques. For example, &quot;eskrima&quot; or arnis of the Philippines uses sticks traditionally crafted from rattan or from butterfruit tree and may be wielded singly or as a pair.

<text>East Meon is a village and civil parish in the East Hampshire district of Hampshire, England. It is west of Petersfield.

The village is located in the Meon Valley approximately north of Portsmouth and southwest of London, on the headwaters of the River Meon. The parish has an area of . The boundaries of the present parish of East Meon date back to 1894.

About a mile to the west rises the prominent hill of Henwood Down (201 m). The South Downs Way passes over the southern spur of the hill. Petersfield railway station is the nearest station, east of the village.

== History ==
There are Bronze Age burial barrows within the parish of East Meon which date back to around 2000 BC. There is also an Iron Age fort, situated just outside the parish boundaries on Old Winchester Hill, constructed approximately 500 years before the Romans invaded Britain. There is also evidence of Roman occupation in and around the village.

East Meon itself may have started life somewhere between 400 and 600 AD. Then it was part of a Royal Manor belonging first to King Alfred the Great who left it in his will to his youngest son Æthelweard (c.880-922). The Domesday Book of 1086 shows that the Manor then belonged to William the Conqueror; it records six mills and land for 64 ploughs.

About 1280 a family from East Meon, who changed their name to de Meones, moved to Dublin, where they became substantial landowners and gave their name to the suburb of Rathmines.

Opposite the church is the old Court House, with a mediaeval hall dating from the late 15th century. At this time, and for many centuries, East Meon belonged to successive Bishops of Winchester. The Court House was its administrative centre and home to a number of monks who played host to the Bishop when he visited East Meon. They also recorded all manorial imports and exports.

East Meon played its part in the English Civil War of the 1640s. The Parliamentarians camped near the village before the Battle of Cheriton in 1644, and it is said that they stole the lead lining from the font to make their bullets. The battle turned out to be a turning point in the war. During the Second World War, Hitler&#x27;s Luftwaffe dropped 38 high explosive bombs and an estimated 3,500 incendiary bombs in the Parish; the only loss of life, however, was a pig.

In 1986, the 900th anniversary of the Domesday Book, East Meon was chosen as &quot;The Domesday Village&quot;, with a model in Winchester Castle&#x27;s Great Hall depicting the village as it was then – the model can still be seen alongside the famous tapestry at Bayeux in Normandy.

==All Saints&#x27; Church==

The village church, named &quot;All Saints,&quot; was built after the Norman Conquest, and dates between 1075 and 1150. It resembles Winchester Cathedral in style, and like the cathedral, it contains a black marble baptismal font created at Tournai, in what is now Belgium, c. 1130–40. The Tournai font is one of four such fonts in the county of Hampshire. Inside the church, there is a stone, which has the words &quot;Amens Plenty&quot; carved into it, which is said to sit atop the graves of four men buried in the standing position.

== Community ==

There are groups for a variety of interests within the local area. There are also charitable organisations which work in and around the village.

=== Groups ===

* The East Meon Garden Club is a society which organises two East Meon Gardens Open Days, in April and June, seven evening meetings, two visits to gardens and the opportunity to buy seeds and plants, fertilisers and bulbs at discounted prices. It runs a Plant Sale and the annual Flower Show.
* The Care Group work arranging transport to local surgeries and hospitals for people who are unable to get there by themselves.
* There is a weekly lunch held in the Village Hall which is open to local residents over the age of 60. The meat is provided by a local butcher.

=== Local Charity ===

* Forbes Almhouses are perhaps the longest-established institution in East Meon for administering help to the poor and elderly, the Forbes Almshouses are administered and funded by a Charitable Trust, whose aim is to provide basic housing for those of very limited means.
* The Sexton is an independent organisation, registered with The Charities Commission, which funds work on the more unruly sections of the graveyard of All Saints. It also has a mandate to protect the natural habitats of the Church grounds. The Sexton has no direct links to the church itself.
* The Good Causes fund is responsible for considering requests for funding, and ensuring that they are within the guidelines laid down by The Charities Commission. Numerous causes have benefited from the £29,000 donated since the Fund&#x27;s inception including the Village Hall, youth organisations, the Luncheon Club, East Meon School, Meon Matters, junior sports activities and the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee and Millennium celebrations.

== Village Hall ==

The Village Hall is a venue with one large hall and a smaller room attached, together with a kitchen, toilets and a stage.

There is an annual May Fair.

== Sport ==

=== Cricket ===

The Cricket Club is a village affair, with its team rooted firmly in East Meon. The club is a Sunday side mainly playing timed matches.

Its ground is located at the South East of the village where the team plays a mixture of local sides and travelling sides from the middle of April to the end of September, the annual sixes competition and village party takes place at the end of June with local sides competing for the East Meon Sixes trophy, and a tour of the Isle of Wight follows in the middle of July.

Needle matches are those against nearby villages, particularly Steep and West Meon. More social events include the games played against the Court House XI, Captain Scott&#x27;s XI, XIIth Men, IBM, Stoke Makers and the Izaak Lions.

<text>Anandyn Amar (; 1886 – July 10, 1941) was the head of state of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic from 1932 to 1936 and twice served as prime minister from 1928–1930 and again from 1936–1939. A widely respected politician, Amar was known for his eloquent defense of Mongolian independence in the face of increasing Soviet domination. Despite this, he proved powerless in preventing Minister of Interior Khorloogiin Choibalsan and the Soviet NKVD from carrying out mass purges of nearly 30,000 Mongolians during his second term as prime minister between 1937 and 1939. Amar&#x27;s popularity ultimately led to his purge by the pro-Soviet Choibalsan, who had him charged with counterrevolution in 1939. Amar was sent to Moscow for trial and executed on July 10, 1941.

==Early life and career==
Amar (literally meaning &quot;peace/peaceful&quot; in the Mongolian language) was born in 1886 in the present-day Khangal district of Bulgan Province (then called Daichin Van &quot;Khoshuu&quot; in Tüsheet Khan Province) in north-central Mongolia. The son of a poor nobleman, the &quot;khokhi taij&quot; or &quot;impoverished prince&quot; Anand, Amar studied Mongolian, Manchu, and Classical Tibetan in the &quot;Khoshuu&quot; school. He then worked his way up from being a local official to a position in the foreign ministry of Autonomous Mongolia from 1913 to 1919.

He joined the Mongolian People&#x27;s Party in 1923, and was elected to the Presidium (Politburo) of the MPRP Central Committee in August 1924. He also served concurrently as a member of the 1st through 7th Little Khurals. From 1923 to 1928, Amar served as deputy prime minister while also holding various other government portfolios at different times, including minister of foreign affairs, minister of internal affairs, and president of the economic council.

==Prime minister (first term)==
Amar was appointed prime minister on February 21, 1928, following the death of Balingiin Tserendorj. The Soviets, already suspicious of the prestige he enjoyed in Mongolia, curtailed his authority by promptly assigning him to work in the Institute of Manuscripts. Amar&#x27;s first term as prime minister ended on April 27, 1930.

From 1930 to 1932, he was chairman of the science committee, during which time he authored two books: &quot;The Tenth Anniversary and Scientific Production&quot; (1931) and &quot;On the Development of the Mongolian National Script&quot; (1933). From 1932 to 1936, he served as chairman of the presidium of the Little Khural (the titular head of state).

==&quot;Short History of Mongolia&quot;==

In 1934, he authored the &quot;Short History of Mongolia&quot;. In the prologue, he wrote:
&quot;It is truly unbearably sad that the Mongol ethnicity, despite having since ancient times and especially in the time of Genghis Khan run a glorious path of development among the countries of Asia and Europe, should in these latter days have been divided into many parts, with some unable to protect and safeguard their ethnic roots, customs, land and property, revering a powerful foreign entity while not having any power or policy to carry out their own affairs or accomplish pertinent actions, not only subjecting themselves to others&#x27; authority but actually striving to accomplish the policies and interests of foreign entities. Imperialist nations such as the Manj (Manchus) and Khyatad (Chinese), who have historically tried to convert the Mongol nation into their trading shops and establish their own sole hegemony while fixing prices at their own whim for exploitative purposes, are now at this very moment fighting amongst each other to convert our own nationally identical Inner Mongolia into their trading shop. And so it is that the Mongol nation of animal husbandry (Inner and Outer Mongolia) has fallen so low as to meet the fate of becoming a trading shop of other nations.&quot;
==Prime minister (second term)==

Amar was appointed prime minister for the second time (and concurrently foreign minister) on March 22, 1936, following Peljidiin Genden&#x27;s removal from both offices. Genden had resisted Soviet pressure to destroy Mongolia&#x27;s Buddhist churches and had publicly scolded Joseph Stalin at a Mongolian Embassy reception. Although Amar was the new prime minister, Khorloogiin Choibalsan became Stalin&#x27;s new favorite and, as head of the newly created Internal Affairs Ministry, was the &quot;de facto&quot; most powerful person in Mongolia. Choibalsan increased his power in May 1936 when he had the Internal Affairs Committee rules amended to facilitate the detention of high-ranking politicians without first consulting political superiors.

Shortly after becoming prime minister in 1936, Amar and Dansranbilegiin Dogsom, the chairman of the presidium of the Little Khural, aggravated Choibalsan and Moscow alike when they pardoned prisoners implicated in the Lkhümbe Affair in honor of the fifteenth anniversary of the revolution. Amar&#x27;s enemies, particularly Choibalsan, used the event to connect him to the fictitious Lkhümbe spy ring. Amar was increasingly accused of participating in counterrevolutionary activity, causing Choibalsan to exclaim, &quot;We must get rid of this feudal trouble maker Amar!&quot;

===Stalinist repressions===

Amar was powerless to prevent the large-scale purges that Choibalsan and NKVD advisers embedded within the interior ministry unleashed on the country from 1937 to 1939. At the first show trial, staged at the Central Theater from October 18 to 20, 1937, Amar openly wept as close friends were sentenced to death.

===Purged===

Because of Amar&#x27;s continued popularity among Mongolians, Stalin was eager to eliminate him. He instructed Choibalsan to have party leader Dorjjavyn Luvsansharav launch a propaganda campaign against the popular prime minister. On March 6, 1939, Luvsansharav denounced Amar at an enlarged meeting of the MPRP Central Committee, saying he &quot;had helped anti-government plotters, opposed their arrest, and neglected the defense of the borders. He betrayed his own country and was a traitor to the revolution.&quot; Once Choibalsan seconded the condemnation, opinions within the Central Committee rapidly turned against Amar.

When Amar took the floor in his own defense he said:
&quot;Although I believe in religion, the one thing that I believe in even more is that Mongolia should stand firmly on her feet to become an independent country. I love my country. I have shown this with my work. I have been among the first to devote myself to the cause of my country&#x27;s development, and my heart is breaking to finally witness myself being called a traitor and being subjected to castigation.&quot;
Amar was found guilty at the end of the one-day trial. He was removed from the office of prime minister, expelled from the MPRP, and then arrested by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In July 1939, Amar&#x27;s case passed to the NKVD, and Amar was sent to the Siberian town of Chita and then on to Moscow. With Amar&#x27;s removal, Choibalsan was named prime minister and became Mongolia&#x27;s uncontested leader, simultaneously holding the offices of prime minister, minister for internal affairs, minister of war, and Commander in Chief of the Mongolian armed forces.

==Trial and execution==

Ironically, while awaiting trial in Moscow, Amar was jailed with Luvsansharav, the very same person who had arrested him and who had also fallen victim to Choibalsan&#x27;s purges shortly thereafter.

On July 10, 1941, Amar was tried by a Soviet &quot;troika&quot; and sentenced to death. Throughout the trial, Amar insisted that, if the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic were really an independent nation, he should be tried by a Mongolian court. His last recorded words were, &quot;It is typical that when a big power colonizes a small country, its leaders are arrested and persecuted. My personal experience demonstrates this attitude of the USSR towards Mongolia.&quot;

He was immediately executed at the Kommunarka shooting ground near Moscow; his body is buried there.

==Rehabilitation==
On December 15, 1956, after reviewing Stalin&#x27;s purges, military collegiums found no evidence of Amar&#x27;s guilt. On January 25, 1962, he was rehabilitated, and on September 26, 1989, his membership in the MPRP was restored.

<text>Jedi Mind Tricks (JMT) are an American underground hip hop group from Philadelphia, founded in 1996 by two high school friends, rapper Vinnie Paz (Vincenzo Luvineri) and producer Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind (Kevin Baldwin). In 1999, rapper Jus Allah joined the group to record their second studio album, &quot;Violent by Design&quot;. Jus left the group shortly after, but returned in late 2006 and began working on the sixth studio album, &quot;A History of Violence&quot;. In 2011 Stoupe left the group because &quot;his heart wasn&#x27;t in making JMT records anymore&quot;. In 2013, Jus split from the group indefinitely, and Stoupe returned in 2015.

DJ Kwestion mainly scratches choruses on the turntable. Kwestion is also a part of the group Skratch Makaniks. Kwestion, who is the tour DJ, was a replacement for JMT&#x27;s previous DJ, Drew Dollars, who is no longer affiliated with the group due to creative differences.

JMT has collaborations with both regional MCs and rap veterans, including GZA, Kool G Rap, 7L &amp; Esoteric, Sean Price, Ras Kass, Canibus, Percee P, Killah Priest, Immortal Technique, Block McCloud, Virtuoso, Louis Logic, R.A. the Rugged Man, Tragedy Khadafi, Chief Kamachi, Necro, and Ill Bill. The group has sold over 250,000 albums in the United States and 450,000 albums worldwide, all of which were released independently.

==History==
===1996–97: &quot;Amber Probe&quot; EP and &quot;Psycho-Social&quot;===
Jedi Mind Tricks officially debuted with the &quot;Amber Probe&quot; EP.

&quot;The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological &amp; Electro-Magnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness&quot;, known as &quot;The Psycho-Social CD&quot; for short, was released by Superregular Recordings and was JMT&#x27;s first full-length LP. It featured 12 tracks and the 2002 re-issue featured 6 bonus tracks, and included all the tracks that had appeared on the &quot;Amber Probe&quot; EP.

===1998–2000: &quot;Five Perfect Exertions&quot; EP and &quot;Violent by Design&quot;===
Prior to the release of their first LP, Vinnie Paz had conceived the idea of forming a rotating, collaborative super-group of underground East Coast artists called the Army of the Pharaohs (AotP).
 1998 saw the first result of these efforts in &quot;The Five Perfect Exertions&quot; EP. The release featured Virtuoso, 7L &amp; Esoteric, Chief Kamachi and Bahamadia as well as Vinnie Paz himself. The EP was later remixed for JMT&#x27;s next LP, &quot;Violent by Design&quot; (2000), albeit without Chief Kamachi&#x27;s verse.

The LP was originally titled &quot;Polymatrix: Reincarnation of the Hologramic Christ&quot;. Vinnie Paz&#x27;s style became noticeably more aggressive, abandoning his cosmic, paranoid rhyme style from &quot;The Psycho-Social CD&quot; for more violent lyrics. The LP also introduced Jus Allah, a founding member of JMT who had left for college but dropped out a short while after. A self-proclaimed Five-Percenter, Jus was present on every non-AotP track on &quot;Violent by Design&quot; as JMT&#x27;s unofficial third member. Violent By Design contained a mix of braggadocio and horrorcore lyrics, combining hardcore/gangsta rap styles with mythological and fantasy imagery. According to Vinnie Paz, JMT used the proceeds from &quot;The Amber Probe&quot; to buy equipment to produce &quot;Violent by Design&quot;, which was recorded entirely in Stoupe&#x27;s bedroom, without a mic booth or soundproofing.

The list of guest artists on this album was also their longest, including Mr. Lif, Planetary of OuterSpace, Louis Logic, Diamondback, Philip King Rappah, Coffee Gangsta Child L-Fudge, B.A. Barakus, J-Treds, Killa Sha, C-Baz and Tragedy Khadafi, plus a couple of odd phone-call interludes by Mr. Len.

During the course of &quot;Violent by Design&#x27;s&quot; 1999–2000 recording period, Paz changed his alias from Ikon the Verbal Hologram to Vinnie Paz, inspired by the boxer of the same name. The reason for this has been reported to be the result of a short-lived rivalry instigated by fellow Philly underground rapper iCON the Mic King. Vinnie Paz decided to settle on his new moniker in order to prevent any further confusion. It was also around this time that he formally declared himself to be a follower of Islam, alluding to this fact several times on record.

===2003: &quot;Visions of Gandhi&quot;===
In 2003, JMT released their third LP, &quot;Visions of Gandhi&quot;. In an interview, Vinnie Paz said the title was inspired by Foxy Brown&#x27;s verse in Nas&#x27;s song &quot;Affirmative Action&quot;, and expresses the need for a prominent figure of non-violent social change such as Gandhi in a post-9/11 world. Stoupe, now supplied with a professional studio in New York, also expanded his variety of production, incorporating grand orchestral samples and a stronger Latin feel. In response, some longtime fans felt let down by Vinnie Paz&#x27;s lyricism and delivery, as well as the abundance of slick, upbeat loops adopted by Stoupe . Nevertheless, the album helped expand the group&#x27;s audience as its popularity and commercial success continued to grow. Despite the album&#x27;s reference to Gandhi, its lyrics were violent and homophobic, with &quot;Pitchfork&quot; panning the album as &quot;an awkward mix of murder rap and the shiniest boom-bap money can buy.&quot; The review also criticized Stoupe&#x27;s production, claiming that the &quot;mysteriously upbeat&quot; tracks clashed with Vinnie Paz&#x27;s horrorcore lyrics.

===2004–06: &quot;Legacy of Blood&quot; and &quot;Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell&quot;===
A little over a year after &quot;Visions of Gandhi&quot;, JMT released &quot;Legacy of Blood&quot;, this time intentionally keeping guest artists to a minimum. Vinnie Paz also added a more personal aspect to his lyrics, most notably in the last song &quot;Before the Great Collapse,&quot; which was written as a suicide note to his mother.

In February 2005, Babygrande announced that Jus Allah had signed on to the label after reconciling with his former partners. Babygrande released his long-awaited debut LP, &quot;All Fates Have Changed&quot;, in May of that year. However, after a dispute with label CEO Chuck Wilson soon after the album&#x27;s release, Jus left Babygrande and denied any new association with JMT.

In March 2006, a reunited Army of the Pharaohs released &quot;The Torture Papers&quot; LP. The crew now consisted of Vinnie Paz, Chief Kamachi, 7L &amp; Esoteric, Apathy, Celph Titled, Planetary &amp; Crypt the Warchild of Outerspace, King Syze, Faez One, Reef the Lost Cauze, and new Jedi Mind Tricks hype-man Des Devious. This time, however, Virtuoso and Bahamadia were not featured and were no longer associated with AotP.

The fifth Jedi Mind Tricks album, titled &quot;Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell&quot;, was released on September 19, 2006. The release coincided with the beginning of a tour to promote the album, which kicked off in New York City&#x27;s Times Square. The album was widely acclaimed, unlike the group&#x27;s two previous albums. A large part of the acclaim was due to the album&#x27;s lyrical and musical diversity, both missing from their previous efforts. The album featured the single &quot;Heavy Metal Kings&quot; with Ill Bill, the Shara Worden-assisted &quot;Razorblade Salvation&quot;, and the storytelling track &quot;Uncommon Valor: A Vietnam Story&quot; with R.A. the Rugged Man. A day after the release of the album, Vinnie Paz of Jedi Mind Tricks did an interview with &quot;The Breakdown&quot;, a show on ItsHipHop.tv where he discussed the album and his thoughts on Jus Allah.

In early 2006, rumors spread that the group had reunited with estranged member Jus Allah, and that he would be featured on &quot;Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell&quot;, but no collaboration appeared. However, on September 20, 2006 a newly recorded Jedi Mind Tricks/Jus Allah collaboration, produced by Brods and entitled &quot;The Rebuilding,&quot; appeared online. In a January 2007 interview, Paz stated that Jus would be featured on the group&#x27;s upcoming sixth album, titled &quot;A History of Violence&quot;. Jus Allah, Doap Nixon and Demoz were added to the AotP roster in 2007, and contributed verses to the group&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Ritual of Battle&quot;, which was released on September 25, 2007. Also, in summer 2008, Jedi Mind Tricks&#x27; Label, Babygrande, released a JMT DVD called &quot;Divine Fire: The Story of Jedi Mind Tricks&quot;.

===2007–09: Reunion with Jus Allah and &quot;A History of Violence&quot;===
In an interview conducted in September 2007 on the Art of Rhyme website, Jus Allah announced that he has rejoined Jedi Mind Tricks. In the interview, he stated &quot;I&#x27;m back in the group [and that] I&#x27;m focused on... putting out the next Jedi Mind Tricks album... a History of Violence.&quot; &quot;A History of Violence&quot; was released on November 11, 2008. It would be the last JMT album released on Babygrande Records.

===2010–13: &quot;Enemy Soil&quot;, &quot;Violence Begets Violence&quot;, departure of Stoupe and Jus Allah===
After a long time dispute with Babygrande Records, JMT decided to part ways and form their own record label entitled Enemy Soil. Enemy Soil features artists such as JMT, Reef the Lost Cauze, Dutch (the side group of Stoupe The Enemy of Mankind), and Army of the Pharaohs.

Vinnie Paz released his first solo album &quot;Season of the Assassin&quot; on June 22, 2010. Jus Allah is in the works of releasing his second solo album entitled MMA (Meanest Man Alive). Stoupe released the album for his group, Dutch, (which features Liz Fullerton on vocals) entitled &quot;A Bright Cold Day&quot; on June 8, 2010. Army of the Pharaohs released their third album as well entitled &quot;The Unholy Terror&quot; on March 30, 2010.

It was announced that JMT would be creating a new title called &quot;Violence Begets Violence&quot;. This album marks the first album without Stoupe behind production. Vinnie Paz stated in a blog on the JMT website that Stoupe has lost the inspiration for Hip-Hop and decided to focus on other things in his career, such as his sidegroups, and that Stoupe would not be producing any of the tracks on the new JMT album. Vinnie Paz stated that there is no conflict between the two and if Stoupe wants to be part of the next album, Paz would welcome him back. JMT has since gotten numerous producers to fill in the slot and released a new single from the album entitled &quot;Target Practice&quot;. The new album was released on October 25, 2011.

In November 2013, one of the first acts on Stoupe&#x27;s new production company, Bad Tape Music, Red Martina released their debut &quot;Intransit&quot; with Stoupe as the producer on all thirteen tracks. Other band members are rapper Noesis (from Philadelphia Slick), multi-instrumentalist Ish Quintero, and vocalist Hayley Cass.

Jus Allah had left the group along with leaving the supergroup Army of the Pharaohs. The reason for his departure has not been disclosed.

===2014–18: Return of Stoupe, &quot;The Thief and the Fallen&quot; and &quot;The Bridge and the Abyss&quot;===
On November 7, 2014, JMTHIPHOP.com confirmed Stoupe&#x27;s return to Jedi Mind Tricks. On November 27, 2014, a post on jmthiphop.com revealed that Vinnie Paz and Stoupe would be returning as Jedi Mind Tricks in 2015.

Their album &quot;The Thief and the Fallen&quot; was released on June 2, 2015.

Vinnie Paz mentioned numerous times in 2016 on his podcast, &quot;Broad Street Breakdown&quot;, that he and Stoupe were working on another Jedi Mind Tricks record.

The ninth studio album &quot;The Bridge and the Abyss&quot; was released on June 22, 2018.

===2019–now: Vinnie Paz albums and &quot;The Funeral and the Raven&quot;===
From 2019, Vinnie Paz released several studio albums, including &quot;Camouflage Regime&quot; with Tragedy Khadafi.

On November 19, 2021, Jedi Mind Tricks released their tenth studio album, &quot;The Funeral and the Raven&quot;, which was fully produced by Stoupe.

<text>A bootee (also bootie or booty) is a short soft sock or bootlike garment used for warmth or protection. Bootees for babies are usually thick and knitted, to keep the baby&#x27;s feet warm. Dog booties for dogs such as sledge dogs in very cold Arctic conditions (see Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race) protect the animal from the cold and sharp ice. Booties worn over the shoes in cold-weather biking similarly protect cyclists. 

Disposable socks, such as those worn for hygiene by surgical teams, are also called bootees.

<text>Koumbi Saleh, or Kumbi Saleh, is the site of a ruined ancient and medieval city in south east Mauritania that may have been the capital of the Ghana Empire. It is also a commune with a population of 11,064 (census 2013).

From the ninth century, Arab authors mention the Ghana Empire in connection with the trans-Saharan gold trade. Al-Bakri who wrote in eleventh century described the capital of Ghana as consisting of two towns apart, one inhabited by Muslim merchants, and the other by the king of Ghana. The discovery in 1913 of a 17th-century African chronicle that gave the name of the capital as Koumbi led French archaeologists to the ruins at Koumbi Saleh. Excavations at the site have revealed the ruins of a large Muslim town with houses built of stone and a congregational mosque but no inscription to unambiguously identify the site as that of capital of Ghana. Ruins of the king&#x27;s town described by al-Bakri have not been found. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the site was occupied between the late 5th and 14th centuries, with the urban period extending approximately from the 11th to the 14th centuries.

==Arabic sources and the capital of the Ghana Empire==
The earliest author to mention Ghana is the Persian astronomer Ibrahim al-Fazari who, writing at the end of the eighth century, refers to &quot;the territory of Ghana, the land of gold&quot;. The Ghana Empire lay in the Sahel region to the north of the West African gold fields and was able to profit from controlling the trans-Saharan gold trade. The early history of Ghana is unknown but there is evidence that North Africa had begun importing gold from West Africa before the Arab conquest in the middle of the seventh century.

In the medieval Arabic sources the word &quot;Ghana&quot; can refer to a royal title, the name of a capital city or a kingdom. The earliest reference to Ghana as a town is by al-Khuwarizmi who died in around 846 AD. Two centuries later a detailed description of the town is provided by al-Bakri in his &quot;Book of Routes and Realms&quot; which he completed in around 1068. Al-Bakri never visited the region but obtained his information from earlier writers and from informants that he met in his native Spain:

The city of Ghāna consists of two towns situated on a plain. One of these towns, which is inhabited by Muslims, is large and possesses twelve mosques, in one of which they assemble for Friday prayer. ... In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. The king&#x27;s town is distant from this one and bears the name of Al-Ghāba. Between these two towns are continuous habitations. The houses of the inhabitants are of stone and acacia wood. The king has a palace and a number of domed dwellings all surrounded with an enclosure like a city wall. In the king&#x27;s town, and not far from his courts of justice, is a mosque where Muslims who arrive in his court pray. Around the king&#x27;s town are domed buildings and groves and thickets where the sorcerers of these people, men in charge of the religious cult, live.

The descriptions provided by the early Arab authors lack sufficient detail to pinpoint the exact location of the town. The much later 17th-century African chronicle, the &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot;, states that the Malian Empire was preceded by the Kayamagna dynasty which had a capital at a town called Koumbi. The chronicle does not use the word Ghana. The other important 17th-century chronicle, the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot; mentions that the Malian Empire came after the dynasty of Qayamagha which had its capital at the city of Ghana. It is assumed that the &quot;Kayamagna&quot; or &quot;Qayamagha&quot; dynasty ruled the empire of Ghana mentioned in the early Arabic sources.

==Contested identification==

In recent years, the identification of Koumbi Saleh with the &#x27;city of Ghana&#x27; described in the sources has been increasingly disputed by scholars. No inscription has been found to unambiguously link the ruins with the Muslim capital of Ghana described by al-Bakri. Moreover, the ruins of the king&#x27;s town of Al-Ghaba have not been found.

al-Idrisi, a twelfth-century writer, described Ghana&#x27;s royal city as lying on a riverbank, a river he called the &quot;Nile.&quot; This followed the geographic custom of his day, which confused the Niger and Senegal Rivers and believed that they formed a single river often called the &quot;Nile of the Blacks&quot;. Whether al-Idrisi was referring to a new and later capital located elsewhere, or whether there was confusion or corruption in his text is unclear. However, he does state that the royal palace he knew was built in 510 AH (1116–1117 AD), suggesting that it was a newer town, rebuilt closer to the river than Koumbi Saleh. This has led to the suggestion that at some point the capital may have been moved south to the Niger River.

In the French translation of the &quot;Tarikh al-fattash&quot; published in 1913, Octave Houdas and Maurice Delafosse include a footnote in which they comment that local tradition also suggested that the first capital of Kayamagna was at Koumbi and that the town was in the Ouagadou region in Mali, northeast of Goumbou on the road leading from Goumbou to Néma and Oualata.

Ann Kritzinger, relying on a re-reading of ibn Battuta and other Arabic writers, has argued that the archaeological site of Koumbi Saleh in fact represents the Berber town of Awdaghost, and that the capital of the Ghana Empire was Djenne.

==Archaeological site==
===Dig history===
The extensive ruins at Koumbi Saleh were first reported by Albert Bonnel de Mézières in 1914. The site lies in the Sahel region of southern Mauritania, 30 km north of the Malian border, 57 km south-southeast of Timbédra and 98 km northwest of the town of Nara in Mali. The vegetation is low grass with thorny scrub and the occasional acacia tree. In the wet season (July–September) the limited rain fills a number of depressions, but for the rest of the year there is no rain and no surface water.

Beginning with Bonnel de Mézières in 1914, the site has been excavated by successive teams of French archaeologists. Paul Thomassey and Raymond Mauny excavated between 1949 and 1951, Serge Robert during 1975-76 and Sophie Berthier during 1980–81.
===Site description===
The urban planning of Koumbi Saleh was complex and well-organized. Connah (2008) notes that the city was divided into two main areas: the royal palace and the commercial district. The palace was located on a raised platform and was surrounded by a moat. The commercial district consisted of a large central market and numerous smaller markets that specialized in specific goods. Insoll (1997) suggests that the layout of the city was influenced by Islamic urban planning principles, such as the use of mosques and the orientation of streets towards Mecca.

The main section of the town lay on a small hill that nowadays rises to about 15 m above the surrounding plain. The hill would have originally been lower as part of the present height is a result of the accumulated ruins. The houses were constructed from local stone (schist) using banco rather than mortar. From the quantity of debris it is likely that some of the buildings had more than one storey. The rooms were quite narrow, probably due to the absence of large trees to provide long rafters to support the ceilings. The houses were densely packed together and separated by narrow streets. In contrast a wide avenue, up to 12 m in width, ran in an east–west direction across the town. At the western end lay an open site that was probably used as a marketplace. The main mosque was centrally placed on the avenue. It measured approximately 46 m east to west and 23 m north to south. The western end was probably open to the sky. The mihrab faced due east. The upper section of the town covered an area of 700 m by 700 m. To the southwest lay a lower area (500 m by 700 m) that would have been occupied by less permanent structures and the occasional stone building. There were two large cemeteries outside the town suggesting that the site was occupied over an extended period. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal fragments from a house near the mosque have given dates that range between the late 5th and the 14th centuries, with the main period of urbanization extending from the 11th to the 14th centuries. 

===Interpretation===
The archaeology of Koumbi Saleh provides insight into the urbanization process of one of the earliest West African states. According to Es&#x27;andah (1976), the city was either founded or greatly expanded upon in the 8th century AD with recent estimates in the last 2 decades of a possible foundation period as far back as the 2nd century to 1st century BCE and as of the 8th century AD served as the primary epicenter of a vast trade network that spanned the Sahara Desert. Archaeological evidence suggests that the city was a hub for the exchange of gold, iron, salt, ivory, and other commodities. One of the most significant archaeological discoveries at Koumbi Saleh was the uncovering of large numbers of Islamic coins, ceramics, and glassware. This suggests that the city had extensive trading links with other Islamic regions such as North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. The coins were minted in locations as far away as Baghdad, providing evidence of the far-reaching trade networks that once existed in West Africa.

The French archaeologist Raymond Mauny estimated that the town would have accommodated between 15,000 and 20,000 inhabitants, acknowledging that this is an enormous population for a town in the Sahara with a very limited supply of water (&quot;Chiffre énorme pour une ville saharienne&quot;).

The archaeological excavations at Koumbi Saleh have provided valuable insights into the political, economic, and social structures of the Ghana Empire. The city&#x27;s ruins and ancient artifacts have been recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, and ongoing research continues to shed light on the rich history of West Africa&#x27;s ancient kingdoms.

== Mosque ==

=== Architecture ===
Believed to have been built between the ninth and fourteenth centuries, the Kumbi Saleh mosque is one of the earliest recognised structures among its counterparts, such as the Awdaghust, found in the Adrar and Hodh regions. Despite the limited historical documentation, these mosques are of great importance in understanding the architectural heritage of the region. In particular, in the eleventh century, Al-Bakri identified Kumbi Saleh as the capital of the Kingdom of Wagadu, also known as the Kingdom of Ghana.

Situated in what was probably a Sahelian steppe environment, the Mosque of Kumbi Saleh has undergone numerous transformations and extensions throughout its history. Original measurements suggest that the building spanned approximately 46 metres on the east-west axis and 23 metres on the north-south axis, making it one of the larger structures of its time.

First observations by Raymond Mauny and Paul Thomassey in 1950 led to extensive excavations between 1979 and 1982 by Serge Robert, which provided important insights into its architectural development. The mosque, built primarily of dry stone and decorated with a plaster of red mud, featured decorative slabs of slate with intricate painted designs, including epigraphic, geometric and floral motifs.

Throughout its existence, the Kumbi Saleh mosque has undergone several phases of expansion and renovation. Later extensions raised the height of the prayer hall to about 3 metres, supported by columns with stone drums on top. Architectural excavations revealed a series of mihrabs, demonstrating the mosque&#x27;s continuous adaptation to the changing needs of its community.

The urban vitality of Kumbi Saleh is exemplified by the successive additions and alterations to the mosque, demonstrating the historical importance of the area as a cultural and religious centre. Similarly, the mosque of Awdaghust shares many architectural characteristics with the mosque of Kumbi Saleh, with stone construction and decorative elements, albeit with unique variations reflecting its own historical context and development.

==World Heritage Status==

The archaeological site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on June 14, 2001 in the Cultural category.

<doc id="1273457" wikidata="Q281271" url="?curid=1273457" title="Hamiota, Manitoba">
<text>Hamiota is an unincorporated urban community in the Hamiota Municipality within the Canadian province of Manitoba that held town status prior to January 1, 2015. It is located on Provincial Trunk Highway 21 (PTH 21) midway between the Trans-Canada Highway and the Yellowhead Highway. It is located in Western Manitoba, 84 kilometers northwest of Brandon. The trading area radius of 20 kilometres has approximately 10,000 people. First known as Hamilton, for Thomas Hamilton, one of the first settlers, the town name was changed to avoid confusion with Hamilton, Ontario. The new name contracted Hamilton with the Sioux word ota, &quot;much&quot;.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Hamiota had a population of 856 living in 393 of its 438 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 841. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Culture==
Hamiota is known for its local sports teams, arts and culture community, and health care. Hamiota was the home of Dr. John E. Hudson (&quot;Dr. Ed&quot;: 1917–2003), a member of the Order of Canada (2001) and recipient of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Anniversary Medal (2003). Dr. Hudson led Hamiota District Health Center to become the model rural health care facility in Manitoba. A memorial statue of Dr. Hudson was erected near the hospital in 2004. MP Inky Mark was the main force behind the statue project.
The community offers arts/cultural opportunities through the new Heritage Arts Center. Formerly known as the Royal Bank Building, the Heritage Arts Center was constructed as the Union Bank in 1905. Now occupied by the Mid-West Arts Council, the building provides a space for exhibiting of art, serving as the only exhibition space within the district.

Hamiota Pioneer Club Museum features artifacts relating to the settlement and development of the district, including a taxidermy display, the former McConnell railway station and their most recent addition, the Oakner Church.

==Economy==
The agriculture, healthcare and education sectors are the major employers within the area. Within the last four years, the region has seen growth in the agriculture sector. Over 100 new jobs have been created in Hamiota and area in the last three to four years with many of these in the expanding livestock sector.

==Education and health==

Hamiota District Health Care Centre embraced the &quot;community health care concept in the early 1970s.

The Pope National Wildlife Reserve was used as a water storage area for the railway during the age of steam locomotives, these parcels of land were returned to the federal government with the advent of the diesel engine. The area was designated as a national wildlife reserve in 1972. It is one of the few federally-owned parcels of land remaining in Manitoba, and is an important water source for the wetlands and marshes located downstream.

==Biodiversity==
Hamiota has one of the few known nesting sites for the Western Plains garter snake a species once thought to be extinct. A hibernaculum was built for the snakes 6.5 kilometres west of the community.

==Leisure==
The Pitlockery Trail takes walkers east of Hamiota to view the marsh life and enjoy the sounds of the bird population. Spring brings warblers, blackbirds and ducks; many stay to raise their young for the summer, only to migrate south in the fall season. Chickadees keep watch over the frozen marsh during winter, awaiting the return of spring. The trail is located along the former railway line.

The Chumah Trail allows outdoor enthusiasts west of Hamiota to enjoy the prairie grasslands and native vegetation. A viewing platform for birds has been constructed at the end of the trail branching off to the north. With more tree and bush cover, this trail is better situated for cross country skiing in the winter and is groomed regularly. The trail is located along the former railway line.

Hamiota Municipal Park was established in 1967 as part of Canada&#x27;s centennial celebrations. It is home to seven ball diamonds, an outdoor equestrian arena, horse and cattle barns, soccer pitch, beach volleyball, children&#x27;s playground, 28 site serviced campground, Hamiota Municipal Museum and the Hamiota Aquatic Centre. Located next to the Hamiota &amp; District Sports Complex and the 9-hole Hamiota Golf Course, the park is the host for sports.

<doc id="1273486" wikidata="Q2474891" url="?curid=1273486" title="Heli (biblical figure)">
<text>Heli (; Eli in the New American Standard Bible) is an individual mentioned in the Gospel of Luke as the grandfather of Jesus. In Luke&#x27;s genealogy of Jesus, Heli is listed as the father of Joseph (the husband of Mary), and the son of Matthat ().

Heli is not mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, the only other canonical gospel to include a genealogy; that genealogy instead identifies &quot;Jacob&quot; as Joseph&#x27;s putative father.

==Two genealogies of Jesus==

The New Testament provides two accounts of the genealogy of Jesus, one in the Gospel of Matthew and another in the Gospel of Luke. Matthew starts with Abraham, while Luke begins with Adam. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has twenty-seven generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has forty-two, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists.⁠ Notably, the two accounts also disagree on who Joseph&#x27;s father was: Matthew says he was Jacob, while Luke says he was Heli.

Traditional Christian scholars (starting with Africanus and Eusebius) have put forward various theories that seek to explain why the lineages are so different, such as that Matthew&#x27;s account follows the lineage of Joseph, while Luke&#x27;s follows the lineage of Mary. Some modern critical scholars like Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan state that both genealogies are inventions, intended to bring the Messianic claims into conformity with Jewish criteria.

Another possibility is that since both Heli and Jacob have a similar name listed as their father (Matthan in Matthew, Matthat in Luke), a discrepancy that can easily be accounted for by error, that the names Heli and Jacob refer to the same person. Matthew relied heavily on fitting existing prophecy to the narrative; in the Old Testament, Jacob (the last of the biblical patriarchs) also had a son named Joseph. This explanation fits for Heli/Jacob himself, but not for the earlier genealogies.

==The curse on the Solomonic line==

If Matthew&#x27;s genealogy is that of Mary, and Luke&#x27;s of Joseph, then there is a problem with the curse on the Solomonic line, dating from the time of Jeconiah where Jeremiah pronounced that no descendant of Jeconiah would again sit on the throne of David in Judah. In contrast, if Luke&#x27;s genealogy is that of Mary, and Matthew&#x27;s of Joseph, then this creates no problem with the curse on the Solomonic line. However, Jeconiah&#x27;s grandson Zerubbabel is later chosen by God, and was a governor of the Achaemenid Empire&#x27;s Yehud Medinta (Province of Judah), as appointed by Darius the Great.

==Saint Joachim and Saint Anne==

The apocryphal Protoevangelium of James gives the story of Saint Joachim and Saint Anne as the parents of Mary. This is largely followed in Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican tradition.

<doc id="1273488" wikidata="Q3054808" url="?curid=1273488" title="Higher education in Iran">
<text>Iran has a network of private, public, and state-affiliated universities offering degrees in higher education. State-run universities of Iran are under the direct supervision of Iran&#x27;s Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (for non-medical universities) and Ministry of Health and Medical Education (for medical schools). According to article 3 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iran guarantees &quot;free education and physical training for everyone at all levels, and the facilitation and expansion of higher education.&quot; IANI representatives say that academics in Iran are &quot;ultimately directed by the regime and military when it comes to specific areas of research&quot;. Rana Dadpour, who taught at an Iranian university, said that certain areas of research are directed by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and could be employed for &quot;surveillance or military purposes&quot;.

== History ==

=== Pre-Islamic era ===

The existence of pre-Islamic era universities such as the School of Nisibis, Sarouyeh, Reishahr, and The Academy of Gundishapur provide examples of precedence of academic institutions of science that date back to ancient times.

=== Islamic era ===
The traditions and heritage of these centers of higher learning were later carried on to schools such as Iran&#x27;s Nizamiyya, and Baghdad&#x27;s House of Wisdom, during the Islamic era.
Nizamiyyah institutes were among the first well organized institutions of higher learning in the Muslim world. The quality of education was among the highest in the Islamic world, and they were even renowned in Europe. They were supported financially, politically, and spiritually by the royal establishment and the elite class. Some scholars have suggested that the establishment of the Nizamiyya madrasas was in fact an attempt to thwart the growing influence of another group of Muslims, the Ismailis, in the region. Indeed, Nizam al-Mulk devoted a significant section in his famous &quot;Books of Politics (Siyāsatnāma)&quot; to refuting the Ismaili doctrines.

The most famous and celebrated of all the nizamiyyah schools was Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad (established 1065), where Khwaja Nizam al-Mulk appointed the distinguished philosopher and theologian, al-Ghazali, as a professor. Persian poet Sa&#x27;di was a student of the Baghdad Nizamiyyah. Other nizamiyyah schools were located in Nishapur, Amol, Balkh, Herat and Isfahan.

=== Modern ===
It was Abbas Mirza who first dispatched Iranian students to Europe for a western education.

The history of the establishment of &quot;western style&quot; academic universities in Iran (Persia) dates back to 1851 with the establishment of Darolfonoon – which was founded as a result of the efforts of the royal vizier &quot;Mirza Taghi Khan Amir Kabir&quot;, aimed at training and teaching Iranian experts in many fields of science and technology.

In 1855 &quot;The Ministry of Science&quot; was first established, and Ali Gholi Mirza I&#x27;tizad al-saltaneh (علیقلی میرزا اعتضاد السلطنه) was appointed Iran&#x27;s first Minister of Science by Nasereddin Shah.

By the 1890s Darolfonoon was competing with other prominent institutions of modern learning. The &quot;Military College of Tehran&quot; (Madraseh-ye Nezam), established in 1885 with a budget of 10,000-12,000 tomans, was its first rival; and in 1899 the &quot;College of political sciences&quot; (Madraseh-ye olum-e siyasi) was organized within the Foreign ministry.

The Ministry of Higher Education, which oversees the operation of all institutes of higher education in Iran, was established in 1967. However, it was back in 1928 that Iran&#x27;s first university, as we know it today, was proposed by an Iranian physicist, Mahmoud Hessaby. The University of Tehran (or Tehran University) was designed by French architect Andre Godard, and built in 1934. Today, Tehran University is Iran&#x27;s largest university with over 32,000 students.

In the medical field, it was Joseph Cochran who first founded a professional school in Iran in 1878, and who is often credited for founding Iran&#x27;s &quot;first contemporary medical college&quot;, as well as founding one of Iran&#x27;s first modern hospitals (&quot;Westminster Hospital&quot;) in Urmia formerly known as Rezaieh in honor of Shia Islam&#x27;s 8th Imam. The medical faculty Cochran established at Urmia University was joined by several other Americans, namely Drs. Wright, Homlz, van Nourdon, and Miller. They were all buried in Urmia as their resting place after serving the area for many years.

In Tehran, Samuel M. Jordan, whom &quot;Jordan Ave.&quot; in Tehran is named after, also was directly responsible for the expansion of the American College in Tehran. The school received a permanent charter from the Board of Regents of the State University of New York in 1932.
By the end of the first Pahlavi period in 1941, the University of Tehran was still the only modern university in the country. Hence, the ministry of science commenced the establishment of other universities in Isfahan, Tabriz, Ahvaz, and Shiraz, with special emphasis given to the medical and veterinary sciences. Charles Oberling was highly instrumental in this regard.

In 1953, there were four universities with 14,500 undergraduate students whereas in 1977 there were 16 universities with 154,315 undergraduate students.

The Shah soon initiated projects to build Iranian universities modeled after American schools. Thus &quot;Pahlavi University&quot; (Shiraz University today), Sharif University of Technology, and Isfahan University of Technology, three of Iran&#x27;s top academic universities were all directly modeled on American institutions such as the University of Illinois at Chicago, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania. The Shah in return was generous in awarding American universities with financial gifts. For example, the University of Southern California received a gift from the Shah in the form of an endowed chair of petroleum engineering, and a million dollar donation was given to the George Washington University to create an Iranian Studies program.

The Iranian revolution put an end to the massive US-Iran academic relations. In 1980, a major overhaul in the academia and higher education system of Iran initiated by Ayatollah Khomeini led to what is referred to in Iran as &quot;Iran&#x27;s Cultural Revolution&quot;. However, all universities in the country were closed down from 1980 to 1983. In addition, Islamic curricula and Islamic educational setting were introduced when the universities were reopened.

In 1986, the ministry of higher education handed over supervision and overseeing of education in the medical sciences in Iran to the ministry of health, treatment and medical education. 

After the Iran–Iraq War, some new universities were founded and doctoral programs were developed in the previous universities. The number of university students is now more than six times as many as in 1979 (when Shah was overthrown), so that critics debate whether the national entrance exam is useful anymore or not.

== Academic system of Iranian universities ==
In 2008, Iran had over 3.5 million students enrolled in universities. Some 1.7 million in various programs in Islamic Azad university and the remainder in State universities. In addition the new enrollment numbers for the academic year 2004 were 290 thousand in Azad universities, and 250 thousand in state universities. Iran has 54 state operated universities, and 42 state medical schools. These are primarily the top choice for students in national entrance exams. There are 289 major private universities operating as well. In all these schools, except for private universities such as the Islamic Azad University system, tuition and room and board is mostly paid for by the government. The universities themselves largely operate on state budgets.

Some schools offer degrees in conjunction with European universities. The International University of Chabahar for example in 2007 offered programs under the guidance of London School of Economics and Political Science Goldsmiths University of London, and Royal Holloway. Other schools such as the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences in Zanjan, have close collaboration with The International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy for workshops, seminars, and summer schools. The Iranian government also in 2017 offered scholarships for successful applicants to pursue PhD-level studies in foreign countries, mostly Great Britain.

By early 2000, Iran allocated around 0.4% of its GDP to R&amp;D, which ranks it &quot;far behind industrialized societies&quot; and the world average of 1.4%. By 2009 this ratio of research to GDP reached 0.87% and the set target was 2.5%.

== Prominent libraries in Iran ==
Large libraries existed in Iran both before and after the advent of Islam and throughout many periods in Iran&#x27;s history, including the libraries at Gondeshapur, School of Nisibis, and Sarouyeh during the pre-Islamic era of Iran.

During the Middle Ages, many schools of Nizamiyya harbored large collections of manuscripts and treatises. In Maragheh, Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī built a library that reportedly contained some 40,000 volumes which was well financed and the royal library of the Samanid court in which Avicenna was granted special access to, is yet another fine example.

The first prototype of a modern national library in Iran was the Library of Dar al-Funun College established in 1851. In 1899 another library called the Nation&#x27;s Library was inaugurated in Tehran. Finally, the National Library of Iran was inaugurated in 1937.

Iran&#x27;s major national libraries today are:
* National Library of Iran, Tehran
* Central Library of Astan Quds Razavi, Mashad
* Tabriz National Library, Tabriz
* Malek National Library, Tehran
* Ayatollah Marashi Najafi Library, Qom
* Iran&#x27;s Library of The Parliament
* Shiraz Regional Library of Science and Technology, Shiraz
* Library of Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics

== Ideology and politics in higher education ==

Under the rule of the Islamic theocracy in Iran since 1979 revolution, the status of science and education has been dramatically affected in the country. In particular, following the so-called Iranian Cultural Revolution and Islamization of universities after a shutdown period, the quality of science and technology has since been revived, so much so that Iran ranked 40th in science production and first in scientific growth in the world in 2011.

=== Exclusion of students ===

==== Religious ====

Students of unrecognized minority religions have been barred from entering tertiary education institutions in Iran, particularly those of the Baháʼí Faith. Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979 Baháʼí students have been excluded from universities regardless of their national university examination results on basis of their religion. See Baháʼí Institute for Higher Education.

==== Gender-based ====
Additionally, in August 2012, 36 universities declared that 77 BA and BSc courses in 2012–2012 academic year would be &quot;single gender&quot; and effectively exclusive to men, limiting the options of female undergraduate students.

== Entrepreneurship ==
In accordance with the third five-year development plan, the “entrepreneurship development plan in Iranian universities”, (known as KARAD Plan) was developed, and launched in twelve universities across the country, under the supervision of Management and Planning Organization and the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology.

== Brain drain and students abroad ==
Iran tops the world countries in the brain drain phenomenon. In 2002, the CIA estimated that 77% of Iran&#x27;s population aged 15 and over can read and write. By 2008, the adult literacy rate had reached 80.6%. A significant majority of this population is at or approaching collegiate levels. Of this population, nearly 150,000 are estimated to exit Iran every year.

According to the Iranian government, in 2013, 12,000 foreign students were studying at Iranian universities while 55,686 Iranian students were studying abroad. Out of this number, 8,883 students were studying in Malaysia, 7,341 in the United States, 5,638 in Canada, 3,504 in Germany, 3,364 in Turkey, 3,228 in Britain, and the rest in other countries. But according to a newer estimate by the Minister of education, between 350 and 500 thousand Iranians were studying outside of the country in 2014. The difference remains unexplained. As of 2015, 42% of recent/young graduates were unemployed. As of 2020, 40,000 foreign nationals are studying in 43 Iranian universities, 22,000 of whom are studying at the universities affiliated to the Ministry of Science, 8,000 at the Azad University, 3,000 at the Ministry of Health, and the rest at other universities. Some 50 percent of these students are studying for a bachelor&#x27;s degree and 16 percent of whom are educating to receive a Ph.D.

<doc id="1273491" wikidata="Q17011487" url="?curid=1273491" title="Exponential stability">
<text>In control theory, a continuous linear time-invariant system (LTI) is exponentially stable if and only if the system has eigenvalues (i.e., the poles of input-to-output systems) with strictly negative real parts (i.e., in the left half of the complex plane). A discrete-time input-to-output LTI system is exponentially stable if and only if the poles of its transfer function lie strictly within the unit circle centered on the origin of the complex plane. Systems that are not LTI are exponentially stable if their convergence is bounded by exponential decay.
Exponential stability is a form of asymptotic stability, valid for more general dynamical systems.

==Practical consequences==

An exponentially stable LTI system is one that will not &quot;blow up&quot; (i.e., give an unbounded output) when given a finite input or non-zero initial condition. Moreover, if the system is given a fixed, finite input (i.e., a step), then any resulting oscillations in the output will decay at an exponential rate, and the output will tend asymptotically to a new final, steady-state value. If the system is instead given a Dirac delta impulse as input, then induced oscillations will die away and the system will return to its previous value. If oscillations do not die away, or the system does not return to its original output when an impulse is applied, the system is instead marginally stable.

==Example exponentially stable LTI systems==

The graph on the right shows the impulse response of two similar systems. The green curve is the response of the system with impulse response formula_1, while the blue represents the system formula_2. Although one response is oscillatory, both return to the original value of 0 over time. 

===Real-world example===

Imagine putting a marble in a ladle. It will settle itself into the lowest point of the ladle and, unless disturbed, will stay there. Now imagine giving the ball a push, which is an approximation to a Dirac delta impulse. The marble will roll back and forth but eventually resettle in the bottom of the ladle. Drawing the horizontal position of the marble over time would give a gradually diminishing sinusoid rather like the blue curve in the image above.

A step input in this case requires supporting the marble away from the bottom of the ladle, so that it cannot roll back. It will stay in the same position and will not, as would be the case if the system were only marginally stable or entirely unstable, continue to move away from the bottom of the ladle under this constant force equal to its weight.

It is important to note that in this example the system is not stable for all inputs. Give the marble a big enough push, and it will fall out of the ladle and fall, stopping only when it reaches the floor. For some systems, therefore, it is proper to state that a system is exponentially stable &quot;over a certain range of inputs&quot;.

<doc id="1273494" wikidata="Q115512" url="?curid=1273494" title="The Spy in Black">
<text>The Spy in Black (US: U-boat 29) is a 1939 British spy film, and the first collaboration between the British filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. They were brought together by Alexander Korda to make the World War I spy thriller novel of the same title by Joseph Storer Clouston into a film. Powell and Pressburger eventually made over 20 films during the course of their partnership.

&quot;The Spy in Black&quot; stars Conrad Veidt, Valerie Hobson and Sebastian Shaw, with Marius Goring and Torin Thatcher as two German submarine officers. Grant Sutherland, a minister in Powell&#x27;s &quot;The Edge of the World&quot; (1937), appears in this film as a Scottish air raid warden.

==Plot==
In March 1917, Captain Hardt (Conrad Veidt), a World War I German U-boat commander, is ordered to spy on the British Fleet at Scapa Flow, rendezvousing at the Old Man of Hoy. He sneaks ashore on the Orkney Islands to meet his contact, Fräulein Tiel (Valerie Hobson). Tiel has taken over the identity of a new local schoolteacher, Miss Anne Burnett (June Duprez), whom female German agents had intercepted and chloroformed en route to the island. Hardt finds himself attracted to her, but Tiel shows no interest. The Germans are aided by a disgraced Royal Navy officer, the former Commander Ashington (Sebastian Shaw) who, according to Tiel, has agreed to aid the Germans after losing his command due to drunkenness, and Tiel implies that she has slept with Ashington to obtain his cooperation.

The plan is almost disrupted when Burnett&#x27;s fiancé, Rev. Harris, arrives unexpectedly, but is taken captive; an intrusive local minister and his wife are also deflected away. 

Equipped with the crucial information he needs about the British fleet movements, Hardt rendezvous with his submarine to arrange for a fleet of U-boats to attack a sortie of two Royal Navy squadrons. Returning to the house, and confident that all is going according to plan, Hardt makes a romantic overture to Tiel, but, pulling rank, she rebuffs him. She sneaks out of the house, believing she has locked Hardt in his room, but he leaves and secretly follows her, discovering that she has gone out to meet Ashington. Hardt overhears them talking and learns they are imposters: the British are aware of his presence, and have turned his mission into a trap for the U-boats. Hardt&#x27;s &quot;contacts&quot; are really British double agents – Ashington is in fact RN Commander Blacklock, and &quot;Fräulein Tiel&quot; is his wife, Jill.

As Jill prepares to leave the island, Blacklock returns to the house to arrest Hardt, only to find he has eluded them. Disguised in Rev. Harris&#x27;s clothes, Hardt manages to board the island ferry, which is also carrying Jill, a number of civilian passengers, and eight German POWs. Blacklock reports Hardt&#x27;s escape to the base commander, who explains that the British had learned of the Germans&#x27; plan when the real Anne Burnett briefly survived the German agents&#x27; attempt to kill her by throwing her off an oceanside cliff.

At sea, Hardt manages to free the German prisoners and they seize the ferry. The Royal Navy pursue them, but before it can can catch up the ferry is intercepted by Hardt&#x27;s submarine, and Hardt&#x27;s first officer, Lieutenant Schuster (Marius Goring) decides to shell it. As the U-boat surfaces and prepares to fire, Hardt realises it is his own submarine. He frantically attempts to signal it, but too late – the U-boat shells the ferry, which begins to sink. British ships then arrive and drop depth charges, destroying the fleeing U-boat. As Jill and the other passengers flee in life boats, Hardt realises all is lost and chooses to go down with the ship and join his crew.

==Production==
&quot;The Spy in Black&quot; was filmed at Denham Studios, with location shooting at Northchurch Common in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire and in Orkney, Scotland. The film wrapped production on 24 December 1938 and was released in the U.K. on 7 August 1939 – just weeks before the country again went to war with Germany. Its American premiere was held in New York City on 5 October of that year, and it went into general release two days later.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote &quot;This intricate story is gripping from beginning to end, and very skilfully directed&quot;; &quot;Variety&quot; opined &quot;Production is A1, as is the direction&quot;; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;the most exciting spy melodrama since the advent of the Second World War. The British may not have the &quot;Bremen&quot;, but they still have Conrad Veidt.&quot;

==Awards and honours==
This film was named by the National Board of Review as one of the ten best films of 1939.

<doc id="1273496" wikidata="Q5165624" url="?curid=1273496" title="Contraband (1940 film)">
<text>Contraband is a 1940 wartime spy film by the British director-writer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, which reunited stars Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson after their earlier appearance in &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; the previous year. On this occasion, Veidt plays a hero, something he did not do very often, and there is also an early (uncredited) performance by Leo Genn.

The title of the film in the United States was Blackout. Powell writes in his autobiography, &quot;A Life in Movies&quot;, as saying that the U.S. renaming was a better title and he wished he had thought of it.

==Plot==
It is November 1939: the Phoney War-stage of the World War II. Denmark is still neutral, but Danish Captain Andersen and his freighter &quot;Helvig&quot; are stopped in the English Channel by Lt. Commanders Ashton and Ellis for a cargo inspection in a British Contraband Control Port.

He receives two shore passes for himself and his First Officer Axel Skold to dine with Ashton and Ellis, but the passes (and &quot;Helvig&quot;″s motorboat) are stolen by passengers Mrs. Sorensen and talent scout Mr. Pidgeon. From a cut-out newspaper train schedule, Andersen is able to figure out they are taking a train to London and catches up with them; but, when the train arrives in the blacked-out metropolis, he is only able to hold on to Mrs. Sorensen.

He invites her to dine at the restaurant of Skold&#x27;s brother Erik. Then she takes him to the home of her aunt, where they are captured by a Nazi spy ring led by Van Dyne, a man Mrs. Sorensen has already had unpleasant dealings with in Düsseldorf, Germany. Van Dyne knows Mrs. Sorensen and Pidgeon are British agents. Van Dyne finds a message hidden on one of Mrs. Sorensen&#x27;s cigarette papers, identifying her as &quot;M47&quot; and listing the names of neutral ships under which two German vessels are traveling. He decides to replace one of the names with that of an American ship to cause trouble, the United States being neutral at this time. Mrs. Sorensen and Andersen are tied up, but the captain manages to escape. He brings back reinforcements in the form of Erik Skold&#x27;s staff and is able to free Mrs. Sorensen and knock out Van Dyne. With everything cleared up, Capt. Andersen and Mrs. Sorensen resume their sea voyage.

==Production==
&quot;Contraband&quot; was intended as a followup to Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Spy in Black&quot;, which was filmed at the end of 1938, but was not released by Alexander Korda for almost a year. The current film was in production from 16 December 1939 through 27 January 1940 at Denham Film Studios, with location shooting in London at Chester Square in Belgravia, and in Ramsgate in Kent.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;TV Guide&quot; online review called it &quot;An odd little comic thriller - who, except perhaps Michael Powell, would cast 47-year-old &quot;Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot; (1920) star Conrad Veidt as a light romantic hero?&quot;

&quot;Time Out&quot; wrote that &quot;Less stylish than &quot;The Spy in Black&quot;, this espionage thriller is more fun, with its tongue-in-cheek plot revelling in Hitchcockian eccentricities&quot;. &quot;Radio Times&quot; describes it as &quot;A neat Second World War espionage thriller that depicts a London crawling with spies&quot;.

Dennis Schwartz of Ozus&#x27; World Movie Reviews had mixed feelings, giving it a grade of B−. &quot;The brisk pace and its added touches of quaintness, made the film endearing of the lack of any character study and the one-dimensional tone of the villains.&quot; However, he wondered &quot;how much better a more romantically inclined hero would have fared in his [Veidt&#x27;s] role.&quot;

<doc id="1273497" wikidata="Q87402" url="?curid=1273497" title="Hans-Peter Dürr">
<text>Hans-Peter Dürr (7 October 1929 – 18 May 2014) was a German physicist. He worked on nuclear and quantum physics, elementary particles and gravitation, epistemology, and philosophy, and he advocated responsible scientific and energy policies. In 1987, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for &quot;his profound critique of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and his work to convert high technology to peaceful uses&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hans-Peter Dürr was born in Stuttgart in 1929. He studied physics in Stuttgart, graduating with a Diploma in 1953 and did postgraduate studies at University of California, Berkeley, completing his Ph.D. in 1956 supervised by Edward Teller.

==Career==

From 1958 until 1976 he was a research associate of Werner Heisenberg, specializing in nuclear physics, quantum physics, elementary particles and gravitation epistemology and philosophy. He was Heisenberg&#x27;s closest ally in their attempts to develop a unified field theory of elementary particles. In 1962 he habilitated at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. The same year he was a guest professor in Berkeley, California and Madras, India. 

Until 1997 he was professor of physics at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich.
Between 1978 and 1997 he was executive Director of the Max Planck Institute for Physics (Werner-Heisenberg-Institute) and Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich several times. He was Vice executive director from 1972-1977, 1981–1986 and 1993-1995.

===Advocacy===
In the 1980s, Dürr advocated the cause of peace as a member of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs. In 1983, he helped co-fund the Scientists&#x27; Initiative &quot;Responsibility for Peace&quot;, which led to the Scientists&#x27; Peace Congress in Mainz attended by 3,300 scientists and the Mainzer Appell, a declaration against further nuclear armament. In 1990, another large scientists&#x27; convention in Göttingen warned against the militarization of space. In support of these conventions, Dürr gave a series of lectures at numerous German universities. Dürr was a leading critic of the US Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), otherwise known as Star Wars.

In 1986 Dürr proposed a World Peace Initiative, on a similar scale to the SDI, to solve environmental problems, and achieve social justice and peace. In 1987 this was reborn as the Global Challenges Network, which received the Right Livelihood Award together with Dürr.

More recently, Dürr contributed to the global environmental movement. He served as a member of the board of Greenpeace Germany and as a member of the International Advisory Council on the Economic Development of Hainan in Harmony with the Natural Environment in China. In 1996, Dürr was made a member of the UN Secretary General&#x27;s international advisory group for the Habitat II Conference in Istanbul.

Dürr was a member of the Club of Rome and served on the scientific committee of the Vienna Internationale Akademie für Zukunftsfragen, advocating sustainable, equitable, and viable development, emphasizing energy efficiency and sufficiency as a point of entry. He was a founder member of the German Vereinigung für Ökologische Ökonomie.

==Later years, emeritus after 1997==
In 2005, together with Daniel Dahm and Rudolf zur Lippe, he published the Potsdam Manifesto and the Potsdam Denkschrift as a follow-up to the Russell–Einstein Manifesto of 1955. They were signed by a large group of scientists from all over the world, including 20 laureates of the Right Livelihood Award.

From 2006 until his death, he was a founding councillor at the World Future Council, and a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for the democratic reformation of the United Nations.

He also championed various social justice causes, and helped fund the &quot;David against Goliath&quot; organization protesting against a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in Bavaria.

==Personal life==

Dürr was married for more than 50 years and had 4 children and numerous grandchildren. He died in May 2014 in Munich.

<text>49th Parallel is a 1941 British war drama film, the third made by the team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. It was released in the United States as The Invaders.

==Plot==
In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, German U-boat &quot;U-37&quot; sinks a Canadian freighter and then evades the RCN and RCAF by sailing into Hudson Bay. While a raiding party of six is ashore in search of food and fuel, the U-boat is sunk by RCAF bombers. The six survivors head for the neutral United States, led by Lieutenants Hirth and Kuhnecke.

When a floatplane is dispatched to investigate reports of the sinking, the Germans open fire, killing the pilot and some of the local Inuit. They steal the aircraft but cannot achieve takeoff because they are overloaded. After a sailor is shot and killed by an Inuk, the load is light enough for takeoff.

Heading south, the floatplane exhausts its fuel and crashes into a lake in Manitoba, killing Kuhnecke. The Germans are welcomed by a nearby Hutterite farming community. Hirth assumes that the Hutterites are sympathetic to the Nazi cause, but his fanatical speech is refuted by Peter, the community&#x27;s leader. One of the sailors, Vogel, would rather join the community, but he is tried by Hirth and executed for desertion and treachery.

Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz arrive in Winnipeg. Hirth decides that they will travel west to Vancouver and catch a steamship for Japan. They hijack a car and then board a train that stops in Banff, Alberta, during Banff Indian Days. A Canadian Mountie addresses the crowd and Kranz is arrested when he panics.

Fleeing across the Rocky Mountains, the two remaining men are welcomed to a lakeside camp by eccentric English writer Philip Armstrong Scott, who takes them for lost tourists. After they burn his manuscript and precious paintings, Scott and his men pursue them. Lohrmann finally rebels against Hirth&#x27;s leadership and takes off by himself. Lohrmann is cornered in a cave. Scott is wounded but enters the cave and beats Lohrmann unconscious.

Hirth, the last fugitive, meets Andy Brock, a Canadian soldier who is absent without leave, in a freight car on a train near the international border. Hirth knocks Brock unconscious with the butt of his gun and steals his uniform and dog tags. After the train crosses the border at Niagara Falls, Hirth surrenders his gun to a customs official and demands to be taken to the German embassy. Brock tells the official that Hirth, now globally famous, is wanted in Canada for murder. The customs officials are powerless to do anything, but then Brock has an inspiration: he says that because neither man is listed on the freight manifest, they cannot enter the country. Using this technicality, the officials reject the cargo and send the train back to Canada. As the train passes over the bridge, Brock dons his uniform cap and announces his intent to take back his pants.

==Production==
The British Ministry of Information approached Michael Powell to produce a propaganda film, suggesting minesweeping as the subject. Powell instead desired to make a film to help sway opinion in the neutral United States. Powell persuaded the British and Canadian governments and started location filming in 1940, but by the time the film appeared in March 1942, the U.S. was already involved in the war. Powell&#x27;s interest in creating a propaganda film in Canada dovetailed with some of Pressburger&#x27;s work. The screenplay was initially based on Pressburger&#x27;s idea to replicate the &quot;Ten Little Indians&quot; scenario of people being removed from a group, one by one. Arthur Horman, who wrote several sequences, later wrote &quot;Desperate Journey&quot;, a film with a similar story.

The original choice to play German officer Hirth was Esmond Knight, but he was unavailable because of his military duties. Anton Walbrook donated half his fee to the International Red Cross. Raymond Massey, Laurence Olivier and Leslie Howard all agreed to work at half of their normal fees. The film marked the only time that Canadian-born Massey played a Canadian on screen.

Elisabeth Bergner was originally cast in the role of Anna but deserted the film, refusing to return to Britain for the studio scenes. As a German, she feared for her life if the Nazis were to invade. Glynis Johns replaced Bergner. However, many location wide shots in which Bergner appeared were salvaged for the film, including the initial long shots of Anna.

The replica &quot;U-37&quot; carried two 1,000-pound bombs supplied by the RCAF. Powell did not inform the actors that the bombs were aboard so that the actors would not be nervous. The actors were replaced by dummies before the bombs were detonated. Powell&#x27;s voice can be heard faintly in some of the submarine scenes. Once, when the camera boat almost collides with the submarine, Powell says, &quot;Keep rolling.&quot; The men in the lifeboat at the start of the film were mainly local merchant seamen, many of whom had already been torpedoed.

Lovell nearly drowned filming the scene in which the commandeered floatplane crashes. The plane sank faster than anticipated, and a stink bomb that was thrown in to &quot;heighten the turmoil&quot; added to the chaos. A member of the camera crew jumped into the water and saved Lovell.

Ralph Vaughan Williams provided the music, his first film score. The music was directed by Muir Mathieson and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.

Although the film&#x27;s budget was intended to be £68,000, costs ran to £132,000, of which the government provided less than £60,000.

==Release==
Columbia distributed the film in the U.S. in 1942 as &quot;The Invaders&quot; for a reported $200,000 after Universal had declined. American censors cut 19 minutes from the film, including the speech by the fanatical Nazi commander who claims that Eskimos are like Negros and &quot;semi-apes, only one degree above the Jews&quot;, which was removed to avoid offending segregationists in the American South. The American film trailer was made on the set of the film &quot;The Talk of the Town&quot; under the title &quot;It Happened One Noon&quot;, with stars Cary Grant, Jean Arthur and Ronald Colman telling director George Stevens about seeing the exciting film during a two-hour lunch break.

According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot;, &quot;49th Parallel&quot; was the most popular film at the British box office in 1941. &quot;The Times&quot; attributed the success of the film to the enthusiasm of Odeon Cinemas founder Oscar Deutsch.

&quot;Variety&quot; estimated that the film earned $1.3 million in U.S. rentals in 1942. The film earned a total of $5 million at the North American box office.

The British Film Institute ranked &quot;49th Parallel&quot; at #63 among the most popular films with British audiences based on a cinema attendance of 9.3 million in the UK.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for the &quot;Liverpool Evening Express&quot;, critic Cedric Fraser called &quot;49th Parallel&quot; &quot;[o]ne of the finest pictures ever made in this country&quot; and wrote: &quot;This is a magnificent film, fair to the point of scrupulousness, and revealing in all its ruthlessness the savagery of the typical Nazi.&quot;

J. E. Sewell of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote: &quot;It is a grown-up&#x27;s film, presenting our point of view with fairness, vigour and humanity through the medium of an exciting, vivid story, and some of the best short characterizations I have ever seen. All I could wish changed is the title, which seems to me to be almost completely irrelevant.&quot;

In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther wrote: &quot;Among the best of the anti-Nazi pictures which have yet been exhibited hereabouts, you can list the British-made &quot;The Invaders&quot; ... For this, indeed, is a picture which not only argues trenchantly but is filmed and played with such intelligence that it gives an illusion of documented fact. ... And, except for a few static stretches and one slightly artificial sequence, it stands up with &quot;Target for Tonight&quot; as one of the memorable war films so far. For the purpose of ideological contrasts—or for tense and exciting action, too—a better story could hardly have been conceived. ... &quot;The Invaders&quot; is an absorbing and exciting film.&quot;

&quot;49th Parallel&quot; holds a 90% approval rating on &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10.

== Awards ==
Pressburger won an Oscar for Best Story and the film was nominated for Best Picture and Best Screenplay (including Rodney Ackland for additional dialogue). Powell was nominated for Best Director by the New York Film Critics Circle.

<doc id="1273502" wikidata="Q2363966" url="?curid=1273502" title="Loser (Beck song)">
<text>&quot;Loser&quot; is a single by American musician Beck. It was written by Beck and record producer Carl Stephenson, who both produced the song with Tom Rothrock. &quot;Loser&quot; was initially released as Beck&#x27;s second single by independent record label Bong Load Custom Records on 12-inch vinyl format with catalog number BL5 on March 8, 1993.

When it was first released independently, &quot;Loser&quot; began receiving airplay on various modern rock stations, and the song&#x27;s popularity eventually led to a major-label record deal with Geffen Records-subsidiary DGC Records. After the song&#x27;s re-release under DGC, the song peaked at number 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in April 1994, becoming Beck&#x27;s first single to hit a major chart. Internationally, the song reached number one in Norway and entered the top 10 in Australia, Austria, Canada, Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. The song was subsequently released on the 1994 album &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;. Its music video was directed by Steve Hanft and filmed in California on a budget of total $14,300. In 2023, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Loser&quot; among the 500 best pop songs of all time.

==Conception and recording==
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Beck was a homeless musician in the New York City anti-folk scene. He returned to his hometown of Los Angeles in early 1991, due to his financial struggles. Described by biographer Julian Palacios as having &quot;no opportunities whatsoever&quot;, Beck worked low-wage jobs to survive, but still found time to perform his songs at local coffeehouses and clubs. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. &quot;I&#x27;d be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking, so maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience&#x27;s boredom, I&#x27;d make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening. &#x27;Loser&#x27; was an extension of that.&quot; Tom Rothrock, co-owner of independent record label Bong Load, expressed interest in Beck&#x27;s music and introduced him to Carl Stephenson, a record producer for Rap-A-Lot Records.

&quot;Loser&quot; was written and recorded by Beck while he was visiting Stephenson&#x27;s home. Although the song was created spontaneously, Beck has claimed to have had the idea for the song since the late 1980s; he once said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think I would have been able to go in and do &#x27;Loser&#x27; in a six-hour shot without having been somewhat prepared. It was accidental, but it was something that I&#x27;d been working toward for a long time.&quot; Beck played some of his songs for Stephenson; Stephenson enjoyed the songs, but was unimpressed by Beck&#x27;s rapping. Stephenson recorded a brief guitar part from one of Beck&#x27;s songs onto an 8-track, looped it, and added a drum track to it. Stephenson then added his own sitar playing and other samples. At that point, Beck began writing and improvising lyrics for the recording. For the song&#x27;s vocals, Beck attempted to emulate the rapping style of Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D. According to Beck, the line that became the song&#x27;s chorus originated because &quot;When [Stephenson] played it back, I thought, &#x27;Man, I&#x27;m the worst rapper in the world, I&#x27;m just a loser.&#x27; So I started singing &#x27;I&#x27;m a baby, so why don&#x27;t you kill me.&#x27;&quot; According to Rothrock, the song was largely finished in six and a half hours, with two minor overdubs several months later.

==Composition and lyrics==

Beck acknowledged the impact of folk on the song, saying &quot;I&#x27;d realized that a lot of what folk music is about taking a tradition and reflecting your own time. I knew my folk music would take off, if I put hip-hop beats behind it.&quot; He had also perceived similarities between Delta blues and hip hop, which helped to inspire the song. The A.V. Club&#x27;s Annie Zaleski opines that the song imitates abstract hip hop, while James Reed from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called it an alternative rock anthem, and Veronica Chambers for &quot;Vibe&quot; magazine described the song as a &quot;folk-based hip hop song.&quot; &quot;Loser&quot; revolves around several recurring musical elements: a slide guitar riff, Stephenson&#x27;s sitar, the bassline, and a tremolo guitar part. The song&#x27;s drum track is sampled from a Johnny Jenkins cover of Dr. John&#x27;s &quot;I Walk on Guilded Splinters&quot; from the 1970 album &quot;Ton-Ton Macoute!&quot;. During the song&#x27;s break, there is a sample of a line of dialogue from the 1991 Steve Hanft-directed film &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot;, which goes &quot;I&#x27;m a driver/I&#x27;m a winner/Things are gonna change, I can feel it&quot;. Hanft and Beck were friends, and Hanft would go on to direct several music videos for Beck, including the video for &quot;Loser&quot;.

Referred to as a &quot;stoner rap&quot; by AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the lyrics are mostly nonsensical. The song&#x27;s chorus, in which Beck sings the lines &quot;Soy un perdedor/I&#x27;m a loser baby, so why don&#x27;t you kill me?&quot;, is often interpreted as a parody of Generation X&#x27;s &quot;slacker&quot; culture. Beck has denied the validity of this meaning, instead saying that the chorus is simply about his lack of skill as a rapper. Jon Pareles wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;The sentiment of &#x27;Loser&#x27; [...] reflects the twentysomething trademark, a mixture of self-mockery and sardonic defiance&quot;, noting Beck&#x27;s &quot;offhand vocal tone and free-associative lyrics&quot; and comparing his vocals to &quot;Bob Dylan talk-singing&quot;. After its recording, Beck thought that the song was interesting but unimpressive. He later said, &quot;The raps and vocals are all first takes. If I&#x27;d known the impact it was going to make, I would have put something a little more substantial in it.&quot; The relationship between Beck and Stephenson soured after the release of &quot;Loser&quot; as a single. Stephenson regretted his involvement in creating the song, in particular the &quot;negative&quot; lyrics, saying &quot;I feel bad about it. It&#x27;s not Beck the person, it&#x27;s the words. I just wish I could have been more of a positive influence.&quot;

==Release and performance==
&quot;Loser&quot; was first released on March 8, 1993, as a 12-inch vinyl single on Bong Load, with only 500 copies pressed. Beck felt that &quot;Loser&quot; was mediocre, and only agreed to its release at Rothrock&#x27;s insistence. &quot;Loser&quot; unexpectedly received radio airplay, starting in Los Angeles, where college radio stations KCRW and KXLU were the first to play it, followed by modern rock station KROQ-FM. Beck made his worldwide live radio performance debut on July 23, 1993 during KCRW&#x27;s Morning Becomes Eclectic, hosted by Chris Douridas. The song then spread to Seattle through KNDD, and KROQ-FM began playing the song on an almost hourly basis. By the time stations in New York were requesting copies of &quot;Loser&quot;, Bong Load had already run out. Beck was soon beset with offers to sign with major labels. Convinced that the song was a potential hit, Rothrock gave a vinyl pressing of the single to his friend Tony Berg, who had been working in the A&amp;R department for Geffen Records. Berg said, &quot;I just lost my mind when I heard it. He left my office, and I swear, by the time he got home, I had left a message asking him to introduce me to [Beck]&quot;. Beck, in spite of his hesitance to be on any major label, signed with Geffen subsidiary DGC. He explained, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t going to do anything for a long time, but Bong Load didn&#x27;t have the means to make as many copies as people wanted. Geffen were involved and they wanted to make it to more of an organized place, one with a bigger budget and better distribution.&quot;

In January 1994, DGC reissued &quot;Loser&quot; on CD and cassette, and Geffen began heavily promoting the single. Bong Load, having retained the rights to release Beck&#x27;s songs on vinyl due to the nature of Beck&#x27;s contract with DGC, re-pressed the 12-inch single in larger quantities than before. &quot;Loser&quot; quickly ascended the charts in the US, reaching a peak of number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and topping the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It was certified gold by the RIAA and sold 600,000 copies domestically. The song also charted in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and throughout Europe. &quot;Loser&quot;&#x27;s worldwide success shot Beck into a position of attention, and the media dubbed him the center of the new so-called &quot;slacker&quot; movement. Beck refuted this characterization of himself, saying, &quot;Slacker my ass. I never had any slack. I was working a $4-an-hour job trying to stay alive. That slacker stuff is for people who have the time to be depressed about everything.&quot;

Around the time of the song&#x27;s release, Beck had been approached about including &quot;Loser&quot; on the soundtrack of the comedy film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;, but he refused. He recalled the process, &quot;I remember getting a phone call one day. My manager said, &#x27;There&#x27;s a film. They want to use &#x27;Loser&#x27; as the theme song.&#x27; There was a long pause, and he said, &#x27;The name of the film is &quot;Dumb And Dumber&quot;.&#x27; And I just remember: That sums up what the world thinks of me at this point. I tried to have fun with it, tried to not take it too serious. But at the same time, it was a little disheartening sometimes.&quot;

==Critical reception==
In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the single CD a one-star honorable mention (), picked out two songs, &quot;Fume&quot; and &quot;Alcohol&quot;, and stated that it&#x27;s Beck&#x27;s &quot;greatest hit, an album demo, and two-for-three prime odds and ends&quot;. David Stubbs from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; remarked &quot;the downer-than-downbeat lo-fi, lo-esteem&quot; of &quot;Loser&quot;. Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; wrote, &quot;Despite its title, the odd combination of sitar and dobro-driven(!) alternative pop with dance rhythms, makes a winner out of this song.&quot; Paul Moody from &quot;NME&quot; wrote, &quot;A greased-up sliding blues it may be, but deep inside it there&#x27;s a smog-filled LA desperation at work (&quot;The re-run shows and the cocaine nose jobs/The folk singer slob who hung himself with a guitar string&quot;) where Beck actually, erm, makes some sense. Is this allowed?&quot; Michael Azerrad from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented, &quot;Enter 23-year-old Beck singing, &quot;I&#x27;m a loser, baby, so why don&#x27;t you kill me?&quot; on &#x27;Loser&#x27;, the ultracatchy opening track on this fascinating debut. Just to underline the point, a sampled George Bush says, &quot;I&#x27;m a driver. I&#x27;m a winner&quot;.&quot; 

Another &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor, Paul Evans, felt it &quot;was an awesome, omnipresent single, its trickle-of-consciousness lyrics, ragged acoustic six-string and noise percussion lingering on the radio waves like air freshener.&quot; Miranda Sawyer from &quot;Select&quot; named it Single of the Month, writing, Loser&#x27; is the winner (ha) because it&#x27;s unlike anything else. Strangled, ragged, fuzzed-out vocals squeeze alongside the swagger of a John Lee Hooker geetar and a hiccupy hip hop beat. You&#x27;ve never heard anything like it. It&#x27;s a pop song, too.&quot; Charles Aaron from &quot;Spin&quot; ranked the song number one in his list of the &quot;Top 20 Singles of the Year&quot;, adding that it &quot;was novelty-pop as generational statement like nothing else since &#x27;(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right to Party! Another &quot;Spin&quot; editor, Jay Stowe, wrote, &quot;An irresistible hook-line like &quot;I&#x27;m a loser, baby, so why don&#x27;t you kill me...?&quot; comes around maybe once a decade. So, hey, jump in the craze train. America&#x27;s browbeaten youth never had a more absurd—or honest—anthem.&quot;

==Impact and legacy==
&quot;Loser&quot; ranked first place in the 1994 &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll. In 2004, this song was ranked number 200 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In September 2010, Pitchfork Media included the song at number nine on their &quot;Top 200 Tracks of the 90s&quot;. In 2007, VH1 ranked it number 22 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 90&#x27;s&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked it number one on their list of the &quot;20 Greatest Beck Songs&quot;, and in 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the song number three on their list of the &quot;30 Greatest Beck Songs&quot;. In October 2023, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Loser&quot; number 235 in their &quot;500 Best Pop Songs of All Time&quot;.

==Unproduced &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic parody==

Around the time the song was released, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic had approached Beck asking for permission to record a parody called &quot;Schmoozer&quot;. At the time, Beck was just entering the music industry, and did not want his reputation to be seen as a one-hit wonder and refused the parody. Beck stated in 2022 that he wished he had given Yankovic permission, saying &quot;I think it would have been an amazing video, I&#x27;m actually really sad it didn&#x27;t happen.&quot; Despite the refusal, Yankovic was able to include a portion of the song in his polka medley called &quot;The Alternative Polka&quot;.

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for &quot;Loser&quot; was directed by Beck&#x27;s friend Steve Hanft. Hanft had worked for a week on storyboards for the video, then called a meeting with Beck&#x27;s label, Bong Load Records, and requested a $300 shooting budget. The unprocessed 16 mm film footage was frozen for 6 months until Beck signed with Geffen Records. Geffen gave Hanft $14,000 to process, edit, and master the video, making the budget total $14,300. Filming for the video was done all across California, including in Rothrock&#x27;s Humboldt County studio and backyard and at the Santa Monica graveyard. The video is a mashup of various 16 mm film clips. Beck insisted they were &quot;fucking around&quot; when they made the video; he told &quot;Option&quot; in 1994, &quot;We weren&#x27;t making anything slick – it was deliberately crude. You know?&quot;

Hanft, inspired by the Black Sabbath&#x27;s 16 mm film promo &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; and also surrealist filmmakers Luis Buñuel and Maya Deren, included stop-motion animation footage of a moving coffin in the video. Two coffins were used, one which was a prop borrowed from a local drama school and the other which had been built by Beck and Hanft. Clips and sounds sampled from Hanft&#x27;s 1991 Cal Arts, MFA thesis film, &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot;, about a loser stock car racer, are also included in the video and song. The moment where Beck is wearing a storm trooper mask is often censored for copyright reasons. The work&#x27;s only clip shot on video rather than film is the one depicting famous mountain dancer Jesco White wearing a white satin shirt and dancing on a picnic table. The clip was shot by director Julian Nitzberg and was added to the final cut on the last day of editing.
&quot;Loser&quot; ranked sixth in the music video category in the 1994 &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop poll.

The music video for Beck&#x27;s 2014 song &quot;Heart Is a Drum&quot; features characters from the &quot;Loser&quot; video, including the grim reaper, and another version of Beck in which he wears the white outfit from the &quot;Loser&quot; video. Also, two spacemen enter near the end of the &quot;Heart Is a Drum&quot; video as they ride away on the back of a pick up truck just as they do in the &quot;Kill the Moonlight&quot; film clip that was included in the &quot;Loser&quot; video.

<text>Lyle Martin Alzado (April 3, 1949 – May 14, 1992) was an American professional football player who was a defensive end of the National Football League (NFL), famous for his intense and intimidating style of play.

Alzado played for the Denver Broncos, the Cleveland Browns, and finally the Los Angeles Raiders with whom he won a championship in Super Bowl XVIII. He was a three-time All-Pro and two-time Pro Bowl selection during his career of 15 years.

==Early life==
Alzado was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn, New York to an Italian-Spanish father, Maurice, and a Jewish mother with a Russian family background, Martha Sokolow Alzado. He followed Judaism. When he was 10, the family moved to Cedarhurst, Long Island. His father, whom Alzado later described as &quot;a drinker and street fighter,&quot; left the family during Alzado&#x27;s sophomore year at Lawrence High School. He played high school football for three years.

==College career==
After he did not receive a college scholarship offer, Alzado played for Kilgore College, a community college in Kilgore, Texas. Two years after joining he was asked to leave the team; he later said it was for befriending a black teammate. He went to play for Yankton College in South Dakota. Though playing in relative obscurity in the NAIA, Alzado nonetheless gained notice by the NFL when Denver Broncos&#x27; coach and scout Stan Jones having been taken off the road by automobile trouble, decided to pass the time at nearby Montana Tech, one of Yankton&#x27;s opponents. Montana Tech&#x27;s coaches were showing him films of their star running back Don Heater, but Jones was impressed with the unknown defensive lineman Alzado squaring off against Montana Tech&#x27;s offense and passed back a favorable report to his team. The Broncos ultimately drafted Alzado in the fourth round of the 1971 draft. Alzado went back to Yankton after his rookie season to get his college degree. He received a B.A. in physical education with an emphasis in secondary education. During his college years, Alzado participated in amateur boxing making it to the semi-finals of the 1969 Midwest Golden Gloves Boxing Tournament, held in Omaha.

==NFL career==

===Denver Broncos===
When the Broncos&#x27; starting right defensive end Rich &quot;Tombstone&quot; Jackson was injured in 1971, Alzado took over the job and went on to make various All-rookie teams for his contributions of 60 tackles and 8 sacks. The following year, Alzado began to get national attention as he racked up 10½ sacks to go with his 91 tackles. In 1973, Alzado posted excellent numbers as the Broncos had a winning record for the first time in team history with a 7–5–2 mark.

In 1974, Alzado gained more notice as one publication named him All-AFC; with his 13 sacks and 80 tackles (eight for a loss), he was recognized as one of the NFL&#x27;s top defensive ends, along with Elvin Bethea, Jack Youngblood, L. C. Greenwood, Claude Humphrey, and Carl Eller. Bethea, Youngblood, Humphrey, and Eller are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Denver Broncos posted their second consecutive winning season, going 7–6–1.

The 1975 season brought change, as Alzado moved to defensive tackle. He responded with 91 tackles and 7 sacks. Alzado took a step backward as did the Broncos with a 6–8 record. On the first play of the 1976 season, Alzado blew out a knee and missed that campaign. The Broncos were 9–5 but SPORT magazine reported that 12 players, including Alzado, did not think the team could reach the playoffs with coach John Ralston. Ralston was replaced as coach by Red Miller for the 1977 season.

The 1977 season was the most successful in franchise history to that point; the Broncos had one of the NFL&#x27;s best defenses, went 12–2 and then beat the Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland Raiders - the team for which he later starred - in the playoffs to reach Super Bowl XII. In that game, played in New Orleans, they were beaten soundly 27–10 by the Dallas Cowboys. Still the year was a big success for Alzado, who was voted consensus All-Pro and consensus All-AFC as well as winning the UPI AFC Defensive Player of the Year. He also led the Broncos in sacks with 8, while making 80 tackles.

In 1978, the Broncos again went to the AFC playoffs, but lost the rematch in the first round to the eventual champion Pittsburgh Steelers. Alzado had 77 tackles and 9 sacks and recorded his first NFL safety. (Alzado recorded two more in his career, which ties him for second place all-time). He was 2nd team All-Pro and a consensus All-AFC pick. In 1979, he had a contract dispute, and the Broncos traded him to the Cleveland Browns.

===Cleveland Browns===
Alzado made the second-team All-AFC in 1979 playing defensive end. He had 80 tackles that year as well as seven sacks. The following year, the Browns won the AFC Central division, losing to the Raiders in the Divisional round. Alzado led the Browns in sacks with nine, and was All-Pro and All-AFC. In 1981 he recorded 83 tackles and led the Browns in sacks with 8½. However, the Browns, falling from 11–5 in 1980 to 5–11 in 1981, traded him to the Oakland Raiders in 1982.

===Los Angeles Raiders===
Being discarded by the Browns rekindled a fire in Alzado, and he worked out with a vengeance. By the time Alzado joined the Raiders, the team had relocated to Los Angeles. After demonstrating dominant play throughout the strike-shortened 9-game season of 1982, he was voted the NFL Comeback Player of the Year. He also recorded 7 sacks and 30 tackles while being voted All-AFC. That was the sixth season out of his first 12 campaigns that he received a post-season honor.

Alzado helped lead them to a Super Bowl victory in the 1983 season while recording 50 tackles and 7½ sacks. He started at right end opposite future Hall of Fame inductee Howie Long. Alzado also had an outstanding 1984 season with 63 tackles and 6 sacks, but the next year his tackle and sack totals dipped to 31 and 3 following a mid-season injury.

Alzado retired at the end of the 1985 season. He attempted a comeback in 1990, but injured a knee during training camp and was released. In 196 career games, he racked up 112 sacks, 24 forced fumbles, and nearly 1,000 tackles, while earning Pro Bowl honors in 1977 and 1978. After his retirement from playing, Alzado worked as a part-time color analyst for NBC&#x27;s NFL coverage in 1988–89.

In 2018, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Alzado to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2018.

==Style of play==
The man ESPN later labeled a &quot;...violent, combative player known for his short temper&quot;, inspired the league rule against throwing a helmet after having done so to an opponent&#x27;s helmet. Peter Alzado, Lyle&#x27;s brother, later identified the years of their youth – marked by an absent, alcoholic father and an overworked mother - as the crucible for Alzado&#x27;s unremittingly fierce style of play. &quot;That violence that you saw on the field was not real stuff,&quot; his brother held. &quot;Lyle used football as a way of expressing his anger at the world and at the way he grew up.&quot; Defensive end Greg Townsend, a teammate on the Raiders said that the savagery for which Alzado became noted represented part of a &quot;split personality.&quot; &quot;Off the field,&quot; remembered Townsend, &quot;he was the gentle giant: so caring, so warm, so giving.&quot;

==Outside football==
Alzado was an amateur boxer and, in 1979, fought an exhibition match against Muhammad Ali.

He was involved in &quot;countless youth organizations&quot;, receiving the Byron &quot;Whizzer&quot; White award for community service in 1977. He appeared in &quot;Stop the Madness&quot;, a 1985 anti-drug music video sponsored by the Reagan administration.

==Acting==
Alzado pursued an acting career in both movies and television, appearing mostly in youth-oriented comedy and adventure roles. His most notable film roles include the bully construction worker in &quot;Ernest Goes to Camp&quot; and the unstoppable killer in &quot;Destroyer&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All&quot; as a notorious bodyguard and rifleman. He played prison staff member Brawn in the 1990 film &quot;Club Fed&quot; and co-starred in the films &quot;Neon City&quot; and &quot;Oceans of Fire&quot;.

On television, Alzado appeared in a number of mid-1980s commercials for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; with &quot;Jack&quot;, who tries to help him perform the commercial correctly. He played himself, wearing his Raiders uniform, in the &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; episode &quot;Remote Control Man&quot; He also played himself in a 1988 episode of &quot;Small Wonder&quot;; he made a guest appearance on &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show&quot; in 1989. He starred in the sitcom &quot;Learning the Ropes&quot; as a high school teacher whose secret alter ego is a professional wrestler known as &quot;the Masked Maniac,&quot; alongside numerous NWA Wrestling stars. Alzado appeared in the series premiere of the short-lived 1991 sitcom &quot;Good Sports&quot; with Ryan O&#x27;Neal and Farrah Fawcett, and in episodes of &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; and &quot;MacGyver&quot;.

==Steroid use and death==
Alzado was one of the first major US sports figures to admit to using anabolic steroids. In the last year of his life, as he battled against the brain tumor which eventually caused his death, Alzado asserted that his steroid abuse directly led to his fatal illness. Alzado recounted his steroid abuse in an article in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;,

Lyle Alzado died on May 14, 1992, at age 43 after a battle with brain cancer. He was buried at River View Cemetery in Portland, Oregon.

==Hall of Fame==
Alzado was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 2008.

<text>Serafín Álvarez Quintero (March 26, 1871 – April 12, 1938) and Joaquín Álvarez Quintero (January 20, 1873 – June 14, 1944) were Spanish dramatists.

==Biography==

Born in Utrera, Seville Province in 1871 and 1873, they settled in Seville and worked as treasury employees, while collaborating on various publications such as , they gradually began their dedication to the theater. Their debut as authors took place in 1888 with at the Cervantes Theater in Seville. Their first stage piece, , was written in 1889. Other works include (1892), (1894), (1895), (1897), and (1898), (1900), and (1907), (1909), and (1915). Both brothers were members of the Royal Spanish Academy.

Their first resounding success was in 1897 with , this success was followed by many others, consisting of (1901), (1906), (1912), (1912), (1908), and much later, (1930). They were named the favorite brothers of Utrera and Seville. They performed in the most remote areas of the spanish speaking world, such as in the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires, by the Guerrero-Mendoza company that carried several of their works when the theater was built, due to this the brothers enjoyed innumerable tributes, making their works well-known into the 1920s.

Both were imprisoned at the beginning of the Civil War in El Escorial. Serafín would die of natural causes in 1938, and Melchor Rodríguez García had to intercede to allow Serafin&#x27;s sister to bring a crucifix to his coffin, as had Serafín wished, but had been given refusal by militiamen at the mortuary house. Joaquín would die in 1944, and the remains of both rest in the San Justo Cemetery in Madrid.

They were also famous for having tried to transcribe Andalusian dialects to written form.

==Work==
Although they did not only write comedies (such as , etc...), skits (such as , 1905), zarzuela operas (such as , 1903) and comic pieces, but also dramas (such as , 1912, , 1924), it was in these genres that they are best remembered because of their comic talent. In total they wrote nearly two hundred titles, some of them awarded, such as , which received the Royal Academy Award for Best Comedy of the Year. Their last joint work was , a zarzuela by José Padilla.

Many of their pieces are of a costumbrismo nature, describing what it&#x27;s like being from their native Andalusian lands, but leaving aside the gloomy and miserable vision of social ills. According to Francisco Ruiz Ramón in (, 1995), &quot;the basic assumptions of this theater are those of a naive naturalistic realism&quot;. In the thirties their art was used in the cinema, creating several scripts for the films of the mythical Estrellita Castro. They did not contribute any substantial technical or structural novelty, but they refined Andalusianism in the same way that Carlos Arniches did. In Madrid, However, they never went further indepth with their social ideas, which stops at tenderness and melodramatics. In short, they are bourgeois comedies that offer an idealized and friendly vision of Andalusia that does not worry the average viewer; the joy of living silences any hint of dramatic conflict. It was this joie de vivre that saved the theater of the Quintero brothers from critics such as Ramón Pérez de Ayala, José Martínez Ruiz and Luis Cernuda.

Their Complete Works were published in Madrid: , 1918-1947, in forty-two volumes.

<text>One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (stylised on screen as ...one of our aircraft is missing) is a 1942 British black-and-white war film, mainly set in the German-occupied Netherlands. It was the fourth collaboration between the British writer-director-producer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger and the first film they made under the banner of The Archers.

Although considered a propaganda film and made under the authority of the Ministry of Information as part of a series of film productions aimed at morale in the United Kingdom, it is elevated by the story and production values above the usual jingoistic fare. Today, &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; is considered one of the &quot;best of British films of the era&quot;.

A reversal of the plot of Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s previous film, &quot;49th Parallel&quot; (1941), &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; has the British trying to escape with the help of various locals. In the &quot;49th Parallel&quot;, the Germans stranded in Canada argued and fought amongst themselves, while the British fliers in this film work well together as a team.

==Plot==
The crew of an Royal Air Force (RAF) Wellington bomber are forced to bail out over the Netherlands near the Zuider Zee after one of their engines is damaged during a night raid on Stuttgart. Five of the six airmen find each other; the sixth goes missing. The first Dutch citizens they encounter, led by English-speaking school teacher Else Meertens, are suspicious at first as no aircraft is reported to have crashed in the Netherlands (the abandoned bomber actually reaches England before crashing). After much debate and some questioning, the Dutch agree to help, despite their fear of German reprisals.

Accompanied by many of the Dutch, the disguised airmen, led by the pilots, bicycle through the countryside to a football match where they are passed along to the local burgomaster. To their astonishment, they discover their missing crewman playing for one of the teams. Reunited, they hide in a truck carrying supplies to Jo de Vries.

De Vries pretends to be pro-German, blaming the British for killing her husband in a bombing raid (whereas he is actually in England working as a radio announcer). She hides them in her mansion, despite the Germans being garrisoned there. Under cover of an air raid, she leads them to a rowing boat. The men row undetected to the sea, but a bridge sentry finally spots them and a shot seriously wounds the oldest man, Sir George Corbett but they reach the North Sea.

They take shelter in a German rescue buoy, where they take two shot-down enemy aviators prisoner but not before one sends a radio message. By chance, two British boats arrive first. Because Corbett cannot be moved, they simply tow the buoy back to England. Three months later, he is fully recovered and the crew board their new four-engine heavy bomber, a Short Stirling.

==Production==
The title &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; is taken from a phrase that was often heard in contemporary news reports in the UK after a bombing raid, &quot;one [or often more] of our aircraft failed to return&quot;, which originally served as the working title of the screenplay but was then altered to a less-downbeat form. Although the screenplay was not completely developed by the time of production, Powell considered it &quot;half-finished ... it remained (that way) for most of the production.&quot; One of the reasons for continual revisions to the screenplay were the constant advances in wartime technology that were occurring.

The Admiralty informed the producers and directors of the use of &quot;lobster pots&quot;, floating steel platforms, hitherto unknown to the public, that had been anchored in the North Sea to facilitate rescue of downed airmen. When Powell learned of this innovation, he pointedly rewrote the screenplay to include this refuge as the means to deliver the crew to safety. With help from the Ministry of Information, permission to use these platforms was obtained.

The actors that were gathered for the film included recognised stage and screen talents such as Eric Portman, Hugh Williams and Godfrey Tearle as well as newcomers such as Peter Ustinov making his film debut. Although mainly centred on male roles, Powell encouraged Pressburger to create a number of significant female characters. The result were strong, credible roles for both Pamela Brown and Googie Withers as female Dutch Resistance leaders. The main leads, Hugh Burden, Eric Portman, Hugh Williams, Emrys Jones, Bernard Miles, and Godfrey Tearle, formed the crew of &quot;B for Bertie&quot; and introduced themselves and their characters&#x27; positions on board the bomber in a progressive sequence that was filmed, like most of the aircraft interiors, in a Vickers Wellington &quot;shell&quot; supplied by the RAF, with working features such as lighting and electrically powered turrets.
To maintain an aura of authenticity, actual RAF bombers on &quot;ops&quot; (operations) were filmed but the aerial scene of the bombing of Stuttgart was created using a large-scale model at Riverside Studios, Hammersmith. The giant Wellington replica actually covered the entire studio floor and was rigged with lights and fitted for effects shots including explosions. On screen, the effect was striking and realistically duplicated the flight and bombing raid carried out at the start of the film. Much of the outdoor sequences set in the Netherlands were shot at Boston in Lincolnshire, with many of the town&#x27;s landmarks visible, for example, Shodfriars Quay and the railway swing bridge. Notably, there is no scored music, Powell deliberately strove for &quot;naturalism&quot; relying on natural sounds that would be heard by the characters. The Dutch national anthem, &quot;Wilhelmus&quot;, is heard during the film as part of the campaign of passive resistance by the population, and the film finishes with the coat of arms of the Netherlands on screen while the opening bars of the anthem are sung by a choir. &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; was cut by 20 minutes for its original American release.

==Reception==
===Box office===
According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the film was one of the most popular at the British box office in 1942, after &quot;Mrs Miniver&quot;, &quot;First of the Few&quot;, &quot;How Green was My Valley&quot;, &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot;, &quot;Holiday Inn&quot;, &quot;Captains of the Clouds&quot;, and &quot;Sergeant York&quot; and before &quot;Hatter&#x27;s Castle&quot; and &quot;Young Mr Pitt&quot;.

===Awards===
Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and Ronald Neame (photography) and C. C. Stevens (sound) for Best Effects, Special Effects. Powell&#x27;s nomination was his only Academy Award nomination – Pressburger won an Academy Award for &quot;49th Parallel&quot; and was nominated for &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; as well.

&quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; joins other British war films as one of the most &quot;well-remembered, accomplished, and enjoyed&quot; realist films of the period.

In 2014, &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; was included in a set of war films packaged together and sold to raise funds for The Royal British Legion veterans organisation.

==In popular culture==

&quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot; is mentioned in the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; episode &quot;The Lion Has Phones&quot;. When Lance-Corporal Jones tries to ring up GHQ, he mistakenly gets the cinema, whose operator tells him the film is on. There is a mention of Eric Portman and Googie Withers. A poster for the film is on display at the cinema. Correspondingly, in the episode of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Time on My Hands&quot;, Pike knows how to open a parachute because, he says, he&#x27;s seen it done in &quot;One of Our Aircraft Is Missing&quot;. The episode &quot;Sons of the Sea&quot; also contains numerous elements from this film.
In the James Bond film &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;, after dispatching an attack helicopter sent by SPECTRE, 007 observes, &quot;I&#x27;d say one of their aircraft is missing.&quot;

<text>The Volunteer (1944) is a short black-and-white British film by the filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger for the U.K. Ministry of Information. Made during World War II as recruitment propaganda for the Fleet Air Arm, volunteer numbers rose after its release.

The films features actor Ralph Richardson starring in a West End production of &quot;Othello&quot;. Pat McGrath plays his dresser, who joins the Fleet Air Arm and becomes a war hero – as famous as Richardson himself. British film stars Anna Neagle and Laurence Olivier make cameo appearances, as does director Michael Powell and fellow British film director Anthony Asquith.

This film was one of a highly-regarded series of war-time film collaborations between Powell and Pressburger - together often known as The Archers, the name of their production company - which also included &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943) &quot;I Know Where I&#x27;m Going!&quot; (1945) and &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946).

The film is available as a supplement to The Criterion Collection DVD of the 1941 Powell and Pressburger film &quot;49th Parallel&quot; and on the BFI 2021 blu-ray edition of the 1942 Powell and Pressburger film &quot;One of Our Aircraft is Missing&quot;.

<text>Ronnie Scott OBE (born Ronald Schatt; 28 January 1927 – 23 December 1996) was a British jazz tenor saxophonist and jazz club owner. He co-founded Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London&#x27;s Soho district, in 1959.

==Life and career==
Ronnie Scott was born in Aldgate, East London, into a Jewish family. His father, Joseph Schatt, was of Russian ancestry, and his mother Sylvia&#x27;s family attended the Portuguese synagogue in Alie Street. Scott attended the Central Foundation Boys&#x27; School.

Scott began playing in small jazz clubs at the age of 16. He toured with trumpeter Johnny Claes from 1944 to 1945 and with Ted Heath in 1946. That same year, he appeared as one of the band members in &quot;George in Civvy Street&quot;. He worked with Ambrose, Cab Kaye, and Tito Burns. He was involved in the short-lived musicians&#x27; co-operative Club Eleven band and club (1948–50) with Johnny Dankworth. Scott became an acquaintance of the arranger/composer Tadd Dameron, when the American was working in the UK for Heath, and is reported to have performed with Dameron as the pianist, at one Club Eleven gig.

Scott was a member of the generation of British musicians who worked on the Cunard liner &quot;Queen Mary&quot; intermittently from 1946 to around 1950. The ship would sail to New York City where they were exposed to Bebop, the new form of jazz being played in the clubs there. Scott was among the earliest British musicians to have been influenced by Charlie Parker and other players of modern jazz.

In 1952, Scott joined Jack Parnell&#x27;s orchestra and from 1953 to 1956 led a nine-piece band and quintet which included Pete King, with whom he later opened his jazz club, Victor Feldman, Hank Shaw, and Phil Seamen. He co-led The Jazz Couriers with Tubby Hayes from 1957 to 1959 and was leader of a quartet that included Stan Tracey (1960–67).

From 1967 to 1969, Scott was a member of the Kenny Clarke/Francy Boland Big Band, which toured Europe and included Johnny Griffin and Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis. Simultaneously he ran his octet, which included John Surman and Kenny Wheeler, and a trio with Mike Carr on keyboards and Bobby Gien on drums (1971–1975). Scott&#x27;s other bands often included John Critchinson on keyboards and Martin Drew on drums. He did occasional session work, which included performing the solo on &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, the 1968 single by the Beatles, playing on Roy Budd&#x27;s score for the film &quot;Fear Is the Key&quot; (1972), and performing the tenor sax solo on &quot;I Missed Again&quot;, the 1981 single by Phil Collins.

In the 1981 New Year Honours, Scott was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to jazz music.

Charles Mingus said of him in 1961, &quot;Of the white boys, Ronnie Scott gets closer to the negro blues feeling, the way Zoot Sims does.&quot; Scott recorded infrequently during the last few decades of his career. He suffered from depression. While recovering from surgery for tooth implants, he died at the age of 69 from an accidental overdose of barbiturate prescribed by his dentist. The Westminster coroner&#x27;s inquest in February 1997 recorded a verdict of &#x27;death by misadventure&#x27;.

Ronnie Scott&#x27;s widow, Mary Scott, and her daughter, Rebecca Scott, wrote the memoir &quot;A Fine Kind of Madness: Ronnie Scott Remembered&quot;, with a foreword by Spike Milligan. The book was published in 1999 in London by Headline Book Publishing.

==Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club==
Scott is perhaps best remembered for co-founding, with former tenor sax player Pete King, Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club, which opened on 30 October 1959 in a basement at 39 Gerrard Street in London&#x27;s Soho district, with the debut of a young alto sax player named Peter King (no relation), before later moving to a larger venue nearby at 47 Frith Street in 1965. The original venue continued in operation as the &quot;Old Place&quot; until the lease ran out in 1967, and was used for performances by the up-and-coming generation of domestic musicians.

Scott regularly acted as the club&#x27;s genial master of ceremonies, and was noted for his repertoire of jokes, asides and one-liners. A typical introduction might go: &quot;Our next guest is one of the finest musicians in the country. In the city, he&#x27;s crap&quot;. Another memorable announcement was: &quot;Next week we&#x27;re proud to have a quartet featuring Stan Getz and violinist Stuff Smith. It&#x27;s called the &#x27;Getz-Stuffed quartet&#x27;.&quot; Ronnie often used in later days the services of John Schatt to book rock bands for Ronnie Scott&#x27;s upstairs.

Ronnie Scott told Showbusiness journalist Don Short in 1970: &quot;Pop has poached on jazz without apology. That may irritate many jazzmen, but not me. I would never lose any sleep over it. It’s for the fans to choose the music they want to hear. I play. I don’t attempt to convert. But many young people are discovering just how hip jazz is.”

After Scott&#x27;s death, King continued to run the club for a further nine years, before selling the club to theatre impresario Sally Greene in June 2005.

In September 2013, while the club was being redecorated, a 12-metre-square (39 ft2) hoarding was placed on the Frith Street façade as a tribute to its eponymous founder, bearing a giant photograph of Ronnie Scott by Val Wilmer, alongside one of his one-liners: &quot;I love this place, it&#x27;s just like home, filthy and full of strangers.&quot;

<text>Gaudete Sunday ( ) is the third Sunday of Advent in the liturgical calendar of Western Christianity, including the Roman Catholic Church, the Anglican Communion, Lutheran churches, and other mainline Protestant churches. It can fall on any date from 11 December to 17 December.

==Gaudete==
The day takes its common name from the Latin word &quot;Gaudete&quot; (&quot;Rejoice&quot;), the first word of the introit of this day&#x27;s Mass:
==Background==

The season of Advent originated as a fast of 40 days in preparation for Christmas, commencing on the day after the feast of Saint Martin (11 November), whence it was often called &quot;Saint Martin&#x27;s Lent&quot;, a name by which it was known as early as the fifth century. In the ninth century, the duration of Advent was reduced to four weeks (a period starting four Sundays before Christmas), and Advent preserved most of the characteristics of a penitential season, which made it a kind of counterpart to Lent. Gaudete Sunday is a counterpart to Laetare Sunday, and provides a similar break about midway through a season which is otherwise of a penitential character, and signifies the nearness of the Lord&#x27;s coming.

The spirit of the liturgy throughout Advent is one of expectation and preparation for the feast of Christmas as well as for the second coming of Christ, and the penitential exercises suitable to that spirit are thus on Gaudete Sunday suspended, as it were, for a while, in order to symbolize that joy and gladness in the promised Redemption.

==Theme==
While the theme of Advent is a focus on the coming of Jesus in three ways: his first, his present, and his final Advent, the readings for Gaudete Sunday deal with rejoicing in the Lord – Christian joy – as well as the mission of John the Baptist and his connection with Advent. The theologian Thomas Aquinas described the difference between joy and happiness. Happiness is the final end of man, eternal contemplation of God, which is an act of the intellect. Joy, however, is itself not a virtue, but is an effect of the virtue of charity (&quot;love&quot;), which is full if its object is eternal and the greatest, i.e. God. Joy admits no sorrow for it is not an act of the sensitive faculties, e.g. enjoying food is a natural joy for Thomas, but supernatural joy which is spoken of on Gaudete Sunday and in the Gospels is an act of the intellectual appetite known as the will.

In his 2014 Gaudete Sunday homily, Pope Francis said that Gaudete Sunday is known as the &quot;Sunday of joy&quot;, and that instead of fretting about &quot;all they still haven&#x27;t&quot; done to prepare for Christmas, people should &quot;think of all the good things life has given you.&quot;

==Liturgical colour==

On Gaudete Sunday rose-coloured vestments may be worn instead of violet (or instead of deep blue, in some Anglican and Lutheran traditions), which is otherwise prescribed for every day in the season of Advent. Gaudete Sunday was also known as &quot;Rose Sunday&quot;.

In churches that have an Advent wreath, the rose-coloured candle is lit in addition to two of the violet- or blue-coloured candles, which represent the first two Sundays of Advent. Despite the otherwise somber readings of the season of Advent, which has as a secondary theme the need for penitence, the readings on the third Sunday emphasize the joyous anticipation of the Lord&#x27;s coming.

In Anglicanism, the use of rose-pink, previously informally observed, was formally noted as an option in the Church of England in the Common Worship liturgical renewal.

<text>The Democratic Party (, PD; also known as &quot;Partidul Democrat-Frontul Salvării Naționale&quot; or PD-FSN for short) was a social democratic and, later on, liberal conservative political party in Romania. In January 2008, it merged with the Liberal Democratic Party (PLD), a splinter group of the National Liberal Party (PNL), to form the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL).

From 1996 to 2005, the party was a member of the Socialist International (SI). Its official name was Democratic Party - National Salvation Front until 2000, when it officially shortened its name only to the Democratic Party. From 2004 to 2007, the PD was the junior member of the governing Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), although according to many Romanian opinion polls of the time, it remained the most popular of the two parties. Although it had to formally suspend his leadership to the party when elected president in 2004, the PD was largely associated with former Romanian president Traian Băsescu.

== History ==

In early 1992, conflict broke out between FSN leaders Ion Iliescu and Petre Roman and this led to the separation of the Iliescu wing under the name of the Democratic National Salvation Front (FDSN), which later became the Party of Social Democracy in Romania (PDSR) and then eventually the Social Democratic Party (PSD).

FSN was defeated by the FDSN in the 1992 general election and consequently spent the next four years in opposition. In 1993, the FSN changed its name to the Democratic Party (PD). In the 1996 general election, the PD jointly ran with the now-defunct Romanian Social Democratic Party (PSDR), under the Social Democratic Union (USD) banner. After having ranked third, they joined a governing coalition with the Romanian Democratic Convention (CDR) and the ethnic Hungarian party Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ). From 2000 to 2004, PD has been again in opposition. It also began to move from social democracy to conservatism and Christian democracy. When PDSR and PSDR merged in 2001 to form the Social Democratic Party (PSD), PD was invited by both Adrian Năstase and Alexandru Athanasiu to join the new PSD, but PD president Traian Băsescu refused to take part in the merger. In May 2002, the PD absorbed part of the local Socialist Party of National Renaissance subsidiaries (a left-wing nationalist splinter of the Greater Romania Party).

In advance of the 2004 elections, the PD joined forces with the National Liberal Party (PNL) to create the Justice and Truth Alliance (DA), whose main purpose was to fight the all-dominating PSD. The DA managed to win around 32% of the votes in both Chambers, not enough for a majority and about 6% less than the PSD. Together with its liberal allies, the UDMR/RMDSZ, and the Conservative Party (PC), the PD was part of the governing coalition until April 2007.

During a congress in 2005, PD members voted in favor of joining the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and abandoning the Party of European Socialists (PES) and the Socialist International (SI). In the same year, Petre Roman left the party and, together with his followers, formed the Democratic Force (FD).

From mid-2005, the PD&#x27;s relations with the PNL became strained due to an ongoing open conflict between former President Băsescu and then Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, who was also the chairman of the PNL. Previously, after his presidential victory in 2004, Băsescu appointed Popescu-Tăriceanu as Prime Minister. Although he wanted to, he could not constitutionally dismiss him; at least, it took him a while to do so. On 1 April 2007, Tăriceanu dismissed the ministers of the PD and formed a minority government.

On 15 December 2007, the PD merged with the Liberal Democratic Party (PLD) to form the Democratic Liberal Party (PDL).

==Ideology and policies==
Under the leadership of Petre Roman, the PD represented the reformist social democratic wing resulting from the split of the FSN in 1992. Despite the clear ideological positioning, several observers did not notice substantial programmatic differences between the documents presented by the reformist and left-wing conservative currents that confronted each other during the national conference of the FSN in March 1992. In the following years, the PD ran against Iliescu’s group, represented by the FDSN, PDSR and PSD parties, to win the same type of electorate linked to the centre-left. Petre Roman’s party was, however, distinguished by the stance of its president, who stressed his supposed attachment to a true social democracy, far removed from the influences of proletarian socialism inherited from Communist dictatorship. Although it approached the centre-right forces, with which it formed a coalition government between 1996 and 2000, the party continued to share some of its objectives with the centre-left parties that were in opposition. As the direct successor of the FSN, the PD borrowed both its symbol, a rose, and its identifying colour, blue.

After the PD joined the Socialist International in 1996, it continued to maintain the social democratic outlook even after the election of Traian Băsescu as president, who was elected head of the party in 2001 with the motion «Strong Romania - Social democratic Romania». The party made clear that its policy should be oriented towards the needs of the people, supporting a competitive socio-economic framework but focusing on social protection and security of citizens. 

After Băsescu took over the leadership of the Democratic Party, it successfully used anti-communist, anti-corruption, anti-PDSR and pro-European populist rhetoric and strategies. While Petre Roman wanted a conditional cooperation with the ruling Social Democracy Party of Romania (PDSR), Băsescu opted for a total, uncompromising opposition to the PDSR and its successor, the Social Democratic Party (PSD), despite the fact that both had, nominally, the same political ideology.

After 2003, a new approach to the centre-right, with the birth of an alliance with the PNL, contributed to a decisive change in its doctrinal orientation. In the 2004 elections, Traian Băsescu’s pro-European and anti-corruption message reached mainly young people and residents of the urban areas and the north-west of the country, an electorate traditionally linked to the centre-right. Favored by Băsescu and the new president Emil Boc, the shift to the centre-right was officially realized in 2005, with the adoption of a political program explicitly based on popular and conservative doctrine.
The political doctrine of the Democratic Party (PD) shifted from social democracy to social conservatism in 2005. The party supported the consolidation of the free market and is supportive of Romania&#x27;s flat tax rate of 16%. The party also supported reforming the Romanian Constitution in order to bring about decentralization in administration and give greater power to the eight development regions.

In terms of European politics, the Democratic Party (PD):

* Supported EU enlargement to the Western Balkans;
* Supported EU membership for Turkey, as long as it satisfied membership criteria;
* Supported the accession of the Republic of Moldova to the EU;
* Supported the Treaty of Lisbon;
* Believed that the European Parliament should have greater power;
* Opposed a reform of the Common Agricultural Policy;
* Supported a common EU migration policy;
* Supported a common EU defence and security policy;
* Supported a partnership between the US and the EU, where the EU is an &quot;equal and critical&quot; partner.

The motion that allowed the appointment of Boc, «Prosperous Romania, democratic Romania» («România prosperă, România democrată») was approved by 3,553 votes to 114 and provided for an important ideological reorientation, by adhering to the Christian-democratic popular doctrine at the expense of the social democratic one, officially transforming the party into a centre-right formation, a choice which according to Boc reflected the political lines adopted by the PD in previous years. The party group which would have preferred to continue to uphold the social democratic ideology, represented by vice-presidents Cezar Preda and Radu Berceanu, was unable to present any candidacy for the presidency, as it was not supported by at least ten branches, as provided for in the Statutes.

As Boc pointed out, the document was based on the recognition of the need for a market economy and support for social justice principles. According to his statements, the new programme was designed to adapt the official ideological positioning to the political line of action pursued by the PD in the years following the election of Băsescu. According to Boc, the text included 80% of the document «Strong Romania forte - Social democratic Romania». In 2007 the PD self-defined itself as a «centrist-republican party, with a modern European doctrine whose principles are: an efficient, humane and supportive market economy, modern and quality public services, extensive, active and precise social protection in accordance with an independent justice, accessible and safe». Adherence to popular doctrine led to the adoption of orange, borrowed from the EPP, as the official colour alongside blue. The Democratic Party also started to endorse neoliberal economic policies.

According to some analysts, the new ideological orientation was also determined by political dynamics at European level. In 2005 the Party of European Socialists refused to recognize the PD as a full member, but admitted the PSD instead. The refusal, accompanied by an attitude of the PES aimed at favouring the PSD also in internal political matters, had led the PD to turn to the European People’s Party which, on the other hand, needed new members to strengthen its political position in the European Parliament as opposed to the socialists. Beyond the ideological repositioning, after 2004 the PD was above all a pragmatic party and an expression of Băsescu’s presidential policy.

<text>Fernando de Toledo (–1591) was a Spanish nobleman.

He was the illegitimate and first son of Don Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, &quot;The Iron Duke&quot;, who fathered Fernando de Toledo upon the daughter of a miller of La Aldehuela, in the province of Ávila, Spain.

Not until 1546, when Fernando was nineteen years old, did the duke recognize Fernando as his son. This later became the subject of a comedy written by the great Spanish playwright Félix Lope de Vega y Carpio; the title of the play, &quot;Más mal hay en La Aldegüela de lo que sueña&quot; means approximately, &quot;There are worse things in Aldehuela than you have dreamt of&quot;.

Fernando Toledo was a prior of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Castile and León. He was Captain General of the cavalry of Flanders and Portugal, member of the Council of State, and (from 1571 to 1580) Viceroy of Catalonia, succeeding Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y de la Cerda (also known as Diego de Mendoza y de la Cerda, 2nd Count of Mélito, 1st Duke of Francavilla), who had been viceroy from 1564 to 1571.

<text>The End of the River is a 1947 British drama film made in Belém, Brazil about a Brazilian Indian boy who leaves the jungle for the city, where he is accused of murder. It was directed by Derek Twist and written by Wolfgang Wilhelm, based on a novel by Desmond Holdridge. The film stars Sabu and Bibi Ferreira.

The film was produced by Powell &amp; Pressburger, the famous filmmaking duo known as &quot;The Archers&quot;. It was filmed mainly on location, along the upper sections of the Amazon River.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Radio Times&quot; described the film as &quot;A curio,&quot; and concluded, &quot;Despite a good cast and the Brazilian locations, the results are both confusing and disappointing&quot;; and &quot;TV Guide&quot; similarly found &quot;A confusing, mediocre film shot in Brazil, with little to recommend it to audiences elsewhere&quot;; whereas &quot;Britmovie&quot; found more to admire, and wrote, &quot;Sabu is well suited for the role with his Indian good looks. He executes a credible performance...Bibi Ferreira is stunningly beautiful as his love interest...Esmond Knight, Orlando Martins, Robert Douglas, and Torin Thatcher all turn in solid performances...Even though parts of the story remain weak, the scenery definitely makes up for it. Christopher Challis is the cinematographer and he successfully portrays the life of the natives in the lush subtropical forests in Brazil.&quot;

<text>The Battle of Ash Hollow, also known as the Battle of Blue Water Creek or the Harney Massacre, was an engagement of the First Sioux War, fought on September 2 and 3, 1855, between United States Army soldiers under Brig. Gen. William S. Harney and a band of the Brulé Lakota along the Platte River in present-day Garden County, Nebraska. In the 20th century, the town of Lewellen, Nebraska, was developed here as a railroad stop.

The American force won the battle: the Brulé women and children they killed made up nearly half the fatalities; other women and children made up most of the prisoners they took. The Army planned this punitive expedition in retaliation for the &quot;Grattan Massacre&quot; in August 1854, and for raids by Lakota in its wake.

==Overview==
The battle was the defining engagement of a short war between the US and the Lakota Sioux over disputes concerning violations of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. In this battle 600 soldiers attacked 250 Sioux, killing 86 and capturing 70 women and children.

In March 1856, without authority to do so, commanding Gen. William Harney negotiated a peace treaty to stop further bloodshed with the Sioux. He required a centralized tribal government among the Lakota, by which he intended to hold leaders accountable for the actions of bands. The people were highly decentralized.

While the battle was hailed by many newspapers as a heroic victory over the Indians, the &quot;New York Times&quot; called it a massacre and other critics decried it as &quot;outright butchery,&quot; because of the killings of numerous women and children.
The lamentable butcheries of Indians by Harney&#x27;s command on the Plains have excited the most painful feelings,&quot; wrote a &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent in an 1855 dispatch from Washington. &quot;The so-called battle was simply a massacre, but whether those Indians were really the same who have cut off emigrant trains with so many circumstances of savage cruelty, or whether it is possible to distinguish between the innocent and the guilty in retaliating these outrages, are points on which we have no reliable information.
Some others claimed that the battle was fought only to justify growth in the American army, which was being encouraged by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis.

==Background==
=== Grattan “Massacre” ===

The first decisive event that initialized the First Sioux war was catalyzed when a Mormon emigrant lost a cow while traveling with his party on the Oregon Trail; the animal wandered into a Brulé Lakota camp. A Miniconjou Sioux named High Forehead killed the cow for food. The Mormon farmer reported the cow as stolen to army officers at Fort Laramie.

The fort&#x27;s commander sent out an inexperienced officer, Lt. John Lawrence Grattan—said to be contemptuous of the Indians—to arrest High Forehead. But under the treaty of 1851, such matters related to livestock and relations with settlers were supposed to be handled by the Indian Agent, who was due to arrive soon. Grattan vowed to take the wanted Indian &quot;at all hazards&quot; and took along 30 men and artillery. He pressed the chief to surrender the Sioux man. One of his soldiers shot the chief, Conquering Bear, in the back and killed him. In the ensuing battle the Sioux killed Grattan and 29 of his men. One soldier survived the fighting but died later in the Fort Laramie hospital.

President Franklin Pierce vowed to avenge the Grattan Massacre, as it was called by the press. The War Department appointed Harney to command, with instructions to &quot;whip the Indians.&quot; In the ensuing debate, Grattan was blamed for the fracas in which he and the men under his command were killed.

=== Harney Expedition ===
The Harney expedition finally set out in August 1855. On September 1, 1855, the expedition caught up with a Sioux encampment along the Platte River in a place known as Blue Waters. Harney sent a regiment in a long night flanking maneuver to set up a blocking position against which he would drive the Sioux. The flanking maneuver was led by Lt. Col. Philip St. George Cooke and Capt. Henry Heth.

Harney moved up in the morning to drive the Sioux against Cooke and Heth. He first attempted to parlay with the Sioux chief, Little Thunder, but his demands to hand over the men responsible for the Grattan attack were rebuffed. The Sioux felt justified in having killed Grattan and his men, as they had shot first. During the parlay, several Sioux braves discovered Cooke&#x27;s men.

==Battle==
Upon the Sioux discovery of Cooke&#x27;s men, Harney opened the fight by attacking the Sioux camp. Some of the Sioux took refuge in caves along the river. Harney had his men fire into the caves, where they killed many women and children. A large group of mounted warriors rode toward an escape route away from Cooke&#x27;s and Harney&#x27;s forces, but Heth saw them and led his forces to block them.

The warriors broke through Heth&#x27;s men, but were pursued on horseback by cavalry with Heth in the lead. They had a running fight for about five miles, which lasted several hours. At some point Heth got so far ahead of his men that he was presumed killed in action. His death was reported in newspapers around the country and he later took satisfaction in the obituaries his friends had written. The American forces were victorious, killing 86 Sioux and taking 70 prisoners, mostly women and children. Women and children also accounted for about half of the Sioux deaths.

Among other American participants of the battle was Gouverneur K. Warren. He wrote in his diary about the horror of killing native women and children.. John Buford also fought with the Americans. Both became Union generals during the American Civil War. 

Afterward, the army made a wide sweep of the surrounding Sioux country but encountered no further resistance. The Sioux called Harney &quot;The Butcher&quot; for the battle at Blue Water, &quot;the Hornet&quot; for invading their territory, and &quot;the Big Chief Who Swears&quot; for the treaty he forced. Following this battle, there were about ten years of peace between the US and the Sioux. The latter tried to ignore the many emigrants on the Oregon Trail, which passed through their territory. The emigrants took game, plants, and water that the Sioux themselves needed for survival.

==Legacy==
After this battle, one of the expedition renamed &quot;Hinhan Kaga,&quot; the highest peak in the sacred Black Hills, as Harney Peak for the commander of the military unit. But the expedition had not come within five miles of it, and the Lakota resented this sacred peak being named after a man who had killed so many innocents.

Although the Great Sioux Reservation was established in 1868 under another Treaty of Fort Laramie, which included the territory of West River and preserved the sacred Black Hills for the Lakota, within several years gold was discovered in the hills. The US violated its treaty, taking over the Black Hills and other property to enable European-American development. In 1889 the government broke up the Great Sioux Reservation into five smaller ones, and sold off 9,000,000 acres of former Lakota communal land.

In 2016 the United States Board on Geographic Names renamed Harney Peak as Black Elk Peak.

<doc id="1273556" wikidata="Q2072049" url="?curid=1273556" title="Yidam">
<text>A yidam or iṣṭadevatā is a meditational deity that serves as a focus for meditation and spiritual practice, said to be manifestations of Buddhahood or enlightened mind. Yidams are an integral part of Vajrayana, including both Tibetan Buddhism and Shingon, which emphasize the use of esoteric practices and rituals to attain enlightenment more swiftly. The yidam is one of the three roots of the inner refuge formula and is also the key element of deity yoga. Yidam is sometimes translated by the term &quot;tutelary deity&quot;.

A yidam is considered to be a manifestation of enlightened qualities and a means to connect with specific aspects of the enlightened mind. The yidam is visualized during meditation in intricate detail, with the aim of internalizing its qualities and attributes. This practice is intended to facilitate the practitioner&#x27;s transformation and realization of their own innate enlightened nature. It is believed to help purify the mind, accumulate positive karma, and ultimately lead to the realization of emptiness and the nature of reality.

During personal meditation practice (&quot;sādhana&quot;), the yogi identifies their own form, attributes and mind with those of a yidam for the purpose of transformation. Yidam practices can vary greatly depending on the specific deity chosen, the lineage, and the teachings followed. The visualization, recitation of mantras, and engagement with the symbolic attributes of the yidam are common elements of these practices.

Examples of yidams include the meditation deities Chakrasamvara, Kalachakra, Hevajra, Yamantaka, and Vajrayogini, all of whom have a distinctive iconography, mandala, mantra, rites of invocation and practice. Overall, yidam practices are a distinctive feature of Vajrayana, emphasizing the importance of personal connection with and transformation through specific enlightened aspects.

==Etymology==
Yidam is said to be a contraction of Tib. &quot;yid-kyi-dam-tshig&quot;, meaning &quot;samaya of mind&quot; or in other words, the state of being indestructibly bonded with the inherently pure and liberated nature of mind. This is said to be the act that balances energies coursing within the pranic ida and pingala channels in the subtle bodies of both participants. The practitioner focuses on and identifies with the resultant Buddha-form or &#x27;meditation deity&#x27;, the yidam (Tibetan) associated with IDA channel.

The Sanskrit word &#x27; or &#x27; a compound of &quot;iṣṭa&quot; (desired, liked, reverenced) + &quot;devatā&quot; (a deity or divine being) is a term associated with yidam in many popular books on Buddhist Tantra but has not been attested in any Buddhist tantric text in Sanskrit.

==Conceptual framework==

The yidam&#x27;s role extends into the framework of the Three Roots within Tibetan Buddhism, a concept that holds deep significance in Vajrayana practice. This concept places the yidam as one of the Three Roots in the &#x27;Inner&#x27; refuge formulation, underscoring its essential place in the spiritual journey of practitioners. The Three Roots consist of the guru, yidam, and dakini or dharma protector, each representing a pivotal source of guidance and inspiration for those treading the Vajrayana path. This formulation is traced back to the time of Padmasambhava, as evidenced by scholarly work conducted by Judith Simmer-Brown.

The iconography of the yidam carries a dynamic spectrum, reflecting the practitioner&#x27;s inner disposition. This iconographic range includes the &#x27;peaceful&#x27; form, the &#x27;wrathful&#x27; manifestation (referred to as &#x27;tro wa&#x27; in Tibetan), and the state of being &#x27;neither peaceful nor wrathful&#x27; (designated as &#x27;shi ma tro&#x27; in Tibetan). These manifestations allow practitioners to harmonize their spiritual journey with their innate nature, providing a tailored approach to self-realization. Tenzin Palmo further elaborates on this, emphasizing the connection between the practitioner&#x27;s nature and the yidam&#x27;s appearance.

Guidance in the selection of a yidam is traditionally provided by the guru, who offers insights into which yidam resonates best with the practitioner&#x27;s aspirations and tendencies. Subsequently, the guru imparts initiation into the mandala of the chosen yidam, a process that marks the commencement of deity yoga practices. The intertwining of the guru&#x27;s wisdom and the yidam&#x27;s enlightened qualities creates a deep connection that strengthens the practitioner&#x27;s spiritual journey. This connection underscores the notion of indivisibility, highlighting how the guru&#x27;s teachings and the yidam&#x27;s essence merge within the practitioner&#x27;s mindstream.

The yidam&#x27;s significance extends beyond mere practice; it is also perceived as the root of success in Vajrayana practice. Its transformative power lies in its representation of awakening, serving as a guide for practitioners to navigate their path toward enlightenment. Through its versatile manifestations, personalized guidance, and the seamless bond between guru and yidam, the practice of yidam becomes a cornerstone of accomplishment in Vajrayana.

==Diverse forms==
The practice of yidam in Vajrayana Buddhism manifests a diverse array of meditation deities, each carrying distinct attributes, symbolism, and significance. This variety underscores the richness and depth of the Vajrayana tradition, accommodating practitioners with different inclinations and spiritual aspirations.

Numerous iconic yidams hold a prominent place in Vajrayana practice, each representing specific enlightened qualities. Chakrasamvara, often depicted in union with his consort Vajravarahi, symbolizes the union of wisdom and compassion. Vajrakilaya embodies the fierce aspect of enlightenment, conquering obstacles and negativities. Green Tara, known for her swift compassion and protection, appeals to those seeking guidance and aid.

Vajrayana&#x27;s expansive tantric pantheon offers an extensive selection of yidams, catering to a broad spectrum of practitioners. These deities encompass both peaceful and wrathful manifestations, providing practitioners with a spectrum of energies to engage with during meditation. Yamantaka, with his wrathful form, embodies the conquering of death and ignorance. Hevajra, in union with his consort Nairatmya, represents the union of emptiness and bliss.

Practitioners often gravitate toward specific yidams based on personal affinity or spiritual aspirations. This personal connection can guide practitioners towards yidams that resonate with their inner journey. Some practitioners are drawn to the wisdom of Manjushri, while others find resonance in the compassionate embrace of Avalokiteshvara.

===Regional variations===
The diversity of yidams extends to regional and cultural variations within Vajrayana Buddhism. East Asian Vajrayana, as practiced in China, Korea, and Japan, incorporates yidams like Marici and the &quot;five mysteries of Vajrasattva&quot;. These variations reflect the integration of yidam practices into local contexts while preserving the essence of the tradition.

====In Nepalese Newar Buddhism====
The principal yidam in the Newar Vajrayana tradition of Nepal are Chakrasamvara and Vajravarahi. In that tradition, three components are essential to a temple complex: a main shrine symbolizing Svayambhu Mahachaitya; an exoteric shrine featuring Buddha Shakyamuni and other buddhas and bodhisattvas; and an esoteric shrine dedicated to the yidam, to which only initiates may be admitted.

====In East Asian Buddhism====
The Vajrayana traditions of China, Korea and Japan, while smaller and less prominent than Indo-Tibetan tantric Buddhism, are characterized in part by the utilization of yidams in meditation, though they use their own terms. One prominent ishta-devata in East Asian Vajrayana is Marici (Ch: &quot;Molichitian&quot;, Jp: &quot;Marishi-ten&quot;). In the Shingon tradition of Japan, prominent yidam include the &quot;five mysteries of Vajrasattva,&quot; which are Vajrasattva (Jp. &quot;Kongosatta&quot; &quot;金剛薩埵&quot;), Surata / Ishta-vajrinī (Jp. &quot;Yoku-kongonyo&quot; &quot;慾金剛女&quot;), Kelikilā-vajrinī (Jp. &quot;Shoku-kongonyo&quot; &quot;触金剛女&quot;), Kāmā / Rāga-vajrinī (Jp. &quot;Ai-kongonyo&quot; &quot;愛金剛女&quot;), and Kāmesvarā / Mana-vajrinī (Jp. &quot;Man-kongonyo&quot; &quot;慢金剛女&quot;).

==Cultivation and practice==
During the (meditation) practice of the generation stage, a practitioner (sadhaka) establishes a strong familiarity with the Ishta-deva (an enlightened being) by means of visualization and a high level of concentration. During the practice of the completion stage, a practitioner focuses on methods to actualize the transformation of one&#x27;s own mindstream and body into the meditation deity by meditation and yogic techniques of energy-control such as &quot;tummo&quot; (&#x27;inner heat yoga&#x27;). Through these complementary disciplines of generation and completion one increasingly perceives the pervasive Buddha nature.

Judith Simmer-Brown summarises:

Berzin (1997: unpaginated) in discussing Buddhist refuge commitment and bodhisattva vows frames a caution to sadhana:

In the Vajrayana practices of Tibetan Buddhism, &#x27;safe direction&#x27;, or &#x27;refuge&#x27; is undertaken through the Three Roots, the practitioner relying on an Ishta-deva in deity yoga as a means of becoming a Buddha.

==Western academic studies==

Recent Western scholarship has made significant strides in unraveling the complexities of yidam practices within Buddhism. Scholars such as Geoffrey Samuel have examined the cross-cultural implications of Vajrayana practices, including yidam engagement in Western contexts. Francesca Fremantle&#x27;s work has illuminated the symbolic and philosophical dimensions of yidams, offering insights into their iconography and their alignment with tantric philosophy. This scholarship extends to visual culture as well, as seen in Rob Linrothe&#x27;s studies on the visual representation of yidams, while David Germano&#x27;s research delves into the philosophical foundations that underpin these practices within broader Buddhist contexts. Janet Gyatso and Kurtis Schaeffer have explored the roles of yidams in tantric rituals and their connection to gender dynamics. Jacob P. Dalton&#x27;s investigations have contributed to our understanding of how yidam practices have evolved over time and across different Buddhist lineages. Together, these scholars illuminate the multifaceted aspects of yidam practices, enriching our comprehension of their historical, cultural, and philosophical significance within Buddhism.

<text>The Small Back Room (U.S. title: Hour of Glory) is a 1949 film by the British producer-writer-director team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger starring David Farrar and Kathleen Byron and featuring Jack Hawkins and Cyril Cusack. It was based on the 1943 novel of the same name by Nigel Balchin.

The theme is the unsung heroes of World War II, the &quot;backroom boys&quot;, gradually coming into their own.

==Plot==
Sammy Rice is a British scientist in a London &quot;back room&quot; team evaluating new weapons during the Second World War. Their work is constantly frustrated by bureaucrats and poor management. 

Disabled and in constant pain from his prosthetic leg, he is drowning in self-pity and feels unworthy of his girlfriend Susan. A secretary in his department, she puts up with his temper and self-destructive behaviour in hopes she can help him past his woes. Staying away from whisky is key. 

Rice, who has a past background in bomb disposal, is drawn by a Captain Stuart into a hushed assignment probing the secrets of a new Nazi booby trap device. Progress is slow.

In the middle of both bureaucratic and political turmoil impacting their section, Susan urges him to be more assertive at his job, which he takes badly and goes on a flat-smashing drunk. She leaves him.

Still soused, Rice receives a call from Stuart informing him that two intact devices have been discovered on Britain’s Channel coast.

En route there he learns Stuart has died attempting to defuse the first. Before tackling the second, Rice listens to a transcript of comments Stuart made during the disarming process. In a harrowing effort he discovers that the device has two booby traps and successfully disarms both.

Rice returns to London with his reputation enhanced and self-esteem restored. Susan is on the job, and direct him to an urgent meeting with an army colonel whom he had previously supported during a contentious hearing over an experimental artillery gun the officer had opposed. Rice is offered the opportunity to head the Army&#x27;s own new scientific research unit, complete with a commission as a major. He accepts. 

Returning to his flat he finds the damage he had done to it repaired, and Susan waiting for him there.

==Production==

&quot;The Small Back Room&quot; was to have been a solo directorial effort for Michael Powell after it was announced that Powell and Pressburger were separating after &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946). The pair didn&#x27;t separate and &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; marked the reuniting of Powell and Pressburger with producer Alexander Korda after a profitable but contentious time at the Rank Organisation that culminated with &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948). &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; was shot at a number of studios: Denham Film Studios in Buckinghamshire; Worton Hall Studios in Isleworth, Middlesex; and Shepperton Studios in Shepperton, Surrey. Location shooting took place at Chesil Bank and St Catherine&#x27;s Chapel, Abbotsbury in Dorset; Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain; on the Victoria Embankment in London; and at Abbotsbury station.

In his autobiography, &quot;A Life in Movies&quot;, Michael Powell acknowledged the influence of German expressionist films such as &quot;Nosferatu&quot; (1922) in leading him towards making films such as &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, &quot;Tales of Hoffmann&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Small Back Room&quot;.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
As of 30 June 1949 the film earned in the UK of which £84,073 went to the producer.

=== Critical ===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;It is ably produced, and the direction, with one or two lapses, is extremely efficient. The lapse which it is most hard to forgive is that into surrealistic camerawork illustrating Rice&#x27;s internal struggle with himself when, with his morale at its lowest ebb, he thirsts to open a bottle of whisky. Apart from this, it is an excellent entertainment and there are some very neat cameos of the minor frustrations of the back-room boys&#x27; travails. David Farrar turns in a convincing performance as Sammy Rice and has one believing in the reality of his game foot. Kathleen Byron is a moving and long-suffering – perhaps rather too long-suffering – Susan, and there are some good portrayals by Leslie Banks, Jack Hawkins and Cyril Cusack.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; said that although the film lacked &quot;the production tricks usually associated with&quot; Powell and Pressburger it was nevertheless &quot;a craftsmanlike job&quot;. It praised the performance of David Farrar as &quot;his best role&quot;, and lauded the careful casting of the &quot;lesser roles.&quot;

In &quot;British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959&quot; David Quinlan rated the film as &quot;good&quot;, writing in 1984: &quot;Moving study of human nature, with tense climax.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell wrote in 1989: &quot;Rather gloomy suspense thriller with ineffective personal aspects but well-made location sequences and a fascinating background of boffins at work in post-war London.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 3/5 stars, writing in 2017: &quot;After the sumptuous theatrics of &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948), Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger returned to the muted naturalism of their earlier collaborations for this adaptation of Nigel Balchin&#x27;s novel about scientists feeling the strain in wartime. The pair were obviously uninspired by the lengthy passages of chat in which the backroom boffins bicker about their latest inventions, but their masterful use of camera angles and cutting gives the finale an unbearable tension.&quot;

== Accolades ==
&quot;The Small Back Room&quot; was nominated for a 1950 BAFTA Award as &quot;Best British Film&quot;.

==DVD==
The Region 2 DVD was released in May 2004 by Studio Canal / Warner Home Video. In Region 1, The Criterion Collection released the film in August 2008. The release included an essay, an interview with cinematographer Christopher Challis, an audio commentary and excerpts from Michael Powell&#x27;s audio dictations for his autobiography.

<text>The Elusive Pimpernel is a 1950 British period adventure film by the British-based director-writer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, based on the novel &quot;The Scarlet Pimpernel&quot; (1905) by Baroness Emmuska Orczy. It was released in the United States under the title The Fighting Pimpernel. The picture stars David Niven as Sir Percy Blakeney (a.k.a. The Scarlet Pimpernel), Margaret Leighton as Marguerite Blakeney and features Jack Hawkins, Cyril Cusack and Robert Coote. Originally intended to be a musical, the film was re-worked as a light-hearted drama.

==Plot==
During the French Revolution, the Scarlet Pimpernel, who is really Sir Percy Blakeney in disguise, risks his life to rescue French aristocrats from the guillotine and take them across the English Channel to safety. As cover, Sir Percy poses as a fop at Court, and curries favour with the Prince of Wales by providing advice about fashion, but secretly he leads The League, a group of noblemen with similar views.

Chauvelin, the French ambassador to England, wants to find out who the Pimpernel is, so he can be brought to French justice. He blackmails Blakeney&#x27;s French wife Marguerite into helping him by threatening to have her brother Armand (an associate of the Pimpernel) arrested and tortured. She intercepts a letter intended for the Pimpernel and gives it to Chauvelin, unaware that she has betrayed her husband. When she discovers the truth, she sets out to warn him of his great peril.

==Production==

&quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot; was financed by Samuel Goldwyn and Alexander Korda. Neither director Michael Powell nor star David Niven was very interested in doing the film, but had their minds changed by threats of contract suspension. (Rex Harrison had been originally announced as the star.) Powell wanted to make the film as a musical, but was not allowed to, and Margaret Leighton was cast despite his objection. Goldwyn forced numerous additions and changes to the film but when Powell delivered the final cut, Goldwyn refused to make the final payment, which caused Korda to sue him.

The film was shot in 1949 at various British film studios in Boreham Wood, Elstree and Shepperton, Surrey. Location shooting took place in Bath, Dover, in Savernake Forest, on the Marlborough Downs, and in the stables of Carlton House Terrace, St. James&#x27;s, London. In France, filming took place in the chateaux of the Loire Valley and on Mont Saint-Michel.

==Release==
&quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot; was released in the UK in 1950, but because of the falling out between Korda and Goldwyn, did not gain an American distributor until July 1953 when Carroll Pictures acquired the rights. The film then premiered in New York City on 17 April 1954.

Niven&#x27;s unhappiness at being forced to make the film later led to him severing his contract with Samuel Goldwyn.

<text>Gone to Earth is a 1950 British Technicolor film created by the director-writer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. It stars Jennifer Jones, David Farrar, Cyril Cusack and Esmond Knight. The film was significantly changed for the American market by David O. Selznick and retitled The Wild Heart in 1952.

&quot;Gone to Earth&quot; is based on the 1917 novel of the same name by author Mary Webb. The novel was largely ignored when it first appeared, but it became better known in the 1930s during the neo-romantic revival.

==Plot==
Hazel Woodus is a child of nature in the Shropshire countryside in 1897. She loves and understands all of the wild animals more than she does the people around her. Whenever she has problems, she consults the book of spells and charms left to her by her gypsy mother.

Local squire Jack Reddin sees Hazel and wants her, but she has already promised herself to the Baptist minister Edward Marston. A struggle for her body and soul ensues.

==Cast==
*Jennifer Jones as Hazel Woodus
*David Farrar as John &quot;Jack&quot; Reddin
*Cyril Cusack as Edward Marston
*Sybil Thorndike as Mrs. Marston
*Edward Chapman as Mr. James
*Esmond Knight as Abel Woodus
*Hugh Griffith as Andrew Vessons
*George Cole as Cousin Albert

==Production==
Filming on &quot;Gone to Earth&quot;, which was shot in Technicolor, began on 1 August 1949. Studio filming took place at Shepperton Studios in Shepperton, Surrey, while most of the film was shot on location at many sites around Much Wenlock in Shropshire. Many locals were recruited as extras, such as the choir from a local Methodist church that appears in the film.

The film was coproduced with American producer David O. Selznick, who had a penchant for dictating long and rambling notes to his directors while under the influence of amphetamines and flooded the production with memos, most of which were ignored.

==Subsequent history==

===&quot;The Wild Heart&quot;===
Although he had been involved throughout the filming, Selznick disliked the finished film, and sued The Archers, Powell and Pressburger&#x27;s production company, in order to change it. He lost the court case but discovered that he had the right to change the film for its American release.

Selznick had the film reedited and some extra scenes shot in Hollywood under director Rouben Mamoulian to create the version known as &quot;The Wild Heart&quot; (1952). Selznick&#x27;s changes were mostly additions to the film: a prologue, explanatory scenes (often literally, with labels or inscriptions on items) and more closeups of his wife, Jennifer Jones. The most infamous of the alterations are the scenes at the end when Jones is supposedly carrying a tame fox—in the additional scenes, the fox is obviously a stuffed toy.

Selznick also deleted several scenes that he felt had lacked dramatic impact, some of which were major plot points. In his autobiographies, Powell claimed that Selznick only left about 35 minutes of the original film and that everything else in the American version was shot by Mamoulian.

===Restoration===
The original version of &quot;Gone to Earth&quot; was fully restored by the British Film Institute&#x27;s National Archive in 1985. A &quot;New Statesman&quot; review called the restored film &quot;one of the great British regional films&quot; and, according to Powell&#x27;s cinematographer Christopher Challis, &quot;one of the most beautiful films ever to be shot of the English countryside.&quot;

Both versions of the film are now available in the U.S. on Blu-ray disc from Kino Lorber Studio Classics (under license from The Walt Disney Company and current copyright holder ABC).

==In popular culture==
The film is extensively referenced in Jonathan Coe&#x27;s novel &quot;The Rain Before It Falls&quot; (2007), in which two of the characters are identified as extras who appear in the foreground in one of the film&#x27;s early scenes (around 8:25).

<text>Nova Bus is a Canadian transit bus manufacturer headquartered in Saint-Eustache, Quebec. Nova is owned by the Volvo Group.

The company has roots in the General Motors Diesel Division, which opened in 1979. Nova Bus was established in 1993, by Nova Quintech, through the acquisition of Dial Corporation&#x27;s transit division which consisted of Motor Coach Industries and Transportation Manufacturing Corporation. Volvo took partial ownership of Nova Bus in 1998 and complete ownership in 2004.

== History ==
Nova Bus&#x27;s Saint-Eustache factory is a former General Motors plant that built city transit buses for the Canadian and US market. Inaugurated in 1979, the plant was used to produce the New Look bus (up to 1983) and the Classic (starting 1982) model for sales in Canada. In 1987, GM sold its bus-building holdings to Greyhound Dial Corporation, the parent company of Motor Coach Industries (MCI) while GMC&#x27;s Rapid Transit Series (RTS) product was moved to join MCI&#x27;s own designs at Transportation Manufacturing Corporation in Roswell, New Mexico.

By the 1990s, Dial intended to sell its transportation manufacturing and service divisions. The St-Eustache facility was faced with closure. The entity, known as Nova Bus Corporation, was formed by individuals from Nova Quintech and the Fonds de solidarité des travailleurs du Québec to acquire MCI&#x27;s St-Eustache facility from Dial. Nova Quintech was formed in 1991 after a group of investors purchased the assets of the bankrupt fire truck manufacturer Camions Pierre Thibault Inc. The Government of Quebec agreed to contribute a $2.5-million, interest-free loan, and $10 million in loan guarantees. In addition, they agreed to purchase over 300 buses between 1993 and 1994. The sale of the MCI&#x27;s St-Eustache operations occurred on 6 July 1993.

MCI and TMC were spun-off from Dial in 1993, and merged with Mexican DINA S.A., who sold the TMC plant and RTS rights to Nova Bus in 1994. The RTS model was continued to be produced in the Roswell plant to meet Buy America requirements.

The Nova Classic and Nova RTS were later discontinued in order to concentrate on the Nova LFS, a low floor city bus, which was announced in 1994 with deliveries starting in 1997. The last Classic model was produced in 1997. Sales of Nova RTS were insufficient and Nova Bus closed its Roswell and Niskayuna, New York plants in 2002 to concentrate all efforts on the Canadian market. The Roswell plant was later acquired by a local consortium, Millennium Transit Services, who became defunct around 2012. The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA), which in 1998, placed an order for 484 LFS units that were manufactured and delivered between 2000 and 2002, was the first US customer to purchase a large order of this model, and remains one of the larger operators of Nova LFS buses.

By 1998, Nova Bus was then acquired by Volvo Buses and Prevost Car who owned 51% of the company while Henlys Group owned 49%. Volvo acquired Henlys remaining interest in 2004.

On February 2, 2008, Nova Bus announced plans for the construction of a new assembly plant in Plattsburgh, New York, signifying the company&#x27;s return to the US bus market. The plant opened on June 15, 2009. The first order from a US-based customer came from the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) for 90 LFS articulated buses; the NYCTA now has nearly 500 articulated and non-articulated LFSs. In March 2010, Nova Bus received the first order for the US-built, redesigned LFS from Honolulu, Hawaii&#x27;s TheBus; 24 were delivered in December 2010. TheBus planned to order more, but ultimately chose buses from Gillig instead. In March 2012, the Walt Disney Company announced that it plans to test a Nova articulated bus on certain high traffic routes at the Walt Disney World Resort. In 2012, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) ordered 315 buses, including 225 articulated buses to replace its aging Neoplan AN460 articulated buses and its remaining North American Bus Industries NABI 416 standard buses; the articulated hybrid buses were introduced in Philadelphia on October 27, 2014. In 2013, the Chicago Transit Authority placed an order for 300 40 foot Nova Bus clean-diesel buses, with an option to buy an additional 150.

On June 21, 2023, Nova Bus announced that it would again exit the United States market in 2025, and close the Plattsburgh plant. The company cited continuing financial losses in its decision to restructure operations to focus on Canada.

On March 28, 2024, Nova Bus announced the retirement of president Ralph Acs, who retired on April 1st, 2024. Mr. Acs was succeeded by Paul Le Houillier on June 1st, 2024. Mr. Acs remains part of the Nova Bus Board of Directors.

=== Current ===

The LFS (Low Floor Series) is currently the only vehicle built by Nova Bus. It was the first bus designed by the company and entered production in 1996.

Since being introduced, the LFS has been redesigned several times, across four generations. Introduced as a diesel-fueled, rigid bus, several variants have been offered over the last several decades of production.

Several alternative powertrains have been offered including compressed natural gas (CNG) fueled engines, diesel-electric hybrids (both series and parallel arrangements) and battery-electric. Articulated versions have been offered since 2009. Nova Bus also offers suburban configurations of their 40-foot buses with one door and motorcoach style seating, and previously offered special bodywork styling packages for 62-foot buses intended for use on bus rapid transit services.

<doc id="1273578" wikidata="Q365334" url="?curid=1273578" title="Gregorio Conrado Álvarez">
<text>Gregorio Conrado Álvarez Armelino (26 November 1925 – 28 December 2016), also known as El Goyo, was a Uruguayan Army general who served as president of Uruguay from 1981 until 1985 and was the last surviving president of the civic-military dictatorship.

==Early life and military career==
Álvarez was born in the Minas Department in 1925, later renamed Lavalleja in 1927. He entered the Uruguayan Military School in 1940 and graduated as an officer of the cavalry regiment (1946-59). He became chief of the Republican Guard in Montevideo in 1962. In 1971, he was promoted to general and then named chief of the Combined Armed Forces Command that ran the counterinsurgency operation against the Tupamaros (urban guerrillas).

When the military seized power in the 1973 Uruguayan coup d&#x27;état, Álvarez became permanent secretary of the new Consejo de Seguridad Nacional (National Security Council). In 1978, he became commander in chief of the army.

==President of Uruguay==
After Uruguay voted for a return to democracy in a referendum in 1980, the Consejo de Seguridad Nacional named Álvarez transitional president on September 1, 1981. Continuing the repression against labor unions, he lost more popular support and also the support of the majority of the military. He agreed to the holding of legislative and presidential elections in November 1984, which had been preceded by internal party elections in 1982. When Julio María Sanguinetti of the Colorado Party won the presidential election, Álvarez resigned (on February 12, 1985). Rafael Addiego, president of the Supreme Court, then took office as interim president until Sanguinetti was sworn in on March 1. It might be added that while Alvarez did not look favourably upon Jorge Sanguinetti&#x27;s candidacy in 1984, in his last years found a slightly unlikely defender in Sanguinetti, who argued that the amnesty relating to the dictatorship of 1973-1985 should not be set aside to prosecute even the more overtly military and unpalatable figures such as Álvarez, who were prominent during that period.

Álvarez&#x27;s loss of support from the (relatively) more moderate members of the National Security Council in the run-up to the 1984 elections and his subsequent resignation invites scrutiny of the relationship between the Council, the military, and the constitutional party leaders. Some would argue that Álvarez&#x27;s accession to the office of president in 1981 marked a high point of his power, which continued until his resignation. Others would argue that Álvarez&#x27;s assumption of the permanent secretaryship of the National Security Council in 1973 marked the real point at which he gained what amounted to substantial executive powers. From whichever perspective, however, the fact remains that General Álvarez&#x27;s public role as a military figure was set against the background of sizeable civilian participation in government in the 1973-1985. It is also the case that Álvarez was to some extent sidelined even during his presidency. In a country such as Uruguay which had some tradition of civilian rule by decree (e.g., during the presidency of Gabriel Terra, whose interior minister Alberto Demicheli later became president in 1976), it is arguably not accurate to equate rule by decree with military rule, although these may at times coincide.

===Military title===
Among the five individuals who became President of Uruguay in the civilian-military administration that lasted from 1973 to 1985, Álvarez, was, in fact, the only one to carry a military title. These five individuals were: Juan María Bordaberry, Alberto Demicheli, Aparicio Méndez, Álvarez, and Rafael Addiego. Some would argue that this fact is significant when assessing the degree of civilian participation in the regime. Others would argue that an unelected president backed by the military may sometimes merely constitute a cosmetic figurehead.

==Retirement and arrest==

Although he was covered by a 1986 amnesty, since the election to the presidency of Tabaré Vázquez of the Frente Amplio in November 2004, there had been renewed calls for the prosecution of Álvarez for human rights abuses, for his part in Bordaberry&#x27;s 1973 coup, and subsequent events.

Álvarez&#x27;s residence in Montevideo became the focal point for demonstrators protesting the disappearance of opponents of the 1973–1985 civilian-military administration in July 2006. Defenders of such protests could argue that Álvarez symbolizes some of the least attractive aspects of the dictatorship of 1973–1985. On the other hand, it may be accurately asserted that since Álvarez was the only serving military individual to serve as president in the five presidencies of that period, such protests, whether justified or not, may serve to obscure the substantial civilian support for that administration by Colorado and Blanco politicians. From the point of view of those parties, therefore, such protests serve to deflect any focus upon the role exercised by prominent individuals in those parties during that regime.

In December 2007 Álvarez was indicted for alleged human rights abuses during the dictatorship in which he played a prominent role. On October 22, 2009, he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison for 37 counts of murder and human rights violations; however, he was not in court to hear the verdict as he was ill. Alvarez died in prison on December 28, 2016, at the age of 91.

<text>A Burschenschaft (; sometimes abbreviated &#x27; in the German &quot;Burschenschaft&quot; jargon; plural: &#x27;) is one of the traditional (student associations) of Germany, Austria, and Chile (the latter due to German cultural influence).
Burschenschaften were founded in the 19th century as associations of university students inspired by liberal and nationalistic ideas.
They were significantly involved in the March Revolution and the unification of Germany.
After the formation of the German Empire in 1871, they faced a crisis, as their main political objective had been realized. So-called were established, but these were dissolved by the Nazi regime in 1935/6. In West Germany, the were re-established in the 1950s, but they faced a renewed crisis in the 1960s and 1970s, as the mainstream political outlook of the German student movement of that period started leaning more towards the left. Roughly 160 exist today in Germany, Austria and Chile.

==History==
===Origins===

The very first one, called (&quot;original &quot;), was founded on 12 June 1815 at Jena as an association drawn from all German university students inspired by liberal and patriotic ideas. Like the Landsmannschaften or the Corps, a student association based on particular German region, the Burschenschaft members also engaged in duelling. However, its main purpose was to break down society lines and to destroy rivalry in the student body, to improve student life and increase patriotism. It was intended to draw its members from a broader population base than the Corps. Indeed, the group was known for its middle-class membership while the Corps&#x27; was mainly aristocratic. At first, a significant component of its membership were students who had taken part in the German wars of liberation against the Napoleonic occupation of Germany.

Its motto was “honor, freedom, fatherland” (), and the original colors were red-black-red with a golden oak leaves cluster, which might be based on the uniform of the Lützow Free Corps, being a corps of volunteer soldiers during the wars of liberation.

===19th century===

The were student associations that engaged in numerous social activities. However, their most important goal was to foster loyalty to the concept of a united German national state as well as strong engagement for freedom, rights, and democracy. Quite often decided to stress extreme nationalist or sometimes also liberal ideas, leading in time to the exclusion of Jews, who were considered to be un-German. Nevertheless, all were banned as revolutionary by Klemens Wenzel von Metternich of Austria when he issued the reactionary Carlsbad Decrees in 1819.

Many took part in the in 1832 and the democratic Revolution in 1848/49. After this revolution had been suppressed, plenty of leading , such as Friedrich Hecker and Carl Schurz, went abroad. After the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, the movement faced a severe crisis, as one major goal had been achieved to some extent: German unification. In the 1880s, a renaissance movement, the , led by the ideas of Küster, arose and many new were founded. It was also during this time until the 1890s when many members turned increasingly towards anti-Semitic outlook believing it provided an approach to achieving the fraternity&#x27;s fundamental goal. Such members viewed the Jews as a problem that hampered the unification of Germany and the achievement of new values the organization advanced. There were members who resigned to protest a resolution adopted at an Eisenach meeting declaring that Burschenschaft &quot;have no Jewish members and do not plan to have any in the future.&quot;

===Interbellum and Nazi Germany===
In 1935/36, most north of the Austrian Alps were dissolved by the Nazi government or transformed and fused with other into so-called (comradeships). Some Nazis (e.g. Ernst Kaltenbrunner) and Nazi opponents (Karl Sack, Hermann Kaiser) were members of . Theodor Herzl, an Austrian Jewish journalist who founded modern political Zionism, was also a member of a .
However, he resigned two years after he joined because of the fraternity&#x27;s antisemitism.

===Postwar===
While in communist East Germany were prohibited as representatives of a bourgeois attitude to be extinguished, in West Germany most were refounded in the 1950s. Some of them had to be transferred into other cities, since Germany had lost great parts of its territories after the Second World War, and many from East Germany also tried to find a new home. The allied victors had forbidden refounding originally, but this could not be upheld in a liberal surrounding. In the 1970s and 1980s, the , as many other student fraternities, underwent a crisis: a lack of new members and strong attacks by the leftist student community. In the 1990s many that had left Eastern Germany in the 1940s and 1950s returned to their traditional home universities in the East.

===Today===
Roughly 160 still exist today and many are organized in different organizations ranging from progressive to nationalistic. Among the latter is the Deutsche Burschenschaft organization (, German Burschenschaft), which represents about a third of the . Others are organized in the Schwarzburgbund (Schwarzburg League), the Neue Deutsche Burschenschaft (, New Germany Fraternity) or the Allgemeine Deutsche Burschenschaft (General German Student Union). While the still insists upon Fichte&#x27;s idea of a German nation based on language, thought and culture, the favors defining Germany as the political Germany established by the German Basic Law (constitution) in 1949 and altered by the 1990 unification. Many are not organized at all since they do not see an organization that represents their values sufficiently.

Because of the German emigration into Chile in the late 19th century, there are also some in Chile, organized in the Bund Chilenischer Burschenschaften in contact with the German and Austrian organizations. These are B! Araucania (Santiago), B! Andinia (Santiago), B! Montania (Concepción), B! Ripuaria (Viña Del Mar) and B! Vulkania (Valdivia). Contrary to popular belief, there is no precise political view point held by these Burschenschaften, in fact, they don&#x27;t really mix with politics, mostly focusing on maintaining B! culture (still, fencing is prohibited in Chile). 

Most are , i.e. their members must sustain a number of . Academic fencing is still an important part of their self-understanding as well as political education.

Many , often found in certain &quot;umbrella&quot; organisations (such as the ), are associated with right-wing or far-right ideas, in particular with the wish for a German state encompassing Austria.
In 2013 one Bonn fraternity proposed that only students of German origin should be eligible to join a . Reportedly half of member clubs threatened to leave in a row over proposed ID cards and a decision to label an opponent of Adolf Hitler a &quot;traitor&quot;.
Many of the that left the Deutsche Burschenschaft following this were later involved in the founding of a new organization, the .

<text>A pharmacy technician (PhT) performs pharmacy-related functions including but not limited to filling out prescription medications. Training, certification, licensing, and actual practice of pharmacy technicians varies not only worldwide but in some countries regionally as well as by employer.

==Overview==
Pharmacy technicians are healthcare professionals trained in the technical aspects of supplying medicines and medical devices to patients since the 1950s. Pharmacy technicians work in a variety of locations (usually in community, retail, and hospital pharmacies), but can also work for long-term care facilities, pharmaceutical manufacturers, third-party insurance companies, computer software companies, in government, the military, or in teaching. Job responsibilities often include dispensing prescription drugs and other medical devices to patients and instructing them on their use. They may also perform administrative duties in a pharmaceutical practice, such as reviewing prescription requests with medical practices and insurance companies to ensure correct medications are provided and payment is received. Additionally, pharmacy technicians handle inventory related tasks such as cycle counts and returning expired and damaged medications back to the manufacturers. Pharmacy technicians may take on the role of compounding supervisor, overseeing day to day sterile and non-sterile medicines preparation while meeting standards required by regulatory bodies.

In recent times, pharmacy technicians also speak directly with the patients on the phone to aid in the awareness of taking medications on time. In many countries, the relative importance of pharmacy technicians within the pharmacy workforce has been amplified in recent years, largely as a reaction to pharmacist shortages, resulting in an increase in their numbers and responsibilities.

==Education and training==

=== Canada ===
The Pharmacy Examining Board of Canada administers the Pharmacy Technician Qualifying Examination. Pharmacy technicians are required to be registered with a provincial or a national regulatory body or council. In provinces and jurisdictions where pharmacy technician is a regulated occupation, liability insurance is required to practice.

According to a 2007 profile of the pharmacy technician workforce, 43% of technicians work in hospitals and other related facilities, 37% in chain or franchise community pharmacies, and 16% in independent community pharmacies. Most (62%) obtained pharmacy technician training from a career college or community college, some (16%) had only a high school education and no formal pharmacy training, while about 20% had some university education. A very small proportion (2%) had trained and worked abroad as either pharmacists or pharmacy technicians. The wide range of technical training and educational attainment likely reflects in part the variety of training programs for pharmacy technicians currently available in the different provinces and territories of the country. Accredited pharmacy technician diplomas, certificates and college programs are offered in the Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick. The Canadian Association of Pharmacy Technicians is a professional organization of pharmacy technicians in Canada.

=== Germany ===

According to the German Statistisches Bundesamt, 66,867 pharmacy technicians (&quot;Pharmazeutisch-technische Assistenten&quot;) were working in 2011. About 90% were working as employees in community pharmacies. Their salary (approx. 1,837 – 2,400 Euros) is part of agreements between employers associations and Adexa.

=== Saudi Arabia ===

Pharmacy technicians are known as assistant pharmacists. Several universities offer programs of three and half years of education and training. This occupation appeared due to the lack of pharmacists in Saudi Arabia in 1990, a reason they are commonly confused with pharmacists. Pharmacy regency technicians are regulated and monitored by the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties.

According to the MOH Statistics, there were about 8,471 of pharmacy technicians working in MOH Saudi Arabia 2015.

In 2010, the Minister of Health, Abdullah Al-Rabiah, issued a decision to stop the teaching of pharmacy technicians immediately.

=== Sri Lanka ===

In Sri Lanka, the government agency National Apprentices and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) has developed National Competency Standards (NCS) leading to the award of the NVQ Level 4 certification as pharmacy technician for pharmacy employees who have above four years of experience. The NCS is approved by the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission in 2016 and is presently being implemented. 
The one-year training consists of subject areas in compounding, dispensing, stock management, housekeeping practices and customer care development. The first batch of 154 certified pharmacy technicians are already employed in the community pharmacy sector.

=== Ghana ===
In 2009, a World Health Organization assessment identified a total of 918 practising pharmacy technicians or technologists (1 per 25,600 residents) and 1,642 medicine counter assistants (1 per 14,300 residents).

In regards to training, the assessment identified only one pharmacy technologist training school in the country (enrolling 70 students in the Higher National Diploma program).

=== India ===
R.C.S.M. Govt Medical College and CPR Hospital, Kolhapur provides training for pharmacy technicians in India. To be a pharmacy technician, completion of this program is 10+2 or diploma. There are two batches a year that intakes approximately 40 students per batch.

=== Nigeria ===

Pharmacy technicians in Nigeria make up 75% of pharmaceutical work force. Pharmacists Council of Nigeria refused to allocate responsibilities that will give them right to practice at community level interdependently. The case was in court and the court ruled against PCN on December 3, 2008.

Nigerian pharmacy technicians in collaboration with National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) are currently saving Nigerian Economy and Nigerians from the professional monopoly played by PCN which led to abundant fake drugs due lack of manpower. This exposed Nigerian to a lot of problems which lead reduction in productivity leading to sustainable poverty. 
Nigerian pharmacy technicians in collaboration with NBTE are able to achieve these by introducing ND/HND in pharmaceutical technology. PCN is doing everything possible to stop this training to sustain its monopoly, demanding Federal ministry of education to direct NBTE to stop accrediting the polytechnics while these course are offered in Ghana, Sudan and other countries. The meeting called at the instance of NBTE on 25 May 2016 where the PCN, representative of the Honourable Minister of Health, Federal Ministry of Education, Pharmaceutical Society of Nigeria (PSN) and National Association of Pharmaceutical Technologists and Pharmacy Technicians of Nigeria were in attendance; certain issues bothering on the nomenclature Pharmaceutical Technologists, the curriculum and the accrediting body for polytechnic graduates of pharmaceutical Technology were raised. There it was made clear that the nomenclature (Pharmaceutical Technologist) is not new in Nigeria as the training of people bearing the name were trained at the former School of Pharmaceutical Technologists between 1981 and 1985. The premises of the school is being used as the liaison office of the PCN today. It was also established that NBTE is saddled with the accreditation of courses offered by Polytechnics and Monotechnics in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. As for the curriculum, findings revealed that NBTE is in line with the legal instrument that established the Board. Meanwhile, it was unanimously agreed that all relevant bodies should come together to review the complaints of the PCN.

=== Tanzania ===
Tanzania has two pharmacy technician schools: one is a public sector institution under the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare and accredited by Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences, and the other is affiliated with a faith-based organization located in Kilimanjaro which offers diploma training. The practice of pharmacy technician is regulated by Pharmacy Council Tanzania, which enrolls and enlists them. In 2010, the country had 0.11 registered pharmacy technicians per 10,000 population.

The main job duties of Tanzanian pharmacy technicians include dispensing, stock management, compounding, quantification of pharmaceutical formulations, and laboratory work. In some areas of the country facing acute shortage of physicians and other clinicians, pharmacy technicians have also been found prescribing medicine.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, the title &quot;Pharmacy Technician&quot; is a protected title. A prospective technician has two pathways that must be completed. One must complete both a General Pharmaceutical Council-recognised course and a SVQ competence qualification or an accredited combined qualification and course. A period of time of working as a trainee or student pharmacy technician is needed before final qualification and compulsory registration with GPhC (formerly the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain) is required before commencing work as a pharmacy technician. The period of on-the-job training is usually done concurrently whilst completing the course and typically over a two-year period. Pharmacy technicians may counsel patients on their medication (under the supervision or direction of a pharmacist, though counselling is not one of the learning outcomes for pharmacy technician training) as well as general dispensing of prescriptions. In community pharmacy, it has been recognised that the role is difficult to distinguish from that of a dispensing assistant with an NVQ2 qualification. Additional training is available to qualified pharmacy technicians and can include accuracy checking of dispensed prescriptions (though there is no legal requirement that a person be qualified as a pharmacy technician before undertaking an accuracy checking course), medicines management (hospital or PCT), participation in the running of hospital clinics such as anticoagulant clinics, dosing warfarin patients under dose banding guidance, or other duties traditionally done by pharmacists.

Training providers in the UK require a first degree subject, For example University of East Anglia requires 
2:1 or above undergraduate degree in a Life Science, Biomedical Science, Sport Science or Healthcare subject, 4 GCSEs or equivalent in English Language, Mathematics, Biology and Chemistry with one A Level or equivalent in a Science subject. Under exceptional circumstances, experience in healthcare practice may contribute/compensate absent the above requirements.

In the National Health Service (NHS) pharmacy technicians work under the direct supervision of a senior or specialist pharmacy technician and is accountable to the chief pharmacy technician or lead pharmacist even if not in a dispensary. Technicians work mainly in one of two areas, hospital pharmacy or community pharmacy. Some also work in doctors&#x27; general practices and in primary care trusts.

A pharmacy dispenser cannot call themselves or work as a pharmacy technician or register with the GPhC as one.

Pharmacy technicians in hospitals are graded on the same Agenda for Change banding as audiovisual technicians, dental nurses and theatre support workers. They start on a set percentage of a Band 4 (usually 75% – an average annual wage of £26,530 ) as a trainee pharmacy technician completing 1,260 hours of clinical placement education moving on to Band 5 when newly qualified PhT and can work their way to a Band 8b in charge of a department/area. A Band 8b is the equivalent of a nurse lead/senior nurse manager in nursing or other head of department in the NHS. Although Band 8b is possible, a successful pharmacy technician can reasonably expect to reach Band 7a in the latter stage of his/her career, earning an average of £54,320.

Registered pharmacy technicians in the NHS may be responsible for the training and development of pharmacy support workers and pre-registration trainee pharmacy technicians. Further training and qualifications after initial registration enable them to perform this mentoring role. Pharmacy technicians in the UK (as with other countries e.g. Canada) are now referred to by some as professionals, although registered pharmacists are still considered experts in the pharmaceutical field and pharmacy technicians are subordinate to pharmacists.

A report was published by the Pharmacists&#x27; Defence Association in 2019 making proposals for the development of pharmacist and pharmacy technician roles and career frameworks symbiotically in community pharmacy. It also outlined various impediments and governance issues and called for these to be addressed. The Association of Pharmacy Technicians United Kingdom is a professional organisation for pharmacy technicians in the UK.

=== United States ===

There is no national regulatory agency governing pharmacy technicians and the duty falls to the individual state boards of pharmacies in the US. A high school diploma (or its equivalent) is typically required in all states but certification and licensing requirements vary by state. Some states require training from board-approved schools, national certification, on-the-job training or no requirements at all. A technician can become nationally certified by taking an NCAA-accredited examination administered by either the Pharmacy Technician Certification Board (PTCB) or the National Healthcareer Association (NHA).

Beginning in January 2020, the PTCB enacted a requirement that prior to examination, an applicant for certification must complete an American Society of Health-System Pharmacists-accredited pharmacy technician education program, a PTCB-recognized training program, or 500 hours of training however, the NHA had similar requirements prior to the PTCB enacting the 2020 requirements. Upon completion of the certification exam, a pharmacy technician earns the certified or CPhT credential. Continuing education after national certification is required for certification renewal every two years.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2011 about 75% of pharmacy technicians in the US work in a retail setting, such as an independently owned drugstore, a mass retailer chain, or a mail-order or online pharmacy. An additional 16% of pharmacy technician jobs were in hospitals, while others worked for nursing homes, pharmaceutical wholesalers, or the federal government. As of 2016, the nationwide average hourly pay for pharmacy technicians working in retail or independent pharmacies is $12.26 and for pharmacy technicians working in hospital setting is $14.57. American pharmacy technicians work under the supervision of a pharmacist, often following a pharmacist-to-pharmacy technician ratio if required by the state that the pharmacy is located in. The National Pharmacy Technician Association and American Association of Pharmacy Technicians are professional organizations of pharmacy technicians in the US.

====Requirements by state====

The states Delaware, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin do not require licensing or certification but may require some form of training or registration.

Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Washington, D.C. require both certification and licensing or registration, though some states may have a training period before these requirements.

California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas (with exceptions), and Vermont require only a license.

=== Zimbabwe ===
Pharmacy technicians are trained at Harare Polytechnic. Students graduate with a diploma after three years of training. The program is run by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare of Zimbabwe. Yearly intake is about 35 students.

<doc id="1273586" wikidata="Q2249349" url="?curid=1273586" title="The Tales of Hoffmann (1951 film)">
<text>The Tales of Hoffmann is a 1951 British Technicolor comic opera film written, produced and directed by the team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger working under the umbrella of their production company The Archers. It is an adaptation of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s 1881 opera &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, itself based on three short stories by E. T. A. Hoffmann.

The film stars Robert Rounseville, Moira Shearer, Robert Helpmann and Léonide Massine and features Pamela Brown, Ludmilla Tchérina and Ann Ayars. Only Rounseville and Ayars sang their own roles.

The film&#x27;s soundtrack consists of music conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham and played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. In addition to Rounseville and Ayars, singers included Dorothy Bond, Margherita Grandi, Monica Sinclair and Bruce Dargavel. The film&#x27;s production team included cinematographer Christopher Challis and production and costume designer Hein Heckroth, who was nominated for two 1952 Academy Awards for his work.

==Plot==

* In the prologue, Hoffmann is in the audience at a performance by Stella, a prima ballerina, of &quot;The Ballet of the Enchanted Dragonfly&quot;. Stella sends Hoffmann a note asking him to meet her after the performance, but the note is intercepted by his rival, Councillor Lindorf. Not having received her note, Hoffmann goes to the tavern in the interval, where he tells the story of a clown, Kleinzach, and three stories of his past loves—Olympia, Giulietta and Antonia—and gets drunk.
* In the first story, Olympia is an automaton created by scientist Spalanzani and magic spectacle maker Coppelius. Hoffmann falls for the doll, ignorant of her artifice and is mocked when he finally discovers she is &quot;automatic&quot;.
* In the second story, Hoffmann in Venice falls for Giulietta, a courtesan, but she seduces him to steal his reflection for the magician Dapertutto.
* In the third story, Antonia is a soprano suffering from an incurable illness and must not sing, but the evil Dr. Miracle makes her sing and she dies, breaking the hearts of Hoffmann and her father, Crespel.
* Finally, in the epilogue, Hoffmann explains that all three women are all aspects of his love, Stella, who then appears in the tavern and, seeing Hoffmann drunk and incapacitated, is led away by Councillor Lindorf.

==Adaptation==

Though the original French libretto is presented in an English translation, the film is relatively faithful to the traditional adaptations of Offenbach&#x27;s last opera and incorporates his unfinished score with the thread of the plot. However, certain important changes were made in the process of adapting the story to film: 
*In the prologue of the film, all of Lindorf&#x27;s music is excluded, making him a silent character. 
*Stella&#x27;s profession is changed from an opera singer appearing in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; to a ballet dancer. 
*&quot;The Tale of Antonia&quot; is shortened, ending with the powerful trio for Antonia, the ghost of her mother, and Dr. Miracle rather than Antonia&#x27;s death scene. This tale was especially moved to the third act, replacing the Giulietta tale and thus causing a switch to each act.
*The role of Nicklaus is abridged, though Nicklaus (as played by Pamela Brown) still appears.

==Cast==
==Production==

In the later years of his partnership with Pressburger, Powell became interested in what he termed &quot;a composed film&quot;, a marriage of image to operatic music. The finale of &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; and the ballet sequence of &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; were earlier steps toward his goal.

&quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; is an achievement of this ideal, as the entire opera was prerecorded to create the soundtrack and the film was edited to the rhythms of the music. The production is completely without dialogue and, with the exception of Robert Rounseville and Ann Ayars, none of the actors did their own singing. Some of the singers had established careers in Britain at the time. Grahame Clifford, for example, had been a leading comedian with the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company for several years, and Monica Sinclair was fast becoming an audience favourite at Covent Garden; she would later become one of the company&#x27;s most popular artists of the next two decades. The acting (especially by Helpmann) is highly stylised and similar to that of the silent-film era.

Each tale is marked by a primary colour denoting its theme. &quot;The Tale of Olympia&quot;, set in Paris, has yellow contours highlighting the farcical nature and tone of the first act. &quot;The Tale of Giulietta&quot; is a hellish depiction of Venice, where dark colours, especially red, are used. The final tale, set in Greece, uses different shades of blue, alluding to its sad nature. The set design is deliberately made to look artificial with the costumes similarly stylised. The opening scene of the &quot;Tale of Giulietta&quot; (in which Giulietta performs the &quot;Barcarolle&quot;, the most famous theme of the opera) is staged on a gondola that moves through deliberately artificial Venetian canals, although it does not seem to actually move on the water.

&quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; was in production from 1 to 16 July 1950 at Shepperton Studios in Shepperton, Surrey.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Following the film&#x27;s world premiere in New York City, Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote:

Reportedly, Cecil B. DeMille sent a letter to Powell and Pressburger saying: &quot;For the first time in my life, I was treated to Grand Opera where the beauty, power and scope of the music was equally matched by the visual presentation.&quot;

For the 2002 &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; poll, George A. Romero called it his &quot;favourite film of all time; the movie that made me want to make movies.&quot; Three years earlier, Romero had introduced the film as part of the &quot;Dialogues: Talking with Pictures&quot; programme at the 1999 Toronto International Film Festival. Romero later taped an interview for the Criterion Collection edition, discussing his love of the film and its influence on his career. Martin Scorsese, an ardent fan of Powell and Pressburger, provides an audio commentary track on the Criterion edition.

In a book on the British cinema, André Bazin is quoted as saying:
===Accolades===
At the 24th Academy Awards, &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; received two nominations, both for Hein Heckroth, for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color and Best Costume Design, Color; the awards in both cases went to the crew of &quot;An American in Paris&quot;.

Powell and Pressburger were nominated for the Grand Prize of the 1951 Cannes Film Festival and won the Exceptional Prize. They also won the Silver Bear award for best musical at the 1st Berlin International Film Festival.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack was recorded at Shepperton Studios between May and September 1950, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. Decca obtained permission from London Films to release the soundtrack album. In response, Beecham sued, as he had not approved the release because the soundtrack did not truly represent his interpretation of the opera because of the changes made for the film. On 20 March 1951, he failed to obtain a high court injunction to prevent the release but received assurances that the album would be clearly labelled as having been taken from the soundtrack.

==2015 re-release==
In March 2015, the 4K restoration of the film, produced by Martin Scorsese&#x27;s The Film Foundation, the British Film Institute and Studiocanal, was released in the U.S. by Rialto Pictures. The restored version runs 136 minutes, including a final credits sequence of all the performers and singers not seen in any previous releases.

<text>House (also called House, M.D.) is an American medical drama television series created by David Shore for Fox. It ran for eight seasons from November 16, 2004 to May 21, 2012. It features the life of Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), an unconventional, misanthropic, cynical medical genius who, despite his dependence on pain medication, successfully leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton–Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The series&#x27; premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore was responsible for conceiving the titular character.

House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients&#x27; illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights. His flouting of hospital rules and procedures frequently leads him into conflict with his boss, hospital administrator and Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). His only true friend is Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), head of the Department of Oncology.

During the first three seasons, House&#x27;s diagnostic team consists of Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), and Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). At the end of the third season, this team disbands. Rejoined by Foreman, House gradually selects three new team members: Dr. Remy &quot;Thirteen&quot; Hadley (Olivia Wilde), Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn). Chase and Cameron continue to appear occasionally in different roles at the hospital. Kutner dies late in season five; early in season six, Cameron departs the hospital, and Chase returns to the diagnostic team. Thirteen takes a leave of absence for most of season seven, and her position is filled by medical student Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn). Cuddy and Masters depart before season eight; Foreman becomes the new Dean of Medicine, while Dr. Jessica Adams (Odette Annable) and Dr. Chi Park (Charlyne Yi) join House&#x27;s team.

The series&#x27; executive producers included Shore, Attanasio, Attanasio&#x27;s business partner Katie Jacobs, and film director Bryan Singer. It was filmed largely in a neighborhood and business district in Los Angeles County&#x27;s Westside called Century City. The series was produced by Attanasio and Jacobs&#x27; Heel and Toe Films, Shore&#x27;s Shore Z Productions, Singer&#x27;s Bad Hat Harry Productions, and Universal Television.

&quot;House&quot; was among the top 10 series in the United States from its second through fourth seasons. Distributed to 71 countries, it was the most-watched TV program in the world in 2008. It received numerous awards, including five Primetime Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, a Peabody Award, and nine People&#x27;s Choice Awards. On February 8, 2012, Fox announced that the eighth season, then in progress, would be its last. The series finale aired on May 21, 2012, following an hour-long retrospective.

==Production==
===Conception===
In 2004, David Shore and Paul Attanasio, along with Attanasio&#x27;s business partner Katie Jacobs, pitched the series (untitled at the time) to Fox as a &quot;&quot;-style medical detective program, a hospital whodunit in which the doctors investigated symptoms and their causes; the main character would be loosely based on Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Attanasio was inspired to develop a medical procedural drama by &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; column &quot;Diagnosis&quot;, written by physician Lisa Sanders, who is an attending physician at Yale–New Haven Hospital (YNHH); the fictitious Princeton–Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH, not to be confused with the University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro) is modeled after this teaching institution. Fox bought the series, though the network&#x27;s then-president, Gail Berman, told the creative team, &quot;I want a medical show, but I don&#x27;t want to see white coats going down the hallway&quot;. Jacobs has said that this stipulation was one of the many influences that led to the show&#x27;s ultimate form.

After Fox picked up the show, it acquired the working title &quot;Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain&quot; (&quot;zebra&quot; is medical slang for an unusual or obscure diagnosis, while &quot;circling the drain&quot; refers to terminal cases, patients in an irreversible decline). The original premise of the show was of a team of doctors working together trying to &quot;diagnose the undiagnosable&quot;. Shore felt it was important to have an interesting central character, one who could examine patients&#x27; personal characteristics and diagnose their ailments by figuring out their secrets and lies. As Shore and the rest of the creative team explored the character&#x27;s possibilities, the program concept became less of procedure and more focused upon the lead role. The character was named &quot;House&quot;, which was adopted as the show&#x27;s title, as well. Shore developed the characters further and wrote the script for the pilot episode. Bryan Singer, who directed the pilot episode and had a major role in casting the primary roles, has said that the &quot;title of the pilot was &#x27;Everybody Lies&#x27;, and that&#x27;s the premise of the show&quot;. Shore has said that the central storylines of several early episodes were based on the work of Berton Roueché, a staff writer for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; between 1944 and 1994, who specialized in features about unusual medical cases.

Shore traced the concept for the title character to his experience as a patient at a teaching hospital. He recalled: &quot;I knew, as soon as I left the room, they would be mocking me relentlessly [for my cluelessness] and I thought that it would be interesting to see a character who actually did that before they left the room.&quot; A central part of the show&#x27;s premise was that the main character would be disabled in some way. The original idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox rejected this. Jacobs later expressed her gratitude for the network&#x27;s insistence that the character be reimagined—putting him on his feet added a crucial physical dimension. The writers ultimately chose to give House a damaged leg arising from an incorrect diagnosis, which requires him to use a cane and causes him pain that leads to a narcotic dependency.

====References to Sherlock Holmes ====

References to fictional detective Sherlock Holmes appear throughout the series. Shore explained that he was always a Holmes fan and found the character&#x27;s indifference to his clients unique. The resemblance is evident in House&#x27;s reliance on inductive reasoning and psychology, even where it might not seem obviously applicable, and his reluctance to accept cases he finds uninteresting. House&#x27;s investigatory method is to eliminate diagnoses logically as they are proved impossible; Holmes uses a similar method. Both characters play instruments (House plays the piano, the guitar, and the harmonica; Holmes, the violin) and take drugs (House is dependent on Vicodin; Holmes uses cocaine recreationally). House&#x27;s relationship with Dr. James Wilson echoes that between Holmes and his confidant, Doctor Watson. Robert Sean Leonard, who portrays Wilson, said that House and his character were originally intended to work together much as Holmes and Watson do; in his view, House&#x27;s diagnostic team has assumed that aspect of the Watson role. Shore said that House&#x27;s name itself is meant as &quot;a subtle homage&quot; to Holmes. House&#x27;s address is 221B Baker Street, a direct reference to Holmes&#x27;s street address. Wilson&#x27;s address is also 221B.

Individual episodes of the series contain additional references to the Sherlock Holmes tales. The main patient in the pilot episode is named Rebecca Adler after Irene Adler, a character in the first Holmes short story, &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;. In the season two finale, House is shot by a crazed gunman credited as &quot;Moriarty&quot;, the name of Holmes&#x27;s nemesis. In the season four episode &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Lie&quot;, House receives a &quot;second-edition Conan Doyle&quot; as a Christmas gift. In the season five episode &quot;The Itch&quot;, House is seen picking up his keys and Vicodin from the top of a copy of Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. In another season five episode, &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, House, in an attempt to fool his team, uses a book by Joseph Bell, Conan Doyle&#x27;s inspiration for Sherlock Holmes. The volume had been given to him the previous Christmas by Wilson, who included the message &quot;Greg, made me think of you.&quot; Before acknowledging that he gave the book to House, Wilson tells two of the team members that its source was a patient, Irene Adler. Season 7 episode 3 includes a young adult boyhood detective book series written by the patient, whose final unpublished volume ends in an ambiguous end to the main character reminiscent of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. The series finale also pays homage to Holmes&#x27;s apparent death in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, the 1893 story with which Conan Doyle originally intended to conclude the Holmes chronicles.

===Production team===
&quot;House&quot; was a co-production of Heel and Toe Films, Shore Z Productions, and Bad Hat Harry Productions in association with Universal Network Television for Fox. Paul Attanasio and Katie Jacobs, the heads of Heel and Toe Films; David Shore, the head of Shore Z Productions; and Bryan Singer, the head of Bad Hat Harry Productions, were executive producers of the program for its entirety. Lawrence Kaplow, Peter Blake, and Thomas L. Moran joined the staff as writers at the beginning of the first season after the making of the pilot episode. Writers Doris Egan, Sara Hess, Russel Friend, and Garrett Lerner joined the team at the start of season two. Friend and Lerner, who are business partners, had been offered positions when the series launched, but turned the opportunity down. After observing the show&#x27;s success, they accepted when Jacobs offered them jobs again the following year. Writers Eli Attie and Sean Whitesell joined the show at the start of season four; Attie would stay on the show&#x27;s writing staff through the series finale, which he co-wrote. From the beginning of season four, Moran, Friend, and Lerner were credited as executive producers on the series, joining Attanasio, Jacobs, Shore, and Singer. Hugh Laurie was credited as an executive producer for the second and third episodes of season five.

Shore was &quot;House&quot;″s showrunner. Through the end of the sixth season, more than two dozen writers had contributed to the program. The most prolific were Kaplow (18 episodes), Blake (17), Shore (16), Friend (16), Lerner (16), Moran (14), and Egan (13). The show&#x27;s most prolific directors through its first six seasons were Deran Sarafian (22 episodes), who was not involved in season six, and Greg Yaitanes (17). Of the more than three dozen other directors who have worked on the series, only David Straiton directed as many as 10 episodes through the sixth season. Hugh Laurie directed the 17th episode of season six, &quot;Lockdown&quot;. Elan Soltes was the visual effects supervisor since the show began. Lisa Sanders, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the Yale School of Medicine, was a technical advisor to the series. She writes the &quot;Diagnosis&quot; column that inspired &quot;House&quot;″s premise. According to Shore, &quot;[T]hree different doctors ... check everything we do&quot;. Bobbin Bergstrom, a registered nurse, was the program&#x27;s on-set medical adviser.

===Casting===
At first, the producers were looking for a &quot;quintessentially American person&quot; to play the role of House. Bryan Singer in particular felt there was no way he was going to hire a non-American actor for the role. At the time of the casting session, actor Hugh Laurie was in Namibia filming the movie &quot;Flight of the Phoenix&quot;. He assembled an audition tape in a hotel bathroom, the only place with enough light, and apologized for its appearance (which Singer compared to a &quot;bin Laden video&quot;). Laurie improvised, using an umbrella for a cane. Singer was very impressed by his performance and commented on how well the &quot;American actor&quot; was able to grasp the character. Singer was not aware that Laurie was English, due to his American accent. Laurie credits the accent to &quot;a misspent youth [watching] too much TV and too many movies&quot;. Although locally better-known actors such as Denis Leary, David Cross, Rob Morrow, and Patrick Dempsey were considered for the part, Shore, Jacobs, and Attanasio were as impressed as Singer and cast Laurie as House.

Laurie later revealed that he initially thought the show&#x27;s central character was Dr. James Wilson. He assumed that House was a supporting part, due to the nature of the character, until he received the full script of the pilot episode. Laurie, the son of medical doctor Ran Laurie, said he felt guilty for &quot;being paid more to become a fake version of [his] own father&quot;. From the start of season three, he was being paid $275,000 to $300,000 per episode, as much as three times what he had previously been making on the series. Laurie was earning around $400,000 per episode by the fifth season, and $700,000 per episode for the final season, making him one of the highest-paid actors on network television.

Robert Sean Leonard had received the script for the CBS show &quot;Numb3rs&quot; as well as that for &quot;House&quot;. Leonard thought the &quot;Numb3rs&quot; script was &quot;kind of cool&quot; and planned to audition for the show. However, he decided that the character he was up for, Charlie Eppes, was in too many scenes; he later observed, &quot;The less I work, the happier I am&quot;. He believed that his &quot;House&quot; audition was not particularly good, but that his lengthy friendship with Singer helped win him the part of Dr. Wilson. Singer had enjoyed Lisa Edelstein&#x27;s portrayal of a high-priced call girl putting herself through law school on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and sent her a copy of the pilot script. Edelstein was attracted to the quality of the writing and her character&#x27;s &quot;snappy dialogue&quot; with House, and was cast as Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

Australian actor Jesse Spencer&#x27;s agent suggested that he audition for the role of Dr. Robert Chase. Spencer believed the program would be similar in style to &quot;General Hospital&quot; but changed his mind after reading the scripts. After he was cast, he persuaded the producers to turn the character into an Australian. Patrick Dempsey also auditioned for the part of Chase; he later became known for his portrayal of Dr. Derek Shepherd on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. Omar Epps, who plays Dr. Eric Foreman, was inspired by his earlier portrayal of a troubled intern on the NBC medical drama &quot;ER&quot;; his character was given the name &quot;Eric Foreman&quot; despite the fact that Fox was still airing &quot;That 70&#x27;s Show&quot; when &quot;House&quot; premiered and had the similarly named Eric Forman as that series&#x27; main protagonist. (The two series overlapped on Fox&#x27;s schedule for two seasons, though Topher Grace left &quot;That 70&#x27;s Show&quot; at the end of its 7th season and &quot;House&#x27;s&quot; first, only returning for that show&#x27;s series finale.) Jennifer Morrison felt that her audition for the part of Dr. Allison Cameron was a complete disaster. However, before her audition, Singer had watched some of her performances, including on &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, and already wanted to cast her in the role. Morrison left the show when her character was written out in the middle of season six.

At the end of season three, House dismisses Chase, while Foreman and Cameron resign. After an episode in which he &quot;borrows&quot; a janitor whom he calls &quot;Dr. Buffer&quot; to assist in a diagnosis, House must then recruit a new diagnostic team, for which he identifies seven finalists. The producers originally planned to recruit two new full-time actors, with Foreman, who returns in season four&#x27;s fifth episode, bringing the team back up to three members; ultimately, the decision was made to add three new regular cast members. Along with Epps, actors Morrison and Spencer remained in the cast, as their characters moved on to new assignments. During production, the show&#x27;s writers dismissed a single candidate per episode; as a result, said Jacobs, neither the producers nor the cast knew who was going to be hired until the last minute. In the season&#x27;s ninth episode, House&#x27;s new team is revealed: Foreman is joined by doctors Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), and Remy &quot;Thirteen&quot; Hadley (Olivia Wilde). The candidates rejected by House did not return to the show, with the exception of the last one cut: Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), who appeared in a recurring role for the rest of season four as Wilson&#x27;s girlfriend, a recurring role in season five as a hallucination of House&#x27;s, returning as such in the season eight series finale. While Penn and Wilde had higher profiles than the actors who played the other finalists, Jacobs said they went through an identical audition process and stayed with the show based on the writers&#x27; interest in their characters. Kutner was written out of the series in episode 20 of season 5 after Penn took a position in the Obama White House Office of Public Engagement and Intergovernmental Affairs.

The contracts of Edelstein, Epps, and Leonard expired at the end of season seven. As a cost-cutting measure, the three actors were asked to accept reduced salaries. Epps and Leonard came to terms with the producers, but Edelstein did not, and in May 2011, it was announced that she would not be returning for the show&#x27;s eighth season.

===Filming style and locations===

&quot;House&quot; is often filmed using the &quot;walk and talk&quot; filming technique, popularized on television by series such as &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, &quot;ER&quot;, &quot;Sports Night&quot;, and &quot;The West Wing&quot;. The technique involves the use of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking. Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because &quot;when you put a scene on the move, it&#x27;s a ... way of creating an urgency and an intensity&quot;. She noted the significance of &quot;the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6&#x27;2&quot; and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop&quot;. Nancy Franklin of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described the show&#x27;s &quot;cool, &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;–like special effects of patients&#x27; innards. I&#x27;ll bet you didn&#x27;t know that when your kidneys shut down they sound like bubble wrap popping.&quot; &quot;Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat&quot; of one patient, another critic observed, &quot;but up her nose and inside her brain and leg&quot;. Instead of relying primarily on computer-generated imagery, the interior body shots tend to involve miniature effects and motion control photography. Many of the sets are dressed with a variety of unscripted props that allow Laurie to physically improvise, revealing aspects of his character and the story.

The pilot episode was filmed in Vancouver; primary photography for all subsequent episodes took place on the Fox lot in Century City, Los Angeles. Bryan Singer chose the university near his hometown, West Windsor, New Jersey, as the show&#x27;s fictional setting. Princeton University&#x27;s Frist Campus Center is the source of the aerial views of Princeton–Plainsboro Teaching Hospital seen in the series. Some filming took place at the University of Southern California for the season-three episode &quot;Half-Wit&quot;, which guest-starred Dave Matthews and Kurtwood Smith. Part of &quot;House&quot;″s sixth season was filmed at the abandoned Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, in Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, as the fictional Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital.

===Title sequence===
The opening sequence begins with an MRI of a head with an image of the boxed &quot;H&quot; from the logo (the international symbol for hospital) in the foreground. This is then overlaid with an image of Dr. House&#x27;s face taken from the pilot episode with the show&#x27;s full title appearing across his face. House&#x27;s head then fades and the show&#x27;s title is underlined and has the &quot;M.D.&quot; appear next to it, producing the entire logo of the show. This was the full extent of the title sequence in the pilot episode. All subsequent episodes contain a longer sequence including the names of the six featured cast members and creator David Shore. Laurie&#x27;s name appears first, followed by the names of the five other featured cast members in alphabetical order (Edelstein, Epps, Leonard, Morrison, and Spencer), then Shore.

After the show&#x27;s title fades, an aerial view of PPTH (actually various Princeton University buildings, primarily Frist Campus Center) is followed by a series of images accompanying each member&#x27;s name; most are shown next to, or superimposed upon, illustrations of human anatomy. Laurie&#x27;s name appears next to a model of a human head with the brain exposed; Edelstein&#x27;s name appears next to a visual effects–produced graphic of an angiogram of the heart. Epps&#x27;s name is superimposed upon a rib cage X-ray; Leonard&#x27;s name appears on a drawing of the two hemispheres of the brain. The producers originally wanted to include an image of a cane and an image of a Vicodin bottle, but Fox objected. Morrison&#x27;s title card was thus lacking an image; an aerial shot of rowers on Princeton University&#x27;s Lake Carnegie was finally agreed upon to accompany her name. Spencer&#x27;s name appears next to an old-fashioned anatomical drawing of a spine. Between the presentations of Spencer and Shore&#x27;s names is a scene of House and his three original team members walking down one of the hospital&#x27;s hallways. Jacobs said that most of the backgrounds have no specific meaning; however, the final image—the text &quot;created by David Shore&quot; superimposed upon a human neck—connotes that Shore is &quot;the brain of the show&quot;. The sequence was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design in 2005. The title sequence continued to credit Spencer and Morrison, even when their characters were reduced to background roles during seasons four and five, and Morrison even after hers was written out. A new opening sequence was introduced in season seven to accommodate the changes in the cast, removing Morrison&#x27;s name and including Jacobson&#x27;s and Wilde&#x27;s. It was updated in season eight, removing Edelstein&#x27;s and Wilde&#x27;s names and adding Annable&#x27;s and Yi&#x27;s.

The series&#x27; original opening theme, as heard in the United States, comprises instrumental portions of &quot;Teardrop&quot; by Massive Attack. The piece was used in part because of the distinct tempo which roughly mimics the sound of a beating human heart. An acoustic version of &quot;Teardrop&quot;, with guitar and vocals by José González, is heard as background music during the season-four finale. Because of rights issues, broadcasts in many European countries changed the first season opening to an original piece of music by Scott Donaldson and Richard Nolan. From the second season onward, a new intro composed by Jason Derlatka and Jon Ehrlich was used instead. These changes were later maintained for use on syndicated streaming platforms.

==Series overview==

Gregory House, M.D., often construed as a misanthropic medical genius, heads a team of diagnosticians at the Princeton–Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. The series is structured around a central plot with some supporting secondary stories and narratives that cross over seasons. Most episodes revolve around the diagnosis of a primary patient and start with a cold open set outside the hospital, showing events ending with the onset of the patient&#x27;s symptoms. The typical episode follows the team in their attempts to diagnose and treat the patient&#x27;s illness, which often fail until the patient&#x27;s condition is critical. They usually treat only patients whom other doctors have not accurately diagnosed, and House routinely rejects cases he does not find interesting.

Typically, the patient is misdiagnosed at least once which usually causes further complications, but the nature of the complications often provides new evidence which helps them diagnose the patient correctly. House often tends to arrive at the correct diagnosis seemingly out of the blue, often inspired by a passing remark made by another character. Diagnoses range from relatively common to very rare diseases.

The team faces many diagnostic difficulties from patients&#x27; concealment of symptoms, circumstances, or personal histories, so House frequently proclaims during the team&#x27;s deliberations, &quot;The patient is lying&quot;, or mutters &quot;Everybody lies&quot;; such an assumption guides House&#x27;s decisions and diagnoses and makes housebreaking a routine tactic. Because many of his hypotheses are based on epiphanies or controversial insights, he often has trouble obtaining permission for medical procedures he considers necessary from his superior, who in all but the final season is hospital administrator Dr. Lisa Cuddy. This is especially the case when the proposed procedures involve a high degree of risk or are ethically questionable. Frequent disagreements occur between House and his team, especially Dr. Allison Cameron, whose standards of medical ethics are more conservative than those of the other characters.

Like all of the hospital&#x27;s doctors, House is required to treat patients in the facility&#x27;s walk-in clinic. His grudging fulfillment of this duty, or his creative methods of avoiding it, constitute a recurring subplot, which often serves as the series&#x27; comic relief. During clinic duty, House confounds patients with unwelcome observations into their personal lives, eccentric prescriptions, and unorthodox treatments. However, after seeming to be inattentive to their complaints, he regularly impresses them with rapid and accurate diagnoses. Analogies with some of the simple cases in the clinic occasionally inspire insights that help solve the team&#x27;s case.
A significant plot element is House&#x27;s use of Vicodin to manage pain, caused by an infarction in the quadriceps muscle of his right leg five years before the show&#x27;s first season, which also forces him to use a cane. In the first-season 11th episode &quot;Detox&quot;, House admits he is addicted to Vicodin but says he does not have a problem because the pills &quot;let me do my job, and they take away my pain&quot;. His addiction has led his colleagues Cuddy and Dr. James Wilson to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times. When he has no access to Vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain, he occasionally self-medicates with other narcotic analgesics such as morphine, oxycodone, and methadone. House also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty and classifies himself as a &quot;big drinker&quot;. Toward the end of season five, House begins to hallucinate; after eliminating other possible diagnoses, Wilson and he determine that his Vicodin addiction is the most likely cause. House goes into denial about this for a brief time, but at the close of the season finale, he commits himself to Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital. In the following season&#x27;s debut episode, House leaves Mayfield with his addiction under control. However, about a year and a half later, in season seven&#x27;s 15th episode, &quot;Bombshells&quot;, House reacts to the news that Cuddy possibly has kidney cancer by taking Vicodin, and he returns to his addiction.

==Cast and characters==

===Main characters===

Throughout &quot;House&quot;″s run, six of the main actors have received star billing. All of them play doctors who work at the fictional Princeton–Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), the title character, was educated at Johns Hopkins University and heads the Department of Diagnostic Medicine. House describes himself as &quot;a board-certified diagnostician with a double specialty of infectious disease and nephrology&quot;. Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard), House&#x27;s one true friend, is the head of the Department of Oncology. Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), an endocrinologist, is House&#x27;s boss, as she is the hospital&#x27;s dean of medicine and chief administrator. House has a complex relationship with Cuddy, and their interactions often involve a high degree of innuendo and sexual tension. In the sixth episode of season five, &quot;Joy&quot;, they kiss for the first time. Their physical relationship does not progress any further during the fifth season; in the season five finale, House believes he and Cuddy had sex, but this is a hallucination brought on by House&#x27;s Vicodin addiction. In the finale of season six, Cuddy tells House she loves him. They kiss and agree to try being a couple. Throughout season seven, House and Cuddy try to make their relationship work, but Cuddy eventually breaks it off because of House&#x27;s addiction. House struggles to deal with this and, in the season-seven finale, drives his car into Cuddy&#x27;s living room in anger. As Lisa Edelstein left the show before season eight, after this incident Cuddy leaves the hospital and House never sees her again.

House&#x27;s original team of diagnosticians consists of Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), a neurologist; Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer), an intensivist; and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), an immunologist. In the season-three episode &quot;Family&quot;, Foreman announces his resignation, telling House, &quot;I don&#x27;t want to turn into you&quot;. During the season finale, House tells Chase that he has either learned everything he can, or nothing at all, and dismisses him from the team. Cameron, who has developed an affection for Chase, soon resigns. This leaves House without a team for the season-four premiere.

Under orders from Cuddy to recruit a new team, House considers 40 doctors. Season four&#x27;s early episodes focus on his selection process, structured as a reality TV–style elimination contest (Jacobs referred to it as a &quot;version of &quot;Survivor&quot;&quot;). House assigns each applicant a number between one and 40, and pares them down to seven finalists. He assesses their performance in diagnostic cases, assisted by Foreman, who returns to the department after his dismissal from another hospital for House-like behavior. While Foreman&#x27;s return means only two slots are open, House tricks Cuddy into allowing him to hire three new assistants. He ultimately selects Dr. Chris Taub (Peter Jacobson), a former plastic surgeon; Dr. Lawrence Kutner (Kal Penn), a sports medicine specialist; and Dr. Remy &quot;Thirteen&quot; Hadley (Olivia Wilde), an internist (nicknamed for her number in the elimination contest). In the season finale, Thirteen discovers she has, as she had long dreaded, inherited Huntington&#x27;s disease, which is incurable, from her mother.

In the 11th episode of season five, &quot;Joy to the World&quot;, Foreman and Thirteen engage in a passionate kiss. Thirteen is at first reluctant to start a relationship with Foreman, but the two eventually begin dating and are still together at the end of the season. They break up early in season six. In the 20th episode of season five, &quot;Simple Explanation&quot;, Kutner is found dead in his apartment with a gunshot wound to the head. Because Kutner left no note, House suspects , though the death is accepted by the other characters as a suicide.

In the seventh episode of season two, &quot;Hunting&quot;, Cameron and Chase have a one-night stand. In the middle of season three, they initiate a sexual relationship that Cameron insists be casual; when Chase declares that he &quot;wants more&quot;, Cameron ends the affair. By the end of the season, however, Cameron recognizes that she has romantic feelings for Chase and they begin a serious relationship. After leaving the diagnostic team, they assume different roles at PPTH, Cameron as a senior attending physician in the emergency room and Chase as a surgeon. They become engaged in the season-five episode &quot;Saviors&quot; (the episode immediately following Kutner&#x27;s suicide) and are married in the season finale. When Chase rejoins House&#x27;s team in season six, Cameron leaves her husband and the hospital in &quot;Teamwork&quot;, the season&#x27;s eighth episode. She returns as a guest character in &quot;Lockdown&quot;, nine episodes later.

Early in season seven, Thirteen takes an unexplained leave of absence. Cuddy orders House to fill her position with another woman, but eventually makes the choice for him: medical student Dr. Martha M. Masters (Amber Tamblyn), who makes her first appearance in the season&#x27;s sixth episode. Thirteen returns in &quot;The Dig&quot;—the season&#x27;s 18th episode and the show&#x27;s 150th—in which the reason for her absence is revealed: she was in prison for six months for having helped euthanize her brother, who was suffering from advanced Huntington&#x27;s. While Jacobson and Wilde play central characters (as did Penn), they did not receive star billing until season seven. They were credited as &quot;Also Starring&quot;, with their names appearing after the opening sequence. In season seven, Jacobson and Wilde received star billing; new regular cast member Tamblyn did not.

===Recurring characters===
The first six seasons of &quot;House&quot; each included one or more recurring featured characters, who appear in multiple-episode story arcs. In season one, Edward Vogler (Chi McBride), the billionaire owner of a pharmaceutical company, appears in five episodes. He donates $100 million to PPTH in return for chairing its board. Vogler represented an attempt to introduce a villain, a move urged by Fox. By the time the Vogler episodes began to air, the show had become a hit and the character was soon dropped. Shore said the concept of a villainous boss was not really viable for the series: &quot;It&#x27;s called &quot;House&quot;. The audience knows he&#x27;ll never get fired.&quot;

Stacy Warner (Sela Ward), House&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, appears in the final two episodes of the first season, and seven episodes of season two. She wants House to treat her husband, Mark Warner (Currie Graham), whom House diagnoses with acute intermittent porphyria in the season-one finale. Stacy and House grow close again, but House eventually tells Stacy to go back to Mark, which devastates her.

Michael Tritter (David Morse), a police detective, appears in several season-three episodes. He tries to extract an apology from House, who left Tritter in an examination room with a thermometer in his rectum. After House refuses to apologize, Tritter brings him up on charges of unprescribed narcotics possession and forces him to attend rehabilitation. When the case reaches court, Cuddy perjures herself for House and the case is dismissed. The judge reprimands Tritter for pursuing House to excess, and tells House that she thinks he &quot;has better friends than he deserves&quot;, referring to Cuddy&#x27;s 11th-hour testimony on his behalf. House is sentenced to one night in jail for contempt of court and finishes his rehabilitation under the influence of Vicodin.

The candidates for House&#x27;s new diagnostics team are season four&#x27;s primary recurring characters. In addition to the three who are chosen, the other four finalists are Jeffrey Cole (Edi Gathegi), a medical geneticist; Travis Brennan (Andy Comeau), an epidemiologist; Henry Dobson (Carmen Argenziano), a former medical school admissions officer; and Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek), an interventional radiologist whom House nicknames &quot;Cutthroat Bitch&quot;. Each of the four departs the show after elimination, except for Volakis, who appears throughout the season, having started a relationship with Wilson. In the two-part season finale, Volakis attempts to shepherd a drunken House home when Wilson is unavailable. They are involved in a bus crash, which leads to her death. She reappears in a recurring role late in season five, and again in the season eight series finale, as hallucinations by House.

Private investigator Lucas Douglas (Michael Weston), a character inspired in part by Shore&#x27;s love of &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, appears in three episodes of season five. House initially hires Douglas to spy on Wilson, who has ended their friendship after Volakis&#x27;s death (the friendship is subsequently rekindled). House later pays Douglas to look into the private lives of his team members and Cuddy. If the character had been accepted by the audience, plans existed to feature him as the lead in a spin-off show. In September 2008, Shore spoke to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; about his vision for the character: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to do just another medical show. What does excite me in terms of writing is the choices people make and the nature of right and wrong... and a private investigator can approach that question much more readily than a doctor can.&quot; There was no show featuring Douglas on the fall 2009 network television schedule. He returns to &quot;House&quot; in season six as Cuddy&#x27;s boyfriend. They are briefly engaged until Cuddy breaks it off, realizing that she is in love with House.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;House&quot; received largely positive reviews on its debut; the series was considered a bright spot amid Fox&#x27;s schedule, which at the time was largely filled with reality shows. Season one holds a Metacritic score of 75 out of 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews. Matt Roush of &quot;TV Guide&quot; said that the program was an &quot;uncommon cure for the common medical drama&quot;. &quot;New York Daily News&quot; critic David Bianculli applauded the &quot;high caliber of acting and script&quot;. &quot;The Onion&quot;″s &quot;A.V. Club&quot; approvingly described it as the &quot;nastiest&quot; black comedy from FOX since 1996&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Profit&quot;. &quot;New York&quot; John Leonard called the series &quot;medical TV at its most satisfying and basic&quot;, while &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;″s Matthew Gilbert appreciated that the show did not attempt to hide the flaws of the characters to assuage viewers&#x27; fears about &quot;HMO factories&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot;″s Brian Lowry, less impressed, wrote that the show relied on &quot;by-the-numbers storytelling, albeit in a glossy package&quot;. Tim Goodman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described it as &quot;mediocre&quot; and unoriginal. Mikhail Varshavski, a Russian-American Osteopathic Doctor, reviewed the medical content of &quot;House&quot; on his YouTube channel. According to Varshavski, the medical information presented on the show was usually fundamentally accurate though often highly exaggerated for dramatic effect, but he described Gregory House&#x27;s tendency to quickly use invasive tests and procedures as outside the medical mainstream.

General critical reaction to the character of Gregory House was particularly positive. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called him &quot;the most electrifying new main character to hit television in years&quot;. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;″s Rob Owen found him &quot;fascinatingly unsympathetic&quot;. Critics have compared House to fictional detectives Nero Wolfe, Hercule Poirot, and Adrian Monk, and to Perry Cox, a cantankerous doctor on the television show &quot;Scrubs&quot;. One book-length study of the series finds a powerful kinship between House and another famous TV doctor, Hawkeye Pierce of &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Laurie&#x27;s performance in the role has been widely praised. The &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;″s Goodman called him &quot;a wonder to behold&quot; and &quot;about the only reason to watch &quot;House&quot;&quot;.

Critics have also reacted positively to the show&#x27;s original supporting cast, which the &quot;Post&quot;″s Shales called a &quot;first-rate ensemble&quot;. Leonard&#x27;s portrayal of Dr. Wilson has been considered Emmy Award worthy by critics with &quot;TV Guide&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, and &quot;USA Today&quot;. Bianculli of the &quot;Daily News&quot; was happy to see Edelstein &quot;was finally given a deservedly meaty co-starring role&quot;. Freelance critic Daniel Fienberg was disappointed that Leonard and Edelstein have not received more recognition for their performances.

Reaction to the major shifts of season four was mixed. &quot;With the new crew in place &quot;House&quot; takes on a slightly more energized feel&quot;, wrote Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk. &quot;And the set up [sic] for the fifth season is quite brilliant.&quot; &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;″s Alan Sepinwall wrote, &quot;The extended, enormous job audition gave the writers a chance to reinvigorate the show and fully embrace Laurie&#x27;s comic genius&quot;. Mary McNamara of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, on the other hand, took issue with the developments: &quot;the cast just kept getting bigger, the stories more scattered and uneven until you had a bunch of great actors forced to stand around watching Hugh Laurie hold the show together by the sheer force of his will&quot;. &quot;USA Today&quot;″s Robert Bianco cheered the season finale: &quot;Talk about saving the best for last. With two fabulous, heartbreaking hours ... the writers rescued a season that had seemed diffuse, overcrowded and perhaps too ambitious for its own good.&quot;

Season five of &quot;House&quot; was met with a more positive response in comparison to the previous season. It holds a Metacritic score of 77 out of 100, based on ten reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. It also holds a 100% approval rating on aggregate review website Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 8.1 based on nine collected reviews.
&quot;USA Today&quot; praised Laurie&#x27;s performance and the repercussions of the season-four finale, stating &quot;a carry-over from last season&#x27;s brilliant finale, House is firmly in the forefront. And when you have an actor of Hugh Laurie&#x27;s range, depth and charisma, putting him center-stage makes perfect sense, particularly when you&#x27;ve written a story that explores the character and his primary relationships in a way that seems integral to the series&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; noted that &quot;The show pays more attention to relationships we care about, hints at a sensible number of new ones that show some promise, and thus doesn&#x27;t rely on obscure medical mysteries to carry the whole dramatic burden&quot;, and noted that &quot;the prognosis for this season could be better than last season seemed to foreshadow&quot;. Mary McNamara of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; highlighted the performances of the cast, especially Michael Weston as detective Lucas Douglas, calling him a &quot;delightful addition&quot;. She concluded, &quot;So different is the premiere that the savvy &quot;House&quot; (and Fox) viewer may expect the revelation that it was all a fever dream. That does not seem to be the case, and one assumes that Laurie and the writers will be bringing a different version of their now-iconic character back to Princeton. Not too different, of course, but different enough.&quot; Conversely, The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Maureen Ryan disliked Weston&#x27;s character, calling him &quot;An unwelcome distraction ... an irritating pipsqueak&quot;. She continued saying &quot;&quot;House&quot; used to be one of the best shows on TV, but it&#x27;s gone seriously off the rails&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; felt that the show had &quot;lost its sense of humour&quot;. The focus on Thirteen and her eventual involvement with Foreman also came under particular criticism.

At the end of the show&#x27;s run, Steven Tong of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;House&quot; had, in its final seasons, become a rather sentimental show&quot;. In &quot;New York Magazine&quot;&#x27;s blog &#x27;Vulture&#x27;, Margaret Lyons wrote, &quot;More than a hospital drama or a character piece or anything else, &quot;House&quot; is a complex meditation on misery.&quot; But, continued Lyons, there is a line between &quot;enlightened cynicism&quot; and &quot;misery-entropy&quot;, and &quot;as the show wore on, its dramatic flare dimmed while its agony flare burned ever brighter.&quot; Alan Sepinwall wrote, &quot;The repetition and muck of [the] middle seasons ultimately severed whatever emotional connection I had to House&#x27;s personal struggles.&quot;

In 2007, &quot;House&quot; placed #62 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; &quot;New TV Classics&quot; list. The show was declared the second-highest-rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002–2012). The show was ranked the 74th best-written television series in a 2013 survey of Writers Guild of America West members.

====Critics&#x27; top ten lists====
After its first five seasons, &quot;House&quot; was included in various critics&#x27; top-ten lists; these are listed below in order of rank.




===U.S. television ratings===
In its first season, &quot;House&quot; ranked twenty-fourth among all television series and was the ninth-most popular primetime program among women. Aided by a lead-in from the widely popular &quot;American Idol&quot;, the following three seasons of the program each ranked in the top ten among all viewers. &quot;House&quot; reached its peak Nielsen ratings in its third season, attracting an average of 19.4 million viewers per episode. According to Jacobs, the production team was surprised that the show garnered such a large audience. In its fifth season, the show attracted 12.0 million viewers per episode and slipped to nineteenth place overall. It remained Fox&#x27;s most popular show other than &quot;American Idol&quot;.

The most-watched episode of &quot;House&quot; is the season four episode &quot;Frozen&quot;, which aired after Super Bowl XLII. It attracted slightly more than 29 million viewers. &quot;House&quot; ranked third for the week, equaling the rating of &quot;American Idol&quot; and being surpassed only by the Super Bowl itself and the post-game show. Below is a table of &quot;House&quot;″s seasonal rankings in the U.S. television market, based on average total viewers per episode. Each U.S. network television season starts in September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.

===Awards and honors===

&quot;House&quot; has received many awards and award nominations. In 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 Laurie was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. The Emmy board also nominated &quot;House&quot; for Outstanding Drama Series in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009, but the show never won the award. For the season one episode &quot;Three Stories&quot;, David Shore won a writing Emmy in 2005 and the Humanitas Prize in 2006. Director Greg Yaitanes received the 2008 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series, for directing &quot;House&#x27;s Head&quot;, the first part of season four&#x27;s two-episode finale.

The show has been nominated for six Golden Globe Awards and received two. Hugh Laurie has been nominated six times for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama; he won in 2006 and again in 2007. In 2008 the series received its first nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama. &quot;House&quot; was nominated for best dramatic series again the following year, but did not win in the category.

The show received a 2005 Peabody Award for what the Peabody board called an &quot;unorthodox lead character—a misanthropic diagnostician&quot; and for &quot;cases fit for a medical Sherlock Holmes&quot;, which helped make &quot;House&quot; &quot;the most distinctive new doctor drama in a decade&quot;. The American Film Institute (AFI) included &quot;House&quot; in its 2005 list of 10 Television Programs of the Year.

In 2011, &quot;House&quot; won four People&#x27;s Choice Awards: favorite TV drama; favorite dramatic actor and actress for Laurie and Edelstein; and favorite TV doctor.

Laurie won the Screen Actors Guild&#x27;s award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series in both 2007 and 2009. Writer Lawrence Kaplow won a Writers Guild of America Award in 2006 for the season two episode &quot;Autopsy&quot;. In 2007, the show won a Creative Arts Emmy Award for prosthetic makeup.

In 2005, Laurie appeared on the cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot; as &quot;TV&#x27;s Sexiest Man&quot;. In 2008, House was voted second-sexiest television doctor ever, behind &quot;ER&quot;″s Doug Ross (George Clooney). In 2012, &quot;House&quot; was named the most popular current TV show in the world by the Guinness World Records.

== Distribution ==
In 2008, &quot;House&quot; was distributed in a total of 66 countries. With an audience of over 81.8 million worldwide, it was the most-watched television show on the globe and far surpassed the viewership figures of the leading TV dramas the previous two years (&quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;). The following year, it placed second in the world after &quot;CSI&quot;.

&quot;House&quot; episodes premiered on FOX in the United States and Global in Canada. The show was the third-most popular on Canadian television in 2008. That same year, &quot;House&quot; was the top-rated television program in Germany, the number 2 show in Italy, and number 3 in the Czech Republic. The series was also very popular in France, Spain, Sweden, and the Netherlands. In the United Kingdom, the first four seasons were broadcast on Five. Pay satellite TV channel Sky1 acquired first-run rights beginning with season five, amid interest a few years earlier from free to air rivals ITV. In Australia the show aired on Network Ten, and in New Zealand, originally on TV3 and then on TVNZ Duke, and in Ireland on TV3 and it&#x27;s sibling cable channel 3e.

Episodes of the show are also available online for download: Amazon Video on Demand, iTunes Store and the Zune Marketplace offer episodes from all of seasons 1 through 8. In 2007, NBCUniversal (the show&#x27;s distributor) and Apple Inc. (iTunes&#x27; owner) had a disagreement that temporarily kept the fourth season off iTunes. In a statement to the press, Apple claimed that NBCUniversal wanted to drive up the per-episode price to $4.99. In September 2008, it was reported that the issue between Apple and NBC had been resolved. Some episodes are available in streaming video on Fox&#x27;s official &quot;House&quot; webpage and all eight seasons are available on Netflix.

Seasons of the show and box sets were released on DVD encoded for regions 1, 2 and 4. Special features, such as anamorphic widescreen (the original release is letterboxed), depend on region.

===DVD and Blu-ray releases===
==Merchandise==
For a charity auction, T-shirts bearing the phrase &quot;Everybody Lies&quot; were sold for a limited time starting on April 23, 2007, on Housecharitytees.com. Proceeds from sales of those shirts and others with the phrase &quot;Normal&#x27;s Overrated&quot; went to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). &quot;House&quot; cast and crew members also regularly attended fundraisers for NAMI and have featured in ads for the organization that appeared in &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The show&#x27;s efforts raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for the charity. Jacobs said that through their association with NAMI, they hoped to take &quot;some of the stigma off that illness&quot;.

Nettwerk released the &quot;House M.D. Original Television Soundtrack&quot; album on September 18, 2007. The soundtrack includes full length versions of songs featured in &quot;House&quot; and previously unreleased songs especially recorded for the series. In 2008, the Spanish game company Exelweiss designed a cellphone game for the show, which was released in both Spanish and English versions.

In June 2009, Legacy Interactive announced a licensing agreement with Universal Pictures Digital Platforms Group (UPDPG) to develop a video game based on the series, in which players step into the roles of House&#x27;s diagnostic team to deal with five unusual medical cases. The game, released in May 2010, included a minigame calling upon the player to &quot;navigate a restaurant-placemat-style maze, in which a giant sandwich must avoid hungry physicians on its way to Dr. House&#x27;s office.&quot; It received an F from &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;; however, Legacy updated the game by August 2010.

<text>Kohlit or Kohalit () is a place name used in rabbinic literature, and more famously in the Copper Scroll, a unique &quot;treasure map&quot; discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). It is unknown whether the two sources are referring to the same place.

==Copper Scroll==
Kohlit is a place, possibly a hill, mentioned several times in the Copper Scroll, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Kohlit has become something of a modern-day El Dorado for treasure hunters.

It is indicated as the area where the second Copper Scroll, containing a more detailed list, is buried.

==Babylonian Talmud==
Kohalit is also named in b. Qid. 66a (b. Qiddushin 66a; that is chapter 66a of tractate Kiddushin of the Babylonian Talmud) as an area east of the Jordan River where Alexander Jannaeus had led a successful military campaign.

<text>Luis Altamirano Talavera (July 5, 1867 – July 25, 1938) was a Chilean military officer, minister, Vice President of the Republic and finally president of the Government Junta of Chile between 1924 and 1925.

He was born in Concepción on the son of Eulogio Altamirano Araceda and Antonia Adelina Talavera Appleby. He studied law and started a career in the ministry of Justice. During the 1891 Chilean Civil War, he joined the congressional army as an artillery captain. He was a lieutenant colonel by the end of it, a year later. After the end of revolution he left the army, only to return in 1897. The year after, he was named commander of Regiment Nº3 of artillery. In 1908 was promoted to full colonel, and named Under-Chief of General staff. In 1911, he was sent as military attaché to the Chilean embassy in Berlin. In 1912, was promoted to brigadier general, and named Inspector General of artillery, and Army Chief of staff. In 1919 was promoted to division general, and named commander of the II Division. In 1922, was named army inspector general, the highest position in the army at the time. As such he was in charge of the Chilean delegation to the swearing-in of a new president of Argentina. That year he also was named Minister of War and Navy, by President Arturo Alessandri.

On September 5, 1924, and as a consequence of the episode known as the &quot;Ruido de sables&quot;, a group of young military officers, led by Colonel Marmaduque Grove and Major Carlos Ibáñez del Campo, demanded of President Arturo Alessandri the dismissal of three of his ministers, including the minister of War; the enactment of a labor code, the passage of an income tax law, and the improvement of the military salaries. Alessandri had no option but to appoint General Altamirano, then head of the army, as interior minister to head a new cabinet. On September 8, General Altamirano appeared in front of Congress to demand the passage of eight laws, including Alessandri&#x27;s labor code and the income tax proposal. Congress didn&#x27;t dare to protest, and the laws were passed in a matter of hours.

At that point, Alessandri felt that he had become just a pawn of the military and on September 9, he resigned, and requested asylum at the US Embassy. General Altamirano became vice president (a position reserved, in the absence of a president, to the interior minister, according to the Chilean constitution.) Congress refused to accept Alessandri&#x27;s resignation, and instead granted him a six-month constitutional leave of absence. Alessandri left the country immediately for Italy.

On September 11, General Altamirano established a military Junta to rule the country, together with Vice-Admiral Francisco Nef and General Juan Pablo Bennett, retaining the position of president. He assumed dictatorial powers and proceeded to close Congress. During his conservative rule, he tried several measures to control the economic crisis and to reform the local bureaucracy. Nonetheless, he lost the confidence of the &quot;military committee&quot; who had elevated him to power, and was deposed and arrested by another military coup on January 23, 1925. On February 6, 1925, he retired from active duty and died in Santiago in 1938.

<doc id="1273611" wikidata="Q283905" url="?curid=1273611" title="Peter Durand">
<text>Peter Durand (21 October 1766 – 23 July 1822) was an English merchant who is widely credited with receiving the first patent for the idea of preserving food using tin cans. The patent (No 3372) was granted on August 25, 1810, by King George III of the United Kingdom.

The patent specifies that it was issued to Peter Durand, a merchant of Hoxton Square, Middlesex, United Kingdom, for a method of preserving animal food, vegetable food and other perishable articles using various vessels made of glass, pottery, tin or other suitable metals. The preservation procedure was to fill up a vessel with food and cap it. Vegetables were to be put in raw, whereas animal substances might either be raw or half-cooked. Then the whole item was to be heated by any means, such as an oven, stove or a steam bath, but most conveniently by immersing in water and boiling it. The boiling time was not specified, and was said to depend on the food and vessel size. Neither was the patent clear on the preservation time, which was merely said to be &quot;long&quot;. The cap was to be partly open during the whole heating and cooling procedure, but right after that, the vessel should be sealed airtight by any means, such as a cork plug, a screw-cap with a rubber seal, cementing, etc.

In his patent, Durand clearly mentions that the idea of the invention was communicated to him more than a year ago by a friend abroad. Extensive research in 19th century archives has revealed that he was French inventor Philippe de Girard. The relation between Durand and Girard has not been advertised, and the credit for the first canned food patent remains with Durand.

The patent itself consists of two distinct parts: first, the description of the original idea, and second, observations by Durand himself. Durand was clearly suspicious of the invention. However, having a curious mind, he performed a thorough test of it by himself, sealing meat, soups and milk, and boiling them as described. The original inventor had only experimented with small food volumes, whereas Durand envisioned future large scale production and therefore preserved up to 30 pounds (13.6 kg) of meat in one can. For unknown reasons, Durand used only tin cans rather than glass vessels. He arranged for the cans to sail with the Royal Navy for a period of four to six months. Several members of the Royal Society and the Royal Institution examined the food upon its arrival, and found that it was perfectly preserved.

Durand&#x27;s patent was dedicated to the preservation technique rather than to the vessel. The technique itself was developed previously by a Frenchman, Nicolas Appert. However, Appert used exclusively glass vessels whereas Durand was the first to mention in a patent use of tin cans.

After receiving the patent, Durand did not pursue canning food himself. He sold his patent in 1812 to two other Englishmen, Bryan Donkin and John Hall, for £1,000. Donkin was involved with tinning of iron from 1808 and was keen to expand it to the food industry. Donkin and Hall set up a commercial canning factory and by 1813 were producing their first canned goods for the British army. In 1818, Durand introduced tin cans in the United States by re-patenting his British patent in the US. By 1820, canned food was a recognized article in Britain and France and by 1822 in the United States.

<doc id="1273619" wikidata="Q3429874" url="?curid=1273619" title="Oh... Rosalinda!!">
<text>Oh... Rosalinda!! is a 1955 British musical comedy film by the British director-writer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The film stars Michael Redgrave, Mel Ferrer, Anthony Quayle, Ludmilla Tchérina and Anton Walbrook and features Anneliese Rothenberger and Dennis Price.

The film is based on the 1874 operetta &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; (&quot;The Bat&quot;) by Johann Strauss, but updated to take place in post-war Vienna as occupied by the four Allied powers: the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the USSR. The music, played by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra under conductor Alois Melichar, has new lyrics by Dennis Arundell, and professional singers dubbed for some of the actors. The choreography is by Alfred Rodrigues, and the production was designed by Hein Heckroth.

&quot;Oh... Rosalinda!!&quot; is a light-hearted Technicolor romp that makes full use of the new CinemaScope process, and is not just a film of a staged production but a filmic operetta.

As the film closes in the early hours at the party at the hotel Falke points the message to the representatives of the four powers, while thanking them for their presence: &quot;even the dearest friend loses his attraction if he overstays... so if you don&#x27;t mind, go home, please go home&quot;; at which the waltz &quot;Brüderlein, Brüderlein und Schwesterlein&quot;/&quot;Brothers, brothers and sisters&quot; (&#x27;Be my friend&#x27;) starts up.

==Plot==
In 1955 Vienna, during its post-war occupation, the black-market dealer Dr. Falke (Anton Walbrook) moves freely through the French, British, American and Russian sectors, dealing in champagne and caviar amongst the highest echelons of the allied powers. After a costume party, French Colonel Gabriel Eisenstein (Michael Redgrave) plays a practical joke on a drunken Falke, depositing him, asleep and dressed as a bat, in the lap of a patriotic Russian statue, to be discovered the following morning by irate Russian soldiers. Falke is nearly arrested until his friend General Orlofsky (Anthony Quayle) of the USSR intervenes. A vengeful Falke plans an elaborate practical joke on his friend, involving Orlofsky, British Major Frank (Dennis Price) who is sent to escort the French colonel to jail for his misdemeanor, Eisenstein&#x27;s beautiful wife Rosalinda (Ludmilla Tchérina), her maid Adele (Anneliese Rothenberger) and a masked ball where no one is who they seem.

Complicating matters is American Captain Alfred Westerman (Mel Ferrer), an old flame of Rosalinda who is determined to take advantage of her husband&#x27;s absence, deliberately taking the hotel room next to hers. When Major Frank, arriving to take Eisenstein into custody, catches Alfred in Rosalinda&#x27;s room, in Eisenstein&#x27;s dressing gown, he takes Alfred to be Eisenstein and arrests him (Alfred) instead. To avoid scandal, Alfred does nothing to disabuse Frank of his error. Later that evening, at the masked ball hosted by Orlofsky, Adele, wearing one of her mistress&#x27;s gowns, is spotted by Eisenstein, who is unable to do anything about it (as he is supposed already to be in jail and is attending the ball only with the connivance of Orlofsky, at Falke&#x27;s instigation) and she catches the eye of both Orlofsky and Frank. When the masked Rosalinda arrives, Eisenstein pursues her but she flees with his watch – which Falke slyly tells him will reappear again at his home.

At midnight, Eisenstein presents himself at the jail but when he finds Alfred there, still in his (Eisenstein&#x27;s) dressing gown, he (Eisenstein) realizes that Alfred must have been courting Rosalinda at their hotel, so he rushes back there to confront her, followed by Alfred and Frank, the mistaken identity having been uncovered. She retorts by showing him the watch he had given her at the ball, and he begs forgiveness. All this is overhead by the rest of Orlofsky&#x27;s party guests (who have all found their way back to the hotel) and Falke admits that he was behind the charade. As all sing and dance, Alfred allows himself to be re-arrested in Eisenstein&#x27;s place.

==Cast==
Cast notes:
Among the ladies, gentlemen and dancers of the cast were John Schlesinger, Peter Darrell, Joyce Blair and Jill Ireland. On some websites Roy Kinnear is listed in the cast, no role specified, but not on the BFI Screenonline page.

==Production==
&quot;Oh... Rosalinda&quot; was filmed at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, and on location in London.

Powell and Pressburger had suffered through four box office disappointments in a row before this film, which is one reason that Bing Crosby, Maurice Chevalier and Orson Welles were approached about playing the roles of Alfred, Eisenstein and Orlovsky – and &quot;Oh... Rosalinda!!&quot; too was not commercially successful. Arundell had already worked with Powell and Pressburger, providing a translation for the film &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;. A reviewer of the 2019 Network British Film DVD restoration however notes Heckroth&#x27;s “stagey expressionism”, “dazzling cinematography aplenty”, and suggests that it prefigures “political operetta deconstructions” of more recent years.

Several of the singing cast would later appear on stage and record in the original piece; Rothenberger and Barabás together sang in excerpts from the operetta for Electrola around the time of the film, and Rothenberger made further full recordings under Hollreiser (1960), Danon (1964) and Boskovsky (1971), for the latter switching to Rosalinde. Walter Berry made five recordings of &quot;Fledermaus&quot; - singing Frank (1959, 1964, 1971) and Falke (1960, video 1980). Walbrook had played Strauss in &quot;Walzerkrieg&quot; in 1933, and in &quot;Wiener Walzer&quot; in 1951, both German-language films.

A record of musical excerpts derived from the soundtrack of the film was issued on Nixa LP NLP 18001.

A restoration from the 35 mm CinemaScope original camera negative was undertaken prior to a Blu-ray and DVD re-issue in 2019; this included automated and manual dirt and damage removal and correction of instability, warping and density fluctuation.

<text>Ill Met by Moonlight (1957), released in the US as Night Ambush (which is eleven minutes shorter than the British release), is a film by the British writer-director-producer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, and the last movie they made together through their production company &quot;The Archers&quot;. The film, which stars Dirk Bogarde and features Marius Goring, David Oxley, and Cyril Cusack, is based on the 1950 book &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight: The Abduction of General Kreipe&quot; by W. Stanley Moss, which is an account of events during the author&#x27;s service on Crete during World War II as an agent of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The title is a quotation from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, and the book features the young agents&#x27; capture and evacuation of the German general Heinrich Kreipe.

==Plot==
During World War II, the Greek island of Crete is occupied by the Nazis. British officers Major Patrick Leigh Fermor DSO and Captain Bill Stanley Moss MC of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) land on the island and meet with other British agents and members of the Cretan resistance. In April 1944, they kidnap General Kreipe, the German commander of the island&#x27;s occupying forces and, in disguise, drive his car through a number of German checkpoints until they abandon it and set off on foot with the General.

Travelling mainly by night across mountainous territory, the group has to evade surveillance by German search parties looking for the General, but is given assistance by townspeople and other resistance partisans. Along the way, Kreipe seems to be resigned to having to cooperate, but he leaves personal tokens at several stops as clues for searchers to follow. He also feigns an injury to his shoulder to slow down the group&#x27;s progress. After a final push to reach a secluded cove on the far side of the island where they are to be picked up by the Royal Navy, the group finds the area occupied by German troops.

Kreipe offers Niko, a young boy travelling with the group, a gold coin, telling him that if he goes down to the beach, he will get a pair of German jackboots. The British officers ask the child to deliver a message to local partisans. Niko seems to fall for the ruse. The group watches the shore from above and sees him go into the German camp. Kreipe, exulting, tells the British they are foolish for trusting Cretan &quot;barbarians&quot;. He tells them he bribed the boy. But instead of heading up the hills to engage with the British and retrieve the General, the Germans march off. Fermor tells Kreipe that they are heading into a partisan ambush.

The British and Cretans, along with Kreipe arrive at the beach and are joined by the partisans. The general removes the sling. On board the British ship that is to transport them to Cairo, the Middle East headquarters of British forces, Fermor and Moss return the gold coin he gave Niko, who is going to safety with them. They also return the items that the General planted during their trek, comparing them to the &quot;breadcrumbs&quot; left by Hansel in the story of Hansel and Gretel and the Cretan Resistance, once disdained by the General, to the &quot;birds&quot; who take the breadcrumbs in the story. Kreipe compliments them on the professionalism of their mission. On deck, Niko sings &quot;Filedem&quot; while proudly polishing his new German jackboots.

==Cast==
*Dirk Bogarde as Major Patrick &quot;Paddy&quot; Leigh Fermor aka &quot;Philedem&quot;
*Marius Goring as Major General Heinrich Kreipe
*David Oxley as Captain W. Stanley &quot;Billy&quot; Moss, M.C.
*Dimitri Andreas as Niko Soldan Emeris
*Cyril Cusack as Captain Sandy Rendel
*Laurence Payne as Manoli
*Wolfe Morris as George
*Michael Gough as Andoni Zoidakis
*John Cairney as Elias
*Rowland Bartrop as Micky Akoumianakis
*Brian Worth as Stratis Saviolkis
*Paul Stassino as Yanni Katsias
*Adeeb Assaly as Zahari

Cast notes:
*Marius Goring had appeared in three other Powell and Pressburger films: &quot;The Spy in Black&quot; (1939), &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948). Goring replaced Curt Jürgens, who was the original choice to play the part of General Kreipe.
*Christopher Lee and David McCallum have small parts: Lee as a German officer in the dentist scene, and McCallum, in his film debut, as a sailor on the ship that picks up the group. Lee&#x27;s part was edited out of the 1959 American re-release of the film. A &quot;John Houseman&quot; in the cast does not appear to be the well-known actor and director John Houseman.

==Production==
Emeric Pressburger had read and bought the rights to W. Stanley Moss&#x27;s book in 1950, but production would not begin for another six years. Following the success of &quot;The Battle of the River Plate&quot; (1956, American title: &quot;Pursuit of the Graf Spee&quot;), The Archers agreed to a one-film contract with the Rank Organisation, but disagreements between Powell and Pressburger over that contract and aspects of the film production contributed to the final breakup of The Archers as a production company.

In &quot;Million Dollar Movie&quot; (1992), the second volume of Michael Powell&#x27;s memoirs, he describes &quot;Ill Met by Moonlight&quot; as one of The Archers&#x27; &quot;greatest failures,&quot; despite the film&#x27;s financial success. Part of his unhappiness is attributed to Pressburger&#x27;s screenplay, but he also describes conflicts with Rank&#x27;s studio bosses over casting, film format, and locations. Dirk Bogarde was eventually cast as Fermor, despite Powell&#x27;s misgivings, and the filming was done in VistaVision but in black-and-white. Cyprus was experiencing armed insurgency at the time, so filming took place at Pinewood Studios in England, with location shooting in the Alpes-Maritimes in France and Italy, and on the Côte d&#x27;Azur in France. Both Patrick Leigh Fermor and Xan Fielding were present on the location shots in Alpes-Maritime as advisors. The movie&#x27;s score by Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis, who had been raised on the island of Crete, was his first for motion pictures. Watching the movie again years later, Powell complained that he &quot;was surprised by how bad the film was,&quot; happy or at least content with the setting and music but especially disappointed in the performances of the lead actors and his own direction, which &quot;concentrated so much on creating a Greek atmosphere that [Powell] had no time, or invention for anything else.&quot;

Although Powell was especially unhappy with Bogarde&#x27;s performance, Patrick Leigh Fermor expressed great satisfaction with Bogarde&#x27;s representation of him.

==Box office==
The film was the seventh most popular movie at the British box office in 1957.

According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the film was &quot;in the money&quot; at the British box office in 1957.

==In popular culture==
The story was affectionately parodied by Spike Milligan in the 1957 &quot;Goon Show&quot; episode, &quot;Ill Met by Goonlight&quot;.

<text>Ralph Asher Alpher (February 3, 1921 – August 12, 2007) was an American cosmologist, who carried out pioneering work in the early 1950s on the Big Bang model, including Big Bang nucleosynthesis and predictions of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

== Childhood and education ==

Alpher was the son of a Jewish immigrant, Samuel Alpher ( Alfirevich), from Vitebsk, Russian Empire. His mother, Rose Maleson, died of stomach cancer in 1938, and his father later remarried. Alpher graduated at age 15 from Theodore Roosevelt High School in Washington, D.C., and held the ranks of Major and Commander of his school&#x27;s Cadet program. He worked in the high school theater as stage manager for two years, supplementing his family&#x27;s Depression-era income. He also learned Gregg shorthand, and in 1937 began working for the director of the American Geophysical Union as a stenographer.

In 1940, he was hired by the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Foundation, where he worked with Dr. Scott Forbush under contract for the U.S. Navy to develop ship degaussing techniques during World War II. He contributed to the development of the Mark 32 and Mark 45 detonators, torpedoes, Naval gun control, Magnetic Airborne Detection (of submarines), and other top-secret ordnance work (including the Manhattan Project), and he was recognized at the end of the War with the Naval Ordnance Development Award (December 10, 1945 — with Symbol), and another Naval Ordnance Development award in 1946. Alpher&#x27;s war time work been somewhat obscured by security classification.

From 1944 through 1955, he was employed at the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). During the daytime he was involved in the development of ballistic missiles, guidance systems, supersonics, and related subjects. In 1948, he earned his Ph.D. in physics with a theory of nucleosynthesis called neutron capture, and from 1948 onward collaborated with Dr. Robert C. Herman, also at APL, on predictions of the cosmic microwave background radiation.

He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree and advanced graduate degrees in physics from George Washington University, all the while working as a physicist on contract to the Navy, and eventually for the Johns Hopkins University APL. He met Russian-Ukrainian physicist George Gamow at the University, who subsequently took him on as his doctoral student. Gamow was a prominent Soviet defector and one of the luminaries on the GWU faculty. Alpher provided much needed mathematical ability to support Gamow&#x27;s theorizing.

Alpher wrote his doctoral thesis on &quot;The Origin of the Elements&quot;, and soon after obtaining his doctorate, made the first prediction of the existence of &quot;fossil&quot; radiation from a hypothetical singularity—the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation. This was observationally confirmed by Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs using a horn radio telescope.

While attending GWU, Alpher met Louise Ellen Simons, who was majoring in psychology at night school and working as a day secretary with the State Department. Nearly two months after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Alpher and Louise were married. At this time he had already done classified work for the U.S. Navy through the Carnegie Institution for nearly one and a half years. During a hiatus in his scientific work in early 1944, he did apply to the Navy for a commission, for which he was eligible. By this time he had done so much classified and secret work that he was no longer subject to the draft (along with about 7,000 others), and was prohibited from enlistment. That summer, he signed on to APL at Johns Hopkins University to work on another classified project — a new magnetic-influence torpedo exploder. This was badly needed since the Mark 14 torpedo, which had a poorly tested exploder that had its magnetic component turned off by order of the Chief of Naval Operations in late 1943, was badly in need of replacement (V.S. Alpher, &quot;The Submarine Review&quot;, October 2009).

== Big Bang nucleosynthesis theory ==
Alpher&#x27;s dissertation in 1948 dealt with a subject that came to be known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Nucleosynthesis is the explanation of how more complex elements are created out of simple elements in the moments following the Big Bang. Right after the Big Bang, when the temperature was extremely high, if any nuclear particles, such as neutrons and protons, became bound together (being held together by the attractive nuclear force) they would be immediately broken apart by the high energy photons (quanta of light) present in high density. In other words, at this extremely high temperature, the photons&#x27; kinetic energy would overwhelm the binding energy of the strong nuclear force. For example, if a proton and a neutron became bound together (forming deuterium), it would be immediately broken apart by a high energy photon. However, as time progressed, the universe expanded and cooled and the average energy of the photons decreased. At some point, roughly one second after the Big Bang, the attractive force of nuclear attraction would begin to win out over the lower energy photons and neutrons and protons would begin to form stable deuterium nuclei. As the universe continued to expand and cool, additional nuclear particles would bind with these light nuclei, building up heavier elements such as helium, etc.

Alpher argued that the Big Bang would create hydrogen, helium and heavier elements in the correct proportions to explain their abundance in the early universe. Alpher and Gamow&#x27;s theory originally proposed that all atomic nuclei are produced by the successive capture of neutrons, one mass unit at a time. However, later studies challenged the universality of the successive capture theory, since no element was found to have a stable isotope with an atomic mass of five or eight, hindering the production of elements beyond helium. It was eventually recognized that most of the heavy elements observed in the present universe are the result of stellar nucleosynthesis in stars, a theory largely developed by Hans Bethe, William Fowler and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar. Bethe had been a last minute addition to Alpher&#x27;s dissertation examining committee.

Since Alpher&#x27;s dissertation was perceived to be ground-breaking, over 300 people attended the dissertation defense, including the press, and articles about his predictions and a Herblock cartoon appeared in major newspapers. This was quite unusual for a doctoral dissertation.

Later the same year, collaborating with Robert Herman, Alpher predicted the temperature of the residual radiation known as cosmic microwave background radiation resulting from the hypothesized Big Bang. However, Alpher&#x27;s predictions concerning the cosmic background radiation were more or less forgotten until they were rediscovered by Robert Dicke and Yakov Zel&#x27;dovich in the early 1960s. The existence of the cosmic background radiation and its temperature were measured experimentally in 1964 by two physicists working for Bell Laboratories in New Jersey, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this work in 1978.

 Elements of Alpher&#x27;s independent dissertation were first published on April 1, 1948 in the Physical Review with three authors: Alpher, Hans Bethe and Gamow. Although his name appears on the paper, Bethe had no direct part in the development of the theory, although he later worked on related topics; Gamow added his name to make the author list &quot;Alpher, Bethe, Gamow,&quot; a pun on &quot;alpha, beta, gamma&quot; (&quot;α, β, γ&quot;), the first three letters of the Greek alphabet. Gamow joked that &quot;There was, however, a rumor that later, when the alpha, beta, gamma theory went temporarily on the rocks, Bethe seriously considered changing his name to Zacharias&quot;. When referring to Robert Herman he wrote: &quot;R. C. Herman, who stubbornly refuses to change his name to Delter.&quot; Alpher worried that the humor engendered by Gamow may have obscured his own critical role in developing the theory. With the award of the 2005 National Medal of Science, Alpher&#x27;s original work on nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background radiation prediction was recognised.

Alpher and Robert Herman were awarded the Henry Draper Medal from the National Academy of Sciences in 1993. They were also awarded the Magellanic Premium of the American Philosophical Society in 1975, the Georges Vanderlinden Physics prize of the Belgian Academy of Sciences, as well as significant awards of the New York Academy of Sciences and the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. Two Nobel Prizes in physics have been awarded for empirical work related to the cosmic background radiation — in 1978 to Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson and in 2006 to John Mather and George Smoot. Alpher and Herman (the latter, posthumously) published their own account of their work in cosmology in 2001, &quot;Genesis of the Big Bang&quot; (Oxford University Press). Published as a trade book, it received little promotion or sales in the first edition.

He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986. In 2005 Alpher was awarded the National Medal of Science. The citation for the award reads &quot;For his unprecedented work in the areas of nucleosynthesis, for the prediction that universe expansion leaves behind background radiation, and for providing the model for the Big Bang theory.&quot; The medal was presented to his son, Dr. Victor S. Alpher, on July 27, 2007 by President George W. Bush, as his father could not travel to receive the award.

== Later career ==

In 1955, Alpher moved to a position with the General Electric Company&#x27;s Research and Development Center. His primary role in his early years there was working on problems of vehicle re-entry from space. 

In 1955, both Alpher and Herman applied for positions at Iowa, where van Allen was now department chair, however, the salaries in academia were simply too low by comparison with industrial pay. Alpher also continued to collaborate with Robert Herman, who had moved to the General Motors Research Laboratory, on problems in cosmology. The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation was finally confirmed in 1964, although in retrospect many other astronomers and radio astronomers probably observed it without recognizing the cosmological significance.

From 1987 to 2004, he served as distinguished research professor of physics and astronomy at Union College in Schenectady, New York, during which time he was able to return to research and teaching. During all this time he continued to publish major peer-reviewed scientific papers and was active in community service for Public Broadcasting. Alpher was also (1987–2004) director of the Dudley Observatory. From 2005 until his death, he remained emeritus director of the Dudley Observatory and emeritus distinguished professor of physics and astronomy at Union College. 

In 1986, he was recognized with the Distinguished Alumnus Achievement Award of the George Washington University. All of his degrees were achieved by studying at night, whilst working for the Navy and Johns Hopkins APL during the daytime. In 2004 he joined the emeritus faculty at Union and was emeritus director of Dudley. He also received honorary Doctor of Science degrees from Union College and the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 

== Approach to science ==
Alpher told Joseph D&#x27;Agnese in his interview for &quot;Discover Magazine&quot;, &quot;There are two reasons you do science. One is the altruistic feeling that maybe you can contribute to mankind&#x27;s store of knowledge about the world. The other and more personal thing is you want the approbation of your peers. Pure and simple.&quot;

== Personal life and views ==
Despite raising a Jewish family, Alpher considered himself to be agnostic and humanist. 

==Family==
He and his wife, Louise, had two children and two grandchildren. 

==Death==
Alpher died following an extended illness on August 12, 2007. He had been in failing health since falling and breaking his hip in February 2007.

<doc id="1273629" wikidata="Q618684" url="?curid=1273629" title="Marginal stability">
<text>In the theory of dynamical systems and control theory, a linear time-invariant system is marginally stable if it is neither asymptotically stable nor unstable. Roughly speaking, a system is stable if it always returns to and stays near a particular state (called the steady state), and is unstable if it goes further and further away from any state, without being bounded. A marginal system, sometimes referred to as having neutral stability, is between these two types: when displaced, it does not return to near a common steady state, nor does it go away from where it started without limit.

Marginal stability, like instability, is a feature that control theory seeks to avoid; we wish that, when perturbed by some external force, a system will return to a desired state. This necessitates the use of appropriately designed control algorithms.

In econometrics, the presence of a unit root in observed time series, rendering them marginally stable, can lead to invalid regression results regarding effects of the independent variables upon a dependent variable, unless appropriate techniques are used to convert the system to a stable system.

==Continuous time==
A homogeneous continuous linear time-invariant system is marginally stable if and only if the real part of every pole (eigenvalue) in the system&#x27;s transfer-function is non-positive, one or more poles have zero real part, and all poles with zero real part are simple roots (i.e. the poles on the imaginary axis are all distinct from one another). In contrast, if all the poles have strictly negative real parts, the system is instead asymptotically stable. If the system is neither stable nor marginally stable, it is unstable.

If the system is in state space representation, marginal stability can be analyzed by deriving the Jordan normal form: if and only if the Jordan blocks corresponding to poles with zero real part are scalar is the system marginally stable.

==Discrete time==
A homogeneous discrete time linear time-invariant system is marginally stable if and only if the greatest magnitude of any of the poles (eigenvalues) of the transfer function is 1, and the poles with magnitude equal to 1 are all distinct. That is, the transfer function&#x27;s spectral radius is 1. If the spectral radius is less than 1, the system is instead asymptotically stable.

A simple example involves a single first-order linear difference equation: Suppose a state variable &quot;x&quot; evolves according to

:formula_1

with parameter &quot;a&quot; &gt; 0. If the system is perturbed to the value formula_2 its subsequent sequence of values is formula_3 If &quot;a&quot; &lt; 1, these numbers get closer and closer to 0 regardless of the starting value formula_2 while if &quot;a&quot; &gt; 1 the numbers get larger and larger without bound. But if &quot;a&quot; = 1, the numbers do neither of these: instead, all future values of &quot;x&quot; equal the value formula_5 Thus the case &quot;a&quot; = 1 exhibits marginal stability.

==System response==
A marginally stable system is one that, if given an impulse of finite magnitude as input, will not &quot;blow up&quot; and give an unbounded output, but neither will the output return to zero. A bounded offset or oscillations in the output will persist indefinitely, and so there will in general be no final steady-state output. If a continuous system is given an input at a frequency equal to the frequency of a pole with zero real part, the system&#x27;s output will increase indefinitely (this is known as pure resonance). This explains why for a system to be BIBO stable, the real parts of the poles have to be strictly negative (and not just non-positive).

A continuous system having imaginary poles, i.e. having zero real part in the pole(s), will produce sustained oscillations in the output. For example, an undamped second-order system such as the suspension system in an automobile (a mass–spring–damper system), from which the damper has been removed and spring is ideal, i.e. no friction is there, will in theory oscillate forever once disturbed. Another example is a frictionless pendulum. A system with a pole at the origin is also marginally stable but in this case there will be no oscillation in the response as the imaginary part is also zero (&quot;jw&quot; = 0 means &quot;w&quot; = 0 rad/sec). An example of such a system is a mass on a surface with friction. When a sidewards impulse is applied, the mass will move and never returns to zero. The mass will come to rest due to friction however, and the sidewards movement will remain bounded.

Since the locations of the marginal poles must be &quot;exactly&quot; on the imaginary axis or unit circle (for continuous time and discrete time systems respectively) for a system to be marginally stable, this situation is unlikely to occur in practice unless marginal stability is an inherent theoretical feature of the system.

==Stochastic dynamics==

Marginal stability is also an important concept in the context of stochastic dynamics. For example, some processes may follow a random walk, given in discrete time as 

:formula_6

where formula_7 is an i.i.d. error term. This equation has a unit root (a value of 1 for the eigenvalue of its characteristic equation), and hence exhibits marginal stability, so special time series techniques must be used in empirically modeling a system containing such an equation.

Marginally stable Markov processes are those that possess null recurrent classes.

<doc id="1273631" wikidata="Q2447797" url="?curid=1273631" title="Cape Breton fiddling">
<text>Cape Breton fiddling is a regional violin style which falls within the Celtic music idiom. The more predominant style in Cape Breton Island&#x27;s fiddle music was brought to North America by Scottish immigrants during the Highland Clearances. These Scottish immigrants were primarily from Gaelic-speaking regions in the Scottish Highlands and the Outer Hebrides. Although fiddling has changed since this time in Scotland, it is widely held that the tradition of Scottish fiddle music has been better preserved in Cape Breton. While there is a similar tradition from the Irish-style fiddling, that style is overlooked as a result of the Scottish presence in the area.

In the span of the 1920s to the 70s, Cape Breton&#x27;s fiddling style faced decline. 

Dance styles associated with the music are Cape Breton step dancing, Cape Breton square dancing (Iona style and Inverness style), and highland dancing.

In 2005, as a tribute to the area&#x27;s traditional music, the construction of a tourism center and the world&#x27;s largest fiddle and bow was completed on the waterfront in Sydney, Nova Scotia.

==Playing style==
Cape Breton- Scottish playing is accented, characterized by driven up-bowing. The tunes of other music origins (Irish, Canadian, French-Canadian, &quot;etc&quot;.) sound different when performed by Cape Breton- Scottish players. The downbeat pulse is driven by the fiddler&#x27;s heel into the floor. The pattern tends to be heel-and-toe on reels, the heel on strathspeys.

Cape Breton fiddle music is influenced by the intonations of the Scots-Gaelic language, especially Puirt a Beul (mouth music) and strathspeys. The ornaments are adapted from those used on the Great Highland bagpipe. The ornamentation (cuts aka. trebles, drones and doubling) brings out the feeling of Cape Breton fiddle.

A century ago the violin and pump organ were the common instruments; the latter has been supplanted by piano to provide a rhythmic accompaniment. Guitar is also used for accompaniment instead of piano or in addition to it.

==Repertoire==
The types of tunes commonly associated with Cape Breton - Scottish fiddling are jigs, reels, marches, strathspeys, clogs (hornpipes), and slow airs. Many of the tunes associated with this style fiddle music are also commonly performed on other instruments, especially bagpipes, piano and guitar. It is not unheard of for the music to be performed on harmonica, tin whistle, mandolin or banjo.

Modern Cape Breton players draw on a large body of music, from the Scottish and Irish traditions, and from modern compositions. Several older books of tune collections have been popular sources:

*Fraser, Simon (1874), &quot;Simon Fraser Collection&quot;
*MacDonald, Keith Norman (1887), &quot;The Skye Collection&quot;
*MacQuarrie, Gordan F. (1940), &quot;The Cape Breton Collection&quot;
*O&#x27;Neill, Francis (1903), &quot;O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s Music Of Ireland&quot;
*Robertson, James Stewart (1884), &quot;The Athole Collection&quot;
*Skinner, James Scott, &quot;The Scottish Violinist&quot;
*Skinner, James Scott, &quot;The Harp and Claymore&quot;

A number of recent publications also document a substantial amount of the modern Cape Breton - Scottish repertoire:

*Cameron, John Donald (2000), &quot;The Heather Hill Collection&quot; (compositions of Dan R. MacDonald)

<text>Aloys II (Aloys Maria Josef Johann Baptista Joachim Philipp Nerius; 25/26 May 1796 – 12 November 1858) was the sovereign Prince of Liechtenstein from 20 April 1836 until his death in 1858.

<doc id="1273643" wikidata="Q314909" url="?curid=1273643" title="Royce da 5'9&quot;">
<text>Ryan Daniel Montgomery (born July 5, 1977), known professionally as Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; (or simply Royce 5&#x27;9&quot;), is an American rapper. Best known for his association with fellow Detroit rapper Eminem, they became acquainted in 1997 and formed the hip hop duo Bad Meets Evil the following year. Their 2011 single, &quot;Lighters&quot; (featuring Bruno Mars) peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and preceded the release of their debut extended play (EP), &quot;&quot; (2011). The song and its parent EP, which debuted atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, have yielded Montgomery&#x27;s furthest commercial success.

Montgomery first embarked on a solo career with his debut studio album, &quot;Rock City&quot; in 2002; originally slated for release the year prior, disputes with Columbia Records led it to an independent release. He released eight follow-up studio albums to critical acclaim; his latest, &quot;The Allegory&quot; (2020), earned Montgomery his first Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Album in 2021. He also formed the hip hop supergroup Slaughterhouse with Joe Budden, Joell Ortiz and Kxng Crooked in 2008. Active for a decade, the group released two studio albums—&quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; (2008) and &quot;Welcome to: Our House&quot; (2012)—to commercial success. In 2014, he formed the hip hop duo PRhyme in 2014, with producer DJ Premier; they have released two albums.

==Early life==
In an interview with DJ Vlad, Royce stated that his first stage name was &quot;R-Dog&quot;, which was short-lived. He moved to Oak Park, Michigan when he was ten years old, later acquiring the nickname &quot;Royce&quot; in high school after wearing a chain with an &quot;R&quot; pendant resembling the Rolls-Royce symbol. Royce&#x27;s name comes from his height, , but the numbers five and nine have been in his life numerous times as he &quot;found his calling&quot; as a rapper in 1995 and in his song &quot;Tabernacle&quot; he discusses his grandmother dying on the fifth floor of a hospital and his first son being born on the ninth.
He started rapping at age 18, influenced mainly by Ras Kass, Redman, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Esham, Heltah Skeltah, LL Cool J, Nas, Jay-Z, Detroit&#x27;s Most Wanted, and N.W.A.

==Career==
===1997–2001: Early years and &quot;Rock City&quot;===
Through his manager Kino Childrey, Royce was introduced to fellow Detroit rapper Eminem on December 29, 1997. The two formed a duo, Bad Meets Evil, and released several tracks together. On August 20, 1998, they appeared on The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show for the first time. Royce appeared on Eminem&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; (1999), in which he was featured on a song called &quot;Bad Meets Evil&quot;. They later collaborated on the track &quot;Renegade&quot;, from which Royce&#x27;s vocals would later be replaced with Jay-Z&#x27;s on the latter&#x27;s &quot;The Blueprint&quot;. Through Eminem, Royce was introduced to both Dr. Dre and execs at Game Recordings, but they parted ways after Royce refused Dre&#x27;s request that he cut ties with Childrey.

Royce signed his first recording contract in 1998, a $1-million deal with Tommy Boy Records. He had rejected an offer beforehand from Dr. Dre&#x27;s Aftermath Entertainment of $250,000 and unlimited beats, a move that he called his &quot;biggest regret&quot; in a 2016 interview with &quot;Complex&quot;. After Tommy Boy Records shut down, he signed a deal with Columbia and Game Recordings where he started recording an album called &quot;Rock City&quot;, referring to Detroit&#x27;s former status as home to Motown Records. When the project was heavily bootlegged, Royce was dropped from Columbia in early 2002; he later signed to Koch, where he re-recorded some of the album, eventually releasing it on November 29 as &quot;Rock City (Version 2.0)&quot;. Despite poor album sales, the DJ Premier-produced single &quot;Boom&quot; gained Royce some underground recognition and eventually resulted in the two working together more closely.
===2002–2003: Feud with D12===
In 2002, Royce had a falling out with D12 including mutual friend and group member Proof, which sparked a public rivalry that resulted in Royce releasing a total of three diss tracks. The first, &quot;Shit on You&quot;, was recorded over the instrumental of D12&#x27;s track of the same name and mainly attacked group member Bizarre. Following Royce&#x27;s second track, &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, D12 responded with &quot;Smack Down&quot;, over the instrumental of 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Back Down&quot;. Proof himself released the tracks &quot;Many Men&quot;, over the instrumental of 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Many Men (Wish Death)&quot;; and &quot;Beef Is Ova&quot;, with rap group The Purple Gang. Royce responded with his third track, &quot;Death Day&quot;, recorded over 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;In Da Club&quot;.

Proof confronted Royce outside a Detroit nightclub in 2003, which led to a fight between both rappers&#x27; entourages. Proof and Royce were arrested and jailed overnight in adjacent cells, where they talked out their differences and ended the feud. Their rivalry officially ended in 2008 when he was featured on D12&#x27;s mixtapes &quot;Return of the Dozen&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Night Mixtape&quot;.

===2004–2005: &quot;Death Is Certain&quot; and &quot;Independent&#x27;s Day&quot;===
Royce signed with Game Recordings, for whom he had recorded several tracks for the soundtrack of the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, released in 2001. The in-game radio station, Game Radio FM, prominently featured Royce&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m the King&quot; and The Alchemist-produced solo track, which (along with the publicized beef) helped elevate Royce&#x27;s name beyond his association with Eminem. In 2001, Royce was featured on pop singer Willa Ford&#x27;s song &quot;I Wanna Be Bad&quot;. In 2004, he released his second and most critically successful album to date, &quot;Death Is Certain&quot;, charting with another Premier-produced single, &quot;Hip Hop&quot;.

After the relative success of his second effort, Royce put out a third solo project, &quot;Independent&#x27;s Day&quot;, in 2005. This was met with less acclaim than either of his previous releases. During this time, the rivalry between Royce and former friend Proof reached a boiling point in the streets of Detroit, on an occasion where the two rappers drew guns; they were subsequently arrested and left to work out their differences while spending the night in neighboring cells in jail. The time spent in jail led to the artists ending their feud and subsequently embarking on two overseas tours together. Though Royce had planned other projects involving Nottz and his former crew, D-Elite, these were cut short after a sentencing to one year in jail for a DUI.

===2007–2008: release from jail and &quot;The Bar Exam&quot;===
After his release in 2007, Royce with DJ Premier and Statik Selektah released the mixtape &quot;The Bar Exam&quot;. He also announced an album with Premier; in an interview with &quot;Elemental Magazine&quot;, Royce stated that, contrary to rumors, Premier would not be producing the entirety of his upcoming album, but will be overseeing the project as executive producer, handpicking all of the beats. Following &quot;The Bar Exam&quot;, Royce wrote the single for Diddy&#x27;s album &quot;Press Play&quot;, &quot;Tell Me&quot;. Following this, the producer expressed interest in signing the lyricist to Bad Boy. Nas has also stated that he would like to sign Royce to his Def Jam imprint, The Jones Experience. Neither of these deals, however, materialized.

In early 2008, Royce confirmed that he had officially resolved misunderstandings between himself and Eminem. He released &quot;The Bar Exam 2&quot; with DJ Green Lantern later in the year, as well as a retail version of the mixtape &quot;The Album&quot;; the projects featured production from Green Lantern, 9th Wonder, DJ Premier and July 6, among others. Later worked on his Premier-assisted retail release, &quot;Street Hop&quot;, the lead single of which was &quot;Shake This&quot;, also produced by DJ Premier. The video to the song circulated the internet, and the project was released October 20, 2009.

===2011–2012: Slaughterhouse and Bad Meets Evil reunion===
Joe Budden collaborated with Crooked I, Joell Ortiz, Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; and Nino Bless on a track titled &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; on his digital release, &quot;Halfway House&quot;. Based on the reception of the track, they decided to form a supergroup, minus Nino Bless, and named it after the first song they made together. They released numerous songs throughout early 2009, building a buzz for their self-titled album, which was released through E1 on August 11, 2009. The album features production from DJ Khalil, Mr. Porter and The Alchemist, plus guest appearances from Pharoahe Monch, K. Young and The New Royales. The group signed with Shady Records on January 12, 2011. On August 28, 2012, Slaughterhouse released their second studio album, Welcome to: Our House. As of November 23, 2012, it has sold 146,000 copies in the United States. In June 2013, the group began recording their second album with Shady Records. Super producer Just Blaze has been tapped to be Executive Producer of the project. The album was set to be released in 2016 but has since been delayed.

After Royce reconciled with Eminem, the duo started working again on new music and released the album &quot;&quot; on June 14, 2011, with Eminem&#x27;s label Shady Records. Two singles from the EP were released: &quot;Fast Lane&quot; and &quot;Lighters&quot; featuring Bruno Mars. This is considered Royce&#x27;s biggest breakthrough into mainstream hip-hop as both singles received regular radio play. The album would be certified Gold by the RIAA. Bad Meets Evil would reunite again for the albums &quot;Shady XV&quot; and &quot;Southpaw&quot;, the soundtrack to the film of the same name.

On August 9, 2011, Royce released his fifth album, &quot;Success Is Certain&quot;. The album title plays on the title of his second release, &quot;Death Is Certain&quot;.

===2014–2016: PRhyme and &quot;Layers&quot;===
In 2014, Royce and DJ Premier announced that they would release a collaborative album as the duo PRhyme. In September 2014, Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; and DJ Premier spoke about the album, saying: &quot;I want people to appreciate the fact that we didn&#x27;t compromise in lieu of the environment. In order to try to change the way that people digest music, we had to take a leap of faith,&quot; says Royce. DJ Premier adds, &quot;The bar has to be high. For this album to be another body of work and another chapter for both of our lives.&quot; Enlisting the music composing skills of Adrian Younge, DJ Premier went out of his comfort zone and sampled only Younge&#x27;s music for the album&#x27;s production. On November 24, 2015, PRhyme released the single &quot;Highs &amp; Lows&quot; ft MF DOOM and Phonte of Little Brother to promote their upcoming PRhyme Deluxe Edition release. On December 11, the deluxe edition was released which included the original PRhyme Album with four bonus songs featuring The Roots, Black Thought, Joey Bada$$ and Logic featured on an extended version of the song &quot;Mode&quot;.
In May 2017, Royce confirmed on his Instagram account that he and DJ Premier are working on the sequel to their debut album, &quot;PRhyme 2&quot;. He released a set of videos with one in particular featuring DJ Premier scratching on the turntables and making an instrumental. &quot;PRhyme 2&quot; was released on March 16, 2018.

Months after the release of the deluxe version of &quot;PRhyme&quot;, Royce announced his sixth studio album Layers, which was released on April 15, 2016. He released the single &quot;Tabernacle&quot; to positive reception from fans and critics, and then released &quot;Dead President Heads&quot;. On March 29, the free pre-album Trust The Shooter EP on the mixtape website Datpiff was released to positive critical consensus.

In July 2015, Royce collaborated with Lazarus and was featured on the single &quot;Underdog&quot; which was released under Russell Simmons&#x27; All Def Digital channel. The music video of the single was released in February 2016.

===2016–2018: &quot;Book of Ryan&quot;===
On March 31, 2016, Royce announced that a new album titled &quot;Book of Ryan&quot; was near completion. The album was originally planned to be his second album of 2016, but after multiple delays, the album was officially released on May 4, 2018. That same year, Royce confirmed via social media that his supergroup, Slaughterhouse, had disbanded following the departure of Joe Budden. Later that year, he was featured on the Eminem single &quot;Not Alike&quot; from his 2018 album &quot;Kamikaze&quot;.

===2020–2021: &quot;The Allegory&quot;===
On February 21, 2020, Royce da 5&#x27;9&quot; released his eighth studio album, &quot;The Allegory&quot;, which included features from T.I, Westside Gunn, Conway the Machine, Ashley Sorrell, and KXNG Crooked (formerly Crooked I). This album contained four singles; the first, &quot;Black Savage&quot;, was released on November 15, 2019. This generated a buzz around Royce&#x27;s production and was featured on Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Inspire Change&quot; campaign. Later, on January 17, 2020, Royce released the second single from the album &quot;Overcomer&quot; featuring Westside Gunn. On 31 January 2020, Royce released the third single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Age&quot;, which he said was &quot;the first song he made using a self-produced beat&quot;. The album peaked at No. 58 on the Billboard 200.

In February 2021, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, losing to Nas&#x27; &quot;King&#x27;s Disease&quot;.

===2022-present: Other releases===
In 2022, Royce released a greatest hits album titled &quot;The Heaven Experience, Vol. 1&quot;.

==Personal life==
In high school, Montgomery was generally a good student, though he said in a 2014 interview that he &quot;did have a bit of attention issues&quot;. Royce has two sons, James and Trenton, and three daughters. He is a recovering alcoholic, being sober since September 11, 2012. One of the main reasons for his choice of sobriety was his son saying, &quot;I love my dad. I think he&#x27;s Superman, but I don&#x27;t really know him&quot;. Montgomery married his high school sweetheart, who also attended Oak Park High School, and they had begun dating in 1995.

Montgomery has a younger brother, Marcus, who goes by the name of Kid Vishis. Vishis released his debut album, &quot;Timing Is Everything&quot;, on July 22, 2014.

<text>James Almond (September 1874 – 1923) was an English footballer who played as a left-half. He played one match in the Football League for Burnley before transferring to Swindon Town in 1897.

Almond started his career with Nelson in the Lancashire League, before joining Football League First Division side Burnley in November 1896. He made one appearance for the club, deputising for the absent William Longair in the 1–1 draw with Sheffield United at Turf Moor on 16 January 1897. After failing to break into the first team, Almond joined Southern League club Swindon Town later the same month. He made his debut for Swindon in the 1–1 draw with Gravesend United on 30 January, and went on to play seven more matches during the remainder of the season. Almond established himself as Swindon&#x27;s first-choice left-half in the 1897–98 campaign, missing only one Southern League match. He scored his first goal for the club in the 3–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur on 5 February 1898, and netted his second of the season in the 1–2 home defeat to Chatham on 26 March. He left Swindon in the summer of 1898 and subsequently retired from football.
