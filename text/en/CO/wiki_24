<text>Up in Smoke (also referred to as Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Up in Smoke) is a 1978 American buddy stoner comedy film directed by Lou Adler and starring Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong, Tom Skerritt, Edie Adams, Strother Martin, and Stacy Keach. It is Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s first feature-length film.

Cheech &amp; Chong had been a counterculture comedy team for about ten years before they started reworking some of their material for their first film. Most of the film was shot in Los Angeles, California, including scenes set in Tijuana, while scenes set on the Mexican border were actually filmed at the border in Yuma, Arizona.

While negatively received upon its release, &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; grossed over $104 million, is credited with establishing the stoner film genre, and is now considered a cult classic. In 2024, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Anthony &quot;Man&quot; Stoner, an unemployed, marijuana-smoking drummer, is told to either get a job by sundown or be sent off to military school by his parents. Man leaves the house and later becomes stranded on the highway. Man is picked up while hitchhiking by the equally enthusiastic stoner Pedro de Pacas, and the two share a large joint, which is revealed to contain Labrador feces after the dog ate Man&#x27;s supply. When Pedro freaks out and seems to have trouble breathing, Man accidentally gives him an extremely powerful dose of LSD. The police find their car parked on a traffic median with them in it, discover that they are high and arrest them. At trial, the pair are released on a technicality after Man discovers that the judge is drinking vodka.

In an attempt to procure more marijuana, they visit Pedro&#x27;s cousin Strawberry, a Vietnam War veteran. During the party, a lady snorts a couple of lines of Ajax set up by Man, under the presumption it was cocaine, despite Man trying to warn her. They narrowly escape a police raid on Strawberry&#x27;s house while Strawberry has a flashback and thinks the police are the Viet Cong, but are soon deported to Tijuana, by the INS, along with Pedro&#x27;s relatives, who actually called the INS on themselves, so they could get a free ride to a wedding in Tijuana.

In order to get back to the United States, they arrange to pick up a vehicle from Pedro&#x27;s uncle&#x27;s upholstery shop, but arrive at the wrong address: a marijuana processing plant disguised as an upholstery shop. They end up unknowingly involved in a plot to smuggle a van constructed completely out of &quot;fiberweed&quot; (hardened THC resin derived from marijuana - a play on the word fiberglass) from Mexico to Los Angeles, with an inept police narcotics unit led by the insane and anti-drug Sergeant Stedenko hot on their trail. At the Mexican–American border, they almost get arrested, but attention is diverted to a group of nuns (into whose car Man had thrown his joint unintentionally to avoid getting arrested). The duo then cross the border into America as Stedenko finds out from his unit that they have apprehended the wrong group. Stedenko realizes that Pedro and Man’s van is their target, and begin a pursuit; however, one of Stedenko&#x27;s men shoots out one of their own tires due to incompetence, abruptly ending the chase.

Pedro and Man pick up two hitchhiking women who convince them to perform at a Battle of the Bands contest at the Roxy Theatre. After narrowly avoiding arrest by a motorcycle cop who had gotten high off fumes from the “fiberweed” van, they arrive at the venue to find that most of the bands performing are being negatively received by the audience, which causes Man to freak out. One of the women gives Man what she believes is an &quot;upper&quot;, but mistakenly gives him the wrong drugs and leaves Man feeling weak. The duo&#x27;s band, Alice Bowie, win over the audience, including the cops, who get stoned due to a large amount of marijuana smoke from the burning van being funneled into the venue. The pair win the contest and a recording contract. Outside, a defeated Stedenko is upset at the fact that he and his unit are stoned, and gives in to the munchies.

The film concludes with Pedro and Man driving in the former&#x27;s car and dreaming how their future career will pay off. Man then lights a small portion of hash and gives some to Pedro. However, it falls into his lap, causing him to panic and swerve the car while trying to put it out; Man attempts to put the hash out with his beer. During the scuffle, the car swerves down the road and smoke billows out the windows.

==Cast==
== Production ==

The screenplay was written under the title &quot;The Adventures of Pedro &amp; Man&quot;. Paramount Pictures provided the budget of $1 million but refused to provide the additional $800,000 needed to complete the film after studio president Michael Eisner saw a rough cut, so Lou Adler used his own money to complete it.

== Release ==

As this was the comedy team&#x27;s first film, Paramount wanted the initial screenings to be filled with their most ardent fans. Cheech and Chong also came up with the novel (and ultimately successful) idea of advertising the film through comic strips, which they left on bus benches.

The film had test screenings in August 1978 and opened in nine theatres in Texas in early September, grossing $344,785 in its first 10 days. The film went on to become a huge success. Prior to its official release date, the film had grossed $1.7 million, and by the end of the first month of release it had grossed $20 million and went on to gross $76 million at the domestic box office and over $104 million worldwide.

The film had midnight screenings at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17 and 18, 1979.

The film was banned in South Africa during apartheid. Censors in the country said that the film &quot;might encourage the impressionable youth of South Africa to take up marijuana smoking&quot;. It was also banned in Colombia.

=== Home media ===

On April 10, 2018, a 40th Anniversary Edition set was released, which featured the movie on Blu-ray and DVD, and the album on vinyl record and compact disc, as well as a 7-inch picture disc vinyl record single featuring the songs &quot;Earache My Eye&quot; and &quot;Lost Due To Incompetence (Theme From A Big Green Van)&quot;, with an image of Cheech from the film on the A-side and the &quot;YESCA&quot; license plate image on the B-side.

The 40th Anniversary Edition CD featured two bonus tracks, a previously unreleased version of the song &quot;Up In Smoke&quot; with an additional Spanish verse by Cheech, and a newly recorded &quot;2018 version&quot; of the same song.

The set also featured oversized &quot;Up In Smoke&quot; branded rolling papers, an 11×17 film poster and a booklet with new essays by both Marin and Chong, along with rare and unseen photos.

== Soundtrack album ==


The soundtrack album was released in 1978. Allmusic gave the album a score of 3 out of 5 stars. In 2017, &quot;Billboard&quot; named &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; as one of the 10 best stoner film soundtracks.

== Reception ==
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 47% based on reviews from 19 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;Oft-quoted but undeniably flawed, &quot;Up In Smoke&quot; is a seminal piece of stoner cinema thanks to the likability of its two counterculture icons.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 57% based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a genially slapdash, sometimes winning live-action cartoon&quot; with &quot;several genuinely funny moments.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;gets off to a great start&quot; but &quot;once the more obvious drug jokes are exhausted, Adler lets the film degenerate into a mixture of fitful slapstick and toilet humor.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film half of one star out of four, calling it &quot;one of the most juvenile, poorly written, awkwardly directed pictures I have ever seen. And my guess is that even if you saw it in a pleasantly altered state whether from grass, a banana daiquiri, Frango mint milkshake, or a Weight Watchers&#x27; Veal Parmigiana frozen dinner, &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; would still be a real downer, man.&quot; He later put it on his year-end unranked list of the worst films of 1978. Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Cheech &amp; Chong were &quot;a likable, funky duo, but the script they&#x27;ve come up with for their film debut is severely underwritten.&quot; He also found it &quot;hard to watch the effects of gulping Quaaludes and the like being treated as something hilarious—especially when one realizes that the kids for whom the film was so clearly intended are probably going to love it.&quot;

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; compared the film favorably to &quot;The Groove Tube&quot;, writing that &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; was &quot;also crudely done but is more consistently funny.&quot; She added that &quot;Cheech and Chong are so gracefully dumb-assed that if you&#x27;re in a relaxed mood you can&#x27;t help laughing at them.&quot; Art Harris of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote that the film &quot;may give you a buzz, but don&#x27;t count on it to keep you high. Like, you know, the film suffers from a bad case of burn-out, leading one to nod off between jokes and wonder why producer Lou Adler bothered to attempt a Doper&#x27;s Delight in this post-Woodstock age of Clean Living.&quot; David McGillivray of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; observed that the film &quot;looks, unfortunately, as if it were more fun to make than it is to watch.&quot;

== Unproduced follow-ups ==

In December 1978, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published an article stating that Cheech and Chong had &quot;seven scripts waiting in the drawer&quot; which included one for an animated film, and one for a sequel to &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;. No sequel was ever produced, and &quot;Cheech and Chong&#x27;s Next Movie&quot;, released in 1980, did not feature the characters of Pedro and Man, although the characters they played had personalities and character traits that were virtually identical to those of Pedro and Man.

== Legacy ==

The Grammy Award Museum in Los Angeles features an &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; exhibit which displays the master tape for the soundtrack album, the annotated original script, limited-edition 40th anniversary &quot;smoking devices,&quot; and part of Marin&#x27;s collection of &quot;Blazing Chicano Guitars.&quot;

The officially licensed graphic novel &quot;Cheech &amp; Chong&#x27;s Chronicles: A Brief History of Weed&quot; was released by Z2 Comics in 2021. Written by Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong, and Eliot Rahal, the graphic novel acts as a sequel to the &quot;Up in Smoke&quot; film, as it features Pedro de Pacas and Anthony &quot;Man&quot; Stoner as the main characters of the story.

<text>Ek Aur Ek Gyarah () is a 2003 Indian action comedy film by David Dhawan. This movie stars comedic veterans Govinda and Sanjay Dutt.

==Synopsis==
Tara (Govinda) and Sitara (Sanjay Dutt) are brothers who are notorious, lovable, small-town con-men who are always in trouble with the law. One day, when the police are chasing them, they mistakenly shoot one of the most deadly criminals, who goes by the name Cobra (Ashish Vidyarthi). They look for cover and find themselves at Major Ram Singh&#x27;s house (Jackie Shroff), who got Cobra&#x27;s brother Panther (Gulshan Grover) arrested because he and Cobra tried to steal a very advanced gun. Tara and Sitara go to Singh&#x27;s house, but since he is an army officer, he initially doesn&#x27;t allow them but later does.

Living in his house for a while, Tara and Singh&#x27;s sister Pinky (Nandini Singh) fall in love; Sitara and Singh&#x27;s sister&#x27;s friend Preeti(Amrita Arora) fall in love, too. One day, while in the house, they watch TV and learn that Cobra has returned. They realise that Cobra has kidnapped their mother (Himani Shivpuri), so he can force Tara and Sitara to get Panther out of Ram Singh&#x27;s jail. They succeed in getting Panther out of jail. Cobra returns to their mother.

Ram Singh realises that he has been fooled by the two; they watch him on TV being embarrassed by the media. Sitara and Tara realise they should get revenge on Cobra and Panther. They go to Singh&#x27;s house and tell him how they were forced by Cobra to deceive him. Singh forgives them. The brothers leave to catch the two criminals. They succeed, and all ends well.

<doc id="1274426" wikidata="Q285423" url="?curid=1274426" title="Sebastiano del Piombo">
<text>Sebastiano del Piombo (; – 21 June 1547) was an Italian painter of the High Renaissance and early Mannerist periods, famous as the only major artist of the period to combine the colouring of the Venetian school in which he was trained with the monumental forms of the Roman school. He belongs both to the painting school of his native city, Venice, where he made significant contributions before he left for Rome in 1511, and that of Rome, where he stayed for the rest of his life, and whose style he thoroughly adopted.

Born Sebastiano Luciani, after coming to Rome he became known as &quot;Sebastiano Veneziano&quot; or &quot;Viniziano&quot; (&quot;Sebastian the Venetian&quot;), until in 1531 he became the Keeper of the Seal to the Papacy, and so got the nickname &quot;del Piombo&quot; (&quot;of the Lead&quot;) thereafter, from his new job title of &quot;piombatore&quot;. Friends like Michelangelo and Ariosto called him &quot;Fra Bastiano&quot; (&quot;Brother Bastian&quot;).

Never a very disciplined or productive painter, his artistic productivity fell still further after becoming &quot;piombatore&quot;, which committed him to attend on the pope most days, to travel with him and to take holy orders as a friar, despite having a wife and two children. He now painted mostly portraits, and relatively few works of his survive compared to his great contemporaries in Rome. This limited his involvement with the Mannerist style of his later years.

Having achieved success as a lutenist in Venice when young, he turned to painting and trained with Giovanni Bellini and Giorgione. When he first went to Rome, he worked alongside Raphael and then became one of the few painters to get on well with Michelangelo, who tried to promote his career by encouraging him to compete for commissions against Raphael. He painted portraits and religious subjects in oils, and, once he was established, avoided the large fresco schemes that took up so much of the time of Raphael and Michelangelo. His earlier career in both Venice and Rome was somewhat overshadowed by the presence of clearly greater painters in the same city, but after the death of Raphael in 1520, he became Rome&#x27;s leading painter. His influence on other artists was limited by his lack of prominent pupils and relatively little dissemination of his works in print copies.

==Venice==

Sebastiano del Piombo was probably born in Venice, though there is no certainty as to his background. His birthdate is extrapolated from Vasari&#x27;s statement that he was 62 at his death in 1547. That he was first known as a musician and singer may suggest an upper-middle-class background; the extent to which his playing on the lute and other instruments was professional is unclear. Like his contemporary Raphael, his career was marked by his ability to get on well with both other artists and patrons. He began to train as a painter at a relatively late age, probably 18 or 20, so around 1503–05, becoming a pupil of Giovanni Bellini and probably afterwards of Giorgione, both of whose influence is apparent in his works; Vasari&#x27;s mention of their relationship is rather vague: &quot;si acconciò con Giorgione&quot;.

No signed or firmly documented works survive from his period painting in Venice, and many attributions are disputed. As with other artists, some of Sebastiano&#x27;s works have long been confused with Giorgione&#x27;s. Like Titian, he may have completed work left unfinished at Giorgione&#x27;s death in 1510; Marcantonio Michiel says he finished &quot;The Three Philosophers&quot;. The earliest significant work attributed to him is a portrait of a girl in Budapest, of about 1505.
He is now usually assigned the unfinished and reworked &quot;Judgement of Solomon&quot; now at Kingston Lacy. This dramatic and imposing picture, &quot;one of the masterpieces of Venetian narrative painting&quot;, was also long attributed to Giorgione; it may have been abandoned about 1508, though the estimated dates vary in the period 1505–1510. After extensive restoration in the 1980s, removing later overpainting, the painting is now left with traces of the three different compositions visible; still more can be seen with infra-red reflectography. Still over 2 × 3 metres, it seems originally to have been even larger, with some 40 cm lost along the left edge. There are two versions of the elaborate architectural background, which was a recurrent interest of Sebastiano&#x27;s Venetian period. The last setting is in a basilica, which may reflect a &quot;more learned&quot; picture intended for a building holding courts of justice. The figure at the front of the executioner, left without clothes or the baby, is clearly drawn from classical sculpture.

Four standing figures of saints in niches on the organ-shutters of San Bartolomeo, Venice, now in the Gallerie dell&#x27;Accademia in Venice, date from –09, and are &quot;very Giorgionesque&quot;, especially the pair on the insides. They were painted at the same time as Giorgione&#x27;s frescos for the Fondaco dei Tedeschi (now lost) just by the church, which was the German&#x27;s church in Venice, and at this time also held Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of the Rose-Garlands&quot; of 1506. The outside pair of shutters also show what Sebastiano had learnt from Bellini. Their technique has developed &quot;from the earlier smooth surface to the application of paint in heavy brushstrokes&quot;, and the figure of Saint Sebastian shows awareness of classical sculpture.

The main altarpiece for San Giovanni Crisostomo, Venice of 1510–11 shows the patron saint, Saint John Chrysostom reading aloud at a desk, a Mary Magdalene looking out at the viewer, and two other female and three male saints. The organ-shutters for the church were also painted. The style shows developments &quot;towards a new fullness of form and breadth of movement&quot; that may have been influenced by the Florentine painter Fra Bartolommeo, who was in Venice in 1508. Aspects of the composition were also innovative, and later copied by Venetian painters, including even Titian.

==Rome==
===1511–1520===
In 1511 the Papal banker Agostino Chigi was the richest man in Rome, and a generous patron of the arts. Early in the year he was sent to Venice by Pope Julius II to buy Venetian support for the papacy in the War of the League of Cambrai. When he returned to Rome after a stay of some six months, he brought Sebastiano with him; Sebastiano was to remain based in Rome for the rest of his life. Sebastiano began by painting mythological subjects in lunettes in the &quot;Sala di Galatea&quot; in Chigi&#x27;s Villa Farnesina, under a ceiling just done by Baldassarre Peruzzi. In these he already shows an adaption to Roman style, especially that of Michelangelo, whose Sistine Chapel ceiling had just been completed. Probably the next year, he added a large &quot;Polyphemus&quot;. It is possible that Raphael&#x27;s famous &quot;Galatea&quot; of 1514, which is in the next bay and now dominates the room, replaced a fresco by Sebastiano. A larger cycle on the lower walls was apparently intended, but abandoned, for reasons that are not clear.
Sebastiano had also been producing easel paintings from soon after his arrival, showing the development of his new style. A &quot;Death of Adonis&quot; in the Uffizi dates to about 1512–13, and shows that he &quot;had achieved a working dialectic of Roman and Venetian classical styles&quot;, in which he &quot;enlarged the proportion of his figures into an almost bulking massiveness, ponderous and sensuously splendid: idealizations, but of sensuous existence&quot;.

By about 1515, Sebastiano had befriended and allied himself with Michelangelo, who recruited him &quot;as a kind of deputy for him in painting&quot;, he having returned to his backlog of promised projects in sculpture. Michelangelo&#x27;s intention was for Sebastiano to &quot;contest Raphael&#x27;s first place&quot; in painting in Rome, using at least in part ideas and designs supplied by Michelangelo, whose rivalry with Raphael had become intense. The intention may have been for a closer relationship than actually resulted, as in 1516 Michelangelo returned to Florence, only returning occasionally to Rome for several years after.

The first result of this collaboration was one of Sebastiano&#x27;s most important paintings, a &quot;Pietà&quot; in Viterbo. Here the composition is highly unusual for this common subject (which Michelangelo had famously sculpted in 1498–99), with Christ lying across the bottom of the picture space, at the feet of a Virgin looking up to Heaven, so that the two figures do not actually touch. Though no drawing survives, this was Michelangelo&#x27;s conception, where &quot;an idea of high tragic power is expressed with extreme simplicity in a structure of severe geometric rigour&quot;. The back of the panels have large sketches in charcoal that seem to be by both artists. In 1516 he painted a similar subject, the &quot;Lamentation of Jesus&quot; (now Hermitage Museum) using his own composition, and showing his awareness of Raphael&#x27;s handling of groups of figures.
These led a Florentine friend of Michelangelo, Pierfrancesco Borgherini, to commission Sebastiano to decorate a chapel in San Pietro in Montorio in Rome; he no doubt hoped to get significant input from Michelangelo. There is a Michelangelo drawing of 1516 for the &quot;Flagellation of Jesus&quot; in the British Museum, and other sketches; the final design survives only in a copy by Giulio Clovio after another Michelangelo drawing (Royal Collection). In the event there were a series of interruptions and Sebastiano did not complete the chapel until early 1524. The &quot;Flagellation&quot; is painted in oil on plaster. This was a method first practiced by Domenico Veneziano, and afterwards by other artists; but according to Vasari only Sebastiano succeeded in preventing the colours eventually blackening.

The last major work of the period was the &quot;Raising of Lazarus&quot;, now in the National Gallery, London, which was commissioned in 1516 by Cardinal Giulio de Medici, archbishop of Narbonne in southern France, and the future Pope Clement VII, in blatant competition, engineered by Michelangelo, with a painting of the same size by Raphael, the &quot;Transfiguration&quot;. Both were supposed to hang in Narbonne Cathedral. Michelangelo supplied at least drawings for the figure of Lazarus and the two men supporting him (British Museum), but probably did not do any work on the painting itself, if only because he was only briefly in Rome during the time it was painted. When the two paintings were hung together in the Vatican, just after Raphael&#x27;s death in 1520, both were praised, but the Raphael generally preferred, as has remained the case ever since.

In the early 1520s Sebastiano completed the Borgherini Chapel with a &quot;Transfiguration&quot; in the semi-dome above his &quot;Flagellation&quot;. The combination shows the influence of the &quot;Apocalipsis Nova&quot;, a contemporary text that prophesied the coming of an &quot;Angelic Pastor&quot; who would bring a new age of peace. Michelangelo was among many reformist Catholics interested in the text. The &quot;Flagellation&quot; represents &quot;the current, corrupted state of Christianity and the Transfiguration the glorious future to come&quot;.

===1520–1531===
The death of Raphael in 1520, immediately before the exhibition of the two rival paintings intended for Narbonne, left Sebastiano clearly the leading painter operating in Rome. As his letters show, he immediately attempted to secure for himself the &quot;Sala dei Pontefici&quot;, Raphael&#x27;s next Vatican project, but was frustrated by Raphael&#x27;s workshop, armed with the master&#x27;s drawings, and his own inability to enlist Michelangelo&#x27;s help, as the pope had told him to work exclusively on the long-promised Tomb of Pope Julius II. In the following years Sebastiano mostly avoided very large commissions for churches, and concentrated on portraits, where he had a considerable reputation, and religious easel paintings, such as his &quot;Visitation&quot; for France (1518–19, now Louvre), and his &quot;Madonna of the Veil&quot; (c. 1525), a very successful adaptation of Raphael&#x27;s &quot;Madonna di Loreto&quot;. To both of these types he brought his refined monumental classicism.

His career in the decade was greatly impacted by outside events. In 1522 there was plague in Rome, and he may have left Rome for a long period; there is little evidence of his activity for over a year. In 1523 Giulio de Medici became Pope Clement VII, and thereafter Sebastiano seems to have been a part of Vatican court life. He painted a number of portraits of the pope, and other paintings for him. In 1527 he seems to have remained with the pope all through the horrors of the Sack of Rome and his nervous retreat to Orvieto, though he seems to have spent time in Venice in 1528 and perhaps 1529, his first known return there since 1511. This catastrophe brought to an end the High Renaissance epoch in Rome, scattering Raphael&#x27;s workshop and the emerging Roman Mannerists, and largely destroying the confidence of patrons.

In 1531 the death of the previous holder allowed Sebastiano to press Pope Clement for the lucrative office of the &quot;piombatore&quot;, which he obtained after promising to pay a fixed sum of 300 scudi annually to the other main contender, Giovanni da Udine, who was also a painter, from Raphael&#x27;s workshop. To hold the position he had to take vows as a friar, despite having a wife and two children. After this his paintings, which are more often signed than dated, carry signatures such as &quot;F(rater) Sebastianus Ven(etus)&quot;.

===1532–1547===
Sebastiano&#x27;s artistic output reduced after taking the court role, though possibly not by as much as Vasari suggests. Large projects, even of a single painting, could take many years to complete, as with a &quot;Pieta&quot; for Spain. This was the last piece where Michelangelo helped him with a drawing. Vasari, probably much influenced by Michelangelo, places great emphasis on Sebastiano&#x27;s turning away from art for a comfortable life as a well-paid courtier from this point, but may overstate the reality.
His friendship with Michelangelo came to an end in 1534, after a disagreement over the latter&#x27;s &quot;Last Judgment&quot; in the Sistine Chapel. Sebastiano encouraged the pope to insist that this picture should be executed in oil on plaster, the technique he had developed and used. The enormous wall was prepared with the smooth plaster needed for this, with Michelangelo apparently acquiescent. There may even have been the idea floated that Sebastiano might do the painting to Michelangelo&#x27;s designs. Michelangelo may also have tried painting in oils on the smooth surface. It is clear that several months after the idea of using oils first appeared, Michelangelo finally and furiously rejected it, and insisted that the whole wall be re-plastered in the rough &quot;arriccio&quot; needed as a base for fresco. It was on this occasion that he famously said that oil painting was &quot;an art for women and for leisurely and idle people like Fra Sebastiano&quot;.

Two late projects for churches were never finished by Sebastiano. A large altarpiece of the &quot;Birth of the Virgin&quot;, still in Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome, was begun in the late 1530s but had to be finished after his death by Francesco Salviati. Before his death in 1541, the executor of Agostino Chigi&#x27;s estate commissioned a large &quot;Visitation&quot; as a memorial, in Santa Maria della Pace, Rome. It was still half-finished at Sebastiano&#x27;s death in 1547, and was eventually removed in the 17th century. Fragments with some of the over life-size main figures are at Alnwick Castle, in a style of impressive simplicity, the end point of a &quot;tendency to over-generalize appearances and pictorial structures so that they verged on an effect of geometrical abstraction&quot; that had been increasing apparent in his work since his early years in Rome.

Vasari records that he died after a short illness on 14 June 1547, at the age of 62. His will directed that he be buried very simply in Santa Maria del Popolo, with the savings from not having an elaborate burial given to the poor. After efforts by Daniele da Volterra his remains were moved in 1561 to the predecessor of the Rome Accademia di San Luca.

==Technique==

Sebastiano was trained in the Venetian tradition of rich, subtly varying, colours in oil painting. In the &quot;Raising of Lazarus&quot; (1517–1519) he used a very wide range of pigments, often in complicated mixtures, and the painting can be seen as a display of Venetian skill for the Roman critics, attempting to achieve &quot;the greatest and most subtly varied range of colours ever seen in a single painting&quot;. He became less interested in colour as his career progressed, and many later works are rather sombre, with touches of bright colour.

His early works generally use the Venetian technique of freehand underdrawing on the surface to be painted, no doubt following a relatively approximate sketch, as was his technique for the Kingston Lacy &quot;Judgement of Solomon&quot;. But after some years in Rome he began to use full-size cartoons for frescos, which were pricked along the lines and then soot &quot;pounced&quot; through, to give dotted lines on the surface for the artist to follow. This technique, normal in Florence and Rome, was used in the fresco &quot;Transfiguration&quot; of the Borgherini Chapel, for which some pricked sheets survive. However, this was his last work in fresco.

From early on he was innovative and ready to experiment in compositional details as well as technique, with a special interest in painting in oils on new surfaces, whether plaster, stone, alabaster or slate. Though tending to be dark, several of his works with these unorthodox backings have survived well. Though he often covered the whole surface, leaving no indication of the support, some of his paintings on mineral sheets leave the background unpainted. This is the case with a small head of Clement VII in Naples, wearing the beard he always had as a penance after the Sack of Rome.

He made excellent drawings, nearly all as compositional sketches. He continued to prefer to draw on light blue paper in black chalk with white highlights, a Venetian habit. Few if any early ones survive, and he may have changed his methods to use more precise sketches under the influence of Michelangelo and Raphael. Few survive for his portraits. A British Museum &quot;curator&#x27;s comment&quot; on one of their late drawings notes: &quot;As so often with Sebastiano&#x27;s drawings, the first impression is one of unrhythmic dryness; but the suggestion of atmosphere, the sensitively drawn contemplative faces and the subtle use of reflected lights and tonal transitions leave no doubt that [this] is from his own hand.

==Pupils==
Sebastiano seems to have followed Michelangelo in painting with &quot;no more than merely mechanical assistance&quot; from a studio, and had no significant pupils formed in his style. Whether this was a cause or result of his avoidance of large compositions and his court office from the 1530s we cannot know.
==Personal life and relationship with Michelangelo==

The main sources for his personality and habits are Vasari and surviving letters, mostly to and from Michelangelo. Vasari knew Sebastiano, but probably not very well; although he had been compiling material for some time, the first edition of his &quot;Lives&quot; did not appear until 1550, after Sebastiano&#x27;s death, and it is not clear if he had specifically discussed the biography with Sebastiano. He knew Michelangelo rather better, and his description of Sebastiano is probably heavily influenced by the hostile attitude Michelangelo had towards Sebastiano after 1534. Vasari takes up much of his &quot;Life&quot; bemoaning Sebastiano&#x27;s supposed indolence and neglect of his artistic talent for a comfortable and convivial life, at least after 1531.

Vasari says that in later life he lived in a fine house near the Piazza del Popolo, keeping a very good table, and often entertaining regular friends as well as visitors. He says he was always cheerful and humorous, and very good company. He became red-faced and rather fat, as the bearded portrait in the &quot;Lives&quot; suggests.

As described above, he had become close to Michelangelo by about 1515. Though they eventually fell out, few people were able to remain on good terms with Michelangelo for a period of nearly twenty years. In 1519 Michelangelo became godfather to Sebastiano&#x27;s first son, Luciano, after which Sebastiano addressed his letters to &quot;My dearest &quot;compare&quot;&quot; (&quot;godfather&quot;). The relationship suffered a dip in 1520 when Sebastiano asked Michelangelo to write to Cardinal Bibbiena, a close friend of Pope Leo X, recommending Sebastiano for projects in the Vatican after Raphael&#x27;s death. Michelangelo sent the letter a month or so later, which Sebastiano presented to the cardinal, without reading it. The letter was in very flippant terms, and Sebastiano complained that it became &quot;practically the only topic of conversation at the Palace, and it makes everyone laugh&quot;. Nor did it work in getting Vatican commissions.

In 1521 he acted as Michelangelo&#x27;s agent in the installation of the &quot;Risen Christ&quot; or &quot;Cristo della Minerva&quot; in Rome, which was botched by the assistant Michelangelo had sent. From 1525 there is a draft for an emotional letter by Michelangelo passing on praise for Sebastiano by one &quot;Captain Cuio&quot;, who he had dined with. In 1531 Sebastiano writes a despondent letter describing how &quot;I still don&#x27;t feel I am the same Bastiano that I was before the Sack; I still don&#x27;t feel in my right mind.&quot; The relationship never recovered from the argument over the &quot;Last Judgement&quot; in 1534, described above.

<doc id="1274433" wikidata="Q1374090" url="?curid=1274433" title="Area 88">
<text>is a Japanese manga series by Kaoru Shintani serialized between 1979 and 1986. The story is about a young pilot named Shin Kazama and his experiences at Area 88, a mercenary air force base secluded in the desert in the fictional nation of Aslan. Shin goes from head of his class at a world-renowned aviation school, dating the beautiful daughter of an airline president, to a mercenary fighter pilot bound to Area 88 by a three-year contract that he was duped into signing by a jealous and competitive childhood friend. He is determined to earn $1.5 million to buy his way out of the obligation and return home, and killing becomes second nature to him as he quickly rises to the top rank at Area 88. Overwrought with shame and self-loathing for what he has become, Shin begins to question whether he is still fighting for survival, or, like his fellow mercenaries, for the sheer excitement and camaraderie of battle.

&quot;Area 88&quot; was among the first three manga to be translated into English and published in North America. It had been adapted into an OVA in 1985, a video game in 1989 (released in North America as &quot;U.N. Squadron&quot;), and a 12-episode anime television series in 2004. It is also a brand of model aircraft in Japan. While it appeals to aviation fans for its realistic depictions of aircraft and aerial combat, it has also been critically acclaimed for its strong character development and Shintani&#x27;s poignant storytelling, combining action, tragedy, romance, and comedy. In 1984, the manga received the Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen.

==Story==

===Synopsis===
&quot;Area 88&quot; takes place in the fictional Middle Eastern kingdom of Aslan (alternatively transcribed as &quot;Asran&quot;). The government uses mercenary fighter pilots, stationed at the desert airbase Area 88, to fight its war and pays them for each enemy aircraft shot down. Each pilot&#x27;s contract lasts three years; early cancellation costs $1.5 million. Deserting Area 88 is considered a capital offense punished by death.

The story follows ace pilot Shin Kazama as he attempts to serve out his contract to return to his fiancée in Japan. As the war progresses, Shin must face his shifting acceptance of the violence that fills his days. Among his compatriots at Area 88 are: Mickey Simon, a United States Navy veteran of the Vietnam War; McCoy, a greedy weapons dealer who sells the pilots everything they need; photojournalist Goh &quot;Rocky&quot; Mutsugi (Makoto Shinjou in the TV series); Danish pilot Greg Gates; and Lt. Colonel Saki Vashtar, a member of Aslan&#x27;s royal family and the commander of Area 88.

Shin&#x27;s past is told through flashbacks during the story. He and his best friend, Satoru Kanzaki, were up-and-coming airline pilots for Yamato Airlines, and Shin had started a relationship with the CEO&#x27;s daughter, Ryoko Tsugumo. Jealous of Shin&#x27;s success, Satoru tricked him into signing the contract that landed him in Area 88. While Shin fights in the bloody war, Satoru courts Ryoko and rises through the ranks of Yamato Airlines. Ryoko discovers Shin is still alive through one of Goh&#x27;s/Makoto&#x27;s photos and resolves to find him.

===Endings===
While each version of &quot;Area 88&quot; shared the same basic premise and some story arcs, they each had key differences, most notably in the endings.

The original manga ending showed Shin returning to Japan, but having lost all memory of Area 88. The English-language version published by Eclipse Comics was left unfinished.
In the three-episode OVA adaptation from 1985, Shin was discharged from service to escort the king of Aslan to Paris in exile. Despite being free and making contact with Ryoko, Shin flies back to Aslan, having changed in his time at Area 88. His ultimate fate is left uncertain.
The 2004 TV series truncated the story to just after Shin lost his F-5E. In this version, Makoto, the photojournalist, was originally sent to Area 88 by Satoru to capture a photo of Shin dying to prove his death to Ryoko. Shin survives the events of the series and Makoto, swayed to help Shin, returns to Japan and derails Satoru&#x27;s plot to marry Ryoko.

===Manga===
The original Japanese manga of &quot;Area 88&quot; was serialized in 23 volumes between 1979 and 1986 by Shogakukan. Each volume was black and white with a painted color cover and contained several short stories called &quot;missions&quot;. In all, there were 172 such missions across the 23 volumes. &quot;Shōnen Sunday&quot; later repackaged the 23 volumes into ten thick books under its Wide Volume product line.

&quot;Area 88&quot;, along with &quot;Mai, the Psychic Girl&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Kamui&quot;, was one of the first three manga to be translated to English and published in North America by Eclipse Comics and VIZ Media in May 1987. It was published bi-weekly with each issue containing a single mission, of which the editors had planned to release all 172. The first 28 issues featured covers from the original manga plus some original artwork by Shintani, but as these resources were limited, the covers of issues #29–36 featured stills from the OVA film. With issue #37 in December 1988, VIZ Media took over the series, and in addition to featuring photographs of actual fighter jets on the cover, the publication went from bi-weekly to monthly and the price from $1.50 to $1.75. The series did not adjust well to the dramatic change, and with issue #42 in May 1989, without resolving the storyline, it was canceled. It was later run as a feature in Viz&#x27;s &quot;Animerica&quot; magazine (Vol. 1, No. 8 – Vol. 3, No. 2), but only lasted until January 1995 without the series being completed.

===OVA films===
Between February 5, 1985, and August 15, 1986, Studio Pierrot produced a direct-to-video animated film trilogy for VHS and laserdisc. In 1992, Central Park Media&#x27;s U.S. Manga Corps released the OVA series, subtitled in English, in North America for VHS and laserdisc, and re-released the first volume for DVD on 14 July 2000.

After Central Park Media&#x27;s films license lapsed, ADV Films published a two episode theatrical edit of the OVA trilogy for DVD on 25 July 2006. Although having one less episode, the episodes themselves are longer. They have been reedited so that act II is divided and added onto the first and the last episode respectively. As such, nothing is actually missing from the ADV collection, despite having a smaller episode count. The 2006 ADV collection is a two-DVD set, and features the original Japanese soundtrack as well as the dubbed English track, performed by the same cast who voiced the English dub of the TV series. The DVD content also includes an interview with Kaoru Shintani, and an introduction to the fighter jets portrayed in the series.

Discotek Media re-released the OVA series on October 30, 2018.

===Anime television===
An updated 12-episode anime television series with CG graphics, produced by TV Asahi, Animax, Group TAC and Media Factory, began production in 2003 and premiered across Japan on TV Asahi and the anime satellite television network, Animax from 8 January 2004 to 5 March 2004, which later aired the series across its other respective networks worldwide, including Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, South Asia, South Korea, Taiwan, and other regions. The series featured the work of several prominent contemporary trance music artists during combat scenes, such as Rank 1, DJ Tiësto, and Svenson &amp; Gielen; official materials called these scenes the &quot;highlight of the work&quot;. ADV Films licensed the series for North American distribution, releasing the series across the region, with the first DVD volume release being published on June 22, 2005 and the last volume being released on January 17, 2006. The DVD release notably removed the licensed trance music, replacing it with a handful of original compositions by Miyake Kazunori reused across the series. For the release of the English dub to English-speaking countries, the ADR team at ADV Films sought the assistance of Capt. Kevin &quot;Dumpster&quot; Divers, a USAF officer, to ensure that dialogue had proper Air Force jargon.

===Video games===
A shoot &#x27;em up video game by Capcom was released in the arcades in 1989. It was released in the West as &quot;UN Squadron&quot;. Ports were released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Super NES and ZX Spectrum.

In the game, the player could choose either Shin, Mickey, or Greg as the pilot to play. Each came with a different plane and various advantages; for example, Mickey could handle air-to-air dogfights well while Greg excelled at air-to-ground attacks. Each pilot also had special abilities; Shin mastered normal weaponry at the highest speed, Mickey inflicted extra damage with his armaments, and Greg recovered from attacks almost before they occurred. The Super NES release offered six fighter planes, with the F-8 Crusader as the default aircraft. The game also included various elements from the series, such as the land carrier.

In 1995, Family Soft produced two &quot;Area 88&quot; games for the PC-9801.

An October 2014 crossover event took place in &quot;Ace Combat Infinity&quot; where aircraft and emblems used by the main characters of &quot;Area 88&quot; were added to the game. These included Shin&#x27;s F-5 and F-20, Mickey&#x27;s F-14, Greg&#x27;s A-10, and Kim&#x27;s AV-8.

===Board game===
Two special board games based on the franchise were released in the 1980s, but as so-called &quot;Coterie&quot; games, which are preordered editions and only go on limited sale at Japan&#x27;s Game Market trade show. With mechanics based on the GDW board game &quot;Imperium&quot;, the &quot;Area 88 in Desert War&quot; and &quot;Peace in the Aslan Kingdom&quot; have the game counters, instructions and battle map (a fictional representation of the Sinai Peninsula) printed in standard bond paper, with players left to cut up the counters and attach them and the map in cardstock.

===Toys/model kits===
A line of Area 88 model kits was also produced, which are basically aircraft that are painted as they appeared in the series. Takara released a 1/100 line of aircraft kits, each with a 1/24 pilot figure in the early 1980s to coincide with the original manga stories. Kits included Shin&#x27;s Crusader, F-5G Tiger II and F-20 Tigershark, Mickey&#x27;s F-100 and F-14, Saki&#x27;s Kfir, Greg&#x27;s A-10, and two planes from the Counter-Governmental Air Force—a Yak-36 Forger and a MiG-27 Flogger-D.

The first release of 1/144 kits by Hasegawa in the early 1990s consisted of Mickey&#x27;s F-14, Shin&#x27;s F-8 and F-5, Seilane Balnock&#x27;s Harrier, and Saki Vashtar&#x27;s Kfir. Each kit had a 1/12 scale figure of the pilot in resin while the 1/144 plane kits were styrene plastic tooled up by Dragon models in Hong Kong. The third wave, released by Hasegawa in 1996, featured 1/72 kits of the same jets, but this time Hasegawa&#x27;s own kit moldings were used. They comprised Saki&#x27;s Kfir, Gregg&#x27;s A-10, Shin&#x27;s F-8, F-20, X-29 and Draken, and Mickey&#x27;s F-14. Hasegawa also produced a 1/48 two-pack set in line with the 2004 TV series, consisting of Shin&#x27;s F-8 and Mickey&#x27;s F-14, plus a DVD.

From January 2004 to December 2005, trading figure company The Other Corp released a line of 1/144 gashapon miniatures of various modern military aircraft that are painted as according to their actual appearance in the series, despite one of the offerings—the Su-47 Berkut—never having appeared at all.

==Reception==
Martin A. Stever reviewed &quot;Area 88&quot; movies for &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 83. Stever commented that &quot;The art is impressive, especially the ability to render moving jet aircraft. True to real war, characters are killed with regularity but not without remorse.&quot;

Anime News Network praised &quot;Area 88&quot;″s English dub released by ADV, especially with most of it done with the assistance of a consultant from the US Air Force. Freetype gave the series a 7.0 out of 10, citing &quot;Intense, fast, adrenaline-pumping dogfight action&quot;, while criticizing it for being one-dimensional for lack of some character development, lack of emphasis on action with the morals and drama watered down.

<text>The Kenneth C. Griffin Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) is the largest of the twelve graduate schools of Harvard University, when measured by the number of degree-seeking students. Formed in 1872, GSAS is responsible for most of Harvard&#x27;s graduate degree programs in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The school offers Master of Arts (AM), Master of Science (SM), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in approximately 58 disciplines.

Academic programs offered by the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences have consistently ranked at the top of graduate programs in the United States. The School&#x27;s graduates include a diverse set of prominent public figures and academics. The vast majority of Harvard&#x27;s Nobel Prize-winning alumni earned a degree at GSAS. In addition to scholars and scientists, GSAS graduates have become U.S. Cabinet secretaries, Supreme Court justices, foreign heads of state, and heads of government.

==History and organization==
GSAS was formally created as the Graduate Department of Harvard University in 1872 and was renamed the Graduate School of Harvard University in 1890. Women were not allowed to enroll in GSAS until 1962. In 2023, the GSAS was renamed after a $300 million donation from philanthropist Kenneth C. Griffin to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences forms part of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS), along with Harvard College, the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and the Harvard Division of Continuing Education. The dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, who reports to the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, is charged with the responsibility of implementing and supervising the policies of the faculty in the area of graduate education. In the administration of academic policy, the dean is guided by the Administrative Board and the Committee on Graduate Education. The dean is assisted by an administrative dean of GSAS, who has day-to-day responsibility for the operations of the school, a dean for admissions and financial aid, and a dean for student affairs. While the GSAS office oversees the processing of applications, financial aid and fellowships, thesis guidelines, and graduate student affairs, the individual departments in FAS retain considerable autonomy in the administration of their respective graduate programs.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences oversees GSAS and is responsible for setting the conditions of admission, for providing courses of instruction for students, for directing their studies and examining them in their fields of study, for establishing and maintaining the requirements for its degrees and for making recommendations for those degrees to Harvard&#x27;s Governing Boards, for laying down regulations for the governance of the school, and for supervising all its affairs. The dean of GSAS is responsible for implementing and supervising the policies of the faculty in the area of graduate education.

In addition to its own master&#x27;s and PhD programs, GSAS nominally oversees the PhD programs in Harvard&#x27;s professional schools: Harvard Business School, Harvard Divinity School, the Harvard Graduate School of Education, Harvard Medical School, the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and the John F. Kennedy School of Government.

==Student life==

As of 2019, Harvard&#x27;s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences had 4,521 students, with the vast majority (4,392 students) pursuing PhDs. 46% of GSAS students are women, 30% of students are international, and 12% are underrepresented minorities. 20% of GSAS students pursue degrees in humanities, 26% in social sciences, and the remaining 54% in natural sciences.

GSAS students have a dedicated space on Harvard Yard, known as The Student Center at Harvard Griffin GSAS at Lehman Hall. Graduate students who prefer to dine on-campus do so at the Student Center, which features a full-scale dining hall as well as a smaller cafe. The building also provides study and leisure spaces.

===Financial aid===
GSAS guarantees full funding for all PhD students for five years, which covers tuition, health fees, and living expenses. The PhD funding packages include a combination of tuition grants, stipends, traineeships, teaching fellowships, research assistantships, and other academic appointments. Although master&#x27;s students are not guaranteed full funding, they often receive financial support covering at least half of tuition and fees.

==Housing==

As of 2017, Harvard&#x27;s GSAS guarantees housing for all first-year graduate students, as long as the students apply for accommodations by April 22. GSAS offers housing through several on-campus residence halls, as well as Harvard-owned apartments, both on and off-campus. In addition, approximately 100 GSAS students live in Harvard&#x27;s undergraduate houses and freshman dorms as resident tutors and proctors. GSAS residence halls include the following:

===Conant Hall===
Constructed in 1894, Conant Hall was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge, reflecting the Georgian architecture of freshman residences found around Harvard Yard. It was built with funds gifted by Edwin Conant, whose name the building currently bears. Originally consisting of 29 suites, Conant has since undergone numerous renovations and currently houses 84 single rooms.

===Perkins Hall===
Perkins Hall was built in 1893 according to the design of Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge. Consisting of 154 single rooms, Perkins is the oldest of the GSAS residence halls currently in use at Harvard. The funds for its construction were donated by Catharine Page Perkins, the widow of an oil tycoon, in memory of her husband&#x27;s family. Perkins was originally intended to house undergraduate students from modest circumstances but as the number of graduate students increased, it was converted into a graduate residence. In the early 1900s, Perkins Hall was at the center of controversy involving &quot;homosexual activity&quot; at Harvard, and the university administration&#x27;s attempts to suppress it, an affair that later became known as the Secret Court of 1920.

===Richards Hall and Child Hall===
Designed by the German modernist architect Walter Gropius, Richards and Child Halls were built in 1949. Richards is named after the Nobel Prize-winning chemist Theodore Richards, while Child Hall takes its name from Francis J. Child. The two residence halls are constructed on the former Jarvis Field, where the first American football game was played in 1874. Child Hall houses approximately 100 students and Richards Hall houses over 70. The lawn space includes Richard Lippold&#x27;s “World Tree” sculpture, a 27-feet-tall steel construction designed to be climbed by students.

<doc id="1274455" wikidata="Q5422634" url="?curid=1274455" title="Eye Water">
<text>Eye Water is a river in the Scottish Borders, it flows in a general southeasterly direction from its source in the Lammermuir Hills to its estuary at Eyemouth on the east coast of Scotland, having a length of approximately .

==River course==
The Eye Water rises on the eastern slopes of Wester Dod at height of 375 metres, it flows SE for 10 km before swinging NE for three km to reach the village of Grantshouse. The Eye Water flows on the southern outskirts of Grantshouse as it again turns SE and runs in a valley between Horseley Hill and Dalks Law alongside the A1 road and the East Coast Main Line railway. The river keeps to the SW side of the A1 passing through the villages of Reston and Ayton where it flows through a pleasant wooded valley on the Ayton Castle estate. The estate was planted with parkland trees when the present Scottish baronial style castle was built in 1851 and many of these remain around the river banks although part of the park has since been planted with mixed woodland.

The stretch of the river from Ayton onward previously had some pollution problems as a quantity of sewage effluent from the village of Ayton and Eymouth contaminated the Water. However, in 2005 Scottish Water completed work which collected the sewage from the villages and pumped it directly to the sewage treatment works at Eyemouth on the coast. At Ayton the Eye Water swings NNE for the final five km leg to its estuary. It runs under the A1 road in a wooded gorge and then receives its largest tributary on its northern bank, the Ale Water which rises on Coldingham Moor 10 km to the NW. The Eye Water enters Eyemouth where it flows on the east side of the harbour, with a stone built quay keeping it separate and forming the river&#x27;s west bank before the Water eventually enters the harbour lower down near the life boat station.

==1948 flood==
On 12 August 1948 the Berwickshire region was hit by a calamitous flood when one third of the annual rainfall fell in just six days. The water flowed off the Lammermuir Hills causing the Eye Water and other rivers of the area to overflow and cause much damage. The low lying farm land around Ayton was turned into a large lake with the high embankment of the ECML railway acting as a dam. There were fears that the embankment would break and Eyemouth would be inundated. The embankment did hold but Eyemouth still received some damage, with reports saying that gales and the impact of the overflowing Eye Water had the “impact of a hurricane”. The flood caused the closure of the local Eyemouth Railway from 13 August 1948 to 29 June of the next year. Between Reston and Granthouse 7 railway bridges were washed away. Those on the ECML were replaced by military bridges, allowing goods trains to resume on 25 October and passenger on 1 November 1948. The temporary bridges weren&#x27;t finally replaced until 21 May 1950.

<doc id="1274469" wikidata="Q7670276" url="?curid=1274469" title="THOMAS">
<text>THOMAS was the first online database of United States Congress legislative information. A project of the Library of Congress, it was launched in January 1995 at the inception of the 104th Congress and retired on July 5, 2016; it has been superseded by Congress.gov.

==Contents==
The resource was a comprehensive, Internet-accessible source of information on the activities of Congress, including:

*bills and resolutions
**texts
**summaries and status
**voting results, including how individual members voted
*Congressional Record, including the daily digest
*presidential nominations
*treaties

The database was named after Thomas Jefferson, who was the third President of the United States. &quot;THOMAS&quot; was an acronym for &quot;The House [of Representatives] Open Multimedia Access System&quot;.

The website allowed users to share legislative information via several social networking sites, and there were proposals for an application programming interface.

==Library of Congress Legislative Data Challenge==
The Library of Congress created the Markup of US Legislation in Akoma Ntoso challenge in July 2013 to create representations of selected US bills using the most recent Akoma Ntoso standard within a couple months for a $5,000 prize, and the Legislative XML Data Mapping challenge in September 2013 to produce a data map for US bill XML and UK bill XML to the most recent Akoma Ntoso schema within a couple months for a $10,000 prize. 
*In December 2013, the Library of Congress announced &quot;Jim Mangiafico as the winner of our first legislative data challenge, Markup of US Legislation in Akoma Ntoso and the $5,000 prize&quot;. 
*In February 2014, Jim Mangiafico and Garrett Schure as the winners of the Library of Congress &quot;Second Legislative Data Challenge&quot;.

<text>King&#x27;s Highway 420, commonly referred to as Highway 420, is a 400-series highway in the Canadian province of Ontario that connects the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) with downtown Niagara Falls. It continues east as a limited-access expressway named Niagara Regional Road 420 to connect with the Rainbow Bridge international crossing between Canada and the United States over the Niagara River; this was part of Highway 420 until 1998. West of the QEW, the freeway ends at an at-grade intersection with Montrose Road (Niagara Regional Road 98). The highway has a speed limit of , making it the only 400-series highway to have a speed limit less than for its entirety.

Originally constructed as a divided four-lane road with two roundabouts, the route of Highway 420 formed part of the QEW in 1940 initially as the southeastern terminus, but after the QEW extension from Niagara Falls to Fort Erie opened in 1941, this bypassed highway became a spur route designated as the Rainbow Bridge Approach. It was assigned a unique route number as part of the 400-series after being upgraded into a freeway in 1972, including construction of a large interchange with the QEW. In 1998, the section of Highway 420 east of Stanley Avenue was transferred to the responsibility of the Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Regional Road 420.

== Route description ==

At , Highway 420 is the shortest 400-series highway, travelling through Niagara Falls from Montrose Road to Stanley Avenue, on the outskirts of the city&#x27;s tourist district. East of Stanley Avenue (Regional Road 102) the highway becomes Niagara Regional Road 420 and is known as Falls Avenue and Newman Hill on approach to the Rainbow Bridge. This portion was designated a part of Highway 420 until 2000, when it was transferred to the City of Niagara Falls and the Regional Municipality of Niagara, although the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) still assists with the maintenance of it under a Connecting Link agreement.
East of Drummond Road,
Highway 420 features stylized light fixtures with the letters &quot;ER&quot;, which stand for &quot;Elizabeth Regina&quot; and are a tribute to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

Highway 420 begins in the west at a signalized intersection with Montrose Road (Regional Road 98), beyond which it continues as Watson Street through the residential neighbourhood of Greens Corners to Beaverdams Road (Regional Road 53).
East of Montrose Road, the highway is a four lane roadway divided by a raised paved median, and passes north of a forest as it approaches a four-level interchange with the QEW. The five parclo ramps provide almost all directional movements, though the QEW off-ramps meet Highway 420 at at-grade intersections. These at-grade connections can be bypassed by a pair of connectors carried by a dual on-and-off ramp flyover that arcs over the CN rail line and the QEW Toronto-bound carriageway, directing Fort Erie-bound QEW traffic onto Highway 420 eastbound and westbound Highway 420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW. Another set of ramps links Toronto-bound QEW traffic to Highway 420 eastbound and Highway 420 westbound to the Fort Erie-bound QEW.
East of the QEW, Highway encounters an interchange with Dorchester Road as both cross the Queenston-Chippawa Power Canal.
This interchange was originally a traffic circle that was removed in the early 1970s.
The numerous lanes from the QEW interchange to the west begin to converge between residential subdivisions east of Dorchester Road, gradually narrowing to four through lanes at the Drummond Road interchange. After passing beneath Portage Road, the route widens on approach to an at-grade intersection with Stanley Avenue. This intersection is the eastern end of both the freeway segment of the route and the signed King&#x27;s Highway 420; east of Stanley Avenue the route is signed as Niagara Regional Road 420 and known as Falls Avenue.

Now separated by a landscaped median, the route progresses eastward, intersecting MacDonald Avenue and providing access to several residential and retail properties that adjoin the road. The route travels within a concrete trench and abruptly curves to the southeast as it passes beneath Victoria Avenue, with which there is a simple interchange. East of this point, the road was named Newman Hill until March 2012. Palmer Avenue and Ontario Avenue pass over the route as it descends a hill towards the Niagara Gorge. At the bottom, the route curves to the southwest, where it provides access to the Rainbow Bridge border crossing into the United States as well as the tourist district of the city.

Owing to its association with the number 420 in cannabis culture, Highway 420 is also the location for the annual Cannabis Conference and Protest, usually taking place sometime around April 20. The event includes a march beginning near Niagara Falls and travelling to Highway 420.

== History ==

=== Rainbow Bridge Approach ===
The history of Highway 420 predates its designation by nearly 75 years, tied in with the crossing of the Niagara Gorge between the twin cities of Niagara Falls, Ontario and Niagara Falls, New York. The first level crossing between the two cities was the Honeymoon Bridge, constructed in 1898. The wide structure spanned between the Canadian and American sides, above the Niagara River. Its narrow design proved to be a fatal flaw, and on January 27, 1938, under the weight of a massive ice jam in the river, the structure collapsed.
A day later, the owners of the previous bridge—the International Railway Company (IRC)—as well as Ontario Minister of Highways Thomas Baker McQuesten announced intentions to construct a new span; a long political battle ensued for several years over the merits of private or public ownership of border crossings. In the end, the Niagara Falls Bridge Commission (NFBC) paid the IRC $615,000 to purchase the right-of-way of the old bridge as well as the rights to construct the new one.
The future Rainbow Bridge was dedicated by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth on June 7, 1939, just hours after the couple dedicated the QEW.

On May 16, 1940, Samuel Johnson, the vice-chair of the NFBC, and McQuesten, who along with his parliamentary role was chair of the commission, ceremonially turned the first sod for the new bridge using a two-handled shovel.
Construction had begun two weeks earlier on May 4.
The new bridge was assembled over the following 18 months; the design was prepared by New York engineering firm Waddell &amp; Hardesty and supervised by the Edward Lupfer Corporation, the latter the designers of the Peace Bridge.
The new structure was located downstream from the Honeymoon Bridge, as the gorge is slightly wider at that point, resulting in a span.

Meanwhile, McQuesten was overseeing construction of the QEW between Toronto and Fort Erie. The new dual highway, inspired by German Autobahns, was the first of its kind in Canada.
The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 temporarily halted McQuesten&#x27;s ambitions, as funding was quickly shifted to the war effort. As a result, construction on the new superhighway was put on hold south of Niagara Falls. McQuesten officially opened the QEW on August 23, 1940; the pavement ended south of Lundy&#x27;s Lane. Despite the war, work began on a link between the opened QEW and the Rainbow Bridge through the centre of Niagara Falls. This link would not be completed in time for the opening of the new bridge.

On November 1, 1941, the Rainbow Bridge was officially opened during a simple ceremony. The oldest living couple known to have wed in Niagara Falls, a pair from Pennsylvania, were the first to cross, followed by a newlywed couple from Georgia. This symbolically tied the history of the two bridges together, and was followed by McQuesten and Johnson walking towards the centre of the structure from the Canadian and American sides, respectively, and shaking hands at the centre. Several pyrotechnic explosions at both ends capped the ceremony, and the bridge was opened to traffic.
Work continued on the four lane bridge approach throughout 1941, and by mid-1942 it was possible to drive directly from the bridge onto the QEW. The new link featured a traffic circle at Dorchester Road as well as at the QEW. At the time the new link was designated temporarily as part of the QEW (decades before receiving its own unique route number of Highway 420), as a result it was referred to by several names including the Queen Elizabeth Way Extension (and known by locals for decades as the &quot;Queen E Extension&quot;)
and the Rainbow Bridge Approach.

At the same time construction on QEW between Niagara Falls and Fort Erie, was underway, but the ongoing war delayed its completion. As an interim measure, four gravel lanes of the highway was opened during the summer of 1941, then two lanes of pavement were laid in 1946, and the four-lane extension was fully paved and opened on October 14, 1956. Bypassed by the new QEW extension to Fort Erie in 1941, the Niagara Falls bridge approach became a spur route that was no longer part of the QEW so it was officially named the Rainbow Bridge Approach for the next three decades.

=== Upgrade to freeway ===
During the mid-1960s, the Department of Highways examined the possibility of extending the freeway portion of the route east towards the Rainbow Bridge. They began to purchase properties lining Roberts Street in 1966.
In 1971, construction began on a four-level interchange between the QEW and the Rainbow Bridge Approach. This removed the two traffic circles along the approach.
The interchange between the QEW and Lundy&#x27;s Lane (Highway 20) was also removed; instead, the Rainbow Bridge Approach ends with an at-grade intersection with Montrose Road which in turn connects to Lundy&#x27;s Lane.
By April 1972, the Rainbow Bridge Approach was designated as Highway 420.
In 1998, the Niagara Falls Transportation Study was released, recommending that Roberts Street be rebuilt as a gateway to the city as opposed to a freeway. Highway 420 east of Stanley Avenue was transferred to Niagara Region.
In the early 2000s, Highway 420 from the QEW interchange to Drummond Road was reconstructed with high-mast lighting poles and an Ontario tall-wall concrete median Jersey barrier, similar to the upgrades that other high-traffic provincial freeways received around that time. The rest of the route from Drummond Road eastwards (including Regional Road 420) was instead upgraded to and decorative &quot;ER&quot; lightposts, to commemorate the route&#x27;s historical status as the original routing of the QEW and its historical tie to the Queen Mother. The &quot;ER&quot; style lighting poles are themselves a historical decorative lighting pole model, discontinued decades earlier, that was revived originally for the early 2000s Highway 420 reconstruction and would also be later used for QEW&#x27;s bridges in Mississauga, Oakville, and St. Catherines. The Drummond Road and Portage Road overpasses that originally built in 1941 and rehabilitated in the early 1970s were demolished in 2004; their new replacement bridges plus Highway 420&#x27;s concrete median barrier feature decorative stone facades, which in combination with the &quot;ER&quot; light poles restores the heritage look that was lost in the 1970s reconstruction.

On September 23, 2010, Highway 420 was designated as the Niagara Veterans Memorial Highway.
On January 31, 2012, Niagara Regional Council approved the renaming of Roberts Street and Newman Hill as an extension of Falls Avenue, beginning March 1. Prior to this, Falls Avenue curved into Newman Hill at the Rainbow Bridge.

In 2016, the flyovers of the Highway 420-QEW interchange were rehabilitated.

<doc id="1274490" wikidata="Q5513901" url="?curid=1274490" title="General Motors U platform">
<text>The U-platform (or U-body) is a front wheel drive minivan and crossover SUV platform from General Motors produced since 1990. North American sales ended in 2009, but Chinese production continues. The minivans were divided into three generations, 1990–1996, 1997–2005 and 2005-current. The U-body was also used for General Motors&#x27; first generation crossovers from 2001-2005.

Keeping with its EPA designation as a light truck, the fifth character in the VIN for a U-body is &quot;U&quot;, instead of the fourth, as is standard for cars.

Confusingly, GM also used the &quot;U-body&quot; (or &quot;U-car&quot;) designation in the mid 1970s for its mid-sized European models - principally the Opel Ascona and Vauxhall Cavalier.

==Minivans==

===First generation===
Released in the fall of 1989 for the 1990 model year, the U platform (GMT199) utilized a galvanized steel space frame underneath composite plastic dent resistant panels similar to those used in Saturn models and the Pontiac Fiero. The vans feature unconventional styling, which some commenters likened it to a DustBuster vacuum cleaner.

All models used a 120-hp, 3.1L V6 mated to a 3-speed automatic transmission. In 1992, the 3800 Series I V6 became available with a four speed automatic. Both were replaced by the LA1 3400 V6 in 1996.

====1990–1996====
The vehicles in this generation included:
*Chevrolet Lumina APV (&quot;APV&quot; was dropped from the model name in 1994)
*Oldsmobile Silhouette
*Pontiac Trans Sport

In 1994, The Lumina and Trans Sport received a facelift, which shortened the nose and gave them a more conventional look. The Silhouette did not receive this update, however, and while it did receive a facelift in 1993, it was very minimalistic with only the front bumper being slightly changed. The rest of the front end remained unchanged.

====International====
The Pontiac Trans Sport was sold in Europe as a rebadged Oldsmobile Silhouette with European safety specifications.

European customers had grown accustomed to sleek minivans, thanks to vehicles such as the Renault Espace, and did not object to the Trans Sport&#x27;s futuristic styling. In 1994, when the Trans Sport was updated, the European version retained the original shape with a minor facelift, with the Oldsmobile Silhouette being sold as a badge-engineered Pontiac Trans Sport.

The European Trans Sport was also available with two options that were never offered on a North American specification U-body: A four-cylinder engine (the LD2 Quad 4) and a 5-speed manual transmission.

===Second generation===

In 1996 (for the 1997 model year), the second U-body (platform) minivans arrived, also known as the GMT200. The new minivans were of unibody steel construction and the styling was intentionally conventional to such an extent that contemporary reviewers remarked that without looking closely at the badging and grille treatments, these minivans could be mistaken for their primary competitors, the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, which at the time commanded a 50% share of the minivan market.
Production of this generation was performed at GM&#x27;s Doraville, Georgia facility, and later at GM Shanghai.

====1996–1999 (Europe)====
*Opel/Vauxhall Sintra

====1997–2005====
The vehicles in this generation included:
* Chevrolet Venture
* Oldsmobile Silhouette
* Pontiac Trans Sport
* Pontiac Montana (Montana was a trim level of the Trans Sport prior to 1999)

====2000–2005 (China)====
* Buick GL8

====International====
* The Opel Sintra (badged as the Vauxhall Sintra in the United Kingdom) was an export built in the US alongside other vans for the European market. The Sintra used Opel engines instead of the LA1 3400 V6 engine that the US vans used.
* The Buick GL8 is sold by Buick only in China, but was exported to the Philippines as a Chevrolet Venture.
* The Pontiac Trans Sport of this generation was also sold in Europe, badged as a Chevrolet Trans Sport.

===Third generation===

The U-body was updated once again in 2004 for the 2005 model year, also known as the GMT201. These vans were referred to as &quot;Crossover Sport Vans&quot; (CSV) by General Motors, in reference to their SUV-inspired styling. North American vans were built in GM&#x27;s plant in Doraville, Georgia. General Motors stopped minivan sales in the United States as of 2008. The Pontiac Montana and Chevrolet Uplander continued to be sold in Canada and Mexico for 2009. Production of the Buick GL8 continues in Shanghai, China.

====2005–2009====
The vehicles in this generation include:
* Buick GL8 (China only, produced until 2016)
* Buick Terraza (2005-2007)
* Chevrolet Uplander
* Pontiac Montana SV6 (2005-2006 in the US)
* Saturn Relay (2005-2007)

===Fourth generation===

In 2010, Shanghai GM introduced a new version (SGM258) of the Buick GL8 called GL8 Luxury Business Edition. The previous generation remains on sale as the Business Edition.

Prior to the car&#x27;s release, a concept car called the Buick Business was shown at the 2009 Shanghai Auto Show.

===Fifth generation===
In 2016, Shanghai GM introduced a new version (SGM358) of the Buick GL8 in 2 versions: ES and top of the line Avenir. The previous generation remains on sale as the Land Business Class. The exterior was completely redesigned but the platform was retained. However, the platform was updated with a new, more sophisticated independent rear suspension. The only engine is a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 cylinder engine. This generation of GL8 is produced in Shanghai rather than Shenyang where the older generations of GL8 have been produced since 2004.

== Crossover SUVs ==

In 2001 General Motors decided to produce its first entry into the Crossover SUV category using a shortened U-body platform.

Vehicles:
* 2001–2005 Pontiac Aztek (GMT250)
* 2002–2007 Buick Rendezvous (GMT257)

<text>Phillip James (P.J. or Bill) Plauger (; born January 13, 1944, Petersburg, West Virginia) is an author, entrepreneur and computer programmer. He has written and co-written articles and books about programming style, software tools, and the C programming language, as well as works of science fiction.

==Personal life and career==
Plauger worked at Bell Labs from 1969 to 1975, where he coauthored &quot;Elements of Programming Style&quot; and &quot;Software Tools&quot; with Brian Kernighan. In 1978, he founded Whitesmiths, the first company to sell a C compiler and Unix-like operating system (Idris). He has since been involved in C and C++ standardization and is now the president of Dinkumware. In January 2009 he became the convener of the ISO C++ standards committee, but in October 2009 he tendered his resignation after failing to pass a resolution to stop processing any new features in order to facilitate the promised shipping date for the C++0x standard.

Plauger has been credited with inventing pair programming while leading Whitesmiths Ltd.

Plauger has written a number of science fiction stories, notably &quot;Child of All Ages&quot;, first published in the March 1975 issue of &quot;Analog&quot;, which features a protagonist who has achieved immortality at the cost of never growing beyond childhood. The story was nominated for the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1976. Plauger won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 1975—notably beating John Varley for the award—and subsequently sold a story to &quot;The Last Dangerous Visions&quot;.

Plauger holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Princeton University and a PhD in nuclear physics from Michigan State University.

== Dinkumware ==
Dinkumware is an American software company specializing in core libraries for C/, owned and operated by P.J. Plauger. It is based in Concord, Massachusetts.

The company has provided the C++ Standard Library implementation that ships with Microsoft since 1996 and Embarcadero C++Builder since 2005, and supplies and libraries to the embedded community. It also provides libraries for Java and other tools, including &quot;proofers&quot; to test for library adherence to the standard.

<text>Wójcik, Wojczik, Wojczyk, Wojszyk (also variants of phonetic spelling: Woicik, Woycik, Woyczik, Woytik, etc.) is one of the oldest Polish surnames, and the fourth most common in Poland (100,064 in 2009).
Archaic feminine forms are derived by adding suffixes: &quot;-owa&quot; for married woman and &quot;-ówna&quot; for maiden name.

There are several suggested origins of the surname: diminutive from the occupation of wójt or from the given name Wojciech. It may also be a nickname by the bird &quot;wójcik&quot; (greenish warbler).

Feminine forms are Wójcik, Wójcikówna, Wójcikowa. Over the centuries, from many dialects arose multiple spellings for the Wójcik surname, including Woichik, Wojczyk, Woyzeck, Wojszyk, Wujcik, etc. 

==History==
Early record of the Wójcik surname may be found in the Chronicles of Little Poland (13th century). The knight Wójcik was a companion of King Wladyslaw of Poland and a member of his bodyguard. 
According to medieval Łęczyca Court Files (14th century), in 1395, Michno Wójcik of Wójciki pursued legal action against City of Łęczyca to take back part of his estate that was illegally annexed during his absence. 

Noble families named Wójcik bear different coats of arms:
*Wójcik of Bialynia
*Wójcik and Wojczyk of Pobog
*Wójcik and Wójcikowski of Korab
*Wójcik of German origin: Silver, an eagle black, crowned gold.
*de Wojcza, Wojczik and Wojszyk of Ogończyk
*Wójcik and Wójsik of Ostoja
*Wojszyk of Szeliga
*Wojszek and Wójszyk of Łodzia
*Wójcik of Lubicz
*Wójcik of Rola
*Wojsik and Wojszik of Łabędź
*Wojszek and Wojszik of Piława
*Wójsik and Wojszyk of Janina
*In the 17th century appeared the family Wójcikiewicz (derived from family Wójcik) of the Bialynia coat of arms
*Wójcikowski of the Nałęcz coat of arms. 

However, most families bearing the surnames Wójcik, Wójczyk, Wojszik, etc. (c. 90%) are derived from peasantry or burghers, as a result of popular adoptions of this surname between the 17th and 19th centuries. These families derived their surname from the named office of &quot;wójt&quot; or the first name Wojciech: son of Wojciech is also Wojcik.

<doc id="1274505" wikidata="Q7416012" url="?curid=1274505" title="Sandbagging (racing)">
<text>Sandbagging describes someone who underperforms (usually deliberately) in an event. The term has multiple uses, such as a driver who competes in an event in a series below their level of expertise to finish high. In bracket drag racing and short track motor racing when a racer has a dial-in time / qualifying speed much slower than the car can actually perform. The term can also be used to describe a fast driver who holds back during a race until just before the end, when they suddenly pass up through the field to win the event.

==Drag racing==
The function of sandbagging is to guarantee a win by outperforming the slower opponent at first, and then hitting the brakes near the finish line in time to just barely beat the opponent. However, sandbaggers run the risk of beating their dial-in time, thus disqualifying them from the race. Sandbaggers must be experienced in controlling this technique, and therefore, it should not be attempted by beginners. Sandbagging faces much criticism, as many argue that it is essentially cheating. Television shows such as Pinks and bracket racing rules discourage sandbagging by creating automatic disqualification for breakouts. However, if both cars run faster than their dial-in time, the car that runs faster by the least amount is the winner.

===Example===
Racer A has a car that consistently runs a quarter-mile drag race in 12 seconds. Racer A gives a dial-in time of 15 seconds, therefore claiming that the car is 3 seconds slower than it actually is. Racer A goes against Racer B in an E.T. bracket race. In bracket races, both racers are supposedly equal since both have similar times. However, Racer B has an accurate dial-in time of 15 seconds while Racer A has an inaccurate dial-in time that gives Racer A the advantage. During the race, Racer A gets a clear advantage off the starting line. But to not be disqualified by racing faster than the dial-in time, Racer A slows near the finish line to just barely beat Racer B.

==Short track racing==
The term is frequently used in for deliberately qualifying poorly at short track racing events. Some tracks/series start the fastest qualifiers at the rear of the field and the slowest qualifiers at the front of the field. So faster cars sometimes deliberately qualify poorly so they have to pass fewer cars (and only slower cars). To counteract sandbagging, tracks and series often invert some of the fastest qualifiers and start slower cars behind them. The number of cars to be inverted are typically not known to the drivers as they qualify, and often the fastest qualifier (who wins a cash bonus) will typically participate in a random drawing to determine the number of inverted cars after qualifying has concluded. Other tracks give bonus points to the fastest qualifier(s), which can drastically affect end of season awards. Still other tracks use &quot;passing points&quot; to reward the most cars passed in a heat race with a better chance to advance to the feature.

Usually, the sandbagging is used only in shorter races where a pit stop is not used, such as heat races and in feature races of fewer than 100 laps in a United States Auto Club or World of Outlaws event. In most races of 125 laps or greater where a pit stop is required, inversion of fields is impossible because pit strategy negates the need for the inversion.

To prevent sandbagging in World of Outlaws sprint car races, the winner and runner-up in each heat race, along with the two fastest qualifiers who have qualified for the feature but are not one of the top two drivers, participate in a short heat race-length race that determines the starting order for the first ten (or twelve if there are five heat races) starting positions in the feature.

==Demolition derby==
In demolition derby, a driver may hit other cars weakly or avoid contact with other cars to lessen the damage to their cars to ensure better odds of surviving to win the derby as the last car running. Events often require a car to hit another car within a certain time limit, usually every 120 seconds or less, or be disqualified.

==Rallying==
In some rallying series such as the World Rally Championship, the starting order in each race leg is determined by the overall standings of the previous leg. Because some track surfaces are faster once a few cars have passed, leading drivers may slow down in the final meters of the last stage of the first (and sometimes second) leg of the race and therefore let others clean the track the next leg.

==BMX racing==
USA: In BMX Racing, there are typically three levels of proficiency for amateur riders (ABA: Novice, Intermediate, Expert; NBL: Rookie, Novice, Expert). Generally, a racer is considered to be sandbagging when they deliberately avoid winning races, thus avoiding so-called &quot;move up points&quot; (which require a rider to race the next highest proficiency after a given number of races won). Sandbagging in BMX Racing is often practiced to ensure the rider stays at a lower proficiency long enough to compete in the NBL or ABA Grand National (held each year in September and November, respectively). This race is traditionally when year-end titles and awards are decided. Deliberate sandbagging is difficult to prove and, though track personnel have the authority to report such activity to their respective sanctioning body, disciplinary action or involuntary reclassification is seemingly quite rare. Sandbagging is a hotly debated issue in the BMX Racing community, and is such taboo that &quot;call out threads&quot; are sometimes started on message boards to publicly alert others in the community of a specific rider(s) conduct.

==Video games==
Sandbagging is also prevalent in some racing games, particularly those that feature power-ups that either aid the user or hinder the opponent. In the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; video game series, players will sometimes sandbag to get powerful items such as the Star or Lightning in order to batter the other racers, take shortcuts or defend themselves from other oncoming items. Team Race Sandbagging has become infamous with players holding back and getting the Lightning Item, which only affects racers on the opposing team, allowing the user&#x27;s team to get a clear advantage. In &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot;, players may sandbag in order to get the powerful All-Star Moves, just to use them on the other players.

==RC car racing==
In radio controlled car racing, participants can usually choose the classes in which they want to compete. Many tracks have levels such as rookie, sportsman, intermediate, and expert, for the same type of vehicle. So a driver may claim to be at the sportsman level when in fact they are easily fast enough to be competitive in intermediate, but they know they will have a much easier time winning if they compete in the lower class. This may happen more often at larger races that award trophies and other prizes, compared with local club races that usually award the winner only with a podium photo. Sandbagging is frowned upon by track owners and fellow competitors since it is clearly not a fair way to compete, so some race directors will bump someone up or ask them to move up if they feel they are in the wrong class. Some tracks have explicit rules where you have to bump up if you have won a certain number of races in one class. Often apparent sandbagging is not intentional, and is actually the result of someone sincerely misjudging their own skill level. This can happen if someone is new to the track and doesn&#x27;t know their level in comparison to others, or if they have not competed for some time and are not sure they can immediately regain their previous skill level.

<text>Sir William Scroggs (c. 162325 October 1683) was Lord Chief Justice of England from 1678 to 1681. He is best remembered for presiding over the Popish Plot trials, where he was accused of showing bias against the accused.

==Youth and early career==
Scroggs was the son of an Oxford landowner; the story of him being the son of a butcher of sufficient means to give his son a university education is merely a rumour, although one which was widely believed. He spent his youth in Stifford. He went to Oriel College, and later to Pembroke College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1640, having acquired a fair knowledge of the classics. There is some evidence that he fought on the royalist side during the Civil War; certainly, his loyalty to the Crown was never doubted in later years. In 1653 he was called to the bar, and soon gained good practice in the courts.

He was appointed a judge of the Common Pleas in 1676. Two years later he was promoted to the office of Lord Chief Justice on the recommendation of the Earl of Danby, the King&#x27;s chief minister, who was his patron, and knew that he was both a good lawyer and a staunch supporter of the Crown. His hatred of Roman Catholic priests, which was to play so large a part in the Popish Plot trials, was not a fault in the eyes of Danby, who although he was the son of a Catholic mother, adhered to his father&#x27;s Protestant faith. The King, although he was himself in all but outward appearance a Catholic, also accepted the need to maintain a public appearance of conformity to the Church of England, and to favour staunchly Protestant officeholders. Also, like Danby, he was anxious that the High Court judges should be good &quot;King&#x27;s men&quot;.

===Scroggs on Roman Catholicism===
Scroggs was noted for his violent hatred of, and public outbursts against Catholic priests, of which perhaps the most notorious was: &quot;they eat their God, they kill their King, and saint the murderer!&quot;. His attitude towards Catholic laymen was far less hostile: even in 1678, at the height of the Plot fever, he admitted that there were hundreds of honest Catholic gentlemen in England who would never engage in any conspiracy against the King. Lay Catholics who gave evidence at the Plot trials were, in general, accorded more courtesy than were priests: at the trial of Sir George Wakeman, Ellen Rigby, the former housekeeper of the Benedictine order&#x27;s house in London, was treated by Scroggs (who was reputed to be something of a misogynist) with the utmost respect.

==Lord Chief Justice and the Popish Plot==

As Lord Chief Justice, Scroggs presided at the trial of the persons denounced by Titus Oates and other informers for complicity in the fabricated &quot;Popish Plot&quot;, and he treated these prisoners with characteristic violence and brutality, overwhelming them with sarcasm and abuse while on their trial, and taunting them when sentencing them to death. So careless was he of the rights of the accused that at one trial he admitted to the jury during his summing-up that he had forgotten much of the evidence. In fairness to Scroggs, he seems to have been a sincere believer in the existence of the Plot, as was much of the general public and Parliament, but he did nothing to test the credibility of witnesses like Oates, William Bedloe, Miles Prance and Thomas Dangerfield, even though he knew well that Bedloe and Dangerfield were leading figures in the criminal underworld. He also knew that Prance had made his confession only after a threat of torture. Another leading informer, Stephen Dugdale, was arguably a case apart as he was a person of good social standing, and was generally regarded as &quot;a man of sense and temper&quot;, with &quot;something in his manner which disposed people to believe him&quot;. Scroggs, like many others (even the King, who was in general a complete sceptic about the veracity of the Plot), can be excused for finding his evidence credible, at least in the early stages of the Plot. 

===William Staley===
In November 1678 William Staley, a young Catholic banker, was executed for treason, the precise charge being that he had &quot;imagined (i.e. threatened) the King&#x27;s death&quot;. Gilbert Burnet later made a violent attack on the character and credibility of William Carstares, the Crown&#x27;s chief witness, who testified that while dining in the Black Lion Pub in Convent Garden he had heard Staley say in French: &quot;the King is a great heretic...this is the hand that shall kill him&quot;. His speaking in French (this was confirmed by another witness) attracted suspicion, although in fact, it was perfectly understandable since the guest he was dining with, one Monsieur Fromante, was a Frenchman. Despite Burnet&#x27;s low opinion of Carstares, it is likely enough that he told the truth when he testified that Staley, who was a heavy drinker, had made this threat against the King when he was inebriated, but in less disturbed times Staley could have hoped to escape with a severe reprimand. Scroggs in his summing up did tell the jury that in case of a man&#x27;s life, he would have no regard paid to &quot;the rumours and disorders of the time&quot; but the rest of his charge was wholly in favour of a guilty verdict, which the jury duly brought in without even leaving the box. Staley was hung, drawn and quartered, but as a gesture of clemency, the Government released his body to his family for proper burial. The family unwisely had a series of requiem masses said for his soul, followed by a magnificent funeral at the Anglican St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Convent Garden. The Government, infuriated, ordered that Staley&#x27;s body be dug up and quartered, and his head cut off and placed on London Bridge.

===Edward Colman===

A week later Edward Colman, former private secretary to the Duke of York, was executed for his allegedly treasonable correspondence with Louis XIV of France. Again Scroggs drove hard for a conviction, despite Colman&#x27;s standing as a Government official. Colman&#x27;s letters, in which he urged Louis to press Charles II for dissolution of Parliament, by bribery if necessary, showed a grave lack of political judgement, but it was straining the law very far to call them treasonable. The correspondence, which had apparently ended in 1674 or 1675, had no effect whatever on English foreign policy, and was of such little importance that Colman, until he was confronted with the letters after his arrest, had apparently forgotten writing them. Scroggs told Colman that he had been condemned on his own papers; this was fortunate for the Crown, since the evidence of Oates and Bedloe of overt acts of treason was so feeble that Scroggs in his summing-up simply ignored it. Scroggs later boasted that he had hanged Colman &quot;against the will of the Court&quot;, but in fact, it seems that the King was happy enough to sacrifice Colman, whom he had long regarded as a troublemaker.

===Berry, Green and Hill===

At the trial in February 1679 of the prisoners Henry Berry, Robert Green, and Lawrence Hill, accused of the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, Scroggs gave a characteristic exhibition of his methods, indulging in a tirade against the Roman Catholic religion, and loudly proclaiming his belief in the guilt of the accused. When Lawrence Hill&#x27;s wife boldly accused Miles Prance, the Crown&#x27;s chief witness, of perjury in open court, Scroggs said incredulously &quot;You cannot think that he will swear three men out of their lives for nothing?&quot;. All three defendants were put to death. As Mrs. Hill had correctly predicted, Prance later confessed that he had perjured himself under the threat of torture and that the three men executed were wholly innocent.

==Scroggs turns against the Plot==

It was only when, in July of the same year, Oates&#x27;s accusation against the Queen&#x27;s physician, Sir George Wakeman, appeared likely to involve the Queen herself in the ramifications of the plot, that Scroggs began to think matters were going too far; he was probably also influenced by the discovery that the Court regarded the plot with disbelief and disfavour, and that the Country Party led by Lord Shaftesbury had less influence than he had supposed with the King. The Chief Justice on this occasion threw grave doubt on the trustworthiness of Bedloe and Oates as witnesses, and warned the jury to be careful in accepting their evidence. Wakeman and three priests, including the leading Benedictine Maurus Corker, who were tried with him, were duly acquitted. Scroggs for the first time observed that even a Catholic priest might be innocent of anything but being a priest (which was itself a capital crime under the Jesuits, etc. Act 1584, although Corker and the others were spared the death penalty, and were all released after spending some time in jail).

This inflamed public opinion against Scroggs, for the popular belief in the plot was still strong. He was accused of taking bribes from the Portuguese Ambassador, the Marquis of Arronches, acting on behalf of the Portuguese-born Queen, to secure Wakeman&#x27;s acquittal. In the circumstances, the decision of the Ambassador to call on Scroggs the day after the trial to thank him for securing an acquittal has been described as an act of &quot;incredible folly&#x27;.

In August 1679 the King fell desperately ill at Windsor, and for some days his life was despaired of. Scroggs, fearing for his future, rushed to Windsor to find the King making a slow recovery: seeing Scroggs hovering anxiously in the background, the King told him that he had nothing to fear: &quot;for we shall stand or fall together&quot;.

Scroggs continued in his poor treatment of Catholic priests who came before him for trial, as he showed when he sentenced Andrew Bromwich to death at Stafford in the summer of 1679 (although it must be said that he recommended Bromwich for mercy, and he was duly reprieved). Nevertheless, his proposing the Duke of York&#x27;s health at the Lord Mayor&#x27;s dinner a few months later, in the presence of Shaftesbury, indicated his determination not to support the Exclusionists against the known wishes of the King. At the opening of the Michaelmas Term he delivered a speech on the need for judicial independence: &quot;the people ought to be pleased with public justice and not justice seek to please the people... justice should flow like a mighty stream... neither for my part do I think we live in so corrupted an age that no man can with safety be just and follow his own conscience.&quot; Kenyon remarks that whatever Scroggs&#x27;s faults, this speech shows that he was far more than the &quot;brainless bully&quot; he is sometimes portrayed as.

===Scroggs and Samuel Pepys===

When Samuel Pepys was accused of treason, Scroggs, no doubt mindful that both Charles II and his brother the Duke of York had a high regard for Pepys, treated him with the utmost courtesy, and he never actually stood trial. As a result, the picture of Scroggs in Pepys&#x27;s third diary, the so-called &quot;King&#x27;s Bench Journal&quot;, is surprisingly favourable. Pepys was particularly impressed by a remark of Scroggs that Pepys and his co-accused Sir Anthony Deane were Englishmen and &quot;should have the rights of Englishmen&quot;.

Scroggs had already directed the acquittal of Pepys&#x27;s clerk Samuel Atkins on the charge of having conspired to murder Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey, a charge which was clearly designed to damage Pepys himself. Scroggs conducted Atkins&#x27;s trial with refreshing humanity and good humour. When Atkins&#x27; alibi witness, Captain Vittles, testified that Atkins had drunk so much wine on the night in question that he could not possibly have killed anyone, Scroggs, himself a notably heavy drinker, cheerfully said: &quot;Do you both go out and share another bottle of wine&quot;.

==Last years on the Bench==

Acting in the assurance of popular sympathy, Oates and Bedloe now arraigned the Chief Justice before the Privy Council for having discredited their evidence and misdirected the jury in the Wakeman case, accusing him at the same time of several other misdemeanours on the bench, including a habit of excessive drinking and foul language (the charge of heavy drinking at least was probably true enough). In January 1680 the case was argued before the Council and Scroggs was acquitted. Scroggs repeated the attacks he had made on Oates&#x27; credibility at Wakeman&#x27;s trial, and the King expressed his full confidence in him. At the trials of Elizabeth Cellier and of Lord Castlemaine in June of the same year, both of whom were acquitted, he discredited Dangerfield&#x27;s evidence, calling him &quot;a notorious villain ... he was in Chelmsford gaol&quot;, and on the former occasion committed the witness to prison. In the same month, he discharged the grand jury of Middlesex before the end of term in order to save the Duke of York from indictment as a popish recusant, a proceeding which the House of Commons declared to be illegal, and which was made an article in the impeachment of Scroggs in January 1681. The dissolution of Parliament put an end to the impeachment, but the King now felt secure enough to dispense with his services, and in April Scroggs, much it seems to his own surprise, was removed from the bench, although with a generous pension. He retired to his country home at South Weald in Essex; he also had a townhouse at Chancery Lane in London, where he died on 25 October 1683.

==Family==

Scroggs married Anne Fettyplace (died 1689), daughter of Edmund Fettyplace of Berkshire: they had four children:

*Sir William Scroggs junior (died 1695), who like his father was a barrister
*Mary (died 1675)
*Anne (died 1713), who married as his third wife Sir Robert Wright, who like her father became Lord Chief Justice of England but died in prison after the Glorious Revolution
*Elizabeth (died 1724), who married firstly Anthony Gylby and secondly Charles Hatton, younger son of Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton.

Scroggs&#x27; opinion of his wife, and of women in general, may perhaps be inferred from an irritable remark he made at the trial for treason of the barrister Richard Langhorne in 1679. Despite objections from William Bedloe, Scroggs permitted female observers like Mary, Lady Worcester, to take notes of the evidence, on the ground that &quot;a woman&#x27;s notes will not signify, truly – no more than her tongue&quot;. On the other hand, at Wakeman&#x27;s trial, he treated Ellen Rigby, the former housekeeper at the Benedictine house in London, with great respect, and told the jury to treat her evidence for the defence as credible, a tribute to her forceful personality.

==Personality and lifestyle==

Scroggs was a judge at a time when many members of the High Court Bench were considered corrupt and unfair, and his temper and treatment of defendants were an example of the endemic problems with the judiciary, whose coarse and brutal manners shocked most educated laymen. He served on the bench during the same period as Judge Jeffreys who has been criticised for similarly poor treatment of defendants and witnesses. Kenyon notes that while their behaviour in Court seems &quot;degrading and disgusting&quot; by modern standards, at the time it was taken for granted: &quot;the judges&#x27; manners were rough because they were a rough lot&quot;.

Scroggs was the subject of many contemporary satires; he was reputed to live a debauched lifestyle, he was undoubtedly a heavy drinker, and his manners during trials were considered &#x27;coarse&#x27; and &#x27;violent&#x27;. Roger North, who knew him well, described him as a man of great wit and fluency, but &quot;scandalous, violent, intemperate and extreme&quot;. Forty years after his death, Jonathan Swift in his celebrated attack on William Whitshed, Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, called him &quot;as vile and profligate a villain as Scroggs&quot;.

==Legal writings==
Scroggs was the author of a work on the Practice of Courts-Leet and Courts-Baron (published posthumously in London, 1701), and he edited reports of the state trials over which he presided.

<text>Lewandowski (; feminine Lewandowska, plural Lewandowscy) is a Polish-language surname. In other languages it may be transliterated as Lewandowsky, Levandovski, Levandovsky, Levandovskyy, Levandoski, Levandovskiy.

It is the seventh most common surname in Poland (93,404 people in 2009).

It is unlikely to be derived from the place name &quot;&quot;, because the surname was registered much earlier than the settlement was founded. The surname was recorded for the first time in 1673, although &quot;Lavendowski&quot;, which is probably its variant, is known since 1608.

<text>Thomas Dangerfield (c. 165022 June 1685) was an English conspirator, who became one of the principal informers in the Popish Plot. His violent death at the hands of the barrister Robert Francis was clearly a homicide, although whether the killing was murder or manslaughter was a matter of considerable public debate at the time.

==Biography==
Dangerfield was born about 1650 at Waltham Abbey, Essex, the son of a farmer. At the age of about 12 in about 1662, he ran away from home to London, and never returned to his home.

He began his career of crime by robbing his father of both horses and money, and, after a rambling life, which brought him to Scotland, France, Spain and Portugal, took to coining counterfeit money, for which offence and numerous others he was many times imprisoned: it was said later that to describe his career one need simply list every capital crime known to English law. Lord Chief Justice Scroggs later referred to him with contempt as &quot;that fellow from Chelmsford gaol&quot;, and he also spent time in Newgate Prison. He used a number of aliases, most commonly Willoughby.

==Popish Plot==

False to everyone, he first tried to involve James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth and others by concocting information about a Presbyterian plot against the throne, and this having been proved a lie, he pretended to have discovered a Catholic plot against Charles II. This was known as the Mealtub Plot, from the place where the incriminating documents were hidden at his suggestion, and found by the King&#x27;s officers by his information.

Mrs Elizabeth Cellier, in whose house the meal tub was found, was a well-known Roman Catholic midwife and almoner to Elizabeth Herbert, Marchioness of Powis. She had rescued Dangerfield from a debtors&#x27; prison and befriended him when he posed as a Catholic. She was, with her patroness Lady Powis, tried for high treason but acquitted in 1680: with the general waning of hysteria, men as disreputable as Dangerfield were no longer considered to be credible witnesses.

For a time Dangerfield was used as a secondary witness in the Popish Plot trials to supplement the evidence of Titus Oates and William Bedloe. However, his character was so unsavoury, even compared to that of the other informers, that Chief Justice William Scroggs, who knew his record of crime thoroughly, began instructing juries to disregard the evidence of &quot;so notorious a villain... I shall shake all such fellows before I am done&quot;. When Dangerfield protested publicly that he had sincerely repented of his former crimes, Scroggs, who did not tolerate interruptions in his Court, roared: &quot;What, do you with all the mischief that Hell hath in you, dare to brave it in a court of justice?&quot;

Dangerfield, when examined at the bar of the House of Commons, made other charges against prominent Roman Catholics, and attempted to defend his character by publishing, among other pamphlets, &quot;Dangerfield&#x27;s Narrative&quot;.

==Death; the fate of Robert Francis==

The publication of his &quot;Narrative&quot; led, once public opinion had turned against the informers, to his trial for libel (Kenyon notes that he could not as the law stood be tried for perjury, as no-one had actually been convicted on his evidence). Dangerfield went into hiding in 1684 as soon as he heard about the threatened trial, but when James succeeded as King in February 1685 the new Government made a determined search for him and found him. He was tried and speedily convicted. On 20 June 1685 he received his sentence, which was to stand in the pillory on two consecutive days, be whipped from Aldgate to Newgate, and two days later from Newgate to Tyburn.

On his way back from the first whipping on 22 June Dangerfield, who rather surprisingly was travelling by coach, got into an argument at Hatton Garden with a barrister, Robert Francis, who made a jeering remark, on the lines of &quot;How do you, after your little race?&quot; Dangerfield in return spat on him and called him a son of a whore, whereupon Francis struck Dangerfield in the eye with his cane: the cane apparently entered the brain, and Dangerfield died shortly afterwards from the blow.

Francis was tried and convicted for murder, and sentenced to death, despite his insistence that he never meant to kill Dangerfield. Several witnesses testified that on the contrary he had deliberately stabbed at Dangerfield&#x27;s eye, and there was also some evidence that he had said that &quot;he would save the hangman the trouble of killing Dangerfield&quot;. Nonetheless the verdict of murder came as a surprise to the public, the general view being that the death &quot;could scarce be even called manslaughter&quot;. Sir John Reresby wrote that he was sure that Francis had had no intention of killing Dangerfield, &quot;for he had a sword by his side, which was a more likely thing to kill him than that little cane, indeed the smallest that ever I saw&quot;. King James II was solicited strongly to grant Francis a royal pardon, on the 
basis of his previously blameless 
life, but, despite his low opinion of Dangerfield, he said that it would be wrong to let his murderer go unpunished, and Francis was duly executed on 24 July 1685.

Sir John Bramston in a contemptuous epitaph wrote that Dangerfield deserved no pity: &quot;he had been a highway thief, a cheat, a little rogue.. but there is an end of him&quot;.

==The Narrative - aftermath==

In 1684 Sir William Williams, later Solicitor General, who as Speaker of the House of Commons had authorised the publication of Dangerfield&#x27;s &quot;Narrative&quot; in 1680, was heavily fined for a libel on James II and another on Lord Peterborough as a result. James, with more magnanimity than he usually showed to political opponents, reduced both fines, and later restored Williams to royal favour and appointed him Solicitor General.

==In fiction==

He is the subject, and perhaps the author, of &quot;Don Tomazo, or The Juvenile Rambles of Thomas Dangerfield&quot; (1680), a comic, self-consciously literary novel that presents Dangerfield as a clever and resourceful rogue. It is reprinted in Spiro Peterson&#x27;s &quot;The Counterfeit Lady Unveiled and Other Criminal Fiction of Seventeenth-Century England&quot; (1961) and in Paul Salzman&#x27;s &quot;Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Fiction&quot; (1991).

<text>Dąbrowski (; feminine Dąbrowska, plural Dąbrowscy) or Dabrowski is the 11th most common surname in Poland (87,304 people in 2009); this is down from an apparent rank of 4th in 1990.

&quot;Dąbrowski&quot; is a habitational name derived from the placename &quot;Dąbrowa&quot; or &quot;Dąbrówka&quot;, which is used for several specific places in Poland or generically as &quot;oak grove&quot;, the English meaning for these Polish words. Variants of the surname include Dombrowski, Dobrowski, and Dobrosky. &quot;Dobrowski&quot; also has an independent origin as a habitational name derived from the placename &#x27;Dobrów&#x27;. The text-figure below summarizes the relationships among these various words. In other Slavic countries, the same surname takes the form Dubrovsky, as the Polish &quot;ą&quot; corresponds to &quot;u&quot; in most other Slavic languages.

<doc id="1274551" wikidata="Q5500877" url="?curid=1274551" title="Freeforall">
<text>&quot;Freeforall&quot; is a 1986 dystopian short story by Margaret Atwood, often described as a gender flipped version of her novel &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

==Background==
Atwood envisioned &quot;Freeforall&quot; as a companion piece to &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, published a year prior. Like &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Freeforall&quot; is set in an dystopian society. Atwood intended this dystopia to evoke responses to the then-widespread AIDS epidemic: &quot;The solution that society has come up with is that you would have to have arranged marriages, and you would have to have sexually pure participants, otherwise everyone would just die.&quot;

&quot;Freeforall&quot; was first published on Sept 20, 1986 in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;&#x27;s Life section, as part of a series called &quot;The Family Into 2001.&quot; A year later, the story ran in the Canadian anthology series &quot;Tesseracts&quot;.

Atwood originally intended &quot;Freeforall&quot; to appear in her 1994 collection &quot;Good Bones and Simple Murders&quot; but ultimately decided it did not fit the theme. At her editors&#x27; request, she included a new version of &quot;Freeforall,&quot; abridged and slightly rewritten, in a 2023 anthology of stories &quot;Old Babes in the Wood&quot;.

==Summary==
The story is set in the year 2026, a time of widespread and rampant sexually transmitted diseases in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Society is extremely limited, with freedoms tightly regulated by a totalitarian state in the name of saving society from these illnesses. 

The world&#x27;s population is tightly segregated with the infected living somewhere on the &quot;outside,&quot; presumably in deplorable conditions and left to their own devices. These &quot;freeforalls,&quot; areas of sexual freedom, are tacitly encouraged, with the intent that the presumed anarchy and privation will lead to the natural elimination of disease when all the human carriers are dead. The infected are condemned and are left to perish, with no assistance offered from the &quot;inside&quot;. Moral value has been placed on disease with the infected being treated as having brought the trouble onto themselves.

Minimal detail is supplied about the &quot;outside&quot; world, and it is referred to only indirectly and reflected in the fears of the healthy inside population. This presumably healthy population lives under extreme duress, and gender roles appear to be breaking down. A group of &quot;Mothers&quot; has arranged young girls and boys to be married off and to live celibate lives, using a &quot;turkey baster&quot; rather than sexual intercourse to procreate.

<text>Jankowski ( ; feminine: Jankowska; plural: Jankowscy) is the 13th most common surname in Poland (69,280 people in 2009). Many village estates were named Jankowa or Jankowice in 13th and 14th century Poland, producing at least twelve unrelated families with this surname. Over thirty place names with &#x27;Jankow&#x27; (derived from Jan (John)) as a prefix remain in modern Poland. In most cases, the originator of the surname was a landowner of a reasonably sized estate (tens of hectares as a minimum but could be over one thousand hectares). Landowners often formed their surnames by adding the suffix &#x27;-ski&#x27;, meaning &#x27;of&#x27;, to the estate name. They generally had considerable prestige and legal rights as the use of &#x27;-ski&#x27; indicated their adoption into the Polish nobility termed szlachta. To distinguish the different Jankowski szlachta families, they each used an additional identifier signifying their armorial crest or clan, termed &#x27;herb&#x27; in Polish (see Boniecki, &quot;Herbarsz Polski&quot;).

<text>William Bedloe (20 April 165020 August 1680) was an English fraudster and Popish Plot informer.

==Life==
He was born at Chepstow in Monmouthshire; he was probably the son of Isaac Bedloe, himself the son of an Irish Army officer, and a cousin of William Kemys (or Kemish), who became High Sheriff of Monmouthshire in 1678. Bedloe appears to have been well educated; he was certainly clever, and after moving to London in 1670 he became acquainted with some Jesuits and was occasionally employed by them. Calling himself at one time Captain Williams, at others Lord Gerard or Lord Newport or Lord Cornwallis, he travelled from one part of Europe to another, usually accompanied by his brother James. In the 1670s he was imprisoned for fraud and became an expert in a number of criminal enterprises. The historian John Kenyon described him as &quot;an experienced member of a London underworld of crime and vice of which we know almost nothing&quot;.

Then in 1678, following the lead of Titus Oates, he gave an account of a supposed Popish Plot to the English government, and his version of the details of the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey was rewarded with £500. Kenyon concluded that while Bedloe probably had no direct knowledge about Godfrey&#x27;s murder, he had learned enough about it from his extensive contacts in the criminal underworld to tell a convincing story. His record as a confidence trickster was so notorious that he chose to dwell on it, explaining that it was his career as a criminal which enabled him to give first-hand evidence about the plotters. While some government officials, like Henry Coventry, were wary of relying on the testimony of such a notorious criminal, the general view was that he was too valuable as a corroborative witness to Oates to be disregarded. However, his testimony was usually of little value, apart from during the trial of Berry, Green and Hill for Godfrey&#x27;s murder, of which he may have had some personal knowledge: as a witness, he was rambling and incoherent, and had a habit of dragging in irrelevant grievances and private feuds. At most of the Popish Plot trials, like that of Edward Colman, his evidence was so weak that the Court disregarded it.

Emboldened by his success he denounced various Roman Catholics, married an Irish woman named Anna Purefoy, and having become very popular lived in luxurious fashion. Afterwards his fortunes waned, and he died at Bristol on 20 August 1680. His dying depositions, which were taken by Sir Francis North, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, revealed nothing of importance. Bedloe wrote a &quot;Narrative and impartial discovery of the horrid Popish Plot&quot; (1679), but all his statements are considered untrustworthy.

Lady Worcester, whose husband was an indirect target of Bedloe&#x27;s accusations called him &quot;a man whose whole life has been pageantry and villainy and whose word would not have been taken at sixpence&quot;. John Jeffreys, MP for Brecon and later Master of the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, who knew Bedloe personally, also denounced him as a villain. At Oates&#x27;s trial for perjury, some years after Bedloe&#x27;s death, Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys, who had condemned innocent men on Bedloe&#x27;s evidence, called him the &quot;infamous Bedloe&quot;.

<text>Mark Trevorrow (born 4 February 1959 in Melbourne, Victoria) is an Australian comedian, television host and media personality. In the early 1980s he had two Top 40 hits as part of Globos with Wendy De Waal, and in 1984, he debuted &quot;Bob Downe&quot;, who went on to become his best-known character. After being very successful at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1987, Trevorrow split his time touring between England and Australia. He has appeared extensively on television, released four albums, and written a book.

== Early life ==
He was raised in the Melbourne suburb of Murrumbeena, the third son of Alan, a builder-turned-teacher, and his wife Dorothy. He has a younger sister and two older brothers. In his teens, he came out to his family as gay. He attended Murrumbeena High School and was co-editor of the school magazine. That interest in journalism led him to become a copy boy at &quot;The Sun News-Pictorial&quot; starting at age 17, for five years. He moved on to theatre and cabaret, encouraged by the party atmosphere at the Melbourne production of The Rocky Horror Show every weekend.

==Career==
Trevorrow first came to prominence in the cabaret duo Globos with Wendy De Waal, and they scored two Australian Top 20 hits with quirky covers of &quot;Tintarella di luna&quot; (1982) and Sonny &amp; Cher&#x27;s &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; (1983), both of which were produced by Red Symons.

In 1984 he formed a comedy duo in with Cathy Armstrong, in which his flamboyant alter ego Bob Downe was born. &quot;Bob Downe&quot; is a cheesy, safari suit wearing lounge singer with dazzling teeth, and host of the fictional regional daytime TV show &quot;Good Morning Murwillumbah&quot;. The distinction between the two personae is often blurred: Trevorrow and the &quot;Prince of Polyester&quot; both appear at events and host television programs.

In January 1987, Trevorrow went solo with the character at Sydney&#x27;s Harold Park Hotel. In 1988 he took Bob Downe to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where he was a huge and instant success. Bob Downe played throughout the 1990s to ever-larger British audiences, with Trevorrow in perpetual commute between London and Sydney, touring nationally in both countries. With a multitude of UK TV credits under his beige belt, Bob Downe made his twelfth Edinburgh Fringe appearance in 2002.

Back in Australia, the first Bob Downe album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, was released in Australia in 1996, with 1997&#x27;s &quot;Jazzy!&quot; nominated for a Best Comedy Album ARIA music award. 1998 saw the Australian publication of his first book, &quot;All Bob Downe!&quot; (Penguin) and he hosted the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade broadcast for Network Ten. In 1999 and 2000, Bob Downe again hosted the Mardi Gras Parade, a consistent ratings winner for Network Ten, and also won the Cabaret Artiste of the Year at the Green Room Awards in Melbourne. He released his third album, &quot;Huge Hits&quot;, in 2001. His comedy/chat series, &quot;The Bob Downe Show&quot; (Foxtel/TV1), went to air in December 2000. Bob Downe&#x27;s last three national theatre tours, &quot;Million Sellers&quot; (1999), &quot;Whiter! Brighter!&quot; (2000) and &quot;Cold August Night&quot; (2002) were sellouts everywhere, including the Sydney Opera House and the State Theatre.

In 2001, Trevorrow made his first appearance as himself rather than his alter ego, opening a new show at the Black Cat cabaret in Melbourne. The show also appeared at the Sydney Opera House Studio in 2003, followed by a studio album &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot; in 2004 (ABC Music/Universal). Trevorrow has appeared on the Australian series of &quot;Good News Week&quot;, often joining with host Paul McDermott in a sing-along of an Australian song at the end of the episode. He has collaborated several times with the Doug Anthony All Stars (which included McDermott), appearing in their TV series, &quot;DAAS Kapital&quot;, and their film &quot;The Edinburgh Years&quot;. He has also featured in episodes of the sitcom &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;, as well as hosting the series The Way We Were, and has appeared in the animated Australian/Canadian sitcom, &quot;Quads!&quot; as the voice of Spalding (SBS 2002). Trevorrow is a regular fill-in presenter on the &quot;Evening Show&quot; on 702 ABC Sydney. He has also been a contestant on the special &quot;Australia&#x27;s Brainiest Comedian&quot;.

<doc id="1274570" wikidata="Q8049523" url="?curid=1274570" title="Yarragon railway station">
<text>Yarragon railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Yarragon, in Victoria, Australia. Yarragon station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 August 1878.

Initially opened as Waterloo, the station was given its current name of Yarragon on 17 December 1883.

==History==
In 1952, the line between Warragul and Yarragon was duplicated. In 1955, electrification of the line was extended from Warragul to Moe, passing through the station. In 1958, duplication of the line to Trafalgar occurred.

On 2 July 1987, electrification between Warragul and Traralgon ceased. During August 1988, the double line block system between Yarragon and Warragul was abolished, with automatic three position signalling introduced. Switching out facilities were also provided at Yarragon during this time.

Steam locomotive K162 is on display, opposite the entrance to Platform 1. This locomotive was exchanged for K183 of the same class, when Steamrail Victoria deemed the latter to be in better condition. K183&#x27;s tender remained, and thus K162 was painted as K183.

A disused goods platform exists behind Platform 2. By 2019, it was partly demolished, and the rail was removed.

==Platforms and services==

Yarragon has two side platforms. It is serviced by V/Line Traralgon and selected Bairnsdale line services.

Platform 1:
* services to Traralgon, Bairnsdale and Southern Cross

Platform 2:
* services to Traralgon, Bairnsdale and Southern Cross

<doc id="1274571" wikidata="Q1508545" url="?curid=1274571" title="George Washington Cable">
<text>George Washington Cable (October 12, 1844 – January 31, 1925) was an American novelist notable for the realism of his portrayals of Creole life in his native New Orleans, Louisiana. He has been called &quot;the most important southern artist working in the late 19th century&quot;, as well as &quot;the first modern Southern writer.&quot; In his treatment of racism, mixed-race families and miscegenation, his fiction has been thought to anticipate that of William Faulkner.

He also wrote articles critical of contemporary society. Due to hostility against him after two 1885 essays encouraging racial equality and opposing Jim Crow, Cable moved with his family to Northampton, Massachusetts. He lived there for the next thirty years, then moved to Florida.

==Early life==
George Washington Cable was born in 1844 in New Orleans, Louisiana, to George W. Cable Sr., and Rebecca Boardman Cable. His parents were wealthy slaveholders, members of the Presbyterian Church and of New Orleans society, whose families had moved there after the Louisiana Purchase. First educated in private schools, the younger Cable had to work after his father died young: the elder Cable had lost investments, and the family struggled financially. Young Cable later learned French on his own. Supporting the Confederacy during the American Civil War, he served in the Confederate States Army, enlisting in the 4th Mississippi Cavalry Regiment in October 1863 at age 19.

==Career==
Cable&#x27;s experiences changed his ideas about Southern and Louisianan society, and he began writing during a two-year bout with malaria. In 1870, he became a journalist, writing for the &quot;New Orleans Picayune&quot;. He worked for the newspaper from 1865 to 1879, by which time he had become an established writer. In 1869, George Cable married Louisa Stewart Bartlett, with whom he had several children.

Cable was invited to submit stories to &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, which published his story &quot;Sieur George&quot; in 1873, a critical and popular success. He published six more stories of Creole life with &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; in the following three years. These were collected and published in a book in 1879 as &quot;Old Creole Days.&quot; While romantic in plot, the stories revealed the multi-cultural and multi-racial nature of antebellum New Orleans society, with ties among French, Spanish, African, Native American, and Caribbean Creoles. He also addressed conflicts that arose following the Louisiana Purchase, when traditional New Orleans Creoles of color had to confront Anglo-Americans — who ultimately asserted their concept of a biracial society, rather than acknowledging the multiracial class of free people of color.
In 1880, Cable published his first novel, &quot;The Grandissimes: A Story of Creole Life&quot;, portraying multiracial members and different classes of society in the early 1800s shortly after the Louisiana Purchase. It had first been serialized in &quot;Scribner&#x27;s.&quot; The plot follows the adventures and romances of several members of the Grandissime family, a French Creole family with mixed-race members. He used this historical romance as a way to explore society and its racial injustice, as he addressed European Creoles, the mixed-race class, &quot;plaçage&quot;, slavery, and lynchings. In the same year, the United States Census Bureau commissioned Cable to write a &quot;historical sketch&quot; of pre-Civil War New Orleans for a special section of the 10th United States Census&#x27; &quot;Social statistics of cities&quot;. He submitted a well-researched 313-page history, which was greatly reduced for publication in 1884. A complete edition was not published until 2008.

His novella &quot;Madame Delphine&quot; (1881), expanded from a short story, featured the issue of miscegenation, in which a woman of partially African descent tries to arrange the marriage of her daughter, who has more European ancestry, to one of the French Creole elite. In 1884 he published a work, &quot;Dr. Sevier&quot;, on prison reform.

After these works, Cable seemed to split his efforts between romantic novels and non-fiction articles, in which he expressed his support for racial equality and opposition to Jim Crow, such as &quot;The Freedman&#x27;s Case in Equity&quot; and &quot;The Silent South,&quot; both published in 1885. His essays were resented by many white Southerners and generated controversy.

After the end of the American Civil War, white supremacists worked to re-establish political and social supremacy over freedmen and over those who in the antebellum years had been free people of color. The Ku Klux Klan and paramilitary groups practiced racial intimidation and other efforts to dissuade blacks from voting. After Reconstruction, when Democrats regained control of the state legislature, they worked to disenfranchise blacks, and imposed legal racial segregation and other restrictive measures.

So much hostility was expressed against Cable in 1885 that he decided to leave the South. That year, he moved with his family to Northampton, Massachusetts, where he continued to write about the South in novels and critical essays. In 1888, he published &quot;Bonaventure&quot;, described as an &quot;Acadian pastoral.&quot; In total, he published 14 novels and collections of short fiction. His last novel was &quot;Lovers of Louisiana&quot; (1918).

Cable was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1888.

Cable&#x27;s wife Louise died in 1904; and in 1906 he married Eva Stenson. After Eva&#x27;s death, he married a third time, to Hanna Cowing in 1923. Two years later, Cable himself died, in St. Petersburg, Florida.

== Response and legacy ==

Cable was friends with Mark Twain, and the two writers did speaking tours together. In 1884 and 1885 they visited Toronto, Canada, twice, on a reading tour known as the &quot;Twins of Genius&quot; tour. Twain said of Cable that &quot;when it comes down to moral honesty, limpid innocence, and utterly blameless piety, the Apostles were mere policemen [compared] to Cable,&quot; despite his dark, &quot;indelicate&quot; depictions of society. Twain also mentions Cable in his book &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;:

The party had the privilege of idling through this ancient quarter of New Orleans with the South&#x27;s finest literary genius, the author of &quot;the Grandissimes.&quot; In him the South has found a masterly delineator of its interior life and its history. In truth, I find by experience, that the untrained eye and vacant mind can inspect it and learn of it and judge of it more clearly and profitably in his books than by personal contact with it.

With Mr. Cable along to see for you, and describe and explain and illuminate, a jog through that old quarter is a vivid pleasure. And you have a vivid sense as of unseen or dimly seen things—vivid, and yet fitful and darkling; you glimpse salient features, but lose the fine shades or catch them imperfectly through the vision of the imagination: a case, as it were, of ignorant near-sighted stranger traversing the rim of wide vague horizons of Alps with an inspired and enlightened long-sighted native.

Modern literary historians have said that Cable&#x27;s treatment of racism in his fiction influenced the later work of William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren. He has been called &quot;the most important southern artist working in the late 19th century, as well as the first modern southern writer.&quot;

In 2008 a new edition of his history of the South, including footnotes and research, was published by Louisiana State University Press under the title, &quot;The New Orleans of George Washington Cable: The 1887 Census Office Report&quot;, edited and with an introduction by Lawrence N. Powell.

Cable may have coined the term &quot;authors&#x27; editor&quot;, in his 1910 tribute to his editor Richard Watson Gilder, when he wrote &quot;I think he was peculiarly an authors&#x27; editor, and not merely a publishers&#x27;.&quot;; this is the earliest known use of the term in print.

<text>Trafalgar railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Trafalgar, in Victoria, Australia. Trafalgar station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring two side platforms. It opened on 1 August 1878.

Initially opened as Trafalgar, the station was renamed two times. It was renamed to Narracan on 5 May 1884, then was given its current name of Trafalgar on 2 June of that year.

==History==
In 1955, electrification of the line was extended from Warragul to Moe, passing through the station. In 1958, the line from Yarragon was duplicated, and included a new down platform (Platform 2), a new signal panel and flashing light signals at the Ashby Street level crossing, located nearby in the up direction of the station. In 1960, the line between Trafalgar and Moe was duplicated.

On 2 July 1987, electrification between Warragul and Traralgon ceased. In 1996, a footbridge at the station, which was located at the up end, was closed, and replaced with a pedestrian crossing. In 1997, boom barriers were provided at the Ashby Street level crossing.

A disused goods shed and platform formerly existed behind Platform 2. However, were removed in 2004 by the current land owners, Reid Stockfeeds. On 28 April 2006, the signal panel was abolished.

==Platforms and services==

<text>Morwell railway station is a regional railway station on the Gippsland line, part of the Victorian railway network. It serves the town of Morwell, in Victoria, Australia. Morwell station is a ground level unstaffed station, featuring one side platform. It opened on 1 June 1877.

A disused track exists opposite the single platform, which was used in the past when State Electricity Commission and rail freight trains were more common.

Two branch lines exist at the down end of the station; the Maryvale paper mill branch, and the Energex briquette branch. The former is regularly used for paper trains each weekday, while the latter is not in use. The Energex briquette branch originally opened to traffic in 1951.

==History==
The station was electrified on 15 March 1956, and had regular electric locomotive services until 2 July 1987. The overhead wires were later removed.

In 1966, a signal panel was provided at the station, when Automatic and Track Control was provided between Morwell and Moe. The panel was abolished on 28 April 2006.

The station was also the terminus of the Mirboo North branch line. The last passenger service operated on 7 September 1968, with passenger services ceasing two days later, on 9 September. The last freight service operated on 18 June 1974, with the line closing six days later, on 24 June.

In 1988, a number of points at the station were abolished, as well as a siding leading to the former dock platform.

The station was upgraded during the early 1990s.

Much of the old yard located adjacent to the station was removed in 2004, as part of works associated with the Regional Fast Rail project. Latrobe City Council&#x27;s offices now reside in the former location of the yard.

As part of the Regional Rail Revival project, a second platform will be constructed at the station, and will include upgraded accessibility improvements. The crossing loop, located in the up direction of the station, will also be extended as part of the project, using the old disused track.

<text>Schiavone (; feminine &quot;Schiavona&quot;, plural &quot;Schiavoni&quot;) is an Italian ethnonym literally meaning &quot;Slavs&quot; in Old Venetian: originally, this term indicated origins in the lands of Dalmatia and Istria (in present-day Slovenia and Croatia), when under the rule of the Republic of Venice. Today it is an Italian surname.

==History==
The importance of Schiavoni&#x27;s role in the Venetian Republic is best shown by the name of one of the main streets in Venice, Riva degli Schiavoni, just in front of the Doge Palace and San Marco Square.

A number of artists who worked in Italy who were of Slavic descent were nicknamed &quot;Schiavone&quot; by their origin: some famous examples, among others, are painters Giulio Clovio and Federico Bencovich.

Schiavone was also a designation of the Oltremarini, a military unit of the same descent in the Venetian Navy. The basket-hilted sword schiavona was also named after the Schiavone.

==Surname==
In Italy, the surname Schiavone mostly occurs in the southernmost regions of the mainland, namely Campania and Apulia, but it is also common in Rome, Turin, Milan, and Syracuse. Thanks to emigration, branches of the Schiavone family can also be found in Argentina, Brazil, Malta, Uruguay, Luxembourg, United Kingdom, the Philippines the United States, and Canada

<doc id="1274594" wikidata="Q6759053" url="?curid=1274594" title="Marg Downey">
<text>Marg Downey (born 5 May 1961) is an Australian comedian and actress best known for her roles in &quot;The D Generation&quot;, &quot;Fast Forward&quot; and &quot;Full Frontal&quot;

==Early life and education==
Downey grew up in a middle-class Catholic family in the Melbourne suburb of East Malvern in an eight-child family. Her father worked as a chartered accountant. She attended Sacré Cœur School (with fellow comedian Jane Turner) in Glen Iris, and then studied Arts/Law at the University of Melbourne, where she resided at Newman College. At university, she began to perform in university revues, and auditioned for performing arts courses at the National Institute of Dramatic Art, the Victorian College of the Arts and the University of Melbourne, but was not successful in gaining entry to any of them.

==Career==
Downey first rose to prominence in the sketch comedy program &quot;The D-Generation&quot; on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in the late 1980s. She subsequently appeared in later sketch comedy series with other members of &quot;The D-Generation&quot;, including &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, &quot;Full Frontal&quot; and &quot;Something Stupid&quot;. In these, she was known for her portrayals of a news anchor, a stern SBS presenter and for her spot-on impression of current affairs host Jana Wendt. Her spoof of &quot;The What&#x27;s On SBS Presenter&quot; satirised the eccentricity of SBS programming, displaying grim masochistic determination to &quot;not miss a moment of this scintillating entertainment&quot;.

Downey starred in the 2001 Network 10 comedy series &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot;, playing the role of Principal Sue which was played by American comedian Kenan Thompson in the 2009 American Fox television re-make of the original Australian series. The animated American version was produced and written by Mitch Hurwitz, of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; fame.

In 2005, Downey was cast as a regular player in Seven&#x27;s live comedy sketch show &quot;Let Loose Live&quot;, but the show was cancelled after just two episodes due to low ratings. The following year, she appeared in the sketch show &quot;Magda&#x27;s Funny Bits&quot; alongside Magda Szubanski. In this show, she recreated her role as infomercial host Janelle, first developed on &quot;Fast Forward&quot;.

In 2018, she voiced Stanley &quot;Stan&quot; Stinkleton and the narrator in the kids TV series, &quot;Kitty Is Not a Cat&quot;.

In 2021 Downey joined the cast of ABC Drama &quot;The Newsreader&quot; in the role of Evelyn Walters, Downey reprised the role for the second series of the show.

===Comedy style===
Downey&#x27;s television roles are often authority figures or professional women with slightly eccentric personalities, such as Principal Sue in &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot; and the &quot;relationship-counselor&quot; Marion seen in comedy series &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;. On &quot;Fast Forward&quot;, Marg Downey appeared in a lot of sketches with Steve Vizard, such as &quot;Eyeball News&quot;, &quot;The Midday Show&quot;, &quot;Candid Camera&quot;, &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; and &quot;Get Smart&quot;. Downey also played Clancy in the &quot;Skippy&quot; send-up, and appeared in send-ups of &quot;I Dream Of Jeannie&quot;, &quot;Mr Ed&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot;.

<doc id="1274598" wikidata="Q1131236" url="?curid=1274598" title="Apothecary">
<text>Apothecary () is an archaic English term for a medical professional who formulates and dispenses &quot;materia medica&quot; (medicine) to physicians, surgeons and patients. The modern terms &quot;pharmacist&quot; and &quot;chemist&quot; (British English) have taken over this role. 

In some languages and regions, &quot;apothecary&quot; is not archaic and has become those languages&#x27; term for &quot;pharmacy&quot; or a pharmacist who owns one. 

Apothecaries&#x27; investigation of herbal and chemical ingredients was a precursor to the modern sciences of chemistry and pharmacology.

In addition to dispensing herbs and medicine, apothecaries offered general medical advice and a range of services that are now performed by other specialist practitioners, such as surgeons and obstetricians. Apothecary shops sold ingredients and the medicines they prepared wholesale to other medical practitioners, as well as dispensing them to patients. In 17th-century England, they also controlled the trade in tobacco which was imported as a medicine.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;apothecary&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek (, &quot;a repository, storehouse&quot;) via Latin (&quot;repository, storehouse, warehouse&quot;, cf. &#x27; and &#x27;), Medieval Latin (&quot;storekeeper&quot;), and eventually Old French .

In some European and other languages, the term is current and used to designate a pharmacist/chemist, such as Dutch and German , Hungarian , Irish , Latvian and Luxembourgish . Likewise, &quot;pharmacy&quot; translates as in Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, in Finnish, in Bosnian, in Hungarian, in Latvian, () in Serbian, () in Russian, Bulgarian, Macedonian and Ukrainian, in German and in Polish. The word in Indonesian is , which was borrowed from the Dutch . In Yiddish the word is .

Use of the term in the names of businesses varies with time and location. It is generally an Americanism, though some areas of the United States use it to invoke an experience of nostalgic revival and it has been used for a wide variety of businesses; while in other areas such as California its use is restricted to licensed pharmacies.

==History==

The profession of apothecary can be dated back at least to 2600 BC to ancient Babylon, which provides one of the earliest records of the practice of the apothecary. Clay tablets have been found with medical texts recording symptoms, prescriptions, and the directions for compounding.

The Papyrus Ebers from ancient Egypt, written around 1500 BC, contain a collection of more than 800 prescriptions. It lists over 700 different drugs.

In ancient India, the &quot;Sushruta Samhita&quot;, a compendium on the practice of medicine and medical formulations, has been traced back to the 1st century BC.

The &quot;Shen-nung pen ts&#x27;ao ching&quot;, a Chinese book on agriculture and medicinal plants (3rd century AD), is considered a foundational material for Chinese medicine and herbalism and became an important source for Chinese apothecaries. The book, which documented 365 treatments, had a focus on roots and grass. It had treatments which came from minerals, roots and grass, and animals. Many of the mentioned drugs and their uses are still followed today. Ginseng&#x27;s use as a sexual stimulant and aid for erectile dysfunction stems from this book. Ma huang, an herb first mentioned in the book, led to the introduction of the drug ephedrine into modern medicine.

According to Sharif Kaf al-Ghazal, and S. Hadzovic, apothecary shops existed during the Middle Ages in Baghdad, operated by pharmacists in 754 during the Abbasid Caliphate, or Islamic Golden Age. Apothecaries were also active in Al-Andalus by the 11th century.

By the end of the 14th century, Geoffrey Chaucer (–1400) was mentioning an English apothecary in the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;, specifically &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale&quot; as Pertelote speaks to Chauntecleer (lines 181–184):

... and for ye shal nat tarie,&lt;br&gt;
 Though in this toun is noon apothecarie,&lt;br&gt;
 I shal myself to herbes techen yow,&lt;br&gt;
 That shul been for youre hele and for youre prow.&lt;br&gt;
In modern English, this can be translated as:
&quot;... and you should not linger,&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Though in this town there is no apothecary,&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;I shall teach you about herbs myself,&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&quot;That will be for your health and for your pride.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
In Renaissance Italy, Italian Nuns became a prominent source for medicinal needs. At first they used their knowledge in non-curative uses in the convents to solidify the sanctity of religion among their sisters. As they progressed in skill they started to expand their field to create profit. This profit they used towards their charitable goals. Because of their eventual spread to urban society, these religious women gained &quot;roles of public significance beyond the spiritual realm (Strocchia 627). Later apothecaries led by nuns were spread across the Italian peninsula.

From the 15th century to the 16th century, the apothecary gained the status of a skilled practitioner. In London, the apothecaries merited their own livery company, the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, founded in 1617. Its roots, however, go back much earlier to the Guild of Pepperers formed in London in 1180. Similarly in Ireland, Apothecaries were organized since before 1446. In Ireland and Great Britain they were allowed to diagnose in addition to compounding and dispensing, becoming regulated general medical practitioners and the forerunners of General Practitioners there.


However, there were ongoing tensions between apothecaries and other medical professions, as is illustrated by the publication of &#x27;A Short View of the Frauds and Abuses Committed by Apothecaries&#x27; by the Physician Christopher Merrett in 1669 and the experiences of Susan Reeve Lyon and other women apothecaries in 17th century London. Often women (who were prohibited from entering medical school) became apothecaries which took away business from male physicians. In 1865 Elizabeth Garrett Anderson became the first woman to be licensed to practice medicine in Britain by passing the examination of the Society of Apothecaries. By the end of the 19th century, the medical professions had taken on their current institutional form, with defined roles for physicians and surgeons, and the role of the apothecary was more narrowly conceived, as that of pharmacist (dispensing chemist in British English).

In German-speaking countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, pharmacies or chemist stores are still called apothecaries or in German &quot;Apotheken&quot;. The &quot;Apotheke&quot; (&quot;store&quot;) is legally obligated to be run at all times by at least one &quot;Apotheker&quot; (male) or &quot;Apothekerin&quot; (female), who actually has an academic degree as a pharmacist – in German &quot;Pharmazeut&quot; (male) or &quot;Pharmazeutin&quot; (female) – and has obtained the professional title &quot;Apotheker&quot; by either working in the field for numerous years, usually by working in a pharmacy store, or taking additional exams. Thus a &quot;Pharmazeut&quot; is not always an &quot;Apotheker&quot;. Magdalena Neff became the first woman to gain a medical qualification in Germany when she studied pharmacy at the Technical University of Karlsruhe and later passed the apothecary&#x27;s examination in 1906.

Apothecaries used their own measurement system, the apothecaries&#x27; system, to provide precise weighing of small quantities. Apothecaries dispensed vials of poisons as well as medicines, and as is still the case, medicines could be either beneficial or harmful if inappropriately used. Protective methods to prevent accidental ingestion of poisons included the use of specially-shaped containers for potentially poisonous substances such as laudanum.

=== Apothecary work as gateway to women as healers ===

Apothecary businesses were typically family-run, and wives or other women of the family worked alongside their husbands in the shops, learning the trade themselves. Women were still not allowed to train and be educated in universities so this allowed them a chance to be trained in medical knowledge and healing. Previously, women had some influence in other women&#x27;s healthcare, such as serving as midwives and other feminine care in a setting that was not considered appropriate for males. Though physicians gave medical advice, they did not make medicine, so they typically sent their patients to particular independent apothecaries, who did also provide some medical advice, in particular remedies and healing.

==Methods==

=== Recipes ===
Many recipes for medicines included herbs, minerals, and pieces of animals (meats, fats, skins) that were ingested, made into paste for external use, or used as aromatherapy. Some of these are similar to natural remedies used today, including catnip, chamomile, fennel, mint, garlic, and witch hazel. Many other ingredients used in the past such as urine, fecal matter, earwax, human fat, and saliva, are no longer used and are generally considered ineffective or unsanitary. Trial and error were the main source for finding successful remedies, as little was known about the chemistry of why certain treatments worked. For instance, it was known that drinking coffee could help cure headaches, but the existence and properties of caffeine itself was still a mystery.

<doc id="1274599" wikidata="Q4185159" url="?curid=1274599" title="Zalewski">
<text>Zalewski (feminine: Zalewska, plural: Zalewscy) is a Polish-language surname. Alternate spellings include Zelewski, Zaleski, Zeleski, Zalewska and Zaller.

The form &quot;Zalewski&quot; is the hypercorrect form of &quot;Zaleski&quot;. By analogy with other surnames, like Chotomowski (colloquially pronounced as if spelt &quot;Chotomoski&quot;), Olszewski (&quot;Olszeski&quot;) etc., it may seem that the shorter spelling must reflect the popular pronunciation and not the older, etymological one, but this is not the case. The original form &quot;Zaleski&quot; was derived from a place called Zalesie or Zalas, which literally means &quot;an area close to a forest, behind a forest&quot;. It is difficult to assess which regions were primarily connected with it, because of the significant number of villages by such names. (Another case of such hypercorrection is Dmowski, derived from Dmochy, not *Dmów or *Dmowo).

Another possible etymology for one of the forms of Zalewski surname comes from a topographic name for someone who lived by a flood plain, bay, or any other small body of water. Two locations that this may be connected to are &quot;Zalew&quot; in Sieradz voivodeship or &quot;Zalewo&quot; in Olsztyn voivodeship.

The Germanised version of this surname is &quot;Salewski&quot; and &quot;Saleski&quot;, usually found in the Silesia region. 

An early form of this surname was first noted in the year 1370. Many families from different classes and with different background used this surname. Several famous people have the surname Zalewski or a variant of it:

* Anna Zalewska (born 1965), Polish politician
* Aran Zalewski (born 1991), Australian field hockey player
* August Zaleski (1883-1972), Polish politician
* Emil von Zelewski (1854-1891), Imperial German Army officer
* Erich von dem Bach Zelewski (1899-1972), SS-Obergruppenführer
* Karol Zalewski (born 1993), Polish athlete
* Krystian Zalewski (born 1989), Polish athlete
* Ksawery Zalewski, Polish diplomat, part of the Piłsudski&#x27;s Prometheism government, worker of consulate in French Lille (1925–1926) and Georgian Tbilisi (1926–1936). Later titular consul in Tbilisi.
* Ludwik Zalewski (1954–2025), Polish politician
* Michał Zalewski (born 1981), Polish &quot;White Hat&quot; Hacker, computer security expert
* Nicola Zalewski, Polish footballer

<doc id="1274608" wikidata="Q811154" url="?curid=1274608" title="Crunch (exercise)">
<text>The crunch or curl-up is an abdominal exercise that works the rectus abdominis muscle. It enables both building and defining &quot;six-pack&quot; abs and tightening the belly. Crunches use the exerciser&#x27;s own body weight to tone muscle and are recommended by some experts, despite negative research results, as a low-cost exercise that can be performed at home. Crunches are less effective than other exercises such as planks and carry risk of back injury.

==Form==

The biomechanics professor Stuart McGill was quoted in &quot;The New York Times Health&quot; blog as stating:

An approved crunch begins with you lying down, one knee bent, and hands positioned beneath your lower back for support. &quot;Do not hollow your stomach or press your back against the floor&quot;, McGill says. Gently lift your head and shoulders, hold briefly and relax back down.

Research has shown that both sit-ups and crunches are mediocre strength-building exercises and have injured many people.

In a crunch, unlike a sit-up, the lower back stays on the floor. This is said to eliminate any involvement by the hip flexors, and make the crunch an effective isolation exercise for the abdominals.

==World records==
Sirous Ahmadi has the record of doing over 20000 crunches in under 5 hours on May 11, 2024.

In 2018, John Peterson from the US did 6,774 crunches in an hour and in 2021, he did a total of 13,994 crunches in two hours.

<doc id="1274616" wikidata="Q4290565" url="?curid=1274616" title="Takedown (grappling)">
<text>In martial arts and combat sports, a takedown is a technique that involves off-balancing an opponent and bringing them to the ground with the attacker landing on top. The process of quickly advancing on an opponent and attempting a takedown is known as shooting for a takedown, or simply shooting. Takedowns are usually distinguished from throws by amplitude and impact, where the purpose of a throw is to outright eliminate the opponent while purpose of a takedown is to bring the opponent down on the ground, assume a dominant position and then proceed to finish them with jointlocks, chokeholds, or ground and pound. 

In rulesets of many sports, such as Judo and Sambo, a well executed throw will end the match (with the idea being that if the match did not happen on a tatami, the one who was thrown would be unable to stand back up) while the match will continue on the ground if a takedown is used instead. Takedowns are featured in all forms of wrestling and Judo.

==Leg trip==
The leg trip is a technique in which the combatant uses their own leg(s) to off-balance an opponent, hence causing the opponent to fall to the ground. Leg trips are often integrated into more complex takedown techniques, and are also important in many throws. Takedown techniques that are pure leg trips usually involve controlling the body of the opponent, and impeding or destabilizing one or both of the opponents legs. Leg trips are featured in for instance freestyle wrestling, judo, sumo, and shuai jiao while being an illegal technique in Greco-Roman wrestling.

The scissor kick takes down an opponent by wrapping one&#x27;s legs around the opponent.

==Single leg takedown==

The single leg takedown (often shortened to single leg or single or single leg shot) involves grabbing one of the legs of the opponent, usually with both hands, and using the position to force the opponent to the ground. Typically, the lower part of the leg is pulled in one direction, while the torso or shoulder is used to press the body or upper part of the leg of the opponent in the other direction.

There are several varieties of single leg takedowns. Some involve picking up and holding the leg by the ankle and are often known as ankle picks, while other varieties include the high crotch, in which the leg is held high up in the opponent&#x27;s crotch area. The leg can be attacked either across the body (&quot;inside&quot;) or from away from the body (&quot;outside&quot;). Single leg takedowns can also be executed in combination with a leg trip to the other leg, which additionally destabilizes the opponent.

Single leg takedowns can be countered by sprawling or by hooking the lifted foot in the crotch of the aggressor (so it cannot be lifted further and to maintain a distance from the aggressor), and, where allowed, in combination with knee strikes to the head of the opponent.

In judo and other martial arts, there are many classifications of different types of single leg takedowns. Variants of the high crotch correspond to sukui nage (掬投, &quot;scoop throw&quot;), where the opponent is lifted up from the ground, while the typical forward pushing single leg takedown is classified as morote gari (双手刈, &quot;both hands scoop&quot;). Some techniques are more specific, for instance kibisu gaeshi (踵返, &quot;heel trip reversal&quot;), which is an ankle pick where the heel is grabbed, scooped up and the opponent is pushed and thrown immediately. In kuchiki taoshi (朽木落, &quot;one hand drop&quot;), the opponent&#x27;s leg is grabbed, pulled up, and used to push the opponent down to the ground in a split second. The technique was banned in judo competition by the International Judo Federation in 2010 except as a counter or combination.

==Double leg takedown==

The double leg takedown (colloquially known as a double leg or double) involves grabbing the opponent with both arms around the opponent&#x27;s legs while keeping the chest close to the opponent, and using this position to force the opponent to the ground. There are several varieties of forcing the opponent to the ground, such as lifting and slamming, or pushing forward with the shoulder while pulling the opponent&#x27;s legs. The double leg takedown can be countered similarly to a single leg takedown, by sprawling, moving away, and/or striking. The guillotine choke is also a good counter to a poorly performed double leg takedown.

The double leg takedown is in judo also referred to as &quot;morote-gari&quot;, although some hold that a double leg takedown where the opponent is lifted into the air or swept sideways should be referred to as &quot;sukui-nage&quot;. Morote-gari, despite having been used by judokas for a very long time and being approved of by Jigoro Kano himself, was not accepted until 1982 by the Kodokan as an official judo technique. Being dismissed by certain traditionalists, the technique was banned in competition by the International Judo Federation in 2010 except as a counter or combination.

Another form of a double leg takedown is the double leg and trip, in which the person shoots in and while holding both legs swings one of his legs around and pushes forward on the opponent while tripping the opponent&#x27;s leg out from under him.

==Duckunder==

In a duckunder, the attacker pulls the opponent&#x27;s elbow forward and away from the body, lowers his own head, and ducks under the opponent&#x27;s arm in an effort to get behind or at least beside the opponent; from this position the opponent can be taken down by lifting and throwing or by a leg trip.

==Fireman&#x27;s carry==

The fireman&#x27;s carry is a takedown technique that resembles a common method of carrying an injured victim by firefighters. When implemented on the right side of the opponent&#x27;s body, the attacker&#x27;s left hand pulls the opponent&#x27;s right elbow forward so the attacker&#x27;s head goes under the opponent&#x27;s right arm. At the same time, the attacker&#x27;s right hand grabs the inside of the opponent&#x27;s right thigh and lifts, while the attacker rises and drives to his left, bringing the opponent down to the ground on his right side.

A variation performed by a cross body wrist-hold is called Kraft&#x27;s Carry (Kraft coached by Wrestling&#x27;s Hall of Fame Ned Blass, designed the move in 1967-70 achieving success as a high school and collegiate wrestler). The attacker can perform either a right or reverse carry (left) by reaching up to hold the opponents high right bicep with the left hand, while reaching across taking the opponent&#x27;s right hand or wrist. This version is accomplished by “throwing” the opponents wrist aside to the left, while ducking under for the standard carry. Maximum points can be achieved by retaining the opponent&#x27;s right arm on landing and moving into a pinning position with a head and arm.

==Underhook==
A single underhook involves putting an arm under the opponent&#x27;s arm, and holding the back of the opponent&#x27;s midsection or upper body, while a double underhook involves doing this with both arms. Either can be used as the basis for a takedown because underhooks offer the potential for control of the opponent&#x27;s upper body.

==Overhook==
A single overhook, or whizzer, involves putting an arm over the opponent&#x27;s arm and encircling it. It can be used as a takedown maneuver by putting substantial weight on the targeted arm while pulling the opponent&#x27;s other arm across his body, and eventually stepping over behind the opponent.

==Bear hug==
In a bear hug, the arms are wrapped tightly around the opponent&#x27;s midsection, sometimes with one or both of the opponent&#x27;s arms pinned to the opponent&#x27;s body, so that the opponent&#x27;s chest is held tightly to the attacker&#x27;s chest. From this position the opponent can be taken down, sometimes by lifting and tilting and sometimes with the aid of a leg trip.

==Spin-around==

The spin-around is often used as a counter to an opponent&#x27;s attempt at a single- or double-leg takedown. When the opponent shoots for the legs, the targeted wrestler sprawls his legs part way back and then quickly moves around behind the opponent.

===Snapdown===

In a snapdown, both hands are placed on the back of the opponent&#x27;s neck, and when the opponent&#x27;s head is held low or is becoming lower both hands pull down sharply, propelling the opponent&#x27;s head and therefore body toward the ground. Simultaneously the attacker steps around behind the opponent.

<text>The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (c. 14), sometimes referred to as ASPA, is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed in 1986, which regulates the use of animals used for research in the UK. The Act permits studies to be conducted using animals for procedures such as breeding genetically modified animals, medical and veterinary advances, education, environmental toxicology and includes procedures requiring surgery, if certain criteria are met. Revised legislation came into force on 1 January 2013. The original act related to the 1986 EU Directive 86/609/EEC which was updated and replaced by EU Directive 2010/63/EU

In 2002, a Government select committee inquiry described the Act as the &quot;...tightest system of regulation in the world&quot; in relation to the regulation of using animals for research.

== Background ==
Prior to ASPA, the use of animals in the UK was regulated by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, which enforced a licensing and inspection system for vivisection. Animal cruelty was previously regulated by the Protection of Animals Act 1911 (now largely repealed) and more recently by the Animal Welfare Act 2006, both of which outlaw the causing of &quot;unnecessary suffering&quot;. Specific exemptions apply to experiments licensed under the 1986 Act.

== History and scope ==
The 1986 Act defined &quot;regulated procedures&quot; as animal experiments that could potentially cause &quot;pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm&quot;, to &quot;protected animals&quot;, which encompassed all living vertebrates other than humans, under the responsibility of humans. A 1993 amendment added a single invertebrate species, the common octopus (&quot;Octopus vulgaris&quot;), as a protected animal. The Act applied only to protected animals from halfway through their gestation or incubation periods (for mammals, birds and reptiles) or from when they became capable of independent feeding (for fish, amphibians, and the common octopuses). Primates, cats, dogs and horses had additional protection over other vertebrates under the Act.

Revised legislation came into force on 1 January 2013. The Act has been expanded to protect -
The definition of regulated procedures was expanded to -
ASPA also regulates the modification of genes in protected animals if this causes the animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. Other considerations in the Act include animal sources, housing conditions, identification methods and the humane killing of animals. This legislation is widely regarded as the strictest in the world protecting animals used in research. Those applying for a license must explain why such research cannot be done through non-animal or in-vitro methods. The project must also pass an ethical review panel which aims to decide if the potential benefits outweigh any suffering for the animals involved.

==Licences and certificates==
ASPA involves three levels of regulation — person, project, and place.

The &#x27;person&#x27; level is achieved by the granting of a &quot;personal licence&quot; (PIL, procedure individual licence) to a researcher wishing to carry out regulated procedures on a protected animal. Having undergone a defined sequence of training, a researcher can apply for a PIL permitting specified techniques to be carried out on named species of animals.

The &#x27;project&#x27; level of regulation is governed by the granting of a &quot;project licence&quot; (PPL) to a suitably qualified senior researcher. The PPL details the scope of the work to be carried out, the likely benefits that may be realised by the work, and the costs involved in terms of the numbers and types of animals to be used, and the harm that might be caused to the animals. Typically a large and detailed document, the PPL precisely defines which techniques may be applied to particular animals and for what purpose.

Finally, the &#x27;place&#x27; where regulated procedures are carried out is controlled by the granting of a &quot;establishment licence&quot; (PEL) to a senior authority figure at the establishment, such as the Registrar or Vice-chancellor of a University, or the Chief executive officer of a commercial company. The PEL details which rooms in the establishment are permitted to be used for certain techniques and species, but may also apply to outdoors areas and even mobile areas (e.g. boats) if this is where the research is to be conducted.

It is an offence under ASPA to carry out regulated procedures on a protected animal unless authorised by a personal licence, a project licence, and an establishment licence.

==Opinion==
A 2002 House of Lords select committee inquiry compared the Act to legislation from France, the U.S., and Japan. The report concluded that &quot;virtually all witnesses agreed that the UK has the tightest system of regulation in the world&quot; and that it is &quot;the only country to require an explicit cost/benefit assessment of every application to conduct animal research.&quot; Costs are explicitly in terms of adverse effects on animals, not the financial cost to the experimenters. This has since been re-named the harm/benefit analysis.

In 2005, Patricia Hewitt, then British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, called the Act &quot;[among] the strongest laws in the world to protect animals which are being used for medical research.&quot;

A 2006 report by Animal Aid called the Act a &quot;vivisectors&#x27; charter&quot;, alleging that it allows researchers to do as they please and makes them practically immune from prosecution. The report said that licences to perform experiments are obtained on the basis of a &quot;nod of approval&quot; from the Home Office Inspectorate, and that the Home Office relies on the researchers&#x27; own cost-benefit analysis of the value of the experiment versus the suffering caused.

<text>Famy, officially the Municipality of Famy (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 16,791 people, making it the least populated municipality in the province.

==History==
The history of the town as a barrio of Siniloan dates back to the year 1612 when its natural resources were first exploited by the busy hands of home seekers from Daraitan in Tanay. These home seekers named the place Calumpang, after a big shady Calumpang tree that grows in the heart of the place.

Year after year, the inhabitants of the place increased. People from nearby towns were attracted to the barrio because of the vast area of uncultivated lands. After years of struggle for development, they succeeded in making the lands suitable for food crops. They especially made use of the lowlands where more of the inhabitants settled. Home industries gained interest among women. Spiny bamboos were planted as raw materials for the basket industry that remained an important industry in the present time.

In the year 1835, when the people realized the changes of the place, from the bedlam of wilderness to a barrio worthy of becoming a town, they for the first time, sought to become a municipality with its own government. The plan was rejected because of the meager population of the barrio. The people did not lose hope. Again the prominent men of the barrio tried to secure the separation. Stimulated by the feeling of patriotism, men from the barrio voluntarily presented themselves as revolutionist claiming that they will fight on the side of General Emilio Aguinaldo, if the General will help making the barrio a town. So after the revolution, the President of the Philippines ordered that Calumpang be separated from the Municipality of Siniloan. Barrio Calumpang was then renamed &quot;Famy&quot;. This was in memory of Aguinaldo&#x27;s mother, Trinidad Aguinaldo y Famy.

When the Americans took possession of the Philippines, the form of government automatically changed. With an Executive Order, small towns became barrios of nearby towns. Famy was affected by this order, and again became a barrio of Siniloan in 1903. In spite of these changes the people continued the development of the barrio. They tried their best to increase the area of cultivated lands. The inhabitants of this municipality were not satisfied of being a barrio again of Siniloan, so they filed a request to the Governor General that Famy be a town again, citing that no salary for services rendered will be asked and that the municipal hall and school buildings shall be constructed, all on the help of the town&#x27;s people. By virtue of this request, the Governor General issued Executive Order No. 60 series of 1910, separating Famy from the Municipality of Siniloan, Laguna. This order took effect on August 15, 1910.

==Geography==
Famy lies in the north-eastern part of the province of Laguna via Manila East Road. It is bounded by Siniloan to the east and south, Santa Maria to the north, Mabitac and Santa Maria to the west. It is from the provincial capital, Santa Cruz, from Manila, and from Lucena.

<text>James Elliott Williams (June 13, 1930 – October 13, 1999) was an American law enforcement officer and honorary United States Navy chief boatswain&#x27;s mate who was awarded the Medal of Honor during the Vietnam War. Boatswain&#x27;s Mate First Class Williams was one of 32 Native Americans to receive the medal and is considered to be the most decorated enlisted man in the history of the United States Navy. Williams completed his career as the United States Marshal for South Carolina.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Fort Mill, South Carolina, and moved two months later with his parents to Darlington, South Carolina where he spent his early childhood and youth. He attended the local schools and graduated from St. John&#x27;s high school. He claimed to be of Cherokee descent.

==Navy service==
Williams enlisted in the United States Navy on August 8, 1947, at the age of 17, and completed basic training at Naval Training Center San Diego. He served for almost twenty years, retiring on April 26, 1967, as a boatswain&#x27;s mate first class. During those years, he served in both the Korean War and Vietnam War. On May 14, 1968, Williams was presented the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon B. Johnson during the dedication ceremony of the &quot;Hall of Heroes&quot; in the Pentagon. In 1977, he received the honorary title of chief boatswain&#x27;s mate.

During the Korean War, Williams served aboard the destroyer from November 1950 to June 1952. He served off the coast of Korea. where he was detached off the destroyer to take raiding parties into North Korea on small boats from March to June 1952.

Petty Officer Williams served aboard from June 1960 through April 1963, reenlisting aboard &quot;Little Rock&quot; in April 1962.

In April 1966, with the enlisted rank of petty officer first class and the rating of boatswain&#x27;s mate 1st class (BM1), Williams was assigned in May to the River Patrol Force, River Squadron Five, in command of River Patrol Boat &quot;105&quot; (PBR-105). The force&#x27;s mission was to intercept Viet Cong and People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam arms shipments, supplies, and personnel on the waterways of South Vietnam&#x27;s Mekong Delta and to keep innocent boat traffic on the river and canals safe.

On October 31, 1966, Williams was commanding PBR &quot;105&quot; alongside another PBR searching for Viet Cong guerrillas operating in an isolated area of the Mekong Delta. Suddenly, Viet Cong manning two sampans opened fire on the Americans. While Williams and his men neutralized one sampan, the other one escaped into a nearby canal. The PBRs gave chase and soon found themselves in a beehive of enemy activity as the VC opened fire on them with rocket propelled grenades and small arms from fortified river bank positions.

Williams repeatedly led the PBRs against concentrations of enemy junks and sampans. He also called for support from two heavily armed UH-1B Huey helicopters of HA(L)-3. When that help arrived, he kicked off another attack in the failing light. As a result of the three-hour battle, the U.S. naval force killed 1,000 Viet Cong guerrillas, destroyed over fifty vessels, and disrupted a major enemy logistic operation. For his actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.

==Post-war==
After retiring from the Navy in April 1967, Williams worked for the Wackenhut Corporation. 

In 1969, he was appointed U.S. Marshal for the District of South Carolina, where he served until May 1977. He was then transferred to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, Glynco, Georgia, as an instructor and National Armorer. He was called back to South Carolina in July 1979 under court appointment as U.S. Marshal for South Carolina and served in that position until April 1980. He was then transferred to U.S. Marshals Service Headquarters, Washington, D. C., as Programs Manager, Health and Safety and In-District Training Officer where he served until his retirement from the U.S. Marshals Service with the grade of GS-1811-15.

==Personal life==
In 1949, Williams married the former Elaine Weaver and they had five children (daughter, Debbie, sons, James E. &quot;Jr.&quot;, Stephen Michael, Charles E., and daughter, Gail) and seven grandchildren.

==Death==
Williams died on October 13, 1999; he was buried at the Florence National Cemetery in Florence, South Carolina.

==Military awards==
Williams&#x27; decorations and awards include:
* 4 gold service stripes.

===Medal of Honor citation===

===Navy Cross citation===

===Silver Star citation===

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Boatswain&#x27;s Mate First Class James Elliott Williams (NSN: 9908934), United States Navy, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action on 22 August 1966, in connection with operations against the Viet Cong while serving as Patrol Officer for River Patrol Boats (PBR&#x27;s) 101 and 105, on the Mekong River in the Republic of Vietnam. During the early evening hours, Petty Officer Williams&#x27; patrol came under heavy enemy fire on four occasions from nearly one hundred Viet Cong gun emplacements on both banks of the river. He courageously directed suppressive fire against the enemy and neutralized a number of the automatic-weapons emplacements. During the height of the battle, Petty Officer Williams detected and intercepted a motorized sampan with two, high-ranking Viet Cong passengers. He directed PBR 101 to cover his south flank, while PBR 105 engaged the north bank and he salvaged the contents of the sampan. Although wounded in the face during the salvage operation, he courageously continued in complete command, directing suppressive fire while withdrawing with the sampan from the kill zone. Petty Officer Williams&#x27; aggressiveness and calmness under fire were an inspiration to all in his patrol. His determination and daring, despite overwhelming enemy fire, directly resulted in the capture of thirty-one Viet Cong top secret, twelve secret, and fifty-eight confidential documents. By his initiative and courageous actions, Petty Officer Williams upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

===Navy and Marine Corps Medal citation===

The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy and Marine Corps Medal to Boatswain&#x27;s Mate First Class James Elliott Williams (NSN: 9908934), United States Navy, for heroism at the risk of life not involving conflict with an armed enemy on 9 January 1967, while serving with River Patrol Section 531 and friendly foreign forces on the Mekong River in the Republic of Vietnam. As the Patrol Officer and Boat Captain of River Patrol Boat (PBR) 105 on combat patrol near My Tho when the dredge JAMAICA BAY was mined, Petty Officer Williams immediately directed his boat toward the rapidly sinking dredge and supervised his crew members in picking up two survivors from the dredge and five exhausted survivors attempting to swim in the rapidly ebbing tide current. After administering first aid, Petty Officer Williams maneuvered his boat to the sinking dredge where a metallic tapping was heard coming from within the hull. Fully aware of the dangers involved, he unhesitatingly plunged into the dark, debris-clogged river to effect the rescue of the trapped man. The man was guided to a hatch sixty feet away and four feet beneath the waterline where Petty Officer Williams repeatedly dived under the water to clear the hatch which was blocked by two pipes firmly wedged into place. Upon learning that little air remained in the heavily listing dredge, Petty Officer Williams called for a line and bent it around the pipes so that a tug could pull the obstructions free. He quickly swam through the hatch with his crewmember, located the victim, and pulled him back through the hatch to the surface, thus saving the man&#x27;s life. Petty Officer Williams&#x27; courageous, competent, and efficient actions and forceful leadership in directing the rescue effort, and in particular, in effecting the rescue of an elderly man trapped within the sinking dredge, at great risk to his own life, were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

==Other honors==

* Navy Special Boat Unit 20 headquarters at Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, Virginia, was dedicated the BM1 James E. Williams Building in 1997.
* Navy guided missile destroyer was named and christened in his honor on June 28, 2003, at Pascagoula, Mississippi.

<doc id="1274640" wikidata="Q1143604" url="?curid=1274640" title="Conference proceedings">
<text>In academia and librarianship, conference proceedings are a collection of academic papers published in the context of an academic conference or workshop. Conference proceedings typically contain the contributions made by researchers at the conference. They are the written record of the work that is presented to fellow researchers. In many fields, they are published as supplements to academic journals; in some, they are considered the main dissemination route; in others they may be considered grey literature. They are usually distributed in printed or electronic volumes, either before the conference opens or after it has closed.

A less common, broader meaning of proceedings are the acts and happenings of an academic field, a learned society. For example, the title of the &quot;Acta Crystallographica&quot; journals is Neo-Latin for &quot;Proceedings in Crystallography&quot;; the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&quot; is the main journal of that academy. Scientific journals whose ISO 4 title abbreviations start with &quot;Proc&quot;, &quot;Acta&quot;, or &quot;Trans&quot; are journals of the proceedings (transactions) of a field or of an organization concerned with it, in that secondary meaning of the word.

==Authorship and editorship==
Selecting and collecting papers for conferences is organized by one or more persons, who form the &quot;editorial team&quot;. The quality of the papers is typically ensured by having external people read the papers before they are accepted in the proceedings. The level of quality control varies considerably from conference to conference: some have only a binary accept/reject decision, others go through more thorough feedback and revisions cycles (peer reviewing or refereeing). Depending on the level of the conference, this process can take up to a year. The editors decide about the composition of the proceedings, the order of the papers, and produce the preface and possibly other pieces of text. Although most changes in papers occur on basis of consensus between editors and authors, editors can also single-handedly make changes in papers.

Since the collection of papers comes from individual researchers, the character of proceedings is distinctly different from an educational textbook. Each paper typically is quite isolated from the other papers in the proceedings. Mostly there is no general argument leading from one contribution to the next.

In some cases, the editors of the proceedings may decide to further develop the proceedings into a textbook. This may even be a goal at the outset of the conference.

==Publication==
Conference proceedings are published in-house by the organizing institution of the conference or via an academic publisher. For example, the &quot;Lecture Notes in Computer Science&quot; by Springer take much of their input from proceedings. Conference proceedings also get published through dedicated proceedings series as an edited volume where all their inputs comes from the conference papers. For example, AIJR Proceedings series published by academic publisher AIJR. Publication of proceedings as edited volume in such series are different from publishing conference paper in the journals; also known as conference issue. Increasingly, proceedings are published in electronic format via the internet or on CD, USB, etc.

In the sciences, the quality of publications in conference proceedings is usually not as high as that of international scientific journals. However, in computer science, papers published in conference proceedings are accorded a higher status than in other fields, due to the fast-moving nature of the field.

A number of full-fledged academic journals unconnected to particular conferences also use the word &quot;proceedings&quot; as part of their name, for example, &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&quot;.

==Format==
Conference proceedings may be published as a book or book series, in a journal, or otherwise as a serial publication (see examples). In many cases, impact factors are not available, although other journal metrics (such as Google Scholar h-index and Scimago-metrics) might exist. Bibliographic indexing often is done in separate bibliographic databases and citation indexes, e.g., Conference Proceedings Citation Index instead of Science Citation Index.

<text>Thérèse Schwartze (20 December 185123 December 1918) was a Dutch portrait painter.

==Life==

Thérèse Schwartze was born on 20 December 1851 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. She was the daughter of the painter Johan Georg Schwartze, who grew up in Philadelphia and trained in Düsseldorf.

Schwartze received her first training from her father, before studying for a year at the Rijksacademie van Beeldende Kunsten. She then travelled to Munich and studied under Gabriel Max and Franz von Lenbach. In 1879 she went to Paris to continue her studies under Jean-Jacques Henner. When she returned to Amsterdam she became a member of Arti et Amicitiae. Schwartze exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.

==Death==
On 22 July 1918 her husband, Anton van Duyl, died. As Schwartze was in bad health at that time (and tried to hide this), the death of her husband was a blow that she could not overcome easily. She died in Amsterdam on 23 December 1918 from a sudden illness.

Schwartze was buried at Zorgvlied cemetery in Amsterdam. Later she was reburied at the Nieuwe Ooster cemetery in Amsterdam, where her sister created a memorial to her, modelled after her death mask, which is now a rijksmonument.

==Works==
Her portraits, mostly of Amsterdam&#x27;s elite, are remarkable for excellent character drawing, breadth and vigour of handling and rich quality of pigment. She signed her works &quot;Th. Schwartze&quot; and was married late in life in 1906 to Anton van Duyl, whereupon she signed works with &quot;Th. v Duyl.Schwartze&quot;.

She was one of the few women painters who had been honoured by an invitation to contribute their portraits to the hall of painters at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Some of her best pictures, notably a portrait of Piet J Joubert, and &quot;Three Inmates of the Orphanage at Amsterdam,&quot; are at the Rijksmuseum, and one entitled &quot;Five Amsterdam Orphans&quot; at the Boijmans Van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam.

Her niece Lizzy Ansingh, who she painted a few times, also became a painter. Her sister Georgine Schwartze became a sculptor. She lived with her extended family at Prinsengracht 1901 in Amsterdam and painted her housemates in 1915:

<doc id="1274646" wikidata="Q6385662" url="?curid=1274646" title="Kellenberg Memorial High School">
<text>Kellenberg Memorial High School is a Roman Catholic college-preparatory school in Uniondale, New York, on Long Island, United States. Kellenberg Memorial is a Marianist school on Long Island, alongside St. Martin de Porres Marianist School in Uniondale and Chaminade High School in Mineola, New York.

==History==

Kellenberg Memorial High School is named in honor of Most Rev. Walter P. Kellenberg, founding Bishop of the Diocese of Rockville Centre. In the 1960s, Kellenberg commissioned the construction of four diocesan high schools, including Maria Regina in Uniondale. Due to declining enrollment and a lack of low-cost priests and nuns to teach in these schools, Bishop McGann closed Maria Regina, but in the face of parental protests, the school was acquired by the Marianist brothers who were already running Chaminade High School in nearby Mineola, and was reopened as Kellenberg Memorial in 1987.

In September, 1987, the administration of Kellenberg Memorial High School announced the establishment of the Bro. Joseph C. Fox Latin School. The Latin School is named in honor of Marianist brother Bro. Joseph C. Fox, who taught for over fifty years in Catholic schools. This new division of KMHS provides a qualitative Catholic education to students from the public schools in grades six through eight.

==Campus==
Kellenberg is accessed through the main entrance across from RXR Plaza on Glenn Curtiss Blvd. Although the lobby was originally designed as the main entrance, the school is oriented toward its north entrance, which features a mural of the Holy Family designed by artist Yan Rieger in 1997 in honor of the school&#x27;s tenth anniversary. The mural includes a depiction of Jesus when he was young. Students and Marianists assisted the artist and his wife with the execution of the mural.

Kellenberg Memorial has five athletic fields, four of which are named after the Four Evangelists. The fields are used for baseball, football, softball, and other sports. The school is also the caretaker of two Nassau County properties, one of which is located east of the school and one located west, which are also used for athletics. These properties are named Jerusalem and Jericho, after the two biblical cities. An artificial turf field was installed during the summer of 2010. This marks a series of campus improvements and expansions that was to take place throughout 2010 and 2011.

Kellenberg&#x27;s campus features three courtyards and four chapels. The main courtyard is located in the center of the building and contains a koi river, four bridges, and a central bell tower. Many interior classrooms overlook this courtyard, and students are permitted to pass through the courtyard between classes.

==Academics==

Kellenberg Memorial High School offers a rigorous college preparatory curriculum. Core liberal arts courses are supplemented with required courses in chorus, health, computer technology, music and art. Students in the Latin School are required to take Latin.

Admission to the school is highly competitive, with many applicants enrolling in private exam preparation courses for the Catholic High School Entrance Exam (CHSEE/TACHS) in general and Kellenberg in particular.

==Latin School==
The school also operates the Brother Joseph C. Fox Latin School on the same campus as the high school. Serving students from grades 6 through 8, it was originally designed for students who started in public school but wished to transfer into the Catholic school system; it now accepts students from both public and Catholic elementary schools.

Admission to the program is highly competitive, with many applying over a year in advance. The nature of the program allows middle school students to take courses taught by high school teachers (often with high school material) and to take part in clubs, activities and services that would normally not be available at a regular middle school. Students in grades 7 and 8 are required to take Latin, with those who remain at Kellenberg for high school placed in accelerated classes. Students who graduate from the program are guaranteed admission to the high school; however, they are required to take the CHSEE for statistical and quality-assurance purposes.

While the Latin School has a separate administration for academics, guidance and discipline, the schools are otherwise administered as one unit, sharing facilities and faculty. Most clubs and activities are run as one unit for grades 6–12. The administration of the Latin School is subsidiary to that of the greater school, with the Assistant Principal for the Latin School answerable to the Principal and President of Kellenberg Memorial High School.

==Faculty==
As of April 2010, the faculty included 130 members, including three Marianist Priests and 12 Marianist Brothers. Many school administrators maintain teaching roles in the school. There is also a large school staff body consisting of about 70 members. Many members of the Society of Mary have canine companions that often follow them to the classroom or reside in their offices during the day, sometimes cited as a very likable trait of the school. Many of the faculty and school staff are alumni.

Administrators have contributed articles to a diverse range of publications, from the religious &quot;Catalyst&quot; to the mainstream &quot;New York Times&quot;. Current faculty include college faculty, published authors and professional musicians. Former faculty members contributed to works still included in the school&#x27;s curriculum, from history classes to faith-based clubs. Music produced by student organizations is sold at online music retailers.

==Co-curricular and extracurricular activities==
In the Marianist tradition, many students join sodality groups to mutually reinforce their Catholic faith. The groups meet weekly and participate in various religious activities. The school also operates Emmanuel, a Marianist Retreat House devoted to students&#x27; spiritual formation.

A major co-curricular focus is music. Activities in this area include Band (four levels), Chorus (four levels), Guitar Club, Jazz Band, the Firebird Swing Jazz Choir, Orchestra, Pit Band, and Jubilee Choir, Gregorian Consortium (sometimes called St. Greg&#x27;s).

Publications include &quot;Blue and Gold&quot; (a yearbook), &quot;The Renaissance&quot; (a literary magazine), &quot;The Phoenix&quot; (a newspaper), and the &quot;Blue Blazer Newsletter&quot; (a digital newspaper).

Kellenberg also has an Academic Quiz Bowl team and a Science Olympiad team. The Academic Quiz Bowl team came in 11th place at the 2008 NAQT High School National Championship, and placed second in the 2010 season of the New York area TV show &quot;The Challenge&quot;. The team won the 2009 New York State NAQT tournament, placing first in the state with the JV team in fifth; at the state level, three of the top five players came from Kellenberg teams. The Science Olympiad team has qualified for the New York State Science Olympiad Competition several times in recent years.

A major activity for female students at Kellenberg is the annual Blue and Gold show. Students who participate are divided into two teams, a blue team and a gold team. The girls practice from February until May. The competition takes place on one night in May, and attracts a widespread Long Island audience.

In 2006, the school received national attention when the principal, Kenneth Hoagland, canceled the Senior Prom. In a letter from late March 2006, he cited &quot;booze cruises&quot; sponsored by parents, cocktail parties, and the film &quot;American Pie&quot; as examples of &quot;adolescent culture being formed and led by the media&quot;. The school received national attention from ABC, CNN, Fox News, MTV, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;.

In 2018, the school reestablished the varsity ice hockey program, as well as established a varsity crew program for both boys and girls. In 2019, a junior varsity ice hockey team was added.

<doc id="1274648" wikidata="Q1503662" url="?curid=1274648" title="Basic (dance move)">
<text>The basic step, basic figure, basic movement, basic pattern, or simply basic is the dance move that defines the character of a particular dance. It sets the rhythm of the dance; it is the default move to which a dancer returns, when not performing any other moves. More formally, it can be defined as a &quot;rhythmic step pattern&quot; in the form of a &quot;consistent and recurring grouping of weight changes&quot; between the feet (as well as certain moves that do not involve complete changes of weight, as when one taps, kicks, or points a foot) which is rhythmic and repeated for the length of a song. For some dances it is sufficient to know the basic step performed in different handholds and dance positions to enjoy it socially.

Most traditional partner dances have only one basic step which can be easily mastered. Others, such as West Coast Swing, have multiple basic steps, any of which can theoretically be selected by the leader.

== Examples ==
* Box step, the basic move in some American style ballroom dances: rumba and arguably waltz and bronze-level foxtrot.
* Cha-cha-cha. There are several variants of the basic movement in cha-cha-cha: basic, open basic, basic in place.
* Lindy basic in lindy hop
* Mambo basic in mambo
* Salsa basic in salsa
* Zydeco basic in zydeco

<doc id="1274662" wikidata="Q11607" url="?curid=1274662" title="Jon Huntsman Jr.">
<text>Jon Meade Huntsman Jr. (born March 26, 1960) is an American politician, businessman, and diplomat who served as the 16th governor of Utah from 2005 to 2009. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the ambassador of the United States to Russia from 2017 to 2019, ambassador to China from 2009 to 2011, and ambassador to Singapore from 1992 to 1993.

Huntsman served in every presidential administration from the presidency of Ronald Reagan to the first Donald Trump administration. He began his career as a White House staff assistant for Ronald Reagan, and was appointed deputy assistant secretary of commerce and U.S. ambassador to Singapore by George H. W. Bush. Later as deputy U.S. trade representative under George W. Bush, he launched global trade negotiations in Doha in 2001 and guided the accession of China into the World Trade Organization. He was CEO of Huntsman Family Holdings, a private entity that held the stock the family owned in Huntsman Corporation. He was a board member of Huntsman Corporation, and as chair of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation. Huntsman is the only American ambassador to have served in both Russia and China, having been the U.S. ambassador to China under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011 and as the U.S. ambassador to Russia under Donald Trump from 2017 to 2019.

While governor of Utah, Huntsman was named chair of the Western Governors Association and joined the executive committee of the National Governors Association. Under his leadership, Utah was named the best-managed state in America by the Pew Center on the States. During his tenure, Huntsman was one of the most popular governors in the country, and won reelection in a landslide in 2008, winning every single county. He left office with approval ratings over 80 percent and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Gary Herbert. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination. He ran for governor again in 2020, but narrowly lost in the Republican primary to Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox.

Huntsman is a No Labels National Co-chair, and in July 2023, appeared with US senator Joe Manchin as headliners for a No Labels Common Sense Agenda Town Hall in Manchester, New Hampshire. Huntsman is a member of the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee.

==Early life and education==
Huntsman was born March 26, 1960, in Redwood City, California. His father, Jon Huntsman Sr., was a business executive who later became a billionaire through the company he founded, the Huntsman Corporation, which achieved breakthrough success in the 1970s manufacturing generic styrofoam cartons for McDonald&#x27;s and other fast food companies and by the 1990s was one of the largest petrochemical companies in the United States. His mother is Karen (&quot;née&quot; Haight) Huntsman, daughter of David B. Haight, an apostle in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Through his father, Huntsman is the great-great-great-grandson of early LDS Church leader Parley P. Pratt.

In 1975, Huntsman earned the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest rank of the Boy Scouts of America. He attended Highland High School in Salt Lake City but dropped out before graduating to perform as a keyboard player in a rock band. Huntsman later obtained a G.E.D. and enrolled at the University of Utah, where he became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity like his father. Jon Huntsman Jr. served as a missionary for the LDS Church in Taiwan for two years and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, graduating with a bachelor of arts in international politics in 1987.

==Political career==
While Huntsman was visiting the White House in 1971 during his father&#x27;s service as special assistant to U.S. president Richard Nixon, Henry Kissinger confided to the eleven-year-old that he was secretly traveling to China. Jon Huntsman Jr. worked as a White House staff assistant in Reagan administration in 1983. From 1987 to 1988, Huntsman and his family lived and worked in Taipei, Taiwan.

Huntsman and Enid Greene Mickelsen were co-directors of Reagan&#x27;s campaign in Utah. During the 1988 presidential election, he was a state delegate at the 1988 Republican National Convention.

===George H. W. Bush administration===
Under President George H. W. Bush, Huntsman was deputy assistant secretary in the International Trade Administration from 1989 to 1990. He served as deputy assistant secretary of commerce for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, from 1990 to 1991.

In June 1992, Bush appointed Huntsman as U.S. ambassador to Singapore, and he was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate in August. At 32 years old, he became the youngest U.S. Ambassador to serve in over 100 years.

===George W. Bush administration===
In January 2001, after George W. Bush took office as president, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported there was a strong possibility Huntsman would be appointed to be the new U.S. ambassador to China. In March, Huntsman reportedly turned down the nomination to be the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia. On March 28, Bush appointed Huntsman to be one of two Deputy United States trade representatives in his administration; he served in this role from 2001 to 2003.

===Governor of Utah===

In March 2003, Huntsman resigned his post in the Bush administration. In mid-August, three-term incumbent governor Mike Leavitt, who Huntsman strongly supported, decided not to run for re-election in order to become EPA administrator in the Bush administration. Shortly thereafter, Huntsman filed papers to run for Governor of Utah. In the June 2004 Republican primary, Huntsman defeated State Representative Nolan Karras 66–34%. In November 2004, Huntsman was elected with 58% of the vote, defeating Democratic Party nominee Scott Matheson Jr. In 2008, Huntsman won re-election with 77.7% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Bob Springmeyer.

Huntsman maintained high approval ratings as governor of Utah, reaching 90% approval at times. He left office with his approval ratings over 80%. Utah was named the best managed state by the Pew Center on the States. Following his term as governor, Utah was also named a top-three state to do business in. The 2006 Cato Institute evaluation gave Huntsman an overall fiscal policy grade of &quot;B&quot;; the institute gave him an &quot;A&quot; on tax policy and an &quot;F&quot; on spending policy.

Depending on the methodology used, Utah was either the top-ranked state or fourth-ranked state in the nation for job growth during Huntsman&#x27;s tenure, with a rate of either 5.9% or 4.8% between 2005 and 2009.

The Utah Taxpayers Association estimates that &quot;tax cuts from 2005 to 2007 totaled $407 million.&quot; Huntsman proposed eliminating the corporate franchise tax for small businesses making less than $5 million. During his term as governor, he was successful in having Utah replace its progressive income tax with a top rate of 7%, with a flat tax of 5%; cut the statewide sales tax rate from 4.75% to 4.65% and sales tax on unprepared food from 4.70% to 1.75%; and raise motor vehicle registration fees. He proposed a 400% increase in cigarette taxes, but the measure was never signed into law. In 2008, he successively proposed tax credits for families purchasing their own health insurance, as well as income tax credits for capital gains and solar projects.

During Huntsman&#x27;s administration, the state budget rose from $8.28 to 11.57 billion.

Huntsman supported cap and trade policies, and as governor, signed the Western Climate Initiative. He also supported an increase in the federal minimum wage. He also cut some regulations, including Utah&#x27;s very strict alcohol laws. In 2007, he signed into law the Parent Choice in Education Act, which he said was &quot;the largest school-voucher bill to date in the United States. This massive school-choice program provides scholarships ranging from $500 to $3000 to help parents send their children to the private school of their choice. The program was open to all current public school children, as well as some children already in private school.&quot; The voucher law was later repealed in a public referendum.

Huntsman was one of John McCain&#x27;s earliest supporters in his 2008 presidential campaign. Huntsman helped McCain campaign in New Hampshire and other early primary states and went with him to Iraq twice including over Thanksgiving in 2007. At the 2008 Republican National Convention, Huntsman delivered a nominating speech for Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, the party&#x27;s nominee for vice president. Huntsman also helped raise more than $500,000 for McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign. Speaking about McCain&#x27;s loss, Huntsman later observed, &quot;We&#x27;re fundamentally staring down a demographic shift that we&#x27;ve never seen before in America&quot;.

===Ambassador to China===
President Barack Obama nominated Jon Huntsman to serve as the United States Ambassador to China on May 16, 2009, noting his experience in the region and proficiency in Mandarin Chinese. His nomination was formally delivered to the Senate on July 6, 2009, and on July 23, 2009, he appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which favorably reported his nomination to the full Senate on August 4, 2009. On August 7, 2009, the Senate unanimously confirmed Huntsman and he formally resigned as governor of Utah and was sworn in as ambassador to China on August 11, 2009. Huntsman arrived in Beijing on August 21, 2009, to begin his assignment, and he delivered his first press conference on August 22 after a meeting with Commerce Minister Chen Deming.

In February 2011, Huntsman made a controversial appearance at the site of a planned pro-democracy protest in Beijing. The spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in China stated that Huntsman had been unaware of the planned protest, and happened to be strolling through the area on a family outing.

Huntsman resigned from his position as ambassador, effective April 30, 2011, in order to return to the United States to explore a 2012 presidential bid.

===2012 presidential campaign===

====Background====
Huntsman&#x27;s name appeared on lists of potential Republican nominees for the 2012 presidential election as early as 2008 and 2009, and John McCain specifically mentioned Huntsman as a potential candidate for the 2012 election in March 2009.

In August 2010, a group of political strategists close to Huntsman formed a political action committee called Horizon PAC. On February 22, 2011, Horizon PAC launched its official website, stating that it &quot;supports free-market values, principled leadership and a commitment to long-term solutions&quot;.

====Campaign====
On January 31, 2011, Huntsman submitted his formal resignation from his post as U.S. Ambassador to China effective April 30, 2011, indicating his plans to return to the United States at that time. Huntsman&#x27;s associates indicated that he was likely to explore a 2012 Republican presidential bid.

On May 3, 2011, he formed an official fundraising political action committee, building on the efforts of the previously established Horizon PAC. On May 18, 2011, Huntsman opened his 2012 national campaign headquarters in Orlando, Florida. Huntsman formally entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination on June 21, 2011, announcing his bid in a speech at Liberty State Park in New Jersey, with the Statue of Liberty in the background—the same site where Ronald Reagan launched his campaign in 1980.

Huntsman sought to establish himself as an anti-negative candidate and take the &quot;high road&quot;. In his announcement, he also stated &quot;I don&#x27;t think you need to run down someone&#x27;s reputation in order to run for the office of President.&quot;

Huntsman focused his energy and resources on the New Hampshire primary. On October 18, 2011, he boycotted the Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, out of deference to New Hampshire, which was locked in a political scheduling fight with Nevada. Huntsman eventually finished third in New Hampshire, and announced the end of his campaign on January 16, 2012. He endorsed Mitt Romney at that time.

===Post-campaign politics===

A month after dropping out of the 2012 race, Huntsman suggested there was a need for a third party in the United States, stating that &quot;the real issues [were] not being addressed, and it&#x27;s time that we put forward an alternative vision.&quot; Huntsman said that he would not run as a third-party presidential candidate in 2012. In early July, Huntsman announced that he would not be attending the 2012 Republican National Convention for the first time since he attended as a Reagan delegate in 1984; he stated he would &quot;not be attending this year&#x27;s convention, nor any Republican convention in the future until the party focuses on a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States—a future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.&quot;

Shortly after Obama&#x27;s re-election, Obama&#x27;s campaign manager Jim Messina admitted that the Obama campaign believed Huntsman would have been a particularly difficult candidate to defeat in the general election. Messina said that the campaign was &quot;honest about our concerns about Huntsman&quot; and that Huntsman &quot;would have been a very tough candidate&quot;.

In January 2014, Huntsman was named chairman of the Atlanticist think-tank the Atlantic Council. Huntsman indicated in an interview with Politico that he would not run in the 2016 presidential election.

In April 2016, Huntsman decided to endorse Republican nominee Donald Trump, but later retracted his endorsement of Trump following the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; controversy. However, Huntsman later defended Trump in interviews with &quot;Fox News&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; after Trump received criticism for accepting a congratulatory phone call with the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen, during his transition process. Huntsman said the critics were overreacting to Trump&#x27;s decision to accept the phone call, and that Trump&#x27;s nontraditional style might be an opportunity for a shift in Asia relations in future talks with China.

In November 2016, Huntsman said he was considering a run for the U.S. Senate in 2018, though he ultimately chose not to run for the seat.

Huntsman was the co-chair of the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, along with Dennis C. Blair. The commission is an independent and bipartisan initiative from the public and private sectors. Its mission is to document and assess the extent of international intellectual property theft, particularly by China, and propose appropriate policy responses. According to the commission&#x27;s analysis, the U.S. has lost up to $600 billion in illicit technology transfers to China. According to Huntsman,

=== Ambassador to Russia ===
On December 3, 2016, the Associated Press reported Huntsman was being considered by Donald Trump and the Trump transition team as a possible choice for United States Secretary of State in 2017, although Rex Tillerson was chosen 10 days later.

On March 8, 2017, it was reported that Huntsman accepted a position as United States Ambassador to Russia. During his Senate confirmation hearings, he said, &quot;There is no question that the Russian Government interfered in the U.S. election&quot; in 2016. He also said the relationship between the two countries was &quot;among the most consequential and complex foreign policy challenges we face.&quot; Huntsman was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, via voice vote, on September 28, 2017.

During his time as ambassador, Huntsman reported having access to senior Russian officials, which he stated was not always the case during his ambassadorship to China. He also expressed a desire to avoid repeating past mistakes in the relationship, stating: &quot;In the years past, every new administration has tried to reset or redo of some sort.(...) Let&#x27;s not repeat the cycles of the past, because in every case,(...) those resets could not be sustained. Let&#x27;s not even begin with that thought in mind; no resets, no redos. Just take the relationship for what it is, clear-eyed and realistically.&quot;

Huntsman submitted his resignation as U.S. Ambassador to Russia to President Trump on August 6, 2019, with his resignation taking effect on October 3, 2019. After Huntsman left post, Bartle B. Gorman, deputy ambassador to Russia, served as the embassy&#x27;s Chargé d&#x27;Affaires (until the arrival of John J. Sullivan as new ambassador).

=== 2020 Utah gubernatorial campaign ===

After his resignation as U.S. ambassador to Russia in August 2019, many speculated that Huntsman was considering another run for Utah governor. An October 2019 poll of likely Utah voters showed Huntsman as a favorite among several potential gubernatorial candidates.

On November 14, 2019, Huntsman announced on KSL Radio that he would run for Governor of Utah in the 2020 election. In the six weeks between Huntsman&#x27;s announcement and the end of 2019, Huntsman&#x27;s campaign raised $520,000, and visited all 29 Utah counties.

His daughter, Abby Huntsman, announced in January 2020 that she would leave her position on &quot;The View&quot; to join his gubernatorial campaign as a senior advisor. On February 7, 2020, Huntsman announced that Provo city mayor Michelle Kaufusi would be his gubernatorial running mate. A poll taken among likely voters in February showed Huntsman leading the race with 32% support, while 31% remained undecided. However, Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox ultimately won the primary with 36.4% of the vote against Huntsman&#x27;s 34.6%, and went on to win the general election.

==Political positions==

Huntsman has been described as &quot;a conservative technocrat-optimist with moderate positions who was willing to work substantively with President Barack Obama&quot; and identifies himself as a center-right conservative.

During his first term as Utah governor, Huntsman listed economic development, healthcare reform, education, and energy security as his top priorities. He oversaw tax cuts and advocated reorganizing the way that services were distributed so that the government would not become overwhelmed by the state&#x27;s fast-growing population.

===Healthcare===
During his time as Utah governor, Huntsman proposed a plan to reform healthcare, mainly through the private sector, by using tax breaks and negotiation to keep prices down.

In 2007, when asked about a healthcare mandate, Huntsman said, &quot;I&#x27;m comfortable with a requirement–you can call it whatever you want, but at some point we&#x27;re going to have to get serious about how we deal with this issue&quot;. The healthcare plan that passed in Utah under Huntsman did not include a healthcare mandate.

===Fiscal policy===

In a 2008 evaluation of state governors&#x27; fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman&#x27;s conservative tax policies, ranking him in a tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code. However the report concluded that: &quot;Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure.&quot; He defines his taxation policy as &quot;business friendly&quot;.

As part of his presidential campaign Huntsman said &quot;our tax code has devolved into a maze of special-interest carve-outs, loopholes, and temporary provisions that cost taxpayers more than $400 billion a year to comply with&quot;. The candidate called for &quot;[getting] rid of all tax expenditures, all loopholes, all deductions, all subsidies. Use that to lower rates across the board. And do it on a revenue-neutral basis&quot;.

In addition, Huntsman has proposed reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%, eliminating corporate taxes on income earned overseas, and implementing a tax holiday to encourage corporations to return profits from offshore tax havens. He favored eliminating taxes on capital gains and dividends.

===Social issues===
As the governor of Utah, Huntsman signed several bills placing limits on abortion.

During the 2012 presidential race, and as governor of Utah, Huntsman supported civil unions for same-sex couples but not same-sex marriage.

In a February 2013 op-ed published in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, Huntsman updated his stance to one of support for same-sex marriage, stating: &quot;All Americans should be treated equally by the law, whether they marry in a church, another religious institution, or a town hall. This does not mean that any religious group would be forced by the state to recognize relationships that run counter to their conscience. Civil equality is compatible with, and indeed promotes, freedom of conscience.&quot; In 2013, Huntsman was a signatory to an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; case.

===Environment and energy===
In 2007, in response to the issue of global warming, Huntsman signed the Western Climate Initiative, by which Utah joined with other governments in agreeing to pursue targets for reduced production of greenhouse gases. He also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by Environmental Defense, in which he said, &quot;Now it&#x27;s time for Congress to act by capping greenhouse-gas pollution.&quot;

In 2011, in response to comments by Rick Perry and other Republican presidential candidates, Huntsman stated he &quot;believe[s] in evolution and trust[s] scientists&quot; on climate change. Commenting later on his statement, Huntsman remarked &quot;I felt that it was important to remind a lot of Republican voters who care and a lot of independent voters who care, that there is a candidate who does believe in science.&quot;

Huntsman has stated a preference for international cooperation in handling climate change, stating &quot;it&#x27;s a global issue. We can enact policies here [in the United States], but I wouldn&#x27;t want to unilaterally disarm as a country.&quot;

===Foreign policy===

Huntsman has repeatedly stated, &quot;We need to continue working closely with China to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program&quot;. He has also named Taiwan, human rights, and Tibet among the &quot;areas where we have differences with China&quot; and vowed &quot;robust engagement&quot; as ambassador. Huntsman, who lived in Taiwan as a Mormon missionary, said he felt &quot;personally invested in the peaceful resolution of cross-strait differences, in a way that respects the wishes of the people on both Taiwan and the mainland. In 2009, he said that then-current U.S. policy &quot;support[ed] this objective, and [he was] encouraged by the recent relaxing of cross-strait tensions.&quot;

During his 2020 gubernatorial campaign, and after serving as Ambassador to Russia, Huntsman stated that &quot;[the Russians] want to see us divided. They want to drive a wedge into politics... The American people do not understand the expertise at their disposal to divide us, to prey on our divisions. They take both sides of an issue to deepen the political divide. They are active during mass shootings. They are active during racial tension. They take advantage of us. We think it&#x27;s fellow Americans who are taking extreme positions sometimes. It&#x27;s not.&quot;

===Immigration===
In 2005, Huntsman signed a bill giving undocumented migrants access to &quot;driving-privilege cards&quot;, which allowed them to have driving privileges but unlike driver licenses, cannot be used for identification purposes. In a 2011 presidential debate, Huntsman defended the move, explaining that &quot;[illegal immigrants] were given a driver&#x27;s license before and they were using that for identification purposes. And I thought that was wrong. Instead we issued a driver privilege card, which in our state allowed our economy to continue to function. And it said in very bold letters, not to be used for identification purposes. It was a pragmatic local government driven fix and it proved that the Tenth Amendment works.&quot;

In June 2007, Huntsman joined other Western governors in urging the Senate to pass comprehensive immigration reform. As governor, Huntsman threatened to veto a measure repealing in-state college tuition for illegal immigrants.

Huntsman has stated support for a border fence, saying that, &quot;as an American, the thought of a fence to some extent repulses me ... but the situation is such that I don&#x27;t think we have a choice&quot;.

Huntsman supports granting more H-1B visas to foreigners. Huntsman also supported the DREAM Act, which proposed a path to citizenship for young people brought to the United States by their parents illegally.

==Business career==
From 1993 to 2001, Huntsman served as an executive for the Huntsman Corporation, chairman of the Huntsman Cancer Foundation, and CEO of Huntsman Family Holdings Company.

In January 2012, Huntsman Cancer Institute announced that Huntsman had been appointed to the position of chairman, replacing his father, who founded the institute.

Huntsman was appointed to the board of directors of the Ford Motor Co. in February 2012. The announcement quoted Ford&#x27;s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr., as praising Huntsman&#x27;s global knowledge and experience—especially in Asia—as well as his tenure as the governor of Utah. Huntsman was appointed to the board of Caterpillar Inc. in April 2012.

From 2014 to 2017, and again from September 2020, Huntsman served on the board of directors of Chevron Corporation.

Huntsman is a founding director of the Pacific Council on International Policy and has served on the boards of the Brookings Institution, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Asia Society in New York, and the National Bureau of Asian Research.

==Personal life==
Huntsman has eight brothers and sisters. He married activist Mary Kaye and they have seven children: daughters Mary Anne (b. 1985, who is married to Evan Morgan, son of CNN commentator Gloria Borger.), Abigail (b. 1986), Elizabeth (&quot;Liddy&quot;; b. 1988), Gracie Mei (b. 1999; adopted from China), and Asha Bharati (b. 2006; adopted from India) and sons Jon III (b. 1990), William (b. 1993), both of whom are graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy, and serving active duty assignments.

Huntsman is distantly related to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Their relationship has been reported to be one of rivalry. After a scandal erupted over the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Romney and Huntsman were both considered to take over the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the games. After intense lobbying, Romney was chosen, and the Huntsman family was reportedly &quot;livid&quot;. As Romney prepared his 2008 presidential run, he began consulting Huntsman on foreign policy and trade issues. Huntsman&#x27;s father signed on as a finance chair for Romney&#x27;s campaign, and it was expected that Huntsman would endorse Romney; instead, Huntsman backed John McCain and became one of the McCain campaign&#x27;s national co-chairs. Huntsman did endorse Romney in the 2012 election after dropping out.

Huntsman is a self-proclaimed fan of the progressive rock genre and played keyboards during high school in the band Wizard. Huntsman joined REO Speedwagon on the piano for two songs during their concert at the Utah State Fair in 2005. Huntsman is a fan of riding motocross, and he helped in pushing extreme sports and outdoor sports and tourism for the State of Utah.

Huntsman has been awarded eleven honorary doctorate degrees, including an honorary doctorate of public service from Snow College in 2005, an honorary doctorate of science from Westminster College in 2008, an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the University of Utah in 2010, an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010, and an honorary doctorate of law from Southern New Hampshire University in 2011. He also received honorary doctorates from the University of Washington, University of Arizona, Utah State University, and University of Wisconsin. He has been recognized as a Significant Sig by Sigma Chi.

In 2007 Huntsman was awarded the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award by the BSA. In October 2018, Huntsman was diagnosed with stage-1 melanoma and sought treatment at the Huntsman Cancer Institute. On June 10, 2020, Huntsman announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19.

===Religious views===
Huntsman is a member of the LDS Church and served a church mission to Taiwan. In an interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, he stated that he considers himself more spiritual than religious, and in December 2010, he told &quot;Newsweek&quot; that the LDS Church doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly on his spiritual life. In a May 2011 interview, Huntsman said &quot;I believe in God. I&#x27;m a good Christian. I&#x27;m very proud of my Mormon heritage. I am Mormon.&quot;

Huntsman rejects the notion that faith and evolution are mutually exclusive. He said, &quot;The minute that the Republican Party becomes . . . the anti-science party, we have a huge problem. We lose a whole lot of people who would otherwise allow us to win the election in 2012.&quot;

<text>Bais Yaakov (, also Beis Yaakov, Beit Yaakov, Beth Jacob or Beys Yankev; ) is a genericized name for full-time Haredi Jewish elementary and secondary schools for girls worldwide.

Bais Yaakov, started by Sarah Schenirer in post-World War I
Kraków, was at the time a revolutionary approach to Jewish women&#x27;s education. The schools have risen to prominence in Haredi communities within Orthodox Judaism, with branches located worldwide in every Jewish community with a significant population.

While many of these schools carry the Bais Yaakov name, they are not necessarily affiliated, though they may be for other reasons.

== History ==

The Bais Yaakov movement was started by seamstress Sarah Schenirer in 1917 in Kraków, Poland. The first school building survives as apartments, and is marked with a bronze plaque.

While boys attended cheder and Talmud Torah schools (and in some cases yeshivas), at that time, there was no formalized system of Jewish education for girls and young Jewish women.

Schenirer saw that there was a high rate of assimilation among girls due to the vast secular influences of the non-Jewish schools that the girls were then attending. Sarah Schenirer concluded that only providing young Jewish women with a thorough, school-based Jewish education would effectively combat this phenomenon. She started a school of her own, trained other women to teach, and set up similar schools in other cities throughout Europe.

She obtained the approval of Yisrael Meir Kagan (author of &quot;Chofetz Chaim&quot;), who issued a responsum holding that contemporary conditions required departing from traditional prohibitions on teaching women Torah and accepting the view that it was permitted. Following the Chofetz Chaim&#x27;s approbation, the Bais Yaakov Movement in Poland was taken under the wing of Agudath Israel. Additionally, Schenirer sought and received approbation from Hasidic rabbis as well, most notably the Belzer Rebbe and the Gerrer Rebbe. Judith Grunfeld was persuaded to assist Schenirer. The original Bais Yaakov was a seminary of sorts, intended to train girls to themselves become teachers and spread the Bais Yaakov movement. Grunfeld would lead the seminary from 1924 to 1929.

Girls who were taught in the Bais Yaakov movement used their education as psychological support to survive World War II and the Holocaust.

Besides elementary and high schools, there are also post-secondary schools in the Bais Yaakov system, usually referred to as &#x27;seminaries&#x27;. These run various courses, generally lasting between one and three years.

== Etymology ==
The name Bais Yaakov comes from a verse in the Book of Exodus in which the expression &quot;House of Jacob&quot; is understood by Jewish commentaries on the Bible to refer to the female segment of the Jewish nation: Moses is instructed to &quot;say to the &quot;house of Jacob&quot;, and tell the &quot;children of Israel&quot;&quot;, where the parallel expressions are interpreted as referring respectively to the female and male segments.

== Current ==

=== Educational approach ===
The educational policies of most Bais Yaakov schools worldwide is generally that of Haredi Judaism and the Agudath Israel movement. In accordance with the differences between the Israeli and Diaspora Haredi communities, there are slight variations in outlook and philosophy between Israeli, American, and European Bais Yaakov schools. Israeli Bais Yaakov schools tend to de-emphasize the secular content of the curriculum, whereas in North America and Europe, the girls frequently receive a more diverse secular education. Large cities may have several Bais Yaakov schools, each with small variations in philosophy, typically over the importance placed on secular studies and/or accommodations made to secular values.

Students are required to uphold a dress code or wear uniforms which conform to the rules of &quot;tznius&quot; (modesty). Uniforms differ from school to school, but typically consist of a long pleated skirt, oxford shirt, and sweater or sweatshirt.

The schools&#x27; primary purpose is to prepare students to be contributors to family and community, as good Jews, wives, professionals, and mothers.

Secular studies sometimes reflect government proficiency requirements in such subjects as math, science, literature, and history in their respective countries. But extracurricular activities have, since the movement&#x27;s earliest days, reflected a careful willingness to adopt and adapt secular practices that could enhance the educational experience, e.g., community theater, albeit tailored to Haredi values and mores.

=== Curriculum ===

Most non-Hasidic Bais Yaakov schools in America teach Judaic studies in the mornings and a college preparatory program of secular studies in the afternoons. Judaic studies usually include study of Chumash (Pentateuch), Nevi&#x27;im (Prophets), and other parts of the Hebrew Bible; and instruction in the Hebrew language, in Jewish history, and the study of practical &quot;halakha&quot; (Jewish law), sometimes directly from the text, and other times as a summary of classic &quot;halakha&quot; sources.

One of the tenets of Orthodox Judaism is that it is impossible to fully understand the written Torah without the Jewish commentaries; so, Bais Yaakov girls are taught the Tanakh through this approach. A major focus is on Rashi, considered the foremost Torah commentator.

The curriculum of Bais Yaakov differs from that of male-only yeshivas, where the core component of study is the Talmud. Girls in Bais Yaakov schools do not typically learn law from the text of the Talmud itself, but may study its non-legal portions of &quot;aggadah&quot; (homiletics). This contrasts with the approach of many Modern Orthodox Jewish day schools, which increasingly teach Talmud to women.

=== Locations ===

Branches exist in most North American cities with large populations of Orthodox Jews, including New York City, Boston, Montreal, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, St. Louis, Toronto, Lakewood, Passaic, Monsey.

Bais Yaakov-type schools exist in most Israeli cities, and are also found in major Jewish centers in Europe, such as London, Manchester, Antwerp, Paris, Aix-les-Bains and Moscow, and in several other Jewish centers around the world, including Johannesburg, Buenos Aires, São Paulo and Melbourne.

Pre-war locations included over 260 towns and cities in Poland, with its central teachers&#x27; seminary in Kraków.

== Hasidic schools ==

Schools for girls within the Hasidic world generally share much of the same values, outlook, methodology, and aims of the non-Hasidic Haredi schools. However, they may place a greater emphasis on the teachings of their individual Hasidic Rebbes, and the instruction of religious subjects may be conducted in Yiddish, which is still the home language for most Hasidic families in New York today.

In Israel, nearly all of the Haredi schools for girls operate within one of three educational systems; these schools utilize the Israeli Ministry of Education&#x27;s core curriculum, and most take the requisite Bagrut high school matriculation exams.

Schools for young Hasidic girls which are not part of the Bais Yaakov movement take names such as:
* Bais Rivkah, Bnos Menachem, Bnos Rabbeinu, Bais Chaya Mushka, or Bais Chana for the Chabad Lubavitch girls&#x27; schools.
* Bnos Zion for the Bobov girls&#x27; schools.
* Bnos Belz or Beis Malka for Belz girls&#x27; schools.
* Bnos Vizhnitz for Vizhnitz girls&#x27; schools.
* Bnos Frima for Munkacs
* Beis Rochel schools for girls of the Satmar community, as well as some girls&#x27; schools of related Hasidic groups (often of Hungarian background).
* Bnos Yaakov or Bnos Esther for Puppa Hasidim
These schools (excepting Chabad) follow a different curriculum of Judaic studies, which is less text-based, and more focused on practical knowledge, than the curriculum in other schools. Within their communities, these schools are usually referred to as offering education &quot;al pi taharas kodesh&quot;, roughly translating as &quot;holy, pure education&quot;.

Several Hasidic groups, also, extend their program to the &quot;Seminary&quot; level, where women train for two years to certify as teachers, in parallel with further Torah study.

<doc id="1274684" wikidata="Q241021" url="?curid=1274684" title="Montrouge">
<text>Montrouge () is a commune in the southern Parisian suburbs, located from the centre of Paris. It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe. After a long period of decline, the population has increased again in recent years.

==History==
The name &quot;Montrouge&quot; means Red Mountain - from &quot;mont&quot; (mountain) and &quot;rouge&quot; (red) - because of the reddish colour of the earth in this area.

The name of the community was first mentioned in monastery documents in 1194.

Throughout the Middle Ages, the hamlet was home to monasteries and a number of religious orders, while in the 15th century it became the site of quarries used for the reconstruction of Paris. The late sixteenth century saw the plain of Montrouge named &quot;reserve for royal hunts&quot;, and during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries it was known for its windmills, which have all now disappeared.

On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, most of the commune of Montrouge was annexed to Paris, forming what is now called Petit-Montrouge, in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. The remainder of Montrouge was preserved as an independent town.

In 1875, the town gained a few thousand square metres from the neighbouring communes of Châtillon and Bagneux (principally in the neighbourhood (&quot;le quartier&quot;) called Haut Mesnil).

On 8 January 2015, Municipal Police officer Clarissa Jean-Philippe was shot and killed in the commune, purportedly by Amedy Coulibaly. Coulibaly was reported to be an accomplice of Saïd and Chérif Kouachi, the suspected perpetrators of the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting. The next day, he was gunned down by police during a siege that left four hostages dead and several other people injured.

==Population==

==Economy==
Industrial development started in 1925 and soon, many printing factories were to be found in the town. Most of these have disappeared today. Since the early years of the twenty-first century, professional services and telecommunications have been the main business activities.

* Aeronautical and electronic engineering, Alstom, Schlumberger, Siemens AG, ST Microelectronics
* Banking, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank
* Telecommunications, Orange
* The Papier d&#x27;Arménie (lit. Armenian Paper)

==Public transport==

Montrouge is served by Mairie de Montrouge and Barbara stations on Paris Métro Line 4, and by Châtillon – Montrouge station on Paris Métro Line 13.

The Châtillon - Montrouge station is located at the border between the commune of Montrouge and the commune of Châtillon, on the Châtillon side of the border. The Barbara station is located at the border between the commune of Montrouge and the commune of Bagneux. The Mairie de Montrouge station opened in March 2013, with the further extension of Line 4 opening to Bagneux–Lucie Aubrac in January 2022.

Bus line 68 runs from Metro Châtillon Montrouge all the way up through Montparnasse, the Louvre, the Paris Opera and ends at the Place de Clichy, the site of the Moulin Rouge. Bus line 126 runs from Porte d&#x27;Orléans to Boulogne-Billancourt, while line 128 goes from the same place to Robinson RER station. Bus line 323 runs on the southern border of Montrouge on its way between Issy-les-Moulineaux and Ivry-sur-Seine. Several lines (187, 188, 197, 297) use the Route nationale 20 that crosses eastern Montrouge to reach southern parts of the Parisian agglomeration.

==The arts in Montrouge==
Montrouge was the home of a number of well-known twentieth century artists, listed below. Currently the town is also well known for two contemporary art exhibitions:
*The Montrouge Contemporary Art Show, which has existed for over 50 years
*The JCE, that is European Young Artists exhibition.

==Education==

<text>The Westminster Assembly of Divines was a council of divines (theologians) and members of the English Parliament appointed from 1643 to 1653 to restructure the Church of England. Several Scots also attended, and the Assembly&#x27;s work was adopted by the Church of Scotland. As many as 121 ministers were called to the Assembly, with nineteen others added later to replace those who did not attend or could no longer attend. It produced a new Form of Church Government, a Confession of Faith or statement of belief, two catechisms or manuals for religious instruction (Shorter and Larger), and a liturgical manual, the &quot;Directory for Public Worship&quot;, for the Churches of England and Scotland. The Confession and catechisms were adopted as doctrinal standards in the Church of Scotland and other Presbyterian churches, where they remain normative. Amended versions of the Confession were also adopted in Congregational and Baptist churches in England and New England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Confession became influential throughout the English-speaking world, but especially in American Protestant theology.

The Assembly was called by the Long Parliament before and during the beginning of the First English Civil War. The Long Parliament was influenced by Puritanism, a religious movement which sought further reform of the church. They were opposed to the religious policies of King Charles I and William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. As part of a military alliance with Scotland, Parliament agreed that the outcome of the Assembly would bring the English Church into closer conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Church was governed by a system of elected assemblies of elders called presbyterianism, rather than rule by bishops, called episcopalianism, which was used in the English church. Scottish commissioners attended and advised the Assembly as part of the agreement. Disagreements over church government caused open division in the Assembly, despite attempts to maintain unity. The party of divines who favoured presbyterianism was in the majority, but the congregationalist party, which held greater influence in the military, favoured autonomy for individual congregations rather than the subjection of congregations to regional and national assemblies entailed in presbyterianism. Parliament eventually adopted a presbyterian form of government but lacked the power to implement it. During the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, all of the documents of the Assembly were repudiated and episcopal church government was reinstated in England.

The Assembly worked in the Reformed Protestant theological tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly&#x27;s Confession is the first of the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life to Adam on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.

==Background==

Parliament called the Westminster Assembly during a time of increasing hostility between Charles I, monarch of England and Scotland, and the Puritans. Puritans could be distinguished by their insistence that worship practices be supported implicitly or explicitly by the Bible, while their opponents gave greater authority to traditional customs. They believed the Church of England, which had separated itself from the Roman Catholic Church during the English Reformation, was still too heavily influenced by Catholicism. They sought to rid the church and nation of any of these remaining influences. This included the Church&#x27;s episcopal polity, or rule by a hierarchy of bishops. Puritans, unlike separatists, did not leave the established church. Under Charles, the Puritans&#x27; opponents were placed in high positions of authority, most notably William Laud who was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633, even though these &quot;high churchmen&quot; were in the minority. Puritans were forced to keep their views private or face fines and imprisonment. Laud promoted advocates of Arminianism, a theological perspective opposed to the Reformed theology of the Puritans. Worship practices such as kneeling at communion, bowing at the name of Christ, and the placement of communion tables at the East end of churches were also reinstated. To the Puritans, these seemed to be a step in the direction of Catholicism.

There were also conflicts between the king and the Scots, whose church was ruled by a system known as presbyterianism, which features elected assemblies. James, Charles&#x27;s predecessor as King of Scotland, made it clear that he intended to impose elements of episcopal church government and the Book of Common Prayer on the Scots beginning in 1604. The Scots considered this a reversion to Roman Catholicism. Charles furthered English impositions on the Church of Scotland in 1636 and 1637. This led to the First Bishops&#x27; War between Charles and the Scots in 1639. Charles called what came to be known as the Short Parliament to raise funds for the war, but he soon dissolved it when it began voicing opposition to his policies. Following the Second Bishops&#x27; War with the Scots in 1640, Charles was forced to call another parliament to raise additional funds.

What came to be known as the Long Parliament also began to voice vague grievances against Charles, many of which were religious in nature. Parliament had many Puritans and Puritan-sympathizing members, who generally opposed the existing episcopal system, but there was little agreement over what shape the church should take. Later in 1640, the Root and Branch petition was presented to the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. It was signed by about 15,000 Londoners and called for total elimination of the episcopal system. Committees were organized in the House of Commons to enact religious reforms, leading to the imprisonment of Archbishop Laud and his supporters in the Tower of London as retaliation for their repression of Puritans. The Court of High Commission and the Star Chamber, courts which had inflicted severe punishments on Puritan dissenters, were also abolished.

==Calling the assembly==

The idea of a national assembly of theologians to advise Parliament on further church reforms was first presented to the House of Commons in 1641. Such a proposal was also included in the Grand Remonstrance, a list of grievances which Parliament presented to Charles on 1 December that year. Charles responded on 23 December that the church required no reforms. Undeterred, Parliament passed three bills in 1642 appointing an assembly and stipulating that its members would be chosen by Parliament. Charles, whose royal assent was required for the bills to become law, was only willing to consider such an assembly if the members were chosen by the clergy. This was the practice for selection of members of Convocation, the assembly of clergy of the Church of England.

Defying the king, between 12 February and 20 April 1642, each county delegation of England in the Commons chose two divines, in addition to two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University (Oxford and Cambridge). County delegations often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this way to ensure that their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament&#x27;s upper house, added another fourteen names on 14 May, to which the Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22 August, marking the beginning of the First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was serious about reforming the church and induce the Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament.
Parliament finally passed an ordinance to hold the assembly on its own authority without Charles&#x27;s assent on 12 June 1643. It named as many as 121 ministers and thirty non-voting parliamentary observers: twenty from the Commons, and ten from the House of Lords. The Assembly was almost entirely English; Parliament appointed Englishmen for the counties of Wales, but the French stranger churches (churches of Protestant refugees from Catholic France) sent two ministers in place of any from the Channel Islands. Many of the divines were internationally recognized scholars of the Bible, ancient languages, patristics, and scholastic theology. Many were also famous preachers. Most of these theologians had retained their positions in the Church during the tenure of William Laud. Some had been ejected from their churches or cited by ecclesiastical courts for their views. Some had fled to the Continent, and one to the American colonies. Nonetheless, they all considered themselves members of the Church of England and had received episcopal ordination. Most were conformists, meaning they agreed to follow the Act of Uniformity 1558 and the Book of Common Prayer.

The Assembly was strictly under the control of Parliament, and was only to debate topics which Parliament directed. Assembly members were not permitted to state their disagreements with majority opinions or share any information about the proceedings, except in writing to Parliament. Parliament chose William Twisse, an internationally respected theologian, to be the Assembly&#x27;s prolocutor or chairman. Due to Twisse&#x27;s ill health, Cornelius Burges, whom Parliament appointed as one of several assessors, served as prolocutor &quot;pro tempore&quot; for most of the Assembly. Twenty-two appointed members of the Assembly died before 1649, and they along with those who did not attend for other reasons were replaced by another nineteen members. Three non-voting scribes were also added in 1643.

==Revising the Thirty-Nine Articles==

The Assembly&#x27;s first meeting began with a sermon by William Twisse in the nave of Westminster Abbey on 1 July 1643. The nave was so full that the House of Commons had to send members ahead to secure seats. Following the sermon, the divines processed to the Henry VII Chapel, which would be their place of meeting until 2 October when they moved to the warmer and more private Jerusalem Chamber. After their initial meeting they adjourned for about a week, as Parliament had not yet given specific instructions.

On 6 July, they received a set of rules from Parliament and were ordered to examine the first ten of the Thirty-Nine Articles, the current doctrinal standard of the Church of England, and &quot;to free and vindicate the Doctrine of them from all Aspersions of false Interpretations&quot;. After a day of fasting, the Assembly took a vow, as directed by Parliament, to &quot;not maintain any thing in Matters of Doctrine, but what I think, in my conscience, to be truth&quot;. The divines organized themselves into three standing committees, though each committee was open to any member of the Assembly. The committees would be assigned topics and prepare propositions for debate in the full Assembly following each morning of committee meetings. In addition, over 200 &quot;ad hoc&quot; committees were appointed for tasks such as examination of candidate preachers, college fellows, and suspected heretics.

The Assembly resolved, after some debate, that all the doctrines of the Thirty-Nine articles would need to be proven from the Bible. Assembly members were prone to long speeches and they made slow progress, frustrating the leadership. The eighth of the Thirty-Nine Articles recommended the Apostles&#x27; Creed, Nicene Creed, and Athanasian Creed, considered to be basic statements of orthodoxy, to be received and believed. The Assembly was unable to resolve conflicts between those who would not be bound by creeds and those who wished to retain the existing language that the creeds be &quot;thoroughly received and believed&quot;. The &quot;excepters&quot;, who took the former position, argued that the articles only require the &quot;matter&quot; of the creeds be believed. On 25 August the article was put off until the rest of the articles could be dealt with. This early disagreement on fundamental issues revealed deep rifts between different factions of the assembly.

==Debating church government==
From the beginning of the First Civil War, the Long Parliament recognized that they would need assistance from the Scots. In return for a military alliance, the Scottish Parliament required the English to sign the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643, which stipulated that the English would bring their church into greater conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Parliament sent commissioners to London to represent Scotland&#x27;s interests to the English Parliament. Eleven of these, four theologians and seven members of Parliament, were also invited to the Assembly. The commissioners were given the opportunity to become full voting members of the Assembly but declined, preferring to maintain their independence as commissioners of their own nation and church. Samuel Rutherford, George Gillespie, and Alexander Henderson were the most outspoken of the commissioners.
On 12 October 1643, Parliament ordered the Assembly to cease work on the Thirty-Nine Articles and to begin to frame a common form of church government for the two nations. The Assembly would spend a quarter of its full sessions on the subject of church government. The majority of the Assembly members supported presbyterian polity, or church government by elected assemblies of lay and clerical representatives, though many were not dogmatically committed to it. Several members of this group, numbering about twenty and including William Twisse, favoured a &quot;primitive&quot; episcopacy, which would include elements of presbyterianism and a reduced role for bishops.

There were also several congregationalists, who favoured autonomy for individual local churches. Their most influential divines were Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye, Sidrach Simpson, Jeremiah Burroughs, and William Bridge. They were often called the &quot;dissenting brethren&quot; in the Assembly. They have sometimes been labelled &quot;Independents&quot;, but they rejected this term. The Assembly members for the most part reserved the label &quot;Independent&quot; for separatists who left the established church. The congregationalist divines cannot be equated with separatists and Brownists, as they had accepted episcopal ordination and remained in the Church of England. Their influence was assisted by the success of Oliver Cromwell and his New Model Army in the ongoing civil war. Cromwell and many others in the army supported congregationalism.

A third group of divines were known as Erastians, a term for those who believed that the state should have significant power over the church. The entire Assembly was Erastian in the sense that the body had been called by Parliament and was completely under state control. Those labelled &quot;Erastian&quot; at the Assembly believed the civil authority, rather than church officers, should hold the power of church discipline. This included the power to withhold communion from unrepentant sinners. They did not see any particular form of church government as divinely mandated, and because of this the dissenting brethren allied with them when it became clear that a presbyterian establishment would be much less tolerant of congregationalism than Parliament. There were only two divines at the Assembly who held the Erastian view, John Lightfoot and Thomas Coleman, but the presence of members of Parliament, especially John Selden, as well as the fact of parliamentary oversight of the Assembly, gave Erastian views disproportional influence.

Several episcopalians, supporters of the existing system of bishops, were also included in the summoning ordinance, but Parliament may have nominated them to lend greater legitimacy to the Assembly and not have expected them to attend because Charles had not approved of the Assembly. Only one, Daniel Featley, participated, and he only until his arrest for treason in October 1643.

Debate on church officers began on 19 October. The Assembly began with the issue of ordination, as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the sacraments without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.
On 3 or 4 January 1644, the five leading dissenting brethren signalled a break with the rest of the Assembly when they published &quot;An Apologeticall Narration&quot;, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the congregational system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw fellowship from aberrant congregations. By 17 January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated.

Despite these efforts, on 21 February it became clear just how fundamentally opposed the groups were. Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in the unity of the church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15 November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement with the rest of the Assembly to Parliament, and on 11 December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.

==Conflicts with Parliament==

Relations between the Assembly and Parliament were already deteriorating in 1644, when Parliament ignored the Assembly&#x27;s request that &quot;grossly ignorant and notoriously profane&quot; individuals be barred from communion. While members of Parliament agreed that the sacrament should be kept pure, many of them disagreed with the presbyterian majority in the Assembly over who had the final power of excommunication, taking the Erastian view that it was the state. Also, by 1646, Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s New Model Army had won the war on behalf of Parliament. Cromwell, along with a majority of the army, was strongly in favour of religious toleration for all sorts of Christians even if the national church was to be presbyterian. His rise to power as a result of his military victories made the idea of a strictly presbyterian settlement without freedom of worship for others very unlikely. Parliament at least wanted to know which sins in particular were grave enough to trigger excommunication by the church; the Assembly was reticent to provide such information, as the majority considered the power of the church in this area to be absolute.
In May 1645, Parliament passed an ordinance allowing excommunicants to appeal the church&#x27;s sentences to Parliament. Another ordinance on 20 October contained a list of sins to which the church would be limited in its power to excommunicate. To the majority of the divines&#x27; dismay, an even more Erastian ordinance was proposed in March 1646. The Assembly published a protest, provoking the Commons to charge it with breach of privilege and to submit nine questions to the divines on the matter. Votes were to be included with the answers, an attempt to force the divines associated with the protest petition to reveal themselves.

The Nine Queries, as they came to be called, focused on the divine right (&quot;jure divino&quot;) of church government. While the presbyterian divines were capable of defending their vision for church government as established by divine right in the Bible, they were unwilling to answer the queries because doing so would further expose the disunity of the Assembly and weaken their case in Parliament. In July 1647, the New Model Army invaded London and conservative members of Parliament were forced out. Parliament passed an ordinance establishing religious tolerance and ensuring that the Assembly&#x27;s vision of a national, compulsory presbyterian church would never come to fruition. In London, where support for presbyterianism was greatest, presbyteries were established in only sixty-four of 108 city parishes, and regional presbyterian classes were only formed in fourteen of England&#x27;s forty counties. A planned national general assembly never met. Many presbyterians did, however, establish voluntary presbyteries in what was a de facto free church situation until the Restoration in 1660, when a compulsory episcopal system was reinstated.

The new Form of Government was much more acceptable to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. They passed it on 10 February 1645, contingent on some particularities of presbyterian government which were expected to be worked out in a forthcoming Directory for Church Government. At the same time they announced their desire to formally unite the two churches. Following the rise of Cromwell and the secret Engagement of some Scots with Charles this hope was abandoned, and the documents were never formally adopted. The General Assembly ceased to function under Cromwell and the kings who succeeded him from 1649 to 1690.

==Confession, catechisms, and the &quot;Directory for Public Worship&quot;==
During and after the debates over church government, the Assembly framed other documents which did not cause open rifts. The &quot;Directory for Public Worship&quot;, which was to replace the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3 January 1645. The &quot;Directory&quot;, accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians for the most part preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The &quot;Directory&quot; consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.

A Confession of Faith to replace the Thirty-Nine Articles was begun in August 1646. While there is little record of the actions of the Assembly during the writing of the Confession, it is clear that there were significant debates in the Assembly over almost every doctrine found in it. The Confession was printed and sent to Parliament in December. The House of Commons requested scripture citations be added to the Confession, which were provided in April 1648. Parliament approved the Confession with revisions to the chapters on church censures, synods and councils, and marriage on 20 June 1648. The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland had already adopted the Confession without revision in 1647. The restoration of Charles II in 1660 effectively made this legislation a nullity.

The Assembly had already done significant work on a catechism between December 1643 and January 1647 containing fifty-five questions, before it decided to create two catechisms rather than one. The Larger Catechism was intended to assist ministers in teaching the Reformed faith to their congregations. The Shorter Catechism was based on the Larger Catechism but intended for use in teaching the faith to children. Parliament demanded scripture proofs for the catechisms as well. The Scots General Assembly approved both catechisms in 1648.

The Assembly understood its mandate under the Solemn League and Covenant to have been fulfilled on 14 April 1648 when it delivered the scripture citations to Parliament, and the Scottish Commissioners had already left by the end of 1647. The Assembly continued to meet primarily for the purpose of examination of ministers for ordination. Most of the divines were unhappy with the republican Commonwealth that emerged after Colonel Pride&#x27;s Purge of the Long Parliament in 1648. As a result, a majority stopped attending rather than agree to the oath of Engagement to the Commonwealth that was imposed in 1649. Newspapers continued to report on the meetings of the Assembly as late as March 1653. The Assembly must have stopped meeting sometime between then and Cromwell&#x27;s dissolution of the Rump Parliament on 20 April 1653.

==Theology==
The Assembly was a product of the British Reformed tradition, taking as a major source the Thirty-Nine Articles as well as the theology of James Ussher and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also considered themselves to be within the broader European Reformed tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental Reformed theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the Augustinian theological tradition exemplified by Anselm, Thomas Bradwardine, and John Wycliffe. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians.
The Confession starts with the doctrine of revelation, or how people can know about God. The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature as well as the Bible, but they also believed that the Bible, or Scripture, is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of God. The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time. Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew vowel points, marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation, of the Old Testament were probably not part of the original. This caused significant debate between Reformed polemicists and Roman Catholics. Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative magisterium to interpret the Bible as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of perspicuity, that the essential teachings of the Bible could be interpreted by anyone. English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine. The divines had a strong view of the inspiration of the Bible, and believed that God revealed himself in the propositions found in Scripture. While the issue of biblical inerrancy, the belief that there are no errors in the Bible, did not arise until the eighteenth century, the divines clearly did not believe the Bible to contain any errors. Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration, believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the Hebrew text were inspired by God. On the other hand, they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles. They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration.

Puritans believed that God is sovereign over all of history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated. There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God&#x27;s decree of predestination to the redemption purchased by Christ&#x27;s death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved, a doctrine called particular redemption. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical universalism. Edmund Calamy held such a view, and he argued that Christ&#x27;s death, as well as saving those who had been chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe. The Assembly&#x27;s Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession&#x27;s language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation.

Covenant theology is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly developed during the seventeenth century. Under this scheme, as articulated by the Assembly, God&#x27;s dealings with men are described in terms of two covenants: the covenant of works and covenant of grace. The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works (sometimes called the covenant of life), in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience. In the fall of man, Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To remedy this, God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace. This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God&#x27;s law perfectly. The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology. The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people.

The divines associated William Laud and his followers with Catholicism, which they were even more strongly opposed to. Before the civil war, the divines saw these two groups as the greatest threat to the church. With the rise of radical sectarian movements during the war, the divines became much more concerned with these groups than polemics against Catholicism. The divines were particularly concerned with those they labeled antinomians. This was a loose term for those who saw the moral law as no longer relevant for Christians. The divines saw these groups as more immediately threatening than Catholicism.

==Legacy==
The work of the Westminster Assembly was repudiated by the Church of England during the Restoration in 1660. The Act of Uniformity 1662, a law requiring even greater adherence to the Book of Common Prayer and support for episcopalianism than had previously been required, forced Puritan ministers to leave the Church. Though some presbyterians continued to desire to be readmitted to the established church, restrictions on worship for non-conformists led to presbyterians putting aside differences with congregationalists and adopting congregational church orders.

The Civil War brought with it the end of the consensus among English Protestants that there should be a single church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism, the doctrine that the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly&#x27;s debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.
The Confession produced by the Assembly was adopted with amendments by Congregationalists in England in the form of the 1658 Savoy Declaration, as well as by Particular Baptists in the form of the 1689 Baptist Confession. When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland was reestablished in 1690 following the Glorious Revolution, it ratified the Westminster Confession, but not any other document produced at Westminster. The Confession remains, according to the 1929 Declaratory Articles, the Church of Scotland&#x27;s &quot;principal subordinate standard&quot;, subordinate to the Bible. Memorization of the Shorter Catechism has been made a requirement for children in many Presbyterian churches.

The migrations and missionary efforts of each of these groups lead to the widespread significance of the Westminster Assembly throughout the English-speaking world. The Assembly&#x27;s Confession was particularly influential in American Protestant theology. It was included with congregationalist changes as part of the 1648 Cambridge Platform, a statement produced by ministers of colonial Massachusetts and the surrounding region, and again in colonial Connecticut as part of the 1708 Saybrook Platform. The Confession was modified for American Baptists in the 1707 Philadelphia Confession. The Adopting Act of 1729 required American Presbyterians to agree to the theology of the Assembly&#x27;s Confession, and the Confession remains a part of the Presbyterian Church (USA)&#x27;s &quot;Book of Confessions&quot;. The Confession has been called &quot;by far the most influential doctrinal symbol in American Protestant history&quot; by the historian of religion Sydney E. Ahlstrom.

<text>Mrs. Emily Pollifax is the heroine of a series of spy-mystery novels by Dorothy Gilman. 

==Character overview==
Mrs. Pollifax is a widow and senior citizen who decides one day to leave her comfortable apartment in New Brunswick, New Jersey and join the CIA. Through an initial misunderstanding, Mrs. Pollifax is given what is supposed to be a simple courier assignment by Operations Chief, Mr. Carstairs, and her ensuing adventure leads her to a career in espionage.

The Emily Pollifax novels frequently employ comic relief and suspense. A consistent theme throughout the series is Mrs. Pollifax&#x27;s tendency to take an interest in people who seem disconnected with her mission, but who either become part of the investigation and/or who prove to be of invaluable assistance to resolving the case.

Recurring characters include Bishop, Carstairs&#x27; assistant; John Sebastian Farrell, an agent turned art dealer; and in later books, Cyrus Reed, a man with whom Mrs. Pollifax finds romance in the book &quot;Mrs. Pollifax on Safari&quot;.

Most of the novels take place in existing countries and include authentic details; however, characters in the stories sometimes originate from fictional places that resemble groups of real-life countries. An example of this trait is evidenced by a character in &quot;A Palm for Mrs. Pollifax&quot; who is from Zabya, a fictional Middle Eastern monarchy described as one of &quot;those Arabian oil-producing countries.&quot; In addition, as is common in the spy fiction genre, (not least books written in the 1970s, which the Mrs. Pollifax series was) many of the stories taking place in the Cold War era are set in Iron Curtain countries or include rival spies from communist countries.

==Books in the Mrs. Pollifax series==

===&quot;The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax&quot; (1966)===

Mrs. Pollifax is an elderly widow who has come to find life dull and is almost ready to end it all because she no longer feels needed - not by her family, not by her community. Inspired by a newspaper profile of an actress who began her career in later life, she decides to fulfill a childhood ambition and apply for a job as a spy at the CIA. Meanwhile, Carstairs at the CIA is looking for an agent who can pass as a tourist in order to pick up an important package in Mexico. Due to a slight confusion, he thinks Mrs. Pollifax is one of the candidates and decides that Mrs. Pollifax is ideal; Carstairs decided this assignment carries so little danger that even one who is relatively untrained may be sent. So with minimum explanation, Pollifax is ushered off to Mexico City to meet a bookstore owner/secret agent, exchange code phrases, and leave with the package. The courier mission does not go as planned, and Mrs. Pollifax finds herself imprisoned in the Socialist Republic of Albania, facing harsh questioning and possible torture. But she proves to be unusually resourceful, and with her companion&#x27;s assistance, manages to outwit the enemy and save the day.

===&quot;The Amazing Mrs. Pollifax&quot; (1970)===
For this novel, Mrs. Pollifax is tasked by Mr. Carstairs, her CIA superior, to go to Turkey and contact Magda Ferenci-Sabo, a known Russian spy and secret double agent who is defecting to the Free World. Emily Pollifax is to give Magda money and a passport which will enable the former spy to leave Turkey. Although Carstairs gives Mrs. Pollifax only 30 minutes to get ready, the plucky widow is ready for another adventure. She flies to Turkey and sees Magda, but is unable to make personal contact before Magda flees. In pursuing her mission, Mrs. Pollifax embarks on a wild ride, matching wits with a diabolical double agent, traveling with Gypsies, and again surviving imprisonment. However, characteristically, she befriends unlikely allies along her way.

===&quot;The Elusive Mrs. Pollifax&quot; (1971)===
Mrs. Pollifax is sent, as a tourist, on a routine assignment, to deliver the eight forged passports she is carrying, concealed in her hat, to the Bulgarian Underground. Unbeknownst to her, her boss, Carstairs, has been strong-armed into having her take other items along, sewn into her coat. On the way, she meets a group of back-packing college students at an airport, and offers to help when one of them is arrested by the secret police, upon arriving in Sofia. Mrs. Pollifax then leads both friends and foes on a merry chase, as she travels around Bulgaria, on a series of absorbing, and interwoven, adventures, including helping to rescue the student and several political prisoners from the seemingly impregnable Panchevsky Institute.

===&quot;A Palm for Mrs. Pollifax&quot; (1973)===
Mrs. Pollifax is dispatched to Switzerland to find some missing plutonium: Mr. Carstairs of the CIA suspects the contraband has been hidden in an upscale clinic in Switzerland. Mrs. Pollifax begins a careful investigation of the guests at the clinic and rapidly befriends a young British man, a Belgian woman, and a young boy and his grandmother from an Arab nation. She soon discovers that very few of the clinic patients are who they claim to be, and she becomes involved in intrigue with men who plan to overthrow the government of a small country. She, of course, displays the courage and ingenuity which Mr. Carstairs has learned to depend on, and she leads her outnumbered friends into the adventure of their lives.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax on Safari&quot; (1976)===
Mrs. Pollifax is called upon by the CIA to undertake another mission, this time to photograph members of a safari in Zambia, one of whom is an international assassin nicknamed Aristotle. She innocently posts an ad in the local newspaper trying to contact her old friend Farrell from the first book. This leads to major complications, as Farrell is involved with the freedom fighters across the border and has made some enemies. There is also a bit of romance as a fellow traveler takes a fancy to Mrs. Pollifax.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax on the China Station&quot; (1983)===
Mrs. Pollifax is thrilled when Mr. Carstairs, her boss at the CIA, gives her an assignment in China to help rescue a prisoner from a labor camp. As luck would have it, she has recently completed a course in Chinese history, so she is primed and ready to go. She joins a tour group and is told that one of the other group members is actually a CIA agent who will become her partner later on. She tries unsuccessfully to detect her future partner and is very surprised when the agent&#x27;s identity is revealed. As the action speeds up she finds the labor camp, rides a runaway horse, and encounters some rough stuff from a Russian spy.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax and the Hong Kong Buddha&quot; (1985)===
Mrs. Pollifax flies on a moment&#x27;s notice to Hong Kong, to contact Sheng Ti, whom she met in an earlier book, and find out what is going on at Feng Imports where Sheng Ti is working for an agent named Detwiler. Detwiler&#x27;s reports to the CIA have proved to be false, so he is suspected of being a counterspy and giving evidence to the enemy. Mrs. Pollifax meets some other interesting characters, including a psychic and another old friend, who is a reformed cat burglar, while in pursuit of the truth about Feng Imports. She is captured and tortured, but prevails as always.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax and the Golden Triangle&quot; (1988)===
This time Mrs. Pollifax&#x27;s assignment seems simple: while she and her husband Cyrus Reed are vacationing in Thailand, she is to pick up some valuable information on drug smuggling from an informant called Ruamsak. Everything goes awry immediately: Ruamsak is murdered, Cyrus is kidnapped, and Emily joins forces with Bonchoo, an intriguing stranger with complex reasons of his own for wanting to find Cyrus. They meet the Akha people in the jungle. The usual phalanx of muddled but supportive CIA agents try to follow Emily through the jungles of Thailand and are seriously rattled when one of their directors abruptly vanishes, only to reappear in the Golden Triangle as the head of all illicit drug trafficking. Pollifax needs all her wiles and her considerable skills in the martial arts, not only to track her husband but also to put a serious dent in the heroin trade.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax and the Whirling Dervish&quot; (1990)===
Mrs. Pollifax is dispatched to Morocco to provide a cover for another of their agents, Max Janko. She will pose as Max&#x27;s aunt to make the pair look like tourists, while in reality they will be trying to identify all seven Moroccan CIA operatives in order to ferret out the mole who has recently infiltrated the Atlas network, a secret branch of the CIA. Anticipating a relatively serene journey through picturesque Moroccan villages with an agreeable companion, Mrs. Pollifax is dismayed to find Janko insufferably hostile. Worse, he intends to kill her. By the time the real Janko shows up, a murder has occurred, and Mrs. Pollifax and her inexperienced companion are running for their lives from one dusty hamlet to the next, desperately trying to find the informer and save the rest of the network.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax and the Second Thief &quot; (1993)===
Mrs. Pollifax travels to Sicily in this adventure. Former colleague John Farrell, hired to crack a safe and lift a document signed by Julius Caesar sends an SOS while dodging a professional assassin whom he and Mrs. Pollifax jailed some years ago. Soon she too is ducking bullets and the old pals are forced to hole up in the Villa Franca—part farm, part medieval fortress and full-time residence of young CIA agent Kate Rossiter&#x27;s eccentric aunt. Ancient artifacts, hair-raising chases, art forgery, arms traffic, a nighttime assault on the villa, mysterious millionaires, spectacular scenery and unexpected romance are some of the ingredients simmering in the plot.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax Pursued&quot; (1995)===
Mrs. Pollifax discovers a young woman hiding in a closet of her Connecticut home on the same day that she observes a suspicious white van patrolling the neighborhood. Kadi Hopkirk says the men in the van have been following her ever since she met Sammy, a childhood friend from the African country of Ubangiba. Mrs. Pollifax hides Kadi in the car and takes to the highway but is unable to shake the van until she calls on her colleagues at the CIA, who send a helicopter to whisk them away to a traveling carnival in rural Maine. Mrs. Pollifax poses as a journalist, and Kadi becomes the lower half of the woman who is sawed in two, while the CIA pals find out who Sammy is and why he is being so heavily guarded. Mrs. Pollifax solves several mysteries, including a stabbing at the carnival, Kadi and Sammy&#x27;s story and the abduction of a wealthy executive.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax and the Lion Killer&quot; (1996)===
The sequel to &quot;Mrs. Pollifax Pursued&quot;, in which we meet Kadi Hopkirk, the daughter of Ubangiba missionaries. Kadi&#x27;s college friend Sammy is now trying to rule Ubangiba after many years of dictatorship. Sammy calls upon Kadi for help and Mrs. Pollifax decides to accompany her to Africa. There have been a series of violent deaths at the hands of a &quot;lion killer&quot;, one who dons a lion costume, and Sammy&#x27;s enemies have accused him of being behind the murders. When Kadi arrives in Ubangiba, she becomes the target of an old enemy, and Mrs. Pollifax does her best to protect the young girl. A potential archaeological dig and the hint of romance for Kadi combine with political intrigue and murder.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax, Innocent Tourist&quot; (1997)===
Mrs. Pollifax travels to Jordan with former Company agent John Sebastian Farrell to receive a manuscript smuggled from Iraq, written by an executed dissident Iraqi novelist. As Farrell&#x27;s cover, Mrs. Pollifax poses as his tourist cousin but immediately is up to her flowered straw hat in intrigue. Farrell&#x27;s contact doesn&#x27;t show up for their scheduled meeting at the Crusader castle at Karak, although Emily does find a dead body there. When their guide, Youseff, and his sister, Hanan, invite them to visit their grandfather, a desert sheik, they&#x27;re trailed by Jordanian terrorists, the Iraqi secret police and Jordanian police. The climax occurs at an ancient desert fort.

===&quot;Mrs. Pollifax Unveiled&quot; (2000)===
Mrs. Pollifax teams up with freelance CIA agent John Farrell on an investigation into the disappearance of Amanda Pym in Syria. Ms. Pym was a fifteen-minute media superstar when she allegedly stopped an airplane hijacking from succeeding. Witnesses last saw Amanda enter a vehicle that waited for her at the Damascus Airport. Farrell and Mrs. Pollifax land in Syria where the government places a tail on the duo. However, they quickly elude their shadow in order to obtain information that provides them with the first clue in their hunt. They soon enter the Syrian Desert where they meet American archeologist Joe Fleming. Joining the two operatives on their quest, Joe and the two spies seek an elusive individual who seems to be undergoing a rigorous training for a mission that has world implications.

==Mrs. Pollifax in film==
&quot;Mrs. Pollifax—Spy&quot; (1971), a theatrical film based on the book &quot;The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax&quot;, stars Rosalind Russell in the title role, Darren McGavin as John Sebastian Farrell, and Dana Elcar as Carstairs. Russell was also credited as contributing to the story idea under a pseudonym.

&quot;The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax&quot; (1999), a CBS television movie adaptation of the eponymous book, stars Angela Lansbury in the title role, Thomas Ian Griffith as Farrell, and Ed Bishop as Carstairs.

<doc id="1274722" wikidata="Q994189" url="?curid=1274722" title="Exposed (Mike Oldfield album)">
<text>Exposed is the first live album by English musician Mike Oldfield, released as a double album on 27 July 1979 by Virgin Records in the UK. It was recorded at various locations across Europe during Oldfield&#x27;s debut concert tour as a solo artist, following the release of his fourth studio album &quot;Incantations&quot; (1978). The album features &quot;Incantations&quot; and his debut album &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; (1973) performed in their entirety, plus Oldfield&#x27;s 1979 non-album single &quot;Guilty&quot; as the encore.

&quot;Exposed&quot; was initially marketed as a restricted release with just 100,000 copies produced, but strong sales prompted Virgin Records to give the album a full release. It peaked at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart and earned a silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry for selling 60,000 copies. A concert film of the shows at the Wembley Conference Centre during the 1979 tour were released on DVD in October 2005, also entitled &quot;Exposed&quot;.

==Background and recording==
After undergoing Erhard Seminars Training in 1978, the formerly reclusive Mike Oldfield launched a Europe-wide tour with instrumental and choral ensemble to promote his fourth solo album, &quot;Incantations&quot;.

Initially during the tour the concerts were being recorded without the knowledge of the musicians, so that they could be paid less money, for just a performance and not a recording. The musicians found out, but the recordings went ahead and the album was produced.

The artwork is linked to the title, as it shows a frame of film containing a photo of Oldfield in a concert arena. Among the choir singers were members of the Queen&#x27;s College, London choir. The all-female choir singers were selected strictly based on their looks.

Due primarily to costs associated with the numerous support singers and musicians, the tour made a net loss of half a million pounds.

The album was recorded using The Manor Studio&#x27;s Mobile unit, and mixed at The Town House, London. The double vinyl album was released in 4 channel quadraphonic sound using the SQ Quadraphonic encoding system. This was one of the last quadraphonic albums released.

== Reissues ==
&quot;Exposed&quot; has been reissued a number of times including a HDCD reissue by Virgin Records in 2000.A double CD version was later released. A DVD version of the concert, recorded at Wembley Conference Centre, was released in 2005.

 the album has not been reissued on CD or digitally by Mercury Records. However, other reissued albums include different live recordings from the same period as &quot;Exposed&quot;. This comes as part of a deal in which Oldfield&#x27;s Virgin albums were transferred to Universal&#x27;s label. With the exception of this record and &quot;The Orchestral Tubular Bells&quot;, all Oldfield&#x27;s 1970s albums have been reissued by Mercury Records on CD.

A reissue of &quot;Exposed&quot; by Universal Music Group on heavyweight vinyl was announced for release on 2 December 2016 on the same day as a vinyl reissue of the &quot;Collaborations&quot; disc from Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Boxed&quot; compilation.

<doc id="1274727" wikidata="Q4966901" url="?curid=1274727" title="Bridgman seal">
<text>A Bridgman seal, invented by and named after Percy Williams Bridgman, can be used to seal a pressure chamber and compress its contents to high pressures (up to 40,000 MPa), without the seal leaking and releasing the pressure

A cylindrical driving piston is mounted within a cylindrical channel that is closed at its far end. This piston presses against a hard steel ring, followed by a softer steel ring, and then a ring of more viscous or elastic material such as rubber, copper or soap stone, all within the channel. These three intermediate stages provide an inner cylinder, and the third stage bears on a specially shaped final steel piston that applies the force to pressurize material held at the end of the outer, enclosing channel. The final piston consists of a wider portion that fills the main channel, and a narrower cylindrical extension that leads back through the inner channel formed by the three ring-shaped intermediate stages, ending within the hard steel ring without making direct contact with the driving piston. This arrangement ensures that higher pressures create tighter seals that resist any leakage from the material at the end, since the pressure within the last and softest ring is greater than that in the material at the end.

This arrangement has much in common with the earlier de Bange breech obturator system used to prevent the escape of gasses from breech loading artillery, whether inspired by that or independently invented, with the important further feature that Bridgman&#x27;s system does not merely resist the escape of material under pressure while stationary, it applies that pressure by movement within the pressurising equipment.

Bridgman&#x27;s previous pressurizing arrangement, a screw with a 2-m spanner, allowed him to get pressures of up to 400 MPa; the Bridgman seal allowed pressures up to 40,000 MPa. These are typical pressures expected in the Earth&#x27;s internal structure. This advance allowed him to make many discoveries, including the high-pressure phases of ice (still known by the Bridgman nomenclature), high-pressure minerals, and novel high-pressure material properties. These discoveries were important in many fields of science and engineering. Bridgman won a Nobel Prize for his work.

<text>Le Plessis-Robinson () is a commune in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris. , it has 29,100 inhabitants.

==History==
Plessis was first mentioned in 839 as &quot;Plessiacus apud Castanetum&quot;, meaning &quot;plessis&quot; near Castanetum. A &quot;plessis&quot; was a village surrounded by a fence made of branches. In 1112 the village church was founded, of which the romanesque tower still survives as the oldest monument of Le Plessis. At the end of the 12th the village was renamed Le Plessis-Raoul, after the local lord Raoul, chamberlain of king Philip II of France. In 1407 it came into the hands of Jean Piquet de La Haye, who built a castle in the village, now called Le Plessis-Piquet. In 1614 a monastery of the Congregation of the Feuillants was built in the village. In 1682 Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Minister of Finances under Louis XIV had a pond dug which fed the fountains of the nearby Château de Sceaux. Pierre de Montesquiou d&#x27;Artagnan purchased the estate in 1699, and expanded the gardens. In 1790, as a result of the French Revolution, Antoine Moullé was elected the first mayor of Le Plessis. The commune was renamed Le Plessis-Liberté. The monastery was nationalised and demolished.

The commune was renamed back to Le Plessis-Piquet in 1801. In 1848, a &quot;guinguette&quot; (cabaret) was established in the area as a suite of interconnected tree houses. It was named &quot;Le grand Robinson&quot; after the tree house described in &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot;, a novel itself named after &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;. Several other popular establishments arose in the area and remained popular until the 1960s. In 1909, the commune of Le Plessis-Piquet was officially renamed Le Plessis-Robinson, after &quot;Le grand Robinson&quot;. In 1854, Louis Hachette bought the castle and the grounds. He later became the mayor of Le Plessis-Piquet and a city councillor. The village and the castle were ruined in the Franco-Prussian War, but the castle was rebuilt by the Hachette family.

==Population==

== New Urbanism ==

In 2023 Le Plessis-Robinson is considered as the most significant project of New Urbanism in France. Philippe Pemezec, mayor between 1989 and 2018, started a project to reshape the city, in collaboration with the architects Marc &amp; Nada Breitman, winners of the 2018 Driehaus Prize and part of the New Classical movement. Philippe Pemezec

<text>Kalayaan, officially the Municipality of Kalayaan (), is a municipality in the province of Laguna, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 24,755 people.

Kalayaan is in the fourth district of the province of Laguna and can be reached three hours by land from Manila. It is the home of approximately 24,214 citizenry. The municipality is home to a hydroelectric power plant, the only pumped storage facility in the Philippines, the Kalayaan Pumped Storage Power Plant located in Brgy. San Juan, that contributes substantially to the income and an economic activity that is anchored on agriculture. It has complied with Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000 (R.A. 9003) by constructing a Category-I Sanitary Landfill under LISCOP, considered one of its kind on the municipal level in the Province of Laguna, which aims to put into practice the segregation and proper disposal of solid waste for the protection of environment.

Kalayaan is roughly rectangular in shape, with a hilly terrain on most of its eastern side, while relatively flat on its western side. Its highest elevations are from 400 to 418 metres. These are found in Sitio Santo Angel, Malaking Pulo, and Cabuhayan in Barangay San Juan, and Sitio Lamao in Barangay San Antonio. Approximately three fourths of the total land area are with terrain 300 metres above sea level. Its lowest points are from 5 to 20 metres along the western sections of Barangays San Juan and Longos towards Laguna de Bay.

The municipality was formerly called Longos until 1956 when it was changed to its present name.

==History==
A marker posted in the municipal building of Kalayaan reads: “On this site grew a coconut tree with three branches interpreted by our forebears as the future site of our municipal building; three branches being San Juan, Longos and San Antonio.”

Today, the belief had been realized but digging through historical records, it seems that the place is still made up of the three original visitas of Babaye (now Longos), Abacao (now San Juan) and San Pablo (now San Antonio). Babaye got its name when the Spaniards came and found women washing clothes in the brook. When the Spaniards continued their aim to conquer the land and a little north of Babaye, they saw a place where people dried abaca and named the place Abacao. The Spaniards claimed the mountains east of Babaye and named the village found there in honor of San Pablo.

On March 30, 1946, Executive Order No. 127 which ordered the transfer of the seat of government from Longos to San Juan was signed by Pres. Manuel Roxas. From then on, a part of San Juan became the Poblacion, while Longos, San Antonio and the rest of San Juan became its barangays.

==Geography==
Kalayaan is located approximately 14º20’ to 14°22’ latitude and 121º28’ to 121º38’ longitude. It is bounded by Paete on the north, Lumban on the south, Laguna de Bay on the west, and Mauban, Quezon on the east. The municipality is from the provincial capital Santa Cruz, from Manila, and from Lucena. It could be reached via the Manila South Expressway and an artery of the national road southward from Calamba and northward from Pagsanjan.

===Barangays===
Kalayaan is politically subdivided into 3 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

<doc id="1274748" wikidata="Q3127997" url="?curid=1274748" title="José Ortega Cano">
<text>José María Ortega Cano (born 23 December 1953) is a Spanish bullfighter. He was married to Spanish singer Rocío Jurado. They adopted two Colombian children, one boy and one girl.

He began his bullfighting career in 1973 in Madrid. He took his &quot;alternativa on 12 October 1974 in Zaragoza. Standing as his &quot;godfather&quot; was José Mari Manzanares, while the witness was Paco Bautista.

Ortega had a notably successful year in 1986, where he was very successful in many bullrings. In 1995 he married Rocío Jurado, a famous Spanish singer. He retired from bullfighting in 1998, but donned the &quot;traje de luces&quot; bullfighter outfit again in 2001 to attempt a comeback, albeit with less success. He entered retirement again in 2004 to take care of his wife, who had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, until her death in 2006. In 2007, Ortega Cano entered the bullring one final time in Olivenza.

He was a contestant on the Spanish version of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; (&quot;Mira quién baila&quot;), where he showed no talent for dancing.

On 29 May 2011, he was involved in a car accident which left the other driver dead and himself in critical condition. After a slow recovery, he left the hospital on 11 July 2011. On 24 April 2013, First-instance criminal court No. 6 of Seville sentenced Ortega Cano to two years, six months and one day in prison for reckless homicide and reckless driving, causing the death of Carlos Parra in the aforementioned accident. He entered Zuera prison in Zaragoza on 23 April 2014. After a year and a month in prison he was left out in regime of semi-liberty.

On 27 September 2018, he married Ana María Aldón (his partner since 2012) by civil law in a notary office in Zaragoza. On 31 December 2020, during COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, Ortega Cano, his wife and his daughter tested positive for COVID-19 with notable symptoms after getting infected on Christmas Eve, recovering from the disease few weeks later but with mild sequelae.

In 2016, the Spanish satirical magazine &quot;Mongolia&quot; caricatured him in a promotional poster as a drunken extraterrestrial against a crashed flying saucer, a reference to the car crash which he had caused in 2011 and for which he had been sentenced in 2013. He sued the magazine alleging an attack on his honour, and was awarded EUR 40 000 in damages. The court ruling was confirmed on appeal by the Spanish Supreme Court in December 2020.

<doc id="1274750" wikidata="Q2993018" url="?curid=1274750" title="Congressional Quarterly">
<text>Congressional Quarterly, Inc., or CQ, is part of a privately owned publishing company called CQ Roll Call that produces several publications reporting primarily on the United States Congress. CQ was acquired by the Economist Group and combined with &quot;Roll Call&quot; to form CQ Roll Call in 2009; CQ ceased to exist as a separate entity, and in July 2018, a deal was announced for the company to be acquired by FiscalNote.

==History==
===20th century===

CQ was founded in 1945 by Nelson Poynter and his wife, Henrietta Poynter, to provide a link between local newspapers and the complex politics within Washington, D.C.

Thomas N. Schroth, managing editor of the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;, was elected in October 1955 as executive editor and vice president. Schroth built the publication&#x27;s impartial coverage, with annual revenue growth from $150,000 when he started to $1.8 million. In addition to adding a book division, Schroth added many staff members who achieved future journalistic success, including David S. Broder, Neal R. Peirce, and Elizabeth Drew. He was fired from &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; in 1969 after festering disagreements with Poynter over editorial policy at the publication, and Schroth&#x27;s efforts to advocate &quot;more imaginative ways of doing things&quot; reached a boil.

In 1965, Poynter summed up his reasons for founding CQ: &quot;The federal government will never set up an adequate agency to check on itself, and a foundation is too timid for that. So it had to be a private enterprise beholden to its clients.&quot; Despite its name, CQ was published quarterly for only one year. Demand drove more frequent updates, first weekly, then daily. CQ was also an early leader in delivering information on a real-time basis, starting with a dial-up service in 1984. Its website dominates the online legislative tracking information market and has been nominated for several awards. CQ has since launched several web-only newsletters with a greater focus on particular areas, including &quot;CQ Homeland Security&quot;, &quot;CQ BudgetTracker&quot;, and &quot;CQ HealthBeat&quot;.

===21st century===
In 2005, CQ&#x27;s flagship publication, the &quot;Weekly Report&quot;, was relaunched as &quot;CQ Weekly&quot; with a wider focus, including &quot;government, commerce, and politics.&quot; A daily publication, &quot;CQ Today&quot;, also is available every day when Congress is in session. &quot;CQ Today&quot;″s main print competition is Atlantic Media&#x27;s &quot;CongressDaily&quot;.

In May 2008, &quot;CQ Press&quot; was purchased by SAGE Publishing. Although it retains the name &quot;CQ Press&quot; (a trademark of Congressional Quarterly), CQ Press is no longer an affiliate of Congressional Quarterly.

Until 2009, CQ was owned by the Times Publishing Company of St. Petersburg, Florida, publisher of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; and other publications. The Times Publishing Company is, in turn, owned by the Poynter Institute, a school for journalists founded by Nelson Poynter. The Economist Group acquired CQ; the deal terms were not disclosed.

==Awards==
Ten CQ reporters have won the &quot;Everett McKinley Dirksen Award for Distinguished Reporting of Congress&quot; from the National Press Foundation: Alan Ehrenhalt in 1983, Joan Biskupic in 1991, Janet Hook in 1992, George Hager in 1996, Jackie Koszczuk in 1997, Sue Kirchhoff in 2000, John Cochran in 2003, Jonathan Allen in 2008, Matt Fuller in 2015 and John M. Donnelly in 2018.

For most of its life, &quot;Governing&quot; was published by Washington, D.C.–based Congressional Quarterly, Inc., a subsidiary of the Times Publishing Co. of St. Petersburg, Florida. In 1994, &quot;Governing&quot; acquired its primary competitor, &quot;City &amp; State&quot; magazine, and that publication was merged into &quot;Governing.&quot; In 2009, it was sold to e.Republic.

On August 7, 2019, the magazine announced that it would discontinue publication, with its September 2019 issue its last print edition. At first, it announced an intention to close its website and other operations. However, it later relaunched as a website with a new focus: &quot;what state and local government looks like in a world of rapidly advancing technology.&quot; The website adopted a new subtitle, renaming itself &quot;Governing: The Future of States and Localities.&quot;

<text>CQ Press, a division of SAGE Publishing, publishes books, directories, periodicals, and electronic products on American government and politics, with an expanding list in international affairs and journalism and mass communication.

==History==
Nelson Poynter, former journalist and owner of the St. Petersburg Times, and his wife Henrietta, founded Congressional Quarterly in 1945. Poynter&#x27;s vision for Congressional Quarterly was to make transparent the happenings within the government and Washington, DC. Poynter established the Modern Media Institute, now known as the Poynter Institute, with the mission of promoting democracy through education to journalists and other media leaders. After Poynter&#x27;s death in 1978, the Institute received controlling stock of the St. Petersburg Times and ownership of CQ.

In May 2008, CQ Press was purchased from Congressional Quarterly by SAGE Publications in its entirety. SAGE is an international publisher of journals, books, and electronic media for academic, educational, and professional markets. A privately owned corporation, SAGE has offices in Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, and Singapore, in addition to the CQ Press office in Washington, DC.

From 2010 to 2011, Marinaro starred in the football comedy series &quot;Blue Mountain State&quot;. He is also known as a regular cast member of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, playing Officer Joe Coffey for five seasons (1981–1986).

== Career ==
===Football===
Marinaro played high school football in New Milford, New Jersey, for the New Milford High School Knights.

Marinaro played college football at Cornell University, where he was a three-time All-American, and set over 16 NCAA records. He was the first running back in NCAA history to run for 4,000 career rushing yards, and led the nation in rushing in 1971.

Marinaro was runner-up to Pat Sullivan for the Heisman Trophy in 1971, the highest finish for an Ivy League player since the league de-emphasized football in the mid-1950s. Princeton&#x27;s Dick Kazmaier won the award in 1951 when the Ivy was still considered a major football conference. Marinaro won the 1971 Maxwell Award and the UPI College Football Player of the Year as the top player in college football. He holds four NCAA records: most rushes per game in a season (39.6 in 1971), career average carries per game (34.0, 1969–71), most rushing yards per game over an entire career (174.6, 1969–71), and earliest game reaching 1,000 rushing yards (5th, 1971).

While at Cornell, Marinaro was a member of Psi Upsilon and was selected for membership in the Sphinx Head Society. He went on to play professional football for six seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, New York Jets and Seattle Seahawks, appearing in Super Bowl VIII and Super Bowl IX with the Vikings. He scored 13 touchdowns over his career.

===Acting===
After leaving football, Marinaro became an actor. He has been a cast member on a number of television series, including &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; and &quot;Sisters&quot;. He joined the regular cast of &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; in 1981, playing officer Joe Coffey until 1986. Furthermore, he co-presented the Crystal Light USA National Aerobic Championship. He also appeared in the 2006 film &quot;Circus Island&quot;.

Marinaro played the head football coach for three seasons on Spike TV&#x27;s comedy, &quot;Blue Mountain State&quot;.

In September 2019, Marinaro was a guest on Turner Classic Movies. With Ben Mankiewicz, he appeared in wraparounds and provided introductions for films in a college football-themed series.

==Personal life==
Marinaro is married to fitness expert Tracy York and has one son.

==Honors==
Marinaro was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1991.

In January 2020, Marinaro was named by ESPN as one of the &quot;150 greatest players in college football&#x27;s 150-year history&quot;, ranking at number 126. He was one of only three Ivy League players on the list. ESPN wrote of Marinaro, &quot;It is up for debate as to whether Marinaro is the last great running back produced by the Ivy League. What is not up for debate are the numbers that illustrate his production.&quot;

<doc id="1274780" wikidata="Q14665" url="?curid=1274780" title="Emu War">
<text>The Emu War (or Great Emu War) was a nuisance wildlife management military operation undertaken in Australia over the later part of 1932 to address public concern over the number of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia, said to be destroying crops in the Campion district within the Wheatbelt of Western Australia. The unsuccessful attempts to curb the emu population employed Royal Australian Artillery soldiers armed with Lewis guns—leading the media to adopt the name &quot;Emu War&quot; when referring to the incident. Although many birds were killed, the emu population persisted and continued to cause crop destruction.

==Background==
Following World War I, large numbers of discharged veterans who served in the war were given land by the Australian government to take up farming within Western Australia, often in agriculturally marginal areas. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, these farmers were encouraged to increase their wheat crops, with the government promising—and failing to deliver—assistance in the form of subsidies. Because of the recommendations and the promised subsidies, wheat prices continued to fall, and by October 1932 the situation intensified, with the farmers preparing to harvest the season&#x27;s crop while simultaneously threatening to refuse to deliver the wheat.

The farmers&#x27; difficulties were worsened by the arrival of approximately 20,000 emus. Emus regularly migrate after their breeding season, heading to the coast from the inland regions. With the cleared land and additional water supplies being made available for livestock by the Western Australian farmers, the emus found that the cultivated lands were good habitat, and they began to foray into farm territory—in particular the marginal farming land around Chandler and Walgoolan. The emus consumed and spoiled the crops and left large gaps in fences where rabbits could enter and cause further problems.

Farmers relayed their concerns about the birds ravaging their crops, and a deputation of ex-soldiers were sent to meet with the Minister of Defence, Sir George Pearce. Having served in World War I, the soldier-settlers were well aware of the effectiveness of machine guns, and they requested their deployment. The minister readily agreed, although with conditions attached: the guns were to be used by military personnel, troop transport was to be financed by the Western Australian government, and the farmers would provide food, accommodation, and payment for the ammunition. Pearce also supported the deployment on the grounds that the birds would make good target practice, while it has also been argued that some in the government may have viewed the operation as a way of being seen to be helping the Western Australian farmers, as well as to stave off the brewing secession movement. Towards that end, a cinematographer from Fox Movietone was enlisted.

== The &quot;war&quot; ==

Military involvement was due to begin in October 1932. The &quot;war&quot; was conducted under the command of Major Gwynydd Purves Wynne-Aubrey Meredith of the Royal Australian Artillery&#x27;s 7th Heavy Artillery, with Meredith commanding soldiers Sergeant S. McMurray and Gunner J. O&#x27;Halloran, armed with two Lewis guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. The operation was delayed by a period of rainfall that caused the emus to scatter over a wider area. The rain ceased by 2 November 1932, whereupon the troops were deployed with orders to assist the farmers and, according to a newspaper account, to collect 100 emu skins so that their feathers could be used to make hats for light horsemen.

===First attempt===
On 2 November, the men travelled to Campion, where some 50 emus were sighted. As the birds were out of range of the guns, the local settlers attempted to herd the emus into an ambush, but the birds split into small groups and ran so that they were difficult to target. Nevertheless, while the first fusillade from the machine guns was ineffective due to the range, a second round of gunfire was able to kill &quot;a number&quot; of birds. Later the same day a small flock was encountered, and &quot;perhaps a dozen&quot; birds were killed.

The next significant event was on 4 November. Meredith had established an ambush near a local dam, and more than 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until the birds were in close proximity before opening fire. The gun jammed after only 12 birds were killed and the remainder scattered before any more could be shot. No more birds were sighted that day.

In the days that followed, Meredith chose to move further south, where the birds were &quot;reported to be fairly tame&quot;, but there was only limited success in spite of his efforts. By the fourth day of the campaign, army observers noted that &quot;each pack seems to have its own leader now—a big black-plumed bird which stands fully high and keeps watch while his mates carry out their work of destruction and warns them of our approach&quot;. At one stage, Meredith even went so far as to mount one of the guns on a truck, a move that proved to be ineffective, as the truck was unable to gain on the birds, and the ride was so rough that the gunner was unable to fire any shots. By 8 November, six days after the first engagement, 2,500 rounds of ammunition had been fired. The number of birds killed is uncertain: one account estimates that it was 50 birds, but other accounts range from 200 to 500, the latter figure being provided by the settlers. Meredith&#x27;s official report noted that his men had suffered no casualties, except for their dignity.

Summarising the culls, ornithologist Dominic Serventy commented:
On 8 November, members in the Australian House of Representatives discussed the operation. Following the negative coverage of the events in the local media, that included claims that &quot;only a few&quot; emus had died, Pearce withdrew the military personnel and the guns on 8 November.

After the withdrawal, Major Meredith compared the emus to Zulus and commented on the striking manoeuvrability of the emus, even while badly wounded.
=== Second attempt ===

After the withdrawal of the military, the emu attacks on crops continued. Farmers again asked for support, citing the hot weather and drought that brought emus invading farms in the thousands. James Mitchell, the Premier of Western Australia lent his strong support to renewal of the military assistance. At the same time, a report from the Base Commander was issued that indicated 300 emus had been killed in the initial operation.

Acting on the requests and the Base Commander&#x27;s report, by 12 November the Minister of Defence approved a resumption of military efforts. He defended the decision in the Senate, explaining why the soldiers were necessary to combat the serious agricultural threat of the large emu population. Although the military had agreed to lend the guns to the Western Australian government on the expectation that they would provide the necessary people, Meredith was once again placed in the field due to an apparent lack of experienced machine gunners in the state.

Taking to the field on 13 November 1932, the military found a degree of success over the first two days, with approximately 40 emus killed. The third day, 15 November, proved to be far less successful, but by 2 December the soldiers were killing approximately 100 emus per week. Meredith was recalled on 10 December, and in his report he claimed 986 confirmed kills with 9,860 rounds, at a rate of exactly 10 rounds per confirmed kill. In addition, Meredith claimed exactly 2,500 wounded birds had also died from their injuries. In assessing the success of the cull, an article in the &quot;Coolgardie Miner&quot; on 23 August 1935 reported that although the use of machine guns had been &quot;criticised in many quarters, the method proved effective and saved what remained of the wheat&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
Despite the problems encountered with the cull, the farmers of the region once again requested military assistance in 1934, 1943, and 1948, only to be turned down by the government. Instead, the bounty system that had been instigated in 1923 was continued, and this proved to be effective: 57,034 bounties were claimed over a six-month period in 1934.

By December 1932, word of the Emu War had spread, reaching the United Kingdom. Some conservationists there protested the cull as &quot;extermination of the rare emu&quot;. Dominic Serventy and Hubert Whittell, the eminent Australian ornithologists, described the &quot;war&quot; as &quot;an attempt at the mass destruction of the birds&quot;.

Throughout 1930 and onward, exclusion barrier fencing became a popular means of keeping emus out of agricultural areas (in addition to other vermin, such as dingoes and rabbits).

In November 1950, Hugh Leslie raised the issues of emus in federal parliament and urged Army Minister Josiah Francis to release a quantity of .303 ammunition from the army for the use of farmers. The minister approved the release of 500,000 rounds of ammunition.

== Legacy ==
In 2019, a musical adaptation of the story was workshopped in Melbourne by playwright Simeon Yialeloglou and composer James Court. An action-comedy film, titled &quot;The Emu War&quot;, premiered at Monster Fest on 22 October 2023. Another action-comedy movie retelling of the events, written by John Cleese, Monty Franklin, Rob Schneider, Camilla Cleese, and Jim Jefferies, was aiming to begin production in 2023 or 2024.

<text>Gillian May Armstrong (born 18 December 1950) is an Australian feature film and documentary director, best known for &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1979), &quot;Mrs. Soffel&quot; (1984), &quot;High Tide&quot; (1987), &quot;The Last Days of Chez Nous&quot; (1992), and &quot;Little Women&quot; (1994). She is a Member of the Order of Australia. She has won many film awards, including an AFI Best Director Award, has been nominated for numerous others, and is the holder of several honorary doctorates.

== Early life and education==
Gillian May Armstrong was born on 18 December 1950 in Melbourne, Victoria. She was the middle child of a local real estate agent father and a primary school teacher mother who stopped outside work to rear a family. 

She grew up in the suburb of Vermont, and attended Vermont High School. Her father was a frustrated photographer who wasn&#x27;t allowed to follow his dreams professionally, yet continued his practice as an amateur. Armstrong reminisces that she grew up in a dark room, learning all about photography. When she first decided to go to art school, Armstrong didn&#x27;t have a very firm grasp on what she wanted to do. Armstrong said that her parents were always very supportive of her hopes and dreams, which was not always true for women in the 1960s and 70s. 

She studied general art in her first year and then majored in film, spending four years at Swinburne Technical College from 1968, which had recently established the beginnings of the Swinburne Film and Television School within the Graphic Art School. Originally she wanted to become set and costume designer, but ended up majoring in filmmaking after becoming interested in films. At the college, then an art school, she saw a range of artistic films, different from the commercial cinema and television she was used to.

After working for a year as an assistant editor in a commercial film house, she applied for a place on the one-year postgraduate directors course offered under a pilot training scheme at the newly-created national film school, the Australian Film and Television School (now AFTRS) in 1973. Only 12 students were selected, and they were &quot;really tested as directors&quot;. Two films that she made there won several awards, and one was screened at an international student film festival. She went overseas with the film, and then travelled around for 18 months. 

She started her studies before the Australian film industry had developed. She recalls that when new films were released, the actors sounded strange; for the first time their accents were Australian rather than American.

== Career ==
Following a string of short films and documentaries, Armstrong achieved her first directorial recognition through her first full-length film &quot;The Singer and the Dancer&quot;, shot on 16 mm film, which won the best narrative film award at the 1976 Sydney Film Festival.

Armstrong became a film director at the age of 27. During the time of the development of Australian Cinema Armstrong recalls in a &quot;Washington Post&quot; interview that tremendous tax breaks led to a frightful overproduction. Everybody was interested in doing deals and even stockbrokers were becoming directors. However, very few of them had the commitment to cinema that Armstrong and others had, and the films would be shown for a week or two, or not released at all. After Armstrong&#x27;s second film &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;, she had offers from Hollywood but quickly turned them all away, preferring to stay in Australia to make a deliberately small film called &quot;Starstruck&quot;. After the release of &quot;Starstruck&quot;, Armstrong went around giving interviews dressed in a large fuzzy blue sweater dress decorated with coloured beads, a black-and-white polka dot blouse, black tights and blue suede shoes all topped by a punk shag haircut.

Following this success, Armstrong was commissioned by the South Australian Film Corporation to make a documentary exploring the lives of young teenage girls living in Adelaide, South Australia. This became &quot;Smokes and Lollies (1976)&quot;, her first paid job as director.

Armstrong&#x27;s own interest in the girls led her to revisit them at ages 18, 26, 33 and 48, resulting in four more films in the style of the popular &quot;Up Series&quot;. These are &quot;Fourteen&#x27;s Good, Eighteen&#x27;s Better (1980)&quot;, &quot;Bingo, Bridesmaids and Braces (1988),&quot; &quot;Not Fourteen Again (1996)&quot;, and her most recent film &quot;Love, Lust &amp; Lies (2009)&quot;

Armstrong&#x27;s first feature-length film &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot; (1979), an adaptation of Miles Franklin&#x27;s novel of the same name, was the first Australian feature-length film to be directed by a woman for 46 years. Armstrong received six awards at the 1979 Australian Film Awards (previously the Australian Film Institute Awards, or AFI&#x27;s) including Best Director. The film also brought considerable attention to its two main stars, Judy Davis and Sam Neill who were relatively unknown at the time. Following the success of &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award in Best Costume Design, Armstrong directed the Australian rock-musical &quot;Starstruck&quot; which proved her ability to tackle more contemporary and experimental subject matter and styles.

She has directed a number of rock music videos in the early 1980s, including 1984&#x27;s &quot;Bop Girl&quot; by Pat Wilson, which featured Nicole Kidman.

Since then, Armstrong has specialised in period drama. She was the first foreign woman to be approached by the American film company MGM to finance her direction of a big-budget feature, which became &quot;Mrs. Soffel&quot; (1984) starring Mel Gibson and Diane Keaton. This film tells the true story of an affair between a prisoner and a prison warden&#x27;s wife, and was relatively well received by audiences and critics.

On returning to Australia, Armstrong continued to make both documentaries and feature films. She earned great recognition for &quot;High Tide&quot; (1987) and &quot;The Last Days of Chez Nous&quot; (1992), for which she was nominated for Best Director at the 1987 and 1992 Australian Film Institute Awards (AFIs). &quot;The Last Days of Chez Nous&quot; also earned her a nomination at the Berlin Film Festival. Despite this, both films were largely unrecognised internationally

In 1994, Armstrong achieved her greatest Hollywood success with the adaptation of &quot;Little Women&quot;, starring Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, Gabriel Byrne, Christian Bale, Claire Danes and Kirsten Dunst. This adaptation of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s novel was one of the most popular films of the year, and emphasises Armstrong&#x27;s focus on portraying the intimate lives of strong female characters and their relationships with one another.

She followed this success three years later with the film &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot; (1997), starring Ralph Fiennes and a relatively unknown Cate Blanchett. This film, based on the novel by Australian writer Peter Carey, tells the story of a mismatched love affair in 19th-century Australia. It received mixed reviews both locally and internationally, despite its high production value and strong performances by the film main actors.

In the 2000s, Armstrong went on to direct the feature films &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot; (2001), starring Cate Blanchett, and &quot;Death Defying Acts&quot; (2008), starring Catherine Zeta-Jones and Guy Pearce. Based on the novel by Sebastian Faulks, &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot; is another of Armstrong&#x27;s films that centres around a strong female protagonist.

Removed from Armstrong&#x27;s usual subject matter, &quot;Death Defying Acts&quot; portrays a moment in the life of 1920s escape artist Harry Houdini in the style of a supernatural, romantic thriller. It received a modest earning at the box office, and was part of a special screening at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival

Despite the success of these more commercial films, it was Armstrong&#x27;s lesser-known documentary &quot;Unfolding Florence: The Many Lives of Florence Broadhurst&quot; (2006), which earned her the most critical recognition during this time, and a nomination for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.

== Film themes and style ==
=== Themes ===
Armstrong has voiced her desire to reach a wide audience in her interviews, one that includes both men and women of all nationalities. However, her work continually addresses sexual politics and family tensions. Films focused on the escape and struggle with traditional sex roles and its related drawbacks and progressions such as &quot;One hundred a Day&quot;, &quot;My Brilliant Career&quot;, &quot;High Tide&quot;, and &quot;Oscar and Lucinda&quot; continue to reflect the theme. Furthermore, many people have called her a creator of &quot;strong females&quot; but she insists that she is simply making films about complex characters and the choices that they make.

=== Style ===
Armstrong has a distinctive style in her work that resists easy categorisation. Most of her films cannot simply be stated as being either &quot;women&#x27;s films&quot; or Australian ones which are the two most generalised categories for women in her line of work. Armstrong&#x27;s films are described as mixing and intermingling genres in ways that recreate them as something vastly different than what they have been considered. Nevertheless, the films that Armstrong creates can also be considered conventional films in their appeal to the audience. Her films possess sensitive and delicate cinematography, fluid editing, an evocative feel for setting and costume, and a commitment to solid character development and acting. According to film scholar Gwendolyn Audrey Foster, Armstrong has a &quot;strong feminist bent&quot; and a &quot;mordant sense of humor&quot;.

== Personal life ==
 Armstrong is married to John Pleffer, and they have two daughters.

==Recognition and awards==
Armstrong is a Member of the Order of Australia, &quot;In recognition of service to the film industry&quot;.

She has won many awards, including an AFI Best Director Award, and has been nominated for numerous other awards, including a Palme D&#x27;Or and two Golden Bear Awards. She has received multiple hdoctorates, including an honorary doctor of letters from University of Sydney, and an honorary doctorate from Swinburne University of Technology.

<text>Current History is the oldest extant United States–based publication devoted exclusively to contemporary world affairs. The magazine was founded in 1914 by George Washington Ochs Oakes, brother of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ publisher Adolph Ochs, in order to provide detailed coverage of World War I. &quot;Current History&quot; was published by the New York Times Company from its founding until 1936. Since 1942 it has been owned by members of the Redmond family; its current publisher is Daniel Mark Redmond.

&quot;Current History&quot;, based in Philadelphia, maintains no institutional, political, or governmental affiliation. It is published monthly, from September through May. Seven issues each year are devoted to world regions (China and East Asia, Russia and Eurasia, the Middle East, Latin America, Europe, South Asia, and Africa); one issue covers current global trends; and one issue addresses a special theme such as climate change or global governance. The magazine has followed this practice of devoting each issue to a single region or theme since 1953. Each issue includes a chronology of major international events, and most contain a book review section and an article devoted to commentary.

According to the &quot;Journal Citation Reports&quot;, the journal has a 2014 impact factor of 0.127, ranking it 149th out of 161 journals in the category &quot;Political Science&quot; and 82nd out of 85 journals in the category &quot;International Relations&quot;.

== History ==
The first of the journal, which was initially called &quot;The New York Times Current History of the European War&quot;, was published on December 12, 1914.

Shortly after &quot;Current History&quot; began publishing in 1914, its editor, Ochs Oakes, decided that a magazine recording “history in the making” should maintain as regular contributors a group of historians and social scientists. He enlisted the help of a Harvard historian, Albert Bushnell Hart, in organizing the journal’s initial group of contributing editors.

Contributors to &quot;Current History&quot; in the publication&#x27;s early years included George Bernard Shaw, Winston Churchill, Charles A. Beard, Allan Nevins, and Henry Steele Commager. Grover Clark was its Beijing correspondent. More recently, the journal has featured authors such as James Schlesinger, Francis Fukuyama, Jeffrey Sachs, Bruce Riedel, Leslie H. Gelb, Bruce Russett, Elizabeth Economy, Charles Kupchan, Ivo Daalder, Joseph Cirincione, Phebe Marr, Juan Cole, Bruce Gilley, and Marina Ottaway.

The magazine was linked to an international scandal in the run-up to World War II. &quot;The New York Times&quot; had sold &quot;Current History&quot; in 1936 to the editor Merle Tracy; in 1939 it was sold again, to an ownership group that included Joseph Hilton Smyth, who also acquired such magazines as &quot;The Living Age&quot; and &quot;The North American Review&quot;. Smyth&#x27;s association with &quot;Current History&quot; ended the same year, but he and two associates, in connection with their publishing activities, were later convicted of acting as agents for the Japanese government without registering with the State Department. &quot;Current History&quot; addressed this episode in its October 1942 issue, maintaining that Smyth during the months that he held an ownership interest in the publication did not control editorial policies.&quot;

== Editorial team ==
&quot;Current History&quot;″s board of contributing editors today includes Catherine Boone (The London School of Economics and Political Science); Holly Case (Brown University); Uri Dadush (Bruegel); Deborah Davis (Yale University); David B. H. Denoon (New York University); Alexandra Délano Alonso (The New School); Larry Diamond (Stanford University); Michele Dunne (Carnegie Endowment for International Peace); Barry Eichengreen (University of California, Berkeley); C. Christine Fair (Georgetown University); Sumit Ganguly (Indiana University); Michael T. Klare (Hampshire College); Marwan M. Kraidy (Northwestern University in Qatar); Joshua Kurlantzick (Council on Foreign Relations); Pamela McElwee (Rutgers University); Michael McFaul (Stanford University); Rajan Menon (Lehigh University); Joseph Nye (Harvard University); Ebenezer Obadare (Council on Foreign Relations); Michael Shifter (Inter-American Dialogue); and Jeffrey Wasserstrom (University of California, Irvine). The publication&#x27;s editor is Joshua Lustig.

<doc id="1274808" wikidata="Q5469605" url="?curid=1274808" title="Forged (book)">
<text>Forged: Writing in the Name of God – Why the Bible&#x27;s Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are is a book by American New Testament scholar Bart D. Ehrman, published in 2011 by HarperCollins. The book posits that between eight and eleven of the twenty-seven books of the Christian New Testament canon were written as forgeries. 

==Arguments and contentions==
In antiquity, pseudepigraphy was an accepted practice in which a writer attributed his work to a well-known figure from the past or a teacher who had greatly influenced him. &quot;Forged&quot; contends that the practice was not in fact accepted and would have been condemned as dishonest by all authorities in antiquity. Ehrman maintains that the more honest term for such falsely attributed writings is &quot;forgery&quot;. 

Ehrman points out numerous inconsistencies he finds within the New Testament that appear to support many of his claims, such as the fact that in Acts 4, the statement is made that both Peter and John were illiterate, yet in later years entire books of the Bible were then alleged to have been written by them.

===New Testament books identified as forgeries by Ehrman===
* First Epistle of Peter
* Second Epistle of Peter
* Second Epistle to the Thessalonians
* First Epistle to Timothy
* Second Epistle to Timothy
* Epistle to Titus
* Epistle to the Ephesians
* Epistle to the Colossians
* Epistle of Jude

===False attributions===
In addition to the books of the New Testament Ehrman identifies as forgeries, he discusses eight originally anonymous New Testament texts that had names of apostles ascribed to them later and are falsely attributed. These are not forgeries since the texts are anonymous but have had false authors ascribed to them by others:

* Gospel of Matthew
* Gospel of Mark
* Gospel of Luke
* Gospel of John
* The Acts of the Apostles
* First Epistle of John
* Second Epistle of John
* Third Epistle of John
* Epistle to the Hebrews

The Epistle of James is not technically a forgery because it does not claim to be specifically by James, the brother of Jesus. Rather, it claims to be by &quot;James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ&quot; (James 1:1). James, Ehrman notes, was a common name. Two of Jesus&#x27; disciples had that name, as did the brother of Jesus. It may very well have been written by someone named James. However, to the extent that the author gives the impression that they are James, the brother of Jesus, it might be considered a forgery: Ehrman notes that the author doesn&#x27;t specify which James he is, meaning &quot;that he is claiming to be the most famous James of all, Jesus&#x27;s brother.&quot;

== Reviews ==
The book was positively reviewed by the &quot;Library Journal&quot;.

United Methodist pastor and biblical scholar Ben Witherington III (Asbury Theological Seminary) wrote a critique of Ehrman&#x27;s positions in his blog. Presbyterian pastor and biblical scholar Michael J. Kruger (Reformed Theological Seminary) also wrote a detailed critique of Ehrman&#x27;s book in the website of The Gospel Coalition.

<doc id="1274810" wikidata="Q517003" url="?curid=1274810" title="Soviet crewed lunar programs">
<text>The Soviet crewed lunar programs were a series of programs pursued by the Soviet Union to land humans on the Moon, in competition with the United States Apollo program. The Soviet government publicly denied participating in such a competition, but secretly pursued two programs in the 1960s: crewed lunar flyby missions using Soyuz 7K-L1 (Zond) spacecraft launched with the Proton-K rocket, and a crewed lunar landing using Soyuz 7K-LOK and LK spacecraft launched with the N1 rocket. Following the dual American successes of the first crewed lunar orbit on 24–25 December 1968 (Apollo 8) and the first Moon landing on July 20, 1969 (Apollo 11), and a series of catastrophic N1 failures, both Soviet programs were eventually brought to an end. The Proton-based Zond program was canceled in 1970, and the N1-L3 program was &quot;de facto&quot; terminated in 1974 and officially canceled in 1976. Details of both Soviet programs were kept secret until 1990 when the government allowed them to be published under the policy of &quot;glasnost&quot;.

Soviet cosmonauts neither orbited nor landed on the Moon.

==Early concepts==

As early as 1961, the Soviet leadership had made public pronouncements about landing a man on the Moon and establishing a lunar base; however, serious plans were not made until several years later. Sergei Korolev, the senior Soviet rocket engineer, was more interested in launching a heavy orbital station and in crewed flights to Mars and Venus. With this in mind, Korolev began the development of the super-heavy N-1 rocket with a 75-ton payload.

===Soyuz-A-B-C and N1===

In its preliminary Moon plans, Korolev&#x27;s design bureau initially promoted the Soyuz A-B-C circumlunar complex (A-B-V in Russian) concept under which a two-crew spacecraft would rendezvous with other components in Earth orbit to assemble a lunar flyby excursion vehicle. The components would then be delivered by the proven middle-sized R-7 rocket. While developing the N1, since 1963, Korolev began to plan a Moon landing mission using two launches and docking. Later Korolev managed to increase the payload of the N1 to 92-93 tons (by switching to liquid hydrogen in the upper stage(s) and increasing the number of engines in its first stage from 24 to 30), providing enough power to accomplish the mission with a single launch.

===UR-500K / LK-1 and UR-700 / LK-3===
Another main space design bureau, headed by Vladimir Chelomei, proposed a competing cislunar orbiting mission using a heavy UR-500K rocket (later renamed the Proton rocket) and a two-crew LK-1 spacecraft. Later, Chelomei also proposed a Moon landing program with a super-heavy UR-700 rocket, an LK-700 lunar lander, and an LK-3 spacecraft.

===R-56=== 
The R-56 which was developed between April 1962 and June 1964 was considered for involvement with the lunar program.

==Reaction to Apollo==
In the early stage of the Soviet and US crewed lunar program, U.S. President John F. Kennedy proposed before the United Nations a joint Moon program, a proposal which was considered by Nikita Khrushchev. The proposal disappeared though with Kennedy&#x27;s assassination two months later, but nevertheless foreshadowed the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which enabled subsequently the Shuttle-Mir program and the ISS.

The Soviet government issued a response to the American Apollo challenge after three years. According to the first government decree about the Soviet crewed Moon programs (Decree 655-268, &#x27; &quot;On Work on the Exploration of the Moon and Mastery of Space&quot; &#x27;), adopted in August 1964, Chelomei was instructed to develop a Moon flyby program with a projected first flight by the end of 1966, and Korolev was instructed to develop the Moon landing program with a first flight by the end of 1967.

Following the change in Soviet leadership from Khrushchev to Leonid Brezhnev in 1964, the Soviet government in September 1965 assigned the flyby program to Korolev, who redesigned the cislunar mission to use his own Soyuz 7K-L1 spacecraft and Chelomei&#x27;s Proton rocket.

Korolev organized full-scale development of both programs, but died after surgery in January 1966. According to a government decree of February 1967, the first crewed flyby was scheduled for mid-1967, and the first crewed landing for the end of 1968.

=== Moon flyby &quot;UR-500K(Proton)/L1(Zond)&quot; program ===

Launched by a 3-staged Proton rocket, the L1 (Zond) was a spacecraft from the Soyuz family and consisted of two or three modified modules of the main craft Soyuz 7K-OK with a total weight of 5.5 tons. The Apollo orbital spacecraft (command ship) for the lunar flyby also had two modules (command and service) but was five times heavier, carried a crew of three and entered lunar orbit, whereas the L1 (Zond) performed a flight around the Moon and came back on a return trajectory. In September 1968 Zond 5 carried the first Earth lifeforms, including two tortoises, to travel around the Moon and return safely. Planned for 8 December 1968 for priority over the US, a first crewed mission of the L1 (Zond) was canceled due to the insufficient readiness of the capsule and rocket. After Apollo 8 won the first (lunar orbit) phase of the Moon Race at the end of 1968, the Soviet leadership lost political interest in the L1 (Zond) program. A few reserve units of L1 (Zond) made unpiloted flights, but by the end of 1970, this program was canceled.

=== Moon landing &quot;N1/L3&quot; program ===


The crewed landing plan adopted a similar method to the single launch and lunar orbit rendezvous of the Apollo project.

For mission safety, weeks before the crewed mission, an LK-R uncrewed L3 complex and two Lunokhod automated rovers would be sent to the Moon, to work as radio beacons for crewed LK, with the LK-R used as a reserve escape craft. The Lunokhods were also equipped with manual controls for the cosmonauts, both for transfer to LK-R in necessity and for regular research.

The N1 rocket would then carry the L3 Moon expedition complex, with two spacecraft (LOK and LK) and two (Block G and Block D) boosters.
A variant of the Soyuz craft, the &quot;Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl&quot; (LOK) command module, would carry two men, with three modules like the regular Soyuz 7K-OK, but was heavier by a few tons. The 7K-OK was half the mass of the three-crew Apollo orbital command ship. The &quot;Lunniy Korabl&quot; (LK) accommodated only one cosmonaut, so in the Soviet plan, only one cosmonaut would land on the Moon. The mass of the LK was 40% of the mass of the Apollo lunar lander.

The L3 complex to be placed in LEO by the N1 was 93 tons (compared to Saturn V&#x27;s 137 tons). The mass of the LOK and LK was 40% of the Apollo complex, but was equivalent to the L3 complex without Block G.

The booster for the LEO toward the Moon for the Apollo vehicle was provided by the last stage of the Saturn V, while for the Block D, LOK and LK, this was to be provided by Block G of the same L3 complex.

During the L3 complex&#x27;s journey to the Moon, the cosmonaut would transfer between the LOK and LK by a &#x27;spacewalk&#x27;. On the Apollo missions, the transfer was done using an internal passage called the docking tunnel. 

Block D was to slow the LOK and LK into lunar orbit, while with Apollo this phase was undertaken by firing the engine on the service module to slow the complex and enter lunar orbit since the Apollo complex traveled with the Command Module and Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) facing back towards the Earth.

Once in orbit, the LK with Block D would separate from the LOK and descend toward the surface of the Moon using the Block D engine. After Block D exhausted its fuel, the LK was to separate and complete landing using its own Blok E engine.

On the Moon, the cosmonaut would take Moon walks, use Lunokhods, collect rocks, and plant the Soviet flag.

After a few hours on the lunar surface, the LK&#x27;s engine would fire again using its landing structure as a launch pad, as with Apollo. To save weight, the engine used for landing would blast the LK back to lunar orbit for an automated docking with the LOK. The cosmonaut then would spacewalk back to the LOK carrying rock samples.

The LK would then be cast off, after which the LOK would fire its rocket for the return to Earth.

===Launch schedules===
As of 1967, the L1/L3 launch schedules were:

:11L: Reserve
:12L: Reserve

Korolev&#x27;s death in 1966, along with various technical and administrative reasons, as well as a lack of financial support, resulted in both programs being delayed.

===Cosmonauts===
In 1966, two cosmonaut training groups were formed. One group was commanded by Vladimir Komarov and included Yuri Gagarin, and was to prepare for qualification flights of the Soyuz in Earth orbit and a Proton-launched cis-lunar mission (Gagarin, Nikolayev, Komarov, Bykovsky, Khrunov; Engineer-Cosmonauts: Gorbatko, Grechko, Sevastyanov, Kubasov, Volkov). Komarov later died in the Soyuz 1 spaceflight when his parachute malfunctioned causing his capsule to smash into the earth at high speed. The second group was led by Alexei Leonov and concentrated on the landing mission (Commanders: Leonov, Popovich, Belyayev, Volynov, Klimuk; Engineer-cosmonauts: Makarov, Voronov, Rukavishnikov, Artyukhin). As a result, Leonov has the strongest claim to have been the Soviets&#x27; first choice for the first man on the Moon.

After Komarov&#x27;s death in Soyuz 1 in 1967, Gagarin was taken out of training and the groups were restructured. Despite the Soyuz 1 setback, the Soviets successfully rehearsed the automated docking of two uncrewed Soyuz craft in Earth orbit in 1968 and with the crewed Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 joint mission in early 1969 tested the other key mission elements.

A total of 18 missions were related to the N1-L3 project.

==Later developments==
After the US Moon landing in 1969, the justification for the Soviet lunar landing program largely evaporated, although development and testing continued into the early 1970s. In 1970–1971 the LK was ready after three uncrewed test flights in LEO (Kosmos 379, Kosmos 398, Kosmos 434). The LOK launched once (Kosmos 382 7K-L1E, a dummy of 7K-LOK). The Krechet lunar spacesuit and support systems were tested.

Four N1 test launches in 1969 (twice), 1971, and 1972 were failures, despite improvements after each crash. The second launch, on 3 July 1969 (an attempt to upstage Apollo 11 by 13 days), resulted in the destruction of the rocket and the entire launch complex, which delayed the N1-L3 program for two years.

In an automatic Moon flyby, these first two launches of the N1 carried the 7K-L1S spacecraft (modified 7K-L1). The dummy 7K-LOK (7K-L1E) and regular 7K-LOK with dummy LKs were used in the third and fourth launches.

The complete L3 lunar expedition complex with the 7K-LOK and LK for the Moon flyby and landing was prepared for a fifth launch, using a modified N1 rocket in August 1974. If this mission and the next had been successful, it would have led to the decision to launch up to five Soviet crewed N1-L3 expeditions in 1976–1980. To gain technical and scientific interest in the program, the modified multi-launched N1F-L3M missions were planned to have significantly more time on the Moon&#x27;s surface than Apollo.

However, N1-L3 (as well as N1F-L3M) program was canceled in May 1974, and Soviet crewed space efforts subsequently concentrated on the development of space stations and on several designs and ground preparatory processes for a Mars mission, which continues to the present day, but has unclear objectives.

A Moon base, Zvezda, that was proposed later, developed mockups of expedition vehicles and surface modules, and &quot;Vulkan-LEK&quot; project were not adopted for economic reasons. As some recompense and as a replacement for the crewed landing program, the Soviets fulfilled a program of automated delivery of lunar soil and Lunokhod automated Moon rovers.

The launch pad and MIK of N1 were redesigned for the Energia-Buran shuttle program. Five LKs and three LOKs remain, at least, with some kept in the designer&#x27;s and producer&#x27;s company museums. Nearly 150 engines produced for first stages of N1F were kept by the manufacturer (Kuznetsov Design Bureau), then sold for use on other launchers beginning around 2000.

<text>USS &quot;Flusser&quot; (DD–20) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the second ship named for Lieutenant commander Charles W. Flusser.

==Construction==
&quot;Flusser&quot; was launched on 20 July 1909, by Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine, sponsored by Miss Genevieve Virden, grandniece of Commander Flusser; and commissioned on 28 October 1909.

==Pre-World War I==
&quot;Flusser&quot; arrived at Charleston, South Carolina – her home port – on 17 December 1909, and began her participation in the regular operating schedule of the Atlantic Torpedo Fleet, an organization many times redesignated in the years that followed. She cruised from the Caribbean to the coast of New England until August 1916, when she began neutrality patrols off New York and in Long Island Sound.

==World War I==
After a repair period at New Orleans, Louisiana early in 1917, &quot;Flusser&quot; had escort duty on the east coast until 30 July 1917, when she departed Charleston for two months of ocean escort and patrol duty based on Ponta Delgada, Azores. She had similar duty out of Brest, France, operating across the English Channel from 22 October – 9 December 1918, returning to Charleston on 31 December. She was decommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 14 July 1919, and sold on 21 November.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==
* Lieutenant William Henry Allen (12 October 1911 – August 1912) (Later Rear admiral)
* Lieutenant William Halsey, Jr. (August 1912 – 5 September 1913) (Later Fleet Admiral)

<doc id="1274824" wikidata="Q4181187" url="?curid=1274824" title="Barrel processor">
<text>A barrel processor is a CPU that switches between threads of execution on every cycle. This CPU design technique is also known as &quot;interleaved&quot; or &quot;fine-grained&quot; temporal multithreading. Unlike simultaneous multithreading in modern superscalar architectures, it generally does not allow execution of multiple instructions in one cycle.

Like preemptive multitasking, each thread of execution is assigned its own program counter and other hardware registers (each thread&#x27;s architectural state). A barrel processor can guarantee that each thread will execute one instruction every &quot;n&quot; cycles, unlike a preemptive multitasking machine, that typically runs one thread of execution for tens of millions of cycles, while all other threads wait their turn.

A technique called C-slowing can automatically generate a corresponding barrel processor design from a single-tasking processor design. An &quot;n&quot;-way barrel processor generated this way acts much like &quot;n&quot; separate multiprocessing copies of the original single-tasking processor, each one running at roughly 1/&quot;n&quot; the original speed.

==History==

One of the earliest examples of a barrel processor was the I/O processing system in the CDC 6000 series supercomputers. These executed one instruction (or a portion of an instruction) from each of 10 different virtual processors (called peripheral processors or PPs) before returning to the first processor. From CDC 6000 series we read that &quot;The peripheral processors are collectively implemented as a barrel processor. Each executes routines independently of the others. They are a loose predecessor of bus mastering or direct memory access.&quot; 

One motivation for barrel processors was to reduce hardware costs. In the case of the CDC 6x00 PPUs, the digital logic of the processor was much faster than the core memory, so rather than having ten separate processors, there are ten separate core memory units for the PPUs, but they all share the single set of processor logic.

Another example is the Honeywell 800, which had 8 groups of registers, allowing up to 8 concurrent programs. After each instruction, the processor would (in most cases) switch to the next active program in sequence.

Barrel processors have also been used as large-scale central processors. The Tera MTA (1988) was a large-scale barrel processor design with 128 threads per core. The MTA architecture has seen continued development in successive products, such as the Cray Urika-GD, originally introduced in 2012 (as the YarcData uRiKA) and targeted at data-mining applications.

Barrel processors are also found in embedded systems, where they are particularly useful for their deterministic real-time thread performance.

An early example is the “Dual CPU” version of the four-bit COP400 that was introduced by National Semiconductor in 1981. This single-chip microcontroller contains two ostensibly independent CPUs that share instructions, memory, and most IO devices. In reality, the dual CPUs are a single two-thread barrel processor. It works by duplicating certain sections of the processor—those that store the architectural state—but not duplicating the main execution resources such as ALU, buses, and memory. Separate architectural states are established with duplicated A (accumulators), B (pointer registers), C (carry flags), N (stack pointers), and PC (program counters).

Another example is the XMOS XCore XS1 (2007), a four-stage barrel processor with eight threads per core. (Newer processors from XMOS also have the same type of architecture.) The XS1 is found in Ethernet, USB, audio, and control devices, and other applications where I/O performance is critical. When the XS1 is programmed in the &#x27;XC&#x27; language, software controlled direct memory access may be implemented. 

Barrel processors have also been used in specialized devices such as the eight-thread Ubicom IP3023 network I/O processor (2004).
Some 8-bit microcontrollers by Padauk Technology feature barrel processors with up to 8 threads per core.

==Comparison with single-threaded processors==
===Advantages===

A single-tasking processor spends a lot of time idle, not doing anything useful whenever a cache miss or pipeline stall occurs. Advantages to employing barrel processors over single-tasking processors include:
* The ability to do useful work on the other threads while the stalled thread is waiting.
* Designing an &quot;n&quot;-way barrel processor with an &quot;n&quot;-deep pipeline is much simpler than designing a single-tasking processor because a barrel processor never has a pipeline stall and doesn&#x27;t need feed-forward circuits.
* For real-time applications, a barrel processor can guarantee that a &quot;real-time&quot; thread can execute with precise timing, no matter what happens to the other threads, even if some other thread locks up in an infinite loop or is continuously interrupted by hardware interrupts.

===Disadvantages===

There are a few disadvantages to barrel processors.

* The state of each thread must be kept on-chip, typically in registers, to avoid costly off-chip context switches. This requires a large number of registers compared to typical processors.
* Either all threads must share the same cache, which slows overall system performance, or there must be one unit of cache for each execution thread, which can significantly increase the transistor count and thus the cost of such a CPU. However, in hard real-time embedded systems where barrel processors are often found, memory access costs are typically calculated assuming worst-case cache behavior, so this is a minor concern. Some barrel processors such as the XMOS XS1 do not have a cache at all.
