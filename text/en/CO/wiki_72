<text>SASL (St Andrews Static Language, alternatively St Andrews Standard Language) is a purely functional programming language developed by David Turner at the University of St Andrews in 1972, based on the applicative subset of ISWIM. In 1976 Turner redesigned and reimplemented it as a non-strict (lazy) language. In this form it was the foundation of Turner&#x27;s later languages Kent Recursive Calculator (KRC) and Miranda, but SASL appears to be untyped whereas Miranda has polymorphic types.

Burroughs Corporation used SASL to write a compiler and operating system.

<text>Standard Architecture for Universal Comment Extensions or SAUCE, as it is most commonly known, is an open metadata protocol for tagging and describing ASCII text files and other files, most of which generally center on or date back to the era of BBSing. SAUCE is very similar in nature to the MP3 ID3 tag format created in 1996 in that it carries metadata such as the title, author (artist), organization (group), as well as specific hierarchical datatype information depending on what type of file it is describing.

The SAUCE protocol was invented and developed by the Belgian programmer known by the pseudonym &quot;Tasmaniac&quot; of ACiD, who later went on to create the XBin image format, in 1994, two years before ID3 was established. The first utility created to add SAUCE descriptions to files was named &quot;SPOON&quot;.

<doc id="1298210" wikidata="Q5715295" url="?curid=1298210" title="What Is Man? (Twain essay)">
<text>&quot;What Is Man?&quot; is a short story by American writer Mark Twain, published in 1906. It is a dialogue between a Young Man and an Old Man regarding the nature of man. The title refers to Psalm 8:4, which begins &quot;what is man, that you are mindful of him...&quot;.

It involves ideas of determinism and free will, as well as of psychological egoism. The Old Man asserts that the human being is merely a machine, and nothing more, driven by the singular purpose to satisfy his own desires and achieve peace of mind. The Young Man objects and asks him to go into particulars and furnish his reasons for his position.

The work appears to be a genuine and earnest debate of his opinions about human nature, rather than satirical. Twain held views similar to that of the Old Man prior to writing &quot;What is Man?&quot;. However, he seems to have varied in his opinions of human freedom.

It was published anonymously in 1906 and received such little attention Twain claimed to have regretted its publication. After his death in 1910, the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; published a feature on it. Criticism at that time focused on its dark and anti-religious nature.

<text>Rey Alejandro Conde Valdivia is a Mexican conductor who has conducted the Orquesta Sinfónica de Xalapa (OSX) since 1977. He is a native of Xalapa, Veracruz. His discography has over 300 recordings.

Born in the &#x27;court of The Pearl&#x27;, a no longer existent building that was locating on the street Úrsulo Galván of Xalapa&#x27;s center, with graduate and master&#x27;s degrees for the Faculty of Music of the Universidad Veracruzana, to which he entered from 1985 after taking particular classes with several teachers, Rey Alejandro (called this way by his father and because he was born on 6 January) took classes of violin with Stanisław Kawalla, with &quot;the Rabbit&quot; Jiménez, Agnieszka Maklakiewicz, and Míkhail Medvid. His degree is the number 71 sent by the institution. Also, he studied orchestral direction course in Venezuela, whereas in Mexico it he did the proper thing with Francisco Savín, Gonzalo Romeu, Enrique Bátiz and others.

On having obtained a scholarship proceeding from the Organization of American States (OEA) to complement his preparation in Venezuela, this teacher had the opportunity to observe and analyze closely one of the most complete and ambitious plans for the formation of musical young men. And he comments around that experience: &quot;&quot;In Venezuela there are federative entities of medium importance that have from five to ten youth professional orchestras, without counted the infantile ones that can come to thirty, and all with excellent level … The teacher Jose Antonio Abreu, with the collaboration of a formidable team in which Argentine teachers tell each other, he has created a system of child and youth orchestras that has revolutionized the concept of the training and musical creativity, with hundreds of thousands of integrated young men&quot;.&quot;

With artistic as executing preparation of violin and viola, from 1995 he got out of a jam itself as one of four leaders of an orchestra whom was relying on the Camerata Juvenil at the time (today La
Orquesta Sinfónica Juvenil
del Estado de Veracruz), at the time that he realized arrangements that were registered in recording by the same Camerata under the conducting of the Argentinian Efraín Guigui.

<doc id="1298221" wikidata="Q7914844" url="?curid=1298221" title="Vanguard University">
<text>Vanguard University (officially Vanguard University of Southern California) is a private Protestant university in Costa Mesa, California. It was the first four-year college in Orange County. Vanguard&#x27;s required core curriculum includes courses on American politics and history, theology, fine arts, and public speaking.

==History==
In summer 1920, Harold K. Needham, D. W. Kerr, and W. C. Pierce opened Southern California Bible School, an institution intended to prepare Christian workers for the various ministries of the church. The school moved from Los Angeles to Pasadena in 1927, and was chartered by the state of California in 1939 to grant degrees. Given this new distinction, the former Southern California Bible School became Southern California Bible College, the first four-year institution of the Assemblies of God. In 1943 the college received recognition by the government for the training of military chaplains. It moved to the present campus in 1950, becoming the first four-year college in Orange County. Its name was changed to Southern California College nine years later when majors in the liberal arts were added to the curriculum.

Regional accreditation and membership in the Western Association of Schools and Colleges were granted in 1964. In 1967 the college received recognition and approval of its teaching credential program from the California State Board of Education. In June 1983 the Graduate Studies Program received approval from the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. A Degree Completion Program was started in 1994 for adult learners. On July 1, 1999, university status was achieved when Southern California College registered with the Secretary of State&#x27;s Office as Vanguard University of Southern California.

==Campus==
Vanguard&#x27;s campus is in Costa Mesa, California, centrally located in Orange County and about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego. Two graduate programs, organizational psychology and clinical psychology, are housed nearby at a satellite campus in Santa Ana, California.

== Structure and accreditation ==

=== Structure ===
The President&#x27;s Cabinet is responsible for oversight and management of the university. The university is divided into four schools: College of Arts and Sciences, Patty Arvielo School of Business and Communication, School of Education, and School of Theology and Ministry.

=== Accreditation ===
It is accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission.

==University presidents==

=== List of presidents ===
Harold K. Needham served as the founding president of Vanguard University. Subsequently, nine people have served as presidents of the university: Daniel W. Kerr, Irvine J. Harrison, John B. Scott, O. Cope Budge, Emil A. Balliet, Wayne E. Kraiss, Murray W. Dempster, Carol Taylor, and Michael J. Beals, who assumed the office on August 1, 2013. 

=== Notable presidents ===

==== Harold K. Needham ====
Needham was one of the founders of the university. He served as its inaugural president. Needham chapel, Vanguard University&#x27;s chapel, is named in his honor.

==== Michael J. Beals ====
Beals received a BA from Vanguard in 1981 and a PhD in Christian Ethics from Fuller Theological Seminary. Before assuming the university&#x27;s presidency, he served as the senior pastor of a Pentecostal church for 23 years. As president, Beals has overseen the construction of the 42,000 sq. ft. Waugh Student Center and 61,000 sq. ft. Freed Center. Additionally, he oversaw the recruitment of the largest incoming ungraduated class in the university&#x27;s history. In 2016, Beals, along with other conservative Christians, publicly opposed California Senate Bill 1146 authored by Democrat Ricardo Laura. He asserted &quot;[SB 1146] seeks to restrict the state religious exemption that allows Vanguard and other faith-based institutions the right to operate according to our religious mission and identity. SB 1146 erodes the religious liberty of all California faith-based universities.&quot;

==Rankings==
In 2019, the school was ranked #43 in U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s Western Regional Colleges ranking, and was named by The Princeton Review as one of its 124 “Best Western” Colleges.

==Athletics==

The Vanguard athletic teams are called the Lions. The university is a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Pacific West Conference (PacWest) for most of its sports starting with the 2024-25 academic year.

<text>Linwood Wray Carlton (born June 18, 1937) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in both Canada and the United States. He played college football for the Duke Blue Devils.

Unable to come to terms with the Philadelphia Eagles, who had selected him in the 1959 NFL draft, Carlton traveled to Toronto and the Canadian Football League (CFL) to play for the Argonauts. His Canadian career lasted only four games before he declined a trade to Vancouver, British Columbia, and went home. But another league and another opportunity was in his future.

In his early years with the Buffalo Bills of the American Football League (AFL), Carlton formed a virtually unstoppable backfield tandem, first with Elbert &quot;Golden Wheels&quot; Dubenion, then with Carlton Chester &quot;Cookie&quot; Gilchrist.

On September 18, 1960, in Buffalo&#x27;s home opener, a 27–21 loss to the Denver Broncos, Carlton made history in the second quarter when he scored the team&#x27;s first touchdown on a one-yard run. Carlton gained 1,010 yards from scrimmage (533 rushing and 477 receiving) and 11 touchdowns in the Bills first season.

Carlton briefly retired following the 1963 season, but re-signed with the Bills in July 1964.

Later he helped the Bills win back-to-back league championships in 1964 and 1965. Perennially among the AFL&#x27;s top rushers, he led the league in rushing touchdowns in 1965 and was voted to the American Football League Eastern Division All-Star team in 1965 and 1966. Carlton was the Bills&#x27; all-time leading rusher during their AFL years, with a 4.1 yards per carry average. He was cut from the team in the 1968 preseason; he, along with Dubenion (who finished the 1968 season then retired), were the last players from the Bills&#x27; inaugural season still on the roster.

==Awards==
* Carlton was inducted into The Greater Wilmington Sports Hall of Fame in 2008 
* The North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.

Heffer was born in Chelmsford, Essex, and was educated there at King Edward VI Grammar School before going to read English at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (MA); after he had become a successful journalist and author, his old university awarded him a PhD in History for his 1998 biography of Enoch Powell.

==Career==

=== Journalism ===
Heffer worked for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; until 1995. He worked as a columnist for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; from 1995 to 2005. He rejoined the &quot;Telegraph&quot; in October 2005 as a columnist and associate editor. Martin Newland, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; editor at the time, described the newspaper as Heffer&#x27;s &quot;natural journalistic home&quot;. He left the &quot;Telegraph&quot; in May 2011 to &quot;pursue a role in journalism and broadcasting&quot; and &quot;complete a major literary project&quot;. It had been speculated that his departure had been prompted by his constant attacks on David Cameron&#x27;s government, of which the &quot;Telegraph&quot; had been generally supportive. Heffer later rejoined the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; to edit a new online comment section, called RightMinds, of the paper&#x27;s online edition. He returned to the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; in June 2015 and has a weekly column in the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;.

=== Historian and author ===
Heffer has written biographies of the historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle, the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams and of the British politician Enoch Powell (&quot;Like the Roman&quot;), which was described by the &quot;New Statesman&quot; as &quot;a lucid and majestic tribute&quot; to the politician. He received his PhD in modern history from Cambridge University for the 1998 Powell biography.

In September 2010, Heffer published &quot;Strictly English: the Correct Way to Write... and Why it Matters&quot;, a guide to English grammar and usage. The book met with some negative reception. Since 2010 he has published several historical works such as &quot;A Short History of Power&quot; (2010) and a series of three books on the social history of Great Britain from the mid nineteenth century until the end of the First World War: &quot;High Minds: the Victorians and the Birth of Modern Britain&quot; (2013), &quot;The Age of Decadence: Britain 1880 to 1914&quot; and &quot;Staring at God: Britain 1914 to 1919&quot; (2019).

Heffer became a professorial research fellow at the University of Buckingham in 2017.

==Hillsborough comments==
Heffer said in 2012 that he wrote the first draft of a &quot;Spectator&quot; editorial in 2004 regarding the death of Kenneth Bigley, which said in part:

These comments (sometimes incorrectly attributed to the then-editor of the &quot;Spectator&quot;, Boris Johnson) were widely circulated following the April 2016 verdict by the Hillsborough inquest&#x27;s second hearing proving unlawful killing of the 96 dead at Hillsborough. Johnson apologised at the time of the publication, saying: &quot;That was a lie that unfortunately and very, very regrettably got picked up in a leader in the &quot;Spectator&quot; in 2004, which I was then editing.&quot;

==Politics==
Heffer was politically left-wing in his teenage years, but had abandoned his views by the time he went to university, although he states he still has a lingering respect and affection for several past figures of the left, such as Michael Foot and Tony Benn.

Heffer is a social conservative, though in a recent interview he described himself as a Gladstonian Liberal. He supported the retention of Section 28, opposed the equalisation of the age of consent and the liberalisation of laws on abortion and divorce. He opposed the removal of hereditary peers from the House of Lords in 1999.

Heffer believes that Christianity should have a strong role in shaping both the moral foundation of society and public policy, but he is personally an atheist.

In 2008, Heffer called for the United Nations to be strengthened: &quot;If the UN ceases to be regarded by the larger powers as an institution to secure the peace of the world and justice therein, then that holds out all sorts of potential dangers.&quot; On 27 May 2009, Heffer threatened to stand as an independent against Sir Alan Haselhurst, his local Conservative MP and a deputy speaker, unless Haselhurst paid back the £12,000 he claimed for work on his garden, as revealed in the Parliamentary expenses scandal. A month later, Haselhurst announced that he would pay the £12,000 back, while insisting it had been claimed within the rules.

In 2010, Heffer criticised the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, and modernising elements within the Conservative Party.

Heffer has written sympathetically about and backed the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and Nigel Farage. He supported the UK&#x27;s withdrawal from the EU in the Brexit referendum. In an article in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, Heffer suggested that some of those who supported Britain remaining in the European Union were members of the Bilderberg Group and attendees of the World Economic Forum at Davos. From 2016 to 2019, he was part of the political advisory board of Leave Means Leave.

== Personal life ==
Heffer married his wife Diana in 1987. He has two children and lives in Great Leighs, near Chelmsford. He is a director of the London Chorus (London Choral Society) and was previously director of the Elgar Foundation.

<text>This is a list of members of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] from 1975 to 1977. The 13 December 1975 election was a double dissolution of both Houses, with all 127 seats in the House of Representatives, and all 64 seats in the Senate were up for election. Malcolm Fraser had been commissioned as prime minister following the dismissal of the Prime Minister Gough Whitlam&#x27;s three-year-old Labor government by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, on 11 November 1975. The same day, Fraser advised the calling of the election, in accordance with Kerr&#x27;s stipulated conditions. Thus the Liberal Party of Australia, led by Fraser, with coalition partner the National Country Party, led by Doug Anthony, went to the election as a minority caretaker government. The election resulted in the Coalition securing government with a 30-seat swing in the House of Representatives away from Labor.

:1 Labor member Rex Connor died on 22 August 1977; Labor candidate Stewart West won the resulting by-election on 15 October 1977.

== Biography ==
Josefowicz was born in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. When she was a young child her family moved to Los Angeles, California, where she started studying violin at the age of three and a half using the Suzuki method. Her father, physicist Jack Josefowicz, and mother, biologist Wendy Josefowicz, learned with her. At age five she started formal lessons with Idel Low. At seven she began studies with the distinguished violin teacher Robert Lipsett at The Colburn School. Leila&#x27;s parents, valuing a well-rounded education, believed that both she and her brother Steven should stay in the public school system, and Leila attended public middle and high school despite a very full schedule of music activities.

When Leila was 13 the Josefowiczes moved to Philadelphia so she could attend the prestigious Curtis Institute of Music, where she studied with Jaime Laredo, Jascha Brodsky, Felix Galimir and Joseph Gingold. Leila also attended the Julia R. Masterman School in Philadelphia while at Curtis, completing a bachelor of music degree and her high school diploma in the same year.

== Career ==
While still in her teens, Josefowicz played with symphony orchestras in Europe, Asia and North America, including the major orchestras of Philadelphia, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Houston, Chicago, Boston, Montreal, and Toronto.

Josefowicz made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1994 performing the Tchaikovsky Concerto with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. The same year, she signed an exclusive recording contract with Philips Classics, recording the Tchaikovsky and Sibelius concertos. Other recordings followed on Warner Classics, Nonesuch Records, and Deutsche Grammophon that include masterworks for solo violin, recital repertoire and the concertos of Romantic and modern composers.

Josefowicz has kept a busy international schedule as a soloist, performing regularly around the world, including North and South America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. In addition to traditional masterworks, she has performed contemporary compositions with orchestras including the Berlin Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich, Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. She has also made recent appearances with the London Symphony Orchestra, Gewandhausorchester Leipzig, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Munich Philharmonic, and the Czech Philharmonic.

Josefowicz is acclaimed for championing new compositions, including works by John Adams, Oliver Knussen, Thomas Adès, and Luca Francesconi. In 2008–09 she performed the world premiere of the violin concerto written for her by Esa-Pekka Salonen, for which he won the Grawemeyer Prize, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic; Steven Mackey wrote a violin concerto for her that had its world premiere with the St. Louis Symphony; and Colin Matthews wrote a concerto for her that had its world premiere with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. In 2014 she gave the world premiere of the concerto &quot;Duende&quot; written for her by Francesconi, for which he won the Royal Philharmonic Society Music Award. In 2015 she gave the world premiere of the concerto &quot;Scheherazade.2&quot;, written for her by John Adams, with the New York Philharmonic.

Josefowicz received an Avery Fisher Career Grant in 1994. In 2007 she was named a USA Cummings Fellow, United States Artists. For her advocacy of new contemporary works for the violin, Josefowicz was named a 2008 MacArthur Fellow. In 2018 she was awarded the Avery Fisher Prize.

Josefowicz was married to the conductor Kristjan Järvi, and they have a son.

<doc id="1298241" wikidata="Q1707383" url="?curid=1298241" title="Joseph Kavaruganda">
<text>Joseph Kavaruganda (8 May 1935 – 7 April 1994) was a Rwandan jurist who served as president of Rwanda&#x27;s Constitutional Court. He was killed at the beginning of the Rwandan genocide.

== Early life ==
Joseph Kavaruganda was born on 8 May 1935 in Tare, Ruanda-Urundi. He attended primary school in Tare, and then attended the Kigali Junior Seminary before studying law in Belgium, earning his Doctor of Philosophy in 1966. He returned to Rwanda in 1967 and took up work as a president of Caisse d&#x27;Épargne, a credit and savings institution.

== Legal career ==
In 1974, Kavaruganda was appointed Prosecutor General of Rwanda.

As President of the Constitutional Court, Kavaruganda came into conflict with President Juvénal Habyarimana over legal matters. In 1991, he ruled against Habyarimana in a case involving the denial of certain political privileges to opposition parties which the president had allowed to his own party, the Mouvement Révolutionaire National pour le Développement (MRND), such as the ability to broadcast positions on the state radio station, Radio Rwanda. Though a Hutu, Kavaruganda rejected the ideology of Hutu Power, which sought to discriminate against Rwanda&#x27;s Tutsi population. As a lawyer, he believed that Tutsi exiles had a right to return to the country, and believed that the government should pursue negotiations with the Tutsi-dominated rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). His family maintained friendships with Hutus and Tutsis.

Kavaruganda came under increased pressure following his break with Habyarimana. In 1991, a bomb was detonated adjacent his bedroom at his country retreat. Soon thereafter he began receiving a steady flow of death threats from Hutu extremists. As the Rwandan Civil War dragged on, Habyarimana would negotiate with the political opposition and agree to reforms only to soon thereafter renege on them. Tired with what he perceived as obstructionism, in 1993 Kavaruganda wrote a letter to the president, listing the occasions in the previous years in which he had violated laws and broken his promises. He questioned, &quot;When you violate the law, do you do it in the interest of the Rwandan people? In the spirit of the constitution? No.&quot;

On 4 August 1993, the Rwandan government and the RPF signed the Arusha Accords to end the Rwandan Civil War. Kavaruganda had assisted in drafting the agreement, which provoked the further ire of Hutu extremists. One edition of &quot;Kangura&quot; displayed a cartoon of him hanging from a tree with copies of the accords below him, captioned with a threat to kill him if a bi-ethnic power-sharing government was installed. The Arusha Accords stipulated the investiture of an interim president and transitional government. As Chief Justice, Kavaruganda was responsible for swearing-in the officials. On the morning of 4 August Habyarimana was sworn in as interim President at the Parliament building, but then suddenly departed before calling up the new prime minister and cabinet to be inaugurated. Confused and surprised, Kavaruganda left. Habyarimana returned that afternoon with a list of new cabinet members to be sworn in from Hutu extremist parties which had not been agreed upon in the Arusha Accords. Having not been formally invited for a second ceremony, Kavaruganda did not appear and the suggested ministers were not sworn-in. Habyarimana was infuriated, and thereafter he and his political allies regarded Kavaruganda as an ally of the RPF.

To assist with implementation of the Arusha Accords, the United Nations established the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda and dispatched an international peacekeeping force to the country. In early February 1994 members of the Interahamwe, a Hutu extremist militia, stoned Kavaruganda&#x27;s car. The following day they stormed the Constitutional Court building, but Kavaruganda and his colleagues escaped through his office window. On 17 February UNAMIR commander Roméo Dallaire learned that an extremist group known as the Death Escadron was planning to assassinate Tutsi politician Lando Ndasingwa and Kavaruganda. In response, Daillaire sent peacekeepers to both men&#x27;s homes to protect them. Kavaruganda, his wife Annonciata, and his two children still living with him felt reassured by their presence.

== Death ==
On 6April 1994, when President Habyarimana&#x27;s plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him and triggering the start of the Rwandan genocide. Hutu extremists planned to eliminate moderate Hutu leaders across Kigali before killing Rwandan Tutsis. Kavaruganda&#x27;s Kigali home was in a neighborhood where numerous government officials lived. Minister of Agriculture Frédéric Nzamurambaho, a moderate Hutu and a neighbor of Kavaruganda, telephoned him shortly after midnight on 7 April to inform him that all MRND members were being evacuated from the neighborhood. Kavaruganda then spoke briefly over the phone with his son, Jean-Marcel, who was in Brussels. Nzamurambaho called again to inform him that members of the Presidential Guard had sealed off the neighborhood, leaving only opposition party members in the area. At dawn gunfire erupted nearby and the family took shelter in their bathrooms. Some time thereafter one of the Ghanaian UN peacekeepers knocked on a window and told Kavaruganda, &quot;There are military men here. They&#x27;ve come to take you away for safekeeping.&quot; Kavaruganda went to the front door where he was met by Captain Kabera of the Presidential Guard, while about 40 Rwandan soldiers stood in the front yard and the UN peacekeepers stood on the terrace. Kabera informed him that he had orders to take him to join the opposition politicians. Stalling for time, Kavaruganda insisted on getting dressed and locked the door. He then telephoned the Belgian UN contingent and Ghanaian and Bangladeshi UN outposts, telling him his family was under attack and he needed help. The UN personnel assured him that they would send reinforcements.

While Kavaruganda waited for help, Jean-Marcel telephoned to say that he heard on Belgian radio that opposition party members in Kigali were being killed and urged his father to leave. While Kavaruganda explained that he was trapped, Kabera&#x27;s men broke down the front door and began searching the house. They found his daughter, Julithe, and put a gun to her head and demanded to know where her father was. She cried to her father for help, and Kavaruganda revealed himself and insisted again on getting dressed. Kabera told him that there was no need to do so and that he had to leave right away. Kabera and the soldiers brought him outside to a waiting truck and drove away with him. The UN peacekeepers watched in the yard and did not resist. He was killed later that day. The remaining soldiers then harassed the family and looted their house before leaving. One of the Hutu-loyalist ministers evacuated during the night, Casimir Bizimungu, returned to the neighborhood soon thereafter to gather some things from his home. Annonciata begged him to take herself, her children, and a neighbor to the Canadian embassy, and he reluctantly did so. They were granted refuge there during the genocide.

<doc id="1298243" wikidata="Q3309707" url="?curid=1298243" title="Hawaiian Punch">
<text>Hawaiian Punch is an American brand of juice currently manufactured by Keurig Dr Pepper, originally invented in 1934 by A.W. Leo, Tom Yeats, and Ralph Harrison as a topping for ice cream. It was started from an original syrup flavor titled Leo&#x27;s Hawaiian Punch, containing orange, pineapple, passion fruit, guava and papaya, and has been available in 14 flavors since 2020. Though earlier versions contained 10% fruit juice, the drink is currently made with 3% fruit juice.

==History==
Leo&#x27;s Hawaiian Punch was created as an ice cream topping syrup in 1934 by A.W. Leo, Tom Yeats, and Ralph Harrison in a converted garage in Fullerton, California. It originally contained 5 fruit juices: orange, pineapple, passion fruit, guava and papaya—all imported from Hawaii. Although customers later discovered that it made an appealing drink when mixed with water, Hawaiian Punch (with &quot;Leo&#x27;s&quot; name omitted) was available only wholesale in gallon glass jugs to ice cream parlors and soda fountains. The original company was named Pacific Citrus Products (PCP). 

In 1946, Reuben P. Hughes purchased the company and renamed it the Pacific Hawaiian Products Company and quickly set about making Hawaiian Punch Base available directly to consumers in 1 quart glass containers. The immediate post-war period saw the introduction of ready-to-serve Hawaiian Punch in 46 oz tins (1950) and frozen concentrate (1955). Sometime around 1954, the brand was expanded to a second flavor, Sunshine Yellow. The original red Hawaiian Punch became the &quot;Rosy&quot; flavor. At that same time, a sixth fruit flavor, apricot puree, was added to the formula. The Sunshine Yellow flavor omitted the orange juice of the original and replaced the original red food coloring with yellow. By 1955, Hawaiian Punch had become a national brand.

R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company bought Pacific Hawaiian in 1962 and later transferred it to its newly acquired Del Monte subsidiary in 1981. At the time, Hawaiian Punch was marketed primarily as a cocktail mixer, but under RJR&#x27;s leadership, the company conducted market research studies to housewives and children and directed marketing to the household market. RJR introduced individual sized 8 ounce cans in 1973 and a powdered form, similar to Kool-Aid, in 1976. By 1978, Hawaiian Punch was available in liquid, frozen concentrate, shelf concentrate, pre-sweetened powder, and unsweetened powder form. In 1983, RJR introduced the first nationally distributed juice box, which increased sales by 35%. 

Procter &amp; Gamble bought Hawaiian Punch from Del Monte Foods, spun off from RJR Nabisco in 1989, a year later. Procter &amp; Gamble sold Hawaiian Punch to Cadbury Schweppes in 1999. Dr Pepper Snapple was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008. In 2018, Dr Pepper Snapple merged with Keurig Green Mountain to become Keurig Dr Pepper.

==Mascot==
In 1961, the Atherton-Privett ad agency created a 20-second commercial to advertise Hawaiian Punch drink. The commercial was produced by John Urie and Associates in Hollywood. Jean Guy Jacques was the director; Bob Guidi and John Urie designed the two characters, Punchy and Oaf. Ross Martin did Punchy&#x27;s voice, &quot;Hey! How &#x27;bout a nice Hawaiian Punch?&quot; and John Urie did Oaf&#x27;s line, &quot;Sure&quot;. Rod Scribner animated the commercials. Sam Cornell also worked on the later versions. Oaf never learned to say &quot;No&quot; and Punchy&#x27;s response was always to punch him. The commercial ended with Punchy leaning on a can of Hawaiian Punch, saying, &quot;Wasn&#x27;t that a refreshing commercial?&quot; The commercial won many awards.

Although the character was introduced prior to RJR&#x27;s ownership, they took it to a new level with &quot;television commercials, magazines, and Sunday comics and on school book covers, toys, clothing, tumblers, and wrist watches&quot; featuring the character marketed to children. The RJR employee magazine stated “[h]is presence on point-of-purchase displays lends instant eye-appeal” and named Punchy “[t]he best salesman the beverage has ever had.&quot; 

The Punchy and Oaf (sometimes known as &quot;Opie&quot;) characters were used in the product&#x27;s commercials well into the 1980s, and again for a period in the early 1990s.

<text>XBin, or eXtended Binary, is a file format for saving IBM PC text mode images.
Essentially an extension to the normal raw-image BIN (raw memory copy of text mode video memory) files, it provides an enhanced means for saving console graphics superior to ANSI graphics.

The format was created by Belgian programmer &quot;Tasmaniac&quot; of ACiD, partly in response to the demand for a solution to save images in the BIN image format, which offered no insight as to the size/width of the image. XBin stores its width information internally so that a programmer or user does not need to define this information more than once, an inherent problem with plain BIN files.

XBin also had several notable features above and beyond that of standard text images saved in ANSI format in that it took further advantage of the text mode environment by (optionally) storing alternate palette color information, supporting modified character set fonts and its own simple compression system.

<text>&quot;Candid Photography&quot;, better known as &quot;Nudge Nudge&quot;, is a sketch from the third &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; episode, &quot;How to Recognise Different Types of Trees From Quite a Long Way Away&quot; (series 1, ep. 3) featuring Eric Idle (author of the sketch) and Terry Jones as two strangers who meet in a pub.

==Sketch description==
Idle (playing a character sometimes referred to as &quot;Arthur Nudge&quot;) sits too close to an unassuming pub patron played by Terry Jones. Idle asks Jones a series of questions about his romantic relationships that seem odd and cryptic, but that are eventually revealed to be complex double entendres. Jones becomes irritated by the line of questioning and asks Idle, directly, what he is implying. Idle forwardly admits that he really wants to know whether Jones has ever &quot;slept with a lady.&quot; When Jones directly answers &quot;Yes,&quot; Idle curiously asks him, &quot;What&#x27;s it like?&quot; This conclusion makes it one of the few Monty Python sketches to end on a clear punch line.

==In other Monty Python material==
The sketch appears in the 1971 spin-off feature film, &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot; and the 1982 concert film &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot;. It was also performed when the Pythons appeared on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; and was recorded for the 1976 concert album &quot;Monty Python Live at City Center&quot;.

In its original airing on &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, the sketch was preceded by a short link in which Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin portray schoolboys being interviewed for television by John Cleese. During the interview, Palin and Jones say they would like to see the sketch that Idle has written.

In &quot;And Now for Something Completely Different&quot;, the sketch is followed by a cut to a scene in a gym, where Terry Gilliam dressed as a nun on an ergometer replies (dubbed by a female voice), &quot;I think it&#x27;s overrated.&quot; Then, the &quot;Self-Defence Against Fresh Fruit&quot; sketch is played in the setting.

Idle&#x27;s character in the pub makes several cameo appearances in later episodes, referred to as &quot;Arthur Name&quot;.

In &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot;, the sketch segues from &quot;Albatross&quot;. In the background, a piano version of &quot;Never Be Rude to an Arab&quot; is heard. Eventually the sketch segues into a new opening title song for &quot;Blackmail&quot; which incorporates samples of Idle&#x27;s &quot;Nudge, Nudge&quot; dialogue.

==History==
Originally written by Eric Idle for Ronnie Barker in another comedy show, the sketch was then rejected as a script. Eric Idle openly admits the script is confusing, the joke being mostly in the delivery.

==Reception==
The phrases, &quot;nudge nudge&quot; and &quot;wink wink&quot;, are part of the English lexicon as idiomatic phrases implying sexual innuendo.

Idle says he learned that Elvis Presley was a fan of the sketch, and would call his friends &quot;squire&quot; in reference to it.

Idle reprised the sketch in TV advertisements for the Breakaway chocolate bar. A reference to this is clearly heard on &quot;Monty Python Live at Drury Lane&quot;, where Idle mentions the product. Idle and Cleese also both advertised the Cadbury Nudge chocolate bar in Australia from 1976.

<doc id="1298264" wikidata="Q1265294" url="?curid=1298264" title="Sankoré Madrasah">
<text>Sankoré Madrasa (also called the Sankoré Mosque, Sankoré Masjid or University of Sankoré) is one of three medieval mosques and centres of learning located in Timbuktu, Mali, the others being the Djinguereber and Sidi Yahya mosques. Founded in the 14th century, the Sankoré mosque went through multiple periods of patronage and renovation under both the Mali Empire and the Songhai Empire until its decline following the Battle of Tondibi in 1591. The mosque developed into a madrasa (meaning a school or college in Arabic), reaching its peak in the 16th century.

The term &quot;University of Sankoré&quot; has sometimes been applied to the Sankoré madrasa, though there is no evidence of a centralized teaching institution such as the term university implies. Instead the mosque served as the focal point for individual scholars with their own private students, and as a location in which some lectures and classes were held.

==History==
The Sankoré mosque was originally built in the 14th-15th centuries with the financial backing of a Tuareg woman of the Aghlal tribe. The mosque was located in the Sankoré quarter of Timbuktu where most of the town&#x27;s Berbers and Arabs lived. The name Sankoré means &#x27;white masters&#x27; or &#x27;white nobles&#x27; in the Songhai language, the term ‘white’ here referring to the light-skinned Sanhaja Berbers, and corresponding to the Arabic term &quot;bidan&quot;.

The Sankore Mosque was later restored between 1578 and 1582 AD by Imam Al-Aqib ibn Mahmud ibn Umar, the Chief Qadi (judge) of Timbuktu. Imam al-Aqib demolished the sanctuary and had it rebuilt with the dimensions of the Kaaba in Mecca. The Sankoré madrasa prospered and became a significant place of learning within the Sudanic Muslim world, especially during the 15th and 16th centuries under Askia dynasty of the Songhai Empire (1493–1591). Sankoré was the mosque that was chiefly associated with teaching in Timbuktu in this period.

===Growth as a center of learning===

Timbuktu developed as a commercial centre in the 14th century as Walata, the previous hub of trans-Saharan trade in the region, began to decline in importance. When Ibn Battuta visited Timbuktu in 1352 he noted that most of the inhabitants belonged to the Massufa tribe of Sanhaja Berbers, but had nothing to say about Islamic learning in the town. A century later, however, the Aqit clan of the Massufa migrated to Timbuktu, bringing with them a deep tradition of learning, especially in Islamic law (&quot;fiqh&quot;). Muslim scholars associated with the Sankoré mosque accumulated a wealth of books from throughout the Muslim world, leading to Sankoré becoming a centre of learning as well as a centre of worship. At its peak the mosque was the focal point for a class of Islamic scholars that were held in high regard both locally and abroad. Songhai kings would even bestow numerous gifts upon them during Ramadan.

=== Apex and fall ===
The golden age of the Sankoré madrasa occurred in the 16th century during the Songhai Empire under Askia Muhammad, drawing in scholars from as far as Egypt and Syria. Scholars from Sankoré would also engage in learning or teaching while completing the Hajj to Mecca. The trade in books within the Islamic world was one of the most important aspects of intellectual life in Timbuktu. In 1526 AD the author Leo Africanus noted this trade when he visited Timbuktu, writing: &quot;Here are great store of doctors, judges, priests, and other learned men, that are bountifully maintained at the kings cost and charges. And hither are brought divers manuscripts or written books out of Barbarie, which are sold for more money than any other merchandize.&quot; Some Sankoré scholars accumulated large private libraries, with over 1600 manuscripts, though there was no public library or university library in Timbuktu. Manuscripts were copied by local students, giving them a means to earn a living during their studies. Works written in Timbuktu were also exported to North Africa, such as the &quot;Nayl al-ibtihaj&quot; by Ahmad Baba, a biographical dictionary of Maliki scholars which gained popularity throughout the Maghreb. 

In 1591 AD, an invasion by Ahmad al-Mansur of Morocco led to the fall of the Songhai empire following the Battle of Tondibi, starting a long decline of the West African states. In 1594 many Sankoré scholars, including Ahmed Baba, were arrested by Moroccan troops on grounds of sedition and deported to Morocco along with their manuscript collections.

=== Modern day ===

The integrity of the Sankoré madrasa has been at risk with increased urbanization and contemporary construction in Timbuktu. Significant damage has been done to the mosque due to flooding and a lack of restoration work. As a result, the integrity of the traditional building is at risk. However, there are currently several restoration and protective committees being funded by the government to prevent further damage. The Management and Conservation Committee of the Old Town, in coordination with the World Heritage Center, held long term plans to create a 500 foot buffer zone to protect the madrasa and create a sustainable urban development framework.

==Organization==
=== Academic administration ===

As the center of an Islamic scholarly community, the madrasa was very different in organization from European medieval universities, where students studied in one institution and were awarded degrees by the college. In contrast, the Sankoré madrasa had no central administration, student registers, or prescribed course of study. The school instead consisted of individual scholars (known as sheiks or ulama), each with their own private students. Most students learned from a single teacher throughout their entire education, which could last up to 10 years, having a relationship akin to that of an apprenticeship, though some studied at multiple madrasas under a series of teachers. Classes were held either at the mosque or at the teacher&#x27;s home. While madrasas in other parts of the Islamic world were often funded through endowments known as waqf (charitable giving), students at the Sankoré madrasa had to finance their own tuition with money or bartered goods.

=== Architecture ===
The late 16th-century courtyard was reconstructed to exactly match the dimensions of the Kaaba in Mecca, one of Islam&#x27;s most holy sites. Classes took place in the open courtyard of the mosque, which was made entirely of clay and wood beams. The building still stands today, likely due to Al-Sahili&#x27;s directive to incorporate a wooden framework in the construction of mud walls in order to facilitate repairs after the rainy season. Despite its historical significance the Sankoré mosque was smaller and less intricate than earlier Malian mosques such as the Great Mosque of Djenné.

Modern analyses have rejected the idea that al-Sahili introduced or invented the &#x27;Sudano-Sahelian&#x27; style of architecture itself.

== Course of study ==
Islamic schooling had existed in West Africa since the 11th century, and although it was usually intended for elites, the Qur’anic emphasis on equality in education allowed for the spread of the institution and increased literacy rates. The Qur&#x27;an itself and the hadiths stress the search for knowledge, and Islamic scholarship, especially in the Golden Age of Islam, focused heavily on education. In the 15th century the scholar Al-Kābarī contributed to the development of education in Timbuktu, with a focus on religious teachings. By the 16th century Timbuktu housed as many as 150–180 Qur&#x27;anic schools, which taught basic literacy and recitation of the Qur&#x27;an, with an estimated 4,000–9,000 students. Around 200–300 individuals drawn from wealthy families were able to pursue higher levels of study at the madrasas and attain the status of &quot;ulama&quot; (scholars). Some of these became influential jurists, historians and theologians in the wider muslim world. 

With the Qur&#x27;an being the foundation of all teachings, arguments that could not be backed by the Qur&#x27;an were inadmissible in discussions and debates at the Sankoré madrasa. Madrasas differed from traditional Qur’anic schools in that they focused on Arabic grammar to properly understand holy texts and Islamic scholarship. However, subjects studied at Sankoré also included mathematics, astronomy and history, drawing from the diverse collections of manuscripts held by scholars. Education at Sankoré and other madrasas in the area had four levels of schooling or &quot;degrees&quot;. When graduating from each level, students would receive a turban symbolizing their level.

=== Degrees of study ===
The first or primary degree (Qur&#x27;anic school) required a mastery of Arabic and writing along with complete memorization of the Qur&#x27;an. 

The secondary degree focused on full immersion in the basic sciences. Students learned grammar, mathematics, geography, history, physics, astronomy, chemistry alongside more advanced learning of the Qur&#x27;an. At this level, they learned the &quot;hadiths&quot;, jurisprudence, and the sciences of spiritual purification according to Islam. Finally, they began an introduction to trade and business ethics. On graduation day, students were given turbans symbolizing divine light, wisdom, knowledge and excellent moral conduct. 

The superior degree required students to study under specialized professors and to complete research work. Much of the learning centered on debates regarding philosophic or religious questions. Before graduating from this level, students attached themselves to a Sheik (Islamic teacher) and had to demonstrate a strong character.

===Senior roles===
The last level of learning at Sankoré or any masjid was the level of judge or professor. These men worked mainly as judges for the city and throughout the region, dispersing learned men to all the principal cities in Mali. A third level student who had impressed his Sheik enough was admitted into a &quot;circle of knowledge&quot; and valued as a truly learned individual and expert in his field. The members of this scholar&#x27;s club similar to the modern concept of tenured professors. Those who did not leave Timbuktu remained to teach or counsel the leading people of the region on important legal and religious matters. The scholars would receive questions from the region&#x27;s kings or governors, and distribute them to the third level students as research assignments. After discussing the findings among themselves, the scholars would issue a fatwa on the best way to deal with the problem at hand.

==Scholars ==
Scholars at Sankoré were reputedly of the highest quality, &quot;astounding even the most learned men of Islam&quot;, according to Felix Dubois. Some scholars were later inducted as professors at universities in Morocco and Egypt. Scholars were accomplished in multiple disciplines and employed to not only teach the students at the university, but to spread the madrasa&#x27;s influence to other parts of the Islamic world. 

=== Notable scholars ===
Some significant scholars include Abu Abdallah, Ag Mohammed ibn Utman, Ag Mohammed Ibn Al-Mukhtar An-Nawahi. Most came from wealthy and religious families that were members of the Sufi Qadiriyya. The most influential scholar was Ahmad Baba who served as the final chancellor of Sankoré Madrasa. His life is a brilliant example of the range and depth of intellectual activity in the Sahel before European colonialism. He was the author of over forty books, with nearly each one having a different theme. He was also one of the first citizens to protest the Moroccan conquest of Timbuktu in 1591. Eventually, he, along with his peer scholars, was imprisoned and exiled to Morocco. This led to the loss of his personal collection of 1600 books, which was one of the richest libraries of his day.

=== Religious pilgrimage ===
Apart from their time working in their theoretical studies and the preservation of knowledge, the scholars of Timbuktu were extremely pious. Many embarked on the Hajj, the religious pilgrimage to Mecca, and used this opportunity to hold discussions with scholars from other parts of the Muslim world. On the way home, the scholars showed their humble nature by both learning from other leading scholars in Cairo, and volunteering to teach pupils of other schools in Kano, Katsina, and Walata. Mohammed Bagayogo received an honorary doctorate in Cairo on his holy pilgrimage to Mecca.

<text>Charles Clarence Robert Orville Cummings (June 9, 1910 – December 2, 1990) was an American film and television actor who appeared in roles in comedy films such as &quot;The Devil and Miss Jones&quot; (1941) and &quot;Princess O&#x27;Rourke&quot; (1943), and in dramatic films, especially two of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s thrillers, &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942) and &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954). He received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations, and won the Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Single Performance in 1955. On February 8, 1960, he received two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the motion picture and television industries, at 6816 Hollywood Boulevard and 1718 Vine Street. He used the stage name Robert Cummings from mid-1935 until the end of 1954 and was credited as Bob Cummings from 1955 until his death.

==Early life==
Cummings was born in Joplin, Missouri, a son of Dr. Charles Clarence Cummings and the former Ruth Annabelle Kraft. His father was a surgeon, part of the original medical staff of St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Joplin, and the founder of the Jasper County Tuberculosis Hospital in Webb City, Missouri. Cummings&#x27;s mother was an ordained minister of the Science of Mind.

While attending Joplin High School, Cummings learned to fly. His first solo flight was on March 3, 1927. Some reports of his learning to fly refer to Orville Wright, the aviation pioneer, as being his godfather and flight instructor. However, these reports appear to be based on either media interviews of Cummings or other anecdotal references. There is no historical record of Orville Wright having traveled to Joplin, Missouri, either around the time of the gestation or the birth of Cummings, or during 1927, the year Cummings learned to fly. Cummings, born in 1910, would have only been 8 years old when Orville Wright had essentially stopped flying on May 13, 1918, as a result of injuries he sustained in an accident at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 17, 1908. The report that Orville Wright taught Cummings to fly is also contradicted by Cummings&#x27; interview reported in the March 1960 &quot;Flying&quot; magazine. In the interview, Cummings described how he learned to fly &quot;by trial and error, mostly error&quot; during 3 hours of instruction from a Joplin, Missouri, plumber named Cooper before he soloed on March 3, 1927. During high school, Cummings gave Joplin residents rides in his aircraft for $5 per person.

When the government began licensing flight instructors, Cummings was issued flight instructor certificate No. 1, making him the first official flight instructor in the United States.

===Education===
Cummings studied briefly at Drury College in Springfield, Missouri, but his love of flying caused him to transfer to the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh. He studied aeronautical engineering for a year before he dropped out for financial reasons, his family having lost heavily in the 1929 stock market crash.

Cummings became interested in acting while performing in plays at Carnegie Tech, and decided to pursue it as a career. Since the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City paid its male actors $14 a week, Cummings decided to study there. He stayed only one season, but later said he learned &quot;three basic principles of acting. The first – never anticipate; second – take pride in my profession. And third – trust in God. And that last is said in reverence.&quot;

==Career==
===Blade Stanhope Conway===
Cummings started looking for work in 1930, but couldn&#x27;t find any roles, forcing him to get a job at a theatrical agency. Realizing that, at the time, &quot;three quarters of Broadway plays were from England&quot; and that English accents and actors were in demand, Cummings decided to cash in an insurance policy and buy a round-trip ticket there.

He was driving a motorbike through the countryside, picking up the accent and learning about the country, when his bike broke down at Harrogate. While waiting for repairs, he devised a plan. He invented the name &quot;Blade Stanhope Conway&quot; and bribed the janitor of a local theatre to put on the marquee: &quot;Blade Stanhope Conway in &quot;Candida&quot;&quot;. He then had a photo taken of himself in front of the marquee and had 80 prints made. In London, he outfitted himself with a new wardrobe, composed a letter introducing the actor-author-manager-director &quot;Blade&quot; of Harrogate Repertory Theatre, and sent it off to 80 New York theatrical agents and producers.

As a result, when Cummings returned to New York, he was able to obtain several meetings.

One of the producers to whom he sent letters, Charles Hopkings, cast him in a production of &quot;The Roof&quot; by John Galsworthy, playing the role of the Hon. Reggie Fanning. Also in the cast was Henry Hull. The play ran from October to November 1931 and Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; listed &quot;Conway&quot; among the cast who provided &quot;some excellent bits of acting&quot;.

In November 1932, &quot;Conway&quot; replaced Edwin Styles in the Broadway revue &quot;Earl Carroll&#x27;s Vanities&quot; after studying song and dance by correspondence course.

Cummings later encouraged an old drama school classmate, Margaret Kies, to use a similar deception – she became the &quot;British&quot; Margaret Lindsay. He later said pretending to be Conway broke up his first marriage, to a girl from Joplin. &quot;She couldn&#x27;t stand me.&quot;

He was an extra in the Laurel and Hardy comedy film &quot;Sons of the Desert&quot; (1933) and in the musical short &quot;Seasoned Greetings&quot; (1933).

===Bryce Hutchens===
Cummings decided to change his approach, when in the words of one report, &quot;suddenly the bottom dropped out of the John Bull market; almost overnight, demand switched from Londoners to lassoers.&quot;

In 1934, Cummings changed his name to &quot;Bryce Hutchens&quot;. He appeared under this name in the &quot;Ziegfeld Follies of 1934&quot;, which ran from January to June in 1934. He had a duet with Vivi Janiss, a native of Nebraska, with whom he sang &quot;I Like the Likes of You&quot;. Cummings and Janiss went with the show when it went on tour after the Broadway run, and they married towards the end of the tour.

===Paramount===
The tour of &quot;Ziegfeld&quot; ended in Los Angeles in January 1935. Cummings enjoyed the city and wanted to move there. He returned to New York, then heard King Vidor was looking for Texan actors for &quot;So Red the Rose&quot; (1935). Cummings auditioned, pretending to be a Texan, having acquired his own version of a Texan accent by listening to cowboy bands on the radio. His ruse was exposed, but Vidor nevertheless cast Cummings under his actual name. In their review, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Cummings &quot;does a fine bit&quot; and &quot;has the only convincing accent in the whole film.&quot;

He followed this with a part in Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The Virginia Judge&quot; (1935). In July, the studio signed Cummings to a long-term contract. Before his first two Paramount films were released, he was also cast in a supporting role in &quot;Millions in the Air&quot; (1935).

Cummings appeared as one of the leads in the Western &quot;Desert Gold&quot; (1936), then had a supporting role in &quot;Forgotten Faces&quot; (1936) and a starring role in &quot;Three Cheers for Love&quot; (1936). He also appeared in: 
: &quot;Beyond Flight&quot; (1936)
:&quot;Hollywood Boulevard&quot; (1936)
: &quot;The Accusing Finger&quot; (1936)
: &quot;Hideaway Girl&quot; (1936)
: &quot;Arizona Mahoney&quot; (1936)
: &quot;The Last Train from Madrid&quot; (1937).

Most of these were B pictures. He had a small role in an A picture, &quot;Souls at Sea&quot; (1937), then appeared in &quot;Sophie Lang Goes West&quot; (1937), &quot;Wells Fargo&quot; (1937) and &quot;College Swing&quot; (1938). 
He had a small role in &quot;You and Me&quot; (1938) (directed by Fritz Lang), and was in &quot;The Texans&quot; (1938) and &quot;Touchdown, Army&quot; (1938).

Eventually, Paramount dropped their option on him. &quot;I was poison&quot;, he said. &quot;No agent would look at me.&quot; In June, Paramount announced he would return for &quot;King of Chinatown&quot; with Anna May Wong, but he does not appear in the final film. In September he was cast at Republic, playing the lead in the crime movie &quot;I Stand Accused&quot; (1938). Cummings said it was &quot;...a fluke hit—so at least I could get inside the casting agents again.&quot;

===Universal===
In November 1938, Cummings auditioned for the romantic lead in &quot;Three Smart Girls Grow Up&quot; (1939), starring Deanna Durbin, for producer Joe Pasternak. Pasternak was reluctant to cast him, preferring to find a musician, but Cummings told him, &quot;I could fake it&quot;. He later said, &quot;I&#x27;d had a lot of experience faking things harder than that. He let me try it and he signed me up.&quot;

On 21 November Universal gave Cummings an option on a seven-year contract starting at $600 a week, going up to $750 a week the following year, then ultimately up to $3,000 a week. His first film for them, &quot;Three Smart Girls Grow Up&quot; (1939) was a big success, and in March 1939 Universal took up their options on the actor. The film was directed by Henry Koster, who called Cummings &quot;brilliant, wonderful… I made five pictures with him. I thought he was the best leading man I ever worked with. He had that marvelous comedy talent and also a romantic quality.&quot; Reviewing the film, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Cummings &quot;displays a really astonishing talent for light comedy—we never should have suspected it from his other pictures.&quot; &quot;Filmink&quot; wrote &quot;Cummings found himself as an actor&quot; with this movie.

Pasternak used him again, supporting another singing star, Gloria Jean, in &quot;The Under-Pup&quot; (1939). (He was meant to reteam with Jean in &quot;Straight from the Heart&quot;, but it appears not to have been made.) In August 1939 Columbia wanted him for the lead in &quot;Golden Boy,&quot; but could not come to terms with Universal. Cummings supported Basil Rathbone and Victor McLaglen in &quot;Rio&quot; (1939), then was borrowed by 20th Century Fox to romance Sonia Henie in &quot;Everything Happens at Night&quot; (1939). At Universal he had a key role in &quot;Charlie McCarthy, Detective&quot; (1939), then was borrowed by MGM to play the lead in a B movie with Laraine Day, &quot;And One Was Beautiful&quot; (1940). Back at Universal, Cummings was the romantic male lead in a comedy, &quot;Private Affairs&quot; (1940); then he romanced Durbin again in &quot;Spring Parade&quot; (1940). Cummings made his mark in the CBS Radio network&#x27;s dramatic serial titled &quot;Those We Love&quot;, which ran from 1938 to 1945. He also played the role of David Adair in the serial drama &quot;Those We Love&quot;, opposite Richard Cromwell, Francis X. Bushman and Nan Grey.

====A series of classic films====
Cummings and Allan Jones were cast as the comic leads in the film &quot;One Night in the Tropics&quot; (1940), but they were overshadowed by the performances (as supporting actors, in their first film) of Abbott and Costello.

MGM borrowed Cummings a second time, to play opposite Ruth Hussey in &quot;Free and Easy&quot; (1941). In the same period, he was borrowed by a company established by Norman Krasna and Frank Ross, who were making a comedy from a script by Krasna for release through RKO: &quot;The Devil and Miss Jones&quot; (1941). Cummings played a union leader, Jean Arthur&#x27;s love interest, under the direction of Sam Wood. Cummings shot the film at the same time as &quot;Free and Easy&quot;. &quot;Free and Easy&quot; lost money for MGM, but &quot;Devil and Miss Jones&quot; was a critical and commercial success. 20th Century Fox borrowed him for &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot; (1941), starring Don Ameche and Betty Grable; Fox was willing to postpone the film so Cummings could finish &quot;Devil and Miss Jones&quot;. 

In January 1941 Louella Parsons wrote, &quot;Is that boy going places in 1941. From the looks of things it&#x27;s a Cummings year – because all his troubles with Universal are ironed out and almost every studio in town wants to borrow him.&quot; Back at Universal, Pasternak used Cummings as the romantic male lead in &quot;It Started with Eve&quot; (1941), from a script by Krasna opposite Deanna Durbin and Charles Laughton. Meanwhile, Sam Wood was directing an adaptation of the novel &quot;Kings Row&quot; (1942) over at Warner Bros, where the head of production was Hal Wallis. Wallis did not have any contract players at Warner Bros who were considered ideal for the role of Paris, and after trying desperately to get Tyrone Power, he tried to borrow Cummings, who had done an impressive screen test. However, Cummings was busy on &quot;It Started with Eve&quot; and the actor had to drop out. Then the schedule was rearranged and Cummings was able to make both films. Production of &quot;Kings Row&quot; did have to be suspended for a week so Cummings could return to Universal to do reshoots for &quot;Eve&quot;. Both films were huge successes. Hal Wallis said Cummings &quot;was actually too old for the part&quot; in &quot;Kings Row&quot; &quot;not quite right, but he was helped considerably by an extraordinary support cast.&quot; 

Back at Universal, Cummings starred in the Alfred Hitchcock spy thriller &quot;Saboteur&quot; (1942), made at Universal, with Priscilla Lane and Norman Lloyd. He played Barry Kane, an aircraft worker wrongfully accused of espionage, trying to clear his name. In December 1941, John Chapman said Cummings was among &quot;the most sought-after leading men in town&quot; and was one of his &quot;stars for 1942&quot;. &quot;Filmink&quot; wrote &quot;Few male actors had a hot streak like Robert Cummings from 1941 to 1942: &quot;The Devil and Miss Jones&quot;, &quot;It Started with Eve&quot;, &quot;King’s Row&quot; and &quot;Saboteur&quot; are all stone-cold classics, and he made crucial contributions to all.&quot;

Universal announced Cummings for &quot;Boy Meets Baby&quot; with Deanna Durbin, which became &quot;Between Us Girls&quot; (1942) with Diana Barrymore. He filmed it concurrently with a Hal Wallis movie at Warner Bros titled &quot;Princess O&#x27;Rourke&quot; (made 1942, released 1943), Norman Krasna&#x27;s directorial debut. Cummings was meant to be in &quot;We&#x27;ve Never Been Licked&quot; (1943) for Walter Wanger at Universal, but did not appear in the film.

====World War II====
In December 1941, Cummings joined the fledgling Civil Air Patrol, an organization of citizens and pilots interested in helping support the U.S. war effort. In February 1942, he helped establish Squadron 918-4 located in Glendale, California, at the Grand Central Air Terminal, becoming its first commanding officer. Two weeks later, he and other members of the squadron went in search of the Japanese submarine that had attacked the oil refinery at Goleta, California. During the war, Cummings participated in search and rescue missions, courier missions, and border and forestry patrols around the Western United States. For this work he used his own aircraft, Spinach I, a 1936 Porterfield, and Spinach II, a Cessna 165 Airmaster. The squadron he established still operates as San Fernando Senior Squadron 35 and is based at Whiteman Airport in Pacoima, Los Angeles. In November 1942, Cummings joined the United States Army Air Forces. During World War II, he served as a flight instructor. After the war, Cummings served as a pilot in the United States Air Force Reserve, where he achieved the rank of captain. Cummings played aircraft pilots in several of his postwar film roles. During the war service, he had small roles in the all-star &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943) and &quot;Flesh and Fantasy&quot; (1943), but he was effectively off screen for two years.

====Suspension from Universal====
Cummings was meant to be in &quot;Fired Wife&quot; with Teresa Wright, Charles Coburn, and Eddie Anderson and a director &quot;comparable with&quot; Leo McCarey. However, when he found out these actors would not be in the film, and the director would be Charles Lamont, he refused to be in it. (Filming began in April 1943 with Robert Paige taking Cummings&#x27;s role.) Universal put him on suspension for five weeks, refused to give him a new part, or pay his weekly salary of $1,500 after the suspension had been lifted. Cummings notified the studio in May 1943 that he considered himself no longer under contract. In September 1943, Cummings sued the studio for withheld wages of $10,700, also arguing that for some time, Universal tried to put him in minor roles to &quot;run him ragged&quot; and &quot;to teach him a lesson&quot;. In March 1944, the court ruled in Cummings&#x27;s favor, saying Universal had voided its contract with the actor and owed him $10,700. This decision happened in the same fortnight as another court case involving Olivia de Havilland, which also ruled in the actor&#x27;s favor.

===Freelance star===
====Hal Wallis====
Cummings was considered free of Universal since August 1944. In January he signed a four-year exclusive contract with Hal Wallis, who had left Warner Brothers to become an independent producer. Shortly after, he took leave from the Air Force to star in &quot;You Came Along&quot; (1945) for Hal Wallis, directed by John Farrow with a screenplay by Ayn Rand. The Army Air Forces pilot Cummings played, Bob Collins, died off camera, but was resurrected 10 years later for Cummings&#x27;s television show. Cummings was under contract to Wallis for four years. Also for Wallis—who had now moved to Paramount—he did &quot;The Bride Wore Boots&quot; (1946), a comedy with Barbara Stanwyck. He was announced for &quot;Dishonorable Discharge&quot; for Wallis from a story by John Farrow, but it appears to have not been made. Neither was &quot;Its Love Love Love&quot;, which was announced by RKO, or &quot;Dream Puss&quot;, which Wallis announced for Cummings at Paramount.

In 1946, Cummings said, &quot;Often I play the boyfriend of a girl young enough to be my daughter. I&#x27;m 36, and whenever I start drooping, I run one of my pictures and feel like a kid again.&quot; Around this time, he also said he was more interested in producing and directing, and hoped to act in only one film per year.

====United California Productions====
Cummings had the leads in two films for Nero Films, a production company run by Seymour Nebenzal and Eugene Frenke, who released through United Artists: a film noir, &quot;The Chase&quot; (1946); and a Western, &quot;Heaven Only Knows&quot; (1947).

Cummings decided to form his own production company with Frenke and Philip Yordan, which they called United California. (They originally called it United World, but it was too similar to another company&#x27;s name.) In December 1946, it was announced that Cummings had signed an exclusive contract with United California Productions, and that his deal with Wallis was for one film a year for seven years. They announced &quot;Bad Guy&quot; from a script by Yordan. They were also going to do &quot;Joe MacBeth&quot; (which was ultimately made by others).

In 1947, Cummings had reportedly earned $110,000 in the preceding 12 months. &quot;The Lost Moment&quot; (1947) with Susan Hayward was a film noir for Walter Wanger at Universal based on &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; by Henry James. It was a resounding flop at the box office. Cummings was initially meant to follow it with &quot;The Big Curtain&quot; for Edward Alperson at Fox but that picture was never produced.

Cummings appeared in &quot;Sleep, My Love&quot; (1948), another noir, directed by Douglas Sirk and produced by Mary Pickford.

United California eventually brought in manufacturer Frank Hale as partner. Its first film, &quot;Let&#x27;s Live a Little&quot; (1948), was a romantic comedy with Hedy Lamarr, released through United Artists.

Cummings announced a series of projects for United California: &quot;Ho the Fair Wind&quot; from a novel by IAR Wylie, &quot;The Glass Heart&quot; by Mary Holland, &quot;Poisonous Paradise&quot; (a docudrama for which some footage had been shot called &quot;Jungle&quot;), &quot;Passport to Love&quot; by Howard Irving Young, and a remake of &quot;Two Hearts in Three Quarter Time&quot;. Cummings was also trying to interest Norman Krasna into writing the story of how Cummings broke into acting, to be called &quot;Pardon My Accent&quot;.

Cummings did the melodrama &quot;The Accused&quot; (1949) for Hal Wallis at Paramount, supporting Loretta Young.

&quot;Reign of Terror&quot; (1949) was a thriller set in the French Revolution for director Anthony Mann; Eagle Lion co-produced with United California.

Cummings did a comedy at Universal, &quot;Free for All&quot; (1949).

====Columbia====
In July 1949, Cummings signed a three-picture deal with Columbia. He made &quot;Tell It to the Judge&quot; (1949), with Rosalind Russell, for them. He did one for Wallis at Paramount, &quot;Paid in Full&quot; (1950) (originally &quot;Bitter Victory&quot;), then went back to Columbia for &quot;The Petty Girl&quot; (1950) a musical with Joan Caulfield.

Cummings did announce he would make &quot;The Glass Heart&quot; for his own company and release through Columbia, but this did not happen.

Cummings supported Clifton Webb in &quot;For Heaven&#x27;s Sake&quot; (1950) at Fox, then played a con man in &quot;The Barefoot Mailman&quot; (1950), his third film for Columbia.

Cummings began working in television, appearing in &quot;Sure as Fate&quot; (&quot;Run from the Sun&quot;) and &quot;Somerset Maugham TV Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Luncheon&quot;).

He was in a Broadway play &quot;Faithfully Yours&quot; (originally &quot;The Philemon Complex&quot;), which had a short run in late 1951. In November 1951 he announced he only had one more Columbia commitment and was open to doing more theatre.

At Columbia, he was in &quot;The First Time&quot; (1952), the first feature directed by Frank Tashlin. On TV, he was in &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Shiny People&quot;, &quot;Pattern for Glory&quot;), &quot;Betty Crocker Star Matinee&quot; (&quot;Sense of Humor&quot;), and &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot; (&quot;Lila My Love&quot;).

Cummings was one of the four stars featured in the short-run radio version of &quot;Four Star Playhouse&quot;.

He was offered &quot;Battle in Spain&quot;, the story of El Cid, with Linda Darnell, but turned it down because it was too controversial.

===Television star===
====&quot;My Hero&quot;====
Cummings starred in his first regular television series in the comedy &quot;My Hero&quot; (1952–53), playing a bumbling real estate salesman. He also wrote and directed some episodes. The series ran for 33 episodes before (it was reported) Cummings decided to end it and accept other offers. In reality, the show had been axed. &quot;After it was dropped, I was as dead as you could possibly get in show business&quot; said Cummings. &quot;I sat in my agent&#x27;s office one day and heard a top producer tell him on the phone that nobody would buy me.&quot; Out of work, he accepted the State Department&#x27;s invitation to go on a goodwill mission to Argentina. The show earned him an Emmy nomination.

Cummings was in &quot;Marry Me Again&quot; (1953) at RKO for Tashlin, then went to England to star in another Hitchcock film, &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954), playing the lover of Grace Kelly, whose husband Ray Milland tries to kill her. The film was a hit.

Cummings then supported Doris Day in a musical at Warner Bros, &quot;Lucky Me&quot; (1954).

He was chosen by producer John Wayne as his co-star to play airline pilot Captain Sullivan in &quot;The High and the Mighty&quot;, partly due to Cummings&#x27;s flying experience; however, director William A. Wellman overruled Wayne and hired Robert Stack for the part.

====&quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;====
In 1954, Cummings appeared in &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, an original TV play for &quot;Westinghouse Studio One&quot; written by Reginald Rose and directed by Franklin Schaffner, alongside actors including Franchot Tone and Edward Arnold. Cummings played Juror Number Eight, the role taken by Henry Fonda in the feature-film adaptation. Cummings&#x27;s performance earned him the 1955 Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Single Performance. 

Other television appearances included &quot;Campbell Summer Soundstage&quot; (&quot;The Test Case&quot;), &quot;Justice&quot; (&quot;The Crisis&quot;), &quot;The Elgin Hour&quot; (&quot;Floodtide&quot;), and a TV version of &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot; (1954).

====Laurel Productions and &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot;====


In July 1954, Cummings formed his own independent film production company, Laurel Productions, Incorporated. The company&#x27;s name had several affiliations to Cummings: his youngest daughter was named Laurel Ann Cummings; the street he and his family lived on was named Laurel Way; his wife&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s name was Laurel; and finally, the fact that Laurel &amp; Hardy had given Cummings his film debut back in 1933. His wife Mary Elliott was appointed president of Laurel Productions. In July 1954, Cummings filmed the pilot for his television show, &quot;The Bob Cummings Show,&quot; and would go on to produce 173 episodes. 

Cummings intended to produce a film titled &quot;The Damned&quot; through Laurel Productions, from a novel by John D. MacDonald and to be written and directed by Frank Tashlin. In December 1954, Cummings and George Burns formed Laurmac Productions, with the hope of co-producing a feature film in May 1955.

In January 1955, &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; began airing, and went through 1959. Cummings starred on the successful NBC sitcom, &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; (known as &quot;Love That Bob&quot; in reruns), where he played Bob Collins, a former World War II pilot who became a successful professional photographer. The character, a bachelor in 1950s Los Angeles, considered himself quite the ladies&#x27; man. The sitcom was noted for some very risqué humor for its time. Reviewing the show, &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;few video performers are as infectious as Bob Cummings&quot; calling the sitcom &quot;a combination of corn, slapstick and sex. If it took itself seriously, it&#x27;d bomb bigger than Bikini. But everybody acts as though he&#x27;s improvising on a camp picnic.&quot;

A popular feature of the program was Cummings&#x27;s portrayal of his elderly grandfather. His co-stars were Rosemary DeCamp as his sister Margaret MacDonald; Dwayne Hickman as his nephew Chuck MacDonald; Lyle Talbot as his old Air Force buddy Paul Fonda, and Ann B. Davis, in her first television success, as his assistant Charmaine &quot;Schultzy&quot; Schultz.

When Cummings appeared on the NBC interview program &quot;Here&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, he was seen by Nunnally Johnson, who cast him opposite Betty Grable in &quot;How to Be Very, Very Popular&quot; (1955) at Fox, which turned out to be Grable&#x27;s last film. Cummings&#x27;s contract was amended to allow him time off to rehearse and record his TV show.

Around this time, Cummings said he had made 78 films, and &quot;I always had the feeling I was distinguished for none of them. Hollywood&#x27;s never been really hot about me. I was always second choice. I used to say to my wife Mary, &#x27;Somebody&#x27;s got to be sick someday – Bill Holden or maybe some boy not even born yet! I used to say &#x27;If I could find another business where I could be successful!&#x27;.&quot;

Cummings was one of the hosts on ABC&#x27;s live broadcast of the opening day of Disneyland on July 17, 1955, along with Ronald Reagan and Art Linkletter. On that day, Cummings played off his playboy character image by being “caught” embracing and kissing a young woman in a bonnet with a stricken look on her face.

Cummings&#x27;s performance in &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; earned him another Emmy nomination for Best Actor in a Continuous Role in 1956.

He turned down &quot;The Heavenly Twins&quot; for the Theatre Guild; and was mentioned for &quot;Bewitched&quot; by Charles Bennett in England, but did not do it.

During the series&#x27; production, Cummings still found time to play other roles. He returned to &quot;Studio One&quot; (&quot;A Special Announcement&quot;), and did episodes of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot; (&quot;Too Good with a Gun&quot;), &quot;The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show&quot;, and &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; (&quot;One Left Over&quot;, &quot;Dual Control&quot;).

He was also in &quot;Bomber&#x27;s Moon&quot; for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (1958), from a Rod Serling script directed by John Frankenheimer, who said &quot;Bobby&#x27;s a really fine dramatic actor, but people usually associate him only with comedy. Naturally enough I suppose. Directing an actor like this who feels immediately what the script wants and what the director wants makes you love this business.&quot;

&quot;It&#x27;s a great life, acting&quot;, Cummings said in 1959. &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way. I&#x27;m a completely content actor.&quot;

When his TV show ended in 1959, Cummings claimed it was his decision, as he was tired and wanted to take a year off. He was also keen to sell the show into syndication. &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do another comedy&quot;, he said. The show had been very lucrative for him.

In 1960, Cummings starred in &quot;King Nine Will Not Return&quot;, the opening episode of the second season of CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, written by Serling and directed by Buzz Kulik.

He guested on &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot; (&quot;The Last Bugle&quot;, directed by Budd Boetticher), &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot; (&quot;The Action in New Orleans&quot;), &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot; (&quot;Last of the Private Eyes&quot;, co-starring Ronald Reagan), and &quot;The Great Adventure&quot; (&quot;Plague&quot;).

====&quot;The New Bob Cummings Show&quot;====
&quot;The New Bob Cummings Show&quot; followed on CBS for one season, from 1961 to 1962. It was a variation of &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; with Cummings as a pilot who had various adventures. It ran for 22 episodes before being cancelled.

Cummings returned to films with a supporting role in &quot;My Geisha&quot; (1962), written by Krasna. &quot;Variety&quot; called the actor &quot;astonishingly youthful&quot; and said &quot;it&#x27;s nice to see him back on the theatre screen.&quot;

He was top-billed in &quot;Beach Party&quot; (1963), although the film is better remembered today for first teaming Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. In its review of the film &quot;Variety&quot; wrote &quot;Cummings shows himself to be amenable farceur and notably at ease. in surroundings which might embarrass a less professional star.&quot;

Cummings had supporting roles in two popular films, &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1964) with George Peppard and Alan Ladd and &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot; (1964) with Shirley MacLaine, and was in &quot;Theatre of Stars&quot; (&quot;The Square Peg&quot;).

Also in 1964, he was a guest as a beauty pageant judge in &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; episode, &quot;The Race for Queen&quot;.

====&quot;My Living Doll&quot;====

In 1964–65, Cummings starred in another CBS sitcom, &quot;My Living Doll&quot;, co-starring Julie Newmar as Rhoda the robot and Jack Mullaney as his friend. After 21 episodes, Cummings asked to be written out of the show. It lasted five more episodes.

===Later career===

In the late 1960s, Cummings had supporting roles in &quot;The Carpetbaggers&quot; (1964), &quot;Promise Her Anything&quot; (1966) and the remake of &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1966) (playing the bank embezzler).

Cummings had the lead in &quot;Five Golden Dragons&quot; (1967) for producer Harry Alan Towers and supported in &quot;Gidget Grows Up&quot; (1969).

He was in another Broadway play, &quot;The Wayward Stork&quot;, which had a short run in early 1966. A review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Cummings &quot;is not in top form. He sounded a bit hoarse and somewhat strained. Usually he is a quite , breezy farceur.&quot;

He guest-starred again on &quot;Theatre of Stars&quot; (&quot;Blind Man&#x27;s Bluff&quot;), as well as &quot;The Flying Nun&quot; (&quot;Speak the Speech, I Pray You&quot;), &quot;Green Acres&quot; (&quot;Rest and Relaxation&quot;), &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; (&quot;The She-Bear&quot;), &quot;Arnie&quot; (&quot;Hello, Holly&quot;), &quot;Bewitched&quot; (&quot;Samantha and the Troll&quot;), &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; (&quot;Lucy&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot;, &quot;Lucy and Her Genuine Twimby&quot;), and several episodes of &quot;Love, American Style&quot;.

Cummings&#x27;s last lead roles on film were in a pair of TV movies, &quot;The Great American Beauty Contest&quot; (1973) and &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; (1973).

During the 1970s for over 10 years, Cummings traveled the US performing in dinner theaters and short stints in plays while living in an Airstream travel trailer.

He relayed those experiences in the written introduction he provided for the book &quot;Airstream&quot; written by Robert Landau and James Phillippi in 1984.

Cummings had a cameo in &quot;Three on a Date&quot; (1978) and appeared in 1979 as Elliott Smith, the father of Fred Grandy&#x27;s Gopher on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Love Boat&quot;.

In 1986, Cummings hosted the 15th-anniversary celebration of Walt Disney World on &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot;.

In 1987, he said, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t mind living until I&#x27;m 110. I still swim, do calisthenics, and keep fit. I&#x27;ve never been in hospital, except for a hernia operation at one time. People laugh about my using so many vitamins. When I tell them I take 50 liver pills a day, they look surprised, but whether they laugh or not, the thing works.&quot; He added, &quot;I&#x27;m retired, I live on a pension&quot; and &quot;if I have a problem I get expert counsel, then ask the opinion of a good psychic.&quot;

Robert Cummings&#x27;s last public appearance was on &quot;The Magical World of Disney&quot; episode &quot;The Disneyland 35th Anniversary Special&quot; in 1990.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Cummings was married five times and fathered seven children. His first marriage was to Emma Myers, a girl from his hometown. His second marriage was to Vivi Janiss, an actress he met while performing in &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;. His third wife, Mary Elliott, was a former actress and she ran Cummings&#x27;s business affairs. They separated in 1968 and had a bitter divorce, during the course of which she accused him of cheating on her with his former secretary Regina Fong and using methamphetamines which she said caused wild mood swings. She also claimed he relied on astrologers and numerologists to make financial decisions with &quot;disastrous&quot; consequences.
In 1970, when the divorce was finalized, their communal property was estimated as being worth from $700,000 to $800,000 (equivalent to between $ million and $ million in ).

He was married to Regina Fong from 1971 to 1987 and married Martha Burzynski (1932-2017) two years later. He died the following year.

===Hobbies===
He was an avid pilot and owned a number of airplanes, all named &quot;Spinach&quot;. He was a staunch advocate of natural foods and published a book on healthy living, &quot;Stay Young and Vital&quot;, in 1960.

===Legal troubles===
In May 1948 Hedda Hopper reported that there were four lawsuits against Cummings.

In 1952, Cummings was sued by a writer of &quot;My Hero&quot; who had been fired. In 1952, Cummings was served with papers concerning the suit by LA County Deputy Sheriff William Conroy; Cummings assaulted Conroy and was then sued by the sheriff for damages. Conroy stated that when he tried to serve Cummings with a subpoena the actor gunned the motor of his car and dragged him along the pavement. Cummings explained that he didn&#x27;t know Conroy was a deputy. Both cases were settled in 1954.

In 1972 he was charged with fraud for operating a pyramid scheme involving his company, Bob Cummings Inc, which sold vitamins and food supplements.

In 1975 he was arrested for being in possession of a blue box used to defraud the telephone company. He avoided trial under the double jeopardy rule.

===Reported drug addiction===
Despite his interest in health, Cummings was alleged to have been a methamphetamine addict from the mid-1950s until the end of his life. In 1954, while in New York to star in the &quot;Westinghouse Studio One&quot; production of &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, Cummings began receiving injections from Max Jacobson, the notorious &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;. His friends Rosemary Clooney and José Ferrer recommended the doctor to Cummings, who was complaining of a lack of energy. While Jacobson insisted that his injections contained only &quot;vitamins, sheep sperm, and monkey gonads&quot;, they actually contained a substantial dose of methamphetamine.

Cummings allegedly continued to use a mixture provided by Jacobson, eventually becoming a patient of Jacobson&#x27;s son Thomas, who was based in Los Angeles, and later injecting himself. The changes in Cummings&#x27;s personality caused by the euphoria of the drug and subsequent depression damaged his career and led to an intervention by his friend, television host Art Linkletter. The intervention was not successful, and Cummings&#x27;s drug abuse and subsequent career collapse were factors in his divorces from his third wife, Mary, and fourth wife, Gina Fong.

After Jacobson was forced out of business in the 1970s, Cummings developed his own drug connections based in The Bahamas. Suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, he was forced to move into homes for indigent older actors in Hollywood.

===Children===
Cummings had seven children. His son, Tony Cummings, played Rick Halloway in the NBC daytime serial &quot;Another World&quot; in the early 1980s.

=== Political affiliation ===
Cummings was a supporter of the Republican Party.

==Death==
On December 2, 1990, Cummings died of kidney failure and complications from pneumonia at the Motion Picture &amp; Television Country House and Hospital in Woodland Hills, California.

He is interred in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale, California.

&quot;Filmink&quot; called Cummings&#x27; career &quot;a triumphant success – he did it all: Broadway, Hollywood, Harry Alan Towers, Golden Years of Television, Hitchcock, Deanna Durbin… He just made one mistake – he got on drugs.&quot;

<doc id="1298271" wikidata="Q80111" url="?curid=1298271" title="Beetlebum">
<text>&quot;Beetlebum&quot; is a song by English alternative rock band Blur. It was released on 16 January 1997 as the lead single from the band&#x27;s eponymous fifth album, &quot;Blur&quot; (1997). Written about Blur frontman Damon Albarn&#x27;s experiences with heroin, the song features Beatles-influenced music and a mood that Albarn described as &quot;sleepy&quot; and &quot;sexy&quot;. Despite fears of the song&#x27;s uncommercial nature, the single debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming Blur&#x27;s second track to top the chart. It has since appeared on several Blur compilations.

==Background==
&quot;Beetlebum&quot; was inspired by heroin and the drug experiences Damon Albarn had with his then-girlfriend, Justine Frischmann of Elastica. Albarn reflected, &quot;That whole period of a lot of people&#x27;s lives was fairly muddied by heroin for a lot of people. And it&#x27;s sort of, it&#x27;s in that place. And a lot of stuff was at that time.&quot; He has stated in an interview with MTV that the song describes a complicated emotion, sort of &quot;sleepy&quot; and sort of &quot;sexy&quot;.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; hypothesises that the song&#x27;s title is a reference to the phrase &quot;chasing the beetle&quot;, further linking the song to Albarn&#x27;s experimentation with drugs. Albarn commented, &quot;I&#x27;m not sure what a Beetlebum is. It&#x27;s just a word I sang when I played the song to myself. I asked the others if I should change it, but they said no. If it felt right, we decided that we wouldn&#x27;t tidy it up like we&#x27;ve done in the past. It&#x27;s about drugs basically.&quot; Producer Stephen Street later commented, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know Beetlebum was about heroin. I thought it was just something he’d made up!&quot; A 2023 article in &quot;Dig!&quot; points out that &quot;Beetlebaum&quot; is &quot;the name of a horse in comedian Spike Jones’ parody of the &quot;William Tell Overture&quot;, released as a single in 1948.&quot;

Bassist Alex James explained of the song, &quot;I think &#x27;Beetlebum&#x27; is representative of the fact that as the band&#x27;s got older, the songs have become more simple. Now we can play them with a lot more feeling.&quot; Street similarly pointed to the song as a pivotal one for the band, commenting, &quot;Listening back to Damon Albarn’s vocals on &#x27;Beetlebum&#x27; for the first time, I had tears in my eyes, thinking: &#x27;This is special&#x27;.&quot;

The song has been described as a &quot;Beatles tribute&quot; by several publications; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that the song &quot;[ran] through the White Album in the space of five minutes&quot;.

==Release==
Because of its stylistic differences from Blur&#x27;s previous singles, &quot;Beetlebum&quot; was expected to be a commercial disappointment. As James recalls, &quot;When we first took it around, &#x27;Beetlebum&#x27; was perceived as commercial suicide.&quot; Despite these fears, &quot;Beetlebum&quot; sold 120,000 copies in the UK during its first week on sale, becoming the band&#x27;s second number-one single (after &quot;Country House&quot;). The song also reached the top 10 in several European countries as well as number 13 on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Alternative 30 ranking.

In addition to its release on &quot;Blur&quot;, the song has appeared on compilations such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. It was remixed by Moby for the remix album &quot;Bustin&#x27; + Dronin&#x27;&quot;.

==Music video==
The &quot;Beetlebum&quot; music video was directed by Sophie Muller. The downbeat video combines a performance of the song in a room in a tall building with computer-generated zoom-outs from the set showing the Earth in the centre of kaleidoscopic patterns. Alex James&#x27; cigarette and Dave Rowntree&#x27;s Coke can are censored, although in a version of the video more recently released, both of these items are uncensored. The video concludes with the camera zooming out of the room to show a shot of the River Thames and London&#x27;s skyline.

<text>&#x27; (; , ; ) or gudeul&quot;&quot;&#x27; (; ) in Korean traditional architecture is underfloor heating that uses direct heat transfer from wood smoke to heat the underside of a thick masonry floor. In modern usage, it refers to any type of underfloor heating, or to a hotel or a sleeping room in Korean (as opposed to Western) style.

The main components of the traditional ondol are an &quot;agungi&quot; (; ), an &quot;firebox&quot; or &quot;stove&quot;, accessible from an adjoining room (typically kitchen or master bedroom), a raised masonry floor underlain by horizontal smoke passages, and a vertical, freestanding chimney on the opposite exterior wall providing a draft. The heated floor, supported by stone piers or baffles to distribute the smoke, is covered by stone slabs, clay and an impervious layer such as oiled paper.

==History==
===Origin===
Use of the has been found at archaeological sites in present-day North Korea. A Neolithic Age archaeological site, &quot;circa&quot; 5000 BC, discovered in Sonbong, Rason, in present-day North Korea, shows a clear vestige of gudeul in the excavated dwelling ().

Early began as &quot;gudeul&quot; that provided the heating for a home and for cooking. When a fire was lit in the furnace to cook rice for dinner, the flame would extend horizontally because the flue entry was beside the furnace. This arrangement was essential, as it would not allow the smoke to travel upward, which would cause the flame to go out too soon. As the flame would pass through the flue entrance, it would be guided through the network of passages with the smoke. Entire rooms would be built on the furnace flue to create floored rooms.

===Etymology===
The term &quot;gudeul&quot; is a native Korean word. According to a Korean folkloric historian (孫晋泰) (1900 – missing during the 1950–53 Korean War), &quot;gudeul&quot; originated from &quot;guun-dol&quot; (Korean), which means &quot;heated stone&quot;, and its pronunciation has changed into &quot;gudol&quot; or &quot;gudul&quot;, and again into &quot;gudeul&quot;.

The term is Sino-Korean and was introduced around the end of the 19th century. Alternate names include &quot;janggaeng&quot; (), &quot;hwagaeng&quot; (), &quot;nandol&quot; (), and ().

=== Paleolithic to Neolithic Age ===
The ruins that are said to have been first discovered using the ondol for a long time include the Hoeryong Odong ruins of Hoeryong in Hoeryong, North Hamgyong Province, North Korea, and the remains of Gulpo Port, which are believed to be a Neolithic residence (house) around 5000 BC in Unggi County, North Hamgyong Province. It is said that there are clear traces of the ondol found there at the time.

=== The Bronze Age ===
Since then, it is estimated that the ondol has been handed down for more than 2,000 years in the Korean Peninsula, considering that it originated from a primitive heating method with a fireplace and a year similar to the method of the Three Kingdoms from the Bronze Age.

=== The Three Kingdoms period ===
The ondol was also painted on the mural of the Goguryeo tomb of Anak No. 3 in Hwanghae-do around the 4th century, which was proof that the ondol was also used in Goguryeo.

=== Goryeo to Joseon ===
From the end of the Goryeo dynasty, the ondol began to appear in the form of canisters made of rooms. It was mainly used by the wealthy and mostly used in rooms for the sick and the elderly. It was considered a luxurious heating system in terms of difficulty in making, management, and fuel consumption.

In the Joseon dynasty, the ondol was used to establish a hierarchical order of seats in the room with the lower neck, a point close to the furnace, as the upper seat. In the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty on May 14, the 17th year of King Taejong&#x27;s reign (1417), there is a record of making an ondol room for the sick among the students of Seonggyungwan, who were just established at the time. From this, it can be seen that the ondol room was not entirely used. After that, in the 7th year of King Sejong (1425), the ondol of Seonggyungwan was increased to 5 steps, and it was not until the 16th century that all of them became ondol rooms.

In general, all beds were used and wooden floors were used. On February 4, 1563, there was a fire accident in the king&#x27;s bedroom. Among the explanations of the circumstances at this time, a small ondol structure was made on the king&#x27;s bed to heat the seat, and at this time, the stone was inadvertently placed incorrectly, and the fire broke out when the fire touched the bed. The article in the Annals of the Joseon Dynasty on March 5, 1624, shows that the Nine&#x27;s room was also changed to an Ondol room because the Nine&#x27;s room was not good for the Nine to stay in Panbang, although all the seawalls where the servants of the Four Godfathers lived were ondol during the Gwanghaegun period.

The climate was exceptionally cold, so through the 16th and 17th centuries, which is also called the Little Ice Age, ondol became more and more common, and in the late Joseon dynasty, ondol was widely used in thatched houses of ordinary people.

=== Current ===
Traditional ondol systems provide long-lasting warmth after heating but consume significant fuel, requiring large amounts of firewood. This heavy demand for fuel contributed to deforestation on the Korean Peninsula from the late Joseon Dynasty through the 1950s and 1960s. Starting in the 1960s, firewood was replaced by coal briquettes (yeontan) while retaining the stone slab structure (gudeuljang). However, the incomplete combustion of coal briquettes led to numerous carbon monoxide poisoning incidents. In 1962, to address these issues and improve efficiency, hot-water boilers utilizing the ondol system were developed, reducing both fuel consumption and the risk of poisoning.

==Use==
 had traditionally been used as a living space for sitting, eating, sleeping and other pastimes in most Korean homes before the 1960s. Koreans are accustomed to sitting and sleeping on the floor, and working and eating at low tables instead of raised tables with chairs. The furnace burned mainly rice paddy straws, agricultural crop waste, biomass or any kind of dried firewood. For short-term cooking, rice paddy straws or crop waste was preferred, while long hours of cooking and floor heating needed longer-burning firewood. Unlike modern-day water heaters, the fuel was either sporadically or regularly burned (two to five times a day), depending on frequency of cooking and seasonal weather conditions.

With the traditional heating, the floor closer to the furnace was normally warm enough, and the warmest spots reserved for elders and honored guests. had problems such as environmental pollution and carbon monoxide poisoning resulting from burning coal briquettes. Thus, other technology heats modern Korean homes.

The famous American architect Frank Lloyd Wright was building a hotel in Japan and was invited to a Japanese family&#x27;s house. The homeowner had experienced the in Korea, and had built an room in his house. Wright reportedly was so impressed that he invented radiant floor heating which uses hot water as the heating medium. Wright introduced floor heating to American houses in the US in the 1930s. 

Instead of -hydronic radiant floor heating, modern-day houses such as high-rise apartments have a modernized version of the system. Many architects know the advantages and benefits of , and they are using in modern houses. Since the has been introduced to many countries, it is beginning to be considered as one of the systems of home heating. Modern are not the same as the original version. Almost all Koreans use modern versions, so it is hard to find the traditional system in Korean houses. North Korea still utilizes the basic traditional design of the that use mostly coal instead of biomass to survive the harsh winters.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
One of the advantages of an is that it can maintain heat for an extended period. In a traditional Korean house, people usually extinguish the fire before going to sleep at night, since it can stay warm until the morning. An conducts heat evenly throughout the whole room, although the part of the room closest to the &quot;agungi&quot; is much warmer. Comparing the with the Western radiator: the heat from the radiator rises towards the ceiling, but an keeps both the floor and the air in the room warm. The advantage of the is that people do not have to worry about breakdown and repair of the . The is part of the house, therefore, it is less likely to run into problems. Any combustible materials can be used as fuel for the ; there are no special fuel requirements. In contrast to heaters, such as fireplaces or charcoal-based heaters that leave ash in the room, an does not cause pollution in the room leaving it clean and warm.

The has some disadvantages. Mud and stones are the main materials that make up the . Such materials take quite a long time to heat up, therefore the room takes a long time to warm up. In addition, it is difficult to adjust the temperature of the room.

==&quot;Dol&quot; bed==
The &quot;dol&quot; bed, or stone bed, is a manufactured bed that has the same heating effect as . The &quot;dol&quot; bed industry is estimated to be worth 100 billion South Korean won, comprising 30 to 40 percent of the entire bed industry in South Korea; &quot;dol beds&quot; are most popular with middle-aged people in their 40s and 50s.

<doc id="1298284" wikidata="Q5434764" url="?curid=1298284" title="Faraizi movement">
<text>The Faraizi movement () was a movement led by in Eastern Bengal to give up un-Islamic practices and act upon their duties as Muslims (&quot;farāʾiḍ&quot;). Founded in 1818, the movement protected the rights of tenants to a great extent.

== Views ==
The Faraizis adhered to the Hanafi school with certain differences in practices.
* Tawbah i.e. to be penitent for past sins as a measure for the purification of soul.
* To observe strictly the obligatory duties of Faraiz.
* Strict adherence to Tawhid
* India being Dar al Harb, Friday prayers and Eid prayers were not obligatory.
* Denouncing all cultural rites and ceremonies, which had no reference to the Quran and Sunnah, as bidah or sinful innovations.

The leader of the Faraizis was called &quot;Ustad&quot; or teacher, and his disciples &quot;shaagird&quot; or students (protégé), instead of using the terms like &quot;pir&quot; and &quot;murid&quot;. A person so initiated into the Faraizi fold was called &quot;Tawbar Muslim&quot; or &quot;Mumin&quot;.
It was a religious reform movement founded in rural areas of East Bengal. It was initially peaceful but later turned violent. The basic aim was to discard un Islamic practices.
Its epicentre was in Faridpur.

==Reception==
The Faraizi movement was widely taken up in the areas of greater Dhaka, Barisal, and Comilla.

The landlords levied numerous &quot;abwabs&quot; (plural form of the Arabic term &quot;bab&quot;, signifying a door, a section, a chapter, a title). During Mughal India, all temporary and conditional taxes and impositions levied by the government over and above regular taxes were referred to as abwabs. More explicitly, abwab stood for all irregular impositions on Raiyats above the established assessment of land in the Pargana. Such abwabs were horribly dishonest in the eye of law. Several abwabs were of a religious nature. Haji Shariatullah then intervened to object to such a practice and commanded his disciples not to pay these dishonest cesses to the landlords. The landlords even inflicted a ban on the slaughter of cows, especially on the occasion of Eid. The Faraizis ordained their peasant followers not to obey such a ban. All these heated instances added up to tensed and stressed relationships amongst the Faraizis and the landlords, who were all Hindus.

The Islamic-led Faraizi movement could be witnessed in various parts of Bengal, with overwhelming Anglo-Bangla agreement for perhaps the very first time. The outraged landlords built up a propaganda campaign with the British officials, incriminating the Faraizis with a mutinous mood. In 1837, these Hindu landlords indicted Haji Shariatullah of attempting to build up a kingdom of his own. They also brought several lawsuits against the Faraizis, in which they benefitted dynamic co-operation of the European indigo planters. Shariatullah was placed under the detention of the police in more than one instance, for purportedly inciting agrarian turbulence in Faridpur.

== Succession ==
After the death of Haji Shariatullah, his son, Dudu Miyan, led the movement to a more agrarian character. He organised the oppressed peasantry against the oppressive landlords. In retaliation, the landlords and indigo planters tried to contain Dudu Miyan by instituting false cases against him. However, he became so popular with the peasantry that in the cases, courts seldom found a witness against Dudu Miyan.

The initial victories of Dudu Miyan captured the imagination of the masses and Haji sahib the greta sought Dudu Miyan&#x27;s protection against the oppressive landlords.

Dudu Miyan died in 1862 and before his death he had appointed a board of guardians to look after his minor sons, Ghiyasuddin Haydar and Abdul Gafur alias Naya Miyan who succeeded him successively. The board, with great difficulty, kept the dwindling movement from falling to pieces. It was not until Naya Miyan attained maturity that it regained some of its lost strength. Nabinchandra Sen, the then sub-divisional officer of Madaripur District, thought it prudent to enter into an alliance of mutual help with the Faraizi leaders, who, in their turn, showed a spirit of co-operation towards the government.

On the death of Naya Miyan in 1884, the third and the youngest son of Dudu Miyan, Syeduddin Ahmad was acclaimed leader by the Faraizis. During this time, the conflict of the Faraizis with the Taiyunis, another reformist group reached the climax and religious debates between the two schools of thought had become a commonplace occurrence in East Bengal. He was bestowed with the title of &quot;Khan Bahadur&quot; by the government. In 1905, on the question of the partition of Bengal, he lent support to Nawab Salimullah in favour of partition, but he died in 1906.

Khan Bahadur Syeduddin was succeeded by his eldest son Rashiduddin Ahmad alias Badshah Miyan. During the early years of his leadership, Badshah Miyan maintained the policy of co-operation towards the government. However, the annulment of the partition of Bengal made him anti-British and he took part in the Khilafat and non-co-operation movements. Soon after the establishment of Pakistan he summoned a conference of the Faraizis at Narayanganj and declared Pakistan as &quot;Dar-ul-Islam&quot; and gave permission to his followers to hold the congregational prayers of &quot;Jum&#x27;ah&quot; and &quot;Eid&quot;.

<text>Samuel Okon Peter (born September 6, 1980) is a Nigerian professional boxer. He held the WBC heavyweight title in 2008, when he stopped Oleg Maskaev in six rounds. In his prime, he was known for his rivalry with the Klitschko brothers, having faced Wladimir twice (in 2005 and 2010) and Vitali once. Peter was named among the 20 greatest athletes in the history of independent Nigeria by &quot;The Punch&quot; in 2023, while his capturing of the WBC heavyweight title was ranked the 26th most memorable moment in independent Nigeria&#x27;s sports history by &quot;Premium Times&quot; in 2020. He was ranked by &quot;The Ring&quot; among ten best heavyweights at the conclusion of a year from 2005 to 2008, reaching his highest ranking of world No.2 in 2007. Peter is known for his punching power and holds a 78.9% knockout-to-win ratio.

==Early life and amateur career==

Originally, Peter&#x27;s preferred sport was football. In 1992, some boxers came to his school to train. The curious young 11-year-old stopped by and asked if he could train along with them. He was put up against an experienced amateur and knocked him out. This marked the beginning of a successful amateur career for Peter.

He won the Nigerian Amateur Heavyweight Championship and the Africa Zone 3 Heavyweight Championship. He faced stiff competition as an amateur (including a knockout victory over 2000 silver medalist Mukhtarkhan Dildabekov of Kazakhstan). However, he prevailed and was given the opportunity to represent Nigeria at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.

Peter lost in the quarterfinals to Italian Paolo Vidoz by decision. However, his performance was noted for being very impressive from such a young pugilist and hence more excitement was generated for him than the eventual gold medalist, Audley Harrison, to whom Peter had lost a very close decision just a few months before the Olympics.

==Professional career==

=== Early career ===
Immediately after the Olympics, Ivaylo Gotzev signed on as Peter&#x27;s manager, and Andy &quot;Pops&quot; Anderson became his coach. Peter made his professional debut on February 6, 2001, against Bulgarian fighter Georgi Hristov in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Peter won the bout by first-round knockout. He had seven fights in 2001, winning all of them but one in the first-round. Peter&#x27;s impressive performance in his early fights landed him a promotional deal with Dino Duva of Duva Boxing. Peter made a step up in competition the following year, as his first fight of the year was against Marion Wilson. The bout was scheduled for four rounds. With 11–37–3 record, Wilson was known for his durability and toughness, having never lost inside the distance and occasionally pulling upsets, such as wins over Corey Sanders and Paea Wolfgramm or split draw against Ray Mercer. Peter won the bout by unanimous decision.

Peter had his next fight 19 days later against Julius Joiner (2–0–1, 1 KOs). This was Peter&#x27;s first televised fight, as it was aired on ESPN2. The bout was on the undercard of the event that had James Toney facing Sione Asipeli and Lamont Pearson facing Orlando Salido. Joiner did not come out for the second round, prompting the referee to declare Peter the winner by corner retirement. Peter had three more fights in 2002, winning each by second-round stoppage and having the former two televised by ESPN2.

Afterwards Peter did not enter the ring for 8 months before facing Dale Crowe for the WBC&#x27;s Youth heavyweight title. 26-year old Crowe had a 24–6–2 (15 KOs) record coming into the fight and had only been stopped by DaVarryl Williamson. Crowe became notorious after the fight against former world heavyweight champion Greg Page, in which he pushed Page against the ropes, which resulted in Page ending up partially paralyzed. This was the first professional fight in Peter&#x27;s career scheduled for 10 rounds. The event was aired on ESPN2. Peter won every round on all scorecards before stopping Crowe in the fourth round.

Peter returned to the ring three months later, facing Lyle McDowell (27–9–1, 18 KOs) on June 21, 2003, in a fight televised by HBO as part of the card that saw Lennox Lewis facing Vitali Klitschko in the main event. Peter stopped McDowell in the fourth round. Peter finished the year with two second-round stoppages, boosting his record to 16 wins in 16 fights, with 15 of them inside the distance. He signed to fight Lawrence Clay-Bey (18–2, 13 KOs) in December in a bout televised by ESPN, however Clay-Bey pulled out of the fight due to injury. Dino Duva accused Clay-Bey of faking an injury to avoid fighting Samuel Peter.

=== Rising through rankings ===
==== Peter vs. Shufford, Pudar ====

After scoring two back-to-back stoppage wins against Chris Isaac and Jose Arimatea da Silva, with the former being the first time Peter went past fifth round, Peter had 18 wins in his professional record, for which he needed 41 rounds. He then took a big step up in competition when he faced former WBO world heavyweight title challenger Charles Shufford on May 17, 2004. This was the first time Peter was in the main event of a card. Both Peter and his manager Ivaylo Gotzev praised Shufford for accepting the fight in contrast to other heavyweights that turned down the offer, as Peter already gained a reputation of a powerful and aggressive fighter. The event was the third installment of &quot;Heavyweight Heroes: the Search for the Next Great Heavyweight&quot;, a monthly PPV boxing series created by Cedric Kushner Promotions and broadcast on In Demand for $19.95. Shufford had a record of 20–5, 9 KOs coming into the bout and was 3–3 in his last six fights. Peter won the bout by unanimous decision, going ten rounds for the first time in his career. Three judges scored the bout 99–91, 98–92 and 97–93. According to CompuBox, Peter landed more total and power punches than Shufford in every round; overall, Peter threw 569 shots (32.2% accuracy), with 277 of them being power punches (46.2% accuracy).

Three months later, Peter faced Serbian heavyweight Jovo Pudar on 5 August 2004 at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Hollywood, Florida. 33-year old Jovo Pudar had a record of 22–2 (12 KOs) coming into the bout and had never been stopped in his professional boxing career. He was 5–1 in his last six fights, with the only loss coming at the hands of Taurus Sykes. The fight was televised by Showtime as part of the &quot;ShoBox: The New Generation&quot; boxing program. In the build-up to the fight, Ivaylo Gotzev claimed that this fight would finally establish Peter as &quot;the next true heavyweight king in the minds of boxing fans&quot;: &quot;enough about Dominick Guinn and Joe Mesi and all the rest of them; tune in August 5. I guarantee Samuel Peter will be explosive!&quot; He also expressed his interest in Lawrence Clay-Bey, who was coming off of a fifth-round TKO win over former IBF world cruiserweight champion Imamu Mayfield, as Peter&#x27;s next opponent.

Although Peter was unable to stop Pudar, he bloodied his nose, eventually winning a unanimous decision. Three judges scored the bout 100–90 (twice) and 98–92. According to CompuBox, there were 1,281 punches thrown between two fighters. Peter connected on 239 shots out of 690, while Pudar landed 162 punches out of 591. Peter outlanded his opponent in each round but third and ninth (even) and connected on more power shots in all of the ten rounds.

==== Peter vs. Williams, Diaz ====

To conclude 2004, Peter agreed to face former WBO world heavyweight title challenger Jeremy Williams (41–4–1, 35 KOs) on December 4, 2004, at Mandalay Bay Resort &amp; Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. With a record of 6–0–1, 4 KOs in his last seven fights, Williams was seen to had put his losses to Henry Akinwande and Brian Nielsen behind him, scoring back-to-back upset victories against rising prospects Andre Purlette (35–1, 32 KOs) and Attila Levin (29–1, 23 KOs) and drawing against former IBF world cruiserweight champion Al Cole. The bout took place on the undercard of Jose Luis Castillo vs. Joel Casamayor and was aired on Showtime.

Both boxers started the fight aggressively. After back-and-forth trading in the opening seconds, Williams retreated onto the outside, at first attempting to bob-and-weave but then changing his tactics to circling around Peter and working behind the jab after the bob-and-weave strategy didn&#x27;t work. Meanwhile, Peter was stalking his opponent across the ring, fighting his way inside and putting heavy pressure on Williams&#x27; body whenever Williams was at mid-range. With 20 seconds into the second round, Peter threw a one-two combination; as Williams ducked under Peter&#x27;s right hand, Peter turned around and landed a left hook while Williams was square-footed and moving out of the mid-range. Williams was out cold for several minutes. Peter was declared the winner by second-round knockout, winning the vacant WBC-NABF heavyweight title. The win was nominated for the Knockout of the Year by ESPN. By December 2004, Peter was ranked No.9 contender by the WBC.

On January 22, 2005, Peter faced Cuban heavyweight Yanqui Díaz, who had a record 13–1, 8 KOs coming into the bout. This was the second time Peter was scheduled to fight in a twelve-round bout. Díaz was a highly regarded prospect due to his long and decorated amateur career, with boxing manager Wes Wolfe predicting he would become &quot;a superstar among the Cubans&quot;. After an unexpected loss against Tony Thompson, Díaz went on a 5-fight winning streak, which included an upset first-round TKO against undefeated former long-reigning WBC world cruiserweight champion Juan Carlos Gomez and a split-decision victory over Vaughn Bean. He was ranked No.13 contender by the WBO by January 2005. The bout took place on the undercard of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Henry Bruseles and was aired on HBO.

The fight saw Peter patiently stalking Díaz across the ring and finding his way inside while Díaz tried to stay on the outside, fight behind the jab and circle around his heavier opponent. In the first round, Peter sent Díaz down with a right hand. He did it again in the second but was deducted two points for intentionally hitting Díaz while he was down. In the fourth round, Peter pinned Díaz against the ropes and eventually knocked him down. Díaz got up but was sent to the canvas with a left hook to the body. Peter dropped Díaz for the fifth time in the following round, which prompted Díaz&#x27;s corner to throw in the towel. By defeating Díaz, Peter won the vacant IBF-USBA heavyweight title. By April 2005, Peter was ranked No.5 contender by the WBC, No.6 by the WBO and No.9 by the IBF.

On April 29, 2005, he defeated a journeyman Gilbert Martinez (18–8–3, 7 KOs) by third-round TKO in a stay busy fight televised by ESPN2 as part of the &quot;Friday Night Fights&quot; series. By June, Peter was ranked No.9 heavyweight contender by &quot;The Ring&quot;. He was also ranked No.4 by the WBC and No.5 by both the IBF and WBO. Having a record of 23–0, 20 KOs, Peter was predicted to have a bright future in the heavyweight division, with media often comparing him to Mike Tyson due to his build and punching power. When interviewed by ESPN in 2005, Mike Tyson picked Peter and Calvin Brock as his favorite fighters from the new crop of heavyweights.

==== Peter vs. Sykes ====
On March 16, after a victory over another Nigerian heavyweight contender Friday Ahunanya, WBA-NABA heavyweight champion Taurus Sykes (23–1–1, 6 KOs) called out Peter and another heavyweight prospect Dominick Guinn and accused both of them of ducking a fight with him. Eventually the bout with Peter was scheduled to take place in Reno, Nevada, on July 2, 2005. This was the first time Peter headlined a card televised by Showtime. The event was part of the &quot;Showtime Championship Boxing&quot; program. Sykes was 5–0–1 in his last six fights, most notably defeating Ahunanya and scoring a draw against Imamu Mayfield. In the build-up to the fight, Sykes continued accusing Peter of avoiding the fight with him previously. A pre-fight press conference call saw a clash of words between both fighters, with Sykes continuing to insult Peter: &quot;I know I am being underestimated, but it is all good. It has been like this my whole career. Everybody I have fought was supposed to beat me, but I came out on top. [...] I will outsmart him and outthink him. I am going to be a slick, crafty boxer. I know that he has never really fought anybody like that. Everybody he has fought is running from him, looking to get a check and leave. [...] Sam is getting all hyped. That is how I am going to take him out of the fight. I am going to bust him down and then I will just walk away with a smile.&quot;

During one of pre-fight interviews, Peter admitted he had never looked for an early knockout when he entered a fight, but expressed confidence in his ability of knocking out anyone &quot;if I get my shots (off)&quot;. He also talked about the president and the government of Nigeria following his career and supporting him ever since his first appearance on Showtime, and stated that &quot;for Nigeria, it would be unbelievable for us to have a world champion. Totally unbelievable.&quot;

The opening round saw Sykes attempting to stay away from Peter by circling around, working behind the jab and mostly throwing one-two combinations, while Peter was working his way inside, going back-and-forth between combinations to the head and body and trying to press Sykes against the ropes. The same pattern continued in the following round. In the middle of the second round, Peter hurt Sykes with a right hook as Sykes attempted to initiate a clinch. Peter immediately followed with a barrage of punches, not allowing Sykes to stay away and recover from the punch, ultimately knocking him down with one minute left. Sykes was not able to get up, prompting the referee to stop the fight and declare Peter the winner. With a win over Sykes, Peter became the holder of regional titles of three major sanctioning bodies – IBF, WBA and WBC. As of August 2005, Peter, already ranked by the WBC, IBF and WBO, was ranked No.9 by the WBA.

====Peter vs. Wladimir Klitschko====

On September 24, 2005, he faced Wladimir Klitschko in an elimination match in Atlantic City for the IBF title, in which Peter&#x27;s WBC-NABF title was also on the line. Coming into the bout, Klitschko was viewed by many as the underdog against the 7-to-5 favorite Peter who had won all of his 24 fights, with 21 of them having ended inside the distance. Coming into the fight, Samuel Peter was considered one of the brightest prospects in the heavyweight division. Distinguished boxing coaches Angelo Dundee and Teddy Atlas expected Peter to win. Wladimir&#x27;s team, including his brother Vitali, were worried about Wladimir, and were against this fight to happen. Wladimir, however, insisted on fighting Peter, claiming that beating a feared, hard-hitting fighter like Samuel Peter would help him to regain his stock and become mandatory challenger for two heavyweight belts.

The first four rounds were tentative, with Peter not being to close the distance. At the end of the third, Peter staggered Klitschko with a powerful left hook. He hurt Klitschko again in the fifth with another left hook, sending Klitschko to the canvas with the rabbit punch. The referee counted it as the knockdown. Peter immediately went for the attack after Klitschko got up, dropping him again with the rabbit punch. The referee scored it as the second knockdown. Peter was outboxed through sixth to ninth rounds, frequently trying to hit Klitschko with the rabbit punch whenever escaping from a clinch. Near the end of the tenth round Peter staggered Wladimir with a hard right hand, eventually sending Klitschko to the canvas with another right when Wladimir was backing away. In the 11th and 12th rounds, Klitschko was trying to keep Peter at the distance using straight punches. Peter caught Klitschko with a left hook in the last round, but was unable to capitalize on it. Instead, Klitschko caught him with a hard counter left hook of his own, staggering Peter for the first time in the fight.

Eventually the bout went the distance, with Peter losing the fight by unanimous decision (UD). All the judges scored the bout identically 114–111.

====Peter vs. Hawkins, Long====
Less than three months later after losing to Klitschko, on December 15, 2005, Peter faced Robert Hawkins (21–4–0, 7 KOs) in a stay-busy fight where the WBA-NABA title was also on the line. The bout was a part of the heavyweight triple-header which also saw undefeated Sultan Ibragimov facing Lance Whitaker, with Peter&#x27;s promoter Ivaylo Gotzev expecting the winners of the two bouts to face each other in the near future. &quot;Robert Hawkins is a tough and credible fighter&quot;, Dino Duva said in the build-up to the fight, &quot;This fight proves Sam Peter is a true warrior not afraid of anyone.&quot; The event billed as &quot;Global Warfare&quot; took place at Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Hollywood and was televised on In-Demand PPV for $19.95.

The bout started with aggressive approach by Peter. He knocked Hawkins down midway through the first round but was more cautious afterwards, patiently stalking Hawkins across the ring and fighting behind the jab. The bout was interrupted in the fourth round after Sultan Ibragimov&#x27;s coach Panama Lewis collapsed due to a heart failure. The delay lasted 11 minutes. After the action resumed, the following round only lasted one minute. After the sixth round, Peter was forced to fight with a split down the back of his trunks. Peter stepped up his aggression after the seventh round. Hawkins fought most of the fight on the back foot and appeared to be unable to withstand Peter&#x27;s pressure. Ultimately the bout went the distance, with Peter being declared the winner. The judges scored the bout 99–90 (twice) and 98–91, all in favor of Peter. At the conclusion of 2005, Peter was ranked No.9 heavyweight in the world by &quot;The Ring&quot;.

On April 28, 2006, Peter faced 7&#x27;1&quot; journeyman Julius Long (14–7, 12 KOs) for the NABF heavyweight title, despite the fact that Long was unranked by the WBC, in a bout televised by ESPN. Long was 4–2 in his last six fights, coming off of a UD loss to Terry Smith (24–1–1, 16 KOs). Peter was viewed as the heavy favorite against Long who, despite his size, was mostly an inside fighter and threw punches under unusual angles. Peter made a quick work of Long, dropping him 80 seconds into the first round and then again clobbering him by a three-punch combination, which resulted in Long collapsing face first on the canvas, prompting the referee to stop the fight.

===WBC world heavyweight title contention ===
====Peter vs. Toney I====

Already in April 2005, Peter&#x27;s promoter Dino Duva suggested that &quot;Sam would wipe the floor with James Toney&quot; and criticized major sanctioning bodies for &quot;digging up dinosaurs to fight when they&#x27;ve got the most exciting new heavyweight to come along in many years and he&#x27;s ready, willing and able to take over as soon as they give him the chance&quot;. James Toney&#x27;s post-fight behavior following the victory (later overturned into a No Contest) over John Ruiz three days later to become WBA world heavyweight champion and a four-division world champion further angered Duva, who was also Ruiz&#x27;s promoter: &quot;Even though he beat him cleanly, James Toney showed he had no class by treating my friend and high class man John Ruiz like that after the fight. If he has balls, he&#x27;ll go up against the top contender, Samuel Peter, but I doubt he has any. If he gets in the same ring as Samuel, I&#x27;ll be glad to see Sam give him a bad quarter hour.&quot; Despite being stripped of the title due to a failed drug test and the win being nullified, Toney was still ranked No. 4 heavyweight in the world by &quot;The Ring&quot; as of March 2006, although some observers questioned whether Toney was already fading. By June 2006, Toney and Peter were ranked No. 2 and No. 3 contender for the WBC world heavyweight title respectively (No. 1 ranked Oleg Maskaev was already scheduled to face the champion Hasim Rahman). The bout was officially announced by Showtime on July 3 to take place at Staples Center in Los Angeles on September 2, with the winner becoming a mandatory challenger for the WBC title.

During the first press conference in July 12, Toney got into an argument with Duva and Gotzev, with Gotzev claiming that he was tired of the &quot;Dan Goossen and Toney show; it is Samuel Peter&#x27;s time&quot;, which angered Toney who took his jacket off and started walking towards Peter&#x27;s team before being stopped by his own team; he did, however, praise Peter for taking the fight. Peter was also complimentary towards Toney: &quot;For me to get a fight with Toney right now is a miracle. Toney is a great champion, a Hall of Famer. When he is in shape, he can make anybody look bad. He beat Ruiz, Holyfield and drew with Rahman. Toney has the heart of a real man, and I commend him for that. I give him credit for taking this fight.&quot; He also expressed readiness to take a big step up towards the title. A media telephone conference call on August 7 turned into a heated verbal clash between two boxers, with Toney taunting Peter and making controversial remarks, calling him &quot;a slave&quot;, threatening to &quot;send [his] ass back on a banana boat&quot; and making offensive noises, with Peter responding &quot;You don&#x27;t even know where you are from. I&#x27;m from Nigeria. [...] You are a black man, you come from Africa and you call me a slave?&quot; and mocking Toney for struggling to speak English despite being American. Toney then proceeded to discredit Peter&#x27;s accomplishments: &quot;All the guys he fought were paid to lay down. You know that. Weak opponents. Weak ass opponents. I have fought the best fighters in the world in five different weight classes. I have fought the best.&quot;

Toney continued to talk trash about Peter during a media session two weeks later, while also showing irritation over questions about his weight and claiming that he had &quot;always been a heavyweight&quot;. The bad blood remained during the final press-conference, as Toney claimed to be one of the few &quot;real fighters&quot; in Peter&#x27;s career and his trainer Freddie Roach criticizing Peter for throwing rabbit punches during his fights. Meanwhile, Peter promised the public to knock Toney out inside four rounds and &quot;beat him so bad that when this is over he&#x27;ll be my second wife. Ivaylo Gotzev showed confidence in Peter winning the fight but also provided some criticism: &quot;Sam wants to knock people out but that has prevented people from seeing his boxing ability. He has lots of skills, quick hands, great boxing moves. [...] If he just targets the head, that would go against everything we worked on in camp. But headhunting is the most fun for him, he&#x27;s a natural born killer, that&#x27;s what killers do, they take the head off.&quot;

The vast majority of observers predicted Toney to win by unanimous decision. They credited Toney&#x27;s experience and technique proven against the boxing&#x27;s elite, alleging that that would turn out to be crucial against the 26-year old Peter, although some questioned whether Toney really proved himself to be a top-ranked heavyweight contender and credited Peter for being stronger and more powerful. For the fight Peter weighed in at 257 lbs, the heaviest in his entire career and 14 lbs higher than when he fought Wladimir Klitschko. Toney weighed in at 233 lbs, the same weight he recorded for a world title bout against John Ruiz and 4 pounds lighter than in his last fight against Hasim Rahman.

From the first round Peter went forward and fought behind the jab while also trying to consistently work Toney&#x27;s body, while Toney fought mostly in a counterpunching manner, relying on his speed and slickness to keep Peter at bay and make him missing. After struggling with Toney&#x27;s movement in the first two rounds, Peter hurt Toney in the third, sending him to the ropes, however Toney did not allow him to further capitalize on it. The trend of Toney landing more and Peter landing harder shots continued through the middle rounds. In the ninth, Peter was deducted a point for rabbit punching. He managed to hurt Toney with two right hands in the tenth. Peter changed his approach in the later rounds, relying more on volume punching, while Toney continued fighting mostly as a counterpuncher. In the end, Peter won the bout by split decision, with scores 116–111 twice in favor of Peter and 115–112 for Toney. &quot;I never fought someone like that,&quot; Peter said in a post-fight interview. &quot;I was thinking I was going to knock him out. But he&#x27;s so smart. I had him hurt a couple of times, but he&#x27;s so slick. He never hurt me; I&#x27;m solid like a rock. My game plan was to go in there and stick the jab, and it was working for me all night long.&quot; Both Toney and his trainer Freddie Roach disagreed with the final verdict and criticized Peter for rabbit punches and threatened to issue a protest.

The decision was widely disputed by boxing fans and media, many of whom believed Toney should&#x27;ve been given the victory and that he outstruck Peter and landed cleaner punches, although Peter was credited with landing the harder shots and there was acknowledgement that many rounds were close and competitive. &quot;The New York Post&quot; had Toney winning 114–113.

====Peter vs. Toney II====

As a result of the controversy, on September 27, WBC ordered a rematch between Toney and Peter. For the rematch, Toney hired fitness coach Billy Blanks. This time Peter weighed in at 249 lbs, dropping below 250 lbs for the first time since the Klitschko fight. Toney weighed in at 234 lbs, approximately the same as the previous encounter, but claimed to be &quot;in 150 percent better shape now&quot;.

Peter started the fight at a high pace, increasing his work behind the jab compared to the first fight, while also showing more movement and patience and not allowing Toney to frustrate him. Peter staggered Toney in the first round but Toney managed to survive. In the second round, Peter knocked Toney down with a double jab, catching him off balance. Peter became the first man to send Toney to the canvas since 1994. Peter continued fighting aggressively and, with few exceptions, remained in control of the fight throughout the entire twelve rounds. By the middle rounds, as Peter successfully cracked through Toney&#x27;s defense numerous times, Toney&#x27;s eye began to swell and his defensive work considerably slowed down. Meanwhile, Peter also began to tire but was still doing the better work. Peter hurt Toney again with a big right hand in the eleventh. In the end the fight went the distance, with Peter being declared the winner by unanimous decision. The official judges&#x27; scorecards read 119–108, 118–110, 118–110. Unlike the first fight, there was little dispute among ringside observers about the rightful winner. ESPN had Peter winning 120–107, giving him every round.

&quot;I taunted him. I gave him the Muhammad Ali shuffle with a little Floyd Mayweather, too,&quot; Peter said after the fight. &quot;This was my best fight.&quot; Despite the victory, Ivaylo Gotzev rated Peter&#x27;s performance at B−. Meanwhile, Dino Duva claimed that Peter could become undisputed heavyweight champion by the end of 2007 if the champions &quot;have the nerve&quot; to fight him. Peter earned $1.5 million for the fight, while Toney earned $1.1 million. With the victory, Peter solidified his status as the mandatory challenger for the WBC title.

====Cancelled bout vs. Maskaev====
Shortly afterwards, Dino Duva urged Dennis Rappaport, promoter of the then-WBC world heavyweight champion Oleg Maskaev, to start negotiations over a mandatory defense: &quot;José Sulaimán and the WBC have made it clear that they are honoring their commitment for Maskaev to defend his title against Samuel Peter immediately. We respect Oleg, know that he is a true champion, and expect him to honor that commitment.&quot;

Initially, Maskaev did not express interest in fighting Peter, instead negotiating with the WBC Emeritus champion Vitali Klitschko, who was going to make a comeback after a 2-year retirement and had a history with Maskaev in amateur boxing (including a fight at the 1991 Soviet Army Championships, when Maskaev allegedly defeated Klitschko by first-round stoppage). Peter was offered between $2.5 and $3 million to step aside, under agreement that the winner of Maskaev-Klitschko fight would face him next. Eventually, negotiations between Klitschko and Maskaev broke down when Klitschko&#x27;s team refused additional demands from both Maskaev&#x27;s and Peter&#x27;s teams: Maskaev wanted a purse of $5 million instead of the offered $3 million, while Peter was also not satisfied with his offer. On April 5, the teams of all three boxers agreed to give a green light to the Maskaev-Peter fight, under agreement that Vitali would be the first in line to face the winner. On April 9, WBC gave Maskaev and Peter time until April 20 to sign a contract, after which a purse offer would be held.

On May 7, Dino Duva won the purse bid with an offer of $3.201 million, ahead of $3.107 million offered by Don King, $2.5 million offered by Rappaport and $2.001 million offered by a Russian promoter. While Rappaport insisted that the purse bid should be split 70/30 in favor of the champion, Don King insisted on a more favorable 55/45; the disagreement put the fight&#x27;s future at risk. Eventually, both sides reached a compromise and signed a contract on July 26. The fight would take place at Madison Square Garden on October 6 and was going to be the first one since the arena&#x27;s ring was retired on September 19, although originally the retirement was expected to take place after the fight. Maskaev, Peter and Joe Frazier conducted a symbolic 10-count to &quot;officially&quot; retire the ring.

Going into the fight, predictions varied: some viewed Peter as a favorite due to being younger, faster and stronger than Maskaev, as well as having the better punch resistance and being overall stylistically difficult for Maskaev, while other considered Maskaev to me more skilled and proven against better opposition.

On September 21, it was announced that Maskaev was forced to pull out of the fight due to a herniated disc. The injury would keep him out of the ring for approximately 3–4 months. Because that would result in the WBC title being &quot;frozen&quot; for a total of 14 months (Maskaev made his last defense on December 10, 2006), Peter was promoted to the interim world heavyweight champion.

====Peter vs. McCline====
While waiting for Peter and Maskaev, Vitali Klitschko signed a contract to face Jameel McCline. The bout was going to take place in Munich on September 22, and was supposed to be a tune-up fight. On September 10, it was reported that Klitschko had suffered a back injury in training. McCline refused to wait for Klitschko, and instead on September 19 Don King announced that DaVarryl Williamson, ranked No.4 heavyweight contender by the WBA, would replace Vitali. However, after Maskaev pulled out of the fight against Peter, McCline was swiftly promoted in the WBC rankings to No.10 and then named as Maskaev&#x27;s replacement. Such actions were enabled the organization&#x27;s regulations, which give authority to the WBC Board of Governors to &quot;take any action to resolve any special circumstance&quot;; as McCline had been training for the Klitschko fight and was therefore &quot;in good shape&quot;, he was deemed an adequate replacement. Some observers questioned whether McCline should be allowed to fight for the title due to allegations that McCline was using steroids; McCline allegedly received performance enhancing drugs worth more than $12,000 between 2005 and 2006 from Signature Pharmacy in Orlando, Florida. Despite this, the organizers decided to proceed with the fight.

In the build-up to the fight, Peter stated that he &quot;feels great&quot; being a world champion and dismissed notions that the &quot;interim&quot; tag undermines his world title status and that that he was undeserving of the title, hinting that he had already won it in the ring: &quot;Remember when I fought the championship? I remember that it was twice, fought 24 rounds between September and January&quot;. Peter&#x27;s promoter Dino Duva also criticized how Maskaev&#x27;s team handled the fact that their fighter was injured, casting doubts whether the injury did actually occur. He expressed belief that McCline was a tougher fight for Peter than Maskaev due to his size and boxing skills, but despite everything, &quot;the Samuel Peter heavyweight championship era begins Saturday&quot;. He also criticized Vitali Klitschko&#x27;s team for failing to pay the step-aside money they promised.

Peter started the fight strong, establishing his jab and sometimes doubling and tripling the jab and combining that with movement that would not provide McCline with a target. Just before the end of the second round, which Peter was seemingly on course to win, McCline landed a short uppercut that sent Peter to the canvas for the first time in his boxing career. Shortly into the third round, McCline landed the uppercut again and followed it with a left-right combo, dropping Peter again. After Peter got up again, McCline went for the knockout, however Peter managed to survive the onslaught and started firing back, as McCline began to run out of stamina. Despite this, McCline managed to drop Peter for the third time with a left followed by two rights. In between the third and fourth rounds, Peter&#x27;s corner urged their fighter not to engage in exchanges and box smarter. From the fourth round, Peter had more success keeping McCline at the end of his jab, while also keeping his offense versatile and not allowing McCline to fully regain his stamina and recapture the initiative. By the eighth round, many ringside observers had the fight close on their scorecards. McCline hurt Peter with an uppercut again in the eighth but failed to follow up. Both fighters looked tired in the championship rounds, however Peter managed to win the remaining three rounds, fighting cautiously in the twelfth in order to cruise into a decision victory. Ultimately, he was declared the winner by unanimous decision, with scores 115–110, 115–111 and 113–112.

&quot;When I was knocked down I knew I had to stand up and defend my belt,&quot; said Peter. &quot;I&#x27;m a champion. [...] Now I&#x27;m going home to bring the title back to Africa.&quot; He dismissed underestimating McCline, but admitted to have enter the fight with a broken left hand and hid it from the commission because he did not want to &quot;follow Maskaev&#x27;s footsteps&quot;. The fight was well received by observers, particularly Peter was praised for overcoming adversity and finding his way back into the fight after a difficult start, although McCline received some criticism for letting Peter off the hook after knocking him down three times.

===WBC world heavyweight champion===
====Peter vs. Maskaev ====

As interim champion, he was a mandatory challenger for the WBC belt held by Oleg Maskaev, who had been inactive since December 2006 due to injury. This long-anticipated fight took place on March 8, 2008, at the principal bullfighting venue in Cancún, Mexico. Peter won by TKO, with the referee stopping the fight with only a few seconds remaining in the sixth round. Peter used far less movement than he had in his previous two bouts against Maskaev, from the first round onwards both were trading heavy shots. In round three Peter staggered Maskaev and was then rocked in return. Maskaev had not been able to really hurt Peter. Peter used his jab to pursue Maskaev in the sixth and eventually broke through with a big right hand. Maskaev staggered backwards and Peter moved in for the finish. Peter continued to pummel Maskaev on the ropes while Oleg tried to motion to the referee about rabbit punches. The referee stepped in with seconds remaining as Maskaev staggered backwards into the corner. Peter was ahead on all three judges&#x27; scorecards at the time of the stoppage.

====Peter vs. Vitali Klitschko====

Following his victory over Maskaev, he publicly challenged IBF, WBO and IBO champion Wladimir Klitschko to a unification bout, which would have been Klitschko&#x27;s second such fight, as well as his second matchup with Peter (the first ending with a unanimous decision victory for Klitschko). Such a fight would have unified three of the four major titles, the closest the division had been to an undisputed champion since Lennox Lewis relinquished the WBA title (one of the three he then held) by court order on April 29, 2000. Klitschko indicated he might fight Peter, but suggested that Peter should fight his brother Vitali first. Vitali Klitschko had retired as WBC champion in November 2005, and was considered the WBC&#x27;s champion emeritus, giving him the right to a mandatory challenge under the rules of that organization should he elect to fight again. At the time of his retirement, Vitali was the dominant force in his division. Both had a claim to being the rightful WBC belt holder. Yet there was added importance for the bout; if Vitali were to win it would mean that both brothers would achieve their dream of being heavyweight champions at the same time. On the other hand, if Peter were to win and then challenge Wladimir in a rematch, it would bring the heavyweight division close to the first undisputed title holder in years. Peter accepted the WBC&#x27;s ruling and the bout was scheduled for October 11 at O2 World Berlin.

Klitschko had a memorable ring entrance with five former heavyweight champions appearing to wish him luck in his comeback. Klitschko would reclaim his belt in dominating fashion. Although he was coming back from a four-year layoff, Klitschko was sharp from the opening bell. Peter had been expected to set the pace and pursue Vitali, instead he spent time outside trying to box his way in. Klitschko took the center of the ring and found Peter an easy target. Peter landed two hard right hands in the second round, but they had almost no effect on Vitali at all. After four rounds Peter&#x27;s face was swelling and his corner was growing in frustration. His corner implored him to let his hands go and push Vitali back. Peter tried to rally in the sixth round, but only made himself an even more open target for Klitschko&#x27;s counter punches. The seventh round was extremely punishing for the defending champion as he ate several left hooks, right crosses and jabs. Peter seemed unresponsive to his corner&#x27;s advice after a few rounds. As his corner tried to give him instructions the scores of the fight were read out by the ring announcer. Two judges had Klitschko ahead by 80–72, and one by 79–73. Peter informed he did not wish to continue, prompting the referee to stop the fight and declare Klitschko the winner.

===Defeat to Chambers and return to form===
Looking to bounce back to the heavyweight title picture, Peter faced Eddie Chambers on March 27, 2009. The fight took place at Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, and was aired on ESPN2. Chambers injured his right thumb early in the third round, but was able to outbox Peter for the majority of the fight, frustrating his opponent with speed and quickness and being able to block most of Peter&#x27;s shots using his gloves and armes. As a result, Chambers was declared the winner by majority decision, with the judges scoring the bout 99–91, 96–94 and 95–95. Some observers criticized the 95–95 score, believing Peter had not done enough to win more than three rounds.

He fought Marcus McGee on July 25, 2009, in Mexico, knocking him unconscious in the third round with a right hand. He weighed in at a 243 lbs for this fight.

His next fight was on September 15, 2009, against the little known Ronald Bellamy. Peter won by second-round knockout. He then fought journeyman Gabe Brown and won by fourth round stoppage.

Following his three successful victories over journeymen, Peter took a step up in competition against Nagy Aguilera in an IBF eliminator (Aguilera had earned the position with a stunning first-round knockout of former champion Oleg Maskaev). Peter came in at 237 pounds, the lightest since his seventh pro fight. He dominated an entertaining first round before sending Aguilera down in the second with a right hand counter, Nagy beat the count but was stopped soon after as he was hanging against the ropes, taking heavy shots.

Peter then targeted either a rematch with Wladimir Klitschko or a final IBF eliminator with unbeaten Alexander Povetkin. Sensing that Povetkin was not willing to fight Klitschko, Peter made himself available as a replacement opponent. Both Peter and Povetkin were ranked as #1 IBF contenders.

===Peter vs. Wladimir Klitschko II and release from Top Rank===

On September 11, 2010, Peter fought Wladimir Klitschko again at the Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt, Germany, for the IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight titles. Peter weighed in at 241 pounds, two pounds lighter than the first fight. Klitschko came in at a career heavy of 247 pounds. Both fighters had promised knockouts in the pre fight build up. Peter started the fight very aggressively in a bob and weave style he had never before fought in. He caught Klitschko with a good left hook in the opening round, though Klitschko remained unshaken. Klitschko ended the round well. In the second round Klitschko caught Peter with three hard right hands, one of which seemed to stun him. Both fighters struggled to land punches in the third round, there was a lot of clinching in what was a physical encounter. Unlike their first fight referee Robert Byrd did not let Peter punch on the break or hit to the back of the head. After four rounds the fight became one sided, with Peter&#x27;s right eye closing. Peter could not find the target and started lunging with wild shots, his legs had slowed dramatically and he was taking heavy shots. He did get through with a big right hand in round six though. Klitschko, instead of going backwards as he did in their first fight, would meet Peter in the middle of the ring and dominate him physically in the clinches. Peter was taking heavy punishment and after eight rounds was totally exhausted. After the ninth round Peter&#x27;s cornerman Abel Sanchez threatened to stop the fight, and said he would give him one more round. Emanuel Steward implored Klitschko to throw combinations. Peter swung wildly in the tenth and Klitschko opened up with a punishing combination which floored him. Referee Robert Byrd did not start a count and waved the fight off, awarding Klitschko the win by knockout. It was Klitschko&#x27;s ninth successful title defense.

The nature of the defeat to Klitschko in the rematch possibly spelled the end of Peter&#x27;s career as a top level fighter. Top Rank released him from his contract soon after. In spite of this Peter&#x27;s manager said they would look to secure other big fights in the division against anyone other than the Klitschko brothers.

===Peter vs. Helenius===
After his release from Top Rank, Peter and his management sent an offer to Tomasz Adamek for an IBF elimination match. The fight fell through when Peter refused Adamek&#x27;s challenger money of $150,000. Peter then went into negotiations for a fight with Tye Fields which also failed to materialise. Then, in March 2011, it was revealed that Peter would travel to Germany to face undefeated Finnish prospect Robert Helenius. Peter was rumoured to be in training with Jeff Mayweather, however, Mayweather was not present for Peter&#x27;s fight against Helenius. Peter weighed in for the contest at , 18.5 lbs heavier than in the Klitschko fight. Peter was without a reputed trainer or even a cutman for the fight. Peter had reasonable success in the first half of the bout, winning several of the first six rounds; however, after that point Peter began to tire. The end came when Helenius knocked down an exhausted Peter in round nine, Peter got to his feet only to be sent back to the canvas where he remained for well over the 10 second count, awarding Helenius the win by KO. The nature of the loss to Helenius, as well as Peter&#x27;s terrible physical condition led many to call for Peter&#x27;s retirement from boxing.

=== 2014 return ===
Peter made an unexpected return to the ring on September 27, 2014, to face journeyman Ron Aubrey. Peter came into the ring at an all-time career heavy of , and was struggling to walk before the bout began. Peter ended the fight when a vicious right hook knocked Aubrey unconscious in the first round.

===Fight cancellations===
During his four-year period of near total inactivity, Peter had been signed to fight several opponents with all the bouts being cancelled. He was scheduled to compete in the Super 8 boxing tournament, but pulled out due to injury. He was then scheduled to face former title challenger Alex Leapai but once again he pulled out as the fight neared. He then signed to fight Alexander Ustinov but again cancelled the fight with only days to go. Peter was close to agreeing to fight Luis Ortiz before eventually being replaced.

=== Career from 2016–present ===
At the age of 36, after a two-year layoff, Peter returned to the ring on October 23 fighting in Mexico, defeating unknown boxer Juan Carlos Salas (6–9) in three rounds. Peter weighed 262-pounds. It was still unclear if Peter would be returning to boxing full-time.

On November 1, there were early talks that Peter would be fighting former world title challenger Kubrat Pulev in December in Sofia, Bulgaria. Pulev, ranked at number 2 with the IBF, recently defeated Derek Chisora via decision in May. A fight was confirmed five days later by Team Sauerland, officially announcing the fight between Peter and Pulev on December 3 in Bulgaria. This would be a stay busy fight for Pulev before his anticipated European title defense against Polish boxer Mariusz Wach. Pulev vacated his European title on November 22. In front of 15,000 at the Arena Armeec, Pulev defeated Peter via fourth round corner retirement (RTD) to win the vacant WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight title. Peter was aggressive throughout but struggled with Pulev&#x27;s jab. The fight was stopped after round three when Peter dislocated his right shoulder while throwing a big punch. He went back to the corner leaning towards the right side and the injury forced him to retire.

Peter returned to Mexico once again on February 22, 2019, having not fought in two years. He appeared at the Cheers Bar &amp; Grill in Tijuana knocking out Gerardo Escobar in just 44 seconds of the fight starting. On March 26 Peter signed a promotional contract with Salita Promotions and was announced to fight Mexican journeyman Mario Heredia (15–6–1, 13 KOs) on April 13 at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City on the undercard of Claressa Shields vs. Christina Hammer. Prior to the fight, Heredia was 2–5–1 in his previous eight bouts. Peter lost an eight-round split decision to Heredia, which took place at the Adrian Phillips Theater. Peter scored a knockdown in round-three yet was unable to finish Heredia, who fought on and prevailed by scores of 77–74 and 76–75, with the third judge giving Peter the nod via a 79–72 margin.

<doc id="1298313" wikidata="Q2585866" url="?curid=1298313" title="Christopher Robin Milne">
<text>Christopher Robin Milne (21 August 1920 – 20 April 1996) was an English author and bookseller and the only child of author A. A. Milne. As a child, he was the basis of the character Christopher Robin in his father&#x27;s Winnie-the-Pooh stories and in two books of poems.

==Early life==
Christopher Robin Milne was born at 11 Mallord Street, Chelsea, London (renumbered as 13 Mallord Street in 1924), on 21 August 1920, to author Alan Alexander Milne and Daphne (&quot;née&quot; de Sélincourt) Milne. Milne speculated that he was an only child because &quot;he had been a long time coming.&quot; From an early age, Milne was cared for by his nanny Olive &quot;Nou&quot; Rand Brockwell, until May 1930, when he entered boarding school. Milne called her &quot;Nou&quot;, and stated &quot;Apart from her fortnight&#x27;s holiday every September, we had not been out of each other&#x27;s sight for more than a few hours at a time&quot;, and &quot;we lived together in a large nursery on the top floor.&quot;

Milne&#x27;s father explained that &quot;Rosemary&quot; was the intended name of their firstborn child, if it was a girl. Realizing that it was going to be a boy, he decided on &quot;Billy&quot;, but without the intention of actually christening him William. Instead, each parent chose a name; hence his legal name was Christopher Robin. Within the family, he was referred to as &quot;Billy Moon&quot;, a combination of his nickname and his childhood mispronunciation of Milne. From 1929 onwards, he would simply be referred to as Christopher, and he later stated that it was &quot;the only name I feel to be really mine.&quot;

On his first birthday on 21 August 1921, Milne received an Alpha Farnell teddy bear, which he later named Edward. Eeyore was a Christmas present in 1921 and Piglet arrived undated. Edward, along with a real Canadian black bear named Winnipeg that Milne saw at London Zoo, eventually became the inspiration for the Winnie-the-Pooh character.

Milne spoke self-deprecatingly of his own intellect, &quot;I may have been on the dim side&quot;, or &quot;not very bright&quot;. He also described himself as being &quot;good with his hands&quot; and possessing a Meccano set. His self-descriptions included &quot;girlish&quot;, since he had long hair and wore &quot;girlish clothes&quot;, and being &quot;very shy and &#x27;un-self-possessed&#x27;&quot;.

An early childhood friend was Anne Darlington, also an only child, who, as Milne described it, was for his parents &quot;the Rosemary that I wasn&#x27;t.&quot; Darlington had a toy monkey, Jumbo, as dear to her as Pooh was to Milne. Several poems by Milne&#x27;s father, and several illustrations by E. H. Shepard, feature Darlington and Milne, notably &quot;Buttercup Days&quot;, in which their relative hair colours (brown and golden blond) and their mutual affection is noted (the illustration to this latter poem, from &quot;Now We Are Six&quot;, also features the cottage at Cotchford Farm). To Milne&#x27;s parents, Darlington was, and remained to her death, the daughter that Milne wasn&#x27;t, and Daphne long held fond hopes that Darlington and Milne would marry.

In 1925, Milne&#x27;s father bought Cotchford Farm, near the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex. Though still living in London, the family would spend weekends, Easter, and summer holidays there. As Milne described it, &quot;So there we were in 1925 with a cottage, a little bit of garden, a lot of jungle, two fields, a river, and then all the green, hilly countryside beyond, meadows and woods, waiting to be explored.&quot; The place became the inspiration for fiction, with Milne stating, &quot;Gill&#x27;s Lap that inspired Galleon&#x27;s Lap, the group of pine trees on the other side of the main road that became the Six Pine Trees, the bridge over the river at Posingford that became Pooh-sticks Bridge,&quot; and a nearby &quot;ancient walnut tree&quot; became Pooh&#x27;s House. His toys, Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet, plus two invented characters, Owl and Rabbit, came to life through Milne and his mother, to the point where his father could write stories about them. Kanga, Roo, and Tigger were later presents from his parents.

Of this time, Milne states, &quot;I loved my Nanny, I loved Cotchford. I also quite liked being Christopher Robin and being famous.&quot;

When his nanny departed when he was nine, Milne&#x27;s relationship with his father grew. As he put it, &quot;For nearly ten years I had clung to Nanny. For nearly ten more years I was to cling to him, adoring him as I had adored Nanny, so that he too became almost a part of me ...&quot;

When Milne eventually wrote his memoirs, he dedicated them to Olive Rand Brockwell: &quot;Alice to millions, but Nou to me&quot;.

===Schooling===
At age six, Milne and Darlington attended Miss Walters&#x27; school. On 15 January 1929, Milne started at Gibbs, a boys&#x27; day school in Sloane Square, London. In May 1930, he started boarding school at Boxgrove School near Guildford. Of his time at boarding school, Milne said, &quot;For it was now that began that love-hate relationship with my fictional namesake that has continued to this day.&quot; His father&#x27;s books were popular, and they were well known by his schoolmates, which made Milne a target of bullying by the other children. Milne later described the poem &quot;Vespers&quot; – about the toddler Christopher Robin saying his evening prayers – as &quot;the one [work] that has brought me over the years more toe-curling, fist-clenching, lip-biting embarrassment than any other.&quot;

Milne earned a mathematics scholarship at Stowe School, where he was relentlessly bullied, and wrote: &quot;It seemed to me almost that my father had got to where he was by climbing upon my infant shoulders, that he had filched from me my good name and had left me with the empty fame of being his son.&quot; He went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1939.

==Adult life==
When World War II started, Milne left his studies and tried to join the British Army, but failed the medical examination. His father used his influence to allow Milne to join as a sapper in the 2nd Training Battalion of the Royal Engineers. He was commissioned in July 1942, and was posted to the Middle East and then to Italy, where he was wounded as a platoon commander the following year. After the war he returned to Cambridge University and completed a degree in English.

At 26, he was a very well-educated ex-army officer from a privileged family. He spent a period in London trying to readjust to &quot;civvy street&quot; by finding gainful employment, but his social status worked against him. He explored several career avenues, each one ending in a fruitless cul-de-sac. This was an unhappy and directionless period, sometimes referred to as his &#x27;Downwards&#x27; turn. Of this idle interlude he commented &quot;How hateful it is to have too little to do.&quot; But he entered an altogether more personally fulfilling chapter of his life: marriage, and as a successful bookshop owner.

On , Milne became engaged to Lesley de Sélincourt, a first cousin on his mother&#x27;s side and daughter of the translator Aubrey de Sélincourt, and they married on . 

In 1951, he and his wife moved to Dartmouth, and opened The Harbour Bookshop on 25 August. This turned out to be a success, although his mother had thought the decision odd, as Milne did not seem to like &quot;business&quot;, and as a bookseller he would have to meet fans of his father&#x27;s work. The shop was closed by its most recent owners in September 2011. 

Milne occasionally visited his father when the elder Milne became ill. After his father died, Milne never returned to Cotchford Farm. His mother eventually sold the farm and moved back to London after disposing of his father&#x27;s personal possessions. Milne, who did not want any part of his father&#x27;s royalties, decided to write a book about his childhood. As Milne describes it, that book, &quot;The Enchanted Places&quot;, &quot;combined to lift me from under the shadow of my father and of Christopher Robin, and to my surprise and pleasure I found myself standing beside them in the sunshine able to look them both in the eye&quot;. 

Following her husband&#x27;s death, Daphne Milne had little further contact with her son, did not see him during the last 15 years of her life and refused to see him on her deathbed.

A few months after his father&#x27;s death in 1956, Milne&#x27;s daughter Clare was born and diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy.

Milne gave the original stuffed animals that inspired the Pooh characters to the books&#x27; editor, who in turn donated them to the New York Public Library; Marjorie Taylor recounts in her book &quot;Imaginary Companions and the Children Who Create Them&quot; how many were disappointed at this, and Milne had to explain that he preferred to concentrate on the things that currently interested him. He disliked the idea of Winnie-the-Pooh being commercialised.

===Death===
Milne, who lived with myasthenia gravis for some years, died in his sleep on in Totnes, Devon, at a hospital, aged 75. Following his death, he was described by one newspaper as a &quot;dedicated atheist&quot;.

==Family==
Milne had one child, a daughter named Clare, who had cerebral palsy. In adult life, she led several charitable campaigns for the condition, including the Clare Milne Trust. She died in 2012, at the age of 56, of a heart abnormality.

==Portrayal==
Milne is portrayed by Will Tilston and Alex Lawther in &quot;Goodbye Christopher Robin&quot;, a 2017 film which was &quot;inspired by&quot; his relationship with his father.

<doc id="1298322" wikidata="Q1925365" url="?curid=1298322" title="Metre-stick">
<text>A metre-stick, metrestick (or meter-stick and meterstick as alternative spellings); or yardstick is either a straightedge or foldable ruler used to measure length, and is especially common in the construction industry. They are often made of wood or plastic, and often have metal or plastic joints so that they can be folded together. The normal length of a metre-stick made for the international market is either one or two metres, while a yardstick made for the U.S. market is typically one yard (3 feet or 0.9144 metres) long.

Metre-sticks are usually divided with lines for each millimetre (1000 per metre) and numerical markings per centimetre (100 per metre), with numbers either in centimetres or millimetres. Yardsticks are most often marked with a scale in inches, but sometimes also feature marks for foot increments. Hybrid sticks with more than one measurement system also exist, most notably those which have metric measurements on one side and U.S. customary units on the other side (or both on the same side). The &quot;tumstock&quot; (literally &quot;thumbstick&quot;, meaning &quot;inch-stick&quot;) invented in 1883 by the Swedish engineer Karl-Hilmer Johansson Kollén was the first such hybrid stick, and was developed to help Sweden convert to the metric system.

==Construction==
Metre-sticks are often thin and rectangular, and made of wood or metal. Metal ones are often backed with &#x27;grippy&#x27; material, such as cork, to improve friction. They are relatively cheap, with most wood models costing under US$5.

==Measurements==
In countries in which the metric system is used, the scale typically contains only a metric scale. The scale marks every millimetre with every 5th millimetre marked by a slightly longer line. Every centimetre is marked with an even longer line and a numeric label. Every 10th centimetre is usually predominantly marked. They might be referred to as yardsticks, metre-sticks or &quot;inch sticks&quot;.
In the United States, the marking is usually in customary units (three feet inches with inch and fractional inch). Hybrid measures bearing customary markings on one side and metric units on the other also exist and are sometimes referred to as yardsticks, metre-whesticks or &quot;metre rulers&quot;. The spelling meter vs metre varies by country, though metre is the official and most widely used spelling in English-speaking countries.

Although not used as often, metre-sticks with only a metric scale can be found in the United States. For example, they are common in schools where there is a desire for students to become familiar with metric units, since the nineteenth century. They may also be used in American science labs.

The folding carpenters&#x27; rulers used in Scandinavia are sometimes equipped with double measurements, metric and imperial on both sides, also functioning as a handy conversion table, accounting for its Scandinavian term: Tommestokk/tumstock (&quot;thumb (inch) stick&quot;), a term with the same meaning that is also used in Dutch: duimstok. Metric only carpenter&#x27;s rulers are however common.

==Application==
The metre-stick is usually employed for work on a medium scale; larger than desktop work on paper, yet smaller than large-scale infrastructure work, where tape measures or longer measuring rods are used. Typical applications of metre-sticks are for building furniture, vehicles and houses. Modern carpenters&#x27; metre-sticks are usually made to be folded for ease of transport.

Metre-sticks may be used as pointing devices for posters and projections. Metre-sticks are also used as spars to make wings for remote-controlled model aircraft that are made from corrugated plastic.

Metre-sticks have been used as a method of corporal punishment in schools in the United Kingdom to slap the palms of students to bring them in order.

<doc id="1298333" wikidata="Q313180" url="?curid=1298333" title="Ruud Krol">
<text>Rudolf Jozef &quot;Ruud&quot; (or &quot;Rudi&quot;) Krol (; born 24 March 1949) is a Dutch former professional footballer who was capped 83 times for the Netherlands national team. Most of his career he played for his home town club, Ajax. He became a coach after retirement. Regarded as one of the best defenders of all time, Krol mainly played as a sweeper or left-back, though he could play anywhere across the back line, or in midfield as a defensive midfielder, due to his range of passing with both feet, temperament, tactical intelligence, and his ability to start attacking plays after winning back the ball.

==Playing career==

===Club===

He began his career at Ajax under manager Rinus Michels. In his first season at the club he did not play much. After the departure of left-back Theo van Duivenbode in the summer of 1969 to Feyenoord, Krol became a regular player. When Ajax reached the UEFA European Cup in 1971, and won, Krol did not play because of a broken leg. Krol did play in the European Cup finals of 1972 and 1973. While others, such as Johan Cruijff and Johan Neeskens, left for new pastures, Krol, captain since the departure of Piet Keizer in October 1974, stayed at Ajax until June 1980.

He moved to the North American Soccer League to play for the Vancouver Whitecaps for one season. He then joined Napoli, where he played for the next four seasons. His last club before he retired in 1986 was the French club Cannes, at the time in Ligue 2 (the French 2nd division).

===International===

Internationally, Krol made his debut for the Netherlands in 1969 against England, retiring from international football in 1983. He was a crucial component in the &quot;Total Football&quot; side of the 1970s. A versatile defender, he could play in any position along the back four or midfield. In the 1974 FIFA World Cup, in which the Netherlands reached the final, Krol primarily played at left-back. He created Cruijff&#x27;s goal against Brazil and scored a 25-yard screamer against Argentina.

Krol was part of the Dutch squad that participated in the 1976 European Championship.

By the time the 1978 FIFA World Cup came about, Krol had switched to playing as a sweeper and had earned the captain&#x27;s armband after the retirement of Cruijff.

Krol played for the Netherlands as captain at the 1980 European Championship. He played for part of the qualifying for Euro 84, and played his last international in 1983.

==Managerial career==

In his managerial career, he has been head coach of Egypt, and has been assistant manager of the Netherlands (under Frank Rijkaard and Louis van Gaal) and Ajax (under Ronald Koeman). He became the interim manager of Ajax after the resignation of Koeman. He was manager of Ajaccio in France Ligue 2 from 2006 to 2007. He returned as manager of Egyptian giants Zamalek in August 2007. He had previously managed them from 1994 to 1999, winning the Egyptian Cup in 1999, the African Cup of Champions Clubs in 1996 and the Afro-Asian Club Championship 1997, the last two being the biggest club level prizes available to CAF clubs. Krol&#x27;s return to Zamalek was meant to be a stabilizing presence, the club having gone through several managers in the preceding two seasons. His stay however would be a short one. He ended his sole season by winning one Egyptian Cup with Zamalek, within one season he would leave and sign a three-year contract with the South African giants Orlando Pirates.

In his three years with the Orlando Pirates, he won two South African cups (and a finalist once) and won the national league, all in his last year in charge of the team. Those cups include MTN8 and Nedbank Cup. Despite that success his contract was not renewed.

He won the Tunisian championship with Sfaxien in 2012–13, after a fierce battle with the other three of the Tunisian big four.

After that success, he was contacted to lead the Tunisia national team in the play off qualifying to the 2014 world cup against Cameroon. He accepted that role and simultaneously became manager of Sfaxien and Tunisia in September 2013. 
He won the 2013 CAF Confederation Cup with Sfaxien. 
He resigned from his duties as Sfaxien coach after the second leg of the final against TP Mazembe on 30 November 2013. He quit as the national team interim coach following Tunisia&#x27;s loss in the World Cup play-off.

In January 2014, he was appointed new head coach of Tunisian side ES Tunis.

==Personal life==
On 6 July 1972, Krol married Yvonne van Ingen. The couple have a daughter. On 26 September 1974, together with teammate Arie Haan, he opened a snack bar on Reguliersbreestraat in Amsterdam.

<doc id="1298343" wikidata="Q335124" url="?curid=1298343" title="Aristobulus I">
<text>Judah Aristobulus I, or Aristobulus I (; ), was the High Priest of Israel and the first Hasmonean king of Judaea, reigning from 104 BCE until his death the following year. He was the eldest of the five sons of John Hyrcanus, the previous leader. The Roman-Jewish historian Josephus states that he was the first Jew in &quot;four hundred and eighty-three years and three months&quot; to have established a monarchy since the return from the Babylonian captivity. Aristobulus was the first Hebrew king to claim both the high priesthood and the kingship. The Sadducees and the Essenes were not concerned about Aristobulus taking the title of king, but the Pharisees, believing that the kingship could only be held by the descendants of the Davidic line, strongly opposed this. They launched a massive rebellion, but Aristobulus died before any attempt to depose him could be made.

The major sources on Aristobulus&#x27;s life from antiquity are Josephus&#x27;s &quot;The Jewish War&quot; and &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;. His reign is particularly noted for the Judaization of Galilee and the native Semitic people called the Ituraeans. Josephus, quoting from Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Historica Hypomnemata,&quot; described Aristobulus&#x27;s regime as kindly and &quot;very serviceable to the Jews&quot; on account of his conquests and the integration of &quot;a portion of the Ituraean nation whom he joined to them by the bond of circumcision.&quot;

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Aristobulus&quot; is of Greek origin and is an epithet meaning &quot;best-advising.&quot; Aristobulus I was the first Hasmonean to adopt the name, but his Hebrew name was Judah. He was also referred to as &quot;Philhellene&quot;, meaning he was an admirer of Greek culture. Josephus does not explain why he was called this.

== Early campaigns and monarchy established ==
Aristobulus and his brother Antigonus were entrusted by their father, John Hyrcanus, with the conquest of Samaria. They laid siege to the city, and when the inhabitants requested aid from the Seleucid Empire, they defeated a relief army led by Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. Antiochus successfully escaped to Scythopolis, but the brothers captured Samaria towards the end of John&#x27;s reign, razing the city and enslaving its inhabitants. Their forces subsequently captured Scythopolis and the entire region south of Mount Carmel. 

According to John Hyrcanus&#x27;s instructions, the country was to be placed in the hands of his wife after his death, and Aristobulus was originally to receive only the high priesthood. Instead, Aristobulus had his mother imprisoned, where she starved to death, thereby securing for himself both the high priesthood and the kingship. He then imprisoned all of his brothers, except for Antigonus, to protect himself from possible familial retaliation.

Josephus does not name Hyrcanus&#x27;s wife. He states that Aristobulus and Antigonus were the eldest of the five brothers, with Aristobulus being the firstborn. The other three were Alexander Jannaeus, Absalom, and a fifth brother, whom Josephus mentions but does not name.

== Conquest of Galilee ==
Aristobulus went to war against the Ituraeans and took territory from them. The conquered Ituraeans were compelled to accept Jewish law and circumcision to remain on their land. The Ituraeans were an Arab tribe that expanded southwards from the Lebanese Beq&#x27;a into the Golan Heights and Mount Hermon in the fourth century BCE following the collapse of the Seleucid Empire. They are first mentioned in Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities&quot; 13.319 during Aristobulus I&#x27;s conquest, where Josephus writes, &quot;He brought over to them a portion of the Ituraean nation.&quot;

Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities&quot; 13.319 is a quote from Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Historica Hypomnemata,&quot; originally written by Timagenes, and states, &quot;This man was a kindly person and very serviceable to the Jews, for he acquired additional territory for them and brought over to them a portion of the Ituraean nation, whom he joined to them by the bond of circumcision.&quot; This passage has been generally accepted as evidence of Josephus&#x27;s reliance on Strabo and Timagenes&#x27;s writings. The exact location of the confrontation and the territory that the Ituraeans occupied are unknown. Most scholars assume the Ituraean territory to be northern Galilee. According to Kenneth Atkinson, there is no evidence of forced Judaization in Galilee during Aristobulus&#x27;s reign.

== Death and successor ==
=== Feast of Tabernacles ===
With sudden abdominal pains, Aristobulus&#x27;s health gradually deteriorated, compelling him to return to his palace during the festival of Sukkot. His brother Antigonus eventually returned to Jerusalem to celebrate the festival at the Temple. Unfamiliar with ceremonial festivities, Antigonus arrived armed with escorting soldiers. According to Kenneth Atkinson, Antigonus had returned from a successful, unspecified military campaign. He further states that Josephus did not mention the location of the campaign. Atkinson presumes it to be Galilee since Antigonus had fine armour and military decorations procured in the region, as stated in Josephus&#x27;s &quot;Jewish War&quot; 1.76.

In his morbid state, Aristobulus fell prey to the factious influence of his wife, Queen Salome Alexandra, and conspirators. They had spread rumours about Antigonus attempting to seize the throne once he was seen in armour at the festival. Wearing a military uniform was considered unorthodox during the occasion. Aristobulus was then informed by &quot;evil men&quot; that his brother was sending soldiers to murder him, and Aristobulus became estranged from Antigonus after hearing this rumour. Believing the report, he lowered himself into the fortified citadel Baris, which was besieged and had defensive towers.

=== Death of Antigonus and Aristobulus ===
The queen, contemplating the possibility of being tortured and killed if Antigonus became king once Aristobulus died from his deteriorating health, deliberately advised Antigonus to enter, armed, into a meeting with his brother. However, he had been summoned to address suspicions of conspiracy against his brother&#x27;s life. The queen had bribed the messenger whom Aristobulus had sent to his brother; she altered the original message. Instead of having Antigonus arrive at his brother&#x27;s palace unarmed, she suggested that Antigonus should wear his new body armour, which he had made in Galilee as a presentation upon Aristobulus&#x27;s request. Incensed with suspicion at finding his brother armed, Aristobulus killed him. In frantic regret at this rash execution, Aristobulus&#x27;s health drastically declined until his death shortly thereafter. Queen Salome then released Aristobulus&#x27;s brothers, selecting Alexander Jannaeus as the next king.

== Coinage ==
The minting of Hasmonean coins did not commence until the leadership of John Hyrcanus. Like his father, Aristobulus minted his coins solely with the title of high priesthood, using Hebrew inscriptions. It was not until Alexander Jannaeus that both the roles of kingship and high priesthood were minted onto the coins. 

The majority of Aristobulus&#x27;s coins were discovered primarily in the regions of Galilee and Golan, with the largest quantity originating from Gamla. By 2016, archaeologists had unearthed thirty coins at Gamla, the largest quantity to date. Most of these coins were minted during his actual reign, while a small number were minted afterward.

The numismatic evidence does not suggest that Aristobulus assumed the title of king. There is also the possibility that the coins could be attributed to Aristobulus II (67–63 BCE), who was also a king and high priest. However, the longstanding debate has leaned more towards Aristobulus I, as new numismatic evidence indicates that Aristobulus I had his coins minted with the name &quot;Judah&quot;.

Due to his short reign of one year, only a small number of coins bearing the name &quot;Judah&quot; are available. Ya&#x27;akov Meshorer categorised them into two groups. Twenty coins are inscribed with &quot;Jehudah the high priest and the assembly of the Jews&quot;, and another seven with the same inscriptions. Each coin has a value of one &quot;prutah&quot; and bears the inscriptions in a wreath. On the opposite side, there is a cornucopia with pomegranates between them. The inscriptions on his coins are almost identical to those on the coins of his father and his brother Alexander Jannaeus.

Doubts concerning Josephus&#x27;s assertion that Aristobulus was the first Hasmonean monarch are indicated by his coins, which do not contain the title of &quot;king.&quot; Josephus&#x27;s statement also conflicts with Strabo, who states that Alexander Jannaeus was the first king rather than a high priest. However, no Hasmonean relinquished the high priesthood in favour of the kingship. 

According to Kenneth Atkinson, Alexander Jannaeus faced opposition for having the kingship title minted on his coins. Alexander had many of those coins overstruck to replace the kingship title with that of the high priesthood. Atkinson considers the overstruck coins as evidence that the title of &quot;king&quot; was still problematic during Alexander&#x27;s reign. Atkinson concludes that &quot;the absence of any royal designation on Aristobulus&#x27;s coins does not indicate that he was never an actual monarch.&quot;

==Legacy and historical debates==
The brief yet impactful reign of Aristobulus I left a lasting imprint on the Hasmonean dynasty, sparking historical debates about his true status as a monarch. While Josephus asserts that Aristobulus was the first Hasmonean king, numismatic evidence complicates this claim. The coins minted during Aristobulus&#x27;s rule do not bear the title of &quot;king,&quot; fueling doubts about his royal status. This discrepancy aligns with conflicting accounts from Strabo, who credits Alexander Jannaeus as the inaugural Hasmonean king. The enduring debate hinges on the intricacies of Hasmonean leadership, with scholars pondering whether Aristobulus held both the high priesthood and kingship simultaneously. The absence of the royal designation on his coins, reminiscent of the later hesitancy seen in Alexander Jannaeus&#x27;s reign, adds a layer of complexity to understanding the political dynamics within Hasmonean rule.

==Historical significance and religious tensions==
The dual assertion of high priesthood and kingship by Aristobulus I not only fueled debates among historians but also heightened religious tensions during his reign. The Pharisees, staunch believers in the Davidic lineage as the rightful kings, vehemently opposed Aristobulus&#x27;s claims to the throne. This ideological conflict resulted in a massive rebellion initiated by the Pharisees, seeking to depose Aristobulus. However, his untimely death pre-empted any resolution to this religious and political turmoil. The clash between traditionalist Pharisees and the Hasmonean monarch set the stage for subsequent power struggles within the Jewish community, contributing to the complex socio-political landscape of the time. Thus, the legacy of Aristobulus I extends beyond the numismatic uncertainties, encompassing the intricate interplay between religious convictions and political ambitions that characterised this pivotal period in Judean history.

<doc id="1298345" wikidata="Q1022023" url="?curid=1298345" title="Yukari Tamura">
<text>is a Japanese voice actress and singer affiliated with Amuleto. She released her debut single &quot;Yūki o Kudasai&quot; on March 26, 1997.

==Biography==
Born in Fukuoka Prefecture, Tamura gained fame as an advocate for the Lolita fashion movement, wearing Lolita-style clothing in public, and for her music releases, often in music videos and for album cover on CD releases. Affectionately called Yukarin by her fans, several of her releases have been used as opening and ending themes for anime series, while some have reached the Oricon top 100 singles and album charts. In 2001, Tamura and Yui Horie formed a unit called Yamato Nadeshiko. Two singles were released, &quot;Mō Hitori no Watashi&quot; and &quot;Merry Merrily&quot; - the latter of which was an insert song in the &quot;Love Hina&quot; Christmas Special.

On January 1, 2007, her talent management agency changed from Arts Vision to I&#x27;m Enterprise, a subsidiary of Arts Vision. On April 1, 2007, her record company officially changed from Konami to King Records. However, there was no material effect for her, because the actual record production of Konami is carried out by King Records. She is the narrator of anime satellite television network Animax.

In February 2016, her agency announced that a concert which had been announced during a Niconico livestream was cancelled in 2015. Her management also announced that her fan club would change ownership and her radio programs would end. Her staff&#x27;s Twitter account would be closed and her website would undergo maintenance. On February 13, 2016, her management announced that her contract with King Records would end on March 20. She changed her agency once more from I&#x27;m Enterprise to Amuleto.

<text>Interstate 676 (I-676) is an Interstate Highway that serves as a major thoroughfare through Center City Philadelphia, where it is known as the Vine Street Expressway, and Camden, New Jersey, where it is known as the northern segment of the North–South Freeway, as well as the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Highway in honor of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Its western terminus is at I-76 in Philadelphia near the Philadelphia Museum of Art and Fairmount Park. From there, it heads east and is then routed on surface streets near Franklin Square and Independence National Historical Park, home of the Liberty Bell, before crossing the Delaware River on the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. On the New Jersey side of the bridge, the highway heads south to its southern terminus at I-76 in Gloucester City near the Walt Whitman Bridge. Between the western terminus and downtown Camden, I-676 is concurrent with U.S. Route 30 (US 30).

After World War II, freeway approaches were planned for both sides of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which was completed in 1926 and serves as a part of US 30. In Pennsylvania, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the northern edge of Center City to the Schuylkill River, while, in New Jersey, the North–South Freeway was to head south along the Route 42 corridor. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, this stretch of highway was a part of I-80S, with Interstate 680 (I-680) continuing on the Schuylkill Expressway to the Walt Whitman Bridge. 

In 1964, the designations became I-76 and I-676, respectively, and, in 1972, the two routes were switched onto their current alignments. I-676 in New Jersey was completed between I-76 and Morgan Street by 1960 and north of there to downtown Camden by the 1980s. The Vine Street Expressway was opened from the Schuylkill Expressway to 18th Street by 1960 and east of there to I-95 on January 10, 1991, despite opposition from the adjacent community and other obstacles to construction. There are grade-level intersections with traffic signals in the connections between the Vine Street Expressway and the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. This intersection does not follow typical rules and regulations of the Interstate Highway System, and is also notorious for having high crash rates and pedestrian fatalities.

==Route description==
===Pennsylvania===

I-676 begins at an interchange with the Schuylkill Expressway (I-76 and US 30) in the city of Philadelphia in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, heading to the east on the six-lane Vine Street Expressway concurrent with US 30. It immediately crosses the Schuylkill River and then the Schuylkill River Trail and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Philadelphia Subdivision railroad line on the river&#x27;s east bank on the Vine Street Expressway Bridge, before coming to an interchange with 23rd Street and 22nd Street and the Benjamin Franklin Parkway that has access to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Franklin Institute science museum. From this point, the Vine Street Expressway enters a depressed road cut and passes under several streets and two freeway lids, running along the northern edge of Center City. Vine Street serves as a street-level frontage road to the freeway. Within this alignment, there is an exit for Pennsylvania Route 611 (PA 611; Broad Street). After passing under 10th Street in Chinatown, the last street the depressed alignment passes under, the highway rises up and reaches a split between the Vine Street Expressway, which continues to I-95, and I-676/US 30. At this split, there is also an eastbound exit and westbound entrance for 8th Street. After exiting the Vine Street Expressway, eastbound I-676/US 30 has a brief at-grade portion along southbound 6th Street east of Franklin Square to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge approach, where westbound and eastbound traffic actually have a traffic light intersecting Franklin Street and 6th Street respectively, an example of a non–limited access section of Interstate Highway. Westbound I-676/US 30 has a ramp from the bridge to the Vine Street Expressway that intersects 7th Street and 8th Street at-grade. From this point, I-676/US 30 crosses over I-95, Christopher Columbus Boulevard, and then the Delaware River on the seven-lane Benjamin Franklin Bridge, which also carries pedestrians and the PATCO Speedline. This bridge and its approaches are maintained by the Delaware River Port Authority (DRPA).

===New Jersey===

After crossing the bridge, the freeway enters the downtown area of the city of Camden in Camden County, New Jersey, and passes to the north of the former site of Campbell&#x27;s Field, a former baseball stadium. Upon entering New Jersey, I-676 becomes signed as a north–south road. There is a southbound ramp to 6th Street in Camden, which is near the toll plaza for northbound traffic. After the toll plaza, US 30 splits from I-676 at an interchange, at which point I-676 turns south as a six-lane freeway called the Martin Luther King Memorial Highway or the North–South Freeway. Immediately after the US 30 split, there is an interchange with County Route 537 (CR 537; Market Street/Federal Street) and Martin Luther King Boulevard that provides access to downtown Camden. Within this interchange, the highway passes over NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line. From this point, I-676 continues south through urban areas of the city, passing over several streets and running immediately to the west of Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CSAO)&#x27;s Vineland Secondary railroad line and the PATCO Speedline. The road heads southwest on a viaduct over neighborhoods before the interchange with CR 607 (Kaighns Avenue) and Atlantic Avenue. I-676 turns south at this junction, crossing over the Vineland Secondary. The highway continues south and passes over CSAO&#x27;s Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line before it comes to the exit for Morgan Boulevard. Past Morgan Boulevard, the freeway crosses the north branch of Newton Creek. Here, I-676 ends at an interchange east of the Walt Whitman Bridge with I-76, CR 630, and unsigned Route 76C, the latter being an access road to US 130 and Route 168. The North–South Freeway becomes a part of I-76 past this interchange and continues into the city of Gloucester City.

==History==

The Benjamin Franklin Bridge was opened on July 1, 1926, and was designated to carry US 30 across the Delaware River. A parkway called the Camden–Atlantic City Parkway was planned in 1932 to connect the Benjamin Franklin Bridge southeast to Atlantic City; this was never built. After World War II, freeway connections were planned on both sides of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. In Philadelphia, the Vine Street Expressway was planned to run along the Vine Street corridor to the present-day Schuylkill Expressway in 1945. The North–South Freeway was proposed in New Jersey as a connection from the bridge south along the Route 42 corridor. In 1950, the city of Philadelphia began planning the construction of the Vine Street Expressway, which would run along a depressed alignment through the city.
When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, the Vine Street Expressway, Benjamin Franklin Bridge, and part of the North–South Freeway were to become a part of it. In New Jersey, this Interstate was initially designated as FAI Corridor 109. In 1958, this freeway was initially planned as I-895 and I-380 before the American Association of State Highway Officials designated it as a part of I-80S. Meanwhile, I-680 was designated along the present-day Schuylkill Expressway between the Vine Street Expressway and the Walt Whitman Bridge. By 1960, the Vine Street Expressway had been completed between the Schuylkill Expressway and 18th Street. The portion of I-80S in New Jersey on the North–South Freeway had opened south of Morgan Boulevard by this time. On April 16, 1963, Pennsylvania wanted to renumber its Interstate numbers. Part of this was the renumbering from I-80S into I-76 and all of its auxiliary routes into I-X76. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) approved the request on February 26, 1964. As a result, I-80S became I-76 and I-680 became I-676. In 1972, the I-76 and the I-676 designations were switched onto their current routes. The remainder of the New Jersey portion of I-676 between Morgan Boulevard and US 30 was completed by the 1980s.
There were several challenges in building the Vine Street Expressway between 18th Street and the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. The road was to run through developed areas of Philadelphia, intersecting several streets and railroad lines. The Chinatown community organized in opposition to the highway construction through their neighborhood. In addition, the route was to run through Franklin Square, a historically sensitive site, to connect to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge. As a result, the routing was modified in 1966 to avoid many of these obstacles. The route was to avoid running through Franklin Square, leading to the eastbound direction using surface streets to access the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, and a planned connector to Market Street was removed. In the 1970s, the proposed freeway&#x27;s environmental impact statement (EIS) had to be evaluated again per new guidelines; when the new EIS was issued in 1977, it was found that more improvements were needed for mass transit in the area of the planned freeway. To comply with this, provisions were made concerning the proposed underground Center City Commuter Connection for SEPTA Regional Rail, in which the railroad tracks would pass under I-676 and residences would be built over the railroad tunnel in Chinatown. Construction was approved in 1986 on the Vine Street Expressway from 18th Street to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, with no provisions for elevated connections between the Benjamin Franklin Bridge and the Vine Street Expressway to avoid disturbing Franklin Square. This portion of the Vine Street Expressway opened to traffic on January 10, 1991, completing I-676.

On April 14, 2015, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) began work to rebuild seven existing overpasses on the Vine Street Expressway portion of I-676. The project, which cost $64.8 million (equivalent to $ in ), was to be completed in late 2019. Since 2021, the new overpasses started to have traffic. After the remnants of Hurricane Ida passed through the area on September 1, 2021, intense rain and floodwaters from the swollen Schuylkill River flooded the expressway after drainage pumps failed. I-676 through Philadelphia remained closed for three days.

In 2022, the city of Philadelphia applied for federal funds to initiate a study to cap the freeway and reconnect the affected neighborhoods to Center City. Capping the Vine Street Expressway is part of the 2017 Chinatown Neighborhood Plan. The city government selected a design in December 2023; at the time, the project was estimated to cost $160 million and be completed in the early 2030s. A $158.9 million federal grant was approved for the project in March 2024.

<text>Linda Ellerbee (born Linda Jane Smith; August 15, 1944) is an American journalist, anchor, producer, reporter, author, speaker and commentator, noted as longtime Washington correspondent for NBC News and host of &quot;NBC News Overnight&quot;. She is widely known as the twenty-five year host of &quot;Nick News&quot;, Nickelodeon&#x27;s highly rated and recognized news program for older school-aged children and teens that addressed substantive issues, including wars, disease and disasters, without condescension.

Ellerbee&#x27;s work on &quot;NBC News Overnight&quot; was recognized by the jurors of the duPont Columbia Awards as &quot;possibly the best written and most intelligent news program ever.&quot; Described as literate, smart, unapologetic, assertive and keenly observant, Ellerbee formally retired in 2015, after 43 years in journalism.

==Early life==
Ellerbee was born Linda Jane Smith in Bryan, Texas. She attended River Oaks Elementary School, Lanier Middle School, and Lamar High School in Houston.

She also attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, dropping out in 1964. Ellerbee traveled around the country for some time afterward, working itinerant jobs in radio. Ellerbee wrote:

After a stint working for Terry Miller, majority leader of the Alaska Senate, she was hired by the Dallas bureau of the Associated Press to write copy. She claims to have been fired after writing a catty personal letter on the AP&#x27;s word processors and accidentally sending the letter out on the wire. The letter brought her to the attention of Houston CBS television affiliate KHOU-TV, which hired her to replace Jessica Savitch in January 1973. Within several months, she was hired by New York&#x27;s WCBS-TV.

==Career==
At NBC, Ellerbee worked as a reporter on &quot;Today&quot;. Her first anchor job was on the prime-time version of &quot;Weekend&quot;. Ellerbee joined Lloyd Dobyns as co-host of &quot;Weekend&quot; when the show moved from its late-night time slot (where it rotated with &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, generally one Saturday night per month) into direct prime time competition with CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. As with the late-night incarnation, they would sign-off with the phrase, &quot;And so it goes.&quot;

In 1982, Ellerbee was again teamed with Dobyns (and later Bill Schechner) as hosts of &quot;NBC News Overnight&quot;, where their trademark writing style made the show somewhat reminiscent of their stint on &quot;Weekend&quot;. They ended each broadcast with a short, usually wry, commentary, again signing off with the catch-phrase, &quot;And so it goes,&quot; which later became the title of her first memoir. While at NBC, Ellerbee worked with Jessica Savitch; when Savitch&#x27;s drug problems became apparent Ellerbee tried to organize an intervention, but Savitch died before that happened.

In 1984, after the cancellation of &quot;Overnight&quot;, Ellerbee moved to &quot;Summer Sunday USA&quot;, as co-anchor with Andrea Mitchell, the first time a prime-time network news program was co-anchored by two women. She was then a correspondent for &quot;Today&quot; before moving to rival network ABC in 1986. There she served as a reporter for the morning program &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. At ABC, Ellerbee was able to co-write and co-anchor (with Ray Gandolf) &quot;Our World&quot;, a weekly primetime historical series. She won an Emmy Award for her work on that program.

In 1987, Ellerbee and her husband and business partner Rolfe Tessem left network news to start their own production company, Lucky Duck Productions. The company has produced programs for every major cable network, and has as its flagship program &quot;Nick News&quot;, a news program for children on Nickelodeon. That show has received many awards: three Peabody Awards (including one personal Peabody given to Ellerbee for her coverage of the Clinton investigation), another duPont Columbia Award and three Emmys. In 2004, Ellerbee was honored with an Emmy for her WE: Women&#x27;s Entertainment network series &quot;When I Was a Girl&quot;.

In 1989, she guest-starred as herself in an episode of the sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;. The episode &quot;Summer of &#x27;77&quot; referenced that Ellerbee had auditioned for the anchor job which eventually went to the title character, played by Candice Bergen. In the episode, Murphy Brown also accuses Ellerbee of stealing the catchphrase &quot;And so it goes&quot; from her during a long-haul flight. The two reminisce, with Ellerbee saying she might like to go back to an old network job, and Brown wanting to take some time off to write a book. Both reply with &quot;Nahh&quot;.

Also in 1989, Ellerbee created a minor uproar by appearing in television commercials for Maxwell House coffee. The New York Times said the commercials were poorly done even as advertisements, but also betrayed her trademark &quot;uncompromising intellectual honesty&quot; and &quot;sardonic wit&quot; — and were mercenary, &quot;devaluing both broadcast news and broadcast advertising.&quot; Because of the format of the commercials, set with a mock anchor&#x27;s background, Advertising Age said &quot;this is advertising news disguised as NBC news.&quot; Ellerbee would later share that journalist Jimmy Breslin called to supportively remind her that when he made a beer commercial, they let him keep his Pulitzer Prize.

Her autobiography, &quot;And So It Goes&quot;, was published in 1986. A second book of memoirs, &quot;Move On: Adventures in the Real World&quot;, was published in 1991 and a third, &quot;Take Big Bites: Adventures Around the World and Across the Table&quot;, in 2005. In addition, she has authored an eight-part series of &quot;Girl Reporter&quot; books for young people, as well as a syndicated newspaper column.

==Cancer survivor==
In 1992, Ellerbee was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a double mastectomy. Since then, she has spent much of her time speaking to groups about how she fought the cancer and how women need to fight the disease, demand better medical treatment, and maintain a healthy sense of humor.

<text>Eastland Shopping Centre is a super-regional shopping centre complex located in the eastern Melbourne suburb of Ringwood, Victoria, Australia. The fourth-largest shopping centre in Australia, it first opened on 31 October 1967 and has since grown to host over 340 retail stores and services.

It is adjacent to Maroondah Highway, Ringwood railway station and a major bus interchange. The centre features two main levels of shops, with a third level containing a Hoyts 12-screen cinema complex and restaurants, forming a total of approximately 530 stores. Eastland also contains a library, 120 room hotel and large outdoor dining precinct. It is the largest shopping centre in the City of Maroondah.

==History==
===Inception===
Eastland was one of three large shopping centres planned by the department store Myer in Melbourne in 1960. Together with Northland in Preston and Southland in Cheltenham, these were the first indoor shopping centres in Victoria.

After years of planning, the tender from Eastland Shopping Centre Pty. Ltd. was accepted by Ringwood City Council on 1 February 1966. It was leased from the Council for 30 years on the site of a public park and sportsground. Some private properties were also compulsorily acquired by the Council to make way for the centre, including 13 houses, 14 shops and a private hospital. This was unsuccessfully challenged by the landowners in the High Court of Australia. It was the first time that these compulsory acquisition powers were used by a local government in Victoria.

The plan for a new shopping centre in Ringwood was heralded by some, believing it would bring new investment and people into the area, and opposed by others, who feared traffic congestion and other impacts from the forecast 150,000 extra visitors to the area.

===Construction===
Construction commenced on the two-level enclosed complex in July 1966 on the site of a former sporting field. This caused significant disruption and change in Ringwood, now seen as an increasingly important suburban centre. The Ringwood Clock Tower, located on the corner of Main Street and Warrandyte Road, was moved to make way for construction of new roads and car parking to service the new buildings. It remains today on this new site on the corner of Main Street and the Maroondah Highway. Many existing buildings and vegetation were also demolished or moved.

The complex was finished on 31 October 1967. Myer and Safeway were the major anchor tenants together with 40 speciality stores and a 1250 space car park. The initial centre cost $13,000,000 (1966) ($167,568,115.94 (2017)) to construct on a parcel of land just north of the Maroondah Highway.

There was a minor expansion in 1973 when two new storeys and a carpark were built by demolishing houses on nearby Ringwood Street.

===Redevelopment (1993-1995)===
In 1993, a massive redevelopment of the centre was announced. This $120 million project involved the demolition of the existing centre in its entirety except for the 4-storey Myer building which was instead refurbished. More existing commercial and residential buildings were demolished to make way for new car parking. After a series of three staged openings, the &#x27;new look&#x27; Eastland was relaunched in May 1995 after it closed in March 1994. This extension brought the centre to with major retailers Myer, Woolworths and Kmart and 170 specialty retailers.

In December 1996, the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC) purchased Coles Myer&#x27;s 50% shareholding.

===First expansion (2002)===
In early 2001, QIC announced plans for an expansion of the new buildings. This included a Hoyts 12 screen cinema complex, new restaurants (including a Pancake Parlour), a Big W store, and a Bi-Lo Mega Fresh store. A regular Bi-Lo store opened instead in October 2002 with the cinemas opening on 26 December later in the same year. This brought an additional 50 specialty stores to the centre, increasing its retail area by approximately and bringing the total number of car parking spaces to 4,878.

===Second expansion (2013-2016)===
Plans for further expansion of the centre were created in the mid-2000s. This was partially funded by the State Government committing $44.5 million over 2007 and 2008 for planning and construction. Development was originally scheduled to commence in 2009 but this was delayed due to the Global Financial Crisis.

Enabling works commenced in 2012 allowing for changes to be made to the Eastern Multilevel carpark; the entry ramp to the third level of the carpark was moved, and the Kmart Tyre &amp; Auto Service centre was relocated to the North-Western carpark. 

QIC publicly unveiled the plans on 28 October 2013. The $665 million redevelopment expanded retail space from and included construction of an additional three storeys connecting the southern end of the centre with the Maroondah Highway. This included a new entrance to the third level of Myer, an outdoor public square with food and beverage outlets and a new public library. Office and hotel towers were also proposed adjacent to the new precinct together with a Target and David Jones department stores.

The first stage of the redevelopment opened almost two years later in October 2015 with the second on 5 May 2016. 

In January 2024, David Jones closed their store at Eastland. 

===Future development===
The adjacent Ringwood Market site, built in 1984, is also owned by the same company that controls Eastland. It was demolished in 2009 to make way for a new retail/commercial development. The space was planned to be occupied by one of Costco, IKEA and Masters Home Improvement shops. Since then, Melbourne&#x27;s second Costco Australia store was confirmed with construction commencing in August 2012. The store was opened on 20 November 2013, although a planned underground connection to Eastland was not built.

A second office tower on Bond Street is under construction and scheduled to open in 2024.

==Retail==
Major retailers include Myer, H&amp;M, Uniqlo, Target, Kmart, Big W, Harris Scarfe, Cotton On, Woolworths, Coles, Rebel Sport and JB Hi-Fi.

==Legacy and significance==
Eastland was the first indoor shopping centre to be built in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne.

The band AC/DC performed at Eastland in September 1975 as part of their High Voltage tour of Australia.

<text>Audley Hugh Harrison, (born 26 October 1971) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 2001 to 2013. As an amateur, he represented Great Britain at the 2000 Olympics, winning a gold medal in the super-heavyweight division and becoming the first ever British boxer to win Olympic gold in that division. Harrison turned professional the following year after signing a contract with BBC Sport, and went on to have seventeen fights on the network before their cancellation of all boxing broadcasts.

In his professional career he challenged for the WBA, British, and Commonwealth heavyweight titles. In 2009, Harrison won the Prizefighter tournament, his first of two. He became the European heavyweight champion in 2010, after defeating Michael Sprott in a rematch of their 2007 bout. In 2013, Harrison won his second Prizefighter tournament, becoming the first boxer to do so.

==Amateur career==
Boxing out of Repton Amateur Boxing Club in Bethnal Green, London, Harrison became British super heavyweight champion in 1997, defeating Nick Kendall in the final. He retained the title in 1998, defeating Dean Redmond, and won gold at the 1998 Commonwealth Games beating Michael Macquae of Mauritius in the final. In 2000 he won gold at the Sydney Olympics by defeating Mukhtarkhan Dildabekov of Kazakhstan on points. After his medal win, Harrison was awarded an MBE.

===Highlights===

**Defeated Alexey Mazikin (Ukraine) points
**Defeated Paolo Vidoz (Italy) points
**Defeated Mukhtarkhan Dildabekov (Kazakhstan) points

==Professional career==
In 2001, Harrison released his autobiography &quot;Realising the Dream&quot; and set up his own company, A Force Promotions, to manage his career and concluded several high-profile sponsorships deals and became the first boxer in Britain to sign a direct broadcast deal.

He signed a £1 million deal with the BBC to show his first ten professional fights.

His debut was against US club fighter Michael Middleton, whom Harrison knocked out in the first round in Wembley Arena with 6 million viewers watching at home. He was then out of action for several months with an injury, but by the end of the year outpointed Briton Derek McCafferty over six rounds.

Harrison continued to win and made his United States debut in November 2002, knocking out Shawn Robinson in the 1st round. In February 2003 he beat US fighter Rob Calloway in four rounds, and outpointed Ratko Draskovic over eight rounds. Harrison then knocked out Matt Ellis in two rounds. Harrison then tried to arrange a fight with 41-year-old ex-World champion Frank Bruno, who had been retired for seven years. A dispute at York Hall, Bethnal Green with the Herbie Hide after the Ellis fight resulted in a riot. The proposed Frank Bruno fight collapsed shortly afterwards, when Bruno was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Harrison and Hide were both penalised by the British Boxing Board of Control for the riot.

===America bound===
Following the Ellis riot, Harrison relocated to the USA where he was unbeaten in 11 fights, with 8 knockouts. In the 2003 November issue of the Ring Magazine, Harrison was tipped to emulate Lennox Lewis and become a dominant world champion.

He had three more fights in 2003, against Lisandro Diaz (KO4), Quinn Navarre (KO3), and Brian Nix (KO3), in America. Harrison was sparring regularly with experienced world class Heavyweights like Vaughn Bean.

Harrison returned to the UK in 2004, but instead of fighting new British champion Michael Sprott for the British title, he fought unbeaten Dutch fighter Richel Hersisia for the World Boxing Foundation (WBFo) World belt. He knocked out Hersisia in 4 rounds. He defended the title twice: a 12-round points win over late-sub Julius Francis, and a 9th-round TKO of unbeaten Tomasz Bonin. After suffering a serious ligament tear in his left hand requiring hand surgery in New York, Harrison did not fight for almost a year.

===BBC deal ends===
Harrison&#x27;s contract was not renewed in 2004 and the BBC stopped broadcasting professional boxing.

Harrison returned to the ring in June 2005, knocking out Robert Davis (KO7) and Robert Wiggins (KO4). On &quot;The Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; he said he was now ready to step up and face world class opponents and get a title shot.

===Loss of form===
Harrison returned to the UK in December to face long-time bitter rival Danny Williams in London for the Commonwealth title. Harrison stepped in after Matt Skelton had pulled out and took the bout on five weeks notice. Harrison lost a close, split decision.

In April 2006, Harrison fought in the US against Dominick Guinn and again lost on points. Harrison put the defeat down to loss of confidence from his defeat to Williams and insisted he would bounce back. In June, he scored a three-round knockout of Andrew Greeley in an off-TV fight in America, and was poised for a fight with Matt Skelton to try to resurrect his career. Skelton had beaten Danny Williams in July, winning the title Williams had earlier taken from Harrison. When Skelton dropped out only one week before the fight due to injury, Danny Williams replaced him.

Williams had trained 8 weeks for a fight with British champion Scott Gammer. This time Harrison fought far more aggressively, decking Williams twice and winning on a third-round knockout. Williams suffered a broken nose and severe lacerations, and Harrison was once again lauded as a contender for a world title. Following the victory over Williams, Harrison signed a promotional deal with Frank Warren, whose aim was to get Harrison a world title fight in 2007.

On 17 February 2007, Harrison was knocked out by Michael Sprott for the European Union title. This third professional loss left Harrison&#x27;s future uncertain. Harrison claimed that he could make a comeback, but Warren suggested that any return to the ring would be for a reduced purse, since the public would have no great interest.

Harrison returned to fight Paul King for a bout scheduled for 29 September 2007 in Sheffield. However, he and his coach Kelvyn Travis were involved in a car accident on 21 September 2007 in the United States, and Harrison suffered injuries that caused the fight to be cancelled. Harrison had also suggested that a deal would be announced involving promoter Dennis Hobson, but the cancellation of the fight meant that a formal announcement was on hold. Harrison underwent surgery for his injuries, and returned on 19 April 2008, beating the American Jason Barnett in the fifth round on the undercard of the Bernard Hopkins vs. Joe Calzaghe fight at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. This bout was the first of a new multi-bout agreement between Harrison and Warren, which aimed to get Harrison a world title shot in 2009.

After proposed matches with Samuel Peter and Martin Rogan fell through, on 6 September 2008 Harrison gained what the BBC described as &quot;an unconvincing victory&quot; over George Arias at the MEN Arena in Manchester. The fight was overshadowed by Amir Khan&#x27;s first defeat later on the same card. On 6 December 2008, Harrison&#x27;s career seemed all but over as he was defeated by the winner of the first &quot;Prizefighter&quot; tournament and Belfast taxi driver, Martin Rogan. The referee scored the contest 96–95 in favour of the Irishman.

===Comeback===
Harrison signed for the &quot;Prizefighter&quot; tournament, an eight-man, one-night knockout tournament that took place at ExCeL London on 2 October 2009. On 1 October 2009, he weighed in for &quot;Prizefighter&quot; at 18 stones and half a pound. He went on to win the tournament, by way of second round knock-out against Coleman Barrett. Before that, he had knocked out Scott Belshaw and won a unanimous decision over Danny Hughes. Following his success in the &quot;Prizefighter&quot; tournament, it was announced on 15 January 2010 that Harrison would face Albert Sosnowski for the European Boxing Union heavyweight title, with the fight set for 9 April 2010. However Sosnowski called the bout off for a shot at Vitali Klitschko&#x27;s WBC title.

On 9 April 2010, Harrison won the vacant EBU belt against old foe Michael Sprott at Alexandra Palace. He knocked out Sprott in the final round despite being behind on all three judges scorecards. Harrison claimed he sustained a shoulder injury early in the fight and had to carry on single-handed. BBC Sport said of the fight: &quot;Having come within seconds of a defeat that would have made a mockery of pre-fight assertions that he could face one of the Klitschko brothers for a world title, Harrison said: &#x27;I had to win it somehow.

On 24 April 2010, Harrison underwent surgery in Cheadle, Greater Manchester to repair the torn Pectoralis major muscle. The surgeon said he expected Harrison to make a &quot;full recovery in about 12 to 16 weeks&quot;.

===World title challenge vs. David Haye===

On 8 June 2010, Harrison vacated his European title, announcing his intention of getting a world title shot. He began negotiations with Hayemaker Promotions soon after, which culminated in a world-title fight in the M.E.N. Arena against WBA champion David Haye on 13 November 2010.

Harrison was defeated by Haye, with the fight being stopped in the third round after Harrison was unable to respond to a barrage of punches from Haye. Statistics from the fight showed that Harrison only landed a single punch in the entire duration of the contest.

Harrison was heavily criticised for his performance after the bout. British and Commonwealth champion Derek Chisora stated, &quot;I&#x27;d never show my face again if I fought like that. It was pathetic. He disgraced himself and he disgraced British heavyweights, he shouldn&#x27;t get paid the reported million pounds he is earning after that shambles.&quot; European light-heavyweight champion Nathan Cleverly also voiced his discontent with the fight, adding Harrison should now retire. Due to the nature of Harrison&#x27;s defeat, the BBBofC withheld some of the fighter&#x27;s purse while a full investigation of the bout was carried out. After the investigation into the fight was concluded, Harrison was granted his full purse on 11 January 2011.

===After defeat by David Haye through to retirement===
On 3 December 2010, it was confirmed Harrison would continue his career as a professional boxer despite calls for him to retire. Former British and Commonwealth champion Derek Chisora was critical of the decision, stating, &quot;He&#x27;s going to box on, but who&#x27;s going to buy the tickets to go and watch him? Even if he gives them to you for free are you going to go and watch? ... Good luck to Audley anyway.&quot;

On 15 November 2011, during an interview on BBC Breakfast following his departure from &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, Harrison announced that he would return to boxing for one last time saying &quot;It could be over, but I just need to go and check.&quot; He stated his intention was to fight British Heavyweight Champion Tyson Fury in 2012.

Harrison returned to the ring on 26 May 2012 and boxed Ali Adams at the Brentwood Centre, Essex for the International Masters Championships. Harrison sent his opponent to the canvas with a right hand and although Adams managed to get to his feet, a flurry of follow-up shots from Harrison prompted the referee to step in and end the contest.

Harrison faced David Price on 13 October 2012, and lost the fight by knockout after 82 seconds of the first round.
Harrison announced that he would not retire from boxing and will box on.

On 23 February 2013 Harrison won the &quot;Prizefighter 29: The International Heavyweights III&quot; tournament, defeating Derric Rossy in the final.

On 27 April 2013, Harrison stepped into the ring to fight the unbeaten American prospect Deontay Wilder, who had a record of 27 wins, all knockouts [27–0–0]. Wilder had not been beyond 4 rounds in his professional career. The bout only lasted a mere 70 seconds of the first round. Wilder landed a right hand which wobbled Harrison, Wilder then rushed in with a flurry of wild punches. Harrison was knocked down but managed to beat the count. However, the referee then stopped the bout, deeming Harrison unable to continue. Wilder won via TKO, his 28th consecutive knockout.

On 1 May 2013, Harrison announced his retirement from boxing. However just 20 days later, he came out of retirement with intentions to box on.

On 26 March 2014, Harrison announced he was no longer a professional boxer, and would not return to the ring.

<text>The first Battle of Smolensk (, &#x27;Cauldron-battle at Smolensk&#x27;; ) was a battle during the second phase of Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, in World War II. It was fought around the city of Smolensk between 10 July and 10 September 1941, about west of Moscow. The Ostheer had advanced into the USSR in the 18 days after the invasion on 22 June 1941.

The Soviet 16th, 19th and the 20th armies were encircled and destroyed just to the east of Smolensk, though many of the men from the 19th and 20th armies managed to escape the pocket. While the battle was a stunning operational success for the Germans, the rapid advances into Soviet territory led to supply and logistics crises of increasing severity, as German supply lines were stretched to their limit. Following the Smolensk encirclement, much of Army Group Centre became mired in positional warfare, suffering significant losses in defensive battles throughout the late summer of 1941. These factors seriously depleted the offensive strength of the German divisions, and contributed to the disastrous setbacks later suffered in the Battle of Moscow in December 1941.

==Background and planning==
On 22 June 1941, the Axis nations invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. At first, the campaign met with spectacular success, as the surprised Soviet troops were not able to offer coordinated resistance. After three weeks of fighting, the Germans had reached the Dvina and Dnieper rivers and planned for a resumption of the offensive. The main attack, aimed at Moscow, was carried out by Army Group Centre (Fedor von Bock). Its next target on the way to the Soviet capital was the city of Smolensk. The German plan called for the 2nd Panzer Group (later 2nd Panzer Army) to cross the Dnieper, closing on Smolensk from the south, while the 3rd Panzer Group (later 3rd Panzer Army) was to encircle the town from the north.

After their initial defeats, the Red Army began to recover and took measures to ensure a more determined resistance and new defensive line was established around Smolensk. Stalin placed Field Marshal Semyon Timoshenko in command and transferred five armies out of the strategic reserve to Timoshenko. These armies had to conduct counter-offensives to blunt the German drive. The German high command (OKW) was not aware of the Soviet build-up until they encountered them on the battlefield.

Facing the Germans along the Dnieper and Dvina rivers were stretches of the Stalin Line fortifications. The defenders were the 13th Army of the Western Front and the 20th Army, 21st Army and the 22nd Army of the Soviet Supreme Command (Stavka) Reserve. The 19th Army was forming up at Vitebsk, while the 16th Army was arriving at Smolensk.

In Soviet histories, the great Battle (&quot;Srazheniye&quot;) of Smolensk (10 July – 10 September 1941) is divided into the following phases and operations:
*Smolensk Defensive Operation (10 July – 10 August 1941)
*Smolensk Offensive Operation (21 July – 7 August 1941)
*Rogechev-Zhlobin Offensive Operation (13–24 July 1941)
*Gomel-Trubchevsk Defensive Operation (24 July – 30 August 1941)
*Dukhovschina Offensive Operation (17 August – 8 September 1941)
*Yelnia Offensive Operation (30 August – 8 September 1941)
*Roslavl-Novozybkov Offensive Operation (30 August – 12 September 1941)

The German Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) lists the following operations around Smolensk:
* Battle of Smolensk (8 July – 5 August 1941)
* Defensive battle near Smolensk and Yelnya (26 July – 1 October 1941)
* Battle of Roslavl (1–9 August 1941)
* Battle of Krichev and Gomel (9–20 August 1941)
* Battle of Velikiye Luki (22–27 August 1941)

==The operation==
===Phase One: The encirclement battle, and the first Soviet counterattacks===
Prior to the German attack, the Soviets launched a counter-offensive; on 6 July, the 7th and 5th Mechanized Corps of the Soviet 20th Army attacked with about 1,500 tanks near Lepiel. The result was a disaster, as the offensive ran directly into the anti-tank defenses of the German 7th Panzer Division and the two Soviet mechanized corps were virtually wiped out.

On 10 July, Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Group began a surprise attack over the Dnieper, his forces overran the weak 13th Army and by 13 July, Guderian had passed Mogilev, trapping several Soviet divisions. His spearhead unit, the 29th Motorised Division, was already within of Smolensk. The 3rd Panzer Group had attacked, with the 20th Panzer Division establishing a bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Dvina river, threatening Vitebsk. As both German panzer groups drove east, the 16th, 19th and 20th armies faced the prospect of encirclement west of Smolensk. From 11 July, the Soviets tried a series of concerted counter-attacks. The Soviet 19th Army and 20th Army struck at Vitebsk, while the 21st and the remnants of the 3rd Army attacked against the southern flank of 2nd Panzer Group near Bobruisk.

Several other Soviet armies also attempted to counter-attack in the sectors of the German Army Group North and Army Group South. This effort was apparently part of an attempt to implement the Soviet prewar general defense plan. The Soviet attacks managed to slow the Germans but the results were so marginal that the Germans barely noticed them as a large coordinated defensive effort and the German offensive continued.

Hoth&#x27;s 3rd Panzer Group drove north and then east, parallel to Guderian&#x27;s forces, taking Polotsk and Vitebsk. The 7th Panzer Division and 20th Panzer Division reached the area east of Smolensk at Yartsevo on 15 July. At the same time, the 29th Motorized Division, supported by the 17th Panzer Division broke into Smolensk, captured the city except for the suburbs and began a week of house-to-house fighting against counter-attacks by the 16th Army. Guderian expected that the offensive would continue towards Moscow as its main focus and sent the 10th Panzer Division to the Desna River to establish a bridgehead on the east bank at Yelnya and cleared that as well by the 20th. This advanced bridgehead became the center of the Yelnya Offensive, one of the first big coordinated Soviet counter-offensives of the war.

This objective (Yelnya) was south of the Dnieper and well clear of the objective of liquidating the armies trapped at Smolensk. Under Fuhrer Directive 33 issued on 14 July, the main effort of the Wehrmacht was re-orientated away from Moscow towards a deep encirclement of Kiev in Ukraine and Bock was becoming impatient, wanting Guderian to strike north and link up with Hoth&#x27;s Panzer Group so resistance in the city could be mopped up.

On 27 July, Bock held a conference at Novy Borisov, which was also attended by Commander-in-Chief Walther von Brauchitsch, the head of the OKH, the High Command of the Army. The generals were required to sit without an opportunity to comment, while a memorandum was read to them by one of Brauchitsch&#x27;s aides, instructing them that they were to strictly follow Fuhrer Directive 33 and were under no circumstance to try to push further east. They were ordered to concentrate on mopping up, refurbishing equipment, restocking supplies and straightening the German front line, which had become more of an &quot;S&quot; shape, due to the advances of Guderian and Hoth. Coming away from this meeting, Hoth and Guderian were angry and frustrated. Guderian wrote in his journal that night that Hitler &quot;preferred a plan by which small enemy forces were to be encircled and destroyed piecemeal and the enemy thus bled to death. All the officers who took part in the conference were of the opinion that this was incorrect&quot;. Whether or not this was true, it was this meeting that some have pointed to that marked a critical point where the Wehrmacht leadership broke trust with Hitler. After returning to his post, Guderian conspired with Hoth and Bock to &quot;delay the implementation&quot; of Directive 33, in defiance of the orders of the Fuhrer and OKH. Guderian hastily put together a plan of attack for his and Hoth&#x27;s forces for 1 August, the Roslavl-Novozybkov Offensive Operation.
In the north, the 3rd Panzer Group was moving much more slowly. The terrain was swampy, made worse by rain and the Soviets were fought to escape the trap. On 18 July, the armored pincers of the two panzer groups came within of closing the gap. Timoshenko put newly promoted Konstantin Rokossovsky, who had just arrived from the Ukrainian front, in charge of assembling a stopgap force, which held the attack of the 7th Panzer Division and with continuous reinforcements, temporarily stabilized the situation. The open gap allowed Soviet units to escape that were then pressed into service, holding the gap open.

The Soviets transferred additional troops from newly formed armies into the region around Smolensk, namely the 29th, 30th, 28th, and 24th Armies. These newly built formations would, immediately upon arrival, start a heavy counter-attack against the German forces around the Smolensk area from 21 July on. This put a heavy strain on the overextended Panzer forces, which had to cover a large area around the perimeter. However, poor coordination and logistics on the part of the Soviets allowed the Germans to successfully defend against these offensive efforts, while continuing to close the encirclement. The Soviet attacks would last until 30 July, when the Germans finally repelled the last of them.

Finally, on 27 July, the Germans were able to link up and close the pocket east of Smolensk, trapping large portions of 16th, 19th, and 20th Armies. Under the leadership of 20th Army, Soviet troops managed to break out of the pocket in a determined effort a few days later, assisted by the Soviet offensive efforts along the Smolensk front line. On 5 August von Bock reported that a total of 309,000 prisoners had been captured during the Battle of Smolensk at all. This number later increased to 350,000. Thus, only about 50,000 people from the encircled 16th and 20th armies escaped from the &quot;cauldron&quot; by 7 August.

===Phase Two: The German offensives on the flanks and the further Soviet counteroffensives===

After the battle for encirclement near Smolensk ended on 5 August, the opponents drew different conclusions. The Soviet command was satisfied that they managed to restore the front line on the road to Moscow and save part of the encircled armies. It was decided to continue to strike at the opposing German forces, despite high losses. Thus, from their point of view, the battle was just beginning. In the following month, there were two major Soviet offensives: 6–24 August and 29 August – 12 September 1941. The Battle of Smolensk was a critical engagement during the early stages of Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. It highlighted the fierce resistance of the Red Army despite the initial successes of the Wehrmacht. The battle resulted in significant casualties on both sides, but the Soviets viewed their ability to regroup and launch counteroffensives as a strategic success. From the German perspective, the battle demonstrated their ability to conduct large-scale encirclement operations, capturing significant numbers of Soviet troops and matériel. However, the delays caused by the stubborn Soviet defense had strategic implications. The time and resources consumed at Smolensk delayed the German advance towards Moscow, contributing to the eventual failure to capture the Soviet capital before the onset of winter. 

The first Soviet offensive from 6 to 24 August aimed to disrupt the German advance and relieve pressure on the encircled Soviet forces. Despite suffering heavy losses, the Red Army managed to slow down the German momentum. This period saw intense fighting, with both sides committing substantial forces to achieve their objectives.

The second offensive, from 29 August to 12 September, was marked by a renewed Soviet effort to regain lost territory and stabilize the front line. The Soviet High Command, Stavka, was determined to exploit any German weaknesses and inflict maximum damage. The continued Soviet resistance and counterattacks forced the Germans to divert troops and resources, which further strained their operational capabilities. These offensives, although costly, demonstrated the Soviet Union&#x27;s resolve and ability to adapt to the rapidly changing battlefield conditions. The Red Army&#x27;s persistence in the face of adversity played a crucial role in halting the German advance and buying time for the Soviet Union to mobilize its vast resources for the defense of Moscow and other key areas.

In conclusion, the Battle of Smolensk and the subsequent Soviet offensives underscored the resilience and determination of the Red Army. While the Germans achieved significant tactical victories, the strategic outcome favored the Soviets by delaying the German timetable and setting the stage for the eventual Soviet counteroffensive. The lessons learned from these engagements would shape the conduct of both sides in the brutal and protracted conflict that followed on the Eastern Front.

Soviets did make progress and pushed Germans back, but movement forward was rather slow. The main reason for this was the quality of German defense. Soviets small unit tactics were implemented with depleted companies even before the operation began, as seen on the example of the 900th Rifle Regiment, which was part of the 242nd Rifle Division. Rifle Regiment attacking village of Svity was composed of 79 rifles (soldiers able to attack the enemy). 

Staying on small unit tactics, switch to night operations yielded good results and Soviets were not only able to close in on enemy positions but to push the Germans back in close combat. Clandestine movement to get as close as possible to the German positions, quiet sprint to the positions, and engagement, including rifle fire and bayonet attack. Attacks on this sector would be supported by artillery, both anti-aircraft used in ground role and divisional level support in the form of Artillery Support Group (ASG) 900.

German small unit opposing the 900th Rifle Regiment at this time were the elements of the 240th Infantry Regiment of the 106th Infantry Division, and 900 Mechanized Lehr Brigade and its Panzerjäger 1 tank destroyers. After initial night attack described above, the Germans adjusted and began counterattacking and winning the ground they would lose earlier in the night, inflicting heaviest casualties in 25 July to 5 August. Heavy casualties were by Soviet small unit leader&#x27;s assessments, not by current assessments of Western historians. Specifics: 200 Soviet soldiers involved in the night attack which was not successful. 5th Rifle Company (of 2nd Rifle Battalion, 900th Rifle Regiment) reported 18 MIA, 11 wounded. The 519th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion which was attacking the German positions with it reported 4 KIA, 7 WIA from that one attack. Total 7 KIA, 18 MIA, 18 WIA.

This is radically different than assessments made before about the methodology of Soviet attacks and how the casualties were sustained versus Germans in general. Lets look at this in detail. First reason for this discovery may be in that the Soviet regimental, company, and personal documents of soldiers are not usually examined, and the small unit losses would be extrapolated from divisional level, at best. Most quality authors would be doing small unit combat loss assessments from statistical analysis of Krivosheev&#x27;s work on Soviet combat losses, which is a very large data set Front, STAVKA and above level. Extrapolations from large data sets led them to the conclusion that the attacks themselves were a lot bloodier than they actually were due to losses sustained from bombings and artillery bombardments, or many other scenarios which caused legitimate Soviet divisional level losses, for example. Another reason still, is the fact that some Soviet units would be attacking over the span of days, resulting in accumulation of losses over time, and not sustaining it in a single attack. In other words, tip of the Soviet spear may have been being blunted at a slower rate, while casualties around the area would be attained by other means as well. Soviet small unit attack methodologies may of not been as ignorant or casualty producing as originally thought.

Back to the operational level. On the part of the Germans, opinions were divided: von Bock believed that the battle was over, and after rest and replenishment, the troops of Army Group Center could continue their successful offensive against Moscow. However, Hitler was preoccupied with the stubborn defense of the Soviet Southwestern Front near Kiev and the increasing resistance of the Soviet troops of Zhukov and Timoshenko in the Moscow direction. On the other hand, Guderian&#x27;s victory at Roslavl, on the right flank of Army Group Center, opened up the possibility of an attack to the south and a gigantic encirclement of Soviet troops near Kiev. Gradually, OKH leaned towards Hitler&#x27;s opinion. However, neither Bock nor Hitler planned an immediate offensive directly on Moscow, and the need to constantly repel Soviet strikes exhausted the troops. Von Bock wrote: &quot;I was now forced to commit all of my combat-capable divisions from the army group’s reserve into combat…. We needed every man forward… In spite of huge losses… the enemy attacked daily in several sectors so that, up to this time, it has not been possible to regroup forces and bring up reserves.&quot;

Thus, in the next month after the elimination of the &quot;cauldron&quot; near Smolensk, von Bock&#x27;s armies defended themselves in the center and attacked with limited forces on the flanks. In the south, Guderian won the battles near Gomel and Krichev, and in the north, Group Stumme captured Velikiye Luki and advanced further to the east to Andreapol. Most of the attacks of the Soviet troops were successfully repelled, but the Germans had to be withdrawn from the salient near Yelnya.

==Casualties and losses==
Official Soviet data on losses in the Battle of Smolensk (10 July - 10 September 1941) were disclosed only in 1993. According to the study by a team of authors led by Grigori F. Krivosheev, the troops of the four &quot;fronts&quot; and the Soviet lost a total of:
* 486,171 people irrevocably (dead, missing and captured)
* 273,803 people wounded.
* In total: 759,947 people.

What part of the 486,171 irrecoverable losses relates to the killed and what part to the prisoners-of-war is not indicated. The Germans reported the following number of prisoners for some operations during this time:
* 350,000 after the final cleaning of the pocket near Smolensk (including battles at Rogachev and at Mogilev)
* 38,561 after the destruction of Group Kachalov near Roslavl
* 78,000 captured by the 2nd Army in the battles of Krichev and Gomel
* 16,000 captured by the XXIV Motorized Corps of the 2nd Panzer Group between Krichev and Gomel
* 34,000 captured by Group Stumme near Velikiye Luki
Thus, there are more than 500,000 reported prisoners in total.

The famous Western researcher of the war on the Eastern front, Nigel Askey, in his study of Soviet military losses in 1941-1945, based on an analysis of Soviet documents and archives, argues that official Soviet data on military losses in the First Battle of Smolensk is greatly underestimated. Actual casualties amount to 1,000,000 men, including 565,000 prisoners.

The losses of the German side, according to one of the documents from the Russian archives, amounted to only 101,000 men. Historian David Glantz draws attention to the fact that the number of killed for the 9th army in this document is obviously too low. In his opinion, this number should be 7 thousand higher. His own estimate of the personnel losses of Army Group Center for the period 10 July - 10 September, made on the base of known German documents, gives around 115,500 killed and wounded, compared with the 760,000 losses the Soviet fronts incurred during the same period.

==Aftermath==

During the battle, the German army captured the Archives of Smolensk Oblast Committee of Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a large amount of documents about local history from 1917 to 1941. The Germans used the document for propaganda about Soviet repression and transported them back to Germany.

In the immediate aftermath of the capture of Smolensk, German forces rounded up all Jewish inhabitants and confined them to local and regional ghettos, and later extermination, and the city would enter an unconditional and constant period of martial law until the Soviets liberated the city two years later.

The Battle of Smolensk was another severe defeat for the Red Army in the opening phase of Operation Barbarossa. For the first time, the Soviets tried to implement a coordinated counter-attack against a large part of the front; although this counter-attack turned into a military disaster, the stiffening resistance showed that the Soviets were not yet defeated and that the Blitzkrieg towards Moscow was not going to be an easy undertaking. Dissent within the German high command and political leadership was exacerbated. The leaders of the General Staff, Franz Halder and Brauchitsch and commanders like Bock, Hoth and Guderian counselled against dispersing the German armoured units and to concentrate on Moscow. Hitler reiterated the lack of importance of Moscow and of strategic encirclements and ordered a concentration on economic targets such as Ukraine, the Donets Basin and the Caucasus, with more tactical encirclements to weaken the Soviets further. The German offensive effort became more fragmented, leading to the Battle of Kiev and the Battle of Uman. The battles were German victories but costly in time, men and equipment on their approach towards Moscow, allowing the Soviets time to prepare the defenses of the city.

==Notes==

* David Glantz wrote that &quot;although the two [7th and 5th Soviet] mechanized corps fielded a total of over 1,500 tanks on paper, it is likely as many as two-thirds of their tanks broke down due to mechanical problems even before they reached the battlefield&quot;.
* In Soviet and post-Soviet military historiography, the term &quot;srazheniye&quot; traditionally describes the complex of battles, that take place on a wide front and consist of a number of separate battles and operations linked by the general plan. The term &quot;bitva&quot; (that also translates as a &quot;battle&quot;) refers to the most important events. In the historiography of the Great Patriotic War, the Battle of Moscow, the Battle of Stalingrad and the Battle of Kursk are known. A certain struggle is being waged for the recognition of the operations in the Rzhev area as a &quot;bitva&quot;.

<text>Thomas Martin Dumont (born January 11, 1968) is an American musician and producer. Dumont is a member of third wave ska band No Doubt, and during the band&#x27;s hiatus, he began Invincible Overlord as a side project and produced Matt Costa&#x27;s &quot;Songs We Sing&quot;.

==Life and career==
Born in Los Angeles, California, the Dumont family lived in Irvine, California. Tom was the only adopted child in his family and has two siblings. He has a sister named Gina and a brother named John. Dumont&#x27;s father, who played the piano, gave his son a guitar at age twelve. Dumont practiced by strumming folk songs by the likes of James Taylor. Dumont was influenced by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and KISS. He joined his older sister&#x27;s heavy metal band Rising, but left in 1988 for third wave ska band No Doubt. 

Dumont studied music theory for five semesters at Orange Coast College. He dropped out when he had to learn classical guitar, which was something he disliked. When the band moved into a house on Beacon Avenue in Anaheim, he wrote a poem about being addicted to television. He took the poem to Eric Stefani, who put the poem to music and came up with the song &quot;Trapped in a Box&quot;. The song was recorded for the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album and was the album&#x27;s only single.

The band later self-released &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; in March 1995. The same month, Dumont left his job as a file clerk at a mortgage company. He had &quot;a good feeling&quot; about having finished recording &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; and planned to fall back on promoting rock concerts if the album was not successful. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; became a commercial success, certified diamond in the United States and selling sixteen million copies worldwide. When Eric left the band, Tom, along with bandmates Gwen Stefani and Tony Kanal, took leadership in writing and composing responsibilities.

After the Tragic Kingdom tour, Tom returned to his home in Long Beach, California and started surfing in 1997. Dumont is a member of The Surfrider Foundation, an environmental organization to preserve coastal life. Since Eric Stefani left, Tom Dumont, Tony Kanal and Gwen Stefani became No Doubt&#x27;s primary songwriters.

During No Doubt&#x27;s hiatus, Dumont produced Matt Costa&#x27;s 2005 debut album, titled &quot;Songs We Sing&quot;, after hearing a demo tape by Costa.

==Reunion with No Doubt==

With Stefani promoting her second solo album, No Doubt began initial work on a new album without her and planned to complete it after Stefani&#x27;s tour was finished. In March 2008, the band started making posts concerning the progression of the album on their official fan forum. Stefani made a post on March 28, 2008, stating that songwriting had commenced but was slow on her end because she was, at the time, pregnant with her second child.

Manager Jim Guerinot said the yet-untitled album is being produced by Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent, who helped produce and mix &quot;Rock Steady&quot;. Between Stefani&#x27;s pregnancy and recording, No Doubt did not tour in 2008, but Guerinot promised, they plan to hit the road hard in 2009 for their first full-fledged band tour in nearly five years.

No Doubt announced on their official website that they will tour in the summer of 2009 with Paramore, The Sounds, Janelle Monáe, Bedouin Soundclash, Katy Perry, and Panic! at the Disco. while finishing their upcoming album, which was set to be released in 2010 but has been delayed. Tickets for the tour went on sale March 7, 2009. As a special promotion for the tour, the band is giving away their entire music catalog free as a digital download with purchase of top-tier seating.

In 2009, No Doubt made an appearance on the television series &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, playing a fictional band called &quot;Snowed Out&quot; in the episode &quot;Valley Girls&quot;. They performed their cover version of the Adam and the Ants song &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;.

==Personal life==
Dumont and his wife Mieke have three sons together: Ace Joseph Dumont, born April 6, 2006, Rio Atticus Dumont, born June 18, 2008, and Koa Thomas Dumont, born February 19, 2011. According to the band&#x27;s record label representative, the couple was married in October 2004.

According to his No Doubt bandmates, when Dumont drinks alcohol, he shifts into his alter ego nicknamed &quot;The Douche&quot;.

Dumont is an avid traveler, spending a good part of his free time on the road. He has been spotted in remote areas of the world with his wife and kids.

<text>Fyodor Isidorovich Kuznetsov (; 29 September 1898 – 22 March 1961) was a Colonel General and military commander in the Soviet Union.

==Biography==
Born to a peasant family in Mogilev Governorate (present-day Horki Raion, Mogilev Oblast of Belarus), Kuznetsov served in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and continued his service in the Bolsheviks&#x27; Red Army. During the German-Soviet War, he initially commanded the Northwestern Front during the Baltic Strategic Defensive Operation until 30 June 1941, but was relieved in early August 1941 (replaced by General Major Pyotr Sobennikov). At a Stavka session on 12 August 1941, he was given command of the new 51st Independent Army, but he was replaced by Pavel Batov in October 1941 during the defense of the Crimea. Later he served as the temporary commander of the Central Front (July–August 1941), Chief of Staff of the 28th Army, Deputy Commander of the Western Front, and commander of the 61st Army.

From March 1942 to June 1943, he served as the commanding officer of the Academy of General Staff, and from August 1943 to February 1944 as the Deputy Commander of the Volkhov Front and Karelian Front. From 1945-1948, he commanded the Ural Military District, retiring due to illness.

He is buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

<text>Uthamar Kovil (also known as Thirukkarambanoor or Bhikshandar Kovil) in Uthamarkoil, a village in the outskirts of Tiruchirappalli in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, is dedicated to the Hindu Trimurti of Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the &quot;Nalayira Divya Prabandham&quot;, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th–9th centuries CE. It is one of the 108 &quot;Divya Desams&quot; dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Purushothaman Perumal (also called as Purushothamar) and his consort Lakshmi as Poornavalli Thayar.

Purushottamar is believed to have appeared to Hindu gods Brahma and Shiva, to relieve Shiva off his sins committed while cutting one of Brahma&#x27;s heads. The temple is one of the few historical temples in India where the images of the Trimurti, Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma are housed in the same premises. It is one of the two temples in Chola Nadu where the trinity can be seen in the same premises, the other being Hara Saabha Vimocchana Perumal Temple at Thirukkandiyur.

The temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas of the late 8th century CE, with later contributions from Vijayanagara kings and Madurai Nayaks. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines, while the temple tank is located outside the main gateway.

Six daily rituals and four yearly festivals are held at the temple for each of trinities. The major festival of the temple, the &quot;Brahmotsavam&quot;, is celebrated during the Tamil month of Kartikai (November – December) when festival images of both Purushotamar and Bikshadanar are carried together in the streets surrounding the temple. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

==Etymology and legend==

As per Hindu legend, the god Vishnu emerged as a Kadamba tree here, giving the name &quot;Kathambanur&quot;, which later became &quot;Karambanur&quot;. The name &quot;Karambanur&quot; is mentioned by Thirumangai Alvar in &quot;Nalayira Divya Prabandam&quot;, in which he refers to the presiding deity as &quot;Karambanur Uthaman&quot;. The temple is commonly called &quot;Uthamar Kovil&quot; derived from the presiding deity. The temple is also called Bhikshandar Kovil as the god Shiva is present in the form of Bhikshandar (a mendicant) and believed to have attained cure by worshiping Vishnu at this place.

As per Hindu legend, once Vishnu wanted to test the devotion of the god Brahma. He raised as a Kadamba tree in the place; Brahma worshipped him with &quot;thirumanjanam&quot; (ablution). The water from the ablution filled a tank nearby, which came to be known as &quot;Kathamba Theertham&quot;. Vishnu was satisfied with the devotion of Brahma and gave a boon to Brahma to have a shrine in this place. Shiva wanted to expiate the sin for decapitating a head of Brahma and went on a pilgrimage. Here, Vishnu requested his consort Lakshmi to give alms to Shiva. Shiva&#x27;s grail was filled by the alms and Lakshmi came to be known as Poornavalli Thayar (the one who filled the grail).

As per another legend, Brahma and Shiva both had originally five heads. Parvati, the wife of Shiva, once got confused and worshipped Brahma, instead of her husband. Shiva got enraged and cut off one of Brahma&#x27;s heads; the head stuck in Shiva&#x27;s hand due to Brahma&#x27;s curse. To atone for the sin, Shiva worshipped Vishnu here; Shiva was fully relieved of the curse after worshipping Vishnu at Hara Saabha Vimocchana Perumal Temple.

According to another Hindu legend, the temple is believed to have been constructed by Janaka, the king of Janakapuri and the father of the goddess Sita. Thirumangai Alvar is believed to have resided in the temple to build the surrounding walls of the Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple. 

==Temple==

The temple is believed to have been built by the Medieval Cholas of the late 8th century CE, with later contributions from Vijayanagara kings and Madurai Nayaks. During the war between British and French in 1751, the temple acted as an infantry for both the troops. There was no damage done to the temple during the war.

A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temples has images and separate shrines for Purushottamar (Vishnu), Bhikshadanar (Shiva), Brahma and their respective consorts Poornavalli (Lakshmi), Soundarya Parvati and Saraswati. This is one of the few historical Hindu temples in the world, where the Hindu Trimurti are worshipped along with their consorts in six separate shrines within the same temple complex. The central shrine facing East houses the image of Vishnu, as Purushottamar, in reclining posture, similar to the idol of Ranganatha at the nearby temple in Srirangam with the discus in one hand and the procession idols of Vishnu, Lakshmi and Bhumi (Earth goddess). The roof or &quot;vimana&quot; of the central shrine is called Udhyoga Vimana. There are two shrines located to the south east, each housing the image of Poornavalli and Mahalakshmi. The Shiva shrine, located behind Vishnu&#x27;s, houses the &quot;lingam&quot; (aniconic form of Shiva) as Bhikshadanar. The granite images of the deities Ganesha (son of Shiva and god of wisdom), Murugan (son of Shiva and god of war), Nandi (the bull and vehicle of Shiva) and Navagraha (nine planetary deities) are located in the hall leading to the Shiva sanctum. As in other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the first precinct of the Shiva shrine has images of Dakshinamurthy (Shiva as the Teacher), Durga (warrior-goddess) and Chandikeswarar (a saint and devotee of Shiva). The shrines of Brahma and his consort Saraswati are located in the south west corner of the temple complex.

The &quot;Saptaguru&quot; or seven gurus (teachers) are identified in the temple. The seven are Bhikshadanar (representing Sadasiva Guru, Shiva as a guru), Brahma (Brahma Guru), Soundarya Parvati (Shakti Guru, the Goddess as a guru), Brihaspati (Deva Guru, the teacher of the gods), Varadarajaperumal (Vishnu Guru), Murugan (Gnana Guru, the guru of knowledge) and Shukra (Asura Guru, the guru of demons).

==Festival and administration==
The temple priests perform the &quot;puja&quot; (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The priests of the Bhikshadanar shrine belong to the Shaiva community, while the priests of Purushothamar are from Vaishnava community. The temple rituals are performed six times a day; Ushathkalam at 5:30 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 8:30 p.m. The Shaiva and Vaishnava sects have their own rituals. The ritual of Bhikshadanar comprises four steps: &quot;abhisheka&quot; (sacred bath), &quot;alangaram&quot; (decoration), &quot;naivethanam&quot; (food offering) and &quot;deepa aradanai&quot; (waving of lamps) for both Bhikshadanar and Soundarya Parvati. The worship is held amidst religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred texts) read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like &#x27; (Monday) and &#x27; (Friday), fortnightly rituals like &quot;pradosham&quot; and monthly festivals like &quot;amavasai&quot; (new moon day), &quot;kiruthigai&quot;, &quot;pournami&quot; (full moon day) and &quot;sathurthi&quot; for Bhikshadanar. The major festival of the temple, the &quot;Brahmotsavam&quot;, is celebrated during the Tamil month of Kartigai (November – December) when festival images of both Purushothamar and Bhikshadanar are carried together in the streets surrounding the temple. Kadambha Tiruvila is a festival celebrated in the temple when the festival image of Ranganatha (a form of Vishnu) is brought to the Kadambha tank of the temple for &quot;Theerthavari&quot;. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.

==Religious significance==

Uthamar Kovil is one of the two temples in Chola Nadu where the trinity can be seen in the same premises, the other being Hara Saabha Vimocchana Perumal Temple at Thirukkandiyur. Trimurti in Hindu mythology refers to the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction. They are personified by the forms of Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.

The temple is revered in &quot;Nalayira Divya Prabandham&quot;, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Alvar in ten hymns. The temple is classified as a &quot;Divya Desam&quot;, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Thirumangai Alvar have sung in praise of the perumal in this temple with one pasuram (hymn).

Periyavachan Pillai, who translated the verses of Thirumangai Alvar, glorifies the temple as &quot;the one without doors where devotees can always visit and worship&quot;.

<text>Reference.com is an online encyclopedia that organizes content that uses a question-and-answer format. Articles are organized into hierarchical categories.

Before IAC restructured the site following an acquisition in 2008, Reference.com comprised multiple reference works, and disclosed its sources.

==History==
Reference.com was launched by InReference, Inc in February 1997. The site was later acquired by Lexico Publishing Group, LLC. In 2005, Lexico announced that Reference.com would begin offering searches of Wikipedia content.

The popularity of Dictionary.com had been greatly boosted by Google&#x27;s practice of offering a link at the top of their search results that goes to the Dictionary.com definition. This exclusive relationship was terminated without explanation to the public when the Google links were redirected to definitions at Answers.com. (In December 2009, the Answers.com links were replaced with Google&#x27;s own dictionary.) Google added a Dictionary.com definition link for certain search words in a non-exclusive relationship (along with links to definitions from a few other commercial reference websites). On 3 July 2008, IAC acquired Lexico Publishing Group, LLC and its three properties: Thesaurus.com, Reference.com, and Dictionary.com.

==Sources==
Reference.com reproduced content from external sources. The site&#x27;s sources included other online dictionaries, encyclopedias, and a search of terms found on other websites such as Wikipedia and the CIA &quot;World Factbook&quot;. The site could also search Usenet groups and other mailing lists.

The encyclopedia had articles from such sources as the 2004 &quot;Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia&quot;, the &quot;Crystal Reference Encyclopedia&quot;, and later the English Wikipedia. Its online dictionary indexed the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Easton&#x27;s 1897 Bible Dictionary&quot;, the Jargon File, the &quot;Kernerman English Multilingual Dictionary&quot;, Acronym Finder, &quot;Stedman&#x27;s Medical Dictionary&quot;, &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Medical Dictionary&quot;, the &quot;On-line Medical Dictionary&quot;, and &quot;WordNet&quot;. Its thesaurus was based on multiple versions of &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot;. The site&#x27;s web directory was an interface to the Open Directory Project, and its web search feature used Google Search. An interface to Google Translate was added in 2008.

==User tracking==
Reference.com in 2010 topped the list compiled by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; ranking websites by how many third-party tracking cookies were added to the user&#x27;s computer. Reference.com added 234 tracking cookies when encountering a first-time user.

<doc id="1298416" wikidata="Q2756249" url="?curid=1298416" title="No One Is Innocent (song)">
<text>&quot;No One Is Innocent&quot; was the fifth single by the British punk rock band the Sex Pistols. It was released on 30 June 1978. The Pistols had split up early in 1978, losing bassist Sid Vicious and original lead vocalist Johnny Rotten. &quot;No One Is Innocent&quot; was recorded by remaining members Paul Cook and Steve Jones, with vocals performed by Ronnie Biggs, a British criminal notorious for his part in the Great Train Robbery of 1963. At the time of &quot;No One Is Innocent&quot; Biggs was living in Brazil, still wanted by the British authorities, but immune from extradition. The song was credited to Jones and Biggs.

== Lyrical content==
The lyrics refer to &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, by beginning each verse &quot;God save...&quot;, followed by many, often unsavoury, characters, starting with the Sex Pistols themselves. There are references to Bill Grundy, the television host who had caused controversy two years earlier when Steve Jones swore on his live show, egged on by Grundy, as well as Martin Bormann and &quot;Nazis on the run&quot;. Notorious child murderers Myra Hindley and Ian Brady are mentioned (with Hindley&#x27;s surname mispronounced &quot;Hind-ley&quot;), along with politicians and the police (referred to as &quot;pigs&quot;), Idi Amin, and finally Biggs himself. The chorus goes, &quot;Ronnie Biggs was doing time, until he done a bunk, now he says he&#x27;s seen the light, and he&#x27;s sold his soul for punk.&quot; (In UK slang, to &quot;bunk&quot;, or &quot;do a bunk&quot;, is to leave without permission; most frequently used to indicate skipping school or work, here it refers to Biggs&#x27; escape from the HM Prison Wandsworth and the UK.)

The final lines of the last verse are &quot;God save the Good Samaritan and God save the worthless creep&quot;. Associating all the characters together, both good and bad (including themselves) while claiming that &quot;no one is innocent&quot; is exemplary of the nihilistic attitude of the Sex Pistols.

In an interview in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; around the time the record was released drummer Paul Cook said that &#x27;god should save everyone, even evil people&#x27;.

Bormann, prankishly pictured as the band&#x27;s uniformed bass player on the 12&quot; pressing, is also mentioned in Biggs&#x27;s recording of the earlier Pistols song &quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot;, another song which makes light of The Holocaust (&quot;No One Is Innocent&quot;, while calling Brady &quot;horrible&quot;, dismisses the Nazis as &quot;they wasn&#x27;t being wicked/it was their idea of fun&quot;). Fleeing prosecution for war crimes following World War II, Bormann was for years thought to have escaped, like Biggs, to Brazil.

The title of the song was originally supposed to be &quot;Cosh the Driver&quot;, a reference to the near-fatal beating that the train driver had suffered in Biggs&#x27;s robbery years before. Virgin Records vetoed the idea, and the song eventually appeared as &quot;No One Is Innocent (A Punk Prayer by Ronnie Biggs)&quot;. On the 12&quot; pressing, the title became &quot;The Biggest Blow&quot;, but subsequent releases on albums reverted to the original title.

The song reached number seven on the UK singles chart, and appears on the albums &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; and &quot;Flogging a Dead Horse&quot;. The B-side of both the 7&quot; and 12&quot; pressings was Sid Vicious&#x27;s infamous rendering of Claude François, Jacques Revaux and Paul Anka&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot;.

== Recording sessions==

===&quot;No One Is Innocent&quot;===
The song was recorded at an unknown 16-track studio in Rio de Janeiro during Jones&#x27; and Cook&#x27;s stay from mid-January to late February 1978. Lyrics and vocals were provided by Ronald Biggs: &quot;The record was made in a church studio in Rio with the priest present, who seemed very happy. We were rather drunk by the time we came to make the recording, which explains why it may have appeared a little out of tune. We also recorded &#x27;Belsen Was a Gas&#x27;, which I must say I wasn&#x27;t too happy about, and I was relieved that it didn&#x27;t appear on the other side of &#x27;No One Is Innocent&#x27;, I did find these words a little disgusting.&quot;

The second song recorded, &quot;Belsen Was a Gas&quot;, turned up on the movie soundtrack album of &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; in 1979. Overdubs to both songs were recorded at Wessex Studios in London with engineer Bill Price.

===&quot;My Way&quot;===
The backing track of the song was recorded at Studio de la Grande Armée in Paris on 10 April 1978 with engineer Emmanuel Guyot. French session musicians were used – Claude Engel on guitar, with the rhythm section from the disco band Voyage (Sauveur Mallia on bass guitar and Pierre-Alain Dahan on drums). The vocals were recorded on the same day, the final single version consisting of three different vocal takes.

Overdubs were recorded back at Wessex Studios in London with engineer Bill Price. Steve Jones added guitars and Simon Jeffes arranged an orchestral intro to the song.

The original backing track coupled with one of the three vocal takes was released on the album &quot;Sid Sings&quot;.

Producer Dave Goodman stated he created an unreleased mix of the song at Berwick Street Studios in London in June 1978, but the studio bill was not paid in time so his mix was delivered to the record company too late to be used on the single.

==Charts==

<text>Julius Schreck (13 July 1898 – 16 May 1936) was an early senior Nazi official and close confidant of Adolf Hitler. Born in Munich, Schreck served in World War I and shortly afterwards joined right-wing paramilitary units. He joined the Nazi Party in 1920 and was a founding member of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (&quot;Storm Detachment&quot;; SA). Later in 1925, he became the first leader of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (&quot;Protection Squadron&quot;; SS). He then served for a time as a chauffeur for Hitler. Schreck developed meningitis in 1936 and died on 16 May of that year. Hitler gave him a state funeral.

==Early life==
Julius Schreck was born on 13 July 1898 in Munich in Bavaria. He served in the German Army during World War I. After the war ended, Schreck became an early member of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (Nazi Party; NSDAP), having joined in 1920 and documented as member No. 53. Schreck developed a friendship with the party&#x27;s leader Adolf Hitler during its early years.

==Career in the SA==
Schreck was a founding member of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (&quot;Storm Detachment&quot;; SA), being involved in its growth and development. This was a paramilitary wing of the party designed to disrupt political opponents and provide muscle for security tasks. Hitler, in early 1923, ordered the formation of a small separate bodyguard dedicated to his service and protection rather than an uncontrolled mass of the party, such as the SA. Originally the unit was composed of only eight men, commanded by Schreck and Joseph Berchtold. It was designated the &quot;Stabswache&quot; (&quot;Staff Guard&quot;). The &quot;Stabswache&quot; were issued unique badges, but at this point the &quot;Stabswache&quot; was still under overall control of the SA, whose membership continued to increase. Schreck resurrected the use of the &quot;Totenkopf&quot; (&quot;death&#x27;s head&quot;) as the unit&#x27;s insignia, a symbol various elite forces had used in the past, including specialized assault troops of Imperial Germany in World War I who used &quot;Hutier&quot; infiltration tactics.

In May 1923, the unit was renamed &quot;Stoßtrupp-Hitler&quot; (&quot;Shock Troop-Hitler&quot;). The unit was solely responsible for Hitler&#x27;s personal protection. On 9 November 1923 the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, along with the SA and several other paramilitary units, took part in the Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. The plan was to seize control of the city in a coup d&#x27;état and then challenge the government in Berlin. The putsch was quickly crushed by the local police. In the aftermath of the failed putsch both Hitler, Schreck, and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated for treason at Landsberg Prison. The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, were officially disbanded.

==Career in the SS==
After Hitler&#x27;s release from prison on 20 December 1924, the Nazi Party was officially refounded. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organise the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; (&quot;Protection Command&quot;). Hitler wanted a small group of tough ex-soldiers such as Schreck, who would be loyal to him. The unit included old &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot; members such as Emil Maurice and Erhard Heiden. The unit made its first public appearance in April 1925. That same year, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; was expanded to a national level. It was also successively renamed the &quot;Sturmstaffel&quot; (&quot;Storm Squadron&quot;) and then finally the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (&quot;Protection Squadron&quot;; SS) on 9 November 1925. Schreck became SS member #5. He was asked by Hitler to command the bodyguard company. Schreck never referred to himself as &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;, but the title was retroactively applied to him in later years.

In 1926, Schreck stood down as commander of the SS and Berchtold took over the leadership. Berchtold changed the title of the office position, which became known as the &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot;. Schreck remained on the SS rolls as an SS-&quot;Führer&quot; and worked as Hitler&#x27;s private chauffeur after Maurice until 1934. In 1930, after the SS had begun to expand under Heinrich Himmler, Schreck was appointed an SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;, but had little actual power. He continued to serve at Hitler&#x27;s side and they were on very good terms.

==Death==
Schreck continued as Hitler&#x27;s personal driver until 1936. That spring Schreck developed meningitis and died on 16 May in Munich. He was a well-liked man and Hitler was distraught when Schreck died. His final rank was SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot;, a rank equivalent to that of a &quot;Generalmajor&quot; in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Schreck was accorded a Nazi state funeral. Himmler referred to him as &quot;Adolf Hitler&#x27;s first SS man&quot;.

<text>A vast network of interconnected freeways in the megaregion of Southern California serves a population of over 23 million people. The Master Plan of Metropolitan Los Angeles Freeways was adopted by the Regional Planning Commission in 1947 and construction began in the early 1950s. The plan hit opposition and funding limitations in the 1970s, and by 2004, only some 61% of the original planned network had been completed.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Southern California&#x27;s romance with the automobile owes in large part to resentment of the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s tight control over the region&#x27;s commerce in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During his successful campaign for governor in 1910, anti-Southern Pacific candidate Hiram Johnson traveled the state by car, which was no small feat at that time. In the minds of Southlanders, this associated the automobile with clean, progressive government, in stark contrast to the railroads&#x27; control over the corrupt governments of the Midwest and Northeast. While the Southern Pacific-owned Pacific Electric Railway&#x27;s famous Red Car streetcar lines were the axis of urbanization in Los Angeles during its period of spectacular growth in the 1910s and 1920s, they were unprofitable and increasingly unattractive compared to automobiles. As cars became cheaper and began to fill the region&#x27;s roads in the 1920s, Pacific Electric lost ridership. Traffic congestion soon threatened to choke off the region&#x27;s development altogether. At the same time, a number of influential urban planners were advocating the construction of a network of what one widely read book dubbed &quot;Magic Motorways&quot;, as the backbone of suburban development. These &quot;greenbelt&quot; advocates called for decentralized, automobile-oriented development as a means of remedying both urban overcrowding and declining rates of home ownership.

Traffic congestion was of such great concern by the late 1930s in the Los Angeles metropolitan area that the influential Automobile Club of Southern California engineered an elaborate plan to create an elevated freeway-type &quot;Motorway System,&quot; a key aspect of which was the dismantling of the streetcar lines, to be replaced with buses that could run on both local streets and on the new express roads. In the late 1930s, when the freeway system was originally planned locally by Los Angeles city planners, they had intended for light rail tracks to have been installed in the center margin of each freeway (which would presumably have carried Pacific Electric Railway red cars), but this plan was never fully implemented.

=== Planning and construction ===
During World War II, transportation bottlenecks on Southern California roads and railways convinced many that if Southern California was to accommodate a large population, it needed a completely new transportation system. The city of Los Angeles favored an upgraded rail transit system focused on its central city. However, the success of the Arroyo Seco Parkway, built between Los Angeles and Pasadena in 1940, convinced many that a freeway system could solve the region&#x27;s transportation problems. Leaders of surrounding cities, such as Whittier, South Gate, Long Beach, and Pasadena, accordingly called for a web of freeways to connect the whole region, rather than funneling their residents out of their own downtowns and into that of Los Angeles. Pro-freeway sentiments prevailed, and by 1947, a new comprehensive freeway plan for Los Angeles (based largely on the original locally planned 1930s system, but without the light rail tracks in the median strips of the freeways) had been drawn up by the California Department of Public Works (now Caltrans). San Diego soon followed suit, and by the early 1950s, construction had begun on much of the region&#x27;s freeway system.

==Proposed/future freeways==
Caltrans or local transportation agencies have identified the following priority freeway projects:
*A toll road that will go through a tunnel in the Santa Ana Mountains from Irvine to Corona.
*Upgrading State Route 210 to Interstate standards and renumbering the route Interstate 210.
*A new freeway, the Mid County Parkway, from Interstate 215 in Perris to State Route 79 in San Jacinto.
*An extension for Interstate 710, the Long Beach Freeway, to its originally planned terminus at Interstate 210, the Foothill Freeway, in Pasadena, via a tunnel underneath the city of South Pasadena or some other means. Caltrans, however, cancelled the project in November 2018.
*An extension to the State Route 241 toll road to meet Interstate 5 in or near San Clemente.
*Upgrading State Route 71, the Chino Valley Freeway, to a full controlled-access freeway north of State Route 60, the Pomona Freeway, to Interstate 10, the San Bernardino Freeway, in Pomona.
*Upgrading State Route 55, the Costa Mesa Freeway, from south of its current freeway terminus at 19th Street in Costa Mesa to State Route 1, Pacific Coast Highway, in Newport Beach, potentially via a tunnel.
*Construction of the High Desert Corridor, a freeway and expressway between State Route 14, the Antelope Valley Freeway, in Palmdale and Interstate 15, the Mojave Freeway, near Victorville. It would also carry a high-speed rail line to Las Vegas, Nevada. Caltrans put the freeway on hold in 2019.
*State Route 48 is a completely unconstructed 25.5-mile (41.03 km) freeway to connect at the current SR 14/138 junction and West Avenue E, go east running parallel with East Avenue E and East Avenue G, and terminate in Hi Vista at East Avenue G/200th Street East, at the planned SR 122 freeway.
*State Route 122 is a completely unconstructed 61.3-mile (98.7 km) freeway, defined to run from SR 14 south of Palmdale, and proceed northeast through Hi Vista, and terminate at the current U.S. 395/SR 58 at Kramer Junction.
*State Route 249 is a 13.5-mile (21.7 km) unconstructed route that would connect SR 2 north of La Cañada Flintridge with SR 14 south of Palmdale. Angeles Forest Highway (CR N3) follows the general alignment, but Caltrans has no plans to take it over. However, there are plans to explore the building of this route between Palmdale and Los Angeles by tunneling through the mountains.
*A toll road that would run from SR 126 to SR 118 in Simi Valley through the Santa Susana Mountains (proposed in August 1990). The only north–south highways that connect SR 126 with SR 118 are I-5 and SR 23. Motorists on SR 126 can use this route to reach Simi Valley without having to use Interstate 5 via Newhall Pass to SR 118 or SR 23 to Moorpark and vice versa. A good traversable route would be Tapo Canyon Road, Windmill Canyon Road, and Pico Canyon Road, but Caltrans has no plans to take it over.

== Naming ==

=== Freeway names ===
Southern California residents idiomatically refer to freeways with the definite article, as &quot;the [freeway number]&quot;, e.g. &quot;the 5&quot; or &quot;the 10&quot;. This use of the article differs from other American dialects, including that of Northern California, but is the same as in the UK (e.g. &quot;Take the M1 to the M25&quot;) and other European countries (e.g. &quot;die A1&quot; in German). In addition, sections of the southern California freeway system are often referred to by names rather than by the official numbers. For example, the names Santa Monica and San Bernardino are used for segments of the Interstate 10 even though overhead freeway signs installed at interchanges since the 1990s don&#x27;t display these names, using instead the highway number, direction, and control city. A freeway &quot;name&quot; may refer to portions of two or more differently numbered routes; for example, the Ventura Freeway consists of portions of U.S. Route 101 and State Route 134, and the San Diego Freeway consists of portions of Interstate 5 and the full length of Interstate 405.

When Southern California freeways were built in the 1940s and early 1950s, local common usage was primarily the freeway name preceded by the definite article. It took several decades for Southern California locals to start to also commonly refer to the freeways with the numerical designations, but the usage of the definite article persisted. For example, the San Gabriel River Freeway evolved into &quot;the 605 Freeway&quot; and then shortened to &quot;the 605&quot;.

=== Named interchanges ===
* Four Level (Bill Keene Memorial): 
* Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Memorial: 
* East Los Angeles: 
* Hollywood Split (Bruce T. Hinman Memorial): 
* Judge Harry Pregerson: 
* El Toro Y: Southern junction of 
* Kellogg: 
* Orange Crush: 
* Newhall Pass (Clarence Wayne Dean Memorial): 
* Glendora Curve: 
* Jack Schrade (Mission Valley Viaduct): 
* David M. Gonzales Memorial: 
* Marilyn Jorgenson Reece Memorial: 
* Sadao S. Munemori Memorial: 

=== Other named features ===
* Downtown Slot: where Highway 101 passes through a trench in downtown Los Angeles.
* South Bay Curve: where Interstate 405 bends from north–south to east–west in Torrance
* Sepulveda Pass: Interstate 405 just south of U.S. Route 101 near the J. Paul Getty Museum.
* Cahuenga Pass: the Hollywood Freeway just south of the interchange with the Ventura Freeway
* Figueroa Street Tunnels: the northbound lanes of the Pasadena Freeway between the Four Level Interchange and the interchange with the Golden State Freeway
* Glendora Curve: the transition of the northbound 57 Orange Freeway to the westbound 210 Foothill Freeway; or the eastbound 210 transition to the southbound 57. Formerly part of Interstate 210 before the completion of the newer section of the Foothill Freeway in 2003.

== Comparisons and firsts ==
* First freeway in California (Arroyo Seco Parkway linking Pasadena and Los Angeles)
* First stack interchange (Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles)
* First grade-separated HOV lanes
* First fully automated tollway system (91 Express Lanes in northern Orange County)

The Southern California area has fewer lane-miles per capita than most large metropolitan areas in the United States, ranking 31st of the top 39. As of 1999, Greater Los Angeles had 0.419 lane-miles per 1,000 people, only slightly more than Greater New York City and fewer than Greater Boston, the Washington Metropolitan Area and the San Francisco Bay Area. (American metros average .613 lane-miles per thousand.) San Diego ranked 17th in the same study, with 0.659 lane-miles per thousand, and the Inland Empire ranked 21st, with 0.626.

<text>Capital Baptist Theological Seminary was a Christian school with campuses in Seoul and Anseong City, Gyeonggi province, South Korea. In 2006 it was closed and its campus was used as Korea Baptist Theological University and Seminary&#x27;s secondary campus as part of Korea Baptist Convention&#x27;s decision to run only one educational institution.

==Academic departments==
The undergraduate offerings of the seminary consist of the Department of Theology and the Pastoral Theology institute, both of which offer four-year Bachelor of Theology degrees. The graduate school offers Master&#x27;s of Divinity and Doctor of Ministry degrees.

In addition, the school offers separate courses of study for women. Two-year certificate programs are offered by the Women&#x27;s College and Women&#x27;s Institute, and a three-year Master&#x27;s of Partnership Ministry is offered by the Pastor&#x27;s Wives Institute.

==History==
The school began as Seoul Baptist Theological Seminary, directly operated by the Korea Baptist Convention, in 1976. In 1980, the Convention chose to separate it from other institutions such as Korea Baptist Theological University and make it an independent institution, which was completed in early 1981. At this time the school was merged with two pre-existing institutions, Grace Seminary and Kyunggi Seminary, and the name was changed to the current one. The school was recognized as a theological seminary by the Ministry of Education in 1982.

==Sister schools==
The school maintains international sisterhood ties with Israel&#x27;s Jerusalem University College.

<text>Daegu Catholic University (DCU; previously named Catholic University of Daegu) is a private research university in Daegu, South Korea. DCU is known for its academic strength, especially in the field of medical, pharmacy, health science, psychology, social science, and education.

==History==

The St. Justin Seminary, from which the university claims descent, opened in Daegu on November 1, 1914, having been founded in May of that year. The first four rectors of the school were French missionaries, the first being a Fr. Chargeboeuf, also known by his Korean name Song Duck-mang (). The first Korean rector, Fr. Choi Min-sun (), who took up the post in 1945, was also the last rector of the seminary which closed the same year, sending most of its students home in May but remaining open until December to allow the final class of 4 to graduate.

In 1952, the Hyosung Women&#x27;s Junior College () was established, offering instruction to 150 students in the fields of music, literature, and home economics. The following year, it became a four-year college, also offering instruction in pharmacology. The college continued to expand steadily in the following years, establishing its graduate school in 1972 and gaining university status in 1980.

<text>The Grampians are a set of prominent hills forming the southeast backdrop of Nelson, New Zealand, reaching high.

Frequented by locals and tourists alike, the Grampians are covered in a myriad of tracks ranging from leisurely strolls to relatively taxing steep inclines.

Entry points to this recreational area are from 
* The top of Collingwood Street
* The corner of Van Diemen and Trafalgar streets
* Market Road, Bishopdale

A television and FM radio transmitter sits atop the hills. The transmitter was commissioned in 1971 by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation to broadcast NZBC TV (now TVNZ 1), offering improved coverage to Nelson and Tasman compared to the existing private translators relaying the NZBC TV signal from the Mount Kaukau transmitter in Wellington.

Several community and volunteer groups are working towards restoring habitats for native birds on the Grampians by reducing the impact of predators, using pest control methods in conjunction with the Brook Waimarama Sanctuary.

==Areas of interest==
The main track zigzags up to the ridge of the hills, providing access to good views over most of Nelson. A lookout near the top offers views over much of the Nelson region.

==Demographics==
Grampians statistical area, which covers , had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. 
Grampians had a population of 2,412 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 177 people (7.9%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 471 people (24.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 885 households, comprising 1,218 males and 1,194 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.02 males per female. The median age was 38.2 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 474 people (19.7%) aged under 15 years, 453 (18.8%) aged 15 to 29, 1,185 (49.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 297 (12.3%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 78.2% European/Pākehā, 15.8% Māori, 3.7% Pasifika, 11.8% Asian, and 2.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 24.1, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 56.5% had no religion, 30.8% were Christian, 1.6% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 1.5% were Buddhist and 2.1% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 375 (19.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 417 (21.5%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $26,300, compared with $31,800 nationally. 198 people (10.2%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 927 (47.8%) people were employed full-time, 300 (15.5%) were part-time, and 93 (4.8%) were unemployed.

<text>A mechanical pencil or clutch pencil is a pencil with a replaceable and mechanically extendable solid pigment core called a &quot;lead&quot; . The lead, often made of graphite, is not bonded to the outer casing, and the user can mechanically extend it as its point is worn away from use. The vast majority of mechanical pencils have erasers.

Other names include: microtip pencil, automatic pencil, drafting pencil, technical pencil, draughting pencil, click pencil (generally refers to a specific brand), pump pencil, leadholder, Pacer (Australian English, ca. the 1980s), propelling pencil (British and Australian English, often refers to higher-end mechanical pencils), pen pencil (Indian English), and lead pencil (Bangladeshi and American English).

Mechanical pencils are used to provide lines of constant width, without need of sharpening, for tasks such as technical drawing as well as for clean looking writing. They are also used for fine-art drawing. Since they do not have to be sharpened, they are also popular with students. Mechanical pencils were first used in the 18th century, with many designs patented in the 19th and 20th centuries.

==History==

Conrad Gessner described a lead holder pencil in 1565, but the lead had to be manually adjusted to sharpen it. The earliest extant datable example of a mechanical pencil was found aboard the wreckage of HMS &quot;Pandora&quot;, which sank in 1791.

The first patent for a refillable pencil with lead-propelling mechanism was issued to Sampson Mordan and John Isaac Hawkins in Britain in 1822. After buying out Hawkins&#x27; patent rights, Mordan entered into a business partnership with Gabriel Riddle from 1823 to 1837. The earliest Mordan pencils are thus hallmarked SMGR. After 1837, Mordan ended his partnership with Riddle and continued to manufacture pencils as &quot;S. Mordan &amp; Co&quot;. His company continued to manufacture pencils and a wide range of silver objects until World War II, when the factory was bombed.

Between 1822 and 1874, more than 160 patents were registered pertaining to a variety of improvements to mechanical pencils. The first spring-loaded mechanical pencil was patented in 1877. Two of the most popular 19th-century lead sizes were 1.5 and 1.03 mm, &quot;VS&quot; and &quot;M&quot;, respectively. Many other sizes were in use, however, before the Eversharp&#x27;s success made its .046 inch lead size a de facto standard (this size has been variously metricized as 1.1, 1.18, and 1.2 mm, all nominal sizes). Thinner .036 inch (0.9 mm) lead was introduced in the later 1930s and gradually became the new standard, eventually being displaced by 0.7 mm. Many thinner sizes are now available, as well as thicker leads such as 1.4 and 2.0 mm.

The first modern mechanical pencil was the Eversharp (originally &quot;Ever Sharp&quot;), invented by Charles R. Keeran who applied for the key patent in 1913. It has been described as &quot;the first mass-produced mechanical pencil to combine a simple propelling mechanism with large lead capacity and robust, ergonomically sound design . . . that redefined the mechanical pencil as a mass-market product, to the extent that &quot;eversharp&quot; came to be widely used as a generic term for a mechanical pencil.&quot; More that 12,000,000 Eversharp pencils had been sold by the early 1920s, and its design was widely copied. 

A pioneering mechanical pencil in Japan was invented in 1915 by Tokuji Hayakawa, a metalworker who had just finished his apprenticeship. It was patented in Japan in 1920 and marketed as the &quot;Ever-Ready Sharp Pencil&quot;. Although it has been claimed that large numbers were sold, surviving Ever-Ready Sharps are rare. In 1923, the Hayakawa Brothers factory was destroyed in the Great Kantō earthquake. By 1924, Tokuji Hayakawa had turned his attention to the manufacture of radios, but his first invention was immortalized in the name of his new company: Sharp.

==Manufacturers==
Some present-day manufacturers are: Pentel, Pilot, Tombow, Uni-ball and Zebra of Japan; Faber-Castell, Lamy, Rotring and Staedtler of Germany; Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth of the Czech Republic; Bic of France; Monami of South Korea; PaperMate and Parker of USA; Caran d&#x27;Ache of Switzerland and numerous Chinese as well as other Asian and European manufacturers.

==Mechanism types==

Mechanical pencils can be divided into two basic types: those that both hold the lead and can actively propel it forward, and those that only hold the lead in position.

Screw-based pencils advance the lead by twisting a screw mechanism, which moves a propelling pin or lead carrier down the barrel of the pencil. Lead is not fed from an internal reservoir, but must be replaced manually, usually from the front. This was the most common type up until the earlier part of the mid-twentieth century. Most have a mechanism that retracts the lead when twisted the other way, but many older designs do not and the lead must be pushed back into the pencil manually.

A clutch pencil (or leadholder) tends to use thicker leads (2.0–5.6 mm) and generally holds only one piece of lead at a time. A typical clutch pencil is activated by pressing the eraser cap on the top, to open the jaws inside the tip and allow the lead to freely drop through from the barrel (or back into it when retracting). Because the lead falls out freely when the jaws are opened, its forward movement cannot be controlled except by external means. This can be easily done by keeping the tip of the pencil a few millimeters above a work surface or the palm of one&#x27;s hand. Some clutch pencils do have mechanisms which incrementally advance the lead, such as the Alvin Tech-Matic leadholder, but these are not normally considered to be in the same category as most pencils with propelling mechanisms.

Ratchet-based or &quot;repeater&quot; pencils are a variant of the clutch pencil, in which the lead is held in place by two or three small jaws inside a ring at the tip. The jaws are controlled by a button on the end or the side of the pencil. When the button is pushed, the jaws move forward and separate, allowing the lead to advance. When the button is released and the jaws retract, the &quot;lead retainer&quot; (a small rubber device inside the tip) keeps the lead in place, preventing the lead from either falling freely outward or riding back up into the barrel until the jaws recover their grip. Other designs use a precisely-fitted metal sleeve to guide and support the lead, and do not need a rubber retainer.

In one type of ratchet-based pencil, shaking the pencil back and forth causes a weight inside the pencil to operate a mechanism in the cap. A button may be present on the top or side of the pencil, to allow the user to advance the lead manually when necessary. Another variation advances the lead automatically. In this design, the lead is advanced by a ratchet but only prevented from going back into the pencil, just held from falling by a small amount of friction. The nib is a spring-loaded collar that, when depressed as the lead is worn away, extends out again when pressure is released.

An advanced ratchet type has a mechanism that rotates the pencil lead 9 degrees counter-clockwise every time the lead is pressed on to the paper (which counts as one stroke), to distribute wear evenly. This &quot;auto-rotation&quot; mechanism keeps the lead 50% narrower than in the common propelling mechanical pencils, resulting in uniform thickness of the lines written onto the paper. The design was first patented by Schmidt of Germany, and later developed by Mitsubishi Pencil Company of Japan, and named &quot;Kuru Toga&quot; under the Uni brand. This type of pencil is most suited for Asian languages that have multiple strokes per letter or word, where the pencil is frequently lifted off the paper. The mechanism is less suitable for cursive writing used in western scripts. Another recent auto-rotation movement by Uni rotates the lead 18 degrees per stroke (or 20 strokes per complete revolution), which is better suited for western scripts.

There exist protection mechanisms that prevent the lead from breaking (within certain limits) when excessive pressure is exerted while writing. A mechanism employed in the &quot;DelGuard&quot; system by Zebra of Japan causes the lead sleeve to extend outward when excessive pressure is applied at an angle. When excess vertical pressure is applied on the lead, the lead is automatically retracted inwards.

Higher-end mechanical pencils often feature a lead hardness grade indicator and sometimes feature a retractable lead guide pipe. This allows the lead guide pipe to retract back into the pencil body, which will keep it protected in storage and during transit and makes it &#x27;pocket-safe&#x27;.

==Lead variations==
In spite of the name, pencil leads do not contain the toxic chemical element lead, but are typically made with graphite and clay, or plastic polymers. The downside of mechanical leads are that they are not as strong as traditional pencils. Wooden pencil lead is bonded to the outer wooden case, therefore providing more lead protection and strength. This changed in 1962, when Pentel launched new mechanical pencils with the diameters of 0.5mm and 0.7mm. These pencils contained a new type of lead formulated with polymers that act as a binder to strengthen the lead. This polymer replaced the clay in mechanical pencil lead and made it easier for manufacturers to produce lead with smaller diameters.

Compared to standard pencils, mechanical pencils have a smaller range of marking types, though numerous variations exist. Most mechanical pencils can be refilled, but some inexpensive models are meant to be disposable and are discarded when empty.

===Diameter===
Mechanical pencil mechanisms use only a single lead diameter. Some pencils, such as the Pentel Function 357, place several mechanisms within the same housing, so as to offer a range of thicknesses (in this case three: 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 mm). 1.00 mm leads also exist, but they are very rare.

Different sizes of lead diameters are available to accommodate various preferences and pencil builds, as shown in the table below. The most common lead sizes are 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm, whose line widths provide a favourable balance between precision and strength. Less common lead sizes can range from 0.2 mm up to 5.6 mm. Pentel has also previously demonstrated a prototype 0.1 mm pencil.

Pencils with sub-millimeter leads can usually hold multiple leads at the same time, reducing the frequency of refills. One exception was the Pentel 350 E, possibly Pentel&#x27;s first mechanical pencil, which could only hold a single stick of 0.5 mm lead. Refill leads can be bought in small tubes and inserted into the barrel as needed.

The bracketed values in inches were found by calculation and rounded to 3 decimal places.

The diameters, however, are not exact. The exact diameter is usually slightly larger. The Japanese JIS standard for mechanical pencil leads, states that the actual diameter for &quot;0.5 mm&quot; lead (for example), should range from 0.55 mm to 0.58 mm.

===Length===
For sub-millimeter diameter leads, the standard length of the cylindrical stick for all grades is 60 mm. However, some manufacturers make leads that are 75 mm long, for selected grades.

===Hardness===
As with non-mechanical pencils, the leads of mechanical pencils are available in a range of hardness ratings, depending on the user&#x27;s desired balance between darkness and durability. A commonly-used mechanical pencil lead is identical in density, but not in thickness to a traditional HB (US#2) pencil lead. The hardness depends on the proportion of polymer or resin and graphite in the lead. It is determined by a numerical scale: the higher the number, the harder the lead. Similarly to standard wooden pencils, the lead is distinguished by grading scales. H stands for hardness; as they are typically harder and produce a light gray color. B stands for blackness; they produce a darker color and are typically softer. F stands for fine; it is in between H and HB on the lead grading scale. Compared to standard pencils that have 24 grades of lead, there are only 10 grades of mechanical pencil lead, ranging from 4H-4B.

===Pigments===
Mechanical pencils with colored leads are less common, but do exist. Crayola&#x27;s &quot;Twistable&quot; product line includes two different types of colored pencils (erasable and non-erasable) with mechanical feed mechanisms that are dispensed by twisting, but does not offer refill leads. Several companies such as Pentel, Pilot, and Uni-ball (Mitsubishi Pencil Co.) currently manufacture colored refill leads in a limited range of diameters (0.5 mm, 0.7 mm, or 2.0 mm) for their own products, as well as &quot;variety packs&quot; consisting of different colors of leads for those who want to trial different colors of lead. Koh-i-Noor makes mechanical colored pencils with replaceable leads in 2.0, 3.15 and 5.6 mm sizes.

<text>The Catholic University of Korea () is a private Roman Catholic university in Bucheon, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. It was established in 1855. The Catholic University of Korea operates campuses in Seoul and in the neighboring Bucheon. The university&#x27;s school of medicine operates eight affiliated hospitals throughout the country.

The Catholic University of Korea offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees, master&#x27;s degrees, and doctoral degrees in Catholic theology, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, medicine, and engineering.

==History==
The university traces its roots to St. Joseph&#x27;s Seminary in Baeron, a Catholic refuge in modern-day Jecheon, North Chungcheong Province. It was founded in 1855 before Christianity was legalized. After the legalization of Christianity, the school moved to Yongsan District, Seoul, in 1887, and was renamed Seminary of Sacred Heart of Jesus. A hospital associated with the seminary was opened in 1936. The seminary became Songsin College in 1947 and the medical school was established in 1954. The name was later changed to Catholic College. Songsim Women&#x27;s College (Songsim, or 聖心, means &#x27;Sacred Heart&#x27; in Korean) was founded in 1964; the two colleges were merged in 1995 to form the present-day entity of Catholic University.

==Campuses==
The Catholic University of Korea has three campuses in the Seoul Capital Area. The theology department is based at the Songsin Theological Campus in Hyehwa-dong, central Seoul, while the medical and nursing colleges are located at the Songeui Medical Campus in Banpo-dong, Seoul. The remaining departments are situated at the Songsim Global Campus in Bucheon, Gyeonggi-do.
===Songeui Campus===
====Seoul St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital====
Seoul St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital is one of the affiliated hospitals of the Catholic University of Korea and is part of the CMC (Catholic Medical Center) network. The new hospital opened on 30 April 2009 on the campus of the Catholic University of Korea; it has 1,355 beds, including Intensive care unit (ICU) 110 beds. Sun Myung Moon was admitted there and died there in 2012.

==Academics==
The university has a policy of &quot;inbound globalization&quot;, requiring all freshmen to live in the English language dormitory which can accommodate 1,200 students and professors. Residents are encouraged to communicate only in English during the program, which usually runs for a whole semester.

<text>The Adivasi (also transliterated as Adibasi) are heterogeneous tribal groups across the Indian subcontinent. The term is a self-designation adopted by those groups to assert indigeneity through socio-cultural identity. They are officially recognized as &quot;Scheduled Tribes&quot; in India and as &quot;Ethnic Minorities&quot; in Bangladesh. They comprise 8.6% of India&#x27;s population and 1.1% of Bangladesh&#x27;s; or 104.2 million in India, according to the 2011 census, and 2 million in Bangladesh according to the 2010 estimate.

Though claimed to be among the original inhabitants of India subcontinent, many present-day Adivasi communities formed after the decline of the Indus Valley civilisation, harboring various degrees of ancestry from ancient hunter-gatherers, Indus Valley civilisation, Indo-Aryan, Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman language speakers.

Adivasi studies is a new scholarly field, drawing upon archaeology, anthropology, agrarian history, environmental history, subaltern studies, indigenous studies, aboriginal studies, and developmental economics. It adds debates that are specific to the Indian context.

==Definition and etymology==

&quot;Adivasi&quot; is the collective term for the tribes of the Indian subcontinent, who are claimed to be the indigenous people of India. It refers to &quot;any of various ethnic groups considered to be the original inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent&quot;. However, Tribe and Adivasi have different meanings. Tribe means a social unit whereas Adivasi means ancient inhabitants. The former is a anthropological term while the later is socio-political term, specifically used in Indian subcontinent. As a socio-political construct, the term Adivasi often overlooks the historical complexities of indigeneity, including migration, linguistics, anthropology, and archaeology—something Hardiman views as “The idea that Adivasis are autochthonous, or original, inhabitants is by the fact that many such groups are known to have migrated in recorded history into the areas in which they are now found, often displacing existing inhabitants in the process... There have been so many migrations in and out of this region in past centuries that no particular &quot;jati&quot; [community] can have genuine grounds for making such a claim.”

The term Adivasi, in fact, is a Sanskrit word specifically coined in 1930s by the tribal political activists to give a distinct and collective indigenous identity to the tribals, alleging that Indo-Aryan and Dravidian ethnolinguistic group are not indigenous to the land. The term was initially popularized by tribal activist organizations in present-day Jharkhand. Later, Thakkar Bapa used the word to advocate for a pan-Indian reference to the inhabitants of forests, a usage that was later adopted, although not popularly by Gandhi. The word was used in 1936 and included in English dictionary prepared by Rasal. Post-independence, Jaipal Singh Munda, a representative of tribals in the Constituent Assembly, advocated for the term &#x27;Adivasi&#x27;. However, due to the need for legal connotation, Ambedkar rejected the use of such general socio-political terms in the Constitution by adopting &#x27;Scheduled Tribe&#x27; for tribals and &#x27;Scheduled Caste&#x27; for untouchables, although he advocated for &quot;Dalits&quot;. Ambedkar, responding to Munda’s advocacy for &#x27;Adivasi&#x27;, clarified: &quot;why I substituted the word “scheduled” for the word “aboriginal” the explanation is ... the word ‘scheduled tribe’ has a fixed meaning, because it enumerates the tribes ... the word ‘Adibasi’ is really a general term which has no specific legal &quot;de jure&quot; connotation, something like the Untouchables [&quot;Dalits&quot;]. Anybody may include anybody in the term &#x27;untouchable&#x27; [and &quot;Adibasi&quot;]. ...by this Constitution, we are conferring certain privileges, certain rights on these Adibasis. In order that, if the matter was taken to a court of law there should be a precise definition as to who are these Adibasis, it was decided to invent, so to say, another category or another term to be called ‘Scheduled tribes’ and to enumerate the Adibasis under that head.&quot;

The term was recognised by Markandey Katju the judge of the Supreme Court of India in 2011. 

In most of Indo-Aryan languages, such as Hindi and Bengali, &quot;Adivasi&quot; means &quot;Original Inhabitants,&quot; from &quot;ādi&quot; &#x27;beginning, origin&#x27;; and &quot;vāsin&quot; &#x27;dweller&#x27; (itself from &quot;vas&quot; &#x27;to dwell&#x27;), thus literally meaning &#x27;beginning inhabitant&#x27;. Although terms such as &quot;atavika&quot;, &quot;vanavāsi&quot; (&quot;forest dwellers&quot;), or &quot;girijan&quot; (&quot;mountain people&quot;) are also used for the tribes of India, &quot;adivāsi&quot; carries the specific meaning of being the original and autochthonous inhabitants of a given region, and the self-designation of those tribal groups. However, the use and acceptance of the term Adivasi vary across places, communities, and contexts and do not always carry its original connotation. For instance tribals of North East India don&#x27;t use the term Adivasi for themselves, rather prefer the word &quot;Indigenous&quot; or &quot;Tribe&quot;. The term Adivāsi applies only to the immigrated Tea-tribes of Central India origin. In Bangladesh, Adivasi term is also used to refer tribals of Central India affiliation, although not popularly as India, wherein the tribals have designated as &quot;Ethnic minorities&quot; (). Similarly the term &quot;Adivasi Janjati&quot; used in Nepal for hierarchically lowly-status ethnic groups in Nepal&#x27;s caste system, having own socio-cultural institutions, although the political context differed historically under the Shah and Rana dynasties. In Sri Lanka, the Vedda people are referred as Adivasi.

The Constitution of India doesn&#x27;t use the word &quot;Adivasi&quot;, and directs government officials to not use the word in official documents. The notified tribals are known as Scheduled Tribes (&quot;Anusuchit Janjati&quot;) in the Constitution. The constitution of India grouped these ethnic groups together &quot;as targets for social and economic development&quot;. Since that time the tribe of India have been known officially as Scheduled Tribes. Article 366 (25) defined scheduled tribes as &quot;such tribes or tribal communities or parts of or groups within such tribes or tribal communities as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of this constitution&quot;. But, due to the political leverage associated with tribals in the Constitution of India, the term &quot;Adivasi&quot; serves as a unifying factor both politically and socio-culturally, maintaining its influence in public discourse as a &quot;status quo&quot;, challenging the legally designated, state-specific administrative term Scheduled Tribes.

However, India does not exclusively recognise Adivasis Tribes Scheduled Tribes as indigenous people of India, rather considers all Indians as indigenous to the land. Thus, India has disagreed or refused at various international forums, when there is uncertain in the concepts of indigeneity and considered same yardstick across countries for identification. For instance, although India initially ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 107 on Indigenous and Tribal Populations Convention, 1957, in 1989, India refused to sign the ILO Convention 169. In 2007, considering all Indians as indigenous, India voted for the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in the United Nations General Assembly.

==Demographics==

A substantial number of Adivasi tribal communities are recognised as Scheduled Tribe under the Constitution of India. Those Scheduled Tribe constitute 8.6% of India&#x27;s population, while in Bangladesh they&#x27;re designated as &quot;Ethnic minority&quot; and constitute around 1.1% of Bangladesh&#x27;s population.

One concentration lies in a belt along the northwest Himalayas: consisting of Jammu and Kashmir, where are found many semi-nomadic groups, to Ladakh and northern Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, where are found Tibeto-Burman groups.

In the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland, more than 90% of the population is tribal. However, in the remaining northeast states of Assam, Manipur, Sikkim, and Tripura, tribal peoples form between 20 and 30% of the population.

The largest population of tribals lives in a belt stretching from eastern Gujarat and Rajasthan in the west all the way to western West Bengal, a region known as the tribal belt. These tribes correspond roughly to three regions. The western region, in eastern Gujarat, southeastern Rajasthan, northwestern Maharashtra as well as western Madhya Pradesh, is dominated by Indo-Aryan speaking tribes like the Bhils. The central region, covering eastern Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, western and southern Chhattisgarh, northern and eastern Telangana, northern Andhra Pradesh and western Odisha is dominated by Dravidian tribes like the Gonds and Khonds. The eastern belt, centred on the Chhota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand and adjacent areas of Chhattisgarh, Odisha and West Bengal, is dominated by Munda tribes like the Bhumijs, Hos and Santals. Roughly 75% of the total tribal population live in this belt, although the tribal population there accounts for only around 10% of the region&#x27;s total population.
Further south, the region near Bellary in Karnataka has a large concentration of tribals, mostly Boyas/ Valmikis. Small pockets can be found throughout the rest of South India. By far the largest of these pockets is in found in the region containing the Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu, Wayanad district of Kerala and nearby hill ranges of Chamarajanagar and Mysore districts of southern Karnataka. Further south, only small pockets of tribal settlement remain in the Western and Eastern Ghats.

The scheduled tribe population in Jharkhand constitutes 26.2% of the state. Tribals in Jharkhand mainly follow Sarnaism, an animistic religion. Chhattisgarh has also over 80 lakh scheduled tribe population. Assam has over 40 lakh Adivasis primarily as tea workers. Adivasis in India mainly follow Animism, Hinduism and Christianity.

In the case of Bangladesh, most Adivasi groups are found in the Chittagong hill tracks along the border with Myanmar, in Sylhet and in the Northwest of Bangladesh. In Sylhet and in the north west you can find groups such as the Sauria Paharia, Kurukh, Santal, Munda and more, and other groups such as the Pnar, Garo, Meitei, Bishnupriya Manipuri and more. In the Chittagong Hill tracts you can find variouse Tibeto-Burman groups such as the Marma, Chakma, Bawm, Tripuri, Mizo, Mru, Rakhine and more. In Bangladesh most Adivasis are Buddhists who follow the Theravada school of Buddhism, Animism and Christianity are also followed in fact Buddhism has affected Adivasis so much that it has influenced local Animistic beliefs of other Adivasis.

==History==

===Origin===
Though claimed to be the original inhabitants of India, many present-day Adivasi communities formed after the decline of the Indus Valley civilisation, harboring various degrees of ancestry from ancient hunter-gatherers, Indus Valley civilisation, Indo-Aryan, Austroasiatic and Tibeto-Burman language speakers. Only tribal people of Andaman Islands remained isolated for more than 25000 years.

===Ancient and medieval period===
According to linguist Anvita Abbi, tribes in India are characterized by distinct lifestyle and are outside of caste system. 
Although considered uncivilised and primitive, Adivasis were usually not held to be intrinsically impure by surrounding populations (usually Dravidian or Indo-Aryan), unlike Dalits, who were. Thus, the Adivasi origins of Valmiki, who composed the Ramayana, were acknowledged, as were the origins of Adivasi tribes such as the Garasia and Bhilala, which descended from mixed Rajput and Bhil marriages. Unlike the subjugation of the Dalits, the Adivasis often enjoyed autonomy and, depending on region, evolved mixed hunter-gatherer and farming economies, controlling their lands as a joint patrimony of the tribe. In some areas, securing Adivasi approval and support was considered crucial by local rulers, and larger Adivasi groups were able to sustain their own kingdoms in central India. The Bhil, Meenas and Gond Rajas of Garha-Mandla and Chanda are examples of an Adivasi aristocracy that ruled in this region, and were &quot;not only the hereditary leaders of their Gond subjects, but also held sway over substantial communities of non-tribals who recognized them as their feudal lords.&quot;

The historiography of relationships between the Adivasis and the rest of Indian society is patchy. There are references to alliances between Ahom Kings of Brahmaputra valley and the hill Nagas.
This relative autonomy and collective ownership of Adivasi land by Adivasis was severely disrupted by the advent of the Mughals in the early 16th century. Rebellions against Mughal authority include the Bhil Rebellion of 1632 and the Bhil-Gond Insurrection of 1643 which were both pacified by Mughal soldiers. With the advent of the Kachwaha Rajputs and Mughals into their territory, the Meenas were gradually sidelined and pushed deep into the forests. As a result, historical literature has completely bypassed the Meena tribe. The combined army of Mughals and Bharmal attacked the tribal king Bada Meena and killed him damaging 52 kots and 56 gates. Bada&#x27;s treasure was shared between Mughals and Bharmal.

===British period (c. 1857 – 1947)===
During the period of British rule, the colonial administration encroached upon the &quot;adivasi&quot; tribal system, which led to widespread resentment against the British among the tribesmen. The tribesmen frequently supported rebellions or rebelled themselves, while their &quot;raja&quot; looked negatively upon the British administrative innovations. Beginning in the 18th century, the British added to the consolidation of feudalism in India, first under the Jagirdari system and then under the zamindari system. Beginning with the Permanent Settlement imposed by the British in Bengal and Bihar, which later became the template for a deepening of feudalism throughout India, the older social and economic system in the country began to alter radically. Land, both forest areas belonging to adivasis and settled farmland belonging to non-adivasi peasants, was rapidly made the legal property of British-designated zamindars (landlords), who in turn moved to extract the maximum economic benefit possible from their newfound property and subjects. Adivasi lands sometimes experienced an influx of non-local settlers, often brought from far away (as in the case of Muslims and Sikhs brought to Kol territory) by the zamindars to better exploit local land, forest and labour. Deprived of the forests and resources they traditionally depended on and sometimes coerced to pay taxes, many adivasis were forced to borrow at usurious rates from moneylenders, often the zamindars themselves. When they were unable to pay, that forced them to become bonded labourers for the zamindars. Often, far from paying off the principal of their debt, they were unable even to offset the compounding interest, and this was made the justification for their children working for the zamindar after the death of the initial borrower. In the case of the Andamanese adivasis, their protective isolation changed with the establishment of a British colonial presence on the islands. Lacking immunity against common infectious diseases of the Eurasian mainland, the large Jarawa habitats on the southeastern regions of South Andaman Island experienced a massive population decline due to disease within four years of the establishment of a colonial presence on the island in 1789.

Land dispossession by the &quot;zamindars&quot; or interference by the colonial government resulted in a number of Adivasi revolts in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, such as the Bhumij rebellion of 1767-1833 and Santal hul (or Santhal rebellion) of 1855–56. Although these were suppressed by the governing British authority (the East India Company prior to 1858, and the British government after 1858), partial restoration of privileges to adivasi elites (e.g. to &quot;Mankis&quot;, the leaders of Munda tribes) and some leniency in levels of taxation resulted in relative calm in the region, despite continuing and widespread dispossession from the late nineteenth century onwards. The economic deprivation, in some cases, triggered internal adivasi migrations within India that would continue for another century, including as labour for the emerging tea plantations in Assam.

====Participation in Indian independence movement====

There were tribal reform and rebellion movements during the period of the British Empire, some of which also participated in the Indian independence movement or attacked mission posts. There were several Adivasis in the Indian independence movement including Birsa Munda, Dharindhar Bhyuan, Laxman Naik, Jantya Bhil, Bangaru Devi and Rehma Vasave, Mangri Oraon.

During the period of British rule, India saw the rebellions of several then backward castes, mainly tribal peoples that revolted against British rule. These were:
* Halba rebellion (1774–79)
* Chakma rebellion (1776–1787)
* Chuar rebellion in Bengal (1795–1809)

* Santhal rebellion (1856–57)
* Bhil rebellion, begun by Tatya Tope in Banswara (1858)
* Koli revolt (1859)
* Great Kuki Invasion of 1860s
* Gond rebellion, begun by Ramji Gond in Adilabad (1860)
* Muria rebellion (1876)
* Rani rebellion (1878–82)
* Bhumkal (1910)

== Literature ==
Adivasi literature is the literature composed by the tribals of the Indian subcontinent. It is composed in more than 100 languages. The tradition of tribal literature includes oral literature and written literature in tribal languages and non-tribal languages. The basic feature of tribal literature is the presence of tribal philosophy in it. Prominent tribal writers include Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, Nirmala Putul, Vahru Sonawane, Temsula Ao, Mamang Dai, Narayan, Rose Kerketta, Ram Dayal Munda, Vandana Tete, Anuj Lugun etc.

== Religion ==

In the Census of India from 1871 to 1941, tribal people and their religions were described in several ways: Forest tribe (1891); animist (1901); tribal animist (1911); hill and forest tribe (1921); primitive tribe (1931); and tribes (1941). However, since the census of 1951, the tribal population has been recorded separately, for each denomination. Some Adivasis have been converted to Christianity starting with British period and after independence. During the last two decades Adivasi from Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand have converted to Protestantism, as a result of increased presence of missionaries.

Adivasi beliefs vary by tribe, and are usually different from the historical Vedic religion, with its monistic underpinnings, Indo-European deities (who are often cognates of ancient Iranian, Greek and Roman deities, e.g. Mitra/Mithra/Mithras), lack of idol worship and lack of a concept of reincarnation. Tribals have their own distinct religions based in nature worship; most tribals (more than 89%) identify as Hindus and follow the Hindu religion, some (5.53%) have embraced Christianity due to proselytisation by Christian Missionaries albeit not without social and cultural conflicts between their tribal roots and the newly-adopted Christian traditions, and some tribals, mainly in Lakshadweep are Muslims and are believed to have embraced Islam during the 14th century; other tribals (4.19 %) follow their distinct religion. Conversion of tribals to Christianity has been a growing phenomenon from the days of the British rule. Christians have been jailed due to accusations of &quot;forced conversions&quot; of tribals. Conversion to Islam is a growing phenomenon in recent times. Tribals in the Dang district, having their own distinct religions based in nature worship, are being proselytised to Hinduism, by Hindutva ideological groups such as the BJP &amp; the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP). Tribal ancestor worshippers in the Nilgiris, have raised objections to be being labelled as Hindu, Muslim, or Christian. 

===Animism===

Animism (from Latin &quot;animus, -i&quot; &quot;soul, life&quot;) is the worldview that non-human entities (animals, plants, and inanimate objects or phenomena) possess a spiritual essence. The &quot;Encyclopaedia of Religion and Society&quot; estimates that 1–5% of India&#x27;s population is animist. India&#x27;s government recognises that India&#x27;s indigenous subscribe to pre-Hindu animist-based religions.

Animism is used in the anthropology of religion as a term for the belief system of some indigenous tribal peoples, especially prior to the development of organised religion. Although each culture has its own different mythologies and rituals, &quot;animism&quot; is said to describe the most common, foundational thread of indigenous peoples&#x27; &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;supernatural&quot; perspectives. The animistic perspective is so fundamental, mundane, everyday and taken-for-granted that most animistic indigenous people do not even have a word in their languages that corresponds to &quot;animism&quot; (or even &quot;religion&quot;); the term is an anthropological construct rather than one designated by the people themselves.

====Donyi-Polo====
Donyi-Polo is the designation given to the indigenous religions, of animistic and shamanic type, of the Tani, from Arunachal Pradesh, in northeastern India. The name &quot;Donyi-Polo&quot; means &quot;Sun-Moon&quot;.

====Sarnaism====
Sarnaism or Sarna (local languages: &quot;Sarna Dhorom&quot;, meaning &quot;religion of the holy woods&quot;) defines the indigenous religions of the Adivasi populations of the states of Central-East India, such as the Munda, the Ho, the Santali, the Khuruk, and the others. The Munda, Ho, Santhal and Oraon tribe followed the Sarna religion, where Sarna means sacred grove. Their religion is based on the oral traditions passed from generation-to-generation. It involves worship of village deity, Sun and Moon.

====Other tribal animist====
Animist hunter gatherer Nayaka people of Nilgiri hills of South India.

Animism is the traditional religion of Nicobarese people; their religion is marked by the dominance and interplay with spirit worship, witch doctors and animal sacrifice.

===Hinduism===

====Adivasi roots of modern Hinduism====
Some historians and anthropologists assert that many Hindu practices might have been adopted from Adivasi culture. This also includes the sacred status of certain animals such as monkeys, cows, fish (matsya), peacocks, cobras (nagas) and elephants and plants such as the sacred fig (&quot;pipal&quot;), Ocimum tenuiflorum (&quot;tulsi&quot;) and Azadirachta indica (&quot;neem&quot;), which may once have held totemic importance for certain adivasi tribes.

====Adivasi saints====
A &quot;sant&quot; is an Indian holy man, and a title of a devotee or ascetic, especially in north and east India. Generally, a holy or saintly person is referred to as a mahatma, paramahamsa, or swami, or given the prefix Sri or Srila before their name. The term is sometimes misrepresented in English as &quot;Hindu saint&quot;, although &quot;sant&quot; is unrelated to &quot;saint&quot;.
* Sant Dhira or Kannappa Nayanar, one of 63 Nayanar Shaivite sants, a hunter from whom Lord Shiva gladly accepted food offerings. It is said that he poured water from his mouth on the Shivlingam and offered the Lord swine flesh.
* Sant Dhudhalinath, Gujarati, a 17th or 18th-century devotee (P. 4, &quot;The Story of Historic People of India-The Kolis&quot;)
* Sant Gurudev Kalicharan Brahma or Guru Brahma, a Bodo who founded the Brahma Dharma aimed against Christian missionaries and colonialists. The Brahma Dharma movement sought to unite peoples of all religions to worship God together and survives even today.
* Sant Kalu Dev, Punjab, related with Fishermen community Nishadha
* Sant Kubera, ethnic Gujarati, taught for over 35 years and had 20,000 followers in his time.
* Sant Tirumangai Alvar, Kallar, composed the six Vedangas in beautiful Tamil verse
* Saint Kalean Guru (Kalean Murmu) is the most beloved person among Santal Tribes community who was widely popular &#x27;Nagam Guru&#x27; Guru of Early Histories in fourteen century by the references of their forefathers.

====Sages====
* Bhakta Shabari, a Nishadha woman who offered Shri Rama and Shri Laxmana her half-eaten ber fruit, which they gratefully accepted when they were searching for Shri Sita Devi in the forest.

====Maharishis====
* Maharshi Matanga, Matanga Bhil, Guru of Bhakta Shabari. In fact, Chandalas are often addressed as &#x27;Matanga &#x27;in passages like Varaha Purana 1.139.91

====Avatars====
* Kirata – the form of Lord Shiva as a hunter. It is mentioned in the Mahabharata. The Karppillikkavu Sree Mahadeva Temple, Kerala adores Lord Shiva in this avatar and is known to be one of the oldest surviving temples in Bharat.
* Vettakkorumakan, the son of Lord Kirata.
* Kaladutaka or &#x27;Vaikunthanatha&#x27;, Kallar (robber), avatar of Lord Vishnu.

====Other tribals and Hinduism====
Some Hindus do not believe that Indian tribals are close to the romantic ideal of the ancient culture of the Vedic people. Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar said:
At the Lingaraja Temple in Bhubaneswar, there are Brahmin and Badu (tribal) priests. The Badus have the most intimate contact with the deity of the temple, and only they can bathe and adorn it.

The Bhils are mentioned in the Mahabharata. Ekalavya considered Darona as his guru, and he had the honour to be invited to Yudhishthira&#x27;s Rajasuya Yajna at Indraprastha. Indian tribals were also part of royal armies in the Ramayana and in the Arthashastra.

Shabari was a Bhil woman who offered Rama and Lakshmana jujubes when they were searching for Sita in the forest. Matanga, a Bhil, became a Brahmana.

====Brahmanization and Rajputization====
Bhangya Bhukya notes that during the final years of the British Raj, while education introduced Westernization in the hilly areas of central India, the regions also parallelly underwent the Hinduization and Rajputization processes. The Gond people and their chiefs started doing the &quot;caste–Hindu practices&quot; and frequently claimed the &quot;Rajput, and thus kshatriya status&quot;. The British government used to support these claims as they viewed the adivasi society to be less civilized than the caste society and believed that adivasi peoples&#x27; association with the castes would make the adivasis &quot;more civilized and sober&quot; and &quot;easier for the colonial state to control&quot;. Bhukya also points out that central India&#x27;s &quot;Raj Gond families&quot; had already adopted the religious and social traditions of the Rajputs before the British Raj in India, and there were &quot;matrimonial relations&quot; between a number of Gond and Rajput Rajas. However, the British governments&#x27; policies of offering &quot;&quot;zamindari&quot; rights, village headships and &quot;patelships&quot;&quot; fueled the process.

According to Patit Paban Mishra, &quot;the &#x27;ksatriyaization&#x27; of tribal rulers and their surroundings, resulted in the Hinduization of tribal areas&quot;.

===Demands for a separate religious code===
Some Adivasi organisations have demanded that a distinct religious code be listed for Adivasis in the 2011 census of India. The All India Adivasi Conference was held on 1 and 2 January 2011 at Burnpur, Asansol, West Bengal. 750 delegates were present from all parts of India and cast their votes for Religion code as follows: Sari Dhorom – 632, Sarna – 51, Kherwalism – 14 and Other Religions – 03. Census of India.

==Education==

Tribal communities in India are the least educationally developed. First generation learners have to face social, psychological and cultural barriers to get education. This has been one of the reasons for poor performance of tribal students in schools. Poor literacy rate since independence has resulted in absence of tribals in academia and higher education. The literacy rate for STs has gone up from 8.5% (male – 13.8%, female – 3.2%) in 1961 to 29.6% (male – 40.6%, female – 18.2%) in 1991 and to 40% (male – 59%, female – 37%) in 1999–2000. States with large proportion of STs like Mizoram, Nagaland and Meghalaya have high literacy rate while states with large number of tribals like Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have low tribal literacy rate. Tribal students have very high drop-out rates during school education.

Extending the system of primary education into tribal areas and reserving places for needing them, they say, to work in the fields. On the other hand, in those parts of the northeast where tribes have generally been spared the wholesale onslaught of outsiders, schooling has helped tribal people to secure political and economic benefits. The education system there has provided a corps of highly trained tribal members in the professions and high-ranking administrative posts. tribal children in middle and high schools and higher education institutions are central to government policy, but efforts to improve a tribe&#x27;s educational status have had mixed results. Recruitment of qualified teachers and determination of the appropriate language of instruction also remain troublesome. Commission after commission on the &quot;language question&quot; has called for instruction, at least at the primary level, in the students&#x27; native language. In some regions, tribal children entering school must begin by learning the official regional language, often one completely unrelated to their tribal language.

Many tribal schools are plagued by high drop-out rates. Children attend for the first three to four years of primary school and gain a smattering of knowledge, only to lapse into illiteracy later. Few who enter continue up to the tenth grade; of those who do, few manage to finish high school. Therefore, very few are eligible to attend institutions of higher education, where the high rate of attrition continues. Members of agrarian tribes like the Gonds often are reluctant to send their children to school,

An academy for teaching and preserving Adivasi languages and culture was established in 1999 by the Bhasha Research and Publication Centre. The Adivasi Academy is located at Tejgadh in Gujarat.

==Economy==
Most tribes are concentrated in heavily forested areas that combine inaccessibility with limited political or economic significance. Historically, the economy of most tribes was subsistence agriculture or hunting and gathering. Tribal members traded with outsiders for the few necessities they lacked, such as salt and iron. A few local Hindu craftsmen might provide such items as cooking utensils.

In the early 20th century, however, large areas fell into the hands of non-tribals, on account of improved transportation and communications. Around 1900, many regions were opened by the British government to settlement through a scheme by which inward migrants received ownership of land free in return for cultivating it. For tribal people, however, land was often viewed as a common resource, free to whoever needed it. By the time tribals accepted the necessity of obtaining formal land titles, they had lost the opportunity to lay claim to lands that might rightfully have been considered theirs. The colonial and post-independence regimes belatedly realised the necessity of protecting tribals from the predations of outsiders and prohibited the sale of tribal lands. Although an important loophole in the form of land leases was left open, tribes made some gains in the mid-twentieth century, and some land was returned to tribal peoples despite obstruction by local police and land officials.

In the 1970s, tribal peoples came again under intense land pressure, especially in central India. Migration into tribal lands increased dramatically, as tribal people lost the titles to their lands in many ways – lease, forfeiture from debts, or bribery of land registry officials. Other non-tribals simply squatted or even lobbied governments to classify them as tribal to allow them to compete with the formerly established tribes. In any case, many tribal members became landless labourers in the 1960s and 1970s, and regions that a few years earlier had been the exclusive domain of tribes had an increasingly mixed population of tribals and non-tribals. Government efforts to evict nontribal members from illegal occupation have proceeded slowly; when evictions occur at all, those ejected are usually members of poor, lower castes.

Improved communications, roads with motorised traffic, and more frequent government intervention figured in the increased contact that tribal peoples had with outsiders. Commercial highways and cash crops frequently drew non-tribal people into remote areas. By the 1960s and 1970s, the resident nontribal shopkeeper was a permanent feature of many tribal villages. Since shopkeepers often sell goods on credit (demanding high interest), many tribal members have been drawn deeply into debt or mortgaged their land. Merchants also encourage tribals to grow cash crops (such as cotton or castor-oil plants), which increases tribal dependence on the market for necessities. Indebtedness is so extensive that although such transactions are illegal, traders sometimes &#x27;sell&#x27; their debtors to other merchants, much like indentured peons.

The final blow for some tribes has come when non-tribals, through political jockeying, have managed to gain legal tribal status, that is, to be listed as a Scheduled Tribe.

Tribes in the Himalayan foothills have not been as hard-pressed by the intrusions of non-tribal. Historically, their political status was always distinct from the rest of India. Until the British colonial period, there was little effective control by any of the empires centred in peninsular India; the region was populated by autonomous feuding tribes. The British, in efforts to protect the sensitive northeast frontier, followed a policy dubbed the &quot;Inner Line&quot;; non-tribal people were allowed into the areas only with special permission. Post-colonial governments have continued the policy, protecting the Himalayan tribes as part of the strategy to secure the border with China.

===Ecological threats===
Many smaller tribal groups are quite sensitive to ecological degradation caused by modernisation. Both commercial forestry and intensive agriculture have proved destructive to the forests that had endured swidden agriculture for many centuries. Adivasis in central part of India have been victims of the Salwa Judum campaign by the Government against the Naxalite insurgency.

Government policies on forest reserves have affected tribal peoples profoundly. Government efforts to reserve forests have precipitated armed (if futile) resistance on the part of the tribal peoples involved. Intensive exploitation of forests has often meant allowing outsiders to cut large areas of trees (while the original tribal inhabitants were restricted from cutting), and ultimately replacing mixed forests capable of sustaining tribal life with single-product plantations. Non-tribals have frequently bribed local officials to secure the effective use of reserved forest lands.

The northern tribes have thus been sheltered from the kind of exploitation that those elsewhere in South Asia have suffered. In Arunachal Pradesh (formerly part of the North-East Frontier Agency), for example, tribal members control commerce and most lower-level administrative posts. Government construction projects in the region have provided tribes with a significant source of cash. Some tribes have made rapid progress through the education system (the role of early missionaries was significant in this regard). Instruction was begun in Assamese but was eventually changed to Hindi; by the early 1980s, English was taught at most levels. Northeastern tribal people have thus enjoyed a certain
measure of social mobility.

The continuing economic alienation and exploitation of many adivasis was highlighted as a &quot;systematic failure&quot; by the Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh in a 2009 conference of chief ministers of all 29 Indian states, where he also cited this as a major cause of the Naxalite unrest that has affected areas such as the Red Corridor.

==Issue and politics==

The criteria presently followed for specification of a community as a Scheduled Tribe are : (i) indications of primitive traits, (ii) distinctive culture, (iii) geographical isolation, (iv) shyness of contact with the community at large, and (v) backwardness.

Population complexities, and the controversies surrounding ethnicity and language in India, sometimes make the official recognition of groups as Adivasis (by way of inclusion in the Scheduled Tribes list) political and contentious. However, regardless of their language family affiliations, Australoid and Negrito groups that have survived as distinct forest, mountain or island-dwelling tribes in India and are often classified as Adivasi. The relatively autonomous tribal groups of Northeastern India (including Khasis, Apatani and Nagas), who are mostly Austro-Asiatic or Tibeto-Burman speakers, are also considered to be tribals: this area comprises 7.5% of India&#x27;s land area but 20% of its tribal population. However, not all autonomous northeastern groups are considered tribals; for instance, the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Meitei of Manipur were once tribal but, having been settled for many centuries, are caste Hindus.

It is also difficult, for a given social grouping, to definitively decide whether it is a &quot;caste&quot; or a &quot;tribe&quot;. A combination of internal social organisation, relationship with other groups, self-classification and perception by other groups has to be taken into account to make a categorisation, which is at best inexact and open to doubt. These categorisations have been diffused for thousands of years, and even ancient formulators of caste-discriminatory legal codes (which usually only applied to settled populations, and not Adivasis) were unable to come up with clean distinctions.

===Demands for tribal classification===
The additional difficulty in deciding whether a group meets the criteria to be Adivasi or not are the aspirational movements created by the federal and state benefits, including job and educational reservations, enjoyed by groups listed as scheduled tribes (STs). In Manipur, Meitei commentators have pointed to the lack of scheduled tribe status as a key economic disadvantage for Meiteis competing for jobs against groups that are classified as scheduled tribes. In Assam, Rajbongshi representatives have demanded scheduled tribe status as well. In Rajasthan, the Gujjar community has demanded ST status, even blockading the national capital of Delhi to press their demand. However, the Government of Rajasthan declined the Gujjars&#x27; demand, stating the Gujjars are treated as upper caste and are by no means a tribe. In several cases, these claims to tribalhood are disputed by tribes who are already listed in the schedule and fear economic losses if more powerful groups are recognised as scheduled tribes; for instance, the Rajbongshi demand faces resistance from the Bodo tribe, and the Meena tribe has vigorously opposed Gujjar aspirations to be recognised as a scheduled tribe.

===Endogamy, exogamy and ethnogenesis===
Part of the challenge is that the endogamous nature of tribes is also conformed to by the vast majority of Hindu castes. Indeed, many historians and anthropologists believe that caste endogamy reflects the once-tribal origins of the various groups who now constitute the settled Hindu castes. Another defining feature of caste Hindu society, which is often used to contrast them with Muslim and other social groupings, is lineage/clan (or &quot;gotra&quot;) and village exogamy. However, these in-marriage taboos are also held ubiquitously among tribal groups, and do not serve as reliable differentiating markers between caste and tribe. Again, this could be an ancient import from tribal society into settled Hindu castes. Tribes such as the Muslim Gujjars of Kashmir and the Kalash of Pakistan observe these exogamous traditions in common with caste Hindus and non-Kashmiri adivasis, though their surrounding Muslim populations do not.

Tribals are not part of the caste system, Some anthropologists, however, draw a distinction between tribes who have continued to be tribal and tribes that have been absorbed into caste society in terms of the breakdown of tribal (and therefore caste) boundaries, and the proliferation of new mixed caste groups. In other words, ethnogenesis (the construction of new ethnic identities) in tribes occurs through a fission process (where groups splinter-off as new tribes, which preserves endogamy), whereas with settled castes it usually occurs through intermixture (in violation of strict endogamy).

Tribals and are often regarded as constituting egalitarian societies. However, many scholars argue that the claim that tribals are an egalitarian society in contrast to a caste-based society is a part of a larger political agenda by some to maximise any differences from tribal and urban societies. According to scholar Koenraad Elst, caste practices and social taboos among Indian tribals date back to antiquity:
===Other criteria===
Unlike castes, which form part of a complex and interrelated local economic exchange system, tribes tend to form self-sufficient economic units. For most tribal people, land-use rights traditionally derive simply from tribal membership. Tribal society tends to the egalitarian, with its leadership based on ties of kinship and personality rather than on hereditary status. Tribes typically consist of segmentary lineages whose extended families provide the basis for social organisation and control. Tribal religion recognises no authority outside the tribe.

Any of these criteria may not apply in specific instances. Language does not always give an accurate indicator of tribal or caste status. Especially in regions of mixed population, many tribal groups have lost their original languages and simply speak local or regional languages. In parts of Assam—an area historically divided between warring tribes and villages—increased contact among villagers began during the colonial period, and has accelerated since independence in 1947. A pidgin Assamese developed, whereas educated tribal members learnt Hindi and, in the late twentieth century, English.

Self-identification and group loyalty do not provide unfailing markers of tribal identity either. In the case of stratified tribes, the loyalties of clan, kin, and family may well predominate over those of tribe. In addition, tribes cannot always be viewed as people living apart; the degree of isolation of various tribes has varied tremendously. The Gonds, Santals, and Bhils traditionally have dominated the regions in which they have lived. Moreover, tribal society is not always more egalitarian than the rest of the rural populace; some of the larger tribes, such as the Gonds, are highly stratified.

The apparently wide fluctuation in estimates of South Asia&#x27;s tribal population through the twentieth century gives a sense of how unclear the distinction between tribal and nontribal can be. India&#x27;s 1931 census enumerated 22 million tribal people, in 1941 only 10 million were counted, but by 1961 some 30 million and in 1991 nearly 68 million tribal members were included. The differences among the figures reflect changing census criteria and the economic incentives individuals have to maintain or reject classification as a tribal member.

These gyrations of census data serve to underline the complex relationship between caste and tribe. Although, in theory, these terms represent different ways of life and ideal types, in reality, they stand for a continuum of social groups. In areas of substantial contact between tribes and castes, social and cultural pressures have often tended to move tribes in the direction of becoming castes over a period of years. Tribal peoples with ambitions for social advancement in Indian society at large have tried to gain the classification of caste for their tribes. On occasion, an entire tribe or part of a tribe joined a Hindu sect and thus entered the caste system &quot;en masse&quot;. If a specific tribe engaged in practices that Hindus deemed polluting, the tribe&#x27;s status when it was assimilated into the caste hierarchy would be affected.

===Constitutional safeguards for Scheduled Tribes===
A number of constitutional and juridical safeguards for Adivasi have been encoded.

===Particularly vulnerable tribal groups===
The Scheduled Tribe groups who were identified as more isolated from the wider community and who maintain a distinctive cultural identity have been categorised as &quot;Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups&quot; (PVTGs) previously known as Primitive Tribal Groups by the Government at the centre. So far 75 tribal communities have been identified as &#x27;particularly vulnerable tribal groups&#x27; in 18 States and UT of Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands of India. These hunting, food-gathering, and some agricultural communities have been identified as less acculturated tribes among the tribal population groups and in need of special programmes for their sustainable development. The tribes are awakening and demanding their rights for special reservation quota for them.

<doc id="1298459" wikidata="Q60222" url="?curid=1298459" title="Erhard Heiden">
<text>Erhard Heiden (23 February 1901 – 19 March 1933) was an early member of the Nazi Party and the third commander of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS), the paramilitary wing of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (&quot;Storm Detachment; SA&quot;). He was appointed head of the SS, an elite subsection of the SA in 1927. At that time the SS numbered fewer than a thousand men and Heiden found it difficult to cope under the much larger SA. Heiden was not a success in the post, and SS membership dropped significantly under his leadership. He was dismissed from his post in 1929, officially for &quot;family reasons&quot;. He was arrested after the Nazis came to power in 1933 and executed that same year.

==Life==
Heiden was born on 23 February 1901 in Weiler-Simmerberg, a city in Bavaria. In 1917, he attended the NCO school in Fürstenfeldbruck. Little is known about his early life.

Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in World War I, hyperinflation, mass unemployment, poverty, crime and civil unrest plagued the country. During that time, Heiden served in a &quot;Freikorps&quot; unit. Also in 1919, a small right-wing political party known as the German Workers&#x27; Party (DAP) was created and seated in Munich. In 1920, it changed its name to the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (Nazi Party; NSDAP). It rejected the terms of the Treaty of Versailles and advocated antisemitism and anti-Bolshevism.

At party meetings in late 1919 and early 1920, hecklers and protesters tried to disrupt Adolf Hitler&#x27;s speeches and fought with party members. It was decided that a permanent group of party members would serve to protect Nazi officials at rallies and disrupt the meetings of opposing parties. The basis for the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (&quot;Storm Detachment&quot;; SA) had been formed. Heiden became an early member of the Nazi Party and the SA. In 1923, Heiden joined a small personal bodyguard unit for Adolf Hitler named &quot;Stoßtrupp-Hitler&quot; (&quot;Shock Troop–Hitler&quot;).

That same year, Hitler felt strong enough to try to seize power in Munich. Inspired by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s &quot;March on Rome&quot; the previous year, the Nazis aimed to first establish power in Munich and then challenge the government in Berlin. On 9 November 1923, the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, along with the SA and several other paramilitary units, took part in the abortive coup d&#x27;état, resulting in the death of sixteen Nazi supporters and four police officers, an event known as the Beer Hall Putsch. After the putsch, Hitler and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison for high treason. The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot;, were officially disbanded.

==Career in the SS==

After Hitler&#x27;s release from prison in December 1924, the Nazi Party was officially refounded. In 1925, Hitler ordered the formation of a new bodyguard unit, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; (&quot;Protection Command; SS&quot;). It was formed by Julius Schreck and included old &quot;Stoßtrupp&quot; members such as Emil Maurice and Heiden. That same year, the &quot;Schutzkommando&quot; was expanded and renamed the &quot;Sturmstaffel&quot; (&quot;Storm Squadron&quot;), and finally the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (&quot;Protection Squadron&quot;; SS). Heiden, described by William Shirer as &quot;a former police stool-pigeon of unsavory reputation&quot;, joined the SS in 1925 and was an early advocate of separating the unit from the SA, its parent organization.

On 1 March 1927, Joseph Berchtold transferred leadership of the SS to Heiden, who was his acting deputy. Berchtold had become disillusioned by the SA&#x27;s authority over the SS. As head of the SS, Heiden also found it difficult to function under the larger and more powerful SA. Under Heiden&#x27;s leadership a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA ranks. Heiden further demanded that the men under his command were not to be involved in party matters which were none of their concern. His intention was to create a small elite unit and obtain higher quality recruits.
Except for the Munich area, the unit was unable to maintain any momentum. The membership of the SS declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SS continued to struggle under the SA. As Heiden attempted to keep the small group from dissolving, Heinrich Himmler became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler had a great enthusiasm and vision for the SS and displayed good organisational abilities which Heiden used. Himmler became the driving force within the SS and in time eclipsed Heiden.

Upon the dismissal of Heiden, Himmler assumed the position of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; with Hitler&#x27;s approval in January 1929. There are differing accounts of the reason for this dismissal. The party merely announced that it was for &quot;family reasons&quot;. It was also suggested at the time that the dismissal was due to Heiden associating with Jews. Starting in 1928, Heiden was co-owner of a clothing supply business that sold uniforms to the SS. Another company in Munich supplied Heiden and his partner with the pants which were used for the SS uniforms. It was discovered that this other company was owned by a Jew. Further, it was alleged that Heiden had been making large profits on the clothing sales to the SS for uniforms. This led to Heiden having to resign as head of the SS. Historian Adrian Weale believes the primary reason for his dismissal was due to him being ineffective in the job. There were also rumors that he was a police informer. Himmler&#x27;s biographer, Peter Longerich, says that beyond the official announcement, &quot;we have no further clues to explain either Heiden&#x27;s dismissal or Himmler&#x27;s appointment&quot;. Under Himmler, the SS greatly expanded over time, with his ultimate aim being the one to turn it into the most powerful organization in Germany.

===Death===
In March 1933, after a visit to his friend Emil Maurice, Heiden was arrested by members of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (&quot;Security Service&quot;; SD) while he was having dinner in the Orlando coffee house in Munich. He was murdered sometime later, presumably by members of the SD. 

Heiden was officially listed as missing on 18 March 1933. On 28 March 1933, Paul Schulz wrote the following about Heiden&#x27;s disappearance:

&quot;Today I find out that some time ago (14 days) the former SS leader Hayden [sic] disappeared. In the evening he was visiting his friend Maurice and went from there to his apartment, which is only a few houses away. On the way he visited a pub nearby, drank his beer and ate alone. After a while, an SA man came and asked to speak to him, asking him to come outside. Since that time he has not returned. After half an hour this SA man came again and fetched Hayden&#x27;s coat and hat. Hayden left without a coat or hat and without paying.&quot;

Shortly after Heiden&#x27;s disappearance, Heiden&#x27;s mother asked his old friend Maurice to look for him. He turned to Josef Gerum for help, who finally went with August Schneidhuber to see Himmler about the disappearance. When Gerum and Schneidhuber asked him about Heiden&#x27;s whereabouts, Himmler, Gerum later claimed, reacted &quot;out of temper&quot; and forbade any interference. According to Schulz, at the end of March an SS-&quot;Sturmfuhrer&quot; told Maurice that if he said another word about the Heiden affair or made any further inquiries into his whereabouts, he was a &quot;goner&quot;. When Maurice raised the incident with Hitler, Hitler recommended that he withdraw from Munich for a while.

Heiden&#x27;s body was discovered months later, on 13 August 1933, in the Neufinsing works canal near Erding (according to the Erding district court) and buried on 15 September. According to Karl Ortner, his body had a gunshot wound to the head. The probable date of death was officially set as 19 March 1933.

<doc id="1298468" wikidata="Q434429" url="?curid=1298468" title="Liezi">
<text>The Liezi () is a Taoist text attributed to Lie Yukou, a c. 5th century BC Hundred Schools of Thought philosopher. Although there were references to Lie&#x27;s &quot;Liezi&quot; from the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, a number of Chinese and Western scholars believe that the content of the current text was compiled around the 4th century CE by Zhang Zhan.

==Textual history==
The first two references to the &quot;Liezi&quot; book are from the former Han dynasty. The editor Liu Xiang notes he eliminated repetitions in &quot;Liezi&quot; and rearranged it into eight chapters (&quot;pian&quot; ). The Book of Han bibliography section () says it has eight chapters () and concludes that since the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; quotes Liezi, he must have lived before Zhuangzi. There is a three-century historical gap until the next evidence of the &quot;Liezi&quot;: the Jin dynasty commentary by Zhang Zhan (fl. ca. 370 CE). Zhang&#x27;s preface claims his &quot;Liezi&quot; copy was transmitted down from his grandfather. All received &quot;Liezi&quot; texts derive from Zhang&#x27;s version, which is divided into eight chapters (&quot;juan&quot; ).

During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the &quot;Liezi&quot; was designated a Daoist classic, completing the trilogy with the more famous &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, it was honorifically entitled the &quot;Chongxu zhenjing&quot; (; &quot;True Classic of Simplicity and Vacuity&quot;, that is, &quot;Classic of the Perfect Emptiness&quot;). This &quot;Simplicity and Vacuity&quot; is Wing-tsit Chan&#x27;s translation; &quot;chongxu&quot; (literally &quot;soar/young/simple empty/skies/modest&quot;) usually means &quot;soar aloft, rise high; carefree, unburdened with ambition&quot;. During the later reign of Emperor Zhenzong of Song, the &quot;Liezi&quot; was further honored as the &quot;Chongxu zhide zhenjing&quot; (; “True Classic of Simplicity and Vacuity and Perfect Virtue”).

==Contents==
The eight &quot;Liezi&quot; chapters are shown below (with translations of titles adapted from ).

Most &quot;Liezi&quot; chapters are named after famous figures in Chinese mythology and history. Either sage rulers like the Yellow Emperor (supposedly r. 2698?–2599? BCE), King Tang of Shang (r. 1617?–1588? BCE), and King Mu of Zhou (r. 1023?–983? BCE); or philosophers like Confucius (551–479 BCE) and Yang Zhu (fl. ca. 350 BCE).

The &quot;Liezi&quot; is generally considered to be the most practical of the major Taoist works, compared to the poetic narrative of Laozi and the philosophical writings of Zhuangzi. Although the &quot;Liezi&quot; has not been extensively published in the West, some passages are well known. For example, Gengsangzi () gives this description of Taoist pure experience:
 My body is in accord with my mind, my mind with my energies, my energies with my spirit, my spirit with Nothing. Whenever the minutest existing thing or the faintest sound affects me, whether it is far away beyond the eight borderlands, or close at hand between my eyebrows and eyelashes, I am bound to know it. However, I do not know whether I perceived it with the seven holes in my head and my four limbs, or knew it through my heart and belly and internal organs. It is simply self-knowledge.
Compare the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; saying, &quot;The Perfect Man uses his mind like a mirror—going after nothing, welcoming nothing, responding but not storing. Therefore he can win out over things and not hurt himself.&quot;

==Authenticity==
&quot;Liezi&quot; scholars have long recognized that it shares many passages with other pre-Han texts like the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;, &quot;Daodejing&quot;, and &quot;Lüshi Chunqiu&quot;. Barrett says opinion is &quot;divided as to whether it is an ancient work with later interpolations or a forgery confected from ancient sources.&quot; On the one hand, the &quot;Liezi&quot; could contain a core of c. 400 BCE authentic writings of Lie Yukou; on the other hand, it could be a c. 400 CE compilation forged by Zhang Zhan.

The &quot;Liezi&quot; is most similar with the &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. They share many characters and stories; Graham lists sixteen complete episodes plus sections from others. The &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; also mentions Liezi in four chapters and Lie Yukou in three, for example, the famous passage about Liezi&#x27;s ability to ride the wind and go flying around in chapter 1.

The final two chapters have heterogeneous contents that differ from the Daoism elsewhere in the book. Chapter 7 records the Yangism philosophy of &quot;Yang Zhu&quot; (Yangzi), infamous for the criticism of Mencius that he, &quot;believed in &#x27;every man for himself.&#x27; If he could have helped the whole world by plucking out a single hair, he would not have done it.&quot; Zhang Zhan speculates that this chapter, focusing on indulgence in physical and temporary pleasures, was from Lie Yukou&#x27;s earlier years in Yangism, before he became a Daoist. The well-known scholar of Chinese philosophy, Wing-Tsit Chan calls the &quot;Yang Zhu&quot; chapter &quot;negative Daoism&quot; in contrast with the Daoism of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Huainanzi that were &quot;all positive in that each represents something new.&quot; Chapter 8, &quot;Explaining Conjunctions,&quot; is primarily taken from other early sources, not only Daoist but Confucian and Mohist texts, two philosophies that opposed the philosophical Daoism this book expounds.

A. C. Graham, Professor Emeritus of the School of Oriental and African Studies, illuminated the textual provenance. After his translation of &quot;Liezi&quot; in 1960, which Barrett calls undoubtedly &quot;the best translation into a Western language to date&quot;, Graham linguistically analyzed internal evidence and textual parallels. He discovered many cases where the &quot;Liezi&quot; is clearly secondary to other texts, but none where it is the primary source for a passage. The Preface to the revised &quot;Liezi&quot; translation explains his significant change in attitude.
Although in 1960 most scholars in China already recognized the late date of &quot;[Liezi]&quot;, most Westerners were still disinclined to question its antiquity. My own textual studies, not yet completed when this translation first appeared, supported the Chinese dating, which by now prevails also in the West. … One result of the textual investigation came as a surprise to me. The present book describes the hedonist &#x27;Yang [Zhu]&#x27; chapter as &#x27;so unlike the rest of [&quot;Liezi&quot;] that it must be from another hand … The thought is certainly very different, and it does show the signs of editing and interpolation by the Taoist author … But although close scrutiny generally reveals marked differences in style between the body of the book and passages borrowed from earlier sources, I could find none to distinguish the hedonist chapter from the rest.

Owing to occasional &quot;Liezi&quot; textual misunderstandings in Zhang Zhan&#x27;s commentary, Graham concludes that the &quot;guiding hand&quot; probably belonged to Zhang&#x27;s father or grandfather, which would mean c. 300 CE.

Suggestions of Buddhist influences in &quot;Liezi&quot; chapters 3 and 6 are potentially corroborating evidence for a late date of composition; see Buddhism in China. &quot;King Mu of Zhou&quot; discusses sense perceptions as illusions; &quot;Endeavor and Destiny&quot; takes a fatalistic (if not karmic) view of destiny, which goes against the traditional Daoist concept of &quot;Wuwei&quot;.

==Influence==
&quot;Liezi&quot; is known as one of the three most important texts in Taoism, together with the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and &quot;Zhuangzi&quot;. Outside of Taoism, the biji genre story &quot;Yi Jian Zhi&quot; by Hong Mai borrowed the character of Yi Jian, a contemporary of the ancient mythical emperor Yu, from &quot;Liezi&quot;.

==Translations==
There are fewer English translations of the &quot;Liezi&quot; than other Taoist texts. The first were partial versions; Lionel Giles (1912) translated chapters 1–6 and 8, while Anton Forke (1912) covered chapter 7 (&quot;Yang Zhu&quot;). As mentioned above, A. C. Graham (1960, 1990) wrote a definitive scholarly translation. A recent &quot;Liezi&quot; rendition is a creative translation by Eva Wong (2001). In 2005, the Library of Chinese Classics published a translation by Liang Xiaopeng. In 2011, Thomas Cleary self-published a translation titled &quot;The Book of Master Lie&quot;, available in Amazon Kindle format.

<text>Bhil or Bheel refer to the various indigenous groups inhabiting western India, including parts of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh and are also found in distant places such as Bengal and Tripura. They speak various dialects of regional Indo-Aryan languages, collectively referred to as the Bhil languages, while the indigenous non-Indo-Aryan language that the Bhil originally spoke is lost. Bhils are divided into a number of endogamous territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages.

Bhils are listed as tribal people in the states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Rajasthan—all in the western Deccan regions and central India—as well as in Bengal and Tripura in far-eastern India, on the border with Bangladesh. Many Bhils now speak the dominant later language of the region they reside in, such as Marathi, Gujarati, Bengali or a Bhili language dialect.

==Etymology==
Some scholars suggest that the term Bhil is derived from the word &quot;billa&quot; or &quot;billu&quot; which means bow in the Dravidian lexis. The term Bhil is used to refer to &quot;various ethnic communities&quot; living in the forests and hills of Rajasthan&#x27;s southern parts and surrounding regions of western India, highlighting the &quot;popularity of the bow and arrow as a weapon among these groups&quot;. It is also used as a blanket term to refer to the aboriginal peoples of these areas.

==History ==
According to John Samuel, as per legendary and historical records, the Bhil tribals controlled large parts of Gujarat from 11th to 15th century before the Rajputs conquered the territories from these locals.

=== Bhil Rebellion ===

The Bhils of what is now the state of Gujarat rebelled on several occasions during the British colonial era, notably in 1846, 1857–58 and 1868.

Along with a number of other Indian social groups, the Bhils were designated as a criminal tribe by the British colonial government under the Criminal Tribes Act 1871, which meant that a Bhil could be &quot;randomly picked up, tortured, maimed or even killed&quot; by the colonial authorities. Susan Abraham notes that many of the tribes characterised as criminal under the Act had earlier rebelled against the East India Company and participated in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. She claims that the British colonial government legislated the Act in 1871 in the wake of these autochthonic tribes&#x27; proclivity for rebellion.

===Mutiny against Mewar State===

According to Ram Pande, in 1881, the Bhils protested against &quot;the census classification, prohibition on alcohol manufacture, establishment of police and customs, and the ban on the killing of witches&quot;. Their campaigning was stepped up and given meaning by Govind Guru who was a social and political leader. Pande suggests that because of his long-term Brahminical Hinduism missionary work among the tribe, Govind was able to stop them consuming meat and alcohol, and to pressurise the state for the formation of village councils which could administer their own affairs and for barring forced labour. In 1917, Mewar State&#x27;s Girasias joined the Bhils in the struggle to get the petty taxes and forced labour quashed, and to get the land revenues decreased. Taking note of these protests, the &quot;jagirdars&quot; of Mewar had called on a British political agent to suppress the mutiny. Pande noted that 1,500 Bhils got shot in 1913. In 1921, the tribals and peasants united under the leadership of Motilal Tejawat in the struggle against &quot;forced labour, petty taxes, the disparity in taxes, high taxes and the tyrannical ways of the &quot;jagirdars&quot;&quot;. Tejawat&#x27;s thoughts drew followers from the Bhils and Girasias of the Danta, Idar, Palanpur and Sirohi regions of Gujarat; and he &quot;became a notorious offender against the state&quot;.

== Demographics ==
The Bhils are inhabitants of Dhar, Jhabua, Khargone and Ratlam districts of Madhya Pradesh. Bhilai (Bhil= Tribe, Aai= Came, meaning Bhils came), a city in Durg district of Chhattisgarh is named after this. A large number of Bhils live in the neighbouring states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan. In Bengal, the Bauris represent the Bhil tribe. They constitute the largest tribe of India. According to Victoria R. Williams, the Bhils are India&#x27;s &quot;most widely dispersed tribal group&quot;. A small population of Bhils also resides in Pakistan&#x27;s Sindh province, who are known as the Sindhi Bhils.

== Present circumstances ==
The Bhil are classified as a Scheduled Tribe in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Tripura under the Indian government&#x27;s reservation program of positive discrimination.

== Subdivisions ==
The Bhil are divided into a number of endogamous territorial divisions, which in turn have a number of clans and lineages. In Rajasthan, they exist as Bhil Garasia, Dholi Bhil, Dungri Bhil, Dungri Garasia, Mewasi Bhil, Barda, Patelia, Warli, Bagdi, Dhodia, Bhillava or Billava, Barela, Khotil, Dangchai, Dangehi, Nirdhi Bhil, Gamit, Rawal Bhil, Tadvi Bhil, Bhagalia, Bauris, Bhilala, Rathwa, Pawra, Barda, Warli, Nayak, Nahals, Mathvadi, Dorepis, Dhanka, Vasava and Vasave.

== Language ==

The language commonly spoken by Bhils throughout their geographic distribution is Bhili. Bhili has about up to 36 identified dialects and pronunciation differs by region. Bhili is based on Gujarati, but dialects of Bhili gradually merge into more widely spoken languages such as Marathi in the southeast and Rajasthani in the northwest. Around 10 million people recorded themselves as speaking a Bhili dialect in the census.

Estimates of individuals speaking the language are often inaccurate as speakers of minor languages like Bhili have sometimes been treated as having major languages (such as Marathi or Gujarati) as their mother tongue.

The Bhils in Sindh speak Sindhi Bhili and Dhatki.

== Culture and Traditions ==
Bhils have a rich and unique culture. The Bhilala sub-division is known for its Pithora painting. Ghoomar is a traditional folk dance of the Bhil tribe. Ghoomar is the symbol of womanhood. Young girls take part in this dance and declare that they are stepping into the shoes of women.

=== Art ===

Bhil painting is characterised by the use of multi-coloured dots as in-filling. Bhuri Bai was the first Bhil artist to paint using readymade colours and paper. Other known Bhil artists include Lado Bai, Sher Singh, Ram Singh and Dubu Bariya.

=== Food ===
Main foods of Bhils are maize, onion, garlic and chili which they cultivate in their small fields. They collect fruits and vegetables from the local forests. Wheat and rice are used at time of festivals and other special occasions only. They keep self-made bows and arrows, swords, knives, axes etc. with them as weapons for self-defense and hunting the wild fauna which also form the major part of their diet. They profusely use alcohol distilled by them from the flower of Mahua (Madhuca longifolia). On festive occasions, various special preparation from the dish rich, i.e. maize, wheat, barley, malt and rice. Bhils are traditionally non-vegetarian.

The traditional dresses of men are the Pagri, Angarkha, Dhoti and Gamchha. Traditionally women wear Sari and Ghagra Choli.
There are many traditional ornaments of Bhils. Men wear Kada, Bajuband, Chain, ear rings, Kardhani. Women wear variety of ornaments such as hansli (ring) Zele-zumke, earring in Bhil language, narniyan (bangle), nathni (nose-jewel) etc. Tattooing is traditional custom among them. Women folks do tattooing generally before marriage.

===Faith and worship===
Every village has its own local deity (Gramdev) and families too have their Jatidev, Kuldev and Kuldevi (house hold deity) which is symbolised by stones. &#x27;Bhati dev&#x27; and &#x27;Bhilat dev&#x27; are their serpent-god. &#x27;Baba dev&#x27; is their village god. Karkulia dev is their crop god, Gopal dev is their pastoral god, Bag dev is their Lion god, Bhairav dev is their dog god. Some of their other gods are Indel dev, Bada dev, Mahadevel, Tejaji, Lotha mai, Techma, Orka Chichma and Kajal dev.

They have extreme and staunch faith in superstitious beliefs and Bhopas for their physical, mental and psychological treatments.

According to Victoria R. Williams, the Bhils &quot;identify largely as Hindu&quot;. The Dang Bhils follow Christianity, and the Nirdhi and Tadivi Bhils follow Islam. A number of other Bhils follow Sonatan (Sanskrit: Sanatan) which is their &quot;own religion&quot;. Williams states that Sonatan &quot;blends Hindu beliefs and animistic philosophies&quot;.

===Festivals===
There are a number of festivals, viz. Rakhi, Navratri, Dashera, Diwali, Holi which are 
celebrated by the Bhils. They also celebrate some traditional festivals viz. Akhatij, Navmi, Howan Mata ki Chalavani, Sawan Mata ki jatar, Diwasa, Nawai, Bhagoria, Gal, Gar, Dhobi, Sanja, Indel, Doha etc. with ceremonious zeal and enthusiasm.

During some festivals there are a number of tribal fairs held at different places of districts. Navratri mela, Bhagoria mela (during Holi festival) etc. Bhil community of Udaipur celebrate Gavari festival each year after Holi.

=== Types of Dance and Festivities===

The chief means of their recreation is folk songs and dances. Women dance at birth celebrations, marriage functions and on a few festivals in traditional Bhili style accompanied by a drum beat. Their dances include the Lathi (staff) dance, Dhol dance, marriage dance, Holi dance, Battle dance, Bhagoria dance, Deepawal dance, Sajoni dance and hunting dance. Musical instruments include the Harmonium, Sarangi, Kundi, Bansuri, Apang, Khajria, Tabla, Jhanjh, Mandal and Thali. They are usually made from local products.

=== Local political structure ===
Traditional each Bhil village is led by a headman (&quot;Gameti&quot;). The &quot;gameti&quot; has authority and decision-making powers over most local disputes or issues.

==Bhil Pradesh Demand==
There has been a demand for the establishment of a separate state of Bhil Pradesh by combining the tribal-dominated parts of Gujarat and neighbouring states Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra. In 2014, when the Telangana state was formed, it reignited hopes of statehood again. In 2023, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA leader Chaitar Vasava raised demand for separate state of Bhil Pradesh.

<text>Tanith Jessica Louise Belbin White (born July 11, 1984) is a Canadian American ice dancer and Olympic program host for NBC Sports. Though born in Canada, she holds dual citizenship and has competed for the United States since she began skating with Benjamin Agosto in 1998. With Agosto, Belbin is the 2006 Olympic silver medalist, four-time World medalist, three-time Four Continents champion (2004–2006), and five-time U.S. champion (2004–2008).

==Personal life==
Tanith Belbin was born in Kingston, Ontario, and raised in Kirkland, Quebec. In 1998, she moved to the Detroit area in the United States and received an immigrant worker visa in 2000. Due to immigration rules at the time, she did not receive a green card until July 2002 and would not have been granted U.S. citizenship until 2007. An amendment was passed which allowed Belbin to be sworn in as an American citizen on December 31, 2005. The amendment was authored by Senator Carl Levin who stated, &quot;This amendment corrects an anomaly in the law that unfairly disadvantaged some people who had begun their naturalization process before 2002. Tanith Belbin began her naturalization process in 2000, but due to changes that were made to the law in 2002, the process has taken significantly longer than it would have if she had filed her paperwork 2 years later.&quot;

Belbin lived and trained in Canton, Michigan, for many years, before moving to Aston, Pennsylvania. After 2010, Belbin decided to move back to Michigan to attend Eastern Michigan University and be closer to friends and family, including then-boyfriend Charlie White. Belbin and White became engaged in June 2014 and were married on April 25, 2015. In 2017, their son was born.

Her father, Charles Belbin, is a public relations manager, while her mother, Michelle (née McKinlay) Belbin, is a former figure skater (who trained in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland under Rolf Adomeit), coach, and costume designer. Michelle made some of Tanith&#x27;s costumes.

== Career ==
Tanith Belbin began skating when she was almost three and started ice dancing at about eight or nine. She competed both as a pair skater and ice dancer in Canada before deciding to concentrate completely on ice dancing. She was introduced to ice dancing by Paul Wirtz and competed with partner Liam Dougherty. Her pairs partner was Ben Barruco, with whom she placed second at the novice level at the 1997 Canadian Championships. She did not compete with either partner internationally.

=== Partnership with Agosto ===
After a year without a partner in Canada, Belbin moved to Detroit in 1998, where she was partnered with Benjamin Agosto by their coach Igor Shpilband. In the 1999–2000 season, they won a pair of medals on the ISU Junior Grand Prix series and finished 4th at the JGP Final. They went on to win the U.S. junior national title and then took the bronze medal at the 2000 World Junior Championships. In 2000–2001, Belbin / Agosto competed again on the JGP series, taking gold in all three of their events including the Final. They appeared on the senior level at the 2001 U.S. Championships and won the silver medal, qualifying them for their first senior World Championships, where they finished 17th.

In 2001–2002, Belbin / Agosto made their senior Grand Prix debut and won another silver medal at the U.S. Championships, which would have qualified them for the 2002 Winter Olympics if Belbin had been an American citizen. Instead, Belbin and Agosto were sent to all the other ISU Championships for which they were eligible: Four Continents, Junior Worlds, and Worlds. They won the 2002 World Junior Championships, completing their set of medals from that event. Following that season, Agosto aged out of juniors.

Belbin / Agosto won the 2004 U.S. national title and would go on to repeat four times. At Nationals in 2005, the last year of the 6.0 system, Belbin / Agosto received straight perfect sixes for presentation in their free dance. Of the 30 6.0s given out in ice dance at U.S. Nationals, Belbin / Agosto have 14 of them. Their total 6.0 count at the U.S. Championships is second only to Michelle Kwan (38).

Belbin / Agosto won the silver medal at the 2005 World Championships.

Fans of Belbin / Agosto wrote letters and signed petitions asking for a special act of Congress to allow Belbin to become a citizen in time for her to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics, where many believed they could win a medal. In addition, it was Belbin / Agosto who earned a third spot for the U.S. in the Olympic ice dancing event, by winning a medal at the 2005 World Championships, without which the U.S. would have had only two spots. However, the mother of fellow American ice dancer David Mitchell sent a letter to Senator Hillary Clinton, asking her to vote against it. She believed that it was unfair to bend the requirements for U.S. citizenship for Belbin, when other &quot;aliens of extraordinary ability&quot; were denied expedited citizenship. Ultimately, by a special act of Congress sponsored by Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) that passed on December 28, 2005, which President George W. Bush signed on December 31, 2005, Belbin became a naturalized citizen, allowing her to compete for the United States at the 2006 Winter Olympics.

In January 2006, Belbin / Agosto won their third consecutive national title and qualified for the Olympics. At the Turin Olympics, Belbin and Agosto won the silver medal in ice dancing, the first American ice dancers to win an Olympic medal in 30 years. They went on to win the bronze at Worlds.

Belbin / Agosto began the 2006–2007 season with a free dance called That&#x27;s Entertainment but arrived at Nationals with a new program to the music of Amelie. They won gold at Nationals, the silver medal at Four Continents, and the bronze at Worlds.

In 2007–2008, they won gold medals at both Skate America and Cup of China which qualified them for the Grand Prix Final, where they took the silver medal. They won their 5th national title and then placed 4th at the 2008 Worlds after a fall by Belbin in the compulsory dance. Belbin / Agosto were regular cast members of the Champions on Ice tour from 2004 until COI went out of business following the 2007 season. They were guest stars on part of the 2008 Stars on Ice tour.

In April 2008, Belbin / Agosto left Igor Shpilband, who had coached them for their entire partnership, and began working with the married coaching team of Natalia Linichuk and Gennadi Karponosov at the IceWorks Skating Complex in Aston, Pennsylvania. In addition to teaching different technique, Linichuk advised Belbin to gain 10 pounds and develop some muscles in order to skate faster and more fluidly. This also gave Belbin more core strength to hold her positions better, thus making lifts easier for Agosto.

Belbin / Agosto began the 2008–2009 season at the 2008 Skate America and 2008 Cup of China, winning silver at both competitions. They withdrew from the 2008–2009 ISU Grand Prix Final after the original dance due to a back injury to Agosto. They withdrew from the 2009 U.S. Championships before the event began due to Agosto&#x27;s injury. They were named to the team to the 2009 World Championships. At Worlds, they won the original dance and placed second in the compulsory and free dances to win the silver medal overall.

Belbin / Agosto won both their Grand Prix events in the 2009–10 season: the 2009 Cup of China and the 2009 Skate America. They withdrew from the Grand Prix Final for medical reasons. At the 2010 U.S. Championships, they were unable to reclaim their national title, finishing second behind Meryl Davis and Charlie White. Belbin and Agosto were nominated to represent the United States at the 2010 Winter Olympics. They finished 4th in the Olympic ice dancing event. They did not compete at the 2010 World Championships.

On June 10, 2010, Belbin / Agosto announced their retirement from eligible skating. They have continued to skate together in ice shows.

On December 15, 2015, U.S. Figure Skating announced Belbin and Agosto would be members of the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame Class of 2016. The induction ceremony was held on January 22, 2016 at the 2016 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.

===Post-competitive career===
Belbin has worked as a commentator for ice dance competitions on Universal Sports Network, the ABC show &quot;Skating with the Stars&quot;, and for icenetwork.com. She has also worked as a commentator for four seasons of Curling Night in America, a NBCSN program that broadcasts a made-for-television curling competition.

In October 2011 Belbin competed as a pro on season 3 of &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot; paired with Boyd Devereaux; the pair placed 3rd in the competition.

Belbin also works as a choreographer.

=== Coaching career ===
In 2022, Belbin opened the Michigan Ice Dance Academy with Charlie White and Greg Zuerlein.
Their current teams include:

* Emily Bratti / Ian Somerville
* Molly Cesanek / Yehor Yehorov
* Caroline Green / Michael Parsons

<text>Pat Martino (born Patrick Carmen Azzara; August 25, 1944 – November 1, 2021) was an American jazz guitarist and composer. He has been cited as one of the greatest guitarists in jazz.

==Early life==
Martino was born Patrick Carmen Azzara in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States, to father Carmen &quot;Mickey&quot; Azzara (d. 1990) and mother Jean (née Orlando, d. 1989). He was first exposed to jazz by his father, who sang in local clubs and briefly studied guitar. 

== Career ==
Martino studied with renowned jazz teacher Dennis Sandole, and in his studio met other of Sandole&#x27;s students; among them, John Coltrane, James Moody, McCoy Tyner and others. Martino began playing professionally at the age of 15 after moving to New York City. He lived for a period with Les Paul and began playing at jazz clubs such as Smalls Paradise. He later moved into a suite in the President Hotel on 48th Street. He played at Smalls for six months of the year, and played summers at the Club Harlem in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
Martino played and recorded early in his career with Lloyd Price, Willis Jackson, and Eric Kloss. He also worked with jazz organists Charles Earland, Richard &quot;Groove&quot; Holmes, Jack McDuff, Don Patterson, Trudy Pitts, Jimmy Smith, Gene Ludwig, Ray Allen (Raymond Chenot) and Joey DeFrancesco.
In 1980, Martino suffered a hemorrhaged arteriovenous malformation that caused a &quot;near-fatal seizure&quot;. The resulting surgery, which removed part of his brain, left him with amnesia and no recollection or knowledge of his career or how to play the instrument that made him successful. He said he came out of surgery with complete forgetfulness, and had to learn to focus on the present rather than the past or the possible future. He had to completely re-learn how to play.

He was subsequently chosen as Guitar Player of the Year in the &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine Readers&#x27; Poll of 2004. In 2006, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab reissued his album &quot;East!&quot; on Ultradisc UHR SACD.

In 2017, he created a series of educational videos, &quot;A Study of the Opposites and How They Manifest on the Guitar&quot;.

==Musical style==
Martino&#x27;s influences were Les Paul, Johnny Smith, Hank Garland, Joe Pass, and especially Wes Montgomery. To a lesser extent, he was influenced by the guitar stylings of Jim Hall, Mundell Lowe and Barry Galbraith.

Martino said, &quot;There are elements within an instrument’s architecture that initiate a continuous source of valuable information. For the guitar, there are two. The first is the major third interval, and the second is the minor third interval. Once we view their repetitive information, they begin to appear as a series of automatic functions.&quot;

Martino&#x27;s lines contain chromatic links outside any particular IIm7 chord that might be conceptualized over a chord progression, even in the examples he provides in his books and instructional videos. On his bulletin board he has stated that he formulated the system more as a way to explain his playing rather than as something to use to create music. In his own words, &quot;Although the analysis of some of my recorded solos have been referred to as modal, personally I&#x27;ve never operated in that way. I&#x27;ve always depended upon my own melodic instinct, instead of scale-like formulas.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Jazz music educator Wolf Marshall said Martino is &quot;a living legend, a national treasure, and an inspiration to musicians and music lovers of all stripes&quot;.

==Personal life==
Martino was married to Ayako Asahi Martino; they met in Tokyo, Japan in 1995. Due to a chronic respiratory disorder, he stopped performing in 2018. He died on November 1, 2021, at the age of 77.
