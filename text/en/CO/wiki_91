<text>Greenwood is a subway station on the Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at the southwest corner of Linnsmore Crescent and Strathmore Boulevard just north of Danforth Avenue.

The entrance, collector&#x27;s booth and bus bays are at street level, with stairs and escalators to a lower concourse level which provides a passage between the platforms on the level below. The station building has two bus bays, and its bus terminal is located outside the fare-paid area. Single escalators operate in an up direction at all times.

Greenwood opened in 1966 as part of the original segment of the Bloor–Danforth line. It is one block east of Greenwood Avenue, the closest major intersection, after which it is named.

==Station access upgrades==
Construction to make the station&#x27;s main entrance wheelchair accessible by adding two elevators had begun by the fourth quarter of 2021. One elevator will link the street level to the concourse level and the eastbound platform; the other elevator will link the concourse and the westbound platform. Construction is expected to be completed by mid-2025.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==
Between Donlands and Greenwood stations is a full, grade-separated, double-track, underground wye junction, allowing trains from either direction to enter and exit Greenwood Subway Yard via the &quot;Greenwood Portal&quot;. The yard is located at ground level on the west side of Greenwood Avenue, south of Danforth Avenue and north of Gerrard Street East.

==Nearby landmarks==
Nearby landmarks include St. Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Secondary School, Monarch Park Collegiate Institute and Danforth Collegiate and Technical Institute.

==Surface connections==

The station&#x27;s bus platform is not within the fare-paid area. Bus routes serving the station include:
==Second exit==

In July 2010 the TTC announced plans to add second exits to two subway stations on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. These exits were recommended after a fire safety audit due to the stations only having one primary means of emergency access and egress.

The planned construction would see a new exit-only structure built at surface level on Strathmore Boulevard. In order to build the exits, the TTC planned to expropriate residential land and demolish a home in the area. This decision proved to be controversial in the affected neighbourhoods and after some public outcry the TTC stated that they would review their plans.

The TTC accepted the City Ombudsman&#x27;s report that these projects were not handled well by staff on two counts: community outreach, consultation and explanations about the technical and engineering decisions made by staff; and how the TTC communicated with residents whose properties were most affected.

After consultation, the community was largely supportive of recommended new location. Second exit construction was scheduled to begin in 2017 and was to be combined with elevator installation to minimize impact on passengers and the community. The TTC promised to engage the community well before proceeding with these projects.

A local working group made up of community volunteers met to discuss the potential location throughout 2017 and 2018 and selected 1416 Danforth Avenue as the community&#x27;s recommended location for a second exit. As of March 2021, this recommendation is under consideration by the city and the TTC; the construction timeline for the elevators and second exit project has not yet been announced.

<text>Coxwell is a subway station on the Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station is located on Strathmore Boulevard just east of Coxwell Avenue and one block north of Danforth Avenue. It opened in 1966 as part of the original segment of the Bloor–Danforth line. Automatic sliding doors, accessible fare gates and the addition of elevators made the station fully accessible in late December 2017.

==Description==
The entrance, collector&#x27;s booth, fare gates, and bus bays are at street level, the concourse is on the second level, and the subway platforms are on the lower level. Stairs connect all levels with escalators only operating up at all times. The station building has four bus bays. 

This station is used as a switchover point for subway operators changing their shift, regularly causing a slight delay while the crew is changed in either direction. Station collectors and subway operators use office space at the Danforth Garage, which is located on the south side of Danforth Avenue near the station.

The station underwent renovations to add elevators from the street to both subway platforms, automatic sliding doors, accessible fare gates, and improved signage, which made it fully accessible by 2017. This is part of a system-wide program that will retrofit all stations by 2030.

On December 22, 2016, this station and Leslie were the last subway stations to be equipped with Presto card readers.
In October 2016, the Coxwell Laneway Mosaic Mural was unveiled by dignitaries, including TTC Chair Josh Colle, who said, &quot;At the TTC, public art not only beautifies our properties, but it&#x27;s become a catalyst for station improvement projects.&quot; The mural is mounted on the outside of the barrier separating the Coxwell Station bus loop from a pedestrian walkway on the east and a parking lot on the south. The work is divided in two sections, representing past and future. It was created by a local group led by artist Cristina Delago.
Installed in 2018, the artwork &quot;Forwards and Backwards&quot; by Jennifer Davis and Jon Sasaki is displayed on the station concourse level, giving the effect of a funhouse mirror. Davis describes the work as &quot;a three-dimensional sculpted curtain, cast in polished reflective aluminum, a material widely used in the TTC&#x27;s rolling stock and infrastructure&quot;. The &quot;sculpted curtain&quot; is intended as a tribute to the TTC&#x27;s &quot;behind-the-curtain&quot; employees.

A laneway connects the station to Danforth and runs by the former Hollinger Bus Lines terminal, which is now a restaurant.

==Ridership==
The ridership at Coxwell station has been relatively stable since 2007, with a peak ridership of 17,900 in 2008 and the lowest ridership in 2015 with 15,260 riders.

<doc id="1305835" wikidata="Q407806" url="?curid=1305835" title="Sodium sulfite">
<text>Sodium sulfite (sodium sulphite) is the inorganic compound with the chemical formula Na2SO3. A white, water-soluble solid, it is used commercially as an antioxidant and preservative. It is also suitable for the softening of lignin in the pulping and refining processes of wood and lignocellulosic materials. A heptahydrate is also known but it is less useful because of its greater susceptibility toward oxidation by air.

==Preparation==

Sodium sulfite can be prepared by treating a solution of sodium hydroxide with sulfur dioxide. When conducted in warm water, Na2SO3 initially precipitates as a white solid. With more SO2, the solid dissolves to give the disulfite, which crystallizes upon cooling. 

Sodium sulfite is made industrially by treating sulfur dioxide with a solution of sodium carbonate. The overall reaction is:

==Uses==
Sodium sulfite is primarily used in the pulp and paper industry. It has been also applied in the thermomechanical conversion of wood to fibres (&quot;defibration&quot;) for producing medium density fibreboards (MDF).

As an oxygen scavenger agent, it is used to treat water being fed to steam boilers to avoid corrosion problems, in the photographic industry, it protects developer solutions from oxidation and (as hypo clear solution) to wash fixer (sodium thiosulfate) from film and photo-paper emulsions.

As a reducing agent it is used in the textile industry as a bleaching, desulfurizing, and dechlorinating agent (e.g. in swimming pools). Its reducing properties are exploited in its use as a preservative to prevent dried fruit from discoloring, and for preserving meats.

It is used as a reagent in sulfonation and sulfomethylation agent. It is used in the production of sodium thiosulfate.

The Wellman–Lord process utilizes sodium sulfite for flue gas desulfurization.

==Reactions==

Sodium sulfite is primarily used as a mild reducing agent. The heptahydrate crystals effloresce in warm dry air. Heptahydrate crystals also oxidize in air to form sodium sulfate. The anhydrous form is more resistant to oxidation by air.

Sodium bisulfite, NaHSO3, is mixture of salts that dissolve in water to give solutions composed of sodium and bisulfite ions.

==Structure==
According to X-ray crystallography sodium sulfite heptahydrate features pyramidal SO32- centers. The S-O distances are 1.50 and the O-S-O angles are near 106º.

<doc id="1305836" wikidata="Q1042190" url="?curid=1305836" title="Woodbine station">
<text>Woodbine is a subway station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The station is at the southeast corner of Woodbine Avenue and Strathmore Boulevard, just north of Danforth Avenue.

==Description==

The main entrance, collector, and bus platform are at street level (on the northeast corner of Woodbine and Danforth), the concourse is on the second level, and the subway platforms are on the lower level. The bus platform has 2 bus bays. Wi-Fi service is available at this station. Automatic sliding doors, accessible fare gates and the addition of elevators, made the station fully accessible in late September 2017 which also coincided with the opening of a new secondary automated entrance on the northwest corner of Woodbine and Danforth.
The artwork titled &quot;Directions Intersections Connections&quot; by Marmin Borins hangs on the exterior wall at the station&#x27;s bus platform. Covering , the artwork consists of brightly-coloured coated metal panels arranged in geometric patterns. According to the TTC&#x27;s Public Art page, the geometric patterns &quot;express the motion and directional routes of transit, the intersections of communities and place, and the connections of site to both the present and the past&quot;.

== History ==
Woodbine station was opened in 1966 as the eastern terminus of the original Bloor–Danforth line. Although the station was a terminus for two years, it was known that this would be temporary, so it was built with side platforms rather than a single centre platform that would have conveniently served departures from either track.

The Bloor–Danforth subway line replaced the Bloor streetcar line, which ran from Jane Loop to Luttrell Loop, near the present Jane and Victoria Park stations. With the opening of the subway from to Woodbine in 1966, streetcar service was reduced to a short Bloor route from Jane Loop to Keele station, and a Danforth route from Woodbine station to Luttrell Loop. These portions were in turn eliminated when the subway was extended in 1968 to run from to . However, evidence of the temporary loop at Woodbine station for Danforth streetcars still exists: a single disconnected streetcar track runs west from Cedarvale Avenue along Strathmore Boulevard, curving towards the east end of the station, and an irregular wall in the station&#x27;s mezzanine indicates the former passage to the streetcar platform. The walled-off section of this passage has been partially converted into a staff room and storage area.

==Automatic entrance==
In June 2010, the TTC announced plans to add secondary entrances and exits to 3 subway stations on Line 2. They were recommended after a fire safety audit due to the stations only having one primary means of emergency access and egress. The plan was to construct a new unmanned automated entrance at surface level on Strathmore Boulevard. In order to build these new access points, the TTC expropriated residential land and demolished a home on the northwest corner of Woodbine and Strathmore. The decision to do so proved controversial in the neighbourhoods affected; although the TTC stated it would review their plan, it ultimately went ahead. Construction of the new unstaffed automated entrance was completed in September 2017. It is accessible to Presto card holders only.

<doc id="1305838" wikidata="Q1042144" url="?curid=1305838" title="Main Street station (Toronto)">
<text>Main Street is a station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is located on the east side of Main Street a short distance north of Danforth Avenue. Connections to GO Transit&#x27;s commuter train service on the Lakeshore East line can be made at Danforth GO Station, approximately 300 metres to the south on the east side of Main Street.

==Description==

The TTC station is roughly rectangular in shape and has 3 levels: street level, concourse level and platform level. The bus bays, streetcar platform and fare gates are located at street level. There are 5 bus bays on the north and east sides of the station building. The south side of the building is occupied by a single, long streetcar platform on the inside of a clockwise streetcar loop encircling the building that serves as the eastern terminus of the 506 Carlton streetcar (306 Carlton at night).The bus bays and streetcar platform are behind the fare gates inside the fare-paid area. A set of 2 opposing stairwells lead down to the concourse level, where a single up-only escalator leads back to street level. The concourse level is home to a Gateway Newsstand. From the concourse, 2 more sets of opposing stairwells on the north and south sides of the concourse level lead down to the platforms, with up-only escalators connecting both platforms to the concourse. 

This station became wheelchair accessible in 2004. One elevator near the southeast corner of the station building provides access from street level to the concourse level of the eastbound subway platform; a second elevator in the northwest corner provides a connection between the concourse level and the westbound subway platform. To facilitate accessibility, automatic sliding doors were added at the street entrance and on the north side of the station building to access the bus bays, along with an accessible fare gate and improved signage. A space is reserved for Wheel-Trans vehicles.

== History ==
Main Street station opened on May 10, 1968, as part of the first round of extensions to Line 2, which had opened 2 years earlier between Keele and Woodbine. Line 2 opened between Warden and Islington in 1968, with 1-stop extensions to Kennedy and Kipling opening in 1980. Main Street station was built on the site of the former Main streetcar loop that opened on May 15, 1955, as the eastern terminus of the Carlton streetcar line (today route 506 Carlton). Main Loop was built to relieve congestion at Luttrell Loop, which had been the previous terminus of the Carlton streetcar since 1923. Between April 25 and June 13, 1966, the 1955 loop was closed to build a new streetcar loop for Main Street subway station. During construction, Carlton streetcars temporarily returned to Luttrell Loop. Carlton streetcars started using the new station loop in 1966, before the subway platforms at the station were open to the public in 1968.

Unlike most TTC stations, its name includes the word &quot;Street&quot; in order to avoid the possible misreading that it is the subway&#x27;s &quot;main&quot; station. It is named after Main Street, which was the main street of the suburban town of East Toronto, which was amalgamated into Toronto in 1908.

The station was initially built with its turnstiles and collector booths on the concourse level between the bus and streetcar terminal and the subway platforms, because until 1973, some of the buses serving the station crossed the fare zone boundary between Toronto and the then-city of Scarborough. When the fare zone system was abolished in 1973, the fare gates were moved upstairs to street level, to bring the bus bays and streetcar platform into the fare-paid area. Because of this, Main Street station has a larger concourse compared to many other subway stations on Line 2, particularly those directly to the east which were built as part of the original section of Line 2 opened in 1966. 

Main–Danforth has been identified by Metrolinx as a transportation mobility hub as it is located at the interchange of two or more current or planned regional rapid transit lines. As a result, Main Street was the first subway station to be outfitted with new accessible paddle-style Presto fare gates, which replaced the existing tripod turnstiles system-wide and are used with Presto cards across the subway system. 

Danforth GO Station is a station on the Lakeshore East Line, located approximately south of the station along Main Street. The station has also sporadically served trains on the Stouffville Line. The 2 stations are within walking distance of each other and an accessible ramp exists at Danforth GO, but the path follows Main Street on the sidewalk for most of its distance and is exposed to the elements.

The TTC closed the bus and streetcar loop at Main Street station between May 7, 2023, and September 2023 for infrastructure upgrades. The work included concrete and asphalt pavement rehabilitation within the bus loop, concrete bus platform rehabilitation including the installation of tactile walking surface indicator, and fencing replacement throughout the loop. Construction activities were set to continue until the end of November 2023.

== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==
East of the station the tracks angle north away from Danforth Avenue and emerge to run on the surface at the &quot;Tyra Portal&quot; in Dentonia Park, just west of Victoria Park station. To the west the subway tunnel was mostly constructed by cut-and-cover along Harris Avenue from Woodbine station.

<text>Victoria Park is a station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth of the Toronto subway system. It is located at 777 Victoria Park Avenue, one block north of Danforth Avenue in Scarborough. The station can be accessed by pedestrians directly from Victoria Park Avenue; by way of an unmanned entrance from Albion Avenue; through an automated entrance from Teesdale Place; and via a walkway that leads to the nearby Crescent Town area. A City of Toronto bicycle station is located adjacent to the main Victoria Park Avenue entrance, providing a paid secure indoor bicycle parking area.

==History== 

Victoria Park station was opened in 1968 in the Borough of Scarborough, but the access footbridge across Victoria Park Avenue, built in the 1970s, extended into the Borough of East York.

Until 1973, the buses and the subway trains serving the station were in separate fare zones, and so the turnstiles and collector booths were placed between the bus bays and the subway platforms. When the zones were abolished, the layout was reconfigured to bring the buses inside the station&#x27;s fare-paid area.

The station underwent a large-scale, $36million renovation between 2008–2011. The original bus terminal with indoor platforms was demolished and replaced with a new, accessible outdoor bus terminal. New station entrances were built, an indoor bicycle station for parking was opened, and a green roof was added. Interior and exterior finishes were updated, and environmentalist and designer Aniko Meszaros was commissioned to create a permanent art installation, entitled &quot;Roots&quot;. The station became fully accessible with the addition of elevators.

In November 2021, the city government announced that an agreement had been reached with a developer to build over 500 new homes on the existing 173-space commuter parking lot at the station.

Upon opening in 1968, Victoria Park station&#x27;s interiors continued on the Bloor–Danforth subway line&#x27;s design theme of practical simplicity with minimal creative flourishes and no public art. Most overtly, the station&#x27;s interior walls are clad with the pattern of simple tiles shared with most other stations on the line. The tiles are smooth and unadorned grey block tiles with a narrower row of similar tiles in black meeting the ceiling at platform level. The original signage uses the Toronto Subway Font, with the station name sandblasted onto the walls in large type and painted in the same colour as the strip of black tiles by the ceiling. The flooring is the same basic pattern of terrazzo that appears at most Bloor–Danforth line stations: repeating grey squares separated by strips of aluminum. 

Victoria Park station consists of a concourse at grade where fare control takes place, elevated platforms for subway trains, and a large outdoor bus transfer area. The present bus terminal was completed in 2011 by Stevens Group Architects, with Brown and Storey Architects, landscape architect Scott Torrance, and the TTC&#x27;s internal design department on the 2008–2011 renovation of the station. It replaced the original enclosed bus terminal, which was an oversized concrete structure with a series of bus bays sheltered by arched roofs. This transfer area is a plaza with a pedestrian walkway that is sheltered by a massive concrete canopy which arches out of a central row of columns. The canopy is perforated with circular openings in certain places for a whimsical effect of lightness, breaking up its shadows on sunny days.

Where the circular holes are cut deeper through the canopy, they are clad with stainless steel inside and contain artwork by designer and environmentalist Aniko Meszaros, as part of her installation entitled, &quot;Roots&quot;. Meszaros&#x27; artwork in this part of the station consists of intricate stainless steel screens akin to filigree with an organic, root-like design. These screens were cut by laser and meant to allow the sun to cast interesting shadows onto the walkway below. The canopy extends beyond the bus transfer area and even the station&#x27;s prominent glazed entrance on Victoria Park Avenue (also part of the 2008–2011 renovation) to a prominent column on the pedestrian plaza, wrapped with a rounded bench. The eastern edge of the bus transfer plaza is marked by a concrete retaining wall textured with a root motif. It holds up a landscaped slope.

The bus transfer plaza connects with the station&#x27;s original concourse at surface level. The 2008–2011 renovation introduced the station&#x27;s prominent glazed entrance on Victoria Park Avenue, which was previously a windowless brick and concrete wall. This entrance consists of a large doorway, with a minimalist glass facade around it accentuated by panes of pink-red glass, including a coloured glass entrance canopy. Above the entranceway, vertical metal trusses are visible behind the glazing. This entrance opens onto a small but functional pedestrian plaza with benches, trees, newspaper boxes, and the entrance to the station&#x27;s indoor bicycle storage area. The concourse also received contemporary porcelain tiles on certain walls and clear glass mosaic tiles on columns in the renovation. Its ceiling was refinished to include a series of inwardly-sloped sections for visual interest.

Victoria Park&#x27;s original platform area is an open hall with two side platforms. Unlike most Bloor–Danforth line stations, it has no pillars between its two sets of tracks. Its series of beams running perpendicular to the platforms holding up the roof is a unique aspect of the station&#x27;s architecture. Though this part of the station is above ground, windows were only introduced in the 2008–2011 renovation. Natural light now pours in through large windows which also allow views of the walkways to the station, the green roof added in the renovation, and the neighbourhood around the station. The green roof consists of low-maintenance sedum plants, whose floral colour changes with the four seasons. The north facade on the other side of the platform wall was also enlivened with a series of large metal panels painted yellow.

In addition to the intricate metal screens in the bus transfer area canopy, Aniko Meszaros designed several other works of art that were integrated into the station in the renovation as part the &quot;Roots&quot; installation. At platform level, the walls are adorned with a work in which the word &quot;community&quot; is written in different languages over images of the globe depicted as a system of roots. These circular images appear in groups. Large murals on the station&#x27;s original tiles in the stairwells from the concourse to the platform depict stylized trees from their roots to their branches, along with the poetic statement &quot;Toronto, a city where those with diverse roots can grow and intermingle into a complex and exciting multicultural garden.&quot; The concourse features a large wall mural of tree rings.

The underlying concept of the installation alludes to the varied cultural backgrounds of people living in the surrounding neighbourhood and city in general, whose ethnic backgrounds or &quot;roots&quot; colloquially, can be traced to different parts of the world. It also references the green roof and the lush areas surrounding the station.

==Subway infrastructure in the vicinity==

Subway trains travelling eastbound towards Victoria Park station from Main Street station exit the tunnel at the Thyra Portal several hundred feet from Victoria Park into an outdoor section of track. Then, a short section of the line is elevated through the station. Continuing east after the station, the track returns to ground level and angles northeast, diagonal to the street grid. Warden Woods Park, a city park that is mostly covered in forest with a central trail, is located on the northwest side of the tracks (on the left side of a train travelling eastbound). The scenery is thus relatively unique—subway trains travelling through forest, particularly when lush trees conceal the neighbourhood on the other side of the tracks in the summer with their leaves.

==Nearby landmarks==

The stark, unadorned brick towers of the Crescent Town neighbourhood stand to the northwest of the station and are connected by an enclosed pedestrian walkway, which is elevated over Victoria Park Avenue. The Dentonia Park Golf Club is located immediately to the north of the station and is visible through the windows of the westbound platform. The four apartment towers of Teesdale Place stand immediately northeast of the station. They appear similar to Crescent Town but are wider in profile. Cambridge Place at 30 Denton Avenue is a massive apartment building that towers just east of the surface transfer plaza. A significant belt of forested green space with walking paths is located north of the station, passing from the southwest corner of Warden Avenue and St. Clair Avenue East (across the street from Warden station) to the Don Valley at the foot of Don Mills Road. Shoppers World Danforth in Danforth Village is located southwest of the station at Victoria Park and Danforth avenues.

<text>Warden is a station on Line 2 Bloor-Danforth of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is located at the southeast corner of St. Clair Avenue East and Warden Avenue. The station is located perpendicular to St. Clair Avenue East, and is the only Line 2 station with a north–south alignment.

== Description ==
The station building has three levels: the subway platform is on the upper floor, fare gates and the concourse are found above street level, and the pedestrian entrance is on the lower floor. With the closure of the original bus terminal for reconstruction, a temporary bus terminal has been set up in a former parking lot along Warden Avenue on the east side of the station. There is a passenger pick-up and drop-off area on the temporary terminal&#x27;s south side. A pedestrian path runs along the west side of the station building connecting St. Clair Avenue and the temporary terminal to the station entrance. 

920 parking spaces are located at this station for commuter use, all of them in the North Lot on the north side of St. Clair Avenue.

== History ==

Warden station was opened in 1968 in what was then the Borough of Scarborough, and served as the eastern terminus for Line 2 Bloor–Danforth for 12 years until the extension to was completed in 1980.

When the station opened, it had a two-level bus terminal with a concourse on the upper level and nine bus bays at ground level. Each bay had separate stairways for riders to access the concourse, where there would be lighted signs showing the bus route and whether a bus was waiting below on a platform. The concourse had several retail outlets.

Until 1973, TTC buses and subway trains serving the station were in separate fare zones and so the turnstiles and collector booths were placed between the bus bays and the subway platforms. When the zones were abolished, the layout was reconfigured to bring the buses inside the station&#x27;s fare-paid area; one collector booth, left isolated inside the fare-paid zone, became an information booth.

Work started in 2022 to rebuild the bus terminal and make the station accessible. The station is one of the last subway stations yet to be made accessible, due to the complexity of the station layout and its multiple levels. In November 2023, the south parking lot was closed to convert it into a construction site. A temporary open-air bus terminal opened on January 5, 2025, freeing up the old bus terminal in advance of its demolition and permanent replacement. Elevators within the station are expected to be in service by mid-2025. A new bus terminal is expected to be completed by the end of 2027.

==Future redevelopment==
A new bus terminal will be built on the site of the original terminal. Designed by Strasman Architects to meet accessibility standards, the new two-level terminal will have 12 street-level bus bays, two elevators, two escalators and space for retail outlets.

Both commuter parking lots at the station are proposed to be redeveloped by the city government. In October 2021, the city announced that agreement had been reached with Tridel to build 600 residential units and a child care centre on the north parking lot.

== Subway infrastructure in the vicinity ==
After exiting the station eastbound towards Kennedy station, the track returns to a tunnel at the Chestnut Portal, where it continues on its diagonal alignment under the former Canadian National Railway (CNR) spur line.

There is a crossover west of the station from when it was Line 2&#x27;s eastern terminus which is still used occasionally to short turn trains. There is also a small siding and storage shed west of the crossover on the south side of the above-ground tracks, which continue along the track bed of the former CNR line all the way to Victoria Park station.

== Nearby landmarks ==
Nearby landmarks include the Providence Healthcare, Warden Woods Park, Warden Hilltop Community Centre and Pine Hills Cemetery. It is near much vacant industrial land (including the former site of Centennial College and Warden Woods Mall/Power Centre) where major redevelopment is expected over the coming years, including numerous new housing developments on the former Power Centre property. It is also near the Toronto District School Board high school WA Porter CI, which brings about 700 students into the station each year.

== Surface connections ==
The temporary bus terminal, opened on January 5, 2025, is accessible to those with disabilities; however, the subway platform will not be accessible until elevators are installed between street level and the subway platform.

The temporary bus terminal is located on the east side of Warden Avenue, south of St. Clair Avenue. The bus bays are numbered from 1 to 8 from south to north. Four of the bays (1, 6, 7, 8) are located on the east curb of Warden Avenue. The other four bays (3, 4, 5, 6) are located in an adjacent, former parking lot. The temporary bus terminal is outside of the station&#x27;s fare-paid area.

<doc id="1305846" wikidata="Q2032111" url="?curid=1305846" title="Swordstick">
<text>A swordstick or cane-sword is a cane containing a hidden blade or sword. The term is typically used to describe European weapons from around the 18th century. But similar devices have been used throughout history, notably the Roman &quot;dolon&quot;, the Japanese &quot;shikomizue&quot; and the Indian &quot;gupti&quot;.

==History==
A precedent for the swordstick would be used by 17th century spy Alonso de Contreras, who would hide a sword inside a staff while disguised as a pilgrim. The swordstick became a popular fashion accessory for the wealthy during the 18th and 19th centuries. During this period, it was becoming less socially acceptable to openly carry a sword, but there were still upper-class men routinely trained in swordsmanship who wished to go armed for self-defense. Swords concealed in ladies&#x27; walking sticks and parasols were also not unknown, as it was even less socially acceptable for a lady to carry a sword, or publicly admit that she knew how to use one.

Soon after their introduction, other &quot;gadget canes&quot; became popular. Instead of a blade, these would hold the tools of one&#x27;s trade, compasses, and even flasks for keeping alcohol. Benjamin Franklin received such a walking stick from a French admirer, and in a codicil to his Will bequeathed it to George Washington.

==Construction==
Malacca wood was the most commonly used material in making the cane shafts, and the standard grip was rounded and metallic. 

Today, designer and collector canes have sterling silver handles, and are made with wooden shafts made from various woods, including Malacca and bamboo. Ornate designs, such as animal heads, skulls, and various emblems may also be carved into the wooden handles; these may make them harder to wield, but some find them more attractive. Sword canes are most often made with rapier-pointed blades.

A bespoke swordstick maker in South Africa constructs canes and walking sticks of light but exceptionally strong carbon fiber, or titanium, often with an ornately engraved silver or wood head, concealing an 18 inch stainless steel blade.

==Practicality==
The utility of a sword-stick for self-defense is questionable. A 19th-century English expert on fencing, boxing, and close-quarters self-defense, R. G. Allanson-Winn, opined: 
[t]he sword-stick is an instrument I thoroughly detest and abominate, and could not possibly advocate the use of in any circumstance whatever . . . They are poor things as regards length and strength, and &#x27;not in it&#x27; with a good stick. . . . The hollowing out of the cane, to make the scabbard, renders them almost useless for hitting purposes.

Allanson-Winn&#x27;s objection may also reflect the prevailing view of concealed daggers as ungentlemanly, &quot;of shady reputation&quot;: the weapon of a ruffian or &quot;hasty hot-tempered individual&quot; for the &quot;shedding of blood over some trivial, senseless squabble.&quot; 

Allanson-Winn&#x27;s collaborator in self-defense training C. Phillips Wolley of the English Inns of Court School of Arms, took a different, perhaps even opposite view: a thrusting weapon is &quot;too&quot; deadly. The rapier imported from France and Spain displaced the native English and Scots broad-sword and sabre because &quot;English swordsmen realized that the point was much more deadly than the edge.&quot; But carrying a sword-cane designed only for a fatal thrust is problematic: the laws of self-defense require if possible to disable, not to kill. 

Instead these 19th-century experts recommended as more practical an ordinary walking-stick of Irish blackthorn, &quot;sans&quot; blade: strong, supple, and in skilled hands (that is, someone trained in fencing), decisive. A bladeless walking stick or cane has the additional advantage that it is not an illegal concealed weapon (see below).

==Legality==
In many jurisdictions the ownership, carrying, manufacturing or trading in sword canes is restricted by law.

===Belgium===
Possession of a swordstick is prohibited in Belgium as it falls under concealed weapons.

===France===
Having a swordstick is considered as having weapons of the 6th category. It is legal to own, however, specific care must be taken in case of transportation. (French defense code; Article L2331-1)

===Germany===
Handling of swordsticks (including those with short blades) is forbidden as concealed weapons.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the manufacture, importation, sale, hire, or loan of swordsticks are prohibited under the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990.

===New Zealand===
Swordsticks are considered a prohibited offensive weapon in New Zealand.

===United Kingdom===
The Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons) Order 1988, also made it illegal to trade in sword canes in the United Kingdom. However, antique swordsticks which are 100 years old or older are exempt.

It is illegal to:
* sell a knife to anyone under 18, unless it has a folding blade 3 inches long (7.62 cm) or less
* carry a knife in public without good reason, unless it has a folding blade with a cutting edge 3 inches long or less
* carry, buy or sell any type of banned knife (of which sword sticks are one)
* use any knife in a threatening way (even a legal knife)

===United States===
U.S. law on swordsticks is inconsistent, varying state-by-state, and currently it is in flux.

Examples of U.S. states with statutes that expressly prohibit the carrying of swordsticks include Arkansas (Ark. Code Ann. § 5-73-120(b)(3)(B)), California (Cal Pen Code § 12020(a)(1), New York (§ 265.01) and Massachusetts (269 § 12).

Other state laws do not prohibit swordsticks &quot;per se&quot;, but would include them under a general ban on carrying a hidden or disguised knife. An example is Virginia Code §18.2-308 which prohibits concealed dirks, stiletto knives, and &quot;any weapon of like kind,&quot; considered &quot;hidden from common observation when it is observable but is of such deceptive appearance as to disguise the weapon&#x27;s true nature.&quot;

Some states recently removed statutory restrictions on sword canes, including Montana in a 2017 amendment to M.C.A. 45-8-316, Oklahoma in 2016, 21 Okl. St.Ann. § 1272, and Ohio in 2021, which removed possession and carry restrictions on essentially all knives.

With U.S. constitutional law evolving on the U.S. 2nd Amendment right to keep and bear arms, and a demonstrable tradition of carrying swordsticks in the late 18th Century when the Constitution was adopted, at least one commentator believes the state law trend will be in the direction of less restriction.

<text>The Eastern Conference is one of two conferences that make up the National Basketball Association (NBA), the other being the Western Conference. Both conferences consist of 15 teams organized into three divisions. The Eastern Conference comprises the Atlantic, Central, and Southeast Divisions.

The current divisional alignment was adopted at the start of the 2004–05 season, when the now Charlotte Hornets began play as the NBA&#x27;s 30th franchise. This necessitated the move of the New Orleans Pelicans from the Eastern Conference&#x27;s Central Division to the newly created Southwest Division of the Western Conference.

The NBA first started awarding an Eastern Conference championship trophy during the 2000–01 season, renaming it after Hall of Famer Bob Cousy in the 2021–22 season. Also in 2021–22, the league began awarding the Larry Bird Trophy to the Eastern Conference Finals Most Valuable Player, named after Hall of Famer Larry Bird.

<doc id="1305850" wikidata="Q311273" url="?curid=1305850" title="Proteus mirabilis">
<text>Proteus mirabilis is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. It shows swarming motility and urease activity. &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; causes 90% of all &quot;Proteus&quot; infections in humans. It is widely distributed in soil and water. &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; can migrate across the surface of solid media or devices using a type of cooperative group motility called swarming. &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; is most frequently associated with infections of the urinary tract, especially in complicated or catheter-associated urinary tract infections.

==Diagnosis==
An alkaline urine sample is a possible sign of &quot;P. mirabilis&quot;. It can be diagnosed in the lab due to characteristic swarming motility, and inability to metabolize lactose (on a MacConkey agar plate, for example). Also &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; produces a very distinct fishy odor.

==Disease==
This rod-shaped bacterium has the ability to produce high levels of urease, which hydrolyzes urea to ammonia (NH3), so makes the urine more alkaline. Prolonged increased alkalinity can lead to the formation of crystals of struvite, calcium carbonate, and/or apatite, which can result in struvite kidney stones. Delayed or suboptimal treatment often allows these kidney stones to act as a nidus for &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; growth causing recurrent infections despite antibiotic treatment. If the stones grow large enough they can cause obstruction and kidney failure. &quot;Proteus&quot; species can also cause wound infections, sepsis, and pneumonia, mostly in hospitalized patients.

==Treatment==
&quot;P. mirabilis&quot; is generally susceptible to most antibiotics apart from tetracycline and nitrofurantoin, but 10–20% of &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; strains are also resistant to first-generation cephalosporins and ampicillin.
==Characteristics==
&quot;P. mirabilis&quot; can use urea. It can produce hydrogen sulfide gas, and forms clear films on growth media. It is motile, possessing peritrichous flagella, and is known for its swarming ability. It is commonly found in the human digestive system. &quot;P. mirabilis&quot; is not pathogenic in guinea pigs or chickens . This species&#x27; ability to inhibit growth of unrelated strains had been a topic for scientific curiosity, which then resulted in the discovery a macroscopically visible line of reduced bacterial growth where two swarming strains intersect. This line is named the Dienes line after its discoverer Louis Dienes.

The micro-organism tests:
*Indole-negative and nitrate reductase-positive (no gas bubbles produced)
*Methyl red-positive and Voges-Proskauer negative (Can be both MR- and V-P-positive)
*Catalase positive and cytochrome oxidase-negative
*Phenylalanine deaminase-positive
*Tryptophan test-negative
*Urea test- positive
*Casein test-negative
*Starch test- negative
*Hydrogen sulfide test-positive
*Citrate agar test-positive
*Ornithine decarboxylase-positive
*Lysine decarboxylase-positive
*No fermentation of arabinose, sorbitol and dulcitol 

== Swarming motility ==
Swarming is a specialized form of motility that groups of multicellular, flagellated bacteria can undergo to expand their populations to new locations. The swarming capability of &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; is important because it is implicated in the pathogenesis of the bacteria and the swarming capability is associated with the bacteria&#x27;s ability to express virulence factors &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; has a very characteristic bulls-eye appearance on an agar plate due to the regular periodic cycling between the vegetative and swarming state of the cells.

In liquid culture, &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; exists as a vegetative cell that is approximately 2 μm long and has four to ten peritrichous flagella. In the vegetative cell the flagella are used to propel the bacterium forward. Swarming cells are only formed when the bacteria are grown on solid surfaces so the ability to detect these solid surfaces is a required feature. It has been proposed that &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; senses a solid surface by the inhibition of its flagellum rotation, and it is this lack of freely rotating flagella that let the bacteria know it is on a solid surface. When &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; encounters a solid surface, and other necessary conditions have been met, the cell will undergo the differentiation process into a swarmer cell. This differentiation process includes the elongation of the cell 20 to 50 times longer than the vegetative cell, multinucleation, and more than a 50-fold greater surface density of flagella.

The swarming process continues as periodic cycles of cell differentiation, population migration, and consolidation as the bacteria undergo these changes in response to environmental stimulants. The repetition of this cycle is what gives &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; its distinctive bulls-eye pattern when growing on solid media. This pattern can be used to distinguish &quot;Proteus mirabilis&quot; from other species of swarming bacteria. Each ring is formed when the bacteria is in the consolidation stage and the bacteria is increasing in population.

<doc id="1305852" wikidata="Q6114280" url="?curid=1305852" title="Jack Narz">
<text>John Lawrence Narz Jr. (November 13, 1922 – October 15, 2008) was an American radio personality, television host, and singer.

==Early years==
Narz was born to John and Ado Narz, in Louisville, Kentucky, of Lithuanian descent, along with sister Mary and younger brother James Edward (1927–2020). James later changed his name to Tom Kennedy and went on to have his own career as a television host.

Narz served as a military fighter pilot during World War II, receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross for missions flown in the China-Burma theater.

==Career==
===Radio===
After his military service, Narz attended the Don Martin School of Radio Arts in Hollywood, where he received his broadcasting diploma in June 1947. He worked as an announcer at California radio stations KXO-AM, El Centro; KWIK-FM, Burbank; KIEV, Glendale; and KLAC-AM, Los Angeles.

===Television===
====Voice-over====
Narz broke into television doing commercials for a men&#x27;s store as &quot;Jack Narz, the man from Barr&#x27;s&quot;. It led to early voice work as one of the narrators for &quot;Adventures of Superman&quot;. Narz also made appearances in local Los Angeles television and served as the announcer on one of TV&#x27;s first nationally broadcast children&#x27;s shows, the 1950s science-fiction program &quot;Space Patrol&quot;.

Narz first achieved television fame in 1952 as the on-camera announcer and narrator of the syndicated sitcom &quot;Life with Elizabeth&quot; starring Betty White. He returned to his role as on-camera announcer and narrator for a restaging of &quot;Life with Elizabeth&quot; (along with Betty White) for KCOP-TV&#x27;s 50th anniversary special &quot;13 at 50&quot; in 1998.

In 1955, as he did on radio, Narz served as the announcer-sidekick of bandleader Bob Crosby on &quot;The Bob Crosby Show&quot; on daytime TV. That same year, he also worked as announcer on &quot;Place the Face&quot;, a game show hosted by Bill Cullen and earlier by Jack Bailey.

By the end of 1957, Narz&#x27;s success led him to relocate with his family from Southern California to the suburbs of New York City.

====&quot;Dotto&quot;====
In January 1958, Narz began hosting his own game show, presiding over CBS&#x27;s &quot;Dotto&quot;. Within a brief time the show became very popular, with &quot;Dotto&quot; running five days a week on CBS and, beginning in the summer of 1958, weekly in prime time on NBC. &quot;Dotto&quot; was later part of the 1950s quiz show scandals and was the first popular quiz show to be abruptly cancelled as a result. Narz was not involved in the deception and cheating on &quot;Dotto&quot;, and was immediately absolved of any responsibility when the story broke.

====Game-show host====
Narz soon went on to host &quot;Dotto&quot; replacement, &quot;Top Dollar&quot;, succeeding its first host, Warren Hull, as part of an arrangement made with CBS and the ad agency representing the Colgate-Palmolive Company and General Mills, with whom Narz was under contract at the time. In 1960, he guest-hosted for a month on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, while regular host Bill Cullen took a vacation. Later that year, he was the host of &quot;Video Village&quot;, but asked producers to let him leave the show for personal reasons; Monty Hall succeeded him.

After relocating to Los Angeles, Narz hosted &quot;Seven Keys&quot;, which started as a local show, but then moved to ABC (1961–1964). It later returned as a local show on KTLA in Los Angeles until January 1965. It was followed by a 13-week run on a new NBC game show titled &quot;I&#x27;ll Bet&quot;. In 1969, Narz began an association with Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions that lasted the remainder of his career. That year, Narz began hosting the syndicated revival of &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, doing so until 1972 when the show&#x27;s announcer, Gene Wood, replaced him.

In 1973, Narz started hosting &quot;Concentration&quot;. It aired in syndication until 1978 and was his longest-running job as host. He also emceed &quot;Now You See It&quot; on CBS from 1974 to 1975. In 1979, Narz served as the announcer and an associate producer for the CBS revival of &quot;Beat the Clock&quot; which was hosted by Monty Hall. Narz also was used as a sub-announcer for Gene Wood on the NBC version of &quot;Card Sharks&quot;.

His final game show work was hosting &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Be Kidding&quot;, which was broadcast in the Los Angeles/metropolitan area on station KDOC-TV in Anaheim, California during the 1987–1988 season.

====Joint appearances====

While Narz and his brother Tom Kennedy forged successful individual careers as broadcasters and hosts, they also made occasional joint appearances.

Kennedy guest-starred on Narz&#x27;s &quot;Beat the Clock&quot;, and Narz appeared on Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Say!&quot; during its NBC run, and on the syndicated &quot;It&#x27;s Your Bet&quot;. Narz also appeared on the &quot;Password Plus&quot; panel while Kennedy was hosting, and even switched with his brother to host for half of an episode. On the March 5, 1982, episode of &quot;Password Plus&quot;, Narz appeared as a celebrity guest for the week, along with Steven Ford; following a discussion between Kennedy and Narz about how easy it is to be unable to recall good clues under pressure, Narz offered to switch places with Kennedy, which (with the contestants&#x27; permission, as Kennedy had not been informed of the clues beforehand) they did for the remainder of the episode.

Both brothers also appeared on &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; as celebrity panelists.

===Singing===
Narz occasionally sang on &quot;The Bob Crosby Show&quot; while serving as its announcer. He also recorded an album, &quot;Sing the Folk Hits With Jack Narz&quot; (Dot Records DLP-3244 (monaural)/Dot DLPS-25244 (stereophonic), which was released in 1959.

==Personal life==
Narz&#x27;s first wife was Mary Lou Roemheld, daughter of Oscar-winning composer Heinz Roemheld and the sister of Bill Cullen&#x27;s wife, Ann. They had three sons, John, Michael, and David, and a daughter, Karen. They divorced in 1961.

On November 14, 1964, Narz married radio station program director Barbara Bricker, a former model and television actress. They divorced in 1966.

In 1969, he married Dolores &quot;Doe&quot; Vaichsner. She was the number one flight attendant for TWA for nearly 50 years. Jack and Dolores remained married for 39 years, until his death.

==Death==
On October 15, 2008, Narz died at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Beverly Hills, California, following two strokes and complications from kidney failure. He was 85.

<text>Brent Hawkes, (born June 2, 1950) is a gay rights activist and Canadian clergyman at The Metropolitan Community Church (MCC), also known as the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches (UFMCC), which is an international LGBT-affirming mainline Protestant Christian denomination.

==Early life and education==
Hawkes was born in Bath, New Brunswick to a Baptist family. Hawkes earned Bachelor of Science (1972) and Bachelor of Education (1973) degrees from Mount Allison University, before working as a teacher in Nova Scotia&#x27;s Annapolis Valley in the later 1970s. He then earned Master of Divinity (1986) and Doctor of Ministry (2001) degrees from Trinity College, an Anglican institution at the University of Toronto.

==Religious career and activism==
Hawkes was appointed as senior pastor of the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto, a church openly affirming for LGBTQ parishioners, in 1978 to succeed Bob Wolfe.

Hawkes has served on the advisory committee of PrideVision TV and served on the board of directors for advocacy group Egale Canada. In addition to his advocacy work on LGBT issues, he has supported anti-racist initiatives, drawn attention to poverty and poor housing, and advocated the ordination of female priests. 

On January 14, 2001, Hawkes gained national attention by performing a wedding ceremony for two same-sex couples at the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto. Although city clerks would not issue marriage licenses for same-sex marriages at this time, Hawkes employed the alternative provided in Ontario law for regular church attendees to publish official banns for three consecutive weeks, and thereby conducted a legal marriage without requiring prior government permission. In the spirit of the banns as a public opportunity for interested parties to raise legal objections, the church also issued a press release in late 2000 announcing its intentions. The government of Jean Chrétien did not endorse the marriages, although Governor-General Adrienne Clarkson sent a personal letter of support. The city clerk refused to register the record of marriage, leading to a court battle. The church sued the city, the province, and the federal government. On July 12, 2002, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled that the marriages performed by Hawkes in January 2001 were legal, but stayed its decision pending a possible appeal, and on June 10, 2003, the Court of Appeal for Ontario declared the common law definition of marriage as &quot;invalid to the extent that it refers to &quot;one man and one woman&quot; in the ruling of &quot;Halpern v. Canada&quot;, immediately striking down all barriers against same-sex marriage in the province.

Hawkes officiated the state funeral of Jack Layton on August 27, 2011, at Roy Thomson Hall. A fellow New Democrat, he spoke highly of Layton, who had touched millions of Canadians with his sudden death. In the end, he thanked Jack Layton for his work with the gay community and HIV/AIDS, issues the NDP leader had championed when they were not popular.

He retired as pastor of the Metropolitan Community Church in fall 2017, and was succeeded by Jeff Rock.
==Political career==
Hawkes briefly entered political life in the mid-1990s. In the Ontario provincial election of 1995, Hawkes ran as a candidate of the social-democratic New Democratic Party in the riding of St. George—St. David, which has a large LGBT community. Running in protest against the Bob Rae government&#x27;s handling of the failed Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act of 1994, he finished a strong third with 9,672 votes – fewer than one thousand votes behind the winner, Progressive Conservative Al Leach. Hawkes&#x27;s strong showing played a major role in defeating incumbent Liberal Tim Murphy.

==Personal life==
Hawkes lives in Toronto with John Sproule, his partner of more than forty years. They married on March 7, 2006.

===Sexual assault allegations===
On February 1, 2016, Hawkes was charged in the Provincial Court of Nova Scotia with indecent assault and gross indecency for an alleged sexual assault against a minor between 1974 and 1975 when Hawkes was a teacher in Nova Scotia. Hawkes pleaded not guilty, and was acquitted of all charges on January 31, 2017, with the judge ruling there were &quot;significant inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
In 2009, Hawkes received an Honorary Doctorate of Laws degree for his continuing work in activism and human rights in Canada from York University. In 2010, Hawkes was presented with an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Mount Allison University, and in 2011 received an Honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Trinity College, Toronto.

Hawkes was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada by Governor General Michaëlle Jean in 2007 for his achievements as &quot;a champion of human rights and social justice for decades&quot; and was formally invested into the Order in a ceremony on February 22, 2008.

In 2012, Hawkes was named one of the &quot;500 most influential gay men in the world&quot; by the European gay magazine &quot;Mate&quot;; and in 2013 he was inducted into the Q Hall of Fame, as an individual who made significant contributions to LGBT human rights.

Hawkes has been the recipient of the following awards:
*1994 – City of Toronto Award of Merit
*1995 – United Nations Association in Canada Global Citizen Award

*2002 – Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal
*2003 – City of Toronto Pride Award for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Transsexual, Two-Spirited Issues

<doc id="1305859" wikidata="Q2159773" url="?curid=1305859" title="Hans Ras">
<text>Johannes Jacobus (Hans) Ras (1 April 1926 – 22 October 2003) was emeritus professor of Javanese language and literature at Leiden University, the Netherlands. In 1961 he was lecturer at the University of Malaya, and in 1969 first representative in Jakarta of the KITLV (the Leiden-based Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde = Royal Institute of Linguistics and Anthropology). Until his retirement he was several times a member of the board of the KITLV. From 1985 to 1992, he was professor of Javanese language and literature at the University of Leiden.

==Youth==

Hans Ras was born in 1926 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, as the third son of a family of four children. His father had a wholesale business in confectionery, and all the children had to help in the business. They were all supposed to go to junior high school for their secondary education, as was usual at the time. However, when the eldest was expelled from such a school for precociousness and sent to a higher-grade high school, the others followed in his footsteps.

After Hans Ras passed his school-leaving exams, the Second World War broke out and he went into hiding, while his brothers were sent off into forced labour in Germany. Even at that time he was interested in languages, in particular the Javanese and Arabic language. But his high school certificate did not give him admission to an arts course at a university.

==Student years and travels==
In 1946, Ras enrolled for the special course of Indonesian studies for future employees with the Dutch colonial civil service. However, the political developments in the then Dutch East Indies made him realize that there was no future for Dutch civil servants in that country. After switching to economics for a while, he left the Netherlands for France, where he found a job on a dam construction project. Here his knowledge of Arabic, acquired in his Indonesian studies course, stood him in good stead, as most of the workers were North Africans. He acquired a taste for travelling and travelled on to Libya, Egypt, and Aden. On his return to the Netherlands, he did his national service training and after that, at the age of 24, applied for a job with the Rotterdam firm of Internatio (now called Internatio-Müller). He was sent to Indonesia, where he worked in then Batavia. Later he was sent as representative to Banjarmasin, in Southeast Kalimantan, to buy rubber from local growers. This was not without its dangers in the precarious relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia in those years. The local leftist trade unions were hostile to colonial capital, of which they regarded Internatio as a typical representative. In some of the violent demonstrations Ras was repeatedly threatened personally. For instance, once some workers who had been sacked used traditional medicine men to cast a spell on his house. As it became impossible to do his work any longer, he returned to the Netherlands.

His stay in Borneo had given Ras an even keener interest in Indonesia in all its aspects, however. He was accordingly advised by the then Professor of Malay, Drewes, to try to get the recently introduced Indonesian interpreter/translator’s certificate. He passed the exams for this certificate, which qualified him for enrolment at a university.

In the course of the exams, he had met Widjiati Soemoatmodjo. Widjiati, who was an employee of the Indonesian embassy and was transferred to Brussels in 1960. In the following period, Ras braved the weather in countless scooter rides between Leiden and Brussels. He was not to be deterred, even after a serious accident in which he sustained a severe concussion.

Meanwhile, Ras diligently applied himself to his studies, including the compulsory courses in the Arabic language and Sanskrit. He tried to learn the vocabulary of these languages by pinning lists of words and idioms on the walls of his room, which he tried to learn off by heart even while he was shaving!

==The University of Malaya==
In 1961, Ras obtained his master&#x27;s degree cum laude. He married Widjiati, and the newly-weds set out for Kuala Lumpur, where Ras had been appointed as lecturer at the University of Malaya even before passing his Master’s exams. His head of department was Professor Roolvink, who later became professor at Leiden. Besides his teaching duties, Ras devoted his time to writing a PhD thesis on the &quot;Hikayat Banjar&quot;, the Malaysian-language history of Banjarmasin.

In Kuala Lumpur, a son was born to the couple. On expiry of Ras’ three-year contract there, the family moved back to Leiden, where Ras became a lecturer in the Department of Languages and Cultures of Southeast Asia and Oceania.

In 1966, a daughter was born and Ras obtained his PhD degree cum laude on the basis of a voluminous thesis containing not only a careful edition of the text of the &quot;Hikayat Banjar&quot; but also a detailed description of the literary and cultural-historical context in which the text had originated. Not long after this, the Ras family left the Netherlands for Jakarta to make the necessary preparations for the establishment of the first Indonesian office of the KITLV there.

Ras made a success of this venture in spite of major political and bureaucratic obstacles. Thanks to his efforts, a solid foundation was laid for the academic cooperation between the Netherlands and Indonesia, which continues to this day.

==The University of Leiden, publications==
After his return from Indonesia in 1971, Ras worked in the Department in Leiden. He concentrated more and more on Javanese and as associate of Professor Uhlenbeck took over part of the latter’s teaching load. When Uhlenbeck went into retirement, Ras was the obvious person to succeed him and so he was appointed professor of Javanese language and literature in 1985.

As an aid to the teaching of Javanese language, he wrote a Javanese grammar with a lengthy anthology of modern Javanese texts. Of special importance for the specialist scholar are a number of lengthy, in-depth studies of aspects of Javanese culture and literature. Two particular aspects of this culture enjoyed his special interest. In the first place he made a close study of the Indonesian wayang theatre and its historical development, translating the text of one play, &quot;The Abduction of Subadra&quot;, into Dutch. No less important are his studies on the origin, structure, function and reliability of Javanese historical texts, in particular the Babad Tanah Jawi. Ras’ most important studies were reprinted in the monograph The shadow of the Ivory Tree. Ras spent the last years of his life preparing a new edition of the Pararaton, one of the most complex Old Javanese texts from a philological and literary-historical point of view. This text had already drawn his attention while working on the Hikayat Banjar. Poor health prevented him from completing this project.

Ras did however publish his conclusions from a comparison of the Pararaton (1481 AD) with respectively the Sanskrit Canggal inscription (732 AD), the Śivagŗha (Siwagrha) inscription (856 AD), the Calcutta Stone (1041 AD) and the Babad Tanah Jawi (1836 AD). He finds clear similarities in character, structure and function of these texts. Also there is similarity with texts from the Malay historiography. On the ground of this, he concludes that from the whole Indonesian area one specific type of texts can be placed together in one literary genre, the ‘government chronicle’ or the ‘book of kings’: historiography at the service of the legitimity of kingship.

Ras occupies a rightful place in the Leiden tradition of Indonesian studies. The qualities for which his publications stand out most are painstaking factual research, mostly of manuscripts, combined with wide scholarly reading, critical acumen, and keen intellect.

==Enthusiastic teacher, gripping and graphic lecturer==
In addition, Ras was an enthusiastic teacher, whose lectures were absorbing and graphic – a real performer. This doubtless had something to do with the fact that, as opposed to most of his colleagues, he took a strong interest in folk theatre and popular culture – in what one might call, in the Latin meaning of the word – the vulgar aspects of Javanese culture.

Although he was a scholar of the old stamp and kept his students at a certain distance, he did try to get them actively involved with the subject. This he did by organizing a lecture in the form of a seminar with papers and talks by and discussion among the participants – quite an unusual approach in the department at the time – and by occasionally organizing lectures for students at his home.

He was able to inspire others with his own love for the culture and people of Java, in an academic as well as other respects. He took a deep interest in others who were interested in Indonesian, and particularly Javanese culture. Such as, for instance, the puppeteer from Haarlem, Rien Baartmans – who died far too young – who performed not only Dutch puppet plays but also Javanese wayang plays and was famous, especially among children, for his wonderful performances of Wayang Kancil stories about the mouse deer. And his good friend Ger van Wengen, who devoted his time as curator at the Leiden ethnological museum to popularizing ethnology, with Ger using data provided by Hans, such as his book &quot;De schending van Soebadra&quot; (The Abduction of Subadra), and Hans learning from Ger.

==Old age==
In 1992, Ras retired at the age of 66. It was not a happy development for him. He missed his work, and his health gradually failed him. He became a grandfather for the first time around the turn of the millennium, but was increasingly afflicted with Parkinson&#x27;s disease. After an attack of pneumonia in 2000, it was no longer possible to live at home. He was moved to a nursing home in the village of Warmond, near Leiden, in August 2002, where, nursed with loving care by Widjiati till the end, he died on 22 October 2003.

After Ras’ retirement in 1992, Javanese studies at Leiden continued along the path followed, or even cleared by Hans Ras. The focus on written texts, by which of course Javanese studies in Leiden were characterized also before Ras’ time, continues to be dominant in the department’s approach. Although traditional historiography – which was one of his specialities – rather faded into the background, Ras’ attention to contemporary popular culture laid the foundations for the serious scholarly study of this which is still practised there today.

<doc id="1305862" wikidata="Q5584936" url="?curid=1305862" title="Gordon Burns">
<text>Gordon Henry Burns (born 10 June 1942) is a retired Northern Irish journalist and broadcaster. He was the host of &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; for its original 18-year run (1977–1995) and was the chief anchorman for the BBC regional news programme &quot;North West Tonight&quot; from January 1997 to October 2011. In November 2011, he moved back to Belfast where he was born.

Due to Burns&#x27; work commitments with Granada Television on programmes such as &quot;World in Action&quot; and &quot;Granada Reports&quot; and later BBC Manchester for &quot;North West Tonight&quot;, he resided in Manchester for over thirty years. He most recently hosted a Sunday morning radio show for BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio Lancashire.

==Early life ==
Burns was born in Wellington Park, in Belfast. When he was a child his family moved to Kent, where he attended the local primary school and then went to Dulwich College in London. The family then returned to live at Belfast&#x27;s Belmont Road, where Burns attended Campbell College.

==Career==
He began his journalism career working on the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; and worked on BBC radio&#x27;s long-running &quot;Sports Report&quot; before joining Ulster Television as a sports editor and programme producer in 1967. Two years later, Burns began presenting the nightly news programme &quot;UTV Reports&quot;, first as a stand-in for regular frontman David Mahlowe and later as a chief anchor, during the early stages of The Troubles. In 1973, Burns joined Granada Television to anchor their nightly news programme &quot;Granada Reports&quot; and to work on the station&#x27;s current affairs output, including &quot;World in Action&quot;.

In September 1976 he presented an edition of Granada&#x27;s Friday night football preview programme &quot;Kick Off&quot;, in which he was covering for the regular presenter Gerald Sinstadt. Sinstadt, in turn, was that weekend covering for Dickie Davies as presenter of &quot;World of Sport&quot;; he was also covering the presenter and commentator roles for the Sunday afternoon match highlights programme &quot;The Kick Off Match&quot;, in which he both presented the programme and commentated on Sunderland v Manchester City at Roker Park, the main match that weekend, which was being filmed by Tyne Tees cameras for Granada viewers. (At the time Sinstadt was the producer of both &quot;Kick Off&quot; and &quot;The Kick Off Match&quot;; this stint as presenter and commentator was a one-off.)

Burns&#x27;s national profile began with his association of ITV&#x27;s game show &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot; which he presented for eighteen years from 1977 to 1995. He was the presenter of &quot;Password&quot; for Ulster Television, one of that company&#x27;s few programmes to be shown throughout the ITV network, and also hosted a &quot;Searchline&quot; segment in several series of LWT&#x27;s &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot;. During the 1980s Burns also reported from the political party conferences for the ITV network, and presented the Channel 4 current affairs series &quot;Irish Angle&quot;. In the early 1990s he presented two parlour game shows for the BBC: &quot;A Word in Your Ear&quot; and &quot;Relatively Speaking&quot;. He has also appeared as a guest on &quot;Noel&#x27;s House Party&quot;, and on &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; as a member of Ulrika Jonsson&#x27;s team.

From 1997 to 2011, Burns presented &quot;North West Tonight&quot;, alongside its shorter lunchtime version, &quot;North West Today&quot;. In 2007, Ranvir Singh joined as co-anchor of the previously single-headed main evening programme. Burns announced in April 2011 that he would be retiring from the role but would move on to present a Sunday morning show on BBC Radio Manchester and BBC Radio Lancashire in September 2011, with his last TV bulletin broadcast on 30 September.

He was the voice of &quot;The Chain&quot; feature and other features on the &quot;Radcliffe &amp; Maconie&quot; show on BBC Radio 6 Music. He appears as a guest on the show when The Chain reaches a significant milestone, for example, for the 5,000th (musically based) item on 3 March 2015 which was the single &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; by ABBA.

In 2013, Burns retired properly after stepping down from his radio show.

==Personal life==
Burns is married and has two adult children. He is the second cousin of English singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran.

<text>Megaradio was a German-speaking, privately owned radio station that began broadcasting in 1997. It operated on various medium-wave frequencies in Germany and Luxembourg, primarily from transmission sites such as the Marnach transmitter in Luxembourg. The station aired German-language pop music programs.

Megaradio had the potential to reach a wide audience, particularly across Europe at night, due to the strength of its transmitters. However, despite this expansive coverage, the station faced commercial challenges and was ultimately discontinued on April 4, 2003, at 1 AM. After its closure, most of the transmission facilities used by Megaradio, including those in Germany, were decommissioned, though the Marnach transmitter continued to operate until the end of 2015.

<doc id="1305887" wikidata="Q1612253" url="?curid=1305887" title="Holbeach">
<text>Holbeach is a market town and civil parish in the South Holland District in Lincolnshire, England. The town lies from Spalding; from Boston; from King&#x27;s Lynn; from Peterborough; and by road from Lincoln. It is on the junction of the A151 and A17.

The Prime Meridian of the world passes through the west of Holbeach and is marked with a millstone at Wignals Gate.

==History==
A number of Roman and Romano-British pottery finds have been made in and about the town.

The town&#x27;s market charter was awarded in 1252 to Thomas de Moulton, a local baron. All Saints&#x27; Church was built in the 14th century and the porch, which was built around 1700, possibly incorporated parts of de Moulton&#x27;s ruined castle. The associated All Saints&#x27; Hospital, for a warden and fifteen poor persons, was founded by Sir John of Kirton, in 1351. It had ceased to exist before the suppression of chantries and hospitals. The antiquarian William Stukeley reported that his father removed the ruins from the site which is now occupied by the Chequers Inn.

Until the beginning of the 17th century, the sea came to within of the town and there were severe floods recorded in the 13th and 16th centuries. The land drainage programmes that followed moved the coastline of the Wash to away, leaving Holbeach surrounded by more than of reclaimed fertile agricultural land. In 1615, nominees of the Earl of Argyll were entitled to the land which was reclaimed from the sea in Wigtoft, Moulton, Whaplode, Holbeach and Tydd St Mary. The Earl paid for the work, but differences of opinion stalled the project after 1634. Further enclosure of marshes were recorded in 1660, in Gedney, Whaplode, Holbeach and Moulton. The work included the building of an embankment, and resulted in being added to Holbeach parish. A second embankment was built under the provisions of the South Holland Embankment Act (1793) and added another . Following unsuccessful attempts in the 1830s, the rest of Holbeach Marsh was enclosed in 1840. The project was directed by Mr. Millington, and the total area added to the parish by all these enclosures was .

In 1829 a theatre was built for Joseph Smedley as the &#x27;Public Rooms&#x27; in Park Road. This was visited by the Lincoln Company, managed by Fanny Robertson, following their performances in Wisbech in 1841.

The Spalding and Norwich Railway, (later incorporated in the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway), opened Holbeach railway station in 1862. Like the rest of the M&amp;GN route, it closed to passengers in 1959 (before the Beeching Axe) and the line closed entirely in 1965.

The 19th century also saw the building of several small churches, including a Wesleyan chapel, built on Chapel Street in 1808, and a Baptist chapel, which was built on Albert Street in 1845 using red brick and colour-washed render.

The Second World War defences constructed at nearby Lawyers Creek comprise a number of pillboxes including the rare Ruck machine gun post.

==Geography==

The name &quot;Holbeach&quot; also applies to the civil parish of Holbeach. The parish is one of the largest by area in England, and extends from Cambridgeshire to the Wash, measuring north to south, and about east to west. The total population of the parish is almost 24,000 with approximately 10,000 in Holbeach town. The town has the most inhabitants and services compared to the villages surrounding it which incorporate its name.

Along with the town of Holbeach proper, the name is found in a number of villages in the Lincolnshire Fens: Holbeach Bank, Holbeach Clough, Holbeach Drove, Holbeach Fen, Holbeach Hurn, Holbeach St Johns, Holbeach St Marks and Holbeach St Matthew. This repetition of a name for a collection of close-lying villages is not unknown in the Fens: Gedney, Tydd, and Walpole are other examples.

The drainage of land around Holbeach is now the responsibility of the South Holland Internal Drainage Board, part of the Water Management Alliance, formerly known as the King&#x27;s Lynn Consortium of Internal Drainage Boards.

==Economy==
Much of the economy has been based on food processing and bulb growing. The United Kingdom&#x27;s largest supplier of tulip and daffodil bulbs is situated to the north of the town and flour milling continues at Barrington Mill.

== Community ==
Local public houses are The Red Lion (newly renovated and reopened), The Horse &amp; Groom, the Mansion House on High Street, and the Crown Hotel on West Street. Previous public houses were the Station Inn (Demolished and replaced with houses), the Chequers Hotel (newly renovated and reopened as Bar 912), the Exchange (now a residential property), The String of Horses (now a Hairdressers), The Ram (now a flower shop), The Bell Hotel (now Petite Street) and the Black Bull (now a fishing tackle shop).

The Royal Air Force maintains a bombing range, known officially as RAF Holbeach, on salt marshland at the coast of Holbeach parish, near the village of Gedney Drove End. The RAF station is situated approximately north-west of Holbeach town centre.

==Education==
There are two primary schools in Holbeach – Holbeach Primary School and William Stukeley Church of England Primary School.

The local secondary school on Park Road was called the George Farmer Technology &amp; Language College but, in September 2011, it became the University Academy Holbeach.

Holbeach is the base for a campus of the University of Lincoln, redeveloped in 2004 on the Park Road site of the former Holbeach Agricultural Centre and now known as the National Centre for Food Manufacturing. The campus specialises in food manufacturing technology.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Belmont TV transmitter. It is also possible to receive reception from the Waltham TV transmitter which broadcast BBC East Midlands and ITV Central, and Sandy Heath TV transmitter that broadcast BBC East and ITV Anglia. 

The town is covered by both BBC Radio Cambridgeshire and BBC Radio Lincolnshire. Other radio stations including Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire and Hits Radio Lincolnshire. Tulip Radio operated from Spalding until 2017. The area is also one of the few in Lincolnshire to be covered by a local DAB multiplex, NOW Peterborough.

Local newspapers are &quot;Spalding Today&quot; and &quot;Spalding Voice&quot;.

==Sport==

The local football club is Holbeach United, founded in 1929. The team plays in the United Counties League, part of the English football league system, and are known as the Tigers in reference to &#x27;Fen Tigers&#x27;, 18th-century local people who fought against the destruction of their way of life through the draining of the Fens.
Speedway racing took place at nearby Bell End at Whaplode St Catherine. Details of the events are sketchy and some reports suggest the venue had grass-surfaced straights and dirt-surfaced bends. The venue is known to have operated in the immediate post-war era but closed in 1948.

These transmitters were utilised by Radio Luxembourg, which gained iconic status amongst audiences in Britain and Ireland in the 1930s and again in the 1960s and 1970s, for popular programmes that circumvented restrictive broadcasting laws, particularly in the UK. This gave Junglinster an important role in the history of pirate radio. The transmitters are in still in use by RTL (French radio).

<doc id="1305939" wikidata="Q1143310" url="?curid=1305939" title="Uptown Girls">
<text>Uptown Girls is a 2003 American comedy drama film directed by Boaz Yakin and starring Brittany Murphy, Dakota Fanning, Heather Locklear, Marley Shelton, Donald Faison, and Jesse Spencer. Adapted by screenwriters Julia Dahl, Mo Ogrodnik and Lisa Davidowitz from a story by Allison Jacobs, it focuses on the naive daughter of a famous rock musician who, after learning her inheritance has been embezzled, finds herself employed as a nanny for a precocious hypochondriac girl in Manhattan, New York.

Some writers on the film noted that the film has received more positive response in the years after its release and has been described as a 2000s classic.

==Plot==
Molly Gunn is a generous, free-spirited young woman who lives off the ample trust fund of her late rock star father, Tommy Gunn, who died in a plane crash alongside Molly&#x27;s mother when she was a child. Molly falls for singer Neal Fox when he plays at her birthday party, thrown by her best friends Huey and Ingrid. Molly and Neal spend several days and nights of passion sequestered in her apartment, until Neal leaves abruptly and says that he cannot be a part of her disordered life. Adding to her misfortune, she discovers that her father&#x27;s accountant has embezzled her money, leaving her penniless and homeless. She moves in with Ingrid, on the condition that Molly finds a job.

She begins working as a nanny for Lorraine &quot;Ray&quot; Schleine, an 8-year-old girl who exhibits obsessive hypochondriac behaviors. Ray&#x27;s mother, Roma, a wealthy music executive, is completely uninvolved in her daughter&#x27;s life. Ray&#x27;s father is in a coma induced by a stroke, and is being treated at home by a private nurse, which causes Ray to repress her emotions and maintain a strict regimen of orderliness. Although she enjoys ballet, Ray refuses to freestyle and often quotes Mikhail Baryshnikov: &quot;Fundamentals are the building blocks of fun.&quot; Molly attempts to show her how to have fun, which at first causes conflict between them, but eventually Ray begins to bring her guard down.

Molly continues to pursue Neal and holds onto his lucky jacket in hopes of seeing him again. After a baking accident, Molly causes a fire that damages Neal&#x27;s jacket. She redesigns it to fix the damage, but Neal breaks up with Molly when he sees it, insisting he has to focus on his music career and does not have time for her flightiness. Soon after, he lands a record deal with Roma and has a hit music video with a song that Molly inspired him to write, all while wearing the jacket Molly made. Disgusted, Molly agrees to Ingrid&#x27;s suggestions to sell off her possessions so she can prove that she is growing up. However, after a fight, Ingrid kicks Molly out, and Molly goes to live with Huey. One night, after fighting with and feeling hurt by Neal again, Molly sleeps at Ray&#x27;s place after feeling alone at Huey&#x27;s apartment and finds Neal one morning, having slept with Roma.

The budding friendship between Molly and Ray continues to develop when Molly takes Ray to Coney Island and explains that when her parents died, she ran away to Coney Island and rode the tea cups. She encourages Ray to talk to her comatose father, and promises that it will help him improve. However, Ray&#x27;s father dies the next day, and Ray orders Roma to fire Molly. In Roma&#x27;s office, Molly chides her for emotionally neglecting Ray. As she leaves, Molly runs into Neal, who begs for a reconciliation, claiming Molly is his muse. Molly turns him down and admonishes him for only caring about her when it is convenient for him. Ray runs away from home and Roma begs Molly to find her. Molly finds Ray at Coney Island, riding in the tea cups. Despite being furious with Molly for raising her hopes, she collapses into Molly&#x27;s arms, crying, finally coming to terms with her grief.

Molly, deciding to take charge of her own life, takes Ray&#x27;s advice to auction off her late father&#x27;s guitar collection to an unknown buyer; this enables her to afford her own apartment. At the wake for Ray&#x27;s father, Molly meets other musicians who ask her to design their clothes after seeing Neal&#x27;s jacket in his video. She and Ingrid also make amends and Molly finds Ray to apologize as well. She promises to stay friends with Ray and enrolls in design school after realizing her talent for fashion.

Molly arrives at Ray&#x27;s recital late and is pleased to see Ray is wearing the tutu Molly designed for her. She is surprised when Ray dances freestyle to Neal singing &quot;Molly Smiles&quot;, a song written for her by her father when she was a child. He plays using Tommy Gunn&#x27;s acoustic guitar, while the remaining ballerinas dance with the other guitars from her father&#x27;s collection, revealing that he was the anonymous buyer. In a voice-over, Ray says that the end was a new beginning for all of them.

==Cast==

Additionally, Brian Friedman, Lucy Saroyan, Nas, Carmen Electra, Mark McGrath, Dave Navarro, and Duncan Sheik also appear as celebrity guests during a funeral scene.

==Release==
===Box office===
The film opened at number five behind &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;, &quot;Open Range&quot;, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; and &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;, grossing US$11,277,367 in its opening weekend across 2,495 screens. It remained in theatrical release for nineteen weeks, grossing a total of $37,182,494 in the United States, with an additional $7,434,848 internationally, for a total worldwide gross of $44,617,342.

===Critical response===
&quot;Uptown Girls&quot; was panned by critics upon release. On Rotten Tomatoes, 13% of 112 reviews are positive and the consensus states: &quot;With two obnoxious lead characters and an uneven screenplay, &quot;Uptown Girls&quot; fails to charm.&quot;

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized the film&#x27;s plot, writing: &quot;In this standard variation of the princess myth, it takes a humbling fall from grace for Molly to gain a smidgen of soul and a glimpse of happily ever after. Once her obnoxiousness has been camouflaged by a thick glaze of saccharine, things magically work out, as they usually do for Hollywood princesses in distress.&quot;

David Noh of &quot;Film Journal International&quot; characterized the film as &quot;fluff&quot;, but added: &quot;Murphy creates a rather fascinating chemistry with Fanning, who resolutely absconds with the film as a controlling tot from hell, a fun-killing spinster trapped in a prepubescent body.&quot;

A positive review came from Roger Ebert, who awarded the film three stars out of four and likened Murphy to Lucille Ball.

===Legacy===
Following Murphy&#x27;s death at the age of 32 on December 20, 2009, Fanning, at age 15, stated that she cherished the time they spent together while working on the film, and that she was &quot;very grateful that [she] had the chance to work with [Murphy].&quot;

Some writers on the film noted that the film has received more positive response in the years after its release and has been described as a 2000s classic.

==Home media==
&quot;Uptown Girls&quot; was released to VHS and DVD in Region 1 on January 6, 2004 by MGM Home Entertainment. Olive Films released the film on Blu-ray in 2016.

<doc id="1305944" wikidata="Q2085573" url="?curid=1305944" title="Phi Gamma Delta">
<text>Phi Gamma Delta (), commonly known as Fiji, is a social fraternity with 139 active chapters and 13 colonies across the United States and Canada. It was founded at Jefferson College, Pennsylvania, in 1848. Along with Phi Kappa Psi, Phi Gamma Delta forms a half of the Jefferson Duo. Since its founding, the fraternity has initiated more than 211,000 brothers. The nickname FIJI is used commonly by the fraternity due to Phi Gamma Delta bylaws limiting the use of the Greek letters.

==Founding==

The organization was founded on April 22, 1848, at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Six college students gathered in a dormitory room (known by the students as &quot;Fort Armstrong&quot;) to establish a secret society. The society they formed was initially called &quot;The Delta Association&quot;. The founders, referred to by members as the &quot;Immortal Six&quot;, were John Templeton McCarty, Samuel Beatty Wilson, James Elliott Jr., Ellis Bailey Gregg, Daniel Webster Crofts, and Naaman Fletcher.

The first regular meeting of Phi Gamma Delta and the adoption of the Fraternity&#x27;s Constitution took place on May 1, 1848. Consequently, May 1 was chosen to be &quot;Founder&#x27;s Day&quot; at the 43rd Convention held in 1891 and has traditionally been celebrated as the founding date of the Fraternity.

Contrary to popular belief, the Immortal six were not Freemasons when they entered Jefferson College.

==Beliefs==
Phi Gamma Delta has chosen not to use the term alumni for members who have graduated; post-collegiate members are referred to as Graduate Brothers, to imply that membership extends past the undergraduate experience. Similarly, one of the mottoes used by the organization is, &quot;Not for College Days Alone&quot;.

Phi Gamma Delta&#x27;s mission statement lists five core values for its members: friendship, knowledge, service, morality, and excellence. In addition, members are encouraged to live by three priorities in this respective order: scholarship, fraternity, and self. This ordering is because members attend university with the foremost goal of receiving an education, and that Phi Gamma Delta is a fraternity that promotes scholastic achievement amongst its members.

==Practices and customs==
===Use of Greek letters and etymology of &quot;Fiji&quot;===
Phi Gamma Delta limits the written display of its Greek letters. In accordance with the fraternity&#x27;s international bylaws, Fiji chapters and members only inscribe their letters in the following seven locations:

# On a uniform diamond-shaped member badge
# On memorials to deceased brothers
# On the Fraternity&#x27;s official flag
# On the Fraternity&#x27;s official seal
# On a chapter house marker
# On a brother&#x27;s official college ring
# On a brother&#x27;s certificate of membership

The fraternity instructs its members to consider the letters sacred and to never display them on an object that can be easily destroyed. Whereas other fraternities often display their letters on clothing or other items, this tradition prevents Fijis from doing so. In place of the actual Greek letters, &quot;Fiji,&quot; &quot;Phi Gam,&quot; or the English spelling &quot;Phi Gamma Delta&quot; is used in their place.

The Fiji nickname started at New York University as a suggested name for the Fraternity magazine (Fee Gee). It was officially adopted by the national fraternity at the 1894 convention in the belief that the term would be distinctive and appeal to the imagination. Prior to its formal appropriation by the organization at large, nicknames for members of the fraternity varied greatly; ranging from &quot;Phi Gamm&quot; and &quot;Delta&quot; by brothers across the nation, &quot;Fee Gee&quot; in New York, and &quot;Gammas&quot; in the South. Today, &quot;Fiji&quot; and &quot;Phi Gam&quot; are considered by the fraternity to be the only appropriate nicknames for Phi Gamma Delta members on the international scale, though local nicknames related to a chapter&#x27;s Greek name or other colloquialisms do exist.

===Organization===
The fraternity is composed of two types of chapters. Most chapters serve primarily undergraduate students and are established at a single college or university. There are also chapters to serve members of the fraternity who have graduated and are established to serve a city or larger region. The chapters are governed by the fraternity&#x27;s international headquarters in Lexington, Kentucky.

===Honors and awards===
Each year, the Phi Gamma Delta organization gives out a number of awards, both to chapters, and to individual members.

===Pig Dinner===
The Frank Norris Pig Dinner is an annual graduate dinner held by all Phi Gamma Delta chapters. The dinner is named for author Frank Norris, a member of the Fiji chapter at the University of California, Berkeley where the first Pig Dinner was held in 1893. Pig Dinner is sanctioned by the International Fraternity and it serves to welcome graduate brothers back to their undergraduate chapters.

It is the oldest active, chapter-based, annual graduate event in the world of fraternities and sororities.

The International Fraternity stores a list of annual Pig Dinners.

===Fiji Islander===
Affectionately built upon the &quot;Fiji&quot; nickname, many chapters hold an annual &quot;Fiji Islander&quot; party. These are typically large, tropical-themed festivities, often using banana and palm trees as decoration, although they can vary widely from chapter to chapter. Some are large parties where alcohol, sand, and tropical foliage are present. Others may be alcohol-free, and some are charity projects, rather than parties.

===Fiji Man===
The fraternity once used a mascot named &quot;Fiji Man,&quot; a thick-lipped, dark-skinned man in a grass skirt, sometimes holding a spear or with a bone in his nose, in the style of a once-common Pacific Islander stereotype. Fraternity members built large sculptures of this racist caricature as a party decoration. The Phi Gamma Delta national organization has since banned Fiji Man, and now prohibits appearing in blackface at fraternity events.

====Controversy====

The appearance of &quot;Fiji Man&quot;, Phi Gamma Delta&#x27;s historical racist mascot, caused complaints from the 1970s to 1990s.

A Fiji Man snow sculpture at Colgate University in 1979 and a t-shirt depicting Fiji man at the University of Texas in 1989 both caused campus-wide apprehension about racism. A &quot;slave auction&quot; with Fiji Man decorations at the University of Southern California in 1989 resulted in mandatory diversity training for the fraternity members. The women who conducted the training characterized it as not one of her more successful efforts.

In 1987, the Phi Gamma Delta chapter at University of Wisconsin–Madison was suspended twice for racism. In May, it was closed because of a Fiji Island party featuring a large caricature of a Pacific Islander with a bone through his nose. Eight days after it was reinstated, the chapter was closed again because Phi Gamma Delta members entered Zeta Beta Tau, a majority-Jewish fraternity, where they began shoving and punching people. Two Fiji members were charged with battery.

In 1990, Phi Gamma Delta members at the University of Texas in Austin handed out t-shirts with a racist Little Black Sambo drawing during a basketball tournament. 500 students protested outside the fraternity house after the incident.

==Local chapter or member misconduct==

===Indiana===

A federal lawsuit filed by a Butler University student in 2019 describes being raped by a Wabash College Phi Gamma Delta member while she was black-out drunk during a Phi Gamma Delta party. She told her attacker to stop and attempted to escape while blacking out repeatedly. Other Phi Gamma Delta fraternity members tried to prevent the woman&#x27;s friends from finding her as she was being raped, according to the lawsuit. She says that Crawfordsville, Indiana police told her that Wabash College has no formal code of conduct and that the student who assaulted her would face few consequences, so encouraged her not to pursue the complaint.

===Iowa===

On August 30, 2021, an online petition alleged a sexual assault at the University of Iowa Phi Gamma Delta chapter, said to have occurred the year prior. The allegation appeared a few days after a reported assault at the Nebraska chapter, where students protested in front of the Phi Gamma Delta house.

In September 2012, University of Nebraska at Lincoln (UNL) campus police fielded a report of a rape at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house.

On January 21, 2017, Phi Gamma Delta fraternity members at UNL were claimed to have screamed pro-rape slurs at participants of the 2017 Women&#x27;s March. Chants of &quot;no means yes, yes means anal&quot; were allegedly aimed at thousands of women, children, and men walking past the fraternity house on the University of Nebraska campus. Fraternity members were accused on social media of waving Donald Trump signs, screaming &quot;grab them by the pussy,&quot; and then announcing which marchers they would and would not want to &quot;grab by the pussy&quot;. Multiple protesters have said that they heard the fraternity members chanting, which a spokesperson for the fraternity has denied. One week later, a protest was held outside the fraternity&#x27;s chapter house. The protest was attended by about 50 people, including an antifa group which flung tampons dipped in red paint at the building. The fraternity was suspended from UNL from March 2017 to May 2020 because of &quot;a pattern of sexually harassing conduct&quot; and other patterns of misconduct.

The UNL chapter was accused of sexual misconduct in October 2019, while it was still suspended because of the events of 2017.

A sexual assault was reported to University of Nebraska police on August 24, 2021, as having been committed by a Phi Gamma Delta member. Hundreds of protesters converged on the fraternity house that night, calling for an end to rape on campus and for the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity to be shut down. Fraternity members stayed inside the house and shared a video via the internet of them laughing at the protestors out the window. The next day, chancellor Ronnie Green announced that the university would be closing the fraternity house and suspending the chapter while the allegation of sexual assault was investigated.

Campus protests against Phi Gamma Delta continued through the next week. State senator Megan Hunt spoke at one, confirming that, although she did not attend UNL, she was aware of the &quot;open secret&quot; of frequent sexual assault at Phi Gamma Delta and certain other UNL fraternities. During the week of protests, university police received an influx of reports of rape; many were previously unreported events from years ago.

In October 2021, the UNL chapter of Phi Gamma Delta was suspended until 2026. The suspension was because of alcohol use, and not officially connected to the recent protests or ongoing sexual assault investigation.

===Tennessee===

A member at the University of Tennessee was accused of drugging and raping two women during a party in 2019. The accused apologized to one of the women in a text message, which was later used as evidence of his guilt. The fraternity house was sanctioned.

==Hazing allegations==

In 1997, as part of an allegedly mandatory hazing event at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology chapter, 18-year-old freshman Scott Krueger died as a result of excessive alcohol consumption. Manslaughter charges were brought against the Phi Gamma Delta organization itself, rather than any individuals. In response, the chapter dissolved and the case was suspended. MIT later settled with Krueger&#x27;s family for 4.75 million dollars.

In 1999, a 19-year-old pledge was tackled and taken to the Phi Gamma Delta house at the University of Nebraska, where he was handcuffed and forced to drink 15 shots of brandy and whisky and three to six cans of beer over two and a half hours. He broke loose from the handcuffs and attempted to escape by sliding down a drainpipe from a third story window. He fell and suffered head injuries. The incident led to the Nebraska Legislature making hazing a crime. In a resulting lawsuit, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled that the university should have taken more steps to protect the student, as the university was aware of a pattern of hazing, sexual assault, and other problems at the Phi Gamma Delta house.

In 2006, 19-year-old Danny Daniels was found dead in the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house at Fresno State University, prompting an investigation and immediate suspension of the chapter. It was found that the fraternity hosted a large party the night before, and that members forced Daniels to drink large amounts of alcohol for initiation. Once he became sick, a few FIJI brothers carried him to a secluded room at the fraternity and left him. Daniels died in the early morning of January 8 from acute alcohol intoxication, and later tests showed that Daniels had a blood-alcohol level of 0.34, more than four times the legal limit. The university suspended the chapter for 5 years; as of 2019, they are still inactive.

On September 17, 2010, a prospective member (pledge), Matt Fritzie, was partially paralyzed after diving into a shallow pool during a Fiji Islander party in Lawrence, Kansas. In response to the incident, the University of Kansas placed the chapter on a two-year probation for hazing. Fritzie has since sued both the chapter and the national organization.

In 2012, West Virginia University banned the fraternity in response to alcohol-related hazing. The fraternity reinstated the chapter in 2014.

On April 4, 2014, Michael Evan Anderson, member of the University of Arizona chapter of FIJI, died after an unsanctioned FIJI event, when he fell from the top of an air conditioning unit onto the roof of his dormitory. The investigation of his death by the University Police led to an investigation from the Dean of Students Office, which included several counts of hazing, including kicking new members in the stomach, new members cleaning the house before and after parties, and performing personal acts of servitude to members.

In 2015, five members of the fraternity at the University of Alabama were arrested after an investigation into hazing of their pledges. Per a legitimate anonymous source, fraternity members required pledges to stand in buckets of ice and salt, resulting in severe injuries.

In 2017, the fraternity at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln was suspended by the university until 2020 for reckless alcohol use, hazing pledges, and inappropriate sexually based behavior, including a pattern of sexually harassing conduct.

Police at the University of Missouri - Columbia were alerted to an unresponsive freshman, Daniel Santulli, brought to a local hospital by members after a fraternity party in 2021. Lawsuits are in process, and two of the members have been charged with felonies. One lawsuit states Santulli&#x27;s &quot;skin was pale and his lips were blue, yet no one called 911.&quot; Instead, &quot;the decision was made to drive Santulli to University Hospital in Columbia in one of the brother’s cars.&quot; It was also alleged that &quot;this was not just an alcohol overdose, but was hazing on a pledge during their &#x27;dad reveal&#x27;.&quot; The university announced it would no longer recognize Phi Gamma Delta as a student organization because of multiple violations of its standard of conduct.

In 2021, the fraternity at the University of Missouri had their recognition as an officially registered student organization on campus withdrawn due to multiple violations of the university&#x27;s standard of conduct.

In 2022, the fraternity at Bowling Green State University was suspended after an investigation by the university revealed hazing and underage drinking by the group.

In 2022, the chapter at the University of Kansas was suspended for several years due to extreme verbal, emotional, and physical abuse of pledges. One pledge reported to authorities his entire pledge class was &quot;under the control and authority of members every waking minute each day&quot; during the fall 2021 semester.

In 2025, the chapter at the University of Central Florida was placed on interim suspension and prohibited from spring 2025 rushing activities due to allegations of hazing and antisemitism. In spring 2023, two pledges were photographed blindfolded with nazi symbolism placed on them. The photograph was anonymously reported to the university, and the chapter was suspended pending an investigation.

==Founding of Kappa Alpha Theta==
Fijis at the Lambda chapter at Indiana Asbury University (now known as DePauw University) played an important role in the founding of Kappa Alpha Theta women&#x27;s fraternity. Bettie Locke, the sister of George W. Locke (DePauw, 1871), was one of the first women enrolled at DePauw. Bettie had many Fiji friends and one of them asked her to wear his badge. She contended that she would do so only if she knew the secrets behind the letters. The fraternity, after debate, declined to initiate her. So, upon suggestion of her father, John Wesley Locke, a Beta Theta Pi, she formed Kappa Alpha Theta with a few other women enrolled at DePauw at the time. Kappa Alpha Theta was founded on January 27, 1870. Phi Gamma Delta later presented Bettie Locke with an engraved silver cake basket as a token of friendship.

<doc id="1305947" wikidata="Q229367" url="?curid=1305947" title="3D printing">
<text>3D printing, or additive manufacturing, is the construction of a three-dimensional object from a CAD model or a digital 3D model. It can be done in a variety of processes in which material is deposited, joined or solidified under computer control, with the material being added together (such as plastics, liquids or powder grains being fused), typically layer by layer.

In the 1980s, 3D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes, and a more appropriate term for it at the time was rapid prototyping. , the precision, repeatability, and material range of 3D printing have increased to the point that some 3D printing processes are considered viable as an industrial-production technology; in this context, the term &quot;additive manufacturing&quot; can be used synonymously with &quot;3D printing&quot;. One of the key advantages of 3D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries that would be otherwise infeasible to construct by hand, including hollow parts or parts with internal truss structures to reduce weight while creating less material waste. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), which uses a continuous filament of a thermoplastic material, is the most common 3D printing process in use .

== Terminology ==
The umbrella term &quot;additive manufacturing (AM)&quot; gained popularity in the 2000s, inspired by the theme of material being added together (in any of various ways). In contrast, the term &quot;subtractive manufacturing&quot; appeared as a retronym for the large family of machining processes with material &quot;removal&quot; as their common process. The term &quot;3D printing&quot; still referred only to the polymer technologies in most minds, and the term &quot;AM&quot; was more likely to be used in metalworking and end-use part production contexts than among polymer, inkjet, or stereolithography enthusiasts.

By the early 2010s, the terms &quot;3D printing&quot; and &quot;additive manufacturing&quot; evolved senses in which they were alternate umbrella terms for additive technologies, one being used in popular language by consumer-maker communities and the media, and the other used more formally by industrial end-use part producers, machine manufacturers, and global technical standards organizations. Until recently, the term &quot;3D printing&quot; has been associated with machines low in price or capability. &quot;3D printing&quot; and &quot;additive manufacturing&quot; reflect that the technologies share the theme of material addition or joining throughout a 3D work envelope under automated control. Peter Zelinski, the editor-in-chief of &quot;Additive Manufacturing&quot; magazine, pointed out in 2017 that the terms are still often synonymous in casual usage, but some manufacturing industry experts are trying to make a distinction whereby additive manufacturing comprises 3D printing plus other technologies or other aspects of a manufacturing process.

Other terms that have been used as synonyms or hypernyms have included &quot;desktop manufacturing&quot;, &quot;rapid manufacturing&quot; (as the logical production-level successor to &quot;rapid prototyping&quot;), and &quot;on-demand manufacturing&quot; (which echoes &quot;on-demand printing&quot; in the 2D sense of &quot;printing&quot;). The fact that the application of the adjectives &quot;rapid&quot; and &quot;on-demand&quot; to the noun &quot;manufacturing&quot; was novel in the 2000s reveals the long-prevailing mental model of the previous industrial era during which almost all production manufacturing had involved long lead times for laborious tooling development. Today, the term &quot;subtractive&quot; has not replaced the term &quot;machining&quot;, instead it when a term that covers any removal method is needed. Agile tooling is the use of modular means to design tooling that is produced by additive manufacturing or 3D printing methods to enable quick prototyping and responses to tooling and fixture needs. Agile tooling uses a cost-effective and high-quality method to quickly respond to customer and market needs, and it can be used in hydroforming, stamping, injection molding and other manufacturing processes.

== History ==
=== 1940s and 1950s ===
The general concept of and procedure to be used in 3D-printing was first described by Murray Leinster in his 1945 short story &quot;Things Pass By&quot;: &quot;But this constructor is both efficient and flexible. I feed magnetronic plastics — the stuff they make houses and ships of nowadays — into this moving arm. It makes drawings in the air following drawings it scans with photo-cells. But plastic comes out of the end of the drawing arm and hardens as it comes ... following drawings only&quot;

It was also described by Raymond F. Jones in his story, &quot;Tools of the Trade&quot;, published in the November 1950 issue of &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine. He referred to it as a &quot;molecular spray&quot; in that story.

=== 1970s ===
In 1971, Johannes F Gottwald patented the Liquid Metal Recorder, U.S. patent 3596285A, a continuous inkjet metal material device to form a removable metal fabrication on a reusable surface for immediate use or salvaged for printing again by remelting. This appears to be the first patent describing 3D printing with rapid prototyping and controlled on-demand manufacturing of patterns.

The patent states:

In 1974, David E. H. Jones laid out the concept of 3D printing in his regular column &quot;Ariadne&quot; in the journal &quot;New Scientist&quot;.

=== 1980s ===
Early additive manufacturing equipment and materials were developed in the 1980s.

In April 1980, Hideo Kodama of Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute invented two additive methods for fabricating three-dimensional plastic models with photo-hardening thermoset polymer, where the UV exposure area is controlled by a mask pattern or a scanning fiber transmitter.
He filed a patent for this XYZ plotter, which was published on 10 November 1981. (JP S56-144478).
His research results as journal papers were published in April and November 1981.
However, there was no reaction to the series of his publications. His device was not highly evaluated in the laboratory and his boss did not show any interest. His research budget was just 60,000 yen or $545 a year. Acquiring the patent rights for the XYZ plotter was abandoned, and the project was terminated.

A US 4323756 patent, &quot;method of fabricating articles by sequential deposition&quot;, granted on 6 April 1982 to Raytheon Technologies Corp describes using hundreds or thousands of &quot;layers&quot; of powdered metal and a laser energy source and represents an early reference to forming &quot;layers&quot; and the fabrication of articles on a substrate.

On 2 July 1984, American entrepreneur Bill Masters filed a patent for his computer automated manufacturing process and system (US 4665492). This filing is on record at the USPTO as the first 3D printing patent in history; it was the first of three patents belonging to Masters that laid the foundation for the 3D printing systems used today.

On 16 July 1984, Alain Le Méhauté, Olivier de Witte, and Jean Claude André filed their patent for the stereolithography process. The application of the French inventors was abandoned by the French General Electric Company (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and CILAS (The Laser Consortium). The claimed reason was &quot;for lack of business perspective&quot;.

In 1983, Robert Howard started R.H. Research, later named Howtek, Inc. in Feb 1984 to develop a color inkjet 2D printer, Pixelmaster, commercialized in 1986, using Thermoplastic (hot-melt) plastic ink. A team was put together, 6 members from Exxon Office Systems, Danbury Systems Division, an inkjet printer startup and some members of Howtek, Inc group who became popular figures in the 3D printing industry. One Howtek member, Richard Helinski (patent US5136515A, Method and Means for constructing three-dimensional articles by particle deposition, application 11/07/1989 granted 8/04/1992) formed a New Hampshire company C.A.D-Cast, Inc, name later changed to Visual Impact Corporation (VIC) on 8/22/1991. A prototype of the VIC 3D printer for this company is available with a video presentation showing a 3D model printed with a single nozzle inkjet. Another employee Herbert Menhennett formed a New Hampshire company HM Research in 1991 and introduced the Howtek, Inc, inkjet technology and thermoplastic materials to Royden Sanders of SDI and Bill Masters of Ballistic Particle Manufacturing (BPM) where he worked for a number of years. Both BPM 3D printers and SPI 3D printers use Howtek, Inc style Inkjets and Howtek, Inc style materials. Royden Sanders licensed the Helinksi patent prior to manufacturing the Modelmaker 6 Pro at Sanders prototype, Inc (SPI) in 1993. James K. McMahon who was hired by Howtek, Inc to help develop the inkjet, later worked at Sanders Prototype and now operates Layer Grown Model Technology, a 3D service provider specializing in Howtek single nozzle inkjet and SDI printer support. James K. McMahon worked with Steven Zoltan, 1972 drop-on-demand inkjet inventor, at Exxon and has a patent in 1978 that expanded the understanding of the single nozzle design inkjets (Alpha jets) and helped perfect the Howtek, Inc hot-melt inkjets. This Howtek hot-melt thermoplastic technology is popular with metal investment casting, especially in the 3D printing jewelry industry. Sanders (SDI) first Modelmaker 6Pro customer was Hitchner Corporations, Metal Casting Technology, Inc in Milford, NH a mile from the SDI facility in late 1993-1995 casting golf clubs and auto engine parts.

On 8 August 1984 a patent, US4575330, assigned to UVP, Inc., later assigned to Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corporation was filed, his own patent for a stereolithography fabrication system, in which individual laminae or layers are added by curing photopolymers with impinging radiation, particle bombardment, chemical reaction or just ultraviolet light lasers. Hull defined the process as a &quot;system for generating three-dimensional objects by creating a cross-sectional pattern of the object to be formed&quot;. Hull&#x27;s contribution was the STL (Stereolithography) file format and the digital slicing and infill strategies common to many processes today. In 1986, Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Hull was granted a patent for this system, and his company, 3D Systems Corporation was formed and it released the first commercial 3D printer, the SLA-1, later in 1987 or 1988.

The technology used by most 3D printers to date—especially hobbyist and consumer-oriented models—is fused deposition modeling, a special application of plastic extrusion, developed in 1988 by S. Scott Crump and commercialized by his company Stratasys, which marketed its first FDM machine in 1992.

Owning a 3D printer in the 1980s cost upwards of $300,000 ($650,000 in 2016 dollars).

=== 1990s ===
AM processes for metal sintering or melting (such as selective laser sintering, direct metal laser sintering, and selective laser melting) usually went by their own individual names in the 1980s and 1990s. At the time, all metalworking was done by processes that are now called non-additive (casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining); although plenty of automation was applied to those technologies (such as by robot welding and CNC), the idea of a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape with a toolpath was associated in metalworking only with processes that removed metal (rather than adding it), such as CNC milling, CNC EDM, and many others. However, the automated techniques that &quot;added&quot; metal, which would later be called additive manufacturing, were beginning to challenge that assumption. By the mid-1990s, new techniques for material deposition were developed at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon University, including microcasting and sprayed materials. Sacrificial and support materials had also become more common, enabling new object geometries.

The term &quot;3D printing&quot; originally referred to a powder bed process employing standard and custom inkjet print heads, developed at MIT by Emanuel Sachs in 1993 and commercialized by Soligen Technologies, Extrude Hone Corporation, and Z Corporation.

The year 1993 also saw the start of an inkjet 3D printer company initially named Sanders Prototype, Inc and later named Solidscape, introducing a high-precision polymer jet fabrication system with soluble support structures, (categorized as a &quot;dot-on-dot&quot; technique).

In 1995 the Fraunhofer Society developed the selective laser melting process.

=== 2000s ===
In the early 2000s 3D printers were still largely being used just in the manufacturing and research industries, as the technology was still relatively young and was too expensive for most consumers to be able to get their hands on. The 2000s was when larger scale use of the technology began being seen in industry, most often in the architecture and medical industries, though it was typically used for low accuracy modeling and testing, rather than the production of common manufactured goods or heavy prototyping.

In 2005 users began to design and distribute plans for 3D printers that could print around 70% of their own parts, the original plans of which were designed by Adrian Bowyer at the University of Bath in 2004, with the name of the project being RepRap (Replicating Rapid-prototyper).

Similarly, in 2006 the Fab@Home project was started by Evan Malone and Hod Lipson, another project whose purpose was to design a low-cost and open source fabrication system that users could develop on their own and post feedback on, making the project very collaborative.

Much of the software for 3D printing available to the public at the time was open source, and as such was quickly distributed and improved upon by many individual users. In 2009 the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printing process patents expired. This opened the door to a new wave of startup companies, many of which were established by major contributors of these open source initiatives, with the goal of many of them being to start developing commercial FDM 3D printers that were more accessible to the general public.

=== 2010s ===
As the various additive processes matured, it became clear that soon metal removal would no longer be the only metalworking process done through a tool or head moving through a 3D work envelope, transforming a mass of raw material into a desired shape layer by layer. The 2010s were the first decade in which metal end-use parts such as engine brackets and large nuts would be grown (either before or instead of machining) in job production rather than being machined from bar stock or plate. It is still the case that casting, fabrication, stamping, and machining are more prevalent than additive manufacturing in metalworking, but AM is now beginning to make significant inroads, and with the advantages of design for additive manufacturing, it is clear to engineers that much more is to come.

One place that AM is making a significant inroad is in the aviation industry. With nearly 3.8 billion air travelers in 2016, the demand for fuel efficient and easily produced jet engines has never been higher. For large OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) like Pratt and Whitney (PW) and General Electric (GE) this means looking towards AM as a way to reduce cost, reduce the number of nonconforming parts, reduce weight in the engines to increase fuel efficiency and find new, highly complex shapes that would not be feasible with the antiquated manufacturing methods. One example of AM integration with aerospace was in 2016 when Airbus delivered the first of GE&#x27;s LEAP engines. This engine has integrated 3D-printed fuel nozzles, reducing parts from 20 to 1, a 25% weight reduction, and reduced assembly times. A fuel nozzle is the perfect inroad for additive manufacturing in a jet engine since it allows for optimized design of the complex internals and it is a low-stress, non-rotating part. Similarly, in 2015, PW delivered their first AM parts in the PurePower PW1500G to Bombardier. Sticking to low-stress, non-rotating parts, PW selected the compressor stators and synch ring brackets to roll out this new manufacturing technology for the first time. While AM is still playing a small role in the total number of parts in the jet engine manufacturing process, the return on investment can already be seen by the reduction in parts, the rapid production capabilities and the &quot;optimized design in terms of performance and cost&quot;.

As technology matured, several authors began to speculate that 3D printing could aid in sustainable development in the developing world.

In 2012, Filabot developed a system for closing the loop with plastic and allows for any FDM or FFF 3D printer to be able to print with a wider range of plastics.

In 2014, Benjamin S. Cook and Manos M. Tentzeris demonstrated the first multi-material, vertically integrated printed electronics additive manufacturing platform (VIPRE) which enabled 3D printing of functional electronics operating up to 40 GHz.

As the price of printers started to drop people interested in this technology had more access and freedom to make what they wanted. As of 2014, the price for commercial printers was still high with the cost being over $2,000.

The term &quot;3D printing&quot; originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer. More recently, the popular vernacular has started using the term to encompass a wider variety of additive-manufacturing techniques such as electron-beam additive manufacturing and selective laser melting. The United States and global technical standards use the official term &quot;additive manufacturing&quot; for this broader sense.

The most commonly used 3D printing process (46% ) is a material extrusion technique called fused deposition modeling, or FDM. While FDM technology was invented after the other two most popular technologies, stereolithography (SLA) and selective laser sintering (SLS), FDM is typically the most inexpensive of the three by a large margin, which lends to the popularity of the process.

=== 2020s ===
As of 2020, 3D printers have reached the level of quality and price that allows most people to enter the world of 3D printing. In 2020 decent quality printers can be found for less than US$200 for entry-level machines. These more affordable printers are usually fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers.

In November 2021 a British patient named Steve Verze received the world&#x27;s first fully 3D-printed prosthetic eye from the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.

In April 2024, the world&#x27;s largest 3D printer, the Factory of the Future 1.0 was revealed at the University of Maine. It is able to make objects 96 feet long, or 29 meters.

In 2024, researchers used machine learning to improve the construction of synthetic bone and set a record for shock absorption.

In July 2024, researchers published a paper in &quot;Advanced Materials Technologies&quot; describing the development of artificial blood vessels using 3D-printing technology, which are as strong and durable as natural blood vessels. The process involved using a rotating spindle integrated into a 3D printer to create grafts from a water-based gel, which were then coated in biodegradable polyester molecules.

== Benefits of 3D printing ==
Additive manufacturing or 3D printing has rapidly gained importance in the field of engineering due to its many benefits. The vision of 3D printing is design freedom, individualization, decentralization and executing processes that were previously impossible through alternative methods. Some of these benefits include enabling faster prototyping, reducing manufacturing costs, increasing product customization, and improving product quality.

Furthermore, the capabilities of 3D printing have extended beyond traditional manufacturing, like lightweight construction, or repair and maintenance with applications in prosthetics, bioprinting, food industry, rocket building, design and art and renewable energy systems. 3D printing technology can be used to produce battery energy storage systems, which are essential for sustainable energy generation and distribution.

Another benefit of 3D printing is the technology&#x27;s ability to produce complex geometries with high precision and accuracy. This is particularly relevant in the field of microwave engineering, where 3D printing can be used to produce components with unique properties that are difficult to achieve using traditional manufacturing methods.

Additive Manufacturing processes generate minimal waste by adding material only where needed, unlike traditional methods that cut away excess material. This reduces both material costs and environmental impact. This reduction in waste also lowers energy consumption for material production and disposal, contributing to a smaller carbon footprint.

== General principles ==

=== Modeling ===


3D printable models may be created with a computer-aided design (CAD) package, via a 3D scanner, or by a plain digital camera and photogrammetry software. 3D printed models created with CAD result in relatively fewer errors than other methods. Errors in 3D printable models can be identified and corrected before printing. The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to plastic arts such as sculpting. 3D scanning is a process of collecting digital data on the shape and appearance of a real object, and creating a digital model based on it.

CAD models can be saved in the stereolithography file format (STL), a de facto CAD file format for additive manufacturing that stores data based on triangulations of the surface of CAD models. STL is not tailored for additive manufacturing because it generates large file sizes of topology-optimized parts and lattice structures due to the large number of surfaces involved. A newer CAD file format, the additive manufacturing file format (AMF), was introduced in 2011 to solve this problem. It stores information using curved triangulations.

=== Printing ===

Before printing a 3D model from an STL file, it must first be examined for errors. Most CAD applications produce errors in output STL files, of the following types:
* holes
* faces normals
* self-intersections
* noise shells
* manifold errors
* overhang issues

A step in the STL generation known as &quot;repair&quot; fixes such problems in the original model. Generally, STLs that have been produced from a model obtained through 3D scanning often have more of these errors as 3D scanning is often achieved by point to point acquisition/mapping. 3D reconstruction often includes errors.

Once completed, the STL file needs to be processed by a piece of software called a &quot;slicer&quot;, which converts the model into a series of thin layers and produces a G-code file containing instructions tailored to a specific type of 3D printer (FDM printers). This G-code file can then be printed with 3D printing client software (which loads the G-code and uses it to instruct the 3D printer during the 3D printing process).

Printer resolution describes layer thickness and X–Y resolution in dots per inch (dpi) or micrometers (μm). Typical layer thickness is around , although some machines can print layers as thin as . X–Y resolution is comparable to that of laser printers. The particles (3D dots) are around in diameter. For that printer resolution, specifying a mesh resolution of and a chord length generates an optimal STL output file for a given model input file. Specifying higher resolution results in larger files without increase in print quality.
Construction of a model with contemporary methods can take anywhere from several hours to several days, depending on the method used and the size and complexity of the model. Additive systems can typically reduce this time to a few hours, although it varies widely depending on the type of machine used and the size and number of models being produced simultaneously.

=== Finishing ===

Though the printer-produced resolution and surface finish are sufficient for some applications, post-processing and finishing methods allow for benefits such as greater dimensional accuracy, smoother surfaces, and other modifications such as coloration.

The surface finish of a 3D-printed part can improved using subtractive methods such as sanding and bead blasting. When smoothing parts that require dimensional accuracy, it is important to take into account the volume of the material being removed.

Some printable polymers, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), allow the surface finish to be smoothed and improved using chemical vapor processes based on acetone or similar solvents.

Some additive manufacturing techniques can benefit from annealing as a post-processing step. Annealing a 3D-printed part allows for better internal layer bonding due to recrystallization of the part. It allows for an increase in mechanical properties, some of which are fracture toughness, flexural strength, impact resistance, and heat resistance. Annealing a component may not be suitable for applications where dimensional accuracy is required, as it can introduce warpage or shrinkage due to heating and cooling.

Additive or subtractive hybrid manufacturing (ASHM) is a method that involves producing a 3D printed part and using machining (subtractive manufacturing) to remove material. Machining operations can be completed after each layer, or after the entire 3D print has been completed depending on the application requirements. These hybrid methods allow for 3D-printed parts to achieve better surface finishes and dimensional accuracy.

The layered structure of traditional additive manufacturing processes leads to a stair-stepping effect on part-surfaces that are curved or tilted with respect to the building platform. The effect strongly depends on the layer height used, as well as the orientation of a part surface inside the building process. This effect can be minimized using &quot;variable layer heights&quot; or &quot;adaptive layer heights&quot;. These methods decrease the layer height in places where higher quality is needed.

Painting a 3D-printed part offers a range of finishes and appearances that may not be achievable through most 3D printing techniques. The process typically involves several steps, such as surface preparation, priming, and painting. These steps help prepare the surface of the part and ensuring the paint adheres properly.

Some additive manufacturing techniques are capable of using multiple materials simultaneously. These techniques are able to print in multiple colors and color combinations simultaneously and can produce parts that may not necessarily require painting.

Some printing techniques require internal supports to be built to support overhanging features during construction. These supports must be mechanically removed or dissolved if using a water-soluble support material such as PVA after completing a print.

Some commercial metal 3D printers involve cutting the metal component off the metal substrate after deposition. A new process for the GMAW 3D printing allows for substrate surface modifications to remove aluminium or steel.

=== Materials ===
Traditionally, 3D printing focused on polymers for printing, due to the ease of manufacturing and handling polymeric materials. However, the method has rapidly evolved to not only print various polymers but also metals and ceramics, making 3D printing a versatile option for manufacturing. Layer-by-layer fabrication of three-dimensional physical models is a modern concept that &quot;stems from the ever-growing CAD industry, more specifically the solid modeling side of CAD. Before solid modeling was introduced in the late 1980s, three-dimensional models were created with wire frames and surfaces.&quot; but in all cases the layers of materials are controlled by the printer and the material properties. The three-dimensional material layer is controlled by the deposition rate as set by the printer operator and stored in a computer file. The earliest printed patented material was a hot melt type ink for printing patterns using a heated metal alloy.

Charles Hull filed the first patent on August 8, 1984, to use a UV-cured acrylic resin using a UV-masked light source at UVP Corp to build a simple model. The SLA-1 was the first SL product announced by 3D Systems at Autofact Exposition, Detroit, November 1978. The SLA-1 Beta shipped in Jan 1988 to Baxter Healthcare, Pratt and Whitney, General Motors and AMP. The first production SLA-1 shipped to Precision Castparts in April 1988. The UV resin material changed over quickly to an epoxy-based material resin. In both cases, SLA-1 models needed UV oven curing after being rinsed in a solvent cleaner to remove uncured boundary resin. A post cure apparatus (PCA) was sold with all systems. The early resin printers required a blade to move fresh resin over the model on each layer. The layer thickness was 0.006 inches and the HeCd laser model of the SLA-1 was 12 watts and swept across the surface at 30 in per second. UVP was acquired by 3D Systems in January 1990.

A review of the history shows that a number of materials (resins, plastic powder, plastic filament and hot-melt plastic ink) were used in the 1980s for patents in the rapid prototyping field. Masked lamp UV-cured resin was also introduced by Cubital&#x27;s Itzchak Pomerantz in the Soldier 5600, Carl Deckard&#x27;s (DTM) laser sintered thermoplastic powders, and adhesive-laser cut paper (LOM) stacked to form objects by Michael Feygin before 3D Systems made its first announcement. Scott Crump was also working with extruded &quot;melted&quot; plastic filament modeling (FDM) and drop deposition had been patented by William E Masters a week after Hull&#x27;s patent in 1984, but he had to discover thermoplastic inkjets, introduced by Visual Impact Corporation 3D printer in 1992, using inkjets from Howtek, Inc., before he formed BPM to bring out his own 3D printer product in 1994.

=== Multi-material 3D printing ===

Efforts to achieve multi-material 3D printing range from enhanced FDM-like processes like VoxelJet to novel voxel-based printing technologies like layered assembly.

A drawback of many existing 3D printing technologies is that they only allow one material to be printed at a time, limiting many potential applications that require the integration of different materials in the same object. Multi-material 3D printing solves this problem by allowing objects of complex and heterogeneous arrangements of materials to be manufactured using a single printer. Here, a material must be specified for each voxel (or 3D printing pixel element) inside the final object volume.

The process can be fraught with complications, however, due to the isolated and monolithic algorithms. Some commercial devices have sought to solve these issues, such as building a Spec2Fab translator, but the progress is still very limited. Nonetheless, in the medical industry, a concept of 3D-printed pills and vaccines has been presented.
With this new concept, multiple medications can be combined, which is expected to decrease many risks. With more and more applications of multi-material 3D printing, the costs of daily life and high technology development will become inevitably lower.

Metallographic materials of 3D printing is also being researched. By classifying each material, CIMP-3D can systematically perform 3D printing with multiple materials.

=== 4D printing ===

Using 3D printing and multi-material structures in additive manufacturing has allowed for the design and creation of what is called 4D printing. 4D printing is an additive manufacturing process in which the printed object changes shape with time, temperature, or some other type of stimulation. 4D printing allows for the creation of dynamic structures with adjustable shapes, properties or functionality. The smart/stimulus-responsive materials that are created using 4D printing can be activated to create calculated responses such as self-assembly, self-repair, multi-functionality, reconfiguration and shape-shifting. This allows for customized printing of shape-changing and shape-memory materials.

4D printing has the potential to find new applications and uses for materials (plastics, composites, metals, etc.) and has the potential to create new alloys and composites that were not viable before. The versatility of this technology and materials can lead to advances in multiple fields of industry, including space, commercial and medical fields. The repeatability, precision, and material range for 4D printing must increase to allow the process to become more practical throughout these industries. 

To become a viable industrial production option, there are a few challenges that 4D printing must overcome. The challenges of 4D printing include the fact that the microstructures of these printed smart materials must be close to or better than the parts obtained through traditional machining processes. New and customizable materials need to be developed that have the ability to consistently respond to varying external stimuli and change to their desired shape. There is also a need to design new software for the various technique types of 4D printing. The 4D printing software will need to take into consideration the base smart material, printing technique, and structural and geometric requirements of the design.

== Processes and printers ==

ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of additive manufacturing (AM) processes within its meaning. They are:
* Vat photopolymerization
* Material jetting
* Binder jetting
* Powder bed fusion
* Material extrusion
* Directed energy deposition
* Sheet lamination

The main differences between processes are in the way layers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object. Others sometimes use standard, off-the-shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype. The main considerations in choosing a machine are generally speed, costs of the 3D printer, of the printed prototype, choice and cost of the materials, and color capabilities. Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive. However, less expensive printers can be used to make a mold, which is then used to make metal parts.

=== Material jetting ===
The first process where three-dimensional material is deposited to form an object was done with material jetting or as it was originally called particle deposition. Particle deposition by inkjet first started with continuous inkjet technology (CIT) (1950s) and later with drop-on-demand inkjet technology (1970s) using hot-melt inks. Wax inks were the first three-dimensional materials jetted and later low-temperature alloy metal was jetted with CIT. Wax and thermoplastic hot melts were jetted next by DOD. Objects were very small and started with text characters and numerals for signage. An object must have form and can be handled. Wax characters tumbled off paper documents and inspired a liquid metal recorder patent to make metal characters for signage in 1971. Thermoplastic color inks (CMYK) were printed with layers of each color to form the first digitally formed layered objects in 1984. The idea of investment casting with Solid-Ink jetted images or patterns in 1984 led to the first patent to form articles from particle deposition in 1989, issued in 1992.

=== Material extrusion ===
Some methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers. In fused filament fabrication, also known as fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material that harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Recently, FFF/FDM has expanded to 3-D print directly from pellets to avoid the conversion to filament. This process is called fused particle fabrication (FPF) (or fused granular fabrication (FGF) and has the potential to use more recycled materials.

=== Powder bed fusion ===
Powder bed fusion techniques, or PBF, include several processes such as DMLS, SLS, SLM, MJF and EBM. Powder bed fusion processes can be used with an array of materials and their flexibility allows for geometrically complex structures, making it a good choice for many 3D printing projects. These techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties similar to those of conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined. In addition to the previously mentioned methods, HP has developed the Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) which is a powder base technique, though no lasers are involved. An inkjet array applies fusing and detailing agents which are then combined by heating to create a solid layer.

=== Binder jetting ===
The binder jetting 3D printing technique involves the deposition of a binding adhesive agent onto layers of material, usually powdered, and then this &quot;green&quot; state part may be cured and even sintered. The materials can be ceramic-based, metal or plastic. This method is also known as inkjet 3D printing. To produce a part, the printer builds the model using a head that moves over the platform base to spread or deposit alternating layers of powder (plaster and resins) and binder. Most modern binder jet printers also cure each layer of binder. These steps are repeated until all layers have been printed. This green part is usually cured in an oven to off-gas most of the binder before being sintered in a kiln with a specific time-temperature curve for the given material(s).

This technology allows the printing of full-color prototypes, overhangs, and elastomer parts. The strength of bonded powder prints can be enhanced by impregnating in the spaces between the necked or sintered matrix of powder with other compatible materials depending on the powder material, like wax, thermoset polymer, or even bronze.

=== Stereolithography ===
Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the &quot;Objet PolyJet&quot; system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30 μm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100 nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs.

In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it in the shape of the layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer resin. Part of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the &quot;window&quot;), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow the resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder-fed directed energy process is similar to selective laser sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.

=== Computed axial lithography ===
Computed axial lithography is a method for 3D printing based on computerised tomography scans to create prints in photo-curable resin. It was developed by a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Unlike other methods of 3D printing it does not build models through depositing layers of material like fused deposition modelling and stereolithography, instead it creates objects using a series of 2D images projected onto a cylinder of resin. It is notable for its ability to build an object much more quickly than other methods using resins and the ability to embed objects within the prints.

=== Liquid additive manufacturing ===
Liquid additive manufacturing (LAM) is a 3D printing technique that deposits a liquid or high viscosity material (e.g. liquid silicone rubber) onto a build surface to create an object which then is vulcanised using heat to harden the object. The process was originally created by Adrian Bowyer and was then built upon by German RepRap.

A technique called &quot;programmable tooling&quot; uses 3D printing to create a temporary mold, which is then filled via a conventional injection molding process and then immediately dissolved.

=== Lamination ===
In some printers, paper can be used as the build material, resulting in a lower cost to print. During the 1990s some companies marketed printers that cut cross-sections out of special adhesive coated paper using a carbon dioxide laser and then laminated them together.

In 2005 Mcor Technologies Ltd developed a different process using ordinary sheets of office paper, a tungsten carbide blade to cut the shape, and selective deposition of adhesive and pressure to bond the prototype.

=== Directed-energy deposition (DED) ===

==== Powder-fed directed-energy deposition ====
In powder-fed directed-energy deposition (also known as laser metal deposition), a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The laser beam typically travels through the center of the deposition head and is focused on a small spot by one or more lenses. The build occurs on an X-Y table which is driven by a tool path created from a digital model to fabricate an object layer by layer. The deposition head is moved up vertically as each layer is completed. Some systems even make use of 5-axis or 6-axis systems (&quot;i.e.&quot; articulated arms) capable of delivering material on the substrate (a printing bed, or a pre-existing part) with few to no spatial access restrictions. Metal powder is delivered and distributed around the circumference of the head or can be split by an internal manifold and delivered through nozzles arranged in various configurations around the deposition head. A hermetically sealed chamber filled with inert gas or a local inert shroud gas (sometimes both combined) is often used to shield the melt pool from atmospheric oxygen, to limit oxidation and to better control the material properties. The powder-fed directed-energy process is similar to selective laser sintering, but the metal powder is projected only where the material is being added to the part at that moment. The laser beam is used to heat up and create a &quot;melt pool&quot; on the substrate, in which the new powder is injected quasi-simultaneously. The process supports a wide range of materials including titanium, stainless steel, aluminium, tungsten, and other specialty materials as well as composites and functionally graded materials. The process can not only fully build new metal parts but can also add material to existing parts for example for coatings, repair, and hybrid manufacturing applications. Laser engineered net shaping (LENS), which was developed by Sandia National Labs, is one example of the powder-fed directed-energy deposition process for 3D printing or restoring metal parts.

==== Metal wire processes ====
Laser-based wire-feed systems, such as laser metal deposition-wire (LMD-w), feed the wire through a nozzle that is melted by a laser using inert gas shielding in either an open environment (gas surrounding the laser) or in a sealed chamber. Electron beam freeform fabrication uses an electron beam heat source inside a vacuum chamber.

It is also possible to use conventional gas metal arc welding attached to a 3D stage to 3-D print metals such as steel, bronze and aluminium. Low-cost open source RepRap-style 3-D printers have been outfitted with Arduino-based sensors and demonstrated reasonable metallurgical properties from conventional welding wire as feedstock.

=== Selective powder deposition (SPD) ===
In selective powder deposition, build and support powders are selectively deposited into a crucible, such that the build powder takes the shape of the desired object and support powder fills the rest of the volume in the crucible. Then an infill material is applied, such that it comes in contact with the build powder. Then the crucible is fired up in a kiln at the temperature above the melting point of the infill but below the melting points of the powders. When the infill melts, it soaks the build powder. But it does not soak the support powder, because the support powder is chosen to be such that it is not wettable by the infill. If at the firing temperature, the atoms of the infill material and the build powder are mutually defusable, such as in the case of copper powder and zinc infill, then the resulting material will be a uniform mixture of those atoms, in this case, bronze. But if the atoms are not mutually defusable, such as in the case of tungsten and copper at 1100 °C, then the resulting material will be a composite. To prevent shape distortion, the firing temperature must be below the solidus temperature of the resulting alloy.

=== Cryogenic 3D printing ===
Cryogenic 3D printing is a collection of techniques that forms solid structures by freezing liquid materials while they are deposited. As each liquid layer is applied, it is cooled by the low temperature of the previous layer and printing environment which results in solidification. Unlike other 3D printing techniques, cryogenic 3D printing requires a controlled printing environment. The ambient temperature must be below the material&#x27;s freezing point to ensure the structure remains solid during manufacturing and the humidity must remain low to prevent frost formation between the application of layers. Materials typically include water and water-based solutions, such as brine, slurry, and hydrogels. Cryogenic 3D printing techniques include rapid freezing prototype (RFP), low-temperature deposition manufacturing (LDM), and freeze-form extrusion fabrication (FEF).

== Applications ==

3D printing or additive manufacturing has been used in manufacturing, medical, industry and sociocultural sectors (e.g. cultural heritage) to create successful commercial technology. More recently, 3D printing has also been used in the humanitarian and development sector to produce a range of medical items, prosthetics, spares and repairs. The earliest application of additive manufacturing was on the toolroom end of the manufacturing spectrum. For example, rapid prototyping was one of the earliest additive variants, and its mission was to reduce the lead time and cost of developing prototypes of new parts and devices, which was earlier only done with subtractive toolroom methods such as CNC milling, turning, and precision grinding. In the 2010s, additive manufacturing entered production to a much greater extent.

=== Food ===

Additive manufacturing of food is being developed by squeezing out food, layer by layer, into three-dimensional objects. A large variety of foods are appropriate candidates, such as chocolate and candy, and flat foods such as crackers, pasta, and pizza. NASA is looking into the technology in order to create 3D-printed food to limit food waste and to make food that is designed to fit an astronaut&#x27;s dietary needs. In 2018, Italian bioengineer Giuseppe Scionti developed a technology allowing the production of fibrous plant-based meat analogues using a custom 3D bioprinter, mimicking meat texture and nutritional values.

=== Fashion ===
3D printing has entered the world of clothing, with fashion designers experimenting with 3D-printed bikinis, shoes, and dresses. In commercial production, Nike used 3D printing to prototype and manufacture the 2012 Vapor Laser Talon football shoe for players of American football, and New Balance has 3D manufactured custom-fit shoes for athletes. 3D printing has come to the point where companies are printing consumer-grade eyewear with on-demand custom fit and styling (although they cannot print the lenses). On-demand customization of glasses is possible with rapid prototyping.

=== Transportation ===

In cars, trucks, and aircraft, additive manufacturing is beginning to transform both unibody and fuselage design and production, and powertrain design and production. For example, General Electric uses high-end 3D printers to build parts for turbines. Many of these systems are used for rapid prototyping before mass production methods are employed. Other prominent examples include:
* In early 2014, Swedish supercar manufacturer Koenigsegg announced the One:1, a supercar that utilizes many components that were 3D printed. Urbee is the first car produced using 3D printing (the bodywork and car windows were &quot;printed&quot;).
* In 2014, Local Motors debuted Strati, a functioning vehicle that was entirely 3D printed using ABS plastic and carbon fiber, except the powertrain.
* In May 2015 Airbus announced that its new Airbus A350 XWB included over 1000 components manufactured by 3D printing.
* In 2015, a Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet flew with printed parts. The United States Air Force has begun to work with 3D printers, and the Israeli Air Force has also purchased a 3D printer to print spare parts.
* In 2017, GE Aviation revealed that it had used design for additive manufacturing to create a helicopter engine with 16 parts instead of 900, with great potential impact on reducing the complexity of supply chains.

=== Firearms ===

AM&#x27;s impact on firearms involves two dimensions: new manufacturing methods for established companies, and new possibilities for the making of do-it-yourself firearms. In 2012, the US-based group Defense Distributed disclosed plans to design a working plastic 3D-printed firearm &quot;that could be downloaded and reproduced by anybody with a 3D printer&quot;. After Defense Distributed released their plans, questions were raised regarding the effects that 3D printing and widespread consumer-level CNC machining may have on gun control effectiveness. Moreover, armor-design strategies can be enhanced by taking inspiration from nature and prototyping those designs easily, using AM.

=== Health ===

Surgical uses of 3D printing-centric therapies began in the mid-1990s with anatomical modeling for bony reconstructive surgery planning. Patient-matched implants were a natural extension of this work, leading to truly personalized implants that fit one unique individual. Virtual planning of surgery and guidance using 3D printed, personalized instruments have been applied to many areas of surgery including total joint replacement and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction with great success. One example of this is the bioresorbable trachial splint to treat newborns with tracheobronchomalacia developed at the University of Michigan. The use of additive manufacturing for serialized production of orthopedic implants (metals) is also increasing due to the ability to efficiently create porous surface structures that facilitate osseointegration. The hearing aid and dental industries are expected to be the biggest areas of future development using custom 3D printing technology.

3D printing is not just limited to inorganic materials; there have been a number of biomedical advancements made possible by 3D printing. , 3D bio-printing technology has been studied by biotechnology firms and academia for possible use in tissue engineering applications in which organs and body parts are built using inkjet printing techniques. In this process, layers of living cells are deposited onto a gel medium or sugar matrix and slowly built up to form three-dimensional structures including vascular systems. 3D printing has been considered as a method of implanting stem cells capable of generating new tissues and organs in living humans. In 2018, 3D printing technology was used for the first time to create a matrix for cell immobilization in fermentation. Propionic acid production by &quot;Propionibacterium acidipropionici&quot; immobilized on 3D-printed nylon beads was chosen as a model study. It was shown that those 3D-printed beads were capable of promoting high-density cell attachment and propionic acid production, which could be adapted to other fermentation bioprocesses.

3D printing has also been employed by researchers in the pharmaceutical field. During the last few years, there has been a surge in academic interest regarding drug delivery with the aid of AM techniques. This technology offers a unique way for materials to be utilized in novel formulations. AM manufacturing allows for the usage of materials and compounds in the development of formulations, in ways that are not possible with conventional/traditional techniques in the pharmaceutical field, e.g. tableting, cast-molding, etc. Moreover, one of the major advantages of 3D printing, especially in the case of fused deposition modelling (FDM), is the personalization of the dosage form that can be achieved, thus, targeting the patient&#x27;s specific needs. In the not-so-distant future, 3D printers are expected to reach hospitals and pharmacies in order to provide on-demand production of personalized formulations according to the patients&#x27; needs.

3D printing has also been used for medical equipment. During the COVID-19 pandemic 3D printers were used to supplement the strained supply of PPE through volunteers using their personally owned printers to produce various pieces of personal protective equipment (i.e. frames for face shields).

=== Education ===

3D printing, and open source 3D printers, in particular, are the latest technologies making inroads into the classroom. Higher education has proven to be a major buyer of desktop and professional 3D printers which industry experts generally view as a positive indicator. Some authors have claimed that 3D printers offer an unprecedented &quot;revolution&quot; in STEM education. The evidence for such claims comes from both the low-cost ability for rapid prototyping in the classroom by students, but also the fabrication of low-cost high-quality scientific equipment from open hardware designs forming open-source labs. Additionally, Libraries around the world have also become locations to house smaller 3D printers for educational and community access. Future applications for 3D printing might include creating open-source scientific equipment.

=== Replicating archeological artifacts ===

In the 2010s, 3D printing became intensively used in the cultural heritage field for preservation, restoration and dissemination purposes. Many Europeans and North American Museums have purchased 3D printers and actively recreate missing pieces of their relics and archaeological monuments such as Tiwanaku in Bolivia. The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the British Museum have started using their 3D printers to create museum souvenirs that are available in the museum shops. Other museums, like the National Museum of Military History and Varna Historical Museum, have gone further and sell through the online platform Threeding digital models of their artifacts, created using Artec 3D scanners, in 3D printing friendly file format, which everyone can 3D print at home. Morehshin Allahyari, an Iranian-born U.S. artist, considers her use of 3D sculpting processes of re-constructing Iranian cultural treasures as feminist activism. Allahyari uses a 3D modeling software to reconstruct a series of cultural artifacts that were demolished by ISIS militants in 2014.

===Replicating historic buildings and architectural structures===

The application of 3D printing for the representation of architectural assets has many challenges. In 2018, the structure of Iran National Bank was traditionally surveyed and modeled in computer graphics software (specifically, Cinema4D) and was optimized for 3D printing. The team tested the technique for the construction of the part and it was successful. After testing the procedure, the modellers reconstructed the structure in Cinema4D and exported the front part of the model to Netfabb. The entrance of the building was chosen due to the 3D printing limitations and the budget of the project for producing the maquette. 3D printing was only one of the capabilities enabled by the produced 3D model of the bank, but due to the project&#x27;s limited scope, the team did not continue modelling for the virtual representation or other applications. In 2021, Parsinejad et al. comprehensively compared the hand surveying method for 3D reconstruction ready for 3D printing with digital recording (adoption of photogrammetry method).

The world&#x27;s first 3D-printed steel bridge was unveiled in Amsterdam in July 2021. Spanning 12 meters over the Oudezijds Achterburgwal canal, the bridge was created using robotic arms that printed over 4,500 kilograms of stainless steel. It took six months to complete.

===Soft actuators ===

3D printed soft actuators is a growing application of 3D printing technology that has found its place in the 3D printing applications. These soft actuators are being developed to deal with soft structures and organs, especially in biomedical sectors and where the interaction between humans and robots is inevitable. The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated by conventional methods that require manual fabrication of devices, post-processing/assembly, and lengthy iterations until the maturity of the fabrication is achieved. Instead of the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes, researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for the effective fabrication of soft actuators. Thus, 3D-printed soft actuators are introduced to revolutionize the design and fabrication of soft actuators with custom geometrical, functional, and control properties in a faster and inexpensive approach. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external joints, adhesives, and fasteners.

===Circuit boards===
Circuit board manufacturing involves multiple steps which include imaging, drilling, plating, solder mask coating, nomenclature printing and surface finishes. These steps include many chemicals such as harsh solvents and acids. 3D printing circuit boards remove the need for many of these steps while still producing complex designs. Polymer ink is used to create the layers of the build while silver polymer is used for creating the traces and holes used to allow electricity to flow. Current circuit board manufacturing can be a tedious process depending on the design. Specified materials are gathered and sent into inner layer processing where images are printed, developed and etched. The etch cores are typically punched to add lamination tooling. The cores are then prepared for lamination. The stack-up, the buildup of a circuit board, is built and sent into lamination where the layers are bonded. The boards are then measured and drilled. Many steps may differ from this stage however for simple designs, the material goes through a plating process to plate the holes and surface. The outer image is then printed, developed and etched. After the image is defined, the material must get coated with a solder mask for later soldering. Nomenclature is then added so components can be identified later. Then the surface finish is added. The boards are routed out of panel form into their singular or array form and then electrically tested. Aside from the paperwork that must be completed which proves the boards meet specifications, the boards are then packed and shipped. The benefits of 3D printing would be that the final outline is defined from the beginning, no imaging, punching or lamination is required and electrical connections are made with the silver polymer which eliminates drilling and plating. The final paperwork would also be greatly reduced due to the lack of materials required to build the circuit board. Complex designs which may take weeks to complete through normal processing can be 3D printed, greatly reducing manufacturing time.

===Hobbyists===
In 2005, academic journals began to report on the possible artistic applications of 3D printing technology. Off-the-shelf machines were increasingly capable of producing practical household applications, for example, ornamental objects. Some practical examples include a working clock and gears printed for home woodworking machines among other purposes. Websites associated with home 3D printing tended to include backscratchers, coat hooks, door knobs, etc. As of 2017, domestic 3D printing was reaching a consumer audience beyond hobbyists and enthusiasts. Several projects and companies are making efforts to develop affordable 3D printers for home desktop use. Much of this work has been driven by and targeted at DIY/maker/enthusiast/early adopter communities, with additional ties to the academic and hacker communities.

Sped on by decreases in price and increases in quality, an estimated 2 million people worldwide have purchased a 3D printer for hobby use.

== Legal aspects ==

=== Intellectual property ===

3D printing has existed for decades within certain manufacturing industries where many legal regimes, including patents, industrial design rights, copyrights, and trademarks may apply. However, there is not much jurisprudence to say how these laws will apply if 3D printers become mainstream and individuals or hobbyist communities begin manufacturing items for personal use, for non-profit distribution, or for sale.

Any of the mentioned legal regimes may prohibit the distribution of the designs used in 3D printing or the distribution or sale of the printed item. To be allowed to do these things, where active intellectual property was involved, a person would have to contact the owner and ask for a licence, which may come with conditions and a price. However, many patent, design and copyright laws contain a standard limitation or exception for &quot;private&quot; or &quot;non-commercial&quot; use of inventions, designs or works of art protected under intellectual property (IP). That standard limitation or exception may leave such private, non-commercial uses outside the scope of IP rights.

Patents cover inventions including processes, machines, manufacturing, and compositions of matter and have a finite duration which varies between countries, but generally 20 years from the date of application. Therefore, if a type of wheel is patented, printing, using, or selling such a wheel could be an infringement of the patent.

Copyright covers an expression in a tangible, fixed medium and often lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years thereafter. For example, a sculptor retains copyright over a statue, such that other people cannot then legally distribute designs to print an identical or similar statue without paying royalties, waiting for the copyright to expire, or working within a fair use exception.

When a feature has both artistic (copyrightable) and functional (patentable) merits when the question has appeared in US court, the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can be separated from the functional aspects of the item. In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing, for example, the design of a useful device to be registered (as a whole) as an industrial design on the understanding that, in case of unauthorized copying, only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent.

=== Gun legislation and administration ===

The US Department of Homeland Security and the Joint Regional Intelligence Center released a memo stating that &quot;significant advances in three-dimensional (3D) printing capabilities, availability of free digital 3D printable files for firearms components, and difficulty regulating file sharing may present public safety risks from unqualified gun seekers who obtain or manufacture 3D printed guns&quot; and that &quot;proposed legislation to ban 3D printing of weapons may deter, but cannot completely prevent their production. Even if the practice is prohibited by new legislation, online distribution of these 3D printable files will be as difficult to control as any other illegally traded music, movie or software files.&quot;

Attempting to restrict the distribution of gun plans via the Internet has been likened to the futility of preventing the widespread distribution of DeCSS, which enabled DVD ripping. After the US government had Defense Distributed take down the plans, they were still widely available via the Pirate Bay and other file sharing sites. Downloads of the plans from the UK, Germany, Spain, and Brazil were heavy. Some US legislators have proposed regulations on 3D printers to prevent them from being used for printing guns. 3D printing advocates have suggested that such regulations would be futile, could cripple the 3D printing industry and could infringe on free speech rights, with early pioneers of 3D printing professor Hod Lipson suggesting that gunpowder could be controlled instead.

Internationally, where gun controls are generally stricter than in the United States, some commentators have said the impact may be more strongly felt since alternative firearms are not as easily obtainable. Officials in the United Kingdom have noted that producing a 3D-printed gun would be illegal under their gun control laws. Europol stated that criminals have access to other sources of weapons but noted that as technology improves, the risks of an effect would increase.

=== Aerospace regulation ===
In the United States, the FAA has anticipated a desire to use additive manufacturing techniques and has been considering how best to regulate this process. The FAA has jurisdiction over such fabrication because all aircraft parts must be made under FAA production approval or under other FAA regulatory categories. In December 2016, the FAA approved the production of a 3D-printed fuel nozzle for the GE LEAP engine. Aviation attorney Jason Dickstein has suggested that additive manufacturing is merely a production method, and should be regulated like any other production method. He has suggested that the FAA&#x27;s focus should be on guidance to explain compliance, rather than on changing the existing rules, and that existing regulations and guidance permit a company &quot;to develop a robust quality system that adequately reflects regulatory needs for quality assurance&quot;.

== Health and safety ==
Polymer feedstock materials can release ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) if sufficiently heated, which in combination have been associated with adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health effects. In addition, temperatures of 190 °C to 260 °C are typically reached by an FFF extrusion nozzle, which can cause skin burns. Vat photopolymerization stereolithography printers use high-powered lasers that present a skin and eye hazard, although they are considered nonhazardous during printing because the laser is enclosed within the printing chamber.

3D printers also contain many moving parts that include stepper motors, pulleys, threaded rods, carriages, and small fans, which generally do not have enough power to cause serious injuries but can still trap a user&#x27;s finger, long hair, or loose clothing. Most desktop FFF 3D printers do not have any added electrical safety features beyond regular internal fuses or external transformers, although the voltages in the exposed parts of 3D printers usually do not exceed 12V to 24V, which is generally considered safe.

Research on the health and safety concerns of 3D printing is new and in development due to the recent proliferation of 3D printing devices. In 2017, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work published a discussion paper on the processes and materials involved in 3D printing, the potential implications of this technology for occupational safety and health and avenues for controlling potential hazards.

Noise level is measured in decibels (dB), and can vary greatly in home printers from 15 dB to 75 dB. Some main sources of noise in filament printers are fans, motors and bearings, while in resin printers the fans usually are responsible for most of the noise. Some methods for dampening the noise from a printer may be to install vibration isolation, use larger diameter fans, perform regular maintenance and lubrication, or use a soundproofing enclosure.

== Impact ==
Additive manufacturing, starting with today&#x27;s infancy period, requires manufacturing firms to be flexible, ever-improving users of all available technologies to remain competitive. Advocates of additive manufacturing also predict that this arc of technological development will counter globalization, as end users will do much of their own manufacturing rather than engage in trade to buy products from other people and corporations. The real integration of the newer additive technologies into commercial production, however, is more a matter of complementing traditional subtractive methods rather than displacing them entirely.

The futurologist Jeremy Rifkin claimed that 3D printing signals the beginning of a third industrial revolution, succeeding the production line assembly that dominated manufacturing starting in the late 19th century.

=== Social change ===

Since the 1950s, a number of writers and social commentators have speculated in some depth about the social and cultural changes that might result from the advent of commercially affordable additive manufacturing technology. In recent years, 3D printing has created a significant impact in the humanitarian and development sector. Its potential to facilitate distributed manufacturing is resulting in supply chain and logistics benefits, by reducing the need for transportation, warehousing and wastage. Furthermore, social and economic development is being advanced through the creation of local production economies.

Others have suggested that as more and more 3D printers start to enter people&#x27;s homes, the conventional relationship between the home and the workplace might get further eroded. Likewise, it has also been suggested that, as it becomes easier for businesses to transmit designs for new objects around the globe, so the need for high-speed freight services might also become less. Finally, given the ease with which certain objects can now be replicated, it remains to be seen whether changes will be made to current copyright legislation so as to protect intellectual property rights with the new technology widely available.

Some call attention to the conjunction of commons-based peer production with 3D printing and other low-cost manufacturing techniques. The self-reinforced fantasy of a system of eternal growth can be overcome with the development of economies of scope, and here, society can play an important role contributing to the raising of the whole productive structure to a higher plateau of more sustainable and customized productivity. Further, it is true that many issues, problems, and threats arise due to the democratization of the means of production, and especially regarding the physical ones. For instance, the recyclability of advanced nanomaterials is still questioned; weapons manufacturing could become easier; not to mention the implications for counterfeiting and on intellectual property. It might be maintained that in contrast to the industrial paradigm whose competitive dynamics were about economies of scale, commons-based peer production 3D printing could develop economies of scope. While the advantages of scale rest on cheap global transportation, the economies of scope share infrastructure costs (intangible and tangible productive resources), taking advantage of the capabilities of the fabrication tools. And following Neil Gershenfeld in that &quot;some of the least developed parts of the world need some of the most advanced technologies&quot;, commons-based peer production and 3D printing may offer the necessary tools for thinking globally but acting locally in response to certain needs.

Larry Summers wrote about the &quot;devastating consequences&quot; of 3D printing and other technologies (robots, artificial intelligence, etc.) for those who perform routine tasks. In his view, &quot;already there are more American men on disability insurance than doing production work in manufacturing. And the trends are all in the wrong direction, particularly for the less skilled, as the capacity of capital embodying artificial intelligence to replace white-collar as well as blue-collar work will increase rapidly in the years ahead.&quot; Summers recommends more vigorous cooperative efforts to address the &quot;myriad devices&quot; (e.g., tax havens, bank secrecy, money laundering, and regulatory arbitrage) enabling the holders of great wealth to &quot;a paying&quot; income and estate taxes, and to make it more difficult to accumulate great fortunes without requiring &quot;great social contributions&quot; in return, including: more vigorous enforcement of anti-monopoly laws, reductions in &quot;excessive&quot; protection for intellectual property, greater encouragement of profit-sharing schemes that may benefit workers and give them a stake in wealth accumulation, strengthening of collective bargaining arrangements, improvements in corporate governance, strengthening of financial regulation to eliminate subsidies to financial activity, easing of land-use restrictions that may cause the real estate of the rich to keep rising in value, better training for young people and retraining for displaced workers, and increased public and private investment in infrastructure development—e.g., in energy production and transportation.

Michael Spence wrote that &quot;Now comes a ... powerful, wave of digital technology that is replacing labor in increasingly complex tasks. This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in service sectors—think of ATMs, online banking, enterprise resource planning, customer relationship management, mobile payment systems, and much more. This revolution is spreading to the production of goods, where robots and 3D printing are displacing labor.&quot; In his view, the vast majority of the cost of digital technologies comes at the start, in the design of hardware (e.g. 3D printers) and, more importantly, in creating the software that enables machines to carry out various tasks. &quot;Once this is achieved, the marginal cost of the hardware is relatively low (and declines as scale rises), and the marginal cost of replicating the software is essentially zero. With a huge potential global market to amortize the upfront fixed costs of design and testing, the incentives to invest [in digital technologies] are compelling.&quot;

Spence believes that, unlike prior digital technologies, which drove firms to deploy underutilized pools of valuable labor around the world, the motivating force in the current wave of digital technologies &quot;is cost reduction via the replacement of labor&quot;. For example, as the cost of 3D printing technology declines, it is &quot;easy to imagine&quot; that production may become &quot;extremely&quot; local and customized. Moreover, production may occur in response to actual demand, not anticipated or forecast demand. Spence believes that labor, no matter how inexpensive, will become a less important asset for growth and employment expansion, with labor-intensive, process-oriented manufacturing becoming less effective, and that re-localization will appear in both developed and developing countries. In his view, production will not disappear, but it will be less labor-intensive, and all countries will eventually need to rebuild their growth models around digital technologies and the human capital supporting their deployment and expansion. Spence writes that &quot;the world we are entering is one in which the most powerful global flows will be ideas and digital capital, not goods, services, and traditional capital. Adapting to this will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially in human capital), and quite possibly models of employment and distribution.&quot;

Naomi Wu regards the usage of 3D printing in the Chinese classroom (where rote memorization is standard) to teach design principles and creativity as the most exciting recent development of the technology, and more generally regards 3D printing as being the next desktop publishing revolution.

A printer was donated to the Juan Fernandez Women&#x27;s Group in 2024, to support women in the remote community to be able to create parts to fix broken equipment, without having to wait for a ship to import the needed compenents.

=== Environmental change ===

The growth of additive manufacturing could have a large impact on the environment. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods such as CNC milling create products by cutting away material from a larger block. In contrast, additive manufacturing creates products layer-by layer, using the minimum required materials to create the product. This has the benefit of reducing material waste, which further contributes to energy savings by avoiding raw material production.

Life-cycle assessment of additive manufacturing has estimated that adopting the technology could further lower carbon dioxide emissions since 3D printing creates localized production, thus reducing the need to transport products and the emissions associated. AM could also allow consumers to create their own replacement parts to fix purchased products to extend the lifespan of purchased products.

By making only the bare structural necessities of products, additive manufacturing also has the potential to make profound contributions to lightweighting. The use of these lightweight components would allow for reductions in the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles and other forms of transportation. A case study on an airplane component made using additive manufacturing, for example, found that the use of the component saves 63% of relevant energy and carbon dioxide emissions over the course of the product&#x27;s lifetime.

However, the adoption of additive manufacturing also has environmental disadvantages. Firstly, AM has a high energy consumption compared to traditional processes. This is due to its use of processes such as lasers and high temperatures for product creation. Secondly, despite additive manufacturing reducing up to 90% of waste compared to subtractive manufacturing, AM can generate waste that is non-recyclable. For example, there are issues with the recyclability of materials in metal AM as some highly regulated industries such as aerospace often insist on using virgin powder in the creation of safety critical components. Additive manufacturing has not yet reached its theoretical material efficiency potential of 97%, but it may get closer as the technology continues to increase productivity.

Despite the drawbacks, research and industry are making further strides to support AM&#x27;s sustainability. Some large FDM printers that melt high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pellets may also accept sufficiently clean recycled material such as chipped milk bottles. In addition, these printers can use shredded material from faulty builds or unsuccessful prototype versions, thus reducing overall project wastage and materials handling and storage. The concept has been explored in the RecycleBot. There are also industrial efforts to produce metal powder from recycled metals.

<text>Moshe Hirsch () (born 1927—May 2, 2010) was an American–Palestinian Jewish activist. He was the leader of the anti-Zionist Neturei Karta. Hirsh served as the Minister of Religious Affairs and advisor of Jewish affairs to Yasser Arafat and later Mahmoud Abbas. Hirsch was described by Mahmoud Abbas&#x27; advisor as &quot;the leader of the Palestinian Jews,&quot; who are part of the Palestinian state. 
Hirsch was the son-in-law of the now deceased Neturei Karta founder Rabbi Aharon Katzenelbogen and his first wife, and was the leader of one of the movement&#x27;s factions. He was originally from New York City, and later moved to Jerusalem, though he never became an Israeli citizen.

Hirsch requested Arafat to grant the Jewish “Neturei Karta” community, as a religious minority in Palestine, the opportunity to obtain Palestinian passports once available. He expressed his refusal to carry an Israeli passport, highlighting his deep-seated belief that Zionism in Palestine represents a colonial enterprise seeking dominance over the region in partnership with Western powers, particularly the United States.

Following the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004 and Hamas&#x27;s victory in the 2006 Palestinian Legislative Council elections, Moshe pledged allegiance to the new leadership. He then visited the Legislative Council&#x27;s headquarters in Ramallah to demonstrate his unwavering support. This visit underscored that members of this Jewish movement identify as Palestinians living under occupation, much like the Arab population within the borders of Israel established in 1948.

==Family and personal life==
He was the father of three children. One of them is Rabbi Meir Hirsch. Meir who is his oldest son had taken over a lot of his fathers duties when he was reportedly suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Hirsch had one glass eye due to an injury sustained when someone threw acid in his face. According to his cousin, journalist Abraham Rabinovich, the incident had no link with Hirsch&#x27;s political activities but was connected to a real estate dispute.

== Death ==
Following Hirsch&#x27;s death, &quot;shiva&quot; visitors included senior Fatah members, including Adnan al-Husayni (who brought a personal letter of consolation from Mahmoud Abbas), Hatem Abdel Kader and Bilial A-Natsha.

<doc id="1305961" wikidata="Q2707148" url="?curid=1305961" title="New Found Power">
<text>New Found Power is the only studio album released by the American heavy metal supergroup Damageplan. The group was formed by brothers &quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrell Abbott (guitar) and Vinnie Paul Abbott (drums) after the breakup of their previous band, Pantera. This is the final album that was released during Darrell&#x27;s lifetime, before his death less than 10 months after the release.

&quot;New Found Power&quot; was also the original name of the band but was changed prior to the album&#x27;s release. The record sold 44,676 copies in its first week to debut at number 38 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

== Overview ==
The album was recorded at the Abbott brothers&#x27; backyard studio, Chasin&#x27; Jason in Arlington, Texas, where previous Pantera albums had been recorded. It also features guest appearances from vocalist Corey Taylor and guitarists Jerry Cantrell and Zakk Wylde, who had previously made live guest appearances with Pantera, as well as being close friends with all band members.

The single &quot;Save Me&quot; debuted on American radio on January 26, 2004. &quot;Breathing New Life&quot; served as the album&#x27;s music video debut and aired frequently on both &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and &quot;Uranium&quot; in early 2004. This was followed by videos for &quot;Save Me&quot; and &quot;Explode&quot;.

Many of the lyrical themes on &quot;New Found Power&quot; seem to deal with the breakup of Pantera, of which &quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrell Abbott and drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott were founding members along with Rex Brown.

&quot;New Found Power&quot; is guitarist Dimebag Darrell&#x27;s last studio appearance prior to his murder in December 2004. Following the death of Darrell Abbott during a Damageplan concert, there has been speculation about a follow-up to the album. In 2006 when Vinnie Paul was asked about the follow-up in an interview, he replied &quot;it will happen when the time is right. I want to stay focused where I am now.&quot; At the time, he was busy promoting his new band Hellyeah and their self-titled debut album. He also mentioned &quot;I think the fans would want to hear it, so yes I&#x27;d say within 10 years.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
&quot;New Found Power&quot; received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Christine Klunk of PopMatters commented &quot;I&#x27;m not in the least bit interested in where this band goes or what new and exciting ways they&#x27;ll think of to abuse the listeners.&quot; However, Allmusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus was more positive: he considered the album a &quot;blazing new beginning&quot; with Lachman emerging as a &quot;strong frontman&quot; and the band having &quot;too much solid material&quot; to be dragged down by a few weak songs.

<text>44 Parachute Regiment is the South African Army&#x27;s chief airborne infantry unit. It was created in 2000 by redesignating 44 Parachute Brigade, and is based at the Tempe military base near Bloemfontein.

== History ==
===Origin===

The first South African airborne unit was formed in August 1943, when a Parachute Platoon of the South African Air Force was established. However, this unit was disbanded before training could be completed.

There were no further attempts to establish any airborne units until 1961, when selected members of the South African Army received parachute training at RAF Abingdon. This was followed by the establishment of 1 Parachute Battalion under Commandant Willem Louw on 1 April 1961.

===The Border War===
On 26 August 1966, units of 1 Parachute Battalion (called Parabats) first participated in operations as part of the South African Border War in South-West Africa (now Namibia). This involvement was eventually to last for more than twenty years.

In April 1978 44 Parachute Brigade was established, with the addition of 2 and 3 Parachute Battalions.

On 4 May 1978 South Africa&#x27;s first major airborne operation (Operation Reindeer) took place. A large group of paratroopers, from 1,2 and 3 Battalions, attacked a large SWAPO base in Angola, successfully capturing it. &quot;(See Battle of Cassinga)&quot;.
Following the end of the Border War in 1989, the Brigade was scaled down slightly and began preparing for a new role, that of conducting operations internally in South Africa in order to quell increasing levels of violence between various political groups.

In January 1991 the Brigade conducted its first operational jump in an urban counterinsurgency role when 2 Parachute Battalion deployed to Natal as part of Operation Eardrum to quell the violence. The Brigade took part in many similar operations in the following years, helping to minimise the violence sufficiently to allow South Africa&#x27;s first democratic elections to go ahead in April 1994.

===Post 1994===
The Brigade&#x27;s first operational deployment in the post-1994 period was Operation Boleas in September 1998. It deployed two parachute companies and the Pathfinder Platoon to Lesotho to prevent a coup d&#x27;état.

During 1998, the decision was taken to redesignate the unit as a multi-battalion regiment, but it was only during the year 2000 that this change became official.

===Peacekeeping in Africa===
In 2001 regiment personnel formed the spearhead of the South African Protection Support Detachment deploying to Burundi.

In 2012, the regiments&#x27; 1st Battalion participated in the South African military assistance to the Central African Republic operation, where the unit suffered 13 killed, with 27 injured and one missing in action in an ambush conducted by Séléka rebels. The Battle of Bangui was, however, considered a success for the Parabats as they killed more than 3000 Seleka rebels.

In 2014 the Regiment contributed one company to the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade which fought a number of engagements in the DRC.

== Structure in 2004==
As of 2004, the Regiment consists of the following units:

* 44 Parachute Regiment Headquarters and Regimental Staff
* 1 Parachute Battalion (Regular Force)
* 2 Parachute Battalion (Reserve Force)
* 3 Parachute Battalion (Reserve Force)
* 44 Pathfinder Platoon
* 13 Signal Squadron
* 44 Medical Task Group (Detachment of 7 Medical Battalion Group, SAMHS)
* Parachute Training Wing (South Africa)
* Parachute Packing Wing
* 101 Air Supply Unit SAOSC (Lyttelton, Gauteng)

<text>Mina () is a South Korean television series that aired on KBS2 in 2001.

== Plot ==
Park Mina, a highly popular singer who&#x27;s won the hearts of many fans, gets into a car accident when her car swerves to avoid an oncoming vehicle. The car, which fell into a ditch, explodes and causes Mina to suffer second, third and fourth-degree burns on her body.

Mina&#x27;s manager Kang Joon-seo happens to find Kim Soo-ryun, who looks almost exactly like Mina. Joon-seo initially asks Soo-ryun to take Mina&#x27;s place for a short period of time until the real singer recovers. Soo-ryun agrees to the proposal because she badly needs money for her mother&#x27;s surgical fees and her brother&#x27;s tuition. After undergoing rigorous training from Joon-seo, Soo-ryun emerges as a near-perfect replica of Mina. However, Soo-ryun falls in love with Mina&#x27;s boyfriend Jung Tae-hoon, and becomes enamored with fame and fortune.

Meanwhile, the real Mina returns, but the plastic surgeons were unable to restore her original appearance. Joon-seo, thinking that fans would not accept her new face, refuses to allow Mina to continue her singing career. Mina goes on television to reveal her true identity, and as Tae-hoon begins to investigate, Soo-ryun and Joon-seo feel threatened.

Mina later learns that Soo-ryun is her identical twin sister, and they had been abandoned at a Catholic orphanage after birth.

Soo-ryun asks Tae-hoon to forgive her, but he rejects her when he realizes that Joon-seo and Soo-ryun conspired to prevent the real Mina from coming back.

Depressed, Soo-ryun attempts to commit suicide. But Joon-seo stops her in time and tells her to prepare her final performance as Mina.

<doc id="1306000" wikidata="Q506640" url="?curid=1306000" title="Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta">
<text>Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta (19 June 1417 – 7 October 1468) was an Italian condottiero and nobleman, a member of the House of Malatesta and lord of Rimini and Fano from 1432. He was widely considered by his contemporaries as one of the most daring military leaders in Italy and commanded the Venetian forces in the 1465 campaign against the Ottoman Empire. He was also a poet and patron of the arts.

==Biography==
Sigismondo Pandolfo was born in Brescia, northern Italy, the elder of the two illegitimate sons of Pandolfo III Malatesta and Antonia da Barignani. His younger brother Domenico, known as Malatesta Novello, was born in Brescia on 5 August 1418. An elder (and also illegitimate) half-brother, Galeotto Roberto Malatesta, born in 1411, was the issue of the relationship of their father Pandolfo III with Allegra de&#x27; Mori.

Following the family&#x27;s tradition, Sigismondo after the death of his father debuted as man-at-arms at the age of 13 against his relative Carlo II Malatesta, lord of Pesaro and Pope Martin V&#x27;s ally, who aimed to annex Rimini, Cesena and Fano to his territories. After his victory, Sigismondo obtained, together with his brothers Galeotto Roberto and Domenico, the title of Papal vicar for those cities. In 1431, though having inferior forces, he repelled another invasion by the Malatestas of Pesaro. When, soon afterwards, his elder brother abdicated, he became lord of Rimini, at the age of 15.

In 1432 he accepted the command of a papal corps, defeating the Spanish condottiero Sante Cirillo and thwarting Antonio I Ordelaffi&#x27;s attempt to capture Forlì (1435–36). However, the following year Sigismondo occupied the papal city of Cervia and was excommunicated; he was soon pardoned and created commander of the papal army. Later he fought in Romagna and the Marche alongside Francesco Sforza. In the meantime, in 1434 he married his niece Ginevra d&#x27;Este, Niccolò III&#x27;s legitimate daughter by his second wife Parisina Malatesta, first cousin of Sigismondo; they had one son, Galeotto Roberto Novello, who died as an infant, in 1438. On 12 October 1440, Ginevra died, and rumours spread that she had been poisoned by Sigismondo. Two years later he married Polissena Sforza, Francesco I&#x27;s illegitimate daughter; they had two children: a son, Galeotto, born in 1442 and who only lived a few months, and a daughter, Giovanna, born in 1444 and later Duchess of Camerino by marriage. In this period he fought several times against the other condottiero Niccolò Piccinino: first, in 1437, as a Venetian commander, he was defeated at Calcinara sull&#x27;Oglio. Later, while defending his lands from the papal invasion army led by Piccinino, Federico III da Montefeltro and Malatesta Novello, he crushed them at Monteluro, managing to obtain some territories of Pesaro, although the latter was successfully defeated by Federico&#x27;s forces.

In his restlessness, he betrayed Sforza twice, but he also betrayed his momentary ally against him, Niccolò Piccinino. Enmity against Sforza turned into true hatred when his father-in-law bought the signory of Pesaro from Carlo Malatesta. Therefore, Sigismondo allied with Pope Eugene IV and the Sforza duke of Milan. Later, he was hired by King Alfonso V of Naples, but soon afterwards received money for a &quot;condotta&quot; to be spent in the service of Florence against Alfonso. In 1445 he forced the Neapolitans to raise the siege of Piombino in Tuscany.

In 1449 his second wife Polissena died under mysterious circumstances. Francesco Sforza claimed that Sigismondo had her drowned by one of his servants, but this has remained unconfirmed. During his two marriages, he had numerous mistresses, but only two were well known: Vannetta dei Toschi, who bore him a son, Roberto, in 1441, and Isotta degli Atti, who bore him four children: Giovanni (who died in infancy), Margherita (later wife of Carlo di Fortebraccio), Sallustio and Antonia (later the first wife of Rodolfo Gonzaga, Lord of Castiglione delle Stiviere, who beheaded her in 1483 when she was discovered in adultery).

After 1449 Malatesta served variously under Venice, Florence, Siena, Naples and Sforza himself. The Peace of Lodi (1454), from which he was excluded, pushed the major Italian powers against him. His territories were repeatedly invaded by Aragonese, Venetian and Papal troops. In 1456 Sigismondo married Isotta degli Atti, his long-time mistress, and legitimized their three surviving children; the only son, Sallustio, was declared his heir. On 25 December 1460, a famous trial &quot;in absentia&quot; was held in Rome against Sigismondo. Pope Pius II, who considered him guilty of treachery towards Siena arising from his long-running feud with Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, excommunicated him, declaring him a heretic and attributing to Sigismondo a series of sins (incest, sodomy against his son Roberto and others) which smeared his reputation for centuries. In a unique ceremony, he was &quot;canonized into Hell&quot; with the curse, &quot;No mortal heretofore has descended into Hell with the ceremony of canonization. Sigi shall be the first deemed worthy of such honour.&quot;

Malatesta&#x27;s image was publicly burnt in Rome, and a &quot;de facto&quot; crusade was then launched against him, in a league including the pope, the king of Naples, the Duke of Milan and Federico da Montefeltro. He defeated the first contingent of Papal troops, led by Napoleone Orsini, on 2 July 1461 at Castelleone di Suasa. In 1462 he was able to take Senigallia, but was forced to flee to Fano after the arrival of Federico da Montefeltro. The latter followed and severely crushed him on 12 August 1462 near Senigallia at the mouth of the Cesano. The war ended in 1463, due to the intervention of Venice, with the loss of all Sigismondo&#x27;s territories apart from Rimini and a territory of some 8 kilometres around it: both, however, were assigned to return to the Papal States after his death. He then sought greater fortune as a general for Venice in its war against the Ottomans, as a field commander in the Peloponnesus (1464–1466). The Venetians granted him a contingent of 150 men to defend Rimini and his other lands during his absence.

In an attempt to reverse this situation, Sigismondo appears to have intended to murder Pius&#x27; successor, Pope Paul II (who had asked him to exchange Rimini for Spoleto and Camerino), in 1468, but he lost his nerve and returned to Rimini. He died in his residence of Castel Sismondo a few months later.

He was succeeded by his legitimated son and heir Sallustio, under the regency of his mother Isotta; but one year later (1469) his illegitimate son Roberto, also a skilled condottiero, managed briefly to maintain control over Rimini.

==Reputation, patron of art==

Sigismondo&#x27;s valour and skill as a general were widely recognized by his contemporaries. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia:
From his childhood he was a skilful and daring soldier, and throughout his life was regarded as almost the first captain in Italy.

He was not a religious man, and his Tempio Malatestiano, also known as San Francesco, built in Rimini, by Leon Battista Alberti and decorated by artists including Piero della Francesca and Agostino di Duccio, was essentially a lay monument to Isotta degli Atti, his lover and third wife. It was a landmark Renaissance building, being the first church to use the Roman triumphal arch as part of its structure. Sigismondo also built a notable series of fortifications in his Romagna possessions, including the &quot;Rocche&quot; (&quot;Castles&quot;) of Rimini and Fano.

Malatesta&#x27;s reputation was largely based on Pius II&#x27;s perception of him, although numerous contemporary chronicles described him as a tyrant and a womanizer: he delved into &quot;rape, adultery, and incest&quot;. Italian Renaissance historian Francesco Guicciardini defined him &quot;enemy of every peace and well-living&quot;. His deeds and political manoeuvers were characterized by all the play of violence, intrigues and subtleties typical of Renaissance Italy; however, Sigismondo was well aware of his sins, and tried to justify them in a series of love sonnets dedicated to Isotta.

==Legacy==
In 1906, Edward Hutton published the historical novel &quot;Sigismondo Malatesta&quot;, mostly sympathetic to its hero. It was slightly revised and reprinted under the title &quot;The Mastiff of Rimini&quot; in 1926. The title of this book may be partly responsible for the notion that Sigismondo was known as &quot;the Wolf of Rimini&quot; by contemporaries or indeed subsequently at any point before the 21st century when this sobriquet has gained some ground. In fact, there is no evidence for its use in his lifetime and it cannot be found in any mainstream historical or biographical text on Sigismondo predating the Internet. Though it appears in chapter four (page 112) of art historian Kenneth Clark&#x27;s 1969 book &quot;Civilisation,&quot; released to accompany the 13-part BBC series of the same name. (&quot;...in the neighbouring state was Sigismondo Malatesta, the wolf of Rimini, who did things that even the most advanced theatrical producer would hesitate to put on the stage.&quot; Clark, 1969, p. 112)

Hutton&#x27;s novel and Charles Emile Yriarte&#x27;s &quot;Un condottiere au XV Siècle&quot; (1882) were among the main sources of American poet Ezra Pound&#x27;s Malatesta Cantos (The Cantos 8–11), first published in 1923. These are an admiring albeit fragmentary account of Malatesta&#x27;s career as a warrior, lover and patron.

Largely influenced by Pound, as well as by C. G. Jung, the critic Adrian Stokes devoted a study, &quot;The Stones of Rimini&quot; (1934), to the art created at Sigismondo&#x27;s court.

Early in his writing career, E. M. Forster attempted a historical novel about Malatesta and Gemistus Pletho, but was not satisfied with the result and never published it - though he kept the manuscript and later showed it to Naomi Mitchison.

Henry de Montherlant&#x27;s play &quot;Malatesta&quot; (1946) is about the end of Malatesta&#x27;s life and his intrigues with Paul II.

<doc id="1306012" wikidata="Q708411" url="?curid=1306012" title="Melody of Oblivion">
<text>is a 2004 Japanese anime television series planned by Gainax and animated by J.C.Staff. The series originally aired between April 7, 2004, and September 21, 2004, on TBS.

==Production==

&quot;The Melody of Oblivion&quot; is a series rife with cultural references ranging from Zen archery and Bushido to the Bible&#x27;s Book of Revelation, stories of Greek Mythology, and images from Borge&#x27;s &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot; can be seen in the series.

Melody of Oblivion&#x27;s premise is that in the 20th century, humanity waged and lost a war against beings known only as the &quot;Monsters&quot;. In the 21st century, the &quot;Monsters&quot; rule the earth, but they have reconstructed society such that virtually no one born after the war ended is aware that it ever happened. Children are disappearing mysteriously. Only the &quot;Warriors of Melos&quot; are still fighting against the &quot;Monsters&quot;. The series focuses on Bocca, a teenager who chooses the path of the Warrior. In doing so, he gains the power to fight back at the horrors he sees, but it costs him his place in society.

Melos Warriors are the only ones who can see the ephemeral &quot;Melody&quot;, personified as a girl who appears at important times and shows emotion but does not speak. The Melos, as they are also referred to, fight primarily with bows and arrows infused with the energies of their spirit (seemingly described in Italian words and phrases used in musical notation). The visible marks (Sacred Scars) that they employ in this infusion process appear as tattoos on their person.

The Melos Warriors are aided by devices called &quot;Aibar machines&quot; (could also be transliterated as &quot;Aiba-Machine&quot;), which are essentially futuristic motorcycles with many additional capabilities. (&#x27;Aiba&#x27; or &#x27;Aibar&#x27; are transliterations for a word in Japanese meaning &#x27;Favorite Horse.&#x27;) The process of bonding a Warrior of Melos and an Aibar machine involves a symbolic naming of the bike by the one who is to ride it. Thereafter, the Aibar machine follows voice commands. All Aibar machines are at least minimally sentient, while some possess fully human-like intelligence. As such, they can function mostly or completely independently of their drivers when need be.

Opposing the Melos Warriors are the Monsters themselves and their human lackeys, the &quot;Monster Union&quot;. The former are always shown as normal looking human beings, however this is not what they truly look like. If a normal person (one who is not a Melos Warrior) looks at their true form, they will automatically transmogrify into a bizarre object (such as stone statues or puppets, but varying with whatever monster is being viewed.) It should also be noted that all the monsters mirror creatures of Greek Mythology, such as Horu, the first monster featured, who is referred to by Kurofune as a &quot;disgusting cow&quot; and is said to have been sealed in a labyrinth. This, along with the fact that a pair of bull horns and legs manifest when he is around, implies he is the legendary Minotaur. Several other featured monsters are Medusa, Hecate, Talos, and Pan. All monsters seem to have some control over reality itself and can only be killed by Melos Arrows.

The Monster Union, which is part Satanic cult and part ultra-fascist secret society, is composed of people who have been given power and authority in exchange for providing a steady supply of human sacrifices to their Monster overlords, and keeping the majority of humanity in the dark as to who holds the real power and what really goes on in the world. The process of imbuing Monster Union members with their powers leaves a visible mark on the body identical to a hot iron brand mark.

Monster Union leaders employ machines called robot-monsters in combat, but in contrast to the Melos Warriors, there is no standard design among these machines aside from the fact that all seem to be shaped like animals from the Chinese zodiac. The names of these robots are also in Chinese.

The contrast between the Monster Union members and the Melos Warriors is suggestive of the text in Revelations where it refers to people being marked by Heaven and being marked by Hell.

Melody of Oblivion has a very distinctive soundtrack featuring prominent virtuoso violin by Hijiri Kuwano and acoustic guitar solos and other classical-style music. The music was composed and arranged by Yoshikazu Suo and Hijiri Kuwano. The theme music is titled &quot;The Spirit of Flamenco&quot;. There are also more disturbing synth and amplified guitar pieces during scenes of creeping horror. The show itself is also full of musical references, from the Melos Warriors&#x27; given names (Kurofune Ballad being the most obvious) to the Italian musical vocabulary which flashes on the Melos Warrior &#x27;targeting interface&#x27; during battle (&quot;animato&quot;, &quot;con fuoco&quot;, &quot;passionato&quot;, &quot;energico&quot;, etc.).

==Characters==

===Humans===
:
: The main character. Brave, determined and equipped with a heart for adventure, Bocca is not your average school boy. In fact, he does badly in school and is disliked by his teachers. He eventually drops out to pursue his dreams of becoming a Melos Warrior, leaving behind the old and familiar, including his parents and brother. Bocca was a rebellious member of the archery club (the students are discouraged from using actual arrows since the monsters are trying to discourage the development of such skills) who longed to be a warrior to fight against the injustices he saw in the world.
Although people classify monsters as myth and tell Bocca to stay away from the old man who loiters near his school, he befriends the old man named Tsunagi, who is actually a scientist. Bocca also worked part-time for him at his auto-shop. Bocca soon meets Sayoko who tells him she is looking for a warrior; hearing this gives Bocca new hope for what he wants to do in life. When the warrior Kurofune (the same warrior Sayoko was looking for) goes to see Tsunagi, Bocca learns that Tsunagi was the leading scientist of aibanetic technology and an ally of the warriors. Later that day Bocca witnessed a battle between Hor and Kurofune, which awoke the possibility to become a warrior within him. When Kurofune leaves to continue on with his journey, Bocca and Sayoko decide to go after him. The series then follows Bocca&#x27;s journey as he sees the damage the monsters have done, learns of the humans who have pledged allegiance to them, meets other Melos Warriors and develops a romantic relationship with Sayoko. His Melos tattoo is on his left arm, and his Aibar machine is Elan Vital. His command for his Melos arrow is &quot;Flush.&quot; His bow was originally the bow he used for the archery club, and when it got broken, it was replaced by the handle bars of his Ivermachine.
:
: A girl who travels with Bocca to seek her love, Kurofune. She was given as a sacrifice to the monsters by her parents to improve her brother&#x27;s chances of becoming a Monster Union agent. Kurofune rescued her and she fell in love with him. She ran away from the home Kurofune placed her in to chase after him. On her wrists she wears the chains that bound her as a sacrifice and with them she can track Kurofune. They will point to wherever Kurofune is if she is lucky and there&#x27;s nothing standing in the way of her and Kurofune. During the journey, Sayoko develops a relationship with Bocca.

: Although her identity as a runaway child is the first facet of her character that is introduced to viewers, Sayoko is better known as daring, sensitive girl who is ready to risk all for love. She also has pick-pocketing skills to rival a professional, which helps her survive and bring her to Bocca. They later become friends when she realize that Bocca is a Melos Warrior, and decides to follow him so that she can look for Kurofune, whom she is initially in love with. Around Sayoko&#x27;s left wrist is a red chain that vibrates and pulls her in the direction of Kurofune when he uses his power.
Bocca says that Sayoko is a “girl who belong to a world of sunlight”, but despite being generally cheerful in disposition, Sayoko&#x27;s past is marred by a dark truth. Her parents always loved her brother more than her. When her brother grew up, Sayoko was sacrificed to help her brother become a member of the Monster Union and Kurofune saved her from it. That was when Sayoko fell for him. Together, Bocca and Sayoko traverse many monster-controlled areas, delving into the monsters&#x27; network and hierarchy. Amidst the conflicts and chaos, Bocca and Sayoko grow closer and find that their fondness for each other had developed into something more than friendship.
:
: The first Melos Warrior to appear, and Bocca&#x27;s inspiration. Instead of a bow, he wields a crossbow. His aibar machine is Jaguar Sun. His Melos tattoo is on his left arm. His command for his Melos arrow is &quot;Flush&quot; (same as Bocca&#x27;s.) He uses a bow gun.
:
: A quiet girl who is proficient with the bow. One will think that all Melos Warrior who find out about their powers would embrace their identities immediately, but not Toune’s. She first appeared as someone who can fight monsters, produce a Singing Chord, and seems to know a great deal about Melos Warrior. All she seemingly lacks are the tattoo and an Aibar Machine. In her conversation with Bocca, Toune disclose her hatred for Melos Warriors, and despise what she calls the arrogance of those who ride on Aibar Machines.
However, it soon becomes clear that her hatred for the Melos is a veneer to protect her from the truth that she is unwilling to accept: The boy she is in love with, Sky Blue, is really an Aibar Machine. After overcoming this, she finally slips into her role of a Melos warrior and mounts Sky Blue to travel to other places. Her tattoo is hidden on inner thigh of her right leg, explaining why Bocca thought she was not a Melos Warrior at first. 
Her Aibar is Sky Blue, an earlier model of the Unicorn-series. His first appearance in the series portrayed him to be a devil by Millionaire Beaver. Her command for her Melos arrow is &quot;Straight flush.&quot; Her bow is a wooden bow that she carries around.
:
: A very young and playful girl, a feisty girl with risqué humor packaged in a petite frame. She may be young for a Melos Warrior, but she is just as masterful and confident as the other Melos Warrior. Her last name is the Italian word for lullaby.
A Monster Union Agent kidnapped her from her parents in the toy section of a department store. She managed to escape before she could be sacrificed; however, to this day she cannot remember who her parents were or where she lived. She is accompanied by three Unicorn-series aibar machines: Hikari, Nick, and Kuron. They came together when Koko awakened them. She had wanted to free all of the Unicorn-series Aibar Machines, but had no chance to so she set these three free and gave them names. Together they form the armed theatrical group Chentauro. Upon meeting Bocca and his friends, fighting monsters and uncovering mysteries together, she was reunited with her father, the Prime Minister. Misadventure has it that they only come together when he was at the brink of death. Father and Daughter never get to know each other beyond physical appearance. Her Melos tattoo is on her right cheek. Her command for her Melos arrow is &quot;Four card.&quot; Her bow is formed from a stick that she carries, which expands to a bow at her command.
:
: An old man who owns a repair shop that Bocca worked at. Kurofune comes to him to have his aibar machine, Jaguar Sun, repaired. When the authorities arrive after Kurofune fights Hor, Saburou flees and joins the armed theater group, Chentaruo (this is not known until later in the series in episode 8–10). When Bocca meets Saburou again, it is revealed Saburou was a scientist who helped in the development of Aibar Machines and the Metronome, the space fortress that gives the Aibar Machines the ability to fly, and was supposed to destroy all monsters.
:
: A girl whose physical body is confined at an elusive area called the &quot;Oblivion Playhouse&quot; (also translated as &quot;Melody Theatre&quot;), but can project her image so Melos Warriors can see her. She guides and supports them, although her capacity for communication seems to be very limited. It is rumored among Melos Warriors that if her physical form can be located and resuscitated, she could unlock a power capable of wiping the Monsters off the face of the planet.

===Monsters===
; Horu / Minotaur
: Horu is the first monster Bocca meets in Melody of Oblivion, and is also the most recurring monster in the series. He is said to have been sealed in a labyrinth, but claims that he was able to leave his prison when he discovered that everything &quot;is all part of the labyrinth&quot; He holds a long-standing grudge against Kurofune. Like all monsters, he has a broad, albeit nebulous, range of abilities. He is seen in the anime to warp space and time around him, teleport, and is known to cause the stars to vanish for periods of time. Whenever he is in the area, a pair of bullhorns is seen somewhere close. He is accompanied by a small &quot;toy&quot; bus that he implements in his attack by transforming it to life-size, making it grow the horns and legs of a bull, and ramming it into his opponent. (In the past, he was seen to use a similar attack with a Jeep in lieu of a bus.) He is often chewing cud, which, along with other elements of his design such as the bullhorns and labyrinth, is supposed to imply that he is the Minotaur of Greek Mythology. (In fact, the walls of the labyrinth he was trapped in have murals on them depicting the birth of the Minotaur. Also, another way to translate his name is &quot;Hol,&quot; a reference to Holstein cattle.) Horu is unique among monsters in that he gains sustenance by reverting to his true form (which is never seen on camera) and physically devouring the children who are sacrificed to him. This is excruciatingly (and eternally) painful for his victims because he constantly regurgitates and masticates them, as a cow does with its food. Those that see him in his true form immediately and irreversibly transform into puppets.

; The Girl With Red Hair / Medusa:
: The most childish and unpredictable of all the monsters featured. She appears as a young red-haired girl. Her transport of choice is a large cruise-liner called &quot;The Hebihanabi,&quot; or &quot;Snake Fireworks ship,&quot; that can move on land or sea, and is always accompanied by a thick fog. Her sacrifices are turned into stone statues through looking upon her true form, and are either kept in her onboard private collection, or used to decorate the cities under her command (she seems to have a preference for young and beautiful boys.) During one scene in the anime, bunch of snakes are scattered around after she throws her head at a mob of angry parents, implying that she is made out of snakes. One of her oddest features is that she is always accompanied by a servant whose voice is heard, but who never appears onscreen. Whether this servant is another monster or in fact an extension of her power is unknown. She was the monster that scouted out the Monster Union members Midnight Hiyoko and Millionaire Beaver, although she may have found others as well. Like all monsters, her powers are difficult to gauge, and she has an unquestionably evil nature. She is referred to as Medusa by other monsters, which goes along with the fact that she is associated with snakes, can petrify others at will and lastly, when she removed her head it was likely referencing the legend of when Perseus decapitated Medusa in combat, and later used her head (or rather her petrifying eyes) as a weapon. On top of that, The Monster king directly referred to her by the name, Medusa.

; Tamakorogashi / Hecate
: Or &quot;Ball-Roller&quot; is the third most featured monster in the story, and seems to be the most calculating. She is the monster that is noted to be the one that scouted the union agent, Hustle Monkey. She appears in the form of a young woman with green hair held in pig-tails by bowling ball shaped hair clips. She is always accompanied by a ferocious looking black dog that acts like her guardian. This dog is probably a part of her true form. As her hair clips may indicate, she is fond of bowling and prefers to play in a bowling alley of her own creation that is made out of hearses. People who view her balls and pins are assaulted by visions of the people they have wronged. It is shown that she turns her sacrifices into bowling balls (she actually orders her sacrifices based on their weight, so that the ball&#x27;s weight is more comfortable for her to throw), but it is unknown as to whether or not this also applies to the pins. The monster, Pan, called her, Hecate, when they met up at the Parthenon. This goes along with her dog since black dogs were regularly sacrificed to the Witch-Goddess.

; Pan
: Not much is known about him, the only information is that he is a boy who is wearing glasses and plays a flute. He seems to be interested in Medusa. Pan is a human with goat legs and horns.

; Talos
: Talos can only be seen once for a brief moment. Talos appears to look like a sumotori and he guards the Island of Monsters.

; Monster King Solomon III aka Solo
: The current Monster King, he is a former Melos warrior. After defeating the previous Monster King, the Melody of Oblivion told him that the monsters would attack the humans indiscriminately. And if every monster were to be defeated, then humans would turn into monsters. The only way to prevent it would be for Solo to take up the role of Monster King himself. He pleads with Bocca to join him as his equal, to help relieve the extreme loneliness of his position. Solomon goes so far as to offer Bocca half of the world to control if he would only join him. He keeps the Melody of Oblivion in chains at his palace on the Island of Monsters. Solo is also riddled with guilt over what he has done to protect people. He has the ability to instantly hypnotise humans and control them into doing what every Solo desires. He uses this ability to kill the Prime Minister of Japan.

<text>Suliko (, ) is a Georgian unisex name meaning &quot;soul&quot;. It is also the title of a love poem written in 1895 by Akaki Tsereteli, which became widely known throughout the Soviet Union as a song performed with music composed by Varinka Tsereteli (in 1895). In that form it was often performed on radio during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule, reputedly because it was his favorite. It was translated to and performed in multiple languages including Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Romanian, English, German, Basque, Chinese, and Hebrew.

<doc id="1306023" wikidata="Q3460580" url="?curid=1306023" title="Crymych">
<text>Crymych () is a village of around 800 inhabitants and a community (population 1,739) in the northeast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. It is situated approximately above sea level at the eastern end of the Preseli Mountains, on the old Tenby to Cardigan turnpike road, now the A478.

The village developed around the former Crymmych Arms railway station on the now-closed Whitland to Cardigan Railway, nicknamed &quot;Cardi Bach&quot; (Little Cardi).

Crymych, which is twinned with Plomelin in Brittany, has an elected community council. The village has given its name to an electoral ward of Pembrokeshire that encompasses the villages of Crymych itself and Eglwyswrw. The community includes Hermon, Glandwr, Glogue and Llanfyrnach.

==History==

The name Crymych translates into English as &quot;crooked stream&quot; referring to the River Taf which rises in the high ground above the village and takes a sharp turn in the valley at the north end of the village.

Evidence of prehistoric occupation in the community is the Megalithic burial mound known as Crymych Wayside Barrow.

First mentioned in an account of the Cemais Hundreds of 1468, Crymych has for centuries been an area of livestock farming. 

Other than the &quot;Crymych Arms&quot; public house, which dates from at least 1861 but possibly as early as 1812, little existed at the spot before the extension of the Whitland and Taf Vale Railway to Crymych in 1874. The community then grew rapidly as a service and transport centre for the surrounding uplands, and acquired a reputation as the &quot;Wild West of West Wales&#x27;, reflected in the tongue-in-cheek appellation of &quot;Cowbois Crymych&quot; by which residents are sometimes known.

The village was sometimes referred to as Crymmych Arms, after the name of the station, for example in a report of an Eisteddfod in 1876.

The agricultural show was first held in 1909, and was equally successful in subsequent years. A regional livestock market existed in the village for many years; a new purpose-built site was developed north of the village, also accommodating a number of other traders.

Crymych War Memorial, which covers Eglwyswrw, Blaenffos, Llanfyrnach, Hermon and Glogue, records the names of 50 people who lost their lives in World War I and 17 in World War II.

Crymych Market Hall was opened in 1919; its present capacity is 500 (standing) or 250 (seated). It was built as a result of the formation of the Market Hall Company Ltd in 1911. During World War II it functioned as an evacuee centre, a shooting range for the Home Guard and a social centre for American troops stationed locally while they trained in the Preseli Mountains. In 1944 two Cardigan schoolboys were killed near Crymych by unexploded ordnance.

It was announced in July 2023 that the &quot;Crymych Arms&quot;, which had been closed for 18 months, was to be reopened following a community grant of £210,000 from the UK government.

==Education==
Crymych&#x27;s status as &quot;capital&quot; of the Preselau was confirmed in 1958, when Ysgol y Preseli, a secondary school covering a wide district, was opened. In 1996, the school became Pembrokeshire&#x27;s first Welsh-medium comprehensive school, and the number of pupils on its roll has doubled since its launch. In spite of a large influx of English immigrants to the area since the 1970s, Crymych retains a strong identity based on the Welsh language and Welsh culture.

Ysgol y Preseli has about 1,000 pupils. The school had a GCSE pass rate (based on 5 GCSEs, grades A-C) of 72% in 2002, according to Estyn. The corresponding figure in 2000 was 75%, which put it in 7th place in the country. It is consistently in the top 10% of secondary schools in Wales. It is also the best performing secondary school in Pembrokeshire.

==Worship==

Crymych stands at the meeting point of three (formerly Anglican) parishes: Llanfair-Nant-Gwyn to the north, Penrydd to the east and Llanfyrnach to the south. Of these, only Llanfyrnach parish (now Church in Wales) remains active.

The two chapels in the village are Antioch Welsh Independent Chapel, built in 1845 and restored in 1874 and 1927, and Seion Welsh Baptist Church, built in 1900.

==Culture==
Crymych and District Choir performs locally, nationally and internationally. Bois y Frenni is another local choir whose history dates from World War II. There is a thriving and successful youth activity group in Aelwyd Crymych whose activities range across the whole spectrum of the arts. Crymych is twinned with Plomelin in Brittany.

==Sport==

Crymych is home to Crymych RFC, a rugby union team formed in 1984 and a cricket club which fields sides in the third and sixth divisions of the Pembrokeshire Cricket League. &quot;Ras Frenni&quot; running road race (over 4 and 8 miles) was held for the 23rd time in July 2014.

== Notable people ==
* Daniel John Davies (1885–1970), an Independent minister and Welsh language poet from Pentre Galar
* Claire Jones (born 1985), a Welsh harpist and Official Harpist to the Prince of Wales from 2007 to 2011
* Rhodri Davies (born 1991), a Welsh rugby union player, scrum-half for the Dragons RFC
* Garan and Ioan Croft (born 2001), amateur boxers, reside in the village

==Other amenities==

Aside from the livestock market, Crymych has a veterinary practice, fire and police stations, doctor&#x27;s surgery, pharmacy, petrol station, post office and numerous other businesses, shops and trade premises.

Crymych Market Hall is used regularly for concerts, eisteddfodau, meetings, fairs and auctions.

A major redevelopment of the former market site, &quot;Bro Preseli&quot;, was completed in 2014 and includes accommodation for the elderly, a medical centre and a day centre serving the wider community. The complex is a joint venture between Pembrokeshire County Council, Hywel Dda Local Health Board and Family Housing Association Wales.

Since the closure of Crymych&#x27;s railway station to passengers in 1962, and freight the following year, the nearest station has been at Clunderwen, to the south. There are bus services to destinations in Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire.

==Nearby settlements and structures==
There are 15 listed structures in Crymych community, including several places of worship.

To the southeast of Crymych, near the hamlet of Glandwr, is Lammas Ecovillage, a low-impact housing development. Other nearby settlements are Eglwyswen, Hermon, Pentre Galar and Hebron.

The Preseli TV and radio transmitting station is about SSW of Crymych. The mast, being tall and on land which is above sea level, is visible from a long distance away on a clear day.

<text>Prince Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł (, ; 13 June 1702 – 15 May 1762) was a Polish-Lithuanian noble. A member of the aristocratic Radziwiłł family, he was frequently referred to by his sobriquet (known from his idiolect phrase) Rybeńko (Žuvelė, Рыбанька), to distinguish him from the other Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł. Ordynat of Niasviž and Olyka, owner of Biržai, Dubingiai, Slutsk, Kopyła and Shumsk.

He was a Master of the Horse of Lithuania since 1728, Court Marshal of Lithuania since 1734, Field Hetman of Lithuania and castellan of Trakai since 1737, castellan of Vilnius since 1742, voivode of Vilnius and Grand Hetman of Lithuania since 1744. Like his father, he was the starost of a number of towns, including Przemyśl, Bratslav, Kamianets-Podilskyi, Człuchów, Krzeczów, Ovruch, Nowy Targ, Parczew, Osiek and Kaunas.

On 23 April 1725 in Bilokrynytsia (pol. &quot;Biala Krynica&quot;) he married Urszula Franciszka Wiśniowiecka. Later married Anna Luiza Mycielska on 2 January 1754 in Lviv. Awarded with the Order of the White Eagle in August 1727.

The treatment of his medical problems included 56 bleedings, 30 applications of leeches, and 13 cuppings. These treatments have been described as illustrative demonstrations of medical interventions available to the wealthy at the time.

His former lover was Maria Karolina Sobieska, granddaughter of John III Sobieski.

<text>The Michigan Battle Cats of the Midwest League became the Battle Creek Yankees for the 2003 season. In 2005, their affiliation with the New York Yankees ended. They became an affiliate of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays known as the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays. The team played their home games in C.O. Brown Stadium in Battle Creek, Michigan.

==Team history==
In 2003, the Michigan Battle Cats dropped their affiliation with the Houston Astros and became an affiliate of the New York Yankees. Along with the change in affiliation came a change in name, as they became known as the &quot;Battle Creek Yankees.&quot; Their first half season began inauspiciously as they finished 33–35, placing fifth in the six-team Eastern Division. For the season&#x27;s second half, they improved to a 40–29 record, but still finished in second place in the division, games behind the South Bend Silver Hawks. Despite not winning either half, they qualified for the three-round playoffs as a wildcard team. In the first round they beat the Fort Wayne Wizards two games to none. In the second round, however, they fell to the Lansing Lugnuts. First baseman Jason Drobiak hit .293 and led the league with 30 home runs. Pitcher José García went 9–8 with a 2.64 earned run average. The pitcher who would perhaps go on to the most success at the major league level, Manny Acosta, went 0–8 with a 6.64 earned run average and was released by the Yankees.

In 2004, the Battle Creek Yankees finished third in the first half with a 33–36 record. For the second half, they improved their record to 38–32, but they still finished in fourth place, two games behind, in a tight divisional race. They did not qualify for the playoffs. Outfielder Melky Cabrera hit .333 with no home runs in 42 games. Third baseman Eric Duncan hit .260 with 12 home runs. Catcher Omir Santos hit .240 with 2 home runs. Pitcher Tyler Clippard went 10–10 with a 3.44 earned run average and 145 strikeouts.

In September 2004, Battle Creek announced that it had signed a two-year player development contract with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The Devil Rays were new to the Midwest League; the Battle Creek franchise was replacing Charleston RiverDogs of the South Atlantic League as Tampa Bay&#x27;s low-A affiliate. With the announcement, it was obvious that the team&#x27;s name would need to change, and later they became the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays.

<text>Yukta Inderlal Mookhey is an Indian civic activist and the winner of Miss World 1999 pageant. She is the fourth Indian woman to win Miss World and was previously crowned as Femina Miss India World in 1999. She is a former model and actress, and has worked in Hindi films.

==Early life==
Mookhey was born in Bangalore in a Sindhi family and was raised in Dubai until Mookhey was seven years of age. Her family moved back to Mumbai in June 1986. Her mother Aroona used to run a grooming saloon in Santa Cruz, Mumbai and her father, Inderlal Mookhey was a former Managing Director of a clothing company. After school, she studied zoology at the V. G. Vaze College in Mumbai. She has a diploma in computer sciences from Aptech and has studied Hindustani classical music for three years.

==Pageantry==
===Femina Miss India===
In 1999, Mookhey entered herself into the Femina Miss India contest, where she was shortlisted as a contestant. In the semifinal round during the grand finale, she was asked a question by judge Viv Richards - &quot;How do you define a true sports person?&quot;, to which she answered:

Mookhey proceeded to the succeeding round, where all her fellow Top 5 delegates were asked the same question - “In the context of the recent controversy, if you were Chelsea Clinton, what is the single most important advice, you as a daughter would you give to your parents Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, and why?”, to which she answered:

At the end of the event, she was crowned as Miss India World 1999 by the outgoing titleholder Annie Thomas, giving her the right to represent India at the Miss World 1999 contest.

===Miss World===
The 49th edition of the Miss World pageant was held on 4 December 1999 at Olympia, London and 93 delegates from around the world competed for the title. During the pageant&#x27;s question and answer round, she was asked if she could be anyone in the world who would she want to be. Mookhey replied - “It would have to be Audrey Hepburn. It was her inner beauty, compassion and her aura. The calm that she had inside her reflected.”

At the end of the event, Mookhey was crowned as Miss World 1999 by her predecessor Linor Abargil from Israel. The first runner-up title was won by Martina Thorogood from Venezuela, followed by the second runner-up, Sonia Raciti of South Africa. Mookhey also won the Asia &amp; Oceania&#x27;s Queen of Beauty Award during the Miss World contest. Mookhey became the fourth woman from India to win Miss World after Reita Faria in 1966, Aishwarya Rai in 1994 and Diana Hayden in 1997.

==Social works==
After Mookhey&#x27;s tenure as Miss World, she involved herself in various social and charitable causes. She has worked for the people affected by HIV/AIDS, breast cancer and thalassemia. Mookhey has pledged to donate her organs. In connection with this, she stated, “This step will benefit someone, once I leave this world”. She also works as an educationist and provides motivational counseling in various platforms. She partnered with an NGO to guide young girls from the slums, nudging them towards self-contemplation, understanding their needs and help them to become aware of their bodies, through counseling.

She has voiced against illegal child labour carried out in India&#x27;s firecracker industries, which is an offence under the Indian law. She has also aided the people with hearing impairment, from marginalised and low-income segment of the society. She expressed - “I have spent my time learning the Indian sign language because I feel that hearing impaired people have so much latent creativity and are hampered only by their inability to communicate. I would like to help them by drawing attention to this issue.”

Mookhey is an environmental activist, and has participated in various clean drives and social movements to prevent deforestation. In 2018, she joined a campaign to prevent illegal tree cutting taking place at the Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, to pave way for road and metro constructions. During the movement, she stated - “I don&#x27;t see any reason behind constructing road and metro from the sanctuary. The metro can be constructed underground and the road can be made elsewhere. Humans are not capable of making of what ‘Mother Earth’ can do. So we are just asking to stop the works and also stop cutting the trees.” She also consigned a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation&#x27;s Heritage Cell, to include the bird sanctuary in the list of national heritage sites.

She supports the Swachh Kalyani Nagar initiative in Pune, and had campaigned the households to process their waste effectively through segregation and recycling, ensuring minimum to zero garbage generation from individual societies.

== Personal life ==
On 7 September 2008, Mookhey got engaged to Prince Tuli, a New York-based businessman and financial consultant at a ceremony held at the Grand Maratha in Mumbai. The marriage was held on 2 November 2008 in a traditional Sikh ceremony at a Nagpur Gurudwara followed by a reception. They have one son together. 

Her brother Kanwal Mookhey is a businessman and is married to Indian television actress Karishma Randhawa.

In July 2013, Mookhey accused her husband and in-laws of subjecting her to domestic violence and harassment, and a FIR was registered under Section 498A (cruelty and harassment) and Section 377 (unnatural sex) of the Indian Penal Code. In June 2014, the couple obtained a consensual divorce.

== Career ==
Mookhey entered the film industry in 2001 through the Tamil movie &quot;Poovellam Un Vasam&quot;, where she appeared in a song titled &quot;Yukta Mookhey&quot;. She made her Hindi film debut with &quot;Pyaasa&quot; in 2002 starring with Aftab Shivdasani. The film proved to be a flop at the box office. Mookhey was cast in &quot;Market&quot; but had to drop out due to an injury. In 2003, she signed &quot;Kab Kyon Kahan&quot; and &quot;Hum Teeno&quot;, but both films where later shelved. She was later signed up for the 2004 release &quot;&quot;, but had to drop the project. In 2005, she acted in two films, &quot;Memsahab&quot; and &quot;Love in Japan&quot;. In 2006, she appeared in the music video for &quot;Kathputali&quot;. In 2010, she acted in Odia film &quot;Swayamsiddha&quot;, where she played a Maoist named Swayamsiddha.

<text>Patrick Anthony Cregg (born 21 February 1986) is an Irish football coach and former player, who is the manager of Brechin City. During his playing career he played for Arsenal, Falkirk, Hibernian, Greenock Morton, St Mirren, Bury, St Johnstone, Shamrock Rovers, St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic, Forfar Athletic and Montrose. He also represented the Republic of Ireland at youth international levels.

==Club career==
Having come through the youth academies at Manchester United and Arsenal, Cregg started his senior career at Arsenal; his first senior appearance was in a 3–1 victory against Everton in the League Cup on 9 November 2004, as an 89th-minute substitute for Arturo Lupoli. In all he made three appearances, all of them being in the League Cup.

Cregg joined Scottish Premier League club Falkirk in January 2006 and made over 100 Scottish Premier League appearances for the club. He was released in the summer of 2009, having made his last appearance for the club in the 2009 Scottish Cup final.

After his release by Falkirk, Cregg signed for Hibernian. Cregg followed manager John Hughes in making the move. He left Hibs at the end of the season.

Cregg then played in a reserve team friendly match for Shamrock Rovers against Manchester United. Cregg then played as a trialist for Greenock Morton in a Scottish First Division match against Ross County on 25 September 2010. The &quot;Greenock Telegraph&quot; reported on 1 October 2010 that Cregg had turned down a contract offer from Morton to sign for their Renfrewshire derby rivals St Mirren. Cregg signed for the Paisley club, agreeing a contract until January 2011.

Cregg signed a one-year contract with Bury in August 2011. In May 2012, he was released by the club after being deemed surplus to requirements.

Cregg then played for St Johnstone as a trialist in July 2012 before agreeing a one-year contract with the club.

In August 2014, Cregg signed a contract until the end of the season with League of Ireland side Shamrock Rovers.
After two and a half seasons with Rovers, Cregg signed for Dublin rivals St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic on 22 November 2016 on a one-year deal. On 31 January 2017 Cregg made his Pats debut in a 4–0 Leinster Senior Cup win over Bray Wanderers at the Carlisle Grounds. After half a season with Pats in which he was in and out of the team, Cregg requested to leave and came to a mutual agreement with the club to cancel his contract on 4 July 2017.

Cregg signed for Forfar Athletic on 13 August 2017. He was released from his contract on 31 January 2018.

He spent one full season at Montrose before retiring in August 2019 to take up a role as assistant manager of his old club St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic, under new manager and former Arsenal &amp; Falkirk teammate of Cregg&#x27;s, Stephen O&#x27;Donnell.

==International career==
While he was at Arsenal, Cregg became a regular in the Republic of Ireland under-19 team. He later represented the Republic of Ireland national under-21 football team.

==Coaching career==
After serving as assistant manager under Stephen O&#x27;Donnell at both St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic from 2019–2021 and at Dundalk until 2024, Cregg was awarded his first managerial role on 5 June 2024, when he was appointed manager of Highland League side Brechin City.

<text>Wireless Multimedia Extensions (WME), also known as Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM), is a Wi-Fi Alliance interoperability certification, based on the IEEE 802.11e standard. It provides basic Quality of service (QoS) features to IEEE 802.11 networks. WMM prioritizes traffic according to four Access Categories (AC): voice (AC_VO), video (AC_VI), best effort (AC_BE), and background (AC_BK). However, it does not provide guaranteed throughput. It is suitable for well-defined applications that require QoS, such as Voice over IP (VoIP) on Wi-Fi phones (VoWLAN).

WMM replaces the Wi-Fi DCF distributed coordination function for CSMA/CA wireless frame transmission with Enhanced Distributed Coordination Function (EDCF). EDCF, according to version 1.1 of the WMM specifications by the Wi-Fi Alliance, defines Access Categories labels AC_VO, AC_VI, AC_BE, and AC_BK for the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) parameters that are used by a WMM-enabled station to control how long it sets its Transmission Opportunity (TXOP), according to the information transmitted by the access point to the station. It is implemented for wireless QoS between RF media.

== Power Save Certification ==
The Wi-Fi Alliance has added &quot;Power Save Certification&quot; to the WMM specification. Power Save uses mechanisms from 802.11e and legacy 802.11 to save power (for battery powered equipment) and fine-tune power consumption. The certification provides an indication that the certified product is targeted for power critical applications like smart phones and portable power devices (i.e. those that require battery or recharging such as smart phones.)

The underlying concept of WMM PowerSave is that the station (STA) triggers the release of buffered data from the access point (AP) by sending an uplink data frame. Upon receipt of such a data (trigger) frame the AP releases previously buffered data stored in each of its queues. Queues may be configured to be trigger-enabled, (i.e. a receipt of a data frame corresponding to the queue acts as trigger), and delivery enabled, (i.e. data stored at those queues will be released upon receipt of a frame). Queues refer to the four ACs defined for WMM.

<doc id="1306055" wikidata="Q494441" url="?curid=1306055" title="Kia Opirus">
<text>The Kia Opirus is an executive car/full-size sedan, manufactured by Kia Motors and marketed over a single generation for model years 2003–2012 globally and 2004-2009 in North America. Having debuted internationally at the 2003 Geneva Motor Show, the four-door, five-passenger, front-engine, front-drive sedan was launched to the North American market at the New York International Auto Show and in San Diego, bearing the Amanti nameplate — and prioritizing luxury content and comfort over dynamic performance and agility.

Intended to give Kia upward access to global premium markets, the Opirus represented a departure for the brand in both styling and market positioning. Developed over 22 months at a cost US$167 million (€143 million), 18% of the overall development cost went to R&amp;D investment and 41% to development of production technologies. 

As Kia&#x27;s first premium vehicle, the Opirus replaced the Mazda 929-derived Enterprise in the South Korean domestic market. The Opirus was also the first Kia vehicle sharing a platform with sister company Hyundai, using a variation of the third generation Hyundai Grandeur/XG Y4 platform. For the Opirus, the platform was lengthened 1.9 inches, overall length increased 4.1 inches and height increased 2.6 inches. As Kia&#x27;s largest sedan, the Opirus was marketed in a single trim level, sharing components with the Grandeur/XG, and a range of engines including its 3.5 L V6 engine (North America). All models were manufactured in Kia&#x27;s Hwaseong Plant near Incheon. 

A 2007 facelift, introduced at the 2006 Paris Auto Show, included upgraded specifications, a curb weight reduction of 250 pounds, revised suspension and a 3.8 L V6 engine (North America) with a 32-percent increase in power over its predecessor. Styling revisions included a shorter and wider grill, revised hood, headlamps, front and rear bumper fascias, alloy wheels, trunk deck lid, tail lamps, dual exhaust outlets and rear quarter panels. The interior featured a revised instrument panel design. 

The name &quot;Opirus&quot; referred to the ancient city of Ophir, noted for its wealth — and was selected via an online survey from the choices of &quot;Opirus&quot;, &quot;Regent&quot; and &quot;Conzern&quot;. In 2004, the &quot;New York Times&quot; described the name &quot;Amanti&quot; as an untranslatable latinate construction, intended to connote luxury.

==Design and equipment==
The Opirus&#x27; styling — described variously as conservative, neo-classic, restrained, unoriginal and derivative — drew cues from disparate sources, notably the Mercedes-Benz E-class, Lincoln Town Car, Jaguar S-Type, Lexus GS, Chrysler 300C, and Lancia Thesis. 

In the Korean Domestic Market, interior features included available heated and reclining rear seats, high-intensity-discharge headlights, navigation system, electro-luminescent gauges, ignition immobilizer, reverse parking sensors and electronically adjustable suspension settings. 

In North America, the sedan was marketed to value-sensitive 40-to-60-year-old professionals with standard equipment at introduction including manually tilting leather-wrapped, four-spoke steering wheel with faux woodgrain inserts and remote audio and cruise controls; faux wood grain dash, console and door accents (lighter prior to the 2007 facelift, darker thereafter); power locks and windows; CD player with six speakers; electronic driver- and passenger-adjustable climate control; front, curtain and side airbags; dual zone automatic climate control; keyless entry; herring bone cloth interior; glove-box only key; elongated LED turn-signals; rain-sensing windshield wipers; analog clock; foot-operated parking brake (releasable by a dash-mounted pull-handle); power moonroof; 16&quot; alloy wheels; full-size spare on an alloy wheel; and an eight-way powered driver&#x27;s bucket seat and four-way passenger bucket seat with door-mounted adjustment controls using a &quot;mock-seat&quot; ergonomic design. The interior received heavy acoustic insulation, and later models included heated rear seats, and electro-luminescent instrument lighting. European models include two ISOFIX anchorage points.

Options included leather interior, 270-watt Infinity stereo with subwoofer and six-disc changer, dashboard LCD screen, trip computer with 4&quot; LCD screen, heated seats, Adjustable pedals, auto-dimming rearview mirror, and pearl coat paint. Safety equipment included eight airbags, and obstruction-sensing, anti-pinch power windows.

The Opirus offered a passenger volume of 105.6 cubic feet and a 15.5 cubic foot cargo volume — the trunk equipped with a gas strut-assisted lid and luggage restraining net.

In North America, J.D. Power and Associates recognized the Amanti as the &quot;Most Appealing Premium Midsize Car&quot; in its 2005 Automotive Performance, Execution and Layout Study.

== Drivetrain ==
The Opirus was marketed globally with the 3.5L Sigma and the 3.8L Lambda engines. The North American Amanti featured the 3.5 liter engine producing 200 bhp at 5500 rpm and 220 lb.-ft. of torque at 3500 rpm. Shifting was by a 5-speed automatic transmission, shifting either in fully automatic or manual sequential modes — the latter controlled via an H-shaped shift gate. Steering was an electronically power assisted rack and pinion system with an overall ratio of 15.24:1 and a turning radius of 5.7 meters.

Suspension featured coil springs, anti-roll bars (26 mm front, 16 mm rear), gas-pressurized shocks, a front independent, double A-arm (wishbone) design with unequal-length control arms and rear multi-link rear geometry. Suspension included an ECS (electronically controlled suspension) system with automatic and sport mode, selectable via a switch adjacent to the transmission shift gate and the sport mode providing stiffer shock absorber settings.

Brakes included 11.9/11.2-inch front/rear discs with four channel, four sensors ABS (anti-lock brakes), BAS (emergency brake assist), EBD (electronic brake force distribution), TCS (traction control system), and ESP (electronic stability program). 

The Opirus is the first Kia to integrate an Electronic Stability Program (ESP), developed with Continental Teves of Germany.

<text>The National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) is an Australian educational institution for the performing arts based in Sydney, New South Wales. Founded in 1958, it offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and vocational degrees in subjects including acting, writing, directing, scenic construction, technical theatre, voice, costume, props, production design and cultural leadership. In 2024, NIDA was named as #13 in the &quot;World&#x27;s 25 Best Drama Schools&quot; by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;.

NIDA&#x27;s main campus is based in the Sydney suburb of Kensington, located adjacent to the University of New South Wales (UNSW), and is made up of a range of rehearsal and performance venues. Its performance venues include the Parade Theatre (also the name of an earlier venue in NIDA&#x27;s history); the Space; the Studio Theatre; and the Playhouse, while the Rodney Seaborn Library forms part of its library and the Reg Grundy Studio is a training and production facility for film and television. Many of Australia&#x27;s leading actors and directors trained at NIDA, including Cate Blanchett, Sarah Snook, Mel Gibson, Judy Davis and Baz Luhrmann.

==History==
NIDA was founded in 1958 as the first professional theatre training school in Australia. The idea of a national theatre training school was initiated by the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust (AETT) in 1954. With the support of the Vice-Chancellor (later Sir) Philip Baxter, NIDA was established in the grounds of the University of New South Wales. Robert Quentin, later Professor of Drama at UNSW, was appointed the inaugural Director.

Teaching began in 1959 and in 1960, the first 23 students graduated with a Diploma in Acting. After 1961 it offered both acting and production streams, and in the early 1970s design, technical production and directing streams were introduced.

NIDA ran the Old Tote Theatre Company until 1969, whose productions were initially funded by the AETT and subsequently by the Australia Council for the Arts and the New South Wales Government. In 1967 the Old Tote moved its administration to separate premises, to a building which still exists on the UNSW campus, then known as the Parade Theatre, and on 7 May 1969 gave its first performance at that venue, a production of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;.

The present campus was first opened in 1987.

In 1991 NIDA expanded into the study of theatrical crafts – costume, properties, scenery and staging – and over the 2000s developed post-graduate courses in voice, movement studies, production management and playwriting.

Additional buildings opened in 2001, which were awarded the 2002 Sir John Sulman Medal for public architecture.

==Governance and funding==
NIDA receives funding from the Australian Government through the Department of Communications and the Arts, and is a member of the &quot;Australian Roundtable for Arts Training Excellence&quot; (ARTS8), an initiative between the national performing arts training organisations and the federal government that provides training for emerging artists.

==Admission==
Entry to NIDA&#x27;s Bachelor of Fine Arts, Master of Fine Arts and Vocational courses is highly competitive with an admission rate of around 12% and even lower for some courses; with more than 1,500 applicants from around the country competing for an annual offering of approximately 185 places across the six undergraduate, five post-graduate and four vocational diploma disciplines.

NIDA&#x27;s Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting is particularly competitive, with approximately 1,000 applicants per year attempting to secure one of 24 spots in the program.

== Campus ==

NIDA is located on Anzac Parade in the Sydney suburb of Kensington, across the road from the University of New South Wales.

===Theatres===
 NIDA campus has six professional performance venues, in addition to studios and rehearsal rooms. The largest of these, the Parade Theatre, has three-tiered seating which accommodates up to 707 people. Other venues include the Playhouse, the Space, and the Studio Theatre.

===Library and archives===
The Rodney Seaborn Library, named in honour of arts philanthropist Rodney Seaborn (1912–2008), is a specialist library for NIDA students, graduates and staff and is also open to the general public by appointment.

The NIDA Archives collects, organises and preserves archival records created by or relating to NIDA.

===Other facilities===
The NIDA campus includes rehearsal rooms, multi-media and computer-aided design (CAD) studios, a sound stage, a lighting studio, production workshops, audio-visual facilities, and the Reg Grundy Studio film and television training and production facility.

==Ranking==
In 2018, NIDA was ranked as the 10th best drama school in the world by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; It is consistently ranked as the top school in Australia, or in the top five, by many sources. In 2021, it was reported as the 16th best drama school in the world by the same source, making it the only Australian drama school to make the list.
== Alumni ==

The National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) is Australia&#x27;s leading centre for education and training in the performing arts. A complete list of NIDA alumni can be found on the NIDA website.

== Learning by doing ==
Industry engagement and collaborative student learning are core part of NIDA courses. NIDA utilises a conservatoire model, where students learn by practical application through in-house productions and working with professional companies on short-term placements. In addition to classwork, students will work on multiple practical projects during their time at NIDA, ranging from full theatrical productions to short films. Depending on the program, students may also undertake interstate and international trips as part of the learning process.

== Short courses ==
NIDA delivers hundreds of short courses every year across Australia and internationally through NIDA Open and NIDA Corporate.

=== NIDA Open ===
NIDA Open is Australia&#x27;s largest non-profit, performing arts short course program. In 2018, more than 15,000 students attended NIDA Open courses in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra, Darwin and other locations. NIDA Open offers courses for children and young people from preschool through Grade 12, as well as adult courses, in acting, comedy, costumes, props, make-up, design, directing, filmmaking, musical theatre, physical theatre and movement, presenting, technical theatre, stage management, voice and writing.

=== NIDA Corporate ===
NIDA Corporate offers training in professional communication, presentation and leadership for individuals and businesses in the public and private sectors. Tutors include voice specialists, movement and body language practitioners, film and theatre directors, actors and television presenters. In 2018, more than 9,000 participants attended NIDA Corporate training.

==Controversy==
In 2012, former NIDA board member and Liberal senator Chris Puplick, who had served on the board for three years, wrote an essay titled &quot;Changing Times at NIDA&quot; which was published in the October issue of the publication &quot;Platform Papers&quot;. In the essay, Puplick criticized the teaching standards of the school and its director and chief executive, Lynne Williams, stating that she has had no significant experience in theatre to head the school and that her style was &quot;Thatcherite&quot;. Soon after Puplick&#x27;s statements were reported, chairman of NIDA&#x27;s board, Malcolm Long, and Lynne Williams replied back to the comments, with Long stating that Williams had the complete support of the board and described Puplick as &quot;an apparently disaffected former board member.&quot; Williams had defended herself stating her management style was not &quot;Thatcherite&quot;. Long also mentioned that amongst Williams&#x27; supporters were Cate Blanchett and Ralph Myers. Supporting Puplick were actor, director and a graduate of the school Jeremy Sims, who had launched the essay, and Kevin Jackson, who had taught acting at the school for 27 years.

In June 2020, a letter from over 100 alumni, students and former staff was signed and sent to NIDA&#x27;s chief executive Liz Hughes accusing the school for failing to support Indigenous, Black and other students of colors. The letter which was sent to Hughes via email accused the school of &quot;systemic and institutionalised racism&quot; and where students had felt that they were there simply to fulfill diversity quotas.

<doc id="1306074" wikidata="Q673726" url="?curid=1306074" title="Swissair Flight 330">
<text>Swissair Flight 330 (SR330/SWR330) was a regularly scheduled flight from Zurich Airport in Kloten, Switzerland, to Hong Kong with a planned stopover in Tel Aviv, Israel. A bomb planted by two members of the PLO exploded soon after takeoff, causing the plane to crash, killing all 47 passengers and crew.

==History==
On 21 February 1970 HB-ICD a Convair CV-990 &quot;Coronado&quot; jet named &quot;Baselland&quot; was flying on the route with 38 passengers and nine crew members. A bomb detonated in the aft cargo compartment of the aircraft about nine minutes after take-off during the ascent on a southerly course at approximately 12:15 UTC in the area of Lucerne north of the St. Gotthard Pass. The crew tried to turn the plane around and attempt an emergency landing at Zürich but had difficulty seeing the instruments due to smoke in the cockpit. The aircraft deviated more and more to the west and crashed a short time later in a wooded area at Würenlingen near Zürich, Switzerland, due to loss of electrical power. All aboard the aircraft were killed.

A government air inspector was flown to the scene in a helicopter. He was followed shortly afterward by a team of 50 investigators. The police said that a woman handed in a 9-mm pistol found at the scene of the crash immediately after the disaster. Some of the wreckage, including pieces of cloth, was strung out on the tops and branches of trees.

Sabotage was immediately suspected. A possible motive was revenge against Switzerland for three Palestinians who had been sentenced to 12 years imprisonment by a Swiss court. Swiss news agencies said a splinter group of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) had claimed responsibility, but other media reports said the group denied involvement. The Swiss investigating judge, Robert Akeret, personally handed his 165-page report to the federal attorney-general, Hans Walder. According to this report, the bombing was committed by two members of the PLO.

A barometric-triggered bomb had been used. On the same day, another bomb exploded aboard an Austrian Airlines Vienna-bound Caravelle after takeoff from Frankfurt. The Caravelle landed safely.

==Air traffic control transcript==
(Start of conversation with Zurich ATC. Note: conversation of the recording begins following the initial explosion.)Swissair 330: Ah, 330 we have trouble with the cabin compression, we have to return to Zurich.

Zurich ATC: Roger, what is your actual level?

(Both ATC and pilot keyed microphones at the same time creating a small heterodyne.)

(Muffled voice from Swissair crew indicates either issues with the radio or the pilots speaking through their oxygen masks.)

(End of recording).A segment of the recording is publicly available on sites such as YouTube.

==Postal history==
As noted in Kibble (&quot;The Arab Israeli Conflict: No Service, Returned &amp; Captured Mail&quot;, 2014) - On 21 February 1970 Swissair Flight 330 left Zürich, Switzerland, bound for Tel Aviv, Israel. A bomb exploded in the rear cargo compartment nine minutes after take-off. The crew attempted to turn the plane around and undertake an emergency landing at Zürich, but it crashed a short time later in a wooded area at Würenlingen, near Zürich. A bomb with an altimeter trigger was placed in a package mailed to an Israeli address by Palestinian extremists. All 47 persons on board (38 passengers and 9 crew) were killed. A small amount of mail was recovered from the crash and is highly prized by collectors of crash mail.

A black instructional marking in French was applied to any mail that survived the crash, which translated reads:

The Coronado bombing saw a change in mailing practices across the globe. In particular, mail sent or routed to Israel through the UK, Italy, and the USA was required to be sent by surface mail in the immediate future. Airmail to Israel was no longer permitted.

A report from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency titled &quot;Airmail from Europe Fails to Arrive in Israel Despite Assurances It Would&quot; from 25 February 1970 states the following:

==Post-crash allegations ==
In a book titled &quot;Schweizer Terrorjahre: Das geheime Abkommen mit der PLO,&quot; NZZ journalist Marcel Gyr explored possible reasons, why none of the suspected terrorists were convicted. Gyr&#x27;s thesis is that in 1970 Switzerland and the PLO entered into a secret deal, arranged by the then Social Democratic Federal Councillor Pierre Graber, which ensured, among other things, that the two main suspects in the attack were not arrested, but above all that the Palestinians guaranteed that they would not carry out any more attacks on Swiss targets in the future. In return, Gyr posited, Switzerland granted the then-internationally isolated PLO permission to set up an office at the UN headquarters in Geneva.

In a 2016 inquiry, the Swiss parliament found no evidence of such a deal ever being agreed upon. Fritz Blankart, who served as Swiss State Secretary in 1970, also rejected the existence of the deal. In a 2020 interview, Ruedi Berlinger, son of Swissair 330 captain Karl Berlinger, stated that he does not accept the parliament&#x27;s findings and called on Switzerland, the United States, Israel and Germany to open their archives fully as it relates to the crash.

<doc id="1306077" wikidata="Q6186219" url="?curid=1306077" title="Jesse Chatman">
<text>Jesse James Chatman Jr (born September 22, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Eastern Washington Eagles and was signed by the San Diego Chargers as an undrafted free agent in 2002.

Chatman was also a member of the Miami Dolphins, New Orleans Saints, New York Jets and Virginia Destroyers.

==Early life==
Chatman was a highly decorated prep running back at Franklin High School in Seattle, Washington, His head coach was Joseph Slye (who also coached NFL stars Corey Dillon and James Hasty). Chatman&#x27;s High School position coach was former NFL-running back Terry Metcalf. In honor of his many accomplishments at Franklin, his success at Eastern Washington University, and his rise to prominence in the NFL, Chatman&#x27;s high school raised his Franklin jersey in a ceremony at the school and it will remain displayed in tribute.

==College career==
Chatman played for the Eastern Washington University Eagles of the Big Sky Conference from 1999 to 2001. During his tenure, Chatman was an AP I-AA All-America selection, Big Sky Conference Offensive Player of Year and a first-team all-conference selection. He recorded the fourth-highest single-season rushing total in I-AA history, amassing 2,096 rushing yards. Chatman finished his career with 4,173 yards and 53 touchdowns.

==Professional career==

===San Diego Chargers===
Chatman was one of 19 undrafted free agents originally signed by the San Diego Chargers in April 2002. After leading the NFL in rushing during the preseason with 234 yards on a 5.1 average, he made the team out of training camp. Chatman went on to appear in 10 games with no starts. On the season, he rushed for 19 yards on six carries, caught three passes for 44 yards and notched four tackles on special teams.

Chatman went on to appear in all 16 regular season games for the Chargers in 2003. Though he rarely saw action on offense (he finished the year with eight carries for 17 yards and five catches for 54 yards), he was the team&#x27;s leading special teams tackler with 16 stops and also recovered a fumble. Also, while he was primarily a blocker on kickoffs, Chatman did return two kicks for a total of 31 yards during the season.

After re-signing with the team as an exclusive rights free agent, Chatman appeared in 15 games for the Chargers in 2004 despite a nagging toe injury. He had a career day against the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 10 when he rushed for 103 yards and a score. On the season, Chatman had 65 carries for 392 yards (a 6.0 average), two catches for 17 yards and three touchdowns. On special teams, he totaled four tackles and also had four kickoff returns for 89 yards, including a long of 35 yards. The toe injury finally got the best of him in the playoffs, when he was forced to sit out the team&#x27;s AFC Wild Card match-up against the New York Jets.

A restricted free agent following March, Chatman was re-signed to a one-year deal. The addition of rookie Darren Sproles, the development of Michael Turner, Chatman&#x27;s absence from Qualcomm Stadium in the offseason as well as weight issues all contributed to his release from the team that July.

===First stint with Dolphins===
Despite the concerns held by the Chargers, particularly head coach Marty Schottenheimer, Chatman received plenty of interest on the open market from teams like the Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers, Minnesota Vikings, Oakland Raiders and Seattle Seahawks.

However, it was the Miami Dolphins who inked Chatman on September 3, 2005, to provide depth while Ricky Williams served a four-game suspension. Chatman was inactive for the first five games of the regular season with the Dolphins before being traded to the New Orleans Saints for a conditional seventh-round draft choice on October 11.

===New Orleans Saints===
Chatman spent three games with the Saints, inactive for all, before being released on November 2. He had worked out by the New England Patriots a few days later as the team was looking to add depth, but the team decided to sign running back Mike Cloud instead.

===Second stint with the Dolphins===
Chatman was not an active player in the NFL for 2006 and reportedly weighed 280 pounds. He shaved 60 pounds off his body which gave him the new explosiveness he needed to revive his career. After being out of the league in 2006, the Dolphins re-signed Chatman and allocated him to NFL Europa on February 21, 2007. This most recent stint with the Dolphins re-united him with head coach Cam Cameron, who was the offensive coordinator for the San Diego Chargers during Chatman&#x27;s time there. Chatman began the 2007 season as Ronnie Brown&#x27;s backup and saw limited duty until Week 7 against New England, when Brown went down with a serious knee injury. Chatman responded by running for an impressive 73 yards on only 7 carries before leaving the game temporarily with an injury of his own. Chatman came back in the 4th quarter to score the last touchdown of the game (and his first since 2004).

With the season-ending injury of Dolphin&#x27;s starting running back Ronnie Brown, Jesse Chatman had been named the new starter for the Miami Dolphins. His best game came against a 13-10 heartbreaker to the Buffalo Bills, where he rushed for 124 yards on 27 carries. Jesse finished the year with a career-high 515 yards rushing with one touchdown.

===New York Jets===
Chatman signed a one-year deal with the New York Jets in the 2008 offseason. One week before the start of the season, he was suspended for four games for violating the league&#x27;s substance abuse policy.

Jesse has a son named Sahvere and a daughter named Jaylynn Chatman.

<text>The North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), also known as the Canadian porcupine, is a large quill-covered rodent in the New World porcupine family. It is the second largest rodent in North America after the North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;). The porcupine is a caviomorph rodent whose ancestors crossed the Atlantic from Africa to Brazil 30 million years ago, and then migrated to North America during the Great American Interchange after the Isthmus of Panama rose 3 million years ago.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;porcupine&quot; comes from the middle or old French word , which means &#x27;thorn pig&#x27;. Its roots derive from the Latin words or pig and meaning thorns. Other colloquial names for the animal include quill pig. It is also referred to as the Canadian porcupine or common porcupine. The porcupine&#x27;s scientific name, &quot;Erethizon dorsatum&quot;, can be loosely translated as &quot;the animal with the irritating back&quot;. Native American terms for it include the Lakota name meaning quill, the Ho-Chunk name , and the Chipewyan name .

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The North American porcupine migrated from South America, where all New World porcupines or hystricomorphs evolved. &quot;Erethizon&quot; appeared in North America shortly after the two continents joined together in the later Tertiary period. Other hystricomorphs also migrated, but &quot;Erethizon&quot; was the only one to survive north of Mexico. No known fossils are attributed to hystricomorphs prior to the late Tertiary period. Some fossils, such as species from the family Paramyidae, show resemblance to the porcupine, but they are so primitive and generalized that they could be ancestors to all later rodents.

South American hystricomorphs first appeared in the Lower Oligocene period. They are thought to have migrated from Africa, ancestors of the Old World porcupines or Hystricidae or they originated based on a migration of the North American Paramyidae.

The earliest purported appearance of &quot;E. dorsatum&quot; in the fossil record is from the Pleistocene (Irvingtonian) era, found along the Arroyo del Cedazo near Aguascalientes, Mexico. However, the validity of this fossil&#x27;s taxonomy is a cause for debate, with some paleontologists arguing that it represents a member of the genus &quot;Coendou&quot; (the prehensile-tailed porcupines) instead. The earliest uncontroversial fossils of &quot;E. dorsatum&quot;, found in the Conard Fissure of Arkansas, date back to the Middle Pleistocene (~130,000 YBP).

===Subspecies===
Seven subspecies of &quot;E. dorsatum&quot; are recognized. They are subdivided by different ranges across North America. By far the most common is &quot;E. d. dorsatum&quot;, which ranges from Nova Scotia to Alberta and from Virginia to the Yukon. &quot;E. d. picinum&quot; occupies a small range in northeastern Quebec and Labrador. &quot;E. d. couesi&quot; is the most southern ranging from northern Mexico to Colorado. &quot;E. d. bruneri&quot; can be found in the midwest from Arkansas to Montana. The last three are found in the west. From south to north they are &quot;E.d. epixanthum&quot;, &quot;E. d. nigrescens&quot;, and &quot;E. d. myops&quot;.

==Description==
Porcupines are usually dark brown or black in color, with white highlights. They have a stocky body, a small face, short legs, and a short, thick tail. This species is the largest of the New World porcupines and is the second largest North American rodent, after the American beaver. The head-and-body length is , not counting a tail of . The hind foot length is . Weight can range from . Weight in adult females can average some while 5 wild-caught males averaged .

The porcupine possesses antibiotics in its skin which may help prevent infection when a porcupine falls out of a tree and is stuck with its own quills upon hitting the ground. Porcupines fall out of trees fairly often because they are highly tempted by the succulent buds and tender twigs at the ends of the branches. The porcupine, the wolverine, and the skunk are the only North American mammals that have strongly contrasting black-and-white coloration, because they are the only mammals that benefit from letting other animals know where and what they are in the dark of night.

===Quills===
The most distinguishing feature of the porcupine is its coat of quills. An adult porcupine has about 30,000 quills that cover all of its body except its underbelly, face, and feet. Quills are modified hairs formed into sharp, barbed, hollow spines. They are used primarily for defense, but also serve to insulate their bodies during winter. The quills are normally flattened against the body and in this position are less easily dislodged. Porcupines do not throw their quills, but when threatened contract superficial muscles which cause the quills to stand up and out from their bodies. In this position they become easier to detach from the body, especially when the tail is swung toward an attacker. The barbs at the end of the spines lodge in the flesh of a victim and are difficult and painful to remove.

===Stench===
The North American porcupine has a strong odor to warn away predators, which it can increase when agitated. The smell has been described as similar to strong human body odor, goats, or some cheeses. The odor is generated by a patch of skin called the rosette, on the lower back where modified quills serve as osmetrichia to broadcast the smell. The characteristic odor comes from the R-enantiomer of delta-decalactone. Not present is the S-enantiomer which smells like coconut and is used in flavorings and perfumes.

==Distribution and habitat==
In eastern North America, porcupines range from Canada to the Appalachian Mountains in West Virginia and Maryland. In the west they range from Alaska to northern mountains in Mexico. They are commonly found in coniferous and mixed forested areas, but have adapted to harsh environments, such as shrublands and tundra. They make their dens in hollow trees or in rocky areas.

==Ecology==

===Diet===


During the summer, they eat twigs, roots, stems, berries, leaves, and other vegetation. Porcupines also eat certain insects and nuts. In the winter, they mainly eat conifer needles and tree bark. Porcupines are selective in their consumption; for example out of every 1,000 trees in the Catskill Mountains, porcupines will only eat from 1-2 linden trees and one big-toothed aspen.

===Behavior===

Porcupines are nearsighted and slow-moving. They are mainly active at night (nocturnal); on summer days, they often rest in trees. They do not hibernate, but sleep in and stay close to their dens in winter. The strength of the porcupine&#x27;s defense has given it the ability to live a solitary life, unlike many herbivores, which must move in flocks or herds. Consequently, the porcupine has &quot;an extraordinary ability to learn complex mazes and to remember them as much as a hundred days afterward&quot;.

===Defense===
The North American porcupine has specific behaviors to warn or defend against predators. The defense strategy is based on aposematism in several modalities. It has a strong warning odor which it can increase when agitated. When threatened, an adult porcupine can bristle its quills, displaying a white stripe down its back, and use its teeth to make a warning, clacking sound. If the olfactory, visual, and auditory warnings fail, then it can rely on its quills. An adult porcupine when attacked turns its rear to the predator. When approached, the porcupine can swing its tail at an attacker&#x27;s face. Despite popular myth, the porcupine does not throw its quills. Instead, when a quill comes in contact with the attacker, it can easily penetrate and become embedded in its skin. Each quill contains microscopic barbs which allow it to stick into the flesh of an attacker. This strategy is successful against most attacks. With a face full of quills, an attacking creature often retreats. The porcupine&#x27;s last line of defense is to climb a tree.

===Predators===
Natural predators of this species include fishers (a cat-sized mustelid), wolverines, coyotes, wolves, American black bears, and cougars, as well as humans. The only known avian predators of this species are golden eagles and great horned owls. In many cases, injury or even death may occur in the predator from embedded porcupine quills even if they are successful in dispatching the porcupine.

The North American porcupine is most at risk from the fisher (&quot;Pekania pennanti&quot;), the male of which may sometimes exceed a mass of . Fishers have two advantages that make them capable hunters of the porcupine. First, they are agile tree climbers, and may force a fleeing porcupine from a tree to the ground, where it is more vulnerable. There it will try to present its hindquarters and tail to the attacker, with the predator circling around and attempting to attack the prey. After repeated attacks, the porcupine eventually weakens, allowing the fisher to flip the porcupine over, rip open its underbelly, and consume its organs without exposing itself to the still dangerous quills. One study suggested that since male fishers are considerably larger than females (often weighing on average twice as much), only males are likely to hunt porcupines. It appears that female fishers usually favor prey such as snowshoe hares.

Another effective predator is the cougar. It does not avoid the quills so much as seek to avoid being impaled by too many of them. Some individuals have been found with dozens of quills embedded in their gums to no ill effect. It can climb trees, so its favorite method is to position itself below the porcupine and knock it to the ground, quickly dispatching it. Other predators, such as canids (wolves and coyotes), may attack but do not pose much of a threat. In some parts of the Great Basin, cougars have greatly decreased numbers of porcupines in mountainous forests through predation. However, in some cases porcupine quills have indeed killed cougars, although usually this is after the cougar has already consumed the porcupine.

===Reproduction===
Female porcupines are solitary for most of the year except during the fall when breeding season begins. At this time, they secrete a thick mucus which mixes with their urine. The resulting odor attracts males in the vicinity. Males that approach a female do not automatically begin mating. The first male that comes along typically sits in the same tree below a female. If another male approaches, he may fight for the right to mate. Once a dominant male is successful, he approaches the female and uses a spray of his urine on the female. Only a few drops touch the female, but the chemical reaction allows the female to enter estrus fully. Once this is accomplished high in the tree, the mating process takes place on the ground. When porcupines are mating, they tighten their skin and hold their quills flat, so as not to injure each other. Mating may occur repeatedly until the female loses interest and climbs back into the tree.

The North American porcupine has a long gestation period relative to other rodents, an average of 202 days. By contrast, the North American beaver, which is comparable in size, has a gestation period of 128 days. The eastern grey squirrel (&quot;Sciurus carolinensis&quot;) has a gestation period of just 44 days. North American porcupines give birth to a single young, referred to as a porcupette. At birth, they weigh about 450 g, which increases to nearly 1 kg after the first two weeks. They do not gain full adult weight until the end of the second summer about 4.5 kg. Their quills harden soon after birth.

Female porcupines provide all parental care. For the first two weeks the young rely on their mother for sustenance. After this they learn to climb trees and start to forage. They continue to nurse for up to four months, which coincides with the fall mating season. Porcupettes typically separate from their mother in the fall. 

===Life expectancy===
North American porcupines have a relatively long life expectancy, with some individuals reaching 30 years of age. Common causes of mortality include predation, starvation, falling out of a tree, and being run over by motor vehicles.

==Porcupines and humans==
Porcupines are considered by some to be pests because of the damage that they often inflict on trees and wooden and leather objects. Plywood is especially vulnerable because of the salts added during manufacture. They also often injure domestic dogs who inspect or attack them.

Their quills are used by Native Americans to decorate articles such as baskets and clothing. Porcupines are edible and were an important source of food, especially in winter, to the native peoples of Canada&#x27;s boreal forests. They move slowly (having few threats in their natural environment) and are often hit by vehicles while crossing roads.

Porcupines are infamous among backpackers and backpacking publications for their love of salt, especially eating road salt-covered boots left outside of tents overnight. They have a similar reputation among forestry workers of all types for trying to eat sweat-soaked gloves and wooden handles on tools.

===Conservation status===
Globally, the North American porcupine is listed as a species of least concern. It is common throughout its range except in some U.S. states in the southeast part of its range. For example, it is listed as a species in need of conservation in Maryland. As of 1999, 15 remnant populations remain scattered throughout north-central Mexico. These live in riparian forests, mesquite scrubland, grasslands, and thorn forests. They are threatened by hunting and habitat loss. As of 1994, the animal was listed as an endangered species in Mexico.

<text>Suez S.A., known from 1997 to 2001 as Suez-Lyonnaise des eaux, was a leading French multinational corporation headquartered in the 8th arrondissement of Paris, with operations primarily in water, electricity and natural gas supply, and waste management. Suez was the result of a 1997 merger between the &quot;Compagnie de Suez&quot; and , a leading French water company. In the early 2000s Suez also owned some media and telecommunications assets, but later divested them. According to the &quot;Masons Water Yearbook&quot; 2004/5, Suez served 117.4 million people around the world. The company conducted a merger of equals with fellow utility company Gaz de France on 22 July 2008 to form GDF Suez (called Engie since 2015). The water and waste assets of Suez were spun off into a separate publicly traded company, Suez Environnement.

==History==
Suez was (and remains, through GDF Suez) one of the oldest continuously existing multinational corporations in the world, with one line of corporate history dating back to the 1822 founding of the (literally: General Dutch Company for the favouring of industry) by King William I of the Netherlands (see Société Générale de Belgique). Its form prior to the GDF merger was the result of nearly two centuries of reorganisation and corporate mergers. Its most recent name comes from the involvement of one of its several founding entities – the &quot;Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez&quot; – in building the Suez Canal in the mid-19th century.

===Merger with Gaz de France===
On February 25, 2006, French Prime minister Dominique de Villepin announced the merger of Suez and Gaz de France, which would make the world&#x27;s largest liquefied natural gas company. The revenue of GDF was around 22.4 billion euros in 2005, compared to 41.5 billion for Suez. The CGT trade-union called the merger a &quot;disguised privatization.&quot;

On 3 September 2007, Gaz de France and Suez announced agreed terms of merger. The deal was conducted on the basis of an exchange of 21 Gaz de France shares for 22 Suez shares via the absorption of Suez by Gaz de France. The French state holds more than 35% of shares of the merged company, GDF Suez. As a consequence of the conditions posed by the European Commission with regards to allowing the merger, on 29 May 2008 Suez sold its Belgian gas supplier Distrigas to the Italian company Eni for €2.7 billion. On 22 July 2008 the group GDF Suez, a company of €74 billion of annual turnover, was officially created.

<text>The National Association of Towns and Townships (NATaT) is an American lobbying or advocacy group of local government from more than 10,000 communities across the United States.

The Washington, DC–based organization was established 1976, with its founding executive director as Barton Russell. Russell served in this capacity until 1985 at which time he was appointed President of the National Center for Small Communities – NATaT&#x27;s policy development and training arm. Mr. Russell left NATaT in 1994 to launch the Barton Russell Group, a consultancy specializing in the small town America market, it&#x27;s 34,000 communities and the 140 million people who live in them.

NATaT&#x27;s purpose today, as it was in 1976, is to champion fair-share federal funding decisions and to promote legislative and regulatory policies designed to strengthen grassroots local government. For more than 40 years NATaT&#x27;s staff and members have strived to educate lawmakers and other federal officials about the unique nature of small community government operations as well as the need for policies that meet the special needs of suburban and non-metro communities.

NATaT is known in the Nation&#x27;s Capital as the strong voice of #smalltown America.

<doc id="1306090" wikidata="Q7413741" url="?curid=1306090" title="San Diego Super Chargers">
<text>&quot;San Diego Super Chargers&quot; was the fight song of the San Diego Chargers (now known as the Los Angeles Chargers) of the National Football League (NFL). The disco song was written in 1979 during the Air Coryell era of the San Diego Chargers, and it was recorded by a session band dubbed &quot;Captain Q.B. and the Big Boys.&quot; New Chargers owners replaced the song in 1989 with a non-disco cover version, but the original version was revived around 2002. The team itself was also sometimes referred to as the &quot;San Diego Super Chargers&quot;.

==History==
In the 1970s, the Chargers were owned by Gene Klein and ticket sales were lagging after losing seasons. In 1979, the team was playing a winning and exciting style under head coach Don Coryell, popularized by its high-scoring offense, nicknamed &quot;Air Coryell&quot;. Klein started an aggressive marketing campaign that included the song. Klein&#x27;s son, Michael, brought some friends from the recording industry to a few Chargers games, and he requested the creation of a song based on the Chargers&#x27; playing style. &quot;We wanted something that would light up the crowd,&quot; said Michael Klein.

The disco song was written in almost a day by David Sieff and Jerry Marcellino, a producer and songwriter for A&amp;M Records who had worked with artists such as Bobby Darin, Diana Ross and Michael Jackson. Studio musicians in Los Angeles collaborated with the vocalist, Los Angeles R&amp;B singer James Gaylen, to record the song. Marcellino, who also produced the song, named the band Captain Q.B. and the Big Boys on a lark. A 7-inch, 45 rpm single of the song was sold in San Diego, and Marcellino received a quarter for each one sold.

Under new Chargers owner Alex Spanos, who acquired the team in 1984, the song was not played for a few seasons. It was brought back in 1989 with a more modern sound. The cover version was recorded by San Diego singer Leonard Tucker and produced by Bo Donovan. However, the recording was lost when Qualcomm Stadium, the then-home of the Chargers, renovated its sound-system room in the late 1990s.

Around 2002, the Chargers resumed playing the original version by Captain Q.B. and the Big Boys. The song was played by the Chargers at home games after San Diego scores and victories. The team became the Los Angeles Chargers after relocating in 2017.

==General reaction==
Bernie Wilson, Associated Press (AP) sports writer, wrote in his book, &quot;San Diego Chargers&quot;, that the song is &quot;perhaps one of the catchiest fight songs of all-time&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the song &quot;has a distinctly 1970&#x27;s roller disco vibe&quot;. AP referred to the song as a &quot;dated disco smash&quot;, while &quot;The Standard-Times&quot; called it an &quot;infamous piece of NFL kitsch&quot;. Mike Downey of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; commented that the song &quot;has tortured more eardrums than anything Simon Cowell or Paula Abdul ever judged&quot; on &quot;American Idol&quot;. &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; called the song &quot;cool, catchy and camp&quot; and &quot;a local anthem&quot; while noting that the 1989 remake was &quot;ill-advised.&quot;

The &quot;Union-Tribune&quot; noted that a generation of fans grew up hearing the song and associate it with the good times and winning during the Chargers&#x27; Air Coryell era. Safety John Lynch, a San Diego native, sang the song to his Denver Broncos teammates before a 2004 game in his hometown against the Chargers. &quot;When you&#x27;ve grown up with that, it&#x27;s part of you,&quot; he said. After hearing &quot;San Diego Super Chargers&quot; during a 2005 game, Chargers linebacker Donnie Edwards, another San Diego native, had a flashback to his childhood and attending a Chargers game, watching Dan Fouts throwing to Charlie Joiner.

Although the song was blaring during the 1980 AFC Championship Game, Oakland Raiders receiver Bob Chandler said that &quot;a lot of our guys liked it. I kept tapping my feet to it.&quot; The Raiders won the game 34–27. In 1996, Neil Smith of the Kansas City Chiefs said that while he despised the cannon that the Chargers fired after each of their scores, he especially hated their fight song. Prior to the 2007 AFC Championship Game against the Chargers, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said, &quot;I hate that song.&quot; He first heard it when he was an assistant coach with the New York Giants in 1980, when the Chargers won 44–7 while Fouts threw for 444 yards. Belichick called the game a &quot;track meet&quot; and recalled Chargers players such as Chuck Muncie, Kellen Winslow, and John Jefferson. &quot;They didn&#x27;t get through playing that song before they had scored again and they started playing it again. It was &#x27;San Diego Super Chargers,&#x27; that&#x27;s still ringing in my head.&quot;

==Other uses==
Chargers fans played the song in preparation for upcoming games, and some fans even played &quot;San Diego Super Chargers&quot; at their weddings.

The song was known outside of San Diego as well. ESPN football anchors Chris Berman and Tom Jackson sometimes sang &quot;San Diego Super Chargers&quot; when announcing Chargers highlights. Various news sources including ESPN, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; and the New England Sports Network referred to the Chargers team itself as the &quot;San Diego Super Chargers&quot; Chargers offensive guard Doug Wilkerson, who played under Coryell, said, &quot;We were the &#x27;San Diego Super Chargers.&#x27; That song was fast and electric, and so were we.&quot;

<doc id="1306102" wikidata="Q3995665" url="?curid=1306102" title="Torrens Park, South Australia">
<text>Torrens Park is a mainly residential large inner-southern suburb of Adelaide, incorporating some of the foothills and adjacent to the original &quot;Mitcham Village&quot;. It was named after Sir Robert Richard Torrens, the instigator of the Torrens title system of land registration and transfer, who built a large home in the area which he named Torrens Park.

The suburb is in the City of Mitcham local government area, the South Australian House of Assembly electoral district of Waite and the Australian House of Representatives Division of Boothby.

==History==
The name was formally submitted for approval in 1945. Torrens Park is named after Sir Robert Richard Torrens, the third Premier of South Australia and instigator of the Torrens title land title system. Torrens built a large home which he called &quot;Torrens Park&quot; near Mitcham in 1853–4. In 1865 Torrens sold the house to his partner in the Moonta Mines (later founder of the University of Adelaide), Walter Watson Hughes, who enlarged it and later sold it to businessman and philanthropist Robert Barr Smith. It is now part of Scotch College. Although the original gates have recently been removed, the original gatehouse to the Estate is still visible at the corner of Belair Road and Ayr Avenue.

Torrens Park Post Office opened on 24 August 1953 and closed in 1972.

Part of today&#x27;s suburb was laid out in 1917 from the estate of Tom Elder Barr-Smith; various parts of the suburb were originally known as &quot;Glenburnie&quot;, Blytheswoodville, Panchito Park, Blythwood Estate and West Mitcham.

==Geography==
In comparison with most Adelaide suburbs, Torrens Park is quite large. The north end of the suburb is reasonably flat, but as one travels south (towards the foothills) the terrain rises and becomes hilly. Brown Hill Creek runs through the suburb from the south-east to the north-west. Due to the foothills, the rainfall in the City of Mitcham is 25–50 per cent higher than the rainfall on the Adelaide Plains.

Torrens Park is also the location of the Mitcham Square Shopping Centre.

==Politics==
Traditionally, the area has been part of a &quot;blue ribbon Liberal&quot; seat; however, elections in 2022 saw both state and federal seats fall to the opposing Labor Party.

==Schools==
The only school actually located in the suburb is Scotch College.

Nearby Primary Schools:
* Clapham
* Mitcham
* Colonel Light Gardens

Nearby High Schools:
* Unley High School
* Urrbrae Agricultural High School
* Pasadena High School
* Mitcham Girls High School
* Mercedes College

==Public transport==
Public transport to Torrens Park is available through the Belair railway line, to the Mitcham (North-West), Torrens Park (West) and Lynton (South-West) stations. Buses are also available to and from the City along Belair Road.

Route 192 terminates on Kays Road; Routes 194 and 196 pass through the suburb en route to Blackwood Station. Route 171 travels along Princes Road serving the northern side of the suburb and then via Fullarton Road to the city.

<text>Seven Dials is a road junction and neighbourhood in the St Giles district of the London Borough of Camden, within the greater Covent Garden area in the West End of London. Seven streets of the Seven Dials area converge at the roughly circular central roundabout, at the centre of which is a column bearing six sundials – with the column itself acting as the seventh sundial. 

The Seven Dials Trust owns and maintains the column and the sundials and looks after the public realm in collaboration with the local authorities, major land-owners, Historic England and other stakeholders. 

The Seven Dials area retains its original 17th-century street-plan, and many of the original Stuart houses remain, mostly re-faced in the late-18th and early-19th centuries.

A time plaque nearby helps visitors to deduce the time of the day fairly accurately.

==History==

In the middle ages, the area was owned by the monastic hospital of St Giles which specialised in treating lepers, but it was expropriated by Henry VIII in 1537 and later passed into private hands. In the 17th century, a local estate known as Cock and Pye Fields belonged to the Worshipful Company of Mercers, which, to maximise its income in the burgeoning West End, allowed building licences on what until then was open farmland near the developing metropolitan area. The original layout of the Seven Dials area was designed by Thomas Neale during the early 1690s. His plan had six roads converging, although this number was later increased to seven. The sundial column was built with only six faces, with the column itself acting as the gnomon of the seventh dial. This layout was chosen to produce triangular plots, in order to minimise the frontage of houses to be built on the site, as rentals were charged per foot of frontage rather than by the square footage of properties.

After the successful development of the Covent Garden Piazza area nearby, Neale hoped that Seven Dials would be popular with wealthy residents. This was not to be, and the status of the area gradually went down. At one stage, each of the seven apex buildings facing the column housed a pub. By the 19th century, Seven Dials was among the most notorious slums in London, as part of the slum of St Giles. The area was described by Charles Dickens in 1835: In his collection &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;, Dickens remarks, 

The poet John Keats described the area as the last resort for the poor and the ill. 

The relatively low status of the location is also stated by W. S. Gilbert in the operetta &quot;Iolanthe&quot;

It remained a byword for urban poverty during the early 20th century, when Agatha Christie set &quot;The Seven Dials Mystery&quot; (1929) there.

The original sundial column was removed in 1773. It was long believed that it had been pulled down by an angry mob, but recent research suggests it was deliberately removed by the Paving Commissioners in an attempt to rid the area of &quot;undesirables&quot;. The remains were acquired by architect James Paine, who kept them at his house in Addlestone, Surrey, from where they were bought in 1820 by public subscription and re-erected in nearby Weybridge as a memorial to Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia, Duchess of York and Albany. The badly weathered dialstone was not reinstalled on the monument and can be seen adjacent to Weybridge Library.

During the 1840s Seven Dials was a major gathering area for the Chartists in their campaign for electoral reform. However, the illegal activities of some (plans for armed uprisings) were thwarted by the recently established police force.

By 1851 sewers were laid in the area, but poverty intensified in St Giles and in the Seven Dials, although the population began to decrease as workshops and breweries started occupying some of the houses. The model developed by Margaret Frere was established here to support poor children in education; it was adopted throughout London for school social work.

The seven streets at Seven Dials originally had quite different names from what they have now. They were Great Earl Street, Little Earl Street, Great White Lion Street, Little White Lion Street, Great St Andrew&#x27;s Street, Little St Andrew&#x27;s Street and Queen Street. In the 1930s, their names were changed: Great and Little Earl Streets became Earlham Street, Great and Little White Lion Streets became part of an extended Mercer Street, Great and Little St Andrew&#x27;s Streets became Monmouth Street, and Queen Street became Shorts Gardens.

Today, only two houses remain from the original Thomas Neale development of the 1690s; 61 Monmouth Street and 64 Neal Street.

==Seven Dials, 1974 to 2018==
According to Camden Council, the currently defined area &quot;can be found to the north west of Covent Garden Market, and just to the south of Shaftesbury Avenue. The Dials comprise Earlham Street, Monmouth Street, Mercer Street and Shorts Gardens. The area now known as Seven Dials also includes Neal Street and Neals Yard.&quot; Monmouth Street is the only street in Seven Dials to have an official number; the B404. The others are unclassified.

During 1974, Seven Dials was named a Conservation Area with Outstanding Status and during 1977 it was declared a Housing Action Area. By 1984, the Housing Action Area Committee ensured that all of the vacant homes were in some use and was encouraging business to locate in the area. An increasing number of buildings have been restored over the years. Since 1974, over 25 percent of the area&#x27;s buildings have been listed. Presently Seven Dials is a prosperous, largely commercial neighbourhood in the WC2 postcode area between the West End theatre district of Shaftesbury Avenue and the fashionable shopping district around nearby Neal&#x27;s Yard. It is dominated by generally slow-moving traffic in the narrow streets, which are usually crowded with people.

The replacement sundial pillar, commissioned by The Seven Dials Trust, (formerly The Seven Dials Monument Charity), was constructed during 1988–89 to the original design. It was unveiled by Beatrix of the Netherlands during June 1989, on a visit to commemorate the tercentenary of the reign of William III and Mary II, during which the area was developed. The monument is owned by, and continues to be maintained by, The Seven Dials Trust whose mandate also includes improving the area, working with landowners as well as national and local agencies.

In 1994, Sir Alan Bates established the Tristan Bates Theatre, an Off West End fringe theatre venue with a 100-seat capacity located at the Actors Centre on Tower Street. Bates and his other son, Tristan&#x27;s surviving twin brother Benedick, dedicated this to his memory following his sudden 1990 asthma attack death. It has since been refurbished and renamed the Seven Dials Playhouse.

By late 2017, investment company Shaftesbury plc owned an increasing number of the buildings, a &quot;huge chunk&quot; of the area, according to one news report. At that time, significant changes were occurring in the business properties including the conversion of a mall owned by Shaftesbury plc, Thomas Neal&#x27;s Warehouse, into a single store that might become the main store for a major retailer and the conversion of a warehouse into office space.

On one of the seven apexes remains a pub, &quot;The Crown&quot;. On another apex is the Cambridge Theatre, and on a third the Radisson Edwardian Mercer Street Hotel. On another is the Comyn Ching Triangle, a block of old buildings renovated during the 1980s. Despite some redevelopment, many original buildings remain. There are two historic plaques in the area, one at 13 Monmouth Street, where Brian Epstein managed his company and another in Neal&#x27;s Yard, at the &quot;Animation, Editing and Recording Studios of Monty Python&quot;, actually the studios and offices of Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam from 1976 to 1987.

A November 2017 report describes Seven Dials as follows:

==The monument==

Neale commissioned the architect and stonemason Edward Pierce to design and construct a sundial pillar during 1693–94. The original drawing in brown ink with a grey wash is in the British Museum collection.

On top of an eight-foot (2.4m) tall plinth, there is a 20-foot (6.1m) tall Doric column. The sculpture that contains the six sundials and the pinnacle is ten foot (3m) tall. This block is arranged with direct north and south facing vertical dials, and four vertically declining dials. The monument was erected during 1694, but removed during 1773.
Reconstruction of the replica was launched by the Seven Dials Trust during 1985 and erected during 1989. It was the first project of its kind in London since the erection of Nelson&#x27;s Column in the 1840s. The dials were designed, carved and gilded by Caroline Webb, while the astronomer Gordon Taylor verified the mathematics. Each of the faces is accurate to within ten seconds. The dials give local apparent solar time, so a correction must be made using the conversion graph displayed on the plinth to work out clock time. Seven dials is 0° 07&#x27; geographical degrees to the west of Greenwich – that is 3.048 seconds behind Greenwich Mean Time.

<text>Prince Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł (; 26 October 1625 or 26 October 1635 – 14 November 1680) was a Polish–Lithuanian noble and magnate. He is sometimes referred to as &quot;the first&quot; Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł, to distinguish him from the other member of his family to use the name.

He held the following titles: Majorat of Nieśwież, Master of the Pantry of Lithuania (since 1652), Carver of Lithuania (since 1653), Cupbearer of Lithuania (since 1656), castellan of Vilnius (since 1661), Voivode of the Vilnius Voivodeship (since 1667), Deputy Chancellor of Lithuania (1668) and Field Hetman of Lithuania. He was also a starost of Upytė, Przemyśl, Człuchów, Kamieniec, Chojnice, Lida, Telšiai, Rabsztyn, Choteń, Homel, Oster, Gulbin, and several other towns in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Between 2 May and 18 July 1661, he served as the Marshal of the ordinary Sejm held in Warsaw. He married Katarzyna Sobieska, the sister of the King of Poland John III Sobieski on 16 June 1658.

Unlike his cousins, Janusz Radziwiłł and Bogusław Radziwiłł, he was one of the members of the Radziwiłł family who valiantly fought in the defence of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during The Deluge.

<text>The River Yox is a river in the English county of Suffolk. It flows from the west of Peasenhall through Sibton and Yoxford where it becomes the Minsmere River. The Yox was originally fordable at Yoxford where a modern road bridge allows the A12 to cross the river.

The river valley is largely drained and used as grassland with some arable use at Sibton. Some peat deposits are present. The valley has a narrow floodplain with water meadows and has largely been drained using a system of dykes.

== Wildlife ==

As of 2018, the river at Yoxford was seen to contain sticklebacks, brown trout, frogs, newts, grass snakes, and otters. Eels were seen in 2017. Kingfishers have not been observed since 2017, nor have any water voles. Hitherto there had been a large population of water voles along a large stretch of the river, but regular predation by domestic cats has been observed. As of 2020, water voles and kingfishers have been regularly seen on a stretch of the river behind Yoxford High Street.

<doc id="1306113" wikidata="Q1194749" url="?curid=1306113" title="Government of Spain">
<text>The government of Spain () is the central government which leads the executive branch and the General State Administration of the Kingdom of Spain.

The Government consists of the Prime Minister and the Ministers; the prime minister has the overall direction of the Ministers and can appoint or terminate their appointments freely. The ministers also belong to the supreme decision-making body, known as the Council of Ministers. The Government is responsible before the Parliament (), and more precisely before the Congress of the Deputies, a body which elects the Prime Minister or dismisses them through a motion of censure. This is because Spain is a parliamentary system established by the Constitution of 1978.

Its fundamental regulation is placed in Title IV of the Constitution, as well as in Title V of that document, with respect to its relationship with the , and in Law 50/1997, of 27 November, of the Government. According to Article 97 of the Constitution and Article 1.1 of the Government Act, &quot;&quot;the Government directs domestic and foreign policy, the civil and military administration and the defense of the State. It exercises the executive function and the regulatory regulation according to the Constitution and the laws&quot;.

The current prime minister is Pedro Sánchez, who took office on 2 June 2018. He is the leader of the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party, and he leads his third cabinet since late 2023.

The Government is occasionally referred to by the metonymy &quot;Moncloa&quot;, because the residence of the Prime Minister, the Palace of Moncloa, is also the headquarters of the Government.

==Principles==
The Government&#x27;s performance is governed by the following operating principles:

* Principle of presidential direction: The Prime Minister directs the Ministers and can appoint or dismiss them freely.
* Principle of responsibility: The Prime Minister responds politically to the Congress of Deputies for the action of the Government. The eventual cessation of the Prime Minister implies the cessation of the Government.
* Principle of collegiality: The Government, understood as Council of Ministers, is a collegiate body composed of a plurality of members of the Government.
* Principle of solidarity: The Government responds in solidum for the action of each one of the members of the Government.
* Departmental principle: The members of the Government, as well as members of this collegiate body, are also the heads of a department in charge of a more or less homogeneous area of competence.

== Government in Parliament ==

The Kingdom of Spain is a constitutional monarchy in which executive decisions are made by the Government. More specifically, the Spanish Constitution describes Spain&#x27;s form of government as &quot;monarquía parlamentaria&quot;, or parliamentary monarchy, in which the monarch acts as a moderator rather than a source of executory authority. Spain possesses an asymmetric bicameral parliament, called the &quot;&quot;, composed of the Congress of Deputies and the Senate. While both the Congress and Senate propose legislation, albeit by different procedural mechanisms, the Government has the right to be consulted for such proposals. The Government may also propose law directly. A Government-sponsored bill is known as a &quot;proyecto de ley&quot;, contrasting with a &quot;proposición de ley&quot; which is offered by a house of parliament.

Neither the prime minister nor the ministers need to be members of parliament, but the Government must account to both the Senate and Congress every week in a parliamentary meeting known as a &quot;sesión de control&quot; (control session) (). Questioning minor-rank ministers, such as Secretaries of State or Under Secretaries, must be done in Parliamentary Committees. While the prime minister is typically elected from the members of Congress, the current prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, was not a member of either chamber for the first year of his premiership.

Under the parliamentary system, the Government is required to maintain the confidence of the Congress of Deputies. In the absence of such confidence, the Government may fall or prove unable to pass legislation. There are two procedures to ascertain the Congress&#x27;s confidence in the Government: the motion of no-confidence (), by which members of parliament can ask the Congress to rescind its confidence in the prime minister and to elect another, and the question of confidence (), by which the prime minister asks the Congress if it supports the Government&#x27;s political programs generally or a specific piece of legislation. A loss by the Government in either case may result in the removal of the prime minister.

== The Government and the Crown ==
The Spanish monarch, currently King Felipe VI, is the head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. As a monarch of a parliamentary monarchy, the executive power does not belong to The Crown and is independent from it. The Constitution gives the monarch a symbolic role, but also a moderating role, being able to intervene if there is a conflict between the country&#x27;s institutions ().

As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, former King Juan Carlos I suppressed the 23-F Spanish coup d&#x27;état attempt in February 1981, showing that the monarch has more power than the constitution grants him. The heir presumptive is Leonor, Princess of Asturias.

The Constitution also gives the monarch some powers known as Royal Prerogatives. These prerogatives range from the signing of international treaties, to declaring war and making peace or to dissolving the parliament. However, with the arrival of democracy, these prerogatives have been regulated and most of them must be countersigned by an official.

Although the monarch is not part of the executive power, the prime minister has weekly meetings with him to inform him about the Government&#x27;s activity and the King can express his opinion. In the same sense, the monarch is normally invited to the first Council of Ministers of every new government (and others if the prime ministers wants to) and to the meetings of bodies such as the National Security Council or the National Defence Council.

The Royal prerogatives are:

===Domestic powers===
* The power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister. This power is exercised by the monarch himself. By convention he appoints the individual with most support of the Congress.
* The power to dismiss and appoint other ministers. This power is exercised by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister.
* The power to assent to and enact laws by giving Royal Assent to Bills passed by Parliament, which is required in order for a law to make it into a law. This prerogative is exercised by the monarch but needs the countersignature of the prime minister. It is not constitutionally allowed for him to refuse to sign a law passed by Parliament.
* The power to assent to and enact norms with a lower rank than law. This prerogative is exercised by the monarch but needs the countersignature of the prime minister, a minister, the president of the Congress, or the Senate (depending on the kind of norm).
* The power to call for a referendum. This is exercised with the countersignature of the prime minister after being requested by the Council of Ministers.
* The power to command the Armed Forces of Spain. This prerogative is delegated to the prime minister and the minister of Defence.
* The power to give royal pardons, in Spain known as right of grace (&quot;derecho de gracia&quot;). This is exercised by the monarch but the decision of whom to pardon is delegated to the Minister of Justice and the Council of Ministers.
* The power to be informed of the affairs of State and chair the sessions of the Council of Ministers. It is exercised after being requested by the prime minister.
* The power to grant civil and military jobs. This prerogative requires a Government countersignature.
* The power to appoint civil or military members of his private household.
* The power to use freely the budget of his household.
* The power to grant (and also to cancel and annul) honours.
* The power of high patronage of the Royal Academies.
* The power to grant sports teams, federations, and other sports organizations the title of &quot;Real&quot; (Royal).

===Foreign powers===
* The power to ratify and make treaties.
* The power to declare war and conclude peace with other nations.
* The power to credit and receive diplomats.

==Members==
&quot;To see the current members, see Council of Ministers.&quot;

According to Article 98 of the Spanish Constitution and Article 1.2 of the Government Law, the Government of Spain is composed of:
* The Prime Minister.
* The Deputy Prime Minister or Deputy Prime Ministers (If there are more than one).
* The Ministers.
* Other members. There is the possibility of incorporating other figures into Government by law (such as Secretaries of State). However, this constitutional possibility has not yet been used.

===Requirements===
In accordance with article 11 of the Law of the Government, &quot;to be a member of the Government it is required to be Spanish, adult, to enjoy the rights of active and passive suffrage, as well as not to be disabled to exercise employment or public office by sentence Judicial firm&quot;.&quot;

===Criminal privileges===
The members of the Government enjoy their own criminal procedure so that they will only be tried by the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court.

The initiation of a case for treason or against the security of the State can only respond to the initiative of a quarter of the Congress of Deputies, approved by an absolute majority thereof, and can not be granted a pardon in such cases.

==Caretaker government==
The Caretaker Government is regulated in Section 101 of the Spanish Constitution which says that &quot;the Government shall resign after the holding of general elections, in the event of loss of parliamentary confidence as provided in the Constitution, or on the resignation or death of the President. The outgoing Government shall continue as acting body until the new Government takes office&quot;.

Between the approval of the Constitution in 1978 and the approval of the Government Act of 1997, there were no explicit limitations to the Government powers while acting as acting government except for what the doctrine and parliamentary practice said. With this constitutional precept it was intended that the succession of one Government by another does not affect the fundamental continuity of the governmental action or that paralysis or dysfunctions occur in the system as a whole. This need of not leaving a modern state without its central governing body is explained very well in a Supreme Court sentence saying that &quot;It is easy to understand that Spain can not run out of government even for a few hours&quot;.

In 1997 the Government Act was passed; the Caretaker Government is regulated in Title 4. In addition to the aforementioned constitutional provisions, Section 21 of the Government Act establishes that &quot;the caretaker government shall facilitate the normal development of the process of formation of the new Government and the transfer of powers to it and limit its duties to the ordinary office of public affairs, abstaining from adopting, except in cases of urgency duly accredited or for reasons of general interest whose accreditation expressly justifies it, any other measures&quot;.

This article also establishes explicit limitations on the Prime Minister, preventing him from &quot;proposing to the King the dissolution of any of the Chambers or the , raising the question of confidence, or proposing to the King the calling for a consultative referendum&quot; and on the Government prohibiting it from &quot;the approval of the State General Budget Bill or presenting bills to the &quot;. The government neither may exercise the legislative delegations that the parliament has granted to it while acting as a caretaker government.

On the occasion of the 2015–2016 caretaker government of Mariano Rajoy, the Government refused repeatedly to submit to the control of the Congress of Deputies alleging that there was no trust relationship between both powers for the fact of being a caretaker government and, therefore, there was no control of the legislative power over the executive. Faced with this situation, the Congress denounced the Executive Power before the Constitutional Court for refusing to submit to its control and, on 22 November 2018, the high court ruled that the Government &quot;undermined the constitutional attribution&quot; that the Constitution confers on Congress and that although &quot;control of the Government&#x27;s action will normally be exercised within the framework of the confidence that must exist between the Government and the Congress of Deputies&quot;, this does not mean that &quot;exceptionally, as are the periods in which there is no relationship of trust between Congress and the Government, the aforementioned control function can not be exercised&quot; since &quot;the control function that corresponds to the is implicit in its representative character and in the form of parliamentary government that establishes Article 1.3 of the Constitution, not being able to deny the Chambers all exercise of the control function, since this would affect to the balance of powers foreseen in our Constitution&quot;.

The longest caretaker government of the Spanish politics since the restoration of democracy in 1977 has been the 2015–2016 Rajoy government with a record of 316 days.

==Location==

The Office of the Prime Minister as well as the official headquarters of the Government are located in the Palace of Moncloa, outside Madrid. The Council of Ministers meetings also take place here. In this palace is also the office of the deputy prime minister, the headquarters of the Ministry of the Presidency and the office of the Government&#x27;s Spokesperson. Most of the government departments are located in the centre of the city of Madrid, each having its own buildings. One of the most famous places where ministries are located is the gubernatorial complex of New Ministries.

==Advisory bodies==
The Spanish Government has two main advisory bodies:

* The Council of State, which advise the Government in legal matters and all the issues that does not correspond to the other advisory body.
* The Economic and Social Council, responsible for advising the Government in socioeconomic and labour matters.

==Budget==

The General State Budget is considered one of the most important legislations that a Government can pass. According to the Constitution, the Government is the only body that can make the Budget bill, although it is the parliament who must accept it, reject it or propose modifications. If the Congress approves a full budget amend, the budget is automatically rejected.

==Devolved governments==

Since the approval of the Constitution of 1978, Spain was established as a decentralized unitary country which grants its regions a high degree of autonomy. The first two regions to be granted autonomy were the Basque Country and Catalonia in 1979. In 1981, four further regions achieved their autonomy: Andalusia, Asturias, Cantabria and Galicia. A year later, seven more regions were granted autonomy: Aragon, the Canary Islands, Castile-La Mancha, Navarre, Murcia and La Rioja. The last four regions to get their autonomy were the Balearic Islands, Castile and León, Extremadura and Madrid, all of them in 1983.

The Constitution also grants the cities of Ceuta and Melilla autonomy, which they got in 1995. The Constitution also gives them the possibility to become fully autonomous communities, but so far these cities have not requested the activation of this clause.

<doc id="1306117" wikidata="Q6836680" url="?curid=1306117" title="Michele Aboro">
<text>Michele Aboro (born 17 July 1967) is a British former professional boxer who competed from 1995 to 2001. She retired an undefeated world champion, having held the WIBF super-bantamweight title from 2000 to 2001.

Michele Aboro, along with her countrywoman Michelle Sutcliffe and German Regina Halmich, became an important figure in European women&#x27;s boxing, helping raise awareness about female participation in a traditionally male sport.

She was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2020.

==Professional career==
On 4 March 1995 she debuted as a professional boxer, with a first round knockout win over Marleen Lambert in Belgium. As a matter of a fact, her first three professional fights were held in different European countries (Belgium, Italy and Hungary) and they were all first-round knockout wins for Aboro. Her fourth fight, on 19 October 1996 against Severine Grandsire, was her first fight in Germany, and Aboro won by a sixth-round technical knockout.

Aboro had one more win, and then, on 29 November 1997, she met future world champion Daisy Lang, defeating Lang by a six-round decision.

On 22 August 1998 Aboro fought Brigitte Pastor for the vacant WIBF European Super Bantamweight title, knocking out Pastor in five rounds to win her first professional belt. She defended her title once, knocking out Galina Gumliiska in eight rounds on 28 November, then followed that win with four more wins in a row, before obtaining her first world title opportunity. Aboro became a world champion when she fought Eva Jones, on 5 February 2000, knocking Jones out in round ten to become the WIBF&#x27;s world Super Bantamweight champion.

Then came Downtown Leona Brown&#x27;s challenge. Aboro met the future world champion on 13 June that year, defeating Brown by a ten-round decision.

After two, non-title wins, she faced the highly touted contender Kelsey Jeffries, who had 10 wins and only 2 losses coming into their bout, for her second world championship defence. Aboro defended the title successfully against Jeffries on 10 February 2001, with a ten-round decision win.

After one more non-title win, Aboro made what has been, to date, her last fight. On 24 November that year she beat Nadia Debras, who she had previously beaten, by a ten-round decision, to retain her world title for the third time.

Aboro has not officially announced her retirement. However, should she decide to remain inactive and, ultimately, to retire from boxing, she would join Rocky Marciano and a handful of others in boxing&#x27;s history to retire as an undefeated world champion.

As of 2019, Aboro is a resident of Amsterdam, Netherlands.

<doc id="1306122" wikidata="Q2900494" url="?curid=1306122" title="Beyond Blue">
<text>Beyond Blue is an Australian mental health and wellbeing support organisation. They provide support programs to address issues related to depression, suicide, anxiety disorders and other related mental illnesses.

The organisation works in partnership with governments, local health services, educational institutions, workplaces, media and community organisations, as well as the general community to raise community awareness about anxiety and depression and reduce the associated stigma. Beyond Blue was founded in 2000 by former premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. It is currently chaired by Julia Gillard, former prime minister of Australia. Gillard is supported by CEO Georgie Harman, and Deputy Chair Kate Carnell.

==History==

Beyond Blue began in October 2000 as a five-year initiative of the Australian Government and state and territory governments after a period of public debate on the treatment of depression sufferers assisted by intensive and persistent lobbying by former Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. The aim was to raise awareness of depression and to reduce the associated stigma.

Politicians who have encouraged people to both donate to and utilise the services of Beyond Blue include Geoff Gallop and John Brogden.

Since 2006, the Australian Football League has supported the organisation with the Beyond Blue Cup awarded annually to the winner of clashes between the Geelong and Hawthorn football clubs.

In March 2017, it was announced that former prime minister Julia Gillard would take over as chair of Beyond Blue from founder and chairman Jeff Kennett. Gillard replaced Kennett on 2 July 2017.

==Work==
Beyond Blue addresses a range of mental health issues in Australia, including mental health stigma, indigenous issues, post-natal depression, school based interventions, and youth mental health.

===LGBT Australians===
In 2011, Jeff Kennett remarked publicly that children of gay and lesbian parents have worse mental health outcomes, and amid a resulting controversy Beyond Blue staff and supporters called on the organisation to create specific programs for gay and lesbian Australians. In 2012, Beyond Blue launched a $1.5 million year-long campaign to reduce discrimination against gay, lesbian and transgender people in Australia. In 2015, the organisation issued a statement in support of same-sex marriage.

In 2018, Beyond Blue rejected a donation of $5,000 from wrestler Dave Marshall. Marshall, who is gay, publicly stated the donation was a portion of the money he earned selling pornographic photos and videos. Beyond Blue subsequently said they would not accept money that comes from &quot;gambling, alcohol or pornography&quot;. Beyond Blue clarified that they would accept the donation if Marshall removed their name from his platforms to ensure “future consumers of your products are not given the impression their purchase is in any way supporting Beyond Blue”. Marshall instead donated the money to the suicide prevention Black Dog Institute.

==Activism==
In 2013, Beyond Blue campaigned against the insurance industry&#x27;s discrimination against people who have experienced anxiety and depression. They also launched a campaign featuring actor Ben Mendelsohn as the character &quot;Anxiety&quot;, describing symptoms and how it feels to experience anxiety, and conducted a survey into the mental health of doctors and medical students finding very high rates of anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts.

A 2015 survey of 1,200 Australians by TNS Australia revealed that one in five Australians still believe that people with anxiety are just &quot;putting it on&quot;. In 2016, Beyond Blue launched another campaign on radio and TV to raise awareness of anxiety and its symptoms, with actor Guy Pearce providing the voice over.

Men are a key audience for Beyond Blue and the Man Therapy campaign achieved widespread coverage. The campaign was a &quot;first of its kind&quot; program in Australia and featured a humorous character, &quot;Dr Brian Ironwood&quot;, urging men to take action when it comes to their wellbeing. Launched in 2013, it was an international collaboration with the Colorado Office for Suicide Prevention, whose Man Therapy was adapted for an Australian audience. The campaign was programmed to last one year. Ipsos Social Research Institute evaluated the campaign&#x27;s effectiveness for Beyond Blue and found that 1/3 of men 18 and over recognised the Man Therapy campaign, 280,000 visited the website and 5–15% of men aware of the campaign changed their attitudes to mental health.

Beyond Blue and AOMB also reached agreement to fundraise an initiative to raise awareness of anxiety and depression in Australia by organising several charity events.

Writing in &quot;The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry&quot;, Rob Whitley criticised Beyond Blue&#x27;s advertising as blaming men for their mental health issues. For example, the front page of Beyond Blue&#x27;s website stating &quot;Men are known for bottling things up&quot;.

== Helpline ==
Beyond Blue provides support for individuals struggling with anxiety and depression through their helpline. The helpline is accessible 24 hours a day, providing immediate support to those in need. The helpline number is 1300 224 636. This service allows individuals to speak with a trained mental health professional who can provide advice and guide callers to appropriate resources.

She returned to higher education, earning a PhD in English and Comparative Literature at Goldsmiths, University of London in 2019, where, according to Ward, her research focused on &quot;thought experiments in philosophy of mind and the use of narrative in philosophy, looking at issues of consciousness and AI, and the meeting between literature and philosophy.&quot;

==Acting career==
Ward started work as an actress when she was aged 10, and has worked in film, television and theatre. She trained as a dancer under ballerina Merle Park. She had an early film role in &quot;Full Circle&quot; (1977). In 1983, she had a brief, non-speaking role at the very end of the Tony Scott vampire movie &quot;The Hunger&quot;; in the credits, her character is listed as &quot;Girl In London House&quot;. Another early film role was in the film &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1985), directed by Barry Levinson. Other films included &quot;Return to Oz&quot; (1985) playing Princess Mombi II, &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; (1987) and &quot;A Summer Story&quot; (1988), and she also portrayed a dancer in Roxy Music&#x27;s 1982 music video &quot;Avalon&quot;.

She has appeared in several Glasgow Citizens&#x27; Theatre productions including &quot;Private Lives&quot; (as Amanda), &quot;Don Carlos&quot; (as Queen Elizabeth) and in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (as Ophelia).

Her later films include &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; (2003), in which she co-starred with Sophia Myles and Celia Imrie, and &quot;Book of Blood&quot; (2008), co-starring Jonas Armstrong and Reg Fuller. She also appeared in Cary Fukunaga&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (2011). She has worked with Susan Sarandon in &quot;The Hunger&quot; directed by Tony Scott, Liv Ullmann in &quot;&quot;, directed by Mauro Bolognini, and Elizabeth Taylor in &quot;Young Toscanini&quot; (1988), directed by Franco Zeffirelli.

Her television work includes the mini-series &quot;A Dark-Adapted Eye&quot; with Helena Bonham Carter, and the fantasy &quot;Dinotopia&quot;. From 2004 until 2006, Ward had the recurring role of Dr Helen Trent in long-running ITV drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. In 2008, Ward joined the cast of &quot;Holby City&quot; in a recurring role as Sophia Byrne. She appeared in the BBC series &quot;Land Girls&quot; from 2009 to 2011.

Ward was considered a &quot;Face of the 1980s&quot; as a &quot;Vogue&quot; model.

===Acting awards and recognition===

Ward acted in the 1982 Academy Award-winning short film, &quot;A Shocking Accident&quot;. Her role in the first (2009) series of &quot;Land Girls&quot; earned her a regional (Midlands) RTS Television Award for best acting performance (by a female) in that year.

==Writing==
Especially since beginning her advanced academic work, Ward has been writing professionally, including for newspapers &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and &quot;The Spectator&quot;, and the online journalism network, &quot;The Conversation&quot;. While undertaking her post-graduate study, Ward wrote a short work, &quot;Sunbed&quot;, which won the 2018 Royal Academy Pin Drop Award for new writers, in the short story category.

Ward&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Love and Other Thought Experiments&quot; was published in 2020 by Corsair, an imprint of Little, Brown Book Group. It was longlisted for both the Desmond Elliott Prize and the Booker Prize in its publication year.

Ward&#x27;s second novel &quot;The Schoolhouse&quot; was published in 2022.

==Activism==
Ward has become known as an LGBT activist, and her 2014 long-form essay, a strong statement regarding equality of marriage rights, was published by Guardian Shorts, &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s e-book publishing house. It later appeared in serialised form in issues of the newspaper. Ward has hosted several of the annual European Diversity Awards, including in 2016, 2019, and 2021.

==Personal life==
Ward married veterinary surgeon Paul Hobson in 1988, and the couple have two sons, born in 1989 and 1993. After Ward became involved with Korean-American poet and writer Rena Brannan and came out as a lesbian in 1996, Hobson and Ward divorced. Ward and Brannan had a civil partnership ceremony in 2005, followed by marriage after it was legalised in 2014.

Ward and Brannan divide their time between Britain and the United States.

Ward&#x27;s brother-in-law is comedian Michael McIntyre.

<text>A launch vehicle is typically a rocket-powered vehicle designed to carry a payload (a crewed spacecraft or satellites) from Earth&#x27;s surface or lower atmosphere to outer space. The most common form is the ballistic missile-shaped multistage rocket, but the term is more general and also encompasses vehicles like the Space Shuttle. Most launch vehicles operate from a launch pad, supported by a launch control center and systems such as vehicle assembly and fueling. Launch vehicles are engineered with advanced aerodynamics and technologies, which contribute to high operating costs.

An orbital launch vehicle must lift its payload at least to the boundary of space, approximately and accelerate it to a horizontal velocity of at least . Suborbital vehicles launch their payloads to lower velocity or are launched at elevation angles greater than horizontal.

Practical orbital launch vehicles use chemical propellants such as solid fuel, liquid hydrogen, kerosene, liquid oxygen, or hypergolic propellants.

Launch vehicles are classified by their orbital payload capacity, ranging from small-, medium-, heavy- to super-heavy lift.

==History==
==Mass to orbit==
Launch vehicles are classed by NASA according to low Earth orbit payload capability:

*Small-lift launch vehicle: &lt; - e.g. Vega
*Medium-lift launch vehicle: - e.g. Soyuz ST
*Heavy-lift launch vehicle: &gt; - e.g. Ariane 5
*Super-heavy lift vehicle: &gt; - e.g. Saturn V

Sounding rockets are similar to small-lift launch vehicles, however they are usually even smaller and do not place payloads into orbit. A modified SS-520 sounding rocket was used to place a 4-kilogram payload (TRICOM-1R) into orbit in 2018.

==General information==
Orbital spaceflight requires a satellite or spacecraft payload to be accelerated to very high velocity. In the vacuum of space, reaction forces must be provided by the ejection of mass, resulting in the rocket equation. The physics of spaceflight are such that rocket stages are typically required to achieve the desired orbit.

Expendable launch vehicles are designed for one-time use, with boosters that usually separate from their payload and disintegrate during atmospheric reentry or on contact with the ground. In contrast, reusable launch vehicles are designed to be recovered intact and launched again. The Falcon 9 is an example of a reusable launch vehicle. As of 2023, all reusable launch vehicles that were ever operational have been partially reusable, meaning some components are recovered and others are not. This usually means the recovery of specific stages, usually just the first stage, but sometimes specific components of a rocket stage may be recovered while others are not. The Space Shuttle, for example, recovered and reused its solid rocket boosters, the Space Shuttle orbiter that also acted as a second stage, and the engines used by the core stage (the RS-25, which was located at the back of the orbiter), however the fuel tank that the engines sourced fuel from, which was separate from the engines, was not reused.

For example, the European Space Agency is responsible for the Ariane V, and the United Launch Alliance manufactures and launches the Delta IV and Atlas V rockets.

===Launch platform locations===

Launchpads can be located on land (spaceport), on a fixed ocean platform (San Marco), on a mobile ocean platform (Sea Launch), and on a submarine. Launch vehicles can also be launched from the air.

===Flight regimes===
A launch vehicle will start off with its payload at some location on the surface of the Earth. To reach orbit, the vehicle must travel vertically to leave the atmosphere and horizontally to prevent re-contacting the ground. The required velocity varies depending on the orbit but will always be extreme when compared to velocities encountered in normal life.

Launch vehicles provide varying degrees of performance. For example, a satellite bound for Geostationary orbit (GEO) can either be directly inserted by the upper stage of the launch vehicle or launched to a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). A direct insertion places greater demands on the launch vehicle, while GTO is more demanding of the spacecraft. Once in orbit, launch vehicle upper stages and satellites can have overlapping capabilities, although upper stages tend to have orbital lifetimes measured in hours or days while spacecraft can last decades.

===Distributed launch===
Distributed launch involves the accomplishment of a goal with multiple spacecraft launches. A large spacecraft such as the International Space Station can be constructed by assembling modules in orbit, or in-space propellant transfer conducted to greatly increase the delta-V capabilities of a cislunar or deep space vehicle. Distributed launch enables space missions that are not possible with single launch architectures.

Mission architectures for distributed launch were explored in the 2000s 
and launch vehicles with integrated distributed launch capability built in began development in 2017 with the Starship design. The standard Starship launch architecture is to refuel the spacecraft in low Earth orbit to enable the craft to send high-mass payloads on much more energetic missions.

== Return to launch site ==

After 1980, but before the 2010s, two orbital launch vehicles developed the capability to return to the launch site (RTLS). Both the US Space Shuttle—with one of its abort modes—and the Soviet Buran
had a designed-in capability to return a part of the launch vehicle to the launch site via the mechanism of horizontal-landing of the spaceplane portion of the launch vehicle. In both cases, the main vehicle thrust structure and the large propellant tank were expendable, as had been the standard procedure for all orbital launch vehicles flown prior to that time. Both were subsequently demonstrated on actual orbital nominal flights, although both also had an abort mode during launch that could conceivably allow the crew to land the spaceplane following an off-nominal launch.

In the 2000s, both SpaceX and Blue Origin have privately developed a set of technologies to support vertical landing of the booster stage of a launch vehicle. 
After 2010, SpaceX undertook a development program to acquire the ability to bring back and vertically land a part of the Falcon 9 orbital launch vehicle: the first stage. The first successful landing was done in December 2015, since 2017 rocket stages routinely land either at a landing pad adjacent to the launch site or on a landing platform at sea, some distance away from the launch site. The Falcon Heavy is similarly designed to reuse the three cores comprising its first stage. On its first flight in February 2018, the two outer cores successfully returned to the launch site landing pads while the center core targeted the landing platform at sea but did not successfully land on it.

Blue Origin developed similar technologies for bringing back and landing their suborbital &quot;New Shepard&quot;, and successfully demonstrated return in 2015, and successfully reused the same booster on a second suborbital flight in January 2016. By October 2016, Blue had reflown, and landed successfully, that same launch vehicle a total of five times. The launch trajectories of both vehicles are very different, with New Shepard going straight up and down, whereas Falcon 9 has to cancel substantial horizontal velocity and return from a significant distance downrange. 

Both Blue Origin and SpaceX also have additional reusable launch vehicles under development. Blue is developing the first stage of the orbital New Glenn LV to be reusable, with first flight planned for no earlier than 2024. 
SpaceX has a new super-heavy launch vehicle under development for missions to interplanetary space. The SpaceX Starship is designed to support RTLS, vertical-landing and full reuse of both the booster stage and the integrated second-stage/large-spacecraft that are designed for use with Starship. Its first launch attempt took place in April 2023; however, both stages were lost during ascent. The fifth launch attempt ended with Booster 12 being caught by the launch tower, and Ship 30, the upper stage, successfully landing in the Indian Ocean.

<text>In cellular neuroscience, the soma (: somata or somas; ), neurocyton, or cell body is the bulbous, non-process portion of a neuron or other brain cell type, containing the cell nucleus. Although it is often used to refer to neurons, it can also refer to other cell types as well, including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. The part of the soma without the nucleus is called perikaryon (: perikarya).

There are many different specialized types of neurons, and their sizes vary from as small as about 5 micrometres to over 10 millimetres for some of the smallest and largest neurons of invertebrates, respectively. 

The soma of a neuron (i.e., the main part of the neuron in which the dendrites branch off of) contains many organelles, including granules called Nissl granules, which are composed largely of rough endoplasmic reticulum and free polyribosomes. The cell nucleus is a key feature of the soma. The nucleus is the source of most of the RNA that is produced in neurons. In general, most proteins are produced from mRNAs that do not travel far from the cell nucleus. This creates a challenge for supplying new proteins to axon endings that can be a meter or more away from the soma. Axons contain microtubule-associated motor proteins that transport protein-containing vesicles between the soma and the synapses at the axon terminals. Such transport of molecules towards and away from the soma maintains critical cell functions. In case of neurons, the soma receives a large number of inhibitory synapses, which can regulate the activity of these cells. It has also been shown that microglial processes constantly monitor neuronal functions through somatic junctions, and exert neuroprotection when needed.

The axon hillock is a specialized domain of the neuronal cell body from which the axon originates. A high amount of protein synthesis occurs in this region, as it contains many Nissl granules (which are ribosomes wrapped in RER) and polyribosomes. Within the axon hillock, materials are sorted as either items that will enter the axon (like the components of the cytoskeletal architecture of the axon, mitochondria, etc.) or will remain in the soma. In addition, the axon hillock also has a specialized plasma membrane that contains large numbers of voltage-gated ion channels, since this is most often the site of action potential initiation and triggering.

The survival of some sensory neurons depends on axon terminals making contact with sources of survival factors that prevent apoptosis. The survival factors are neurotrophic factors, including molecules such as nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF interacts with receptors at axon terminals, and this produces a signal that must be transported up the length of the axon to the nucleus. A current theory of how such survival signals are sent from axon endings to the soma includes the idea that NGF receptors are endocytosed from the surface of axon tips and that such endocytotic vesicles are transported up the axon.

Intermediate filaments are abundant in both perikarya and axonal and dendritic processes and are called neurofilaments. The neurofilaments become cross linked with certain fixatives and when impregnated with silver, they form neuro fibrils visible with the light microscope.

<doc id="1306182" wikidata="Q16985338" url="?curid=1306182" title="British Art Show">
<text>The British Art Show (BAS) is a major survey exhibition organised every five years to showcase contemporary British Art. Each time it is organised, the show tours to four UK cities. It usually requires a number of venues in each city to accommodate it. As a snapshot of contemporary British Art, the exhibition has some equivalence to the biennial exhibitions of the Whitney Museum of American Art.

The exhibition is normally curated by two or three people who are appointed for their knowledge of contemporary art. Previously these had been artists and critics, but more recently they have been curators.

The 1990 show caused controversy as it did not include any Scottish artists, even though it opened in Glasgow as part of the city&#x27;s European Capital of Culture programme.

The 1995 show, curated by Richard Cork, Rose Finn-Kelcey and Thomas Lawson, was highly regarded as it spotlighted the emergence of the Young British Artists.

==&quot;British Art Show 5&quot; (2000)==
The 2000 show was selected by Jacqui Poncelet, Pippa Coles and Matthew Higgs, and included more than 50 artists.

==&quot;British Art Show 6&quot; (2005)==
BAS 6 in 2005 was in the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead. It was curated by Andrea Schlieker and Alex Farquharson and included a large number of artists born outside the UK. As the exhibition opened in Gateshead, concern was voiced that few of the artists came from the North East of England. It then travelled to Manchester (January–April), Nottingham (April–June) and Bristol (July–September).

== &quot;British Art Show 7: In the Days of the Comet&quot; (2010) ==

The British Art Show is widely recognised as the most ambitious and influential exhibition of contemporary British art. Organised by Hayward Touring, it takes place every five years and tours to four different cities across the UK. Its seventh incarnation opened in Nottingham, and toured for the first time in 20 years to the Hayward Gallery at Southbank Centre, followed by venues in Glasgow and Plymouth. It was curated by Lisa Le Feuvre and Tom Morton.

The 39 artists were selected on the grounds of their significant contribution to contemporary art in the previous five years. All included artworks were produced between 2005 and 2010, and encompassed sculpture, painting, installation, drawing, photography, film, video, and performance, with many artists creating new works especially for the exhibition. British Art Show 7 marked a change in direction from previous years, moving away from the model of a survey show to an exhibition with a marked curatorial focus.

&quot;The British Art Show has always been at the forefront of innovation, and this incarnation is no exception.&quot; Ralph Rugoff, Director of the Hayward Gallery.

Subtitled &quot;In the Days of the Comet&quot;, British Art Show 7 employed the motif of the comet to explore and draw together a set of concerns that thread their way through the practices of the selected artists. Here the comet alludes to the measuring of time, to historical recurrence, and to parallel worlds. Comets are also commonly understood as harbingers of change, and fittingly the exhibition evolved as it moved from city to city, revealing new works at different venues, creating a unique exhibition in each location.

&quot;We are interested in the recurrent nature of the comet as a symbol of how each version of the present collides with the past and the future, and the work of the artists in British Art Show 7, in many different ways, contests assumptions of how ‘the now’ might be understood.&quot; Lisa Le Feuvre and Tom Morton, Curators of British Art Show 7.

The selected artists were Charles Avery, Karla Black, Becky Beasley, Juliette Blightman, Duncan Campbell, Varda Caivano, Spartacus Chetwynd, Steven Claydon, Cullinan Richards, Matthew Darbyshire, Milena Dragicevic, Luke Fowler, Michael Fullerton, Alasdair Gray, Brian Griffiths, Roger Hiorns, Ian Kiaer,

== &quot;British Art Show 8&quot; (2015)==

<text>Londoners : the days and nights of London now—as told by those who love it, hate it, live it, left it and long for it is a 2011 book by Canadian-born British author, Craig Taylor.

==Synopsis==
The book contains 80 different stories written by Londoners and other associated with the city about their perspective on the city. Those who contributed to the book included the woman who voices station announcements on the London Underground, a man who plants trees along Oxford Street, a British Pakistani currency trader and a guardsman at Buckingham Palace

==Content==
The book is divided into three different parts each one structured around the experiences of Londoners interviewed. The content of the book is then organised as follow:

Part I
* Arriving
* Getting Around
* Seeing the sights
* Earning one&#x27;s keep
* Loving one another
* Getting on with it

Part II 
* Continuing your journey
* Gleaning on the margins
* Feeding the city
* Climbing the ladder
* Putting on a show
* Going out

Part III
* Making a life
* Getting along
* Keeping the peace
* Staying on top
* Living and dying
* Departing

==Reception==
The book was widely praised. &quot;Londonist&quot; declared it &#x27;the best book about London in at least a decade&#x27;. In &quot;The Observer&quot; Alexander Larman wrote that the book was &#x27;immensely enjoyable&#x27; and &#x27;Taylor&#x27;s superb book does full justice to London and its people, and should be enjoyed by everyone, whether they love the place or regret ever having set foot there&#x27;. Oona King remarked that&#x27;the eloquence of the voices in this book is remarkable&#x27; while in the &quot;Wales Arts Review&quot; Adam Somerset wrote &#x27;reading Taylor&#x27;s exhilarating series of snapshots made me want to run for the first train to Euston.
The book was also praised in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and featured on the BBC

<text>Bertrand I. Halperin (born December 6, 1941) is an American physicist, former holder of the Hollis Chair of Mathematicks and Natural Philosophy at the physics department of Harvard University. In 2006, he received the Wolf Prize in Physics for his various contribution to condensed matter physics, including work on KTHNY theory for two-dimensional melting.

== Career ==
Halperin was born in Brooklyn, New York, where he grew up in the Crown Heights neighborhood and attended public schools. His mother was Eva Teplitzky Halperin and his father Morris Halperin. His mother was a college administrator and his father a customs inspector. Both his parents were born in USSR. His paternal grandmother&#x27;s family the Maximovs claimed descent from Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov (BeShT).

He attended Harvard University (class of 1961), and did his graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, with John J. Hopfield (PhD 1965). 

After working at Bell Laboratories for 10 years (1966–1976), Murray Hill, New Jersey he was appointed professor of physics at Harvard University.

== Work ==
In the 1970s, he, together with David Robert Nelson, worked out a theory of two-dimensional melting, predicting the hexatic phase before it was experimentally observed by Pindak &quot;et al.&quot; In the 1980s, he made contributions to the theory of the quantum Hall effect and of the fractional quantum Hall effect. His recent interests lie in the area of strongly interacting low-dimensional electron systems.

== Honors and awards ==
Halperin was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1972, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1981, a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1982, and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1990. In 2001, he was awarded the Lars Onsager Prize. In 2003, he was awarded the Wolf Prize in physics for his work on &quot;two- dimensional melting, disordered systems and strongly interacting electrons&quot;, the other half went to Anthony James Leggett. In 2016 he was Lise Meitner Distinguished Lecturer.

In 2018, he was awarded the 2019 APS Medal for Exceptional Achievement in Research, for &quot;his seminal contributions to theoretical condensed matter physics, especially his pioneering work on the role of topology in both classical and quantum systems.&quot;

<text>Lucius is a masculine given name which began use as Lucius (Latin ; ), abbreviated L., one of the small group of common Latin forenames () found in the culture of ancient Rome. Lucius probably derives from Latin word (gen. ), meaning &quot;light&quot; (&lt;PIE *&quot;leuk-&quot;, &quot;brightness&quot;), related to the Latin verb (&quot;to shine&quot;) and cognate to the name Lucas. Another proposed etymology is derivation from Etruscan &quot;Lauchum&quot; (or &quot;Lauchme&quot;) meaning &quot;king&quot;, which was more directly transferred into Latin as . 

Lucia and Lucy are feminine forms of the name.

In addition, Lucius is a British masculine given name and an Austrian, German, Luxembourgish and Dutch surname. Lucius has been translated into Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, as Lucio. Derived from the related patronymic &quot;Lucianus&quot; is &quot;Luciano&quot; in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese, &quot;Lucien&quot; in French and &quot;Luken&quot; in Basque.

<text>Joe Reiniger (born December 7, 1970, in Collinsville, Illinois) is a professional soccer player and coach. He grew up in Caseyville.

Reiniger has played forward for the St. Louis Ambush, Milwaukee Wave, and the St. Louis Steamers. He went to college at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and graduated in 1993. He was selected in the first round of the NPSL amateur draft by the Ambush in 1993, and was named to the 1993-94 NPSL All-Rookie Team. While playing with the Wave, he was the MVP of the 2001 NPSL Championship. His number is 21. He plays forward and is left footed, but right-handed. He&#x27;s married to Kim, and has a daughter named Jordyn. He resides in Collinsville.

During the 2005–06 season while St. Louis Steamers head coach Omid Namazi was on a suspension, he served as the head coach.
On April 1, 2006, he scored his 600th career goal in front of 8,795 fans at the Savvis Center in St. Louis, Missouri. Retro jerseys were being worn by the players that night and were auctioned to the fans. The winning bidder of Reiniger&#x27;s jersey bought it for 950 dollars and gave it back to him.

In September 2006, the Steamers were placed on the inactive list for the 2006–2007 season and the MISL had a draft. The Milwaukee Wave got the rights of Reiniger, but he did not sign a contract with them.

In November 2008, he signed with the St. Louis Illusion in the Professional Arena Soccer League.

In September 2011, he joined the Illinois Piasa as co-head coach for the 2011–12 season.

<text>Stephen Taylor Beuerlein (born March 7, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. After his playing career, he became an NFL and college football analyst for CBS.

==Early life==
In his senior year, Beuerlein led Anaheim&#x27;s Servite High School to the California Interscholastic Federation 1982 Southern Section Big Five championship, where he was named player of the year. In the first game of the year he played against Ohio&#x27;s famed Moeller High School. Although Servite led Moeller early in the 4th quarter, Moeller won 29–15, but Beuerlein&#x27;s performance caught the eye of Notre Dame head coach Gerry Faust, who had coached for 18 years at Moeller prior to taking the Notre Dame job. After Servite went on to win its final eleven games en route to a 31–7 victory over Long Beach Poly in the CIF-SS Big 5 championship game (and a #4 national ranking), Faust offered Beuerlein a full scholarship, and he attended Notre Dame the following year.

==College career==
As a true freshman in the 1983 Notre Dame season, the 18-year-old Beuerlein got his first start in the fourth game, relieving senior quarterback and four-year starter Blair Kiel, who had begun the season with a 1–2 record. Beuerlein started the remaining eight games of the regular season, splitting playing time with Kiel, and winning his first five starts. He lost his final three starts of the regular season in close games decided by five points or less, but the Irish&#x27; 6–5 record was good enough for a Liberty Bowl bid, where Kiel got the start for the first time since the Miami game and led the Irish to a 19–18 victory over Doug Flutie&#x27;s 13th-ranked Boston College team.

Beuerlein entered his sophomore 1984 season as the starter at quarterback. In the fifth game of the season against #14 Miami, he was knocked out of the game with an injury to his throwing shoulder. He missed only one game, and started the rest of the season&#x27;s games, taking repeated cortisone injections. He led the Irish to a 4–1 finish to the regular season and a 7–4 record, losing only to #11 South Carolina, and with victories at #6 LSU and #14 USC, before losing in the Aloha Bowl to #10 SMU. In that game, Beuerlein noticed a deterioration in the condition of his throwing shoulder, which had been worsening since the injury. Beuerlein also blamed the injury on throwing a school-record 18 interceptions. After an unsuccessful offseason rehab, Notre Dame sent Beuerlein to a California orthopedist in April, where the doctor discovered a bone chip in his collarbone, which had ground away much of his acromioclavicular joint. He had surgery immediately, which removed an inch of his collarbone and the entire remaining parts of his AC joint.

Five months after surgery to his throwing shoulder, Beuerlein was starting the 1985 season opener at Michigan. Beurlein was benched for the Ole Miss game in favor of sophomore backup Terry Andrysiak after throwing just three touchdowns at that point After good play coming off the bench that game, Beurlein won his starting job back.

Before Beuerlein&#x27;s senior year, Faust resigned after five seasons. The university then hired Minnesota head coach Lou Holtz. Beuerlein enjoyed his best statistical season in 1986 under Holtz, throwing for 2211 yards, 13 TDs and 7 INTs. In his final collegiate game, Beuerlein threw three second-half touchdowns, helping lead the Irish to an upset over the 17th ranked USC Trojans. The win gave Beuerlein a perfect 4-0 record against the Trojans, the only Notre Dame quarterback ever to do so besides Ralph Guglielmi from 1951 to 1954.

Beuerlein started 39 out of 46 games for the Irish during his four-year career, with a 21–18 record. He graduated in 1987 with a degree in American Studies, having broken nearly every passing and total offense record in Notre Dame history.
==Professional career==
===Los Angeles Raiders===
Beuerlein was drafted by the Los Angeles Raiders in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL draft, but suffered a season-ending injury in preseason play.

He made his NFL debut in 1988 under new head coach Mike Shanahan, starting and winning the season opener against the San Diego Chargers 24–13, his first game in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since upsetting USC in college two years prior. The Raiders would lose Beuerlein&#x27;s next two starts in close games, including a loss to the crosstown Los Angeles Rams, where Beuerlein threw for 375 yards, then the third-highest total in Raiders history. Beurlein was eventually benched for the more experienced Jay Schroeder, who had been acquired from the Washington Redskins only one day before the season opener.
Beuerlein came off the bench for Schroeder twice before regaining the starting job, losing it again near the end of the season. The Raiders finished third in the AFC West division, with a record of 7–9.

In 1989, Schroeder was named the starter. After a 1–3 start, Shanahan was fired. Under new coach Art Shell, Beuerlein started the final six games after a three-interception outing by Schroeder in a Week 10 loss to San Diego, winning the Raiders&#x27; starting job. The Raiders finished 8–8 for another third-place finish in the AFC West.

Going into the 1990 season, Beuerlein was to be the lowest-paid starting QB in the league, at a salary of $140,000. This led to a contract dispute and holdout, and although he eventually signed before the start of the season, the holdout angered Raiders owner Al Davis, who refused to allow the Raiders&#x27; coaches to play Beuerlein. Schroeder was handed the starting job with Vince Evans as the backup, and Beuerlein was held inactive for every game. To compound matters for Beuerlein, the Raiders finished 12–4, and advanced all the way to the AFC title game.

===Dallas Cowboys===
Less than a week before the start of the 1991 season, the Raiders traded Beuerlein to the Dallas Cowboys, who desired a back-up for Troy Aikman, in exchange for a fourth round draft choice. According to head coach Jimmy Johnson, the Cowboys had &quot;been actively pursuing Beuerlein for quite some time&quot;, including a trade agreement worked out in January that Davis reportedly backed out of. When Aikman injured his knee in Week 13 against the Washington Redskins, Beuerlein came off the bench and threw a 4th-quarter touchdown pass to Michael Irvin, as the Cowboys held on for a 24–21 victory, defeating the 11–0 Redskins in their home stadium. He then started the remaining four games of the regular season, winning all four and leading the Cowboys to an 11–5 record, their best since the 1983 season under Tom Landry. They also made the playoffs for the first time since the 1985 season, capturing the fifth seed as a wild-card team.

With Aikmain&#x27;s knee healthy enough to start the first playoff game at the Chicago Bears, Johnson decided to continue playing Beuerlein, a move that upset Aikman at the time. Beuerlein threw for 180 yards, with 1 touchdown and no interceptions in leading the Cowboys to a 17–13 win at Soldier Field. It was the Cowboys’ first road playoff win in over a decade. The following week, he started at Detroit, but was relieved by Aikman early in the game as the Cowboys would go on to lose, ending their playoff run as the Cowboys were blown out by the Detroit Lions.

In 1992, a healthy Aikman had a breakout season, and Beuerlein played sparingly but still managed to appear in all 16 regular season games. The Cowboys finished with a 13–3 record and reached Super Bowl XXVII. Beuerlein relieved Aikman with 7:06 left in the game and Dallas up by 35 points. On his last play as a Cowboy, Beuerlein fumbled the ball on a botched handoff to Derrick Gainer. The Cowboys defeated the Buffalo Bills 52–17 and Beuerlein received his first and only Super Bowl championship.

===Phoenix / Arizona Cardinals===
After his play in Dallas, as an unrestricted free agent entering the 1993 season Beuerlein was a highly sought-after quarterback on the free agent market. He would eventually sign a three-year, $7.5 million contract with the Phoenix Cardinals and become their new starting quarterback. After three-straight seasons of five wins or less, head coach Joe Bugel was on the hot seat before the season even began after owner Bill Bidwill gave him an ultimatum demanding that Bugel win at least nine games in order to keep his job. After the Cardinals started the season 2–6, Beuerlein was briefly benched in favor of Chris Chandler, but regained the starting job after two games. Beuerlein led the Cardinals to victories in four of their last five games, including passing for three touchdowns and a career-high 431 yards in a 30–27 overtime win at Seattle. The Cardinals finished with a 7–9 record and Bugel was fired.

Beuerlein passed for the first of his three career 3000-yard seasons in 1993, finishing in the top-10 in almost every statistical passing category, despite throwing passes in only 14 games.

The newly renamed Arizona Cardinals hired Buddy Ryan as both head coach and general manager in 1994. Beuerlein was benched after an 0–2 start. Ryan called him &quot;one of the worst quarterbacks he had ever seen&quot; and stated to the press that Beuerlein was &quot;a cancer that needed to be cut out.&quot; Amid frequent changes at quarterback, Beuerlein went 3–4 as a starter as the team finished 8–8, with Ryan making him a scapegoat for the team&#x27;s mediocrity.

===Jacksonville Jaguars===

At the end of the 1994 season, Ryan and Beuerlein&#x27;s contentious relationship would come to an end when Ryan exposed him to the 1995 NFL expansion draft. The Jacksonville Jaguars took him with the number one selection. Beuerlein was the starting quarterback for the first game in team history, starting the first two games before spraining his right MCL in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. While he was healthy two weeks later, and he initially started in a Week 5 game against the Houston Oilers, he would be replaced mid-game by backup Mark Brunell who would keep the starting job for the next six games. Beuerlein would not see action again until Week 11 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, coming off the bench for an injured Brunell in the fourth quarter, leading a team-record 96-yard touchdown drive, and throwing what was potentially the game-tying touchdown. Head coach Tom Coughlin decided to go for a two-point conversion and the win, which failed and the Jaguars lost 17–16. Beuerlein started three of the next four games in relief of Brunell – all losses – as the Jaguars finished their inaugural season with a 4–12 record. Beuerlein reportedly had a confrontational relationship with head coach Coughlin, and finished the season as the third quarterback behind rookie Rob Johnson. As he was in the last year of his original three-year deal with the Cardinals, after the season he became a free agent.

===Carolina Panthers===
====1996 season====
Before the 1996 season, the Carolina Panthers signed Beuerlein to a three-year contract, as a backup to second-year QB Kerry Collins.

He made four starts in relief of an injured Collins, going 3–1, finishing the year with eight touchdowns and only two interceptions, and a passer rating of 93.5.

====1997 season====
After an injury to Kerry Collins in the beginning of the 1997 season, Beuerlein started the first two regular season games going 1–1. Beurelein started another game and occasionally played in relief of Collins. Beuerlein also served as a mentor to Collins, relating his stories of watching other young quarterbacks struggle in their early years before becoming stars.

Beuerlein started three games and played in seven, as the Panthers finished with a 7–9 record.

====1998 season====

In 1998, Beuerlein gained the starting job permanently in Week 5 after Collins&#x27; on-field and off-field problems continued, and he benched himself after an 0–4 start and was ultimately released one week later.

Beuerlein threw 17 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, completing 63% of passes for 2613 yards, however the Panthers finished with a 4–12 record and head coach Dom Capers was fired.

====1999 season====
In 1999, Beuerlein beat newly acquired Jeff Lewis for the starting job.

In Week 14, Carolina visited Green Bay in their first game at Lambeau Field since the 1996 NFC Championship Game. Beuerlein, who had served as Collins&#x27;s backup but did not play in that January 1997 tilt, passed for a then franchise-record 373 yards. Beuerlein won the game against the Packers on a last-second quarterback draw. He later stated that the draw play was the favorite of his career and that &quot;people still ask me about that play almost every single day.&quot;

In the final week against the Saints, Beuerlein threw a team record five touchdown passes in a win, but the Panthers failed to make the playoffs due to the NFL&#x27;s tie breaker rules.

Beuerlein&#x27;s 4,436 passing yards led the league, and at the time was the 11th-highest passing yardage total ever. He also led the NFL with 343 completions, and his 94.6 passer rating and 36 touchdown passes were second only to the 1999 MVP Kurt Warner.

Beuerlein made the Pro Bowl for the first and only time in his career, tying offensive guard Bob Young for the most seasons in the league (13) before making his first Pro Bowl.

====2000 season====
Beuerlein entered the 2000 season as the starter with little competition. He threw for 3,730 yards, but was sacked league-leading 62 times, which was then tied for the second-most sacks ever on a quarterback in a season. Beuerlein also threw a career-high 18 interceptions. The Panthers finished with their third 7–9 record in six seasons.

====2001 season====
Beuerlein was released two months into the offseason by head coach George Seifert. Seifert named Jeff Lewis to take over as the starter, but a bad preseason by Lewis led to rookie Chris Weinke to be designated as starter when Lewis was cut Aug 31. The Panthers won their season opener against the Minnesota Vikings. The 2001 Panthers then went on to lose all 15 of their remaining games, finishing 1–15, and Seifert was fired after the season.

====Panthers franchise records====
During his five seasons in Carolina, Beuerlein set almost every Panthers passing record, including most career attempts (1,723), completions (1,041), passing yards (12,690), passing touchdowns (86), highest completion percentage (60.4%), and highest passer rating (87.7), some of which have since been broken by Jake Delhomme and Cam Newton. Those that remain include:
* Career passer rating (87.7)
* Seasons with 4000+ passing yards (1; with Cam Newton)
* Single-season passing yards (4,436 in 1999)
* Single-season passing touchdowns (36 in 1999)
* Single-season passing attempts (571 in 1999)
* Single-season passing completions (343 in 1999)
* Single-season completion percentage (63.0% in 1999)
* Single-season times sacked (62 in 2000)
* Single-season yards per game (277.3 in 1999)
* Single-season 300+ passing yard games (5 in 1999)
* Most touchdown passes in a game (5, 2000-01-02 NOR; with Cam Newton x3)
* , he holds three of the top eight single-game passing yard totals in Carolina team history (373, 368, and 364).

===Denver Broncos===
Before the 2001 season, Beuerlein signed with the Denver Broncos to back up Brian Griese, reuniting him with Mike Shanahan, his Raiders coach from the 1980s. In 2001, Beuerlein missed his first full season due to injury since his rookie year, but returned in 2002, starting three games and appearing in eight, including a week 11 game against the Seahawks where Beuerlein came off the bench and threw two 4th-quarter touchdowns on his only two pass attempts of the game.

Before the 2003 season, after the Broncos signed former Cardinals QB Jake Plummer to be their new starter, Beuerlein considered retiring at age 38, but decided to play one more year after Shanahan personally visited his home and asked him to stay. He appeared in four games and started two in relief of an injured Plummer, and helped the Broncos to a 5–1 start before his season ended in a Week 7 game at the undefeated Minnesota Vikings. Beuerlein played poorly, throwing three interceptions as the Vikings blitzed him relentlessly, sacking him five times and knocking him down on numerous other occasions. He was knocked out of the game late in the third quarter with a fractured finger on his throwing hand on an incompletion, with Danny Kanell taking over for the rest of the game. Although the injury was expected to keep him out for only a maximum of six weeks, the Broncos needed the roster spot and he was placed on injured reserve, ending his season and ultimately his career.

===Retirement===
Although the Broncos wanted him to return for his 18th NFL season, at age 39, Beuerlein decided to retire from professional football. Only one week after his finger injury, Beuerlein reflected on the many struggles he had to endure in his NFL career to &quot;Sports Illustrated&#x27;s&quot; Peter King. Beuerlein said, &quot;Hey, I&#x27;ve been in the wrong place at the wrong time a lot. But I was a fourth-round pick. To last 15, 16, 17 years in the league, what can I complain about? I&#x27;ve lived the dream a long time. The only thing I&#x27;d change is how it ended.&quot;

In July 2004, Beuerlein signed a one-day contract with the Panthers to retire as a member of the team. Commenting on the decision to retire with the team, Beuerlein stated &quot;This in my mind was the way it was meant to be. I couldn&#x27;t think of a better way to bring this 17-year run to an end. My heart has always been here with this organization and when I sat back and decided I wanted to step down, there was no doubt I wanted to do it as a Carolina Panther.&quot;

==NFL career statistics==


==Football analyst==
In 2004, Beuerlein joined CBS Sports as a game analyst for &quot;The NFL on CBS&quot;, where he travels each week during the season to NFL venues in order to provide color commentary for games. Beuerlein also occasionally calls college football games for CBS. In 2024 Beuerlein became the Compass Media Networks Dallas Cowboys radio analyst, replacing longtime legend Danny White who had held the position since the broadcasts began in 2011.

<text>Angela Bulloch (born 1966 in Rainy River, Ontario, Canada), is a Canadian artist who often works with sound and installation; she is recognised as one of the Young British Artists. Bulloch lives and works in Berlin.

==Life and career==
Bulloch studied at Goldsmiths&#x27; College, London (1985–1988). She was included in the Freeze Exhibition in 1988 and was established as one of the Young British Artists. On reflecting on being a Young British Artist, Bulloch said &quot;When I was 22, it was important for me. It was helpful in terms of managing media responses to my work because whenever I mentioned this little label, everyone was like, “Oh yeah, YBA”. But they were just talking about a media generated label, instead of the actual work. It&#x27;s easier, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s for lazy journalists.&quot; In 1989 she won the Whitechapel Artists&#x27; Award.

Bulloch undertook a two-month residency at ARCUS- project in Moriya, Japan in 1994. She was nominated for the Turner Prize in 1997, part of an all-female shortlist that also included Cornelia Parker, Christine Borland and Gillian Wearing (who won the prize that year). For the Turner Prize exhibition, Bulloch exhibited her playful artwork called &quot;Rules Series&quot;. In 2005, she was nominated for the Preis der Nationalgalerie für junge Kunst.

In 2002 Bulloch was awarded the ASEF (Asia-Europe Foundation) Cultural Grant. Between 2001 and 2003 she undertook a guest professorship of sculpture at the Akademie für Bildende Künste, Vienna.

Within her art, Bullock plays with the boundaries of mathematics and aesthetics. She has a particular interest in instructions and rules, especially in the context of technology. She is an ambiguous multi-disciplinary artist and has worked in multiple media, including video, installation, sculpture, painting. In particular, she has used video, animation, sound and light to explore pre-edited systems. Bulloch is recognised for her &#x27;Pixel Boxes&#x27; originally constructed using beech wood and a plastic front screen and later with materials such as copper, aluminium or corian. The boxes use different lights and colours to create a variety of abstract patterns. Many of her works make use of biofeedback systems, such as in her 1994 work &quot;Betaville&quot;, a &#x27;Drawing Machine&#x27; painting vertical and horizontal stripes on a wall, was triggered whenever someone sat on the bench in front of it. Bulloch has also made a number of works using Belisha beacons, which are more commonly used to illuminate pedestrian crossings. More recently, Bullock&#x27;s &quot;Stacks&quot; are unique structures made of compiled rhomboids which play with light and colour to create optical effects. Bullock&#x27;s art commonly relies on the interpretation of the viewer, with its meaning being determined by their subjectivity. A lot of her light and music works are developed using technology Bulloch has created herself.

Bulloch is a fan of music and performs live. She is also the owner of the record label LBCDLP. Music is often incorporated into her art in a variety of ways such as light instillations that respond to a musical score.

Since 2018 Bulloch is a professor of Time-Based Media at HFBK Hamburg.

==Exhibitions==
Bulloch exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago in 1997. Other museum exhibitions include Kunsthaus Glarus (2001); Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (2003); Le Consortium, Dijon (2005); Modern Art Oxford, Vienna Secession, and The Power Plant, Toronto (2005); and Lenbachhaus, Munich (2008). Her work was also included in notable group exhibitions such as The New Decor at Hayward Gallery, London; Colour Chart: Reinventing Colour 1950 to Today at Tate Liverpool and Museum of Modern Art, New York; and Theanyspacewhatever for which she created an installation for the ceiling of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York.

<doc id="1306219" wikidata="Q12325942" url="?curid=1306219" title="Marcus Stroud">
<text>Marcus LaVar Stroud (born June 25, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive tackle for 10 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Georgia Bulldogs, and was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars with the 13th overall pick in the 2001 NFL draft. He was a member of the NFL&#x27;s Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots.

== Early years ==
Stroud won a state title with Brooks County High School in 1994. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1996 while still in high school which featured a cover story of National Signing Day. Stroud, at the time a 6&#x27;6&quot; 266-pound defensive end, originally gave Florida a verbal commitment but changed his mind after Bulldogs coach Ray Goff was fired in November 1995. After heavy pursuit from new Georgia coach Jim Donnan, Stroud switched and committed to the Bulldogs on Signing Day.

== College career ==
Stroud attended the University of Georgia, where he played for the Georgia Bulldogs football team. He played for Georgia during a major re-building era, in which coach Jim Donnan turned the program around from among the mediocre to averaging 8 wins per year, including four straight bowl game victories.

He was initiated as a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity while he was an undergraduate.

== Professional career ==
=== Jacksonville Jaguars ===
Stroud was selected 13th in the 2001 NFL draft by the Jaguars. The 2001 NFL Draft is considered by many experts to be the finest draft for defensive tackles in draft history, and Stroud was among the highest rated of the group that year. The 2001 class included fellow Pro Bowl selections Richard Seymour, Casey Hampton and Kris Jenkins.

He and John Henderson helped give the Jaguars one of the more dominant defensive tackles duos in the NFL.

During his Jacksonville days, Stroud had 22 sacks and 256 tackles while appearing in 100 games. Stroud also played in every Jaguars game for the first 5 years of his career.

Marcus Stroud was selected to the Pro Bowl following the 2003, 2004 and 2005 NFL seasons.

Stroud was suspended in 2007 for four games without pay for violating the league&#x27;s policy on anabolic steroids and related substances.

=== Buffalo Bills ===
On March 1, 2008, Stroud was traded to the Buffalo Bills for third (previously acquired from the Baltimore Ravens in the Willis McGahee trade)- and fifth-round picks in the 2008 NFL draft.

Stroud was immediately deemed one of the key players to the Bills&#x27; 2008 season. Buffalo ranked 31st in total defense the year prior, and vaulted up to 14th in 2008, Stroud&#x27;s first season there. The Bills got off to a strong start that year, going 5–1 in the first six games. They fell off towards the mid-season mark, however, and finished the year with a 7–9 record.

On April 7, 2009, Stroud signed a two-year contract extension that paid $16 million and guaranteed $12 million. In combination with the existing terms of his contract, Stroud could&#x27;ve earned an additional $28 million over the following four seasons.
Stroud was released on February 16, 2011, by the Bills.

=== New England Patriots ===
On March 1, 2011, the New England Patriots signed defensive lineman Stroud to a two-year contract. He was released just under 5 months later on July 28.

=== Retirement ===
In June 2012, Stroud signed a one-day contract with the Jaguars and announced his retirement. He became the fifth player to re-sign with Jacksonville before retiring, joining Tony Boselli, Fred Taylor, Paul Spicer and Donovin Darius.

===NFL statistics===
== Community ==
During his NFL days, Stroud founded the Marcus Stroud Charitable Foundation to assist underprivileged youth who lived in low-income, single-parent homes, according to its website, by establishing various academic and athletic programs otherwise unavailable to them. Additionally, Stroud hosts an annual football camp aimed to combat childhood obesity.

Stroud hosted the &quot;Marcus Stroud 99 Pro Bowl Football Camp For Kids&quot; in May 2009 at Brooks County&#x27;s Veterans Stadium in Georgia. Several NFL players, including Mike Peterson and Verron Haynes of the Atlanta Falcons, and George Wilson, Donte Whitner, Kavika Mitchell, Marcus Buggs and Drayton Florence of the Buffalo Bills contributed to the free camp.

== Personal ==
Stroud has a passion for classic cars and eventually founded his own auto body business, DeciBels Auto Creations, in Jacksonville.

Stroud escaped injury in 2005, when he rolled his SUV while driving on Florida&#x27;s Interstate 10 outside of Jacksonville.

<doc id="1306225" wikidata="Q4993789" url="?curid=1306225" title="Reggie Williams (wide receiver)">
<text>Reginald Williams Jr. (born May 17, 1983) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver for the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Washington Huskies, earning consensus All-American honors in 2002. He was selected by Jacksonville in the first round of the 2004 NFL draft, and played five seasons for the team.

==Early life==
Williams was born on a U.S. military base in Landstuhl, West Germany. He lived with his family in Virginia until his father&#x27;s military career moved them to Lakewood, Washington, where he attended Lakes High School. Williams led his Lakes Lancer high school football team to the championship game in his senior year and was the Associated Press Washington State Player of the Year.

==College career==
Williams attended the University of Washington, and played for the Washington Huskies football team from 2001 to 2003. He was a first-team All-Pac-10 selection in 2002 and 2003, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American in 2002.

==Professional career==
===Jacksonville Jaguars===
Williams was drafted in the first round with the ninth overall pick in the 2004 NFL draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was the third receiver taken behind Larry Fitzgerald (3rd overall) and Roy Williams (7th overall).

Williams put up disappointing numbers in his rookie season of 2004. He rebounded the first half of 2005, but in the second half, he had a slump brought on by a concussion.

Through the first six weeks of the 2006 season, Williams was among the top receivers in the NFL. An ankle injury caused Byron Leftwich to miss the remainder of the season. After David Garrard became the starting quarterback, Williams&#x27; production slipped.

Williams had his best game as a pro against the New Orleans Saints in Week 9 of the 2007 season, making six catches for 128 yards and one touchdown. His best professional season to date was in 2007, where he had 38 catches for 629 yards (an average of 16.6 yards per catch) and 10 touchdowns (more than twice his career total prior to 2007). In a game against the Oakland Raiders in Week 16, he broke the Jaguars&#x27; single season receiving touchdown record, with ten scores, record previously held by the retired Jimmy Smith.

===Seattle Seahawks===
After spending the 2009 season out of football, Williams signed with the Seattle Seahawks on April 16, 2010. He was released from the Seattle Seahawks on June 18, 2010.

===Sacramento Mountain Lions===
On July 7, 2011, he signed with the Sacramento Mountain Lions. On September 18, 2011, he made his season debut against the Las Vegas Locomotives. He had his first receiving touchdown in the 3rd quarter in that game. On October 4, 2011, he was released by the team.

===Toronto Argonauts===
On May 29, 2013, Williams was signed by the Toronto Argonauts of the CFL. Williams played in both the 2013 CFL season preseason games for the Argos. In those games he caught 4 passes for 42 yards and a touchdown. On June 22, 2013, Williams was released by the Toronto Argonauts.

Rushing statistics
==Personal life==
Williams was arrested in January 2006 and charged with possession of marijuana; he was permitted to enter a pretrial intervention program, which he successfully completed. He was arrested again and charged with DWI and possession of marijuana on February 27, 2009, in Houston, Texas; both charges were later dismissed. On April 5, 2009, police officials reported Williams was arrested on felony drug charges after scuffling with Houston police officers at a local night club. Police tasered Williams and took him into custody at which time police found what appeared to be a bag of cocaine in his back pocket.

<text>The Flinders Ranges are the largest mountain ranges in South Australia, which starts about north of Adelaide. The ranges stretch for over from Port Pirie to Lake Callabonna.

The Adnyamathanha people are the Aboriginal group who have inhabited the range for tens of thousands of years.

Its most well-known landmark is Wilpena Pound / Ikara, a formation that creates a natural amphitheatre covering and containing the range&#x27;s highest peak, St Mary Peak (). The ranges include several national parks, the largest being the Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park, as well as other protected areas.

It is an area of great geological and palaeontological significance, and includes the oldest fossil evidence of animal life was discovered. The Ediacaran Period and Ediacaran biota take their name from the Ediacara Hills within the ranges. In August 2022, a nomination for the Flinders Ranges to be named a World Heritage Site was lodged.

== History ==

===Traditional owners===
The first humans to inhabit the Flinders Ranges were the Adnyamathanha people (meaning &quot;hill people&quot; or &quot;rock people&quot;) whose descendants still reside in the area, and the Ngadjuri (Ndajurri) people, They inhabited the range for tens of thousands of years before being dispersed by European settlement after colonisation. Cave paintings, rock engravings and other cultural artefacts indicate that the Adnyamathana and Ndajurri lived in the Flinders Ranges for tens of thousands of years. Occupation of the Warratyi rock shelter dates back approximately 49,000 years.

===19th century: European explorers and settlement===
The first European explorers were an exploration party from Matthew Flinders&#x27; seagoing visit to upper Spencer Gulf aboard HMS &quot;Investigator&quot;. They climbed Mount Brown in March 1802. In the winter of 1839 Edward John Eyre, with five men, two drays and ten horses, further explored the region, setting out from Adelaide on 1 May. The party set up a depot near Mount Arden, and then explored the surrounding region and upper Spencer Gulf, before heading east to the Murray River and returning to Adelaide.
There are records of squatters in the Quorn district as early as 1845; however, the first three pastoral leases in the central Flinders Ranges were only marked out in 1851. These were Wilpena, Arkaba, and Aroona, which were developed as sheep stations. The leases were initially granted for 14 years by the government of the Colony of South Australia, over land dubbed &quot;unoccupied waste lands&quot;.

====Aroona and the Brachina Gorge massacre (1852)====
The name &quot;Aroona&quot; is derived from an Adnyamathanha word meaning &quot;running water&quot;, or &quot;place of frogs&quot;. Aroona Valley is a long open valley that lies around north of Wilpena Pound, between the Heysen Range and ABC Ranges. The lease was taken up first by the Brownes, and then by Johnson Frederick Hayward in the 1850s. Hayward had arrived in 1847 from Somerset, and was initially overseer of Pekina Station. Hayward Bluff, False Mount Hayward, South Mount Hayward, and Mount Hayward, in the Heysen Range, are all named after him. The Aroona head station was built next to a waterhole used by local Adnyamathanha people for its permanent supply of fresh water, but the Aboriginal people were not welcome on the station during Hayward&#x27;s time there. He was implicated in a massacre of Aboriginal people near Brachina Gorge. At least 15 men, women, and children were killed in a dawn attack on 17 March 1852, in retaliation for the murder of stockman Robert Richardson on 14 March. Hayward said that he was obliged to defend his men, due to the absence of police, and that he was attempting to &quot;capture the murderers&quot;, firing at them in &quot;self-defence&quot;. Sergeant Major Rose, who was in the district at the time with the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse, arrested two Aboriginal men called Bill and Jemmy, but they were released after being held for some time owing to lack of evidence and problems finding an interpreter. In the early 1860s Hayward returned to England, and purchased an estate near Bath, which he called Aroona.

====Later settlement====
In 1852 Kanyaka Station was established by Hugh Proby.

William Pinkerton is credited as being the first European to find a route through the Flinders Ranges via Pichi Richi Pass. In 1853 he drove 7,000 sheep along the eastern plains of the range, to where Quorn would be built 25 years later (Pinkerton Creek runs through the Quorn township).

During the late 1870s the push to open agricultural land for wheat north of the Goyder&#x27;s Line had met with unusual success, with good rainfall and crops in the Flinders Ranges. This, along with the copper mining lobby (copper was mined in the Hawker-Flinders Ranges area in the late 1850s and transported overland by bullock dray), induced the government to build a narrow gauge railway line north of Port Augusta through Pichi Richi Pass, Quorn, Hawker and along the west of the ranges to Marree, to service the agricultural and pastoral industries.

However, rainfall returned to a normal pattern for the region, causing many agricultural farms to collapse. Remnants of abandoned homes can still be seen dotted around the arid landscape. Wilpena station, due to its unusual geography, along with areas around Quorn and Carrieton, are now the only places north of Goyder&#x27;s Line to sustain any crops. Wilpena has now been left to the wild and is only a tourist location. As of 2009, kukri, unpopular with most Australian farmers as it yields 10–15% less grain than other varieties of wheat, is being grown for export to India.

Mining exploration continued in the region, but coal mining at Leigh Creek and barytes at Oraparinna were the only long-term successes. Pastoral industries flourished, and the rail line became of major importance in opening up and servicing sheep and cattle stations along the route to Alice Springs.

Hawker townsite was surveyed at a bend in the railway line where the train line left the main road to Blinman, and named in 1880 after South Australian politician and pastoralist George Charles Hawker.

Quorn was surveyed by Godfrey Walsh and proclaimed a town on 16 May 1878. The township covered an area of and was laid out in squares in a manner similar to the state&#x27;s capital city, Adelaide. Governor Jervois reputedly bestowed the name &#x27;Quorn&#x27; because his private secretary at the time had come from the parish of Quorn, Leicestershire in England.

===20th century===
In the 1920s Aroona became an outstation of Oraparinna Station, and spring water was used to irrigate large gardens there.

==Features and attractions==
The Flinders Ranges are the largest mountain range in South Australia. It starts about north of Adelaide city centre. The discontinuous ranges stretch for over from Port Pirie to Lake Callabonna.

Its most characteristic landmark is Wilpena Pound / Ikara, a large, sickle-shaped, natural amphitheatre that covers , and contains the range&#x27;s highest peak, St Mary Peak (,) which adjoins the Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park.

The southern ranges are notable for the Pichi Richi heritage steam and diesel railway and Mount Remarkable National Park.

The Heysen Trail and Mawson Trail run for several hundred kilometres along the ranges, providing scenic long distance routes for walkers, cyclists and horse-riders.

===Protected areas===
Several small areas in the ranges have the protected area status. These include the Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park near Wilpena Pound/Ikara, the Mount Remarkable National Park in the south near Melrose, the Arkaroola Protection Area in the north, The Dutchmans Stern Conservation Park west of Quorn, and the Mount Brown Conservation Park south of Quorn.

== Geology ==

The Flinders Ranges are composed largely of folded and faulted sediments of the Adelaide Geosyncline. This very thick sequence was deposited in a large basin during the Neoproterozoic on the passive margin of the ancient continent of Rodinia. During the Cambrian (about 540 million years ago) the area underwent the Delamerian orogeny, when this sequence of rocks was folded and faulted into a large mountain range. The area has undergone subsequent erosion resulting in the relatively low ranges today.

Most of the high ground and ridgetops are sequences of quartzites that outcrop along strike. The high walls of Wilpena Pound are formed by the outcropping beds of the eponymous Pound Quartzite in a synclinal structure. Synclines form other high parts of the Flinders, including the plateau of the Gammon Ranges and the Heysen Range. Cuesta forms are also very common.

The Ranges are renowned for the Ediacara Hills, south-west of Leigh Creek, where in 1946 some of the oldest fossil evidence of animal life was discovered. Similar fossils have subsequently been found in the ranges, including at Nilpena, with an application being made for World Heritage listing to help protect the sites. In 2004 a new geological period, the Ediacaran Period, was created to mark the appearance of Ediacaran biota.
== Climate ==

The region has a semi-arid climate with hot dry summers and cool winters. Summer temperatures usually exceed , while winters have highs around , depending on the elevation. Although rainfall is erratic, most of the precipitation falls in winter. There are also some monsoonal showers and storms that move in from the north during the summer. The area gets around of rain annually, with the highest at Wilpena Pound, at . Frost is common on winter mornings and temperatures have dropped as low as . Snow has even been recorded in the Wilpena Pound and at Blinman. As of 2013, the last significant snowfall was in 1995.

== Flora and fauna ==

The flora of the Ranges are largely species adapted to a semi-arid environment, including sugar gum, cypress-pine, mallee and black oak. Moister areas near Wilpena Pound support grevilleas, Guinea flowers, Liliaceae and ferns. Reeds and sedges grow near permanent water sources such as springs and waterholes.

Since the eradication of dingos and the establishment of permanent waterholes for stock, the number of red kangaroos, western grey kangaroos and wallaroos in the Flinders Ranges has increased. The yellow-footed rock-wallaby, which neared extinction after the arrival of Europeans due to hunting and predation by foxes, has now stabilised. Other endemic marsupials include dunnarts and planigales. Insectivorous bats make up a significant proportion of the mammals. There are a large number of bird species including parrots, galahs, emus, the wedge-tailed eagle and small numbers of water birds. Reptiles include goannas, snakes, dragon lizards, skinks and geckos. The streambank froglet is an endemic amphibian.

The Ranges are part of the Tirari–Sturt stony desert ecoregion.

==World Heritage bid==
A team acting on behalf of the Government of South Australia and the traditional owners, the Adnyamathanha people, which includes internationally renowned American palaeontologist Mary L. Droser, lodged a nomination for a tentative listing as a World Heritage Site, which was accepted by UNESCO in April 2021. The application was made on the basis of its unique geological and palaeontological values. It is a lengthy process, and the site needs to fulfil very specific criteria as well as showing strong evidence that its values are absolutely unique in the world. 

The involvement of the Adnyamathanha people, particularly their caring for country and sharing knowledge of their cultural heritage, is an important part of the future management of a World Heritage site. In November 2022, the state government announced an allocation of over four years towards enabling the Adnyamathanha people to identify priorities for cultural heritage protection. One example is the rock engravings that are understood to be the oldest artwork in the world, some dating back 40,000 years. Elder Vince Coulthard has been involved in the application process, and says that the creation stories also need to be included.

Seven properties in the Flinders have been identified as possessing the technical and scientific evidence necessary to support the bid:
*Ikara-Flinders Ranges National Park
*Vulkathunha-Gammon Ranges National Park
*Nilpena Ediacara National Park
*Angorichina (pastoral lease)
*Maynards Well (pastoral lease)
*Puttapa (pastoral lease)
*Arkaroola Protection Area

<doc id="1306229" wikidata="Q65350" url="?curid=1306229" title="Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker">
<text>Carl Friedrich Freiherr von Weizsäcker (; 28 June 1912 – 28 April 2007) was a German physicist and philosopher. He was the longest-living member of the team which performed nuclear research in Nazi Germany during the Second World War, under Werner Heisenberg&#x27;s leadership. There is ongoing debate as to whether or not he and the other members of the team actively and willingly pursued the development of a nuclear bomb for Germany during this time.

A member of the prominent Weizsäcker family, he was son of the diplomat Ernst von Weizsäcker, elder brother of the former German President Richard von Weizsäcker, father of the physicist and environmental researcher Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker and father-in-law of the former General Secretary of the World Council of Churches Konrad Raiser.

Weizsäcker made important theoretical discoveries regarding energy production in stars from nuclear fusion processes. He also did influential theoretical work on planetary formation in the early Solar System.

In his late career, he focused more on philosophical, ethical and historical issues, and was awarded several international honours for his work in those areas.

==Early life and education==
Born in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, he was the grandson of Karl Hugo von Weizsäcker, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Württemberg. His grandfather was ennobled in 1897 and raised to the hereditary nobility with the title of Baron (Freiherr) in 1916. As such, the four-year-old Carl Friedrich Weizsäcker became Baron Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. Since 1919, noble titles have legally been considered parts of the family name.

Weizsäcker was raised in Stuttgart, Basel and Copenhagen. Between 1929 and 1933 Weizsäcker studied physics, mathematics and astronomy in Berlin, Göttingen and Leipzig, supervised by and working with Heisenberg and Niels Bohr, among others. The supervisor of his doctoral thesis was Friedrich Hund.

==Work on nuclear fusion in the Sun==
Weizsäcker&#x27;s special interests as a young researcher were the nuclear processes in stars and the binding energy of atomic nuclei. Together with Hans Bethe he found a mechanism or pathway for the cyclic process of fusion in stars (Bethe–Weizsäcker process, published 1937–1939). This discovery should not be confused with his earlier (1935) development of the Bethe–Weizsäcker formula, or Semi-Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF), which was a theoretical formula relating the curve of nuclear binding energy, nuclear masses, and certain other nuclear properties.

==Work on planetary formation==
In 1938, Weizsäcker developed a theory on the formation of the Solar System, based on considerations regarding the unequal share of lighter and heavier elements in the Sun and the Solar System&#x27;s terrestrial planets. His views were later generally acknowledged and refined by a large number of other physicists and astronomers. According to the theory, the Sun and its planets evolved from a gas cloud made up of 99% hydrogen and helium, and 1% of heavier elements. Some 10% of the cloud remained around the Sun as an extensive atmosphere during an initial phase, and the 1% of heavier elements within this 10% of the total mass of the cloud would tally with the fraction of roughly 1% that the planets contribute to the mass of the Solar System today.

The theory also helped to explain the empirically observed regular pattern of increase in the diameters of the orbits of the planets of the Solar System, from inward to outward. This result was a natural outcome of the increasing size of &quot;planetary eddies&quot; of gas and dust farther from the centre of the early solar system.

A further implication of his theory was that many stars out in the universe, with characteristics similar to the Sun, would have to be expected to possess planetary systems similar to our own.

Shortly after the end of the Second World War in Europe, the Russian émigré American physicist George Gamow co-authored an influential paper supporting Weizsäcker&#x27;s work on planetary formation in the early solar system.

==Work on atomic weapons==
After nuclear fission became known in early 1939 through the work of Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner, Weizsäcker (and by his own estimate, 200 other physicists) quickly recognised that nuclear weapons could potentially be built. He discussed the upsetting implications in February 1939 with philosopher friend Georg Max Friedrich Valentin Picht (1913–1982).

During the Second World War, Weizsäcker joined the German nuclear weapons program, participating in efforts to construct an atomic bomb, while based at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. As early as August 1939, Albert Einstein warned U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt about this research and highlighted that &quot;the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.&quot;

As a protégé of Werner Heisenberg, Weizsäcker was present at a crucial meeting at the Army Ordnance headquarters in Berlin on 17 September 1939, at which the German atomic weapons program was launched. Early in the war — possibly until 1942 — he hoped a successful nuclear weapons project would earn him political influence. In July 1940 he was co-author of a report to the army on the possibility of &quot;energy production&quot; from refined uranium. The report also predicted the possibility of using plutonium for the same purpose including the production of a new type of explosives. During summer 1942 Weizsäcker filed a patent on a transportable &quot;process to generate energy and neutrons by an explosion... e.g. a bomb&quot;. The patent application was found in the 1990s in Moscow.

Historians have been divided as to whether Heisenberg and his team were sincerely trying to construct a nuclear weapon, or whether their failure reflected a desire not to succeed because they did not want the Nazi regime to have such a weapon. This latter view, largely based on postwar interviews with Heisenberg and Weizsäcker, was put forward by Robert Jungk in his 1957 book &quot;Brighter Than a Thousand Suns&quot;. In a 1957 interview with the German weekly &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, Weizsäcker frankly admitted to the scientific ambitions of those years &quot;We wanted to know if chain reactions were possible. No matter what we would end up doing with our knowledge – we wanted to know.&quot; Only by &quot;divine grace&quot;, Weizsäcker said, were they spared the temptation to build the bomb as the German war economy was unable to mobilize the necessary resources.

Original sources about this question were not revealed until 1993, when transcripts of secretly recorded conversations among ten top German physicists, including Heisenberg and Weizsäcker, detained under Operation Epsilon at Farm Hall, near Cambridge in late 1945, were published. In the conversation after the group of detainees had listened to the BBC Radio news on dropping of the atomic bomb on 6 August 1945, Weizsäcker said: &quot;I believe the reason we didn&#x27;t do it was because all the physicists didn&#x27;t want to do it, on principle. If we had wanted Germany to win the war we would have succeeded!&quot;

But the &quot;Farm Hall Transcripts&quot; also revealed that Weizsäcker had taken the lead in arguing for an agreement among the scientists that they would claim that they had never wanted to develop a German nuclear weapon. It was this version of events which was given to Jungk as the basis of his book. This story was untrue at least to the extent that the detainees also included scientists actively engaged in eager attempts to build a nuclear bomb, namely Kurt Diebner and Walther Gerlach. Max von Laue later called this agreement &quot;&quot;die Lesart&quot; (the Version). Although the memorandum which the scientists drew up was drafted by Heisenberg, von Laue wrote: &quot;The leader in all these discussions was Weizsäcker. I did not hear any mention of any ethical point of view.&quot;&quot;

Weizsäcker himself stated that Heisenberg, Karl Wirtz and he had a private agreement to study nuclear fission to the fullest possible extent in order to &quot;decide&quot; themselves how to proceed with its technical application. &quot;&quot;There was no conspiracy, not even in our small three-man-circle, with certainty not to make the bomb. Just as little, there was no passion to make the bomb...&quot; In a recent report based on additional documents from Russian archives, historian Mark Walker concludes that &quot;in comparison with Diebner [and] Gerlach ... Heisenberg and finally Weizsäcker did obviously not use all power they commanded to provide the National Socialists with nuclear weapons&quot;&quot;.

Ivan Supek (one of Heisenberg&#x27;s students and friends) claimed that Weizsäcker was the main figure behind the famous and controversial Heisenberg–Bohr meeting in Copenhagen in September 1941. Allegedly, he tried to persuade Bohr to mediate for peace between Germany and Great Britain. According to Weizsäcker&#x27;s own account, he had persuaded Heisenberg to meet Bohr in order to broker an accord of the international nuclear physicist &quot;community&quot; not to build the bomb. However, according to Bohr&#x27;s (posthumously published) account of the events, Heisenberg enthusiastically promoted the prospect of German victory and wanted Bohr and his colleagues to assist in the German atomic program. 

Later during the war Weizsäcker worked as a professor at the Reichsuniversität Straßburg. The American capture of his laboratory and papers there in December 1944 revealed to the Western Allies that the Germans had not come close to developing a nuclear weapon.

==Post-war career==

Weizsäcker was allowed to return to the part of Germany administered by the Western Allies in 1946, and became director of a department for theoretical physics in the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Göttingen. From 1957 to 1969, Weizsäcker was professor of philosophy at the University of Hamburg. In 1957 he won the Max Planck medal. In 1970 he formulated a &quot;Weltinnenpolitik&quot; (world internal policy). From 1970 to 1980, he was head of the Max Planck Institute for the Research of Living Conditions in the Modern World in Starnberg. He researched and published on the danger of nuclear war, what he saw as the conflict between the First World and the Third World, and the consequences of environmental degradation.

He was one of the eight signatories of the Memorandum of Tübingen which called for the recognition of the Oder–Neiße line as the official border between Germany and Poland and spoke against a possible nuclear armament of West Germany.

In the 1970s he founded, together with the Indian philosopher Pandit Gopi Krishna, a research foundation &quot;for western sciences and eastern wisdom&quot;. After his retirement in 1980 he became a Christian pacifist, and intensified his work on the conceptual definition of quantum physics, particularly on the Copenhagen interpretation.

His experiences in the Nazi era, and with his own behavior in that time, gave Weizsäcker an interest in questions of ethics and responsibility. In 1957, he was one of the Göttinger 18, a group of prominent German physicists who protested against the idea that the Bundeswehr (West German armed forces) should be equipped with tactical nuclear weapons. He further suggested that West Germany should declare its definitive abdication of all kinds of nuclear weapons.

In 2007, Weizsäcker died at the age of 94 in Söcking near Starnberg. Opinions are split on the question of whether he accepted his share of responsibility for the German scientific community&#x27;s efforts to build a nuclear weapon for Nazi Germany.

==Theory of ur-alternatives==
Weizsäcker developed the theory of ur-alternatives (archetypal objects), publicized in his book &quot;Einheit der Natur&quot; (published in English as &quot;The Unity of Nature&quot;) and further developed through the 1990s. The theory axiomatically constructs quantum physics from the distinction between empirically observable, binary alternatives. Weizsäcker used his theory to derive the 3-dimensionality of space and to estimate the entropy of a proton falling into a black hole.

Desiring on ethical grounds to prevent the introduction of nuclear weapons into the world, the key German nuclear physicists &quot;&#x27;agreed... not to deny [the feasibility of] an atomic bomb, but... to [argue] that it could not be implemented within a realistic time frame...&#x27;&quot; (p. 67.)

Henderson finished the 2008 season with 44 tackles (34 solo), 2 sacks, and 2 pass deflections in 14 games. In the 2009 off-season, Jaguars head coach Jack Del Rio was critical of Henderson for pulling out of OTAs, claiming he was faking a shoulder injury to avoid having to participate. Although many believed Henderson would be released, he met privately with Del Rio and claimed that he had &quot;bought in&quot;. Henderson finished the 2009 season with 36 tackles (26 solo), 3 sacks, 3 pass deflections, and 2 forced fumbles.

<text>Matthew &quot;Mat&quot; Collishaw Hon. FRPS (born 6 January 1966) is a contemporary British artist based in London.

== Work ==
Collishaw&#x27;s work uses photography and video. With an early foundation at Goldsmiths College, Collishaw formed part of the legendary movement of Young British Artists (YBA&#x27;s). He was one of 16 young artists who participated in the seminal &quot;Freeze&quot; exhibition organized by Damien Hirst in 1988, that launched the YBA, as well as the provocative &quot;Sensation&quot; show of 1997. His best known work is &quot;Bullet Hole&quot; (1988), which is a closeup photo of what appears to be a bullet hole wound in the scalp of a person&#x27;s head, mounted on 15 light boxes. Collishaw took the original image from a pathology textbook that actually showed a wound caused by an ice pick. &quot;Bullet Hole&quot; was first exhibited in &quot;Freeze&quot; and is now in the collection of the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Australia.

Throughout his 30-year career, Collishaw has contemplated the nature of the human subconscious and explored ways to influence it through various media. Through optical illusions, paintings, projections and moving sculptures, the artist creates works and scenarios that directly and unconsciously engage their viewers. The works encourage us to think about fundamental questions of psychology, history, sociology and science. Behind the richness and visual appeal of each work there is a deep exploration of how we perceive and are influenced by the world today through images, and modern technology.

Artist often refers to the work of old masters. Most of his art pieces contain references to historical themes and classical techniques of portraying nature, characteristic of the culture of a given era. Borrowed images are digitally processed and appear in a new interpretation of the relationship between representation and reality.&quot;To find out what it is that we are creating when we&#x27;re making this simulacrum of the world, and how much that is divorcing us from the world or how much it&#x27;s making us understand the world. It&#x27;s kind of what we are as human beings that interests me. And for that I can back on so many different fields of interest, from that kind of evolutionary biology which I&#x27;m very interested in, to the history of art, and also evolving technologies.&quot; – Mat Collishaw In 2021 a zoetrope-inspired large-scale animated work ‘Equinox’ by Mat Collishaw, commissioned by Expo 2020 Dubai as a permanent piece, had been unveiled at the Sustainability Pavilion.

==Critical response==
Jonathan Jones wrote in an interview with the artist in The Guardian of Collishaw&#x27;s 2013 exhibition at Arter, Istanbul; ‘A show that foregrounds his political conscience in powerful works such as &quot;Last Meal On Death Row&quot;. For me, Collishaw is a good political artist for the same reason he is a good religious artist and a good artist-artist. It is because he believes in the efficacy of images. Not for him the abstract evasion, the minimalist half smile... he wants to punch your imagination in the stomach. He justifies the art of sensation by showing how it can have depth in its oomph.’

Collishaw&#x27;s artwork, &quot;All Things Fall&quot;, received widespread acclaim, notably by The Sunday Times writer and art critic Waldemar Januszczak, who wrote; ‘You walk in, and before you is a model of a classical temple, circular, domed, becolumned, around which hundreds of nude figures have been arranged in cryptic poses. What they are doing is unclear. But it seems to be something nasty. Suddenly the lights dip and the temple begins to spin. Faster and faster it goes, until the figures crowded around it jump into action, like drawings in a flipbook, and you have before you a remarkable re-creation of the Massacre of the Innocents, the biblical murder of every newborn boy ordered, at Christmas, by Herod. The sudden burst of unexpected violence is brilliantly paced, brilliantly achieved, in an artwork that is nothing less than a contemporary masterpiece.’

The exhibition &quot;The Centrifugal Soul&quot;, at Blain|Southern Gallery, London in 2017 received notable praise, in particular critic Gaby Wood wrote of the work, &quot;Albion&quot; for The Telegraph; ‘...the fact that he can convert such abstract ideas into works that are elegant and entertaining makes him, uniquely among artists and thinkers so far this century, a cross between an aesthetic philosopher and a magician.’

Collishaw&#x27;s first venture into VR, with his exhibition &quot;Thresholds&quot; in 2017, was reviewed by Laurie Taylor for &quot;frieze&quot; Magazine: &quot;Collishaw has not recreated an historical experience, but has instead constructed an entirely new one. The end product is ultimately Collishaw’s vision and it teems with the reverence he has not only for the wonder of photography, but also for the power of its illusions.&quot;

==Influences==
British pathologist, Austin Gresham, wrote a handbook, &quot;A Colour Atlas of Forensic Pathology&quot;, in 1975. Collishaw said it became &quot;the Britart bible&quot;, as a source for explicit images of dead bodies for artwork.

==Personal life==
Collishaw was born in Nottingham. He was raised in a Dawn Christadelphian family. In 2015, he was named one of GQ&#x27;s 50 best dressed British men. Collishaw is married to Polly Morgan with whom he has two sons.

<text>The second USS &quot;General Greene&quot; was a frigate in the United States Navy during the Quasi-War with France.

Named after American Revolution General Nathaneal Greene, she was built under government contract by Benjamin Talman and James De Wolf at Warren, Rhode Island. Launched on 21 January 1799, the frigate was placed under command of Captain Christopher R. Perry. Perry&#x27;s son, a young midshipman named Oliver Hazard Perry, was assigned to his father&#x27;s ship.

&quot;General Greene&quot; sailed on 2 June 1799, joining the in convoying five merchantmen to Havana. Damage suffered in a heavy gale caused her to put in at Havana for repairs, and her crew was struck with yellow fever. More than 20 died and the frigate returned to Newport, Rhode Island, on 27 July with 37 men in various stages of recovery. After a thorough cleaning, fumigation, and change of ballast, she departed Newport on 23 September 1799 to take station at Cap Francois, San Domingo.

&quot;General Greene&quot; remained off San Domingo for the following six months. In company with USS , on 1 December 1799 she assisted in the recaptured Danish brig &quot;Flying Fish&quot;, captured by André Rigaud&#x27;s barges, but with questionable crewing and other oddities (possibly French owned) and retook the American schooner &quot;Weymouth&quot;, which had been captured by French privateer &quot;Hope&quot;. Much of her time was spent watching over the rebellion against General Toussaint in Haiti. She blockaded the port of Jacmel to cut off supplies of the rebels, and gave direct gunfire support to General Toussaint&#x27;s army in the capture of Jacmel on 27 February 1800. On 2 March, 1800 she detained Danish schooner &quot;William and Mary&quot; and allowed her capture by one of General Toussaint&#x27;s barges later in the day. On 11 March she captured an unknown French privateer schooner off Jackmel. Some time before 4 April she captured 2 prizes. One of the prizes was schooner &quot;General Toussaint&quot;, which Captain Silas Talbot ordered released. She remained at Jacmel as a possible haven for American citizens until 27 April, when she sailed with two representatives sent by General Toussaint for an audience with the President of the United States, John Adams. Stopping at New Orleans, she embarked General James Wilkinson and his family for transport home. &quot;General Greene&quot; then proceeded as escort for 12 merchantmen bound to Havana, arriving there 22 June. She departed Havana 26 June escorting a convoy of 12 merchantmen. She finally returned to Newport, arriving on 21 July 1800.

&quot;General Greene&#x27;s&quot; crew was discharged and the frigate remained idle at Newport, until Captain Perry was retired under the Peace Establishment Act of 3 April 1801. Capt. Richard Derby was ordered to take command in a letter written 2 September, 1800, repealed 8 September. A Court of Enquiry was held on various lapses in obeying Orders and other conduct during the last deployment. Following the enquiry President John Adams ordered Secretary of the Navy Benjamin Stoddart to suspend Perry from the Service for 3 months without pay. Capt. Hugh G. Campbell was ordered to assume command in a letter dated 28 November. after which she was laid up in ordinary at the Washington Navy Yard. In a letter dated 21 July, 1802 Lt. Isaac Chauncey was ordered to take command for an anticipated deployment to the Mediterranean during the First Barbary War. In a letter dated 13 August the order was rescinded and her crew transferred to USS New York. In a letter dated 19 November, 1802 Midshipman George S. Hackley was ordered to take command of her as Sailing Master. She was ordered to serve as a quarantine/hospital ship for frigate in a letter dated 16 March, 1803. On 14 November, 1803 orders were issued to put her in complete repair. She was reduced to a sheer hulk in 1805.

The &quot;General Greene&quot; was scuttled by burning on 24 August 1814 when British troops captured Washington, D.C. during the War of 1812.

<text>Qarachi () was the highest level of noble within Turkic khanates of the 14th through 16th centuries, such as Siberia Khanate and Kazan Khanate. The name could be applied to the member of the four extended families: Shirin (Şirin), Barghen (Barğın), Arghen (Arğın), Qepchaq (Qıpçaq). These four were the leading non-royal clans of the Crimean Khanate.
