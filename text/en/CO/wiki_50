<text>William Henry Poole (1820 – August 7, 1896) was an Irish-born Methodist minister and proponent of British Israelism known for his 1889 book &quot;Anglo-Israel: or the Saxon Race Proved to be the Lost Tribes of Israel&quot;.

==Biography==
Poole was born in Ireland and moved to Canada. His book was originally presented as the first in a series of nine lectures and later published in Toronto, Ontario, Canada beginning in 1879 under the title &quot;Anglo-Israel; or, The British Nation the Lost Tribes of Israel&quot;. It was republished in New York City during 1880 with the new title replacing &quot;British nation&quot; with &quot;Saxon Race&quot;.

The book drew on earlier arguments published by Edward Hine, adding new arguments on linguistic grounds that the original Anglo-Saxons were among the lost tribes of Israel. The work was widely circulated.

In reaction to his speculations, which also suggested that the Irish Catholics were the remnants of the Canaanites, Dr Poole was expelled from the Methodist Church in Canada. He relocated to Detroit, Michigan where he became a Methodist Episcopalian.

He died from apoplexy on August 7, 1896. He was buried in Albury Cemetery in Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada.

<doc id="1286054" wikidata="Q5472900" url="?curid=1286054" title="Fortunes of War (novel series)">
<text>Fortunes of War is the name given to a series of six novels by Olivia Manning that describe the experiences of a young married couple early in World War II. The series is made up of two trilogies: the books &quot;The Great Fortune&quot; (1960), &quot;The Spoilt City&quot; (1962), and &quot;Friends and Heroes&quot; (1965) comprise The Balkan Trilogy, while &quot;The Danger Tree&quot; (1977), &quot;The Battle Lost and Won&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Sum of Things&quot; (1980) comprise The Levant Trilogy. The novels were based on Manning&#x27;s personal experiences during the second world war.

==Plot summary==
The novels describe the experiences of a young married couple, Harriet and Guy Pringle, early in World War II. A lecturer and passionate Communist, Guy is attached to a British Council educational establishment in Bucharest (Romania) when war breaks out, and the couple are forced to leave the country, passing through Athens and ending up in Cairo, Egypt. Harriet is persuaded to return home by ship, but changes her mind at the last minute and goes to Damascus with friends. Guy, hearing that the ship has been torpedoed, for a time believes her to be dead, but they are eventually reunited.

The cycle also chronicles the pre-war and wartime experiences of the surrounding group of English expatriates who also find themselves on the move and the changes in Romanian society as the corrupt regime of King Carol II fails to keep Romania out of the war. It goes on to chronicle the British retreat from Greece to Egypt as the Axis forces advance in terms of its impact on the everyday lives of the expatriate community. The defence of Egypt and conditions in wartime Palestine are then described in later novels.

==List of characters==
The leading characters, Harriet and Guy Pringle, are based on Manning herself and her husband R. D. Smith. Harriet loves Guy but has to share him with numerous hangers-on, as Guy loves everybody he meets. His character is outgoing and generous, while hers is wistful and introspective.

Other major characters in the novels include:
* Prince Yakimov, an Englishman of noble Russian and Irish descent who, though likable, sponges off the rest of the expatriate community. Manning has said that the scrounging Prince Yakimov is based in the Fitzrovian novelist Julian MacLaren-Ross. (Both are distinguished by an unusual overcoat in which they are always dressed).
* &quot;Dobbie&quot; Dobson, a diplomat whom Guy and Harriet encounter in multiple places.
* Clarence Lawson, a colleague of Guy&#x27;s in Bucharest. An embittered cynic and moper, he is employed by the British propaganda bureau and on relief to Polish refugees.
* Sophie, an attractive but manipulative young woman, part Rumanian and part Jewish. She hopes to acquire a British passport by marrying Guy.
* Dubedat, an English elementary school teacher and bohemian pacifist &#x27;simple lifer&#x27;, who was hitchhiking his way around the Balkans when war broke out. Working class and a scouser.
* David Boyd, a part-time lecturer and an expert on Romanian history and politics employed by the British Embassy. He is a close friend and a Marxist political ally of Guy.
* Klein, a Jewish economist refugee. He has found temporary employment as an advisor to the Romanian government and is a source of news of its intrigues.
* Foxy Leverett, a diplomat who is also working for the British secret service. He is murdered by the fascist Iron Guard in Bucharest.
* Bernard Dugdale, an English diplomat who passes through Bucharest on his way to Ankara.
* Sasha Drucker, a Jewish fugitive, the son of a wealthy banking family.
* Professor Inchcape, an academic attached to the British Council.
* Bella Niculescu, a condescending but sometimes helpful friend of Harriet&#x27;s. A wealthy British expatriate who has married a Bucharest native, Nikko.
* Professor Lord Pinkrose, a pompous visiting lecturer, based on the real life Edward Plunkett, Lord Dunsany
* Toby Lush, an unqualified English teacher looking for work.
* Edwina Little, a pretty, rather empty-headed young woman who shares a Cairo flat with Dobson and the Pringles.
* Charles Warden, a young officer who becomes infatuated with Harriet in Athens.
* Simon Boulderstone, a young officer who encounters Harriet on first arriving in Egypt, and who is wounded at the Second Battle of El Alamein.
* Lady Angela Hooper, a wealthy woman initially married to a nobleman. She has a nervous breakdown after her son is killed by a mortar shell.
* Aiden Pratt, a successful pre-war West End stage actor, now conscripted into the pay corps in Damascus, who befriends Guy and Harriet.
* Bill Castlebar, an occasional poet and lecturer; lover of Angela Hooper.
* Mortimer, a woman serving in the British army assigned to drive supply trucks from Egypt to Syria.
* Major Lister, a British army officer stationed in Jerusalem. A stout, depressed melancholic.

==Reception==
Anthony Burgess described &quot;Fortunes of War&quot; as &quot;the finest fictional record of the war produced by a British writer&quot;. He considered the first three volumes to be &quot;probably the most important long work of fiction written by a woman since the war&quot; and the character of Guy Pringle to be &quot;one of the most fully created male leads in contemporary fiction... He is a sort of civilization in himself&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Television===

The novels were adapted for television by the BBC and available in the US on Masterpiece Theatre in 1987, starring Kenneth Branagh as Guy and Emma Thompson as Harriet. Other stars included Ronald Pickup, Robert Stephens, Alan Bennett and Rupert Graves.

<text>Aubrey Victor &quot;Dit&quot; Clapper (February 9, 1907 – January 20, 1978) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. Clapper played his entire professional career for the Boston Bruins of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1947, the first Honoured Member to be living at the time of his induction.

Clapper was the first NHL player to play 20 seasons, and one of only two to be an All-Star at both forward and defence. The right wing on the powerful &quot;Dynamite Line&quot;—one of the first forward combinations to receive a nickname in hockey history—along with linemates Cooney Weiland and Dutch Gainor, he contributed to the breaking of several scoring records in the 1930s. Towards the end of his career, he was named player-coach of the Bruins, and held the coaching position after his retirement as a player.

==Early years==
Aubrey Clapper, son of Bill Clapper, a lacrosse and factory labourer. He was raised in Hastings, Ontario after relocated several years to Aurora, Ontario (1915-1920) and Oshawa, Ontario (1920-1923). Clapper was given his nickname at an early age when he would lisp his name, the result coming out &quot;Dit.&quot;

Clapper was related to Ed Broadbent, who’s grandmother was cousins with father Bill.
Clapper started his hockey career at age 13, playing minor hockey in Oshawa, and going on to play with the junior league Toronto Parkdale club of the Ontario Hockey Association in 1925, scoring a goal in the team&#x27;s Memorial Cup run that season. The following season he turned professional, playing for the Boston Tigers of the Canadian-American Hockey League.

==NHL career==
The Boston Bruins bought Clapper&#x27;s contract from the Tigers in 1927. Hitherto a defenceman, Bruins&#x27; coach Art Ross decided to try Clapper at right wing, and the experiment stuck. He scored his first NHL goal—ten seconds into his first shift—in the season opener against the Chicago Black Hawks.

The following season, Ross teamed Clapper up with Cooney Weiland and Dutch Gainor to form the renowned Dynamite Line, one of the first named forward lines in history. The Bruins won the American Division that season and went on to their first Stanley Cup championship, with Clapper scoring the winning goal in the first game of their best-of-three series with the New York Rangers.

In the 1930 season, the league considerably liberalized the passing rules, effectively eliminating offsides. The Stanley Cup champion Bruins took especial advantage, breaking many scoring records and recording the highest winning percentage the league would ever see, unsurpassed as of 2024. Leading the charge was the Dynamite Line, as Weiland led the league in scoring, Clapper finishing third and Gainor finishing ninth; Clapper&#x27;s goal total of 41 was the third most in league history at that time. The Dynamite Line scored 102 of the Bruins&#x27; league record 179 goals, as many as last-place Pittsburgh managed. While Clapper scored four goals in six playoff games, the Bruins were shocked in the Stanley Cup finals by the Montreal Canadiens in their best-of-three series.

Clapper married Lorraine Pratt of Vancouver in April 1931.

While Clapper kept his production high in the 1931 season, Gainor&#x27;s scoring fell off badly, and the Dynamite Line was broken up at season&#x27;s end. Clapper&#x27;s 22 goals were good for eighth in the league, and he was named Second team all-star at right wing at year&#x27;s end, the first season such All-Stars were named. The following year Clapper—with Bud Cook replacing the traded Gainor on his line with Weiland—was named team captain and again finished eighth in league scoring, but an injury-riddled Bruins&#x27; team fell into last place and out of the playoffs. While Weiland was dealt to Ottawa for the 1933 season, the Bruins purchased Montreal Maroons star Nels Stewart and paired him with Clapper to form a powerful offensive unit that led the Bruins back to a division championship.

The largest forward of his era at 6′2″ and 200 lbs, Clapper was a notably peaceful player who nonetheless was involved in an unusual incident in the 1937 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Montreal Maroons. Highsticking Maroon Dave Trottier twice in the head, referee Clarence Campbell (the future NHL president) called Clapper a profane name, and Clapper knocked the referee to the ice with a single punch. Speculation was heavy that Clapper&#x27;s punishment would be severe, but Campbell himself pleaded Clapper&#x27;s case, stating that he felt he had provoked the Bruin into the blow; Clapper received only a $100 fine for the incident.

By 1938, Ross believed the Bruins needed an overhaul, and as part of it asked Clapper to move back to defence. Paired with perennial superstar Eddie Shore on the backline, the move proved highly successful, and Clapper was named a First Team NHL All-Star on defence in 1939, 1940 and 1941, leading the Bruins to Stanley Cup victories in 1939 and 1941.

In February 1942, Clapper suffered a severed tendon in a collision with Toronto player Bingo Kampman and was done for the season. It was feared he would be forced into retirement, but he came back next year and returned to form. During the 1944 season, Clapper broke Hooley Smith&#x27;s career record for games played, holding the record until Maurice Richard surpassed him in 1957.

==Player-coach==
During the 1944 season, Clapper filled in as interim coach when Art Ross took ill. In 1945 Ross retired as Bruins&#x27; coach, retaining his general manager&#x27;s position, and named Clapper as player-coach, the only one in team history. Clapper retained his team captaincy until his retirement as a player in 1947, ultimately serving as team captain for longer than any NHL player until Ray Bourque surpassed his total in the 1990s.

==Retirement and legacy==

Hobbled by injuries and with his skills eroded, Clapper originally retired before the start of the 1946–47 season, but returned to play in November 1946 to replace the injured Jack Crawford in the Bruins&#x27; lineup. He played only sporadically thereafter, and retired for good on February 12, 1947. Leading the Bruins to a 10–1 victory over the New York Rangers in his final game (in which Bill Cowley broke the league career scoring record), the Bruins further announced that day that his number #5 sweater would be retired, and the Hockey Hall of Fame immediately inducted him as an Honoured Member. Clapper was the only active player ever to be inducted into the Hall, and at the time the only living Member inducted.

Of his prowess, Bruins goaltending legend Tiny Thompson said: &quot;Clapper diagnosed the plays like a great infielder in baseball. He put himself where the puck had to come.&quot;

Clapper coached the Bruins for two more seasons until, unhappy with the club&#x27;s performance in the 1949 playoffs against Toronto and uneasy about coaching friends with whom he had played, he resigned. Save for a single season coaching the American Hockey League&#x27;s Buffalo Bisons in 1960, in which the team recorded a 33-35-4 record and failed to make the playoffs, he did not again participate in professional hockey.

Clapper ran a plumbing firm and a sporting goods store in Peterborough in retirement, while serving as a director of the Peterborough Petes of the OHA. He briefly attempted a political career, standing as a Liberal candidate for the Peterborough West riding in the 1949 federal election, losing by fewer than 250 votes to incumbent Progressive Conservative Gordon Fraser.

Clapper died of complications from a 1973 stroke, which had left him confined to a wheelchair, on January 20, 1978. He is buried in Trent Valley Cemetery in Hastings, Ontario.

In 1983, the Bruins signed former Montreal Canadiens star Guy Lapointe, Lapointe sought to wear his customary #5 jersey, which had been retired in Clapper&#x27;s honour nearly forty years before. Team general manager Harry Sinden agreed to Lapointe&#x27;s request, but under protests from Clapper&#x27;s family, Bruins superstar Bobby Orr and the public, Lapointe was switched to #27 after a handful of games.

On August 11, 2012, former Hockey Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman, who was a young Peterborough Petes coach when Clapper served on the club&#x27;s board of directors, paid tribute to Clapper. The occasion was the unveiling by Clapper&#x27;s daughter, Marilyn Armstrong, of a new street sign named &quot;Dit Clapper Drive&quot; in Hastings, Ontario.

<doc id="1286067" wikidata="Q389012" url="?curid=1286067" title="Al Williamson">
<text>Alfonso Williamson (March 21, 1931 – June 12, 2010) was an American cartoonist, comic book artist and illustrator specializing in adventure, Western, science fiction and fantasy.

Born in New York City, he spent much of his early childhood in Bogotá, Colombia before moving back to the United States at the age of 12. In his youth, Williamson developed an interest in comic strips, particularly Alex Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;. He took art classes at Burne Hogarth&#x27;s Cartoonists and Illustrators School, there befriending future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel, who introduced him to the work of illustrators who had influenced adventure strips. Before long, he was working professionally in the comics industry. His most notable works include his science-fiction/heroic-fantasy art for EC Comics in the 1950s, on titles including &quot;Weird Science&quot; and &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot;.

In the 1960s, he gained recognition for continuing Raymond&#x27;s illustrative tradition with his work on the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic-book series, and was a seminal contributor to the Warren Publishing&#x27;s black-and-white horror comics magazines &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot;. Williamson spent most of the 1970s working on his own credited strip, another Raymond creation, &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot;. The following decade, he became known for his work adapting &quot;Star Wars&quot; films to comic books and newspaper strips. From the mid-1980s to 2003, he was primarily active as an inker, mainly on Marvel Comics superhero titles starring such characters as Daredevil, Spider-Man, and Spider-Girl.

Williamson is known for his collaborations with a group of artists including Frank Frazetta, Roy Krenkel, Angelo Torres, and George Woodbridge, which was affectionately known as the &quot;Fleagle Gang&quot;. Williamson has been cited as a stylistic influence on a number of younger artists, and encouraged many, helping such newcomers as Bernie Wrightson and Michael Kaluta enter the profession. He has won several industry awards, and six career-retrospective books about him have been published since 1998. Living in Pennsylvania with his wife Corina, Williamson retired in his seventies.

Williamson was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2000.

Al Williamson was born in Manhattan, New York City, New York, one of two children of Sally and Alfonso Williamson, who was of Scottish descent and a Colombian citizen. The family relocated to Bogotá, Colombia, when Al was two years old. &quot;My father was Colombian and my mother was American,&quot; Williamson said in 1997. &quot;They met in the States, got married and went down there. I grew up down there so I learned both English and Spanish at the same time. It was comic books that taught me to read both languages.&quot; At age nine, Williamson took an interest in comic strips via the Mexican magazine &quot;Paquin&quot;, which featured American strips as well as &quot;Underwater Empire&quot; by Argentine cartoonist Carlos Clemen. Later, Williamson was attracted to Alex Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; strip after his mother took him to see the &quot;Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe&quot; movie serial. While living in Bogotá he met future cartoonist Adolfo Buylla, who befriended him and gave him artistic advice. At age 12, in 1943, Williamson moved with his mother to San Francisco, California; they later moved to New York.
In the mid-1940s Williamson continued to pursue his interest in cartooning and began to take art classes with &quot;Tarzan&quot; cartoonist Burne Hogarth, and later at Hogarth&#x27;s Cartoonists and Illustrators School. There he met future cartoonists Wally Wood and Roy Krenkel. According to Williamson, &quot;Roy broadened my collecting horizons, he became my guide to all the great illustrators — the artists who directly influenced adventure cartoonists like [Alex] Raymond and [Hal] Foster. He showed me J.C. Coll, Franklin Booth, Joseph Franke, Dan Smith, Norman Lindsay, Fortunino Matania, and the great &quot;Blue Book&quot; illustrators like Herbert Morton Stoops and Frank Hoban.&quot; As he continued to learn about the cartooning field, he would visit the comic-book publisher Fiction House, meeting such artists as George Evans, Bob Lubbers, John Celardo, and Mort Meskin.

Williamson&#x27;s first professional work may have been helping Hogarth pencil some &quot;Tarzan&quot; Sunday pages in 1948, although Williamson, who had initially believed so, reconsidered in a 1983 interview and recalled that his &quot;Tarzan&quot; work had come after his first two pieces of comic-book art: providing spot illustrations for the story &quot;The World&#x27;s Ugliest Horse&quot; in Eastern Color&#x27;s seminal series &quot;Famous Funnies&quot; #166 (May 1948), and a two-page Boy Scouts story, his first comics narrative, in &quot;New Heroic Comics&quot; #51 (Nov. 1948). (Williamson is also identified as co-penciler, with Frank Frazetta, of a three-page crime story, &quot;The Last Three Dimes&quot;, in Standard Comics&#x27; &quot;Wonder Comics&quot; #20 [Oct. 1948].) Williamson explained that while Hogarth had offered him &quot;Tarzan&quot; work, Williamson &quot;just couldn&#x27;t do it. ... I couldn&#x27;t get it into my little brain that he wanted me to do it exactly the way that he did it,&quot; and instead successfully recommended Celardo, artist of the Tarzan-like feature &quot;Ka&#x27;a&#x27;nga&quot; in Fiction House&#x27;s &quot;Jungle Comics&quot;. As Williamson recalled:
During this period Williamson met his main stylistic influence, Raymond: &quot;I had just turned 18. I had been in the business about six months or so. He gave me about two hours.&quot;

===1950s===

From 1949 to 1951, Williamson worked on science-fiction and Western stories for publishers such as American Comics Group (AGC), Avon Publications, Fawcett Comics, Standard Comics, and, possibly, Toby Press. He began collaborating with Frank Frazetta, who often inked his work; and with Roy Krenkel, who often did backgrounds. Examples of his work from that period include &quot;Chief Victorio&#x27;s Last Stand&quot;, in Avon&#x27;s &quot;Chief Victorio&#x27;s Apache Massacre&quot; (no number, no month, 1951); &quot;Death in Deep Space&quot;, in Magazine Enterprises&#x27; &quot;Jet&quot; #4 (no month, 1951); and &quot;Skull of the Sorcerer&quot;, in ACG&#x27;s &quot;Forbidden Worlds&quot; #3 (Dec. 1951), inked by Wally Wood.

In 1952, upon the suggestion of artists Wally Wood and Joe Orlando, Williamson began working for EC Comics, an influential comic book company with a reputation for quality artists. While at EC, Williamson frequently collaborated with fellow artists Frank Frazetta, Roy Krenkel and Angelo Torres, a group which, along with Nick Meglin and George Woodbridge, became affectionately known as the &quot;Fleagle Gang&quot;, named after a notorious criminal gang. Williamson primarily worked on EC&#x27;s science-fiction comics &quot;Weird Science&quot;, &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Weird Science-Fantasy&quot;, illustrating both original stories, primarily by writer Al Feldstein, and adaptations of stories by authors such as Ray Bradbury and Harlan Ellison, but his work occasionally appeared in EC&#x27;s horror and crime comics as well.

Williamson worked at EC through 1956 until the cancellation of most of the company&#x27;s line. Williamson&#x27;s EC art has been lauded for its illustrative flamboyance, evident in such stories as &quot;I, Rocket&quot;, in &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; #20 (Aug. 1953), co-penciled and co-inked with Frank Frazetta; and &quot;50 Girls 50&quot;, in &quot;Weird Science&quot; #20 (Aug. 1953), co-inked by Williamson and Frazetta. His final published EC story was the 10-page &quot;A Question of Time&quot;, in &quot;Shock Illustrated&quot; #2 (Feb. 1956) with partial inking by Torres, who put his initials on the last page. In the fall of 1956, writer Larry Ivie introduced Williamson to future comics writers-editor Archie Goodwin, with whom he would become friends and, later, a frequent collaborator. Williamson eventually helped Goodwin enter the comics field, having him script a Harvey Comics story, &quot;The Hermit&quot;, penciled by Reed Crandall and inked by Williamson.

From 1955 to 1957, Williamson produced over 400 pages of three-to-five-page stories for Atlas Comics, the 1950s forerunner of Marvel Comics, working in various genres but primarily Westerns. He continued to collaborate with Torres and Krenkel, as well as with Gray Morrow, George Woodbridge and Ralph Mayo. With Mayo, one of the first editors to give Williamson work, at Standard Comics, Williamson collaborated on the jungle girl series &quot;Jann of the Jungle&quot; #16–17 (April and June 1957). Following Mayo&#x27;s death, Williamson drew stories solo for the planned #18, but the series was abruptly canceled before that issue could be published. His &quot;prolific though somewhat uneven two-year stint at Atlas&quot;, where he first drew war comics, yielded superlative art in such stories as &quot;The City That Time Forgot&quot;, in &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; #144 (March 1956); &quot;Menace from the Stars&quot;, in &quot;Mystery Tales&quot; #44 (Aug. 1956); &quot;The Unknown Ones&quot;, in &quot;Astonishing&quot; #57 (Jan. 1957); &quot;Dreadnaught&quot;, in &quot;Navy Tales&quot; #2 (March 1957); and &quot;Helpless&quot;, in &quot;Battle&quot; #55 (Nov. 1957). While &quot;something appeared to be missing from a lot of his Atlas work: enthusiasm,&quot; Williamson&#x27;s Atlas Westerns, at least, &quot;form a strongly consistent body of work, characterized by minimal to nonexistent action, a preponderance of closeups and reaction shots, and well-defined figures set against sparse backgrounds.&quot;

From 1958 to 1959 Williamson worked for Harvey Comics collaborating with former EC artists Reed Crandall, Torres and Krenkel and inking the pencils of Jack Kirby (for &quot;Race to the Moon&quot; #2–3 and &quot;Blast-Off&quot; #1). On inking Kirby, Williamson relates: &quot;I remember going up to Harvey and getting work there. They said, &#x27;We haven&#x27;t got any work for you, but we have some stories here that Jack penciled. Do you want to ink them?&#x27; I&#x27;d never really inked anybody else before, but I said, &#x27;Sure,&#x27; because I looked at the stuff, and thought, I can follow &quot;this&quot;, it&#x27;s all there. I inked it and they liked it, and they gave me three or four stories to do.&quot;

Additionally, Williamson drew stories for &quot;Classics Illustrated&quot; (in collaboration with Crandall and Woodbridge); Canaveral Press&#x27;s line of Edgar Rice Burroughs books (inked by Crandall); Westerns for Dell Comics (including &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; #8–12) and Charlton Comics, including two complete issues of the Cheyenne Kid (#10–11) with Angelo Torres, and science-fiction stories for ACG, including &quot;The Vortex&quot;, in &quot;Forbidden Worlds&quot; #69 (1958). He also worked with former EC artist John Severin on the &quot;American Eagle&quot; feature in &quot;Prize Comics Western&quot; #109 and #113 (1955).

Williamson&#x27;s work during this decade was his most prolific in terms of comic book work and has garnered considerable praise for its high quality. He has been noted for his perfectionism and love for the medium. Despite its high reputation, S.C. Ringgenberg felt that Williamson&#x27;s artwork from this period could at times be uneven and uninspired. Williamson was single during this period and, according to &quot;The Art of Al Williamson&quot;, had a bohemian and undisciplined lifestyle.

===1960s===
In 1960, with little work to be found in the comic book field due to a downturn in the industry, he went to work as an assistant to John Prentice on the Alex Raymond-created comic strip &quot;Rip Kirby&quot; for a three-year period. According to Williamson: &quot;The reason that I was called in to help him out was that John had decided to go to Mexico and Mac [Al McWilliams], John&#x27;s prior assistant, didn&#x27;t want to go... The deal was: would I be willing to go to Mexico?... and I said &#x27;Si!&#x27;...&quot; It proved to be a solid learning period for Williamson, as he credits Prentice with teaching him many fundamental illustration methods. According to Prentice: &quot;...he was terrific. He&#x27;s the best guy I ever had by far.&quot; During that time, Williamson assisted John Cullen Murphy on the &quot;Big Ben Bolt&quot; boxing strip and Don Sherwood on the strip &quot;Dan Flagg&quot;. He produced some sample pages for a proposed Sunday strip version of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;.
He returned to comics in 1965 doing one story each in Gold Key Comics&#x27; &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot; #1 (June 1965), &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; #12 (Aug. 1965), and &quot;Boris Karloff Tales of Mystery&quot; #11 (Sept. 1965), and helped launch Warren Publishing&#x27;s black-and-white horror-comics magazines &quot;Creepy&quot; and &quot;Eerie&quot; with several stories in early issues, while contributing to Warren&#x27;s war comics magazine &quot;Blazing Combat&quot;. He was instrumental in recruiting other former EC Comics artists as Frazetta, Krenkel, Torres, Crandall, and Evans, as well as artist Gray Morrow and writer-editor Archie Goodwin.

In 1966, he drew the first issue (Sept. 1966) of a new &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic book series, published by King Features. Williamson&#x27;s work received positive reader response, and returned to draw issues #4–5 (March and May 1967), as well as the cover of #3 (Jan. 1967). Williamson received a National Cartoonist Society Best Comic Book art award for his work on that title. In 1967, on the strength of a backup feature he had done in the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; book, he took over another Alex Raymond creation, the long-running &quot;Secret Agent X-9&quot; comic strip, collaborating with writer Goodwin. At the start of their tenure, the title was changed to &quot;Secret Agent Corrigan&quot;.

Williamson helped assemble the first major book on Alex Raymond&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, published by Nostalgia Press in 1967, and wrote the introduction. In 1966, Wally Wood&#x27;s alternative-press comic book &quot;witzend&quot; #1 published Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Savage World&quot;, a 1956 story originally drawn for a Buster Crabbe comic book that had been cancelled. With significant contributions by Frazetta, Krenkel, and Torres, the story is a prime sample of the &quot;Fleagle Gang&quot; style and has since been reprinted by Marvel Comics (in the black-and-white comics magazine &quot;Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction&quot; #1, January 1975), Pacific Comics and Kitchen Sink Press. Wood would later write the script for a three-page story drawn by Williamson, &quot;The Tube&quot;, in another alternative-press comic, publisher Flo Steinberg&#x27;s &quot;Big Apple Comix&quot; (1975).

By the end of the decade, Williamson was beginning to encourage younger artists whom he would meet at comic book conventions, helping Bernie Wrightson to enter the comics profession.

===1970s===

Williamson worked on &quot;Secret Agent Corrigan&quot; through the 1970s until he left the strip in 1980. The first Corrigan anthology was published in France in 1975, &quot;Le FBI joue et gagne&quot;, reprinting Williamson&#x27;s first episode on the feature. He returned to Warren Publishing in 1976 and again in 1979 to draw three additional stories in &quot;Creepy&quot; (#83, 86, 112). These were published in France in the collection &quot;Al Williamson: A la fin de l&#x27;envoi&quot; in 1981.

He drew a few more stories for Gold Key Comics, in &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Ghost Stories&quot; #5 and 8 (Aug. 1972, March 1973), and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; #51 (Aug. 1973), as well two mystery stories for DC Comics, in &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; #14 (May 1971), with inker Carlos Garzon, and &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #185 (April 1970), with Michael Kaluta, another artist whom he helped enter the professional field, assisting him. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that &quot;Williamson&#x27;s atmospheric technique, which relied on subtle textures as much as hard lines, was not typical of traditional DC art&quot; and that editor Joe Orlando &quot;got complaints from the production department&quot; over using Williamson&#x27;s art. He drew various Flash Gordon illustrations. In the burgeoning fan movement, Williamson became an early subject of comics historians with the publication of Jim Vadeboncoeur&#x27;s &quot;Al Williamson: His Work&quot; in 1971 and the &quot;Al Williamson Collector&quot; by James Van Hise and Larry Bigman, featured in the fanzine &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Blast Comicollector&quot; in the early 1970s. Samples of his sketches appear in various fanzines of the period. Marvel Comics began regularly reprinting Williamson&#x27;s 1950 Atlas Comics Western stories, starting with &quot;The Ringo Kid&quot; #1 (Jan. 1970) and &quot;Kid Colt Outlaw&quot; #147 (June 1970), further introducing Williamson&#x27;s early work to a latter-day generation.

===1980s===
After leaving the &quot;Secret Agent Corrigan&quot; daily strip, he illustrated the Marvel Comics adaptation of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; with Carlos Garzon, as well as the 50th issue of the monthly &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic. Williamson was Lucasfilm&#x27;s first choice as illustrator for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; newspaper comic strip, a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; adaptation upon Lucasfilm&#x27;s specific request, as George Lucas had an appreciation of Williamson&#x27;s EC Comics and Flash Gordon work. Writer Archie Goodwin cited &quot;the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I&#x27;ve worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best &quot;Star Wars&quot; artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He&#x27;s also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do &quot;Star Wars&quot; material. There was that comfort factor in it as well.&quot;

A comic book adaptation of the Dino De Laurentiis&#x27; film, &quot;Flash Gordon,&quot; written by Bruce Jones and illustrated by Al Williamson, was released by Western Publishing in both hardcover and softcover formats to coincide with the film&#x27;s release. A photograph of actor Sam J. Jones, who played Flash Gordon, was pasted into the original cover art. It was serialized in three issues of Whitman&#x27;s &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; comic book, #31–33, March–May 1981. Alden McWilliams inked the backgrounds for the last 25 pages. According to Williamson, &quot;It was the hardest job I ever had to do in my life.&quot; He then began drawing the &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic strip in February 1981 following Alfredo Alcala&#x27;s tenure, with Goodwin writing. He drew the daily and Sunday feature until March 11, 1984, when the strip was canceled. Williamson&#x27;s daily strips on this series were completely reprinted in Russ Cochran&#x27;s three-volume slipcase edition in 1991.

Returning to comic books full-time for the first time since 1959, Williamson began work for Pacific Comics, collaborating with writer Bruce Jones for the &quot;Alien Worlds&quot; title (#1, 4, 8), and &quot;Cliff Hanger&quot;, a six-issue adventure-strip backup feature in the &quot;Somerset Holmes&quot; miniseries. For Marvel, he illustrated the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; movie adaptations. The two Archie Goodwin stories he illustrated for &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; (&quot;Relic&quot; in issue #27, 1984; and &quot;Out of Phase&quot;, in #34, 1986) have been considered to be some of his finest work, and Williamson himself named &quot;Relic&quot; as one of his best works. The letterer on all these projects was Ed King. Williamson drew a short story for &quot;Timespirits&quot; #4 and the full issue of &quot;Star Wars&quot; #98. For DC Comics, he penciled and inked an eight-page story by Elliot S. Maggin for &quot;Superman&quot; #400 (Oct. 1984) and he inked Rick Veitch on the classic, oft reprinted Alan Moore Superman/Swamp Thing story &quot;The Jungle Line&quot; in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #85 (Sept. 1985).

Following the expiration of his contract on the &quot;Star Wars&quot; newspaper strip, Williamson found that the weight of doing both pencil and inks suddenly became stressful to him, drastically reducing his output. As a response to this, in the mid-1980s Williamson made a successful transition to becoming strictly an inker, beginning at DC Comics inking Curt Swan on &quot;Superman&quot; #408–410 and #412–416. The longtime Man of Steel artist would later describe Williamson as &quot;his favorite inker&quot;. Williamson then moved to Marvel where he inked such pencillers such as John Buscema, Gene Colan, Rick Leonardi, Mike Mignola, Pat Oliffe, John Romita Jr., Lee Weeks, and many others. John Romita Sr., Marvel&#x27;s art director during that time, considered Williamson to be &quot;one of the best pencillers in the world but he really can&#x27;t make a living at penciling because he wants to do these beautifully pencilled pages with ample time to do them. That&#x27;s why Al is inking now ... and adding a greater dimension to the penciller he&#x27;s working with.&quot; He won nine industry awards for Best Inker between 1988 and 1997.

===1990s===
Williamson provided the covers and additional artwork for Dark Horse Comics&#x27; 20-issue &quot;Classic Star Wars&quot; (Aug. 1992 – June 1994), which reprinted his &quot;Star Wars&quot; daily strips. He later inked the &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;A New Hope&quot; film adaptations for the company. Through 2003, he was active as inker on several Marvel Comics titles, including &quot;Daredevil&quot; (#248–300), &quot;Spider-Man 2099&quot; (#1–25), and &quot;Spider-Girl&quot; (#1–61), and such non-superhero projects as the four-issue Marvel / Epic Comics miniseries &quot;Atomic Age&quot; (Nov. 1990 – Feb. 1991), by writer Frank Lovece and penciler Mike Okamoto, one of the works for which Williamson won a 1991 Eisner Award for Best Inker. &quot;Daredevil&quot; penciler John Romita Jr. recalled that, &quot;Working with Al Williamson was much like working with my father [comics artist John Romita Sr.] in that I felt that I was protected from mistakes. ... If my art wasn&#x27;t correct, then Al would repair it. Oddly enough, Al said he never had to fix anything, claiming he just &#x27;traced&#x27; over my pencils.&quot; In a 1988 interview Williamson indeed stated that &quot;I&#x27;m just tracing [Romita&#x27;s] pencils&quot; and claimed that the only changes he made were occasionally leaving out an unnecessary background if he was in a rush.

In 1995, Marvel released a two-part &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; miniseries written by Mark Schultz and drawn by Williamson, which was his last major work doing both pencils and inks. Also with Schultz, he illustrated the short story &quot;One Last Job&quot; for &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #120 in 1997. In 1999, he drew the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; character a final time when regular cartoonist Jim Keefe asked for his help on a &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; Sunday page.

===Later life and career===
Since 1998, there have been six career retrospective books published (see &quot;Further Reading&quot; section). Williamson cooperated with their production, with the exception of the books from Pure Imagination. He was interviewed for the 2003 Frank Frazetta documentary &quot;Painting with Fire&quot;, along with fellow surviving &quot;Fleagle Gang&quot; members Angelo Torres and Nick Meglin. In 2009, a Williamson-illustrated Sub-Mariner story written by Schultz and dedicated to Sub-Mariner creator Bill Everett was published. The story itself was originally drawn ten years previously. Williamson illustrated a &quot;Xenozoic Tales&quot; story written by Schultz that remains unpublished.

Living in Pennsylvania with his wife Corina, Williamson retired in his seventies and died on June 12, 2010, in Upstate New York. Some premature reports, based on unsubstantiated Twitter claims, erroneously gave June 13, 2010.

==Legacy==
Williamson has been a stylistic influence on a number of younger artists such as Tom Yeates, Mark Schultz, Frank Cho, Steve Epting, Tony Harris, Jim Keefe, Dan Parsons, Dave Gibbons, and Paul Renaud.

<text>Clan Donald, also known as Clan MacDonald or Clan McDonald ( ), is a Highland Scottish clan and one of the largest Scottish clans. The Lord Lyon King of Arms, the Scottish official with responsibility for regulating heraldry in that country, issuing new grants of coats of arms, and serving as the judge of the Court of the Lord Lyon, recognises under Scottish law the &quot;High Chief of Clan Donald&quot;. Historically the chiefs of the Clan Donald held the title of Lord of the Isles until 1493 and two of those chiefs also held the title of Earl of Ross until 1476.

There are also numerous branches to the Clan Donald and several of these have chiefs recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms; these are: Clan Macdonald of Sleat, Clan Macdonald of Clanranald, Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, Clan MacDonald of Glencoe, Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, and Clan MacAlister. There are also notable historic branches of Clan Donald without chiefs so-recognised, these are: the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg, Clan MacDonald of Lochalsh, and the MacDonalds of Ardnamurchan. The MacDonnells of Antrim are a cadet branch of the MacDonalds of Dunnyveg but do not belong to the Scottish associations and have a chief officially recognised in Ireland.

==History==

===Origins===
The Norse-Gaelic Clan Donald traces its descent from Dòmhnall Mac Raghnuill (d. circa 1250), whose father Reginald or Ranald was styled &quot;King of the Isles&quot; and &quot;Lord of Argyll and Kintyre&quot;. Ranald&#x27;s father, Somerled was styled &quot;King of the Hebrides&quot;, and was killed campaigning against Malcolm IV of Scotland at the Battle of Renfrew in 1164. Clan Donald shares a descent from Somerled with Clan MacDougall, who traces their lineage from his elder son, Dugall mac Somhairle. Their dynasties are together commonly referred to as the Clann Somhairle. Furthermore, they are descended maternally from both the House of Godred Crovan and the Earls of Orkney, through Somerled&#x27;s wife Ragnhildis Ólafsdóttir, daughter of Olaf I Godredsson, King of Mann and the Isles and Ingeborg Haakonsdottir, daughter of Haakon Paulsson, Earl of Orkney. It remains uncertain if the Clann Somhairle are also descendants in some manner, through one or another of the above dynasts, of the House of Ivar, but this is commonly argued.

Tradition gave Somerled a Gaelic descent in the male line, as the medieval seanchaidhean (Gaelic historians) traced his lineage through a long line of ancestors back to the High Kings of Ireland, namely Colla Uais and Conn of the Hundred Battles. Thus Clan Donald claimed to be both &quot;Clann Cholla&quot; and &quot;Siol Chuinn&quot; (&quot;Children of Colla&quot; and &quot;Seed of Conn&quot;). Possibly the oldest piece of poetry attributed to the MacDonalds is a &quot;brosnachadh&quot; (an incitement to battle) which was said to have been written in 1411, on the day of the Battle of Harlaw. The first lines of the poem begin &quot;A Chlanna Cuinn cuimhnichibh / Cruas an àm na h-iorghaile,&quot; (&quot;Ye children of Conn remember hardihood in the time of battle&quot;). A later poem made to John of Islay (1434–1503), last of the MacDonald Lords of the Isles, proclaims &quot;Ceannas Ghàidheal do Chlainn Cholla, còir fhògradh,&quot; (&quot;The Headship of the Gael to the family of Colla, it is right to proclaim it&quot;), giving MacDonald&#x27;s genealogy back to Colla Uais.

However, a recent DNA study has shown that Somerled was of Norse descent in his male line. By testing the Y-DNA of males bearing the surnames MacDonald, MacDougall, MacAlister, and their variants it was found that a substantial proportion of men tested shared the same Y-DNA and a direct paternal ancestor. This distinct Y-chromosome R1a1 haplotype found in Scotland has been regarded as often showing Norse descent in the Britain and Ireland.

===Scottish-Norwegian War===

In 1263 Alexander III of Scotland defeated Haakon IV of Norway at the Battle of Largs. The Clan Donald chief, Aonghas Mor and his clan had technically been vassals of Haakon and so the king of Scots became their new overlord, as confirmed in the Treaty of Perth.

===Wars of Scottish Independence===

Aongus Mor&#x27;s son was Aonghus Óg of Islay who supported Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. In recognition of Clan Donald&#x27;s support King Robert the Bruce proclaimed that Clan Donald would always occupy the honoured position on the right wing of the Scottish army.

===15th to 16th centuries===
====Succession to the Earldom of Ross====

The title and territory of the Earl of Ross had originally been held by the Chief of Clan Ross but had passed through an heiress to the Leslie or Lesley family in the early 15th century. However, Angus Og&#x27;s grandson, Donald of Islay, Lord of the Isles married Mariota, Countess of Ross (Margaret Lesley) who was the heiress of the Leslie Earls of Ross and he later claimed the position of Earl of Ross through this marriage.

In 1411, Donald secured Dingwall Castle which was the principal seat of the Earldom of Ross, after he had defeated the powerful Clan Mackay who were supporters of the Stewart confederacy at the Battle of Dingwall. This in turn resulted in the Battle of Harlaw on 24 July 1411, fought between Donald of Islay&#x27;s forces and those of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, led by Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar. It is believed there were 10,000 men in Donald&#x27;s army at the Battle of Harlaw. Although he inflicted a decisive victory, he did not go on to Aberdeen but took his army back to the Western Highlands. In the aftermath, Albany tried to take control of Ross but was unsuccessful. and By 1415 the Earldom of Ross was with Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany. Donald prepared for war and proclaimed himself &quot;Lord of Ross&quot;. However, the Duke of Albany appointed his own son John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan as the new Earl of Ross.

In 1429 the Battle of Lochaber took place where forces led by Donald&#x27;s son, Alexander of Islay, 3rd Lord of the Isles and Earl of Ross, fought against the royalist army of James I of Scotland. Two years later the Battle of Inverlochy (1431) took place; While chief Alexander of Islay, Lord of the Isles was imprisoned by King James I, the Clan MacDonald were led by his nephew, Donald Balloch MacDonald, who defeated Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar&#x27;s royal army. The armies of the MacDonald Lords of the Isles were the only magnate forces in Scotland capable of inflicting defeats on the Crown at this time. The Battle of Inverlochy in 1431 is one example of this and the Battle of Lagabraad in Ross in 1480 is another. James I finally conceded to Alexander&#x27;s rule in the Isles and Ross. Thus, the MacDonald chiefs would succeed as the Earls of Ross: firstly Alexander of Islay, Earl of Ross, son of Donald of Islay and Mariota, Countess of Ross, succeeded to the earldom as confirmed by a charter dated September 1437, following the assassination of James I of Scotland in February of the same year. Secondly, Alexander&#x27;s son John of Islay, Earl of Ross who surrendered the earldom in 1475 to the King.

According to 17th century historian Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet who himself was a younger son of Alexander Gordon, 12th Earl of Sutherland, in 1455 the Battle of Skibo and Strathfleet took place where John of Islay invaded Sutherland but was defeated by the Clan Sutherland who were led by Robert Sutherland, brother of John Sutherland, 7th Earl of Sutherland.

====Forfeiture of the Earldom of Ross and Lordship of the Isles====

In 1475, James III of Scotland forfeited the MacDonald Earldom of Ross and although the MacDonald Lordship of the Isles was not forfeited until 1493, in many ways 1475 marked the end of the lordship as a potent force. Following this is what the Books of Clanranald describe as a &quot;great struggle for power among the Gael&quot;. Various leaders, such as Aonghas Óg who was the fourth illegitimate son of the Lord of the Isles, along with his son, Domhnall Dubh, and also Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh and John Mor MacDonald of Dunyvaig were seeking to restore the MacDonald hegemony in the west. The Battle of Bloody Bay took place in 1480 where John MacDonald of Islay, Lord of the Isles and chief of Clan Donald was defeated by his son Aonghas Óg. Aonghas Óg&#x27;s son Domhnall Dubh rebelled against James IV of Scotland and made an alliance with Henry VIII of England in an attempt to regain the Lordship of the Isles and although various attempts were made to restore the lordship, by 1545 all had failed. The ultimate victors were the Crown&#x27;s hard men in the north and west: Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly (chief of Clan Gordon), Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll (chief of Clan Campbell) and John MacIain of Ardnamurchan. The various branches of the Clan Donald began accepting charters from the Crown in recognition of their separate holdings. This was part of a royal policy that successfully kept the Clan Donald divided, and in doing so they were less of a threat to the central authority.

The MacDonnells of Antrim in Northern Ireland were a sept of Clan Donald. MacDonnell migration to the Glens and Rathlin Island increased in the early 16th century after the clan had rejected overtures from an increasingly powerful James IV, King of Scotland.

===17th century; Civil War and 1689–1692 Jacobite rising===

Loss of the Lordship of the Isles fractured Highland society and the MacDonalds in particular, who were left holding lands on either side of the Irish Sea, rather than a unified block of territory. Their attempts to re-establish control destabilised Western Scotland for generations; the charge of &quot;slaughter under trust&quot;, later applied after the Massacre of Glencoe in 1692, was introduced in 1587 to reduce the endemic feuding that resulted. Opponents now had to apply to the Crown to settle disputes, and it applied to murder committed in &quot;cold blood&quot;, i.e. once articles of surrender had been agreed or hospitality accepted. The first recorded use was the 1588 prosecution of Lachlan Maclean, whose objections to his new stepfather, John MacDonald, resulted in the murder of 18 members of the MacDonald wedding party.
The 1638–1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms caused huge dislocation and damage throughout the British Isles; in 1641, the Scottish Covenanter government sent an expeditionary force that joined the vicious and bloody Irish Rebellion. All sides committed atrocities, leading to a series of tit-for-tat responses, exacerbated by long-standing animosities; in 1642 on Rathlin Island, soldiers from a predominantly Clan Campbell-recruited unit led by Sir Duncan Campbell threw scores of MacDonnell women over the cliffs to their deaths on rocks below.

Scotland initially stayed neutral in the First English Civil War but became involved in 1643; the shifting alliances only make sense if one understands that in Scotland, both Royalists and Covenanters agreed that the &quot;institution&quot; of monarchy was divinely ordered, but disagreed on the nature and extent of royal authority in relation to that of the church. This makes it hard to categorise clans as wholly &quot;Royalist&quot;, &quot;Catholic&quot;, or later &quot;Jacobite&quot;.

In 1644, Alasdair Mac Colla landed in Scotland with 1500 Irish troops to link up with the Scottish Royalists; Alasdair was from Clan Donald of Dunnyveg, which historically held lands in the western Scottish islands and North-East Ireland. They joined up with Montrose and played a leading role in the 1644–1645 campaign; this was highly successful, with victory at the Battle of Inverlochy leaving Montrose in effective control of Scotland.

Inverlochy and the entire Montrose campaign are often presented as a clan battle between Campbells and MacDonalds; while there is certainly some truth in this, many others were involved. The persistence of this idea in Gaelic folklore was partly driven by deliberate policy, since Montrose used it as a means of recruiting. Ultimately the campaign ended in failure and division, since Mac Colla&#x27;s objective was to regain territories in the Western Highlands, while Montrose&#x27;s was to move south and aid Charles. The two split; Mac Colla&#x27;s ravaging of Campbell lands was still remembered with deep bitterness 300 years later.

In 1692 in the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 unarmed MacDonalds from the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were murdered when an initiative to suppress Jacobitism was entangled in the long-running feud, and MacIain, who was the chief of the MacDonalds of Glencoe, was late in signing an oath of allegiance to William III of England. The event served as part of the inspiration for &quot;The Red Wedding&quot; as featured in books and TV series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

===18th century and Jacobite risings===
====Jacobite rising of 1715====

During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the MacDonalds supported the Jacobite cause of the House of Stuart. Men of Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, and the Clan Macdonald of Clanranald fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir on 13 November 1715 where chief Allan MacDonald of Clanranald was killed. The Clan MacDonald of Glencoe also fought at Sherriffmuir.

====Jacobite rising of 1745====

During the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Clan MacDonell of Glengarry along with the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch and the MacDonalds of Glencoe fought as Jacobites at the Battle of Prestonpans on 21 September 1745.

The Clan MacDonald of Clanranald, along with the Clan MacDonald of Glengarry, and Clan MacDonald of Keppoch, fought as Jacobites at the Battle of Falkirk Muir on 17 January 1746

The Clan MacDonald of Glencoe, Clan MacDonald of Clanranald, and Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, fought as Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746, as did the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch whose chief, Alexander MacDonald of Keppoch, was killed.

The Clan MacDonald of Sleat branch had fought for the Jacobites in the 1715 rebellion, however they actually formed two battalions (Independent Highland Companies) in support of the British Government during the 1745 rebellion and as a result the Sleat possessions remained intact. However, according to A and A MacDonald these two companies were more of a hindrance than help to the Government as they were made up of officers and men who were in entire sympathy with the Jacobite &quot;Prince&quot; Charles Edward Stuart.

==Chief==
In 1947, the Lord Lyon King of Arms granted the undifferenced arms of Macdonald to Alexander Godfrey Macdonald, 7th Lord Macdonald, making him the first High Chief of Clan Donald. After his death in 1970, he was succeeded by his son Godfrey James Macdonald of Macdonald, 8th Lord Macdonald, who is the current high chief of Clan Donald. In 1972, the Macdonald estates were sold off to pay death duties. Lord Macdonald lives at Kinloch Lodge on Skye with his wife, the food writer Claire Macdonald (m. 1969).

<text>Elektrit Radiotechnical Society () was the largest privately owned company in Wilno, Second Republic of Poland (now Vilnius, Lithuania) (1925–39).

With over 1100 workers, the society produced approximately 50 thousand radio receivers annually. A large percentage of the production was exported abroad, mostly to Sweden, Germany, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. The annual turnover exceeded US$1 million. Elektrit proved to be a very successful company and soon became a leading radio manufacturer in Poland.

Following the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Wilno was occupied by the Soviet Union and the company was nationalized. In 1940 the factory was hastily dismantled and transported to Minsk, where the &quot;Vyacheslav Molotov&quot; Radio Factory was set up. After the war the plant was renamed Minsk Radio and Television Association &quot;Horizont&quot; (Horizon). It produced &quot;Minsk&quot; radio receivers, being copies of Polish pre-war models but with Soviet tube set.

The former Elektrit buildings in Vilnius were used for the Kailis forced labor camp during the German occupation and by a secret Soviet radio factory of the Ministry of Aviation Industry, known as PO Box 555.

<text>Gordon Arthur Drillon (October 23, 1913 – September 23, 1986) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. He was born in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. From 1936 through to 1942 he was part of one of the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s most prolific scoring lines as a member of the Toronto Maple Leafs. He won a Stanley Cup during the 1941–42 season, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1975.

==Playing career==
Drillon played seven seasons in the NHL, six of those with Toronto and one with the Montreal Canadiens. A winger noted for his deadly accurate shot, he created a specific style of play that made him a leading scorer. Drillon&#x27;s strong frame made it difficult for opposing defencemen to clear him from the front of the net. He was able to securely park himself in front of the opposing netminder to re-direct shots or pick up rebounds. This style of play would earn him a league scoring title in the 1937–38 season. Future stars such as Phil Esposito, Dino Ciccarelli, and Dave Andreychuk emulated his innovative style with great success.

Traded to the Montreal Canadiens for the 1943 season, Drillon finished second on the team in goals scored. At season&#x27;s end, Drillon cut short his hockey career and joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, serving for the remainder of World War II. After the war, he worked as a hockey coach in Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland in the 1948/49 season. Drillon later returned to his native New Brunswick where he was employed as a scout for the Maple Leafs, covering the Maritime provinces. He eventually accepted a job with the New Brunswick civil service. In 1975, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Drillon died in Saint John, New Brunswick, in 1986 and was interred there in the Ocean View Memorial Gardens cemetery.

<doc id="1286087" wikidata="Q838199" url="?curid=1286087" title="Round goby">
<text>The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is a euryhaline bottom-dwelling species of fish of the family Gobiidae. It is native to Central Eurasia, including the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Round gobies have established large non-native populations in the Baltic Sea, several major Eurasian rivers, and the North American Great Lakes.

==Characteristics==
Round gobies are small, soft-bodied fish characterized by a distinctive black spot on the first dorsal fin. The eyes are large and protrude slightly from the top of the head and, like most gobies, the pelvic fins are fused to form a single disc (shaped like a suction cup) on the belly. Round gobies range in length from , with a maximum size of . They weigh between , their weight increasing with age. Male round gobies are larger than females. Juvenile round gobies (less than one year old) are grey. Upon maturation, round gobies become mottled with grey, black, brown, and olive green markings. Adult male round gobies turn inky black during the spawning season and develop swollen cheeks. Male and female round gobies are easily differentiated by the shape of their urogenital papilla, which in males is white to grey and long and pointed and in females is brown, short, and blunt-tipped. 

==Distribution and habitat==
Round gobies are widespread in the Sea of Marmara and in the rivers of its basin and can also be found in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, along all coasts and fresh waters of their basins as well as in the coastal lakes and lagoons. They are also found in the rivers of Crimea and the Caucasus (Mezib, Pshada, Vulan, Kodori, and Çoruh) and in the Caspian Sea, represented by subspecies &quot;Neogobius melanostomus affinis&quot;.

Since 1990, the round goby has been registered as introduced in the North American Great Lakes, in parts of Europe, and in the Baltic Sea as an invasive species. The first catch in North America was documented by Jude et al. 1992 and Crossman et al. 1992, caught by an angler in Sarnia, Ontario, fishing the St. Clair River on June 28, 1990. The studies of Jude, Crossman, together with Jude et al. 1995 found a range of sizes between in the St. Clair. Round gobies are also rapidly expanding into tributaries of the Great Lakes in North America and were recently discovered in at least one of the Finger Lakes in New York State (Cayuga Lake). The first round goby in the Hudson River was discovered by the state of New York in 2021.

Round gobies are euryhaline (salt-tolerant) and live in both freshwater and marine ecosystems, up to a mineralization of 18–24%. They are commonly found on continental shelves with sandy and rocky bottoms with low silting at depths from to .

==Feeding==
Round gobies actively feed both nocturnally and diurnally and are believed to detect prey only while stationary. The primary diet of round gobies includes mollusks, crustaceans, worms, fish eggs, zebra mussels, small fish, insect larvae, and other small invertebrates (insects and amphipods) living on the bottom of lakes and streams. In spring, the main elements of their diet in the Sasyk Lagoon are &quot;Hydrobia&quot;, &quot;Cerastoderma&quot;, and &quot;Abra&quot;. In the same season, near the Romanian coasts of the Black Sea, the round goby feeds on polychaetes, crustaceans (&quot;Idotea balthica&quot;, &quot;Pachygrapsus marmoratus&quot;, &quot;Xantho poressa&quot;, etc.), and juvenile gobies. Near Sevastopol, the round goby feeds on molluscs (&quot;Mytilaster lineatus&quot; and &quot;Abra&quot; sp.). In the Baltic Sea, they impact &quot;Mytilus edulis&quot; populations.

In the Gulf of Odessa, twenty-three items are identified in the diet of the round goby; &quot;Mytilus galloprovincialis&quot;, &quot;Setia pulcherrima&quot;, &quot;Mytilaster lineatus&quot;, &quot;Lentidium mediterraneum&quot;, &quot;Idotea balthica&quot;, and &quot;Alitta (Nereis) succinea&quot; dominate in the spring, while in the summer, the diet consists mainly of &quot;Sphaeroma pulchellum&quot; and &quot;L. mediterraneum&quot;. The mussels &quot;M. galloprovincialis&quot; and &quot;M. lineatus&quot; are important in all seasons.

In the Great Lakes, where it is invasive, they prey on &quot;Dreissena polymorpha&quot;, another Great Lakes exotic from the same native region. A complete lateral line system allows them to feed in complete darkness. In the Great Lakes, they also eat the young and eggs of &quot;Cottus bairdii&quot;, &quot;Percina caprodes&quot;, &quot;Etheostoma&quot; spp., and &quot;Salvelinus namaycush&quot;, among other species, making them a threat to those native populations.

==Reproduction==
Female round gobies reach sexual maturity in one to two years while males do so in three to four years. Gobies in the Laurentian Great Lakes typically mature up to one year earlier than in their native habitat in Europe. Females can spawn up to six times during the spawning season, which spans April to September in most areas.

Males will migrate from deeper water, where overwintering occurs, into shallower breeding grounds during the beginning of the mating season. They then release a steroid sex pheromone that attracts females to their territory. Males also use visual displays, including posturing and changing color from beige to black during mating season, and can produce sounds during courtship. The females deposit their eggs in male-guarded crevices between rocks. Eggs are in size, while egg clutches can contain up to five thousand eggs. Males are territorial and will defend eggs from predators as well as continuously fan them to provide the developing embryos with oxygenated water. This results in successful hatch rates of up to 95%.

==Invasive species==
The species was accidentally introduced into the North American Great Lakes by way of ballast water transfer in cargo ships. First discovered in North America in the St. Clair River in 1990, the round goby is considered an invasive species with significant ecological and economic impact. The consequences of introduction are quite complex, as the fish both competes with native species and provides an abundant source of food for them, while consuming other invasive species itself. In other words, the round goby behaves much like most biological invasive controls. An aggressive fish, the round goby outcompetes native species such as the sculpin and logperch for food (such as snails and mussels), shelter, and nesting sites, substantially reducing their numbers. Round gobies are also voracious predators of eggs of native fish, many of them important to the angling industry. The goby&#x27;s robust ability to survive in degraded environmental conditions has helped to increase its competitive advantage compared to native species.

Many native predatory fish such as smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, salmon, and trout have begun to prey on round gobies. The incorporation of the round goby into native foodwebs, coupled with the goby&#x27;s ability to consume large numbers of invasive mussels (zebra and quagga), may result in greater bioaccumulation of toxins such as PCBs higher in the food chain, since these mussels filter-feed and are known to accumulate persistent contaminants. However, this is partly beneficial because even though they do not reduce the population of zebra mussels, they do control their population. Hence, it prevents a large-scale spread of the zebra mussel, which is also an invasive species in the Great Lakes. Another unintended benefit of the round goby&#x27;s introduction is that the Lake Erie watersnake, once listed as a threatened species, has found the goby to be a highly favorable addition to its diet. A recent study found the introduced fish now accounts for up to 90% of the snake&#x27;s prey. The new food supply means that the water snake is now staging a comeback. Round gobies also serve as food for a variety of predatory fishes in the Great Lakes, including bass, lake trout, lake whitefish, burbot, lake sturgeon, and walleye.

The round goby is also considered invasive in parts of Europe. This process was started by its introduction to the Gulf of Gdańsk (southern Baltic Sea) in 1990. Locations recently invaded by round gobies include the Aegean Sea, different parts of the Baltic Sea, the North Sea basin, and the Danube and Rhine basins. In the German part of the Baltic Sea this fish was first noted near Rügen Island. It is now distributed all along the southwestern Baltic Sea coast, including Stettiner Haff (Szczecin Lagoon), the Unterwarnow (Warnow river estuary), the mouth of the Trave, and the Nord-Ostsee (Kiel) Canal.

As of 2010, the westernmost site of round goby occurrence in Europe was the lower Scheldt, including the tidal zone in the river mouth, and Albert Canal, Belgium. In 2011, the round goby began invading the fresh waters of France; the species appeared in the Rhine River (on the border between France and Germany) and in the French part of the Moselle River.

==Parasites==
In total, fifty-two parasite species are registered in the round goby in its native area. The most abundant parasites of the Black Sea round goby are metacercariae of trematodes of the Heterophyidae family, such as &quot;Cryptocotyle concavum&quot;, &quot;C. lingua&quot;, and &quot;Pygidiopsis genata&quot;. The trematodes &quot;C. lingua&quot; and &quot;P. genata&quot; can infest humans. In the 1950s, along the coast of the Gulf of Taganrog (Sea of Azov), the round goby was registered as a host of epizootic nematodes &quot;Tetrameres fissispina&quot; and &quot;Streptocara crassicauda&quot;, which were fatal to ducklings.

In the Gulf of Gdańsk, Baltic Sea, the parasites of the invasive round goby consist of twelve species. The core of the parasite fauna comprises two species of trematode metacercariae: &quot;C. concavum&quot; and &quot;Diplostomum spathaceum&quot;. Also in the Baltic Sea, the round goby is a paratenic host of the invasive nematode &quot;Anguillicoloides crassus&quot;. In the Vistula Lagoon, the most abundant parasites of the round goby are nematodes &quot;Hysterothylacium aduncum&quot; and &quot;Anguillicoloides crassus&quot;.

Twenty-five species of parasites are noted in the round goby in the American Great Lakes. The trematode &quot;D. spathaceum&quot; is the most abundant core species overall, while the cestode &quot;Proteocephalus&quot; sp. and the trematode &quot;Neochasmus umbellus&quot; are also well represented. The round goby may prevent some of the metacercariae of &quot;N. umbellus&quot; from completing their life cycle. The parasite &quot;load&quot; on the invasive gobies in the Great Lakes appears relatively low in comparison with their native habitats, lending support to the &quot;enemy release hypothesis&quot;.

<text>The Harvard University Science Center is Harvard University&#x27;s main classroom and laboratory building for undergraduate science and mathematics, in addition to housing numerous other facilities and services. 
Located just north of Harvard Yard, the Science Center was built in 1972 and opened in 1973 after a design by Josep Lluís Sert, who was then dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design.

== History ==
=== Planning ===

Harvard had been interested in building an undergraduate science center in the 1950s and 1960s. However, in the midst of an economic decline, funding could not be found. No concrete plans were made until in 1968, Edwin Land, inventor of the Polaroid &quot;Land&quot; camera, made a $12.5 million donation to construct a science center specifically for undergraduates.

Opponents of the plan feared that funding would be insufficient to complete the project, and that the building&#x27;s maintenance costs would be unreasonably high. The Biology Department also protested the move of its undergraduate-instruction facilities far from the department&#x27;s main quarters. Professor George Wald argued that this would degrade the quality of instruction. There was also dissatisfaction with cancellation of plans at that time for a new biochemistry building.

The plan called for demolition of Lawrence Hall, a laboratory and a living space built in 1848. By the time of the scheduled demolition, a commune of students and &quot;street people&quot; calling themselves the &quot;Free University&quot; had taken residence in the unused building. The controversy was rendered moot when fire gutted the building a month later in May 1970.

As part of the project, in 196668 the portion of Cambridge Street running along the north edge of Harvard Yard was depressed into a 4-lane motor vehicle underpass, thus allowing unhindered pedestrian movement between the Yard and Harvard facilities to the north, including the new Science Center. Architectural historian Bainbridge Bunting wrote that this was the &quot;most important improvement in Cambridge since the construction of [what would later be called] Memorial Drive in the 1890s&quot;.

=== Construction ===
Harvard commissioned architects Sert, Jackson and Associates to design and build the facility. Josep Lluis Sert, who had become Dean of the Harvard School of Design in 1953, had designed a number of other Harvard buildings, including Peabody Terrace, Holyoke Center (now the Smith Campus Center), and the Harvard Divinity School&#x27;s Center for the Study of World Religions. These buildings were part of a modernist movement that sought to break away from the Georgian and related styles used at Harvard for hundreds of years. Thus, the Science Center is largely steel and concrete, with abundant natural light. Construction lasted from 1970 to 1972.

From 2001 to 2004 a $22 million, renovation created space for the Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments and expanded other facilities. A room-sized historic electromechanical computer built in 1944, the Harvard Mark I, was displayed on the ground floor next to the central stairwell in the main lobby of the building (it has since been moved to the Science and Engineering Complex (SEC) in Allston, Massachusetts).

== Facilities ==
The Science Center comprises nine stories, plus a basement and observatory floor. It houses the History of Science, the Mathematics, and the Statistics Departments. Other facilities include:
* Cabot Science Library
* Collection of Historical Scientific Instruments (CHSI), housing the History of Science Department&#x27;s 20,000 objects, dating back to 1400
* 5 large lecture halls, seating between 132 and 500
* 15 smaller general-use classrooms
* Teaching laboratories for chemistry, physics, biology, and other sciences
* Rooftop astronomical observatory with large optical telescopes
* Faculty and staff offices

Secreted beneath the Science Center itself and its courtyard (and largely unknown those who work and study at Harvard) is a &quot;gargantuan&quot; chilled water plant, &quot;a magnificent Piranesi-like interior with the volume of Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall&quot; providing cooling to many Harvard buildings from the Science Center northward. The building itself was first opened around the time of the 1973 oil crisis, and was plagued with huge energy costs, temperature control problems, and roof leaks for decades.

The plaza between the Science Center and Harvard Yard, created by the depression of Cambridge Street and Broadway into a large tunnel, is used at various times for food trucks, roller skating, ice skating, and other activities such as markets and concerts. Tents are erected for special events such as Commencement.
The Tanner Fountain, a sculptural installation of large boulders and landscaping, operates during warm weather.

<doc id="1286105" wikidata="Q86001" url="?curid=1286105" title="Alice Orlowski">
<text>Alice Orlowski (30 September 1903 – 21 May 1976) was a German concentration camp guard at several of the Nazi concentration camps in German-occupied Poland (1939-1945) during World War II. After the war, a Polish court convicted of her crimes against humanity, and she served 10 years in prison in Poland. In 1973, Orlowski, now 70 and living as a pensioner in West Germany, muttered that only &quot;half the work&quot; had been finished, referring to the Holocaust. She was promptly arrested, convicted of making antisemitic remarks, and sentenced to 10 months in prison.

==Wartime==
Born as Alice Minna Elisabeth Elling in Berlin in 1903, she began to train as a guard at the Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany in 1941. In October 1942, she was selected as one of the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) &quot;Aufseherin&quot; to be posted at the Majdanek camp near Lublin, in German-occupied Poland, where, along with Hermine Braunsteiner, she came to be regarded as two of the most brutal overseers. They regularly loaded trucks of women destined for the gas chambers. When a child was left over, the two would throw him or her on the top of the adults like luggage and bolt the door shut in what they called &quot;a space-saving operation&quot;. Orlowski often awaited the arrivals of new transports of women. She would then whip the prisoners, especially across the eyes. In Majdanek, Orlowski was promoted to the rank of &quot;Kommandoführerin&quot; (Work Detail Overseer) in the sorting sheds.

As the SS Aufseherin, Orlowski supervised over 100 women, who sorted through items taken from prisoners who had been gassed: watches, furs, coats, gold, jewellery, money, toys, glasses, and so on. When the camp was evacuated, the Germans sent Orlowski to the notorious Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp near Kraków, in German-occupied Poland. In Plaszow-Kraków, Orlowski was in charge of a work detail on the Camp Street (Lager Strasse) and was known for her viciousness.

In early January 1945, Orlowski was among the SS women posted on the death march to Auschwitz-Birkenau and it was during this time that her behaviour, previously observed as being brutal and sadistic, became more humane. On the death march in mid-January 1945 from Auschwitz to Loslau, Orlowski gave comfort to the inmates, and even slept alongside them on the ground outside. She also brought water to those who were thirsty. It is unknown why her attitude changed, but some speculate that she sensed the war was almost over and she would soon be tried as a war criminal. Orlowski ended up back at Ravensbrück as a guard.

==Post-war==
After the war ended in May 1945, Orlowski was captured by Soviet forces and extradited to Poland to stand trial for war crimes. The &quot;picture book SS woman&quot; stood accused at the Auschwitz Trial in 1947. She was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was released in 1957 after serving 10 years. After her release, Orlowski moved to West Germany.

In 1973, Orlowski was at a counter in Cologne when she complained that only &quot;half the work&quot; had been finished, referring to the extermination of the Jews and also allegedly said that it took twice as long to serve a beer as it did to kill all the Jews. In response, she was arrested for hate speech. A West German court found her guilty of making antisemitic remarks and sentenced her to 10 months in prison, of which she served 8 months.

In 1975, the West German authorities arrested Orlowski a second time, for crimes committed in Majdanek. She was put on trial in the Third Majdanek Trial. Orlowski died from natural causes during her trial on 21 May 1976.

<text>Marion Lee &quot;Mickey&quot; Thompson (December 7, 1928March 16, 1988) was an American auto racing builder and promoter.

A hot rodder since his youth, Thompson increasingly pursued land speed records in his late 20s and early 30s. He achieved international fame in 1960, when he became the first American to break the 400-mph barrier, driving his &quot;Challenger 1&quot; to a one-way top speed of 406.60 mph at the Bonneville Salt Flats and surpassing John Cobb&#x27;s one-way world record mark of 402 mph.

Thompson then turned to racing, winning many track and dragster championships. In the 1960s, he also entered cars at the Indianapolis 500. Later, he formed off-road racing sanctioning bodies SCORE International and Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group (MTEG).

In 1988, Thompson and his wife Trudy were gunned down at their home in Bradbury, California. The crime remained unsolved until 2007, when a former business partner was convicted of the murders.

==Early life==
On December 7, 1928, Thompson was born in Alhambra, California. Thompson&#x27;s father was Captain Marion L. Thompson, a former police officer with Alhambra Police Department. Thompson&#x27;s sister is Collene Thompson Campbell.
== Career ==
In his early 20s, Thompson worked as a pressman for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; while pursuing hot rodding. He later became involved in the new sport of drag racing.

Over the course of his career, Thompson set more speed and endurance records than any other man in automotive history. He is credited with designing and building the first slingshot dragster, in 1954, moving the seat behind the rear axle to improve traction when existing racing tires proved unable to handle the output of increasingly powerful custom engines. This car, the &quot;Panorama City Special&quot;, debuted at the first NHRA U.S. Nationals at the Great Bend Municipal Airport in Great Bend, Kansas, in 1955. The car ultimately ran a best speed of . A change so momentous would not happen again until Don Garlits introduced the rear-engined digger in 1971. Thompson also was noted for being the first manager of Lions Drag Strip in Wilmington, California, in 1955.

Thompson collaborated with Fritz Voight on a 1958 twin-engined dragster. This car achieved a best speed of . It provided lessons later applied to &quot;Challenger I&quot;. Determined to set a new land speed record, Thompson achieved fame when he drove his four-engined &quot;Challenger 1&quot; at better than in 1960 at the Bonneville Salt Flats, becoming the first American to break that barrier.

==Indianapolis 500s==
===1962===

In 1962, Thompson entered three John Crosthwaite-designed cars in the Indianapolis 500. They used a stock V8 Buick engine, and it was in the rear unlike the front-engined, race-tuned, Offenhauser-powered cars used by most competitors. It was the first stock engine to be raced at Indy since 1946. Thompson&#x27;s crew, led by Fritz Voigt, was young, smart, and hard working. Working 12- to 14-hour days, the car was designed and built in 120 days. For the race, the engine (enlarged to 4.2-L capacity, the maximum allowed by the regulations for &quot;stock block&quot; engines) had to be detuned because they were concerned it would not last the distance. Despite being more than 70 bhp down on the other cars, Dan Gurney qualified eighth and was in ninth place until a leaking oil seal seized the gearbox and ended his race on lap 94. He was placed 20th out of 33. The team won the Mechanical Achievement Award for original design, construction, and accomplishment.

===1963===

Thompson&#x27;s promotional skills pleased the sponsors with the publicity generated that year. For the 1963 Indianapolis 500, Crosthwaite designed the innovative Harvey Aluminium Special &quot;roller skate car&quot; with the then-pioneering diameter wheels with smaller-profile racing tires, wide at the front and rear. Thompson took five cars to Indianapolis - two of the previous year&#x27;s design with Chevrolet V8 engines and three roller skate cars. One of the new cars, the Harvey Titanium Special, featured a lightweight titanium chassis. Al Miller raced one of the modified 1962 cars to ninth place despite only qualifying in 31st position. Duane Carter qualified one of the roller skate cars 15th, but was only placed 23rd after an engine failure on the 100th lap. The small tire sizes and low car weights caused complaints among the old hands and owners, so for future races, cars were restricted to minimum tire sizes and minimum car weights.

 Formula One World Champion Graham Hill tested one of the roller skate cars at Indianapolis in 1963, but refused to race it, citing its poor handling. The recent ruling required 15-in wheels, but the chassis was designed around smaller wheels. Thompson commented: &quot;The car wouldn&#x27;t handle&quot;, adding, &quot;There was too much body roll due to the high center of gravity.&quot;

In 1963, Thompson traveled to England, where, along with Dante Duce, he demonstrated his Ford-powered Harvey Aluminum Special dragster at the Brighton Speed Trials. It was then displayed at the Racing Car Show in London in January 1964.

===1964===

Thompson brought three modified 12-inch-tired cars to the 1964 Indianapolis 500, but new rules required him to use 15-in tires. The Allstate sponsored team used Allstate tires and Ford engines. The chassis had to be altered to accommodate the larger Ford engines. Two of them qualified for the race. The car No. 84 began the month with Masten Gregory as the driver, but Eddie Johnson in car No. 84 qualified 24th and finished 26th. Dave MacDonald in car No. 83 qualified 14th and died in a fiery crash on the second lap.

===1965–1968===
Thompson went back to Indy in 1965, but failed to qualify for the 1965 Indianapolis 500 in an attempt with a front-engined roadster. He skipped the 1966 Indianapolis 500, but tried again in 1967 and 1968, but failed to qualify either year.
The 1967 attempt used a unique all-wheel drive rear-engined design that steered both front and rear wheels, but Gary Congdon was unable to qualify any of the three cars.

==Post Indy==
In 1965, Thompson published &quot;Challenger: Mickey Thompson&#x27;s own story of his life of Speed&quot;. In 1968, he and Danny Ongais took three Ford Mustang Mach 1 to the Bonneville salt flats for a feature in &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine, in the process setting 295 speed and endurance records over a series of 500-mile and 24-hour courses. Together with John Buttera and Pat Foster, developed a Ford Mustang Mach 1 Funny Car with a dragster-like chassis. Driven by Ongais, the car won the 1969 NHRA Spring Nationals at Dallas and the NHRA U.S. Nationals.

In his career, Thompson raced vehicles from stock cars to off-road, and engineered numerous competition engines. He went into the performance aftermarket business in the early 1960s and then, in 1963, he created &quot;Mickey Thompson Performance Tires&quot; that developed special tires for racing including for Indianapolis 500 competitors.

Thompson founded SCORE International in 1973, a sanctioning body to oversee off-road racing across North America. With his wife Trudy he formed the Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group (MTEG), which ran an indoor motocross and off-road vehicle racing show and competition that brought the sport from the back-country to major metropolitan stadiums and arenas.

== Murders ==
On March 16, 1988, Thompson and his wife Trudy were murdered by two hooded gunmen outside their home in Bradbury, California.

On the morning of the murder, a pair of unknown assailants waited outside the Thompson home for the couple to leave for the day. Thompson opened the garage door for his wife to pull out in her vehicle and as he headed for his own car, the gunmen attacked. He was shot and wounded then dragged out into the driveway while one of the attackers went after Trudy as she backed out. Killing her, the gunman then came back up the driveway, where the other gunman was watching over Thompson and shot him fatally in the head. The attackers then made their escape on bicycles they had ridden to the residence. Expensive jewelry and a large amount of cash were found on the Thompsons&#x27; bodies, eliminating robbery as a likely motive.

A police investigation initially failed to identify the gunmen or a motive for the crime. Police were interested in Thompson&#x27;s former business partner, Michael Frank Goodwin, who repeatedly refused to pay a more than $768,000 settlement he owed Thompson. Goodwin and his wife bought $275,000 worth of gold coins two months before the Thompsons were murdered and wired $400,000 to banks in Grand Turk Island. Goodwin and his wife then left the US five months after the murder on their yacht and did not return for more than two years.

The case remained unsolved until 2001, when Goodwin was charged in Orange County, California with the murders. Before the trial could be completed, it was ended on jurisdictional grounds by the California District Court of Appeal. On June 8, 2004, Goodwin was charged with the murders in Pasadena, in Los Angeles County. In October 2006, a Pasadena Superior Court judge ordered Goodwin to stand trial.

During the trial, several witnesses reported hearing Goodwin threaten to kill the Thompsons. &quot;I’m going to kill that son of a bitch. I’m going to kill that motherfucker. I’m going to take out Mickey. I’m too smart to get caught. I’ll have him wasted. He’ll never see a nickel. I’ll kill him first. Mickey doesn’t know who he is fucking with. He is fucking dead.&quot;

On January 4, 2007, the jury found Goodwin guilty of two counts of murder in the death of Thompson and his wife. Goodwin was sentenced to two consecutive life-without-parole terms. A subsequent motion for a new trial was denied. In the 2015 California 2nd District Court of Appeal ruling, although no direct evidence connected Goodwin to the case, the array of circumstantial evidence was found to be &quot;overwhelming&quot;. The two men who murdered the Thompsons have not been located.

TV coverage and its fictionalization through the television program &quot;&quot;, were cited by the defense team during the murder trial as having created a &quot;folklore&quot; around the case, preventing a fair trial.

<doc id="1286119" wikidata="Q2963285" url="?curid=1286119" title="Chicago (poem)">
<text>&quot;Chicago&quot; is a poem by Carl Sandburg about the city of Chicago that became his adopted home. It first appeared in &quot;Poetry&quot;, March 1914, the first of nine poems collectively titled &quot;Chicago Poems&quot;. It was republished in 1916 in Sandburg&#x27;s first mainstream collection of poems, also titled &quot;Chicago Poems&quot;.

Sandburg moved to Chicago in 1912 after living in Milwaukee, where he had served as secretary to Emil Seidel, Milwaukee&#x27;s Socialist mayor. Harriet Monroe, a fellow resident of Chicago, had founded the magazine &quot;Poetry&quot; in 1912. Monroe liked and encouraged Sandburg&#x27;s plain-speaking free verse style, strongly reminiscent of Walt Whitman. &quot;Chicago Poems&quot; established Sandburg as a major figure in contemporary literature.

Sandburg has described the poem as
The &quot;Chicago Poems&quot; and its follow-up volumes of verse, &quot;Cornhuskers&quot; (1918) and &quot;Smoke and Steel&quot; (1920), represent Sandburg&#x27;s attempts to create an American version of social realism, writing expansive verse in praise of American agriculture and industry. All of these tendencies are manifest in &quot;Chicago&quot; itself. Then as now, the city of Chicago was a hub of commodities trading and a key financial center for agricultural markets. The city&#x27;s function and ability to get product to market helped make it an international hub. These industries are mentioned in the poem.

One of Chicago&#x27;s many nicknames, &quot;City of the Big Shoulders,&quot; is taken from the poem&#x27;s fifth line.

<text>Emilio Villoresi (December 7, 1914 – June 20, 1939), also known with his nickname &quot;Mimì&quot; Villoresi, a was an Italian Grand Prix motor racing driver.

Emilio Villoresi was born in Milan, Lombardy. He was the younger brother of the Maserati driver Luigi Villoresi who co-drove with him in several races at the beginning of their career. Emilio Villoresi and his brother first competed together in the 1935 and 1936 Mille Miglia driving a Fiat 508CS Balilla Sport but after a disappointing finish they purchased a Maserati which they initially drove individually in different races. After a string of good results Emilio was signed to drive an Alfa Romeo for Scuderia Ferrari in the 1937 Grand Prix season.

Emilio Villoresi finished third behind teammates Giuseppe Farina and Clemente Biondetti at the 1937 Coppa Principessa di Piemonte and at the inaugural race at the &quot;Circuito della Superba&quot; in Genoa. In 1938, when the German Silver Arrows were dominating Grand Prix events, Villoresi managed to win the class competition at both the Coppa Ciano and the Italian Grand Prix. In May 1939, he finished a strong third to the still dominant Mercedes-Benz cars of Hermann Lang and Rudolf Caracciola at the Nürburgring. 

Villoresi&#x27;s career was cut short the following month when he suffered a fatal crash while testing an Alfa Romeo 158 Alfetta at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza.

<text>The Despot of Epirus was the ruler of the Despotate of Epirus, one of the rump states of the Byzantine Empire in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade. The name &quot;Despotate of Epirus&quot; and the title &quot;despot of Epirus&quot; are modern historiographical names, and were not in use by the despots themselves. In the Byzantine Empire, the title of despot () was a prestigious court title and did not designate rule over some specific territory. Though several of the early Greek rulers of the Epirote realm did use the title of despot, it was never in reference to the lands they governed, but instead in reference to their position in the imperial hierarchy.

It was only with Epirus falling into the hands of foreign dynasties that the title of despot became applied not to the imperial hierarchy, but to the territory, sometimes to the dismay of the local population. &quot;Despot of Epirus&quot; is not recorded in contemporary documents for the rulers of foreign origin, but several other versions are, such as &quot;despot of Arta&quot; and &quot;despot of Ioannina&quot;, the two capitals of the despotate at different points in time. Some rulers used the version &quot;despot of Romania&quot; (Romania essentially referring to the territories of the Roman Empire, i.e. Byzantium) or &quot;despot of the Romans&quot; (claiming rulership over the Romans, i.e. the Byzantines/Greeks).

The final despot of Epirus was Leonardo III Tocco, who ruled from 1448 to 1479, when the remnants of the despotate were conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Leonardo escaped into exile and his descendants continued to claim the title until 1642.

This occurred when Antonio Tocco petitioned the King of Spain to be granted the title of Prince of Achaea, in exchange for his patrimonial titles as Despot of Epirus and Count Palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos; this new grant mirrored the original princely title held by rulers of the Principality of Achaea, but was a noble title within the Neapolitan nobility, compared to the original sovereign title.

== Title ==
In the Late Byzantine Empire, the title of despot () was a prestigious and elevated court title. It was not used as a ruling title in regards to any specific landed possession. As such, referring to the rulers of the Despotate of Epirus (a non-contemporary term for the state) as &quot;Despots &quot;of&quot; Epirus&quot; is technically incorrect. The title only became associated with certain territories as the practice of emperors granting the title to princes and granting them semi-authonomous appanages to govern became regularized. Furthermore, not all rulers of Epirus bore the title. The founder of the Epirote realm, Michael I Komnenos Doukas, never used the title and neither did his successor Theodore Komnenos Doukas, who actually crowned himself emperor () at Thessalonica . The first ruler of Epirus to receive the title of despot was Michael II, from his uncle Manuel of Thessalonica in the 1230s, and then again, as a sign of submission and vassalage, from the Nicaean emperor John III Vatatzes.

Use of a version of the title despot actually associated with territory began under the rule of the Orsini family, following the extinction of the original Komnenos Doukas dynasty. Of Italian descent, the Orsini rulers rendered their title as (&quot;Despot of Romania&quot;). Epirus was a part of Romania (not meaning the modern country, but essentially &quot;the territories of the Roman Empire&quot;, i.e. Byzantium). Thomas II Preljubović, who was granted Epirus by its previous ruler, claimant Serbian emperor Simeon Uroš, was granted the dignity of despot by Simeon and titled himself as the &quot;Despot of Ioannina&quot; to designate his rule over his capital Ioannina and all of Epirus.

Upon becoming the ruler of Ioannina in 1411, Carlo I Tocco assumed the title of despot, either as a reference to the Komnenos Doukas and Orsini despots, or to the title assumed by Thomas II Preljubović. The locals insisted that Carlo seek recognition of that title from the Byzantine emperor, and after having sent his brother Leonardo to Constantinople, Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos formally recognized him as despot. To Carlo, the title of despot meant that he could claim rulership over all of Epirus, not just Ioannina; he notably captured Arta, capital under the Komnenos Doukas and Orsini, in 1416. To the Byzantines in Constantinople, the granting of the title served more to buffer the lack of actual imperial control in the region, only being a nominal reference to the power previously exercised in Epirus by Greek despots. From 1418 onwards, Carlo rendered his title in Latin as &quot;Despotus Romaniae&quot;, as the Orsini despots had done before him. This title had also been used by Centurione II Zaccaria, Prince of Achaea, and Carlo might have assumed it in 1418 not as a reference to previous rulers of Epirus, but essentially as a usurpation of Centurione&#x27;s (his former feudal overlord) title after the Prince of Achaea had suffered devastating losses of territory to the Byzantines in that same year. Epirote sources write that the title was confirmed by Manuel II, but contemporary Byzantine sources are silent on the matter. Documents from Ioannia and Arta give Carlo the full title (&quot;Lord Carlo, by the grace of God, Despot of Romania&quot;).

Carlo also sometimes used the version (&quot;Despot of the Romans&quot;, i.e. the Byzantines/Greeks) from 1418 onwards. This version of the title had even more dangerous implications for Constantinople, as it implied rulership over the Byzantine people themselves rather than territory they considered part of their empire. To the Byzantines, such power could only legally be exercised by the emperor. Carlo I&#x27;s successor, Carlo II Tocco, used the title &quot;Despot of Arta&quot;, which connected him to the old capital of the Epirote realm rather than to the territory of the Byzantine Empire at large. Even then, &quot;Despot of Arta&quot; was no more acceptable to the Byzantines than &quot;Despot of Romania&quot; as it was still in relation to a specific territory, rather than on the position of a despot relative to the emperor in court hierarchy. This title was also used by Carlo II&#x27;s successor, Leonardo III Tocco. Later members of the Tocco family, pretenders to the title, used both &quot;Despot of Romania&quot; and &quot;Despot of Arta&quot;; a 1697 Italian text titles the despots of the Tocco family as &quot;Despoti de Romanìa, &amp; del&#x27;Arta&quot; (&quot;Despots of Romania and of Arta&quot;).

== List of despots of Epirus, 1205–1479 ==

=== Komnenos Doukas dynasty (1205–1318) ===

=== Orsini dynasty, line of Maria Komnene Doukaina (1318–1359) ===

=== Nemanjić dynasty (1359–1385) ===

=== Buondelmonti dynasty (1385–1411) ===
=== Tocco dynasty (1411–1479) ===

== Titular despots of Epirus, 1479–1642 ==

With Antonio Tocco&#x27;s submission of the title along with the Palatine Comital title in 1642, the Tocco family ceased to use the title Despot of Epirus. Antonio&#x27;s male-line descendants instead began to use their new grant of Prince of Achaea within the Neapolitan nobility. The change in titulature might be attributable to the Tocchi being the most senior descendants of Thomas Palaiologos, Despot of the Morea, following the extinction of his last certain male-line descendants in the 16th century. Thomas Palaiologos had married the designated heiress of Centurione II Zaccaria, the Prince of Achaea, as per the Chalandritsa negotiations between the two rulers in 1429, and as such, had inherited the territories of the principality upon Centurione&#x27;s death in 1432.

<text>In the mathematical theory of knots, a pretzel link is a special kind of link. It consists of a finite number of tangles made of two intertwined circular helices. The tangles are connected cyclicly, and the first component of the first tangle is connected to the second component of the second tangle, the first component of the second tangle is connected to the second component of the third tangle, and so on. Finally, the first component of the last tangle is connected to the second component of the first. A pretzel link which is also a knot (that is, a link with one component) is a pretzel knot.

Each tangle is characterized by its number of twists: positive if they are counter-clockwise or left-handed, negative if clockwise or right-handed. In the standard projection of the formula_1 pretzel link, there are formula_2left-handed crossings in the first tangle, formula_3in the second, and, in general, formula_4in the nth.

A pretzel link can also be described as a Montesinos link with integer tangles.

==Some basic results==

The formula_5 pretzel link is a knot iff both formula_6 and all the formula_7 are odd or exactly one of the formula_7 is even.

The formula_1 pretzel link is split if at least two of the formula_7 are zero; but the converse is false.

The formula_11 pretzel link is the mirror image of the formula_1 pretzel link.

The formula_1 pretzel link is isotopic to the formula_14 pretzel link. Thus, too, the formula_1 pretzel link is isotopic to the formula_16 pretzel link.

The formula_17 pretzel link is isotopic to the formula_18 pretzel link. However, if one orients the links in a canonical way, then these two links have opposite orientations.

==Some examples==
The (1, 1, 1) pretzel knot is the (right-handed) trefoil; the (−1, −1, −1) pretzel knot is its mirror image.

The (5, −1, −1) pretzel knot is the stevedore knot (61).

If p, q, r are distinct odd integers greater than 1, then the (&quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot;, &quot;r&quot;) pretzel knot is a non-invertible knot.

The (2&quot;p&quot;, 2&quot;q&quot;, 2&quot;r&quot;) pretzel link is a link formed by three linked unknots.

The (−3, 0, −3) pretzel knot (square knot (mathematics)) is the connected sum of two trefoil knots.

The (0, q, 0) pretzel link is the split union of an unknot and another knot.

===Montesinos===

A Montesinos link is a special kind of link that generalizes pretzel links (a pretzel link can also be described as a Montesinos link with integer tangles). A Montesinos link which is also a knot (i.e., a link with one component) is a Montesinos knot.

A Montesinos link is composed of several rational tangles. One notation for a Montesinos link is formula_19.

In this notation, formula_20 and all the formula_21 and formula_22 are integers. The Montesinos link given by this notation consists of the sum of the rational tangles given by the integer formula_20 and the rational tangles formula_24

These knots and links are named after the Spanish topologist José María Montesinos Amilibia, who first introduced them in 1973.

==Utility==
(−2, 3, 2n + 1) pretzel links are especially useful in the study of 3-manifolds. Many results have been stated about the manifolds that result from Dehn surgery on the (−2,3,7) pretzel knot in particular.

The hyperbolic volume of the complement of the pretzel link is times Catalan&#x27;s constant, approximately 3.66. This pretzel link complement is one of two two-cusped hyperbolic manifolds with the minimum possible volume, the other being the complement of the Whitehead link.

While most of these crosses stand in cemeteries, some are erected as landmarks on mountains.

== Locations ==
In Germany there are several hundred &quot;Ostlandkreuze&quot;, most of which are located in cemeteries. The following list is restricted to the most prominent &quot;Ostlandkreuze&quot; erected on exposed locations.

=== Bad Harzburg ===

On 24 June 1950 a , wooden cross, the &quot;Kreuz des Deutschen Ostens&quot;, was dedicated on the &quot;Uhlenklippen&quot; crags near Bad Harzburg in the presence of Ernst Reuter. This cross stood for over 47 years before being blown down on 4 March 1998 during a hurricane.
On 30 September 2000 a new and , partly wooden-clad, steel cross was dedicated on the same spot. The construction cost came to 180,000 DM. Around the cross in a wide arc is a footpath on the outside of which are small rough-hewn stone monuments facing the cross; each one with a shield representing one of the former German provinces in Central Europe, east to its modern border. The cross is checkpoint no. 122 on the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network.

=== Geislingen ===
The Geislingen &quot;Ostlandkreuz&quot; is a memorial cross built in 1950 south of Geislingen, on the &quot;Schildwacht&quot; mountain. It remembers specifically the expulsions from the South Moravian Region in and around the towns of Znojmo, Mikulov, Nová Bystřice and Slavonice.

It is a steel framework construction covered with copper plates. Its height is 22.7m/74.5ft and it weighs 8.5 tons. The span of its arms is 7.5m/24.5ft. A landmark of Geislingen, the cross was renovated in 1992, further refurbished in 2003 and received a light installation for illumination at night.

=== Nordstemmen ===
The wooden &quot;Cross of the German East&quot; (&quot;Kreuz des deutschen Ostens&quot;) was erected in 1961 on the Bocksberg near the village of Heyersum. After being destroyed it was newly consecrated in 1990 and 2006.

=== Winterbach ===
The cross and an altar, both made of concrete, are located on the Hungerberg, a slope on the northern edge of the Rems valley between Winterbach and Schorndorf. 

Once a year around 5:30 am on Easter morning there is a service at this &quot;Ostlandkreuz&quot;.

&quot;Coordinates:&quot; 

=== Dülken ===
In the town of Dülken (Viersen district) a cross in memory of the war and German refugees was erected at the cemetery in 1951. It was restored in 2005.

<text>Martin Leopold Widhalm (October 2, 1722 – June 10, 1776) was an Austrian or German luthier known for his work in Nuremberg. Charles Beare considers Widhalm to have been the most significant maker of violins in Germany during the 18th century not to be based in Mittenwald, and praises the &quot;sharpness and good taste&quot; of his instruments.

Born in Horn, Austria, Widhalm worked on many old Bologna lutes that inspired his later work in his manufacture of lutes, violins and violoncellos in Nuremberg, Germany between 1746 and 1776. Widhalm moved permanently to Nuremberg in 1745 to work at the instrument-making shop of the late Sebastian Schelle (1676–1744) being run by his eldest daughter Barbara. Another source considers Widhalm to have been a student of Schelle. Widhalm and Barbara Schelle&#x27;s working relationship became personal and resulted in marriage the following year. However, a prolonged legal battle ensued with Leonhard Maussiell (1685–1760), who objected to Widhalm taking over the business. When legal matters finally ended, Leopold and Barbara Widhalm created the largest and most successful lute and violin manufacturing operation in Nuremberg, noted for their outstanding quality. According to Beare, Widhalm was influenced by Jacob Stainer. 

Following his death in 1776 and her death in 1781, their sons Martin Leopold Widhalm (1747–1806) and Gallus Ignatius Widhalm (1752–1822) took over from him and a grandson, Johann Martin Leopold Widhalm (1799–1855) too became involved in the business.

<doc id="1286145" wikidata="Q58091" url="?curid=1286145" title="Stavros Dimas">
<text>Stavros Dimas (, ; born 30 April 1941) is a Greek politician who was European Commissioner for the Environment from 2004 to 2009. From November 2011 to May 2012, he served in the government of Greece as Minister for Foreign Affairs. The New Democracy–PASOK coalition government nominated him for the post of President of Greece in December 2014, but he failed to achieve the necessary votes, forcing the dissolution of parliament.

==Early life and education==
Stavros Dimas was born in 1941 in the village of Klenia, Corinthia. Dimas studied law at the University of Athens and went on to earn a Master of Laws from New York University.

==Career==
In 1968 he began working as a lawyer for a firm on Wall Street, moving to the World Bank the following year, where he worked on investments in Africa and the Middle East. In 1975 he returned to Greece to take up the post of deputy governor of the Hellenic Industrial Development Bank (ETVA), while also being a member of the committee preparing Greek accession to the EEC.

===Entry into politics===
From 1977 he was active in Greek politics as a member of the conservative New Democracy party, being elected as an MP on the nationwide list. He was elected to the Greek parliament ten consecutive times that year.

He went on to hold a variety of ministerial and other political positions:

*Deputy Minister of Economic Coordination (28 November 1977 – 10 May 1980)
*Minister of Trade (10 May – 11 October 1980)
*Minister without Portfolio (11 October 1980 – 21 October 1981)
*Parliamentary spokesperson for the New Democracy party (October 1985 – June 1989)
*Minister of Agriculture (2 July – 12 October 1989)
*Minister of Agriculture (23 November 1989 – 13 February 1990)
*Minister of Industry, Energy and Technology (11 April 1990 – 29 July 1991)
*Secretary-General of New Democracy (1995–2000)
*Senior Member of the Political Analysis Steering Committee of New Democracy (2000–2003)
*Head of the New Democracy delegation to the Council of Europe (2000–2004)

===European Commission===
Dimas served briefly in the Prodi Commission. He was appointed European Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs in March 2004, taking over the role from the previous Greek Commissioner Anna Diamantopoulou. A major focus of his work during this time involved making it more difficult for states to opt out of the Working Time Directive. The Greek government nominated Dimas for the incoming Barroso Commission which took office on 22 November 2004.

In a speech to a committee of the European Parliament Dimas announced four main priorities for his term in office: climate change, biodiversity, public health, and sustainability. He emphasised the importance of the Kyoto Protocol, the Natura 2000 project, the REACH directive, and the need to better enforce existing EU environmental legislation.

====Selection hearing====
Concerns were raised in advance by MEPs and many NGOs that by appointing a former Wall Street lawyer and industry minister to the environment post the EU had signalled a decreased commitment to environmental issues in favour of promoting economic competitiveness. However, after some months time, the environment unions quickly endorsed his programme and publicly congratulated him for being able to support the positions of the environmental organizations with great success within the commission. Dimas&#x27; role was vital especially since the President, Mr Barroso, was ready to disregard the effects on the environment due to the need to improve economic development.

Questioned by the European Parliament, Dimas took the view that preserving the environment and promoting competitiveness went hand in hand, and that environmental policy could provide a stimulus for technological innovation. Among other statements, he said that GM residues in seeds should be the lowest technically feasible.

Following his hearing Dimas received a sceptical response from most MEPs. Many believed him to have insufficient experience to fulfill the role. Karl-Heinz Florenz, chair of the Environment Committee and a member of the conservative EPP-ED, said that European environment policy needed, &quot;more than just declarations of intention... If Commission President-designate Barroso puts the Lisbon Strategy on top of the agenda, this must not mean that the primacy of economic over environment policy gets cemented.&quot; However, he stressed the need to give Dimas time to &#x27;grow into&#x27; his role. The Socialists gave him a qualified approval but criticised his plans as too vague. The Greens and the left-wing GUE/NGL opposed his appointment outright, with the Greens naming him as one of the three &quot;incompetent&quot; Commissioners-designate who prompted them to vote against the commission as a whole. Representatives of industry and the business community welcomed his appointment to the environment post.

In a dramatic change of stance, the Greens endorsed the programme plan by Commissioner Dimas and have argued that their cooperation in environmental issues is harmonic.

====Stance on climate change====


Dimas led the EU in its tough line on climate change during the first weeks of the new Commission. At UN talks on climate change in Buenos Aires in December 2004 he attempted to negotiate a new system of mandatory emissions reductions to follow the expiration of the initial Kyoto targets in 2012. This approach met with fierce opposition from the U.S., representatives of which refused to even discuss the matter. The Italian environment minister Altero Matteoli broke EU ranks on the issue, proposing voluntary targets after 2012, and saying that it was, &quot;unthinkable to go ahead without the US, China and India.&quot;

In response to the refusal of countries to sign Kyoto, such as the United States and Australia (the latter of which exchanged viewpoints with the EU on the matter), the EU has been looking to tax products imported from those countries not taking low-carbon policies on board (Border Tax Adjustments).

When defending the commission&#x27;s new proposals to climate change in 2007, he claimed &quot;It is clear that the fight against climate change is much more than a battle. It is a world war that will last for many years.&quot;

Dimas oversaw the introduction of the EU&#x27;s emissions trading scheme, that took effect on 1 January 2005, despite emissions reduction plans from Poland, Italy, the Czech Republic and Greece not having been approved on time. He also sought to include companies operating aircraft under the emissions trading regime.

In February 2007 the Commissioner put forward his plans to increase fuel efficiency standards of cars so that emissions are no more than 130g of CO2 per km, down from 162g/km in 2005. This caused anger from the European car industry which was stoked by the Commissioner requesting a Japanese car, a Toyota Prius, instead of a European make due to the Toyota&#x27;s better environmental standards.

===Return to Greece===
In July 2010 the president of New Democracy Antonis Samaras appointed Stavros Dimas as vice-president of the party with responsibility for economic and social affairs. From 11 November 2011 to 17 May 2012 he served as Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Lucas Papademos interim cabinet.

On 9 December 2014, Prime Minister Samaras announced the candidacy of Dimas, jointly supported by New Democracy and PASOK, for the Presidency of Greece, which took place in three ballots on 17, 23 and 29 December. He failed to achieve the necessary votes, forcing the dissolution of parliament.

<text>In 1962, the U.S. Navy issued a requirement for a long-range high-precision air-to-surface missile. The missile, named the AGM-53A Condor, was to use a television guidance system with a data link to the launching aircraft similar to the system of the then projected AGM-62 Walleye.

==Development history==
Because of numerous problems in the development phase, the first flight of an XAGM-53A missile did not occur before March 1970.

On 4 February 1971, in its first live warhead test, a Condor made a direct hit on the ex-US navy destroyer escort , while tests later that year demonstrated the ability to hit targets at a range of . The AGM-53 program was cancelled in March 1976. Its long range and potentially high precision made the Condor a very powerful weapon, but it was much more expensive than contemporary tactical air-to-ground weapons. The secure data link contributed a significant portion to total missile cost, and it certainly didn&#x27;t help that this link was still somewhat unreliable.

==Description==

The Condor was to be a long-range missile to be used for high-precision stand-off attacks. The missile was launched by the strike aircraft from a distance of up to to the general target area. When the AGM-53 approached the expected target position, the image of the TV camera in the missile&#x27;s nose was transmitted back to the operator in the launching aircraft. The operator could switch between wide and narrow field-of-view images to find a suitable target.

As soon as a target for the missile had been selected, the operator could either fly the missile manually until impact, or lock the Condor on the target and rely on the missile&#x27;s capability to home on the final aiming point. The Condor&#x27;s linear shaped charge warhead detonated on impact.

A variant of the Condor was anticipated to carry the W73 nuclear warhead, a derivative of the B61 nuclear bomb. Details on the W73 are poorly documented, and it never entered production or service.

==Operators==

<text>Cascade Brewery is a brewery established in 1824 in South Hobart, Tasmania, and is the oldest continually operating brewery in Australia.

As well as beer, the site also produces a range of non-alcoholic products. It is home to a function centre, as well as operating tourism related ventures including guided tours and a retail outlet.

==History==
The Cascade estate was originally a saw milling operation, run by a partnership called Macintosh and Degraves Sawmills. The mills began operation in 1825 and the brewery was founded beside the Hobart Rivulet in 1832 by Hugh Macintosh (1776–1834) with his nephews Henry and Charles Degraves while Peter Degraves was in Hobart prison serving a five-year sentence.

Until 2011 the conventional history of Cascade Brewery held that the brewery, and the other enterprises at Cascade, had been founded by Peter Degraves. However research by historian Greg Jefferys for his Masters thesis showed that the major partner in the Cascade Mills and Brewery had actually been Major Hugh Macintosh and that Degraves had falsified the history of the brewery after Macintosh&#x27;s death in 1834.

Macintosh was a retired East India Company Officer who emigrated from England on his ship &quot;Hope&quot; in 1824 with his business partner Peter Degraves (1778–1852). Degraves was an undischarged bankrupt and a convicted thief. In 1826, charges were laid against Degraves for debts incurred in England, and he was taken into custody until 1832. As a result of Degraves&#x27; arrest, Macintosh dissolved the partnership, paid all of the partnership&#x27;s outstanding debts, and took over the running of the sawmills with his two nephews as well as expanding his farming interests near New Norfolk.

After his release in 1832, Peter Degraves took over running and expanding the brewery on the property owned by himself and Macintosh. Macintosh moved to his farm on the banks for the Derwent River where he pursued his interests in viticulture and Merino sheep.

During this period, Macintosh supported Henry Savery, who wrote Australia&#x27;s first novel. After Macintosh&#x27;s death in December 1834, his half-share of the Cascade estate passed to his son William Macintosh who lived in Madras, India. Degraves offered to buy William&#x27;s share but never paid his nephew, and William died a pauper in 1840, still owed a small fortune by his wealthy uncle Peter Degraves. After Macintosh&#x27;s death, Degraves continued to expand both the milling and brewing operations at the Cascade, exporting both timber and beer to mainland Australia, particularly to Victoria where the gold rush created huge demands for both timber and beer.

After Degraves&#x27; death, Cascade passed into the control of his eldest son, Henry Degraves. However, Henry Degraves died two years after his father and the management of the brewery passed to James Wilson, husband of Degraves&#x27; youngest daughter, Deborah Hope Degraves. Until 2020 it was owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev, through its Australian subsidiary Carlton &amp; United Breweries. 
Asahi Group Holdings, Ltd. completed an acquisition of Carlton &amp; United from InBev in June 2020 and is therefore now the ultimate owner of Cascade 
Cascade produces a range of beers, apple cider (&#x27;Mercury Cider&#x27; brand) and non-alcoholic beverages including apple juice, blackcurrant syrup and carbonated beverages.

In 1967 the building housing the brewery was almost completely destroyed by the bushfires that devastated south-east Tasmania. With a rebuild to commence in no time at all, the brewery was back up and running a mere three months later.

The image adopted for its label in 1987, H. C. Richter&#x27;s nineteenth-century illustration of the now extinct Tasmanian tiger (&quot;Thylacinus cynocephalus&quot;), is from Gould&#x27;s &quot;The Mammals of Australia&quot;.

Cascade is unique among Australian breweries and rare among breweries worldwide in that it operates its own maltings, producing malt for its mainstream beers (including Premium Lager and Pale Ale) from locally grown barley. Specialty malts for dark beers and the seasonal range are imported from mainland Australia and from overseas. The Cascade name is also given to the sporting event &#x27;The Cascade Cup&#x27;.

The Cascade Brewery is designated on the Tasmanian Heritage Register.

==Beers==
===Premium range===

* Cascade Premium Lager is an Australian-style lager, hopped with Australian &quot;Summer&quot; hops to give the beer a distinct spicy flavour. Alcohol Content: 4.5% Originally, 5.2%.
* Cascade Premium Light is a low-alcohol lager, which is currently the biggest selling light beer in Australia. Alcohol Content: 2.6%

Degrave&#x27;s Collection:

* Cascade Pale Ale, also known as &quot;green&quot; or simply &quot;Pale&quot;, is in fact an Australian-style lager, not an ale. The Pale Ale name has been used since the brewery was established and was originally an ale style beer. The Pale Ale has an excellent balance of the famous &quot;Pride of Ringwood&quot; Hop and Pale Malt giving the beer a fruity mid palette and spicy end palette. Alcohol Content: 5.0% (originally 5.2%)
* Cascade Stout is a stout beer, commonly drunk by an older audience. The Cascade Stout is brewed with a blend of different malts and grains including roasted barley, which gives the brew chocolate and coffee overtones. Alcohol Content: 5.8%
* Cascade Blonde is a premium lager beer brewed with a blend of barley and wheat malts, then hopped using the &quot;Cascade&quot; Hop to give a light bitterness. The wheat malt in this brew gives the beer a citrus like mid palette. Alcohol Content: 4.8%
* Cascade Pure was launched as &quot;Cascade Green&quot; Carbon Neutral Beer in March 2008. It is a low carbohydrate, preservative free beer. Cascade use accredited schemes to offset production emissions, and use vegetable inks on the label and a lightweight bottle. In 2008, it won the Tasmanian Premier&#x27;s Award for Climate Action. The name change to Cascade Pure took place in November 2010 and was an odd choice after only two years—rival Boags already offer a &quot;Pure&quot; beer. Cascade&#x27;s media release said the change was &quot;to reflect not only the environmental credentials of the 100 per cent carbon neutral beer and its great taste, neither of which will change, but also the quality of the local Tasmanian ingredients used in the brew with nothing artificial added&quot;. Alcohol content: 4.5%

This range was launched in September 2005, it consists of existing products with more focused marketing and labeling. There was a further major overhaul of the brand in 2010.

===Tasmanian range===

* Cascade Draught is a traditional full strength lager. It is Tasmania&#x27;s best selling beer on tap. In Tasmania it is the most commonly found Cascade product on tap (draught). Alcohol Content: 4.7%
* Cascade Lager, also known as &quot;blue&quot;, is a traditional full strength lager. This is Tasmania’s best selling caned and bottled beer. It has a cult following, particularly among uni students. Alcohol Content: 4.8%
* Cascade Bitter, also known as &quot;red&quot;, is a bitter lager. Alcohol Content: 4.4%
* Cascade Export Stout, is similar to the stout featured in the Degrave&#x27;s Collection however is brewed with a shorter maturation time and has a slightly stronger flavour. Alcohol Content: 5.8%

These beers are only available in Tasmania.

Seasonal &amp; limited edition beers:

Cascade has also produced an annual premium beer since 2002, &quot;First Harvest&quot;, which has an extremely limited production. &quot;First Harvest&quot; refers to the first yield of Tasmanian hops, in which the actual unkilned hops flowers are used for the brew. First Harvest, which is brewed to a different recipe every year, is brewed as an ale.

From 2003 until the launch of Degrave&#x27;s collection Cascade produced a range of seasonal beers:

* Cascade Summer Blonde now Cascade Blonde.
* Cascade Autumn Amber now Cascade Amber.
* Cascade Winter Warmer a dark wheat beer. Winter Warmer was available as a seasonal beer in Tasmania for at least 10 years, but only on tap at selected pubs.
* Cascade Spring Fest a Bavarian helles style lager.

===Homebrew range===
* Spicy Ghost Draught
* Golden Harvest Lager
* Imperial Voyage Pale Ale
* Chocolate Mahogany Porter

<doc id="1286163" wikidata="Q290680" url="?curid=1286163" title="ADT Inc.">
<text>ADT Inc., formerly The ADT Corporation, is an American security company that provides residential and small business electronic security, fire protection, and other related alarm monitoring services throughout the United States. The corporate head office is located in Boca Raton, Florida. In February 2016, the company was acquired by Apollo Global Management for $6.9billion in a leveraged buyout. In January 2018, the company went public on the New York Stock Exchange.

==History==
In 1863, Edward A. Calahan invented a stock ticker and formed the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company in 1867 to exploit the technology. Gold and Stock also developed a messenger system that sent instructions to and from the stock exchange floor. Three years later, the president of Gold and Stock Telegraph Company woke up to a burglar in his home, which inspired him to create a telegraph-based alert system. This system eventually connected 50 of his neighbors to a central station, where all the alert boxes were monitored. There were many small telegraph delivery companies in the United States in the 19th century.

In 1874, 57 district telegraph delivery companies affiliated and became American District Telegraph (ADT). With the increase in telephone usage in the late 19th century, ADT&#x27;s messenger business slowly declined in popularity. ADT tried branching out and developing their signaling business while still maintaining their telegraph business as their primary income source.

ADT incorporated into Western Union in 1901 and separated its messenger business from its main signaling business at that time. In 1909, Western Union and ADT came under the control of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). ADT began to expand into new areas, such as fire alarms and security alarms, between 1910 and 1930, but was kept separate from AT&amp;T&#x27;s Holmes alarm business. ADT became a publicly traded company in the 1960s.

In 1964, ADT was found to be a monopoly in restraint of trade. It was shown to provide almost 80% of the central station alarm service in the United States. In some cities, such as New York City and Memphis, Tennessee, they were the sole provider. They were also found to have forced competitors out of business by lowering prices below cost. They would charge national accounts very low prices in cities with competitors and much higher prices where no competition was available. ADT was forced to adopt a national price list, which could not be varied, to help establish central station competitors in cities without competition and to pay fines and triple damages to the federal government, customers, and local competitors.

In early 1987, the firm Hawley Goodall, owned by Michael Ashcroft, bought the Indianapolis-based Crime Control Inc., the fourth-largest company in the U.S. security market, for $50 million. Later in the year, it bought ADT and moved to Bermuda. This purchase transformed Hawley into the leading security services business in the United States and resulted in the majority of its revenues coming from the North American market. As a result of the acquisition, Hawley changed its name to ADT Limited and decided to refocus its business around security services. At the end of 1987, the company sold its North American-based facility services business to Denmark&#x27;s ISS A/S.

In 1997, ADT was purchased by Tyco International in a reverse takeover.

===Broadview acquisition===

In January 2010, Tyco acquired Broadview Security (formerly Brink&#x27;s Home Security), then ADT&#x27;s largest competitor, for $2billion. When the acquisition closed later that year, the Broadview name was discontinued, and Broadview&#x27;s operations were integrated into ADT.

===Separation from Tyco and Apollo ownership===
In September 2011, Tyco announced that it would split into three companies, ADT being one of the three. On October 1, 2012, ADT debuted as an independent public company and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (). In 2014, it acquired the Canadian company Reliance Protectron Security Services from Reliance Home Comfort for a total of Can$555million.

In February 2016, Apollo Global Management acquired ADT for nearly $7billion and merged it with another home security firm, Protection 1. The purchase price represented a premium of approximately 56 percent over ADT&#x27;s closing share price on February 12, 2016, and when combined with Protection 1, represented an aggregate transaction value of approximately $15billion. The company went public again in January 2018 and again on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ADT. As of 2023, Apollo still retains a majority share in ADT.

In April 2018, ADT acquired Aronson Security Group Inc. and Acme Security Systems as part of its commercial expansion plans.

In October 2019, Telus Corporation purchased all of ADT&#x27;s Canadian assets for $700 million. By September 2020, Telus had renamed ADT&#x27;s Canadian operations to Telus SmartHome Security.

In August 2020, Google announced that it would invest $450million in ADT in exchange for a 6.6% equity stake. The partnership will leverage ADT&#x27;s network of installers to sell and install Nest devices, and aim to integrate Google&#x27;s AI and Nest smart home devices into ADT&#x27;s services.

In November 2021, ADT announced an agreement to acquire Sunpro Solar, a residential rooftop solar power contractor, for $160million in cash plus approximately 77.8million shares of ADT common stock, implying a total enterprise value of approximately $825million. The company was rebranded as &quot;ADT Solar&quot; and operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of ADT. In January 24, 2024 ADT announced that due to financial difficulties they will be closing their solar division. 

In September 2022, State Farm announced that it would invest $1.2billion in ADT in exchange for a 15% equity stake, and that it would commit up to $300million to an &quot;opportunity fund&quot; to support ADT&#x27;s marketing, technology, and innovation. At the same time, Google separately announced it would commit a further $150 million into a &quot;success fund&quot; for ADT.

ADT completed divesting its commercial security, fire and life safety business unit to private equity firm GTCR for $1.6 billion in October 2023.

==Operations==
As of March 2019, ADT had nine monitoring centers and a network of more than 17,000 professionals, serving 6 million customers in over 200 locations throughout the United States.

== Controversies ==
On July 10, 2023, ADT disclosed that errors were identified in regards to their non-cash goodwill impairment losses associated with their Solar reporting unit and related tax impacts. These errors were identified during the third quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023. As a result, the company announced that their financial results for the third and fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 would be restated. Consequently, investors were negatively impacted as ADT&#x27;s stock price decreased during trading, the following day.

<doc id="1286167" wikidata="Q326450" url="?curid=1286167" title="Eduardo Chibás">
<text>Eduardo René Chibás Ribas (August 26, 1907 – August 16, 1951) was a Cuban politician who used radio to broadcast his political views to the public. He primarily denounced corruption and gangsterism rampant during the governments of Ramón Grau and Carlos Prío which preceded the Batista era. He believed corruption was the most important problem Cuba faced.

Born in Santiago de Cuba to Eduardo Justo Chibás Guerra and Gloria Ribas-Rocafull y Agramonte, Chibás&#x27; strong nationalism is considered to be an inspiration for the Cuban Revolution.

In 1947 he formed the Orthodox Party, a strongly anti-imperialist group, which had the goal of exposing government corruption and bringing about revolutionary change through constitutional means. Chibás lost the 1948 election for president, finishing in third place. He was an extremely strong critic of that election&#x27;s winner, Carlos Prío Socarrás. He was considered a favorite in the 1952 presidential election, but committed suicide a year before Fulgencio Batista seized control of the Cuban government.

== Politics ==

=== Early political career ===
Chíbas&#x27; political forays started at the University of Havana. After a trip to Europe in 1925, during which he met several other prominent activists, including Ramón Grau, Chíbas became involved in anti-Machado radical protest groups. In 1927, he helped found the Student Directorate, and was briefly jailed in 1931. Though Chibás was never formally involved in the radical ABC group, he ensured that the Directorate maintained close contact with the group, in hopes of &quot;enhancing the organization&#x27;s prestige.&quot; He moved to Washington, D.C. shortly after, where he learned the impact radio could have on individuals. However, he later denounced violence in favor of prudent politics. Chibás refused to join a political party for most of the 1930s. In 1938, though, he joined the Auténticos, supporting Grau.

=== Party involvement and radio activism ===
After the student directorate splintered following the election of Grau, and subsequent autonomy granted to the University of Havana, Chibás moved into mainstream politics. Chibás attacked the corruption he saw manifesting during the late 1940s. He criticized President Carlos Prío Socarrás for his economic policy, accusing him of compromising national sovereignty. Broadcasting to a nationwide audience every week, Chibas gave fiery speeches denouncing shady politics. By 1948, he was the leader of the Partido Ortodoxo and denounced his former friend Ramón Grau in a presidential run. Chibás took a pro-Cuba, strongly nationalistic stance throughout his campaign—dubbed a call for &quot;revolution&quot; by some of his contemporaries. However, he finished in third place. A few years later, though, his platform picked up steam. By 1951, Chibás ranked first among Cubans&#x27; voting preferences for the 1952 election (never held) Chibás died by suicide in 1951.

== Death ==
Later in his life, Chibás&#x27; claims of corruption against the Cuban government became increasingly reckless. In January 1951, he asserted that a public loan of 25 million pesos was an unnecessary levy that would be pocketed by the rich owners of sugar plantations. Later that year, Chibás tried to take on education minister Aureliano Sánchez Arango. He raised numerous allegations of embezzlement. He faced mounting pressure from the Cuban public when he was unable to offer definitive evidence that Sánchez Arango was corrupt. On August 5, 1951, Chibás walked into the Radiocentro CMQ Building in Havana, for his weekly radio broadcast. That day he had promised to furnish the evidence supporting his claim that Sánchez Arango was embezzling money. Instead, he talked about other topics, warned that Fulgencio Batista might attempt a military coup, and made a farewell statement. He shot himself in the stomach and groin three times shortly after his broadcast ended.

Chibás was initially expected to survive, but after eleven days of intensive care, he died in the hospital of his wounds. The whole country grieved his death. He is buried in Colón Cemetery, Havana. His funeral was attended by hundreds of thousands, and it has been speculated that he might have been a contender for the 1952 presidential elections. Batista took the government by force on March 10, 1952, less than 8 months after the death of Chibás.

== Comparisons to Fidel Castro ==
While locked in a prison cell in 1931, Chibás reportedly proclaimed: &quot;If I am going to die, I want my last words to be for the Cuban revolution. I am a revolutionary; I love my patria and have contempt for the current regime.&quot; Five years later, he declared &quot;If I die, it will be for the revolution&quot; to a taxi driver rushing him to the hospital. These sorts of radical nationalist sentiments have drawn comparisons between Castro and Chibás. Castro was undoubtedly familiar with Chibás&#x27; Orthodox Party, which pushed strong revolutionary ideals. There are numerous cases of rousing rhetoric from Castro that verify those assumptions. Before his attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953, Castro referenced Chibás, in front of a group of revolutionaries largely inspired by the outspoken leader. It was later revealed that Castro had carried a tape of Chibás&#x27; final broadcast into battle, and planned on broadcasting it over the airwaves upon victory. Castro also used some of Chibás&#x27; rhetorical technique in his well-chronicled &quot;History will absolve me&quot; defense in court. And finally, Castro gave a speech at Chibás&#x27; grave following his successful seizure of power:

&quot;Today is like a culmination of the whole story, the story of the revolution and the events of 26 July, which are so closely linked with the tale of this tomb, with the memory of the man who lies here, with his ideology, feelings and preaching, because I should say here that without the preaching of Chibás, without what he did, without the civic conscience and rebellion he awakened in the Cuban young people, the events of 26 July would not have been possible.&quot;

Scholars have contrasting opinions as to how friendly the two were in life. In 1948, Castro traveled with Chibás for campaign rallies and political events, and introduced him regularly. Yet some have argued that the two disliked and mistrusted each other. However they interacted in life, Castro leveraged Chibás as a symbol in death—and an example to his revolution.

Some scholars have also pointed out that both leaders were united in their use of technological media to connect to people. Chibás utilized the power of radio to reach his supporters, speaking weekly from the Radiocentro CMQ Building in Havana. Castro would later do the same, but using the television.

The leaders clashed in terms of politics. Castro&#x27;s embracement of communism directly conflicted with Chibás&#x27; outspoken disdain for such a system. Over time, Castro referenced Chibás less, and eventually cancelled the annual parade on the anniversary of his death.

== Legacy ==
Chibás&#x27; legend grew after his death. Approximately 300,000 people attended his funeral procession, and one co-founding member of the Ortodoxo party &quot;appeared early each morning to wash the marble sepulcher, prune flowers left by devotees, and sweep the surrounding area.&quot; Fidel Castro had a statue erected of the leader in Santiago de Cuba. A nine-point document, the &quot;Moncada Manifesto&quot;, was circulated following his death, issuing a series of steps for overthrowing the Batista government—based on Chibás&#x27; principles, and referencing him by name.

Chibás&#x27; memory continued to expand during the decade following the Cuban Revolution. Though he was a staunch anti-communist, he came to symbolize revolutionary ideals rather than democratic politics. Batista expressed fear of the lasting symbol of Chibás, writing that &quot;the reformer and demagogue now appeared to the people as a martyr and this gave a prestige to his party.&quot; Castro leveraged that martyrdom in his 26 July Movement, often using his revolutionary rhetoric as a means of inspiring the Ortodoxos left behind with Chibás&#x27; death.

Over time, the importance of Chibás as a symbol began to wane. Some scholars have connected the downfall with Castro&#x27;s embrace of communism, citing the likelihood that it would have clashed with Chibás&#x27; politics. Furthermore, some point out that the revolution found a more appropriate martyr in Che Guevara.

<text>Miguel Corte-Real (;  – 1502?) was a Portuguese explorer who charted about 600 miles of the coast of Labrador. In 1502, he disappeared while on an expedition and was believed to be lost at sea.

==Early life==
Miguel Corte-Real was a son of João Vaz Corte-Real and a brother of explorer Gaspar Corte-Real, members of the Corte-Real family.

==Exploration==
In 1500, Miguel&#x27;s brother Gaspar reached Greenland, believing it to be Asia, but was unable to land. The following year, Gaspar sailed west again, this time making landfall at what is believed to have been Newfoundland. Only two of the three ships of the 1501 expedition returned to Portugal; the third ship, carrying Gaspar, was lost. Miguel invested significant sums of money into these two expeditions, and in return, Gaspar promised him a share of any new lands he claimed.

In May 1502, Miguel set out from Lisbon with three ships on an expedition to search for his brother. The expedition apparently reached the location where Gaspar&#x27;s party had landed, at which point the three ships broke off in different directions to search. Later, the ship carrying Miguel failed to appear at a designated rendezvous on August 20. The other two ships made the return voyage to Portugal, while Miguel and his ship were never seen again. 

In 1503, the last surviving brother, Vasco Añes Corte-Real, planned another rescue expedition for his two brothers. King Manuel I furnished two ships, but would not permit Vasco himself to sail with them. The expedition returned in the fall without having found any trace of either brother.

==Dighton Rock myth==
In 1912 and 1928 Edmund B. Delabarre wrote that markings on the Dighton Rock in Massachusetts suggest that Miguel Corte-Real reached New England. Delabarre stated that the markings were abbreviated Latin, and the message, translated into English, read as follows: &quot; I, Miguel Cortereal, 1511. In this place, by the will of God, I became a chief of the Indians&quot;. Samuel Eliot Morison dismissed this evidence in his 1971 book &quot;The European Discovery of America: The Northern Voyages&quot;. More recent scholarship by Douglas Hunter has definitively debunked the Corte-Real origin myth.

<doc id="1286190" wikidata="Q422930" url="?curid=1286190" title="Lithium chloride">
<text>Lithium chloride is a chemical compound with the formula LiCl. The salt is a typical ionic compound (with certain covalent characteristics), although the small size of the Li+ ion gives rise to properties not seen for other alkali metal chlorides, such as extraordinary solubility in polar solvents (83.05 g/100 mL of water at 20 °C) and its hygroscopic properties.

==Chemical properties==

The salt forms crystalline hydrates, unlike the other alkali metal chlorides. Mono-, tri-, and pentahydrates are known. The anhydrous salt can be regenerated by heating the hydrates. LiCl also absorbs up to four equivalents of ammonia/mol. As with any other ionic chloride, solutions of lithium chloride can serve as a source of chloride ion, e.g., forming a precipitate upon treatment with silver nitrate:
: LiCl + AgNO3 → AgCl + LiNO3

==Preparation==
Lithium chloride is produced by treatment of lithium carbonate with hydrochloric acid. Anhydrous LiCl is prepared from the hydrate by heating in a stream of hydrogen chloride.

==Uses==
===Commercial applications===
Lithium chloride is mainly used for the production of lithium metal by electrolysis of a LiCl/KCl melt at . LiCl is also used as a brazing flux for aluminium in automobile parts. It is used as a desiccant for drying air streams. In more specialized applications, lithium chloride finds some use in organic synthesis, e.g., as an additive in the Stille reaction. Also, in biochemical applications, it can be used to precipitate RNA from cellular extracts.

Lithium chloride is also used as a flame colorant to produce dark red flames.

===Niche uses===
Lithium chloride is used as a relative humidity standard in the calibration of hygrometers. At a saturated solution (45.8%) of the salt will yield an equilibrium relative humidity of 11.30%. Additionally, lithium chloride can be used as a hygrometer. This deliquescent salt forms a self-solution when exposed to air. The equilibrium LiCl concentration in the resulting solution is directly related to the relative humidity of the air. The percent relative humidity at can be estimated, with minimal error in the range , from the following first-order equation: RH=107.93-2.11C, where C is solution LiCl concentration, percent by mass.

Molten LiCl is used for the preparation of carbon nanotubes, graphene and lithium niobate.

Lithium chloride has been shown to have strong acaricidal properties, being effective against &quot;Varroa destructor&quot; in populations of honey bees.

Lithium chloride is used as an aversive agent in lab animals to study conditioned place preference and aversion.

==Precautions==
Lithium salts affect the central nervous system in a variety of ways. While the citrate, carbonate, and orotate salts are currently used to treat bipolar disorder, other lithium salts including the chloride were used in the past. For a short time in the 1940s lithium chloride was manufactured as a salt substitute for people with hypertension, but this was prohibited after the toxic effects of the compound (tremors, fatigue, nausea) were recognized. It was, however, noted by J. H. Talbott that many symptoms attributed to lithium chloride toxicity may have also been attributable to sodium chloride deficiency, to the diuretics often administered to patients who were given lithium chloride, or to the patients&#x27; underlying conditions.

<doc id="1286196" wikidata="Q3111397" url="?curid=1286196" title="Judson Memorial Church">
<text>The Judson Memorial Church is located on Washington Square South between Thompson Street and Sullivan Street, near Gould Plaza, opposite Washington Square Park, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of the New York City borough of Manhattan. It is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA, the Alliance of Baptists, and with the United Church of Christ.

The church sanctuary, its campanile tower and the attached Judson Hall were designated landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1966, and were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

==History==

===Founding===
By the mid-19th century, the village had the largest African-American community in the city, along with joined German, French and Irish immigrants, and to the immediate south a majority of Italian immigrants. Earlier more affluent communities had begun an exodus from the adjacent neighborhoods to the south and east. Judson observed that the &quot;tendency is for the intelligent, well-to-do and church-going people to withdraw from this part of the city&quot;. The park and the new church stood at the intersection between the affluence of Fifth Avenue and the poverty of Lower Manhattan.

The church was founded by Edward Judson who had been preaching at the Berean Baptist Church on Downing Street, also in the village, but his efforts at expanding the congregation were so successful that a new sanctuary was required. In 1888, with the backing of John D. Rockefeller and other prominent Baptists, construction of a new church south of the park was begun. Judson had chosen the location because he wanted to reach out to the neighboring communities. It was to be a memorial to Judson&#x27;s father, Adoniram Judson, one of the first Protestant missionaries to Burma. The church building was designed by architect Stanford White, with stained glass windows by John La Farge. It features Renaissance influences wedded to a basic Italianate form. Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens designed a marble frieze in the baptistery, which was carried out by Herbert Adams; it was completed in 1893.

As well as worship and religious education, the church offered health-care and outreach ministries to non-members as well as members. However, the church was not able to attract sufficient support from its wealthy neighbors on the north side of square, and by 1912, the church found itself in financial difficulties. The Baptist City Society (metropolitan association of Baptist churches) was persuaded to take over the property and financial responsibility, which it ended up holding until the congregation was again able to resume ownership and control in 1973.

===Early 20th century===
In 1921, under the leadership of its pastor, A. Ray Petty, the church offered first its basement and then rented its parish house on Thompson Street to Dr. Eleanor A. Campbell, a pioneering female physician who ran the Judson Health Center, a free medical and dental clinic. The center operated at 237 Thompson Street from 1922 to 1950, when the clinic moved to its present location on Spring Street in SoHo, the neighborhood to the south. During the 1920s, the church, with aid from the national American Baptist denomination, also ran the Judson Neighborhood House, a settlement house, at 179 Sullivan Street.

During the Great Depression in the early 20th century, Laurence Hosie served as pastor. Although the congregation dwindled, the church remained active in various social causes, including allowing homeless men to sleep on the pews at times. In 1937, the Baptist City Society appointed Renato Giacomelli Alden as pastor.

After World War II, with the rush of new students the former parish house and health center was turned into a residence for international students and students of various races, led by Dean R. Wright, the Baptist chaplain to New York University, the church&#x27;s neighbor. At the same time, a new pastor, Robert Spike, began theological explorations with veterans and the artists then working in the village, which brought a new group of congregants and led to a change in the church&#x27;s worship style to a more modern sensibility.

===Late 20th century===
In 1956, Howard Moody became the senior minister, continuing the church&#x27;s outspoken advocacy on issues of civil rights and free expression, as well as breaking with the confessedly evangelical understandings of the past by speaking out for issues once universally considered to be immoral by Christians (such as abortion and the decriminalization of prostitution), a policy that continues under the present leadership of the congregation. Al Carmines, the associate pastor 1962 to 1979, focused his ministry on the arts &quot;(see below)&quot;. The congregation expanded during this period, allowing the church to take back control of its property from the citywide Baptist organization that had been acting as trustee until 1973. Following Moody&#x27;s retirement in 1990, Peter Laarman became senior pastor. Coming from a background in union organizing, Laarman led the church into ministries dealing with economic issues, while continuing work with the arts and other social issues, and starting a multi-year program of restoration and renovation of the church&#x27;s aging buildings.

Since becoming senior minister in 2005, senior pastor Donna Schaper has created a pioneering program to train future clergy in how to do &quot;public ministry&quot; from a congregational base, by providing part-time apprenticeships to seminarians and recent graduates. Also under her leadership, the church has taken a leadership role in the New Sanctuary Movement for immigrant rights.

==Mission==

The church&#x27;s mission has long been self-described as being devoted to social outreach, and establishing programs designed to help those perceived to be in need, despite the controversial or sometimes, unpopular, nature of that help.

In the 1950s, the church was the first institution in the village to create a counseling program for drug addicts; in the 1960s, it led in helping to found the Clergy Consultation Service on Abortion, a nationwide network of Protestant and Jewish clergy who aided women who needed abortions before abortion became legal. In the 1970s, the church operated a residence for runaway teens and established a Professional Women&#x27;s Clinic for women engaged in prostitution; in the 1980s, it helped provide medical resources for people with AIDS.

In the first decade of the 21st century, the church&#x27;s clergy operated a relief fund for the families of restaurant workers who were killed during the September 11, 2001, attacks of New York City&#x27;s World Trade Center. Now, the church is active in the New Sanctuary Movement for immigrant rights.

===Early community outreach===
Verne E. Henderson joined the Judson staff in 1952 as its first Director of Community Service. A program for youth of the village – started originally by the Police Athletic League of New York City – blossomed under Henderson&#x27;s leadership with more than two hundred youth attending one or more weekly events. Many youth were hard-core delinquents and drug users. Henderson appeared in courts on behalf of those facing legal action and began summer youth programs in upstate New York and Vermont. Henderson also inaugurated programs for local artists, remodeling the sanctuary for art shows and refurbishing abandoned offices as living quarters for resident artists. Henderson once invited Martha Graham to use the sanctuary for dress rehearsals, which eventually led to formation of the Judson Dance Theatre.

==Sponsorship of the arts==
Beginning in the 1950s, the church supported a radical arts ministry, first led by associate pastor Bernard Scott and subsequently by associate pastor Al Carmines. The church made space available to artists for art exhibitions, rehearsals, and performances. The church also assured that this space was to be a place where these artists could have the freedom to experiment in their work without fear of censorship. In 1957, the church offered gallery space to Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine and Robert Rauschenberg, who were then unknown artists. In 1959, the Judson Gallery showed work by pop artists, Tom Wesselmann, Daniel Spoerri, and Red Grooms. Yoko Ono also had her work exhibited at the gallery. The gallery space housed Fluxus happenings, including &quot;Some Manipulations&quot; (1969), a series of performances at the Judson Church by Fluxus artists Jean Toche, Steve Young, Nam June Paik, and Al Hansen, and work by Nye Ffarrabas.

The Judson Dance Theater, which began in 1962, provided a venue for dancers and choreographers including Trisha Brown, Lucinda Childs, Steve Paxton, Deborah Hay, David Gordon and Yvonne Rainer to create and show their work. Among others, these dancers and choreographers shaped dance history by creating postmodern dance, the first avant-garde movement in dance theater since the modern dance of the 1930s and 1940s. For the past several decades, Movement Research has presented concerts of experimental dance at the church on Monday evenings during the academic year. The Judson Church commissioned enamel artist Paul Hultberg to produce the doors to the theater. 

In the 1970s, the church hosted various art shows and multimedia events. Most notable among these multimedia events was the People&#x27;s Flag Show in November 1970, a six-day exhibition of painting and sculpture on the theme of the American flag. The exhibit and the accompanying symposium, featuring speeches by Abbie Hoffman and Kate Millett, attracted widespread attention from the public, the press and the police. During the final days of the exhibit, three of the contributing artists were arrested, both pastors (Moody and Carmines) were issued summons (not followed up), and the District Attorney closed the exhibit on charges of desecration of the American flag.

The Judson Poets&#x27; Theatre started in November 1961 – with a play by poet Joel Oppenheimer – as one of three off-off-Broadway venues (the others were Caffe Cino and La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club). Experimental plays and musicals by later-famous authors and directors, including Sam Shepherd, Lanford Wilson and Tom O&#x27;Horgan, were presented in the church&#x27;s main Meeting Room. Starting in the late 1960s, Carmines began writing and producing his own musicals, and later, &quot;oratorios&quot; that used large volunteer choruses. Especially notable were several shows using texts by Gertrude Stein, music by Carmines, with direction by the Judson Poets Theatre director Lawrence Kornfeld.

In the 1980s, the church sponsored various Politically intended dramatic performances, such as those by the Vermont-based Bread and Puppet Theater. These performances included &quot;Insurrection Opera&quot; and &quot;Oratorio&quot;, performed in February and March 1984. In this performance, the Bread and Puppet Theater, under the direction of its founder, Peter Schumann, used opera and the company&#x27;s now signature oversized puppets to convey an anti-nuclear message. The church has recently become the home of the West Village Chorale, directed by Dr. Colin Britt. The Chorale&#x27;s former home was St. Luke&#x27;s in the Fields on Hudson Street.

The church celebrated its centennial in 1990 with performances and symposia involving many of the artists who had been involved with the arts ministry in the 1960s and 1970s. It continues both its support of the arts and its social outreach to the community.

==Building==
The church building is located at 54–57 Washington Square South. In addition to La Farge&#x27;s stained-glass windows and Saint-Gaudens&#x27;s marble frieze, it features Italian Renaissance influences wedded to a basic Italianate form, and has notable examples of scagliola, a very convincing handcrafted imitation of marble made of highly polished pigmented plaster. Overall, the exterior and shape of the building is said to resemble the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, Italy, while the entrance is said to be inspired by the Renaissance church San Alessandro, built in Lucca, Italy, in 1480. The fourteen stained glass windows in the church&#x27;s main sanctuary are the largest collection of major LaFarge windows in any one place in the U.S.

The campanile tower, located at 51–54 Washington Square South to the west of the church itself, was built in 1895–96, after the sanctuary had been completed, and was designed by the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White. The adjacent Hall, however, predates the church, having been built in 1877, and was designed by John G. Prague.

In 1999, facing financial difficulties, the church&#x27;s board of trustees sold the Judson House, the parish building behind the church, to New York University School of Law, which used the site for its new Furman Hall. At eleven stories tall, the new building now towers over the church and Washington Square Park beyond, causing considerable controversy in the community at the time of its construction. The church&#x27;s offices and a small assembly hall now occupy a condominium suite in one corner of the new building, adjacent to the main church, at 239 Thompson Street.

From 1990 to 2006, the church building was repainted, reroofed; the stained glass windows were cleaned and reinstalled by Cummings Studio; an elevator was installed to make the building accessible and air conditioning was added. These projects exhausted all the proceeds from the sale of the back lots, plus approximately $1 million additional (equivalent to  million in ), raised from contributions of arts patrons and the congregation.

<doc id="1286197" wikidata="Q7712183" url="?curid=1286197" title="Academy and College of Philadelphia">
<text>The Academy and College of Philadelphia (1749–1791) was a boys&#x27; school and men&#x27;s college in Philadelphia in the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania.

Founded in 1749 by a group of local notables that included Benjamin Franklin, the Academy of Philadelphia began as a private secondary school, occupying a former religious school building at the southwest corner of 4th and Arch Streets. The academy taught reading, writing, and arithmetic to both paying and charity students. The College of Philadelphia was founded in 1755, when the academy&#x27;s charter was amended to allow the granting of advanced academic degrees. The Medical School of the College of Philadelphia, founded in 1765, was the first medical school in North America.

In 1791, the College of Philadelphia merged with the University of the State of Pennsylvania, to form the present-day [[University of Pennsylvania]].

==History==
Benjamin Franklin was the first president of the board of trustees and authored the constitution for the academy, which was notable for its emphasis on modern languages and science in place of Latin and Greek. The academy opened for the secondary schooling of boys on August 13, 1751, with a charity school opening shortly afterwards.

The building that housed the academy had originally been set up in 1740 as a charity school supporting the ministry of George Whitefield with a hall for him to preach in, although Franklin, who had a hand in it, made sure its use was wider:
The college was granted a charter in 1755 and William Smith became its provost in 1756. The school graduated its first class of seven men on May 17, 1757, six with Bachelor of Arts degrees and one with a Master of Arts.

In 1765, physicians John Morgan and William Shippen, Sr. founded the Medical School of the College of Philadelphia, the first medical school in North America. That same year the first dormitory was built.

The college educated many of the future leaders of the United States. Twenty-one members of the Continental Congress were graduates of the school, and nine signers of the Declaration of Independence were either alumni or trustees of the university. Five signers of the Constitution received undergraduate or honorary degrees from the university, and another five were trustees. Some of the soldiers who took part of the Siege of Charleston were also alumnae of the college, including Archibald Thomas.

Despite this record, at the time of the American Revolution, the trustees were seen as Loyalist sympathizers. Thomas Coombe, Jr., who had been a valedictorian, fled to England once the British army arrived in the colonies. 

When the revolutionary government of Pennsylvania regained control of the city of Philadelphia after the British occupation of 1777–78, it rechartered the institution as the &quot;University of the State of Pennsylvania&quot;, appointed new trustees, and dismissed Smith as provost. 

Following repeated lawsuits by Smith and the original trustees, the state restored the college&#x27;s charter in 1789, but the university continued to operate on the original campus. In 1791, the two competing institutions merged, forming the University of Pennsylvania.

<text>Shaaban bin Robert, also known as Shaaban Robert (1 January 1909 – 20 June 1962), was a Tanzanian poet, author, and essayist who supported the preservation of Tanzanian verse traditions. Robert is celebrated as one of the greatest Tanzanian Swahili thinkers, intellectuals and writers in East Africa and has been called &quot;poet laureate of Swahili&quot; and is also known as the &quot;Father of Swahili.&quot; He is also honoured as the national poet.

==Biography==
Shaaban was born to a father of Yao decent and mother of Digo heritage at village of Vibamba, Tangasisi ward of Tanga District, located south of Tanga City in Tanga Region, Tanzania (then German East Africa). The surname Robert is a name of a British colonial officer who requested his parent to name him after him. Thus in real sense, Robert was his second name (not his surname or last name), his first name being Shaaban. Shaaban himself for a time wrote it &#x27;Roberts&#x27; rather than &#x27;Robert&#x27;. From 1922 to 1926 he was educated in Dar es Salaam, coming in second in a class of 11 to receive the School Leaving Certificate under the then British colonial educational system in Tanganyika.

===Career===
After receiving the school certificate, Shaaban worked at various posts as a colonial government civil servant. From 1926 to 1944 he was a customs official at different locations throughout the territory including one post at Kwale Island in current day Mkuranga District of Pwani Region. From 1944 to 1946 he worked for the Game Department. From 1946 to 1952 he worked in the Tanga District Office, and from 1952 to 1960 he was in the Survey Office there. He worked very closely with the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) and Julius Nyerere. Many of his civil service experiences are woven into his writings. During his lifetime he received the Margaret Wrong Prize and Medal for African Literature and was honored by the British government as a Member of the Order of the British Empire (M.B.E.).

==Intellectual work==
Robert contributed to the promotion of the Swahili language and the struggle for the dignity of mankind. He was a celebrated humanist. He worked for freedom and gender equality, and was against racial and religious discrimination in Tanzania. Tanzania&#x27;s first president, Julius Nyerere, had complete admiration for the late Shaaban Robert, and greatly valued and promoted his intellectual work. His was also equally respectful of both Muslims and Christians. That is reflected in his two unusual names (Shaaban—Muslim name and Robert, a Christian name).[The name Robert was in fact one of his father&#x27;s several names, the others being Selemani and Ufukwe]

Sheikh Shaaban Robert succeeded in writing essays, books, prose and poems and some of his literature is part of school curricula and higher education reading. Some of his books included &quot;Maisha Yangu na Baada ya Miaka Hamsini&quot;, &quot;Kusadikika&quot;, and &quot;Wasifu wa Siti binti Saad&quot;. His works are still being discovered and published. To date he has 24 known works.

<text>The Dudelange Radio Tower is a 285-meter (935 ft) high freestanding steel framework FM radio and television transmission tower, also called a lattice tower, with a triangular cross section located near Dudelange in Luxembourg. When completed in 1957 the Dudelange Radio Tower was the tallest structure in Luxembourg and the fourth tallest lattice tower in the world after the Tokyo, Eiffel and KCTV towers. It remains the tallest freestanding structure in Luxembourg today and the 5th tallest structure overall in the country.

==Plane Crash==
On 31 July 1981, a Belgian (Mirage IIIE) military aircraft crashed into the tower at mid-height, tearing down the upper section of the tower. The pilot did not survive the crash, additionally debris from the tower also fell on a nearby house and tragically killed two broadcast engineers who lived there. The tower was reconstructed the following year.

<text>Richvale (also, Richland, Silbys Switch, Silsby) is a small census-designated place (population 244) in Butte County, California, US, south of Chico and west of Oroville. The primary crop grown in the area surrounding Richvale is rice, irrigated from the Oroville Dam on the Feather River. Several farmers in the area are known for organic farming. The population was 244 at the 2010 census.

Richvale is located at 39° 29&#x27; 38&quot; North, 121° 44&#x27; 41&quot; West, above sea level.

The ZIP Code is 95974. The community is inside area code 530.

== History ==
Legend says that the name &quot;Richvale&quot; (meaning &quot;fertile valley&quot;) was coined by con men to sell worthless plots of land to wheat farmers from Nebraska and Kansas. The developers (Richvale Land Company) changed the name from Selby Switch (a railroad siding) to Richvale in 1909. The place was settled in 1911, and a post office opened that same year.

Farmers in the Midwest were shown lush pictures of California&#x27;s Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley and sold land at outrageous prices. The soil near Richvale is nothing like the fertile soil of the San Joaquin Valley, being composed mostly of clay instead of loam. The dominant soil is Esquon clay, a poorly drained vertisol. The locals call the soil &quot;adobe&quot; due to its high clay content. The land is unsuitable for vineyards, orchards, and most other crops. Some buyers took one look at the soil and returned to the Midwest. Those who stayed built a community from the muddy ground up: a post office (1912), roads, an irrigation and drainage district, a hotel (1913), a church (1913), a cooperative (1914 and still operating, the Butte County Rice Growers Association), a school (1914), and a grocery store (1920). During a second wave of migration Dust Bowl farmers came west during the Great Depression.

Due to the adobe soil&#x27;s ability to retain water and remain flooded, the ground makes a near-ideal rice paddy, and rice has become the primary crop of the area. Irrigation is provided by plentiful surface water from the Feather River.

In 2005, of rice were served by the Butte County Rice Growers Association. Current storage capacity is . With time and a lot of hard work, the town of Richvale lived up to its name as rice farming provided an abundant livelihood for the original settlers and their offspring.

The history of Richvale was recently written by the Richvale Writing Group (with Teresa Ward) and published by The Community Foundation of Richvale in a book (Richvale: A Legacy of Courage, Dedication, and Perseverance) with 364 historical photographs.

<text>The World Islands (Arabic: جزر العالم; &quot;Juzur al-Ālam&quot;) are an archipelago of small artificial islands constructed in the shape of a world map, located in the Persian Gulf, off the coast of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The World Islands are composed mainly of sand dredged from Dubai&#x27;s shallow coastal waters and are one of several artificial island developments in the emirate. The World&#x27;s developer is Nakheel Properties, and the project was originally conceived by Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. Construction was done by two Dutch joint-venture specialist companies, Van Oord and Boskalis, who also created the Palm Jumeirah.

Construction of the 300 islands began in 2003, before being halted due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Though 60% of the islands were sold to private contractors in 2008, development on most of the project has not started. As of July 2012, Lebanon Island was completed and was the only island that had so far been developed commercially, being used for private corporate events and public parties. As of late 2013, only two of the islands had been developed. In January 2014, Kleindienst Group announced the launch of &quot;the Heart of Europe&quot; project. By February 2014, JK Properties, one of Kleindienst Group&#x27;s brands, announced that the project was &quot;well underway&quot;. The first of these series of islands will be Europe, Sweden, and Germany, with development led by Kleindienst Group.

==The World Project==
Islands in the project range from in area. Distances between islands average ; they are constructed from 321 million cubic metres of sand and 386 million tons of rock. Designed by Creative Kingdom Dubai, the development is an area that covers and is surrounded by an oval-shaped breakwater island. Roughly of shoreline has been created. The World&#x27;s overall development costs were estimated at $13 billion CAD in 2005.

The archipelago consists of seven sets of islands, representing the continents of Europe, Africa, Asia, North America, South America, Antarctica, and Oceania. Each artificial island is named after its representative country, landmark, or region, such as France, California, Rio de Janeiro, Mount Everest, Australia, New Mexico, Upernavik, Buenos Aires, New York, Mexico, Saint Petersburg, São Paulo, and India.

==History==
The project was unveiled in May 2003 by Al Maktoum, and dredging began four months later. By January 2008, 60% of the islands were sold, with 20 being bought in the first four months of 2007. On 10 January 2008, the final stone on the breakwater was laid, completing development of the archipelago. As of July 2012, a second island, the Lebanon Island (1.5 hectares, or 3.7 acres and 482.21 metres of perimeter) was developed and was &#x27;the only island that has so far been developed commercially, is used for private corporate events and public parties&#x27;.

===Difficulties===
&quot;The Times&quot; reported in September 2009 that work on the World had been suspended due to the effects of the global financial crisis.
Nakheel denied 2010 reports that the islands were sinking into the sea as wholly inaccurate. Despite the denial, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported in January 2011 that an independent company, Penguin Marine, provided verification on the erosion of the islands and the silting of the passageways between the islands. Due to financial and technical problems, Penguin Marine, contracted to provide transportation to the archipelago, attempted to get out of the annual fees of $1.6 million paid to Nakheel properties.

Until early 2012, only one of the islands had been occupied by a building (a show home), and commercial or residential properties were not being constructed on any of the other islands. Property prices in the Emirates had fallen 58% from their peak in the fourth quarter of 2008. The world economic recovery from the Great Recession resulted in a rebound for the Dubai real estate market: it was reported that &quot;residential prices [in Dubai] rose by 17.9% from August 2012 to 2013, while rents soared by 14.9% in the same period&quot;.

===Purchase and development plans===
The World was supposed to be serviced by four major transportation hubs linked by waterways. Land parcels were supposedly zoned for various uses: estate, mid-density, high density, resorts, and commercial.

The plan was for utilities to be routed underwater, with pumping stations at each of the hubs pumping fresh water to the islands. Power was to be supplied by the Dubai grid and distributed through underwater cables. However, as of February 2015, no cables had been laid, and developers had to provide their own power using diesel generators. Wastewater and refuse systems are an individual concern for each island.

Nakheel Group is itself further developing a resort named Coral Island, covering over 20 islands that make up the North American part of the World. The low-rise development will include a marina and hotel village.
The second largest confirmed development is the purchase of 14 islands that make up Australia and New Zealand by Investment Dar of Kuwait. The islands are being developed as a resort named OQYANA.

The Irish business consortium Larionovo had plans to develop the Ireland island into an Irish-themed resort. The plans included a large internal marina, apartments and villas, a gym, hotel, and an Irish-themed pub. In July 2007, it was announced that the island would feature a recreation of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Giant&#x27;s Causeway. However, on 25 November 2008, a provisional liquidator was appointed for Larionovo. As of October 2022, this has not happened.

In April 2008, Salya Corporation announced that it had acquired the islands of Finland and Brunei and planned to develop them into fashion-themed resorts. Salya spent about Dh800 million (US$218 million) to purchase the islands and plans to spend a further Dh2.4 billion (US$654 million) on development. Brunei Island will be turned into a Fashion TV resort and Finland Island into a fashion community called FTV palace.

Safi Qurashi at the head of Premier, and his business partner Mustafa Nagri, paid an estimated US$64 million for the piece of land; he was later convicted for non-payment of cheques and sentenced to seven years in jail. However, on appeal, he was later found not guilty and released from prison in July 2012, when he was declared innocent of two of the three charges.

Josef Kleindienst and his firm JK Properties are developing the Heart of Europe, a collection of seven islands (Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Ukraine, Main Europe, Switzerland, and Monaco) in the European section of the World, into an island luxury resort. It is meant to create a fully immersive European experience, with outdoor snow and stores accepting only the Euro as a currency. It was set to open in 2020 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In June 2020, a street called Raining Street was being built as part of the Heart of Europe project, with plans to create artificial rainfall once the outdoor temperature exceeds 27 degrees Celsius, with the objective to make a close copy of southern European climate.

In December 2022, it was announced that the first hotel within the project, Cote d&#x27;Azur Monaco, had opened.

<doc id="1286213" wikidata="Q1425594" url="?curid=1286213" title="Oroville Dam">
<text>Oroville Dam is an earthfill embankment dam on the Feather River east of the city of Oroville, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the Sacramento Valley. At 770 feet (235 m) high, it is the tallest dam in the U.S. and serves mainly for water supply, hydroelectricity generation, and flood control. The dam impounds Lake Oroville, the second-largest reservoir in California, capable of storing more than .

Built by the California Department of Water Resources, Oroville Dam is one of the key features of the California State Water Project (SWP), one of two major projects passed that set up California&#x27;s statewide water system. Construction was initiated in 1961, and despite numerous difficulties encountered during its construction, including multiple floods and a major train wreck on the rail line used to transport materials to the dam site, the embankment was topped out in 1967 and the entire project was ready for use in 1968. The dam began to generate electricity shortly afterwards with completion of the Edward Hyatt Power Plant, then the country&#x27;s largest underground power station.

Since its completion in 1968, the Oroville Dam has allocated the flow of the Feather River from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the SWP&#x27;s California Aqueduct, which provides a major supply of water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley, as well as municipal and industrial water supplies to coastal Southern California, and has prevented large amounts of flood damage to the area—more than $1.3 billion between 1987 and 1999. The dam stops fish migration up the Feather River and the controlled flow of the river; as a result, the Oroville Dam has affected riparian habitat. Multiple attempts at trying to counter the dam&#x27;s impacts on fish migration have included the construction of a salmon/steelhead fish hatchery on the river, which began shortly after the dam was completed.

In February 2017, the main and emergency spillways threatened to fail, leading to the evacuation of 188,000 people living near the dam. After deterioration of the main spillway largely stabilized and the water level of the dam&#x27;s reservoir dropped below the top of the emergency spillway, the evacuation order was lifted.

The main spillway was reconstructed by November 1, 2018, and water releases were successfully tested, up to , during April 2019.

==History==

===Planning===
In 1935, work began on the Central Valley Project, a federal water project that would develop the Sacramento and San Joaquin River systems for irrigation of the highly fertile Central Valley. However, after the end of World War II in 1945, the state experienced an economic boom that led to rapid urban and commercial growth in the central and southern portions of the state, and it became clear that California&#x27;s economy could not depend solely on a state water system geared primarily towards agriculture. A new study of California&#x27;s water supplies by the Division of Water Resources (now California Department of Water Resources, DWR) was carried out under an act of the California State Legislature in 1945.

In 1951, California State Engineer A. D. Edmonston proposed the Feather River Project, the direct predecessor to the SWP, which included a major dam on the Feather River at Oroville, and aqueducts and pumping plants to transfer stored water to destinations in central and southern California. The proposed project was strongly opposed by voters in Northern California and parts of Southern California that received water from the Colorado River, but was supported by other Southern Californians and San Joaquin Valley farmers. However, major flooding in the 1950s prompted the 1957 passage of an emergency flood-control bill that provided sufficient funding for construction for a dam at Oroville – regardless of whether it would become part of the SWP.

===Construction===
Groundbreaking on the dam site occurred in May 1957 with the relocation of the Western Pacific Railroad tracks that ran through the Feather River Canyon. The Burns-Porter Act of the California Legislature, which authorized the SWP, was not passed until November 8, 1960, and only by a slim margin. Engineer Donald Thayer of the DWR was commissioned to design and head construction of Oroville Dam, and the primary work contract was awarded to Oro Dam Constructors Inc., a joint venture led by Oman Construction Co.

Two concrete-lined diversion tunnels, each long and in diameter, were excavated to channel the Feather River around the dam site. One of the tunnels was located at river level and was to carry normal water flows, while the second one was only to be used during floods. In May 1963, workers poured the last of of concrete that comprised the high cofferdam, to protect the construction site from floods. This structure later served as an impervious core for the completed dam. With the cofferdam in place, an rail line was constructed to move earth and rock to the dam site. An average of 120 train cars ran along the line each hour, transporting fill that was mainly excavated from enormous piles of hydraulic mining debris that was washed down by the Feather River after the California Gold Rush.

On December 22, 1964, disaster nearly struck when the Feather River, after days of heavy rain, reached a peak flow of above the Oroville Dam site. The water rose behind the partially completed embankment dam and nearly overtopped it, while a maximum of poured from the diversion tunnels. This Christmas flood of 1964 was one of the most disastrous floods on record in Northern California, but the incomplete dam was able to reduce the peak flow of the Feather River by nearly 40%, averting massive damage to the area.

Ten months later, four men died in a tragic accident on the construction rail line. On October 7, 1965, two 40-car work trains, one fully loaded and the other empty, collided head-on at a tunnel entrance, igniting of diesel fuel, completely destroying two locomotives. The burning fuel from the collision started a forest fire that burned before it could be extinguished. The crash delayed construction of the dam by a week while the train wreckage was cleared. Overall, 34 men died in the construction of the dam.

Oroville Dam was designed to withstand the strongest possible earthquake for the region, and was fitted with hundreds of instruments that serve to measure water pressure and settlement of the earth fill used in its construction, earning it the nickname &quot;the dam that talks back&quot;. (A ML 5.7 earthquake in the Oroville area in 1975 is believed to have been caused by induced seismicity from the weight of the Oroville Dam and reservoir on a local fault line.) The embankment was finally topped out on October 6, 1967, with the last of of material that took over 40,000 train trips to transport. On May 4, 1968, Oroville Dam was officially dedicated by the state of California. Among the notable figures present were California governor Ronald Reagan, who spoke, Chief Justice (formerly California governor) Earl Warren, Senator Thomas Kuchel, and California Representative Harold T. &quot;Bizz&quot; Johnson. The dedication was accompanied by a week of festivities in nearby Oroville, attended by nearly 50,000 people.

===2005 dam relicensing===
On October 17, 2005, three environmental groups filed a motion with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) urging federal officials to require that the dam&#x27;s emergency spillway be armored with concrete, rather than remain as an earthen spillway, as it did not meet modern safety standards. &quot;In the event of extreme rain and flooding, fast-rising water would overwhelm the main concrete spillway, then flow down the emergency spillway, and that could cause heavy erosion that would create flooding for communities downstream, but also could cause a failure, known as &#x27;loss of crest control&#x27;.&quot; FERC water agencies responsible for the cost of the upgrades said this was unnecessary and that concerns were overblown.

In 2006, a senior civil engineer sent a memorandum to his managers stating, &quot;The emergency spillway meets FERC&#x27;s engineering guidelines for an emergency spillway&quot;, and &quot;The guidelines specify that during a rare flood event, it is acceptable for the emergency spillway to sustain significant damage.&quot;

=== 2009 river valve accident ===
At around 7:30am on July 22, 2009, several workers were deep below the reservoir operating flow controls to test a river valve chamber in the Oroville Dam. When the flow reached 85%, suction pulled a breakaway wall downstream into a diversion tunnel, cutting lights and nearly sending three workers to their deaths in the roaring current.

One of the workers who was badly injured survived by clinging to a bent rail, where he was struck by tools and equipment being sucked into the tunnel. He was hospitalized for four days with head trauma, a broken leg and arm, cuts, and bruises.

The California Division of the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (Cal OSHA) concluded opening the valves without an energy-dispersion ring, which reportedly was absent, &quot;created water flow with such great turbulence that it blocked an air vent and created a vacuum&quot;. It sanctioned the DWR with six citations, including five classified as serious, and the department was initially fined $141,375. Two of the &quot;serious&quot; citations were overturned on appeal.

This river valve system was one of the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. After that, it served various purposes, including as a possible emergency release valve. Since the accident, DWR had implemented a standing order that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river valve chamber. Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 agreement with Cal OSHA to hire a third-party expert to improve the safety of the river valve outlet system (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about operational needs during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act temperature requirements for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.

===2013, 2015 spillway cracks and inspection===
The spillway cracked in 2013. A senior civil engineer with the DWR was interviewed by the &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot;, and explained, &quot;It’s common for spillways to develop a void because of the drainage systems under them&quot;, and &quot;There were some patches needed and so we made repairs and everything checked out.&quot;

In July 2015, the state Division of Safety of Dams inspected the dam spillway visually &quot;from some distance&quot; and did not walk it.

==2017 spillway failure==

=== Initial spillway damage ===

The rainy season of 2016–2017 was Northern California&#x27;s wettest winter in over 100 years. Heavy rainfall resulted in record inflows from the Feather River, and the spillway was opened in January to relieve pressure on Oroville Dam. After a second series of heavy storms in February, the spillway flow was increased to , and on February 7, DWR employees noticed an unusual flow pattern. This halted spillway outflow, and DWR brought engineers onto the spillway to inspect its integrity. The engineers found a large area of concrete and foundation erosion. This erosion feature was too massive to repair without diverting water to the emergency spillway, and halted outflow along the main spillway for a period to fix the hole. High inflows to Lake Oroville forced dam operators to continue using the damaged spillway, causing additional damage. The spillway hole continued to grow. Debris from the crater in the main spillway was carried downstream, and caused damage to the Feather River Fish Hatchery due to high turbidity.

Although engineers had hoped that using the damaged spillway could drain the lake enough to avoid use of the emergency spillway, they were forced to reduce its discharge from to due to potential damage to nearby power lines.

=== Emergency spillway use and evacuation ===
Shortly after 8:00 pm on February 11, 2017, the emergency spillway began carrying water for the first time since the dam&#x27;s construction in 1968. The water flowed directly onto the earthen hillside below the emergency spillway, as designed. However, headward erosion of the emergency spillway threatened to undermine and collapse the concrete weir.

On February 12, an evacuation was ordered for low-lying areas, due to possible failure of the emergency spillway. The flow over the main spillway was increased to to try to slow erosion of the emergency spillway.

By 8:00 pm on the evening of February 12, the increased flow had lowered the water level, causing the emergency spillway to stop overflowing. On February 14, the sheriff of Butte County lifted the mandatory evacuation order.

=== Investigation and reconstruction ===
On May 19, 2017, the spillway was shut down for the summer, to allow demolition and repair work to begin. The total cost of the repair was projected to exceed $400 million, with the $275 million primary contract awarded to Kiewit Construction. FEMA was expected to cover a large portion of the expenses.

According to an independent forensics team led by John France, the exact cause of the spillway failure remains uncertain, though they identified &quot;24 possible causes for the spillway failure, including a faulty drainage system, variations in concrete thickness, and corrosion in the structure&#x27;s rebar&quot;.

For 2018 the DWR planned to demolish and reconstruct the portion of the spillway which was undamaged by the flood, but which also has been identified as structurally defective. In addition, crews worked to extend a cutoff wall under the emergency spillway to prevent erosion should that structure be used again in the future.

On November 1, 2017, DWR director Grant Davis said, &quot;Lake Oroville&#x27;s main spillway is indeed ready to safely handle winter flows if needed&quot;. While this completes phase 1 of the construction, there remained a phase 2 to be completed in 2018. The second phase would include rebuilding the top section of the spillway (which was not rebuilt this season), putting slabs over the roller compacted concrete section, and constructing a concrete secant cutoff wall for the emergency spillway. The cost estimate at this point is over $500 million. In October 2017, hairline cracks were found in the rebuilt spillway. Things that added to the cost included relocating power lines, dredging the river downstream of the dam, as well as the discovery that the bedrock under the spillway was weak, necessitating deeper excavations and more concrete.

The DWR commissioned an independent board of consultants (BOC) to review and comment on repairs to Oroville Dam. Memoranda (reports) prepared by the BOC are posted at the DWR web site. The independent forensic team (IFT) was selected to determine the cause of the spillways incident, including effects of operations, management, structural design and geological conditions.


According to its 2017–18 operations plan, the DWR maintained Lake Oroville at a lower-than-normal level to reduce the possibility that the spillway would have to be used the following winter.
In a second phase of spillway repairs in 2018–19, temporary repairs on the main spillway done during phase one were being torn out and replaced with steel-reinforced structural concrete.

On April 2, 2019, due to heavy rainfall upstream, the DWR began releasing water over the newly reconstructed spillway at a rate of . Releases were increased to on April 7 to test how the spillway performed in higher flows. They were decreased to on April 9.

====2020 Safety assessment====
The DWR released an assessment, dated October 1, 2020, concluding that Oroville Dam was suitable for continued safe and reliable operation.

Meanwhile, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has demanded that California submit a plan by September 2022, for addressing the issue of greater amounts of rain predicted in the future.

==2020–21 drought==

Due to the low precipitation in the catchment area, water levels were below normal beginning in 2020.
In August 2021, the Hyatt power plant had to be shut down because the water level fell below its water inlets. After falling to a record low of 22% capacity by September 30, winter storms increased the lake level by December and the plant was restarted on January 4, 2022.

==Operations==

===Hydroelectricity===

Construction of the underground Edward Hyatt Pump-Generating Plant was finished shortly after the completion of Oroville Dam. At the time, it was the largest underground power station in the United States, with three 132-megawatt (MW) conventional turbines and three 141 MW pump-generators for a total installed capacity of 819 MW. The Hyatt Powerplant is capable of pumping water back into Lake Oroville when surplus power is available. The pump-generators at Hyatt can lift up to into Lake Oroville (with a net consumption of 519 MW), while the six turbines combined use a flow of at maximum generation.

Since 1969, the Hyatt plant has worked in tandem with an extensive pumped-storage operation comprising two offstream reservoirs west of Oroville. These two facilities are collectively known as the Oroville–Thermalito Complex. Water is diverted into the upper Thermalito reservoir (Thermalito Forebay) via the Thermalito Diversion Dam on the Feather River. During periods of off-peak power use, surplus energy generated at Hyatt is used to lift water from Thermalito&#x27;s lower reservoir (the Thermalito Afterbay) to the forebay, which releases water back into the afterbay to generate up to 114 MW of power at times of high demand. The Hyatt and Thermalito plants produce an average of 2,200 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity each year, about half of the total power produced by the SWP&#x27;s eight hydroelectric facilities.

===Water supply===
Water released from Oroville Dam travels down the Feather River before joining with the Sacramento River, eventually reaching the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where the SWP&#x27;s California Aqueduct diverts the fresh water for transport to the arid San Joaquin Valley and Southern California. Oroville–Thermalito hydroelectric facilities furnish about one-third of the power necessary to drive the pumps that lift the water in the aqueduct from the delta into the valley, and then from the valley over the Tehachapi Mountains into coastal Southern California. Water and power from the dam contribute to the irrigation of in the arid San Joaquin Valley Westside and municipal supplies to some 25 million people. At least of water is released.

===Flood control===

During the winter and early spring, Lake Oroville is required to have at least , or a fifth of the reservoir&#x27;s storage capacity, available for flood control. The dam is operated to maintain an objective flood-control release of , which may be further reduced during large storms when flows below the Feather&#x27;s confluence with the Yuba River exceed . In the particularly devastating flood of 1997, inflows to the reservoir hit more than , but dam operators managed to limit the outflow to , sparing large regions of the Sacramento Valley from flooding.

===Feather River Fish Hatchery===
Oroville Dam completely blocks the anadromous migrations of Chinook salmon and steelhead trout in the Feather River. In 1967, in an effort to compensate for lost habitat, the DWR and the California Department of Fish and Game completed the Feather River Fish Hatchery. The Fish Barrier Dam, built in 1962, intercepts salmon and trout before they reach the base of the impassable Thermalito Diversion Dam and forces them to swim up a fish ladder to the hatchery, which is located on the north bank of the Feather River. The hatchery produces 10 million salmon smolt, along with 450,000 trout smolt, to stock in the river each year. The salmon smolt are released in two runs, with 20% for the spring run and 80% for the fall run. This facility has been successful enough that concern exists that salmon of hatchery stock are outcompeting remaining wild salmon in the Feather River system.

<doc id="1286222" wikidata="Q1753551" url="?curid=1286222" title="Pyrometric cone">
<text>Pyrometric cones are pyrometric devices that are used to gauge heatwork during the firing of ceramic materials in a kiln. The cones, often used in sets of three, are positioned in a kiln with the wares to be fired and, because the individual cones in a set soften and fall over at different temperatures, they provide a visual indication of when the wares have reached a required state of maturity, a combination of time and temperature. 

Pyrometric cones give a &quot;temperature equivalent&quot;; they are not simple temperature-measuring devices.

== Definition ==
The pyrometric cone is &quot;A pyramid with a triangular base and of a defined shape and size; the &quot;cone&quot; is shaped from a carefully proportioned and uniformly mixed batch of ceramic materials so that when it is heated under stated conditions, it will bend due to softening, the tip of the cone becoming level with the base at a definitive temperature. Pyrometric cones are made in series, the temperature interval between the successive cones usually being 20 degrees Celsius. The best known series are Seger Cones (Germany), Orton Cones (USA) and Staffordshire Cones (UK).&quot;

== Usage ==
For some products, such as porcelain and lead-free glazes, it can be advantageous to fire within a two-cone range. The three-cone system can be used to determine temperature uniformity and to check the performance of an electronic controller. The three-cone system consists of three consecutively numbered cones:
* Guide cone – one cone number cooler than firing cone.
* Firing cone – the cone recommended by manufacturer of glaze, slip, etc.
* Guard cone – one cone number hotter than firing cone.

Additionally, most kilns have temperature differences from top to bottom. The amount of difference depends on the design of the kiln, the age of the heating elements, the load distribution in the kiln, and the cone number to which the kiln is fired. Usually, kilns have a greater temperature difference at cooler cone numbers. Cones should be used on the lower, middle and top shelves to determine how much difference exists during firing. This will aid in the way the kiln is loaded and fired to reduce the difference. Downdraft venting will also even out temperatures variance.

Both temperature and time and sometimes atmosphere affect the final bending position of a cone. Temperature is the predominant variable. The temperature is referred to as an equivalent temperature, since actual firing conditions may vary somewhat from those in which the cones were originally standardized. Observation of cone bending is used to determine when a kiln has reached a desired state. Additionally, small cones or bars can be arranged to mechanically trigger kiln controls when the temperature rises enough for them to deform. Precise, consistent placement of large and small cones must be followed to ensure the proper temperature equivalent is being reached. Every effort needs to be made to always have the cone inclined at 8° from the vertical. Large cones must be mounted 2 inches above the plaque and small cones mounted 15/16 inches. With the cones having their own base, &quot;self-supporting cones&quot; eliminate errors with their mounting.

Pyrometric cones can be used in a &quot;kiln sitter&quot;, a device which senses the softening of a cone and produces a mechanical output through a trigger assembly, typically to switch off the kiln.

== Control of variability ==
Pyrometric cones are sensitive measuring devices and it is important to users that they should remain consistent in the way that they react to heating. Cone manufacturers follow procedures to control variability (within batches and between batches) to ensure that cones of a given grade remain consistent in their properties over long periods. A number of national standards and an ISO standard have been published regarding pyrometric cones.

Even though cones from different manufacturers can have relatively similar numbering systems, they are not identical in their characteristics. If a change is made from one manufacturer to another, then allowances for the differences can sometimes be necessary.

== History ==
In 1782, Josiah Wedgwood created accurately scaled pyrometric device, with details published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London in 1782 (Vol. LXXII, part 2). This led him to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society.
The modern form of the pyrometric cone was developed by Hermann Seger and first used to control the firing of porcelain wares at the Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin (&quot;Königliche Porzellanmanufaktur&quot;, in 1886, where Seger was director. &quot;Seger cones&quot; are made by a small number of companies and the term is often used as a synonym for &quot;pyrometric cones&quot;. The &quot;Standard Pyrometric Cone Company&quot; was founded in Columbus, Ohio, by Edward J. Orton, Jr. in 1896 to manufacture pyrometric cones, and following his death a charitable trust established to operate the company, which is known Edward Orton Jr. Ceramic Foundation, or Orton Ceramic Foundation.

Pyrometric cones are often referred to as &quot;Orton Cones&quot; within the United States, but in his lifetime Orton preferred calling them &quot;Seger cones&quot;.
==Ceramic art==
A biennial ceramic art exhibition for small work, the Orton Cone Box Show, took the Orton Cone company&#x27;s pyrometric cone box as the size constraint for submissions.

<doc id="1286226" wikidata="Q588448" url="?curid=1286226" title="Pale Male">
<text>Pale Male (1990 – May 16, 2023), or Palemale, was a red-tailed hawk that resided in and near New York City&#x27;s Central Park from the 1990s until 2023. Birdwatcher and author Marie Winn gave him his name because of the unusually light coloring of his head. He was one of the first red-tailed hawks known to have nested on a building rather than in a tree and is known for establishing a dynasty of urban-dwelling red-tailed hawks.

Each spring, bird watchers would set up telescopes alongside Central Park&#x27;s Model Boat Pond to observe his nest and chicks at 927 Fifth Avenue. Although it was suggested over the years that Pale Male could have died and been replaced by a similarly colored bird without the change being observed, there was no strong evidence to confirm or deny this possibility.

== Life ==
When he arrived in Central Park in 1991, as a first-year immature hawk, Pale Male tried to nest in a tree, but he was driven off by crows. He later roosted on a building on Fifth Avenue across the street from the park. Around early 1992, he found a mate, dubbed &quot;First Love&quot;. First Love was injured later that year and removed to the Raptor Trust in Morris County, New Jersey. During her absence, Pale Male took another mate. After several unsuccessful spring nesting attempts, Pale Male and a mate hatched three in 1995. The eyasses survived to young adulthood and took up residence in Central Park.

First Love returned to Central Park after being banded and released from the Raptor Trust. She and Pale Male reunited and raised several eyasses. Some birdwatchers waited several months to see the eyasses grow and then take their first flights. Pale Male brought food to his offspring about five times each day. In 1997, First Love died after eating a poisoned pigeon in Central Park.

Pale Male&#x27;s mate from 1998 to 2001 was a hawk known as Blue. The pair were observed to hatch about 11 eyasses in that period. Blue disappeared about the time of the September 11 attacks in 2001. In early 2002, Pale Male was first observed with a new mate, Lola. They raised seven eyasses between 2002 and 2004, building a nest on ornamental stonework above a top-story window on a residential housing cooperative at 927 Fifth Avenue, near 74th Street on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Although Pale Male and Lola collected sticks for a potential nest at a cooperative on the Upper West Side, the Beresford at 81st Street and Central Park West, in 2006, they never nested there. Lola disappeared in December 2010 and was presumed dead.

A new mate appeared in early January 2011. This new hawk, Lima, also called &quot;Ginger&quot;, because of her dark feathers on her neck and chin, was only in her second year. She was a young adult, with still-yellow irises, indicating her exact age. Her first nesting attempt was in the winter and spring of 2011 using the existing nest. Ginger exhibited behavior consistent with incubation of eggs in mid-April 2011 and two eyasses emerged towards the end of May 2011, producing the first baby hawks in this nest since 2004. Lima died in late February 2012, presumably after eating a poisoned rat.

After Lima&#x27;s death, Pale Male took a new mate, dubbed Zena. The two fledged three offspring, two of which were poisoned, rescued, rehabilitated, and then released back into Central Park. In September 2012, Zena disappeared and was presumed dead, and Pale Male took a new mate, called &quot;Octavia&quot; due to her status as Pale Male&#x27;s eighth mate.

, many observers believed that Pale Male was still alive at the age of 31. This would have made him one of the oldest known red-tailed hawks on record. It was suggested in 2015 that Pale Male could have died sometime over the years and been replaced without birdwatchers&#x27; notice by another male hawk with similar coloring, but no substantive evidence has been provided for either fate.

== Death ==

On May 16, 2023, wildlife rehabilitator Bob Horvath reported that Pale Male had been found &quot;sick and grounded in Central Park&quot; by New York City Urban Park Ranger Nick Baisley the previous day, on May 15, 2023. Pale Male was transferred into Horvath&#x27;s custody and he immediately took the hawk to the veterinary. Blood work and X-ray scans were done and Horvath then took him to WINORR to provide supportive care while they waited for the test results. Pale Male died on the evening of May 16, 2023, at age 33.

== Nest controversy ==
In early December 2004, the hawks&#x27; nest and the anti-pigeon spikes that had long anchored it were removed by the board of the co-op due to concerns about debris from the nest falling to the street below. The removal caused an international outcry and a series of impassioned protests organized by New York City Audubon Society and the Central Park birding community. Mary Tyler Moore, a resident of the building and animal rights advocate, also participated in the protests. By December 12, 2004, the building, various city agencies, and the Audubon Society agreed to seek a solution, and quickly came to an agreement to replace the spikes and to install a new &quot;cradle&quot; for the nest. By December 28, 2004, the scaffolding had been removed and the hawks started bringing twigs to the nest site.

However, eggs laid by Lola in March 2005 did not hatch, and in fact Pale Male and Lola did not hatch any new eyasses since the disturbance of their original nest. A panel of experts assembled by the Audubon Society reviewed the photos taken of the interior of the nest on January 4, 2008, and recommended the removal of stainless steel spikes seen protruding through the bowl of the nest. The spikes impeded the rolling of the eggs by the female during incubation. The Audubon Society obtained the support and approvals of municipal agencies and property owners to have the 92 spikes removed from the cradle supporting the nest.

== Other red-tailed hawks in the area ==
Since 2000, other adult hawk pairs have nested in or on the bounds of Central Park, with varying degrees of success.

At the south end of the park, a hawk couple dubbed Pale Male Junior (or simply &quot;Junior&quot;) and Charlotte nested on the Trump Park Hotel on Central Park South in 2005.

Following reports of red-tails attempting to nest on or near the Plaza Hotel at the southeast corner of Central Park, a pair of red-tails built a nest in a tree on the edge of the park&#x27;s Sheep Meadow in 2014 and raised two baby hawks.

Reports of further attempts to nest on buildings along or near Central Park South since 2016 have continued, e.g., at the Ritz-Carlton in 2022, but none have been reported successful.

A pair of red-tails known for several years of unsuccessful nesting attempts on buildings along Central Park West built a nest in Central Park&#x27;s Pinetum in 2022 and successfully fledged two babies.

A hawk couple known as Tristan and Isolde claimed Central Park&#x27;s Great Hill and North Wood as their territory in 2006, but their nest was located about four blocks from the park at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, overlooking Morningside Park. Although both Tristan and Isolde have since died or disappeared, they and their successors at the cathedral nest had fledged 28 baby red-tails as of 2020.

Attempted red-tail nesting activity has been reported at other locations on the periphery of Central Park, including locations on Central Park West since 2013, but none were successful until 2021. In 2021 and 2022, a pair of red-tailed hawks nested on the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Center, across Fifth Avenue from Central Park&#x27;s Conservatory Garden, and hatches were reported there.

== New York City red-tail population ==

A 2007 study commissioned by the Audubon Society reported that pairs of red-tails were spotted breeding in nests at 32 locations throughout the city, and hawk watchers say they have spotted dozens of unattached red-tails across the five boroughs. Since 2010, there have typically been about ten active red-tailed hawk nests in Manhattan per year. For example, in 2014, there were at least eleven red-tailed nests reported in Manhattan, of which ten were known to have fledged baby hawks. In 2021 there were ten nests reported, but only five were confirmed to fledge at least a young bird.

Relatively small green spaces about the city may see red-tailed hawk visitors, while slightly larger locations, such as Washington Square Park, Tompkins Square Park, the Fordham University Rose Hill campus, and the main Columbia University campus, may support nesting pairs.

<doc id="1286250" wikidata="Q56416" url="?curid=1286250" title="Cypriot Arabic">
<text>Cypriot Arabic (), also known as Cypriot Maronite Arabic or Sanna, is a moribund variety of Arabic spoken by the Maronite community of Cyprus. Formerly speakers were mostly situated in Kormakitis, but following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, the majority relocated to the south and dispersed, leading to the decline of the language. Traditionally bilingual in Cypriot Greek, as of some time prior to 2000, all remaining speakers of Cypriot Arabic were over 30 years of age. A 2011 census reported that, of the 3,656 Maronite Cypriots in Republic of Cyprus-controlled areas, none declared Cypriot Arabic as their first language.

==History and classification==
Cypriot Arabic was first introduced to Cyprus by Maronites who came mainly from Lebanon and Syria as early as the seventh century, with waves of immigration up to the thirteenth century. Since 2002, it is one of UNESCO-designated severely endangered languages and, since 2008, it is recognised as a minority language of Cyprus, coinciding with an attempt to revitalise the language.

Cypriot Arabic has in the past been assigned to a Syrian-Lebanese or Levantine Arabic classification, likely owing to the contemporary presence of a large Lebanese-speaking Maronite community on the mainland. However, more recently it has been shown to share a large number of common features with the &quot;qeltu&quot; or North Mesopotamian Arabic dialects of Iraq, Syria, and Turkey, and a pre-Cypriot medieval antecedent has been deduced as belonging to this dialect area. Indications of an Aramaic substrate suggest it was close to the time of the language shift from Aramaic to Arabic; other features are common to those of Syro-Lebanese and Palestinian, which go back to a period in which there was a dialect continuum between the Mesopotamian dialects and the Syrian dialect area.

In the Cypriot stage, the language was extensively restructured through contact with Cypriot Greek, acquiring numerous features and constraints not typical of Arabic. Essentially unintelligible to mainland Arabic speakers, it is characterized as an isolated &quot;peripheral Arabic&quot; along with others such as Maltese. Its Arabic component is a hybrid of dialects from diverse areas and times of Southeastern Anatolia, northern Syria, and Mesopotamia, as well as the Levant, offering unique insights into the historical evolution of Eastern Arabic.

==Phonology==

 argues that the sound system of Cypriot Arabic has been heavily influenced by that of Cypriot Greek. Cypriot Arabic has lost all emphatic consonants and stop-voicing opposition (though this is subject to debate in literature)—but retained gemination. Geminate voiceless stop consonants surface as aspirates. Furthermore, Old Arabic merged with , became , and merged with .

The consonant phonemes of Cypriot Arabic, according to , are . Affricates occur as allophones of clusters . Voiced stops occur as allophones of voiceless stops intervocalically and next to a sonorant or . There are five vowel phonemes, , and two diphthongs, . Phonological rules observed in Cypriot Arabic include:
* Historical stop + stop clusters are dissimilated to fricative + stop.
* are palatalized to before . is fully assimilated.
* between an obstruent and a vowel surfaces as .
* An epenthetic stop occurs between a nasal and a continuant or sonorant. The place of articulation is inherited from the nasal before it and the voicing from the continuant or sonorant that follows.

Phenomena similar to the first three are also observed in Cypriot Greek.

==Writing system==
In May 2009, the Committee of Experts for the Codification of Cypriot Maronite Arabic submitted an action plan for the codification and revitalisation of the language to the Cypriot government. The Public Foundation for European Comparative Minority Research reported in 2006 that both the Greek and Latin script had been suggested for adoption. The Greek script is used for Cypriot Arabic in a Cypriot Arabic–Greek dictionary.

Alexander Borg, a linguist specialising in the language, created a Latin-based alphabet with elements from Maltese and Greek that the non-governmental organisation for the revitalisation of the language &quot;Hki Fi Sanna&quot; endorsed in 2007, and some &quot;small texts&quot; have apparently been translated into it.

<text>Incat Tasmania is an Australian manufacturer of high-speed craft (HSC) catamaran ferries. Its greatest success has been with large, sea going passenger and vehicle ferries, but it has also built military transports and since 2015 it has built smaller river and bay ferries. Based in Derwent Park, a suburb of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, it was founded by Bob Clifford.

The company builds vessels using aluminium construction, wave-piercing and water-jet technology. Vessels have been constructed up to 130 metres in length with a size of 13,000 gross tons and with cruising speeds of up to 58 knots (107 km/h).

==History==

The company began in 1972 as the Sullivans Cove Ferry Company in suburban Hobart and built four small ferries before International Catamarans was formed in 1977 by a partnership between founder Bob Clifford and marine architect Philip Hercus. This partnership created plans for what was probably the first large wave piercing catamaran in the world. However the partnership was dissolved in 1988 with Clifford remaining in Hobart trading as Incat Tasmania while Hercus returned to Sydney to establish Incat Designs (Sydney), a design-only company that became Incat Crowther after a merger in 2005. Incat Crowther has no association with Incat Tasmania and its ships are built by other companies. Incat Tasmania has its own in-house design company, Revolution Design.

In 1989 Incat Tasmania moved to its present location on Prince of Wales Bay, which allowed it to build larger ships, and in 1990 Incat delivered its first 74-metre fast catamaran ferry. At the same time, several other companies also began to build large aluminium vehicle carrying ferries. This new type of ship was revolutionary and over the next decade fast cats replaced most hydrofoil and hovercraft services as well as many monohull ferries. The success of this new type of ferry led to other shipbuilders around the world using their yards to build large vehicle carrying aluminium catamarans. However many ferry operators preferred traditional monohull designs and the limited market for fast cats became crowded with manufacturers bidding low to keep their shipyards working.

In August 2024, Incat purchased 12 hectares of land from Norske Skog to build a second shipyard on part of the Boyer Mill site.

==Products==
===Large wave piercing passenger and vehicle ferries===
In 1990 Incat was one of the pioneers of large, fast catamaran ferries and they have been its core product ever since. The type of ship was different from earlier ferries and its instant success led to Incat becoming a major player in the industry. Over the years innovation has led to the ships becoming bigger, faster, more fuel efficient and much more stable on rough seas. Vehicle decks are often movable to make way for high trucks or extra cars.

Ships in this category have been built from 74 to 130 metres long and from 3,000 to 13,000 gross tons. The 99-metre HSC Francisco (Hull 069) is the world&#x27;s fastest ship in commercial service and can achieve speeds up to .

===Smaller passenger ferries===
Incat began by building small ferries under 37 metres, but from 1990 it concentrated on larger vehicle-carrying catamarans. However, in 2015 the company resumed building smaller ferries and in that year it delivered river ferries for operation in London, Hobart and Sydney. Since then it has designed and built more smaller ferries including two 35-metre, 400 passenger ferries (Hulls 090 and 095) for commuter runs by Port Phillip Ferries from Melbourne Docklands to Portarlington and Geelong.

===Military vessels===

In the 1990s several catamarans built by Incat entered naval service as fast transports, including HMAS &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; with the Royal Australian Navy and HSV-X1&quot;Joint Venture&quot;, &quot;Spearhead&quot; and HSV-2 &quot;Swift&quot;, which served with the United States Armed Forces.

===Other vessels===
====K class====
In the mid-1990s Incat built three &quot;K class&quot; ferries. They are 70 to 80 metres long, low profile passenger vessels without wave piercing bows or the distinctive centre bow that characterise all other larger Incat ferries. Two were built by Incat in Hobart and a third was built by a Chinese partner. Plans for further Chinese built K class ferries did not eventuate and Hull NF08 remains the only Incat vessel not built in Hobart.

====Oil rig tender==== 
Most offshore oil rigs are exposed to rough open seas with crew transfers by helicopter and freight needs served by platform supply vessels. However Azerbaijan&#x27;s offshore oil rigs are in the calmer waters of the Caspian Sea, the world&#x27;s largest lake, so crew transfers can be comfortably and more economically undertaken by water. Several fast catamarans have been built to transfer both crews and cargo for this market including Incat Hull 074 &quot;Muslim Magomayev&quot; delivered in 2015. The size of catamarans that can be built for this niche market is restricted by the 16.5-metre width of locks on the Volga–Don Canal that connects the Caspian Sea with the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.

====Brooke Street Pier====
From 1990 Incat had almost exclusively built large catamarans, but this changed in 2014 when the company diversified into something that was not even a ship, although it did float. An earlier Brooke Street Pier ferry terminal on Hobart&#x27;s waterfront needed replacement and Incat was commissioned to build an 80 x 20-metre floating pontoon. Hull 077 was towed 8 km from Incat&#x27;s shipyard to Sullivans Cove before finishing work was done on site. In addition to ferry berths, the pier hosts a restaurant, a cafe and a number of stalls.

====Luxury super yachts====
The market for opulent motor yachts has grown rapidly in the 21st century and while the market is mostly for monohull vessels, catamarans are beginning to make inroads. Incat has released several designs ranging from 80 to 112 metres which are shown on their website, but so far there have been no orders.

==Deliveries==
In its early years Incat built smaller boats and ferries with little to distinguish it from other boat yards except for a willingness to experiment and innovate. But the revolutionary Hull 023 completed in 1990 was quite different and was the first of the type of ferry that Incat is best known for today with its large capacity, high speed, wave piercing hulls and distinctive centre bow. As one of the first large aluminium vehicle carrying catamarans in the world, it contributed to the big changes in the ferry industry that occurred in the 1990s.

In the &quot;Length / class&quot; field of the table WPC means the vessel is a wave piercing catamaran. The three K class vessels were a low profile design without the wave piercing bows and the capacity to carry fewer cars than traditional Incat designs.

In the competitive ferry industry, ships often change operators, especially in Europe. Other ferries have alternated between summer service in the northern and southern hemispheres every six months. Some Incat vessels of the 1990s have been operated by up to six shipping companies with regular name changes.

Gross tonnage is a measure of a ship&#x27;s enclosed volume rather than its weight or displacement, so similar ships can have differing gross tonnages due to factors such as whether a viewing platform is fully enclosed or open to the weather.

<text>Maryland Route 201 (MD 201) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for most of its length as Kenilworth Avenue, the highway runs from the District of Columbia boundary in Tuxedo, where the highway continues south as District of Columbia Route 295 (DC 295), north to MD 212 in Beltsville. MD 201 is a four to six-lane divided highway that connects Washington, D.C., with the northern Prince George&#x27;s County municipalities of Cheverly, Bladensburg, Edmonston, Riverdale Park, College Park, Berwyn Heights, and Greenbelt. The highway also provides part of the connections from Interstate 95 (I-95)/I-495 to a pair of Washington Metro stations. MD 201 was built as two separate highways in the late 1920s: MD 201 from Washington, D.C., to Bladensburg and MD 205 from Bladensburg to Greenbelt. These highways, some of which became MD 769, were replaced with a relocated Kenilworth Avenue in the mid 1950s, including the Kenilworth Interchange with U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway in Tuxedo. MD 201 was extended north to Beltsville in the early 1960s. The Maryland State Highway Administration (MDSHA) plans to extend MD 201 north toward Laurel.

==Route description==

MD 201 begins at the District of Columbia boundary in Tuxedo as Kenilworth Avenue, which continues into Washington, D.C., as DC 295. The six-lane freeway enters Maryland by passing under Eastern Avenue, which has an extra-wide bridge over the freeway. MD 201 heads north paralleled by unsigned MD 965 (Kenilworth Avenue), a one-way service road to and from Eastern Avenue that parallels the freeway along a narrow roadway; there are ramps from MD 965 to northbound MD 201 and from southbound MD 201 to MD 965. The freeway crosses over MD 965 and Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor railroad line and enters the Kenilworth Interchange, which connects MD 201, US 50 (John Hanson Highway), the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (unsigned MD 295), and MD 459, which is also named Kenilworth Avenue. Just north of MD 201&#x27;s bridges over US 50, two-lane ramps split from MD 201 to join the Baltimore–Washington Parkway. MD 201 becomes a four-lane expressway and has ramps to and from MD 459, which is used for access from northbound MD 201 to westbound US 50 and from westbound US 50 to northbound MD 201.

North of MD 459, MD 201 crosses over the Alexandria Extension of CSX&#x27;s Capital Subdivision railroad line and curves northwest to pass under the Baltimore–Washington Parkway. North of the parkway, southbound MD 201 has a ramp to US 50 (New York Avenue) into Washington. MD 201 becomes a four-lane arterial road and has a staggered pair of intersections with 52nd Avenue, which heads south and north as MD 769D and MD 769C, respectively. MD 201 expands to six lanes and curves north into the town of Bladensburg. The highway drops to four lanes ahead of its partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 450 (Annapolis Road). Northbound MD 201 has two pairs of ramps for the interchange; the southern set are with MD 201A and the northern set are with the northern end of MD 769C (48th Street). MD 201 leaves Bladensburg, passes through the town of Edmonston, and meets the northern end of the southern segment of Edmonston Road in the town of Riverdale Park.
MD 201 intersects Riverdale Road and MD 410 (East–West Highway), then follows the eastern boundary of Riverdale Park, meeting the southern terminus of MD 431 (River Road). The route runs along the border of Riverdale Park to Brier Ditch, just north of which the highway intersects Campus Drive and Good Luck Road. The former road provides access to the University of Maryland, the College Park Airport, and the College Park–University of Maryland station on the Washington Metro&#x27;s Green Line. MD 201 begins to be paralleled by the middle segment of Edmonston Road to the west; this road forms the eastern boundary of the city of College Park and then the town of Berwyn Heights. On the east side of the state highway is Greenbelt Park within the city of Greenbelt. MD 201 expands to six lanes at its intersection with Pontiac Street then fully enters Greenbelt at its diamond interchange with MD 193 (Greenbelt Road).
MD 201 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-95/I-495 (Capital Beltway) and meets the western end of Crescent Road opposite the entrance to MDSHA&#x27;s District 3 office. The highway drops to four lanes at Ivy Lane as it curves northwest. MD 201 drops to two lanes and its name changes to Edmonston Road at the northern city limit of Greenbelt at Cherrywood Lane, which leads to the Greenbelt Metro station along the Green Line. The highway continues through the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, within which the highway crosses Beaverdam Creek and curves north to its terminus at the intersection of Powder Mill Road and Edmonston Road on the eastern edge of Beltsville. The intersection also serves as the signed eastern terminus of MD 212, which is officially MD 212A at this location. Powder Mill Road continues east as the main highway through the research farm; Edmonston Road continues north as a county highway.

MD 201 is part of the main National Highway System from the District of Columbia to MD 459 just north of MD 201&#x27;s interchange with US 50 and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway in Tuxedo. The highway is also an intermodal connector from Campus Drive near College Park to Cherrywood Lane in Greenbelt and a National Highway System principal arterial from MD 459 to Campus Drive.

==History==

The first segment of MD 201, which was then known as River Road, was constructed as a concrete road from the District of Columbia boundary to Tuxedo Road (now MD 459) in Tuxedo in 1926 and 1927. The highway was extended north to US 50 (now MD 450) in Bladensburg in 1929. MD 201 was widened with a pair of bituminous shoulders along its entire length in 1941. The state highway originally followed what is now MD 965 north from Eastern Avenue along the northbound side of the modern highway. MD 201 continued along a road that no longer exists across Beaverdam Creek and the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak Northeast Corridor). North of what is now US 50, the highway followed the Kenilworth Avenue portion of MD 459 to its junction with MD 201, where the route was broken by modern MD 201 and the Baltimore–Washington Parkway. MD 201 continued along what are today MD 769D and MD 769C (52nd Avenue, Quincy Street, and 48th Street) to US 50 in Bladensburg.
The first segment of MD 205, which comprised Edmonston Road from Bladensburg to Greenbelt, was constructed as a concrete road from US 50 in Bladensburg to Riverdale Road in Riverdale Park between 1924 and 1926. The highway was extended north to Branchville Road (now MD 193) in Berwyn Heights between 1926 and 1928. MD 205 was widened with a pair of bituminous shoulders along its entire length in 1940. The highway was relocated and given two new bridges across Brier Ditch in 1949 and 1950. MD 205 originally followed Edmonston Road, including all of MD 769B, from Bladensburg to Greenbelt. The highway followed the present alignment of MD 201 from the north end of Edmonston Road in East Riverdale to Old Calvert Road just north of Campus Drive in Riverdale Park.

Construction on modern MD 201 as a divided highway from Washington, D.C., to Greenbelt began in 1952. The first segment of the highway, from Creston Street (at the ramp from southbound MD 201 to MD 459) north to Inwood Street (at the 52nd Street intersection), was started in 1952 and completed in 1954 and included a bridge across the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s Alexandria Branch. The new MD 201 was extended north from Inwood Street to Upshur Street north of the new MD 450 interchange and from there to the Brier Ditch relocation from 1954 to 1956. The new highway was constructed from the Brief Ditch relocation to just north of MD 430 (now MD 193) in Greenbelt starting in 1956; the divided highway was completed in 1958. The MD 205 designation was removed north of Bladensburg in 1956; the old segments of MD 201 and MD 205 became segments of MD 769.
Work on the Kenilworth or Tuxedo Interchange between MD 201, the Baltimore–Washington Parkway, and the Annapolis–Washington Expressway (US 50) began in 1954. The first highway through the interchange, the parkway and its continuation into Washington along New York Avenue, was completed in 1955. The new alignment of MD 201 from MD 459 to the District of Columbia was completed in 1957 and opened concurrently with the adjacent portion of expanded Kenilworth Avenue in the city. The portion of John Hanson Highway from New York Avenue to the interchange opened that same year. The final movements in the interchange, from MD 201 to eastbound US 50 and from westbound US 50 to MD 201, opened concurrent with the portion of John Hanson Highway from the Kenilworth Interchange to MD 704 in Lanham in 1962.

MD 201 was extended north along Edmonston Road through Greenbelt to MD 212 in Beltsville in 1962. The following year, the divided highway was extended north through the interchange with the Capital Beltway to relocated Crescent Road in Greenbelt. MD 201&#x27;s diamond interchange with MD 193 was built in 1988. The MDSHA plans to extend MD 201 north as a multi-lane divided highway north from MD 212 in Beltsville to I-95 south of Laurel. The highway would split north from Edmonston Road north of Odell Road, cross over CSX&#x27;s Capital Subdivision and US 1, and follow an existing right-of-way corridor to the intersection of Virginia Manor Road and Ritz Way. MD 201 would continue along Virginia Manor Road to Konterra Drive (Maryland Route 206), which has an interchange with I-95.

==Major intersections==





==Auxiliary route==
MD 201A is the designation for the unnamed connector between a right-in/right-out intersection with northbound MD 201 and MD 769C (48th Street) in the southeast quadrant of the MD 201–MD 450 interchange in Bladensburg.

<text>Caritas was a Ponzi scheme in Romania that was active between April 1992 and August 1994. It attracted millions of depositors from all over the country, who invested more than a trillion old lei (between US$1 billion and $5 billion) before it finally went bankrupt on 14 August 1994, having a debt of US$450 million ($ in current terms).

== History ==
The Caritas company, which organized the scheme, was founded by Ioan Stoica in April 1992 in Brașov as a limited liability company with just 100,000 lei (US$500, or $ in current terms) in capital. Caritas moved to Cluj-Napoca two months later. The deposits were initially small (2,000–10,000 lei), but later, the minimum initial deposit was 20,000 lei, while the maximum was 160,000 lei. At the beginning, only residents of Cluj were allowed to make a deposit, but starting summer 1993, all Romanian citizens were allowed to participate.

It labeled itself a &quot;mutual-aid game&quot; (hence the name &quot;Caritas&quot;, meaning charity in Latin) which had the purpose of helping impoverished Romanians during the transition to capitalism and promised eight times the money invested in six months.

Caritas prospered with the help of the connection it had with the nationalist Romanian National Unity Party (PUNR) and the mayor of Cluj-Napoca, Gheorghe Funar, who welcomed this scheme and even helped it build credibility by renting them space in the Cluj town hall, appearing with Stoica in public and on television, and defending Caritas from attacks. Funar paid for space in the local newspaper to publish a list of the &quot;winners&quot; who would see their money multiply eightfold; the list was 44 pages per day less than a month before the scheme collapsed.

== Size ==
The size of the scheme is unclear. Estimates vary between two and eight million depositors. The number most commonly quoted in the Romanian newspapers is four million, while the international newspapers tended to estimate their number to two or three million. In Autumn 1993, the list of names to be paid on a certain day as published in a Transylvanian newspaper included 22,000 names, which suggests that there were 660,000 depositors at one time.

Dan Pascariu, a banker and the chairman of Bancorex, estimated that between 35% and 50% of Romanian households were involved in the scheme. Mugur Isărescu, the president of the National Bank of Romania, estimated that it held a third of Romania&#x27;s banknotes at one point.

An estimate of Romanian newspaper &quot;România Liberă&quot; gives the amount of money involved as 1.4 trillion lei or about 20% of the 1993 expenditures of the Romanian government of 6.6 trillion. &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated the scheme attracted between $1 billion and $5 billion.

== Bankruptcy ==

The Romanian government banned pyramid schemes only after Caritas went bankrupt. The government received warnings about the scheme from several sources, including the Romanian Intelligence Service, which wrote a report in early 1993 (leaked to the press) and from Daniel Dăianu, the chief economist at the National Bank, who called it a fraud.

As president Ion Iliescu commented on the issue, the main reason why the government allowed the game to go on was the fear of being ousted by riots and protests, or being afraid that such a measure would make it more unpopular.

The first signs of the downfall were in autumn 1993, when several western newspapers ran articles on Caritas predicting its failure. At the same time, more and more Romanian newspapers published stories on it. In a press conference in September 1993, president Iliescu predicted its demise, noting that anyone with an elementary education could predict that anything which gives eightfold returns in three months cannot last.

There were discussions in parliament on banning such schemes. The state-controlled Romanian Television ran a negative report on Caritas, which indicated that it might have problems with the state.

After this, the operations stopped for two days, initially explained as a computer error. Stoica tried to show that everything was fine by opening a large supermarket in Cluj-Napoca. Although Caritas opened new branches in more cities, it failed to gather enough money to continue its activity and it was not able to pay back money for those who deposited after July 5.

In February 1994, Stoica claimed Caritas was not dead, just reorganizing itself. Soon it again announced a temporary cessation of activities, blaming the government. Stoica announced the termination of activities on May 19, 1994, saying his staff was trying to find a way to return the money to some of the depositors.

Stoica was sentenced in 1995 by the Cluj Courthouse to seven years in prison for fraud, but he appealed and it was reduced to two years; then he went on to the Supreme Court of Justice and the sentence was reduced to one and a half years. He has been free since June 14, 1996. The trials between the depositors and the Caritas company were still under way .

<text>U-matic or -inch Type E Helical Scan or [[SMPTE]] E is an analogue recording videocassette format first shown by Sony in prototype in October 1969, and introduced to the market in September 1971. It was among the first video formats to contain the videotape inside a cassette, as opposed to the various reel-to-reel or open-reel formats of the time. The videotape is wide, so the format is often known as &quot;three-quarter-inch&quot; or simply &quot;three-quarter&quot;, compared to open reel videotape formats in use, such as type C videotape and quadruplex videotape.

Unlike most other cassette-based tape formats, the supply and take-up reels in the cassette turn in opposite directions during playback, fast-forward, and rewind: one reel would run clockwise while the other would run counter-clockwise. A locking mechanism integral to each cassette case secures the tape hubs during transportation to keep the tape wound tightly on the hubs. Once the cassette is taken off the case, the hubs are free to spin. A spring-loaded tape cover door protects the tape from damage; when the cassette is inserted into the VCR, the door is released and is opened, enabling the VCR mechanism to spool the tape around the spinning video drum. Accidental recording is prevented by the absence of a red plastic button fitted to a hole on the bottom surface of the tape; removal of the button disabled recording.

== Development ==

As part of its development, in March 1970, Sony, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. (Panasonic), Victor Co. of Japan (JVC), and five non-Japanese companies reached agreement on unified standards. The first U-matic VCRs were released by Sony in 1971.

The first generation of U-matic VCRs are large devices, approximately wide, deep, and high, requiring special shelving, and had mechanical controls limited to Record, Play, Rewind, Fast-Forward, Stop and Pause (with muted video on early models). Later models sported improvements such as chassis sized for EIA 19-inch rack mounting, with sliding rack rails for compressed storage in broadcast environments, solenoid control mechanics, jog-shuttle knob, remote controls, Vertical Interval Time Code (VITC), longitudinal time code, internal cuts-only editing controls, &quot;Slo-Mo&quot; slow-motion playback, and Dolby audio noise reduction.

U-matic was named after the shape of the tape path when it was threaded around the helical-scan video head drum, which resembles the letter U. Betamax uses a similar type of &quot;B-load&quot; as well. Recording time is limited to one hour. It initially had a resolution of 250 lines. Signals are recorded onto the tape using Frequency modulation (FM modulation).

U-matic saw two revisions to improve its image quality. The first was &quot;High-band&quot; or &quot;Hi-band&quot;, with the original version becoming known as &quot;Low-band&quot; or &quot;Lo-band&quot;. This was followed by SP (superior performance). Both revisions increased the FM carrier frequencies, increasing the available bandwidth on the tape, hence increasing image quality and the number of resolution lines. U-matic SP also introduced chrome dioxide tape. U-matic Hi-band recordings will play in black and white in U-matic Lo-band machines.

PAL U-matic Hi-band increased the FM carrier frequency to 4.8-6.4 MHz, while U-matic SP increased it even further to 5.6-7.2 MHz, while increasing the color carrier frequency to 924 kHz.

U-matic tape moves at 3.75 inches per second, and has a tape writing speed of 8.54 meters per second for PAL or 10.26 for NTSC. This means that the heads on the drums of U-matic VCRs move across the tape at one of those speeds. The drum has two heads, both of which are used for recording video. The drum spins at 1500 rpm for PAL or 1800 rpm for NTSC. U-matic Lo-band when recording NTSC has a sync tip frequency of 3.8 MHz, a peak white frequency of 5.4 MHz, and a color carrier frequency of 688.373 kHz. NTSC U-matic SP has a peak white frequency of 7 MHz.

When recording PAL, U-matic Hi-band had a sync tip frequency of 4.8 MHz, a peak white frequency of 6.4 MHz, and a color carrier frequency of 983.803 kHz, while U-matic Hi-Band SP had a sync tip frequency of 5.6 MHz, and a peak white frequency of 7.2 MHz, retaining the color carrier frequency of regular Hi-band.

Some of the standards that define the format, are:
* SMPTE 21M-1997 Video Recording – 3/4-in Type E Helical Scan – Records
* SMPTE 22M-1997 Video Recording – 3/4-in Type E Helical Scan – Cassette
* SMPTE 31M-2003 Television Analog Recording - 3/4-in Type E – Small Video Cassette
* RP 87-1999 (Archived 2004) Reference Carrier Frequencies, Preemphasis Characteristic and Audio and Control Signals for 3/4-in Type E Helical-Scan Video Tape Cassette Recording

==Introduction==

At the 1971 introduction of the first model of U-Matic VCR, the VO-1600, Sony originally intended it to be a videocassette format oriented at the consumer market, even including a VHF/UHF TV tuner built into the model for home television recording. This proved to be something of a failure, because of the high manufacturing cost and resulting retail price of the format&#x27;s first VCRs. But the cost was affordable enough for industrial and institutional customers, where the format was very successful for such applications as business communication and educational television. As a result, Sony shifted U-Matic&#x27;s marketing to the industrial, professional, and educational sectors.

U-Matic saw even more success from the television broadcast industry in the mid-1970s, when a number of local TV stations and national TV networks used the format when its first portable model, the Sony VO-3800, was released in 1974. This model ushered in the era of ENG, or electronic news gathering, which eventually made obsolete the previous 16mm film cameras normally used for on-location television news gathering. Film required developing which took time, compared to the instantly available playback of videotape, making faster breaking news possible.

== Models ==

U-matic was also available in a smaller cassette size, officially known as U-Matic S. U-Matic S was developed as a more portable version of U-Matic, to be used in smaller-sized S-format recorders such as the aforementioned Sony VO-3800, as well as the later VO-4800, VO-6800, VO-8800, BVU-50, BVU-100, BVU-110, and BVU-150 models from Sony, among others from Sony, Panasonic, JVC and other manufacturers. To minimize weight and bulk in the field, portable recorders had an external AC power supply, or could be operated from rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. S-format tapes could be played back in older top-loading standard U-Matic decks with the aid of an adapter (the KCA-1 from Sony) which fitted around an S-sized tape; newer front-loading machines can accept S-format tapes directly, as the tapes have a slot on the underside that rides along a tab.

The standard cassette employed only one flange for each reel - top flange on the pickup reel and bottom flange on the supply reel. This allowed the reels to overlap like in Compact Cassette, making the design more space-efficient. JVC explored similar approach for an early version of VHS cassette, but abandoned it in favor of full-flanged cassette, because such an arrangement created unnecessary friction between the edge of the tape and the inner surface of the cassette. In the U-Matic cassette friction was reduced by the reels, having overlapping flanges, rotating in the opposite direction. Nevertheless, the U-Matic S cassette acquired traditional double-flange reels, which reduced the amount of tape that could be loaded, and as such, the duration of recording. U-Matic S tapes had a maximum recording time of 20 minutes, and large ones 1-hour, although some tape manufacturers such as 3M came out with 30-minute S-tapes and 75-minute large cassettes (and DuPont even managed 90-minute tapes) by using a thinner tape. It was the U-Matic S-format decks that ushered in the beginning of ENG, or electronic news gathering.

The price point of the VO family was primarily oriented toward educational, corporate and industrial fields, featured unbalanced audio connectors, and did not typically include SMPTE time code (although one or two companies offered after-market modification services to install longitudinal time code). The VO-3800 was largely metal, which made the unit heavy, but still technically portable. The VO-4800 had the same functionality as the VO-3800, but at a greatly reduced weight and size, by replacing many components with plastic. The VO-6800 added the improvement of a long, thin battery standard (&quot;candy bars&quot;) that permitted storage of the batteries in a trouser pocket. Common model numbers for these batteries were NP-1, NP-1A and NP-1B. The VO-8800 was the last of the portable VO series to be produced by Sony, and featured solenoid-controlled transport.

The Sony BVU family (Broadcast Video U-matic) added longitudinal and vertical interval SMPTE time code, balanced audio XLR connectors, and heavier-duty transport features. The BVU-50 enabled recording in the field but not playback, and the BVU-100 permitted both recording and playback in the field. Portable recorders were connected to the camera with a multi-conductor cable terminated with multi-pin connectors on each end. The cable carried bi-directional audio, video, synchronisation, record on/off control, and power. Early studio and all portable U-Matic VCRs had a drawer-type mechanism which required the tape to be inserted, followed by manual closure of the drawer (a &quot;top-loading&quot; mechanism). Later studio VCRs accepted the cassette from a port opening and the cassette was pulled into and seated in the transport (a &quot;front-loading&quot; mechanism).

Some U-Matic VCRs could be controlled by external video editing controllers, such as the cuts-only Sony RM-440 for linear video editing systems. Sony and other manufacturers, such as Convergence, Calaway, and CMX Systems, produced A/B roll systems, which permitted two or more VCRs to be controlled and synchronised for video dissolves and other motion effects, integration of the character generator, audio controllers and digital video effects (DVE).

In 1976, Sony introduced the semi backwards-compatible &quot;High-band&quot; or &quot;Hi-band&quot; revision, with the introduction of the top-loading BVU-200. The original version became known as &quot;Low-band&quot; or &quot;Lo-band&quot;. U-matic Hi-band had an improved colour recording system and lower noise levels. BVU gained immense popularity in ENG and location programme-making, spelling the end of 16 mm film in everyday production. By the early 1990s, Sony&#x27;s Betacam SP format had all but replaced BVU outside of corporate and budget programme making. With BVU-870, Sony made a final revision to U-matic, by further improving the recording system and giving it the same &quot;SP&quot; suffix as Betacam. SP had a horizontal resolution of 330 lines. The BVU-800 series Y-FM carrier frequency was upped to 1.2 MHz giving it wider bandwidth. The BVU-800 series also added Dolby audio noise reduction. Sony&#x27;s BVU-900 series were the last broadcast U-matic VTRs made by Sony. First-generation U-matic SP and Beta-SP recordings were hard to tell apart, but despite this the writing was on the wall for U-matic, due to intrinsic problems with the format.

== Problems ==
A recurring problem with the format was damage to the videotape caused by prolonged friction of the spinning video drum heads against a paused videocassette. The drum would rub oxide off the tape or the tape would wrinkle; when the damaged tape was played back, a horizontal line of distorted visual image would ascend in the frame, and audio would drop out. Manufacturers attempted to minimize this issue with schemes in which the tape would loosen around the spinning head or the head would stop spinning after resting in pause mode for a pre-determined period of time.

The format video image also suffered from head-switching noise, a distortion of the image in which a section of video at the bottom of the video frame would be horizontally askew from the larger portion.

The format also had difficulties with reproducing the red color on the NTSC color standard, and red images would be noisier than other colors in the spectrum. For this reason, on-camera talent was discouraged from wearing red clothing that would call attention to technical shortcomings.

Copying video from one U-matic VCR to another compromised playback reliability, and levels of head-switching noise, chroma smearing, and chroma noise compounded with every generation. These issues motivated videotape editors and engineers to use work-arounds to minimise this degradation. A time-base corrector (TBC) could be used to regenerate the sync tip portion of the video signal sent to the &quot;recording&quot; VCR, improving playback reliability. The &quot;dub&quot; cable, more formally called &quot;demodulated&quot; (or &quot;demod&quot; for short), was a multi-conductor cable that circumvented a portion of the video circuitry, minimising amplification noise.

== Uses ==

For synchronisation to broadcast or post-production editing house genlock systems, U-Matic VCRs required a time base corrector (TBC). Some TBCs had a drop-out compensation (DOC) circuit which would hold lines of video in temporary digital memory to compensate for oxide drop-out or wrinkle flaws in the videotape, however the DOC circuits required several cables and expert calibration for use.

U-matic tapes were also used for easy transport of filmed scenes for dailies in the days before VHS, DVD, and portable hard drives. Several movies have surviving copies in this form. The first rough cut of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, for example (the raw version of what became &quot;Apocalypse Now Redux&quot;), survived on three U-Matic cassettes.

Audio quality was compromised due to the use of longitudinal audio tape heads in combination with slow tape speed. Sony eventually implemented Dolby noise reduction circuitry (using Dolby C) to improve audio fidelity.

The 2012 film &quot;No&quot;, set in 1980s Chile, used U-matic tape for filming.

==Digital audio==

U-matic was also used for the storage of digital audio data. Most digital audio recordings from the 1980s were recorded on U-matic tape via a Sony PCM-1600, -1610, or -1630 PCM adaptor. These devices accepted stereo analogue audio, digitized it, and generated &quot;pseudo video&quot; from the bits, storing 96 bits—three stereo pairs of 16-bit samples—as bright and dark regions along each scan line. (On a monitor the &quot;video&quot; looked like vibrating checkerboard patterns.) This could be recorded on a U-matic recorder. This was the first system used for mastering audio compact discs in the early 1980s. The famous compact disc 44.1 kHz sampling rate was based on a best-fit calculation for PAL and monochrome NTSC video&#x27;s horizontal line period and rate and U-matic&#x27;s luminance bandwidth. On playback, the PCM adapter converted the light and dark regions back into bits. Glass masters for audio CDs were made via laser from the PCM-1600&#x27;s digital output to a photoresist- or dye-polymer-coated disc. This method was common until the mid-1990s.

== Decline of use ==

U-matic is no longer used as a mainstream television production format, but it found lasting appeal as a cheap, well specified, and hard-wearing format. The format permitted many broadcast and non-broadcast institutions to produce television programming on an accessible budget, spawning programming distribution, classroom playback, etc. At its peak popularity, U-matic recording and playback equipment was manufactured by Sony, Panasonic and JVC, with many spin-off product manufacturers, such as video edit controllers, time base correctors, video production furniture, playback monitors and carts, etc.

Many television facilities the world over still have a U-matic recorder for archive playback of material recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. For example, the US Library of Congress facility in Culpeper, Virginia, holds thousands of titles on U-matic video as a means of providing access copies and proof for copyright deposit of old television broadcasts and films.

<doc id="1286350" wikidata="Q5677767" url="?curid=1286350" title="Harveys Supermarkets">
<text>J.M. Harvey Co., LLC, under the trade name Harveys Supermarkets, is an American supermarket chain with stores in Georgia and Florida. The majority of the Harveys stores are between 18,000 and .

Based in Jacksonville, Florida, Southeastern Grocers controlled the chain until 2024, when it sold Harveys Supermarket and Winn-Dixie to Aldi, spun off Fresco y Más, and closed its activities.

==History==
The chain was founded by J. M. and Iris Harvey in Nashville, Georgia, in 1924. Their son, Joe, took over the chain in 1950. Harveys had grown from a total of 22 stores in 1981 to 43 stores in 2003. Harveys growth during the 1990s was primarily through acquisitions.

===Acquisition By Delhaize===
In 2003, Delhaize Group acquired the then 43-store strong Harveys chain for $26.1 million. After the acquisition, Harveys and sister chain Food Lion engaged in a number of synergies: over a dozen Food Lion stores were converted to Harveys; Procurement, supply chain, and back office functions were handled by Food Lion; and while Harveys management was still headquartered in Nashville, Georgia, they answered to Food Lion management in Salisbury, North Carolina.

In May 2006, Harveys announced they would close their warehouse and distribution center in Nashville, Georgia, to trim costs and enhance the resources of Food Lion, affecting about 200 employees in the process. Food Lion would support Harveys stores through their own distribution centers in South Carolina and Florida.

===Acquisition By BI-LO Holdings, LLC/Southeastern Grocers===
In May 2013, Harveys was sold along with sister supermarket chains Sweetbay and Reid&#x27;s to BI-LO Holdings, LLC for $265 million. In September 2013, Southeastern Grocers was created by Lone Star Funds as the new parent company for BI-LO, Harveys, and Winn-Dixie. The new parent company then filed to raise as much as $500 million in a U.S. initial public offering. On August 19, 2014, Southeastern Grocers withdrew their IPO filing with the SEC, aborting the process of listing the stock for public sale.

===2018 Bankruptcy===
On March 15, 2018, Southeastern Grocers announced they would file a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 by the end of March. According to the company, the restructuring would decrease overall debt levels by over $500 million. Under this plan, 94 stores across the BI-LO, Fresco y Más, Harveys, and Winn-Dixie brands would close.

On March 28, 2018, Southeastern agreed to sell three BI-LO locations in South Carolina along with three Harveys locations in Georgia to three independent Piggly Wiggly store owners. The deals are in conjunction with the restructuring support agreement revealed by Southeastern Grocers.

In May 2018, Southeastern Grocers restructuring plan was confirmed by a U.S. Bankruptcy judge in Delaware. At the end of that month, Southeastern Grocers announced that it had completed its financial restructuring and was emerging from bankruptcy. As part of the restructuring, $522 million in debt was exchanged for equity in Southeastern Grocers, though it was not announced who was receiving the equity shares. Southeastern Grocers exited bankruptcy with 575 stores in seven states, down from 704 locations. They also announced a planned remodels of 100 stores in 2018.

==Harveys Today==
The Harveys brand continued to adjust under the Southeastern Grocers watch. In June 2014, soon after the acquisition of the former Delhaize stores was complete, three Winn-Dixie stores in the Albany, Georgia, area were converted to the Harveys banner. At the same time, seven Harveys stores in Georgia were converted over to the Winn-Dixie banner. These stores converted included three in Brunswick, two in Valdosta and one in Saint Marys.

In May 2016, Southeastern unveiled its new Harveys Supermarket store concept at a former Winn-Dixie location in Jacksonville, Florida. Two months later, Southeastern Grocers rebranded an existing BI-LO location in Charlotte, North Carolina, to the Harveys banner. This became the first North Carolina location for the Harveys brand.

In November 2016, Southeastern Grocers continued the Harveys expansion by converting 16 Winn-Dixie and BI-LO stores to the Harveys Supermarket banner. These included two BI-LO locations in Augusta, Georgia, two additional Charlotte, North Carolina, BI-LO locations, three BI-LO locations in Columbia, South Carolina, and a BI-LO location in Greenwood, South Carolina. An additional seven Winn-Dixie Florida locations were converted with six of them in Jacksonville. Fifty-five other Harveys locations, mainly in Georgia, were upgraded at the same time.

In May 2017, Southeastern Grocers announced the closing of a Harveys store in Albany, Georgia, as part of a corporate-wide closure of 23 locations along with the elimination of some department lead roles at stores.

In July 2017, it was announced that Southeastern Grocers would debut the Harveys brand in the Central and West Florida markets with the conversion of 7 Winn-Dixie stores with the conversions taking place in early August. In October, Southeastern announced that three more West Florida Winn-Dixie stores would be converted to the Harveys brand in November, growing their store count to 80.

In February 2019, Southeastern announced plans to shut down 22 units, including two Harveys locations in Florida and South Carolina. 

On June 9, 2020, Southeastern Grocers sold 16 Harveys Supermarkets, along with 46 BI-LO locations, to Ahold Delhaize subsidiary Food Lion; the deal also included transitioning BI-LO&#x27;s Mauldin, South Carolina, distribution center over to Ahold Delhaize USA Distribution, LLC. Both of these closed in the first half of 2021, at which point over 60 stores began to transition to the Food Lion banner. 

In 2023, expecting to conclude the deal the following year, Aldi announced that it would buy the chain and maintain its units under the Harveys or Aldi banners.

In March 2024, it was reported that Aldi had completed its purchase of Harveys Supermarkets.

==Locations==
As of February 2022, there are 25 Harveys Supermarkets located in Georgia and Florida.

<text>Newton South High School is one of two public high schools in the city of Newton, Massachusetts, United States, the other being Newton North. 

==History and student life==
By the late 1950s, Newton&#x27;s sole public high school, Newton High, grew to 3,000 students. Newton built a new school, Newton South, in the Oak Hill neighborhood in 1960. The school is organized into four student houses—Cutler, Goldrick, Goodwin, and Wheeler—each with a student commons.

Newton South was the first public high school to create a gay–straight alliance in the United States in the early 1990s.

Newton South features two award-winning student newspapers, &quot;Denebola&quot; and &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Roar&quot;.

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Newton South as the 446th-best high school in the country and 20th-best in the Massachusetts in its 2020 rankings.

The school is part of the Newton Public School District. 

===Public attention===
The school gained notoriety in 2002 for its &quot;Senior Scavenger Hunt&quot;, a student-organized contest that featured theft, vandalism, illegal drug use, and various sexual acts committed by the graduating seniors in exchange for points.

On February 8, 2007, the Newton South chapter organized a Darfur Benefit Concert with the well known band, State Radio, raising over $230,000 for Save the Children and the Genocide Intervention Network.

<doc id="1286362" wikidata="Q2496697" url="?curid=1286362" title="Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?">
<text>&quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; is the twenty-fourth and final episode of the third season of the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (and the &quot;de facto&quot; season four premiere). It originally aired on Fox in the United States on August 27, 1992. It was originally slated to air as the season premiere for the next season, but Fox decided to air it earlier to promote the series premiere of &quot;Martin&quot;.

In the episode, Homer is awarded US$2,000 in compensation after radiation from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant causes him to become sterile. Homer&#x27;s half-brother, Herb, now poor and homeless, hatches a plan to regain his wealth. Homer loans him $2,000 to develop a new product that translates baby babbling into speech that parents can understand. Herb&#x27;s invention is hugely successful, allowing him to regain his fortune.

The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Rich Moore. Danny DeVito guest starred as Herb, with Joe Frazier making a cameo as himself. &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; was the second time Herb appeared on the show; he had previously appeared in the season two episode &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, in which Homer designing an overpriced monstrosity as the new car of Herb&#x27;s company bankrupts Herb. The producers decided to create this episode in part because many fans were unhappy about the sad ending to &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;.

&quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; received positive reviews from critics and DeVito was praised for his guest performance.

==Plot==
A routine physical exam at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant reveals that Homer is sterile after being exposed to radiation. Fearing a lawsuit, Mr. Burns gives $2,000 prize in exchange for signing a legal waiver freeing the plant of all liability. Homer is suspicious; Burns hastily explains that he is awarding Homer the inaugural Montgomery Burns Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Excellence, complete with an extravagant ceremony hosted by Joe Frazier.

Homer plans to buy a vibrating chair as a replacement for the living room couch, which Bart and Lisa have broken while goofing off. Homer&#x27;s half-brother Herb, broke and homeless because of Homer, learns of the prize Homer has won and stows away on a train to Springfield, planning to persuade Homer to lend him the money. Upon seeing Homer in person, Herb punches him in the face out of anger over the loss of Herb&#x27;s company. After hearing a baby&#x27;s cries, Herb devises a plan to regain his wealth by designing a device that can translate baby talk into coherent speech so parents can respond to their infants&#x27; needs. His invention is an instant success that makes him rich again.

Herb repays Homer&#x27;s loan and buys several gifts for the Simpsons, including a new washer and dryer for Marge, an NRA membership for Bart, and a monthly book club subscription for Lisa. Herb forgives Homer for ruining him earlier and buys him the vibrating chair to reward his faith and generosity, and the Simpsons use the original $2,000 to replace the broken couch.

==Production==
The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Rich Moore. The reason for the late broadcast on August 27, 1992 (the season usually ends in May) was because the Fox network decided to add an additional episode to the season and show it during the summer to become &quot;the biggest network&quot; on television. As a result, the writers, animators, and producers had to work longer hours than normal to be able to finish the extra episode, which became &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; The idea for the scenes involving the Spinemelter 2000 originated when one of the writers bought a vibrating chair to relax after working 20 hours a day on the episode.

The decision to make another episode with Herb was reached due to many viewers being unhappy about the sad ending to the previous episode &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; (season two, 1991), in which Homer causes Herb to become bankrupt. It was decided that an episode would be created in which he regains his fortune. Originally the producers were going to end the original Herb episode with Herb saying &quot;I have an idea!&quot; at the end of it, but they decided to flesh this out into a full story, which resulted in &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot;. In addition, the producers decided that they enjoyed Danny DeVito&#x27;s guest starring as Herb in &quot;Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, so they brought him back. Cast member Hank Azaria noted that DeVito was less enthusiastic in his second performance as Herb: &quot;Some people come in and you can tell they kind of regretted doing it. The second time, Danny DeVito was like &#x27;Yeah, yeah, yeah, let&#x27;s get it over with.&#x27; He did a great job, but he didn&#x27;t enjoy the process.&quot;

In part because the writers had so many ideas for what Herb would invent, the original script of &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; ended up being too long at fifty-three pages. During the same time as the voices were being recorded, the writers cut some of the material. One of the cut scenes featured Herb running after a train in order to ask which Springfield it was going to; the writers, however, decided to include a similar scene in a later episode, &quot;Burns, Baby Burns&quot; (season eight, 1996). There was originally a joke in the script that predicted the breakup of the Soviet Union; however, as the Soviet Union already broke up between the writing of the script and the air time, the joke was scrapped.

Boxer Joe Frazier guest starred in the episode as himself. Show runner Al Jean has stated that Frazier was hard to record, especially him saying the word &quot;excellence&quot; in the title of Mr. Burns&#x27; award. George Meyer, who directed Frazier, commented that he got the pronunciation right after almost 20 takes. The original script for &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; included a scene in which town drunk Barney Gumble knocked out Frazier, who was a former world heavyweight champion. Frazier&#x27;s son, however, objected to this scene: &quot;Yes, I suggested that they change that. [Frazier] was a world champion, and a world champion does not get knocked out. My dad has only been knocked down twice, and that was by George Foreman.&quot; Originally, the producers wanted Foreman to appear instead of Frazier, but he was unavailable.

The award that Homer received was based on the Emmy Award, but with a statue of Burns instead. At some point during the season, Todd Flanders&#x27;s role as the younger brother was switched; before, he had been the smaller of the two, but since this episode, he has been the elder. The scene in which Homer flips on the switch that turns on the Christmas sign was, in contrast to the rest of the episode, created via Animatics. For several years, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; used a series of flashbacks to reflect on the scene in which the character is presently talking about. For instance, in this episode, when Marge talks about getting a new washing machine, the camera cuts to the washing machines vibrating wildly. However, when &quot;Family Guy&quot; began imitating the same style, the producers stopped the idea soon after. The scene where Homer bemoans Herb&#x27;s treatment of him to Marge in bed was taken from another episode because they decided to explain the plot a bit more.

==Cultural references==
The title of the episode and the plot, to a certain extent, is a reference to the common expression &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot;, a song of the Great Depression that has been recorded multiple times by artists since. Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s Little Tramp can be seen among the bums. He is eating a shoe, a reference to a scene in &quot;The Gold Rush&quot; (1925). A bum mutters to Herb: &quot;Yeah, I used to be rich. I owned Mickey Mouse Massage Parlors, then those Disney sleazeballs shut me down.&quot; Another hobo says he was responsible for New Coke. While Homer relaxes in the Spinemelter chair at the store he sees images in his head that are a reference to the penultimate scenes of &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968). In one scene, Homer reminisces about sitting on his old couch while watching &quot;Dallas&quot;, Hands Across America, the fall of the Berlin Wall and &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot;. Lisa mentions seeing an ad for &quot;The Great Books of Western Civilization&quot; in &quot;New Republic For Kids&quot;: &quot;Each month a new classic will be delivered to our door: &quot;Paradise Regained&quot;, &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, Melville&#x27;s twin classics &quot;Omoo&quot; and &quot;Typee&quot;.&quot; The last scene, where Herb presents the Simpsons family with gifts for their trust in him is a reference to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), in which the Wizard presents Dorothy, the Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Man with gifts. Herb gets Lisa that subscription to The Great Books of Western Civilization, telling her &quot;You&#x27;ll receive a new one every month, from &quot;Beowulf&quot; to &quot;Less than Zero&quot;&quot;, starting with Edith Wharton&#x27;s &quot;Ethan Frome&quot;. She enthuses: &quot;Finally, a copy of &quot;Ethan Frome&quot; to call my own.&quot;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; finished 31st in the ratings for the week of August 24–30, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 10.7, equivalent to approximately 9.76 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week following the 44th Primetime Emmy Awards.

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book &quot;I Can&#x27;t Believe It&#x27;s a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide&quot; were positive of the episode, particularly praising the scenes involving Homer&#x27;s fixation for vibrating chairs and Maggie speaking to the family through the baby translator. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s David Eklid said episodes such as &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot;, &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Pony&quot; and &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot; make season three &quot;pretty much the best season of any television show, ever.&quot; The episode&#x27;s reference to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; was named the 27th greatest film reference in the history of the show by &quot;Total Film&quot;&#x27;s Nathan Ditum.Herb&#x27;s reappearance was praised by reviewers of the episode. Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed stated that Herb is &quot;a perfect sibling for [...] Homer, with the two characters having a harmonious give-and-take comedic style. Indeed there isn&#x27;t a great deal of substance in John Swartzwelder&#x27;s script, but it is a great deal of fun with plenty of laughs to more than make up for this flaw. There is also a humorous cameo by Joe Frazier that puts a nice accent on the show.&quot;

Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict gave &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; a near-perfect score of 99/100, praising it for &quot;the jokes about what the money could be spent on (including one of the best bits ever in a Simpsons episode—Homer sitting on a high-tech vibrating chair) and a good impetus to reintroduce Herb.&quot;

Several critics have praised DeVito&#x27;s appearance. DVD Movie Guide&#x27;s Colin Jacobson said he enjoyed seeing what happened to Herb, &quot;and DeVito&#x27;s performance helps make the show more successful; they really need to bring him back one of these days.&quot; Tom Adair of &quot;The Scotsman&quot; considers &quot;Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?&quot; to be a classic episode of the show, in part because of DeVito&#x27;s performance. Gibron also liked the choice of DeVito as the voice of Herb as he is &quot;almost the antithesis of everything Dan Castellaneta does with Homer vocally.&quot; Nate Ditum ranked DeVito&#x27;s performance as the tenth best guest appearance in the show&#x27;s history.

<doc id="1286367" wikidata="Q6399144" url="?curid=1286367" title="Khajjiar">
<text>Khajjiar is a hill station near the town of Chamba in Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh, India, located approximately from Dalhousie. It lies on a small plateau with a stream-fed lake at its center. Surrounded by the meadows and forests, Khajjiar lies about 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) above sea level in the foothills of the Dhauladhar ranges in the Western Himalayas. It is also part of the Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary.

Khajjiar can be reached from Dalhousie, the nearest major town. The area features a unique combination of three ecosystems: lake, pasture, and forest.

==Mini Switzerland==

On 7 July 1992, Swiss envoy Willy P. Blazer, Vice-Counsellor and Head of the Chancery of Switzerland in India brought Khajjiar on the world tourism map by calling it &#x27;Mini Switzerland&#x27;. He also erected a sign featuring a yellow Swiss hiking footpath symbol, showing Khajjiar&#x27;s distance from the Swiss capital, Bern: &quot;. Khajjiar is one of 160 locations worldwide that bear a topographical resemblance to Switzerland. The envoy also took a stone from Khajjiar, which will form part of a stone collage around the Swiss Parliament to remind visitors that Khajjiar is the &#x27;Mini Switzerland of India&#x27;.

==Accommodation==
There is a hotel and several cottages run by HP Tourism in Khajjiar where tourists can stay. In addition, there are two rest houses, one each operated by the P.W.D. and the Forest Department. A few private hotels have also been established, although they do not match the aforementioned accommodations in terms of location and amenities.

==Travel==
Most tourists travel to Khajjiar by private or rented vehicles. Bus service to and from Khajjiar is limited, and timing changes according to local demands.

==Places of interest==
Popular activities in Khajjiar include walking around the lake and hiking through the pine forests. In winter, snow accumulation can reach up to 910 mm (3 feet) in height. The sloped terrain makes it a popular spot for families, and children can safely roll down to the lake. Other attractions include horse riding and paragliding, as well as a large Hanuman statue and a park.

===Dauladhar mountains===
Khajjiar features dense deodars, pines , and lush green meadows. It is situated at the base of the Dauladhar mountains, offering panoramic views of the peaks.

===Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary===

The Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary is a wildlife sanctuary home to a wide variety of flora and fauna. It is densely covered with deodar and fir trees, making it a popular spot for picnics and trekking.

===Khajjiar Lake===

Khajjiar Lake is a small lake surrounded by a saucer-shaped meadow and a floating island. The growth of a weed called vacha has made the earth spongy. Over time, the banks have become covered by a thick layer of earth formed by years of dust settling on the weeds.

===Khajji Nag temple===
A little away from the lake stands the Khajji Nag Temple, built in the 12th century CE by Prithvi Singh, the king of Chamba. The temple features a golden dome, also known as Golden Devi Temple. Inside &quot;mandapa,&quot; one can see the images of the Pandavas and the defeated Kauravas hanging from the roof of the circumambulatory path. The sanctum of the temple is carved from wood. This temple is dedicated to snake (Nāga) worship, and it houses several snake idols. Additionally, there are idols of Shiva and the Goddess Hadimba.

==Trekking==
Khajjiar offers numerous trekking opportunities. One of the popular treks is from Khajjiar to Dainkund, a trial of easy to moderate difficulty. The trek begins from Khajjiar on the Dalhousie-Khajjiar road and ends at the Pholani Devi Temple in Dainkund. With a well-defined trail and moderate ascent, this trek for beginners and children. Along the way, trekkers are rewarded with stunning views and a beautiful camping spot.

<doc id="1286370" wikidata="Q6411517" url="?curid=1286370" title="King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys">
<text>King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Boys, also known as Camp Hill Boys, is a highly selective grammar school in Birmingham, United Kingdom. It is one of the most academically successful schools in the United Kingdom, currently ranked thirteenth among state schools. The name is retained from the previous location at Camp Hill in central Birmingham. The school moved to Vicarage Road in the suburb of Kings Heath in 1956, sharing a campus with its sister school (King Edward VI Camp Hill School for Girls), also formerly located in Camp Hill. Since September 2021 the current headmaster is Russell Bowen (a former Deputy Headteacher at Bishop Vesey&#x27;s Grammar School). It is a school which specialises in Science, Mathematics, and Applied Learning. In 2006, the school was assessed by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; as state school of the year. A Year 9 student was the 2011 winner of &quot;The Guardian&quot; Children&#x27;s Fiction Page and the Gold Award in the British Physics Olympiad was won by a King Edward VI Camp Hill student in September 2011. Camp Hill has also sent a boy to the International Chemistry Olympiad for 4 consecutive seasons (2019, 2018, 2017, 2018 2016). In the 2019 Chemistry Olympiad, Camp Hill received the second most gold certificates, coming second to St Paul&#x27;s School, London.

Ofsted inspections classify Camp Hill as an Outstanding Provider.

==History==

The school was founded in January 1883 and operated for two terms on the New Street site of King Edward&#x27;s School. It opened at its intended site at Camp Hill in Birmingham, near the city centre in September 1883, and moved to its current location, adjacent to Kings Heath Park, in 1956. Camp Hill Boys celebrated its 50-year jubilee in 2007 with a concert at Symphony Hall and the burial of a time capsule to be opened in another 50 years&#x27; time. It celebrated its House Centenary in 2007–8, with special events throughout the year that are not normally part of the house competition e.g. 5-a-side football.

==Admission==

Admission to Camp Hill is based upon success in the 11+ exam along with consideration of proximity to the school. It is also guaranteed that at least 25% of students admitted will be &quot;Pupil Premium Pupils&quot;, which are pupils whose families will have received free school meals at some point in the six years prior to application. Those living outside the catchment are able to attend Camp Hill, but only if they achieve a very high score in the 11+, and the quota for catchment pupils is not filled. This admissions policy replaced the previous one for admissions starting in 2020. Previously, no weight was attached to proximity to the school, and the quota for Pupil Premium Pupils was 20%.

===Admissions controversy 2020===
For the academic year starting in 2020, changes were made to admissions criteria by the Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI, the body which oversees the running of Camp Hill and the other King Edward schools in Birmingham. These changes were praised by some but proved controversial, with only 27% of those consulted supporting the plans. The changes increased admissions of Pupil Premium students to 25%, and due to the implementation of new catchment areas, admissions were restricted almost exclusively to a small area of city wards surrounding the school. Previously, applications were open to any UK citizen. In public consultation, many concerns were raised about the catchment areas, including that they may be designed to increase applications to the private school of King Edward&#x27;s School in Edgbaston, overseen by the same body, and that students from the wider West Midlands county, in areas such as Solihull, would find it near impossible to gain entry if not part of the Pupil Premium quota. These concerns were brushed aside by the Schools of King Edward VI, which explained them as affluent parents outside Birmingham being disappointed at their loss of entitlement to a grammar school place. The BBC and others published articles on the changes, but all largely ignored the concerns about the catchment area, focussing instead on the issue of increased admission of deprived pupils, and the perceived class struggle. Additionally, the 11+ entry score, which used to be different for each grammar school (with Camp Hill having the highest entry score) was lowered and made the same for every King Edward VI grammar school in Birmingham, which many say is a way of decreasing the school&#x27;s quality. In a FOI request to The King Edward Schools, release of the consultation responses, and information regarding reasons for the catchment plans, was refused. A complaint regarding conflicts of interest and concerns raised in the consultation was also brushed aside.

==Sports==

The sports played at Camp Hill are seasonal: rugby, and hockey in the Winter and Spring term, and in the Summer term: cricket, athletics and tennis are the main sports. Other sports include basketball, fitness, handball and football. In their games afternoon, Seniors (Years 11–13) especially the sixth form have the opportunity to play a wide variety of sports, including football, hockey, rugby, cricket, athletics, basketball, badminton, volleyball, table tennis, swimming, squash and tennis. All students are required to take part in certain house events (known as Standards) - cross-country, swimming and athletics. Other off-curriculum sports include fencing, swimming, and rugby and cricket training after school.

<doc id="1286372" wikidata="Q1192040" url="?curid=1286372" title="Politics of Europe">
<text>The politics of Europe deals with the continually evolving politics within the continent of Europe. It is a topic far more detailed than other continents due to a number of factors including the long history of nation states in the region as well as the modern day trend towards increased political unity amongst the European states.

The current politics of Europe can be traced back to historical events within the continent. Likewise geography, economy, and culture have contributed to the current political make-up of Europe.

Modern European politics is dominated by the European Union, since the fall of the Iron Curtain and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc of Communist states. After the end of the Cold War, the EU expanded eastward to include the former Communist countries. As of 31 January 2020, the EU has 27 member states.

However, there are a number of other international organizations made up predominantly of European nations, or explicitly claiming a European origin, including the 46-nation Council of Europe - the first post-war European organization, regarded as a fore-runner to the European Union - and the 57-nation Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which also includes the United States and Canada, as well as some central Asian states.

==Modern political climate==

Despite vastly improved relations between Russia and the Western European states since the end of the cold war, recently tensions have risen over the spread of &quot;Western&quot; organizations, particularly the EU and NATO, eastwards into former USSR states.

Many European states have either joined or stated their ambition to join the European Union.

There are few conflicts within Europe, although there remain problems in the Western Balkans, the Caucasus, Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom and the Basque Country in Spain.

According to 2007 data published in 2008 by Freedom House, the countries of Europe that cannot be classified liberal electoral democracies are Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia, Kazakhstan and Russia.

==International unions, organizations and alliances==
&quot;European states are members of a large number of international organizations, mainly economical, although several are political, or both. The main political unions are detailed below.&quot;

===European Union===

:&quot;Also see: Politics of the European Union, Enlargement of the European Union, Future enlargement of the European Union, Foreign relations of the European Union, Eastern Partnership&quot;

The European Union, or EU, is a political union of 27 states. It has many activities, the most important being a common single market, consisting of a customs union, a single currency (adopted by 20 of 27 member states), a Common Agricultural Policy and a Common Fisheries Policy. The European Union also has various initiatives to co-ordinate activities of the member states.

The EU, considered as a unit, has the second largest economy in the world with a nominal GDP of 14.9 trillion USD in 2020. There is also a trend of moving towards increased co-operation in terms of common defense and foreign policy.

The union has evolved over time from a primarily economic union to an increasingly political one. This trend is highlighted by the increasing number of policy areas that fall within EU competence; political power has tended to shift upwards from the member states to the EU. The further development of the political competencies of the EU is the subject of heavy debate within and between some member states.

===Council of Europe===
The Council of Europe brings together 46 European nations - the entire continent with the exception of Russia, which was expelled in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine, and Belarus. Founded in 1949, it is the oldest of the European organizations, embodying post-war hopes for peaceful co-operation, and is focused on the three statutory aims of promoting human rights, democracy and the rule of law. It does not deal with economic matters or defense. Its main achievement is the European Convention on Human Rights, which binds its 46 contracting parties to uphold the basic human rights of their citizens, and the Strasbourg Court which enforces it. The Council of Europe is regarded as a classic intergovernmental organization, with a parliamentary arm, and has none of the supranational powers of the EU – thus it could be compared to a regional version of the United Nations.

=== European Political Community ===
The European Political Community (EPC) was formed in October 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The group first met in October 2022 in Prague, with participants from 44 European countries, as well as representatives of the European Union. Russia and Belarus were not invited to the inaugural meeting. It is envisioned that the group will meet twice in plenary session twice each year.

=== Community of Democratic Choice ===

The Community of Democratic Choice (CDC) was formed in December 2005 at the primary instigation of Ukraine and Georgia, and composed of six Post-Soviet states (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and the three Baltic Assembly members of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and three other countries of Eastern and Central Europe (Slovenia, Romania and North Macedonia). The Black Sea Forum (BSF) is a closely related organization. Observer countries include Armenia, Bulgaria, and Poland.

Just like GUAM before it, this forum is largely seen as intending to counteract Russian influence in the area. This is the only international forum centered in the post-Soviet space in which the Baltic states also participate. The other three post-Soviet states in it are all members of GUAM.

=== Eurasian Economic Union ===

The Eurasian Economic Union is an economic union of post-Soviet states. The treaty aiming for the establishment of the EEU was signed on 29 May 2014 by the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, and came into force on 1 January 2015. Treaties aiming for Armenia&#x27;s and Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s accession to the Eurasian Economic Union were signed on 9 October 2014 and 23 December respectively. Armenia&#x27;s accession treaty came into force on 2 January 2015. Although Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s accession treaty did not come into force until May 2015, provided it has been ratified, it will participate in the EEU from the day of its establishment as an acceding state. Moldova and Tajikistan are prospective members.

=== Euronest Parliamentary Assembly ===
The Euronest Parliamentary Assembly is the inter-parliamentary forum in which members of the European Parliament and the national parliaments of Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia participate and forge closer political and economic ties with the European Union.

===Commonwealth of Independent States===
The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is a confederation consisting of 12 of the 15 states of the former Soviet Union, (the exceptions being the three Baltic states). Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organization and possesses coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking and security. The most significant issue for the CIS is the establishment of a full-fledged free trade zone and economic union between the member states, launched in 2005. It has also promoted co-operation on democratization and cross-border crime prevention. Additionally, six members of the CIS signed on to a collective security treaty known as the Collective Security Treaty Organization.

===Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations===

The post-Soviet disputed states of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Transnistria are all members of the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations which aims to forge closer integration among the members.

===North Atlantic Treaty Organization===

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a military alliance of mainly European states, together with the United States of America and Canada. The organization was founded as a collective security measure following Second World War.

This provision was intended so that if the Soviet Union launched an attack against the European allies of the United States, it would be treated as if it were an attack on the United States itself, which had the biggest military and could thus provide the most significant retaliation. However, the feared Soviet invasion of Europe never came. Instead, the provision was invoked for the first time in the treaty&#x27;s history on 12 September 2001, in response to the attacks of 11 September on the United States the day before.

===GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development===
GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development is a regional organization of four CIS states: Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova. The group was created as a way of countering the influence of Russia in the area, and it has received backing and encouragement from the United States . Though at one point it was generally considered to have stagnated, recent developments have caused speculation on the possible revival of the organization.

==Secessionist and devolutionary pressures==

These movements, seeking either autonomy or independence, vary greatly in their popular support and political profile, from fringe movements to mainstream campaigns.

===Belgium===
Two of Belgium&#x27;s political parties, the Vlaams Belang and New-Flemish Alliance, want Flanders, the northern part of the country, to become independent. Other Flemish parties plead for more regional autonomy. There is also a minor movement aiming at unification of Flanders with the Netherlands (see Greater Netherlands).

The autonomous Belgian region of Wallonia has an almost extinct movement seeking unification with France.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

Some inhabitants of Republika Srpska, one of the two constituent entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the other being the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina), the vast majority of them being ethnic Serbs, would opt for independence from Bosnia and Herzegovina and unification with Serbia. Republika Srpska comprises 49% of the territory of Bosnia and functions independently from the rest of the country in many spheres. Even though independence is not on the official government agenda, Serbian politicians from the region see a link between a possible future status of Kosovo and the status of Republika Srpska.

Croats, who remain a constituent nation of Bosnia and Herzegovina remain united with ethnic Bosniaks in a joint entity. Some Bosnian Croat politicians have proposed a separate constituent entity for Croats along the lines of the Republika Srpska.

===Denmark===
The Danish territories of Greenland and Faroe Islands have very strong independence movements. Greenland&#x27;s autonomy marks it as a constituent country under the Danish kingdom.

===Finland===
The Åland Islands has an autonomy. In 2003, the Ålandian separatist party Ålands Framtid was formed. There has not been much support for full independence since the Independence of Finland, but in the last years the support has slightly grown.

===France===

The Mediterranean island of Corsica has a significant and growing group calling for independence from France. There are also movements in the Brittany region of northern France who wish to regain independence lost in 1532, and in Savoy in the south east, which was annexed to France following a disputed referendum in 1860.

Parts of Navarre, Basque Country and Catalonia cross into France.

===Georgia===
South Ossetia declared independence on 28 November 1991, and Abkhazia on 23 July 1992. Following the brief 2008 South Ossetia war, both entities were partially recognised as independent by several UN member states. Georgia considers both &quot;occupied territories&quot; within its own borders. Both states participate in the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations.
===Germany===
The Bavaria Party is a small party that advocates Bavarian independence from Germany. 

The Free Saxons is a party in the German State of Saxony that supports Saxony independence from Germany.

===Italy===

Italy has been a unitary parliamentary republic since 1946, when the monarchy was abolished. The president of Italy, Sergio Mattarella since 2015, is Italy&#x27;s head of state. The president is elected for a single seven-year term by the Italian Parliament and regional voters in joint session. Italy has a written democratic constitution that resulted from a Constituent Assembly formed by representatives of the anti-fascist forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the liberation of Italy, in World War II.

Italy has a parliamentary government based on a mixed proportional and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly bicameral; each house has the same powers. The two houses: the Chamber of Deputies meets in Palazzo Montecitorio, and the Senate of the Republic in Palazzo Madama. A peculiarity of the Italian Parliament is the representation given to Italian citizens permanently living abroad: 8 Deputies and 4 Senators are elected in four distinct overseas constituencies. There are senators for life, appointed by the president &quot;for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field&quot;. Former presidents are &quot;ex officio&quot; life senators.
The prime minister of Italy is head of government and has executive authority, but must receive a vote of approval from the Council of Ministers to execute most policies. The prime minister and cabinet are appointed by the president, and confirmed by a vote of confidence in parliament. To remain as prime minister, one has to pass votes of confidence. The role of prime minister is similar to most other parliamentary systems, but they are not authorised to dissolve parliament. Another difference is that the political responsibility for intelligence is with the prime minister, who has exclusive power to coordinate intelligence policies, determine financial resources, strengthen cybersecurity, apply and protect State secrets, and authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad.

The major political parties are the Brothers of Italy, Democratic Party, and Five Star Movement. During the 2022 general election, these three and their coalitions won 357 of the 400 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, and 187 of 200 in the Senate. The centre-right coalition, which included Giorgia Meloni&#x27;s Brothers of Italy, Matteo Salvini&#x27;s League, Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s , and Maurizio Lupi&#x27;s Us Moderates, won most seats in parliament. The rest were taken by the centre-left coalition, which included the Democratic Party, the Greens and Left Alliance, Aosta Valley, More Europe, Civic Commitment, the Five Star Movement, Action – Italia Viva, South Tyrolean People&#x27;s Party, South calls North, and the Associative Movement of Italians Abroad.

===Moldova===
The eastern Moldovan region of Transnistria, which has a large ethnic Russian and Ukrainian population, has declared independence from Moldova on 2 September 1990 and is a member of the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations. Despite having no control over the region, the Moldovan government refuses to recognise this claim. There is a significant movement in Moldova and Romania aiming at the reunification of the two countries.

===Netherlands===
The Frisian National Party seeks more autonomy for Friesland without striving for complete independence. The preservation of Frisian culture is an important goal of the party.

===Romania===
Before the Treaty of Trianon after World War I, Transylvania belonged to Austria-Hungary, and it contains minorities of ethnic Hungarians who desire regional autonomy in the country.

===Russia===
Several of Russia&#x27;s regions have independence movements, mostly in the state&#x27;s north Caucasus border. The most notable of these are Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia, which have well supported guerrilla groups involved in open conflict with the Russian authorities.

Some Tatar people seek independence for the region of Tatarstan

===Serbia===
The status of Kosovo is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the Serbian (and previously, the Yugoslav) government and Kosovo&#x27;s largely ethnic-Albanian population. International negotiations began in 2006 to determine final status (&quot;See Kosovo status process&quot;). Kosovo declared independence on 17 February 2008.

===Spain=== 

Within Spain there are independence movements in some of the autonomous regions, notably the regions that have co-official languages such as Catalonia, the Basque Country, and Galicia. These are mostly peaceful but some, such as ETA and Terra Lliure, have used violent means.

===Ukraine===
The Ukrainian autonomous region of Crimea has been annexed by the Russian Federation. The eastern, majority Russophone part of the country is divided, and there are calls from some groups for the area to leave Ukraine and join Russia.

===United Kingdom===

In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party achieve between them around 40% of the vote at elections, with both parties supporting Northern Ireland leaving the United Kingdom and joining Ireland to create a United Ireland.

In Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP), the Scottish Greens, the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and the Alba Party all support Scottish independence. The SNP won an outright majority at the 2011 Scottish Parliament election and held the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, in the majority of Scottish voters backed remaining part of the United Kingdom by a 55% - 45% margin. There have, however, been revived calls for independence since the 2016 EU referendum, which saw both Scotland and Northern Ireland vote to Remain.

In Wales, Plaid Cymru and the Propel support Welsh independence. Polls generally show support for Welsh independence at around 20-25%.

In England, there are movements, such as the English Democrats, calling for a devolved English Parliament. There are also movements, such as the Wessex Regionalists, calling for devolution of power to the English regions. Movements seeking autonomy or independence include Mebyon Kernow in the peninsula of Cornwall.

As of 24 June 2016, the United Kingdom officially voted to leave the European Union. It is currently an ongoing process before the process of withdrawing officially begun on 29 March 2019. However, individual constituent countries within the United Kingdom, more specifically Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain in the European Union, prompting calls for another independence referendum in Scotland as well as raising the possibility of Irish reunification.

<text>Michael Anthony Muñoz (born August 19, 1958) is an American former professional football player who was an offensive tackle for 13 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the USC Trojans. In 2022, an ESPN panel named Muñoz as the greatest offensive tackle in NFL history. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Early life and college==
Muñoz went to Chaffey High School in Ontario, California. He played college football at the University of Southern California from 1976 to 1979. He also played baseball there, pitching for USC&#x27;s national championship team in 1978. The Trojans won a bowl game in all four of Muñoz&#x27;s seasons, including three victories in the Rose Bowl. However, injuries had cut Muñoz&#x27;s freshman and junior seasons short, forcing him to miss the team&#x27;s Rose Bowl wins in both years.

In the opening game of his senior year, Muñoz suffered torn knee ligaments and had to miss all of the remaining regular season games, though he did return for USC&#x27;s 17–16 Rose Bowl win over the previously undefeated Ohio State University on New Year&#x27;s Day in 1980. Muñoz could have requested a medical redshirt, enabling him to play as a 5th year senior in 1980, or simply focused on getting ready for the upcoming NFL draft, but he insisted on coming back for the Rose Bowl. &quot;I can’t imagine missing that experience with my guys,&quot; Muñoz explained. USC running back Charles White rushed for a Rose Bowl record 247 yards in the game, including six carries on an 83-yard drive to score the game winning touchdown with 1:32 left, mostly running to left weak side behind Muñoz. &quot;He played the whole ball game, he didn’t get hurt and we won,&quot; USC coach John Robinson said of Muñoz after the game. &quot;To me, that’s a perfect game. That’s one of the greatest things I’ve ever seen happen.&quot;

==Professional career==
===Cincinnati Bengals===
Muñoz was the third overall pick in the 1980 NFL draft by the Cincinnati Bengals. His selection was viewed as a major risk by many pundits since knee problems limited the 6 ft. 6 in., 280-pound Muñoz to just a combined 16 games in his final two college seasons.

Muñoz became a starter in his rookie season and remained a fixture at left tackle for the Bengals for 13 seasons and is considered one of the greatest offensive linemen - if not the greatest - in NFL history. Despite his history of injuries, Muñoz missed just three games during his first 12 seasons. His rigorous workout routine included working out in the weight room he had installed in his home and running three to four miles every day.
In addition to his talents as a blocker, Anthony Muñoz was also a capable receiver, notching seven receptions for 18 yards and scoring four touchdowns on tackle-eligible plays, including one in 1984 from rookie quarterback Boomer Esiason against the Cleveland Browns in Cleveland.

Muñoz played in two Super Bowls during his time with the Bengals, XVI and XXIII, both narrow losses to the San Francisco 49ers.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers/Retirement===
After missing much of the 1992 season battling knee and shoulder injuries, Muñoz attempted to play a 14th season with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but he was released before the season started and decided to retire shortly after.

===Legacy===
Muñoz was the Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1981, and 1988, and was awarded the NFL Players Association Lineman of the Year honors in 1981, 1985, 1988, and 1989. The NFL Alumni Association voted Munoz the Offensive Lineman of the Year four times (1987, 1989–1991). He won the Seagram&#x27;s Seven Crowns of Sports award for Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1981 and 1986.

At the time of his retirement, his Pro Bowl selections were tied with Tom Mack for the most ever by an offensive lineman in league history, and also set the Bengals franchise record. In 1994, Muñoz was named to the National Football League 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. In 1999, he was ranked #17 on &quot;Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 greatest football players and was the highest-ranked offensive lineman. In 2010, he was ranked #12 on the NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;The Top 100: NFL&#x27;s Greatest Players&quot; list and again was the highest-ranked offensive lineman.

In 1998, Muñoz was enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was the first exclusive Cincinnati Bengals player to be enshrined. Shortly after receiving the honor, Muñoz&#x27;s hometown of Ontario, California, renamed its Colony Park &quot;Anthony Muñoz Hall of Fame Park&quot;. The renaming ceremony was held on June 26, 1998, and was attended by Muñoz, his family, city officials, and Ontario residents.

Muñoz was a member of the Bengals inaugural Ring of Honor class in 2021.

While the Bengals have not officially retired it, they have not reissued the number 78 since Muñoz left the team.

==Movies and television==
Muñoz appeared in two motion pictures: 1980&#x27;s &quot;Borderline&quot; as &quot;Guatemalan&quot; and 1983&#x27;s &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (an Academy Award nominee for Best Picture) as &quot;Gonzalez&quot;.

From 1994 to 1995, Muñoz served as a color commentator on Fox Sports&#x27; NFL telecasts and has for many years been color commentator for TV broadcasts of Bengals&#x27; preseason games.

==Post-NFL career==
Since 1992, Muñoz has starred in a series of commercials for the Cincinnati-area furniture store Furniture Fair.

In 2002, the Anthony Muñoz Foundation was created to consolidate Muñoz&#x27;s charitable activities and encourages area individuals and businesses to &quot;...impact area youth mentally, physically and spiritually&quot;. In 2004, Muñoz served on a panel to select the year&#x27;s recipient of the Walter Payton Award. On November 14, 2012, Allstate dedicated a Hometown Hall of Famers plaque to Muñoz at Chaffey High School. On October 8, 2015, Muñoz received the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI) Medallion of Excellence for his contributions to the Hispanic community.

Muñoz attended a celebrity flag-football game at Candlestick Park, the last event before the demolition of the stadium in 2014. He describes the event:
The final touchdown pass, there were probably 30,000 people in that stadium viewing a bunch of old guys playing a flag football game, but to see (Montana) throw to (DeBartolo) for the final touchdown there and to hear the fans go crazy and to see the admiration from these former players like Ronnie Lott and Joe Montana; that to me was impressive... to me, that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s all about.

==Personal life==
Muñoz is of Mexican–American descent from the state of Chihuahua in Mexico and met his wife at USC; they married during his sophomore year in 1978. They have two children. His son Michael played offensive lineman at Tennessee where he was an All-America and went undrafted in 2005. His daughter, Michelle, played basketball at Tennessee and later transferred to Ohio State.

Muñoz is a Christian. He has said, “My faith is everything for me in my life, college, my 13 years playing in the NFL. Now that I&#x27;ve been retired from the NFL it continues to be the most important thing in my life.”

<doc id="1286383" wikidata="Q41248" url="?curid=1286383" title="Madrid bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics">
<text>Madrid 2012 was one of the five short-listed bids for the 2012 Summer Games. Madrid and New York City were the only two cities that opted to hold the 2012 Olympics that had never held a Summer Olympics before. The candidacy celebration, held on June 5, 2005 in central Madrid, included the carrying of the longest flag ever constructed through the streets of Madrid using over a thousand volunteering citizens of Madrid as well as a performance by pop singer Shakira. The celebration concluded with a fireworks show. The official slogan of the candidacy campaign was, &quot;&quot;Ready for you&quot;.&quot;

Madrid was eliminated in the third round of the ballot to select a host city at the 117th IOC sitting on July 6, 2005 in Singapore attended by Queen Sofia of Spain.

== International Olympic Committee evaluation report ==
The candidature scored the second highest mark of 8.3 in the IOC report, ranking first in six categories. Their evaluation was mostly favourable.
:Madrid has proposed humanist, sustainable, and environmentally friendly Games. Madrid is a modern city intent on using the Olympic project to further develop high-quality sports facilities and world-class infrastructure. The legacy plans are positive and the environmental benefits are significant. Venues have strong environmental features. While low in technology and transport, the budget appears to be reasonable and achievable. The concept and location of the Olympic Village within the East cluster are good. Some revision to the design and layout of the village would be required to ensure conformity with IOC requirements. Spain has a history of international leadership in sport for the disabled, and a Madrid Paralympic Games would give high priority to accessibility for athletes and the general public. Overall, Olympic plans are well integrated into the long-term development of the city. Madrid may need to use hotels in cities approximately one hour away by high-speed rail in order to meet Olympic requirements and spectator needs.

<text>James Travis Tritt (born February 9, 1963) is an American country singer-songwriter. He signed to Warner Bros. Records in 1989, releasing seven studio albums and a greatest hits package for the label between then and 1999. In the 2000s, he released three studio albums on Columbia Records and one for the now-defunct Category 5 Records. Seven of his albums (counting the Greatest Hits) are certified platinum or higher by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA); the highest-certified is 1991&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All About to Change&quot;, which is certified triple-platinum. Tritt has also charted more than 40 times on the Hot Country Songs charts, including five number ones—&quot;Help Me Hold On&quot;, &quot;Anymore&quot;, &quot;Can I Trust You with My Heart&quot;, &quot;Foolish Pride&quot;, and &quot;Best of Intentions&quot;—and 15 additional top ten singles. Tritt&#x27;s musical style is defined by mainstream country and Southern rock influences.

He has received two Grammy Awards, both for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals: in 1992 for &quot;The Whiskey Ain&#x27;t Workin&#x27;&quot;, a duet with Marty Stuart, and again in 1998 for &quot;Same Old Train&quot;, a collaboration with Stuart and nine other artists. He has received four awards from the Country Music Association and has been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1992.

==Early life==
James Travis Tritt was born on February 9, 1963, in Marietta, Georgia, to James and Gwen Tritt. He first took interest in singing after his church&#x27;s Sunday school choir performed &quot;Everything Is Beautiful&quot;. He received his first guitar at age 8 and taught himself how to play it; in the fourth grade, he performed &quot;Annie&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;King of the Road&quot; for his class, and later got invited to play for other classrooms in his school. At age 14, his parents bought him another guitar, and he learned more songs from his uncle, Sam Lockhart. Later on, Tritt joined his church band, which occasionally performed at other churches nearby.

Tritt began writing music while he was attending Sprayberry High School; his first song composition, entitled &quot;Spend a Little Time&quot;, was written about a girlfriend whom he had broken up with. He performed the song for his friends, one of whom complimented him on his songwriting skills. He also founded a bluegrass group with some of his friends and won second place in a local tournament for playing &quot;Mammas Don&#x27;t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys&quot;.

During his teenage years, Tritt worked at a furniture store, and later as a supermarket clerk. He lived with his mother after she and his father divorced; they remarried when he was 18. He worked at an air conditioning company while playing in clubs, but gave up the air conditioning job at the suggestion of one of his bandmates. Tritt&#x27;s father thought that he would not find success as a musician, while his mother thought that he should perform Christian music instead of country.

Through the assistance of Warner Bros. Records executive Danny Davenport, Tritt began recording demos. The two worked together for the next several years, eventually putting together a demo album called &quot;Proud of the Country&quot;. Davenport sent the demo to Warner Bros. representatives in Los Angeles, who in turn sent the demo to their Nashville division, which signed Tritt in 1987. Davenport also helped Tritt find a talent manager, Ken Kragen. At first, Kragen was not interested in taking an &quot;entry-level act&quot;, but decided to sign on as Tritt&#x27;s manager after Kragen&#x27;s wife convinced him.

==Musical career==

===1989–1991: &quot;Country Club&quot;===
Tritt&#x27;s contract with Warner Bros. meant that he was signed to record six songs, and three of them would be released as singles. According to the contract, he would not be signed on for a full album unless one of the three singles became a hit. His first single was &quot;Country Club&quot;. Recorded in late 1988 and released on August 7, 1989, the song spent 26 weeks on the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts, peaking at number nine. It was the title track to his 1990 debut album &quot;Country Club&quot;, produced by Gregg Brown. The month of its release, Tritt burst a blood vessel on his vocal cords, and had to take vocal rest for a month. Second single &quot;Help Me Hold On&quot; became his first number one single in 1990. The album&#x27;s third and fifth singles, &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Somebody&quot; and &quot;Drift Off to Dream&quot;, respectively peaked at numbers two and three on the Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts, and number one on the Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; country charts; &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Somebody&quot; also went to number one on the U.S. country singles charts published by &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;. &quot;Put Some Drive in Your Country&quot;, which was released fourth, peaked at 28 on Hot Country Songs. &quot;Country Club&quot; was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in July 1991 for shipments of one million copies, and no medals since in 1996. In 1990, he won the Top New Male Artist award from &quot;Billboard&quot;. The Country Music Association (CMA) also nominated him for the Horizon Award (now known as the New Artist Award), which is given to new artists who show have shown the most significant artistic and commercial development from a first or second album.

Brian Mansfield of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, saying that &quot;Put Some Drive in Your Country&quot; paid homage to Tritt&#x27;s influences, but that the other singles were more radio-friendly. Giving the album a B-minus, Alanna Nash of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared Tritt&#x27;s music to that of Hank Williams, Jr. and Joe Stampley.

===1991–1992: &quot;It&#x27;s All About to Change&quot;===
In 1991, Tritt received a second Horizon Award nomination, which he won that year. He also released his second album, &quot;It&#x27;s All About to Change&quot;. The album went on to become his bestselling, with a triple-platinum certification from the RIAA for shipments of three million copies. All four of its singles reached the top five on the country music charts. &quot;Here&#x27;s a Quarter (Call Someone Who Cares)&quot; and the Marty Stuart duet &quot;The Whiskey Ain&#x27;t Workin&#x27;&quot;, respectively the first and third singles, both reached number two, with the number-one &quot;Anymore&quot; in between. &quot;Nothing Short of Dying&quot; was the fourth single, with a peak at number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;; both it and &quot;The Whiskey Ain&#x27;t Working&quot; went to Number One on &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;. &quot;Bible Belt&quot;, another cut from the album (recorded in collaboration with Little Feat), appeared in the 1992 film &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot; (the lyrics for the song, however, were changed for the version played in the movie to match the story line). Although not released as a single, it peaked at number 72 country based on unsolicited airplay and was the b-side to &quot;Nothing Short of Dying&quot;. &quot;Bible Belt&quot; was inspired by a youth pastor whom Tritt knew in his childhood.

Stuart offered &quot;The Whiskey Ain&#x27;t Workin&#x27; Anymore&quot; to Tritt backstage at the CMA awards show, and they recorded it as a duet through the suggestion of Tritt&#x27;s record producer, Gregg Brown. The duet won both artists the next year&#x27;s Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. Tritt and Stuart charted a second duet, &quot;This One&#x27;s Gonna Hurt You (For a Long, Long Time)&quot;, which went to number seven in mid-1992 and appeared on Stuart&#x27;s album &quot;This One&#x27;s Gonna Hurt You&quot;. This song won the 1992 CMA award for Vocal Event of the Year.

In June 1992, Tritt received media attention when he criticized Billy Ray Cyrus&#x27; &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot; at a Fan Fair interview, saying that he did not think that Cyrus&#x27; song made a &quot;statement&quot;. The following January, Cyrus responded at the American Music Awards by referring to Tritt&#x27;s &quot;Here&#x27;s a Quarter&quot;. Tritt later apologized to Cyrus, but said that he defended his opinion on the song.

===1992–1993: &quot;T-R-O-U-B-L-E&quot; and &quot;A Travis Tritt Christmas&quot;===
Tritt and Stuart began a &quot;No Hats Tour&quot; in 1992. In August of that same year, Tritt released the album &quot;T-R-O-U-B-L-E&quot;. Its first single was &quot;Lord Have Mercy on the Working Man&quot;, a song written by Kostas. This song, which featured backing vocals from Brooks &amp; Dunn, T. Graham Brown, George Jones, Little Texas, Dana McVicker (who also sang backup on Tritt&#x27;s first two albums), Tanya Tucker and Porter Wagoner on the final chorus, peaked at number five. Its follow-up, &quot;Can I Trust You with My Heart&quot;, became Tritt&#x27;s third &quot;Billboard&quot; number one in early 1993. The album&#x27;s next three singles did not perform as well on the charts: the title track (a cover of an Elvis Presley song), peaked at 13, followed by &quot;Looking Out for Number One&quot; at number 11 and &quot;Worth Every Mile&quot; at number 30. &quot;T-R-O-U-B-L-E&quot; became the second album of his career to achieve double-platinum certification. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic thought that &quot;T-R-O-U-B-L-E&quot; followed too closely the formula of &quot;It&#x27;s All About to Change&quot;, but said that the songs showed Tritt&#x27;s personality. Nash gave the album a similar criticism, but praised the rock influences of &quot;Looking Out for Number One&quot; and the vocals on &quot;Can I Trust You with My Heart&quot;.

One month after the release of &quot;T-R-O-U-B-L-E&quot;, Tritt issued a Christmas album titled &quot;A Travis Tritt Christmas: Loving Time of the Year&quot;, for which he wrote the title track. He also joined the Grand Ole Opry, a weekly stage show and radio broadcast specializing in country music performances, and filled in for Garth Brooks at a performance on the American Music Awards. By year&#x27;s end, Tritt and several other artists appeared on George Jones&#x27;s &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need Your Rockin&#x27; Chair&quot;, which won all artists involved the next year&#x27;s CMA Vocal Event of the Year award.

===1994–1995: &quot;Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===
In early 1994, after &quot;Worth Every Mile&quot; fell from the charts, Tritt charted at number 21 with a cover of the Eagles&#x27; &quot;Take It Easy&quot;. He recorded this song for the tribute album &quot;Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles&quot; (released through Warner Bros.&#x27; Giant Records division), which featured country music artists&#x27; renditions of Eagles songs. When filming the music video for this song, Tritt requested that the band, which had been on hiatus for over 13 years, appear in it. This reunion inspired the Eagles&#x27; Hell Freezes Over Tour, which began that year.

His fourth album, &quot;Ten Feet Tall and Bulletproof&quot;, was released that May. Its lead-off single, &quot;Foolish Pride&quot;, went to number one, and the fourth single, &quot;Tell Me I Was Dreaming&quot;, reached number two. In between these songs were the title track at number 22 and &quot;Between an Old Memory and Me&quot; (originally recorded by Keith Whitley) at number 11. The album included two co-writes with Gary Rossington of Lynyrd Skynyrd, and guest vocals from Waylon Jennings and Hank Williams, Jr. on the cut &quot;Outlaws Like Us&quot;. The album achieved platinum certification in December of that year, and later became his third double-platinum album. AllMusic reviewer Brian Mansfield said that Tritt was &quot;most comfortable with his Southern rock/outlaw mantle&quot; on it, comparing &quot;Foolish Pride&quot; favorably to &quot;Anymore&quot; and the work of Bob Seger. Alanna Nash praised the title track and &quot;Tell Me I Was Dreaming&quot; in her review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, but thought that the other songs were still too similar in sound to his previous works.

1995&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits: From the Beginning&quot; included most of his singles to that point, as well as two new cuts: the Steve Earle composition &quot;Sometimes She Forgets&quot; and a cover of the pop standard &quot;Only You (And You Alone)&quot;. The former was a top ten hit at number seven, while the latter spent only eight weeks on the country charts and peaked at number 51. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was certified platinum.

===1996–1997: &quot;The Restless Kind&quot;===
In April 1996, Tritt and Stuart charted a third duet, &quot;Honky Tonkin&#x27;s What I Do Best&quot;, which appeared on Stuart&#x27;s album of the same name and peaked at 23 on the country charts. The song won both artists that year&#x27;s Country Music Association award for Vocal Event, Tritt&#x27;s third win in this category. The two began a second tour, the Double Trouble Tour, that year.

Tritt charted at number three in mid-1996 with &quot;More Than You&#x27;ll Ever Know&quot;, the first single from his fifth album, &quot;The Restless Kind&quot;. The album accounted for one more top ten hit, a cover of Waylon Jennings&#x27;s &quot;Where Corn Don&#x27;t Grow&quot;, which Tritt took to number six in late 1996. This song&#x27;s chart run overlapped with that of &quot;Here&#x27;s Your Sign (Get the Picture)&quot;, a novelty release combining snippets of comedian Bill Engvall&#x27;s &quot;Here are Your Sign&quot; routines with a chorus sung by Tritt. &quot;Here&#x27;s Your Sign (Get the Picture)&quot; peaked at 29 on the country charts and 43 on the &quot; Billboard&quot; Hot 100, accounting for Tritt&#x27;s first entry on the latter chart. The other singles from &quot;The Restless Kind&quot; all failed to make Top Ten upon their 1997 release. &quot;She&#x27;s Going Home with Me&quot; and &quot;Still in Love with You&quot; (previously the respective B-sides to &quot;Where Corn Don&#x27;t Grow&quot; and &quot;More Than You&#x27;ll Ever Know&quot;) were the third and fifth releases, peaking at 24 and 23 on Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks. In between was the number 18 &quot;Helping Me Get Over You&quot;, a duet with Lari White which the two co-wrote.

Unlike his previous albums, all of which were produced by Gregg Brown, Tritt produced &quot;The Restless Kind&quot; with Don Was. Tritt told &quot;Billboard&quot; that the album showed a greater level of personal involvement than his previous efforts, as it was his first co-production credit. He also noted that he sang most of the vocal harmony by himself, played guitar on &quot;She&#x27;s Going Home with Me&quot;, and helped with the album&#x27;s art direction. It received positive reviews from Thom Owens of AllMusic, who said that it was the most country-sounding album of his career. Don Yates of &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; also praised it for having a more &quot;organic&quot; sound than Tritt&#x27;s other albums.

===1998–1999: &quot;No More Looking over My Shoulder&quot;===
In 1998, he and several other artists contributed to Stuart&#x27;s &quot;Same Old Train&quot;, a cut from the collaborative album &quot;Tribute to Tradition&quot;; this song charted at number 59 on Hot Country Songs and won Tritt his second Grammy for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals. He also performed on Frank Wildhorn&#x27;s concept album of the musical &quot;The Civil War&quot;, singing the song &quot;The Day the Sun Stood Still&quot;. By year&#x27;s end, Tritt also released his final Warner Bros. album, &quot;No More Looking over My Shoulder&quot;. It was his first of four consecutive albums which he produced with Billy Joe Walker, Jr., who is a session guitarist, producer, and New Age musician. The album was led off by the ballad &quot;If I Lost You&quot;, which peaked at number 29 on the country charts and number 86 on the Hot 100. Michael Peterson (who recorded for Warner Bros.&#x27; Reprise label at the time) co-wrote and sang backing vocals on the title track, which went to number 38 country in early 1999. The album&#x27;s third and final single was a cover of Jude Cole&#x27;s &quot;Start the Car&quot; (previously the B-side to &quot;If I Lost You&quot;), which peaked at number 52.

Late in 1999, Tritt recorded a cover of Hank Williams&#x27;s &quot;Move It On Over&quot; with George Thorogood for the soundtrack to the cartoon &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. This cut peaked at number 66 on the country charts from unsolicited airplay.

===2000–2002: &quot;Down the Road I Go&quot;===
Soon after leaving Warner Bros. Records, Tritt signed to Columbia Records and released the album &quot;Down the Road I Go&quot; in 2000. The album&#x27;s first release was &quot;Best of Intentions&quot;, his fifth and final number one hit on &quot;Billboard&quot;. It was also his most successful entry on the Hot 100, where it reached number 27. The next two singles, &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Day to Be Alive&quot; and &quot;Love of a Woman&quot;, both peaked at number two on the country charts in 2001, followed by &quot;Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde&quot; at number eight. All three songs also crossed over to the Hot 100, respectively reaching peaks of 33, 39 and 55. Tritt wrote or co-wrote seven of the album&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Best of Intentions&quot;, and collaborated with Charlie Daniels on two of them. &quot;It&#x27;s a Great Day to Be Alive&quot; was originally recorded by Jon Randall, whose version was to have been included on an unreleased album for BNA Records in the late 1990s.

Maria Konicki Dinoia gave the album a positive review on AllMusic, saying that Tritt &quot;hasn&#x27;t lost his touch&quot;. &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; also gave a positive review, saying that it showed Tritt&#x27;s balance of country and rock influences. An uncredited review in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine called &quot;Best of Intentions&quot; a &quot;gorgeous ballad&quot;, comparing it favorably to his early Warner Bros. releases.

===2002–2005: &quot;Strong Enough&quot; and &quot;My Honky Tonk History&quot;===
In September 2002, Tritt released his second album on Columbia Records, &quot;Strong Enough&quot;. Its first single was &quot;Strong Enough to Be Your Man&quot; (an answer song to Sheryl Crow&#x27;s 1994 single &quot;Strong Enough&quot;) which reached number 13. The only other release was &quot;Country Ain&#x27;t Country&quot;, which peaked at 26 on the country charts. William Ruhlmann gave the album a generally positive review on AllMusic, saying that he considered its sound closer to mainstream country than Tritt&#x27;s previous albums.

Also in 2002, Tritt performed on an episode of &quot;Crossroads&quot;, a program on Country Music Television which pairs country acts with musicians from other genres for collaborative performances. He performed with Ray Charles. Tritt contributed guest vocals to Charlie Daniels&#x27; 2003 single &quot;Southern Boy&quot;, and recorded a cover of Waylon Jennings&#x27; &quot;Lonesome, On&#x27;ry and Mean&quot; to the RCA Records tribute album &quot;I&#x27;ve Always Been Crazy&quot;. Respectively, these songs reached 51 and 50 on the country charts.

Tritt&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;My Honky Tonk History&quot;, was released in 2004. This album included three charting singles: &quot;The Girl&#x27;s Gone Wild&quot; at 28, followed by the John Mellencamp duet &quot;What Say You&quot; at number 21 and &quot;I See Me&quot; at number 32. Other songs on the album included a cover of Philip Claypool&#x27;s &quot;Circus Leaving Town&quot; and songs written by Gretchen Wilson, Benmont Tench and Delbert McClinton. Thom Jurek rated this album favorably, saying that it was a &quot;solid, sure-voiced outing&quot;; he also thought that &quot;What Say You&quot; was the best song on it.

===2007–present: &quot;The Storm&quot;, &quot;The Calm After...&quot; and &quot;Set in Stone&quot;===

Tritt exited Columbia in July 2005, citing creative differences over &quot;My Honky Tonk History&quot;. He signed to the independent Category 5 Records in February 2006, and served as the label&#x27;s flagship artist. In March 2007, a concert promoter in the Pittsburgh area sued Tritt, claiming he had committed to play a show, but then backed out and signed to play a competing venue. Tritt&#x27;s manager denied he had ever signed a contract with the promoter. Tritt released his first single for Category 5 in May 2007: a cover of the Richard Marx song &quot;You Never Take Me Dancing&quot;. It was included on his only album for Category 5, &quot;The Storm&quot;, which &quot;American Idol&quot; judge Randy Jackson produced. The album featured a more rhythm and blues influence than Tritt&#x27;s previous works. &quot;You Never Take Me Dancing&quot; peaked at number 27 on the country charts; a second single, &quot;Something Stronger Than Me&quot;, was released in October, but it did not chart. Category 5 closed in November 2007 after allegations that the label&#x27;s chief executive officer, Raymond Termini, had illegally used Medicaid funds to finance it. A month later, Tritt filed a $10 million lawsuit against Category 5, because the label had failed to pay royalties on the album, and failed to give him creative control on &quot;The Storm&quot;.

In October 2008, Tritt began an 11-date tour with Marty Stuart. On this tour, they performed acoustic renditions of their duets; Tritt also performed five solo shows. Tritt signed a management deal with Parallel Entertainment in December 2010. He continued to tour through to 2012 and into 2013, with most of his shows being solo acoustic performances. Tritt acquired the rights to the songs on &quot;The Storm&quot; and re-issued it via his own Post Oak label in July 2013 under the title &quot;The Calm After...&quot; The re-release included two covers: the Patty Smyth and Don Henley duet &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain&#x27;t Enough&quot;, which he recorded as a duet with his daughter Tyler Reese, and Faces&#x27; 1971 hit &quot;Stay with Me&quot;.

In 2019, Tritt was featured on the country rock hit &quot;Outlaws &amp; Outsiders&quot; by Cory Marks. In 2021 &quot;Set in Stone&quot; released in 2021. around that time recorded in 2019 and 2020 they album pushed back in early 2021. In 2024, Tritt featured on another Cory Marks song titled &quot;(Make My) Country Rock&quot;.

==Acting career==
Tritt&#x27;s first acting role was alongside fellow country singer Kenny Rogers in the 1993 made-for-television movie &quot;Rio Diablo&quot;. In 1994, Tritt made a special appearance as a bull rider in the movie &quot;The Cowboy Way&quot;, which starred Woody Harrelson, Kiefer Sutherland and Dylan McDermott. In 1995, he appeared in season 6 of the horror anthology series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; in the episode called &quot;Doctor of Horror&quot;. He also starred in various guest roles on &quot;Yes, Dear&quot; as a rehabilitating criminal, on &quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot; as a terminally ill criminal taunting Steve Sloan (Barry Van Dyke), and on &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot; as a gun slinger The following year, Tritt appeared as himself in &quot;Sgt. Bilko&quot;, which starred Steve Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman; Tritt&#x27;s cover of &quot;Only You (And You Alone)&quot; appeared in the film&#x27;s soundtrack. He also appeared as himself in the 1997 film &quot;Fire Down Below&quot;, starring Steven Seagal and Kris Kristofferson. In 1999 Tritt appeared in &quot;Outlaw Justice&quot; with Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. Tritt appeared in the film &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot; as one of the Louisiana Gator Boys, performing alongside B. B. King, Eric Clapton, and Bo Diddley. In 2001 he guest starred in &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World The Wild Wild West&quot;. In September 2010, filming began on a movie called &quot;Fishers of Men&quot;, a Christian film.

==Musical styles==
Although he had been singing since childhood, Tritt said that he began to put &quot;a little more soul&quot; in his voice after his church band performed at an African-American church. He said that he took interest in how African-American singers put &quot;all these bends and sweeps and curls&quot; in their voices, and began emulating that sound. While performing at these churches, he also took interest in gospel singers such as Andraé Crouch. Later on, he began listening to Southern rock acts such as Lynyrd Skynyrd through the recommendation of a friend, as well as the bluegrass music that his uncle exposed him to. Tritt said that he found his songwriting began to develop during the creation of his demo tape, when he had written a song called &quot;Gambler&#x27;s Blues&quot; that &quot;felt a lot more connected to Southern rock&quot; than his previous writings. He cites country, rock and folk as his influences. Stephen Thomas Erlewine contrasts him with contemporaries Clint Black and Alan Jackson, saying that Tritt was &quot;the only one not to wear a [cowboy] hat and the only one to dip into bluesy Southern rock. Consequently, he developed a gutsy, outlaw image that distinguished him from the pack.&quot; Zell Miller, in the book &quot;They Heard Georgia Singing&quot;, said that Tritt has an &quot;unerring ability to walk the narrow path between his country heritage and his rock leanings to the acclaim of the devotees of both.&quot;

Regarding his songwriting style and single choices, Tritt said that he writes &quot;strictly from personal experiences&quot; and does not follow a particular formula. He described &quot;Here&#x27;s a Quarter&quot; as &quot;one of the simplest three-chord waltzes I&#x27;ve ever written&quot;, and said that label executives were reluctant to release it because they thought that it was a novelty song. Also, he was told that &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Be Somebody&quot; would not be a hit because it did not contain any rhymes, and fought the release of the song &quot;Country Club&quot; because he did not think that it fit his style. He also said that, despite their low peaks, the more rock-influenced &quot;Put Some Drive in Your Country&quot; and &quot;T-R-O-U-B-L-E&quot; helped generate sales for their respective albums more so than the top ten hits from those albums.

==Personal life==
Tritt married his high school sweetheart, Karen Ryon, in September 1982. They were married two years before divorcing. After going to court, Tritt was ordered to pay alimony to Karen for six months. When he was 21, he married Jodi Barnett, who was 33 at the time. He divorced her shortly after signing with Warner Bros. in 1989; the divorce finalized one month before &quot;Country Club&quot; was released. Tritt wrote the song &quot;Here&#x27;s a Quarter&quot; the night he received his divorce papers.

He married Theresa Nelson on April 12, 1997. They have one daughter, and two sons.

On May 18, 2019, he was in his tour bus when it was involved in a motor vehicle accident that took the lives of two people driving the wrong way on Veteran&#x27;s Highway leaving Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

===Political views and advocacy===
Tritt is a member of the Republican Party and supported George W. Bush for president in 2000. The two met in 1996 at the Republican National Convention in San Diego, California, where Tritt sang the national anthem. Tritt told Insight on the News that he is a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights and believes the answer to crime is not gun control but criminal control. &quot;I&#x27;m a pro-gun guy. I&#x27;m an NRA (National Rifle Association of America) member, a life member as a matter of fact. I&#x27;m more for the belief of making the punishment tougher for the criminals to start with. I think that sends much more of an incentive for people to not commit crimes of any type than taking away guns. Because you take away guns, and the next thing you know, stabbing murders are going to increase.&quot; He adds that he is &quot;definitely pro-death penalty&quot;.

In September 2020, Tritt gained notoriety for joining fellow Republican James Woods in blocking random Twitter users for using pro-Black Lives Matter and other anti-Trump tags in their posts, under the belief that it would counteract anti-Republican sentiment on Twitter.

In April 2023, as a protest against Bud Light for supporting transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, Tritt Tweeted &quot;I will be deleting all Anheuser-Busch products from my tour hospitality rider.&quot;

===Alleged paranormal encounters===
In October 2015, Tritt appeared on Lifetime network&#x27;s &quot;The Haunting of...&quot; program to discuss his experiences with the paranormal. Tritt stated that beginning in 1993, he was awakened &quot;regularly&quot; by disembodied voices in a vacation cabin that he owned – the voices spoke in an unknown dialect. His wife, Theresa, eventually heard them as well. According to Tritt, &quot;Over the years, these voices started happening
on such a frequent basis that we were afraid to come up here.&quot; He also asserted that footprints once appeared in the carpet of the cabin, and imprints in the bedspread, that belonged to neither him nor his wife.

The show&#x27;s host, Kim Russo, concluded that an African-American medicine man had been stabbed and beaten to death on the property, and the voices that Tritt was hearing belonged to the murderers&#x27; angry spirits. A title card in the program notes that &quot;On August 14, 1875, a group of men killed a &#x27;hoodoo doctor&#x27; close to the land where Travis&#x27; cabin was built.&quot; Russo believed that the hoodoo doctor&#x27;s spirit also lingered on the property because it found a &quot;kindred spirit&quot; in Tritt.

<text>India Allen (born India Juliana Orban on June 1, 1965, in Portsmouth, Virginia) is an American actress and model. Allen appeared as a centerfold in the December 1987 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine and was subsequently named Playmate of the Year in 1988.

== Career ==
Allen was initially encouraged by her mother when she turned eighteen to pursue modeling and to try out for Playboy, but she was not interested. The suggestion came up again a few years later when her casting agent sent her to do a small role in a short film parody of Beverly Hills Cop II, in a role as a Playmate in the Playboy Mansion West scene. On the set of the film, Allen met Monique St. Pierre, Playboy&#x27;s Playmate of the Year in 1979. Allen was surprised when one of the film&#x27;s producers mentioned that St. Pierre was a Playmate and the two became friends. After looking through Allen&#x27;s portfolio of modeling assignments, St. Pierre took her to Playboy&#x27;s West Coast photo studios on Sunset Boulevard for test shots.

After her first pictorial, Allen continued to act and also appeared in a series of &quot;Playboy&quot; videos.

== Personal life ==
Allen was born in Portsmouth, Virginia and grew up in the South - Virginia, Georgia, and South Carolina.

In the early 1980s Julie was married to her Ball State University college beau. In September 1988 she was married for a short time to American sports broadcaster Bill Macatee.
In 1996, Allen was a witness in the civil trial of O. J. Simpson and testified that she had seen Simpson strike his then-wife Nicole Brown Simpson in 1983, when Allen was employed by a veterinary hospital in Beverly Hills, California.

<doc id="1286417" wikidata="Q7561989" url="?curid=1286417" title="Sonny's BBQ">
<text>Sonny&#x27;s BBQ is a barbecue restaurant chain founded by Floyd &quot;Sonny&quot; Tillman in Gainesville, Florida, in 1968. Bob Yarmuth purchased the company in 1991 and continues as the company&#x27;s owner and CEO today. As of 2016, Sonny&#x27;s BBQ has 113 restaurants across eight Southeastern states and is headquartered in Maitland, Florida. The restaurant specializes in Southern-style BBQ.

==History==

Sonny&#x27;s Real Pit-Bar-B-Q was founded on April 17, 1968, by Floyd &quot;Sonny&quot; Tillman and his wife Lucille, starting with a single location on Waldo Road in Gainesville, Florida. The company began franchising nine years later in 1977 with a menu consisting of pork, beef, ribs, chicken, beans and other sides. In 1988, Sonny&#x27;s BBQ had grown to 77 restaurants across six states, and Tillman sold the company to outside investors. In 1991, Bob Yarmuth purchased the company.

During the 2000s, Sonny&#x27;s was the largest BBQ restaurant chain in the United States, with about 150 locations across nine states. In 2011, the company had 125 operating franchised restaurants. In 2012, the company moved its headquarters to Winter Park, Florida and in 2013, the company changed its name from Sonny&#x27;s Real Pit-Bar-B-Q to Sonny&#x27;s BBQ.

===2008 Recession===
On September 25, 2008, Greater Atlanta Bar-B-Q (the only Metro Atlanta franchisee of Sonny&#x27;s) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for ten locations, four of which were closed completely, raising concerns about another restaurant&#x27;s viability after Metromedia Restaurant Group closed its Bennigan&#x27;s and Steak &amp; Ale restaurant chains. Yet, as of the first week of June 2009, it came out of bankruptcy, completing Chapter 11 requirements. On October 15, 2008, all three Sonny&#x27;s locations in the greater Daytona Beach area of Florida were closed.
As of December 1, 2009, the Tifton, Georgia restaurant became known as the Smokehouse Restaurant due to disputes with Sonny&#x27;s over imagery and icons in the restaurant itself and on employees&#x27; clothing.

Sonny Tillman&#x27;s birthday is celebrated as a special event by the restaurant each August 14. Despite selling the franchise, Tillman retained ownership of the original Sonny&#x27;s BBQ until 2011, when he relinquished his franchisee agreement. Afterwards he continued to attend grand openings, sometimes appearing in commercials, and participating in other events. Events held by Sonny&#x27;s include its Random Acts of BBQ events, where individual restaurants provide a BBQ feast for community volunteers and volunteer organizations. The company named October 12 as National Pulled Pork Day beginning in 2016, which is celebrated at all Sonny&#x27;s locations.

==Menu==
Sonny&#x27;s BBQ menu has Southern-style barbecue, including pulled pork, sliced pork, baby back ribs, buffalo wings, St. Louis-style ribs, beef brisket, burgers, appetizers, and sides.

De Luca co-wrote the story for the 1995 film adaptation of the popular British comic book character Judge Dredd, starring Sylvester Stallone as the eponymous lead. In 1996, De Luca, was approached by the producers Brannon Braga and Ronald D.

De Luca and Dana Brunetti reunited for &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey,&quot; the 2015 film adaptation of the best-selling novel of the same name. It was a massive financial success, becoming one of the highest-grossing R-rated films of all time.

<text>The Endless Mountains is a geographical, geological, and cultural region in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The Endless Mountains region includes Bradford, Sullivan, Susquehanna, and Wyoming counties. The highest peak in the region is the North Knob of Elk Mountain at . The dissected plateau is a subrange of the Appalachian Mountains.

==Geography==
Part of the Appalachian Mountains chain, the region does not consist of true mountains, geologically speaking, but instead a dissected plateau that is part of the Allegheny Plateau. The Catskill Mountains are the highest expression of the plateau, located to the east of the Endless Mountains, and separated from them by the Delaware River.

The current geography was slightly modified during the last ice age by the Wisconsin Glacier about 15,000 years ago. Glacial striations can be found on the rocks of some of the high ridges, but the area was at the margin of the ice sheet, and the impact was much less than in New York just to the north.

The mountains are made up of sedimentary rocks (mostly sandstone and shales, with a little conglomerate) that were part of a lowland that collected sediments eroded from mountains to the southeast in Mississippian and Pennsylvanian geologic time. The area has been uplifted and lowered several times. The highest points are all nearly the same elevation, establishing that the area had once been eroded into a nearly level peneplain, which has since been uplifted. The present Susquehanna River established its meandering course during that time, when it was a mature stream on a topography of very low relief. When the area was uplifted, the river&#x27;s bends were preserved as incised meanders. The large river cut a deep valley and established a low baseline for its tributaries, which then cut the plateau into the rugged hills of the present day.

==History==

Several Native American bands settled the area in prehistoric times. By the early colonial period, Munsee-Lenape, Susquehannock, and Iroquois peoples were the principal occupants of the region. The majority of the local place names were derived from the Munsee-Lenape, however; places like &quot;Lock-ah Hanna&quot; (Lackawanna or Sand River), &quot;Tunk Hanna Unk&quot; (Tunkhannock or Bend River Place), &quot;Why-ohm Ing&quot; (Wyoming or Food Place), &quot;Min Nees Unk&quot; (Minisink), &quot;Toe-be Hanna&quot; (Tobyhanna or Cool River), &quot;Mesh-op Ing&quot; (Meshoppen), &quot;Why-ah-loose Ing&quot; (Wyalusing), &quot;Schick-shin Ing&quot; (Shickshinny), and &quot;Mawsch Unk&quot; (Bear Place, present-day Jim Thorpe) are examples. The Munsee and other native peoples like the Shawnee, Nanticoke, Conoy, and Tutelo were evicted by the terms of the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix, which was between the Iroquois League and the British Crown.

After 1768, hundreds of British, Irish, and German families flooded in from New England, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania to occupy lands purchased from the Susquehanna and Connecticut Land companies of Connecticut. These settlements eventually led to armed conflict with the Penn proprietors (William Penn&#x27;s sons, Richard and Thomas, and his grandson, John), who also claimed the land. (See Pennamite Wars). During the American Revolution in 1778, a combined British, Tory, Iroquois, Munsee, and Lenape force attacked the Wyoming Valley settlers on the eastern edge of this region, and killed many of the settlers. Washington sent Major General John Sullivan on a campaign to destroy the Iroquois threat by a &quot;scorched earth&quot; drive up the Susquehanna and Chemung Rivers into central and western New York.

The region&#x27;s economy was formerly based on mining, lumbering (especially of hemlock for tanning) and industry but is now largely agricultural with forestry and tourism contributing to the economic base. Much of the land is steep, but there are a few good farms on rolling hilltops or valley bottoms; many of these farms have been occupied by Mennonite and Amish people who have migrated northward as their traditional homelands became developed.

Quarrying remains an important local industry with the region&#x27;s high quality blue stone being particularly valuable. The area is on the edge of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Coal Region, with some minor veins of coal extending into the area.

<doc id="1286426" wikidata="Q599105" url="?curid=1286426" title="Fender Cyclone">
<text>The Fender Cyclone denotes a series of electric guitars made by Fender. Introduced in late 1997, the Cyclone body is similarly styled to the Mustang, but it is a quarter of an inch thicker than the body of a Mustang and is made of poplar, whereas contemporary Mustang reissues were made of basswood.

In July 2002, the Cyclone II was introduced as the successor to the Fender Cyclone and featured cosmetic changes such as the Mustang racing stripe as well as 3 vintage single-coil pickups and switching borrowed from the Fender Jaguar. the range included the original Cyclone, the Cyclone HH with two humbuckers, and the Cyclone II with three MIA Jaguar pickups controlled by on-off switches in place of the selector switch. As of January 2007, all original Cyclone variants had been discontinued by Fender. In 2020, Fender&#x27;s budget brand Squier reissued the Cyclone II as part of its Paranormal Series. The 2020 model was available in Shell Pink or Daphne Blue, with an Indian Laurel fingerboard. The 2021 model was available in Candy Apple Red and Pearl. It came with Squier Strat pickups instead of the original Jaguar pickups. In 2024, Fender Japan re-issued the Cyclone as a domestic only limited edition model.

==Cyclone==
The Cyclone has a scale of 24.75 inches (the same as a Gibson Les Paul but an unusual intermediate size for Fender), and a Fender Stratocaster-style synchronized tremolo. The original Cyclone used an Atomic humbucking pickup in the bridge, a Tex-Mex pickup in the neck position, and a conventional 3-way toggle switch.

==US Cyclone==
The Cyclone was also promoted as a USA-made guitar for a brief time in 2000. The US Cyclone featured two dual-coil ceramic Vintage Noiseless single-coils and a modern 2-point synchronized vibrato with stainless steel saddles. The Custom Cyclone had similar features, but used two Gold Lace Sensor pickups with black covers and a custom vintage 2-point tremolo bridge with bent solid steel saddles. Both guitars were made at the Fender Custom Shop. These American-made Cyclones were gone at the end of 2001.

==Cyclone II==
Introduced as the successor to the Cyclone in July 2002, the Cyclone II features changes such as the Mustang racing stripe as well as pickups and switching borrowed from the Jaguar. The guitar employs three pickups angled in a similar fashion to the Telecaster bridge pickup, rather than the standard two straight pickups of a Jaguar. It also features a Jazzmaster headstock similar to a 1970s Strat. It has vintage tuning heads as well as vintage nickel string saddles, which were found on 1950s model Strats. It was available in a choice of two colours, Candy Apple Red and Daphne Blue, both with the white racing stripe found on the Mustang.

The Cyclone II has a scale of 24.75 inches, a Stratocaster-style synchronized tremolo, and an on/off switch for each pickup. While it is different in design to the Stratocaster, it has seven pickup selections, including bridge pickup with neck pickup or even all three pickups.

==Cyclone HH==
The Cyclone HH had the same features and specifications as the original Cyclone, except for the addition of a 3-ply black pickguard and a pair of humbucking pickups, a Fender Santa Ana and a Fender Atomic II in the bridge and neck positions. Introduced in 2003, it was discontinued, like the other Cyclone models, in 2007.

The Cyclone HH also included a vintage-style synchronized tremolo, a three-position toggle switch, master volume and tone controls, as well as chrome-plated hardware. It was available in Black, Pewter, Daphne Blue and Orange.

== Paranormal Cyclone ==
In 2020, Squier released the Paranormal Series, a series that released guitars that feature mash-ups of classic Fender models and rereleases of obscure Fender models. Alongside the Toronado, Cabronita Telecaster, Offset Telecaster, 54&#x27; Jazz Bass, and Super Sonic, Squier released a new take on the Cyclone II. It features the same thicker Mustang body and Jaguar-Style pickup switch and electronics, but has 3 Alnico Stratocaster Pickups and a bent steel Vintage Style Tremolo Bridge. It comes in Daphne Blue and Shell Pink from the 2020 release, and Pearl and Candy Apple Red from the 2021 release.

== Made in Japan Limited Cyclone ==
In May 2024, in a first for Fender Japan, a limited edition Cyclone was introduced based on the original 1997 model. Equipped with specially designed pickups, this model is available with either a maple or rosewood fretboard, and comes in multiple new finishes. A butterscotch blonde model, exclusive to Fender&#x27;s Tokyo Flagship store and MikiGakki, comes with a specially engraved neckplate.

<doc id="1286439" wikidata="Q3518760" url="?curid=1286439" title="Terri Welles">
<text>Terri Welles (born Terri Knepper; November 21, 1956) is an American actress and adult model. She first appeared on the cover of the May 1980 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, wearing a flight attendant costume to illustrate a pictorial on stewardesses (Welles was a United Airlines stewardess at the time). She subsequently appeared as a centerfold in the December 1980 issue and was named Playmate of the Year for 1981. Her original pictorial was photographed by Richard Fegley. Welles was the inspiration for the &quot;Bobo Weller&quot; character in the film Star 80.

==Career==
In 1997 Welles started an online business selling pictures of herself. On her web site she described herself as a former &quot;Playboy&quot; model and Playmate of the Year. Playboy Enterprises, which was starting up its own online business at this time, sued Welles in 1998 claiming that it had the exclusive right to use of its trademark terms &quot;Playboy&quot; and &quot;Playmate of the Year&quot; for commercial purposes. The outcome of the suit, &quot;Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Welles&quot;, was that virtually all of Welles&#x27; use of the terms were considered nominative uses, and did not infringe on Playboy&#x27;s rights.

Welles closed down her web site on October 31, 2006, with the announcement that it had &quot;been a fun ride&quot;.

==Personal life==
Welles was born in Santa Monica, California. Welles married NHL ice hockey player, Charlie Simmer, in 1981; they divorced in 1986.

<doc id="1286441" wikidata="Q2646223" url="?curid=1286441" title="Gravitar">
<text>Gravitar is a color vector graphics multidirectional shooter arcade video game released by Atari, Inc. in 1982. Using the same &quot;rotate-and-thrust&quot; controls as &quot;Asteroids&quot; and &quot;Space Duel&quot;, the game was known for its high level of difficulty. It was the first of over twenty games (including the 1983 &quot;Star Wars)&quot; that Mike Hally designed and produced for Atari. The main programmer was Rich Adam and the cabinet art was designed by Brad Chaboya. 5,427 cabinets were produced. An Atari 2600 version by Dan Hitchens was published by Atari in 1983.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a small blue spacecraft. The game starts in a fictional solar system with several planets to explore. If the player moves their ship into a planet, they will be taken to a side-view landscape. Unlike many other shooting games, gravity plays a fair part in &quot;Gravitar&quot;: the ship will be pulled slowly to the deadly star in the overworld, and downward in the side-view levels. Great precision is demanded of the player, as the ship rotates too slowly to allow a player to correct their mistake if they apply too much thrust and fly toward an obstacle.

The player has five buttons: one each to rotate the ship left or right, one to shoot, one to activate the thruster, and one for both a tractor beam and force field. &quot;Gravitar&quot;, &quot;Asteroids&quot;, &quot;Asteroids Deluxe&quot; and &quot;Space Duel&quot; all used similar 5-button controlling systems.

In the side-view levels, the player has to destroy red bunkers that shoot constantly, and can also use the tractor beam to pick up blue fuel tanks. Once all of the bunkers are destroyed, the planet will blow up, and the player will earn a bonus. Once all planets are destroyed, the player will move onto another solar system.

The player will lose a life if they crash into the terrain or get hit by an enemy&#x27;s shot, and the game will end immediately if fuel runs out.

&quot;Gravitar&quot; has 12 different planets. &quot;Red Planet&quot; is available in all 3 phases in the universe; it contains a reactor. Shooting the reactor core activates a link. Escaping the reactor successfully moves the player to the next phase of planets, awards bonus points and 7500 units of fuel. Reactor escape time reduces after each phase and eventually becomes virtually impossible to complete.

After completing all 11 planets (or alternatively completing the reactor three times) the player enters the second universe and the gravity will reverse. Instead of dragging the ship towards the planet surface, the gravity pushes it away. In the third universe the landscape becomes invisible and the gravity is positive again. The final, fourth universe, has invisible landscape and reverse gravity. After completing the fourth universe the game starts over, but the reactor escape time will never reset back to high levels again.

The programmers thought that even the best players could never complete the most difficult planets on the invisible levels. Neither of the key developers themselves, Mike Hally and Rich Adam, have ever completed their own game &quot;without cheating&quot; (their words).

==Development==
&quot;Gravitar&quot; was developed under the name &quot;Lunar Battle&quot;.

==Ports==
The silver label version of Atari 2600 &quot;Gravitar&quot; was originally only available to Atari Club members. It was later sold in stores in limited quantities. Atari eventually released it in the red box and label style with larger distribution.

==Legacy==
&quot;Gravitar&quot; inspired the 1986 computer game &quot;Thrust&quot;.

Dual-stick shooter &quot;Black Widow&quot; was offered as a conversion kit for &quot;Gravitar&quot;. The kit included a new marquee, control panel, side art, and an additional wiring harness. The kit used the original &quot;Gravitar&quot; PCB, with a few small modifications and a new set of ROM chips. Many factory-built &quot;Black Widows&quot; were produced using unsold &quot;Gravitar&quot; cabinets, and although they contain original (not &quot;Gravitar&quot; conversion) board sets, they had &quot;Black Widow&quot; side art applied over the &quot;Gravitar&quot; sideart.

&quot;Gravitar&quot; is part of the &quot;Atari Anthology&quot; for Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 as well as the &quot;Atari Anniversary Edition Vol. 2&quot; for Dreamcast, PlayStation, and Windows. &quot;Gravitar&quot; is also included in the Atari Flashback 3. In April 2019, &quot;Gravitar&quot; was added to the TeslAtari game collection included in Tesla vehicles.

In the 1983 James Bond film &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot;, Domino Petachi (Kim Basinger) is seen about to play &quot;Gravitar&quot; before meeting up again with Bond (Sean Connery) at Casino de Monte Carlo. The indoor scene was filmed at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England - the arcade cabinets used would have been sourced from Atari&#x27;s European factory in Ireland.

A revamped version of the game, titled &quot;Gravitar: Recharged&quot;, part of the &quot;Atari Recharged&quot; series, was released on May 12, 2022 for Atari VCS, and on June 2 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

==Records==
Dan Coogan, of Phoenix, Arizona, set a &quot;Gravitar&quot; world record, scoring 8,029,450 points from December 22 to 23, 2006, playing for 23 hours and 15 minutes. The previous world record for score was 4,722,200, which held for 24 years, set by Ray Mueller of Boulder, Colorado, on December 4, 1982, after playing for 12 hours and 21 minutes.

Kinneary United States Courthouse at Columbus, serves the counties of Athens, Belmont, Coshocton, Delaware, Fairfield, Fayette, Franklin, Gallia, Guernsey, Harrison, Hocking, Jackson, Jefferson, Knox, Licking, Logan, Madison, Meigs, Monroe, Morgan, Morrow, Muskingum, Noble, Perry, Pickaway, Pike, Ross, Union, Vinton, and Washington.

===Western Division===
The Western Division sits at both Cincinnati and Dayton.

== History ==
The United States District Court for the District of Ohio was established on February 19, 1803, by . The act of authorized one judgeship for the court. The district court in Ohio, not being assigned to a judicial circuit, was granted the same jurisdiction as U.S. circuit courts, except in appeals and writs of error, which were the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. By the act of February 24, 1807, , the authority of the Ohio district court to exercise the jurisdiction of a U.S. circuit court was repealed, and Ohio was assigned to the newly organized Seventh Circuit. It also provided for a U.S. circuit court for the District of Ohio. 
The District was subdivided into Northern and Southern Districts on February 10, 1855, by . The district judge serving the District of Ohio, Humphrey H. Leavitt, was reassigned to the Southern District of Ohio.

On July 23, 1866, by , Congress reorganized the circuits and assigned Ohio to the Sixth Circuit. Additional judgeships were created in 1910, 1937, 1966, 1970, 1978, 1984, and 1990.

<text>Sidney Labe Buckwold, (November 3, 1916 – June 27, 2001) was a Canadian politician, soldier, and businessman. Buckwold served as a Senator for 20 years and as mayor of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, for 11 years in two separate tenures.

== Early life ==
Buckwold was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba to Harry Buckwold and Dorothy Friedman in 1916. The family moved to Saskatoon in 1925, where Buckwold attended Buena Vista School, Nutana Collegiate and the University of Saskatchewan, before going to Montreal and receiving a Bachelor of Commerce from McGill University. Afterwards, he returned to Saskatoon and worked for his father&#x27;s dry goods store, Buckwold’s Ltd.

During the Second World War he served as an officer with the Canadian Army Service Corps from 1942 to 1945. After the war he returned to Saskatoon and Buckwold&#x27;s Ltd.

== Political career ==
=== Saskatoon City Council ===
Buckwold was first elected to Saskatoon City Council as an alderman in 1953. When John D. McAskill resigned as mayor in 1958, Buckwold ran to replace him, and was elected mayor. Buckwold was the first Jewish mayor in Saskatoon&#x27;s history.

Buckwold himself resigned as mayor in 1963 in order to run as a Liberal candidate in the federal election in the Saskatoon riding. He lost to the Progressive Conservative candidate, Henry Frank Jones. He ran again in the 1964 by-election after Jones&#x27; death, but lost again, this time to Jones&#x27; widow, Eloise.

In 1967, Buckwold returned to the mayor&#x27;s office, and served in the role until 1971. During his time in office, Buckwold help to lay the groundwork for a revitalization of downtown Saskatoon by moving the Canadian National Railway lines outside of the city. In their place the city constructed a new cultural centre, Centennial Auditorium, and a shopping centre. The federal government was so impressed with this successful vision of urban renewal that it began providing grants to other Canadian cities to move rail lines out of core urban areas. Outside of the downtown core, Buckwold established the Mendel Art Gallery, which would be the city&#x27;s main gallery well into the twenty first century. He also oversaw the construction of the city&#x27;s first freeway and the Idylwyld Bridge.

Buckwold was generally known as a booster of Saskatoon, and another former Senator from Saskatchewan, David Tkachuk, credited Buckwold with taking &quot;a sleepy prairie agricultural town and imbu[ing] it with spirit and pride.&quot; To help raise the profile of the city, he brought the Canada Winter Games to Saskatoon in 1971, for which the city constructed a small ski hill.

=== Canadian Senate ===
In 1971, he resigned again as mayor, this time to accept an appointment to the Canadian Senate on the recommendation of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. A Liberal, he served as Government Whip in the Senate and as Vice-Chairman of the National Liberal Caucus, and he became affectionately known as &quot;Senator Sid.&quot; However, he was an advocate for Senate reform, arguing in favour of an elected Senate with better regional representation and less partisanship. He served as a Senator until retiring in 1991 at age 75. 

== Personal life and legacy ==
Buckwold married Clarice Rabinovitch in 1939 and they had three children named Jay, Judy, and Linda. He remained active in community life for many years, serving with organizations such as Community Chest and the Rotary Club, and he was a founding member of the local branch of the Canadian Diabetes Association.

Buckwold received numerous honours throughout his life and career. He was named Saskatoon Citizen of the Year in 1971. In 1982, he received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Saskatchewan. In 1995, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was also made an honorary Colonel of the North Saskatchewan Regiment for his military service.

Buckwold died on June 27, 2001, aged 84. After his death, the City of Saskatoon renamed the Idylwyld Bridge, which was built during his time as mayor, to Senator Sid Buckwold Bridge in his honour. Buckwold Cove in the Arbor Creek neighbourhood and Sidney L. Buckwold Park in East College Park also bear his name.

<doc id="1286452" wikidata="Q3965283" url="?curid=1286452" title="Subgame">
<text>In game theory, a subgame is any part (a subset) of a game that meets the following criteria (the following terms allude to a game described in extensive form):

#It has a single initial node that is the only member of that node&#x27;s information set (i.e. the initial node is in a singleton information set).
#If a node is contained in the subgame then so are all of its successors.
#If a node in a particular information set is in the subgame then all members of that information set belong to the subgame.

It is a notion used in the solution concept of subgame perfect Nash equilibrium, a refinement of the Nash equilibrium that eliminates non-credible threats.

The key feature of a subgame is that it, when seen in isolation, constitutes a game in its own right. When the initial node of a subgame is reached in a larger game, players can concentrate only on that subgame; they can ignore the history of the rest of the game (provided they know what subgame they are playing). This is the intuition behind the definition given above of a subgame. It must contain an initial node that is a singleton information set since this is a requirement of a game. Otherwise, it would be unclear where the player with first move should start at the beginning of a game (but see nature&#x27;s choice). Even if it is clear in the context of the larger game which node of a non-singleton information set has been reached, players could not ignore the history of the larger game once they reached the initial node of a subgame if subgames cut across information sets. Furthermore, a subgame can be treated as a game in its own right, but it must reflect the strategies available to players in the larger game of which it is a subset. This is the reasoning behind 2 and 3 of the definition. All the strategies (or subsets of strategies) available to a player at a node in a game must be available to that player in the subgame the initial node of which is that node.

==Subgame perfection==

One of the principal uses of the notion of a subgame is in the solution concept subgame perfection, which stipulates that an equilibrium strategy profile be a Nash equilibrium in &quot;every subgame&quot;.

In a Nash equilibrium, there is some sense in which the outcome is optimal - every player is playing a best response to the other players. However, in some dynamic games this can yield implausible equilibria. Consider a two-player game in which player 1 has a strategy S to which player 2 can play B as a best response. Suppose also that S is a best response to B. Hence, {S,B} is a Nash equilibrium. Let there be another Nash equilibrium {S&#x27;,B&#x27;}, the outcome of which player 1 prefers and B&#x27; is the only best response to S&#x27;. In a dynamic game, the first Nash equilibrium is implausible (if player 1 moves first) because player 1 will play S&#x27;, forcing the response (say) B&#x27; from player 2 and thereby attaining the second equilibrium (regardless of the preferences of player 2 over the equilibria). The first equilibrium is subgame imperfect because B does not constitute a best response to S&#x27; once S&#x27; has been played, i.e. in the subgame reached by player 1 playing S&#x27;, B is not optimal for player 2.

If not all strategies at a particular node were available in a subgame containing that node, it would be unhelpful in subgame perfection. One could trivially call an equilibrium subgame perfect by ignoring playable strategies to which a strategy was not a best response. Furthermore, if subgames cut across information sets, then a Nash equilibrium in a subgame might suppose a player had information in that subgame, he did not have in the larger game.

<text>Forest Hill Community High School (FHCHS) also known as Forest Hill or The Hill, is a coeducational public high school in West Palm Beach, Florida with an enrollment of 2,457 students. The school is a part of the School District of Palm Beach County.

== History ==
The school opened as Forest Hill High School in 1959; it is situated next to the West Palm Beach Country Club and I-95 in the southwestern corner of the City of West Palm Beach on a compact tract. A larger building replaced the original structure on the same site in 2004. The school was first accredited in 1961. In the 1980s, the Palm Beach County School Board added the word &quot;Community&quot; to the names of all public high schools. Forest Hill is a public school for students in the local community, and for those coming from afar to the magnet programs held at the school.

== Academics ==
The school&#x27;s attendance boundaries encompass a culturally diverse area with a high percentage of non-native speakers of English. In order to expand the opportunities available to its student body, the school initiated many magnet programs: Information Technology, International Baccalaureate, Environmental Science, Engineering, Tourism and Hospitality, Criminal Justice and Junior Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps. In 2008, the Tourism and Hospitality magnet program introduced a marketing club, DECA, into its program; and in 2009, the club opened up the school&#x27;s first alternative breakfast cafe called Falcon Cafe, run by its members and officers.

The school also offers English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and Exceptional Student Education (ESE). The basic classes are: English, Math, Social Studies, Science, Foreign Language, Art, Physical Education, Culinary, and Woodwork.

The school ended their 37-game football losing streak on October 23, 2009. The Varsity Falcons beat Spanish River 12-7. They had the longest losing streak in the state with 43 games from 1999-2003. The win was only fifth in the decade for Forest Hill. The game was won on Forest Hill&#x27;s Senior night, the last home football game for the 2009-2010 season, except for the homecoming game, which was held on November 6, 2009.

<doc id="1286484" wikidata="Q861569" url="?curid=1286484" title="Expo 2008">
<text>Expo 2008 was an international exposition held from Saturday 14 June to Sunday 14 September 2008 in Zaragoza, Spain, with the theme of &quot;Water and Sustainable Development&quot;. The exposition was placed in a meander of the river Ebro. It was coordinated by the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE), the organization responsible for sanctioning World&#x27;s Fairs.

Zaragoza, the city of the international exposition, is the administrative and financial capital of the autonomous community of Aragon and Spain&#x27;s fifth most populous city. It was elected the host city of Expo 2008 on 16 December 2004 by the BIE, beating Thessaloniki (Greece) and Trieste (Italy).

The exhibition&#x27;s most emblematic buildings were the Torre del Agua, an high transparent building designed by Enrique de Teresa to evoke a drop of water, the Bridge Pavilion designed by Zaha Hadid, and the river aquarium. The exposition site also hosted several events, including a daily parade by Cirque du Soleil called &quot;The Awakening of the Serpent&quot;.

Aside from the countries, non-government organizations and private companies took part in Expo 2008, always with the idea of water and sustainable development. Prior to the event, the Expo 2008 host committee estimated that the exposition could generate €135 million in tickets for admission to the exhibition center.

==Spaces and exhibitions==
===Thematic pavilions===
====Bridge pavilion====
The Bridge Pavilion was one of the most emblematic buildings of Expo 2008. Designed by Zaha Hadid, it was built in two levels with the shape of a gladiolus opening and closing. It joins the neighborhood of La Almozara and the Expo site with a central island in the river Ebro.

The Bridge Pavilion hosted the exposition &quot;Water – a unique resource&quot;, designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, which tried to present water as a universal human right, to inform visitors how water is a unique resource and to explain water management procedures and encourage citizen participation.

====Torre del Agua====
The Torre del Agua was another emblematic building of Expo 2008 and its vertical icon. Designed by Enrique de Teresa, it is high with of floor space. On the top floor, there is a panoramic bar with fantastic views over Zaragoza. Inside the tower there is a high sculpture called &quot;Splash&quot;, which represents a splash of water, &quot;the arrival of life on our planet&quot;. The Splash sculpture, based on dynamic simulation systems, was designed by Mona Kim, Todd Palmer, Olga Subirós and Simon Taylor from Program Collective.

The Torre del Agua hosted the exposition &quot;Water for life&quot; where &quot;audiovisual media and lighting play a key role in the way the contents are communicated&quot;.

====Aquarium====

This thematic pavilion, which remained in operation after the expo, is the biggest freshwater aquarium in Europe, with 300 species of fauna from rivers around the world in 60 tanks or terrariums. Rivers represented are:
*The Nile: It contains species of the great African lakes. It also has crocodiles and an exhibition on the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.
*The Mekong: In this river visitors will find species of the Himalayas, gardens from the river&#x27;s lower course, the Pacific Ocean and coral reefs.
*The Amazon River: It is divided into three different areas. The first of them is the Amazon jungle with its coconut trees and mangroves. The second area is about the Amazon forest while the third area is the mangrove swamp with an exhibition on the Atlantic Ocean.
*The Murray-Darling river: This exhibition begins in the flooded regions and goes through desert areas. It finishes with a video exhibition about birds.
*The Ebro: It is also represented in two areas. The first area is a mountain cave and the second is the course of the river. There will also be an exhibition on the Mediterranean Sea.
*The &quot;World River&quot;: It represents the past, when &quot;all the continents were united as a single island surrounded by ocean&quot;.

===Thematic squares===
====Thirst====
This thematic square employed mirrors, audiovisual projections and combinations of light and sound to create optical illusions. It was in diameter, covering a total area of of which were the exposition area.

====Igloo of salt====
Designed by Cloud 9 / Enric Ruiz-Geli, this plaza&#x27;s architecture was that of an enigmatic building. It was an inflatable structure covered with salt that reflected the sun&#x27;s rays and lit up at night as if it had stored all of the necessary energy to continue to function.

This themed plaza was designed according to Expo 2008&#x27;s sustainability criteria: the use of PVC was avoided in electrical wiring, as well as tropical wood, synthetic varnish or solvent-based paints; taps made use of water-saving systems. Additionally, the frame was hired out to avoid having to demolish it once the expo was complete.

The use of EFTE in the building&#x27;s three-layered roof made air conditioning unnecessary. One of the EFTE layers was silver-plated to refract light and prevent outside heat from penetrating the building; air in the inflatable components and a Brine system irrigating them cooled the interior. All of this created a temperate building, meaning that the climate control system only needed to work against body heat produced by visitors and heat given off by equipment used in the exhibition. This way the organisers could make use of a system that was much more sustainable and inexpensive than conventional air conditioning.

====Cities of water====
This square had no walls, so its contents were visible from outside. The exhibit was about water as an &quot;urban resource&quot; and a &quot;natural element in the process of improving quality of life in cities&quot;.

====Extreme water====

This square symbolised the moment when a wave breaks on the beach. It was divided into two areas: the first was the sensorial area with 120 mobile seats where audiovisuals were projected; the second was the ideas area with interactive platforms, images and texts about water and its risks.

====Oikos, water and energy====
This exhibit was about getting energy from water.

====Shared water====
This thematic square showed visitors how political divisions affect the management of water.

====Aquatic inspirations====
This square hosted the show &quot;El hombre vertiente&quot;, created by the Argentine Pichón Baldinu, six times a day.

===Participants pavilion===
====Country pavilions====
More than one hundred countries, plus dozens of companies and NGOs, participated in Expo 2008. The confirmed list had these 104 countries (arranged in alphabetical order):

The 17 autonomous communities of Spain and two autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla also participated, as did as the United Nations and the European Union.

The pavilions for official participants were divided into eight large buildings and into five differentiated eco-geographical areas within the Expo 2008 Exposition site. Those areas were:

* Islands and Coasts
* Oasis
* Ice and snow
* Temperate Forests
* Tropical Rainforests
* Mountains and High Plains
* Grasslands, Steppes and Savannahs
* Rivers and Flat plains

The joint pavilions corresponding to the eco-geographic areas of Grasslands, Steppes and Savannahs, Tropical Rainforests and Islands and Coasts, were built by the organisers to house the pavilions of countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), respectively. The total surface area of the participating countries pavilions was .

Spain and the region of Aragon, as hosts, had their own separate pavilions. The Pavilion of Spain was designed by Patxi Mangado, and the Pavilion of Aragon, which resembled local basketweaving, by Daniel Olano.

====Citizen&#x27;s initiative pavilion====
This pavilion had the shape of a beacon, &quot;a symbol of hope for the future of water in our world&quot;. It expressed the vitality of ordinary people and non-governmental organisations.
The &quot;Beacon&quot; was situated by the Bridge Pavilion entrance.

===Gold Prize award===
The Philippines, on 19 September 2008 won the &quot;Gold Prize&quot;, the Expo&#x27;s highest award for a participating country. The award noted the quality of the Philippine pavilion&#x27;s internal and external décor, consisting of 1,000 crystal-like bubble sand, as well as its functionality, which had supreme relevance to the exposition&#x27;s theme of &quot;Water and Sustainable Development&quot;. Tourism Secretary Joseph Ace Durano said &quot;this recognition is truly well-deserved as our country’s wealthy aquatic life has been captured by the equally rich imagination of our fellowmen. While other countries utilized ultra modern technology, we chose to highlight more community-involved practices as well as natural land irrigation, aquatic recreation and marine resources preservation&quot;. The Philippine pavilion&#x27;s attractions included the meeting of the two mascots, Fluvi and Filippo, and &quot;Filipinas Te Espera Nights&quot;, a series of marketing events.

==Shows==
Expo 2008 had a 93-day-long show programme with more than 3,400 acts from more than 350 companies and artists. On the expo site, there were three shows called major events. They were:

===&quot;Iceberg&quot;===
This show was intended to be the artistic part of the Opening Ceremony, although the flood of the river Ebro in the previous days forced plans to change, as the set was situated in the middle of the river. Nevertheless, the show was presented each night starting on 20 June. The Spanish director Calixto Bieito and the scenographer Alfons Flores were responsible for the set design while the music was by José Luis Romeo. The show had a huge iceberg with a minute human figure designed by the Catalan company FOCUS.

===&quot;El hombre vertiente&quot;===
This show, created by the Argentine Pichón Baldinu, was the artistic part of the Opening Ceremony on 13 June 2008, in replacement of &quot;Iceberg&quot;. It repeated six times throughout the day at the thematic square Water Inspirations.

===&quot;The Awakening of the Serpent&quot;===
This water-themed parade took place every day at the Expo site as &quot;The Awakening of the Serpent&quot; wandered around the site. The parade&#x27;s creative director was Jean François Brouchard and its artistic director Julien Gabriel. Canada&#x27;s Cirque du Soleil participated with acrobats, actors, gymnasts, singers and musicians.

===Bob Dylan and additional American artists===
Expo 2008 officially opened with a concert by Bob Dylan, the Official Artist of Expo 2008.

Additional American artists scheduled to perform on the evening entertainment stage included Patti Smith, Robert Cray, Keb Mo, Ruben Blades, Canadian Diana Krall, The Stray Cats, Los Lobos and Gloria Estefan. A performance by Philip Glass closed Expo 2008.

==Mascot==

The Expo 2008 mascot was Fluvi, a little anthropomorphic drop of water.

With his best friend Ica, the smallest drop of water, and Nico and Laurita, he fought against the pollution made by Sec and Raspa, the evil Negas.

Several postal services, including Correos in Spain and Qatar Post in Qatar, issued postage stamps commemorating Expo 2008 which pictured Fluvi.

==After the Expo==
The exposition site and its facilities were planned thinking of their usage as a new extension of the city when the Expo finished in September 2008. The expectation was that some the buildings would be rented or transferred to several institutions. The Aragon Pavilion was to be converted into the head office of a regional ministry, while the landmark buildings of the Expo, the Torre del Agua and the Bridge Pavilion, were expected to be purchased by local financial institutions. The Spanish Pavilion was expected to be used by the University of Zaragoza to set up a new school of architecture.

The international pavilions were to be remodelled and converted into offices so that the site would become the main business park in Zaragoza. This space was also to have recreational establishments and restaurants.

Other expectations were that a great part of the site would be used for shopping establishments and for the construction of a science park for businesses.

The Aquarium, as the largest freshwater aquarium in Europe, has continued operation till the present day.

<text>Forest Hill High School is a public high school located in Jackson, Mississippi, United States. It serves students from grades 912, and is part of the Jackson Public School District. The current principal is Torrey Hampton.

==Demographics==
A total of 1,136 students were enrolled in Forest Hill High during the 2006–2007 school year. The gender makeup of the district was 51% female and 49% male. The racial makeup of the school was 96.39% African American, 2.90% White, 0.35% Hispanic, and 0.35% Asian.

==Gifted Education/Open Doors==
Gifted courses in grades 912 are offered based upon funding and teacher units provided by the state. Currently, Forest Hill High School is the only high school in the Jackson Public School District to offer gifted courses in English/language arts.

==History==
Located on 46 acres Forest Hills sits on the original site since 1915. It is the Oldest Consolidated School in Jackson, Mississippi whose origins begin in the 1800s.

==Feeder pattern==
The following schools feed into Forest Hill High School.
*Middle Schools
**Cardozo Middle School
*Elementary Schools
**Bates Elementary School
**Oak Forest Elementary School
**Timberlawn Elementary School
**Van Winkle Elementary School
==Controversy==
On October 5, 2018, the school&#x27;s band performed at halftime during a game against Brookhaven High School, where two police officers had been shot and killed earlier that week. The band&#x27;s performance was based on the film &quot;John Q.&quot;, and it simulated police being shot by band members dressed as doctors and nurses. This resulted in general outrage, and the governor, Phil Bryant, condemned the act.

Forest Hill High School also came into controversy in 2020 for having a logo and mascot associated with the Confederate States of America. During a campaign to change and remove Confederate associations, Forest Hill parted ways with the Rebel mascot and the Confederate flag logo, although the school retained its colors of red, navy, and white. At the same time, Jackson&#x27;s Robert E. Lee Elementary was renamed after Drs. Aaron and Ollye Shirley. Dr. Ollye Shirley, who was president of the Jackson Public School Board of Trustees, received death threats for lobbying for the changes at Forest Hill High School.

<text>King Edward VI Aston School is a selective, all-boys grammar school and specialist sports college. The school, designed by Birmingham architect J.A. Chatwin, opened in 1883 and is still, with additional buildings, located on its original site, in the Aston area of Birmingham, England. King Edward VI Aston Grammar School does not charge tuition fees; pupils must pass an 11-plus entrance exam to get into the school. The King Edward Schools are fiercely competitive to get admission to. The King Edward VI Foundation holds its exams at the same time, and generally, a candidiate will sit one exam for multiple schools within the foundation. 

The school is part of the Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI, which runs nine schools in Birmingham. Currently, Aston has 963 boys.

The current headteacher is Matt Brady.

==History==

The King Edward VI Aston Grammar School was opened in 1883. In 1911, the girls&#x27; school moved out to a new building in Handsworth and merged with two smaller Foundation schools (Summer Hill and Bath Row). The whole Aston building was then used for boys. With the departure of the girls, the Pyramus and Thisbe Wall (which had previously served to separate the boys from the girls) was also removed. King Edward VI Aston is the only school in the foundation that still occupies its original site. The original buildings are still in regular use, but there have been significant alterations and extensions. In 1963, the &quot;New Building&quot; was opened. More recently, the school has added a sports hall and a building to house the languages departments and has acquired the part of Frederick Road that formerly bisected the site.

The 1963 building, now known as Douglas House (after a double-fronted Victorian villa that stood on the same site), has been extended and refurbished to provide four extra laboratories, a teaching kitchen, new classrooms for art, design technology and music, a conference room, a first aid room and offices. The extension was named the Watcyn Thomas Wing, after a former Welsh Rugby International who taught at the school for 37 years. It was opened on 20 May 2008 by Bob Simpson, an Aston Old Edwardian (as former pupils are known) and governor of the school.

The school is currently building a new catering facility near the sports hall, and has already constructed a new car park at the top of Albert Road.

The school also has a school song written in the late 1800s to commemorate the stature and honour of Edward VI.

===Headmasters===
Aston has had ten headmasters:

*John Temperley – 1883—1894 (11 years)
*Ernest W. Floyd – 1894—1912 (18 years)
*Joseph Manton – 1913—1936 (23 years)
*Leonard G. Brandon – 1937—1970 (33 years)
*Dennis W. Hawley – 1970—1984 (14 years)
*Neil W. Gamble – 1985—1991 (6 years)
*Peter A. Christopher – 1992—2004 (12 years)
*Colin Parker – 2004—2020 (16 years)
*Amy Whittall – 2020—2021 (interim)
*Matt Brady – 2021—present

The average term for an Aston headmaster has been approximately sixteen years. The longest-serving was L.G. Brandon, who held the position for 33 years (one hundred terms).

==House system==
The House System within the school has a fundamental role in the school&#x27;s structure. It was introduced circa 1908 and very quickly produced a marked improvement in sporting standards. There were four houses which, until 1945, were known by the names of the Housemasters. The first of these were Jones&#x27;s (which became Floyd house), Higgs&#x27;s (which became Temperley), Lane&#x27;s and Fisher&#x27;s. The last two became Manton and School, though which was which is not clear from the records. This could be quite confusing when the housemaster changed, so in 1945 the present system was introduced.

From late 2009 until 2017, there were once more four houses, each of which took its name from a previous Headmaster at the school (i.e. Manton, house colour yellow, emblem a portcullis; Temperley, purple, Tudor rose; Floyd, blue (formerly brown), lion rampant; and Brandon, green, fleur de lis). Until it was ended in 1968, the fourth house was named School. From 2017, there is another house, Hawley, named after the headmaster from 1970-1984, Dennis W. Hawley. Its colour is silver and emblem is a shield.

The houses compete against each other throughout the year, in both sporting and non-sporting events. The culmination of the year&#x27;s sporting House achievements is represented by the presentation of the Hawkesford Trophy (for sports) and Tuck Trophy (for non-sports) to the successful Head of House.

==Sports==
Recognised as a Sports College, King Edward&#x27;s Aston offers as many as 27 sports and specialises in a good number of them during afternoon games sessions for all Year 7-11 pupils.

*Rugby (Main School Sport) - &quot;Autumn/Winter/Early Spring&quot;
*Hockey - &quot;Autumn/Winter/Early Spring&quot;
*Athletics - &quot;Spring/Summer&quot;
*Cricket - &quot;Spring/Summer&quot;
*Basketball
*Football - &quot;Spring/Summer&quot;
*Badminton
*Tennis
*Table tennis

Sixth form pupils are offered the chance to take part in sporting activities during their games lessons. This has previously included undertaking conservation work at Moseley Bog.

Every year, each house competes to win the Hawkesford Trophy and Tuck Trophy based on each house&#x27;s performance in a variety of sports, starting in October with the cross country race involving a 1-mile lap around Aston Park located next door to the school, and academic events, such as House Drama, House Economics, and House Scrabble. Throughout the three terms, there are sporting events such as football, badminton, basketball, volleyball, cricket, rugby, rugby sevens, tennis, and hockey, and it all culminates to the end-of-year sports day at nearby Alexander Stadium for Years 7-10.

===Sporting visits===
In July 2006, 35 rugby players and five staff completed a rugby tour of Australia. Previous tour destinations have included Northern Ireland and South Africa. In the summer of 2009 a tour of South Africa was completed. Additionally, each year, a group of students, usually those studying for GCSE PE, spends one week a year at Ogwen Cottage in Snowdonia, North Wales. Here, they take part in outward bounds activities such as kayaking, rock climbing, orienteering and hill walking.

==Music and drama==
Music and Drama are both very active departments within the school.

===Music===
The Music department offers tuition in almost any instrument. All boys who play an instrument are able to join one of the many ensembles in the school, ranging from the Training Band to the Big Band, which has recorded three CDs. While the school has its own String Orchestra hosted by the infamous Davidson and Concert Band, it also has a joint Orchestra with King Edward VI Handsworth. Every ensemble performs in at least one concert a year. Several of them, particularly the school Big Band, perform in many more. The department draws senior musicians from all ensembles to form pit bands for the school productions.

Each year the department is host to the annual House Music Festival in which all boys in years seven to ten have the opportunity to show off their musical talents and represent their house. The competitors are divided into several categories, by year group and instrument. Each competitor can perform in as many solo categories as they are able, and in one ensemble. The performances are judged by a visiting adjudicator.

Each year the department goes on tour and in July 1974 a number of musicians departed for Rhodesia. They met with and performed for Ian Smith and toured the country before coming under attack by the Zanu-PF on the train from Bulawayo to Pretoria.

In July 2008, many members of the same bands departed on a tour to the Rhineland.

===Drama===
The Drama department has a range of extracurricular activities going on throughout the year. Annually, alongside the girls&#x27; school, King Edward VI Handsworth, Aston puts on at least one full school production. The location of the main school play alternates each year, with both schools hosting a number of smaller productions. In recent years, Aston has staged &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, &quot;October&#x27;s Children&quot;, &quot;The Visit&quot; and Guys and Dolls. Productions of &quot;Return to the Forbidden Planet,&quot; &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;Fame&quot; have been staged at the girls&#x27; school with boys from Aston taking part.

The combined Sixth Forms of Aston and Handsworth also stage a production of one of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays once a year.

The Drama Department also holds a House competition, in the form of the House Drama Festival. In recent years, the format has changed but the objectives are still the same. Each house holds a short production and competes against each other. A panel of judges decides which production was the best.

==Festival of Cultures==
For many, the highlight of the school year is the annual Festival of Cultures held in July, after all examinations have finished. The Festival aims to celebrate the broad diversity of cultures represented in the school community. It also provides students with opportunities to take part in a wide range of activities associated with individual cultures in workshops.

Before 2005, the Festival of Cultures took place during afternoon school, and students attended one workshop. The Festival also continued into the evening, with students and their families, staff, old boys, and new students (set to join in September) invited. The evening consists of a programme of entertainment, based largely on the workshops from the day. There are also displays of art work and several food outlets, including a tea shop, a barbecue and the International Food Hall. There are also several stalls, including, for the first time in 2006, a Fair Trade stall.

However, the new format of the event sees students have a whole day off timetable, and all students in Year 7-10 attend three workshop sessions. Previous workshops have included origami, Bhangra dancing, magic, yoga and pizza making, amongst many more. Prefects and staff supervise individual workshops, whilst Senior Prefects oversee the smooth running of the event as a whole. Senior Prefects also decorate the quadrangle and piazza areas with flags and bunting to add to the festival atmosphere.

==School officers and prefects==
Each year, Aston has a School Captain, a School Vice-Captain (or two/three Vice Captains) and a team of Senior Prefects who together help to run the school with the guidance of staff. The School Captain and Vice Captains are known as the School Officers. Every other student in Year 13 is a prefect, and approximately 20 are Senior Prefects. Each Senior Prefect leads a group of prefects in a variety of different tasks across the school including prefect duties and helping to organise events such as The Festival Of Cultures. Four House Captains are also appointed at the beginning of each year.

2018-2019 was the only academic year in which was no School Captain; instead, two Vice-Captains were elected.

Research in the school&#x27;s Archive Centre has so far found the names of 100 holders of the post, stretching back to 1910.

==The Record==
&quot;The Record&quot; is the school magazine. It is published annually and highlights key events of the school year. Volume II can be traced back to 1910.

<doc id="1286501" wikidata="Q1157053" url="?curid=1286501" title="MIT Daedalus">
<text>The MIT Aeronautics and Astronautics Department&#x27;s Daedalus is a class of three human-powered aircraft that included Daedalus 88which, on 23 April 1988, flew a distance of in 3 hours, 54 minutes, from Heraklion on the island of Crete to the island of Santorini. The flight holds official FAI world records for total distance, straight-line distance, and duration for human-powered fixed-wing aircraft.

The class was named after the mythological inventor of aviation, Daedalus, and was inspired by the Greek myth of Daedalus&#x27; escape from Crete using manmade wings.

The three aircraft in the class are: 
* Light Eagle (originally Michelob Light Eagle): a prototype.
* Daedalus 87: Crashed during testing at Rogers Dry Lake (NASA Dryden Flight Research Center) on 17 February 1988, and was rebuilt as a backup.
* &quot;Daedalus 88&quot;: Flew from Crete to just off the beach on Santorini.

Both &quot;Daedalus 87&quot; and &quot;Daedalus 88&quot; weighed .

All three aircraft were constructed at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Flight Facility at Hanscom Field outside Boston, Massachusetts, by a team of undergraduate students, faculty, and recent graduates of MIT.

==History==
The MIT Daedalus project was the follow-on to several earlier human-powered aircraft flown at MIT, and was designed by veterans of the &quot;Chrysalis&quot;, &quot;Monarch A&quot; and &quot;Monarch B&quot; HPA projects.
The team members composing the Daedalus project went on to make notable contributions to experimental aeronautics such as founding the Aurora Flight Sciences company.

==Aircraft==

===Light Eagle===
&quot;Light Eagle&quot; (known to the flight crew as &quot;MLE&quot;, or &quot;Emily&quot;) set a closed-course distance record with Glen Tremml as the pilot, as well as straight-line, closed-course, and duration women&#x27;s records with Lois McCallin as pilot. These record flights took place at Edwards AFB (NASA Dryden Flight Research Center) in January, 1987.

&quot;Light Eagle&quot; had been in storage in Manassas, VA, but in 2009 was restored and adapted for use as an unmanned solar-powered aircraft testbed by Aurora Flight Sciences.

===Daedalus 87===

&quot;Daedalus 87&quot; was the first of the two Daedalus airplanes constructed, and was flight tested extensively at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center in California. During flight testing, &quot;Daedalus 87&quot; was damaged in a crash caused by spiral divergence, with the rudder not able to supply enough control authority to recover from a disturbance-initiated right turn. The aircraft suffered damage to the right wing, fuselage, and propeller. &quot;Daedalus 87&quot; was repaired and returned to service to act as a backup airplane to &quot;Daedalus 88&quot;.

&quot;Daedalus 87&quot; was on display in the lobby at the Museum of Science, Boston until 2009, and is now on display above the tram stop for Terminal B at Dulles Airport outside Washington, DC.

===Daedalus 88===
The final aircraft in the MIT Daedalus series, &quot;Daedalus 88&quot;, was used in the flight from Crete. 
Pieces of &quot;Daedalus 88&quot; are now in storage at the Smithsonian&#x27;s restoration facility.

Both Daedalus aircraft were constructed with a framework of carbon fiber tubes. Airfoil shape for the wing and tail elements was maintained with a thin polystyrene foam leading edge, polystyrene ribs, and a Kevlar trailing edge. Wing skin was Mylar plastic of approximately 0.3 mil (8 μm) thickness. The bottom portion of the fuselage and majority of the pilot seat were made of Kevlar as well. Horizontal and vertical stabilizers were &quot;all-moving&quot; control surfaces.

==Airfoils==
Mark Drela had recently written the program XFOIL, which enables the design of aerofoils and accurately predicts performance at a wide range of Reynolds numbers. 
The wing sections never existed on paper, either as lists of numbers or as drawings. The information came out of the design program onto disc, and this guided the cutter.
The spar of the MLE (Michelob Light Eagle) was three tubes aligned vertically.

This scheme was abandoned for the final Daedalus design where the more usual single tube was used. Construction of Light Eagle took 15,000 hours work by 18 members of MIT.
The airfoils which were used are: DAE11, DAE21, DAE31, and DAE51.

==Record-setting flight==
The record-setting flight of &quot;Daedalus 88&quot; had as pilot Olympic cyclist Kanellos Kanellopoulos of Greece. The flight began at the main airport of Iraklion, on Crete, with a horizontal launch under the pilot&#x27;s own power, as governed by FAI rules. During the flight, the Daedalus flew primarily between 15 and 30 feet in altitude, and was accompanied by several escort vessels. The speed of the flight was helped by a tailwind, but this also made a head-on landing approach to the narrow beach hazardous, especially with crowds of spectators on the sand. The pilot maneuvered the aircraft to land more into the wind and parallel with the length of the beach. As the right wing extended over the black sand beach, the heat rising from the beach lifted that wing, turning the aircraft back towards the sea. This effect prevented the pilot from getting the whole aircraft onto the beach.

The flight ended in the water (7 meters from Perissa Beach on Santorini, according to the official record), when increasing gusty winds caused a torsional failure of the tail boom. Lacking control, the airplane then pitched nose-up, and another gust caused a failure of the main wing spar. The pilot swam to shore.

The pilot used a hydration drink during flight. This feat was equivalent to two back-to-back marathons.

<doc id="1286504" wikidata="Q6411524" url="?curid=1286504" title="King Edward VI Five Ways School">
<text>King Edward VI Five Ways (KEFW) is a selective co-educational state grammar school for ages 11–18 in Bartley Green, Birmingham, United Kingdom. One of the seven establishments of the Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI, it is a voluntary aided school, with admission by highly selective examination. It was founded in Five Ways, Birmingham in 1883 and retained its name when it moved to Bartley Green in 1958.

==Background==

It was first in the school league tables in 2007. Currently the school has around 1000 pupils in attendance amongst the lower school (years 7-11) and over 100 staff, many of whom are former pupils, as well as around 400 in the school&#x27;s sixth form. The school is unique amongst the King Edward VI Foundation, being the only fully co-educational one. The school scored &quot;good&quot; in the latest Ofsted report in 2023. The school is Voluntary Aided. Parents are asked to make a voluntary contribution each year of around £30 per pupil to provide extras and benefits for all school pupils throughout the year. The school uses some unusual terminology, matching that of other Foundation schools, such as naming reading time &quot;DEER&quot; or naming homework &quot;HIPPO&quot;, though not all teachers employ these terms.

== History ==


Established as a boys&#x27; school in 1883, part of the King Edward VI Foundation, the school&#x27;s original building was that of the former Edgbaston Proprietary School, on Hagley Road at its junction with Ladywood Road, at Five Ways, approximately 1 mile south-west of Birmingham city centre. The school, designed by J.A. Chatwin was opened on 16 January 1883 by A. J. Mundella with provision for 350 boys the Headmaster being E.F.M. MacCarthy, formerly a master at the main King Edward&#x27;s School. He remained in the post until retirement in 1916, and now has a building named after him at the Bartley Green site. Originally the school educated only up to age 16, Fifth Form, and to go to Oxbridge a pupil had to transfer to the main King Edward&#x27;s School, at the time in New Street. However, MacCarthy&#x27;s successor, Mr Barker, introduced a Sixth Form.

During the Second World War, the Headmaster at the time, Mr Dobinson, decided to evacuate the school to Monmouth, and the boys attended Monmouth School, the two staffs sharing the teaching. This meant that all the staff and pupils were lodged in the town, and could only keep in contact with family via correspondence; Mr Dobinson was able occasionally to visit Birmingham.

After the war the school was becoming overcrowded, but due to development around the school there was no opportunity to expand, so a new site was found. On 23 April 1958 the school opened at its current home in Bartley Green, a suburb on the extreme south-west of Birmingham. The new school was built on the site of the Bartley Farm, which had been purchased by the Foundation, next to Bartley Reservoir. The site was elevated, and in the winter a bleak place.

The relocation was not universally popular. The School Debating Society passed a motion regretting the move. Staff were concerned about the effect the relocation to such a distant suburb would have on the school&#x27;s intake, which because of the central position had been drawn from the whole city; many boys who had joined the school at Five Ways, easily reached from all parts of the city, suddenly had considerably longer journeys to its new remote location. This undoubtedly affected admissions in later years. Then the school&#x27;s corridors were considered too narrow especially around the original core block of the school, and whilst the playing fields were extensive the school buildings themselves were small and rather basic, with limited common areas.

Many additions have been made to the original 1958 buildings. These include a music block, a technology block, a sports hall and the MacCarthy Block. The Eyles Centre was built to house the school&#x27;s Sixth Form. It has since been replaced by the Chowen Sixth Form Centre, and the Eyles Centre has been renovated to become a new music block. The old music building is now a large computer suite and staff offices. There has also been the expansion of the Science Wing, and increased seating capacity in the hall with an annex and balcony, as well as the Fitness Suite and extension to the art rooms in the MacCarthy Block. In recent years, a sports pavilion, a new astro turf playing field, a mobile classroom, a languages centre, and an Observatory have been built, it is important to note that the mobile classroom was rebuilt, the old mobile classroom(nicknamed &#x27;the shed&#x27; by the pupils) was built in 2014 and was rebuilt in early 2024. 

Five Ways introduced computer technology in 1978, using a communications link to mainframe facilities at Aston University.

Girls have been admitted to Five Ways since 1988, first in the Sixth Form, then in the main school ten years later. Today Five Ways is the largest co-educational grammar school in the West Midlands, and one of the top five co-ed grammar schools nationally.

===Headteachers===
The school has had 12 Headmasters and 2 Headmistresses in its history. 
#Revd Egerton Francis Mead MacCarthy 1883 – 1916
#Arthur Ernest Barker 1916 – 1933
#Charles Henry Dobinson 1933 – 1945 (afterwards Reader in Education at Oxford University and Tutor in the University Department of Education)
#Harry Robert Roach 1946 – 1951
#Thomas Charles Burgess 1951 – 1963 (Oversaw move to Bartley Green; died in post) 
#Roland Mathias 1964 – 1969
#Peter Rodney Watkins 1969 – 1974
#Geoffrey Sanders 1974 – 1990
#Revd John G. Knowles 1990 – 1999
#Peter Limm 1999 – 2002
#David Wheeldon 2002 – 2012
#Yvonne Wilkinson 2012 – 2021
#Charlotte M. Jordan 2021 – 2023
#Dr Simon N Bird 2024 - current
Yvonne Wilkinson was Acting Headmistress from September to December 2002, the first Headmistress in the school&#x27;s history, although as she served in an acting capacity for only one term it was not properly a Headmistresship. She returned as the first actual headmistress from the start of the 2012–2013 school year, after a headship at Gateways School, Leeds.

Linda Johnson was acting as Interim Headmistress since February 2023 as Charlotte Jordan left her role after releasing a list of striking staff to parents on 15 February, causing a data breach. Dr Simon N Bird, former Handsworth Grammar School headmaster, took leadership in early 2024. This is the first headmaster of Five Ways in 12 years.

==Entry==
Pupils must pass an 11-plus entrance exam to get into the school. The entrance examination is tough and only 1 in 10 is successful. The King Edward VI Foundation holds its exams at the same time, and generally a candidate will sit one exam for multiple schools within the foundation. Formerly 155 were selected from each year, from more than 1,500 candidates; with a few more accepted every year on appeal. From September 2014 the school increased its intake to 180 pupils in Year 7. A pupil has the opportunity to list the Foundation schools that he or she prefers, and depending on the results, may get allocated into one of the schools.

Students can also enter the school at sixth form level, with places awarded based on GCSE grades, requiring at least a 7 in any subject to be taken, 8 in Maths to take Further Maths, and a 6 in English and Maths if they do not already form part of the offer. Places are highly competitive with students applying from all over Birmingham and the surrounding areas. There are approximately 50 external candidates in each year. Pupils studying at the school in the lower years must get an additional four 7s (or five 8s if they wish to take four A-levels). The Sixth Form has approximately 210 students in each L6 and U6.

== Subjects offered ==

At GCSE, students are obliged to choose at least one humanities subject between History and Geography, at least one foreign language (options include French, German, Latin and Spanish), and other traditional subjects such as Biology, Chemistry and Physics (can be separated into either Combined or Triple/Single Science), Maths, English Language, English Literature and Religious Studies. Other options include: Music, Art, Drama, Food Preparation and Nutrition, Design and Technology, Physical Education, Computer Science and OSLA (Outdoor Skills Leadership and Adventure) which is a school funded option and does not count as a GCSE but does provide awards including the Climbing NICAS Award, the BCU Star Awards, Advanced First Aid Qualifications and the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze Award.

Previously, four subjects were picked at AS Level. However, from 2017 students are now expected to choose three subjects to complete at A Level and to complete an Extended Project Qualification. Options exclusive to A Level studies are: Business, Economics, Government &amp; Politics, Law, Classical Civilisation, Sport Studies, Psychology, Sociology and Philosophy as well as courses from down the school. There is also a Further Maths option, which enables a candidate to take two A Levels, one in Mathematics, one in Further Maths, over the two years. From 2013, the school no longer offers IB courses. Candidates taking four A-levels are not allowed to complete an Extended Project Qualification.

The International Baccalaureate took its first cohort of students in 2011. For the first 2-year course a variety of SL and HL subjects have been offered along with TOK (Theory of Knowledge). Subjects World Literature and Mathematics are compulsory but are at SL and HL. One subject from Biology, Chemistry or Physics must be chosen at SL or HL. One subject from History, Geography or Economics must be chosen at SL or HL. One subject from French, Spanish, German (and hopefully in the future Mandarin and Latin) at ab initio [from scratch] level, SL or HL. One more option is fulfilled by a science, humanities or foreign language option or the choice of Visual Arts at SL or HL. In March 2013 prospective students were informed that the International Baccalaureate will no longer be offered due to lack of interest and applications from internal Year 11 students who wished to stay on the next year, and timetable and staffing constraints. The school now offers the English Baccalaureate (Ebacc) which is a nationwide GCSE achievement.

<text>King Edward VI Handsworth School for Girls is a grammar school for girls aged 11–18 located in Handsworth, Birmingham, England. It is part of the Foundation of the Schools of King Edward VI. The school was founded in 1883 as King Edward&#x27;s Aston on the site where its brother school, King Edward VI Aston School, remains to this day. In 2019 there were 1086 girls on roll. Pupils must pass an 11-plus entrance exam to get into the school. The King Edward Schools are fiercely competitive to get admission to, as only 1 in 10 are successful in passing the entrance exam. The King Edward VI Foundation holds its exams at the same time, and generally a candidate will sit one exam for multiple schools within the foundation. Notable leaver&#x27;s destinations from this school in previous years have been Birmingham, Aston, Oxford, and Nottingham. The leavers destinations by course were mainly medicine, dentistry, law, business studies and computer science.

The school has a record of high attainment and was deemed &#x27;outstanding&#x27; in its last Ofsted inspection. In 2019, the Birmingham Mail ranked it as the second best school in the West Midlands, down from first place in 2018. Since 2017, GCSE pupils at King Edward VI Handsworth have consistently achieved exceptionally good results. According to the Times League Table, King Edward VI Handsworth School for Girls was ranked 13 in all of the United Kingdom.

==History==
When King Edward VI Grammar School for Girls opened in 1883 the first head was Margaret Nimmo who had previously been second mistress and the first graduate teacher at Blackheath High School. The school was then in the Aston area of Birmingham and it had 300 girls to educate. Half of the schools scholarships were given to girls from public elementary schools. The education approaches were information, Rote learning and competition.

Margaret Nimmo moved her school to Rosehill Road in Handsworth where it has merged with two others opening again in 1911 in a new building. The new school at Handsworth cost £50,000 to build. The architect was P. B. Chatwin and he designed a building with a number of specialist areas which included the library and the &quot;playroom&quot; (a whole school common-room).

By 1915 the school role was 460. The school&#x27;s science and gymnastics facilities were poor but the school sent many on to universities. When the school first opened, and for many years afterwards, girls were not permitted to eat in the street and had to wear gloves on the journey to and from school.

In the beginning, the sixth form was very small with as few as 6 pupils in a year. Transfer to King Edward VI High School for Girls for sixth form studies was not unusual.

The school was built on a slope, there are two ground floors, and originally the gymnasium was located in the room on the lower ground floor later used as a Music room.

Since the renovation of the church (bought by the school) into a music centre, this room is now used as an ICT suite.

To celebrate the centenary of the school in 1983 a new block was built to house a meeting room and the changing rooms for the sports field. In 1997 a new Sixth Form block was built with the help of the King Edward VI Foundation fund. In 2005, the new sports hall was built, using sponsorship money from companies such as O2, and a church organ was bought by the school to be renovated and used for music studies. The school also gained specialist performing arts status. 2011 saw the building of a new library by the field; a modern building with a slanting roof and colourful window panes. This includes a mezzanine area upstairs with computers.

Latin was also removed from the curriculum in 2004 and replaced with drama, which had previously been on the curriculum in the late 20th century.

===Houses===
School Houses were introduced at the beginning of the 20th century, with each House having its own name and colour. Nightingale house was mauve, Kingsley house was green, Fry was pale blue and Browning was brown.

By the 1930s there were awards given for winning competitions against other houses in sports. In the beginning there were House notices in the Playroom and a strict House conduct system.
In 1939 four more Houses were added and they were renamed after the different royal Houses – Windsor, Stuart, Tudor, Hanover, Plantagenet, Lancaster, York, Normandy.

In the 1970s the houses were rearranged again and given names of precious stones – Amethyst, Coral, Garnet and Topaz, because of the school&#x27;s proximity to the Jewellery Quarter.

At the end of the 1990s they were renamed once more after famous women – Brontë, Pankhurst, Franklin and Nightingale, and when an extra form group was introduced in 2003 the new house of Curie, then un-introduced in 2005.

In September 2009 the houses were renamed, once again after famous women, this time – Parks (yellow), Keller (blue), Astor (green) and Cavell (red)).

In September 2020, the house Astor (green) was renamed Baker - after Noor Inayat Khan.

In December 2024, houses Curie (orange) and Nightingale (purple) were reintroduced- named after Marie Curie and Florence Nightingale.

==The Beacon==
An annual magazine written by the lower sixth form is released every year, called The Beacon.

==Uniform==
The school has a strict code of conduct and the uniform is based around navy blue.

==Notable former pupils==

*Emma B, radio presenter
*Felicity Jones, actress
*Abigail Kelly, soprano opera and concert singer 
*Sarah Manners, actress
*Flora Spencer-Longhurst, actress
*Zarah Sultana, Labour MP

A society for alumni, the Handsworth Old Edwardians&#x27; Society (HOES), has been running since the turn of the 20th century. The society holds meetings for former pupils of all ages three times a year at the school.

<text>Michael Robert Gale (born May 25, 1951) is an American screenwriter, comic book writer, film producer and director. He is best known for co-writing the science fiction comedy film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; with his writing partner Robert Zemeckis. Gale co-produced all three films of the franchise and later served as associate producer of the animated TV series. Actor Michael J. Fox has referred to Gale as the &quot;gatekeeper of the [&quot;Back to the Future&quot;] franchise&quot;.

==Early life==
Gale was born to a Jewish family in University City, Missouri; he is the son of Maxine (née Kippel and died in 2010), an art dealer and violinist, and Mark R. Gale (1922–2018), an attorney. Mark Gale was a World War II veteran and later a University City councilman. Bob Gale has two younger brothers: Charlie, who wrote the screenplay for &quot;Ernest Scared Stupid&quot;, and Randy. Bob Gale received a B.A. in Cinema in 1973 from the University of Southern California, where he wrote fanzine reviews for classmate Mike Glyer&#x27;s fanzine, and met Zemeckis, who was his classmate.

As a child, Gale dreamed he would one day &quot;go to Hollywood and work for Walt Disney&quot;, who was his hero. As a teen, he created his own comic book, &quot;The Green Vomit&quot;, using spirit duplication; he was the co-founder of a popular comic book club in St. Louis. Later he and his brother Charlie made their own amateur three-film series parody of the Republic Pictures &quot;Commando Cody&quot; serials, using the character name &quot;Commando Cus&quot;. The last two films were made in collaboration with Richard Rosenberg. (Rosenberg had taken over the series with the third, 1973&#x27;s &quot;Commando Cus vs. Kung Fu Killers&quot;, in which Gale made a cameo appearance as the title character without his face-covering helmet, and was working on a fourth at the time of his death.)

==Career==
===Film===
As screenwriters Gale and Zemeckis have collaborated on a number of films including &quot;1941&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot;, &quot;Used Cars&quot;, and &quot;Trespass&quot;. The last one was set in East St. Louis, Illinois, near Gale&#x27;s home town. Gale and Zemeckis were nominated for an Academy Award for their screenplay for &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. In 2002, Gale made his debut as a feature-film director with &quot;Interstate 60: Episodes of the Road&quot;. He had previously directed and written the 20-minute theatrical release &quot;Mr. Payback: An Interactive Movie&quot;. Gale&#x27;s other work includes the novelization for his movie &quot;1941&quot; and he helped develop the unreleased arcade game &quot;Tattoo Assassins&quot;.

Gale, formerly a member of Writers Guild of America West, left and maintained financial core status in 1990.

Gale wrote the book and was a producer for the stage musical adaptation of the first &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film, which premiered in Manchester in 2020, then on the West End in 2021. The musical transferred to Broadway in August 2023 and closed in January 2025. The show is touring nationally, with international productions in Tokyo and Sydney.

===Comics===
As a teenager, Bob Gale was a regular Marvel reader, and his fan letters appeared in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #98, published in February 1968, and &quot;Iron Man&quot; #2-3, published in June-July 1968.

Gale began writing for comics in the late 90s, and his earliest work includes &quot;Ant-Man&#x27;s Big Christmas&quot; for Marvel and &quot;Batman&quot; for DC Comics. In 2001, he had a short run on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Daredevil&quot; with artists Phil Winslade and Dave Ross. In 2008, Gale worked as one of the writers among the rotating writer/artist teams on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, which at the time was published three times a month. His other work in comics includes the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; monthly series published by IDW Publishing. The first issue was released in stores on October 21, 2015, which is the same date that Marty travels with Doc Brown to the future; the comic book is shown as part of the storyline for &quot;Part II&quot;.

===Novels===

In 1979, Gale published a novelization of &quot;1941&quot;. In 2013, he published &quot;Retribution High&quot;, a novel based on his unproduced screenplay.

<doc id="1286520" wikidata="Q38688" url="?curid=1286520" title="Giant Schnauzer">
<text>The Giant Schnauzer is a breed of dog developed in the 17th century in Germany. It is the largest of the three breeds of Schnauzerthe other two breeds being the Standard Schnauzer and the Miniature Schnauzer. Originally bred to assist on farms by driving livestock to market and guarding the farmer&#x27;s property, the breed eventually moved into the city, where it worked guarding breweries, butchers&#x27; shops, stockyards and factories. It was unknown outside of Bavaria until it became popular as a military dog during World War I and World War II.

It has a dense coarse coat that protects it from the weather and from vermin. Giant Schnauzers come in three color varieties: pepper and salt, pure black with black undercoat, and black and silver. Where legal, it is shown with cropped ears and docked tails. Like other schnauzers, it has a distinct beard and eyebrows. Today, the Giant Schnauzer participates in numerous dog sports, including Schutzhund. Another sport that the dog excels in is that of nosework. Due to its alert nature, the dog is also used in police work.

==History==
The first Giant Schnauzers emerged from Swabia in the German state of Bavaria, and Württemberg in the 17th century. These dogs were considered a rough-coated version of the German Pinscher breeds, and their hair was thought to help them withstand the harsh German winters and bites from vermin. The origins of the breed are unclear, but sources speculate possible ancestors include black Great Danes, German Shepherds, Rottweilers, Dobermanns, Boxers, Bouvier des Flandres, Thuringian Shepherds, and the Standard Schnauzer.

The Giant Schnauzer was originally bred as a multipurpose farm dog for guarding property and driving animals to market. By the turn of the 20th century it was being used as a watchdog at factories, breweries, butcheries, and stockyards throughout Bavaria. The breed was unknown outside Bavaria until it was used as a military dog in World War I and World War II. The first Giant Schnauzers were imported to America in the 1930s, but they remained rare until the 1960s, when the breed became popular. In 1962, there were 23 new Giant Schnauzers registered with the American Kennel Club; in 1974 this number was 386; in 1984 it was over 800 and in 1987 it was around 1000 animals. This declined to 95 new dogs registered in 2011, and 94 in 2012. 

In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer is used as a police dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and Schutzhund; and is shown in conformation shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered to be more of a working dog than a show dog.The focus in many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.

==Description==
===Appearance===
Although the Giant Schnauzer is a large and stocky dog, the &#x27;Giant&#x27;, in its name is not in comparison to other large dog breeds but in comparison to the Standard and Miniature Schnauzers. The AKC breed standard calls for males to stand from at the withers, and for females to stand from . Giant Schnauzers are square in shape, and should resemble a larger version of the Standard Schnauzer. The tail is long and the ears are small button ears carried high on the head. Where it is legal, it is possibly docked and the ears cropped.

The head is the length of the dog&#x27;s back, when the back is measured from the withers to the base of the tail. The cheeks are flat, but well muscled. The coat is dense, wiry, and weather resistant. The fur on the dog&#x27;s face forms a distinct &quot;beard&quot; and eyebrows. Its stride is long and crisp.

===Temperament===
Giant Schnauzers are usually a quiet breed. Due to its breeding, the Giant Schnauzer is inherently suspicious of strangers and can be very territorial. Once introduced, it is usually accepting of novel people or situations. It has the potential to be aggressive, but Giant Schnauzers are usually reserved – they are &quot;amiable in repose, and a commanding figure when aroused&quot;.

Giant Schnauzers have been described as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are also very energetic and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted and destructive behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. They are known to become highly imprinted to their owners. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy for the Giant Schnauzer of 12.1 years, compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

The dogs require regular grooming. Their beard can collect drool and food particles, making frequent cleanings essential. If being shown, their coat needs to be stripped every two to four weeks. If they are simply a companion animal, the coat can be clipped instead. Some animals have an allergy to shampoo.

Hip and elbow dysplasia are common. The breed is also prone to eye problems such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. It is also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored dogs, with the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.

Some Giant Schnauzers develop central diabetes insipidus, autosomal recessive hypothyroidism, selective malabsorption of cobalamin, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and various seizure disorders. Some are also sensitive to sulphonamides and gold. Bone diseases and joint problems are also an issue. The most common causes of death of the dog in a Kennel Club survey were lymphoma and liver cancer, followed by heart attacks and heart failure.

<text>William Nicholas Stone Courtney (16 December 1929 – 22 February 2011) was an Egyptian-born British actor. He was best known for his long-running role as Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart in the BBC science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

==Early life==

Nicholas Courtney was born 16 December 1929 in Cairo, Egypt, the son of Major Geoffrey William Courtney, a British army officer and diplomat, and Evelyn (&quot;née&quot; Stout). His paternal grandparents were the Oxford academic and journalist William Leonard Courtney and his first wife, Cordelia (&quot;née&quot; Place). His grandfather, W. L. Courtney, had been an amateur actor during his tenure at Oxford University and was involved in the early productions in the New Theatre by the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Nicholas&#x27; parents separated in 1931, when his mother Evelyn left the household. He was raised by his father and stepmother Anne (&quot;née&quot; Perrott), who married Geoffrey Courtney in 1938.

Courtney was educated in France, Kenya and Egypt and attended a public school in Kent. On his maternal side, he was descended from New Zealand politician John Cuff. He performed national service in the British Army, leaving after 18 months as a private, not wanting to pursue a military career. He moved to England to join London&#x27;s Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. After two years of repertory theatre in Northampton, he became resident in London in 1961.

Courtney&#x27;s first television work was in the 1957 series &quot;Escape&quot;. He made guest appearances in several cult television series, including &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1962, 1967), &quot;The Champions&quot; (1968), &quot;Randall and Hopkirk&quot; (1969) and as a racing driver in &quot;Riviera Police&quot; (1965), and briefly appeared as a TV panel chairman in the film &quot;Take a Girl Like You&quot; (1970), hosting a debate between John Bird and John Fortune.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
During William Hartnell&#x27;s tenure as the First Doctor, director Douglas Camfield originally considered Courtney for the role of Richard the Lionheart in the serial &quot;The Crusade&quot; (1965), a role that ultimately went to Julian Glover. Camfield kept Courtney in mind for future roles, and later that year cast him in &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, in which he played Space Security Agent Bret Vyon.

Camfield liked Courtney&#x27;s performance, and when the director was assigned the 1968 serial &quot;The Web of Fear&quot;, he initially cast Courtney as Captain Knight. When David Langton gave up the role of Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart to work elsewhere, Camfield recast Captain Knight and gave the part to Courtney instead. The Lethbridge-Stewart character returned in the next season in &quot;The Invasion&quot;, promoted to the rank of brigadier, and in charge of the British contingent of UNIT. The organisation had been charged with protecting Earth from alien invasion. Years later, actor and writer Ian Marter (who played UNIT medical officer Harry Sullivan alongside Tom Baker) named a Russian military base used in &quot;The Invasion&quot;, but unnamed on screen, &quot;Nykortny&quot; in his novelisation of the story.

In this recurring role, he appeared semi-regularly in 101 episodes between 1970 and 1975. The character proved popular enough to return in 1983, first in &quot;Mawdryn Undead&quot; and in the official 20th anniversary special &quot;The Five Doctors&quot;. Courtney made his final appearance in the 1989 serial &quot;Battlefield&quot; (although like many other former cast members, he reprised the role for the charity special &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;). He appeared with Jean Marsh in both his first and last regular &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television appearances. Jean Marsh portrayed the character of Sara Kingdom in Courtney&#x27;s first appearance, &quot;The Daleks&#x27; Master Plan&quot;, playing his character&#x27;s sister. In Courtney&#x27;s final appearance on the show, Marsh portrayed the villainous Morgaine in the Arthurian-inspired &quot;Battlefield&quot;. Marsh also appeared in the earlier story &quot;The Crusade&quot; for which Courtney had been considered.
Courtney played Lethbridge-Stewart, either on television or in spin-off audio plays, alongside every subsequent Doctor up to and including Paul McGann, as well as substitute First Doctor Richard Hurndall. He did not act in the revived series, but appeared in archive footage. While he acted with Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant in the Big Finish audio dramas &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; and &quot;&quot;, Tennant was playing a different character, Colonel Ross Brimmicombe-Wood, on both occasions.

Fifteen years after &quot;Dimensions in Time&quot;, Courtney returned as Lethbridge-Stewart (now, Sir Alistair), freshly returned from Peru, in &quot;Enemy of the Bane&quot; (2008), a two-part story in the Doctor Who spin-off &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, starring Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith. The &quot;Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; production team intended that Courtney would reappear in the following year&#x27;s &quot;The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith&quot; so that Lethbridge-Stewart would meet the Tenth Doctor, but Courtney was recovering from a stroke and unable to take part.

Following Courtney&#x27;s death on 22 February 2011, Lethbridge-Stewart was written out as having also died; when the Eleventh Doctor wanted to contact him in &quot;The Wedding of River Song&quot;, he was informed that Sir Alistair has died some months earlier at his nursing home. The Brigadier was mentioned several times in the series&#x27; golden anniversary episode, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, and quoted once; and, with a prominent close-up of his archival portrait, Courtney is the only individual to appear in all the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; anniversary stories prior to &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;.

In a 2008 interview, Courtney criticised the pacing of the new series of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, saying: &quot;It’s all a bit rushed sometimes. It’s a heck of a lot to get in in three quarters of an hour, the whole story. In the old days, it used to be half an hour every Saturday for four Saturdays, or six Saturdays, so it does all seem to be a bit of a rush. In fact, it leaves me rather gasping for breath sometimes.&quot; Courtney also commented: &quot;I think people’s attention span is more limited than it used to be.&quot;

==After &quot;Doctor Who&quot;==
Courtney continued to act extensively in theatre and television after his main &quot;Doctor Who&quot; appearances, guest-starring in television programmes including &quot;Whodunnit?&quot; in 1977, where he appeared again with Jon Pertwee, &quot;Minder&quot; (1984), &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; (1980, episode &quot;Matters of Life And Death&quot;), &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; (1988) and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; (1986), and the 1984 television movie &quot;To Catch a King&quot;. In 1982 he was cast alongside Frankie Howerd in the World War II-set comedy series &quot;Then Churchill Said to Me&quot; but the series remained untransmitted for over a decade due to the outbreak of the Falklands War. He also had a regular role in the comedy &quot;French Fields&quot; between 1989 and 1991.

Courtney also appeared in an episode of the long-running BBC TV series &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; alongside Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett as the character of &#x27;Captain Dickie Chapman&#x27;, a fellow prisoner-of-war (POW) in Colditz during World War II, in a sketch based on the original BBC serial, &quot;Colditz&quot;.

In 1985, Courtney played &#x27;The Narrator&#x27; in &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot;. In 1989 he portrayed Temple in the BBC Radio 4 adaption of John Wyndham&#x27;s &quot;Survival&quot;. He also appeared briefly in the 1990 film &quot;Bullseye!&quot;, directed by Michael Winner.

Courtney also appeared in the Big Finish Productions audio drama &quot;Earthsearch Mindwarp&quot;, based on a James Follett novel, broadcast on the digital radio station BBC 7. Courtney starred as Inspector Lionheart opposite fellow &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Terry Molloy in the audio series &quot;The Scarifyers&quot;, from Cosmic Hobo Productions. The first two &quot;Scarifyers&quot; adventures, &quot;The Nazad Conspiracy&quot; and &quot;The Devil of Denge Marsh&quot;, were broadcast on BBC 7 in 2007; the third, entitled &quot;For King and Country&quot; in 2008, and fourth, &quot;The Curse of the Black Comet&quot;, in 2010. He also appeared in three episodes of &quot;Kaldor City&quot; as the newscaster Danl Packard. He regularly made personal appearances at science fiction conventions and in 1997 was made the honorary president of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society. Courtney also appeared in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s five part chilling radio drama &quot;Outbreak of Fear&quot; by R.D. Wingfield in the 1980s (repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra up to August 2017 in stereo only on TV and online - not DAB).

In 1998, Courtney released his autobiography, titled &quot;Five Rounds Rapid!&quot; () after a line of dialogue the Brigadier had in the 1971 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Dæmons&quot;. He recorded his memoirs, subtitled &quot;A Soldier in Time&quot; for release on CD in 2002 by Big Finish. In 2008 he appeared in the film &quot;Incendiary&quot;, as the Archbishop of Canterbury, alongside Ewan McGregor.

Courtney&#x27;s updated autobiography, &quot;Still Getting Away With It&quot; (), was published in 2005, with co-author Michael McManus.

==Death==
Courtney&#x27;s death was reported by &quot;SFX&quot; and &quot;The Stage&quot; early in the morning of 23 February 2011. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio play producers Big Finish, with whom Courtney had worked on several releases in his continuing role as the Brigadier, confirmed the date of his death as 22 February 2011. The BBC reported that he had &quot;died in London at the age of 81&quot;.

According to Courtney&#x27;s official website, he died following a brief illness. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; writer Mark Gatiss called him &quot;a childhood hero and the sweetest of gentlemen&quot;. Former &quot;Doctor Who&quot; co-star Tom Baker also paid tribute, having visited him on the Friday before his death. Baker wrote &quot;We shall miss him terribly&quot; in a newsletter on his website, in which he also indicated that Courtney had been battling cancer for a few months prior to his death.

<doc id="1286552" wikidata="Q717900" url="?curid=1286552" title="District of Columbia Route 295">
<text>District of Columbia Route 295 (DC 295), also known as the Anacostia Freeway as well as the Kenilworth Avenue Freeway north of East Capitol Street, is a freeway in the District of Columbia, and currently the only signed numbered route in the District that is not an Interstate Highway or U.S. Highway. Also, DC 295 is one of the few city-level signed route numbers in the United States, along with Charlotte Route 4. The south end is at the junction of I-295, I-695, and the southern end of the 11th Street Bridges, though I-295 was originally part of DC 295. Its north end is at the border with Maryland where it connects to MD 295 (the Baltimore–Washington Parkway) and US 50 via MD 201.

==Route description==

DC 295 starts at a split from I-295 and I-695 at the 11th Street Bridges in Anacostia. From there, it continues northeasterly along the Anacostia River to the DC-Maryland border. Mileposts continue the sequence of I-295 from the split. Frontage roads near the north end are known as Kenilworth Avenue, which is the name of MD 201 after splitting from the main freeway. DC 295 is part of the National Highway System.

==History==

What is now DC 295 was originally part of two separate highways: the Anacostia Freeway and the Kenilworth Expressway. It was first conceived by the National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1950 as a connector route between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway at Kenilworth Avenue and the Capital Beltway near Oxon Hill. The route would provide access to the Anacostia waterfront, which included Bolling Air Force Base and the Anacostia Naval Station. In 1955, District officials approved the portion of the route between Suitland Parkway and East Capitol Street; the remainder of the route was approved in 1956. The southern portion of the route, from the Beltway to the 11th Street Bridges, was given a financial boost when it was included in the Interstate Highway System. The route was designated I-295 by AASHTO in 1958.

Work on the Kenilworth Expressway, the portion from East Capitol to the Baltimore-Washington Parkway, began in 1952 and ended in October 1957. Construction of the Expressway included four pedestrian bridges over it. It was all part of the same project that built the East Capitol Street Bridge at the time. The Kenilworth Interchange, between the Expressway, US-50 and the Parkway started work in 1956 and ended at the same time as the Expressway.

Initial construction of the Anacostia Freeway began in the summer of 1957 with the East Capitol Street overpass over Kenilworth Avenue and was completed in 1964. The final part of the project, the connecting ramps to the 11th Street Bridges opened the following year.

The Expressway between Benning Road and the District Line was built on the right of way of the former Benning streetcar line, which is why parts of it are narrow with short entrances and exits. Until May 1, 1949, streetcar routes 10 and 12 operated from downtown to Deane Avenue. Route 10 continued to Kenilworth, just inside the District Line. Route 12 turned off and ran to Seat Pleasant. That right of way was later paved and it is now called Nannie Helen Burroughs Avenue.

The southern portion of the Anacostia Freeway, I-295, officially ends on a ramp to the 11th Street Bridges, though it originally referred to everything south to Oxon Cove. For years the northern portion between there and the District Line was often referred to as Route 295 even though it bore no such markings. It was not long after parts of the Baltimore-Washington Parkway in Maryland were numbered MD 295 in the 1980s that the District of Columbia numbered its portion as DC 295.

==Exit list==
Exit numbers were added in 2014 as part of the 11th Street Bridges reconstruction. The entire route is in Washington, D.C.

<text>HMAS &quot;Vampire&quot; was the third of three Australian-built s serving in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). One of the first all-welded ships built in Australia, she was constructed at Cockatoo Island Dockyard between 1952 and 1959, and was commissioned into the RAN a day after completion.

&quot;Vampire&quot; was regularly deployed to South East Asia during her career: she was attached to the Far East Strategic Reserve on five occasions, including during the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation, and escorted the troop transport on six of the latter&#x27;s twenty-five transport voyages to South Vietnam. In 1977, the destroyer was assigned to escort the royal yacht during Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip&#x27;s visit to Australia. In 1980, &quot;Vampire&quot; was reclassified as a training ship. The warship remained in service until 1986, when she was decommissioned and presented to the Australian National Maritime Museum for preservation as a museum ship; the largest museum-owned object on display in Australia.

==Design==

The Royal Australian Navy initially ordered four s, which were to be named after the ships of the &quot;Scrap Iron Flotilla&quot; of World War II. The ships were modified during construction: most changes were made to improve habitability, including the installation of air-conditioning. &quot;Vampire&quot; and her sister ships were the first all-welded ships to be constructed in Australia.

The &quot;Daring&quot;s had a standard displacement of 2,800 tons, which increased to 3,600 tons at full load. &quot;Vendetta&quot; and her sisters were long, with a beam of , and a draught of at mean, and at full or deep load. Her propulsion system consisted of two Foster Wheeler boilers, feeding two English Electric geared turbines, which provided to two propeller shafts. &quot;Vampire&quot; could sail at over , and had a range of at . Her standard ship&#x27;s company consisted of 20 officers and 300 sailors.

===Armament===
&quot;Vampire&quot;″s main armament consisted of six Mark V guns mounted in three Mark 6 twin turrets, two forward and one aft. Her anti-aircraft outfit consisted of six 40 mm Bofors; two single mountings on the forward superstructure, and two twin mountings on the aft superstructure. Four .50 cal () Browning machine guns were carried for point defence. Five torpedo tubes were fitted to a single Mark IV pentad mount on the deck between the forward and aft superstructures. For anti-submarine warfare, a Limbo anti-submarine mortar was carried on the aft deck, offset to port. The twin Bofors, torpedo launcher, and Limbo mortar were all removed during various refits. A Sea Cat missile system was installed at some point during her career.
&quot;Vampire&quot; was fitted with a Type 170 attack sonar, a Type 174 search sonar, and a Type 185 submarine detection sonar. The original fire control directors were a Flyplane 3 and an MRS 8. These were replaced during the 1970–71 refit with two M22 units. The air warning radar was replaced with an LW-02 air search radar during the same refit, and an 8gr-301A surface search and navigation radar was installed.

==Construction==
&quot;Vampire&quot; was laid down at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, New South Wales on 1 July 1952. The destroyer was launched on 27 October 1956 by the wife of the Governor-General, Sir William Slim. She was completed on 22 June 1959, and commissioned into the RAN in Sydney a day later. Between laying down and completion, the ship&#x27;s cost increased from A£2.6 million to A£7 million.

==Operational history==
===1959–1970===
After competing work-up trials and entering active service, &quot;Vampire&quot; underwent training exercises with ships of the RAN and Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) until early 1960. &quot;Vampire&quot; was deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve in March 1960, and sailed to Singapore after a brief visit to New Zealand. She returned to Sydney in December, and was docked for refit until April 1961. The destroyer was awarded the Gloucester Cup for 1960, recognising her as the most efficient ship in the RAN. Following the refit, &quot;Vampire&quot; operated in Australian waters, including participation in the training exercise Tuckerbox in August, then returned to the Far East in September. On 1 December 1961, a chief petty officer died aboard from illness. The destroyer was in Hong Kong for Christmas, then in January 1962, visited Nha Trang and Saigon in South Vietnam with . &quot;Vampire&quot; received the Gloucester Cup again for 1961. the first months of 1962, the ship participated in training exercises in the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal, before returning to Australia on 7 April. &quot;Vampire&quot; participated in Exercise Tuckerbox II during August and September, and was present at Fremantle, Western Australia during November for the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Perth.

On 31 January 1963, &quot;Vampire&quot; departed for her third FESR deployment, which lasted until late July. During this, the destroyer participated in South East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) Exercise Sea Serpent. After returning to Sydney, &quot;Vampire&quot; was taken in hand by Garden Island Dockyard for refit, which concluded in February 1964. During the docking, the ship was awarded the Gloucester Cup for 1963; the third time the award was granted to the ship. After post-refit trials, &quot;Vampire&quot; sailed for her fourth Far East deployment in June, and was involved in Exercise Litgas shortly after reaching the region. From October until January 1965, the ship was involved in the Commonwealth response to the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation; carrying out patrols around the Malay Peninsula to interdict vessels smuggling troops into Malaysia. The destroyer remained in South East Asia until January 1965, and returned to Sydney on 12 February.

After a short period of leave and self-maintenance, &quot;Vampire&quot; sailed again for the Far East in April, exercising with the en route from Manus Island to Manila. &quot;Vampire&quot; escorted the aircraft carrier during SEATO Exercise Seahorse. During early June, &quot;Vampire&quot; accompanied the troop transport for parts of the latter&#x27;s first transport voyage to Vietnam. The ship&#x27;s fifth Far East deployment was concluded when she reached Sydney on 22 June. On 20 December, the ashes of Vice Admiral Sir Hastings Harrington were scattered from &quot;Vampire&quot; off the coast of Sydney.

&quot;Vampire&quot; was sent on her sixth Far East deployment in March 1966. In late April, &quot;Vampire&quot; was temporarily withdrawn from Strategic Reserve service to escort &quot;Sydney&quot; on her third Vietnam voyage: the destroyer returned to Hong Kong on 9 May. During late May and early June, &quot;Vampire&quot; participated in SEATO Exercise Sea Imp. On 10 June 1966, &quot;Vampire&quot; collided with the Danish merchant ship &quot;Emilie Maersk&quot; on the Chao Phraya River; the destroyer received only minor damage, and was repaired in Singapore. From July to August, the destroyer was assigned to Tawau to protect the region from Indonesian aggression during the Confrontation. This primarily consisted of using her radar to detect approaching vessels and coordinate interception efforts, although &quot;Vampire&quot; was called on to provide fire support for Commonwealth land forces on two occasions. The ship returned to Sydney on 13 August.

On 4 January 1967, &quot;Vampire&quot; sailed for her seventh FESR tour. The destroyer provided assistance to the grounded freighter &quot;Mata Thevi&quot; in February, and from April until May, accompanied &quot;Sydney&quot; on the latter&#x27;s fifth and sixth troop transport voyages. During the voyage back to Australia in late August and early September, &quot;Vampire&quot; made port visits in Indonesia; the first RAN ship to do so after the Confrontation&#x27;s end. On arrival in Sydney, the destroyer was docked for a six-month refit. In July 1968, &quot;Vampire&quot; and other vessels of the RAN were involved in training exercises with the Royal New Zealand Navy. The destroyer visited Indonesia again in September, then served as review ship during a ceremonial fleet entry into Sydney Harbour: for this role, several weapons, including one of the three 4.5-inch turrets, were temporarily removed.

On 23 March 1969, &quot;Vampire&quot; returned to the Far East. On 14 May 1969, the destroyer met &quot;Sydney&quot; off Singapore, and escorted the troopship to Vũng Tàu on the former aircraft carrier&#x27;s fourteenth Vietnam voyage. The destroyer returned to Australian waters in October. On 16 April 1970, &quot;Vampire&quot; joined a fleet of 45 naval ships from 13 nations to perform a ceremonial entry into Sydney Harbour as part of the first Australian Bicentenary, celebrating the discovery and claiming of the east coast of Australia by James Cook.

===Refit (1970–1972)===
In June 1970, &quot;Vampire&quot; was handed over to Williamstown Naval Dockyard for a $US10 million modernisation. The modernisation consisted of over 2,000 upgrades and modifications. The sensor suite, including fire control systems, air radar, and surface radar, was updated. The destroyer&#x27;s armament was refurbished, with the main gun turrets rebuilt and the Bofors reconditioned, although the torpedo pentad mount was removed. The superstructure was rebuilt, with the primary aim to enclose the open bridge area, along with modernisation of the ship&#x27;s galleys and installation of more air conditioning. Redesigned masts and funnel cowlings were fitted. &quot;Vampire&quot; reentered active service on 4 March 1972.

===1972–1986===
In October 1972, &quot;Vampire&quot; was deployed to Singapore for four months as part of the ANZUK force: the first &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyer assigned to the force. She was temporarily withdrawn in November to accompany &quot;Sydney&quot; on her twenty-fifth and final voyage to Vũng Tàu. &quot;Vampire&quot; returned to Sydney on 1 March 1973. In April, the destroyer sailed to Apia, Samoa for the South Pacific Forum. In September, the destroyer was part of a multinational training exercise off New Zealand, then returned to Sydney and was present for the opening of the Sydney Opera House on 20 October.

&quot;Vampire&quot; began 1974 by participating in a joint Australia-Indonesia military exercise, before sailing to the Coral Sea in June to participate in Exercise Kangaroo I. In September 1974, the ship entered Garden Island Dockyard for an eight-month refit.

On 22 August 1975, &quot;Vampire&quot;, sister ship , and the supply ship were prepositioned in Darwin following tensions between Indonesia and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor (which cumulated in the Indonesian invasion in December). The ships were to evacuate Australian citizens and Timorese refugees if needed, but this did not eventuate. On 21 September, the destroyer left Darwin for a five-month Strategic Reserve deployment. During her fifth deployment, which ended with her return to Sydney on 18 February 1976, &quot;Vampire&quot; joined training exercises with United States Navy ships in the China Sea, and visited sixteen ports in six countries for diplomatic and goodwill purposes. On 31 May 1976, &quot;Vampire&quot; and the destroyer escort departed Sydney Harbour for the United States. The two ships, along with the destroyer , visited ports along the west coast of the United States as the RAN representatives during the United States Bicentennial: &quot;Vampire&quot; visited Long Beach, California and Seattle, Washington. &quot;Vampire&quot; returned to Sydney on 6 August, but departed seven days later to participate in exercises in South East Asia.

During the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to Australia in March 1977, &quot;Vampire&quot; was assigned as the escort to . &quot;Vampire&quot; met &quot;Britannia&quot; on 11 March, and accompanied the royal yacht to Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Fremantle. Between April and July 1977, &quot;Vampire&quot; was involved in two rescue missions and three fleet training exercises. On 5 September, &quot;Vampire&quot; left Sydney as &quot;part of the RAN contribution to Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Silver Jubilee.&quot; The destroyer returned on 18 October. At the end of 1977, &quot;Vampire&quot; participated in Exercise Compass 77, held off Sri Lanka. The destroyer was primarily involved in training exercises during 1978 and 1979.

In April 1979, it was announced that &quot;Vampire&quot; would be converted into a training ship. This refit was carried out from 21 January to 18 April 1980, and included the removal of the destroyer&#x27;s M22 fire control radars, LW-02 air search radar, Limbo anti-submarine mortar, and twin Bofors mounts, and the installation of a training classroom where the Limbo previously resided. Following the conversion, &quot;Vampire&quot; was assigned to the RAN training squadron, where she joined . On 13 May, &quot;Vampire&quot; and &quot;Jervis Bay&quot; were ordered to the Solomon Islands to observe the splashdown of China&#x27;s first intercontinental ballistic missile test-firing. The ICBM landed north-west of Fiji, and was observed by both the two Australian ships and a fleet of 18 warships from the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy. On 6 November 1980, the two ships joined the patrol boats and to perform a ceremonial entry into Darwin as part of the city&#x27;s Navy Week.

==Decommissioning and preservation==
On 25 June 1986, &quot;Vampire&quot; left active service. She was decommissioned on 13 August 1986, having spent 27 years in service, and travelled . She was later presented to the Australian National Maritime Museum for preservation as a museum ship: on loan from 1990 to 1997, then transferred outright in 1997. &quot;Vampire&quot; is the largest museum piece on display in Australia. In 1991 &quot;Vampire&quot; appeared in the children&#x27;s television program The Girl From Tomorrow Part II: Tomorrow&#x27;s End. The ship is also used for training RAN divers in hull clearance. In 1994, two disabled twin Bofors mounts were returned to the destroyer, replacing those removed in 1980. On 9 April 1997, permission was granted for &quot;Vampire&quot; to fly the Australian White Ensign, despite not being a commissioned warship.

The destroyer is towed to every five years for maintenance and cleaning. During a docking in October 2006, rumours spread among RAN personnel that &quot;Vampire&quot; would be refitted and returned to active service. During the same refit, a fire broke out in the ship&#x27;s boiler room. Nobody was injured, and no irreparable damage was caused.

An overhaul of the RAN battle honours system completed in March 2009 saw &quot;Vampire&quot; retroactively honoured for her service in the Strategic Reserve between 1964 and 1966—the time of the Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation. Any future ships named HMAS &quot;Vampire&quot; will carry the battle honour &quot;Malaysia 1964–66&quot; in addition to the honours earned by the previous HMAS &quot;Vampire&quot;.

In November 2015, the warship was moved to the new Warships Pavilion &#x27;Action Stations&#x27; at the Australian National Maritime Museum alongside and .

In January 2023, &quot;Vampire&quot; moved to Cockatoo Island Dockyard to begin repairs to its hull and various other components, costing about $3M.

As of April 2023, &quot;Vampire&quot;&#x27;s radio room hosts an active Amateur Radio station, operated by a group of local Amateurs. The station operates under the radio call sign VK2VMP.
