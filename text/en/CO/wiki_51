<text>HMAS &quot;Vampire&quot; was a V-class destroyer of the Royal Navy (RN) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN). Launched in 1917 as HMS &quot;Wallace&quot;, the ship was renamed and commissioned into the RN later that year. &quot;Vampire&quot; was lent to the RAN in 1933, and operated as a depot tender until just before World War II. Reactivated for war service, the destroyer served in the Mediterranean as part of the Scrap Iron Flotilla, and was escorting the British warships and during their loss to Japanese aircraft in the South China Sea in December 1941. &quot;Vampire&quot; was sunk on 9 April 1942 by Japanese aircraft while sailing with the aircraft carrier from Trincomalee.

==Construction==
The destroyer was one of five Admiralty V-class flotilla leaders ordered by the RN in the 1916–17 construction program. Originally, there were to be differences in design between the V class leaders and the rest of the V-class destroyers, but in order to save time in designing the destroyers, changes were limited to the layout of the bridge and accommodation areas.

&quot;Vampire&quot; had a standard displacement of 1,188 tons, and a deep load displacement of 1,489 tons. She was in length overall and long between perpendiculars, with a beam of , and a maximum draught of . Propulsion machinery consisted of three White Forster boilers supplying two Brown-Curtis steam turbines, which provided to the destroyer&#x27;s two propellers. Maximum speed was , and &quot;Vampire&quot; could sail at . The standard ship&#x27;s company was made up of 6 officers and 113 sailors.

Main armament for a V-class destroyer consisted of four QF Mark V guns. This was supplemented by a QF 2-pounder gun (with a second installed in January 1942), two twin Lewis gun mountings, a single Lewis gun (later replaced by a 4-barrel Vickers .303 gun), and two torpedo tube sets (initially 3-tube, later replaced by 4-tube sets). Four depth charge chutes were fitted during construction, with two depth charge throwers installed later; the destroyer could carry up to 50 charges.

The ship was laid down as HMS &quot;Wallace&quot; by J. Samuel White &amp; Co Ltd at Cowes on the Isle of Wight on 10 October 1916, and was launched on 21 May 1917. In July 1917, the ship was renamed &quot;Vampire&quot;, and was commissioned into the RN on 22 September 1917.

==Operational history==

===RN service===
On entering service, &quot;Vampire&quot; was initially assigned to the 4th Destroyer Flotilla. After the end of World War I, the destroyer saw service in British waters and the Mediterranean.

===Transfer to RAN===
In 1933, it was decided to replace the five S-class destroyers (HMA Ships , , , , and ) and the flotilla leader () on loan to the RAN with newer ships. &quot;Vampire&quot;, along with three sister ships (the V-class destroyer and the W-class destroyers and ) and the were selected by the Admiralty for loan to Australia as a flotilla.

The five vessels were paid off from RN service at Portsmouth, England on 11 October 1933, and were commissioned into the RAN on the same day. Less than a week later, the ships left for Australia, arriving in Sydney on 21 December. &quot;Vampire&quot; was paid off into reserve on 31 January 1934, but was recommissioned for three days in mid-July to be sailed down to Flinders Naval Depot for use as a tender. The destroyer remained in &quot;reserve commission&quot; until 11 May 1938, when she was recommissioned for full service.

===World War II – Mediterranean===
&quot;Vampire&quot; operated in Australian waters until the start of World War II, and on 14 October 1939, joined her sister ships and &quot;Stuart&quot; (a force that Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels called &quot;Scrap Iron Flotilla&quot;, a moniker the ships quickly adopted) as they were deployed to the Mediterranean Theatre. From her arrival until April 1940, &quot;Vampire&quot; was primarily assigned to convoy escort duties between Malta and Marseilles. The destroyer operated as an escort and anti-submarine patrol ship from the end of April, and escorted the British aircraft carrier during the Battle of Calabria on 9 July. The only damage sustained by &quot;Vampire&quot; was the result of near misses and splinters caused by Italian aircraft bombing &quot;Eagle&quot;: an RN torpedo gunner aboard the destroyer became the first fatality of the war aboard a RAN ship when he died three days later from splinter wounds.
After repairs in Alexandria, &quot;Vampire&quot; resumed escort and patrol duties, and on several occasions was unsuccessfully used in attempts to lure the Italian fleet to where they could be engaged by the Allies. In late October and early November, the early phases of the Battle of Greece, the destroyer escorted convoys in Greek waters, before being deployed to aid the Western Desert Campaign as an escort. On 20 December, &quot;Vampire&quot; stripped her engines, forcing the destroyer to dock for repairs. These were completed on 8 January 1941.

&quot;Vampire&quot; was sent back to Greece, where she operated until May, aiding in the Allied reinforcement (Operation Lustre) and evacuation (Operation Demon). She was then deployed back to the Western Desert Campaign, operating as part of the &quot;Tobruk Ferry Service&quot;; ships transporting supplies and reinforcements to the Allied-controlled, besieged town of Tobruk. However, after two trips, the destroyer had to be removed from service because further engine problems were causing the ship to vibrate excessively at speeds over .

The ship sailed to Singapore for major repairs, which lasted until late 1941. In September, Commander William Moran was appointed captain of &quot;Vampire&quot;.

===World War II – British Eastern Fleet===

In December 1941, she joined to the British Eastern Fleet at Colombo, Ceylon. In the first week of December, the battlecruiser started on a trip to Australia with &quot;Vampire&quot; and as escorts, but the force was recalled. Early in the morning of 8 December (Singapore time), Singapore came under attack by Japanese aircraft. &quot;Repulse&quot; and the British battleship , which were in the harbor at the time, shot back with anti-aircraft fire; no planes were shot down, and the ships sustained no damage. After receiving the reports of the attack on Pearl Harbor and invasions of Siam by the Japanese, Force Z (consisting of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;, escorted by &quot;Vampire&quot;, , , and &quot;Tenedos&quot;) put to sea at 17:30 hours on 8 December.

At 20:55 hours, Admiral Philips cancelled the operation, and ordered the force to return to Singapore. On the way back, they were spotted and reported by . The next morning, 10 December, they received a report of Japanese landings at Kuantan, and &quot;Express&quot; was sent to investigate the area, finding nothing. That afternoon, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were attacked and sunk by 85 Japanese aircraft off Kuantan by aircraft from the 22nd Air Flotilla based at Saigon. &quot;Vampire&quot; rescued 225 of the ships&#x27; 2,081 survivors from the sea, and transported them to Singapore.

On 26 January 1942, following reports that an unescorted group of Japanese troopships was sailing near Endau, Malaya, &quot;Vampire&quot; and were ordered to intercept. Reaching the Japanese convoy at 02:00 the next morning, the two destroyers found the troopships were protected by the cruiser and six destroyers. The allied destroyers attempted to escape: &quot;Vampire&quot; was successful, but &quot;Thanet&quot; was sunk.

On 11 February, &quot;Vampire&quot; was attached to Eastern Fleet forces operating in the Indian Ocean. At the start of April, &quot;Vampire&quot; was ordered to escort the British aircraft carrier from Ceylon, as the Japanese presence in the area was likely to become dominant.

==Loss==

Following the Japanese Fast Carrier Task Force&#x27;s attack on Colombo in early April, &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Vampire&quot; were ordered to depart Trincomalee to avoid a follow-up strike. Sailing on 8 April, the two ships avoided the aerial bombing of the port early the next morning, but were spotted and attacked by 85 Japanese Aichi D3A Val dive bombers escorted by 9 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter carrier aircraft at 10:35.

&quot;Hermes&quot; was attacked by 45 bombers and sustained 40 hits or very near misses and was lost within twenty minutes. &quot;Vampire&quot; came under attack by 16 Vals and claimed to have shot down at least one aircraft but was hit or near missed by all sixteen 250 kg bombs, breaking in half and sinking 10 minutes after &quot;Hermes&quot;, her ensign the last to submerge. Despite the ferocity of the attack, &quot;Vampire&quot;″s commanding officer and eight sailors were the only fatalities. The survivors from both &quot;Hermes&quot; and &quot;Vampire&quot; were recovered by the hospital ship &quot;Vita&quot;.

&quot;Vampire&quot; was awarded five battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Calabria 1940&quot;, &quot;Libya 1940–41&quot;, &quot;Greece 1941&quot;, &quot;Crete 1941&quot;, and &quot;Indian Ocean 1941–42&quot;.

<doc id="1286567" wikidata="Q1173381" url="?curid=1286567" title="Dave Watson">
<text>David Watson (born 20 November 1961) is an English football manager and former professional player.

As a player, he was a centre-back from 1980 to 2001. He played his entire career for Norwich City and Everton. With the Toffees he played in the Premier League and was part of their victorious FA Cup winning team of 1995. He was capped 12 appearances for the England national team.

In 1997, Watson had a spell in caretaker charge of Everton although he would not retire for another four years, in which he moved into coaching and was appointed first team manager at Tranmere Rovers for the 2001–2002 season. He later spent time coaching in Wigan Athletic&#x27;s youth academy before taking up a similar role with Newcastle United.

==Club career==
===Norwich City===
Watson played for the Liverpool reserves before joining Norwich City for £50,000 on 29 November 1980. He made his league debut in the local derby against Ipswich Town on Boxing Day that year. He played 18 league games in the 1980–81 First Division campaign and scored three goals, but was unable to prevent the Canaries from sliding into the Second Division.

Over the next five years, Watson was rarely absent from the Norwich side and helped them win promotion from the Second Division in the 1981–82 season. He eventually made 256 appearances for Norwich, and as club captain lifted the League Cup in 1985. They were demoted to the Second Division that year, but won promotion the following year as champions.

===Everton===
Watson moved on to play for Everton for £900,000 on 22 August 1986 after six years at Norwich. He remained at Goodison Park for 15 years, his first game for them coming on 23 August 1986 when they won 2–0 at home to Nottingham Forest on the opening day of the league season. He helped them win the league title in their first season, and also helped them reach the FA Cup final in 1989, where they lost 3–2 to local rivals Liverpool in extra time.

Watson was an integral part of the Everton side throughout the 1990s, and following the departure of goalkeeper Neville Southall in 1998 he became the club&#x27;s oldest and longest serving player. However, the 1990s were a generally unsuccessful decade for Everton after the glories of the 1980s. They did finish sixth in 1990 after topping the table earlier in 1990–91, but then endured four seasons of mid table finishes, and avoided relegation in 1994 on the last day of the season. Watson got his hands on some silverware for one final time in 1995 when he captained Everton to a surprise 1–0 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup final – by now he was one of the last players remaining from Everton&#x27;s last major trophy win (the league title) eight years earlier. He was man of the match for that game.

Watson captained Everton to sixth place in 1996, but the following season they were struggling again and manager Joe Royle resigned in March 1997, with Watson taking over as manager for the final few weeks of the season and overseeing Everton&#x27;s Premier League survival as they finished 15th. Howard Kendall then took over as manager for the third time, though his return to Goodison Park lasted just one season before he was replaced by Walter Smith.

Even at the age of 37, Watson was a regular in the Everton side as captain, playing 22 times in the 1998–99 season though by 1999–2000 it was obvious that he was nearing the end of his playing career as he played just seven times all season, before calling time on 15 years at Everton and becoming manager of Tranmere Rovers on 4 May 2001. His final game for Everton was a 2–2 draw with Tottenham Hotspur on 15 January 2000.

==International career==
Watson was capped 12 times at senior level for England. His first cap came on 10 June 1984 in a 2–0 friendly win over Brazil. By the time of his transfer from Norwich to Everton two years later, he had been capped six times for England. He won a further six England caps, bringing his tally to 12 by the time he made his final England appearance on 18 June 1988 in England&#x27;s 3–1 European Championship defeat by the Soviet Union in 1988.

==Coaching and management career==
Watson was appointed Everton manager in March 1997 for the remainder of the 1996–97 season following the resignation of Joe Royle, but reverted to his playing duties in June 1997 when Howard Kendall was appointed manager for the third and final time. Watson&#x27;s first-team opportunities gradually faded, but he made one appearance for Everton during the 2000–01 season, before finally announcing his retirement as a player at the age of 39, and moving into management with Tranmere Rovers. His key objective at Tranmere was to regain their Division One status which had just been lost, but he failed to achieve that goal and was sacked after just one season at the helm. He later became a scout for Birmingham City before joining Wigan Athletic as their youth-team coach on 23 April 2008.

In 2002, Watson was voted into the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame. Watson was appointed as Under 18 Coach at Newcastle United on 7 November 2011.

On 28 January 2015, Watson was brought into John Carver&#x27;s backroom team at Newcastle United for the remaining 16 games of the 2014–15 season.

<text>Lampang, also called Nakhon Lampang (, ) to differentiate from Lampang province, is the third largest city in northern Thailand and capital of Lampang province and the Mueang Lampang district. Traditional names for Lampang include Wiang Lakon and Khelang Nakhon. The city is a trading and transportation center. Lampang lies north of Bangkok and southeast of Chiang Mai.
==Geography==

Lampang city is in the valley of the Wang River, bordered by the Khun Tan Range on the west and the Phi Pan Nam Range on the east. The river, a major tributary of the Chao Phraya, flows through the city. The city lies mainly on the south side of Wang River, although the old parts of the city had been originally developed in the north side of it. Nowadays, downtown Lampang has grown in the southeast of the river along Bunyawat and Pahon Yothin Roads.

==History==
Lampang was a major city in the Lanna kingdom. However, its historical prominence is largely overshadowed by Chiang Mai or Chiang Rai which were the traditional seats of government, and whose histories were well recorded in chronicles. Following decades of warfare with both the Ava Burmese and Ayudhya during the 17th-18th century, the region was in decline, severely depopulated, and subject to Burmese control.

In the late 18th century, the famed marksman and Lampang native Nan Thipchang assassinated the local Burmese leader in Wat Phra That Lampang Luang, and led an uprising which led to a rollback of Burmese rule over Lanna. Allied with Bangkok, the descendants of Nan Thipchang, known as Chao Ched Ton (the seven princes), became the vassal rulers of the various Lanna cities until the annexation of Lanna into Siam (Thailand) proper under King Chulalongkorn (Rama V).

=== Modern history ===
During the late 1800s and early 1900s, the region experienced a growth in teak logging. Lampang later became home to Louis Leonowens, who operated teak plantations around Lampang. During the Ngiao Rebellion, Lampang was attacked by 200 Shan rebels led by Phaka Mong on 3 August 1902. Prior to this, the ruler of Lampang assembled a force of 1,000 and Leonowens had organized defences around the town. They were also reinforced by 54 policemen from Chaing Mai led by Danish captain Hans Markvard Jensen. The following battle resulted in the defeat of the Shans, however Chao Bunwatwongse, Lampang&#x27;s ruler, was evacuated to Chiang Mai over fears of another attack but returned to Lampang on August 7.

In 1894, the Ratsadaphisek Bridge across the Wang river was opened and became the longest bridge in Thailand at the time. However, the flow of logs down the Wang caused damage to the bridge until the current version was completed in 1917. On 1 April 1916, the first train arrived at Nakhon Lampang Railway Station, which was then the northernmost train station in Thailand.

==== World War II ====
During World War II, Lampang became an important location for Japanese operations as the main Japanese headquarters in Thailand, as well as the target of Allied bombings. In 1942, a squadron of P-40 Tomahawks belonging to the American Flying Tigers were supposed to bomb Lampang, but mistook Lamphun for Lampang and returned back after seeing no troop movements in Lamphun. The Allied forces also attempted to bomb the Ratsadaphisek Bridge to disrupt Japanese operations.

==Climate==

Lampang has a relatively dry climate relative to nearby provinces. &quot;Winter&quot; starts after the last rains, typically November, and lasts until March. Cold air masses from Siberia sometimes lead to nighttime temperatures below , although that is quite rare. Winter is characterized by dry, sunny, and quite pleasant days, and cool and occasionally foggy nights. In recent times, the blue winter sky is often marred by the practice of burning the fields after the harvest, as well as the smog generated by Mae Mo coal-fired power plants.

Summer typically runs from March until June. The temperature could soar to in April. Late afternoon thunderstorms and hailstorms are frequent.

Rainy season runs from June until November, and significant rain may occur in May as well. Being in a relative rain shadow, Lampang receives less precipitation than neighboring provinces and rarely suffers from the flooding which has plagued Chiang Mai in recent years.

==Economy==
Besides the traditional rice paddy farming, pineapple, and sugarcane constitute major food crops in Lampang Province. The province has a large deposit of lignite in Mae Moh district, fuelling several coal-fired electricity generating plants, whose pollution has severely affected the local populations. Lampang also has a large deposit of kaolin which is widely utilized in the ceramics industry. Historically, logging was an important industry, since Lampang, together with nearby Phrae had a large stand of teak. Many elephants were employed to transport the logs to the river for transport to Bangkok, hence the founding of an &quot;elephant school&quot;, the predecessor of the Thai Elephant Conservation Center. Much of the old growth teak stands in Lampang had been thoroughly harvested.

==Culture==
Lampang, also called &quot;mueang rot ma&quot; in Thai, meaning &quot;horse carriage city&quot;, is considered by some Thais as the last paradise in Thailand. It is about to the southeast of Chiang Mai. Although well-connected by rail, and four lane highways to both Bangkok and Chiang Mai, it is here that tourists can still find horse-drawn carriages in regular use for transportation. One account attributes the horse-drawn carriage to the Portuguese, via Macau, although a more likely origin is colonial Burma. Lampang was an important center of the timber industry in the early-20th century and saw an influx of migrants from British-controlled Burma. The horse-drawn carriage is one of the most memorable symbols of Lampang, as reflected in many traditional products.

Lampang has a few institutions of higher learning, such as Yonok College, and a branch of Thammasat University.

== Health ==
The main hospital of Lampang is Lampang Hospital, operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Transportation==
The city is an important highway hub, with a four lane highway link to Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, as well as a major highway to Phrae and the eastern Lanna provinces. Lampang is roughly a 1.5 hour bus ride to Chiang Mai. Nakhon Lampang railway station is a stop for the Chiang Mai-bound train, approximately 10 hours from Bangkok.

Lampang Airport is served by Bangkok Airways (three flights daily to Suvarnabhumi Airport) and Nok air (four flights daily to Don Mueang) (Oct 2015).

==Landmarks and tourist attractions==
Tourists typically stop by for lunch and visit the more famous attractions such as Wat Phra That Lampang Luang and the Thai Elephant Conservation Center and then proceed to points further north such as Chiang Mai or Chiang Rai. Less well-known tourist attractions in Lampang are thus mostly visited by locals. Among these are the Wang Kaeo Waterfall and the Chae Son National Park, a compact park which combines a natural hot spring with large waterfalls.

Many temples in downtown Lampang were built in the Burmese -style, originally endowed by the logging tycoons of the late-19th century. Wat Si Bun Rueang, Wat Si Chum and Wat Pa Fang are among the extant examples. Nine of the 31 remaining Burmese-style temples in Thailand are in Lampang. Traditional Lanna architecture can be found at Wat Phra That Lampang Luang, on the site of ancient Lampang city. It is famous for its murals from the 19th century. The city seal features a white rooster in the temple&#x27;s gate.

Wat Phra Kaeo Don Tao, on the west bank of the Wang River, is said to have housed the Emerald Buddha between 1436 and 1468. Wat Phra That Chedi Sao (The Temple of Twenty Chedis) is famous for its array of twenty pagodas. Other temples of some renown include Wat Phra That Chom Ping and Wat Lai Hin both in the Ko Kha District.

Mae Mo mine is a vast open pit lignite mine in the Mae Mo basin. The mine and the adjoining power generation facilities are operated by EGAT. The power plant is a major source of electric power for Thailand.

Lampang is known for its horse-drawn carriages, which were introduced in 1916 and remain popular with tourists.

==Education==
Lampang has a number of educational institutions, including kindergartens, primary, secondary and vocational schools. Schools teach in the English, Thai, and Chinese languages. Lampang also has a number of universities: Lampang Rajabhat University, Rajmangala University of Technology, Nation University (formerly Yonok) and a satellite campus of Thammasat University. Lampang College of Commerce and Technology (LCCT) and Lampang International Technical College (LIT) are well known schools which teach technology.

<text>Satish Dhawan (25 September 1920 – 3 January 2002) was an Indian mathematician and aerospace engineer, widely regarded as the father of experimental fluid dynamics research in India. He served as the chairman of Indian Space Research Organisation from 1972 to 1984. Born in Srinagar, Dhawan was educated in India and further on in United States. Dhawan was one of the most eminent researchers in the field of turbulence and boundary layers, leading the successful and indigenous development of the Indian space programme.The second launch pad of ISRO, Satish Dhawan space centre is named after him. He is greatly regarded as the man behind A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.

== Early life ==
Satish Dhawan was born in a Punjabi Hindu family. He was the son of Rai Bahadur Devi Dayal Dhawan, an MSc and LLB who joined the Punjab Civil Service and later became a sessions and district judge.

== Education ==
Dhawan was a graduate of what is now called Punjab Engineering College in the city of Chandigarh in India, the Mughalpura Technical College in Lahore, Pakistan, undivided India, where he completed a Bachelor of Science in physics and mathematics, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Mechanical Engineering and a Master of Arts in English literature. In 1947, he completed a Master of Science degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, and an aeronautical engineering degree from the California Institute of Technology followed by a double PhD in mathematics and aerospace engineering under the supervision of his advisor Hans W. Liepmann in 1951.

== Leadership in space research ==

In 1972, Dhawan became chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and secretary to the Government of India at the Department of Space.

APJ Abdul Kalam explained that in 1979 when he was the director of a Satellite Launch Vehicle, the mission failed to launch the satellite in the orbit. Instead, it was put into Bay of Bengal. Abdul Kalam&#x27;s team knew that there was a leakage in the fuel of the system, but they hoped that the leakage was negligible, and thus they thought there was enough fuel in the system. This miscalculation led to the mission&#x27;s failure. Satish Dhawan, being the chairman at the time, called Abdul Kalam and conveyed to the press; &quot;We failed! But I have very strong trust in my team and I believe that next time we will definitely succeed&quot;. This surprised Abdul Kalam, as the blame of the failure was taken by the chairman of ISRO. The next mission was prepared and launched successfully in 1980. When this succeeded, Satish Dhawan told Abdul Kalam to attend the press meet without his presence. It was observed that when the team failed, he took the blame. But when the team succeeded, he attributed the success to his team, thus portraying the picture of an ideal leader.

Satish Dhawan was chairman of ISRO until 1984.

== Director, IISc (1962–1981) ==
Dhawan joined as faculty at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, in 1951 and became its director in 1962. Although he was the head of the Indian space programme, he devoted substantial efforts towards boundary layer research. His most important contributions are presented in the seminal book &quot;Boundary Layer Theory&quot; by Hermann Schlichting. He set up the country&#x27;s first supersonic wind tunnel at IISc. He also pioneered research on relaminarization of separated boundary layer flows, three-dimensional boundary layers and trisonic flows.

== Support of space research ==
Dhawan carried out pioneering experiments in rural education, remote sensing and satellite communications. His efforts led to operational systems like INSAT, a telecommunications satellite; IRS, the Indian Remote Sensing satellite; and the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), that placed India in the league of space faring nations.

== Honours ==
Dhawan died on 3 January 2002 in Bangalore. In honor of his contributions, the satellite launch center in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, was renamed the Satish Dhawan Space Centre following his death. Satish Chander Dhawan Government College For Boys in Ludhiana is named after him.The Department of Mechanical Engineering Building at the Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar is also named in his honor as the Satish Dhawan Block. In 2019, the Uttar Pradesh Textile Technology Institute in Kanpur named its computer center the Prof. Satish Dhawan Computer Centre.

<text>Kaleidoscope Century is a science fiction novel by John Barnes. First published in 1995, it is part of the author&#x27;s &quot;Century Next Door&quot; series.

==Plot summary==

The narrator Joshua—at first appearing to be just over 60 years old, wakes up May 27, 2109 in an apartment on human-settled Mars. With no memory of his past, he goes to his &quot;werp&quot;, a voice-activated laptop computer, and learns that his name is Joshua Ali Quare and that he was born in 1968. From this frame story and a box containing several objects from his past, Quare pieces together what he believes is true about his life leading to the early 22nd century. It is soon clear that he is unburdened by any form of morality.

Joshua ran away from home early in his teens to escape his abusive father, and stayed in an upstairs apartment at Gwenny&#x27;s Diner. Joshua&#x27;s mother, a Communist party member, surreptitiously helped him. He entered the US Army at the behest of some Party organizers, and he was put in contact with a KGB operative who provided him with an injection to keep him from receiving or transmitting AIDS (which mutates into mutAIDS and spreads soon after, wiping out a large percentage of the population of Earth). The injection also enhanced his memory, and periodically regenerates his body, so that he becomes 10 years younger with each 15-year life period. This makes him a &quot;longtimer&quot;, and gives him the side-effect of having his memory wiped after every life period.

Joshua&#x27;s US Army career is spent in Operation Desert Storm (the &quot;First Oil War&quot; in the novel) and the &quot;Second Oil War&quot; which culminated in a march on Tehran. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the KGB diversified and became &quot;the Organization,&quot; a counter-insurgency group that supplied technical and logistic support to every side in the Eurowar, a NATO-Central European Union-Russian conflict in the early 21st century. Among the innovations of the Eurowar were &quot;Simulation Modeling Optimizing Targeters&quot; (SMOTs) a jump from smart weapons to &quot;brilliant weapons&quot; that attacked an enemy country&#x27;s natural resources and means of production. These weapons cause massive environmental damage to the earth, and are the predecessors of the &quot;memes&quot;. Joshua, as an agent for The Organization, begins his violent operative career with a gang rape involving US soldiers, and then sets out a series of terrorist-like missions to intensify the war. During the Eurowar, Joshua raped a woman and killed her and her family (perhaps the only disturbing memory he regrets), murdered many soldiers and civilians, suppressed science and research through rape and torture, and essentially caused mayhem along with other Organization &quot;longtimers&quot;, for great sums of pay. After the Eurowar ended, Joshua took in &quot;Alice&quot;, a war orphan from Prague in an incident where he got the dog tag – and inspiration for future alias – &quot;John Childs&quot;.

In the 2010s, the Organization abandoned Joshua, who then joined the &quot;Reconstruction&quot; after the Eurowar and worked in Quito, Ecuador on the GeoSync Cable and saw with Alice the beginning of the development of memes that would unify all countries and religions, leading to the War of the Memes (referred to in some of Barnes&#x27; other books) that culminated in the takeover of Earth by &quot;One True&quot;. Alice runs away, and the Organization finds and rehires Joshua to fight in the War of the Memes, for One True. By the time One True consolidated its hold on the people of Earth, Mars, the Jupiter and Saturn systems had been colonized for decades. Joshua steals another person&#x27;s ID and becomes an ecoprospector on Mars.

The best scientists and engineers of free humanity had developed the technology to unleash a singularity at the edge of the Solar System that would provide a return point in time and space for the descendants of five transfer ships sent to colonize other nearby star systems. When Joshua finally ventures forth to meet his Organization contact in Red Sands City, he&#x27;s confronted by a tremendous hustle and bustle of people preparing for the transfer ship descendants to arrive from the 25th century and either destroy One True (and the population on Earth under its control) or confine it there.

A fellow Organization agent named Sadi has been in Joshua&#x27;s life one way or another since the inception of the Organization. On Mars, Sadi, who&#x27;s also a longtimer, meets Joshua as a woman, Sadi&#x27;s original gender, and now gender of choice. This is possible due to the Organization perfecting the regeneration process, now called &#x27;revival&#x27;, which also gave Sadi complete memory recovery and a permanent 20-year-old body. From Sadi, whom Joshua had met &quot;as&quot; a woman after the Eurowar and was partnered with when Sadi was male during the War of the Memes, Joshua learns that it&#x27;s possible to go through the singularity to 1988, when the technology to construct it was first built and put into orbit by the Soviets. By the time of the novel&#x27;s frame story, Sadi has done this thirty times, each time changing history to his/her benefit. After Joshua&#x27;s revival and a time as Sadi&#x27;s lover, Joshua, who&#x27;s repeatedly refused to accompany Sadi on these excursions through the singularity, (also known as a &quot;closed timelike curve&quot;), is sent by her via force on a preset course through the singularity once more. Sadi claims to have brought Joshua back in time with her before, without being revived, so she could &#x27;help&#x27; Joshua love her as obsessively as Sadi loves him. Now she wants him to experience the freedom she&#x27;s had, in hopes of having him come back to her for good. Joshua makes plans when he comes back to the late 20th century to change history himself, many times over, alone.

==Critical reaction==
Writer Jo Walton declared: &quot;Kaleidoscope Century is one of the most unpleasant books I’ve ever read, I can hardly believe I’ve read it again. All the same it&#x27;s a major work and very nearly a masterpiece... This is the most unsuitable book for children in the history of the universe... But despite making no sense, rape, murder, and a very unpleasant future, it&#x27;s still an excellently written and vastly ambitious book, with a scope both science fictional and literary. That&#x27;s what ultimately makes it a good book, though I do not like it.&quot;

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote: &quot;Grim, sinewy, consistently surprising, and—despite Barnes&#x27;s habitual, and always irksome, present-tense narration— unforgettable.&quot; &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; stated: &quot;Whether or not one is put off by the pervasive cynical mentality, as a picture of the degradation of society in the 22nd century, the novel is gripping.&quot; Chris Gilmore of &quot;Interzone&quot; opined that &quot;it&#x27;s as a study in evil that this book must stand or fall, and as such it falls victim to its own singleminded superficiality.&quot;

<text>Madona (; ) is a town with town rights in the Vidzeme region of Latvia and is the center of the Madona municipality.


==History==
The surrounding area of Madona had been populated in earlier times, which is confirmed by discoveries of old burial grounds in the city&#x27;s vicinity. Madona is first mentioned in writing in 1461, when Archbishop Sylvester began renting the lands of Birži Manor. However, the Swedish government placed the land under state control. After the Great Northern War, Madona became property of the Russian Empire. Empress Elizabeth presented Birži Manor along with other of Vidzeme&#x27;s manors to Count Alexander Buturlin.

Empress Catherine II bought the lands back as a present to the Serbian-born General Maxim Zorić. From the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century, the location of Madona was the fields of Birži Manor.

According to one version, the name of Madona stems from the adjacent Madona Lake. According to another version, Madona got its name from Birži Manor, which German exonym is &quot;Madohn&quot; or &quot;Modohn&quot;. For this reason, the railway station situated at the Pļaviņas - Valka narrow gauge railway line was named Madona as well. The populated place that slowly emerged around the station also got this name after the erection of the Madona railway station in 1903.

Village privileges was given to Madona 1 July 1921, and town privileges 7 June 1926. Since 1 April 1925 Madona was the center of the newly founded County of Madona (Madonas apriņķis). Madona had 1,357 inhabitants at the time.

During World War II, Madona was under German occupation from 2 July 1941 until 13 August 1944. It was administered as a part of the Generalbezirk Lettland of Reichskommissariat Ostland.

==Population==
The Latvian Central Statistics Department reported 9,242 citizens as of 1 January 2007, with s).
When it comes to age distribution of the Madona inhabitants, the majority group consisting of 5,925 people are registered as &quot;labour-capable&quot; (); 1,339 are under the age of &quot;labour-capability&quot; and 1867 are over. As of 21 December 2003, there were 211 (3.5%) unemployed citizens of the labour force.

==Geography==
The town of Madona lies in Vidzeme Upland. The hilly surroundings descend in a northwestern-southeastern direction. Several minor rivers and streams flows through the town, such as: Lisa River, Leivārīte, Ridzīte, Mucenieki River, Rieba River and Madona River — which flows can be seen in beautiful glens, like: &quot;The Love Glen&quot;, &quot;The Wedding Glen&quot; and &quot;The Divorce Glen&quot;. In &quot;The Love Glen&quot; is a park, in which the manmade water reservoir has one of the highest fountains in Latvia.

===Climate===
Madona has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;).
==Notable locations and objects==
* Madona City Museum — founded in 1944, the museum owns more than 107,000 historical items, it is located in historical Birži Manor.

<text>Futurists (also known as futurologists, prospectivists, [[Foresight (futures studies)|foresight]] practitioners and horizon scanners) are people whose specialty or interest is futurology or the attempt to systematically explore predictions and possibilities about the future and how they can emerge from the present, whether that of human society in particular or of life on Earth in general.

== Definition ==

=== Past futurists and the emergence of the term ===

The term &quot;futurist&quot; most commonly refers to people who attempt to understand the future, sometimes called trend analysis. Futurists include authors, consultants, thinkers, organizational leaders and others who engage in interdisciplinary and systems thinking to advise private and public organizations on such matters as diverse global fads and trends, possible scenarios, emerging market opportunities, as well as risk management. A futurist is not an artist in the sense of the art movement futurism.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; identifies the earliest use of the term &quot;futurism&quot; in English as 1842, to refer, in a theological context, to the Christian eschatological tendency of that time. The next recorded use is the label adopted by the Italian and Russian Futurists, the artistic, literary and political movements of the 1920s and 1930s which sought to reject the past and fervently embrace speed, technology, and often violent change.

There are a number of organizations that specialize in this field including the World Future Society, the Association of Professional Futurists (APF) and the World Futures Studies Federation (WFSF).

Visionary writers such as H.G. Wells, Jules Verne and Aldous Huxley were not in their day characterized as futurists. The term futurology in its contemporary sense was first coined in the mid‑1940s by the German Professor Ossip K. Flechtheim, who proposed a new science of probability. Flechtheim argued that even if systematic forecasting did no more than unveil the subset of statistically highly probable processes of change and charted their advance, it would still be of crucial social value.

In the mid‑1940s the first professional &quot;futurist&quot; consulting institutions like RAND and SRI began to engage in long-range planning, systematic trend watching, scenario development, and visioning, at first under World War II military and government contract and, beginning in the 1950s, for private institutions and corporations. The period from the late 1940s to the mid‑1960s laid the conceptual and methodological foundations of the modern futurology field. Bertrand de Jouvenel&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Conjecture&quot; in 1963 and Dennis Gabor&#x27;s &quot;Inventing the Future&quot; in 1964 are considered key early works, and the first U.S. university course devoted entirely to the future was taught by the late Alvin Toffler at the New School in 1966.

== Modern futurists ==
Economists have defined the forecasting time range, so an explanation can be offered for predicting when an economic event will occur. Economists are in particular concerned about calculating when a recession or economic growth will set in. Futurist writers may not be precise about timing. However, futurists tend to engage in deep analysis about the speed of change. Economic forecasting for 5 to 20 years going forward is the middle-range future. 20 to 50 years from now is the long-range future in economic analysis. Futurists are frequently concerned with the middle- and long-range future, while economic planners working for the public or private sector typically publish on the middle-range future as well as the near-range future, which is 1 to 5 years going forward from the time of publication. 
More generally, the label includes such disparate lay, professional, and academic groups as visionaries, foresight consultants, corporate strategists, policy analysts, cultural critics, planners, marketers, forecasters, prediction market developers, roadmappers, operations researchers, investment managers, actuaries, and other risk analyzers, and future-oriented individuals educated in every academic discipline, including anthropology, complexity studies, computer science, economics, engineering, urban design, evolutionary biology, history, management, mathematics, philosophy, physical sciences, political science, psychology, sociology, systems theory, technology studies, trend analysis, and other disciplines.

==Futurology==
&quot;Futurology&quot;—or &quot;futures studies&quot;, futures research, and foresight—can be summarized as being concerned with &quot;three P&#x27;s and a W&quot;, i.e. &quot;possible, probable, and preferable&quot; futures, plus &quot;wildcards&quot;, which are low-probability, high-impact events, should they occur. Even with high-profile, probable events, such as the fall of telecommunications costs, the growth of the internet, or the aging demographics of particular countries, there is often significant uncertainty in the rate or continuation of a trend. Thus, a key part of futures analysis is the managing of uncertainty and risk.

== Futurists and futurology ==
Not all futurists engage in the practice of futurology as generally defined. Futurists who engage in positive science are historically associated with the cult of the Futurism art movement. At the turn of the 20th century Giacomo Balla was thrilled at the prospect of machines rendering many daily aspects of traditional labor obsolete, leaving humans with responsibility only for fragmented and repetitive tasks. Key figures in the Futurism art movement progressed to forge a alliance between artists and scientists. And while religious futurists, astrologers, occultists, New Age diviners, etc. use methodologies that include study, none of their personal revelation or belief-based work would fall within a consensus definition of futurology as used in academics or by futures studies professionals.

John McHale, author of &quot;The Future of the Future&quot;, published a &quot;Futures Directory&quot;, and directed a think tank called The Centre For Integrative Studies at the State University of New York (SUNY) in 1968. Futurists have started consulting groups or earn money as speakers, with examples including Alvin Toffler, John Naisbitt and Patrick Dixon. Frank Feather is a business speaker that presents himself as a pragmatic futurist. Some futurists have commonalities with science fiction while some science-fiction writers, such as Arthur C. Clarke, Alvin Toffler, and Herman Kahn were merely celebrities who nevertheless were used as credible sources by futurists engaging in Up Wing optimism. Science fiction visions therefore provided policymakers with ideas, which were challenged previously by the environmental movement. In the introduction to &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;, Ursula K. Le Guin distinguished futurists from novelists, writing of the study as the business of prophets, clairvoyants, and futurists. In her words, &quot;a novelist&#x27;s business is lying&quot;.

A 2001 survey of 108 futurists found the following shared assumptions:

# We are in the midst of a historical transformation. Current times are not just part of normal history.
# Multiple perspectives are at the heart of futures studies, including unconventional thinking, internal critique, and cross-cultural comparison.
# Consideration of alternatives. Futurists do not see themselves as value-free forecasters, but instead aware of multiple possibilities.
# Participatory futures. Futurists generally see their role as liberating the future in each person, and creating enhanced public ownership of the future. This is true worldwide.
# Long-term policy transformation. While some are more policy-oriented than others, almost all believe that the work of futures studies is to shape public policy, so it consciously and explicitly takes into account the long term.
# Part of the process of creating alternative futures and of influencing public (corporate, or international) policy is internal transformation. At international meetings, structural and individual factors are considered equally important.
# Complexity. Futurists believe that a simple one-dimensional or single-discipline orientation is not satisfactory. Trans-disciplinary approaches that take complexity seriously are necessary. Systems thinking, particularly in its evolutionary dimension, is also crucial.
# Futurists are motivated by change. They are not content merely to describe or forecast. They desire an active role in world transformation.
# They are hopeful for a better future as a &quot;strange attractor&quot;.
# Most believe they are pragmatists in this world, even as they imagine and work for another. Futurists have a long term perspective.
# Sustainable futures, understood as making decisions that do not reduce future options, that include policies on nature, gender, and other accepted paradigms. This applies to corporate futurists and other non-governmental organizations. Environmental sustainability is reconciled with the technological, spiritual, and post-structural ideals. Sustainability is not a &quot;back to nature&quot; ideal, but rather inclusive of technology and culture.

<text>The 1989 Spanish general election was held on Sunday, 29 October 1989, to elect the 4th of the Kingdom of Spain. All 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies were up for election, as well as 208 of 254 seats in the Senate. An election had not been due until 28 July 1990 at latest, but Prime Minister Felipe González called for a snap election nine months ahead of schedule, allegedly on the need of implementing tough economic measures. González hoped to capitalize on a still strong economy and his party&#x27;s electoral success in a European Parliament election held in June, after a troubled legislature which had seen an increase of social protest on his government&#x27;s economic policy and the calling of a massive general strike in 1988.

The election was regarded as one of the most controversial in the democratic history of Spain. Close results in many constituencies, coupled with severe flaws in electoral register data, an inefficient structure of the electoral administration and the ongoing political struggle between the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) and the opposition parties over the Socialist absolute majority in the Congress of Deputies, led to a major scandal when election results in a number of constituencies were contested under accusations of irregularities and fraud. Judicial courts were forced to intervene, determining by-elections for Murcia, Pontevedra and Melilla. The issue was appealed to the Constitutional Court of Spain, which overruled previous rulings and validated the vote in Melilla only, with a new election being held on 25 March 1990. In the end, the disputed seat was won by the People&#x27;s Party (PP), depriving the PSOE of its 176th seat in Congress–and with it, the outright majority it had held since 1982.

The election saw an erosion in popular support for the incumbent Socialists, who nonetheless emerged again as the largest party by a decisive margin, with 68 more seats than the PP. As a result, Felipe González was able to be re-elected for a third consecutive term in office with confidence and supply support from the Canarian Independent Groups (AIC). The newly amalgamated PP, led into the election by José María Aznar, exceeded initial expectations and slightly improved on the People&#x27;s Coalition 1986 result while performing better than in the June European Parliament election. Julio Anguita&#x27;s left-wing coalition, United Left (IU), scored a remarkable success by doubling its 1986 totals, whereas Adolfo Suárez&#x27;s Democratic and Social Centre (CDS) fell short of its goal of becoming a government alternative and lost votes and seats.

==Overview==
===Electoral system===
The Spanish were envisaged as an imperfect bicameral system. The Congress of Deputies had greater legislative power than the Senate, having the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a prime minister and to override Senate vetoes by an absolute majority of votes. Nonetheless, the Senate possessed a few exclusive (yet limited in number) functions—such as its role in constitutional amendment—which were not subject to the Congress&#x27; override. Voting for the was on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprised all nationals over 18 years of age and in full enjoyment of their political rights.

For the Congress of Deputies, 348 seats were elected using the D&#x27;Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with an electoral threshold of three percent of valid votes—which included blank ballots—being applied in each constituency. Seats were allocated to constituencies, corresponding to the provinces of Spain, with each being allocated an initial minimum of two seats and the remaining 248 being distributed in proportion to their populations. Ceuta and Melilla were allocated the two remaining seats, which were elected using plurality voting. The use of the electoral method resulted in an effective threshold based on the district magnitude and the distribution of votes among candidacies.

As a result of the aforementioned allocation, each Congress multi-member constituency was entitled the following seats:

For the Senate, 208 seats were elected using an open list partial block voting system, with electors voting for individual candidates instead of parties. In constituencies electing four seats, electors could vote for up to three candidates; in those with two or three seats, for up to two candidates; and for one candidate in single-member districts. Each of the 47 peninsular provinces was allocated four seats, whereas for insular provinces, such as the Balearic and Canary Islands, districts were the islands themselves, with the larger—Majorca, Gran Canaria and Tenerife—being allocated three seats each, and the smaller—Menorca, Ibiza–Formentera, Fuerteventura, La Gomera, El Hierro, Lanzarote and La Palma—one each. Ceuta and Melilla elected two seats each. Additionally, autonomous communities could appoint at least one senator each and were entitled to one additional senator per each million inhabitants.

The law did not provide for by-elections to fill vacated seats; instead, any vacancies that occurred after the proclamation of candidates and into the legislature&#x27;s term were to be covered by the successive candidates in the list and, when needed, by the designated substitutes, of which the list was required to include three.

===Election date===
The term of each chamber of the —the Congress and the Senate—expired four years from the date of their previous election, unless they were dissolved earlier. The election decree was required to be issued no later than the twenty-fifth day prior to the date of expiry of parliament and published on the following day in the Official State Gazette (BOE), with election day taking place between the fifty-fourth and the sixtieth day from publication. The previous election was held on 22 June 1986, which meant that the legislature&#x27;s term would expire on 22 June 1990. The election decree was required to be published in the BOE no later than 29 May 1990, with the election taking place on the sixtieth day from publication, setting the latest possible election date for the on Saturday, 28 July 1990.

The prime minister had the prerogative to propose the monarch to dissolve both chambers at any given time—either jointly or separately—and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence was in process, no state of emergency was in force and that dissolution did not occur before one year had elapsed since the previous one. Additionally, both chambers were to be dissolved and a new election called if an investiture process failed to elect a prime minister within a two-month period from the first ballot. Barred this exception, there was no constitutional requirement for simultaneous elections to the Congress and the Senate. Still, as of 2025 there has been no precedent of separate elections taking place under the 1978 Constitution.

While the opposition to the PSOE government had pressed for a snap election since the general strike in December 1988, it was not until the PSOE&#x27;s success in the 1989 European Parliament election, the end of the Spanish rotational Presidency of the Council of the European Union in June and the need for tough economic measures before the end of the year that Prime Minister Felipe González chose to trigger an early dissolution of the Cortes. On 25 August 1989, governmental sources confirmed that González would be calling an autumn election in the following days.

The were officially dissolved on 2 September 1989 after the publication of the dissolution decree in the BOE, setting the election date for 29 October and scheduling for both chambers to reconvene on 21 November.

==Background==
Felipe González&#x27;s second term as prime minister was characterized by economic growth, with public investments favoured by the Structural Funds coming from the European Economic Community to which Spain had recently accessed. The GDP grew by around or above 5% between 1987 and 1989 and unemployment decreased from 20.6% to 16.9%. This period saw a consolidation of welfare system reforms initiated during González&#x27;s first term, allowed through a better financing derived from a relatively progressive tax system. But the economic expansion fostered by the government&#x27;s liberal policies brought about an increase in wealth differences and of inequality, leading to social unrest and a loss of popularity for the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE), made apparent in the local, regional and European Parliament elections. In December 1988, the two major trade unions in Spain, CCOO and UGT, called a general strike which succeeded in paralyzing the country and in forcing González&#x27;s government to negotiate a partial withdrawal of its economic policies.

Concurrently, the opposition People&#x27;s Alliance (AP) suffered from a profound internal crisis since the 1986 election, which had seen the break up of the People&#x27;s Coalition and the resignation of party leader Manuel Fraga. His successor, Antonio Hernández Mancha, proved unable to improve AP&#x27;s electoral fortunes and saw his political credibility decimated after an unsuccessful attempt to bring down Felipe González through a motion of no confidence in March 1987. Hernández Mancha ended up quitting in early 1989, with Fraga returning as a caretaker leader who oversaw the merging of AP with its former allies, the People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Liberal Party (PL), into the new People&#x27;s Party (PP). Intending his national leadership as temporary, Fraga appointed a then-unknown President of Castile and León José María Aznar as his successor.

The 1986–1989 period saw an increase in the terror activity of the ETA Basque separatist group. This reached its peak with the Hipercor bombing on 19 June 1987, which—with 21 dead and 45 injured—would eventually become the deadliest attack in ETA&#x27;s history. Other deadly attacks included the Plaza República Dominicana bombing on 14 July 1986, three weeks after the previous general election and one day before the newly elected Cortes re-assembled, which left 12 dead and 32 injured; and the 1987 Zaragoza Barracks bombing, with 11 dead—including 5 children—and 88 injured. Concurrently, the PSOE government introduced a policy of dispersion of imprisoned terrorists throughout the entire Spanish territory in order to restrict contacts between them and prevent terrorist organizations from organizing themselves from prison. Political parties signed several anti-terrorist agreements, such as the Ajuria Enea Pact or the Madrid Agreement on Terrorism, aimed at increasing inter-party cooperation on the issue. In January 1989, ETA declared a ceasefire in order to start negotiation talks in Algiers with the Socialist government, but no successful conclusion was reached and ETA resumed its violence campaign.

==Parliamentary composition==
The tables below show the composition of the parliamentary groups in both chambers at the time of dissolution.


==Parties and candidates==
===Eligibility requirements===
Spanish citizens of age and with the legal capacity to vote could run for election, provided that they were not sentenced to imprisonment by a final court&#x27;s decision nor convicted by a judgement, even if not yet final, which imposed a penalty of forfeiture of eligibility or of specific disqualification or suspension from public office under specific offences: rebellion and terrorism when involving crimes against life, physical integrity or freedom of persons. Other general causes of ineligibility were imposed on members of the Spanish royal family; the president and members of the Constitutional Court, the General Council of the Judiciary, the Supreme Court, the Council of State and the Court of Auditors; the Ombudsman; the State&#x27;s Attorney General; high-ranking members—undersecretaries, secretaries-general, directors-general and chiefs of staff—of Spanish government departments, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, government delegations, the Social Security and other government agencies; heads of diplomatic missions in foreign states or international organizations; judges and public prosecutors in active service; Armed Forces and police corps personnel in active service; members of electoral commissions; the chair of RTVE; the director of the Electoral Register Office; the governor and deputy governor of the Bank of Spain; the chairs of the Official Credit Institute and other official credit institutions; and members of the Nuclear Safety Council; as well as a number of territorial-level officers in the aforementioned government bodies and institutions being barred from running, during their tenure of office, in constituencies within the whole or part of their respective area of jurisdiction. Disqualification provisions for the Cortes Generales extended to any employee of a foreign state and to members of regional governments, as well as the impossibility of running simultaneously as candidate for both the Congress and Senate.

The electoral law allowed for parties and federations registered in the interior ministry, coalitions and groupings of electors to present lists of candidates. Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election were required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors needed to secure the signature of at least one percent of the electorate in the constituencies for which they sought election, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates.

===Main competing lists===
Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which contested the election:
The People&#x27;s Party (PP) and Navarrese People&#x27;s Union (UPN) signed a coalition agreement on 8 September 1989 to run together in Navarre, renewing the alliance in existence between the PP&#x27;s predecessors, the People&#x27;s Alliance (AP) and the People&#x27;s Coalition (CP), and UPN, in both the 1982 and 1986 elections.

==Campaign period==
Despite Aznar&#x27;s designation as PP candidate, the opposition remained divided and weak on the road to the 1989 election. This, coupled with a buoyant economy, made a new PSOE victory inevitable. The electoral campaign, thus, focused on whether the Socialists would be able to maintain their absolute majority on the Congress of Deputies for a third term in office. United Left had also appointed a new leader, Julio Anguita, and had high expectations to increase their parliamentary representation from the 7 seats they had won in 1986. During the campaign, Felipe González pledged that this would be the last time he would stand for the office of Prime Minister. He would eventually stand for two more elections, until 1996.

====Initial reactions====
The 1989 election night was one of the most dramatic since González&#x27;s first victory in 1982, as PSOE&#x27;s overall majority in the Congress of Deputies—set at 176—lingered during the entire vote tally. Exit polls and initial counts showed the PSOE below the majority threshold—with as few as 170 seats in some projections—. As the vote tally progressed, the party was allocated more seats, and with 98% of the votes counted at 4 am it was awarded the decisive 176th seat. Earlier in the night, the party&#x27;s Secretary for Organization Txiki Benegas, Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra and González himself had commented that, notwithstanding the outcome, the PSOE still remained the largest party by far and would lead the new government on its own, rejecting any coalition deal. The tight result could not hide the loss of nearly 800,000 voters and a clear erosion in support since 1986, which led opposition parties and some international media—such as the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot; or &quot;The Times&quot;—to ask González for a change of direction in government, accusing him of acting &quot;arrogantly&quot; during his previous seven years in office.

PP candidate José María Aznar found his party&#x27;s results as &quot;satisfactory&quot;, slightly improving on Fraga&#x27;s result in 1986. Additionally, the PP had won the election in Madrid for the first time ever, considered as a symbolical feat as both Aznar and González were personally leading their parties&#x27;s lists in the constituency. IU experienced a remarkable growth by doubling its 1986 results, with its leaders highlighting &quot;the electorate&#x27;s displacement to the left&quot;. On the other hand, the CDS lost votes and seats compared to 1986 and its result was commented as &quot;not the one I expected for&quot; by party leader Adolfo Suárez, who also acknowledged his public image had &quot;deteriorated&quot; in recent times. The breakdown of results would show a noticeable transfer of votes from the PSOE to IU in industrial and urban areas, with the Socialists holding their own in rural constituencies.

====Irregularities and judicial intervention====
During the days after the election, the 176th seat determining the PSOE&#x27;s absolute majority remained in dispute. PP leaders voiced their concerns over a delay in the Ministry of the Interior&#x27;s presentation of detailed results during the election night, during which the PSOE was awarded several seats by very few votes in the later stages of the vote tally; seats which ultimately proved decisive for the PSOE retaining its majority. In Barcelona, the PP claimed that its own tallies awarded the PSC–PSOE up to 5,000 votes less than those officially acknowledged by the Ministry, which would have resulted in them winning a 4th seat in the province from the PSC. Additionally, they alleged that this seat had changed hands from the PP to the PSC only when 99.98% of the votes were counted. IU&#x27;s Julio Anguita criticized the vote tally, openly questioning that &quot;How can [PSOE] go from 172 to 176 seats so fast?&quot;. IU announced that they would ask the Electoral Commission to review the voting records of 1,087 polling station wards in the constituency of Murcia, where the last seat had been allocated to PSOE from IU by a narrow margin of 96 votes.

PP claims in Barcelona were cast off after the tally of Spaniards voting abroad gave an even larger margin for the PSC and secured their 14th seat in the constituency. On 5 November, the Electoral Commission found irregularities in Murcia after determining that the number of voters and of ballot papers did not match up in fifteen wards. The new provisional results published on 6 November, which did not include the wards where irregularities had been found, awarded the last seat to PSOE by just two votes. Some IU members openly accused the PSOE of fraud, claiming that Socialist intervenors had voted twice in some wards not just in Murcia, but also in Málaga, Madrid and La Rioja—where, however, election results had not been contested—. A new tally on 11 November in Murcia resulted in the Commission awarding the seat to IU, which prompted a PSOE appeal to the Superior Court of Justice of Murcia. Concurrently, both the PP and the CDS alleged to have found irregularities in several polling stations in Melilla and Pontevedra, where seats had been awarded to PSOE by just a handful of votes, and asked for the vote to be annulled in those constituencies. The chaotic situation was further aggravated when, on 22 November, the PP denounced that it had found cases of name duplicity in the electoral register of Ceuta, with the party also demanding for the election to be repeated in Murcia after denouncing irregular procedures by the Electoral Commission during the vote tally. The Spanish Attorney General, Javier Moscoso, claimed on 24 November that Murcia&#x27;s disputed seat belonged to PSOE. On 1 December, the Superior Court of Murcia anulled the election results in the constituency and required the government to call a by-election within three months.

The judicial decision in Murcia raised speculation in other constituencies where results had been appealed that the local Superior Courts would issue similar rulings. This happened in Pontevedra, where the number of counted votes exceeded the number of voters. Finally, the Superior Court of Andalusia anulled the election results in Melilla, but dismissed the appeal on Ceuta where it declared their validity. González&#x27;s government announced that it would appeal the decision to the Constitutional Court which, on 25 January 1990, provisionally suspended the scheduled re-run elections in Murcia, Pontevedra and Melilla. From 15 to 19 February, the Court overruled the Superior Courts of Justice of Murcia and Galicia and cancelled the re-run elections on Murcia and Pontevedra, declaring the 29 October results as valid and final. For Melilla, it determined that the scale of the detected irregularities was such that the re-run election was required to proceed. The election in Melilla on 25 March 1990 gave the constituency&#x27;s single deputy and its two senators to the PP, thus reducing the PSOE&#x27;s deputy count to 175. A re-run election was also held on 7 October 1990 in a polling station in Mamblas, Ávila, as the consequence of a judicial conflict between the PP and the CDS over one senator in the constituency, which resulted in the PP winning the disputed senator from the CDS.

Irregularities were found to be a consequence of flawed electoral registers, lack of knowledge on election rules by those appointed to integrate the polling bureaus, a lack of means for the active monitoring of the election process and an inefficient structure of the electoral administration, all of which was coupled with the detection of some illicit votes in several wards. While these flaws had been present in past elections, the closeness of results in the 1989 election and the fact that the PSOE overall majority relied on a single seat meant that these were abruptly exposed. As a result, the electoral law was subsequently amended in 1991 in order to improve the efficiency of the electoral administration.

===Government formation===

On 5 December 1989, Felipe González was re-elected as prime minister in the first round of voting with an absolute majority of votes. Although the PSOE had lost its outright majority, due to Herri Batasuna&#x27;s four deputies declining to take their seats, it had a majority among those deputies who did attend.

As a consequence of seat disputes, only 332 deputies had been sworn in for the investiture, as results for the remaining 18 seats had been temporarily suspended by the Superior Courts. After all 350 seats had been allocated, Prime Minister Felipe González voluntarily submitted himself to a vote of confidence to rectify the atypical investiture vote. The result was essentially a repeat of the December 1989 voting, with some parties previously voting &#x27;No&#x27; choosing to abstain. González&#x27;s parliamentary support remained the same as it was.

<text>Jimmy Montgomery BEM (born 9 October 1943) is an English retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He made a record 627 appearances for his hometown club Sunderland with 537 of these appearances being in the league, after joining the club as a youngster in 1960.

In June 2015, Montgomery was awarded the British Empire Medal for his services to football in the Queen&#x27;s birthday honours list.

==Career==
Montgomery made his debut aged only 18 against Walsall, going on to serve 17 years at the club.

Montgomery featured for Sunderland in the 1973 FA Cup Final, where they beat Leeds United 1–0 to win the FA Cup for only the second time in their history. His most memorable contribution in that match was a double save from Trevor Cherry and Peter Lorimer which prevented Leeds from equalising. This was described in an internet article in 2012 as the greatest double save ever.

Montgomery also played for Southampton, Birmingham City and Nottingham Forest. After he retired as a player Montgomery returned to Birmingham City and Sunderland as a goalkeeping coach.

At international level, Montgomery played for the England U23 national team.

==Personal life==
He is related to James Montgomery, also a footballer.

In October 2020, a mural of Montgomery celebrating the 1973 Sunderland FA Cup win was unveiled on The Times Inn public house overlooking the River Wear at Wear Street, Sunderland.

<doc id="1286674" wikidata="Q1062311" url="?curid=1286674" title="Copa CONMEBOL">
<text>The Copa CONMEBOL () was an annual football cup competition organized by CONMEBOL between 1992 and 1999 for South American football clubs. During its time of existence, it was a very prestigious South American club football contest, similar to the UEFA Cup. Clubs qualified for the competition based on their performance in their national leagues and cup competitions. Teams that were not able to qualify for the Copa Libertadores would play in this tournament. The tournament was played as a knockout cup. The tournament ended in 1999, following the expansion of the Copa Libertadores to 32 teams. 

The Copa Mercosur and Copa Merconorte -which both started in 1998- replaced the Copa CONMEBOL, and the merger of those 3 cups would later transformed in the current Copa Sudamericana.

The last champion of the competition was Talleres, while Atlético Mineiro is the most successful club in the cup history, having won the tournament two times. The cup was won by seven different clubs but it was never won consecutively.

==Format==

===Qualification===
Each national association was assigned a number of entries determined by CONMEBOL which changed slightly from one edition to another. The best teams from the previous season that did not qualify for the Copa Libertadores through their league qualified for the Copa CONMEBOL. The tournament itself was played in two-legged knockout stages. The champion of the Copa CONMEBOL disputed the Recopa Sudamericana, the Copa de Oro and the Copa Master de CONMEBOL, albeit irregularly.

===Tournament===
The tournament started in the first stage in which 16 clubs were paired in a series of two-legged knockout ties in the round of 16, the first of four stages that worked on a single elimination phase knockout system that culminated in the finals. During each stage of the tournament, ties were decided on points, followed by goal difference, away goals, then a penalty shootout after full-time of the second leg, if necessary.

<text>Birger is a Scandinavian name from Old Norse, &quot;bjarga&quot;, meaning &quot;to help, to save, to protect&quot;. It is widely used in Norway as Birger but also as Børge. The Swedish variant of &quot;Birger&quot; would soon evolve into &quot;Börje&quot;, however, the prior form would remain common, and was not confused with its successor.

<text>A is the term for a Japanese emperor who had abdicated and entered the Buddhist monastic community by receiving the &quot;Pravrajya&quot; rite. The term can also be shortened to .

Cloistered emperors sometimes acted as &quot;Daijō Tennō&quot; (retired emperors), therefore maintaining effective power. This title was first assumed by Emperor Shōmu and was later used by many other emperors who &quot;took the tonsure&quot;, signifying a decision to become a Buddhist monk. The last cloistered emperor was Emperor Reigen (r. 1663-1687) in the Edo period.

<doc id="1286754" wikidata="Q245629" url="?curid=1286754" title="Andre Reed">
<text>Andre Darnell Reed (born January 29, 1964) is an American former professional football wide receiver who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons, primarily with the Buffalo Bills. He played college football for the Kutztown Golden Bears and was selected by the Bills in the fourth round of the 1985 NFL draft with the 86th overall selection. Following 15 seasons with the Bills, where he earned Pro Bowl honors seven times, Reed spent his final season as a member of the Washington Redskins in 2000.

Reed currently ranks 18th in all-time NFL touchdown receptions with 87 and tenth in all-time NFL post-season receptions with 85. Reed helped lead the Bills to four consecutive, although winless, Super Bowls, Super Bowl XXV to Super Bowl XXVIII.

At the time of his 2001 retirement, Reed was second in all-time NFL career receptions. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Reed was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania on January 29, 1964. He began his football career at Allentown&#x27;s Dieruff High School, where he played quarterback and competed in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, which is known for producing top collegiate and NFL football talent. In his senior year in 1981, Reed helped lead Dieruff to an EPC tri-championship, tying for the championship with Emmaus High School and Whitehall High School.

==College career==
Reed then attended Kutztown University, where he moved to the wide receiver position and quickly drew the attention of the NFL for his speed and durability at the receiver position. He set nine school records and finished his college career with 142 receptions for 2,020 yards and 14 touchdowns.

==Professional career==
===Buffalo Bills===
In the 1985 NFL draft, Reed was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round with the 86th overall selection, making him just the second player ever from Kutztown to be selected in an NFL Draft; the first was Don Shaver in 1981. Reed played for the Bills for 15 consecutive seasons, from 1985 through 1999, during which he helped lead the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowls. He was released in the 2000 offseason along with fellow longtime Bills&#x27; players Thurman Thomas and Bruce Smith after the team found itself in severe salary cap trouble; the roster dump began a period of downfall for the Buffalo Bills, who did not again reach the playoffs until the 2017 season.

====&quot;The Comeback&quot;====

In addition to the important role he played in taking the Bills to four consecutive Super Bowls, Reed is also remembered for his contributions to the Bills&#x27; January 3, 1993, playoff victory over the Houston Oilers, a game that has come to be known simply as &quot;The Comeback.&quot; In the game, which Houston led 35–3 during the third quarter, Reed caught three touchdowns in the second half, leading Buffalo&#x27;s rally from a 32-point deficit in what became the largest comeback in NFL history. Reed finished the game with eight receptions for 136 yards and three touchdowns. The game has been enshrined in NFL history as one of the greatest games ever played. It also is recognized as one of the largest comebacks by any team in the history of all of the American professional sports.

Following the Bills&#x27; victory over Houston, Reed went on to catch eight passes for 152 yards in the Bills&#x27; 52–17 Super Bowl XXVII loss, on January 31, 1993, to the Dallas Cowboys.

===Denver Broncos and Washington Redskins===
In 2000, Reed signed a two-year contract with the Denver Broncos in June but was buried on the depth chart behind Rod Smith, Ed McCaffrey, Robert Brooks, and Travis McGriff. Reed eventually asked for his release from the Broncos after then Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan informed Reed that he would be inactive for their 2000 season opener and wanted to make a more immediate contribution. He eventually joined the Washington Redskins and retired after the 2000 season.

==NFL records==
Reed ranks 15th in all-time NFL history in touchdown receptions with 87 and ninth in NFL history in all-time post-season receptions with 85 as of 2022.

He exceeded 1,000 receiving yards four times in a 16-year career and rushed for 500 yards and a touchdown on 75 carries. With the Bills, Reed played in four consecutive Super Bowls (1991–1994) and was selected to the Pro Bowl in seven consecutive seasons (1988–1994). He set season career highs with 90 receptions in 1994, ten touchdowns in 1991, and 1,312 receiving yards in 1989.

A tribute to his physical durability, Reed played in 234 NFL games between 1985 and 2000, the 99th-most games played by any player in NFL history, including players in less physically demanding positions, including kickers and punters.

===Super Bowl records===
In his four Super Bowls, Reed recorded 27 receptions, the third-most total career Super Bowl receptions in NFL history behind Jerry Rice&#x27;s 33 and Travis Kelce&#x27;s 35, and 323 total Super Bowl receiving yards, sixth-most in Super Bowl history.

==NFL career statistics==
==Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame==
In 2006, Reed was voted into the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame, joining a number of other players from Bills history whose names are enshrined in cement inside Highmark Stadium. Reed&#x27;s was inducted in 2009 along with former teammate Bruce Smith and team owner Ralph Wilson. Through the night, Reed was referred to multiple times as &quot;future Hall of Famer&quot; with various speeches voicing their ringing endorsement for Reed as a candidate.

==Pro Football Hall of Fame==
Reed became eligible for induction into the NFL&#x27;s Pro Football Hall of Fame, the highest honor afforded a former NFL player, in 2006. However, he was not selected for induction in any of his first seven years of eligibility due partly to a logjam of accomplished wide receiver candidates, including Art Monk, Michael Irvin, and Cris Carter. Although Irvin, Monk and Carter are now enshrined as of 2007, 2008 and 2013 respectively, the logjam became worse for Reed when he was again overlooked in 2009 and 2010, which saw wide receiver candidates Jerry Rice and Tim Brown both eligible for the first time. Rice has long been considered one of the greatest players in league history and was almost assured of being a first-ballot Hall of Famer, making 2010 a long shot for Reed. As expected, Rice was inducted, which cleared some of the logjam going forward for Reed. Reed remained a Hall of Fame candidate in 2011, 2012, and 2013 but was passed over each of those years.

On February 1, 2014, Reed was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and he was inducted on August 2, 2014.

==Television career==
Since his NFL retirement in 2000, Reed has provided football commentary on the ESPN2 show, &quot;First Take&quot;, and appears periodically as a football analyst on &quot;NFL on Fox&quot;. He has also appeared on the Spike TV sports series &quot;Pros vs. Joes&quot; in the show&#x27;s second season.

He is also known for &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; where he appeared in &quot;Ka&#x27;aelike&quot; (Season 7, Episode 12). He played a federal prosecutor on &quot;MacGyver&quot;. He also appeared on &quot;Magnum PI&quot; Season 2 Episode 17 as himself and as a car salesman who abuses his uncanny resemblance to Andre Reed.

==Philanthropy==
The Andre Reed Foundation was established in 2010 to help underprivileged children reach their full potential and become responsible contributors to their communities. Reed is currently a Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America (BGCA) Ambassador after being inducted to their Hall of Fame in 2015. In addition, he leads up a literacy program for underprivileged youth in the BGCA, called Read with Reed 83 Challenge.

==Legacy==
On October 18, 2014, Kutztown University, Reed&#x27;s alma mater, renamed University Field to Andre Reed Stadium in his honor in a ceremony.

==Popular culture==
Reed is mentioned in the 1996 film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; as one of several NFL wide receivers with lucrative contracts, as Rod Tidwell, a fictional wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, played by Cuba Gooding, Jr., tells his agent, played by Tom Cruise, that his contract warrants high pay.

==Personal life==
In 2023, Reed married Theresa Villano in San Diego, California. Reed has hosted an annual celebrity golf event for over 10 years. Reed&#x27;s nephew, Jackson Reed, plays college football for Susquehanna University as a wide receiver. Reed regularly keeps in touch with Jackson, who also wears the number 83. Jackson attended his uncle&#x27;s celebrity golf event in the summer of 2024 alongside friends and teammates from the Susquehanna Riverhawks Football team. Jackson, born and raised in Pennsylvania like his Uncle, is a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles but still roots for the Buffalo Bills because of his uncle&#x27;s history with the team.

In 2025, Reed was named commissioner of the Entertainment Football Association, an arena football league with teams along the Eastern Seaboard.

<doc id="1286759" wikidata="Q670103" url="?curid=1286759" title="Eino Kaila">
<text>Eino Sakari Kaila (8 August 1890 – 31 July 1958) was a Finnish philosopher, critic and teacher. He worked in numerous fields including psychology (sometimes considered to be the founder of Finnish psychology), physics and theater, and attempted to find unifying principles behind various branches of human and natural sciences.

== Life ==
Eino Kaila was born in Alajärvi, Finland. Kaila&#x27;s father, Erkki Kaila, was a Protestant minister and later archbishop. He graduated from the University of Helsinki in 1910. In the 1920s he worked in the field of literary criticism and psychology as a professor at the University of Turku and is said to have been the first to introduce gestalt psychology to Finland. He was a part of the cultural circles of the time with the likes of Jean Sibelius and Frans Eemil Sillanpää. In 1916 he married the painter Anna Lovisa Snellman, who was granddaughter of Johan Vilhelm Snellman. He had University positions as lecturer in Helsinki and professor in Turku, and in 1930 he was appointed professor of theoretical philosophy at the University of Helsinki. In the 1930s, Kaila was closely associated with the Vienna Circle.

During World War II, Kaila lectured in Germany. In 1948 Kaila became a member of the Finnish Academy. He died in Kirkkonummi on 31 July 1958.

== Ideas ==
Despite being greatly influenced by the logical positivists and critical of unempirical speculation, an aspect common to all of Kaila&#x27;s work was in strive for a holistic, almost pantheistic understanding of things. He also maintained a more naturalist approach to psychology. His book &quot;Persoonallisuus&quot; (1934, Personality) was a psychological study with philosophical dimensions, in which emphasized the biological nature of psychological phenomena. During the last years of his life he attempted to construct a theory of everything in &quot;Terminalkausalität Als Die Grundlage Eines Unitarischen Naturbegriffs&quot;, but this, what was meant to be the first installment in a more extensive study, was not met with much enthusiasm outside of Finland.

Though he withdrew his support of the National Socialists before the end of the Second World War, he wrote about the differences between &quot;western&quot; and &quot;eastern&quot; thought and claimed that the homogeneity of the people was a necessity for a functioning democracy. After the war his close friendships with Edwin Linkomies and Veikko Antero Koskenniemi put a political shadow even over Kaila.

== Influence ==
Kaila&#x27;s most famous pupil was Georg Henrik von Wright, who was the successor of Ludwig Wittgenstein at the University of Cambridge. The tradition of highly German-influenced analytical-idealist philosophy which Kaila championed remained unchallenged in Finnish philosophy until the appearance of continental influences in the 1980s.

Kaila founded the psychological laboratory at the University of Helsinki, and educated the next generation of psychologists. He contributed to founding professorship in psychology, and to establishment of the Faculty of Political Science together with Edwin Linkomies.

<doc id="1286768" wikidata="Q647220" url="?curid=1286768" title="Use-define chain">
<text>Within computer science, a use-definition chain (or UD chain) is a data structure that consists of a use &quot;U&quot;, of a variable, and all the definitions &quot;D&quot; of that variable that can reach that use without any other intervening definitions. A UD Chain generally means the assignment of some value to a variable.

A counterpart of a &quot;UD Chain&quot; is a definition-use chain (or DU chain), which consists of a definition &quot;D&quot; of a variable and all the uses &quot;U&quot; reachable from that definition without any other intervening definitions.

Both UD and DU chains are created by using a form of static code analysis known as data flow analysis. Knowing the use-def and def-use chains for a program or subprogram is a prerequisite for many compiler optimizations, including constant propagation and common subexpression elimination.

==Purpose==
Making the use-define or define-use chains is a step in liveness analysis, so that logical representations of all the variables can be identified and tracked through the code.

Consider the following snippet of code:

 int x = 0; /* A */
 x = x + y; /* B */
 /* 1, some uses of x */
 x = 35; /* C */
 /* 2, some more uses of x */
Notice that codice_1 is assigned a value at three points (marked A, B, and C). However, at the point marked &quot;1&quot;, the use-def chain for codice_1 should indicate that its current value must have come from line B (and its value at line B must have come from line A). Contrariwise, at the point marked &quot;2&quot;, the use-def chain for codice_1 indicates that its current value must have come from line C. Since the value of the codice_1 in block 2 does not depend on any definitions in block 1 or earlier, codice_1 might as well be a different variable there; practically speaking, it &quot;is&quot; a different variable — call it codice_6.
 int x = 0; /* A */
 x = x + y; /* B */
 /* 1, some uses of x */
 int x2 = 35; /* C */
 /* 2, some uses of x2 */
The process of splitting codice_1 into two separate variables is called live range splitting. See also static single assignment form.

==Setup==

The list of statements determines a strong order among statements. 
*Statements are labeled using the following conventions: , where &quot;i&quot; is an integer in ; and &quot;n&quot; is the number of statements in the basic block
*Variables are identified in italic (e.g., &quot;v&quot;,&quot;u&quot; and &quot;t&quot;)
*Every variable is assumed to have a definition in the context or scope. (In static single assignment form, use-define chains are explicit because each chain contains a single element.)
For a variable, such as &quot;v&quot;, its declaration is identified as &quot;V&quot; (italic capital letter), and for short, its declaration is identified as . In general, a declaration of a variable can be in an outer scope (e.g., a global variable).

===Definition of a variable===

When a variable, &quot;v&quot;, is on the LHS of an assignment statement, such as , then is a definition of &quot;v&quot;. Every variable (&quot;v&quot;) has at least one definition by its declaration (&quot;V&quot;) (or initialization).

===Use of a variable===

If variable, &quot;v&quot;, is on the RHS of statement , there is a statement, with &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot; and , that it is a definition of &quot;v&quot; and it has a use at (or, in short, when a variable, &quot;v&quot;, is on the RHS of a statement , then &quot;v&quot; has a use at statement ).

==Execution==

Consider the sequential execution of the list of statements, , and what can now be observed as the computation at statement, &quot;j&quot;:

*A definition at statement with &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot; is alive at &quot;j&quot;, if it has a use at a statement with &quot;k&quot; ≥ &quot;j&quot;. The set of alive definitions at statement &quot;i&quot; is denoted as and the number of alive definitions as formula_1. ( is a simple but powerful concept: theoretical and practical results in space complexity theory, access complexity(I/O complexity), register allocation and cache locality exploitation are based on .)
*A definition at statement kills all previous definitions ( with &quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;i&quot;) for the same variables.

==Execution example for def-use-chain==
This example is based on a Java algorithm for finding the gcd. (It is not important to understand what this function does.)
/**
 * @param(a, b) The values used to calculate the divisor.
 * @return The greatest common divisor of a and b.
int gcd(int a, int b) { 
 int c = a;
 int d = b; 
 if (c == 0)
 return d;
 while (d != 0) { 
 if (c &gt; d)
 c = c - d;
 else
 d = d - c;
 return c; 


To find out all def-use-chains for variable d, do the following steps:

#Search for the first time the variable is defined (write access).
#: In this case it is &quot; (l.7)
# Search for the first time the variable is read.
#: In this case it is &quot;
# Write down this information in the following style: [name of the variable you are creating a def-use-chain for, the concrete write access, the concrete read access]
#: In this case it is: 

Repeat these steps in the following style: combine each write access with each read access (but NOT the other way round).

The result should be:

 [d, d=b, return d] 
 [d, d=b, while(d!=0)] 
 [d, d=b, if(c&gt;d)] 
 [d, d=b, c=c-d] 
 [d, d=b, d=d-c]
 [d, d=d-c, while(d!=0)] 
 [d, d=d-c, if(c&gt;d)] 
 [d, d=d-c, c=c-d] 
 [d, d=d-c, d=d-c]

You have to take care, if the variable is changed by the time.

For example: From line 7 down to line 13 in the source code, is not redefined / changed.
At line 14, could be redefined. This is why you have to recombine this write access on with all possible read accesses which could be reached.
In this case, only the code beyond line 10 is relevant. Line 7, for example, cannot be reached again. For your understanding, you can imagine 2 different variables :

 [d1, d1=b, return d1] 
 [d1, d1=b, while(d1!=0)] 
 [d1, d1=b, if(c&gt;d1)] 
 [d1, d1=b, c=c-d1] 
 [d1, d1=b, d1=d1-c]
 [d2, d2=d2-c, while(d2!=0)] 
 [d2, d2=d2-c, if(c&gt;d2)] 
 [d2, d2=d2-c, c=c-d2] 
 [d2, d2=d2-c, d2=d2-c]
As a result, you could get something like this. The variable would be replaced by 
/**
 * @param(a, b) The values used to calculate the divisor.
 * @return The greatest common divisor of a and b.
int gcd(int a, int b) {
 int c = a;
 int d; 
 if (c == 0)
 return b;
 if (b != 0) {
 if (c &gt; b) {
 c = c - b;
 d = b;
 else
 d = b - c;
 while (d != 0) { 
 if (c &gt; d)
 c = c - d;
 else
 d = d - c;
 } 
 return c; 


==Method of building a &quot;use-def&quot; (or &quot;ud&quot;) chain ==
# Set definitions in statement 
# For each in , find live definitions that have use in statement 
# Make a link among definitions and uses
# Set the statement , as definition statement 
# Kill previous definitions

With this algorithm, two things are accomplished:

#A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is created on the variable uses and definitions. The DAG specifies a data dependency among assignment statements, as well as a partial order (therefore parallelism among statements).
#When statement is reached, there is a list of &quot;live&quot; variable assignments. If only one assignment is live, for example, constant propagation might be used.

<text>Mixed raster content (MRC) is a method for compressing images that contain both binary-compressible text and continuous-tone components, using image segmentation methods to improve the level of compression and the quality of the rendered image. By separating the image into components with different compressibility characteristics, the most efficient and accurate compression algorithm for each component can be applied.

MRC-compressed images are typically packaged into a hybrid file format such as DjVu and sometimes PDF. This allows for multiple images, and the instructions to properly render and reassemble them, to be stored within a single file.

Some image scanners optionally support MRC when scanning to PDF. A typical manual states that without MRC, the image is generated in a single process, with text and graphics not distinguished. With MRC, separate processes are used for text, graphics, and other elements, producing clearer graphics and sharper text, at the price of slightly slower processing. MRC is recommended to optimise the scanning of documents with harder-to-read text or lower-quality graphics. MRC can also reduce the size of the scanned file, though higher compression using JBIG2 can sometimes lead to character substitution errors in scanned documents.

== File format ==

A form of MRC is defined by international standard bodies as ISO/IEC 16485, or ITU recommendation T.44 (accessible free of charge). It defines a file format with bilevel &quot;masks&quot; and two data layers in each &quot;stripe&quot; of the image. The mask can be encoded in ITU T.4, JBIG1, or JBIG2, while the images can be JPEG, JBIG1, or run-length encoded color. The format is loosely based on JPEG, with a APP13 segment registered for this purpose.

It is not known whether this file format is actually used, as formats like DjVu and PDF have their own ways of defining layers and masks.

<text>Roker Park was a football ground in Roker, Sunderland, England, which was the home of Sunderland from 1898 to 1997, before the club moved to the Stadium of Light. Its final capacity was around 22,500, with only a small part being seated; it had been much higher, attracting a record crowd of 75,118.

==History==

In the 1890s, the then Sunderland chairman and his brother decided to build a bigger ground for the club, to replace what was then the club&#x27;s current ground at Newcastle Road. The club had negotiated to buy farmland that belonged to a Mr. Tennant and part of the agreement was that Sunderland would have to build a house on the site as well as their new stadium. Until this house was built, Sunderland still had to pay rent on the land.

Within a year of the land being bought, Roker Park had been built, with the wooden stands only taking three months to build. The Clock Stand had 32 steps, no seats and a crush barrier for safety. The turf was brought from Ireland, and lasted for 38 years. The pitch was designed to have a slight drop of about one foot from the centre of the pitch to each corner to help with drainage. The first event at the ground was an &quot;Olympic Games and Band Contest&quot; on 12 August 1898. On 10 September 1898, Roker Park was officially opened by Charles Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry. The first match was a friendly against Liverpool which Sunderland won 1–0, with Jim Leslie scoring the stadium&#x27;s first ever goal.

The stadium soon became famous for what was often referred to as the &quot;Roker Roar&quot;, with then Tottenham and England captain Danny Blanchflower writing that “Nothing ever equalled the intensity of that wild roar at Roker Park”. 

The Roker End was concreted in 1912, and by 1913 the capacity had risen to 50,000. In 1929 the old wooden grandstand was demolished and replaced by a new Main Stand, which was designed by Archibald Leitch, whose influence, the criss-cross lattice work, can still be seen at Ibrox (Rangers), Home Park (Plymouth Argyle) and Goodison Park (Everton). Fragments of the iconic lattice work would later be used to separate parts of the car park at the Stadium of Light. The work on the new Main Stand nearly bankrupted the club. By this time the official capacity of Roker Park was 60,000 but at some matches they would have crowds as large as 75,000. More work continued in the 1930s and in 1936 the Clock Stand was rebuilt. The 114 m (375 ft) long structure was officially opened by Lady Raine, whose husband was Sir Walter Raine, the Chairman of Sunderland AFC at the time.

In 1943, during the Second World War, a bomb landed in the middle of the pitch and another nearby killed a policeman. In 1952, Roker Park was fitted with floodlights, being only the second ground in the country to do so after Arsenal&#x27;s Highbury. The lights were only a temporary addition, and were replaced by permanent structures at the end of the season after proving to be a success. When England hosted the 1966 World Cup, improvements were made to the Clock Stand, involving the addition of seats, and a roof over the Fulwell End. Temporary seating was also installed in the Fulwell End. The capacity of Roker Park during the World Cup was 40,310.

In 1955, Roker Park hosted an FA Cup Semi-Final replay, between (eventual winners) Newcastle United and York City, who were then in the third tier of English Football. Newcastle won the game 2–0 in front of a crowd of 55,239. Sunderland were in the other semi-final, but lost out 1–0 to Manchester City.

During the 1970s, there were even more improvements to Roker Park. These improvements included installing underground sprinklers, upgrading the floodlights to European Standard Lux Value, installing electronic crowd monitoring systems, and re-sheeting the roof. In the 1980s, with a downturn in the club&#x27;s fortunes (which included a season in the Football League Third Division), Roker Park started to decline. The capacity was severely reduced following the report in the Hillsborough Disaster of 1989, with the Roker End suffering the most.

In the early 1990s, new Football Association (FA) rules following the publication of the Taylor Report meant the stadium would have to have been upgraded to all-seater status, which would have consisted of a much smaller capacity than the sort of attendances that Sunderland could expect, as they had played in the penultimate First Division campaign (1990–91 season) before the creation of the Premier League and were aiming for a swift return to the top flight (although promotion was ultimately not achieved until the 1995–96 season). The site was too confined for expansion so chairman Bob Murray decided to look for a site for a new stadium. In 1992, plans were unveiled to build a 48,000-seat stadium near the Nissan car factory in Washington, which would be part of a mega leisure complex, but Nissan objected to such a site being developed near their factory. Instead, five years later in 1997, Sunderland moved to the Stadium of Light, in nearby Monkwearmouth, on the site of the closed Monkwearmouth Colliery.

The 1996–97 season was the last at Roker Park, which was also Sunderland&#x27;s first ever season in the Premier League, ending in relegation for the club. The last competitive match at the ground was a 3–0 victory over Everton.

Roker Park was also one of the most recent venues in the Premier League to feature standing accommodation. The only team to have had standing accommodation at its stadium since was Fulham, who still had terracing at Craven Cottage for one season after winning promotion in 2001, after which they ground-shared with QPR at Loftus Road for two seasons before returning to an all-seater Craven Cottage.

In a special ceremony after the final farewell game (coincidentally, also a 1–0 win against Liverpool, in which Sunderland midfielder John Mullin scored the stadium&#x27;s final goal at the Fulwell End), Charlie Hurley (voted the club&#x27;s Player of the Century) dug up the centre spot of the ground for it to be planted at the new stadium. Following the move to the Stadium of Light, Roker Park was demolished and in its place was built a housing estate. To commemorate Roker Park, the streets were named Promotion Close, Clockstand Close, Goalmouth Close, Midfield Drive, Turnstile Mews and Roker Park Close.

==Fan reactions to the move==
Following the demolition of Roker Park, playwright Tom Kelly and actor Paul Dunn created a one-man play called &quot;I Left My Heart at Roker Park&quot; about a fan struggling with the move and what Roker Park meant for him; the play had its first run in 1997, and has been revived since.

Actor and Sunderland supporter Peter O&#x27;Toole described Roker Park as his connection to the club, saying that as a result of the change of grounds he was less of a fan.

In 1998, the BBC broadcast a six-part documentary named &quot;Premier Passions&quot;, which included a chronicle of Sunderland during the 1996–97 season, in which the club was relegated from the Premier League the year after winning promotion from the Football League First Division, and moved to the Stadium of Light.

== International matches ==
Roker Park hosted the first of three full England internationals in 1899; a 13–2 victory over Ireland in the 1898–99 British Home Championship - the highest scoring game in the history of the tournament. Further Home Championship games were played at Roker Park in 1920 (v. Ireland) and 1950 (v. Wales), England winning both games. Three England B games were played at the ground, in 1954, 1980 and 1990. Roker Park also hosted four youth internationals - England U23 games in 1959 and 1970, and England U18 games in 1952 and 1956. The 1970 England U23 game against Scotland was abandoned due to snow after 60 minutes with England leading 3–1.

During the 1966 FIFA World Cup, Roker Park hosted three group stage games in Group 4 along with Ayresome Park, and a Quarter Final game between the Soviet Union and Hungary. The biggest World Cup attendance at the ground was 27,793 for the group stage game between the Soviet Union and Italy.

<doc id="1286798" wikidata="Q1393101" url="?curid=1286798" title="Fairchild C-82 Packet">
<text>The C-82 Packet is a twin-engine, twin-boom cargo aircraft designed and built by Fairchild Aircraft. It was used briefly by the United States Army Air Forces and the successor United States Air Force following World War II.

== Design and development ==
Developed by Fairchild, the C-82 was intended as a heavy-lift cargo aircraft to succeed prewar civilian designs like the Curtiss C-46 Commando and Douglas C-47 Dakota using non-critical materials in its construction, primarily plywood and steel, so as not to compete with the production of combat aircraft. However, by early 1943 changes in specifications resulted in plans for an all-metal aircraft. The aircraft was designed for a number of roles, including cargo carrier, troop transport, parachute drop, medical evacuation, and glider towing. It featured a rear-loading ramp with wide doors and an empennage set 14 feet (4.3 m) off the ground that permitted trucks and trailers to back up to the doors without obstruction. The single prototype first flew on 10 September 1944. The aircraft were built at the Fairchild factory in Hagerstown, Maryland, with deliveries beginning in 1945 and ending in September 1948.

Problems surfaced almost immediately. The aircraft was found to be underpowered and its airframe inadequate for the heavy lifting it was intended to perform. As a result, the Air Force turned to Fairchild for a solution to the C-82&#x27;s shortcomings. A redesign was quickly performed under the designation XC-82B, which would overcome all of the C-82A&#x27;s initial problems.

== Operational history ==


The C-82A was first flown in 1944, with its initial delivery not until June 1945; as a result, only a few entered service before the end of the war. In the end, only 223 C-82As would be built, a small number relative to other wartime production cargo aircraft. Most were used for cargo and troop transport, although a few were deployed for paratroop operations or towing military gliders. A redesign rectifying the aircraft&#x27;s main deficiencies, made its debut in 1947. Its subsequent improved design would result in the 1949 rollout of the Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcar.

In 1946, the United States Postal Service explored the concept of flying post offices using highly modified C-82s, which would operate similarly to those on trains where mail would be sorted by clerks and put in bags and then transferred to trucks on landing.

In 1948, a C-82 was fitted with track-gear landing gear, similar to the tracks on a crawler tractor, that allowed landings on unpaved, primitive runways.

During the Berlin Blockade, five C-82 aircraft carried large disassembled earthmoving equipment into the city to enable the construction of Berlin Tegel Airport in the fall of 1948.

Though relatively unsuccessful, the C-82A is best considered as an early development stage of the much more successful C-119B Flying Boxcar. The C-82A saw limited production before being replaced by the Flying Boxcar.

The C-82 was retired from the United States Air Force inventory in 1954.

=== Civil airline operations ===
After the C-82A became surplus to United States Air Force requirements, small numbers were sold to civilian operators in Brazil, Chile, Mexico and the United States and these were utilized for many years as rugged freight aircraft, capable of carrying bulky items of cargo. The last example was retired in the late 1980s.

== Variants ==
;XC-82
:Prototype, one built.

;C-82A Packet
:Initial production version, 220 built.

;EC-82A
: 1948, fitted with Firestone-designed tracked landing gear. 13 aircraft allocated for conversion from C-82A, but only one completed.

;XC-82B
: 1947, fitted with 2650hp Pratt &amp; Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial engines as a precursor to the C-119 series. One converted from a C-82A.

== Specifications (C-82A) ==


== Popular culture ==
The C-82 is perhaps best known for its role in the 1964 novel, &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot;, and Robert Aldrich&#x27;s original 1965 film version. Based on the novel by Elleston Trevor, the story features a C-82A Packet operated by the fictional &quot;Arabco Oil Company&quot;. It crashes in the Libyan desert, and is rebuilt by the passengers and crew, using one tail boom, and is then flown to safety. Such an aircraft was made for the movie, the Tallmantz Phoenix P-1. It was certified airworthy by the Federal Aviation Administration. Paul Mantz, possibly the greatest Hollywood stunt pilot in history with 25,000 flight hours, was killed with the cameras rolling when he bounced the skids of the craft down too hard in a touch-and-go, buckling and breaking the fuselage behind the wing, sending the craft nose-down hard into the desert, tumbling it completely over at 90 mph. Mantz was killed instantly.

=== Minor league baseball namesake ===
In 1953, the local minor league baseball team in Hagerstown, Maryland, was the Hagerstown Braves, so called because they were a minor league affiliate of the major league Milwaukee Braves. The Hagerstown team switched affiliation to the Washington Senators for the 1954 season. Instead of using the major league nickname, they chose the name Hagerstown Packets in tribute to the C-82. The Hagerstown Packets played in the Piedmont League during the 1954 and 1955 seasons.

<doc id="1286805" wikidata="Q1785150" url="?curid=1286805" title="Costas Georgiou">
<text>Costas Georgiou (; 21 December 1951 – 10 July 1976), also known by his alias Colonel Callan, was a Cypriot-born British court-martialled-soldier-turned-mercenary who was executed in Angola following the Luanda Trial for activities during the civil war phase of the Angolan War of Independence.

==Early life==
Georgiou was born in Cyprus in 1951, when the island was a British Crown colony. His family moved to London in 1963.

==British military career==
Georgiou joined the British Army and served, at first with distinction, in 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment in Northern Ireland. He was credited as being one of the best marksmen in the unit. Georgiou has been implicated as one of the participants in the Bloody Sunday massacre. During a hearing in 2000, a witness said he had fired 26 shots into the crowd.

In early 1972, Georgiou and three other paratroopers, Privates Cyril Verbeck, Stephen Peter Kirby, and Michael Wainhouse, carried out an armed robbery at a Post Office. All four men were court-martialled. Georgiou and Wainhouse were both found guilty and each eventually sentenced to five years in prison.

Despite later claiming to have been a colonel, Georgiou&#x27;s highest British Army rank was that of corporal, and he never received officer training. Others state Georgiou was a private soldier.

==Mercenary activity==

===Background: Roots of the conflict and Georgiou&#x27;s recruitment===
In 1975, Portugal recognised the independence of its former colony of Angola, and acknowledged the Soviet-aligned People&#x27;s Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) as the &quot;de jure&quot; government. The new government sought and received help in the form of Cuban military advisors, combat troops and material to fight against rival factions, which included the US-backed National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) and the South African-backed National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which received some US funding but no actual military aid. At the same time, British and American ex-military were recruited by the FNLA through private military companies (PMC; also known as PMIs, for &quot;Private Military Industry&quot;) in the United Kingdom and United States. Funding was provided by various NATO-member intelligence organisations, including the American CIA and the French SDECE.

By this time, Georgiou was out of the army and working part-time in construction. He had few prospects for more stable and gainful employment, given his dishonourable discharge for his part in robbing a post office. He was dating a Greek Cypriot woman, Rona Angelo. Her cousin was &#x27;Shotgun&#x27; Charlie Christodoulou, like Costas an ex-paratrooper of Greek Cypriot extraction, but honourably discharged. An acquaintance, Nick Hall, another dishonourably discharged airborne veteran, took the initiative of putting out an advertisement soliciting mercenary employment for four able-bodied young men. These would be Hall himself, Georgiou, Christodoulou and Costas&#x27;s old comrade Mick Wainhouse.

The men received a prompt reply from &quot;Dr.&quot; Donald Belford, a former British Army medic who had volunteered for a humanitarian aid group in Africa some years before. While there, he had treated several Angolan fighters wounded in the struggle against the Portuguese, earning their friendship and trust. One of his friends was Holden Roberto, leader of the FNLA. After independence, Belford became Roberto&#x27;s official emissary in the United Kingdom.

===Georgiou in Angola===
Georgiou was now using the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Colonel Tony Cullen&quot; – the surname of a former army friend and not, as mistakenly alleged by some journalists, inspired by the TV espionage series &quot;Callan&quot;. He went to Angola to work as an unpaid medical orderly, in advance of his three colleagues. It was while he was working in this position that he took part in the decisive action that brought him to the notice of the FNLA leadership. When FNLA soldiers fled the advance of a MPLA force, which threatened to capture the hospital to which he was assigned, Georgiou, and longtime Irish colleague Lyndon Sheehan, led a handful of Portuguese FNLA soldiers in an offensive defence, stopping the MPLA force in its tracks. The general trend of the war for the FNLA at that time was one of a steady string of defeats, ensuring that the defeat of the MPLA column attracted immediate attention from Holden Roberto who, to Georgiou&#x27;s surprise, appointed him head of the FNLA army, with the rank of Colonel (still unpaid). His three friends including Charlie Christodoulou arrived from Britain shortly afterwards. Within 48 hours of his arrival in Angola, Georgiou had already led his men in disarming and massacring a group of FNLA fighters (his supposed allies), whom he killed just for the &quot;fun&quot; of it all.

Thanks to continuing recruitment in England, a somewhat larger mercenary contingent was formed, but a full battalion was never realised. The enlarged force was still rather small relative to MPLA/Cuban forces, and many of the men were civilians with no military experience, and often refusing to submit to military discipline. This, combined with the foreign origin of most of the core leadership, (Georgiou, Christodoulou and the Portuguese), created a deep gulf between the officers and the British other ranks – to say nothing of the native Angolans recruited as infantry and support troops. Most of these had no military experience and many knew no English, or even Portuguese (then still the language of government and the native elite.)

The first contingent of mercenaries was mostly made up of professional soldiers, selected by a British private military company (PMC), Security Advisory Services (SAS), run by John Banks, Chris Dempster, and Dave Tomkins. Georgiou resented SAS&#x27;s own leadership structure within the group, and perceived John Banks, who remained based in Britain, as a personal threat to his own position when Banks did visit Angola. Georgiou became increasingly paranoid and belligerent toward his own men, murdering African soldiers and creating a climate of fear even among the British mercenaries, none of which aided the morale of the FNLA forces or their ability to wage war successfully against the MPLA. The British journalist Patrick Brogan called Georgiou a &quot;psychopathic killer&quot; who executed 14 of his fellow mercenaries for cowardice, and was extremely brutal to black people. By all accounts, Georgiou killed for pleasure, and at his trial, it was established that he had killed at least 170 Angolans. Georgiou was much hated and feared by the men under his command, and by the FLNA who regarded him as a loose cannon who was just as likely to attack them as he was the MPLA.

The second contingent of mercenaries sent from Britain, unlike the first, was made up mostly of working-class men with no military experience. Within a week of their arrival, about a dozen of the second contingent had accidentally maimed themselves by trying to use weapons that they did not fully understand. These undisciplined men quickly realised the perilous situation into which they had been placed, and the instability of their leadership. A group of them consequently seized vehicles and attempted to flee the country, firing on other FNLA forces in the process, including Chris Dempster. The deserters were quickly rounded up by Georgiou&#x27;s men, and fourteen were summarily executed by firing squad.

A third contingent of similarly inept mercenaries was recruited in the US by an American PMC.

The &quot;battalion&quot; fought several more dramatic engagements, including successful ambushes of minor MPLA detachments. However, given his limited resources and the fact that many of his men – European and native alike – were untrained, increasingly demoralised amateurs, Georgiou&#x27;s campaign was ultimately a failure. According to mercenary David Tomkins, the group spent most of its time foraging for food, usable weapons, and ammunition. Much of this foraging consisted of &quot;raids&quot; on villages, where the men would casually walk into town brandishing their weapons, searching for anything of use. Anyone who offered physical resistance would be shot.

Lack of proper equipment was one of the key factors in the failure of foreign mercenary units in Angola generally, and in Georgiou&#x27;s case in particular. The MPLA had Soviet tanks, artillery and crack Cuban troops fighting as their allies. The other two factions had mostly light infantry, not always the best trained and disciplined either. Another factor was leadership inexperience: Georgiou had absolutely no training or experience as a commissioned officer, nor did most of his counterparts in other units. Cuban accounts of the Angolan war speak of the mercenaries in a contemptuous tone. The majority of Cuban veterans of Angola describe the mercenaries they fought as inept soldiers whom they had no difficulty defeating.

==Trial and execution==
Georgiou was tried under the jurisdiction of the Angolan MPLA government in the Luanda Trial during June and July 1976. He was charged with illegally entering Angola as a mercenary, along with twelve other defendants. In addition he was charged with involvement in the massacre of fourteen fellow mercenaries at Maquela do Zombo in northern Angola, as well as with the murder and torture of enemy soldiers and civilians in the town of São Salvador. The killings at Maquela occurred after some mercenary recruits had mistakenly opened fire on their colleagues and, fearing retribution by Georgiou and the MPLA, had subsequently fled towards Zaire, taking all the unit&#x27;s supplies.

Georgiou was convicted and sentenced to death. President Agostinho Neto rejected pleas for mercy from Queen Elizabeth II on behalf of Georgiou and three other condemned British mercenaries. Georgiou was executed by firing squad on 10 July 1976. His sister, Panayiota &#x27;Blondie&#x27; Georgiades, was allowed to visit him during his captivity in Angola. In a BBC interview, she said they spoke mainly about their family and the trial proceedings, conversing in Greek. Georgiou&#x27;s body was repatriated to England, and he was buried secretly in a cemetery in north London in accordance with the rites of the Greek Orthodox Church.

<text>Rona Anderson (3 August 1926 – 23 July 2013) was a Scottish stage, film, and television actress. She appeared in TV series and on the stage and films throughout the 1950s. She appeared in the films &quot;Scrooge&quot; and &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; and on TV in &quot;Dr Finlay&#x27;s Casebook&quot; and &quot;Dixon of Dock Green&quot;.

==Biography==
Rona Anderson was born in Edinburgh to James and Evelyn (née Thomson) Anderson. She was educated in her home town and briefly in Ottawa during the war. She trained for the stage at the Glover Turner-Robertson School in Edinburgh.

In 1951, she married fellow actor Gordon Jackson, with whom she had appeared in &quot;Floodtide&quot; (1949) and remained with him until his death from bone cancer on 15 January 1990.

==Stage work==
Anderson had an English accent despite being brought up in Scotland. She made her first appearance on the stage at the Garrison Theatre in April 1945 in a production of &quot;Peg o&#x27; My Heart&quot;. From 1945 through 1949, she played various parts with the Glasgow Citizens Theatre. At the 1950 Edinburgh Festival, Anderson played the role of Venus in a production of &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Comedy&quot;. She made her London debut in October 1951 at the Piccadilly Theatre in &quot;The White Sheep of the Family&quot;. Anderson went on two tours in 1955. In March of that year, she toured as Sabrina in &quot;Sabrina Fair&quot;. In September 1955, she toured as Mary in &quot;All for Mary&quot;.

In October 1958, she played Mary Tufnell in &quot;Once a Rake&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. Anderson appeared in the premier of &quot;Savages&quot; in 1973. She appeared at the Mermaid Theatre in their 1978 production of &quot;Whose Life Is It Anyway?&quot;, which transferred to the Savoy Theatre. In 1981, she played Frances Shand Kydd in the Ray Cooney comedy, &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; at the Palace Theatre, London starring Marc Sinden.

==Film career==

Rona Anderson&#x27;s first major film was the drama &quot;Sleeping Car to Trieste&quot; (1948) directed by John Paddy Carstairs. Anderson played the role of Alice (originally named &quot;Belle&quot; by Dickens) in &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1951), a film adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. She appeared alongside Lee Patterson in &quot;Man with a Gun&quot; (1958), directed by Montgomery Tully, while her last major film appearance was in &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; (1969). Following this film she continued her work on the stage and in television series.

From 1953 until 1983, Anderson appeared in several British television programmes. She appeared in three episodes of &quot;The Human Jungle&quot; (1964–1965) during its second season. Anderson played the role of Mary on the British sitcom &quot;Bachelor Father&quot; (1970–1971). Anderson later appeared in an episode of the long-running crime series &quot;The Professionals&quot; entitled &quot;Cry Wolf&quot;, in which her husband, Gordon Jackson, played George Cowley.

==Critical assessment==
Of her numerous roles in British B films in the 1950s, the film historians Steve Chibnall and Brian McFarlane wrote: &quot;She was essentially crisp and wholesome, in her open Scots prettiness and brought a proper spirited resourcefulness to these assorted plucky heroines, making them a good deal more endearing and credible than the screenplays deserved.&quot;

==Death==
Anderson died on 23 July 2013, at age 86.

<text>Boris Nikolayevich Delaunay or Delone (; 15 March 1890 – 17 July 1980) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician, mountain climber, and the father of physicist, Nikolai Borisovich Delone. He is best known for the Delaunay triangulation.

==Biography==
Boris Delone got his surname from his ancestor French Army officer de Launay, who was captured in Russia during Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of 1812. De Launay was a nephew of the Bastille governor marquis de Launay. He married a woman from the noble and stayed in Russia.

When Boris was a young boy his family spent summers in the Alps where he learned mountain climbing. By 1913, he became one of the top three Russian mountain climbers. After the Russian Revolution, he climbed mountains in the Caucasus and Altai. One of the mountains (4300 m) near Belukha is named after him. In the 1930s, he was among the first to receive a qualification of Master of mountain climbing of the USSR. Future Nobel laureate in physics Igor Tamm was his associate in setting tourist camps in the mountains.

Boris Delaunay worked in the fields of modern algebra, the geometry of numbers. He used the results of Evgraf Fedorov, Hermann Minkowski, Georgy Voronoy, and others in his development of modern mathematical crystallography and general mathematical model of crystals. He invented what is now called Delaunay triangulation in 1934; Delone sets are also named after him. Among his best students are the mathematicians Aleksandr Aleksandrov and Igor Shafarevich.

Delaunay was elected the corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union in 1929. Delaunay is credited as being an organizer, in Leningrad in 1934, of the first mathematical olympiad for high school students in the Soviet Union.

<text>In road bicycle racing, a Grand Tour is one of the three major European professional cycling stage races: Giro d&#x27;Italia, Tour de France, and Vuelta a España. Collectively they are termed the &quot;Grand Tours&quot;, and all three races are similar in format, being three-week races with daily stages. They have a special status in the UCI regulations: more points for the UCI World Tour are distributed in Grand Tours than in other races, and they are the only stage races allowed to last longer than 14 days, and these differ from major stage races more than one week in duration.

All three races have a substantial history, with the Tour de France first held in 1903, Giro d&#x27;Italia first held in 1909 and the Vuelta a España first held in 1935. The Giro is generally run in May, the Tour in July, and the Vuelta in late August and September. The Vuelta was originally held in the spring, usually late April, with a few editions held in June in the 1940s. In 1995, however, the race moved to September to avoid direct competition with the Giro.

The Tour de France is the oldest and most prestigious in terms of points accrued to racers of all three, and is the most widely attended annual sporting event in the world. The Tour, the Giro and the Road World Cycling Championship make up the Triple Crown of Cycling.

The three Grand Tours are men&#x27;s events, and as of 2023, no three week races currently exist on the women&#x27;s road cycling circuit. The Vuelta Femenina, Giro d&#x27;Italia Women and Tour de France Femmes are sometimes considered to be equivalent races for women – taking place over shorter, smaller routes around a week in length. The Vuelta Femenina was first held under that name in 2023, the Giro d&#x27;Italia Women was first held in 1988, and various women&#x27;s Tour de France events have taken place since 1984 – with the Tour de France Femmes having its first edition in 2022.

== Description ==
In their current form, the Grand Tours are held over three consecutive weeks and typically include two rest days near the beginning of the second and third weeks. If the opening stages are in a country not neighbouring the home nation of the race, there is sometimes an additional rest day after the opening weekend to allow for transfers. The stages are a mix of long massed start races (sometimes including mountain and hill climbs and descents; others are flat stages favoring those with a sprint finish) and individual and team time trials. Stages in the Grand Tours are generally under 200 kilometres in length.

=== UCI rules regarding &#x27;Grand Tours&#x27; ===
Grand Tour events have specific rules and criteria as part of Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) regulations. For the UCI World Tour, more points are given in grand tours than in other races; the winner of the Tour de France receives 1000 points, and the winners of the Giro and Vuelta receive 850 points. Depending on the nature of other races, points vary for the winner of the overall classification
The grand tours have a special status for the length: they are allowed to last between 15 and 23 days – whereas other stage races are not allowed to last longer than 14 days.

=== Teams ===
Historically, controversy surrounds which teams are invited to the event by the organiser. Typically, the UCI prefers top-rated professional teams to enter, while operators of the Grand Tours often want teams based in their country or those unlikely to cause controversy. Between 2005 and 2007, organisers had to accept all ProTour teams, leaving only two wildcard teams per Tour. However, the Unibet team, a ProTour team normally guaranteed entry, was banned from the three Grand Tours for violating gambling advertising laws. In 2008, following numerous doping scandals, some teams were refused entry to the Grand Tours: Astana did not compete at the 2008 Tour de France and Team Columbia did not compete at the 2008 Vuelta a España.

Since 2011, under UCI World Tour rules, all eighteen UCI WorldTeams are guaranteed a place in all three events, as well as the top two UCI ProTeams from the previous year&#x27;s world ranking. As of 2025, the race organizers are free to invite two more &quot;wildcard&quot; teams from the top 40 teams in the world ranking (shrinking to the top 30 in 2026). This new rule is intended to prevent organizers from favoring low-ranked domestic teams, such as the 2023 Vuelta a España, where were ranked 62nd and invited over many higher performing teams.

In 2023, riders Primož Roglič, Jonas Vingegaard and Sepp Kuss won the Giro, Tour and Vuelta respectively, making the team the first to win all three Grand Tours in a single calendar year.

=== Competitions ===
The main competition is the individual general classification, decided on aggregate time (sometimes after allowance of time bonuses). There are also classifications for teams and young riders, and based on climbing and sprinting points, and other minor competitions. Five riders have won three individual classifications open to all riders (general, mountains, young and points classifications) in the same race: Eddy Merckx in the 1968 Giro d&#x27;Italia and 1969 Tour de France and 1973 Vuelta a España, Tony Rominger in the 1993 Vuelta a España, Laurent Jalabert in the 1995 Vuelta a España, Marco Pantani in the 1998 Giro d&#x27;Italia, and Tadej Pogačar in the 2020 Tour de France and 2021 Tour de France.

=== Riders ===
It is rare for cyclists to ride all grand tours in the same year; in 2004, 474 cyclists started in at least one of the grand tours, 68 of them rode two Grand Tours and only two cyclists started in all three grand tours. It is not unusual for sprinters to start each of the Grand Tours and aim for stage wins before the most difficult stages occur. Alessandro Petacchi and Mark Cavendish started all three Grand Tours in 2010 and 2011, respectively, as did some of their preferred support riders. For both riders in both years, only the Tour de France was ridden to its conclusion.

Over the years, 36 riders have completed all three Grand Tours in one year: Adam Hansen did so six years in a row. The only riders to have finished in the top 10 in each of the three tours during the same year are Raphaël Géminiani in 1955 and Gastone Nencini in 1957. In 2023 Sepp Kuss became the first rider since Nencini to start and finish all three tours in one year, while winning one of them - in Kuss&#x27; case the 2023 Vuelta a España.

Riders from the same country winning all three Grand Tours in a single year has happened only on four occasions. It first occurred in 1964 with French riders Jacques Anquetil and Raymond Poulidor, with the second occurrence in 2008 with Spanish riders Alberto Contador and Carlos Sastre. 2018 marked the only time three different riders from the same country won all three Tours, these being British riders Chris Froome, Geraint Thomas and Simon Yates. In 2024 Slovenian riders Tadej Pogačar (winning the Giro and the Tour) and Primož Roglič (winning the Vuelta) repeated the accomplishments of the aforementioned French, Spanish and British riders.

On four occasions, each of the three Grand Tours in the same year was won by a home rider, that is, an Italian winning the Giro, a Frenchman winning the Tour and a Spaniard winning the Vuelta. The last occasion this occurred was 1975.

On twenty occasions, none of them in the same year was won by a host.

== Women&#x27;s Grand Tour events ==
, no three week races currently exist on the women&#x27;s road cycling circuit. Historically, women have participated in three week long stages races, with various women&#x27;s Tour de France events taking place since 1984. In the contemporary UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour, the Giro d&#x27;Italia Women (first held in 1988), the Tour de France Femmes (first held in 2022) and the Vuelta Femenina (started in 2015, gaining its current name in 2023) are sometimes considered to be equivalent races for women – taking place over shorter, smaller routes around a week in length.&quot; &quot;The Vuelta Femenina takes place in May, the Giro d&#x27;Italia Women is generally run in late June / early July and the Tour de France Femmes is held in late July following the men&#x27;s Tour de France.

Some media and teams have referred to these women&#x27;s events as Grand Tours, as they are the biggest events in the women&#x27;s calendar. However, they are not three week stage races, they do not have a special status in the rules and regulations of cycling (such as more points in the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour, or allowing an increased number of stages), and some have argued that the races need to visit high mountains (such as the Alps) or contain time trial stages to be considered an equivalent event.

Campaign groups such as Le Tour Entier and The Cyclists&#x27; Alliance continue to push organisers and the UCI to allow for longer stage races for women, as well as to improve the quality and economic stability of the women&#x27;s peloton to allow for three week long races in future.

== General Classification winners ==
=== Wins per year ===

A.  Lance Armstrong was declared the winner of seven consecutive Tours from 1999 to 2005. However, on 22 October 2012, he was stripped of all his titles by the UCI for his use of performance-enhancing drugs. The organizers of the Tour de France announced that the winner&#x27;s slot would remain empty in the record books, rather than transfer the win to the second-place finishers each year.

=== Wins per rider ===

*Active riders marked in bold.

=== Wins by country ===
=== All three wins in the same year by one country ===
=== All three wins in the same year by a home rider ===
=== Winners of all three Grand Tours ===
Seven cyclists have won all three of the Grand Tours during their career:

Hinault and Contador are the only cyclists to have won each Grand Tour at least twice.

=== Winners of three or more consecutive Grand Tours ===

* Fausto Coppi: 3 Grand Tours – Giro (1952), Tour (1952), Giro (1953).
* Eddy Merckx: 4 Grand Tours – Giro (1972), Tour (1972), Vuelta (1973), Giro (1973).
* Bernard Hinault: 3 Grand Tours – Giro (1982), Tour (1982), Vuelta (1983).
* Chris Froome: 3 Grand Tours – Tour (2017), Vuelta (2017), Giro (2018).

=== Winners of multiple Grand Tours in a single year ===
No rider has won all three Grand Tours in a single year in any classification (general, points, mountain, young rider). Few riders have even finished all three in a single year; of those who have, two finished in the top ten in each: Raphaël Géminiani (4th, 6th and 3rd in the Giro, Tour and Vuelta in 1955) and Gastone Nencini (1st, 6th and 9th in 1957).

Eleven riders have achieved a double by winning two grand tours in the same calendar year.




Of the above eleven, Pantani, Roche and Battaglin&#x27;s doubles were their only Grand Tour victories in their careers.

Merckx, Roche and Pogacar also won the men&#x27;s road race at the World Championship in the same year as their Giro-Tour double to complete the Triple Crown of Cycling.

=== Smallest margin between 1st and 2nd placed rider ===

The margins between the winner of a Grand Tour and the runner-up are often narrow, and rarely larger than a few minutes.

As of 2021, there have been 54 Grand Tours with a winning margin less than one minute. The smallest margins are as follows:

The biggest winning margin in a Grand Tour was 2h 59&#x27; 21&quot; in Maurice Garin&#x27;s win at the first Tour de France in 1903. The biggest margin in the history of Giro d&#x27;Italia was in 1914 when Alfonso Calzolari won by 1h 57&#x27; 26&quot;, and the biggest margin in the history of Vuelta a España was in 1945 when Delio Rodríguez finished 30&#x27; 08&quot; clear.

===Days leading classification===
In previous tours, sometimes a stage was broken in two (or three). &quot;Days&quot; column gives the number of times the cyclist was a classification leader at the end of the day. Numbers in brackets include split stages.

&quot;after the end of 2024 Vuelta a España&quot;


Sixteen other cyclists have led the overall standings in all three Grand Tours during their careers. No rider has done so in a single season.

Tadej Pogačar amassed most Grand Tour days at the top of the classification in a single calendar year - 39 in 2024.

== Points classification winners ==
The Tour/Giro/Vuelta triple has been achieved by five riders – Djamolidine Abdoujaparov, Mark Cavendish, Laurent Jalabert, Eddy Merckx and Alessandro Petacchi.

== Mountains classification winners ==
The Tour/Giro/Vuelta triple has been achieved by two riders – Federico Bahamontes and Luis Herrera.

== Young rider classification winners ==
The Tour/Giro double has been achieved by three riders – Egan Bernal, Nairo Quintana and Andy Schleck. The Giro/Vuelta double has been achieved by one rider – Miguel Ángel López. The Tour/Vuelta double has been achieved by two riders – Tadej Pogačar and Remco Evenepoel.

== Grand Tour stage wins per rider==
Three cyclists have won stages in all three of the Grand Tours in the same season: Miguel Poblet in 1956, Pierino Baffi in 1958 and Alessandro Petacchi in 2003. The rider with the most Grand Tour stage wins in one season is Freddy Maertens who won 20 stages in 1977: 13 in the Vuelta a España and 7 in the Giro d&#x27;Italia.

:Cyclists whose names are in bold are still active.
:This list is complete up to and including the 2024 Vuelta a España.
a Not counting the two-man team time trial Prologue win in 1973 Giro.

b Not counting the TTT/ITT combined format &quot;Preface&quot; win in 1988 Tour.

== Grand Tour stage wins per country ==

Riders representing 42 countries have won at least one stage in Grand Tours.


==Grand Tour finishers==

Only 36 riders have finished all three Grand Tours in one season. Adam Hansen has done this six times consecutively, Marino Lejarreta four times and Bernardo Ruiz achieved it in three different years, while Eduardo Chozas and Carlos Sastre have completed the accomplishment twice.

The rider with most participations on Grand Tours is Matteo Tosatto with 34 (12 Tours, 13 Giros and 9 Vueltas). The rider who has finished most Grand Tours is also Matteo Tosatto, with 28 (12 Tours, 11 Giros and 5 Vueltas). Adam Hansen has finished the most consecutive Grand Tours: 20 tours from 2011 Vuelta a España till 2018 Giro d&#x27;Italia. Bernardo Ruiz was the first rider to ride every tour of a season on three occasions which he completed in 1957. Marino Lejarreta completed every grand tour of the season for the 4th time in 1991 and of these 12 tours he finished in the top 10 of eight of them. His record of 4 was not passed until Adam Hansen completed the Vuelta in 2016.

Gastone Nencini (1957) and Sepp Kuss (2023) are the only cyclists to both ride all three Grand Tours and win one in the same season. The best average finish was the first time three Grand Tours were finished in one season, when Raphaël Géminiani finished 4th, 6th and 3rd in the Giro, Tour and Vuelta, respectively.

<text>The Siskins, officially the Siskin Exhibition Flight, were a Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) aerobatic flying team that was established in 1929 at Camp Borden, Ontario. They were named after the bird family Siskin. It was the air force&#x27;s first official aerobatic team. Flying three Armstrong Whitworth Siskin biplanes, the Siskins quickly built a reputation for performing daring maneuvers. The Siskins flew more than 100 air shows over three years before being disbanded in 1932 when the Great Depression forced the RCAF to reduce operations.

Siskins&#x27; Squadron Leader E.A. McNab would later earn recognition as the first RCAF pilot to win the Distinguished Flying Cross during the Second World War.

<text>Johannes Sleidanus or Sleidan (1506 – 31 October 1556) was a Luxembourgish historian and annalist of the Reformation.

==Life==

He was born at Schleiden in the Duchy of Luxembourg, then part of the Habsburg Netherlands. He studied humanities at Leuven University and Cologne University, and law and jurisprudence at Paris and Orléans.

While among the Renaissance humanists of Leuven, he had adopted Protestant opinions, and entering the service of Cardinal du Bellay, was employed in the futile negotiations of the French court to make an alliance with the German Protestants against the Emperor Charles V. In 1542 he settled in Strasbourg.

Sleidanus had been accustomed to copy all papers bearing upon the Reformation to which he had access, and Martin Bucer, who had seen his collection, proposed to Philip of Hesse to appoint him historian of the Reformation, giving him a salary and access to all necessary documents. After some delay the heads of the league of Schmalkalden agreed to the proposal, and Sleidanus began his great work, finishing the first volume in 1545.

In that year he was recalled to diplomacy, and went to England in a French embassy to Henry VIII. While there he collected materials for his history. On his return he represented Strasbourg at the diets of Frankfurt and Worms, and went on to Marburg to explore the archives of Philip of Hesse.

The war of the league of Schmalkalden interfered with this work, and also prevented the payment of Sleidanus, who in his difficulties applied to England for aid, and at Cranmer&#x27;s intercession received a yearly pension from Edward VI, which, however, was never paid out.

In 1551 Sleidanus went to the Council of Trent as representative from Strasbourg, charged also with full powers to act for the imperial cities of Esslingen, Ravensburg, Reutlingen, Biberach and Lindau. Soon afterwards he became a civil servant of the city of Strasbourg, and finished his great task in 1554, though lack of money and other misfortunes compelled him to delay printing. Sleidanus died in poverty at Strasbourg in October 1556.

The book appeared in the preceding year, &quot;Commentariorum de statu religionis et reipublicae&quot;, Carolo V. Caesare, libri XXVI.; it was translated into English by John Daus in 1560 and by G. Bohun in 1689. It was drafted with some care for impartiality, but this approach pleased no one, not even Melanchthon. It remains a valuable contemporary history of the times of the Reformation, and contains a large collection of documents.

== Posthumous ==

A street in the Neustadt district of Strasbourg is named after him (&quot;Rue Sleidan&quot;).

<text>In group theory, the correspondence theorem (also the lattice theorem, and variously and ambiguously the [[Correspondence theorem|third]] and [[Correspondence theorem|fourth isomorphism theorem]]) states that if formula_1 is a normal subgroup of a group formula_2, then there exists a bijection from the set of all subgroups formula_3 of formula_2 containing formula_1, onto the set of all subgroups of the quotient group formula_6. Loosely speaking, the structure of the subgroups of formula_6 is exactly the same as the structure of the subgroups of formula_2 containing formula_1, with formula_1 collapsed to the identity element.

Specifically, if 
: &quot;G&quot; is a group, 
: formula_11, a normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;, 
: formula_12, the set of all subgroups &quot;A&quot; of &quot;G&quot; that contain &quot;N&quot;, and 
: formula_13, the set of all subgroups of &quot;G&quot;/&quot;N&quot;, 

then there is a bijective map formula_14 such that
: formula_15 for all formula_16

One further has that if &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are in formula_17 then
* formula_18 if and only if formula_19;
* if formula_18 then formula_21, where formula_22 is the index of &quot;A&quot; in &quot;B&quot; (the number of cosets &quot;bA&quot; of &quot;A&quot; in &quot;B&quot;);
* formula_23 where formula_24 is the subgroup of formula_2 generated by formula_26
* formula_27, and 
* formula_3 is a normal subgroup of formula_2 if and only if formula_30 is a normal subgroup of formula_6.

This list is far from exhaustive. In fact, most properties of subgroups are preserved in their images under the bijection onto subgroups of a quotient group.

More generally, there is a monotone Galois connection formula_32 between the lattice of subgroups of formula_2 (not necessarily containing formula_1) and the lattice of subgroups of formula_6: the lower adjoint of a subgroup formula_36 of formula_2 is given by formula_38 and the upper adjoint of a subgroup formula_39 of formula_6 is a given by formula_41. The associated closure operator on subgroups of formula_2 is formula_43; the associated kernel operator on subgroups of formula_6 is the identity. A proof of the correspondence theorem can be found here.
Similar results hold for rings, modules, vector spaces, and algebras. More generally an analogous result that concerns congruence relations instead of normal subgroups holds for any algebraic structure.

<text>Comfort food is food that provides a nostalgic or sentimental value to someone and may be characterized by its high caloric nature associated with childhood or home cooking. The nostalgia may be specific to an individual or it may apply to a specific culture.

==Definition and history==
The term &quot;comfort food&quot; can be traced back at least to 1615, where in the beginning of the second part of Don Quixote, at the beginning of chapter one, Quixote&#x27;s niece and her nurse (governess, housekeeper?, &quot;ama&quot;) are told to pamper him, &quot;to give him things to eat which are comforting and appropriate for the heart and the brain... .&quot; Others trace it back to 1966, when the &quot;Palm Beach Post&quot; used it in a story: &quot;Adults, when under severe emotional stress, turn to what could be called &#x27;comfort food&#x27;—food associated with the security of childhood, like mother&#x27;s poached egg or famous chicken soup.&quot; According to research by April White at JSTOR, it might have been Liza Minnelli who used the term for the first time in its modern meaning in an interview, admitting to craving a hamburger.

When the term first appeared, newspapers used it in quotation marks. In the 1970s, the most popular comfort food in the United States were various potato dishes and chicken soup, but even at the time, the definition varied from person to person. During the next decades, the nature of comfort food changed in the US, shifting from savory dishes to sweet ones, while comfort food themed cookbooks started to spread and restaurants started to offer items labelled as such, when originally the term was used for food items consumed &quot;home alone&quot;. Worldwide diet trends, emerging in the 1990s, like the low fat or the low-carb diet were unable to end the cravings for comfort food. Also in the 1990s the emergence of mass-produced food emerged which reshaped the idea of comfort food. The ability to produce and preserve food, such as canned goods, meant that comfort food became more available to those needed an extra reminder of home. For example those who were far away or under difficult conditions particularly war. According to White, the COVID-19 pandemic that hit the world in 2020 further strengthened people&#x27;s need for comfort food that evokes nostalgia and the feeling of belonging.

==Psychological studies==
Consuming energy-dense, high calorie, high fat, salt or sugar foods, such as ice cream or french fries, may trigger the reward system in the human brain, which gives a distinctive pleasure or temporary sense of emotional elevation and relaxation. These feelings can also be induced by psychoactive ingredients found in other foods, such as coffee and chocolate. When psychological conditions are present, people often use comfort food to treat themselves. Those with negative emotions tend to eat unhealthy food in an effort to experience the instant gratification that comes with it, even if only short-lived.

One study divided college-students&#x27; comfort-food identifications into four categories (nostalgic foods, indulgence foods, convenience foods, and physical comfort foods) with a special emphasis on the deliberate selection of particular foods to modify mood or affect, and indications that the medical-therapeutic use of particular foods may ultimately be a matter of mood-alteration.

The identification of particular items as comfort food may be idiosyncratic, though patterns are detectable. In one study of American preferences, &quot;males preferred warm, hearty, meal-related comfort foods (such as steak, casseroles, and soup) while females instead preferred comfort foods that were more snack related (such as chocolate and ice cream). In addition, younger people preferred more snack-related comfort foods compared to those over 55 years of age.&quot; The study also revealed strong connections between consumption of comfort foods and feelings of guilt.

Comfort food consumption is seen as a response to emotional stress and, consequently, as a key contributor to the epidemic of obesity in the United States. The provocation of specific hormonal responses leading selectively to increases in abdominal fat is seen as a form of self-medication.

Further studies suggest that consumption of comfort food is triggered in men by positive emotions, and by negative ones in women. The stress effect is particularly pronounced among college-aged women, with only 33% reporting healthy eating choices during times of emotional stress. For women specifically, these psychological patterns may be maladaptive.

A therapeutic use of these findings includes offering comfort foods or &quot;happy hour&quot; beverages to anorectic geriatric patients whose health and quality of life otherwise decreases with reduced oral intake.

Comfort foods provide emotional nutrition in the form of familiar tastes and a sense of security in stressful situations, but when taken in large quantities these foods become addictive and impair a person from engaging in new experiences or meeting challenges head-on. A reliance on comfort foods can stifle growth and transition, since the comfort foods are overused during times of transition and distress. The foods that people over-consume during stress periods leads to a state of emotional inertia where people may become resistant to necessary change or adaptation. This reliance on experience rather than interaction with present or upcoming situations eventually stifles the ability to thrive in fluid situations and inhibits the potential for personal growth.

===Indonesia===
Some popular Indonesian foods are considered to be comfort food, usually served hot or warm, and either soupy or with a soft texture. Most of them are high in carbs or fat, such as congee, fried rice, and noodles which are high in carbs; while meatballs and grilled skewered meats contain fair amounts of fat and salt. Comfort foods often are the kind of food that provides nostalgic sentiments, as they often called &quot;masakan rumahan&quot; (home cooking) or &quot;masakan ibu&quot; (mother&#x27;s dishes). In Indonesia, the warm and soft texture of bubur ayam is believed to help people to recover during convalescence. Sayur sop or sup ayam is Indonesian chicken soup that often sought during flu. The warm soup contains chunk of chicken, bits of potato, carrot, and common green bean served in chicken stock.

Some Indonesian comfort foods are traditional Indonesian food and some are derived from Chinese influences. 
*Bakmi or mie ayam – noodles (&quot;mi&quot;) with pork (&quot;bak&quot;) or chicken (&quot;ayam&quot;)

Indonesian comfort foods include:
*Bakso – meatball soup
*Bubur ayam – chicken congee
*Gado-gado – salad containing vegetables, tempeh and egg in peanut sauce
*Indomie Mi goreng – fried noodle

For some Indonesians, especially those who are abroad, comfort food may include a favourite brand or type of Indonesian instant noodles, such as Indomie Mi goreng mentioned already.
*Nasi goreng – fried rice
*Nasi tim – steamed chicken rice
*Sayur sop or sup ayam – Indonesian chicken and vegetables soup

<doc id="1286866" wikidata="Q914124" url="?curid=1286866" title="Warrego Highway">
<text>The Warrego Highway is located in southern Queensland, Australia. It connects coastal centres to the south western areas of the state, and is approximately 715 km in length. It takes its name from the Warrego River, which is the endpoint of the highway. The entire highway is part of the National Highway system linking Darwin and Brisbane: formerly National Highway 54, Queensland began to convert to the alphanumeric system much of Australia had adopted in the early-2000s and this road is now designated as National Highway A2.

==State-controlled road==

Warrego Highway is a state-controlled road, divided into seven sections for administrative and funding purposes. Six of the seven sections (numbers 18A to 18F) are part of the National Highway, while section 18G is a regional road. The sections are:
* 18A – Ipswich to Toowoomba
* 18B – Toowoomba to Dalby
* 18C – Dalby to Miles
* 18D – Miles to Roma
* 18E – Roma to Mitchell
* 18F – Mitchell to Morven
* 18G – Morven to Charleville

State-controlled roads that intersect with the highway are listed in the main article.

==Route description==
The highway commences at the end of the M2 Ipswich Motorway, near Ipswich and runs to Helidon Spa, at the foot of the Great Dividing Range. From there it follows the Toowoomba Bypass to Charlton, west of Toowoomba. The Warrego then crosses the Darling Downs, bypassing the town of Oakey and then passing through the towns of Dalby, Chinchilla and Miles, in the Western Downs. The highway continues through the towns of Roma and Mitchell in the Maranoa Region of South West Queensland. After Morven, the A2 Route continues north–west along the Landsborough Highway, with the western turnoff continuing the Warrego Highway down to its terminus at Charleville.

The section of highway between Ipswich and Charlton is mostly motorway grade; a four lane divided highway with motorway-style on-ramps and off-ramps. At a point between Charlton and Oakey the highway merges from 4 to 2 lanes (however, throughout 2017–2019, the highway was planned to be duplicated up until Oakey) Then, the highway mostly continues in a straight line with minimal turns. At Dalby, the highway briefly returns to 4 lanes (where a longer stretch of the highway was planned to be duplicated in 2017). The Warrego then continues as a rural 2 lane highway, until Charleville.

===Terrain===
The Warrego Highway&#x27;s lowest point along its length is 3.69 m just east of where it crosses the Bremer River near Ipswich, and its highest elevation is at the top of the Great Dividing Range on the Toowoomba Bypass.

===Speed zones===
*Ipswich Motorway – Blacksoil 100 km/h
*Blacksoil – Toowoomba Bypass merge 100 km/h, with a drop to 80 km/h and/or 60 km/h through some towns
*Great Dividing Range (Toowoomba Bypass to Charlton) 80 km/h to 100 km/h
*Charlton – Kingsthorpe 90 km/h
*Kingsthorpe – Dalby 100 km/h except through Jondaryan, which is 80 km/h.
*Dalby – 60 km/h
*Dalby – Chinchilla 100 km/h except running through towns, which speeds can drop to 60 km/h
*Chinchilla – Charleville 110 km/h except running through towns, which speeds can drop to 60 km/h

===Towns along the route===
From east to west, the highway passes through or close to the cities and major towns of:
* Ipswich (Bypassed)
* Gatton (Bypassed)
* Toowoomba (Bypassed)
* Oakey (Bypassed)
* Dalby
* Chinchilla

==History==
In January 2011, the former highway was extensively damaged where it crossed the Toowoomba Range. This included land slips, shoulder and embankment erosion, the erosion of drains and damaged rock fall netting. The road wasn&#x27;t fully repaired with all four lanes open until September 2011.

The Toowoomba Bypass was completed in September 2019 and bypasses the urban area of Toowoomba and provides a better crossing of the Great Dividing Range. Warrego Highway (A2) was rerouted via the bypass between Helidon Spa (in the east) and the interchange at Charlton (in the west). The bypass continues as the Gore Highway (A39) and is 41 km in length. The original section of Warrego Highway through Toowoomba was renamed Toowoomba Connection Road (A21).

==Major works==
* 1957 – Helidon bypass. New road built to bypass Helidon including a steel and concrete bridge over Lockyer Creek opened by the end of June 1957.
* 1959 – Ipswich bypass. New 8 mile long bypass including a steel and concrete bridge over the Bremer River built to bypass Ipswich City, shortening the highway by 2 miles. Also completed this year was the first bridge over Laidley Creek at Crowley Vale.

<doc id="1286867" wikidata="Q1565299" url="?curid=1286867" title="HMS Royal Sovereign (1786)">
<text>HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was a 100-gun first-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy, which served as the flagship of Admiral Collingwood at the Battle of Trafalgar. She was the third of seven Royal Navy ships to bear the name. She was launched at Plymouth Dockyard on 11 September 1786, at a cost of £67,458, and was the only ship built to her design. Because of the high number of Northumbrians on board the crew were known as the Tars of the Tyne.

==Construction==
&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was a 100-gun first rate ship of the line, designed by the John Williams (Surveyor of the Navy) in 1772.

&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was ordered on 3 February 1772 to be built at Plymouth Dockyard by the Master Shipwright Thomas Pollard. The long nature of her construction meant that the master shipwright changed twice, with Pownoll being replaced by John Henslow in February 1775, and Henslow in turn handing over to Thomas Pollard in November 1784. She was laid down on 7 January 1774 and launched on 11 September 1786 with the following dimensions: along the gun deck, at the keel, with a beam of and a depth in the hold of . She measured 2,175 tons burthen. The fitting out process for &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was completed in September 1787, but she was still only partly fitted for sea.

==In service==
&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was part of Admiral Howe&#x27;s fleet at the Glorious First of June, where she suffered 14 killed and 41 wounded.

On 16 June 1795, as the flagship of Vice-Admiral William Cornwallis, she was involved in the celebrated episode known as &#x27;Cornwallis&#x27; Retreat&#x27;.

On 17 March 1796 the transport ship collided with her and sank. &quot;Belisarius&quot;, Barge, master, was carrying troops and their dependents to the West Indies. Barge and about 110 persons were saved.

A witness on wrote in a letter to &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper that the accident was &quot;occasioned by a dispute between the Master and the second Mate [of the Bellisarius] when wearing ship; by which, not paying proper attention, they fell athwart the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, when the Sovereign&#x27;s gib-boom and bowsprit took their main-mast, and struck her amid ship, by which she almost instantly sunk. To add to the distress of this dreadful scene, an unhappy woman, with her infant in her arms, who stood on the quarter-deck of the Bellisarius, attempted to save the life of her infant by throwing it on board the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; at the instant of the two ships meeting, but unfortunately it fell between the two ships sides, and was crushed to atoms before the eyes of its unhappy mother, who, in her distraction of mind, instantly precipitated herself into the sea, and shared the grave of her child.&quot;

She arrived at Gibraltar, under command of Capt. Malcome, on 20 February 1804 after an 8 day voyage from off Ushant.

==Trafalgar==
Under Admiral Collingwood she was the first ship of the fleet in action at Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, she led one column of warships; Nelson&#x27;s led the other. Due to the re-coppering of her hull prior to her arrival off Cádiz, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was a considerably better sailer in the light winds present that day than other vessels, and pulled well ahead of the rest of the fleet. As she cut the enemy line alone and engaged the Spanish three decker , Nelson pointed to her and said, &#x27;See how that noble fellow Collingwood carries his ship into action!&#x27; At approximately the same moment, Collingwood remarked to his captain, Edward Rotheram, &#x27;What would Nelson give to be here?&#x27;

&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and &quot;Santa Ana&quot; duelled for much of the battle, with &quot;Santa Ana&quot; taking fire from fresh British ships passing through the line, including and , while nearby French and Spanish vessels fired on &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;. &quot;Santa Ana&quot; suffered casualties numbering 238 dead and wounded after battling &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and . &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; lost her mizzen and mainmasts, her foremast was badly damaged and much of her rigging was shot away. At about 2.20 pm &quot;Santa Ana&quot; finally struck her colours to &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;.

Shortly afterwards a boat came from &quot;Victory&quot; carrying Lieutenant Hill, who reported that Nelson had been wounded. Realising that he might have to take command of the rest of the fleet and with his ship according to his report being &quot;perfectly unmanageable&quot;, by 3 pm he signalled for the frigate to take &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; in tow. &quot;Euryalus&quot; towed her round to support the rest of the British ships with her port-side guns, and became engaged with combined fleet&#x27;s van under Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, as it came about to support the collapsing centre. Fire from the lead ships shot away the cable between &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and &quot;Euryalus&quot;, and the latter ship made off towards &quot;Victory&quot;. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; exchanged fire with the arriving ships, until Collingwood rallied several relatively undamaged British ships around &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, and Dumanoir gave up any attempt to recover some of the prizes, and made his escape at 4.30pm.

At 4.40 pm one of &quot;Victory&quot;″s boats, carrying Captain Henry Blackwood and Lieutenant Hill, came alongside and Blackwood reported Nelson&#x27;s death to Collingwood. This left Collingwood in command of the fleet, and with a storm rising, and disregarding Nelson&#x27;s final order to bring the fleet to anchor, Collingwood ordered Blackwood to hoist the signal to all ships to come to the wind on the starboard tack, and to take disabled and captured ships in tow. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was by now almost or totally unmanageable and virtually uninhabitable. As she had most of her masts shot away she could not make signals. Having his ship too much disabled by enemy fire at just before of 6 pm Collingwood, had to transfer himself and his flag to the frigate &quot;Euryalus&quot;, while &quot;Euryalus&quot; sent a cable across and took &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; in tow for second time. At the end of the action Collingwood signalled from the frigate to the rest of the fleet to prepare to anchor. took over the tow on 22 October, and was replaced by on 23 October.
&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; had lost one lieutenant, her master, one lieutenant of marines, two midshipman, 29 seamen, and 13 marines killed, along with two lieutenants, one lieutenant of marines, one master&#x27;s mate, four midshipman, her boatswain, 69 seamen, and 16 marines wounded.

==After Trafalgar==
&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; returned to duty in the Mediterranean the next year and remained on the blockade of Toulon until November 1811, when she was ordered to return home to the Channel Fleet. In 1812 and 1813 she was under the command of Rear Admiral James Bissett serving under Admiral Keith.

She was credited with the capture on 5 August 1812 of the American ship &quot;Asia&quot;, of 251 tons, which had been sailing from St. Mary&#x27;s to Plymouth with a cargo of timber. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; shared the proceeds of the capture with all the vessels in Keith&#x27;s squadron, suggesting that what happened was that &quot;Asia&quot; sailed into Plymouth unaware that the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States had broken out and was seized as she arrived, the formal credit going to the flagship.

==Fate==

After her useful active life she was converted to harbour service as a receiving ship at Plymouth before being renamed HMS &quot;Captain&quot; on 17 August 1825. Hulked in June 1826, &quot;Captain&quot; was finally broken up at Plymouth, with work being completed on 28 August 1841. Four of her guns were saved and are incorporated in the Collingwood Monument in Tynemouth.

<text>William Fitzalan, 9th Earl of Arundel, 6th Baron Maltravers (23 November 1417 – 1487) was an English nobleman.

Born on 23 November 1417, William was the second son of John Fitzalan, 6th Earl of Arundel (1385–1421), and Eleanor Berkeley (d. 1455), daughter of John Berkeley of Beverston.

His elder brother John Fitzalan, 7th Earl of Arundel, died on 12 June 1435. The title passed to William&#x27;s nephew Humphrey Fitzalan, 8th Earl of Arundel, who was only a six-year-old with no descendants. William thus became the heir presumptive and, when Humphrey died three years later on 24 April 1438, he succeeded to the title.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Joan Neville, eldest daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and Alice Montagu, &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Salisbury. Alice was a daughter of Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury, and Eleanor Holland. Eleanor was a daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, and Alice FitzAlan. Alice was a daughter of Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, and Eleanor of Lancaster.

William and Joan had five children:
* Thomas Fitzalan, 10th Earl of Arundel (1450–1524).
* William Fitzalan, who had issue.
* George Fitzalan.
* John Fitzalan.
* Mary Fitzalan.

William was summoned to the Great Council of February 1458, (and indeed, he was instructed to stop foot-dragging and attend). He was one of the few nobles to fight first for the House of Lancaster, and then change to supporting the House of York. He fought at the Battle of Ludford Bridge in 1459 for Lancaster, and later fought in the Second Battle of St Albans (17 February 1461) as a supporter of the house of York. The Yorkists were commanded by his brother-in-law Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick.

Edward IV of England named him a Knight of the Garter in 1471, probably in honour of his support during the Wars of the Roses. He was Warden of the Cinque Ports in 1471 and from 1483 to 1487.

<text>The Red Knight was a Canadian air force aerobatic display aircraft that operated from 1958 to 1969. The red-painted Silver Star performed loops, rolls, Cuban 8s, horizontal 360s, inverted flight, and high speed passes at airshows around North America, often appearing as an opening act for or in conjunction with the Golden Hawks display team and later the Golden Centennaires, Canada&#x27;s contemporary aerobatic teams. The Silver Star was replaced by the Tutor in July 1968.

==History==
During its service with the Royal Canadian Air Force (1958–1968) and the Canadian Forces (1968–1969), the Red Knight was flown by seventeen different pilots from four different bases. Beginning in 1961 a second Red Knight aircraft with alternate pilot entered service, and the aircraft sometimes performed together or separately in different locations. An accident involving two Red Knights occurred on August 21, 1963 at the Gimli Air Force Day airshow. When the aircraft were performing a Cuban 8, alternate pilot Flight Lieutenant Wayne MacLellan recognized that he was too low to the ground and aborted the manoeuvre. Lead pilot Flight Lieutenant J.W. &quot;Bud&quot; Morin failed to recognize this and was killed when his plane contacted the ground. An air force investigation allowed the team to continue, but forbade any further coordinated acts.

The Red Knight had five trouble-free years of flying after Morin&#x27;s accident, but that was cut short when pilot Capt. John Reid crashed during a photo shoot on May 22, 1968. After conducting a low-altitude loop, Reid could not pull the aircraft up fast enough and crashed into the ground. Though he was thrown clear of the wreckage, Reid died in hospital. This tragedy was closely followed by another. On July 13, 1969, Red Knight Capt. Bryan Alston was killed when his Tutor suffered a power failure and crashed during the forced landing. These two crashes in short succession led the air force to seriously reconsider the program. Ultimately, because of budget considerations and personnel cuts, the Red Knight program was canceled in 1969.

After its disappearance as a formal demonstration aircraft, the Red Knight was resurrected as a private show in the United States. Between 1990 and 1993, Rick Brickert flew a restored Lockheed T-33 in airshows around the United States and as the pace plane for the Reno Air Races. After Rick&#x27;s death in 1993 when he crashed the Pond Racer experimental aircraft, the T-33 sat unused until acquired by Red Knight Air Shows, LLC in 2003. This company currently operates the T-33 and coordinates appearances at airshows around the continent.

The Jet Aircraft Museum in London, Ontario has restored a Silver Star to flying condition and the aircraft has been painted in the Red Knight paint scheme.

<text>The [[Monte Carlo Casino|Monte Carlo]] Millions was the first ever poker tournament to be staged in the city-state of Monaco. The inaugural event was completed on 12 November 2004. Apparently birthed out of the preceding explosion of Texas Hold &#x27;em popularity, it was conceived of and sponsored by Prima Poker. The field was limited to 80 players and the buy-in was US$14,000. The majority of the competitors were world famous professionals, with the remainder of the field online satellite winners and lesser known professionals.

The 2004 event was dominated nearly start to finish by the world&#x27;s top tournament player, Phil Ivey. With three players remaining, however, he was outdrawn by Jani Sointula, who would go on to take the title and US$400,000 first prize.

In November 2005, the second MCM tourney featured a 120 player field and a $25,000 buyin. It featured the largest prize pool in European History up to that point, $3 million, with $1 million going to the winner. The tournament was notable for offering the last spot at the final table to the winner of a &quot;second chance&quot; tournament with a field consisting of the players eliminated from the main event. Ivey won the 2005 tournament over Paul Jackson. Ivey went on to win a second single table invitational tournament adjunct to the Monte Carlo Millions the next day.

The Monte Carlo Millions has been broadcast in the UK on Pokerzone. In the United States the event aired on Fox Sports Net. In Canada it was broadcast on CGTV (now GameTV).

<doc id="1286892" wikidata="Q608519" url="?curid=1286892" title="Euganei">
<text>The Euganei (fr. Lat. &quot;Euganei&quot;, &quot;Euganeorum&quot;; cf. Gr. &quot;εὐγενής&quot; (eugenēs) &#x27;well-born&#x27;) were a group of populations, difficult to define, settled in the flat and mountainous areas of Northeast Italy, between the Eastern Alps and the Adriatic. With the arrival of the Adriatic Veneti they retreated to the Alpine valleys, blending in with the Rhaetians.

Pliny the Elder, referring to Cato, states that the Euganeans were divided into three lineages, the Triumpilini (Val Trompia), the Camunni (Val Camonica) and the Stoni. All these populations were Romanized before the beginning of the Common Era.

==History==
It has been hypothesized that &quot;Euganei&quot; derives from the Greek εὐγενεῖς (&quot;of noble lineage&quot;), but a connection with Ingauni, a Ligurian population, is also possible. More likely, it is the term with which the Adriatic Venetians referred to a non-homogeneous group of tribes who, at the time of their arrival in Northeast Italy, occupied the vast area from Istria to Garda (or Oglio).

According to what is reported by the well-known legend on the origins of the Adriatic Venetians (handed down from a tragedy by Sophocles and taken up by Livy), it was the latter who drove out the Euganeans who, having retreated to the Alpine valleys, mixed with the Rhaetians; it cannot be ruled out, however, that &quot;Reti&quot; referred to the Euganeans themselves after this migration.

Further pressured by the arrival of the Gauls in the 5th century BC, the Euganean tribes maintained their independence until the end of the 2nd century BC, when Quintus Marcius Rex and Marcus Aemilius Scaurus subjugated the Stoni to Rome; Camuni and Triumpilini were definitively subjugated by Augustus in 16 BC. The Euganeans willingly accepted Roman domination, as demonstrated by the monuments erected in honor of the Augustan dynasty and the existence of a &quot;pagus&quot; called &quot;Livius&quot; by Livia.

According to Pliny, referring to Cato, the Euganeans were distributed in 34 &quot;oppida&quot; among which the &quot;capital&quot; &quot;Stoenos&quot;, an alpine locality which is difficult to identify, stood out. Pliny himself recalls how Verona was a city of Rhaetian and Euganean origin.

==Toponymy==
The literature of the imperial era continued to use the term &quot;Euganean&quot; not as an ethnic one, but as a learned geographical name to indicate Northeast Italy, or as a synonym of &quot;Patavinus&quot;.

The expression &quot;Euganean Hills&quot;, which indicates the group of reliefs located south-west of Padua, is instead an invention of the Renaissance, while &quot;Venezia Euganea&quot;, coined by the linguist Graziadio Isaia Ascoli, is even later.

<doc id="1286893" wikidata="Q757871" url="?curid=1286893" title="Indian Ocean raid">
<text>The Indian Ocean raid, also known as Operation C or Battle of Ceylon in Japanese, was a naval sortie carried out by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) from 31 March to 10 April 1942. Japanese aircraft carriers under Admiral Chūichi Nagumo struck Allied shipping and naval bases around British Ceylon, but failed to locate and destroy the bulk of the British Eastern Fleet. The Eastern Fleet, commanded by Admiral Sir James Somerville, was forewarned by intelligence and sailed from its bases prior to the raid; its attempt to attack the Japanese was frustrated by poor tactical intelligence.

Following the attack, the British expected a major Japanese offensive in the Indian Ocean. The main base of the Eastern Fleet relocated to East Africa, and Ceylon was reinforced, but Somerville kept his fast carrier division, &quot;Force A&quot;, &quot;...in Indian waters, to be ready to deal with any attempt by the enemy to command those waters with light forces only.&quot; However, the Japanese had no short-term plans to follow up on their success, and within the year operations in the Pacific made it impossible to do so.

==Background==
===Strategic situation===
The island of Ceylon was strategically important, since it commanded the Indian Ocean. Thus it controlled access to India, the vital Allied shipping routes to the Middle East and the oilfields of the Persian Gulf. Ceylon held most of the British Empire&#x27;s resources of rubber. An important harbour and naval base, Trincomalee, was located on the island’s eastern coast. Japanese propaganda had an effect on some of the Sinhalese population, who now awaited their arrival.

The fall of Singapore on 15 February 1942 broke the United Kingdom&#x27;s eastern defensive perimeter of the Bay of Bengal; and the Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands on 23 March gave Japan control of the Andaman Sea enabling ships to resupply Japanese troops in the Burma Campaign for control of India. Both German and British authorities anticipated Japanese capture of Ceylon to solidify control of the Bay of Bengal and disrupt British resupply for defence of India, Australia, and perhaps the Middle East. Ceylon was hastily garrisoned by Australian troops returning from North Africa; and was relieved of naval duties to serve as a high-speed aircraft ferry shuttling available planes to Ceylon.

Japanese intentions to mount a major offensive into the Indian Ocean were placed on hold in March 1942; strong naval forces were needed in the western Pacific against the United States, and the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) refused to allocate troops for an invasion of Ceylon. In response, the IJN developed Operation C, a plan for an aggressive raid into the Indian Ocean in early April. Operation C aimed to destroy the British Eastern Fleet, and disrupt British lines of communications in the Bay of Bengal in support of the Burma Campaign.

British intelligence correctly assessed the Japanese strategy. The Americans were notified; the Doolittle Raid – which was already in progress – took on the additional role of a diversion.

===Japanese preparations===
Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto issued the initial order to proceed with Operation C to the IJN&#x27;s southern force, commanded by Admiral Nobutake Kondō, on 9 March 1942. By 16 March, the plan was to depart from Staring Bay, Celebes, on 26 March for an attack on Colombo (&quot;C day&quot;) on 5 April. The Japanese expected to destroy the British Eastern Fleet in port.

The Japanese force, commanded by Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, had a core of five aircraft carriers; , and in Carrier Division 5, and and in Carrier Division 2. The carriers were accompanied by all four s, and both s.

Japanese intelligence on the composition of the British Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean was reasonably accurate, 
while overestimating the air strength on Ceylon. The 19 March operational order vaguely advised that a &quot;considerable&quot; portion of British naval and air forces in the Indian Ocean were &quot;deployed in Ceylon area&quot;.

The Japanese stationed reconnaissance submarines outside of the known British anchorages at Colombo and Trincomalee; their effectiveness was limited. At least one submarine was sent to scout the Maldive Islands but failed to detect Port T at Addu Atoll.

At the same time as Operation C, the IJN also dispatched Malay Force under the command of Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa. His force consisted of the aircraft carrier , six cruisers, and four destroyers to destroy shipping in the Bay of Bengal on 1 April. Malay Force was not part of Operation C.

In 3 days, Ozawa&#x27;s force managed to sink 23 merchant ships (20 in a single day), totaling over 130,000 gross registered tons. In addition, April saw 32,000 tons of shipping sunk by Japanese submarines off India&#x27;s west coast. &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s aircraft also bombed the ports of Cocanada and Vizagapatam, causing relatively minor damage. The tonnage and number of ships sunk by Malay Force, are comparable to that of the 3-month long Operation Berlin raid conducted by two battleships of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; from January to March 1941. In both raids against merchant shipping, Allied merchant ships were not sailing in convoys escorted by large vessels.

===British preparations===

The reinforcement of the British Eastern Fleet depended on transfers from Britain and the Mediterranean, a reflection of active warzones and the demands on the Royal Navy&#x27;s (RN) resources.

In late-December 1941, a reassessment of the threat posed by Japan envisioned transferring the majority of the RN&#x27;s heavy units to the Eastern Fleet. Matters were made urgent by the crippling of the United States Pacific Fleet&#x27;s battle line at Pearl Harbor, which exposed the weak forces in Malaya to attack. Heavy units were freed up by American reinforcements in the Atlantic. The construction programs of the late-1930s were also starting to yield new heavy units. The Mediterranean yielded far fewer reinforcements than expected due to serious losses in that theatre in 1941.

The Eastern Fleet that Vice Admiral Sir James Somerville assumed command of in March 1942 was smaller than what had been envisioned in December 1941. Somerville divided the fleet into two groups, based on speed. The faster &quot;Force A&quot; included the aircraft carriers and , the modernized battleship (as flagship), as well as the modern cruisers and destroyers. The slower &quot;Force B&quot; was formed around the old carrier and four unmodernized s. A few submarines were also available. The ships had never operated together before, and both ship and air crews were deficient in training.

Allied intelligence accurately assessed the strength of the Japanese force. Somerville planned to evade the Japanese during the day and close to launch torpedo strikes with radar-equipped Fairey Albacore bombers during the night. However, the plan was based on information provided by the Far East Combined Bureau (FECB), which identified only two carriers in the Japanese force. FECB also believed the Japanese would sail from Staring Bay on 21 March for a &quot;C day&quot; of 1 April. Thus, Somerville sailed early expecting to fight a smaller and manageable enemy force, particularly in aircraft strength. As such, Somerville likely did not see his plan as incompatible with his orders from the Admiralty, which were to protect the lines of communications in the Indian Ocean, and to maintain the Eastern Fleet as a fleet in being by avoiding unnecessary risks.

The British recognized the threat of Japanese carrier-borne air attack on Ceylon after the strike on Pearl Harbor, and the island&#x27;s air defences were reinforced. On 7 December 1941, air defences consisted of four obsolescent three-inch anti-aircraft guns – at Trincomalee – with neither fighters nor radar. By 4 April, there were 67 Hawker Hurricanes and 44 Fairey Fulmar fighters, a radar station each at Colombo and Trincomalee, and 144 anti-aircraft guns; 37 or 38 Hurricanes were serviceable around Colombo on 5 April. The fighters were divided into three Royal Air Force (RAF) squadrons of Hawker Hurricanes (two at Colombo, and one at Trincomalee), and two squadrons of RN Fleet Air Arm (FAA) Fairey Fulmars. In the same time frame, other air forces increased from eight obsolete torpedo bombers, to seven Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats, 14 Bristol Blenheim IV bombers, and 12 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. On the eve of battle, RAF forces were part of 222 Group, commanded by Air Vice-Marshal John D&#x27;Albiac.

==Raid==

===First moves===

The Japanese sailed from Staring Bay on 26 March as planned.

Somerville sailed on 30 March in expectation of an attack on 1 April, and deployed his fleet in a patrol area south of Ceylon. Ceylon air defences and forces went on alert, with land-based aerial reconnaissance concentrating on the southeast, where the Japanese were expected to approach to launch strikes at Colombo and Trincomalee. Late on 2 April, the British retired toward Port T – southwest of Ceylon – to refuel. Somerville also detached various ships to resume previous commitments; the heavy cruisers and were sent to Colombo, and &quot;Hermes&quot; to Trincomalee. Air defences stood down, although Catalina patrols continued.

At about 16:00 on 4 April, PBY Catalina flying boat (AJ155/QL-A) from the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s (RCAF) 413 Squadron flown by Squadron Leader Leonard Birchall spotted Nagumo&#x27;s fleet south-east of Ceylon on a course that would have entered Somerville&#x27;s previous patrol area from the south. The Catalina transmitted the sighting, but not the size of the fleet, before being shot down. At this time, Somerville was refuelling at Port T; Force A sailed eastward toward the Japanese upon receiving the sighting; Force B could not be ready until 5 April. Catalina FV-R from 205 Squadron RAF took off at 17:45 to shadow the Japanese fleet, making its first report at 22:37 on 4 April, and a final report at 06:15 on 5 April while from Ceylon. FV-R was shot down about 90 minutes after the final report.

Within an hour of QL-A&#x27;s report, D’Albiac met with his subordinates to discuss an anticipated Japanese strike after dawn. 222 Group issued a warning to subordinate units before midnight, and units went on alert at 04:00 on 5 April. On the morning of 5 April, six Swordfish from 788 Naval Air Squadron (788 NAS) began relocating from China Bay, near Trincomalee, to Colombo, in preparation for a strike on the Japanese fleet. Admiral Geoffrey Layton, on Ceylon, ordered ships put to sea to avoid being attacked in harbour. &quot;Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;, which had just reached Colombo, were sent to rejoin Force A; they sailed late on 4 April. &quot;Hermes&quot; sailed from Trincomalee and was ordered to hide northeast of Ceylon.

The Japanese did not perform an aerial reconnaissance sweep along their intended course on the afternoon of 4 April, and a planned reconnaissance of Colombo harbour by cruiser floatplanes was cancelled. The Japanese realized surprise was lost after intercepting a signal from Colombo asking QL-A to repeat its report.

===Attack on Colombo===

Japanese intelligence on the morning of 5 April 1942 indicated that British carriers were absent, and the Japanese morning air search was limited accordingly. At dawn, Japanese aerial reconnaissance aircraft flew off to the south-west and north-west; they would fly out to a maximum of over the next few hours. A reconnaissance Fulmar launched from Force A at 08:00 spotted one of the Japanese aircraft at the extreme edge of the south-west search area at 08:55 about ahead of Force A.

Shortly after 06:00 Nagumo&#x27;s force began launching 91 bombers and 36 fighters for the strike on Colombo. British early warning failed to detect and identify the incoming strike, forcing British pilots to scramble under fire when the first Japanese aircraft appeared over them at 07:45. The effective defence of the Ratmalana airbase by British fighters left the harbour exposed. The armed merchant cruiser , the Norwegian tanker &quot;Soli&quot; and the old destroyer were sunk; three other ships were damaged. The port was damaged but was not put out of action. 20 of the 41 British fighters that took off were destroyed. At least one fighter was damaged and made incapable of flight while attempting to take off. The six Swordfish of 788 NAS arrived during the battle and were shot down. The Japanese lost seven aircraft.

Nagumo changed course to west-southwest at 08:30 – unknowingly causing the opposing fleets to steam toward one another – and recovered the Colombo strike from 09:45 to 10:30.

The size of the airstrike on Colombo was Somerville&#x27;s first concrete evidence that the Japanese force contained more than the two carriers he expected. Nonetheless he continued to steam toward the enemy at 18 knots. Radar-based fighter direction would allow Force A to avoid surprise attack by neutralizing shadowing Japanese aircraft.

===Loss of &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; and &quot;Cornwall&quot;===

At 10:00, an aircraft from &quot;Tone&quot; searching the southwest area spotted and began shadowing &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;&#x27;s force; the aircraft reported that the cruiser was heading southwest and making 24 knots. The cruisers reported the shadower, but had no means to drive it off. Nagumo increased speed from 24 to 28 knots upon receiving the sighting. Carrier Division 5&#x27;s reserve strike force was ordered rearmed with anti-ship torpedoes, replacing the high explosive bombs intended for a second strike on Colombo. The rearming encountered delays, and the strike was carried out by Carrier Division 2 instead; &quot;Soryu&quot; and &quot;Hiryu&quot; began launching dive bombers at 11:45. Force A radar detected the air strike on &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;&#x27;s force at 13:44, putting the aircraft to the northeast. &quot;Cornwall&quot; and &quot;Dorsetshire&quot; were sunk at 1400; ultimately 424 officers and crew were lost.

The Japanese missed an opportunity to find Force A after sinking the cruisers. The aircraft shadowing the cruisers flew another along the cruisers&#x27; course before returning to &quot;Tone&quot;. It would have detected Force A if it had flown southwest another ten minutes.

Nagumo recovered the strike against the cruisers at 14:45.

===Nagumo evades Somerville===
Somerville launched four Albacores from &quot;Indomitable&quot; at 14:00 to search an arc to the northeast out to . Nagumo&#x27;s southeasterly course would have taken the Japanese fleet right through the centre of the arc. However, at 15:00 or 15:30, Nagumo changed course to the southwest. Carrier Division 2 did not immediately follow; it performed a series of kinking manoeuvres starting at 15:00 that initially took it northwest. Carrier Division 2 was spotted by the two northerly Albacores around 16:00. &quot;Hiryū&quot; launched Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters to intercept the scouts; one Albacore was damaged at 16:04, and the other shot down at 16:28 without reporting. The two southernmost Albacores missed Nagumo&#x27;s main body.

Somerville did not receive the damaged Albacore&#x27;s sighting report until 16:55; the report gave the position of Carrier Division 2 with reasonable accuracy, placed the Japanese away, but contained no other data. At 17:00 he received signals intelligence (SIGINT) from Colombo reporting the Japanese course at 14:00 as southwesterly at 24 knots. Somerville ordered a course change to the southwest at 17:26, not knowing that Nagumo&#x27;s main body was away, and that Carrier Division 2 was only away. The course change was presumably to maintain distance between a superior enemy that was believed to be still closing, or to cover Port T from attack, but it also meant the British lost an opportunity to meet the enemy; had Force A continued on its easterly course, Carrier Division 2 would have passed right in front of it at 21:00 at range of about .

The damaged Albacore landed at 17:45, less than a half-hour before sunset, and the crew was debriefed. There were two resulting revisions to the 16:00 sighting, which were transmitted to Somerville at 18:00 and 18:17 respectively, and differed significantly from the other and the original report. The final revision correctly identified the two carriers of Carrier Division 2 – which Somerville likely realized to be only part of the enemy force – but also claimed they were heading toward the northwest at a position or the original sighting. The course heading conflicted with the first revision, which suggested a course toward the southeast. Late on 5 April, FECB decrypted a JN 25B message containing Nagumo&#x27;s planned movement on 6 April, but this did not aid Somerville as the transmission to the fleet was garbled. Somerville declined to launch a strike based on poor information, and opted to head northwest in pursuit. One radar-equipped aircraft was launched to search a northern arc out to . Later, aircraft were sent to search the easterly arc. By this time it was too late to reestablish contact with the Japanese.

For the Japanese, too, there was a lost opportunity to find the British before night fell. Nagumo did not order a search for the British carriers at the appearance of British carrier-based aircraft. Search aircraft might require homing signals from the carriers to return, homing signals which the enemy could use to locate the Japanese. The Japanese continued southeast at 20 knots completely unaware of the presence of Force A. Carrier Division 2 rejoined the main body&#x27;s track at 18:00, and caught up at 22:00 due east of Force A. The Japanese circled wide to the south and then east in preparation for striking Trincomalee. The Japanese suspected the presence of British carriers, and on the morning of 6 April they launched a much denser westward air search, but found nothing. Further searches on route to Trincomalee were equally unsuccessful as the British carriers were by that time far to the west.

By 6 April, British SIGINT indicated the Japanese force contained four carriers and three battleships, a force Somerville clearly realized as beyond the Eastern Fleet&#x27;s capability to engage without undue risk. The declining serviceability of his fighter force also reinforced his caution. Even so, Somerville did not immediately withdraw or return to port. Force B rejoined early on 6 April. In the afternoon 1,122 survivors from &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;&#x27;s force were recovered, while maintaining a look-out for the superior enemy force with all-around air reconnaissance. Intelligence from Ceylon put the Japanese between Port T and Ceylon. Somerville cautiously arrived at Port T from the west at 11:00 on 8 April and refuelled.

===Attack on Trincomalee===
By 8 April, the Eastern Fleet had withdrawn and the Japanese fleet was approaching Trincomalee from the east. The Japanese fleet was detected by a RAF Catalina at 15:17 on 8 April. The harbour at Trincomalee was cleared that night. &quot;Hermes&quot;, escorted by , was sent south along the coast.

The Japanese air search on the morning of 9 April was limited as on 5 April, as British carriers were no longer expected. 

The Japanese strike group of 132 aircraft was detected at 07:06 on 9 April by the radar of AMES 272 at a range of . The defending fighters - 17 Hurricanes and six Fulmars - took off in time, and inflicted the first kills of the battle when a section of Hurricanes attacked three Zeroes and shot down two. The China Bay airbase and the port were heavily bombed. The monitor was damaged. SS &quot;Sagaing&quot;, a merchant ship carrying aircraft and ammunition, was set on fire and abandoned. Eight Hurricanes and a Fulmar were lost, although no serviceable fighters were lost on the ground. The Japanese lost four aircraft.

At 07:16 another Catalina from 413 Squadron RCAF spotted the Japanese fleet, but was shot down while reporting.

===Blenheims attack the Japanese carriers===
Around 10:25, nine unescorted Blenheims from 11 Squadron RAF attacked Nagumo&#x27;s force. They were not detected inbound by the combat air patrol (CAP). &quot;Hiryū&quot; spotted the aircraft but failed to relay a warning to the other ships. As a result, the attack achieved total surprise. The bombers unloaded at on &quot;Akagi&quot;; the bombs fell close to the target with no hits. Four bombers were shot down over the carriers by CAP A6M2 Zeroes (two of which were claimed by Kaname Harada), and another by Japanese aircraft returning from the strike on &quot;Hermes&quot;. In return, a Zero was shot down near the carriers and another in the returning strike. This was the first time a Japanese carrier force had faced a concerted air attack.

===Loss of &quot;Hermes&quot;===

 and were away when Trincomalee was attacked. At 09:00 they reversed course. Shortly after the end of the attack on Trincomalee, an aircraft from spotted the ships. 80 Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; bombers, held in reserve on the Japanese carriers, attacked starting at 10:35. Both were sunk before noon near Batticaloa. &quot;Hermes&quot; was lost with 307 men after being hit by over forty bombs. &quot;Vampire&quot; was lost with 8 men. The nearby hospital ship &quot;Vita&quot; rescued 600 men.

The Japanese attack expanded to nearby ships. The corvette was hit by aircraft from &quot;Soryu&quot; and sunk with 53 men. Also sunk were the naval auxiliary &quot;Athelstone&quot;, the tanker &quot;British Sergeant&quot;, and the cargo ship &quot;Norviken&quot;.

British land-based Fulmars arrived only after &quot;Hermes&quot; was sunk. Two Fulmars and four Vals were destroyed.

Nagumo disengaged after recovering the strike on &quot;Hermes&quot;.

==Aftermath==
===British reaction===
The Japanese inflicted disproportionate damage on the enemy. They damaged port facilities, sank one carrier and two cruisers, destroyed a third of enemy ground-based fighters and nearly all of the enemy ground-based strike aircraft. In addition, 23 merchant ships, totalling 112,312 tons, were sunk, including those by the separate Japanese Malay Force. In return, the Japanese lost only 18 aircraft (six fighters, ten dive-bombers and two high-level bombers), with damage to about 31 more. Conversely, they failed to destroy, or even locate, the main bulk of the British Eastern Fleet.

The British interpreted their position as precarious. Ceylon and the Eastern Fleet were required to safeguard the sea lines of communications through the Indian Ocean. The British expected the Japanese to continue threatening these lines. SIGINT suggested that the Japanese were preparing a deliberate advance across the Indian Ocean. The raid demonstrated that the RAF was too weak to defend Ceylon and the naval anchorages, and that the navy was ill-prepared to meet a Japanese carrier force.

The Eastern Fleet transferred its main base to Kilindini, Kenya in East Africa, temporarily ceding the eastern Indian Ocean to the Japanese; from there it continued contesting control of the central Indian Ocean on better terms. Force A, including its two aircraft carriers, &quot;Indomitable&quot; and &quot;Formidable&quot;, retired to Bombay, and Somerville regularly deployed a fast carrier force to the central Indian Ocean over the next six months, during which he operated from or near Ceylon for nearly half that time. On 18 April, naval planning accorded the Eastern Fleet the highest priority for reinforcement, which also included transferring most of the carriers from the Home Fleet and the Mediterranean, with the intention of returning to Ceylon in September.

By June, Ceylon was defended by three RAF squadrons (64 aircraft, plus reserves), three strike squadrons (including one of Beauforts), and much improved radar and anti-aircraft defences. Ground defences were manned by two Australian army brigades.

The invasion scare was short-lived. British intelligence detected the movement of the Japanese carrier force eastward in mid-April, and their deployment in the Pacific in mid-May. After the Battle of Midway in June, it was realized that there was no longer the threat of major Japanese naval activity in the Indian Ocean. In September, British intelligence predicted Japan would go over to the defensive. As a result, the Eastern Fleet was not reinforced as planned and, instead, shrank after early July.

===Japanese reaction===
The Japanese did not exploit their victory as the British feared. The decision to postpone major operations in the Indian Ocean was upheld. The Japanese aircraft carriers required maintenance and replenishment after months of intensive operations, and there was already difficulty in maintaining the strength of frontline air units. Nagumo and officers such as Mitsuo Fuchida (commanding &quot;Akagi&quot;″s air group) felt that the losses inflicted on the British did not justify the loss of experienced Japanese air crews. Japanese attention also lay elsewhere. In early May, Japanese carriers fought the Battle of the Coral Sea in the southwest Pacific, followed in June by the Battle of Midway. In both cases, losses constrained Japanese options further.

In June, the IJA developed a plan for a major offensive in the Indian Ocean, including an invasion of Ceylon. The Germans were advancing in North Africa, which made an Axis link-up in the Middle East attractive. Resource constraints forced the IJN to reject it, especially once the Guadalcanal Campaign started.

Subsequently, the limit of Japanese operations in the Indian Ocean was against trade using submarines and armed merchant cruisers. Notably, a submarine group patrolling off East Africa attacked the harbour at Diego-Suarez, Madagascar, while the Allies were capturing the island. Ironically, the Allies were motivated by fears that the Japanese might establish a base there to attack trade. Overall, Japanese attacks on trade enjoyed some success, but after 1942 the presence of major Japanese naval units in the Indian Ocean virtually ceased.

===Criticism of Nagumo===
Nagumo&#x27;s leadership has been characterized by Andrew Boyd as rigid and unimaginative, and contributed to the escape of the British Eastern Fleet. The manoeuvring of his fleet was mainly to facilitate strikes on Colombo and Trincomalee; the possibility that the enemy might be at sea was apparently not seriously considered. He failed to appreciate that the direction that &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;″s force was sailing, and the later appearance of British carrier-based aircraft, were related. Furthermore, due to limited aerial reconnaissance, Nagumo had little concrete information of what was around him, especially to his front and exposed flanks. He was not served by the confidence that there was nothing else to be found outside of the few searches made.

The limited air searches conducted at the start of the battle reflected contemporary IJN practice, where the intensity of air searches was scaled according to expected threats. The stronger morning search on 6 April reflected the suspicion that British carriers might be present. The intensity of later air searches dropped off when the British carriers were not found and there was little expectation of encountering them. Ultimately, all navies suffered from inadequate air search planning during this period.

===Problems with Japanese carrier operations===
The raid also provided early examples of problems with Japanese carrier operations. Inadequate aerial reconnaissance failing to locate the enemy fleet in a timely fashion, the difficulty of rearming aircraft for a different mission at short notice, and the penetration of the CAP by enemy aircraft due to the lack of radar-directed fighter control would all recur at the Battle of Midway.

===Criticism of Somerville===
Somerville&#x27;s leadership was characterized by a willingness to take risks, bordering on recklessness.

The initial deployment of the fleet on 30 March endangered the British fleet in multiple ways. Somerville was relying on radar – manned by inexperienced personnel – to locate the enemy and facilitate night strikes. If the Japanese approached as expected from the southeast and the British failed to find the Japanese before dawn, the distance between the two fleets would be no more than ; the British would be detected by Japanese aerial reconnaissance at dawn and be subject to air attack for the entire day. Much the same could have been expected had Somerville still been on station when the Japanese arrived – as they did – from the southwest. Somerville&#x27;s decision to refuel at Port T – rather than on Ceylon – on 2 April allowed the Eastern Fleet to avoid Nagumo a few days later, and likely saved the Eastern Fleet from destruction.

The failure of the Japanese fleet to appear on 1–2 April led Somerville to mistakenly believe that the entirety, rather than a part, of Allied intelligence concerning Operation C was flawed. As a result he detached &quot;Cornwall&quot;, &quot;Dorsetshire&quot;, and &quot;Hermes&quot;, which were subsequently lost after being sent into areas overflown by Japanese aerial reconnaissance.

Andrew Boyd notes:
The disquieted Admiralty broadly agreed.

Somerville faced challenges not experienced by the RN in the Atlantic or Mediterranean. Japanese air superiority made it difficult to scout, close, and attack during the day. Radar-enabled night attack was the only viable offensive option. This was a high-risk strategy. A combination of careful positioning, luck, and Japanese errors nearly produced the preconditions for a strike on the night of 5 April; the enemy was within – 1-hour flight range in an Albacore – but accurate information on the enemy&#x27;s vector was missing. Even then, it required experienced air crews to find their targets at night, using radar with a range of just and new tactics.

<doc id="1286898" wikidata="Q703827" url="?curid=1286898" title="Mitsuharu Misawa">
<text>was a Japanese professional wrestler and promoter. He is primarily known for his 18-year stint with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), and for forming Pro Wrestling Noah in 2000. In the early 1990s, Misawa gained fame alongside Toshiaki Kawada, Kenta Kobashi, and Akira Taue, who came to be nicknamed AJPW&#x27;s &quot;Four Pillars of Heaven&quot;, and whose matches developed the &quot;ōdō&quot; (, &quot;King&#x27;s Road&quot;) style of puroresu and received significant critical acclaim. Despite never working in the United States during the 1990s, Misawa had a significant stylistic influence upon independent wrestling, through the popularity of his work among tape-traders worldwide including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.

Debuting in 1981, Misawa became the second incarnation of the Tiger Mask gimmick in 1984, which he wrestled as, through to the decade&#x27;s end. After the departure of Genichiro Tenryu, Misawa unmasked mid-match in May 1990 and began a rivalry with company ace Jumbo Tsuruta. Misawa&#x27;s victory over Tsuruta on June 8, 1990, led AJPW to sell out every Tokyo event they held into early 1996, and as Tsuruta receded from the main event due to hepatitis, Misawa was cemented as AJPW&#x27;s ace when he won the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship from Stan Hansen in August 1992 and held it for the longest reign in the title&#x27;s history. Misawa remained atop the company throughout the 1990s, and following the death of president Giant Baba in 1999, Misawa inherited his position, but conflicts with widow and majority shareholder Motoko Baba led to his removal in May 2000. After this, Misawa led a mass exodus of the promotion&#x27;s talent to form Noah. Noah was successful in the first half of the decade, but as business declined and top star Kobashi left in 2006 for cancer treatment, Misawa continued to work a full-time schedule, despite mounting injuries, for the company&#x27;s survival. On June 13, 2009, during a tag match in Hiroshima with Go Shiozaki against Akitoshi Saito and Bison Smith, Misawa accidentally died after a botched belly-to-back suplex from Saito; his death was attributed to his numerous injuries that he had received for years before his death.

Misawa is regarded by some as the greatest professional wrestler of all time. The physical demands and consequences of the style in which he worked and the circumstances of his death, however, have made his legacy, or at least that of &quot;ōdō&quot;, somewhat problematic. Misawa was an eight-time world champion, having won the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship five times and the GHC Heavyweight Championship (which he was the inaugural holder of) three times. He was also an eight-time world tag team champion. Fifty-three of the sixty-nine events at the Nippon Budokan that Misawa headlined were sellouts, a drawing record that has been compared to Bruno Sammartino&#x27;s run at Madison Square Garden. Misawa was named Wrestler of the Year by the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; on three occasions (1995, 1997 and 1999), and at the time of his death held the record for most &quot;WON&quot; five star matches, with 25, including one as Tiger Mask. His match with Kawada on June 3, 1994, has been cited as one of the greatest professional wrestling matches of all time.

== Early life ==
Misawa was born in Yūbari, Hokkaidō, but the family moved to Koshigaya, Saitama as the coal mine where his father worked declined. Originally, his name was supposed to be Hideki, but was changed to Mitsuharu after his mother was denied honors.

Misawa had an older brother, who was favored by his father. According to Misawa, his father was violent towards his mother Akiko Misawa, and once stabbed her with a kitchen knife; they divorced during his first year of elementary school and, thus, Mitsuharu and his brother took Misawa as their surname. Misawa won a long jump competition held by Koshigaya in elementary school, and joined the gymnastics club in junior high.

=== Amateur wrestling ===

Misawa was a fan of professional wrestling, especially All Japan Pro Wrestling, from an early age, and his first favorite wrestlers were Horst Hoffman and Jumbo Tsuruta. Hoffman&#x27;s emerald green trunks would later be emulated by Misawa. Misawa had wanted to pursue a vocation as a professional wrestler since he was 12, and planned to do so after completing junior high, but his mother and teacher persuaded him to continue his studies so that he could attend a school with a good amateur wrestling program. Misawa attended the high school at the Ashikaga Institute of Technology in Tochigi on a scholarship, alongside Toshiaki Kawada, who was a year below him. They shared an interest in athletics and professional wrestling before they became professional wrestlers themselves. Misawa wanted to drop out in his second year to begin training, but during an encounter with Jumbo Tsuruta, he convinced Misawa to complete high school education, and to concentrate on amateur wrestling if he was serious about professional wrestling. Wrestling at 187 pounds (84.8 kilograms), Misawa won the national high school championship in 1980, and in the same year he placed fifth at the freestyle World Championships, competing in the junior age group. Despite his success, Misawa disliked amateur wrestling, and only saw it as a means to an end for a career in professional wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== All Japan Pro Wrestling (1981–2000) ===
====Debut and early years (1981–1984)====
Misawa entered the All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) training camp in March 1981, and was trained mainly by Kazuharu Sonoda and Akihisa Takachihō, though he also received training from Dick &quot;The Destroyer&quot; Beyer, Shohei Baba, Dory Funk Jr., and eventually Lou Thesz. He made his professional debut on August 21, 1981, where he lost against Shiro Koshinaka in an outdoor show in Urawa. After losing his first seventeen consecutive matches, Misawa had his first win on October 9 in a tag match with Mitsuo Momota against Hiromichi Fuyuki and Nobuyoshi Sugawara, and won his first singles match against Sugawara four nights later. In April 1983, Baba held a round-robin tournament for AJPW&#x27;s lower-ranked wrestlers called the Lou Thesz Cup, and Misawa entered the tournament alongside Koshinaka, Fuyuki, Mitsuo and brother Yoshihiro Momota, Sugawara, Kawada, and Tarzan Goto. Misawa reached the finals, and on April 22 in the Nakajima Sports Center, Misawa made his televised debut in the final match for the Lou Thesz Cup (which Thesz himself refereed), again wrestling Koshinaka to a loss. Baba had intended to send the tournament winner on a foreign excursion, but while Misawa lost the match, he was perceived as the superior talent, despite Koshinaka being three years his senior, so Baba decided to send them both. Misawa had his first title match on May 20, when he and Koshinaka unsuccessfully challenged Mighty Inoue and Ashura Hara for the attende.

Misawa and Koshinaka arrived in Mexico on March 16, 1984, where they wrestled for EMLL as a tag team under the names Samurai Shiro and the Kamikaze (or Kamikaze Misawa). Misawa improved his aerial skills under the guidance of La Fiera, and on April 5, Misawa had his first major singles championship match, headlining Arena México and wrestling NWA World Middleweight champion El Satánico to a loss. This excursion was meant to last one year, but Baba called Misawa and asked him if he could &quot;jump from the corner post&quot;, and when Misawa replied that he could, he was called back.

====Tiger Mask and unmasking (1984–1990)====

For the rest of the decade, and into spring 1990, Misawa wrestled as the second generation Tiger Mask, succeeding Satoru Sayama, as Baba purchased the rights to the character&#x27;s likeness from &quot;Tiger Mask&quot; mangaka Ikki Kajiwara. Misawa debuted as the character at a July 31 show in the Kuramae Kokugikan, and in his first match he defeated La Fiera at the sold-out Denen Coliseum on August 26. Misawa would notably work with Jerry Estrada and Pirata Morgan over the rest of the year.

In 1985, Baba would bring in top junior-heavyweight talents and high flyers to further establish the new Tiger Mask, including the Dynamite Kid and Kuniaki Kobayashi, the premier rivals of the original. While he was Sayama&#x27;s most notable rival during his time as Tiger Mask, the Dynamite Kid had signed with the WWF by this time, so Kobayashi became Misawa&#x27;s most notable feud in this period. Their first match on February 1 ended in double disqualification, when Kobayashi ripped up Misawa&#x27;s mask and busted him open by running him into the ring post. A rematch at Sumo Hall on March 9 ended in double count-out. On June 21, in his first match at Nippon Budokan, Misawa unsuccessfully challenged Kobayashi for the NWA International Junior Heavyweight Championship in a match rated the best of the year by the readers of the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;. Misawa blew out his knee before the match, and still delivered a &quot;great performance&quot; in what wrestling journalist and historian Dave Meltzer called &quot;the best match of the Tiger Mask era&quot;, but he would require surgery afterward. The aerial style which Misawa had been made to adopt under the Tiger Mask II gimmick strained his knees. According to Masanobu Fuchi, Misawa was actually more interested in working a ground-based style, and years later, he would comment that it was more difficult to elicit crowd reaction when working under the hood. Nonetheless, since the audience expected the superhuman from the Tiger Mask character, crowds were more difficult to impress during this period than they were after his unmasking. Upon his return, the Tiger Mask-Kobayashi program culminated on August 31 when Misawa won the title from Kobayashi in a rematch, with a variation of the tiger suplex wherein one of Misawa&#x27;s hands was used to put Kobayashi in a half nelson before lifting him; this would become known as the &quot;Tiger Suplex &#x27;85&quot;. After a successful defense in Aizuwakamatsu against Chavo Guerrero Sr. on October 28, Baba graduated Misawa to the heavyweight class due to his knee problems, and the championship was vacated in March 1986. While he did not stop performing aerial maneuvers, Misawa would use them more sparingly going forward.

On April 19, 1986, Misawa and Baba participated in the Crockett Cup, a single-elimination tag team tournament held at the Louisiana Superdome. They reached the quarterfinals, where they lost to eventual second-place team Ronnie Garvin and Magnum T. A. The next day, Misawa was taken to the AWA&#x27;s WrestleRock 86 event by Stan Hansen, where he defeated Buck Zumhofe. Misawa entered his first World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League (WSTDL) in 1986 alongside Baba, where his role was to lose pinfalls when they faced that year&#x27;s star teams. The pair would tie for sixth place with three wins, three losses, and one double count-out. The next March, Misawa was defeated in his only match against then-NWA champion Ric Flair. Misawa transitioned into being Tsuruta&#x27;s occasional tag partner as Tsuruta&#x27;s feud with Genichiro Tenryu became AJPW&#x27;s main program. On July 3, Misawa and Tsuruta won the PWF World Tag Team Championship from Ted DiBiase and Stan Hansen by count-out, which they held for eight days before dropping them back to the previous champions. In what was then &quot;the biggest singles win of his career&quot;, according to Meltzer, Misawa pinned DiBiase on July 19. For the 1987 WSTDL, Misawa entered alongside Shinichi Nakano, and the two tied for eighth place, with three wins, seven losses, and one double count-out. On the undercard of the WSTDL final, Misawa faced Kawada for the first time inside the Budokan, in the context of a tag match pitting himself and Takashi Ishikawa against Kawada and Fuyuki, and he pinned Kawada with a Tiger suplex.

On AJPW&#x27;s first event of 1988, Misawa wrestled an AWA World Heavyweight Championship match against Curt Hennig. Misawa won by countout, but the title did not change hands. This was very controversial at the time, since titles frequently changed hands via countout in Japan. For that year&#x27;s WSTDL, Misawa teamed with Jimmy Snuka, where they tied for seventh place with seven points. In a tag match held during the League but not towards it, Misawa had his first match against Kenta Kobashi (teaming with Ishikawa) on November 24, which he and Snuka won. On March 8, 1989, in the penultimate match of a card at the Nippon Budokan, Misawa received an NWA title shot against Ricky Steamboat, which he lost. He ruptured his left Anterior cruciate ligament during the match, and was inactive for the rest of 1989.

Misawa returned after his injury by participating in a main-event battle royal at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo on January 2, 1990, the first date of AJPW&#x27;s New Year Giant Series. On February 10, Misawa would wrestle for the first time inside the Tokyo Dome, though not in an AJPW event. NJPW president Seiji Sakaguchi asked Baba to help the company with their second Tokyo Dome show after plans with WCW fell through, and he agreed under the condition that the AJPW wrestlers would not be beaten or made to look weak. Misawa teamed with Genichiro Tenryu in a victory by countout against George Takano and Riki Choshu, in an event that sold out the Tokyo Dome with 53,000 people in attendance (the day after Mike Tyson vs. Buster Douglas drew 30,000 people). Despite the event&#x27;s success, Misawa&#x27;s match was never broadcast on television, since performers&#x27; contracts included exclusivity clauses to the television networks which broadcast their respective promotions&#x27; programming. On April 9, Misawa and Kenta Kobashi won the All Asia Tag Team Championship from the Can-Am Express, and four days later, Misawa wrestled Bret Hart to a time-limit draw at the WWF/NJPW/AJPW Supershow in the Dome.

Later that month, top star Genichiro Tenryu abruptly departed AJPW. He disagreed with Baba&#x27;s creative direction, especially the booker&#x27;s resistance to shootfighting influence on the All Japan product. Tenryu received a lucrative offer from Hachiro Tanaka, executive of eyewear company Megane Super, who had been interested in building his own wrestling promotion (and had almost signed Keiji Mutoh instead, but was blocked by Sakaguchi). This was initially under the auspices of becoming an ambassador for the brand, but the actual intentions of this deal were made clear months later by the formation of wrestling promotion Super World of Sports (and a resultant exodus of talent in its wake). Since this departure left Jumbo Tsuruta as the only native main event star that the promotion had, Baba made the decision to turn Misawa into his new rising star. During a tag match with Kawada against Yoshiaki Yatsu and Samson Fuyuki (both of whom would later join SWS) on May 14, Misawa commanded Kawada to unmask him, and thus abandoned the Tiger Mask gimmick. After winning the match, Misawa challenged his &quot;childhood hero&quot; Tsuruta to a singles match. After a successful defense of the All Asia Tag Team Championship against Davey Boy Smith and Johnny Smith, Misawa and Kobashi vacated the titles, foreshadowing Misawa&#x27;s main-event push.

====Feud with Jumbo Tsuruta and first Triple Crown victory (1990–1993)====

The tour built up to the Misawa-Tsuruta match through a series of six-man tags in which Misawa and fellow young stars, later to be known under the faction name of the Super Generation Army (, &quot;Chosedaigun&quot;), wrestled Tsuruta&#x27;s stable. During the third of these matches, at Korakuen Hall on May 26, Tsuruta bullied Misawa&#x27;s partners, Kobashi and Akira Taue, by knocking them off the apron unprovoked. However, when he tapped the active Misawa&#x27;s shoulder minutes later, Misawa retaliated with an elbow strike that downed Tsuruta for several minutes. On June 8, Misawa would face Tsuruta for the main event at Budokan. Baba was convinced in consultation with wrestling journalist Tarzan Yamamoto that Misawa had to defeat Tsuruta by pinfall. According to a now-famous backstage story which has been recounted several times by Meltzer, Baba&#x27;s decision to put Misawa over came during the event itself as, in the culmination of a trend that had been observed at house shows leading to this, Baba arrived at the venue to fans chanting &quot;Misawa&quot; outside, and noticed a significant boost in Misawa merchandise sales. Misawa defeated Tsuruta in a 24-minute match. This show had drawn about 500 people shy of a sellout, which was a rare attendance figure for All Japan. However, the momentum of Misawa&#x27;s push led All Japan to sell out every event they held in Tokyo after this until early 1996. This victory also marked the beginning of a feud between the Super Generation Army, with Misawa, Kawada, Kobashi, and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, and the Tsuruta-gun stable, a mix of veterans and younger talent. Akira Taue was initially among Misawa&#x27;s allies, but he soon defected to Tsuruta-gun. On July 27, Misawa made his first challenge for the vacant Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship in July, losing to Stan Hansen. Misawa lost to Tsuruta in a rematch on September 1, which determined the number one contender for the Triple Crown. Misawa teamed with Kawada to place third in the WSTDL, beating Tsuruta and Taue on the final day.

In a match against Taue on January 26, 1991, Misawa won by debuting the &quot;Tiger Driver &#x27;91&quot;, a variation of his &quot;Tiger Driver&quot; (sitout double underhook powerbomb) wherein he kept the double underhook applied while Taue was in midair to cause him to land on his head and shoulders. On February 26, Misawa and Kawada unsuccessfully challenged the team of Terry Gordy and Steve Williams, known as Satsujin Gyorai, for the World Tag Team championships in Sendai. During the match, Misawa was knocked out in kayfabe by a Gordy powerbomb to the arena floor, which left Kawada to fight the champions alone. Misawa then entered the 1991 Champion Carnival, held for the first time since 1982, and placed second in his block, with only one loss on April 6 to eventual second-place winner Stan Hansen. Misawa challenged Tsuruta for the Triple Crown on April 18, in the main event of a Budokan show that set an attendance record, but lost to him for the second consecutive time in singles competition. On June 9, Misawa pinned former Triple Crown champion Terry Gordy during a singles match in what was considered an upset, and when Misawa and Kawada faced Satsujin Gyorai on July 24 for a second tag title match, he pinned Gordy again. The pair made their first defense against Tsuruta and Taue on September 4 at Nippon Budokan, with Misawa historically forcing Jumbo to submit to a standing variation of the crossface to end the match. They vacated the belts for the 1991 WSTDL, which they entered. On a tournament match on November 21 against Kobashi and Kikuchi, Misawa&#x27;s eye was swollen shut after an elbow strike from Kobashi. Misawa and Kawada reached the finals despite this, wherein they lost to Satsujin Gyorai in 25:24.

At a Budokan event on March 4, 1992, which drew a record attendance figure of 16,300 people, Misawa unsuccessfully challenged Triple Crown champion Hansen for the belts. In the 1992 Champion Carnival, which took place from March 20 to April 17, Misawa reached the finals for the first time. On the twelfth date of the tournament, April 2, he wrestled Tsuruta in what would be their final singles match, and the two went to a 30-minute time-limit draw. Reigning Triple Crown champion Stan Hansen, who had lost to Tsuruta in the previous Champion Carnival final, defeated Misawa for his first CC win. On June 5, Misawa and Kobashi challenged Tsuruta and Taue for the World tag titles, but Taue pinned Kobashi for a successful defense. Misawa injured his shoulder in July and missed a few small dates. However, Tsuruta was also absent from the tour, for what was initially reported as a knee injury, and then as a case of gout upon his return, but was actually more serious, and AJPW did not want to lose both of their biggest draws for a whole tour. As a result, Misawa was forced back into action before he was ready, and worked matches while wearing a sling. On August 22, 1992, Misawa defeated Hansen to win the first of what would eventually be five Triple Crown championships. In his first defense, on the final card of the October Giant Series tour, Misawa defeated Kawada at Budokan. He and Kawada would later win the 1992 WSTDL, defeating Taue and Jun Akiyama (who had only debuted that September) on December 4 and earning their second World Tag Team Championship as a result. They would again drop the belts to Satsujin Gyorai in their first defense on January 30 when Williams pinned Misawa. On February 28, however, Misawa successfully defended his Triple Crown title against Taue.

====Feud with Toshiaki Kawada and teaming with Kenta Kobashi (1993–1995)====
The Misawa-Kawada team would soon end. Jumbo Tsuruta&#x27;s career, at least as a main-event wrestler, was over; he had abruptly left after completing the October Giant Series tour, and was diagnosed with hepatitis. Due to the void this left in the All Japan product, and Taue&#x27;s specific need for a tag partner, Baba split Kawada from Misawa in the spring of 1993 to become his premier native rival in singles competition. In early March 1993, Kawada announced that he would no longer work as Misawa&#x27;s tag partner after the advertised matches on the tour had been fulfilled. At the time he denied that he would join up with the remains of Jumbo&#x27;s faction, who were being led by Akira Taue. However, Kawada and Taue ended their feud with a handshake after wrestling to a draw in the 1993 Champion Carnival, and shortly thereafter formed the Holy Demon Army (, &quot;Seikigun&quot;). Kenta Kobashi would take Kawada&#x27;s place as Misawa&#x27;s tag partner.

Misawa entered the 1993 Champion Carnival and reached the finals to face Hansen again, who defeated him for his second Carnival victory on April 21 in Yokohama. Nevertheless, Misawa made a successful Triple Crown defense against Hansen on May 21 in Sapporo. On May 20, the HDA won the World Tag Team championships from Satsujin Gyorai on May 20, ending their fifth and final reign. Misawa and Kobashi unsuccessfully challenged them for the championships on June 1. Misawa defended the Triple Crown three more times in 1993: against Kawada on July 29,
Williams on September 3, and Hansen on October 23, during which Misawa broke his breastbone. Misawa and Kobashi entered the 1993 WSTDL, and defeated the Holy Demon Army in the finals. This marked Misawa&#x27;s second victory at the annual tournament, and his first tag championship reign with Kobashi.

On February 15, 1994, Misawa was issued an invitation to participate in UWF International&#x27;s (UWFi) summer tournament through a press conference, but this was ignored by the isolationist AJPW. On March 21, the third date of that year&#x27;s Champion Carnival, Misawa faced Doug Furnas in a tournament match. He won via submission, but a Frankensteiner from Furnas was said to have badly injured his neck, and after trying to work a six-man tag two nights later sat out the rest of the tournament. This injury was later reported to have been a work; Misawa had been written out of the Carnival so that Kawada and Williams could be established as singles stars through the tournament. Upon his return, Misawa and Kobashi successfully defended the tag titles against the Holy Demon Army on May 21 in Sapporo. Two weeks later, on June 3, Misawa defeated Kawada at Budokan in Kawada&#x27;s third challenge for the title, and the final successful defense of Misawa&#x27;s first Triple Crown reign. This match was the second to receive a six-star rating from Dave Meltzer, and would be the last one to do so until 2017. It has been specifically cited as one of the greatest professional wrestling matches of all time, and even the &quot;consensus Greatest Match of All Time&quot; from the tape-trading era of American puroresu fandom. Although he and Kobashi successfully defended against Steve Williams and Johnny Ace on July 22, Misawa dropped the world championship to Williams six days later. At 705 days, Misawa&#x27;s first reign is the longest in Triple Crown history.

Misawa and Kobashi vacated the World Tag Team belts for the 1994 WSTDL, which they won for the second consecutive year on December 10 against Williams and Ace in 25:05. Although they only defended the belts once, Misawa and Kobashi&#x27;s first reign was the longest in the title&#x27;s history for over a decade. On January 24, 1995, they successfully defended against the Holy Demon Army, working to a time limit draw. The story of this match had Kawada knock out Misawa with a punch to the chin at the 24-minute mark, which forced Kobashi to essentially work a handicap match for 25 minutes. However, Misawa recovered to make a successful comeback. Misawa and Kobashi then defeated Williams and Ace on March 3 at Budokan for their second and final successful defense. The next month, Misawa participated in the penultimate match of the Weekly Pro Wrestling Tokyo Dome Show, a six-man tag in which he, Kobashi, and Triple Crown champion Hansen wrestled to a thirty-minute time-limit draw against Kawada, Taue, and Ace.

Misawa entered the 1995 Champion Carnival. Despite reportedly suffering a broken orbital bone after a Kawada kick during a match on April 6 which ended in a time-limit draw, Misawa did not miss any shows. He proceeded to the finals with seven wins and three draws, and won the Carnival against Taue on April 15. On May 26, he won his second Triple Crown championship against Stan Hansen in Sapporo, ending his then-record fourth (and final) Triple Crown reign. Misawa and Kobashi lost the tag titles in the &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot; match of the year on June 9, when the Holy Demon Army defeated them at Budokan. What made this match particularly significant is that it was the first time Kawada got a pinfall over Misawa in their rivalry, as well as the first time Misawa himself had lost a pinfall to anyone since Williams had defeated him for the Triple Crown. However, this success would not repeat itself, as on July 24 at the sold-out Budokan, Kawada fell short against Misawa once again, in the first defense of this Triple Crown reign. On September 10, Misawa defended the title against Taue, but on October 15, Misawa and Kobashi failed to win the World Tag Team titles back from the Holy Demon Army, in another sixty-minute time limit draw in Nagoya. Misawa won his first Triple Crown defense against Kobashi ten days later, but the two again entered the 1995 WSTDL as a team, defeating the Holy Demon Army for Misawa&#x27;s fourth consecutive win of the tournament. In a story similar to previous matches between the teams, Misawa sold a Kawada kick to the eye by lying outside the ring for ten minutes. Kobashi managed to get the pinfall himself, though, with a moonsault to Taue. This would be Misawa&#x27;s final WSTDL win, and through this win he and Kobashi became the first tag team since Terry and Dory Funk Jr. to win the tournament three times. The tag titles, however, did not change hands, as they had not been vacated before the tournament by the Holy Demon Army.

====Teaming with Jun Akiyama (1996–1998)====
On March 2, Misawa defended the Triple Crown against Gary Albright, who had signed with AJPW in late 1995 after departing the UWFi. This was the main event that broke AJPW&#x27;s Tokyo sellout streak, drawing only 14,000 people to Budokan. In April, Misawa participated in the Champion Carnival, and tied for third place. On May 24, at the Nakajima Sports Center in Sapporo, Misawa dropped the championship to Taue, who had won that year&#x27;s Carnival. The next week, Misawa and new partner Jun Akiyama won the World Tag Team titles from the Holy Demon Army. They made two successful defenses—the first on June 8 against Williams and Ace (voted match of the year by the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;), and the second on July 9 against the Holy Demon Army—before dropping the titles to Williams and Ace on September 5. Misawa and Akiyama entered the 1996 WSTDL, and were defeated in the final match by the Holy Demon Army when Kawada pinned Misawa in 31:37.

On January 20, 1997, Misawa defeated Kobashi in the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium to win his third Triple Crown championship. He defeated Steve Williams in his first defense on March 1, which was the retirement match of referee Joe Higuchi. Misawa then entered the 1997 Champion Carnival. Unlike the previous two years, Misawa reached the finals, with nine wins, two losses to Kobashi and Williams, and one draw against Kawada. However, as he, Kobashi, and Kawada had achieved a three-way tie, a one-night round-robin tournament playoff between the three was held to determine the victor. After Misawa and Kobashi wrestled first to a time-limit draw, Kawada defeated Misawa in singles competition for the first time in their rivalry, pinning him in 6:09. On May 31, 1997, Misawa had a six-man tag with Kobashi and Kentaro Shiga against Williams, Richard Slinger and Lacrosse which was billed as Misawa and Kobashi&#x27;s last match as tag partners. After they won, Kobashi thanked Misawa with a handshake. The next week, Misawa defeated Kawada again in a June 6 Triple Crown match. On a sold-out July 25 Budokan show, Misawa made a successful title defense against Taue. On August 26 in Sapporo, though, he and Akiyama lost a world tag title shot against Albright and Williams when Albright pinned Misawa with a dragon suplex. On September 6, Misawa defeated Akiyama in his first Triple Crown title match. In October, Misawa made two more successful defenses ten days apart. The first was against Williams on October 11 in Fukuoka, and the second was against Kobashi on October 21 at the Budokan, during AJPW&#x27;s 25th anniversary event. The latter won the Match of the Year award from &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot;. Misawa and Akiyama entered the 1997 WSTDL, and reached the finals against the Holy Demon Army again, to lose at Budokan on December 5. AJPW announced the show had sold out, but it was reported as actually having drawn 800 seats below the Budokan&#x27;s maximum capacity.

For his first defense of 1998, at the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium on January 26, Misawa defeated Akiyama by debuting the &quot;Emerald Flowsion&quot;. One month later, he had his final successful defense of the reign against Johnny Ace at the sold-out Budokan. This February 28 event was the first in a Budokan sellout streak that would last until Misawa&#x27;s departure from AJPW. Misawa entered the 1998 Champion Carnival, and proceeded to the finals with eight wins, three draws against Akiyama, Hansen, and Kawada, and one loss to Taue. This was despite various neck and back injuries, a broken finger, and a broken left kneecap, the latter of which was suffered during a match on April 6 against Ace. Despite this, and against a doctor&#x27;s recommendation to perform surgery and take six weeks off, Misawa continued to work, and won the Champion Carnival for the second and final time in another match against Akiyama.

====Final years (1998–2000)====
In an effort to increase All Japan Pro Wrestling&#x27;s visibility amidst unsatisfactory sales and television viewership numbers, Baba decided after years of refusal to book the Tokyo Dome for a belated AJPW 25th Anniversary show on May 1, despite the reservations of Misawa and Kobashi. Plans to use this as a &quot;soft reset&quot; for the company product, including an FMW-style exploding ring deathmatch with Atsushi Onita and a potential partnership with the WWF, were vetoed by Baba, who believed that &quot;if [they] were to do this, it would have to be as service to [their] fans&quot;. For the main event of this show, Kawada received his second title shot against Misawa during this reign, which All Japan announced in a March 16 press conference would have no time limit. In a result that had been foreshadowed over the past year, through not only Kawada&#x27;s tainted victory over him in the 1997 Champion Carnival finals, but the draws that they had wrestled to in both of their other meetings during the last two Carnivals, Misawa finally dropped the championship to Kawada. Misawa went into the match with two blown knees and a bad neck and back, and as he suffered a legitimate concussion during the match he could not remember the finish afterwards; Baba announced that Misawa would take a break to heal.

Misawa returned on August 22 to work the first main event of the Summer Action Series II tour, a six-man match with Akiyama and Satoru Asako against Kobashi, Ace, and Johnny Smith. He admitted that his knees were still a problem and that he only felt sixty percent healthy, but he considered his return necessary because the two tours without him had been the worst-performing in company history. Misawa and Akiyama officially disbanded their team on August 30 after defeating Kobashi and Takao Omori in the main event of a show in Hakata. While he had had creative influence before this, it was around September when Misawa took over the booker position almost entirely after he reportedly threatened to start his own promotion. However, Baba still booked the Triple Crown programs and finishes through the end of 1998. In October, he started wrestling tag matches with Yoshinari Ogawa. At the Budokan on October 31, Misawa faced Triple Crown champion Kobashi for the title, and won to start his fourth Triple Crown reign in 43:29. This match was rated Match of the Year by &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot;, &quot;Nippon Sports&quot;, and the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;. Misawa and Ogawa participated in the 1998 WSTDL and placed fifth with a 3-3-1 record. On January 22, 1999, Misawa lost the Triple Crown to Kawada in his first defense, but Kawada vacated it the next day. Seven minutes into the match, he had delivered a spinning backfist to the back of Misawa&#x27;s head with such force that he broke his right forearm and wrist. This is the reason for the &quot;ganso bomb&quot; spot in which Kawada, unable to lift Misawa all the way for a powerbomb, dropped him onto his neck.

The match involving Kawada and Misawa was the last match that Giant Baba would watch, having reportedly called it the best match he had ever seen. Nine days later, he died of liver failure from complications of colon cancer. Misawa had not been aware of the severity of his condition, which was only known by Baba&#x27;s innermost circle: his wife Motoko, older sister, and daughter, as well as referee Kyohei Wada and secretary Ryu Nakata. Although Motoko Baba had selected Mitsuo Momota to succeed her late husband as president, board member Jumbo Tsuruta used his influence to help Misawa inherit the position, before Tsuruta himself was forced out of the company with no severance package. Momota, who would function as an intermediary between Misawa and Motoko, ran the office while Misawa was trained for the position. After Misawa and Ogawa unsuccessfully challenged Kobashi and Akiyama for the tag titles in the semi-main event at a March 6 Budokan show, Misawa placed third in the 1999 Champion Carnival. He then defeated Vader for the Triple Crown championship on May 2, in the main event of the Giant Baba Retirement Show (so named because AJPW did not want to consider it a memorial event) at the Tokyo Dome. On May 7, a press conference was held to announce that Misawa was the new AJPW president. One month later, on June 11, Misawa successfully defended against Kobashi at Budokan. For the second consecutive year, Misawa and Kobashi won the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot; Match of the Year award. However, Kobashi suffered a broken nose, and Misawa was so fatigued that, for the first time, reporters were not allowed to see him. Misawa successfully defended against Kawada on July 23, defeating him with the Tiger Driver &#x27;91. Misawa and Ogawa won both the All Asia and World Tag Team Championships from No Fear on August 25. They vacated the All Asia belts soon afterward, as the match was done to break up the monopoly No Fear had achieved in the company&#x27;s tag division. Misawa arranged a tournament for the All Asia titles from October 9–25, in which he and Ogawa did not participate. Misawa and Ogawa lost the World Tag Team titles to Akiyama and Kobashi on October 23 in Nagoya when Kobashi pinned Misawa after a &quot;Burning Hammer&quot;. Then, Misawa&#x27;s fifth Triple Crown reign ended at Budokan on October 30, when he was defeated by Vader. In the 1999 WSTDL, Misawa and Ogawa scored nine points (4-1-2), achieving third place in a three-way tie.

In a Budokan show on February 27, 2000, Misawa was pinned by Akiyama for the first time in singles competition during the semi main-event. Misawa then entered the 2000 Champion Carnival, which he changed from round-robin format to a single-elimination tournament for the first time since 1974. Reigning Triple Crown champion Kobashi defeated him in the semifinal, and went on to win his first Champion Carnival after ten consecutive appearances.

==== Exodus (2000) ====

While Misawa became company president in 1999, and had been head booker for several months before that, Shohei Baba&#x27;s widow Motoko held eighty-five percent of AJPW&#x27;s shares with Nippon TV holding the other fifteen. There were reports of a &quot;quiet&quot; power struggle between Misawa and Motoko in March 1999, and Tsuruta confirmed this when he left Japan for Portland, Oregon. In fact, the two had had professional tensions long beforehand. Motoko had opposed the decision to push Misawa in the wake of Genichiro Tenryu&#x27;s departure in 1990. The two began conflicting as early as 1996. In the year before Shohei Baba&#x27;s death, Misawa even asked him on behalf of the locker room to have his wife leave the company. He was somewhat successful in that she ceased to have any creative influence when Misawa began booking. Misawa attempted to keep her content by maintaining the same salary that she had been paid when her husband was alive (approximately $500,000), but since she was the majority shareholder this did not change the power dynamic. Misawa&#x27;s wish to change the AJPW product, and to modernize its presentation, to address their box office troubles ran in direct opposition to Baba&#x27;s intent to maintain her late husband&#x27;s booking philosophy. Misawa was particularly intent on pushing the company&#x27;s younger talent. In September 1999 he and Baba had a major fight over his decision to have Akiyama and Takao Omori headline a Budokan show (which sold out), although this match&#x27;s placement had been decided by a fan ballot. Motoko&#x27;s conservatism was partially due to her belief that the company, and Japanese wrestling as a whole, had fallen from its peak. Misawa was also angry with Motoko over fiscal matters, as he had discovered that much of the company&#x27;s merchandise sales did not produce funds for AJPW, but for a subsidiary that she had set up. At some point, Misawa approached Nippon TV with his plans to leave AJPW to start a new promotion, and told them that nearly everyone in the locker room would follow him. NTV officials sided with Misawa in this dispute, but told him that they needed to keep their agreement quiet for one year after the meeting. Due to the proximity of Baba&#x27;s death, the station wanted to wait until enough time had passed to drop All Japan&#x27;s television program, which had been associated closely with NTV since its formation. Nevertheless, rumors that NTV had taken Misawa&#x27;s side in his dispute against Baba saw print in February 2000, and &quot;Weekly Fight Magazine&quot; reported that AJPW would split itself into two groups in May, though Misawa declined to comment on this.

Adding to the situation was that, as of the end of the fiscal year on March 31, 2000, all the promotion&#x27;s talent were working as free agents, since Misawa was not authorized to give the raises he intended to award all native workers. Misawa had also wanted to modernize their contracts, providing wrestlers with full medical coverage, full injury pay, and possibly stock options (which NJPW&#x27;s contracts offered). As the result of these disagreements, the AJPW executive board voted to remove Misawa from the presidential position on May 28. All parties agreed to keep this news private until the end of the current tour, and Misawa attempted to persuade Baba to give him her public blessings to start a new company, so as to smooth the public transition and preserve the legacies of Giant Baba and the recently deceased Tsuruta. Baba refused this proposal or relinquishment of any of her majority share, and so &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot; broke the news on June 12. At an emergency board meeting held in response on June 13, co-vice president Mitsuo Momota and fellow boardsmen Kobashi, Taue, Kenichi Oyagi, and Yoshihiro Momota collectively resigned from their positions.

On June 16, Misawa led a press conference, in which he was accompanied by all of AJPW&#x27;s native wrestlers except Kawada and Fuchi. He announced that after finishing their last commitments to AJPW in July, all 23 who accompanied him to the conference would depart with Misawa to form a new promotion in August. The next day, Misawa announced the name of the new promotion: Pro Wrestling Noah. On June 20, Misawa met with Nippon TV officials, who had cancelled All Japan&#x27;s television program, and secured a time slot for Noah programming. On July 20, he wrestled his last AJPW match for several years, in which he and Ogawa won against Taue and Masao Inoue.

=== Pro Wrestling Noah (2000–2009) ===
==== First years (2000–2002) ====

Pro Wrestling Noah debuted with two events, collectively called Departure, on August 5 and 6 at Differ Ariake. While they sold out in minutes, the events themselves were not profitable. The low ticket prices attracted scalpers, who resold $60 ringside seats for $2700. Noah also spent more than the live gate of the first show to place a screen in the parking lot for the 1,300 people watching outside the venue. In the first show&#x27;s main event, Misawa and Taue lost to Kobashi and Akiyama in a two-out-of-three-falls tag match, and in the second, Misawa and Ogawa defeated Kentaro Shiga and Daisuke Ikeda. The company would struggle to grow from here, because legal threats against NTV from Motoko Baba kept Noah off television until April 2001. Misawa had not expected as much of AJPW&#x27;s talent to join him in the exodus as they had, and financial difficulties caused Misawa to cancel his insurance and borrow money from his home to fund their salaries. However, Noah sold out their biggest show to date, December 23&#x27;s Great Voyage at Ariake Coliseum, well in advance. In his first major singles match for his own promotion, Misawa defeated Vader in the semi-main event.

Another problem for Noah arose on January 18, 2001, when, during a tag match with Taue against Misawa and Naomichi Marufuji, Kobashi severely injured his right knee. Kobashi&#x27;s knees had been in poor condition as early as 1991, due to his use of the moonsault and general overachieving nature in the ring. While he intended to have double knee surgery performed at the end of his tenure in AJPW, he did not go through with it when Departure was scheduled for August, and he continued to work Noah&#x27;s events thereafter. Kobashi had surgery on January 25 to transfer cartilage from his elbow to his knee. While it was initially reported that he would be able to return in July, this was much too optimistic as Kobashi would have several more procedures throughout the year.

In early 2001, Misawa had his only two matches against Shinya Hashimoto, who had worked on the Great Voyage card. In the first, on January 13, Misawa and Ogawa defeated Hashimoto and Alexander Otsuka at the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium when Misawa pinned Otsuka after a tiger driver. In the second, the main-event of the inaugural show of Hashimoto-cofounded promotion Pro Wrestling Zero1, March 2&#x27;s Truth Century Creation, Misawa and Akiyama defeated Hashimoto and Yuji Nagata in the sold-out Ryōgoku Kokugikan. From March 18 through April 15, Noah held the Navigation for the Victory GHC tour, which featured a sixteen-man, single-elimination tournament held to determine the inaugural GHC Heavyweight champion. At the first stop of the tour in Differ Ariake, Misawa defeated Akitoshi Saito in the first round, and proceeded to the finals after victories over Ogawa in Okayama on April 4, and Akiyama in Hiroshima on April 11. For Noah&#x27;s first television taping, at the Kokusai International Center on April 1 (aired April 6), Misawa and Ogawa won against Marufuji and Takeshi Rikio. On April 15, before a reported crowd of 12,000 people in the Ariake Coliseum, Misawa defeated Yoshihiro Takayama to become the first GHC Heavyweight champion. During this match, Misawa began bleeding from his mouth after a high kick from Takayama legitimately knocked his jaw out of alignment, and also ended the match with a five-centimeter cut which required six stitches. After a successful defense against Taue on May 18 in Sapporo, Misawa lost the championship to Akiyama on July 28, in a sold-out Budokan event for the promotion&#x27;s one-year anniversary. In October, Misawa and Ogawa participated in the Navigation Tug of War tournament to determine the first GHC Tag Team champions, but were eliminated in the semi-finals by Akiyama and Saito. Misawa and Ogawa became the second team to hold the belts when they defeated Scorpio and Vader on November 30 in Sapporo, but this reign only lasted nine days before they dropped the belts to No Fear in the sold-out Ariake Coliseum.

On February 17, 2002, at Nippon Budokan, Misawa teamed with the returning Kobashi for a match against Akiyama and Yuji Nagata which Akiyama pinned Kobashi to win. It appeared that Kobashi was going to resume full-time work for Noah in their next tour, and this was greatly anticipated, as the return show had sold out over a month in advance. However, Kobashi further damaged ligaments in his left knee during the match. Kobashi was advised to take the next six months off, or have major surgery that would prevent him from wrestling for another year. While he initially intended to ignore medical opinion, Misawa cancelled his appearances. This essentially forbade Kobashi from returning before he was ready, despite the increased business that this would have brought Noah. On May 5, Misawa wrestled his first match for New Japan Pro-Wrestling since 1990, in which he faced Masahiro Chono for the Toukon Memorial Day event in the Tokyo Dome. The two wrestled to a thirty-minute time-limit draw, as has been Noah&#x27;s insistence, particularly from Ryu Nakata, in order to bolster the nascent company&#x27;s credibility. On September 23, 2002, Misawa defeated GHC Heavyweight champion Takayama to begin his second reign. Takayama was at the peak of his stardom, due to his fight against Don Frye at Pride 21, and according to Meltzer in his 2009 Misawa obituary, this was when Noah &quot;really started taking off&quot;. The match was noted for its brutality, and it caused Takayama to suffer a dislocated AC joint, torn shoulder ligaments, and a broken eye socket bone (the latter was the same injury he received during the Frye bout). Misawa made his only successful defense on December 7, defeating Ogawa.

==== The peak of Noah (2003–2005) ====
At Great Voyage 2003, the first event of the year (at the sold-out Budokan), Misawa and Chono were defeated in the semi-main event by Kobashi and Taue when Kobashi pinned Misawa. On March 1, 2003, in the sold-out Budokan, Kobashi used the &quot;Burning Hammer&quot; to defeat Misawa for the GHC Heavyweight Championship, in their first Noah singles meeting. Like Kawada&#x27;s Tokyo Dome win over Misawa in 1998, this was the culmination of years of failure on Kobashi&#x27;s end to overcome Misawa in title matches. The resultant match received significant critical acclaim. As they had done in 1999, Misawa and Kobashi won Match of the Year awards from &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot; and the &quot;Wrestling Observer Newsletter&quot;. Meltzer wrote in 2015 that the Misawa/Kobashi rivalry &quot;peaked&quot; with this match. Misawa said afterwards that this would be their final singles match, and with the exception of the opening match of Noah&#x27;s 2004 Christmas Eve show (a ten-minute time-limit draw), this would be honored.

At Great Voyage 2004 on January 10, in the sold-out Budokan, Misawa and Ogawa began their second GHC Tag Team Championship reign when they defeated NJPW stars Yuji Nagata and Hiroshi Tanahashi. Alongside Naomichi Marufuji and Kenta Kobayashi winning the GHC Junior Heavyweight Tag Team championships from El Samurai and Wataru Inoue in the semi-main event, this was a victory for Noah as they had lost their last four interpromotional matches with NJPW talent. This also made Misawa and Ogawa the first two-time GHC Tag Team champions, and this reign would last far longer than their first. After successful defenses on March 6 against Ikeda and Muhammad Yone, and on April 25 against Kobayashi and Marufuji, Misawa and Ogawa appeared for American independent promotion Pro Wrestling IRON, defending the belts against Nigel McGuinness and Bart Blaxson on June 11 in San Leandro, California.

Misawa and Ogawa&#x27;s next defense was Noah&#x27;s first interpromotional match with AJPW wrestlers since the mass exodus. On July 10, Noah held their first Tokyo Dome show, Departure, and in the penultimate match, they defended against AJPW president Keiji Mutoh and Taiyo Kea, one of the few AJPW wrestlers who had not joined the Noah exodus. Eight days later, Misawa had his first AJPW match since July 2000, where he defeated Satoshi Kojima in the semi-main event of Battle Banquet. On September 10, Misawa and Ogawa defended against Saito and Inoue, and on October 24, they defended against Taue and Takuma Sano. Misawa returned to AJPW on October 31 for the Keiji Mutoh: Love and Bump pay-per-view, where he and Mutoh defeated Hiroshi Hase and Kensuke Sasaki in what was billed as a &quot;Special Dream Tag Match&quot;. After another successful GHC Tag Team defense against Donovan Morgan and Michael Modest on December 4 in Yokohama, Misawa and Ogawa lost the titles to Doug Williams and Scorpio on January 23, 2005, when Scorpio pinned Ogawa.

Misawa made several interpromotional appearances in the first half of 2005, including a UK tour. On March 18, he and Ogawa defeated Doug Williams and Stevie Knight in a British Championship Wrestling event. The next day, at The Wrestling Channel&#x27;s International Showdown supercard, Misawa, Ogawa, and Kotaro Suzuki were defeated by Williams, Scorpio, and James Tighe. On March 20, Misawa and Suzuki appeared for German promotion Westside Xtreme Wrestling, losing to Ares and Ahmed Chaer. At a Budokan show on April 24 which drew 15,800 people, Misawa and Suzuki lost to Marufuji and Minoru Suzuki. During this event, Kawada made his first appearance for Noah after the third match. He then challenged Misawa to a match on Noah&#x27;s July 18 Tokyo Dome show. In his final interpromotional appearance of the year, Misawa and Tatsumi Fujinami defeated Masahiro Chono and Jushin Liger at NJPW Nexess VI on May 14. At July 18&#x27;s Destiny, the promotion&#x27;s second Tokyo Dome event, he faced Kawada for the first time since the exodus in the main event, which he won. Noah claimed a sellout crowd of 62,000 people attended the event, but a later earnings report recorded that the company lost 10 million yen on the show. Destiny was Noah&#x27;s final Tokyo Dome event. Misawa unsuccessfully challenged Rikio for the GHC Heavyweight Championship in the sold-out Budokan on September 18, and on Noah&#x27;s final Budokan show of the year on November 5, which sold out, he defeated Genichiro Tenryu.

==== Noah&#x27;s decline (2006–2009) ====

On the undercard of Noah&#x27;s April 23, 2006, Budokan show, Misawa and Ogawa defeated Minoru Suzuki and Takahiro Suwa. Noah announced an attendance of 14,200 people, but the real number was reportedly under 10,000. In July, Misawa announced that Kobashi would be out indefinitely to treat kidney cancer, which had been diagnosed through tests run during his annual physical. Noah&#x27;s next Budokan show on July 16 was set to have Kobashi and Takayama face Misawa and Akiyama in the main event. This was Takayama&#x27;s first match in two years, as he had suffered a stroke after a 2004 NJPW G1 Climax match against Kensuke Sasaki. Misawa arranged Sasaki himself as a replacement for Kobashi, and the resultant event was a sellout. After this, though, Budokan show attendance declined throughout the year, as Misawa gave junior heavyweight Marufuji a GHC Heavyweight Championship run (which he won from Akiyama in September). When Misawa decided to break tradition further, and hold a Budokan show on October 29 wherein Marufuji defended the title against fellow junior Kobayashi, only 5,000 people of the 11,500 reportedly in attendance paid to see the event. Adding to the situation was that Noah depended on events that they sold to local promoters, who most often were older, wealthy men who did not follow the product closely and bought a Noah show to see Misawa and Kobashi. Misawa had planned to retire in 2007, but he was the only consistent top draw that Noah had. Misawa decided to put the world title on himself for Noah&#x27;s survival, because he felt pressured to appear on every show at least until Kobashi returned. He defeated Marufuji at Great Voyage at the Budokan on December 10 to win his third GHC Heavyweight Championship.

Misawa held the GHC Heavyweight Championship for 448 days, his longest championship reign since his fourth Triple Crown reign, and made seven successful defenses throughout 2007. The first of these was on January 12, when he defeated Takeshi Morishima. On April 28, he defended against Takuma Sano. Bison Smith challenged Misawa on June 3, and Taue challenged on July 15. In late August, it was announced that Misawa would be on the November 2 and 3 Ring of Honor (ROH) Glory By Honor cards in Philadelphia and New York City respectively. On September 29, Misawa defeated Marufuji in a rematch for the GHC title, and on October 27, Misawa successfully defended against Samoa Joe in a Budokan show with 14,000 people in attendance. The following week, Misawa traveled to the United States for the ROH appearances. On the first night, he teamed with Kenta Kobayashi to face Morishima and Marufuji, wrestling to a thirty-minute time-limit draw. The following night, he defended against Kobayashi. Despite having reportedly contracted flu, this match was considered by some to have been Misawa&#x27;s best in years, and Meltzer stated in 2009 that it was Misawa&#x27;s final singles match &quot;in the **** [four-star] range&quot;. On December 2, Misawa and Akiyama wrestled Kobashi and Takayama, in Kobashi&#x27;s return match. This match, which was held before a Budokan sellout crowd of 17,000 people (reportedly the venue&#x27;s all-time attendance record), and which Misawa won with an &quot;Emerald Flowsion&quot; to Kobashi off the middle rope, was awarded Match of the Year by &quot;Nikkan Sports&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot;. Misawa himself was awarded Wrestler of the Year by &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot;, and received the &quot;Nikkan Sports&quot; MVP award as determined by fan voting.

On March 2, 2008, Misawa was defeated by Morishima for the GHC Heavyweight Championship. After this, Misawa still felt obligated to work every Noah event; while Kobashi had returned, by this time the company was struggling too much to handle losing Misawa on their cards. His injuries were accumulating, including osteophytes on his neck which caused pain during simple tasks, such as brushing his teeth and touching the collar of his gown, and a visual impairment in his right eye which was discovered in 2007. Misawa had also long been a chain smoker. Misawa mostly worked mid-card tag matches where his partners did much of the work, which was how Giant Baba had remained an active wrestler until the last two months of his life. Misawa and Ogawa entered Noah&#x27;s first Global Tag League, held from March 29 to April 27, and reached the finals, where they were defeated by Saito and Smith at Budokan. In June, Noah went on a brief European tour. On June 21, Misawa and Marufuji defeated Kobashi and Go Shiozaki in Coventry; after this, NOAH split to work shows in Farringdon and Oberhausen, the latter for Westside Xtreme Wrestling. Misawa worked the former show, where he and Kotaro Suzuki defeated Smith &amp; Mark Haskins. While these events were relatively successful, Noah had their lowest crowd to date for a July 18 Budokan show, with only 6,000 people attending the event. In September, Nippon TV affiliate Yomiuri TV cancelled their Noah broadcasts. As the Kansai region had historically been a hotbed for Baba, this was seen as indicative of the end of an era. Around this time, Noah announced that they would no longer take their entire roster on tours in order to cut travel costs. On December 17, Nippon TV announced that they would be cutting Noah&#x27;s television program in March to compensate for advertising losses in the wake of the Great Recession. This marked the end of a 55-year period of wrestling programming on the station, going back to the JWA. The program, which had been airing in a thirty-minute Sunday slot floating between 1:30 and 3 AM, was still Noah&#x27;s best means of mainstream exposure.

Misawa appeared at NJPW&#x27;s Wrestle Kingdom III on January 4, 2009, losing alongside Takashi Sugiura to Shinsuke Nakamura and Hirooki Goto. On March 1, Noah held their final NTV taping at Budokan, with a near-sellout of 14,200 people in attendance. This show was also significant for Kobashi&#x27;s return after a September elbow surgery. Noah announced television deals with satellite stations Nittele G+ and Fighting TV Samurai. However, there was a low percentage of Japanese homes with satellite television. This meant that the most television exposure Noah would have going forward was a half-hour timeslot after midnight on TV Osaka (a smaller affiliate of TV Tokyo).

Misawa decided to set up Shiozaki as Noah&#x27;s new ace as opposed to Morishima, whose championship reign had seen business decline, and whose weight had become a concern. He did this by giving him several big wins before an unsuccessful title match against Akiyama on April 16. In order for Shiozaki to rebound and gain credibility, Misawa formed a tag team with him, and they entered the second Global Tag League, which took place from April 11 to May 6. They reached the finals with nine points (4-2-1), and defeated Morishima and Sasaki to win. This final match was held at Budokan, and was Misawa&#x27;s sixty-ninth main event at the venue. It would be his final date there, and as the first Noah Budokan show since losing NTV coverage, only 7,300 people attended. The backing of local promoters in rural areas was more important than ever, and these promoters wanted Noah&#x27;s biggest stars to wrestle even if they weren&#x27;t in the physical condition to do so. Four days before his death, Misawa admitted to a &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot; reporter that he wanted to retire, and that &quot;he couldn&#x27;t do this until he was 48&quot;. Despite this, he said that he was not going to take a break, because he needed to put Shiozaki over and &quot;if he rested just once, he would be unable to return&quot;. According to Ryu Nakata in an interview given shortly after Misawa&#x27;s death, Misawa had told his wife that day that he planned to retire by the end of the year and work in another unspecified field, and had told Nakata that he did not wish to work a farewell tour.

== Personal life ==
Misawa married actress Mayumi Shiina on May 10, 1988. They had two children, a daughter named Kaede and a son named Shizuma, who were reported to have been 20 and 17 years of age, respectively, at the time of his death. After his death, Mayumi became a majority shareholder in Noah. Misawa was very private about his life outside of wrestling, to the point that wrestlers who had known him for decades were unaware that he had children. He was also said to have been an avid gamer, and at one point revealed to video game magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; a list of his favorite video games. Misawa said that the green attire and boots he wore were influenced by Horst Hoffman.

== Death ==
On June 13, 2009, Misawa teamed with Shiozaki against GHC Tag Team Champions Saito and Smith in a title match at Hiroshima Green Arena. The match was supposed to last 37 minutes, but around ten minutes before the scheduled finish, Misawa took a back suplex from Saito. Misawa was motionless, and referee Shuichi Nishinaga stopped the match. A doctor in attendance attempted to perform CPR, but was unsuccessful, and Misawa&#x27;s body discolored as emergency medical technicians attempted to revive him with an automated external defibrillator. Misawa was taken to the Hiroshima University hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 10:10pm JST, at age 46. Although Misawa&#x27;s family invoked a Japanese law that requested the police not publicly release the official cause of death, it was speculated in the official police report to have been a cervical injury, and the Hiroshima Prefectural Police Central Office stated the night after the accident that the &quot;diagnosis was cervical cord transection&quot;. The injury was specified and reported by Meltzer as a cervical fracture, which separated Misawa&#x27;s first and second cervical vertebrae, known as atlanto-axial dislocation&quot;.

===Aftermath===
Misawa&#x27;s death was the leading story amongst the Japanese sports press. &quot;Nikkan Sports&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Sports&quot; printed special memorial issues on June 22, and &quot;Weekly Pro Wrestling&quot; printed photographs of the maneuver which killed Misawa. However, highbrow newspapers and mainstream sources gave the event little coverage (NHK only devoted one minute to the story on their primetime newscast), since older editors did not consider wrestling major news due to its great decline in overall popularity. An exception to this trend was NTV broadcaster Kazuo Tokumitsu, who devoted twenty minutes of his morning program to Misawa. Tokumitsu, a figure of great influence in NTV who once worked as AJPW&#x27;s head announcer, had reportedly opposed the network cancellation. Wrestling promotions across the world opened their shows with ceremonial ten counts in tribute, and WWE and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling both posted memorial messages on their respective websites. WWE wrestler CM Punk wrote &#x27;MISAWA&#x27; on his wrist and forearm tape as tribute during the June 15 episode of &quot;WWE Raw&quot;. Also, Yoshi Tatsu wore a ring attire resembling Misawa&#x27;s for some weeks as a tribute.

At a tour bus meeting after Misawa was taken to the hospital, Noah wrestlers were informed that he had died, but that the company could not afford to cancel the tour&#x27;s remaining dates. The next day, they proceeded with a Fukuoka show. Vice President Momota did not reveal Misawa&#x27;s cause of death, as was requested by his family (this was before the Hiroshima police released their report), and Akiyama, who was set to defend the title that night against Rikio, vacated the championship. Akiyama had continued to work despite significant pain, and had been in too much pain the night before to go to ringside when attempts were made to revive Misawa. Misawa&#x27;s death spurred him to seek examination, and a hernia was found between his L4 and L5 vertebrae. For the replacement main event, Shiozaki defeated Rikio by pinfall to win the vacated championship. Saito and his family were harassed for his role in Misawa&#x27;s death, although the deceased&#x27;s family did not hold him responsible for the incident, and Noah officials called to stop the harassment. Saito later admitted to suicidal ideation during this period.

A private funeral was held on June 18, with around 100 people in attendance. While much of the Noah roster could not attend due to a Nagoya show, many wrestlers still attended the ceremony, including Kawada, and Motoko Baba was also present. Kobashi, Taue, Ogawa, Shiozaki, Marufuji, Asako, Kotaro Suzuki, and Ippei Ota were the pallbearers. On July 4 at Differ Ariake, Noah held a public ceremony at which Tokumitsu spoke. Despite the 27 °C (80.6 °F) temperature, this event, for which they had anticipated an attendance of 5,000 people, attracted a line of 26,000 people which stretched for 2.4 kilometers. Meltzer reported that this was the second most-attended public funeral for a Japanese athlete (only surpassed by the April 17, 1999, ceremony for Giant Baba at Budokan, attended by 28,000 people), and possibly (at the time) the fourth-most attended public funeral for an athlete in history.

At a stockholders&#x27; meeting held the next day, Taue was named Noah president, and Kobashi and Marufuji were promoted to vice presidents. While Misawa had intended to groom Marufuji to eventually take his place, he arranged for Taue to succeed him in the event that he was unavailable. The power struggle in the wake of his death caused demoted Vice President Mitsuo Momota, who had co-founded AJPW alongside his brother Yoshihiro and Giant Baba when they left the JWA and had gone with Misawa during the Noah exodus, to quit. Momota himself had said that he believed the company&#x27;s biggest star should be the president, and had pushed for Kobashi to become a vice president. However, he did not expect to lose his own position in the process, and demotion to counselor after Taue&#x27;s promotion left Momota with no political power. Kobashi and Akiyama attempted to dissuade him, but Momota tendered his resignation to Taue on July 7. Momota&#x27;s role was taken over by Haruka Eigen, and a power struggle for control of the company between Kobashi, who felt that the company should remain loyal to its talent, and Ryu Nakata, who believed cuts were necessary in Noah&#x27;s financial state, ended in Nakata&#x27;s favor. Eigen and Nakata were implicated in the yakuza-related &quot;black money&quot; scandal whose fallout would affect Noah in 2012.

Misawa&#x27;s death caused several wrestling promotions to work toward a stronger approach to regulating professional wrestling in the country. On what would have been his 47th birthday, June 18, Hiroshi Hase organized a meeting towards this end with the heads of NJPW (Naoki Sugabayashi), AJPW (Keiji Mutoh), and Noah (business head Ryu Nakata) in attendance, as well as Yoshirō Mori, Kenshiro Matsunami, and Shinobu Kandori. While the unified regulating body favored by Mutoh did not come to exist, these talks did have some positive effects.

<doc id="1286899" wikidata="Q1550199" url="?curid=1286899" title="Iranian toman">
<text>The Iranian toman (, pronounced ; from Turko-Mongolian &quot;tümen&quot; &quot;unit of ten thousand&quot;, see the unit called tumen) is a superunit of the official currency of Iran, the rial. One toman is equivalent to 10 (old), or 10,000 (new, official) rials.

Originally, the toman consisted of 10,000 dinars. Between 1798 and 1825, the toman was also subdivided into eight rials, each of 1,250 dinars. In 1825, the qiran was introduced, worth 1,000 dinars or one-tenth of a toman. In 1932, the rial replaced the qiran at par, with one toman being equal to 10 rial. Colloquially, the toman is more used than the rial.

==Coins==
Iranian gold coins were denominated in toman, with copper and silver coins denominated in dinar, rial or qiran. During the period of hammered coinage, gold toman coins were struck in denominations of , , 1, 2 and 10 toman, and later , 3 and 6 toman. With the introduction of milled coinage in AH1295, denominations included , , 1, 2, 5, 10, and 25 toman. The last gold toman were issued in 1965, well after the toman had ceased to be an official Iranian currency.

==Banknotes==

In 1890, the Imperial Bank of Persia introduced notes in denominations of 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 toman. These notes were issued until 1923. In 1924, a second series was introduced, consisting of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 toman notes which were issued until the rial was introduced in 1932. The higher-denomination notes were subject to frequent counterfeiting. Currently, since the value of the toman has fallen so much the standard banknotes are 1,000; 2,000; 5,000; 10,000; 50,000; and 100,000 Rial notes.

===German-issued World War I occupation notes===

During World War I, a group of German and Turkish soldiers occupied a small portion of Iran until 1918. They circulated five different denominations of German Imperial Treasury notes (printed around 1905) with a red overprint in Persian that were used locally at the rate of 4 marks to 1 toman. In addition to the 12 qiran 10 shahi (5 mark) and 25 qiran (10 mark) notes pictured, the rest of the issue included: 5 tomans (on a 20 mark-note), 25 tomans (on a 100 mark-note), and 250 tomans (on a 1,000 mark-note). Wilhelm Wassmuss appears to be given credit for the occupation and issue of currency.
==Status==

On 7 December 2016, the Iranian government approved a call by the Iranian central bank to replace the Iranian rial with the more colloquially and historically known toman denomination. In early 2019, following the hyperinflation of the rial, the central bank made a new proposal, suggesting the currency be redenominated by introducing a new toman with a value of 10 rials.

In July 2019, the Iranian government approved a bill to change the national currency from the rial to the toman with one new toman equalling 10,000 rials, a process that would reportedly cost $160 million. The proposal would see the new toman divided into 100 qirans. This proposal was approved by the Iranian parliament in May 2020. The changeover was expected to be phased in for up to two years.

<text>Pleasurewood Hills is a theme park on a site between Corton and Gunton, near Lowestoft, Suffolk.

==History==
The park was created by entrepreneur Joe Larter in 1983 as a small American-themed family attraction, containing a miniature railway, Cine 180 and adventure playground. Yearly expansion brought the addition of new attractions and general improvements. Controlling interest in the park was sold to RKF, a property development company, in the late 1980s. RKF built attractions including two Sea Life centres (Great Yarmouth &amp; Hunstanton), a Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not (Great Yarmouth seafront) and the Bure Valley Railway (in Aylsham). It started building a second Pleasurewood Hills style park in Cleethorpes. RKF went bankrupt in early 1991 and its attractions were sold. Some Pleasurewood management staff took control of The Bygone Village at Fleggburgh.

Noel Edmonds converted the Haunted Theatre into Crinkley Bottom Castle in the mid-1990s. The park also featured appearances by Mr Blobby and Edmonds himself.

The park continued in this vein until 1996–1997, when it was bought by Leisure Great Britain, a caravan park operator. It owned the park until 2000, when Peter and Peggy Hadden, who had been connected with the park for many years, bought it. The name changed to New Pleasurewood Hills. In 2000 the park bought Magic Mouse.

In 2004, Grévin &amp; Cie, a French leisure group, purchased the site. The name reverted to its original form and in early 2005 the owners said they would spend £3 million on improvements.

Changes included repainting and renaming a number of rides, but the first major investment was in the park&#x27;s first inverting coaster, Wipeout, from the closed American Adventure. The old cars were scrapped and new ones bought from Walibi World.

In 2009 the Mellow Yellow log flume was repainted and had a revamped entrance. It is now called Timber Falls. In 2010 the park put a StreetDance show in the Castle Theatre. In 2010 the park appointed a new manager.

On 30 January 2011, it was announced that the park had been sold to a new company. , in partnership with industry expert Laurent Bruloy, purchased seven leisure parks, including Pleasurewood Hills, from across Europe. The seven parks will benefit from a joint investment of around £1.7million over 5 years. This included the addition of 5 new attractions for the 2012 season and another 4 a year later.

<doc id="1286913" wikidata="Q1388487" url="?curid=1286913" title="Reverse DNS lookup">
<text>In computer networks, a reverse DNS lookup or reverse DNS resolution (rDNS) is the querying technique of the Domain Name System (DNS) to determine the domain name associated with an IP address – the reverse of the usual &quot;forward&quot; DNS lookup of an IP address from a domain name. The process of reverse resolving of an IP address uses PTR records. rDNS involves searching domain name registry and registrar tables. The reverse DNS database of the Internet is rooted in the .arpa top-level domain.

Although the informational RFC 1912 (Section 2.1) recommends that &quot;every Internet-reachable host should have a name&quot; and that &quot;for every IP address, there should be a matching PTR record,&quot; it is not an Internet Standard requirement, and not all IP addresses have a reverse entry.

== Historical usage ==
The modern &quot;reverse DNS lookup&quot; should not be confused with the now-obsolete &quot;inverse query&quot; (IQUERY) mechanism specified in :
The IQUERY message type was always &quot;optional&quot; and &quot;never achieved widespread use&quot;; it was &quot;permanently retired&quot; in 2002 with the adoption of .

== Implementation details ==
=== IPv4 reverse resolution ===
Reverse DNS lookups for IPv4 addresses use the special domain codice_1. In this domain, an IPv4 address is represented as a concatenated sequence of four decimal numbers, separated by dots, to which is appended the second level domain suffix codice_2. The four decimal numbers are obtained by splitting the 32-bit IPv4 address into four octets and converting each octet into a decimal number. These decimal numbers are then concatenated in the order: least significant octet first (leftmost), to most significant octet last (rightmost). It is important to note that this is the reverse order to the usual dotted-decimal convention for writing IPv4 addresses in textual form.

For example, to do a reverse lookup of the IP address the PTR record for the domain name codice_3 would be looked up, and found to point to codice_4.

If the A record for codice_4 in turn pointed back to then it would be said to be forward-confirmed.

==== Classless reverse DNS method ====
Historically, Internet registries and Internet service providers allocated IP addresses in blocks of 256 (for Class C) or larger octet-based blocks for classes B and A. By definition, each block fell upon an octet boundary. The structure of the reverse DNS domain was based on this definition. However, with the introduction of Classless Inter-Domain Routing, IP addresses were allocated in much smaller blocks, and hence the original design of pointer records was impractical, since autonomy of administration of smaller blocks could not be granted. RFC 2317 devised a methodology to address this problem by using CNAME records.

=== IPv6 reverse resolution ===
Reverse DNS lookups for IPv6 addresses use the special domain codice_6 (previously codice_7). An IPv6 address appears as a name in this domain as a sequence of nibbles in reverse order, represented as hexadecimal digits as subdomains. For example, the pointer domain name corresponding to the IPv6 address is codice_8.

=== Multiple pointer records ===
While most rDNS entries only have one PTR record, DNS does not restrict the number. Multiple PTR records are used, for example, when a web server supports many virtual hosts i.e. multiple hostnames then resolve to a single address, and multiple hostnames will be returned for a PTR lookup for that shared address. However, DNS lookups typically occur over UDP, and since UDP has a limited message size, in extreme cases, multiple PTRs could cause a DNS response to exceed those UDP limits.

=== Records other than PTR records ===
Record types other than PTR records may also appear in the reverse DNS tree. For example, encryption keys may be placed there for IPsec, SSH and IKE. DNS-Based Service Discovery uses specially-named records in the reverse DNS tree to provide hints to clients about subnet-specific service discovery domains. Less standardized usages include comments placed in TXT records and LOC records to identify the geophysical location of an IP address.

== Uses ==
The most common uses of the reverse DNS include:

* The original use of the rDNS: network troubleshooting via tools such as traceroute, ping, and the &quot;Received:&quot; trace header field for SMTP e-mail, web sites tracking users (especially on Internet forums), etc.
* One e-mail anti-spam technique: checking the domain names in the rDNS to see if they are likely from dialup users, or dynamically assigned addresses unlikely to be used by legitimate mail servers. Owners of such IP addresses typically assign them generic rDNS names such as &quot;1-2-3-4-dynamic-ip.example.com.&quot; Some anti-spam filters assume that email that originates from such addresses is likely to be spam, and may refuse connection.
* A forward-confirmed reverse DNS (FCrDNS) verification can create a form of authentication showing a valid relationship between the owner of a domain name and the owner of the server that has been given an IP address. While not very thorough, this validation is strong enough to often be used for whitelisting purposes, since spammers and phishers usually cannot achieve forward validation when they use zombie computers to forge domain records.
* System logging or monitoring tools often receive entries with the relevant devices specified only by IP addresses. To provide more human-usable data, these programs often perform a reverse lookup before writing the log, thus writing a name rather than the IP address.

<text>Hermione Youlanda Ruby Clinton-Baddeley (13 November 1906 – 19 August 1986) was an English actress of theatre, film, and television. She typically played brash, vulgar characters, often referred to as &quot;brassy&quot; or &quot;blowsy&quot;. She found her milieu in revue, in which she played from the 1930s to the 1950s, co-starring several times with English actress Hermione Gingold.

Baddeley was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (1959) and a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot; in 1963. She portrayed Mrs. Cratchit in the 1951 film &quot;Scrooge&quot; and Ellen the Maid in the 1964 Disney film &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. She voiced Madame Adelaide Bonfamille in the 1970 Disney animated film, &quot;The Aristocats&quot;. In 1975, she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Series for her portrayal of Nell Naugatuck on the TV series &quot;Maude&quot;.

==Early life==
Baddeley was born in Broseley, Shropshire, to W.H. Clinton-Baddeley and Louise Bourdin, who was French. Baddeley was a descendant of British American War of Independence General Sir Henry Clinton. Her elder sister, Angela Baddeley, was also an actress. Her half-brother, William Baddeley, was a Church of England clergyman who became Dean of Brisbane and Rural Dean of Westminster.

An early stage appearance came in 1923 when she appeared in Charles McEvoy&#x27;s play &quot;The Likes of Her&quot; in London&#x27;s West End.

==Career==

Baddeley was known for supporting performances in such films as &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949), &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; and &quot;Scrooge&quot; (both 1951), &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1952), &quot;The Belles of St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1954), &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (as Ellen, the maidservant), and &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; (both 1964), although she first began making films back in the 1920s. One of her more important roles was in &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; (1948), in which she played Ida, one of the main characters, whose personal investigation into the disappearance of a friend threatens the anti-hero Pinkie.

Baddeley also had numerous stage credits. She had a long professional relationship with Noël Coward, appearing in many of his plays throughout the 1940s and 1950s. The most successful was her teaming with Hermione Gingold in Coward&#x27;s comedy &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;, though the two women were reportedly &quot;no longer on speaking terms&quot; by the end of the run. 

Baddeley was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Simone Signoret&#x27;s best friend in Jack Clayton&#x27;s &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (1959). With 2 minutes and 19 seconds of screen time, her role is the shortest ever to be nominated for an Academy Award. In 1960 she played prostitute Doll Tearsheet in the BBC&#x27;s series of Shakespeare history plays &quot;An Age of Kings&quot;, acting alongside her sister Angela as Mistress Quickly. In 1963, she was nominated for Broadway&#x27;s Tony Award as Best Actress (Dramatic) for &quot;The Milk Train Doesn&#x27;t Stop Here Anymore&quot;.

She was known to American audiences for roles in &quot;Bewitched&quot;, &quot;The Cara Williams Show&quot;, &quot;Camp Runamuck&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, &quot;$weepstake$&quot;, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, and &quot;Maude&quot; (playing the title character&#x27;s second housekeeper, Nell Naugatuck). Toward the end of her career, Baddeley was also a voice-over actress, including roles in &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; (1982).

==Personal life==
In 1928 Baddeley married English aristocrat and socialite David Tennant (third son of Edward Tennant, 1st Baron Glenconner). She arrived an hour late for the wedding, having misremembered the time booked for the ceremony. They rented Teffont Evias Manor, which became known for their boisterous parties (including mixed naked bathing in the goldfish pond). She had a daughter, Pauline Laetitia Tennant (born 6 February 1927 – died 6 December 2008); the couple divorced in 1937.

In 1940 Baddeley married Major John Henry (&quot;Dozey&quot;) Willis, of the 12th Lancers, son of Major-General Edward Willis, Lieutenant Governor of Jersey. They divorced in 1946. She had a relatively brief relationship with actor Laurence Harvey, 22 years her junior. Although Harvey proposed marriage to her, Baddeley thought the age difference was too great and declined.

Baddeley was known for her devotion to animals. She dedicated her autobiography, &quot;The Unsinkable Hermione Baddeley&quot;, to her pet dog. She continued to work in film and television until shortly before the end of her life.

She died on 19 August 1986, aged 79, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles following a series of strokes. Her remains were returned to the United Kingdom.

<text>Interstate 295 (I-295) in Delaware, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania is an auxiliary Interstate Highway, designated as a bypass around Philadelphia, and a partial beltway of Trenton. 

The route begins at the interchange with I-95 south of Wilmington, and runs to an interchange with I-95 in Bristol Township, Pennsylvania. The highway heads east from I-95 and crosses the Delaware River into New Jersey on the Delaware Memorial Bridge, running concurrently with US 40. Upon entering New Jersey, I-295 runs concurrently with the New Jersey Turnpike and US 40 for a brief until splitting away at exit 1 and runs parallel to the turnpike for most of its course in the state. After a concurrency with US 130 in Gloucester County, I-295 has an interchange with I-76 and Route 42 in Camden County. The freeway continues northeasterly towards Trenton, where it interchanges with I-195 and Route 29 before bypassing the city to the east, north, and west, crossing the Delaware River on the Scudder Falls Bridge into Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, I-295 is signed as an east–west road and heads south to its other terminus at I-95. I-295 is one of two auxiliary Interstates in the US to enter three states, the other being the I-275 beltway around Cincinnati, which enters Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky.

Three portions of I-295 predate the Interstate Highway System: the Delaware Memorial Bridge and its approach, built in 1951; a section in Salem County, built in 1953; and the part concurrent with US 130, built in two sections that opened in 1948 and 1954. The route was designated on these sections in New Jersey in 1958 and in Delaware in 1959. The portion of I-295 connecting to I-95 in Delaware opened in 1963 while most of the route in New Jersey was finished by the 1980s. The part of I-295 near the interchange with I-195 and Route 29 was finished in 1994. I-295 previously ended in New Jersey at US 1 in Lawrence Township, becoming I-95 heading south into Philadelphia. By July 2018, I-295 was extended along the former I-95 in New Jersey and Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to end at I-95 at the Pennsylvania Turnpike, with no access between I-295 and the latter road. In addition to the extension of I-295, now at , it became the longest signed interstate in New Jersey, surpassing I-80. Improvements continue to be made to the highway, including reconstruction of interchanges and replacement of bridges.

==Route description==
I-295 begins at I-95, I-495, US 202, and DE 141 near Newport, Delaware, and heads east over the Delaware River on the Delaware Memorial Bridge into New Jersey. The highway intersects the southern terminus of the New Jersey Turnpike and runs northeast through suburban areas of South Jersey parallel to the turnpike, providing a bypass of Philadelphia and Camden. I-295 turns north and bypasses Trenton to the east and turns west at the interchange with US 1 in Lawrence. The route heads west around the north side of Trenton, crosses the Delaware River on the Scudder Falls Bridge into Pennsylvania, and heads south to its terminus at I-95 in Bristol Township. The portion of I-295 running through New Jersey is sometimes referred to as the Camden Freeway by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). As part of the Interstate Highway System, the entire length of I-295 is a part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

===Newport to Westville===

I-295 begins at an interchange with I-95, I-495, US 202, and DE 141 south of the town of Newport in New Castle County, Delaware. The northbound beginning of I-295 has direct ramps from both directions of I-95, southbound I-495, and southbound DE 141, while the southbound end of I-295 has direct ramps to both directions of I-95, northbound I-495, and northbound DE 141. From this junction, the highway heads southeast on an eight-lane freeway maintained by the Delaware Department of Transportation that passes to the northeast of suburban neighborhoods in Wilmington Manor. I-295 passes over the Jack A. Markell Trail and reaches an interchange with US 13/US 40 in Farnhurst. Here, US 40 splits from US 13 by heading east concurrent with I-295. At this interchange, the highway becomes maintained by the Delaware River and Bay Authority. The road has an eastbound ramp to Landers Lane before it passes between residential neighborhoods and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with DE 9 north of the city of New Castle. This interchange provides access to Veterans Memorial Park, where a war memorial honoring veterans from Delaware and New Jersey is located. Past DE 9, the median of the freeway widens to include the DRBA headquarters, with direct access to and from the southbound lanes while northbound access is provided by way of DE 9. After this, the southbound lanes of I-295 have a toll plaza for the Delaware Memorial Bridge. I-295/US 40 continues east and passes over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s New Castle Secondary railroad line before crossing the Delaware River on the twin-span Delaware Memorial Bridge.
Upon reaching the east bank of the Delaware River, I-295/US 40 begins a brief concurrency with the New Jersey Turnpike and enters Pennsville in Salem County, New Jersey, heading east-southeast through industrial areas. The freeway comes to an interchange with the southern terminus of US 130 and the western terminus of Route 49. Here, I-295 splits onto its own freeway maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation while US 40 continues along the New Jersey Turnpike for a short distance before it splits to the southeast. A short distance later, the roadway enters Carneys Point and CR 551 merges onto I-295, with the four-lane freeway heading northeast. The highway comes to a junction with Route 140, where CR 551 splits from I-295 by continuing east along Route 140. I-295 heads into wooded areas and features a rest area in the northbound direction. The freeway continues northeast and comes to a northbound weigh station before it reaches the Route 48 exit. The highway runs through a mix of farmland and woodland and enters Oldmans Township, where it comes to an interchange providing access to Straughns Mill Road (CR 643).
I-295 crosses the Oldmans Creek into Logan Township in Gloucester County and passes near some residential development and Pureland Industrial Complex as it comes to the Center Square Road (CR 620) exit. The road crosses the Raccoon Creek and reaches an interchange serving US 322. Following this, the highway runs through agricultural and wooded areas before northbound US 130 merges into the freeway.

At this point, I-295 and US 130 head east as a six-lane freeway with a narrow median and soon come to the Repaupo Station Road (CR 684) exit. Continuing east, the freeway crosses into Greenwich Township and has an interchange with Tomlin Station Road (CR 607). After passing near Greenwich Lake, there are exits for Paulsboro-Swedesboro Road (CR 653) and Democrat Road (CR 673) within a short distance of each other. I-295/US 130 reaches an interchange with Harmony Road (CR 680) on the border of Greenwich Township and East Greenwich Township. The road runs through a portion of East Greenwich Township before crossing back into Greenwich Township and coming to an interchange with Berkley Road (CR 678) and Cohawkin Road (CR 667) on the border of Greenwich Township and Paulsboro.

Past this point, the freeway runs through marshy areas of Mantua Creek and continues into West Deptford. Here, there is an exit for Mantua Grove Road (CR 656). Passing near more industrial areas, I-295/US 130 has an interchange with Mid-Atlantic Parkway, which provides access to Route 44 as well as to Grove Street (CR 643) and Jessup Road (CR 660). Continuing northeast, the freeway passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Penns Grove Secondary railroad line and reaches an interchange with Route 44 and Delaware Street (CR 640). At this point, Route 44 begins to parallel I-295/US 130 on its northwest side as the two roads cross the Woodbury Creek. Route 44 ends at a cul-de-sac that has a ramp from the southbound direction of I-295/US 130 prior to another exit that provides access to Red Bank Avenue (CR 644). The freeway passes near some homes before US 130 splits from I-295 at an interchange that also has access to Hessian Avenue (CR 642). The median of I-295 becomes wider again and it continues east through woods, coming to a southbound exit and northbound entrance with Route 45. The roadway passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Vineland Secondary railroad line and passes through a small strip of Deptford before it has a partial interchange with CR 551, with a southbound exit and northbound entrance. The highway enters Westville and skirts near residential and commercial development, with another southbound exit and northbound entrance serving Route 47.

===Bellmawr to Lawrence Township===

I-295 crosses the Big Timber Creek into Bellmawr in Camden County and runs northeast, with a northbound exit to southbound Route 42 and a southbound entrance from northbound Route 42, before it comes to the interchange with the North–South Freeway, which serves as the northern terminus of Route 42 and the eastern terminus of I-76. At this point, the travel lanes of I-295 head north for a short distance along the outside of the North–South Freeway, with the northbound lanes of I-295 having access from northbound Route 42 and eastbound I-76 and access to westbound I-76 while the southbound lanes of I-295 having access from eastbound I-76 and access to southbound Route 42. Past this, I-295 continues east as a six-lane freeway through wooded areas near suburban development, passing under Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Grenloch Industrial Track line before reaching an interchange with Black Horse Pike (Route 168). The highway heads east along the border between Haddon Heights to the north and Barrington to the south and passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line before reaching the interchange with White Horse Pike (US 30) near its intersection of Clements Bridge Road/Highland Avenue (Route 41/CR 573).

The road fully enters Barrington before crossing into Lawnside, where it comes to a southbound exit and northbound entrance serving Warwick Road (CR 669). After this, I-295 curves northeast and passes through a corner of Tavistock before entering a part of Haddonfield and coming to a trumpet interchange providing access to Woodcrest Station along the PATCO Speedline. At this point, the road becomes closely parallel to the New Jersey Turnpike to the southeast. The highway crosses into Cherry Hill and passes over the tracks carrying the PATCO Speedline and NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line before it reaches the Haddonfield-Berlin Road (CR 561) exit. The roadway runs through wooded areas with suburban neighborhoods to the west and the New Jersey Turnpike to the east as it comes to a cloverleaf interchange at Route 70. Past this, the highway curves north farther west from the turnpike.

I-295 enters Mount Laurel in Burlington County upon crossing Pennsauken Creek and runs northeast through woods near development, reaching a cloverleaf interchange with Route 73 that provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike to the east. Past this, the road passes east-northeast near commercial areas to the southeast of Moorestown Mall before curving northeast to closely follow the turnpike. The highway runs through wooded areas and encounters the interchange with Route 38. The roadway passes over Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Pemberton Industrial Track line and Marne Highway (CR 537) and runs through a mix of fields and trees with occasional development, with an exit serving Creek Road (CR 635). I-295 crosses the Rancocas Creek into Westampton and runs through an area of warehouses, where it has a cloverleaf interchange at Rancocas-Mount Holly Road (CR 626). The highway runs north through rural land with nearby buildings and enters Burlington Township. Here, the road curves northeast and comes to a cloverleaf interchange at Burlington-Mount Holly Road (CR 541) that provides access to a commercial area along with the New Jersey Turnpike. The freeway runs through woodland and heads into Springfield Township, where it passes a pair of closed rest areas in each direction. I-295 crosses the Assiscunk Creek into Florence and heads through a mix of farm fields and trees before it enters Mansfield Township and comes to a cloverleaf interchange at Florence-Columbus Road (CR 656) that provides access to nearby Columbus Road (CR 543). The highway passes over the Pearl Harbor Memorial Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) and continues through rural land into Bordentown Township, where a northbound exit and southbound entrance serves Rising Sun Road that provides access to US 206 and the New Jersey Turnpike. Past this, the road curves north and reaches the exit for US 130 west of Bordentown before passing through woodland and crossing over NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line.

I-295 crosses the Crosswicks Creek into Hamilton in Mercer County and runs through woods and marshland a short distance east of the Delaware River. A scenic overlook of the river is located along the southbound side of the road; access from the northbound lanes is provided by a pedestrian bridge over the highway. The freeway heads farther from the river and passes over the River Line again before it reaches a modified cloverleaf interchange serving the western terminus of I-195 and the southern terminus of Route 29 to Trenton. Following this junction, the road heads northeast near residential neighborhoods and comes to an interchange at Arena Drive (CR 620) that provides access to nearby White Horse Avenue (CR 533). A short distance later, a southbound exit and northbound entrance provides access to northbound Olden Avenue (CR 622). I-295 continues through wooded areas with nearby development and curves north to come to an interchange at Route 33 and Hamilton Avenue (CR 606). The next interchange is a southbound exit and northbound entrance at East State Street (CR 535). The highway continues through woods and reaches a cloverleaf interchange serving Sloan Avenue (CR 649). The roadway comes to a bridge over Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor railroad line and crosses into Lawrence Township, where it curves northwest and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with US 1.

===Lawrence Township to Bristol Township===

West of US 1, the freeway passes commercial areas. I-295 comes to a partial cloverleaf interchange at Princeton Pike (CR 583), before coming to a southbound ramp to Franklin Corner Road (CR 546). Continuing west, the road reaches a cloverleaf interchange with US 206. I-295 has a northbound exit and southbound entrance serving Federal City Road, before leaving Lawrence and entering Hopewell Township. The median of the freeway widens as it runs near suburban residential areas; this is where the Somerset Freeway would have begun, had it been built. Upon entering Hopewell Township, the median narrows.

I-295 turns southwest past suburban development containing some farmland. It reaches the interchange with Route 31 and passes through Ewing before returning to Hopewell Township, crossing under CSX Transportation&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision railroad line. The next interchange along the route provides access to Scotch Road (CR 611) and Trenton–Mercer Airport via a cloverleaf interchange. After Scotch Road (CR 611), the highway crosses back into Ewing Township and passes to the northwest of the airport. An interchange with Bear Tavern Road (CR 579) also serves Trenton–Mercer Airport. The freeway comes to the interchange with Route 29 that also has a northbound entrance from Route 175. At this point, maintenance of the road changes from the New Jersey Department of Transportation to the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission, and I-295 widens from six to eight lanes. Immediately after the interchange with Route 29, I-295 then crosses the Delaware River into Pennsylvania on the tolled Scudder Falls Bridge. At the state line, I-295 transitions from a north–south road to an east–west road, with the northbound direction turning into the westbound direction upon crossing into Pennsylvania and the eastbound direction turning into the southbound direction upon crossing into New Jersey.
Upon crossing the Delaware River, I-295 becomes the Delaware Expressway and enters Lower Makefield Township in Bucks County, passing over PA 32 and reaching an electronic toll gantry in the westbound direction. After crossing the Delaware Canal, I-295 reaches an interchange with Taylorsville Road, which provides indirect access to PA 32, to the north of Yardley, and narrows to six lanes. Here, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation takes over maintenance of the road. At this interchange, the route changes cardinal directions, with northbound becoming westbound and eastbound becoming southbound. I-295 continues west-southwest near suburban residential areas and features a westbound rest area and weigh station. The freeway turns to the south and reaches the interchange with PA 332 that serves Newtown to the west, narrowing again to four lanes. I-295 continues south near some farmland before passing near more homes with some commercial development. The freeway comes to a bridge over SEPTA&#x27;s West Trenton Line and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision before it crosses into Middletown Township and comes to a cloverleaf interchange with US 1. Immediately after this interchange, I-295 passes over Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Morrisville Line and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Fairless Branch as it curves southwest, heading northwest of commercial development and the Oxford Valley Mall. The freeway makes a curve to the south and becomes parallel to SEPTA&#x27;s West Trenton Line and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision to the west, passing under PA 213 without an interchange. The railroad tracks split to the west and I-295 reaches a diamond interchange with Bus. US 1/PA 413 to the east of Penndel. Following this interchange, the freeway crosses the Mill Creek and runs south-southeast near suburban residential areas as it heads west of Levittown. I-295 enters Bristol Township and terminates at an interchange with I-95 at the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276). At this interchange, I-295 merges into southbound I-95, with access from westbound I-295 to southbound I-95 and from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-295; there are no ramps connecting I-295 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

==History==

In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 39 was legislated to begin at the Yardley–Wilburtha Bridge and bypass Trenton to the north and east before continuing south to Hammonton along present-day US 206. Route 39, which was not built around Trenton, was decommissioned in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering.

===Original construction===
Portions of I-295 in Salem and Gloucester counties predate the Interstate Highway System as part of freeway bypasses for the surface section of US 130/Route 44 through Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville. In 1948, the first section of the US 130/Route 44 bypass in Gloucester County between current exits 21 and 24 opened, with a second section between exits 14 and 21 opening in 1954. The section of the present highway between the New Jersey Turnpike and the present-day CR 618 bridge was built as part of the US 130 bypass of Carneys Point in 1953. The concurrent Route 44 designation was removed from US 130 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering and was later assigned to the former surface alignment of US 130 through Carneys Point and between Bridgeport and Westville. In 1958, the US 130 bypass of Carneys Point and the freeway in Gloucester County was designated as part of I-295.

Construction on the Delaware Memorial Bridge began in 1949. At the same time, work was underway on the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach in Delaware, a divided highway which would begin at a directional T interchange with US 13/US 202 in Farnhurst and head east to a cloverleaf interchange at New Castle Avenue (present DE 9) before leading to the bridge. Construction on the US 13/US 202 interchange at Farnhurst began on July 12, 1950. On August 16, 1951, the Delaware Memorial Bridge opened to traffic. The Delaware Memorial Bridge and the approach road to US 13/US 202 became a part of US 40 following the opening of the bridge. I-295 was designated onto the New Jersey approach of the bridge in 1958. That same year, construction began for a bridge at the Farnhurst interchange that would link the US 40 approach to the Delaware Memorial Bridge to the Delaware Turnpike that was proposed to run west to the Maryland state line. A year later, the Farnhurst interchange and the bridge approach were upgraded to Interstate Highway standards, and it was designated as part of I-295. Construction at the interchange connecting to the Delaware Turnpike at Farnhurst was completed in July 1961. On November 14, 1963, the Delaware Turnpike opened to traffic, with I-295 extended west (south) to I-95 at the northern terminus of the Delaware Turnpike, which continued south as I-95. In the middle of 1964, work began on a second span at the Delaware Memorial Bridge due to increasing traffic volumes. The second span of the bridge was opened to traffic in late 1968.
The remainder of I-295 through New Jersey was planned as Federal Aid Interstate Route 108, which was created by the New Jersey Department of Transportation in 1956. I-295 was built between Big Timber Creek and Route 42 in 1958. In 1960, the section of the Interstate between Route 42 and Warwick Road was finished. The highway was built between US 130 and Route 45 in 1960 and was extended east to the Big Timber Creek a year later. In 1963, I-295 was completed between Warwick Road and just south of Route 70. A year later, the roadway was extended north to Route 73. The freeway was built between Route 73 and Route 38 in 1966. In 1968, the section of I-295 between Carneys Point and Bridgeport was finished. Following the completion of this section, US 130 reverted to its previous surface alignment through Carneys Point, replacing that portion of Route 44. In 1972, the highway was finished between Route 38 and CR 541. I-295 was extended from CR 541 northward to US 130 near Bordentown a year later. I-295 was completed from US 1 west to a proposed interchange with I-95 in Hopewell Township in 1974. In 1975, the roadway was constructed from south of the Route 33 interchange north to US 1. The section of I-295 between Arena Drive and south of Route 33 was finished in 1984. In 1987, I-295 was built between I-195/Route 29 and Arena Drive, with the highway between I-195/Route 29 and Route 33 opened to traffic on August 16 of that year. The final section of I-295 between US 130 in Bordentown and I-195/Route 29 was finished in 1994.

===Since completion===
At its original northern terminus, the freeway continued west as I-95 toward the Scudder Falls Bridge while I-95 was proposed to head north along the Somerset Freeway. In 1983, the Somerset Freeway portion of I-95 was canceled as a result of community opposition. In the 1990s, the northern terminus of I-295 was moved to the US 1 interchange in Lawrence Township, with the route west of there replaced by an extended I-95. Due to the cancelation of the Somerset Freeway, a gap existed along I-95 in New Jersey. To bridge the gap, motorists from northbound I-95 were directed to follow I-295 southbound and I-195 eastbound to reach the New Jersey Turnpike to continue north along I-95, and vice versa.
In 1995, the southbound rest area along I-295 in Burlington County was named for radio personality Howard Stern. Governor Christine Todd Whitman named the rest area after Stern as payback for him granting Whitman airtime during her 1993 gubernatorial campaign. A plaque proclaiming the rest area as the &quot;Howard Stern Rest Stop&quot; was installed, with an image of Stern poking his head from an outhouse. Days after the plaque was installed, it was stolen and later mailed to Stern. In 2003, the rest areas along I-295 in Burlington County were closed as part of funding cuts in Governor Jim McGreevey&#x27;s budget, saving the state $1 million a year.
In 2004, reconstruction was competed to the portion between exit 32 and exit 40. Sound walls were also installed along the rest of the road.

I-295, like many other highways in New Jersey, once had solar-powered emergency callboxes every mile (); the use of the callboxes became limited due to the increasing popularity of cellphones. To save on maintenance costs, the New Jersey Department of Transportation removed these callboxes in 2005.

An improvement of exit 19 was completed in 2009.
In preparation for the completion of the first stage of the interchange between I-95 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bristol Township, the former route was truncated from New Jersey to the site of the interchange. In its place, I-295 was extended, ending at the unfinished interchange. The New Jersey Department of Transportation NJDOT and the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission completed Phases 1 and 2 of the redesignation in March 2018, extending the route from US 1 in Lawrence Township across the Scudder Falls Bridge to Taylorsville Road in Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation finished Phase 3 in July of the same year, signing their section as east–west despite its north–south alignment to avoid a change in direction from north to south on the same route. Between September 2005 and May 2015, New Jersey and Pennsylvania intended to extend I-195 around Trenton instead of I-295. This would have also truncated I-295 to its interchange with I-195 and Route 29. However, in 2015, plans changed once again to extend I-295. This was because of guidelines set by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, which state that auxiliary Interstates with an odd-numbered first digit should only connect with their parent route once. Since the extended route would have two junctions with the parent route (I-95), a route number with an even-numbered first digit was considered more appropriate.

On September 22, 2018, the first stage of the interchange opened, allowing for I-95 to be routed onto the Pennsylvania Turnpike to connect to the New Jersey Turnpike, truncating the eastern terminus of I-276 to the new interchange and completing I-95 from Miami to the Canadian border. However, there remains no access between I-295 and the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276), nor between I-295 westbound and I-95 northbound and vice versa. The next stage of the project will complete the movements at the interchange.

In early 2015, the Delaware River and Bay Authority began a project to reconstruct southbound I-295 between US 13/US 40 and I-95/I-495. The first phase, which took place between early 2015 and late 2016, reconstructed and repaved the left lanes of southbound I-295, reconstructed and repaved the right side of the ramps to US 13/US 40, I-495, and northbound I-95, and closed the ramp from northbound US 13 to southbound I-295 and built a new loop ramp. The second phase, which took place between 2016 and 2017, reconstructed and repaved the right lanes of southbound I-295, completed construction on the ramps from southbound I-295, and built a tunnel carrying the Jack A. Markell Trail under I-295. The final phase, which took place between 2017 and 2018, reconstructed the ramp from southbound US 13 to southbound I-295, removed the former ramp from northbound US 13 to southbound I-295, and reconstructed the left lane and shoulder on the ramps from southbound I-295 to I-95.

The structurally deficient Scudder Falls Bridge, that carried I-295 over the Delaware River between Lower Makefield Township, Pennsylvania, and Ewing, New Jersey, was in need of a replacement. Construction on a dual-span replacement bridge began in April 2017. The first span opened to Pennsylvania-bound traffic on July 10, 2019, and opened to New Jersey-bound traffic on July 24. Demolition of the original span commenced right after and construction of the second new span began afterwards, which opened in August 2021. The new bridge has six through-traffic lanes (three in each direction), acceleration and deceleration lanes, shoulders, and a shared bicycle and pedestrian path. Additionally, the two adjoining interchanges with Route 29 and Taylorsville Road were reconstructed. Previously a toll-free crossing, on July 14, 2019, an electronic toll was instituted for Pennsylvania-bound traffic, payable using E-ZPass or toll by plate.
NJDOT had also announced another project to address the missing connections between I-295 and Route 42 to provide an easier connection between the Philadelphia metro area and points south to Atlantic City and vice versa. This project, dubbed the I-295/Route 42 Missing Moves, would provide connections from I-295 northbound to Route 42 southbound and Route 42 northbound to I-295 southbound by constructing two ramps just south of the I-295/I-76/Route 42 interchange. Construction began in March 2020, and the ramps opened to traffic on November 28, 2023.

On August 5, 2024, construction will begin to build an additional northbound lane for I-295 between the I-95 and US 13/US 40 interchanges. This project will provide a third lane for I-295 at the exit from I-95. This lane is being built to reduce traffic congestion along this stretch of road, which often backs up onto I-95. Construction is planned to be completed in the later part of 2025.
In 2013, the New Jersey Department of Transportation broke ground on a project to construct a straighter roadway for I-295 near the Route 42 interchange. This project, dubbed the I-295/I-76/Route 42 Direct Connection, will reconstruct the dangerous and congested Route 42/I-295/I-76 interchange, which currently requires traffic on I-295 to use ramps that merge onto the North–South Freeway for a short distance, among a series of other indirect connections. In 2007, &quot;Alternative D&quot; for the reconstructed interchange was selected, calling for I-295 to cross over the North–South Freeway. This interchange was projected to cost $900 million (equivalent to $ in ). The project is being constructed in four phases and was originally scheduled to be complete in 2021. However, delays in construction, including the collapse of a retaining wall on March 25, 2021, pushed the expected completion date to 2028.

<text>Interstate 295 (I-295) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway within New York City. Measuring in length, I-295 originates at NY 25 (Hillside Avenue) in Queens, running north across Queens and over the tolled Throgs Neck Bridge, to Bruckner Interchange, a junction with I-95, I-278, I-678, and the Hutchinson River Parkway in the Bronx. From south to north, I-295 intersects the Grand Central Parkway, I-495 (Long Island Expressway), and the Cross Island Parkway in Queens before crossing the Throgs Neck Bridge and splitting with I-695 (Throgs Neck Expressway). In Queens, I-295 is also known as the Clearview Expressway, and in the Bronx, parts are known as the Throgs Neck Expressway and the Cross Bronx Expressway Extension.

The entirety of I-295 was proposed in 1955 as a part of I-78. Construction started in 1957, and the highway opened in 1963 with the I-78 designation. Originally, plans called for I-78 to be extended southeastward from Holland Tunnel in Manhattan to NY 878 (Nassau Expressway) in Queens, before curving north to meet the Clearview Expressway. These plans were canceled in 1970, at which point the highway between NY 25 in Queens and I-95 in the Bronx was re-designated as I-295. I-295 was originally planned to continue further south to John F. Kennedy International Airport. The JFK Expressway, constructed in the 1980s, was intended to be part of I-295 but was constructed only as far north as the Belt Parkway.

==Route description==
The existing section of the Clearview Expressway that carries the I-295 designation begins at the unfinished interchange with NY 25 where the ramps from westbound NY 24 (212th Street) and eastbound Hollis Court Boulevard merge into the northbound and southbound lanes, respectively, of the highway. The Queens section of this roadway is known as &quot;The 77th Infantry Division Expressway&quot;. The Queens expressway instantly runs beneath a stack interchange with the Grand Central Parkway before immediately entering Cunningham Park. The Clearview Expressway leaves Cunningham Park at the Clearview Interchange, where it meets the Long Island Expressway (now I-495).

Shortly north of the I-495 interchange, the northbound offramp and southbound onramp at NY 25A split, then run under a pedestrian bridge that connects 46th Avenue. Other pedestrian bridges cross over the highway near 42nd Avenue and at 33rd Avenue. The northbound exit 5 uses 206th Street as a de facto service road, while 207th Street is used in the same way for the northbound onramps. Real service roads run beneath the Port Washington Branch of the Long Island Rail Road to connect NY 25A and 35th Avenue (exit 6A). The service roads merge into the expressway north of 26th Avenue (exit 6B).

The northbound partial interchange with Willets Point and Bell boulevards leads to Cross Island Parkway, while a southbound interchange leads to the southbound Cross Island Parkway, all before reaching the Throgs Neck Bridge. The expressway then crosses the bridge.

After the Throgs Neck Bridge toll gantry in the Bronx, I-295 briefly becomes part of the Throgs Neck Expressway. Just north of the tollbooth is northbound access to Harding and Pennyfield avenues. The exit is right next to the Y interchange with I-695, with the Throgs Neck Expressway following I-695 to northbound I-95. I-295 beyond I-695 then becomes part of the Cross Bronx Expressway. The only other interchange between there and the terminus is Randall Avenue.

I-295, running northwest, gains service roads for a mile until it finally ends at its parent route at the Bruckner Interchange, but only includes access to southbound I-95, and I-278.

==History==

=== Planning ===
The Clearview Expressway, Throgs Neck Expressway and Cross Bronx Expressway Extension were proposed in 1955 by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA) as part of the PANYNJ&#x27;s Joint Study of Arterial Facilities, in order to connect with the planned Throgs Neck Bridge. The Throgs Neck Expressway and Cross Bronx Expressway Extension was planned to connect the bridge to several highways at the Bruckner Circle (now the Bruckner Interchange), while the Clearview Expressway was intended to connect with Horace Harding Boulevard/Long Island Expressway in order to serve motorists from Long Island.

Initially, the Clearview Expressway was intended to run along the existing right-of-ways of Utopia Parkway and Francis Lewis Boulevard. An alternate proposed routing would have run along Little Neck Bay and through Alley Pond Park, essentially parallel to the Cross Island Parkway. By September 1956, the Clearview Expressway was mapped along 206th and 207th streets and Hollis Court Boulevard, east of Francis Lewis Boulevard, after community opposition. The reroute reduced the number of properties to be demolished or relocated from 860 to 421. An information center was set up by the TBTA for local residents displaced by the expressway.

The planning of the Clearview Expressway route by Robert Moses is documented in Robert Caro&#x27;s biography of Moses, &quot;The Power Broker&quot;. A passage describes Moses and TBTA officials surveying potential routes for the highway in Queens, accidentally coming across protesters against the expressway. Caro writes that rather than being deterred by the protests, Moses &quot;laughed and laughed&quot; according to one aide&#x27;s account.

=== Construction and opening ===
Construction on the Clearview Expressway and Throgs Neck Bridge began in September 1957. As part of the project, land was taken from Clearview Park, the defunct Bayside Golf Course, and Cunningham Park. Meanwhile, hundreds of homes were physically relocated from the path of the expressway. Many of these houses were placed in planned communities built on the sites of the Bayside Golf Course and the Oakland Country Club in Oakland Gardens. The Cross Bronx Expressway Extension, Throgs Neck Expressway, the Throgs Neck Bridge, and the portion of the Clearview Expressway north of 73rd Avenue in Queens were opened on January 11, 1961.

An extension of the Clearview south to Hillside Avenue (now NY 25) was opened to traffic on August 12, 1963. It was the first of several highways built to serve the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Because of the steep hill at the end of the expressway leading to Hillside Avenue, the junction quickly became a frequent spot for accidents. This led to the implementation of a speed limit at the end of the highway, which remains in effect. This section of the route is a notorious speed trap. The modern Bruckner Interchange was opened on January 4, 1972.

=== Post-opening ===

The Cross Bronx Expressway Extension, Throgs Neck Expressway and the Clearview Expressway were originally designated as part of I-78, which was to continue south from Hillside Avenue through southeast Queens, and west across Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan to the Holland Tunnel. Under these plans, the Clearview would have been extended south to NY 27 (Conduit Avenue) and the Belt Parkway, or to the Nassau Expressway and Rockaway Boulevard, in Laurelton near John F. Kennedy International Airport. Later plans had the Clearview Expressway ending farther east, intersecting with the Belt Parkway at its interchange with the Southern State Parkway. A 1968 proposal from the Regional Plan Association had the Clearview Expressway extension running southeast along 212th Street/Hollis Court Boulevard and Hempstead Avenue, then south along the right-of-ways of the Cross Island and Belt parkways before ending at the Nassau Expressway. Ultimately, nearly all sections of I-78 between the Holland Tunnel and Hillside Avenue, including the Lower Manhattan Expressway, Bushwick Expressway, and the Clearview Expressway extension were canceled by Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1971. The only portion to be constructed was the short section of the Nassau Expressway near John F. Kennedy International Airport. This resulted in the renumbering of all of I-78 north of Hillside Avenue to I-295 on January 1, 1970.

There have been proposals during the 21st century to extend the Clearview Expressway south to feed into the JFK Expressway via a tunnel. The JFK Expressway had been built as part of a costly overhaul of John F. Kennedy International Airport that began in the late 1980s. The JFK Expressway south of the Nassau Expressway and 150th Street was completed around 1986 and it was fully completed by 1991.

In February 2003, the Clearview Expressway was renamed &quot;The 77th Infantry Division Expressway&quot;. The name honors the US Army&#x27;s 77th Infantry Division of World War I and World War II fame. Raised from draftees from New York City and Long Island, the 77th was also known as the Statue of Liberty Division, due to its shoulder-sleeve insignia.

<text>Interstate 295 (I-295), also known as the Fayetteville Outer Loop, is a partially completed Interstate-grade planned bypass around the western side of Fayetteville, North Carolina, United States. , it stretches for from US Highway 401 (US 401) in western Fayetteville to I-95 and US 13 near Eastover. The final section between US 401 and I-95 near Parkton is being constructed in segments and is expected to be completed around 2026. A segment from I-95 east of Parkton to Camden Road west of Hope Mills is signed as North Carolina Highway 295 (NC 295). NC 295 was also used as temporary designations for the highway before I-295 was signed.

==Route description==

The open segment of NC 295 begins in Robeson County between Parkton and Hope Mills. A trumpet interchange at I-95 is the southern terminus of the interim southern segment. NC 295 heads northwest, having a diamond interchange with roundabouts at Parkton Road, exit 2, before crossing into Cumberland County. Passing over the CSX Railway&#x27;s South End Subdivision and Brisson Road on a bridge, the highway then curves to the north, having another interchange at Black Bridge Road, exit 4, with a similar layout to exit 2. The highway briefly continues north before curving west around Upchurches Pond before meeting the northern terminus of the interim southern segment at a diamond interchange with Camden Road.

I-295 begins at US 401 (Raeford Road), running north to the All-American Freeway, then running east to Bragg Boulevard, where it is then part of a concurrency with NC 24 and NC 87 until Murchison Road. Heading further east, it connects with US 401 again at Ramsey Street, before crossing the Cape Fear River and connecting with River Road before ending at its northern terminus at I-95/US 13, near Eastover. The entire route is a divided four-lane highway with a maximum speed limit of . Exit numbers along the route match NC 295 milemarkers added in 2014 when previous signage designating the route Future I-295 were removed and replaced with NC 295 signs, both along the loop itself and at the loop&#x27;s interchange with I-95.

===Dedicated and memorial names===
I-295 has two dedicated stretches of freeway.

* The Airborne and Special Operations Highway: Official North Carolina name of I-295 from I-95 to Raeford Road. Approved in July 2014 and dedicated on August 16, 2014, at the Airborne &amp; Special Operations Museum.
*Lyndo Tippett Highway: Official North Carolina name of I-295 from I-95 to Ramsey Street. Approved May 2019 and dedicated on October 10, 2019.

==History==
The future designation of the Fayetteville Outer Loop as I-295 was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in May 2005 following an earlier approval by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Signs designation &quot;Future I-295&quot; were put up along the route when the section between I-95 and River Road was opened in July 2005. The first short section of this highway had opened earlier in June 2003, and it extended only from River Road to US 401. Then, the only mentions of a highway number were on street signs at the entrance ramps that said I-295 (with an additional &quot;&quot; on some). In May 2019, the FHWA officially added the then open of NC 295 to the Interstate System, this follows up on approval by AASHTO late 2018. The North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) may have received a waiver since two parts of it (namely the bridge that crosses the Cape Fear River and its interchange with I-95) are not quite up to Interstate Highway standards.
Construction on the next section of I-295, located from US 401 to the All American Freeway, was scheduled to start in the later months of 2008, and then probably completed by early 2012, but this construction project was put on hold in November 2008 due to the severe shortage of money for highway construction in North Carolina at that time and extending though 2011. Instead of constructing this segment as one contract, work was split up into three smaller segments. Work first started in 2009 on the section from Bragg Boulevard (NC 24) to Murchison Road (NC 210) using federal stimulus monies. This was completed in 2014. In March 2011, a contract to construct the portion of the loop between US 401 and Murchison Road was awarded to a construction company; however, this did not include final paving. The contract for paving was issued in 2014 and is scheduled to be completed during mid-2016, delayed from April 2014.

On August 4, 2014, a new section of the Fayetteville Outer Loop opened between Murchison Road and Bragg Boulevard. Considered critical in relieving congestion around Fort Bragg, this section traverses eastbound along collector–distributor lanes between the two exits, while westbound uses an actual stretch of the freeway. Signage along this stretch reflected a rerouting of NC 24/NC 87. On August 11, 2016, a new section opened between Murchison Road and Ramsey Street, connecting the two existing segments of the Fayetteville Outer Loop together. Another segment continuing the Loop to All American Freeway was opened on December 2, 2016.

The remainder of the route from All American Freeway south to I-95 near Parkton is to be completed in segments, with construction starting between 2018 and 2020 with the loop not scheduled to be totally complete until around 2025. Governor Pat McCrory announced in December 2015 that the remaining segments would now be funded under changes to the state&#x27;s method of apportioning transportation funds. These changes were approved by the NCDOT Board in January 2016. On November 25, 2019, a segment opened between the All American Freeway and Cliffdale Road. On August 19, 2020, a segment between Cliffdale Road and US 401 (Raeford Road) was opened to traffic. On November 21, 2022, a orphaned segment between Parkton Road and Black Bridge Road signed as NC 295 opened to traffic. The final contract, which covered the route between US 401 and Camden Road, was awarded to Civil Branch in the summer of 2022. Construction of this segment has begun with NCDOT setting the completion date to May 15, 2026. Once this segment opens, I-295 will be completed in its entirety. The first part of this section, between Black Bridge Road and Camden Road, as well as between Parkton Road and I-95 South, opened to traffic on July 10, 2024.

===Route number changes===

The Fayetteville Outer Loop has had a variety of actual and proposed highway designations over the years. Its first proposed Interstate designation, rejected by AASHTO in 2003, was I-195. Other earlier designations have included extensions of US 13 (in some newspaper articles) or as NC 24. It was signed as Future I-295 from 2005 to 2014, which also appeared on state maps from 2006 to 2012.

On July 23, 2011, NCDOT designated the Fayetteville Outer Loop as NC 295. The circumstances for the rule change cited was necessary for public safety and welfare. This marks its official establishment, six years after the first section of the new freeway was completed. On January 15, 2019, the FHWA approved the I-295 designation between All American Freeway and I-95/US 13 after NCDOT completed two design changes that were acceptable. Effective that same day, NC 295 was decommissioned in favor of I-295.

On April 21, 2020, NC 295 was reestablished in an encore designation between Cliffdale Road (Secondary Road 1400 [SR 1400]) and All American Expressway (SR 1007). The reason for its reintroduction is that Interstate designations must end at a National Highway System route. Lasting only a few months, it officially changed over to I-295 on August 17, 2020, upon connection to US 401 (Raeford Road).

The orphaned segment of highway opened on November 21, 2022. It is signed as NC 295 per signage at the Parkton Road interchange. On July 10, 2024, a section between Parkton Road and I-95 South was opened to traffic. This included a section from Camden Road to Black Bridge Road, bringing the total length to .

<text>Interstate 295 (I-295) is a auxiliary Interstate Highway in the US state of Maine from I-95 in Scarborough to I-95 in West Gardiner. The highway was designated the Richard A. Coleman Highway in 2015 by the Maine Legislature. The highway serves as a bypass of Lewiston–Auburn and serves the Portland metropolitan area. It takes a more direct route between Portland and Augusta, the state capital, than its parent I-95. It also is toll-free, unlike I-95, which carries the tolled Maine Turnpike.

==Route description==

I-295 branches off from exit 44 of I-95 (Maine Turnpike) providing access to downtown Portland, Maine, and then generally follows the Atlantic coast and Kennebec River until it merges back into I-95 in West Gardiner to the north at exit 103.

After splitting from I-95, I-295 has a toll plaza just before its own exit 1. I-295&#x27;s first exit is in South Portland, giving access to The Maine Mall (southbound) and South Portland and Scarborough (northbound). At exit 4, US Route 1 (US 1) joins I-295, and the two highways run concurrently for the next . After crossing the Fore River, the highway passes through downtown Portland, which can be accessed via exits 4 through 8. North of the downtown area, I-295 crosses the Tukey&#x27;s Bridge over the Back Cove, after which US 1 departs at exit 9. Running parallel with US 1, I-295 meets the eastern terminus of Falmouth Spur at exit 11 in the town of Falmouth, with a southbound exit and northbound entrance. After passing through Yarmouth and Freeport, exit 28 provides access to the town of Brunswick, where US 1 turns east away from I-295. Continuing north, the highway&#x27;s last exit is exit 51, which gives access to Gardiner. After a toll plaza, I-295 merges back with I-95, which heads north toward Augusta. As an Interstate Highway, all of I-295 is included in the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==

===1960 to 2004===
In 1960, Tukey&#x27;s Bridge was completed. It was named for Lemuel Tukey, a tavern owner and toll collector for the Back Cove Bridge in the late 18th century. The Falmouth Spur of the Maine Turnpike to Yarmouth opened the next year, in 1961.

Additional urban sections opened through Portland in 1971. This was followed in 1973 by the opening of I-295 through Brunswick to Topsham, then in 1974 by the opening of the section from the Maine Turnpike in Scarborough to South Portland. The section from Topsham to Gardiner opened in 1977.

===2004 extension===
In 2004, to clear up confusion, I-95 was redesignated to continue along the Maine Turnpike for its entire length. I-295 was extended past the Falmouth Spur as a redesignation of I-95, to where it merges back into the turnpike in West Gardiner to the north. The long Falmouth Spur officially became I-495 but was left unsigned.

At the same time, the exits were renumbered; previously they had been numbered more or less sequentially from south to north—there were skipped numbers, for example, there was no exit 23. After the changes the exits renumbered to mile-log in relation to the Scarborough junction, except for the exits in Portland and South Portland, which remained the same. Exits on I-95 in Maine were similarly renumbered based on mileage.

===Speed limits===
The speed limit on I-295 on the section past Tukey&#x27;s Bridge to mile 51 in Gardiner was raised from on May 27, 2014. This occurred as the result of a new law passed in 2013 by the Maine Legislature allowing the Maine Department of Transportation (MaineDOT) to set speed limits on Interstate highways with the approval of the Maine State Police, instead of appealing to the Legislature. The speed limit was reverted from for a length of from the section past Tukey&#x27;s Bridge to Topsham on March 27, 2017.

===Naming===
In 2015, the Maine Legislature unanimously voted to name the highway&#x27;s entire length for Richard A. Coleman, a MaineDOT employee since 1956, who has been involved with many Maine transportation projects. He was involved in projects ranging from Maine&#x27;s Interstates to the Penobscot Narrows Bridge and Observatory. Coleman declined comment on the naming, only telling the &quot;Kennebec Journal&quot; that while the naming is humbling, he found it uncomfortable. Maine Senator Roger Katz, the sponsor of the bill, said &quot;Very few people have heard of Dick Coleman, but as he drives around the state, he must feel a great deal of pride looking at his decades of work.&quot;

==Emergency routes==
In 2019, MaineDOT began signing emergency routes along roads near I-295. The routes generally lead from one exit to the next exit and are meant to be used when sections of the highway must be closed due to an accident or other disruption. In such an event, electronic signs will be activated and flaggers deployed to direct drivers to use the appropriate emergency route to lead them around the closure and maintain traffic flow. Northbound routes are designated with a single letter, while southbound routes are designated with double letters. This system was first used when a section of highway was closed due to the death of a Maine State Trooper in an accident.

<text>Interstate 295 (I-295), sometimes called the Providence Beltway, is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in the US states of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. It is maintained by the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (RIDOT) and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT). Spanning nearly , it forms a western beltway around Providence, Rhode Island, and is a bypass of I-95 as it travels through the capital city. I-895 was proposed as a complementary eastern beltway to complete a full loop around the city in the 1960s but was ultimately scrapped in the 1980s.

The southern terminus of I-295 is at its split from I-95 in Warwick, Rhode Island. Among several state highways, it intersects with US Route 6 (US 6) in Johnston, Rhode Island, and US 44 in Smithfield, Rhode Island, before entering North Attleborough, Massachusetts, from Cumberland, Rhode Island. It intersects with US 1 in North Attleborough before arriving at its northern terminus as it merges into I-95 in Attleboro. I-295 is the first highway in Rhode Island to convert to an exclusive mileage-based exit numbering system, having transitioned from a sequential numbering system in 2017. Exit signs north of the interchange with US 6 previously included both milemarkers and exit numbers before being replaced in 2007.

===Rhode Island===
I-295 serves as a partial circumferential highway around Providence, bypassing the city to the west and north. The southern terminus of I-295 is located in Warwick (I-95 exit 28A). The complex interchange involves access between I-95, I-295, and Route 113, which is labeled exit 1A (the interchange with I-95 is unnumbered). Immediately after this interchange, I-295 crosses the Pawtuxet River and passes Warwick Mall, which lies on a property outlined by the interchange and the two highways. The mall is accessed via exit 1B, which provides partial access to Route 2 (northbound I-295 exits to northbound Route 2, while southbound I-295 exits to southbound Route 2). Exits 3A and 3B provide access to Route 37 within the city of Cranston. Exit 6 for Route 14 is next, known locally as Plainfield Pike, which defines the border between Cranston and Johnston. Exit 7 provides access to a local industrial park. There is a complex interchange with US 6 and US 6A in Johnston, labeled exits 9A, 9B, and 9C, which involves near overlap between US 6 and I-295 (US 6 uses the collector–distributor lanes along the side of I-295 briefly, and access from US 6 westbound to I-295 southbound requires the use of a special double-loop ramp at exit 9B). A diamond interchange (exit 10) with Route 5 is the last exit in Johnston, and the highway enters Smithfield and immediately has a cloverleaf interchange (exits 12A and 12B) with US 44. After another cloverleaf interchange (exits 15A and 15B) with Route 7, the highway begins a gentle curve eastward toward Massachusetts. Within the town of Lincoln, I-295 meets Route 146 (exits 18A and 18B). There are two interchanges in the town of Cumberland, being Route 122 (exit 20) and Route 114 (exit 22).

===Massachusetts===
Entering Massachusetts in the town of North Attleborough, there is a cloverleaf interchange (exits 2A and 2B) with US 1 before reaching its northern terminus (locally eastbound) in Attleboro at exits 4A and 4B with I-95.

==History==


In the mid-1950s, the state of Rhode Island introduced plans to build a beltway around Providence, then known as Relocated Rhode Island Route 5 for inclusion in the Interstate Highway System. A modified version of this plan was accepted, with another modification done in 1960 resulting in a planned alignment. Construction began in 1964, and the original route was completed by 1975. The original intention was to have I-295 act as a full ring road around the Providence metropolitan area with the alignment roughly following Rhode Island Route 37 across Narragansett Bay and continuing in a northern direction with a major interchange located at I-195 exit 2 in Swansea, Massachusetts, before heading west toward Attleboro. Due to opposition from communities in the proposed alignment, cancelation occurred in 1982.

The original alignment of I-84 called for an east–west right-of-way from the Rhode Island and Connecticut state line (Willimantic, Connecticut, and Foster, Rhode Island) to Johnston, Rhode Island, through the Scituate Reservoir. The connection with I-295 was planned as a full interchange with flyover ramps. Due to fears of runoff affecting the Scituate Reservoir, this alignment of I-84 was canceled. This interchange (exits 9A, 9B, and 9C) currently acts as multiplex for US 6 with a partial interchange with Rhode Island Route 10 further down US 6. The ramp that was originally going to be used to merge onto I-84 west from I-295 north has been converted to a turnaround ramp (exit 9B) from I-295 north to I-295 South.

==Exit list==
In 2016, it was announced that both Rhode Island and Massachusetts interchanges were to receive new exit numbers based on route mileage in accordance with federal standards. Massachusetts was scheduled to start in 2016, though the project was indefinitely postponed in mid-2016. On November 18, 2019, MassDOT confirmed the project will begin in late summer 2020. Massachusetts exits were renumbered over two nights on January 3–4, 2021. Rhode Island exits were renumbered from November 27, 2017, to December 8, 2017.

<text>Interstate 295 (I-295) is a highway which runs eastward and northward bypass of the cities of Richmond and Petersburg in the US state of Virginia. The southern terminus is an interchange with I-95 southeast of Petersburg. I-295 then has an interchange with I-64 east of Richmond, crosses I-95 north of Richmond, and continues westward to its other terminus at a second interchange with I-64.

==Route description==


I-295 serves as a bypass route around downtown Richmond for both I-64 and I-95. It also performs crossover duty for travelers between Washington DC (reached by I-95) and southeastern Virginia (reached by I-64) and links many of Richmond&#x27;s suburbs (such as Short Pump, Mechanicsville, Highland Springs, Varina, and Hopewell). Much of the highway has a posted speed limit of .

The highway begins at I-95 exit 46, south of Petersburg in unincorporated Prince George County with two lanes in each direction. Exit 3 provides access to US Route 460 (US 460), the most direct route from Petersburg to the Hampton Roads area. At exit 9 (State Route 36 [SR 36]), the road widens to three lanes in each direction. Exit 15 provides access to SR 10, a major arterial that connects Hopewell to Hampton Roads. Exit 16 provides access to the Meadowville Technology Parkway immediately before the road crosses the James River on the Varina-Enon Bridge, built in 1990 and the second major cable-stayed bridge in the US. Exit 22 provides access to SR 5, a mostly scenic route between Richmond and Williamsburg. Exit 25 is for SR 895, a short toll connector to I-95 that also provides access to Richmond International Airport. The massive exit 28 provides access to both I-64 and US 60. The exit complex features two-lane collector–distributor lanes and runs longer than . 

North of exit 28, the road widens to four lanes in each direction and bends to the northwest. Exit 31 is for SR 156 and northern access to Richmond International Airport. Exit 34 is for a local road, Creighton Road (SR 615). Exit 37 provides access to US 360. Exit 38 is for SR 627, which carries the local names Pole Green and Meadowbridge roads. Exit 41 is for US 301 and SR 2. Another large interchange complex (exit 43) marks the junction with both I-95 and US 1. The road reduces again to three lanes as it bends slightly to the southwest. Exit 45 is for Woodman Road, exit 49 is for US 33, and exit 51 is for Nuckols Road. I-295&#x27;s northern terminus is at exit 53 with I-64. The northernmost of the route are not signed with directional signs, as the compass direction of the route is slightly southwest–northeast, in contravention of the nominal direction of the rest of the route.

All of the exits are cloverleafs with the exceptions of: its southern terminus I-95 (exit 1), Meadowville Technology Parkway (exit 16), SR 895 (exit 25), and the northern terminus with I-64 (exit 53).

Additionally, as the road&#x27;s primary purpose is to direct long-distance travel away from Downtown Richmond, control cities on guide signs for the road include cities such as Washington DC, Charlottesville, and Rocky Mount, North Carolina, as destinations. However, the highway goes to none of those cities, but instead uses such destinations to direct long-distance travelers away from the congested areas in Downtown Richmond and Petersburg. In the 1990s, Miami, Florida, was also listed as a control city on some guide signs north of Richmond, but these have been removed or changed.

<text>Interstate 295 (I-295) also known as the Anacostia Freeway, is a auxiliary Interstate Highway in the US state of Maryland and in Washington, D.C.. It connects I-95/I-495 and Maryland Route 210 (MD 210; Indian Head Highway) near the Potomac River (just outside DC&#x27;s boundary with Maryland) to I-695 and District of Columbia Route 295 (DC 295) in the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

===Maryland===

Although I-295 technically begins at the Capital Beltway (I-95/I-495), a pair of mainline ramps connects the southern terminus of the route to the nearby MD 210. Continuing north from this interchange, I-295 enters the District of Columbia; the route is only long in Maryland.
===District of Columbia===
Passing to the west and north of Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm, the route parallels the Potomac River, running through the Southeast quadrant of DC. It passes close to Shepard Parkway and forms the eastern boundary of Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling. Near the southern end of Anacostia Park, the route turns east and begins to parallel the Anacostia River, interchanging with South Capitol Street near the latter&#x27;s crossing of the river.

Within the park, I-295 encounters the junction with I-695 (which heads northwest across the 11th Street Bridges) and DC 295 at exit 4. At this junction, I-295 ends, and the mainline freeway through the interchange assumes the identity of DC 295 and continues to Baltimore, though it changes identities several times: DC 295, MD 201, the Baltimore–Washington Parkway (an unnumbered federally owned expressway operated by the National Park Service), and MD 295.

==History==
The Anacostia Freeway was first conceived by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission in 1950 as a connector route between the Baltimore–Washington Parkway at Kenilworth Avenue and the Capital Beltway near Oxon Hill. The route would provide access to the Anacostia waterfront, which included Bolling Air Force Base (Bolling AFB) and Naval Support Facility Anacostia (NSF Anacostia). In 1955, DC officials approved the portion of the route between Suitland Parkway and East Capitol Street; the remainder of the route was approved in 1956. 

In 1958, the southern portion of the route, from the beltway to the 11th Street Bridges, became a part of the Interstate Highway System and the route was designated I-295 by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO).
I-295 opened in pieces. The first section was from the Beltway to S. Capitol Street, and the final section of the route, the from S. Capitol Street to the Pennsylvania Avenue interchange, opened on August 7, 1964. The final part of the project, the connecting ramps to the 11th Street Bridges, opened the following year. In 1990, a section of connecting ramps was built to directly connect I-295 to MD 210 in order to remove the significant traffic flow between the two routes from the segment of the beltway between both interchanges. These ramps are not considered part of the mainline of I-295.

Under the 1971 DC freeway plans, I-295 would have turned east at the northern end of the 11th Street Bridges and followed the Southeast Freeway as far as East Capitol Street, where it would turn north and follow the East Leg of the Inner Loop freeway. The East Leg, six lanes wide, would have curved around the far eastern edge of the downtown area, passing beneath Mt. Olivet Road in a half-mile () tunnel, before terminating at I-66 and I-95 north of Washington Union Station, providing access to the North Leg Freeway, the North Central Freeway, and the New York Avenue Industrial Freeway.

As part of the larger Woodrow Wilson Bridge reconstruction project, the southern terminus of I-295 has been significantly rebuilt. Several new connections have been constructed to link the beltway, MD 210, and I-295 with the new National Harbor site on the shore of the Potomac River in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. One feature of the interchange reconstruction is that accommodations were made for future ramps to proposed high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV) on the beltway. This project was completed in stages, starting in 2008 and ending in 2011.

The cancelation of both the remainder of the Southeast Freeway and then the Barney Circle Freeway left no through connections between the 11th Street Bridges and DC 295 north, leading to severe congestion and major traffic routing problems. These missing movements were included when the northern terminus was reconstructed, allowing direct freeway-grade access to and from DC 295 at the 11th Street Bridges as well as providing a through grade-separated north–south route within DC. Project construction began in 2011 and the ramps opened in 2012. I-295 now terminates at the interchange with the 11th Street Bridges. I-695 extends over the 11th Street Bridges and continues along the Southeast Freeway to the interchange with I-395.

==Future==

The District of Columbia is considering adding reversible HOV lanes to I-295.

<text>Whitmell Pugh Tunstall (April 15, 1810 – February 19, 1854) was a lawyer and state legislator in Chatham, Virginia. He was the long-time advocate most responsible for the creation of the Richmond and Danville Railroad which was completed in 1856.

==Biography==
Whitmell Pugh Tunstall was born in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. He was educated at Danville Academy and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

A railroad was a revolutionary idea in the 1830s, which had the confidence of very few people at the time. However, the greatest opposition in the southern portion of Virginia came from those along the Roanoke River who ran the Roanoke Navigation Company and its system of canals. They feared a rival in the transportation business.

A lawyer by profession, Tunstall was admitted to the Virginia State Bar in 1832. He was a member of the Railroad Convention that met at Danville, October 5, 1835, and at Richmond June 11, 1836.

Tunstall served in the Virginia General Assembly in both houses. He was a delegate in the House of Delegates from 1836 to 1841, a senator in the State Senate in 1841 and 1842, and a delegate again from 1845 to 1848.

On April 13, 1838, he introduced a bill to charter the Richmond and Danville Railroad (R&amp;D) with an impassioned speech. No action was taken at that time, and he was to fight tirelessly for creation of the R&amp;D in the Virginia legislature for almost a decade. It was not until 1845 that petitions were again introduced. Finally, after a struggle of nine years, the charter was granted on March 9, 1847. Records reveal Tunstall&#x27;s dedication to the cause in this statement made to a friend, &quot;Tis the proudest day of my life, and I think I may now say that I have not lived in vain.&quot;

Whitmell Pugh Tunstall died on February 19, 1854, of typhoid fever, 2 years before the railroad he had long sought was completed.

==Posthumous honors==
Pittsylvania County has had several schools named in his honor. Founded in 1878 as a two-room school, in 1918 the Whitmell Farm-Life School became the first rural consolidated school in Pittsylvania County.

In 1964, Whitmell High School and Brosville High School were merged to form Tunstall High School.

Two Virginia Historical Markers were established relating to Whitmell P. Tunstall:
*Whitmell P. Tunstall (L-48) marker is located about one mile south of Chatham in Pittsylvania County. It is on the east side of U.S. Highway 29 at Tightsqueeze just south of the Fairview Road intersection. The marker text reads &quot;One mile east stands Belle Grove, the home of Whitmell Pugh Tunstall (1810-1854). Educated at Danville Academy and the University of North Carolina, Tunstall was admitted to the bar in 1832. He served in the House of Delegates (1836-1841; 1845-1848) and the Senate of Virginia (1841-1842). As a delegate representing Pittsylvania County, he fought for a decade to charter the Richmond and Danville Railroad (part of the present-day Norfolk Southern Railway). He served as the company&#x27;s first president from 1847 until his death. Tunstall is buried at Belle Grove. Department of Historic Resources, 1993&quot;
*Whitmell School (U-38) marker reads &quot;Founded in 1878 as a two-room school and named for state senator Whitmell P. Tunstall, in 1918 the Whitmell Farm-Life School became the first rural consolidated school in Pittsylvania County. Sarah Archie Swanson Beverly, who between 1916 and 1951 taught there and served as principal, believed that &quot;the country school must be the center of community life.&quot; Under her leadership, Whitmell School attained that goal as a model progressive school. In 1920, the National Conference on Rural Education and Country Life was held here, followed in 1923 by the Virginia Rural Life Conference, which Gov. E. Lee Trinkle and U.S. Sen. Carter Glass addressed.&quot;

<text>The Philips Stadion () is a football stadium in Eindhoven, Netherlands. As the home of PSV Eindhoven (Philips Sport Vereniging), it is therefore also known as PSV Stadion. With a capacity of 35,119, it is the third-largest football stadium in the country. Established as the Philips Sportpark, it was constructed as a sports field for Philips employees in 1910. The Philips Elftal played football matches from 1911 until 1913, when the team was succeeded by PSV. Since 1913, PSV has used the original ground as its home stadium.

The stadium has gone through several extensions in its history: after a wooden stand in 1916, seating and standing places slowly enclosed the field throughout the first decades. Two extensive renovations in the 1970s and 1990s first created a covered stadium, and then a two-tiered ground with extensive commercial spaces. The completion of the four corners in 2002 eventually led to its current capacity.

The Philips Stadion currently holds a four-star rating by UEFA. It has hosted a range of Netherlands national team fixtures since 1971. In 2013, PSV&#x27;s reserve team, Jong PSV, also played their league matches at the stadium. They now play their games at the training complex De Herdgang. Furthermore, the Philips Stadion was the location for three UEFA Euro 2000 group stage matches, as well as the 2006 UEFA Cup Final. Aside from football-related purposes, the ground is occasionally used for music concerts.

== History ==

=== First decades ===

In 1910, the Philips company erected new houses to serve the growing need for employee housing. The area, fittingly named Philipsdorp (&quot;Philips Village&quot;), was built on walking distance from the Philips factories and located (at that point) in the outskirts of Eindhoven. Urban planner Gerrit Jan de Jongh envisaged a village green in the center, creating a space for leisure and sports. In this green, a football field, a korfball field and a bandstand were planned. The area was named the Philips Sportpark. Meanwhile, Philips founded a football team for its young employees, named Philips Elftal. Their first match marks the first recorded use of the Philips Sportpark: on 15 January 1911, the Philips Elftal won their debut match against Hollandia from Woensel. The Philips Elftal continued to play at the field for two seasons; in 1913 the team was succeeded by PSV, who also took the Philips Sportpark as their home ground. PSV&#x27;s first official home game was the Eindhoven derby against EVV on 10 October 1915.

In its first years, the field did not include any seating space for spectators. This changed in 1916, when the first wooden stand was built, providing room for 550 viewers. The stand was funded by Philips, which was celebrating its 25th anniversary that year. Later, the stand was replaced by a new main stand in 1933, providing seating space for 900 spectators. Five years later, during PSV&#x27;s twenty-fifth anniversary, a scoreboard was installed in the stadium. The board was a gift by the official PSV fan union. In 1941, PSV decided to build stands across the entire ground. The decision was made to create an oval shape with a running track between field and stands, enabling the possibility for athletic, cycling and ice skating matches. After completion, the capacity rose to 18,000. During World War II, the ground was claimed by German occupants and used for military purposes. The final days of World War II witnessed great destruction in the city of Eindhoven and also to the stadium itself. Repairs were duly made.
In 1953, the main stand was refurbished and extended, creating space for a press room and meeting spaces. Also, a memorial was revealed, commemorating the war victims. In 1958, the running track was removed, making space for a bigger field. New stands are built as well, increasing the capacity to 22,000. Four 40-meter high floodlights were installed by Philips in the stadium in the same year, making evening matches possible. The lights were inaugurated on April 9 with an exhibition match against RSC Anderlecht. A complete renovation of the stadium started in 1969. After its completion in 1977, the stadium was completely enclosed and every seat was covered. The main (south) stand peaked above the other stands. The capacity rose to 26,500, of which 12,000 were for standing spectators. The renovated ground was celebrated with a match against Leeds United. Earlier, the ground was used by the Netherlands national football team for the first time. On November 17, 1971, the Netherlands played a qualifying match for the 1972 UEFA European Championship against Luxembourg (8–0).

=== Upgrade to two-tiered stadium ===
In April 1987, cracks in the south stand were discovered. The damage was caused by an alkali–silica reaction. PSV chairman Jacques Ruts decided to rebuild the stand, and simultaneously provide more space for business relations and sponsors. Up until then, the stadium only offered regular spectator seats. Ruts got inspired by the way American stadiums had built luxury boxes and used them for business opportunities. After the renovation (which costed 40 million guilders), the new south stand was two-tiered, with 830 VIP-seats behind glass in the middle. Also, new offices, a press room, a youth hall and a restaurant were created. The opening of the stand was celebrated with an exhibition match against Milan on 17 August 1988. Two years later, the ground changed its name from Philips Sportpark to Philips Stadion.
In the nineties, the other stands were also raised to the level of the south stand. The west and east stand were expanded in 1993, and the north stand in 1996. After completion, the seating capacity reached 30,000. Until then, the fanatic part of the PSV support would be located on the so-called L-side on standing terraces. After the renovations in the nineties, the standing terraces disappeared and the fanatic fans moved to the east stand. The renovations in the 1990s were in time for UEFA Euro 2000, held in the Netherlands and Belgium. The Philips Stadion hosted three group matches: Portugal beat England, 3–2; Sweden and Turkey ended in a goalless draw; and Italy beat Sweden, 2–1. The last major renovation was the closing of the four open corners of the stadium. The two corners on the north side were built in 2000; the corners on the south side were finalized in 2001. Along with creating more seats, the new corners had window blind-type constructions, which allowed air to flow through in order to let the grass breath. These frames can be closed during events, to protect spectators from weather conditions. The four corners were designed by Toon van Aken.
In March 2001, PSV faced 1. FC Kaiserslautern in an UEFA Cup fixture. During the match, fans were provoked by Kaiserslautern players, resulting in spectators attempting to break through a fence separating the stands and the field. After the gate was cracked, PSV coach Eric Gerets and several players had to personally stop the fans from entering the field. After this incident, problems with fan violence faded and in the summer of 2005, the PSV board decided to remove the tall fences around the pitch. They were replaced with 35 inches (90 cm) high railings keeping the spectators off the grass. Unauthorized persons who do invade the pitch will receive a €15,000 penalty and a ten-year ban from visiting the Philips Stadion. The 2006 UEFA Cup Final was held in the Philips Stadion; Sevilla defeated Middlesbrough 4–0. For the final, the stadium was temporarily named ‘PSV Stadion’, because UEFA did not allow the Philips name to be used.

Plans to further expand the ground to 45,000 seats have been examined, but turned down after the Netherlands lost the 2018 FIFA World Cup bid. In 2011, the ground under the stadium (and the training facilities) were sold for €48.4 million to the Eindhoven municipality in a leasehold estate construction. In recent years, the stadium has gone through several minor modernization programs: the fourth floor was renovated in 2008, LED-powered advertisement boarding was installed by Philips in 2009. In 2012, a modernization plan for the ground was presented. The plan included new entrances, sponsor lodges and parts of the stands. The second floor of the stadium was renovated in 2013. After PSV&#x27;s reserve team Jong PSV was admitted to the Eerste Divisie, they relocated their home matches to the Philips Stadion.

== Other uses ==
The Philips Stadion is incidentally used for music concerts. During these events, the stadium offers space for around 30,000 visitors. In 1992, a version of Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; was played at the stadium. Two years later, Eros Ramazzotti gave a concert at the Philips Stadion. In the aftermath, the grass suffered heavily after being trampled by concert goers. It prompted the PSV board&#x27;s reluctance to hold more events at the ground. It was not until 2006 that the stadium would host a concert: Dutch artist Guus Meeuwis played three concerts in front of a sold-out crowd. Since 2006, Meeuwis has played at the stadium every year. His shows were sometimes combined with live coverage of a Netherlands football team match in case of a planned fixture. In 2007, Dutch band BLØF also played at the ground.

== Transport ==

The stadium can be reached by a 10-minute walk from the Eindhoven main railway station, and a 15-minute walk from the Eindhoven Strijp-S railway station. Bus lines 401, 402 and 403 call at the &#x27;Philips-stadion&#x27; bus stop, just outside the stadium. Bus 401 is a service between the railway station and Eindhoven Airport, making the Philips Stadion directly connected with the airport. In the event of major football matches or other events, the stadium has its own railway platform, the Eindhoven Stadion railway station. The platform is only reachable through a pedestrian bridge that connects directly to the stadium. The station is mainly meant for travelling away fans: the bridge leads to the away-section in the stands. The station is only serviceable by trains travelling from the direction of the Eindhoven Strijp-S railway station to the Eindhoven railway station.

<text>The London XI was a football team that represented the city of London in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.

The competition began in 1955, and the first tournament took three years to complete. The entrants were the major football team of each city which held a Trade Fair. Like many cities taking part, London had several strong teams; however, rules stated that there could only be a single team from each city. Therefore, a representative team was created especially for the tournament, using the best players from the 11 Greater London-based Football League clubs. Membership of the team varied considerably between matches, and some 54 players took part in the team&#x27;s eight-match campaign.

The London XI, managed by Chelsea chairman Joe Mears, reached the final of the cup, after coming top of a group that included special XI teams from Basel and Frankfurt, and then beating Lausanne Sports. London lost 8–2 on aggregate over two legs to FC Barcelona.

The London XI only competed in the 1955–58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Thereafter, London was represented in the competition by individual clubs who qualified.

A unified London side competed in friendly matches even earlier: a &quot;London&quot; team represented the FA in the historic 1866 London v Sheffield match, there were several challenges against the Glasgow FA during the 1880s, and &quot;London&quot; lost 4-2 to Corinthians on 21 November 1903 in front of 1500, described as Corinthians &quot;had an easy task&quot; in a 1904 &quot;Times&quot; article. Two other matches have been referenced – an &quot;annual match&quot; versus Birmingham on 3 October 1910 and a match versus Paris on 18 December 1910.

<doc id="1286978" wikidata="Q753454" url="?curid=1286978" title="Rate of fire">
<text>Rate of fire is the frequency at which a specific weapon can fire or launch its projectiles. This can be influenced by several factors, including operator training level, mechanical limitations, ammunition availability, and weapon condition. In modern weaponry, it is usually measured in rounds per minute (RPM or round/min) or rounds per second (RPS or round/s).

There are three different measurements for the rate of fire: cyclic, sustained, and rapid. Cyclic is the maximum rate of fire given only mechanical function, not taking into account degradation of function due to heat, wear, or ammunition constraints. Sustained is the maximum efficient rate of fire given the time taken to load the weapon and keep it cool enough to operate. Finally, rapid is the maximum reasonable rate of fire in an emergency when the rate of fire need not be upheld for long periods.

==Overview==
For manually operated weapons such as bolt-action rifles or artillery pieces, the rate of fire is governed primarily by the training of the operator or crew, within some mechanical limitations. Rate of fire may also be affected by ergonomic factors. For rifles, ease-of-use features such as the design of the bolt or magazine release can affect the rate of fire.

For artillery pieces, a gun on a towed mount can usually achieve a higher rate of fire than the same weapon mounted within the cramped confines of a tank or self-propelled gun. This is because the crew operating in the open can move more freely and can stack ammunition where it is most convenient. Inside a vehicle, ammunition storage may not be optimized for fast handling due to other design constraints, and crew movement may be constricted. Artillery rates of fire were increased in the late 19th century by innovations including breech-loading and quick-firing guns.

For automatic weapons such as machine guns, the rate of fire is primarily a mechanical property. A high cyclic firing rate is advantageous for use against targets that are exposed to a machine gun for a limited time span, like aircraft or targets that minimize their exposure time by quickly moving from cover to cover. For targets that can be fired on by a machine gun for longer periods than just a few seconds the cyclic firing rate becomes less important.

For a third hybrid class of weapons, common in handguns and rifles, known as a semi-automatic firearm, the rate of fire is primarily governed by the ability of the operator to actively pull the trigger and, for aimed fire, the operator&#x27;s shot-to-shot recovery time. No other factors significantly contribute to the rate of fire. Generally, a semi-automatic firearm automatically chambers a round using blowback energy, but does not fire the new round until the trigger is released to a reset point and actively pulled again. A semi-automatic&#x27;s rate of fire is significantly different from and should not be confused with a full-automatic&#x27;s rate of fire. Many full-automatic small arms have a selective fire feature that &#x27;downgrades&#x27; them to semi-automatic mode by changing a switch.

Over time, weapons have attained higher rates of fire. A small infantry unit armed with modern rifles and machine guns can generate more firepower than much larger units equipped with older weapons. Over the 20th century, this increased firepower was due almost entirely to the higher rate of fire of modern weapons.

An example of increase in rate of fire is the Maxim machine gun that was developed in 1884 and used until World War I ended in 1918. Its performance was improved during that time mainly by advances in the field of cooling.

== Measurement ==
There are diverse measurements of rate of fire. The speed of the fire will vary depending on the type of automatic weapon.

=== Cyclic rate ===
This measures how quickly an automatic or semi-automatic firearm can fire a single cartridge. At the end of a cycle, the weapon should be ready to fire or begin firing another round. In an open bolt simple blowback weapon, this starts with pulling the trigger to release the bolt. The bolt pushes a cartridge into the barrel from a magazine and fires it. The energy propelling the bullet also pushes the bolt rearward against the recoil spring. After the bolt is stopped by either the spring or the rear of the receiver, it is pushed forward to either fire again or catch on the sear. Typical cyclic rates of fire are 600–1100 rpm for assault rifles, 400–1400 rpm for submachine guns and machine pistols, and 600–1,500 rpm for machine guns. M134 Miniguns mounted on attack helicopters and other combat vehicles can achieve rates of fire of over 100 rounds per second (6,000 rpm).

===Effective rate===
This is the duration of firing that a weapon could be expected to realistically withstand or output in a realistic environment. On paper, the M134 is capable of firing up to 6,000 rpm. Realistically, firing the weapon for a continuous sixty seconds would likely melt parts of the weapon. Sustained rate-of-fire depends on several factors, including reloading, aiming, barrel changes, cartridge fired, and user expertise. Knowing the effective rate of fire for a weapon can be useful for determining ammunition reserve and resupply requirements. Machine guns are typically fired in short bursts to preserve ammunition and barrel life, reserving long strings of fire for emergencies. Sustained rate-of-fire also applies to box magazine fed assault rifles and semi-automatic rifles, although these weapons rarely expend ammunition at the same rate as light machine guns.

===Sustained or rapid rate===
Rapid or sustained rate of fire may be considered a weapon&#x27;s absolute maximum firing rate. The term sustained refers to firing a fully-automatic weapon continuously, while rapid is limited to semi-automatic or manually operated firearms. Rapid and sustained fire are usually reserved for close-range defense against ambushes or human wave attacks. Such scenarios trade control, ammunition, and even aiming for sheer volume of fire. These fire rates push weapons and soldiers to their physical limits and cannot be sustained for long periods.

==Technical limitations==
The major limitation in higher rates of fire arises due to the problem of heat. Even a manually operated rifle generates heat as rounds are fired. A machine gun builds up heat so rapidly that steps must be taken to prevent overheating. Solutions include making barrels heavier so that they heat up more slowly, making barrels rapidly replaceable by the crews, or using water jackets around the barrel to cool the weapon. A modern machine gun team will carry at least one spare barrel for their weapon, which can be swapped out within a few seconds by a trained crew. Problems with overheating can range from ammunition firing unintentionally (cook-off), or, what is much worse in combat, failure to fire, or even explosion of the weapon.

Water-cooled weapons can achieve very high effective rates of fire (approaching their cyclic rate) but are very heavy and vulnerable to damage. A well-known example is the M1917 Browning machine gun, a heavy machine gun designed by John Browning and used by US forces during WWI. It became the basis of the much more common Browning M1919 machine gun, used by US forces throughout World War II, as well as the Browning M2 .50 caliber heavy machine gun, which is still in service, as well as many adaptions, such as the Japanese Ho-103 aircraft machine gun during World War II. Another legendarily reliable heavy machine gun is the British Vickers machine gun, based on the Maxim machine gun design, which saw service both on the air and ground during World War I and World War II. Due to their disadvantages, water-cooled weapons have gradually been replaced by much lighter air-cooled weapons. For weapons mounted on aircraft, no cooling device is necessary due to the outside air cooling the weapon as the aircraft is moving. Consequently, aircraft-mounted machine guns, autocannon or Gatling-type guns can sustain fire far longer than ground-based counterparts, firing close to their cyclic rate of fire. However, due to the weight of the ammunition, sustained fire is constrained by ammunition payload, as many aircraft cannons only carry enough ammunition for a few seconds&#x27; worth of firing; for example, the F-16 Falcon and its variants carry 511 rounds of 20mm ammunition, and the F-22 Raptor carries a similar amount at 480 rounds, which equates to roughly five seconds of firing at the M61 Vulcan&#x27;s 6000 rpm (100 rounds per second) cyclic rate. (Some aircraft, due to the purpose of the design, do carry more, such as the GAU-8 Avenger mounted on the A-10 Thunderbolt, which carries 1,150 rounds of ammunition sufficient for 17 seconds of firing).

Another factor influencing rate of fire is the supply of ammunition. At 50 rps (3,000 rpm), a five-second burst from an M134 Minigun would use approximately of 7.62 mm ammunition; this alone would make it an impractical weapon for infantry who have to carry a reasonable supply of ammunition with them. For this and other reasons, weapons with such high rates of fire are typically only found on vehicles or fixed emplacements.

<text>Original Sound is a Los Angeles, California-based record label. It was founded in the early 1950s by KPOP deejay Art Laboe. It began as a small label that specialized in compiling and re-releasing &quot;oldies&quot; R&amp;B and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs.

==History==
The label pioneered the concept of reissuing older pop and rock hits, and sold millions of records on his &quot;Oldies But Goodies&quot; compilation albums, several of which made the national &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. All 15 volumes of this series were later reissued on a best-selling CD series in the 1980s and 1990s, although track listings on each CD volume varied widely from the original LP issues with identical numbers, and some volumes contained none of the same songs as their original issues. Later on, the Double Shot Records catalog was purchased by Original Sound in ca. 1972.

The label&#x27;s biggest self-recorded hit as a single was &quot;Teen Beat&quot; by drummer Sandy Nelson, reaching number four on &quot;Billboard&quot; in 1959. Other successful Original Sound artists included:

* Preston Epps (&quot;Bongo Rock&quot; and &quot;Bongo, Bongo, Bongo&quot;)
* The Music Machine (&quot;Talk Talk&quot; and &quot;The People In Me&quot;) 
* Dyke &amp; the Blazers (&quot;Funky Broadway&quot;)
* Bobby Mac (&quot;Walkin&#x27; Together&quot; b/w &quot;Keep On&quot;, OS-68)

The first few &quot;Oldies But Goodies&quot; LPs were hugely successful (Volume 1 reached #12 on the Billboard Album charts and stayed on the chart for 183 weeks). Their success influenced other labels to put out compilations of their hits and near-hits, as well as helped validate the standing of songs like The Five Satins&#x27; &quot;In the Still of the Night&quot;, which only reached #24 on the pop charts in 1956.

<doc id="1286993" wikidata="Q658796" url="?curid=1286993" title="Taverham">
<text>Taverham is a large village and civil parish in Norfolk, in England. It is approximately 5 miles (8 km) north-west of Norwich. Taverham sits on the River Wensum. Taverham forms part the wider Norwich Built-up area.

In 2001, Taverham had a population of 10,233. It has seen recent population growth with the building of Thorpe Marriott, a new residential development that straddles the boundary with the neighbouring village of Drayton. The patron saint of Taverham is St Walstan who according to legend lived and worked in the village in the 11th century. By 2013, the area of Taverham had an approximate population of 14,121.

== Amenities ==
Taverham has two state run infant schools: Ghost Hill Infant and Nursery School, and Nightingale First School, and a public (privately owned) prep school: Taverham Hall School. Taverham Junior School (formerly St Edmund&#x27;s Middle School and Taverham Middle School) educates children between the ages of 7 and 11 years. Taverham High School, as well as serving Taverham, has a catchment area that includes the adjoining villages of Felthorpe and Ringland.

There are a variety of small shops in Taverham, and the Taverham Nursery Centre has a large selection of shops (such as craft, jewellery, paper, kitchenary, pine furniture etc.).

Taverham also has a village hall, library, recreational ground (park), church, scout and guide hut (which also serves as the home of the local day-care centre), several takeaway shops and two pubs: the &quot;Silver Fox&quot; and, in Thorpe Marriott, the &quot;Otter&quot;. Set in woodland on the Ringland Road, Taverham, is &quot;Roundwood&quot;, an indoor bowling centre with bar and function room.

Taverham Brass Band is based in the village, providing entertainment across Norfolk and beyond, and performing at the bi-annual &quot;Proms in the Park&quot; concert &quot;Exploding Brass!&quot; held at Taverham Hall. 2004 was the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary year, with the first of the October concerts (15 October 2004) falling exactly 30 years to the day from the inaugural committee meeting.

2015 saw the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Taverham Newsletter. The Newsletter which is run by volunteers is delivered free also by volunteers to all the homes and businesses in Taverham.

==Church of St. Edmund==

Parts of St Edmund&#x27;s Church are believed to be pre-Norman - part of the nave, and the slightly later base of the tower, also notable for its round body but octagonal top, where it had to be rebuilt. It is a Grade I listed building. A church was standing in Taverham in 1086 when it was listed in the Domesday survey.

== History ==
The villages name means &#x27;Red homestead/village&#x27;, perhaps referring to some decoration or a place where pigment was made. The exact location of the meeting-place of the Taverham hundred is unknown.

The first recorded mention of Taverham is thought to have been made in the time of Edward the Confessor. It also appears in the Domesday Book.

A school existed in Taverham very early on, from at least the 13th century.

In the 19th century Taverham was a major producer of paper. Some of the paper which was produced at Taverham Mill was used in producing &quot;The Times&quot;, Bank of England banknotes and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. It also served the University Press at Cambridge. In 1830 the paper mill, the property of the Ansted family and under the management of John Burgess, husband of Elizabeth Ansted, was attacked during the Swing Riots; a gardener, Robert West, was transported to Australia for his part in the riot. The mill closed in 1899.

On 5 October 1944, a V-2 rocket exploded in woods near Taverham.

== Local government representation ==
Taverham is part of Broadland District and is represented on Broadland District Council by four councillors covering two electoral wards. Taverham South Ward covers everything south of the Fakenham Road except Cypress Close and Highland Road. Taverham North Ward includes much of Thorpe Marriott, all of the parts of Taverham that are on the Fakenham Road and north of it, plus Highland Road and Cypress Close.

Taverham also has a county councillor representing the Taverham electoral division. This includes all of the Parish of Taverham.

== Notable residents ==
* As well as St. Walstan, the successful singer and songwriter Cathy Dennis, and the tennis player and BBC commentator Chris Bailey all lived in Taverham. Mel Clarke, paralympic archer hails from Taverham. She has won Silver and Bronze Paralympic medals and Bronze in world championships.

<text>The Battle of Batoche was the decisive battle of the North-West Rebellion, which pitted Canadian Militia units against a force of First Nations and Métis people. Fought from May 9 to 12, 1885, at the ad hoc Provisional Government of Saskatchewan capital of Batoche, the greater numbers and superior firepower of General Frederick Middleton&#x27;s force eventually overwhelmed the Métis fighters.

The defeat of the defenders of Batoche and its capture led to the surrender of Louis Riel on May 15 and the collapse of the Provisional Government.

Other groups were pursued and eventually gave up the struggle as well. Poundmaker surrendered on May 26 at Battleford after a long siege. Cree fighters and families under Big Bear held out the longest. They fought off Canadian troops pursuing them in the Battle of Frenchman&#x27;s Butte and Battle of Loon Lake. They gradually dwindled in number, disappearing into the bush along the way. Big Bear eventually turned himself in to the North-West Mounted Police at Fort Carlton in early July.

==Background==
Batoche was the capital of Louis Riel&#x27;s Provisional Government of Saskatchewan. Prior to the battle, trenches and concealed rifle pits had been dug around Batoche&#x27;s perimeter.

==Early advances and the crippling of the &quot;Northcote&quot;==
Conscious of the numerous reverses that had been suffered by government forces in previous clashes with the rebels (see the battles of Duck Lake, Fish Creek, and Cut Knife), Middleton approached Batoche with caution, reaching Gabriel&#x27;s Crossing on 7 May and advancing within eight miles (13 km) of the town the following day.
Middleton&#x27;s plan rested on an encirclement strategy: as his main contingent advanced and came in contact with Métis defensive lines, the steamboat &quot;Northcote,&quot; carrying some of Middleton&#x27;s troops, would steam past the distracted defenders and unload fifty troops at the rear of the town, effectively closing the pincer.

However, due to the difficulty of the terrain and Middleton&#x27;s penchant for prudence, his ground troops lagged behind schedule. When the &quot;Northcote&quot; appeared adjacent to the town on 9 May it was spotted by Métis rebels who had not yet come under fire from the advancing ground troops. The rebels&#x27; small arms fire did little damage because of the improvised armour that protected the large boat. They lowered Batoche&#x27;s ferry cable, and the &quot;Northcote&quot; steamed unsuspectingly into it, slicing off its masts and smokestacks. Crippled, the ship drifted harmlessly down the South Saskatchewan River and out of the battle.

==Battle==
===Mission Ridge (9 May)===
Ignorant of the &quot;Northcote&quot; fate, Middleton approached the church at Mission Ridge on the morning of 9 May in order to bring his plan into effect. Some Métis in two houses south of the church began firing at Boulton&#x27;s Scouts (irregular Canadian cavalry), but artillery was brought up to shell the houses, one of which caught fire. The Métis sharpshooters fled toward the settlement. The troops advanced toward the church. As they approached the church and nearby rectory, they saw some people near those buildings whom they took to be the enemy. Second Lieutenant Arthur L. Howard, a Gatling gun expert on leave from the Connecticut National Guard, fired his Gatling gun at the rectory. Then a white flag was unfurled, Howard&#x27;s firing stopped, and several priests, nuns, women and children came across the lines. Finding the mission occupied only by civilians, Middleton brought his artillery out onto the ridge and began shelling the town.

The soldiers began advancing past the church, and got about half a kilometre before they came under heavy fire from both sides of the trail. The militia immediately took cover. Their enemies, hidden in well-constructed rifle pits, were invisible. One trooper later wrote:
&quot;[The militia was] down some distance apart from each other, firing at nothing, making guess shots and hearing the rebel bullets zip all round you, and the everlasting clack as the bullets struck the trees.&quot;

The now-dismounted irregular militia cavalry, Boulton&#x27;s and French&#x27;s Scouts, were deployed on the right. The 10th Royal Grenadiers, militia infantry from Toronto, were in the centre, with the 90th Winnipeg Rifles militia, and Howard and his Gatling on the left, to protect the artillery. The infantry of the Midland Battalion, militia from eastern Ontario, were kept in reserve near the church, which was now being used as a Canadian field hospital. A very dangerous situation developed when a group of Métis rushed the artillery. Only Howard&#x27;s directing a heavy stream of Gatling fire at the attackers prevented a disaster. From these few minutes the frustrated soldiers got the only clear view of the Métis fighters that they were to have until the final moments of the battle, three days later.

After the attack was repulsed, the artillery was pulled back a couple of hundred meters, and the infantry and dismounted Scouts followed suit. The Métis then redeployed their men to try to outflank the militia, and heavy fighting ensued. After noon, the artillery was ordered forward again, and it began fruitlessly bombarding the invisible Métis rifle pits. The gunners were under heavy fire, in a very unsafe position. The Midlanders, who had been brought forward from the church, wanted to charge their unseen enemies, but were ordered not to by Middleton.

Throughout, the Gatling gun was used to good effect, providing covering fire for the withdrawal of cannon that had come under sniper fire, and dispersing another attempt by Gabriel Dumont to capture the guns.

Canadian advances saw less success but were carefully conducted, keeping casualties to a minimum. A Métis attempt to surround the Canadian lines failed when the brushfires meant to screen the sortie failed to spread. At the end of the day, both sides held their positions at Mission Ridge. But Middleton, shaken by the fierce resistance, ordered the Canadian soldiers to retire to a &quot;zareba&quot;, a hastily improvised fortification about a mile from the Métis entrenchments, where the troops retired to sleep behind their network of improvised barricades.

===Probing attacks (10 May to 11 May)===
On 10 May, Middleton established heavily-defended gunpits and conducted a devastating, day-long shelling of the town. Attempted advances, however, were turned back by Métis fire, and no ground was gained. The next day, Middleton gauged the strength of the defenders by dispatching a contingent of men north along the enemy&#x27;s flank while simultaneously conducting a general advance along the front. Having redirected a portion of their strength to hold the northward flank, the Métis lacked the manpower to oppose the Canadian thrust, ceding ground with little resistance. Canadian soldiers ventured as far as the Batoche cemetery before turning back. Satisfied with his enemies&#x27; weakness, Middleton retired to sleep and contended to take the town in the morning.

===Storming of Batoche (12 May)===

By 12 May, Métis defences were in poor shape. Of the original defenders, three-quarters had either been wounded by artillery fire or were scattered and divided in the many clashes with the Canadians on the outskirts of the town. Those that still held their positions were fatigued and desperately short of ammunition. They resorted to hunting in the underbrush for bullets fired by government troops and firing them back and some fired nails and rocks, forks and knives, instead of bullets, out of their rifles.

Middleton&#x27;s attack plan on this day was designed to mirror the success of the previous day&#x27;s flanking feint, with one column drawing defenders away to the north and a second, under Colonel Bowen van Straubenzee, assaulting the town directly. At first, on the morning of 12 May, Middleton&#x27;s plan went awry. Van Straubenzee and his men did not attack, because the wind was blowing away from them and they did not hear the sound of the north column&#x27;s gunfire. Middleton, who had been with the north column, returned to the camp in a rage because van Straubenzee had not attacked. He shouted abuse at van Straubenzee and the Canadian colonels, and stalked off to lunch.

The previous night, some of the senior Canadian officers, exasperated by Middleton&#x27;s caution, had discussed undertaking a charge. Now van Straubenzee was more amenable to this, as well. After noon, the Midlanders and Royal Grenadiers moved forward again, to a point near the Batoche Cemetery. No one knows precisely who ordered the wild mass Canadian charge which now ensued. Firing at will, and cheering, the Midlanders and Grenadiers, aided by the Winnipeg 90th Rifles, rushed at the Métis rifle pits. Many of the Métis fighters were still out of position, having been drawn away from the cemetery and church to the north-east by Middleton&#x27;s feint that morning. Ammunition on the Métis side was very low. Nevertheless, they resisted bravely, aided by sharpshooters firing from across the Saskatchewan River at the charging militiamen.

However, the charge was irresistible. Middleton ordered the rest of the troops to assist by covering the flank of the charging men. Howard and his Gatling were moved up. The charging militia stormed into the village of Batoche. Then their enemies rallied. Métis and First Nations who had been drawn away to the east by Middleton&#x27;s feint in the morning now appeared, and commenced a heavy fire from rifle pits in brush near the village. A senior Canadian officer, Captain French, was killed as he fired from a second story window. But the artillery and the Gatling were brought up to break this new resistance. The last defenders of Batoche surrendered.

Straubenzee&#x27;s soldiers charged into Batoche, driving the remaining Métis clear of the town.

Middleton&#x27;s plan, plus an impetuous charge by Canadian militia had seen the last defenders overrun, and resistance at Batoche ended.

==Aftermath==

The Métis defeat at Batoche virtually ended the North-West Rebellion.

Louis Riel was captured and was hanged for treason in Regina on 16 November.

Gabriel Dumont fled to the United States, returning to Batoche in 1893. When he died, his body was buried there.

Poundmaker and Big Bear both were sentenced to prison terms.

Amnesty was granted for rank-and-file fighters. However several murders that had taken place outside the fighting were punished. The largest mass hanging in Canadian history took the lives of eight men in November 1885.

Middleton&#x27;s forces proceeded north to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan and some portions were disbanded without delay and sent home in Eastern Canada.

===Casualties===
Middleton reported 8 deaths and 46 wounded on the Canadian side and 51 deaths and 173 wounded on the Métis side. Later, Father Vegreville&#x27;s report claimed that the Métis loss was not as high as the Mission first reported to Middleton. Vegreville&#x27;s report claimed that there were 16 Métis killed and between 20 and 30 wounded during the battle. Nine of the Métis killed in the battle were buried in the cemetery of Batoche. Eight were in a common grave.

===Bell of Batoche===

Following the battle, it is claimed that several Canadian soldiers from Millbrook, Ontario, seized the bell from the Batoche church and took it back to Ontario as a prize. The fate of the bell became an issue of longstanding controversy, involving several Métis organizations and the provincial governments of Ontario, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. The Millbrook bell is now identified as the identical Bell of Frog Lake.

==Legacy==

In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck lake, that &quot;the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie Métis and First Nations peoples&#x27; struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.&quot;

Batoche, where the Métis Provisional Government had been formed, has been declared a national historic site. Batoche marks the site of Gabriel Dumont&#x27;s grave site, Albert Caron&#x27;s House, Batoche school, Batoche cemetery, Letendre store, Gabriel&#x27;s river crossing, Gardepy&#x27;s crossing, Batoche crossing, St. Antoine de Padoue Church, Métis rifle pits, and Canadian militia&#x27;s battle camp.

<doc id="1287008" wikidata="Q273588" url="?curid=1287008" title="Andrea Thompson">
<text>Rebecca Andrea Thompson (born January 6, 1960) is an American actress, known for her roles on the television series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, &quot;JAG&quot;, &quot;24&quot;, and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;.

==Early life==
Andrea Thompson was born January 6, 1960, in Dayton, Ohio. When she was six, her family moved to Australia. She left high school at 16, and after an extended period of travel, she moved to New York City. She began modeling and studied acting at the Strasberg Studio and the Herbert Berghof Studio under Uta Hagen.

==Career==
===Acting career===
Thompson began her career as a voiceover artist, which continues today. Her first significant film role was in the 1987 film &quot;Wall Street&quot;. In 1989, she was cast on the soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; as the scheming Genele Ericson during the show&#x27;s final season, and played photojournalist Maggie Dawson in the Season 3, Episode 2 of the series &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. In 1991, she played Nurse Helen Caldwell in the comedy film &quot;Delirious&quot;. In 1993 she was cast on the science fiction television series &quot;Babylon 5&quot; as telepath Talia Winters. Thompson left the series in the middle of its second season.

Thompson moved on to join the cast of &quot;JAG&quot; midseason as Commander Alison Krennick, an aide to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy and direct supervisor of Harmon Rabb. She was among several actors who left the show when it was canceled by NBC after one season before CBS picked it up. She then went on to play Detective Jill Kirkendall on four seasons of crime drama &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, leaving in April 2000 to pursue a career in journalism.

===Journalism career===
Thompson started to prepare for her journalism career in 1999, by earning her GED and working for one year with Jack Hubbard, associate director of Stanford University&#x27;s News Service and a veteran journalist of CBS News. During this time, she also took a writing seminar with KGO-TV&#x27;s feature reporter Wayne Freedman. 
She began her work with CBS affiliate KRQE in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as a general assignment reporter for $26,000 per year.

Thompson joined &quot;CNN Headline News&quot; as an evening anchor in June 2001. CNN had laid off 400 of 4,000 employees in January, and was refocusing on personalities to draw in younger viewers. Her first words on-screen as reporter were &quot;Hi, I&#x27;m Andrea Thompson, and unless you&#x27;ve been living in a cave, you probably already know that.&quot; Her hiring generated controversy in journalism circles, mostly because Thompson had just one year of journalism experience. Nude pictures and videoclips of Thompson taken from her 1980s-era movies also began circulating on the Internet, causing some embarrassment for CNN. Thompson left the network in March 2002. During an appearance in January 2003, she made a statement indicating she left CNN because she disagreed with the way the news was handled, &quot;Basically... you just give the viewers enough to scare the hell out of them, and not any real valuable information. And we saw so much of that after Sept. 11 that I thought was, frankly, irresponsible.&quot;

After leaving CNN, she went to work for Court TV, introducing episodes of&quot; NYPD Blue&quot; and &quot;Forensic Files&quot;, as well as narrating the documentary series &quot;The System&quot;. She began hosting &quot;Psychic Detectives&quot; in 2003.

===Return to acting===
Thompson had a recurring guest role as Doctor Nicole Duncan on the third season of the television series &quot;24&quot;, first appearing on that show in November 2003.

In 2007, she appeared in season two of &quot;Bones&quot; in the episode &quot;Spaceman in a Crater&quot;.

In 2009, she played Field Agent Anne Hudson in &quot;Outfoxed&quot;, a season five episode of the series &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;.

==Personal life==
Thompson was married to David Guc from 1987 to 1990, and to &quot;Babylon 5&quot; costar Jerry Doyle from 1995 to 1997. In 1992 she gave birth to a son.

<text>Arbën Xhaferi (; 24 January 1948 – 15 August 2012) was a Macedonian politician of Albanian origin. Xhaferi was president of the Democratic Party of Albanians, an ethnic Albanian political party, and was an advocate of rights for ethnic Albanians in the country. He is best known for calling for a change in the Preamble of the Constitution. 

==Life==
Arbën Xhaferi was born in Tetovo, FPR Yugoslavia (now North Macedonia), on 24 January 1948 to a Kosovar family with Turkish connections, where he attended primary and secondary school. In 1968, he participated in student protests in the city after his uncle, a tailor, attempted to practice his right to fly an Albanian flag but an ethnic Macedonian forcibly removed it. He studied in Belgrade University&#x27;s Faculty of Philosophy. Xhaferi spent most of his life in Pristina. He built a reputation as an art critic there and became a senior editor in Pristina television. Xhaferi was dismissed from the job when ethnic Albanians were sacked from the station by Slobodan Milošević&#x27;s Serbian administration. He returned to Macedonia in the early 1990s. After a multi-party system was introduced in Macedonia, he became a member of the Party for Democratic Prosperity (PDP). Xhaferi focused on higher education and worked with Fadil Sulejmani to re-establish opportunities for Albanians. He sided with radical members of PDP to urge the party to take a more confrontational approach with the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia. PDP expelled him, along with Menduh Thaçi, in February 1994. He was elected to the Macedonian parliament in the elections in October 1994. From PDP came the Democratic Party of Albanians, led by him since its formation in 1997 until 2007, when he was replaced by Thaçi and became an honorary leader. Parkinson&#x27;s disease prompted him to step down. He died on 15 August 2012, aged 64, at the Skopje Hospital, Macedonia, after being hospitalized due to a stroke. The R 6 Motorway in Kosovo is named after him.

==Personal life and views==
Xhaferi&#x27;s father was a tailor and he reportedly served jail time in the 1950s for protesting the expulsion of ethnic Turks. His best-known writings are &quot;Challenges to Democracy in Multi-Ethnic States&quot; (October 1998) and &quot;The DPA Non-Paper&quot; (April 2001), which are available on the Internet in English. In Xhaferi&#x27;s view, the ethnic Albanians of Macedonia were relegated to a &quot;second-class&quot; status. He had also consistently demanded that Albanians be recognized as a constituent people in Macedonia, based on their numerical presence, which he estimated as well above the official figures from the 1991 census (boycotted by ethnic Albanians), 1994 census (conducted under international supervision) and the 2002 census. Xhaferi also wanted the rehabilitation of political prisoners from the Yugoslav period, which he estimated at over 50,000. He told international journalists that his parents were harassed by the Yugoslav police. For him, the Republic of Macedonia had failed to break with the Yugoslav state tradition of anti-Albanian bias.

Xhaferi supported Ljubčo Georgievski&#x27;s proposal for the ethnic partition of Macedonia, which faced huge disapproval there. In 1998, he said: &quot;The presumption that Albanians are a “minority” in the Balkans flies in the face of historical fact: Albanians are the third largest ethnic group in the region ... They are a majority that was divided by force.&quot; Xhaferi proposed that Kosovo should be renamed to Dardania and unite with Albania.

<text>Afon Rheidol (; also known as the River Rheidol) is a river in Ceredigion, Wales, in length. The source is Plynlimon. Receiving an average annual rainfall of , Plynlimon is also the source of both the Wye and the Severn.

==Geography and geology==

Originally formed at the confluence of the Afon Hengwm and Afon Llechwedd-mawr, the Rheidol now emerges as the outflow of Nant-y-moch Reservoir on the western flanks of Plynlimon, near the sources of the Wye and Severn. After flowing south to Ponterwyd in the increasingly deep valley, then southwest through Welsh Oak ancient woodland, it veers westwards to its confluence with the Afon Mynach, at Devil&#x27;s Bridge, Ceredigion (, lit. &quot;bridge on the Mynach&quot;), and a spectacular waterfall. The river continues, passing the abandoned workings of the Cwm Rheidol lead mine; one of many other metal mines in the valleya source of extracted metal pollution of the river and flows westwards before reaching its confluence with the Afon Ystwyth and the estuary at Aberystwyth to drain into Cardigan Bay. 

In the late 1960s, when the mine was closed, a major blowout of water contained in an adit coloured the whole river an ochre orange colour and greatly added to the concentrations of lead and zinc in the river. Today, management of water still draining from the mine is by the use of constructed wetlands. Previous management had included a limestone filter bed installed in the 1960s and now redundant. The filter bed is still in place and can be seen from the road.

The reservoir is close to the site of the Battle of Mynydd Hyddgen (1401). The true geographical source of the river is difficult to determine. The traditional source is Llyn Llygad Rheidol, a lake in a high valley near the summit of Pen Pumlumon Fawr, as its name suggests (&quot;Rheidol&#x27;s Eye Lake&quot;); the stream Nant y Llyn descends from it into the Afon Hengwm, but is not a substantial stream. There are several other, larger streams, such as the Afon Hengwm, which rises to the south of Llyn Bugeilyn, just across the boundary in Powys. The Afon Llechwedd-mawr rises near Llyn Penrhaeadr and marks the boundary between Ceredigion and Powys along most of its course. There are some other lesser streams, including Nant y Moch, after which the reservoir is named.

==Economy==

For many centuries the economy of the Rheidol valley had been based on metal mining. This has now been replaced by forestry, tourism and the farming of beef, dairy cattle and sheep.

There are a number of tourist attractions in the Rheidol valley. These include the village of Devil&#x27;s Bridge and the Mynach Falls, where three bridges, each built over the previous, span the top of a spectacular gorge.

Between Devil&#x27;s Bridge and Aberystwyth runs a narrow-gauge steam railway, the Vale of Rheidol Railway. This was originally built to ship metal ore from the mines, but now provides a very popular tourist route to the top end of the Rheidol valley.
A large stag-like shape on the northern valley wall, above the Cwm Rheidol reservoir, known as the &quot;White Stag&quot;, is traditionally said to be a hill figure but it is in fact an industrial feature, formed by the waste from lead mining at Gellireirin. The landmark has been visible for more than 100 years.

==Environment==
The catchment of the Rheidol is dominated by the western maritime exposure of this part of Wales. Rainfall levels are high and ecosystems reflect both high rainfall and the acidic nature of the underlying rocks. Combined with the acid mine drainage from abandoned silver and lead mines that sit within the catchment (the area around Aberystwyth contains 38 of the 50 worst polluting metal mines in Wales), by 1991 the river had regularly broken EEC pollution limits for heavy metal contamination such as zinc.

Upland &quot;Molinia&quot; spp. grassland is common growing on deep deposits of peat. Within the valleys, dense and ancient oak forests with rich understoreys of ferns, mosses and lichens are common. In the valley bottom, glacial and alluvial deposits have been worked by man into low intensive agriculture.

<text>The Ranworth Antiphoner is a 15th-century illuminated antiphoner of the Sarum Rite. It was commissioned for the Church of St Helen in Ranworth in Norfolk, where it is on permanent display. The volume comprises 285 vellum pages of writing and illustrations, with daily services in medieval Latin and 19 miniatures.

The manuscript was probably the Antiphoner bequeathed to the church in 1478 by William Cobbe. Previously thought to have been produced by the monks of Langley Abbey, examinations of the illuminations suggest that the Antiphoner was manufactured by a Norwich workshop – a basic antiphoner could be produced on spec, and personalised to order. Two things may back this up: 1) the insertion at the end, out of order, of the office of St Helen; 2) Revd. Enraght&#x27;s suggestion of a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; of 1443, owing to the lack of a feast of St Raphael, which was instituted in that year. Recent research has shown that it was not uncommon for churches to invest in liturgical music books by the later fifteenth century.

The Antiphoner miraculously survived the Reformation, probably thanks to the local Holdych family. It fell into private hands, including, in the 1850s, those of Henry Huth, and eventually re-surfaced at auction in 1912, where it was bought and returned to St Helen&#x27;s Church.

<text>Schuyler Lake is the name of a small hamlet (and census-designated place) in the town of Exeter in Otsego County, New York, United States. It lies at the south end of Canadarago Lake and south of Richfield Springs. It is also known as Kaniatarake, which is a Mohawk name that translates to &quot;on the lake&quot;.

New York State Route 28 and Otsego County Route 22 intersect in the center of the hamlet. Schuyler Lake is the location of the infamous Battle of the Four Corners, so named because of the hamlet&#x27;s geographical location at the crossroads of State Highway 28 and County Highway 22.

==History==
The hamlet was once served by the Southern New York Railroad, an electric trolley line that ran from Oneonta to Mohawk.

<text>The Big Golden Guitar is one of the many &quot;big&quot; attractions that can be found around Australia. Located in Tamworth, New South Wales, the monument is one of the best-known points of interest in New England. 

It is also a major attraction during the Tamworth Country Music Festival.

==History==
The Golden Guitar was erected in front of the Longyard Hotel on Sydney Road in 1988. It was unveiled by the country music artist, Slim Dusty. Its location in Tamworth is symbolic of the city&#x27;s recognition and celebration of Australian country music, and its artists.

An annual award ceremony takes place where miniature Golden Guitars are given as awards to artists and musicians in recognition of their achievements and contributions in the genre of country music. An estimated 3.6 million photographs have been taken of the site since its opening.

In 2018, the Tamworth Visitor Information Centre at the Big Golden Guitar Tourist Centre had 117,000 visitors, and the Council intends to increase visitor numbers. Long-term planning of the site will eventually see a National Guitar Museum established at the site along with a cafe for the tourists.

==Design==
The Golden Guitar stand approximately 12 metres high and weighs over 500 kilograms. It is constructed out of fibreglass and wood, with steel reinforcements. The Golden Guitar has no strings because it was modeled directly on the Golden Guitar trophies given to winners at the Country Music Awards of Australia ceremony night during the Tamworth Country Music Festival.

<text>Sir Frederick Dobson Middleton (4 November 1825 – 25 January 1898) was a British general noted for his service throughout the Empire and particularly in the North-West Rebellion in Canada.

== Imperial military career ==
Middleton was born in London, the third son of Major General Charles Middleton and Fanny Wheatley. Educated at Maidstone Grammar School and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Middleton was commissioned into the 58th Regiment of Foot in 1842.

He served in the New Zealand Wars, and in 1845 he was mentioned in dispatches for his part in the capture of the stronghold of Māori chief Te Ruki Kawiti.

In 1848 he transferred to the 96th Regiment of Foot in India and took part in the suppression of the Indian Mutiny in which campaign he was recommended for, but not awarded, the Victoria Cross. He went on to be Commandant of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1879.

== Canadian military career ==
He was appointed General Officer Commanding the Militia of Canada in 1884. He commanded the main counter-insurgency force when in 1885 a group of Métis launched the North-West Rebellion. His force was victorious in the Battle of Batoche, which ended the rebellion.

Middleton happened to be on the Prairies when the rebellion broke out. He had travelled from Ottawa to Winnipeg to evaluate Military District 10, which covered the Prairies, as the officer in charge of District 10 had just been dismissed on the account of his alcoholism. This was the same day as the Battle of Duck Lake, the first fighting in the Rebellion. Métis fighters defeated a force of the North-West Mounted Police there.

Though Middleton was elderly and generally cautious, his response to the news of Duck Lake was swift. That same day, he departed Winnipeg on a train bound for Qu&#x27;Appelle with a company of Manitoba militia.

The major difficulty for Middleton was mobilizing the militia forces of Ontario and Quebec. They had to travel on the only-partially-completed Canadian Pacific Railway. This required the men to march through snow and the rocks of northern Ontario to reach Winnipeg, the headquarters of the government forces.

Canadian historian Desmond Morton described Middleton as an experienced soldier who &quot;mixed common sense and pomposity in equal measure&quot;. His plan was to take Batoche, the capital of the Métis &quot;exovedate&quot; (council) and thus end the rebellion. As the rebellion had shaken international confidence in the credit-worthiness of Canada, Middleton was under pressure from Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald, to end the rebellion as soon as possible.

The militiamen arriving in Winnipeg were mostly untrained, and Middleton worked to train them as they marched toward Batoche.

On 6 April 1885, Middleton and his troops set off from Qu&#x27;Appelle to march to Batoche. On 23 April, Métis and Cree fighters under Gabriel Dumont ambushed the troops at Fish Creek, temporarily stopping the advance.

Despite Middeton&#x27;s orders, Colonel William Dillon Otter after reaching Battleford set out to do battle with the Cree, and was defeated by Chief Poundmaker at the Battle of Cut Knife Hill; only the latter&#x27;s unwillingness to have his warriors take advantage of the rout saved the troops from being annihilated. Middleton planned to advance on Batoche with river steamers owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company bringing up supplies along Swift Current Creek, Red Deer River and South Saskatchewan River, As steamers were not available at first, Middleton chose to wait. Despite their own panic at Fish Creek, many of the militiamen came to curse &quot;Old Fred&quot; as too timid, but Middleton had sound reasons for not wishing to advance without a means of resupply. Middleton knew that the Métis and the Cree were expert horsemen and believed they would ambush any supply wagons, which is why he preferred to bring up supplies and reinforcements via the river.

On 23 April, the steamer &quot;Northcote&quot; left from Swift Current, arriving at Fish Creek on 5 May, after the battle. With his resupply in place, on 5 May Middleton set off for Batoche., with the steamboat following on the river. On 9 May, the &quot;Northcote&quot; was stopped by a cable that Dumont had laid across the river outside of Batoche, and its U.S. captain turned back when the boat came under fire. The &quot;Northcote&quot; acted as a diversion to draw out the Métis, and at the same time, the Middleton&#x27;s column arrived at Batoche. Seeing his troops beginning to panic again, Middleton ordered his wagons to be drawn into a circle to form a strong defensive position. On 11 May, Middleton observed that the outnumbered Métis and Cree had to rush from position to position in defence of Batoche, and on the morning of 12 May, Middleton ordered his artillery to open fire on his opponents to pin them down while his infantry advanced. Nothing had happened as infantry claimed not to hear the fire of the artillery; after accusing his men of cowardice, Middleton attacked again in the afternoon and with a battalion, commanded by Conservative MP Colonel Arthur Williams, leading the attack. Inspired by the example of Williams&#x27;s battalion, other battalions charged forward. Shouting enthusiastically, the troops raced down from the hill, and the disheartened Métis and Cree fighters were either killed or fleeing.

Morton described Middleton as cautious, but a highly professional officer who was a better tactician than Dumont. He had brought the war to a swift conclusion in a manner that was much less bloodier than it could have been. For his service in the war, Middleton was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1885. He also received the thanks of the Parliament of Canada and the sum of $20,000.

He resigned as head of the militia in 1890 when a select committee report of the House of Commons criticized him for the misappropriation of furs from a Scotch-Indian Charles Bremner and his Cree wife Emily Bremner, during the rebellion.
There were also other criticisms of Middleton&#x27;s command during the rebellion, such as his hesitancy to unleash the Canadian Militia troops to assault the Métis positions at Batoche, and unfair treatment and poor maintenance accorded the troops under his command. Returning to England, he was made Master of the Jewel Office.

== Family ==

Frederick Dobson Middleton married, as his first wife, Mary Emily Hassall.

He married in February 1870 as his second wife, Marie Cecile Eugénie Doucet, daughter of Theodore Doucet, N.P., of Montreal. She was born in Montreal in 1846, and was educated at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, Sault-au-Récollet. The couple had two sons and a daughter. She died at Yateley, Hampshire, England, 1 November 1899.

<doc id="1287065" wikidata="Q5123247" url="?curid=1287065" title="City Island (Pennsylvania)">
<text>City Island is a mile-long island in the Susquehanna River between Harrisburg and Wormleysburg, Pennsylvania in the United States. It is used mainly for leisure and sports activities. Its previous names have included Turkey Island, Maclay&#x27;s Island, Forster&#x27;s Island and Hargast Island. The island can be reached from either side of the Susquehanna River by Market Street Bridge or, from the Harrisburg side and by pedestrians and cyclists only, by Walnut Street Bridge.

==History==
The island contains archaeological remains of the Susquehannocks and the Iroquois tribes, who at one time established seasonal settlements here. During the initial development of Harrisburg, the island was only able to be reached by boat or fording in low waters, until 1817 when the Camelback Bridge, site of the present-day Market Street Bridge, was completed.

During the American Civil War, Camp Necessity was formed on City Island in 1863 for Union troops to stage additional defense as Confederate troops threatened invasion of the area during the Gettysburg Campaign. Then in 1865, Camp Keystone was formed on the island, as Camp Curtin was overflowing with returning troops.

Though originally used for truck farming, amateur games of baseball were played here as early as the 1880s. In 1903, the Harrisburg Athletics professional baseball team and Harrisburg Giants Negro league arrived at Island Park on City Island. Satchel Paige played games at Island Park through the Negro leagues, which were held on the island through 1957. The original Harrisburg Senators played in the Eastern League starting in 1924. Playing its home games at Island Field, the team won the league championship in the 1927, 1928, and 1931 seasons. Babe Ruth famously played a game at Island Park in 1928 when the New York Yankees came to Harrisburg to scrimmage against the original Senators. The Senators played a few more seasons before flood waters destroyed Island Field in 1936, effectively ending Eastern League participation for fifty-one years. In 1940, Harrisburg gained an Interstate League team affiliation with the Pittsburgh Pirates. However, the team remained in the city only until 1943, when it moved to nearby York and renamed the York Pirates.

With the onset of the City Beautiful Movement in the 1900s, the City Island Filtration Plant was constructed. The plant drew water from the river, filtered it into concrete reservoirs (which now define the edge of the Skyline Sports Complex), and pumped it by tunnel laid under the river to the Old Waterworks at Front and North Streets, which then pumped the water to the reservoirs up in Reservoir Park. The Flood of 1972 resulting from Hurricane Agnes destroyed the Filtration Plant, leaving the DeHart Dam to supply water to the city.

By the 1980s, concerts were held in the old field leftover from athletic events, such as Metallica (July 12, 1989) and Grateful Dead (June 22, 1983 and June 23, 1984). However, part of the field which was used for concerts would become the new Riverside Stadium (now FNB Field) in 1987.

==Layout and attractions==
The Market Street Bridge spans across the southern area of the island, under which are the parking areas. Most of the attractions are on the northern area of the island, where roads wind around the island.

The island is the site of FNB Field, the home of the Harrisburg Senators minor baseball team, and the former home of Penn FC, a professional soccer team. It also features the Skyline Sports Complex, which is the home of the Central Penn Piranha, a semi-professional football team which belongs to the North American Football League. The complex is open year-round to the public, and provides a multi-purpose sports field, sand volleyball courts, and a fitness center.

The island also provides family-based amusements such as the narrow gauge City Island Railroad (complete with a Crown Metal Products steam locomotive), carousel, &quot;Pride of the Susquehanna&quot; paddle-wheel riverboat, horse-drawn carriage rides, miniature golf, a replica of John Harris Sr.&#x27;s fur-trading post, a riverside village-style playground, three boat marinas, and a concrete beach.

==Events==
The island is home to many events, including Harrisburg&#x27;s Independence Day Celebration, Kipona Festival, Cultural Fest, Harrisburg Marathon, Armed Forces Day, Penguin Plunge and others.

==Canceled projects==
City Island was the proposed location of:

* A CorridorOne regional rail station (removed from the project in 2006).
* The National Sports Hall of Fame (canceled in 2009).

<text>Margaret Visser (born May 11, 1940) is a Canadian writer and broadcaster who lives in Toronto, Paris, and South West France. Her subject matter is the history, anthropology, and mythology of everyday life.

==Biography==
Born in South Africa, she attended school in Zambia, Zimbabwe, France (the Sorbonne) and the University of Toronto where she earned a PhD in Classics.

Visser taught Greek and Latin at York University in North York, Toronto for 18 years. For several years Visser regularly appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s popular radio program &quot;Morningside&quot; in conversations with Peter Gzowski. Her writing has won many awards, including the Glenfiddich Award for Food Book of the Year in Britain in 1989, the International Association of Culinary Professionals&#x27; Literary Food Writing Award, and the Jane Grigson Award. Visser delivered the 2002 CBC Massey Lectures. Her topic was &quot;Beyond Fate.&quot;

Visser is married to Colin Visser, professor emeritus of the English Department of the University of Toronto.

In 2017, Visser&#x27;s 1992 book, &quot;The Rituals of Dinner&quot; was re-issued, on her birthday, and &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s review of it noted her wry humour. The review noted &quot;Twenty-five years after its first publication, Visser’s book remains a delightful guide to how we eat, and why it matters.&quot;

In 2018, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; cited Visser, on the etiquette of cannibalism, from her 1992 book on dining manners, &quot;The Rituals of Dinner&quot;, when reporting on the bizarre case of a California high school girl who claimed she served her classmates cookies that contained her grandfather&#x27;s ashes.

In September, 2019, Visser was one of the experts interviewed for a documentary on what recent archeological discoveries say about Mayan dining habits.

<text> (, ) was an office and paramilitary rank in the (SA), the paramilitary stormtroopers associated with the Nazi Party. It was a rank and position held by the operating chief of the SA. The rank was equivalent to the rank of in the German Army and to General in the U.S. Army.

==Definition==
The position of , not yet a rank, was established in 1929 to assist the (Supreme SA Leader) with the administration of the fast-growing organisation. Otto Wagener held the office under Franz Pfeffer von Salomon from 1928 to 1930, and effectively headed the SA from Hitler&#x27;s assumption of the title in August until Ernst Röhm replaced him in January 1931.

The actual SA rank of was created by Röhm for himself in 1933 after Hitler became chancellor. Although Hitler became the supreme commander of the SA in 1930, the day-to-day running of the organisation was left to the chief of staff. Thus, the men who held the rank of after 1930 were the actual leaders of the SA.

==Office holders==
The office of was held by four different people between 1929 and 1945 and was, in all but the first case of succession, inherited due to the death of a predecessor. The following SA officers held the office of :



===Timeline===
==Insignia==
Early insignia for consisted of an oak leaf patch worn on the collar of the stormtrooper uniform. Photographic evidence shows Ernst Röhm wearing such an insignia in his early days as the SA Chief of Staff. As Röhm&#x27;s authority increased, so did his insignia and by mid 1931 photographic evidence shows him wearing wreathed star that was designed after that of a Bolivian general&#x27;s collar, due to Röhm&#x27;s previous military experience as a military adviser in Bolivia.

After 1933, the insignia for consisted of a &quot;crossed lances&quot; pattern, wreathed by a half oak leaf circle. After 1934, the insignia was changed to a wreathed tri-foil oak leaf pattern similar to the SS rank insignia of . With the fall of Nazi Germany, the ceased to exist and with it the .

<doc id="1287073" wikidata="Q1758126" url="?curid=1287073" title="Musculocutaneous nerve">
<text>The musculocutaneous nerve is a mixed branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus derived from cervical spinal nerves C5-C7. It arises opposite the lower border of the pectoralis minor. It provides motor innervation to the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm: the coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, and brachialis. It provides sensory innervation to the lateral forearm (via its terminal branch). It courses through the anterior part of the arm, terminating 2 cm above elbow; after passing the lateral edge of the tendon of biceps brachii it is becomes known as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.

==Structure==

=== Course ===

Musculocutaneous nerve arises from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus with root value of C5 to C7 of the spinal cord. It follows the course of the third part of the axillary artery (part of the axillary artery distal to the pectoralis minor) laterally and enters the frontal aspect of the arm where it penetrates the coracobrachialis muscle. It then passes downwards and laterally between the biceps brachii (above) and the brachialis muscles (below), to the lateral side of the arm; at 2 cm above the elbow it pierces the deep fascia lateral to the tendon of the biceps brachii and is continued into the forearm as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.

=== Distribution ===

==== Motor innervation ====
In its course through the arm it innervates the coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, and the greater part of the brachialis.

==== Sensory innervation ====
Its terminal branch, the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm, supplies the sensation of the lateral side of the forearm from the elbow to the wrist.

The musculocutaneous nerve also gives articular branches to the elbow joint and to the humerus.

===Variation===
The musculocutaneous nerve presents frequent variations and communications with the median nerve. 
#It may adhere for some distance to the median and then pass outward, beneath the biceps brachii, instead of through the coracobrachialis. 
#Some of the fibers of the median may run for some distance in the musculocutaneous and then leave it to join their proper trunk; less frequently the reverse is the case, and the median sends a branch to join the musculocutaneous. 
#The nerve may pass under the coracobrachialis or through the biceps brachii.
#Occasionally it gives a filament to the pronator teres, and it supplies the dorsal surface of the thumb when the superficial branch of the radial nerve is absent.

== Nerve injuries ==
Injury to the musculocutaneous nerve can be caused by three mechanisms: repeated microtrauma, indirect trauma or direct trauma on the nerve. Overuse of coracobrachialis, biceps, and brachialis muscles can cause the stretching or compression of musculocutaneous nerve. Those who have it, can complain of pain, tingling or reduced sensation over the lateral side of the forearm. This symptom can be reproduced by pressing over the region below the coracoid process (positive Tinel&#x27;s sign). Pain can also be reproduced by flexing the arm against resistance. Other differential diagnoses that can mimick the symptoms of musculocutaneous palsy are: C6 radiculopathy (pain can be produced by movement of the neck), long head of biceps tendinopathy (no motor or sensory deficits), pain of the bicipital groove (relieved by shoulder joint injection). Electromyography test shows slight neural damage at the biceps and the brachialis muscles with slower motor and sensory conduction over the Erb&#x27;s point.

In indirect trauma, violent abduction and retroposition of the shoulder can stretch the nerve and result tension of the coracobrachialis with musculocutaneous nerve lesion. Those with this type of lesion is presented with pain, reduced sensation, and tingling of the lateral part of forearm (lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve - terminal sensory only branch of musculocutaneous nerve) with reduced strength of elbow flexion. Tinel&#x27;s sign can be positive. Differential diagnosis includes C5 and C6 nerve root lesions of the brachial plexus where the abduction, external rotation, and elbow flexion is lost. On the other hand, rupture of the biceps can cause the loss of flexion of the elbow without sensory deficits. Rupture of the SHORT HEAD of the biceps can decrease elbow flexion strength, where the brachialis muscle is intact. Rupture of the LONG HEAD of the biceps results in mild weakening of forearm supination as long as the supinator muscle is intact. Electromyography test is negative.

In direct trauma, fracture of the humerus, gun shot, glass pieces injuries and more, can cause the musculocutaneous nerve lesion.

Iatrogenic nerve injuries (for example during orthopedic surgery involving an internal fixation of the humerus) are relatively common and in a certain percentage of cases probably inevitable, though an adequate knowledge of the surgical anatomy can help to reduce its frequency.

To diagnose traumatic nerve injury, operative exploration should be performed without delay. If reconstruction of the motor function of the musculocutaneous nerve (elbow flexion) is needed then there are several options, depending on the injury pattern and timeframes. If the nerve is in-continuity and the fascicles appear healthy under the operating microscope then Neurolysis may be sufficient. When there is a division or segment of non-viable nerve then interpositional autografting is preferred. If reinnervation is likely to take months (e.g. if the injured segment is long and long grafts are needed, or in the case of proximal injuries such as root avulsion or upper trunk injury) then nerve transfer is preferred as this will reinnervate the muscle faster; in the case of upper trunk injuries, the ideal neurotisation appears to be the double Oberlin transfer., although data on this topic are sparse and heterogeneous.

<text>Andrea Riccio (1532) was an Italian sculptor and occasional architect, whose real name was Andrea Briosco, but is usually known by his sobriquet meaning &quot;curly&quot;; he is also known as Il Riccio and Andrea Crispus (&quot;curly&quot; in Latin). He is mainly known for small bronzes, often practical objects such as inkwells, door knockers or fire-dogs, exquisitely sculpted and decorated in a classicizing Renaissance style.

He was born at Padua, and first trained as a goldsmith by his father, Ambrogio di Cristoforo Briosco. He later began to study bronze casting under Bartolomeo Bellano, a pupil of Donatello. As an architect, he is known for the church of Santa Giustina in his native city. His masterpieces are the bronze Paschal candelabrum in the choir in Basilica of Sant&#x27;Antonio at Padua (1515), and the two bronze reliefs (1507) of &quot;David dancing before the Ark&quot; and &quot;Judith and Holofernes&quot; in the same church. His bronze and marble tomb of the physician &quot;Girolamo della Torre&quot; in the church of San Fermo at Verona was beautifully decorated with reliefs, which were taken away by the French and are now in the Louvre. His smaller, easily transportable, works appealed to collectors across Europe. A bronze lamp made by Riccio was a longtime possession of the Rothschild family, and is now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

<text>Chen Sheng (died January 208 BC), also known as Chen She (&quot;She&quot; being his courtesy name), posthumously known as King Yin, was the leader of the Dazexiang Uprising, the first rebellion against the Qin dynasty. It occurred during the reign of the Second Qin Emperor.

==Life==
Chen Sheng was born in Yangcheng (陽城; in present-day Fangcheng County, Henan). In August or September 209 BC, he was a military captain along with Wu Guang when the two of them were ordered to lead 900 soldiers to Yuyang (漁陽; southwest of present-day Miyun County, Beijing) to help defend the northern border against Xiongnu. Due to storms, it became clear that they could not get to Yuyang by the deadline, and according to law, if soldiers could not get to their posts on time, they would be executed. Chen Sheng and Wu Guang, believing that they were doomed, led their soldiers to start a rebellion. They announced that Fusu, the crown prince of Qin, who had wrongly been forced to commit suicide, and Xiang Yan, a general of Chu, had not died and were joining their cause. They also declared the reestablishment of Chu.
Using 900 men to resist an empire seemed to be a suicidal move, but the people, who had felt deeply oppressed by the Qin regime, joined Chen Sheng and Wu Guang&#x27;s cause quickly. More than 20,000 men joined. Soon, there were people asking Chen Sheng to declare himself &quot;King of Chu&quot;. Acting against the advice of Zhang Er and Chen Yu, Chen Sheng declared himself &quot;King of Rising Chu&quot; ().

Chen Sheng, setting his capital at Chen County (陳縣; in present-day Huaiyang, Henan), then commissioned various generals to advance in all directions to conquer Qin territory. Among these were: Wu Guang, whom he created acting &quot;King of Chu&quot;; Zhou Wen (), whom he ordered to head west toward Qin proper; his friend Wu Chen (), whom he ordered to head north toward the old territory of Zhao; Zhou Fu (), whom he ordered to head northeast toward the old territory of Wei. However, none of these generals returned. After initial defeats Qin forces regrouped under general Zhang Han. Wu Guang was assassinated by generals under him; Zhou Wen was defeated by Qin forces; Wu Chen was initially successful but then declared himself the King of Zhao and became independent of Chu; and Zhou Fu supported a descendant of the royal house of Wei to be the King of Wei, also independent of Chu. A major reason why Wu Chen and the generals who assassinated Wu Guang broke away was that Chen Sheng was paranoid as a king: generals were executed at any sign of infidelity, even by rumours. Chen Sheng&#x27;s ruthlessness and constant defeats in battle made it harder and harder for him to gather followers. Chen Sheng was greatly weakened, and as he suffered losses at the hands of the Qin army, he personally led a force to try to gather reinforcements, but he was assassinated by his guard Zhuang Jia in January 208 BC. He died just five months after his rebellion began. However, his act of defiance provided the spark of inspiration which eventually led to the fall of the Qin dynasty.

==Legacy==
Chen Sheng was often idealized by versions of history promulgated by Chinese historians as a great leader of the peasants against intolerable oppression of the Qin nobility and bourgeois. Chen Sheng&#x27;s decisions, while motivated by his desire to overthrow Qin, were often driven by self-interest and an illusory sense of superiority; as a result he often failed to act on good advice. As the Song dynasty historian Sima Guang wrote in the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;:

Chen claimed the title of king only months after the start of his rebellion, without a sufficient foundation. Once he did, he effectively became stuck in Chen County and could not firmly hold territories that were conquered, because the people in the territories did not view him with great affection.

According to &quot;Shiji&quot;, Chen Sheng was the person who coined the Chinese proverb, &quot;How can a little songbird understand the ambitions of a grand swan!&quot; (), a saying that figures prominently in the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

He sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, usually paired with Wu Guang.

The pattern of an impostor and his general, founded by Chen Sheng, was closely followed by Han Shantong and Liu Futong in the end of Yuan dynasty.

<text>Wu Guang (, died December 209 BC or January 208 BC) was a leader of the first rebellion against the Qin dynasty during the reign of the Second Qin Emperor.
==Life==
Wu Guang was born in Yangxia (陽夏; present-day Taikang County, Zhoukou, Henan), and his courtesy name was Shu. In August or September 209 BC, he was a military captain along with Chen Sheng when the two of them were ordered to lead 900 soldiers to Yuyang (漁陽; southwest of present-day Miyun County, Beijing) to help defend the northern border against Xiongnu.

After Chen Sheng set up his capital at Chen County (陳縣; in present-day Huaiyang, Henan), he appointed Wu Guang as acting-&#x27;King of Chu&#x27; and ordered Wu to head west toward Qin proper. Wu Guang&#x27;s forces, however, became bogged down while laying siege to Xingyang (滎陽; northeast of present-day Xingyang, Henan). Wu Guang&#x27;s generals became concerned that Qin reinforcements under Zhang Han would soon arrive and attack them on two sides. They wanted to change Wu Guang&#x27;s plans, end the siege of Xingyang, and face Zhang Han&#x27;s forces directly. Unconvinced that Wu Guang would change his plans, they assassinated Wu and took over the army.

==Legacy==
Wu Guang sometimes appears as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, usually partnered with Chen Sheng.

<doc id="1287092" wikidata="Q3987741" url="?curid=1287092" title="The Jazz Butcher">
<text>The Jazz Butcher was the alias of British singer/songwriter Pat Fish (20 December 1957 – 5 October 2021). It also served as the name of the band, though adjuncts were frequently used to distinguish between Fish&#x27;s persona and band itself (The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy or JBC, the Jazz Butcher Group, the Jazz Butcher and his Sikkorskis from Hell, the Jazz Butcher Quartet and the Jazz Butcher Quintet.)

The line-up of the band changed frequently, with Pat Fish being the only constant. Notable members included band co-founder Max Eider (Peter Millson), David J. (Haskins), Owen P. Jones, Rolo McGinty, Alice Thompson, Paul Mulreany, Alex Green, Richard Formby, Kizzy O&#x27;Callaghan, Curtis E. Johnson and Peter Crouch.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
The band were formed in Oxford in 1982 by Pat Fish and Max Eider. Having met at university, Fish and Eider had previously been in bands the Institution, along with Rolo McGinty (later of The Woodentops), and The Sonic Tonix (later The Tonix) with John Silver.

Upon the breakup of The Tonix, Fish moved to Northampton, a place he described as &quot;seething with creativity, backed by a supportive local press&quot;. He began writing songs, and the first advertised Jazz Butcher performance took place at Merton College in Oxford, on 20 February 1982. Both the name, and the gig itself was &quot;perceived as a one-off laugh&quot;. Shortly thereafter, Fish reconnected with Eider, only to find that Eider’s playing style had changed to a &quot;rich, clean, country soul sound with just a touch of Wes Montgomery&quot;, which complemented the kinds of songs Fish had been writing at that time.

Around this time, Fish began recording songs using an Amstrad 7090 audio cassette recorder. The purpose of the device was to dub the contents of one cassette to another; however, Fish discovered that the microphone channel remained open, so that he could add multiple parts with each pass.

These primitive &#x27;multi-track&#x27; recordings were enough to interest David Barker, who invited Fish to record an album for his newly founded Glass Records label.

=== The Glass years (1982–1987) ===
In August / September 1982, Fish and several friends and collaborators began recording the first Jazz Butcher album at Starforce Studio in Clapham. This was co-produced by Fish and Barker (under the pseudonym &quot;Lionel Brando&quot;); contributors included Eider, McGinty, Silver, Alice Thompson, Ian Sturgess, Louis Leroi and engineer Martin K. Daley.

On 1 November 1982, Fish was approached to open for fellow Northampton band Bauhaus. The whimsical nature of the Jazz Butcher band did not impress the headliners&#x27; goth followers. &quot;The massed audience listened politely, if disconcertingly quietly&quot;, reported the &quot;Northampton Mercury and Herald&quot;. Fish was &quot;pleased to survive the experience&quot;. Fish had assumed that Bauhaus drummer Kevin Haskins had arranged their spot on the bill, as Kevin and Fish were friends; only to find that it was Haskins&#x27; brother David J. who had taken an interest in The Jazz Butcher.

&quot;In Bath of Bacon&quot; was released in March 1983. The album, according to Fish, was &quot;the sound of a few mates failing to take seriously the fact they they&#x27;ve got an LP to make&quot;. A review in &quot;The Scotsman&quot; called &quot;Bath&quot; &quot;quite good fun, if you don&#x27;t mind being used in someone else&#x27;s experiment.&quot;

In early 1984, Fish and Thompson recorded a number of cover songs, mostly by Lou Reed, John Cale and Kevin Ayers in what would be known as the “Cak Bag” sessions. Many of these would go on to appear on Glass Record compilations and fan magazines throughout the year.

The summer of 1983 found Fish and Eider back in the studio with McGinty and Thompson (who had now formed The Woodentops), joined by Kevin Haskins on drums. The result was the single &quot;Southern Mark Smith&quot;. The single gained some national recognition, having been played on “hit-maker” John Peel’s Radio show.

Glass also released two singles in 1984; &quot;Marnie&quot; and &quot;Roadrunner&quot; (Jonathan Richman). The b-side for &quot;Roadrunner&quot; featured the Max Eider song &quot;D.R.I.N.K.&quot;, which would go on to be a fan favorite.

David J.&#x27;s friendship with Fish and continued interest in the Jazz Butcher group prompted discussions of J. producing the Butcher&#x27;s next LP. However, the dissolution of Bauhaus corresponded with an opening in the bassist’s role. The line-up of Fish, Eider, Jones and David J. would be regarded as the first “official” line up, and remain so for much of 1984 into 1985.

Produced by John A. Rivers, &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot; was released in November 1984. With the help of Rivers and J., the band improved upon their studio technique. Eider’s guitar style had also strengthened since &quot;A Bath of Bacon&quot;, becoming less &quot;ornamental&quot; and more of an “essential element” to the Jazz Butcher’s sound of that time. The album shares its title with the first Sherlock Holmes short story, and features a memorable cover by comic artist Hunt Emerson. According to Fish, &quot;We were young(ish) and cocky and I think it shows….Still, it was cheap and cheerful, and it helped us to meet an awful lot of people&quot;. The record ended up selling over 20,000 copies.

The cohesion of a &quot;proper&quot; band, David J&#x27;s Bauhaus notoriety, and the success of &quot;Scandal&quot; led to a more ambitious touring schedule. 1985 was also a prolific time for the band in the studio, releasing the singles &quot;Real Men&quot; and &quot;The Human Jungle,&quot; as well as the live album &quot;Hamburg&quot; (credited to The Jazz Butcher and His Sikkorskis from Hell). Glass released &quot;The Gift of Music&quot;, which compiled many of the band&#x27;s singles and b-sides, including a re-recording of &quot;Partytime&quot;, which was a staple of their live performances.

The Jazz Butcher also released &quot;Sex and Travel&quot;, again recorded with John A. Rivers as producer. &quot;One day&#x27;s rehearsal in Kevin Haskin&#x27;s living room, five days&#x27; recording and two days&#x27; mixing was all it took for us to make my favourite of the Glass records,” said Fish in 1993.

In February 1985, David J left the band to form Love and Rockets, and Graham &quot;Felix&quot; Fudger was brought in as his replacement as the band continued with a tour schedule that was three times the year prior: 110 shows in 1985, as compared to 36 shows in 1984.

In 1986, the band released singles for &quot;Hard&quot;, &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, &quot;Angels&quot;, and the fan club–only release &quot;Christmas with the Pygmies&quot;, as well as appearing on compilation albums, such as &quot;50,000 Glass Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot; (which also features solo songs by David J. and Max Eider). &quot;Bloody Nonsense&quot;, a compilation of B-sides, was released in America and Canada, finding its way onto the college charts.

In May 1986, The Jazz Butcher returned to the studio with John A. Rivers to record their next LP, &quot;Distressed Gentlefolk&quot;. The extensive touring had honed the band’s skills, but according to Fish, they were also exhausted and went into the studio with &quot;a scanty armful of tunes&quot;, many ideas having already been released as singles. Rivers had embraced the digital revolution, which was reflected in the production. Fish and Eider had both been focused on their song writing, but their styles had begun to drift apart, with Fish leaning toward a heavier sound, and Eider maintaining a quieter, more jazz-influenced style.

Touring continued, including America and Canada for the first time in 1986. The popularity of the band was growing, but the effort was taking its toll. Fudger was replaced on bass by Richard Lohan, and Alex Green joined the band on saxophone. On 22 November 1986, after a show in Zurich, Switzerland, personal tensions, alcohol and exhaustion boiled over into a physical fight between Fish and Eider, resulting in the lead guitarist quitting the band. The tour continued without the lead guitarist and concluded on Fish&#x27;s birthday, 20 December. Shortly thereafter, Jones tendered his resignation.

Soon afterwards, Fish&#x27;s contract with Glass Records expired but not before the release of &quot;Big Questions - The Gift of Music Volume 2&quot;, another compilation of singles and b-sides.

The success of &quot;Bloody Nonsense&quot; and &quot;Distressed Gentlefolk&quot;, especially in America, led Eider to sign as a solo artist to the Jazz Butcher’s US distributor, Big Time Records. This proved unpropitious, as the record company folded shortly after having released Eider&#x27;s &quot;Best Kisser in the World&quot;. The lack of funds for promotion doomed sales of Eider&#x27;s first solo effort.

Meanwhile, Fish and Alex Green were fulfilling touring obligations throughout Europe as a duo, at venues which were largely expecting a band. According to Fish, &quot;For the most part, it was a matter of making the best of things and getting out alive&quot;.

Alan McGee, head of Creation Records, was in attendance at the show in Paris on 10 February 1987. He had specifically come with an offer to sign Fish, whose Glass contract was about to expire.

=== The Creation years (1988–1998) ===
&quot;The Jazz Butcher is one of the most brilliant incisive pop writers that Britain has produced since the glory days of Ray Davies and Pete Townshend&quot; - Alan McGee, co-founder of Creation Records.

The deal with Creation offered Fish the opportunity to reform the Jazz Butcher outfit. Kizzy O’Callahan had served as a guitar tech during the previous incarnation of the band, and Fish was already familiar with his skill as a guitarist. On Alan McGee&#x27;s recommendation, the rhythm section of Dave Goulding (bass) and Dave Morgan (drums) were borrowed from fellow Creation band the Weather Prophets as the band went in to record the next album. Alex Green on saxophone rounded out the core of the studio group, with other friends and musicians making contributions, including Sonic Boom of Spacemen 3, bassist Laurence O&#x27;Keefe and members of the Perfect Disaster. Pat considered shedding the &quot;Jazz Butcher&quot; moniker, wishing to put some distance between the new outfit and some of the sillier material of his Glass Records days. However, McGee insisted &quot;...that&#x27;s the one they all know, you&#x27;ve got to keep it.&quot;

Having felt that &quot;Distressed Gentlefolk&quot; suffered from over-production, Fish set out to make a record that had a more rough and straightforward sound. Longtime Jazz Butcher photographer, Mitch Jenkins, took the cover photo, which shows Fish and O&#x27;Callahan in front of London fish &amp; chip shop Fishcotheque, which would provide the name of the new LP. Reviewers (particularly in the US) perceived it as a continuation of the smooth, jazz-influenced approach of his earlier efforts. Still, reviews for &quot;Fishcotheque&quot; were generally positive. 1988 also saw the release of the single and video for &quot;Spooky&quot;, a cover of the Classics IV song. &quot;Spooky&quot; was also released on an EP that also included several songs recorded for a live performance on the Canadian radio program &quot;Brave New Waves&quot;.

In 1987, Fish married Barbara J Taylor in a small ceremony in Northamptonshire.

Paul Mulreany was added to the live line-up, and with Fish fronting a new band on a new label, the JBC spent most of 1988 touring Europe, the US and Canada.

For the next album, &quot;Big Planet Scarey Planet&quot;, Fish returned to producer John A. Rivers. After a year of touring, Fish reasoned &quot;We&#x27;d hardened up a lot and figured we could now withstand the Rivers&#x27; treatment&quot;. The band wanted to make a rock record that reflected some of their influences of the time, such as hip-hop and proto-acid. &quot;Consequently, there are some weird hybrids on the &#x27;Big Planet&#x27; record,&quot; Fish recalled. The song &quot;Line of Death&quot;, for example, incorporated middle eastern influence, disco, heavy metal and a nod to Ennio Morricone&#x27;s &quot;&quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;. The artwork for &quot;Big Planet Scarey Planet&quot; and its single, &quot;New Invention&quot; was created by Pascal Legras. who would be responsible for much of the Jazz Butcher&#x27;s cover art throughout the 1990s.

Just prior to a nine-week tour of the US, Kizzy O&#x27;Callahan was admitted to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a brain tumor. He was replaced by Richard Formby.

While in Los Angeles, the band was interviewed on Deirdre O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s popular alternative rock show &quot;SNAP!&quot; on KCRW. While the band agreed they would perform only one or two songs, &quot;...we get down there to KCRW and meet Deirdre O&#x27;Donoghue and she&#x27;s a real fan and she kept winding us up,&quot; recounted Fish, &quot;we ended up doing 12 or 13&quot;. Those live recordings would end up as the 4th disc of the box set Dr. Cholmondley Repents (2022).

The incarnation of the band that recorded &quot;Cult of the Basement&quot; had been together for some time and just finished a lengthy tour. Some songs which would appear on the album, such as &quot;Girl Go&quot; and &quot;Mr. Odd&quot; had been road-tested, others such as &quot;She&#x27;s on Drugs&quot; and &quot;Sister Death&quot; existed in demo form, and much of the rest of the album was developed out of band improvisation. The result was an album that was more &quot;sprawling&quot; stylistically. Fish commented &quot;I feel it&#x27;s the first time we captured the true sound of the band&quot;. &quot;She&#x27;s on Drugs&quot; enjoyed airplay on college radio, and a video for &quot;Girl-Go&quot; aired on MTV&#x27;s alternative music showcase &#x27;120 minutes&#x27; in America. &quot;Girl-Go&quot;, which makes musical and lyrical reference to the Perfect Disaster&#x27;s &quot;All the Stars&quot;, was released as a single. The B-side, &quot;Excellent&quot;, would mark the last time O&#x27;Callahan would play with the band. He died of a brain tumor in 1993.

1991 saw the release of the eponymous album by Black Eg. Credited to the fictional Von Dämmerung brothers, it was an album of ambient dance music built around synthesizers and samples. The Black Eg themselves made their live debut on 1 June 1994 at Soundshaft in London.

The band toured to promote &quot;Cult of the Basement&quot;, first in Europe, followed by a US tour with the Blue Aeroplanes, where they alternated as opener/headliner city by city. Upon his return home, Fish&#x27;s marriage began to fall apart, eventually ending in divorce. Much of the next album, &quot;Condition Blue&quot;, would deal with darker subject matter; a reflection of Fish&#x27;s own mental state at the time. According to Fish, &quot;I&#x27;m still well pleased with it as a recording, and as a piece of writing about a tough subject. I mean, *I* hate &quot;divorce rock&quot; too.&quot;

The &quot;Basement&quot; incarnation of the band had gone their separate ways after the Blue Aeroplanes tour, so once again, Fish found himself re-building his band. The basic tracks were recorded by Fish, Mulreany on drums, Alex Lee on guitar and Joe Allen on bass. A slew of contributors old and new came in to play on the record, including Formby, O&#x27;Keefe and Green; Glass era drummer Owen Jones; Peter Astor, Sumishta Brahm, and Peter Crouch among others. Two singles emerged from the album, &quot;She&#x27;s a Yo-Yo&quot; and &quot;Shirley Maclaine&quot;. On the US version of the CD, &quot;She&#x27;s a Yo-Yo&quot; serves as the opening track, flipping the A- and B-sides of the European release. This was a judgement on the part of the record company to lead with a &quot;hit song&quot;. &quot;It makes no sense at all,&quot; said Fish, &quot;and I totally agree with the reviewers who say it (the album) peters out.&quot; The album was less whimsical than previous albums, containing more of the band&#x27;s &quot;art misery&quot; songs. Overall, it was &quot;warmly received by The Outside World,&quot; according to Fish, &quot;less popular among those who counted themselves JBC aficionados.&quot;

Once again, Fish found himself needing to re-build the band. Peter Crouch, who had played on Condition Blue came on board as guitarist, with Dooj Wilkenson and Nick Burson on bass and drums. This third incarnation of the JBC toured the United States (which resulted in the live release, Western Family), and in January 1993 went chose Richard Formby&#x27;s Woodhouse Studios to record what would become &quot;Waiting For the Love Bus&quot;. Whereas Fish went into the &quot;Condition Blue&quot; sessions with several demos and a long list of backing players, &quot;Love Bus&quot; saw Fish with very little material, and a small, but tight group of musicians. The result was an album with, according to Fish, &quot;a clean, simple sound...that &quot;Condition Blue&quot; detractors might appreciate.&quot; Unlike its predecessor, most of whose tracks clocked in at over six minutes, &quot;Waiting For The Love Bus&quot; is composed mostly of short, straightforward pop tunes.

The rest of 1993 was spent briefly touring Europe and sporadic gigs closer to home. During this time, Peter Crouch left the band to be replaced by Curtis E. Johnson, and Nick Burson moved to Canada and was replaced on drums by Gabriel Turner. Guitarist Dave Henderson joined the line-up in 1994, as The Jazz Butcher Conspiracy went into the studio to record their 10th album, &quot;Illuminate&quot;. The intention of the band was to create a more &quot;down to earth&quot; album than its sprawling predecessors. &quot;Illuminate&quot;″s songs include punk rants against the Tory government, pop songs about dolphins, salutes to Brian Eno and Hammer Films, and imagines a utopian past, where dinosaurs rule a &quot;world without people&quot;. The album was produced by David J., and released on 3 April 1995; it produced one single, &quot;Sixteen Years&quot;.

Meanwhile, the Creation label had gained the reputation for releasing many critically acclaimed albums, with very few being commercial hits. McGee sold half the company to Sony Music. Shortly thereafter, Creation signed the band Oasis, who became a huge critical and commercial success. Their second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, became the biggest-selling British album of the decade. According to Fish, support from Sony/Creation began to wane; &quot;Honestly, there wasn&#x27;t enough time in the day to do anything other than handle Oasis business.&quot;

Fish and Max Eider had begun to mend fences in the mid-1990s, and July 1995 saw Max Eider opening for the JBC at a gig in London. He was brought onstage for an encore of &quot;Zombie Love&quot;, marking the first time they&#x27;d played together since Eider left the group in 1986. Pat and Max soon found themselves playing together occasionally again as a duo. 

Despite the reunion with his former partner, Fish felt the Jazz Butcher moniker was limiting his musical exploration. Seeking to create another vehicle for himself, he formed the band Sumosonic. This was a stylistic shift from the JBC, making use of samplers, synthesizers and sequencers. A single, &quot;Come, Friendly Spacemen&quot;, was released in 1996, with the album &quot;This is Sumo&quot; appearing in 1998. Sumosonic was much more dance/techno driven, yet Fish&#x27;s lyrics contained many of the hallmarks of the Jazz Butcher material. Sales of &quot;This is Sumo&quot; were dismal. Alan McGee had begun to see the result of operations being handled by Sony accountants and marketing managers, and how it was affecting less commercial artists on the Creation label. Fish received a letter from McGee suggesting a parting of the ways: &quot;We&#x27;d better jack it in before you get bitter,&quot; Fish recounts. By March 1998, Fish was no longer signed to Creation. The next year, Creation ceased operations. Without the support of a label, Sumosonic played their final show in September 1998.

=== &quot;Rotten Soul&quot; (1999–2000) ===
In 1999, Pat received an invitation from Vinyl Japan to record an album for their label. The budget, according to Fish, was about 10% of what it cost to make &quot;Cult of the Basement&quot;. Former guitarist Peter Crouch had, at this time, been recording demos on a digital multi-track recorder. Fish thought this might be an effective means of recording an album within the budget parameters. This approach presented several limitations; most notably the use of MIDI drums, &quot;the sound of which is not clever&quot; according to Fish. Mixing the album was also challenging, as the home recorder lacked effects and nuance. The resulting album, &quot;Rotten Soul&quot;, was generally criticized for its poor production, though it was warmly embraced by the fans.

On 9 September 1999, Fish, Eider, Owen Jones, and David J. and Kevin Haskins performed at the Troubadour in Los Angeles. This was the first time the &quot;original line-up&quot; had performed together since David J left the band in 1985. In 2000, Fish, Eider and Jones did a small tour of the US in support of the &quot;Rotten Soul&quot; album, with Steven D. Valentine on Bass.

=== Wilson (2001–2011) ===
Fish continued to seek a creative outlet outside of the Jazz Butcher, and in 2001 the group Wilson formed. Composed of members of Sumosonic, and other Northampton bands, Wilson expanded on the Sumosonic sound.

2002 marked the 20th anniversary of the JBC, which the band marked by playing a handful of gigs in Germany and Belgium.

In 2009, Wilson performed its last show before disbanding, which was recorded and released as &quot;No Known Predators&quot; on DVD. A one-off reunion show promoted the release of the DVD in 2012, and marked the last time Wilson would perform.

=== &quot;Last of the Gentleman Adventurers&quot; (2012–2013) ===
2012 marked the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Fish and Eider decided to recognize the occasion with a new studio album, their first in over a decade. Not having the support of a record company, they decided to raise the funds themselves via PledgeMusic. Uncertain if they still had the fan support to raise the money, Fish was trepidatious as the fundraiser was launched. &quot;By the time I went to bed that night,&quot; Fish recalled, &quot;we were at something like 120 percent.&quot;

&quot;Last of the Gentleman Adventurers&quot; was recorded in August and September 2012 at Richard Formby&#x27;s studio in Leeds. Tim Harries and Jonny Mattock were brought in as the rhythm section, with Formby on guitar, and contributions from Owen Jones and Sonic Boom. Liner notes were provided by Fish&#x27;s friend, author and fellow Northampton resident, Alan Moore.

The album sold its original pressing of 500, and another 500 were pressed. Around this time, Fire Records became interested, not only in the new album, but the Butcher&#x27;s entire back catalogue. Fish had been given the rights to his albums by both David Barker and Alan McGee, and so a deal was made to sell the Glass and Creation albums, as well as &quot;Gentleman Adventurers&quot; to Fire Records.

Around this time, Fish began playing with Steve New and Steve Garofalo, and were soon joined by Simon Taylor on trumpet to form the Jazz Butcher Quartet. Eider joined the band for the occasional gig in support of Gentleman Adventurers, but ultimately decided to retire from live performance. His last appearance was on 21 August 2014, in Brixton.

In January 2016, Garofalo passed away. Outings for the quartet became fewer and far between, joined on drums by Dave Morgan and others.

=== Fire Records reissues, &quot;Live From Fishy Mansions&quot; (2017–2021) ===
2017 saw the first of the Fire Records reissues, with a four-disc box set titled &quot;The Wasted Years&quot;. This set, with extensive liner notes by Fish, contained the albums &quot;Bath of Bacon&quot;, &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, &quot;Sex &amp; Travel&quot;, and &quot;Distressed Gentlefolk&quot;. Each album was also released individually on vinyl.

in 2018, &quot;The Violent Years&quot; was released (not to be confused with the Creation-era compilation CD of the same name). This set contained the first four Creation releases: &quot;Fishcotheque&quot;, &quot;Big Planet Scarey Planet&quot;, &quot;Cult of the Basement&quot;, and &quot;Condition Blue&quot;.

In November 2018, Fish received a cancer diagnosis. He was given a treatment of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and in June 2020 received a letter of remission.

His illness, followed by the pandemic, had largely prevented Fish from performing regularly. In July 2020 he began what would become a series of concerts from his living room, streamed live for fans around the world. &quot;Live From Fishy Mansions&quot; featured Fish solo performing old songs and new, covers and requests, and these performances would draw a couple hundred viewers from around the world, including fans, friends and former bandmates.

=== Death, &quot;The Highest in the Land&quot; (2021–2022) ===
On 26 June 2021, Fish and company went into the studio to record what would become &quot;The Highest in the Land&quot;. Contributors included Max Eider, Dave Morgan, Tim Harries, Stevie Gordon, Joe Woolley, Simon Taylor, and Peter Crouch. Lee Russell was brought on to produce.

On Sunday 3 October 2021, Fish cancelled a scheduled &quot;Fishy Mansions&quot; show, citing exhaustion from a lack of sleep, possibly caused by sleep apnea. The session was rescheduled for the following Sunday. On Tuesday 5 October, Fish suffered a heart attack and died at his home in Northampton. He was interred at Olney Green Burial Ground on 4 November 2021.

Tapete released the song &quot;Time&quot; on 9 October 2021.

A third box set, &quot;Dr. Cholmonley Repents; A-Sides, B-Sides and Seasides&quot; was released on November 12, 2021. This set was a compilation of singles and b-sides, as well as a live in-studio broadcast recorded at KCRW on December 6, 1989.

&quot;The Highest in the Land&quot; was released on 4 February 2022.

=== Tributes ===
On 27 November 2021, at the Dublin Castle in London, a show that Fish had been scheduled to perform became a tribute show. Performers included Joe Turner, Tim Keegan, Pete Astor, Rolo McGinty, Bid of the Monochrome Set, Peter Crouch, Sumishta Brahm, and Dave Morgan.

In May 2022, &quot;Miracles and Wonders: A Meandering, Cacophonous Concordance of The Jazz Butcher Songbook&quot; by Pat Fish and Philip Snow was published. The book contains Fish&#x27;s recollections of albums, songs and events spanning the Jazz Butcher&#x27;s nearly-40-year history. Fish passed away shortly before the book&#x27;s completion.

An alternate version of &quot;Never Give Up&quot; was released on Glass Modern on 7 October 2022.

== Lyrical themes ==
Fish&#x27;s study of (and affection for) the classics informs much of the Jazz Butcher oeuvre. His literary references include Arthur Conan Doyle, Christopher Isherwood, John Keats, Flann O&#x27;Brien, Thomas Pynchon, Hans Stefan Santesson, St. Francis of Assisi, and the Book of Common Prayer. Fish was known for his fondness for animals, particularly cats, who appear often in his songs. There are many pop culture references found in the Jazz Butcher&#x27;s music; TV shows such as &quot;The Human Jungle&quot;, movies such as &quot;Blood From the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, celebrities (Shirley MacLaine, Peter Lorre, Edie Sedgwick), musicians (Alice Cooper, Lionel Richie, Lemmy, David Bowie, Prince, Brian Wilson), and political figures (Margaret Thatcher, Olof Palme, Dan Quayle, Oliver North). Fish&#x27;s love for the monster/horror genre (perhaps sparked by a family friend association with Hammer film director Terence Fisher, whom Fish referred to as &quot;Uncle Terry&quot;) is evidenced in songs like &quot;Zombie Love&quot;, &quot;The Jazz Butcher Meets Count Dracula&quot;, &quot;Panic in Room 109&quot;, and many others.
