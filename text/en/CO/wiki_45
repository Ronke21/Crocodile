<text>Barnabas Collins is a fictional character, a featured role in the ABC daytime serial &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, which aired from 1966 to 1971. Barnabas is a 175-year-old vampire in search of fresh blood and his lost love, Josette. The character, originally played by Canadian actor Jonathan Frid, was introduced in an attempt to resurrect the show&#x27;s flagging ratings, and was originally to have only a brief 13-week run. He was retained due to his popularity and the program&#x27;s quick spike in ratings, and virtually became the star of the show.

A defining feature of Barnabas&#x27; character development is his gradual but persistent transformation from a sinister, frightening creature of the night into the show&#x27;s protagonist, who selflessly, heroically and repeatedly risks his &quot;life&quot; to save the Collins family from catastrophe.

In the 1991 NBC revival version of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, British actor Ben Cross played the role of Barnabas Collins. Alec Newman played the part in the unreleased 2004 pilot film. In the recent series of audio dramas produced by Big Finish Productions, he is portrayed by Andrew Collins, while Frid returned to portray the role a final time in the audio drama &quot;The Night Whispers&quot;. The role is played by Johnny Depp in director Tim Burton&#x27;s 2012 film, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;.

Barnabas Collins was the main character in most of the 32 &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; paperback novels written by Marilyn Ross (Canadian author W.E.D. Ross) from the late 1960s to the early &#x27;70s. (Ross wrote hundreds of novels in several genres and under various pseudonyms.)

&quot;TV Guide&quot; named Barnabas Collins #8 in its 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.

==Origin==
Barnabas Collins was born in 1770, as the son of Joshua Collins (Louis Edmonds) and Naomi Collins (Joan Bennett), in Collinsport, Maine. Barnabas developed close ties with his uncle Jeremiah Collins. During the flashback, Barnabas intended to marry an heiress from Martinique named Josette du Pres (Kathryn Leigh Scott), but had a brief affair with Angelique Bouchard (Lara Parker), Josette&#x27;s maidservant.

On Angelique&#x27;s arrival in Collinsport for the wedding in 1795, Barnabas was determined not to resume his affair. The spurned Angelique Bouchard, a practitioner of witchcraft, used a number of spells to manipulate Barnabas and his family and force his agreement to marry her. Barnabas discovered Angelique&#x27;s duplicity, and shot her. With what she believed to be her dying words, she took revenge on Barnabas by summoning a vampire bat from hell to attack him. Barnabas fell extremely ill and died. Angelique survived and attempted to rescind the curse, but was unsuccessful.

Barnabas shortly thereafter rose as a vampire, and soon strangled Angelique. Collins later frightened his aunt Abigail (Clarice Blackburn) to death, and left the hatefully fanatic witch-hunter Reverend Trask (Jerry Lacy) entombed alive in the Old House basement. Sarah Collins died of pneumonia after a cold night spent hiding in the woods from her deceased brother. Adding to Barnabas&#x27; grief, his mother Naomi committed suicide after discovering his secret. Barnabas Collins blamed Angelique for the deaths of both his sister and his mother, and also blamed Lt. Nathan Forbes (Joel Crothers), who had told Naomi about him. Barnabas strangled Forbes, and attempted to transform Josette into a vampire. Josette was willing, if not fully cognizant of what this would entail, until Angelique revealed a vision of what she would become. Fleeing from Barnabas, Josette leapt off the cliffs of Widow&#x27;s Hill to her death.

Unable to bear what he had become, Barnabas Collins asked his father, Joshua, to destroy him. Joshua Collins was unable to slay his son, and ordered servant Ben Stokes (Thayer David) to nail a cross to the inside lid of Barnabas&#x27; coffin and to wrap chains on its outside, forever imprisoning the vampire in a secret room of the family mausoleum at Eagle&#x27;s Hill Cemetery.

==The return of Barnabas Collins==
In 1967, while searching the Collins family crypt for their rumored lost jewels, Willie Loomis (John Karlen) stumbled upon the chained coffin in which Barnabas slept. Believing the coffin to contain the Collins family riches, Willie inadvertently released the vampire. Barnabas attacked Willie and turned him into his unwilling servant.

Barnabas Collins introduced himself to the modern Collins family as a cousin from England, a hard-working businessman never seen during the day. The family accepted this story, despite having never before heard of him, because of his resemblance to the portrait of the ancestral Barnabas which hung in Collinwood. The thirsty Barnabas made victims of several Collinsport residents. He was particularly taken with waitress Maggie Evans (Kathryn Leigh Scott), who resembled his long-lost love, Josette. Barnabas was told by David Collins (David Henesy) that Josette&#x27;s spirit still haunted the Collinwood estate, where it periodically helped and protected others, including young David. Barnabas Collins kidnapped Maggie, hypnotized her to believe that she was Josette, and planned to make her his vampire bride. Maggie escaped with help from the ghost of Sarah Collins, but the emotional distress of being kidnapped caused Maggie to regress to a childlike mentality and to forget all that had happened. Barnabas Collins then targeted David&#x27;s governess, Victoria Winters (Alexandra Moltke) as a potential consort. He tried to seduce her away from her fiancé Burke Devlin (Anthony George), and then to bite her. The ghost of Sarah appeared repeatedly throughout and warned Barnabas, who was tormented by a feeling of responsibility for her death, away from evil deeds.

Maggie was sent to Wyndcliff Sanitarium, where Dr. Julia Hoffman (Grayson Hall) tried to get her to remember what happened and to identify her kidnapper. Dr. Hoffman found that the answer lay somewhere at Collinwood, and discovered who and what Barnabas was. Julia fell in love with Barnabas and attempted to cure him, and hypnotized Maggie to forget everything Barnabas had tried to do to her. Barnabas Collins initially distrusted Julia, and when her medical cure failed, viewed her as a risk who would be able to expose his true nature. He attempted to kill Julia, or to drive her mad so that no one would believe her accusations. Ultimately, Barnabas came to see Julia as a useful ally. The romantic relationship Julia desired never happened on-screen, but she became Barnabas&#x27; chief confidante and helped him many times, while Barnabas Collins became genuinely devoted to Julia and would go to extraordinary lengths to protect or rescue her when she ran afoul of enemies such as Angelique (eventually a firm friend), ghosts, and the ancient Leviathans.

==Barnabas&#x27;s women==
Barnabas Collins&#x27;s great love was his fiancée from 1795, Josette du Pres, but throughout the show he had interest in many different women, including Maggie Evans, Victoria Winters and Roxanne Drew. He wanted these women to share his vampire existence, and wanted Maggie and Victoria to assume the identity of Josette. His closest ally and friend was Dr. Julia Hoffman, who was quietly in love with him and supported his attempts to find happiness. While aware that Julia did have strong feelings for him, Barnabas&#x27; complex feelings for Julia evolved from initial fear and distrust to deep affection, devotion and protection. At one point, Barnabas Collins admitted to Willie Loomis that he cared for Julia more than he appeared to.

==Other appearances==
The 1970 MGM film &quot;House of Dark Shadows&quot; centers on the release of Barnabas Collins from his coffin by Willie Loomis. Unlike Frid&#x27;s television portrayal of Barnabas, the Barnabas featured in the film was truer to a typical evil vampire, who by the end of the film had killed half of the Collins family. Barnabas himself is killed by Jeff Clark, now depicted as Maggie&#x27;s boyfriend, and a dying Willie Loomis, when Barnabas tries to make Maggie Evans his vampire bride. Barnabas does not appear in the sequel, &quot;Night of Dark Shadows&quot;, which focuses on another relation, Quentin Collins.

In the 2012 film &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, Barnabas is played by Johnny Depp as a somewhat-modernized version of the character from the original series. He has a deep obsession with Josette, has no forgiveness for those who betray him, and believes that his curse can be reversed. He shows deep emotions for his modern family members, whose lives he longs to be part of. He displays his television counterpart&#x27;s powers and abilities, while subject to his cold vampire instincts. Barnabas tries to win the love of David&#x27;s governess Maggie Evans, now called Victoria Winters, who reminds him of his lost beloved Josette. Depp&#x27;s version is up to date with popular culture and has a strong taste for rock music. He wears a hair and clothing style similar to his late 1960s counterpart, but dresses more colorfully. His character is portrayed as somewhat more sexually active and eccentric than before. This incarnation has a different relationship with Dr. Hoffman, who never becomes his ally.

==Personality==
Barnabas often blamed his moments of cruelty on his transformation into one of the undead or &quot;nosferatu,&quot; but other characters revealed that Barnabas was not always the reluctant victim that he claimed. He carried on a sexual dalliance with the obsessed Angelique despite his claim of love for Josette, which set in motion many tragedies in his life. Jealousy and wounded male pride caused him to fatally wound his uncle in a duel, after Jeremiah&#x27;s elopement with Josette. He attempted to back out of his agreement to marry Angelique after she cured his sister of illness. Given proof that his newlywed bride Angelique was a witch, he attempted to murder her. A drunken Ben Stokes admitted that Barnabas, prior to his change, &quot;... weren&#x27;t no good then, neither — but now, he&#x27;s worse!&quot; When the vampire tried to silence his own father by killing him, an astonished Joshua Collins exclaimed: &quot;You would kill even me! You must have always had so much hatred in you. No one could be filled with it so quickly!&quot; While many of his flip-flopping infatuations with nubile young women could be attributed to his vampire curse and his need to find a vampire bride, his romantic choices during his periods as a human were equally immature and baffling. In later interviews, Jonathan Frid admitted this was all part of the character&#x27;s success, &quot;... the lies he told to himself.&quot;

However harsh or impulsive he may have been, Barnabas is nevertheless not without a conscience, either as a human or as a vampire. He is shown to be capable of feeling guilt for wrongs committed, as well as love for other people. For example, he shows a softer side for Dr. Julia Hoffman as he becomes closer to her, and once mentioned that he cared for her more than he let on. He risked his &quot;life&quot; whenever she was in grave trouble, and only when the Leviathans gave the order to have Julia killed did Barnabas have the strength to break free of their control. When Angelique tried to endanger Julia&#x27;s life, an enraged Barnabas warned her that if she ever tried to harm Julia again, he would personally see to her own destruction. His confrontation with Angelique over the deaths that his curse had caused revealed that he did care deeply for his mother, his sister and for Josette.

==Powers==
Barnabas&#x27; abilities mimic those of the classic vampire Dracula, and include immortality, superhuman strength, superhuman speed, hypnotism, shape-shifting and teleportation. However, Barnabas has also been known to use sorcery. In an early storyline, he attempted to drive Julia mad by conjuring the spirit of her dead colleague, Dave Woodard. In 1795, Barnabas briefly resurrected Josette DuPres, who in the 20th century would warn the Collins family of approaching danger while wandering the Collinwood halls, and he used visions to lure Rev. Trask into a fatal trap. These seemingly magical abilities were never explained, but made Barnabas a deadly protagonist.

==Notes==
Jonathan Frid first appeared as Barnabas Collins in 1967 in episode #211, but Collins&#x27; hand was briefly seen in the climax to episode #210, prior to Frid&#x27;s introduction. Series regular Timothy Gordon (uncredited) provided the hand, which was first seen choking Willie Loomis.

In a 1971 &quot;TV Guide&quot; article, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; head-writer Sam Hall discussed the outline the show&#x27;s finale would have taken had it not been canceled sooner than anticipated. Among other things, the plans involved Barnabas, a vampire once again, becoming mysteriously ill. Julia, deducing that his illness was due to his unique connection to Adam, would travel to Singapore to treat Adam, and there fall seriously ill herself. The now-recovered Barnabas would come to her and, at long last, declare his love and ask her to become his wife. Knowing that Angelique would never allow Julia to live, they would remain in the Far East after their marriage, and Julia would permanently cure Barnabas of his vampirism.

<doc id="1283925" wikidata="Q3527304" url="?curid=1283925" title="Reality therapy">
<text>Reality therapy (RT) is an approach to psychotherapy and counseling developed by William Glasser in the 1960s. It differs from conventional psychiatry, psychoanalysis and medical model schools of psychotherapy in that it focuses on what Glasser calls &quot;psychiatry&#x27;s three Rs&quot; – realism, responsibility, and right-and-wrong – rather than mental disorders. Reality therapy maintains that most people suffer from socially universal human conditions rather than individual mental illnesses, and that failure to attain basic needs leads to a person&#x27;s behavior moving away from the norm. Since fulfilling essential needs is part of a person&#x27;s present life, reality therapy does not concern itself with a person&#x27;s past. Neither does this type of therapy deal with unconscious mental processes.

The reality therapy approach to counseling and problem-solving focuses on here-and-now actions and the ability to create and choose a better future. Typically, counseled people seek to discover what they really want and how they are currently choosing to behave in order to achieve these goals. According to Glasser, the social component of psychological disorders has been overlooked in the rush to label the population as sick or mentally ill. If a social problem causes distress to a person, it is not always because of a labelled sickness, it may sometimes just be the inability to satisfy one&#x27;s psychological needs. Reality therapy attempts to separate the person from their behavior.

== History ==
Reality therapy was developed at the Veterans Administration hospital in Los Angeles in the early 1960s by William Glasser and his mentor and teacher, psychiatrist G. L. Harrington. In 1965, Glasser published the book &quot;Reality Therapy&quot; in the United States. The term refers to a process that is people-friendly and people-centered and has nothing to do with giving people a dose of reality (as a threat or punishment), but rather helps people to recognize how fantasy can distract them from their choices they control in life. Glasser posits that the past is not something to be dwelled upon but rather to be resolved and moved past in order to live a more fulfilling and rewarding life.
By the 1970s, the concepts were extended into what Glasser then called &quot;control theory&quot;, a term used in the title of several of his books. By the mid-1990s, the still evolving concepts were described as &quot;choice theory&quot;, a term conceived and proposed by the Irish reality therapy practitioner Christine O&#x27;Brien Shanahan at the 1995 IRTI Conference in Waterford, Ireland and subsequently adopted by Glasser . The practice of reality therapy remains a cornerstone of the larger body of his work. Choice theory asserts that each of us is a self-determining being who can choose (many of our) future behaviors and hold ourselves consciously responsible for how we are acting, thinking, feeling, and also for our physiological states. Choice theory attempts to explain, or give an account of, how each of us attempts to control our world and those within that world.

== Approach ==
According to Glasser, human beings have four basic psychological needs after survival: the most important need being to love and be loved by another person or group for a feeling of belonging; the need for power, through learning, achieving, feeling worthwhile, winning and through being competent; the need for freedom, including independence and autonomy while simultaneously exercising personal responsibility; the need for fun, pleasure seeking enjoyment and relaxation is also a very important need for good psychological health.

One of the core principles of reality therapy is that, whether people are aware of it or not, they are always trying to meet these essential human needs. These needs must all be balanced and met for a person to function most effectively. However, people don&#x27;t necessarily act effectively at achieving these goals. Socializing with others is one effective way of meeting the need to belong. But how a person chooses to interact with and gain attention and love from others is most often at the root of their psychological dismay. Reality therapy stresses one major point—people are in control of what they are currently doing in their lives whether or not it is working in their favor toward meeting their basic psychological needs for power, belonging, fun and freedom. And it is through an individual&#x27;s choices that he or she makes change happen for the better or worse.

For most people in the United States, the survival need is normally being met. It is then in how people meet the remaining four psychological needs that they typically run into trouble. Reality therapy holds that the key to behavior is to remain aware of what an individual presently wants and make choices that will ensure that goal. Reality therapy maintains that what really drives human beings is their need to belong and to be loved. What also drives humans is their yearnings to be free, and with that freedom comes great responsibility (one cannot exist without the other). Reality therapy is very much a therapy of decision (or choice) and change, based upon the conviction that, even though human persons often have let themselves become products of their past&#x27;s powerful influences, they need not be held forever hostage by those earlier influences.

==Role played by the therapist==

Reality therapy seeks to treat patients who face difficulty in working out a relationship with others. So, the formation of a connection of the patient with the therapist is regarded as an important milestone at the start of the therapy. According to the therapists, bonding of the patients with their therapists is the most crucial dynamic that would facilitate the healing process. As soon as this bonding is stable, it can help to form a fulfilling connection outside the therapeutic environment.

Patients receiving this kind of therapeutic treatment will learn various ways to strengthen relationships in the most suitable manner possible and that too in the absence of their therapists&#x27; safe relationship. Moreover, they will be able to use their newfound skills in their personal lives.

Reality therapists say that when patients are able to use the skills, behaviors, actions, and methods learned through the therapy in their personal lives, then they will be able to successfully work out external relationships as well. This will provide them with the satisfaction of leading a more fulfilling life.

==Core ideas==

===Action===
Glasser believes that there are five basic needs of all human beings: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom or independence, and fun/pleasure. Reality therapy maintains that the main reason a person is in pain and acting out is because he/she lacks that one important &#x27;other being&#x27; to connect with, or lacks another basic need for survival. Glasser believes the need for love and belonging is the most primary need because we all need other people in our lives in order to satisfy the rest of our needs. Therefore, in a cooperative therapeutic relationship, the therapist must create an environment where it is possible for the client to feel connected to another &#x27;responsible&#x27; person (the therapist) whom they actually like and might choose as a friend in their real life.

Reality therapy maintains that the core problem of psychological distress is that one or more of the client&#x27;s essential needs are not being met thereby causing the client to act irresponsibly or make poor choices. The therapist then addresses this issue and asserts that the client assume responsibility for their behavior. Reality therapy asserts that we learn responsibility through involvement with other responsible people. We can learn and re-learn responsibility at any time in life&quot;. The therapist focuses on realistic attainable goals in order to remedy the real life issues that are causing discomfort.

William Glasser&#x27;s choice theory is composed of four aspects: thinking, acting, feeling, and physiology. We can directly choose our thoughts and our actions; we have great difficulty in directly choosing our feelings and our physiology (physical effects such as sweaty palms, headaches, nervous tics, racing pulse, etc.).

A critical first step is the client learning how to use their emotions and feelings to self-evaluate. The client must realize that something must change; realize and accept that change is, in fact, possible and can lead to a plan for making better choices. The therapist helps the client create a workable plan to reach a goal; this is at the heart of successful reality therapy. It must be the client&#x27;s plan, not the counselor&#x27;s. The essence of a workable plan is that the client can implement it. It is based on factors under the client&#x27;s control. Reality therapy strives to empower people by emphasizing the power of doing what is under their control. &quot;Doing&quot; is at the heart of reality therapy.

===Behavior===

Behavior is an immediate and live source of information about whether we are happy with what is going on in our lives. It is very hard to choose to change our emotions directly, thus it is much easier to change our thinking, which will lead to more positive emotions. The client must make a conscious decision to alter his/her thought process. For example, to consciously decide that we will no longer think of ourselves as victims, or to decide that in our thoughts we will concentrate on what we can do rather than what we think everybody else ought to do. Reality therapists approach changing &quot;what we do&quot; as a key to changing how we feel and how we will work to obtain what we want. These ideas are similar to those in other therapy movements such as Re-evaluation Counseling and person-centered psychotherapy, although the former emphasizes emotional release as a method of clearing emotional hurt.

===Control===
Control is a key issue in reality therapy. Human beings need control to meet their needs: one person seeks control through position and money, and another wants to control their physical space. Control gets a client into trouble in two primary ways: when he or she tries to control other people, and when he or she uses drugs and alcohol to give him or her a false sense of control. At the very heart of choice theory is the core belief that the only person the client can really control is him or herself. If the client thinks he or she can control others, then he or she is moving in the direction of frustration. If the client thinks others can control him or her and follows up by blaming them for all that goes on in his or her life, then he or she tends to do nothing and heads for frustration. There may be events that happen to the client which is out of his or her control, but ultimately, it is up to the client to choose how to respond to these events. Trying to control other people is a vain naive hope, from the point of view of reality therapy. It is a never-ending battle which alienates the client from others and causes endless pain and frustration. This is why it is vital for the client to stick to what is in his or her own control and to respect the rights of other people to meet their needs. The client can, of course, get an instant sense of control from alcohol and some other drugs. This method of control, however, is false, and skews the true level of control the client has over him or herself. This creates an inconsistent level of control which creates even more dissonance and frustration.

===Focus on the present===
While traditional psychoanalysis and counseling often focuses on past events, reality therapy and choice theory solutions lie in the client&#x27;s present and future. Practitioners of reality therapy may visit the past but never dwell on it. In reality therapy, the past is seen as the source of the client&#x27;s wants and his/her ways of behaving. Supposedly each person from birth has ‘taken pictures,’ stored mental images which comprise ones’ “Quality World.” A client&#x27;s &#x27;Quality World&#x27; is examined as to what this person wants in his life and is it realistic. Each person strives to attain things which have given them pleasure in the past. Everyone&#x27;s ‘quality world’ is different, so naturally when people enter into a relationship their ‘quality world’ most likely will not match up with that of their new partner.

==Process==

===Involvement===
Establishing a relationship with the client is believed to be the most important factor in all types of therapy. Without this relationship, the other steps will not be effective. This is also known as developing a good rapport with the client. In extreme cases, the therapist may be the only person in the client&#x27;s life who is willing to put up with the client&#x27;s behavior long enough to establish a relationship, which can require a great deal of patience from the therapist. In other cases, the client is a part of many relationships, but just needs a relationship with a more consistently positive emphasis. According to Glasser, the client needs to feel that the therapist is someone that he would want in his &quot;Quality World.” 

===Evaluating current behavior===
The therapist must emphasize the here and now with the client, focusing on the current behaviors and attitudes. The therapist asks the client to make a value judgment about his or her current behavior (which presumably is not beneficial, otherwise the client may not have negative consequences from behavior motivating enough to seek therapy). In many cases the therapist must press the client to examine the effects of his or her behavior, but it is important that the judgment be made by the client and not the therapist. According to Glasser, it is important for the client to feel that he is in control of his own life.

===Planning possible behavior===
Plan some behavior that is likely to work better. The client is likely to need some suggestions and prompting from the therapist, but it helps if the plan itself comes from the client. It is important that the initial steps be small enough that the client is almost certain to succeed, in order to build confidence.
In many cases, the client&#x27;s problem is the result of a bad relationship with someone, and since the client cannot change anyone else&#x27;s behavior, the therapist will focus on things the client can do unilaterally. The client may be concerned that the other person will take advantage of this and not reciprocate, but in most cases a change in behavior will ease the tension enough that the other person also backs off. If this does not happen, the therapist will also encourage the client to build more positive relationships with other people. The relationship with the therapist sustains the client long enough for them to establish these other relationships.

===Commitment to the plan===
The participant must make a commitment to carry out the plan. This is important because many clients will do things for the therapist that they would not do just for themselves. In some cases it can be helpful to make the commitment in writing.

===&quot;No Excuses, No Punishment, Never Give Up&quot;===
If there is no punishment, then there is no reason to accept excuses (note that punishment can be ineffective with clients who expect to fail, see Learned helplessness). The therapist insists that the client either carries out the plan, or comes up with a more feasible plan. If the therapist maintains a good relationship with the client, it can be very hard to resist carrying out a plan that the client has agreed would be feasible. If the plan is too ambitious for the client&#x27;s current abilities, then the therapist and the client work out a different plan.

==Principles==
There are several basic principles of reality therapy that must be applied to make this technique most successful.

*Focus on the present and avoid discussing the past because all human problems are caused by unsatisfying present relationships.
*Avoid discussing symptoms and complaints as much as possible since these are often the ineffective ways that clients choose to deal with (and hold on to) unsatisfying relationships.
*Understand the concept of total behavior, which means focus on what clients can do, directly act, and think.
*Spend less time on what they cannot do directly such as changing their feelings and physiology. Feelings and physiology can be changed indirectly, but only if there is a change in the acting and thinking.
*Avoid , blaming and/or complaining and help clients do the same. By doing this, they learn to avoid these extremely harmful external control behaviors that destroy relationships.
*Help changing the 7 deadly behaviours - Criticising, Blaming, Complaining, Nagging, Threatening, Punishing, Bribing. 
*Remain non-judgmental and non-coercive, but encourage people to judge all they are doing by the Choice Theory axiom: Is what I am doing getting me closer to the people I need? If the choice of behaviors is not getting people closer, then the therapist works to help the client find new behaviors that lead to a better connection.
*Teach clients that legitimate or not, excuses stand directly in the way of their ability to make needed connections.
*Focus on specifics. Find out as soon as possible who clients are disconnected from and work to help them choose reconnecting behaviors. If they are completely disconnected, focus on helping them find a new connection.
*Help them make specific, workable plans to reconnect with the people they need, and then follow through on what was planned by helping them evaluate their progress. Based on their experience, therapists may suggest plans, but should not give the message that there is only one plan. A plan is always open to revision or rejection by the client.
*Be patient and supportive but keep focusing on the source of the problem: disconnectedness. Clients who have been disconnected for a long time will find it difficult to reconnect. They are often so involved in the harmful behavior that they have lost sight of the fact that they need to reconnect. Help them to understand Choice Theory and explain that whatever their complaint, reconnecting is the best possible solution to their problem.

== Applications ==

In education, reality therapy can be used as a basis for the school&#x27;s classroom management plan. Reality therapy has been shown to be effective in improving underachieving junior high school students&#x27; internal perception of control. Their internal perception of control refers to their locus of control being internal or external. Reality therapy can be used to help school psychologists improve students with emotional and behavioral disturbances. Cynthia Palmer Mason and Jill Duba, professors at Western Kentucky University, have proposed reality therapy techniques be applied to school counseling programs. They propose using reality therapy methods will help school counselors develop positive therapeutic relationships and improve students&#x27; self esteem.

Reality therapy has also been found effective with improving the self concept of elementary school students. Many at risk and alternative schools across the nation have implemented reality therapy techniques and methods to improve school functioning and the learning and social environment. Other areas of application have been used in athletic coaching, childhood obesity, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Ken Klug has looked at different coaching techniques and has found that many successful coaches use some aspects of reality therapy. According to Klug, reality therapy in coaching helps build relationships, a healthy teaching environment and brings a definitive purpose to goal setting. Reality therapy can also be used to prevent or control childhood obesity. It is suggested that applied reality therapy methods may help children evaluate their eating behaviors, set realistic goals and integrate effective self-evaluation. Sheryl Prenzlau, a social worker in Israel, has found empirical evidence to suggest that reality therapy can reduce somatization and rumination behaviors associated with PTSD.

==Criticisms==

The main limitation regarding reality therapy is that it primarily and exclusively deals with the current and the present problems of the individuals. Not looking to unlock trauma or recurring dreams, reality therapy&#x27;s only workable arena is the present and going forward in the best possible way, while remembering the importance of taking responsibility for one&#x27;s own actions and realizing that the only person one can control is oneself. In that realization of personal responsibility, one is given great freedom and happiness. Some people find fault with Glasser&#x27;s notion that people chose the behaviors that afflict them by choosing chronic depressive thought patterns and choosing profound psychosis. Apart from specific brain pathology, Glasser argues that mental illness is a result of unsatisfying present relationships or general unhappiness.

An opposing view to this is, that many other schools of therapy (especially cognitive approaches) focus on the present rather than the past, and that the concept of disconnection (or failure to correctly perceive how motive and inner need/intent are linked), is in some form or other, at the root of dysfunction is also considered not unusual, according to several other accepted schools of therapy, from transpersonal psychology to transactional analysis.

<text>Benno Charles Schmidt Jr. (March 20, 1942 – July 9, 2023) was an American academic and education executive. From 1986 to 1992, he was 20th president of Yale University. Prior, Schmidt was Dean of the Columbia Law School, Harlan Fiske Stone, professor of constitutional law, and chairman of Edison Schools (now EdisonLearning). He lastly served as the chairman of , a for-profit, private K-12 school, and as the chairman of the Board of Trustees of the City University of New York (CUNY) from 2003 to 2016.

A noted scholar of the First Amendment, the history of the United States Supreme Court, and the history of race relations in American law, Schmidt clerked for Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. In 1998, Schmidt was appointed chair of a task force established by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to evaluate systemic issues at CUNY by executive order. After longterm service to CUNY&#x27;s board of trustees, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo replaced Schmidt in June 2016, then-chair, with a new chair, Bill Thompson, after an interim report issued, in an ongoing state investigation, issued by the Office of the New York State Inspector General identified a number of systemic problems, largely attributable to CUNY&#x27;s lack of oversight which led to financial waste and abuse within the CUNY system.

==Early life and career==
Schmidt was born in New York, New York on March 20, 1942. His father, Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., was a longtime friend and associate of John &quot;Jock&quot; Hay Whitney. In 1946, Whitney and the elder Schmidt started what was to become the first venture capital firm in the United States, J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. His mother, Martha (Chastain) Schmidt, was a homemaker, who remarried and took the surname Orgain.

Schmidt Jr. attended St. Bernard&#x27;s School, Phillips Exeter Academy, and Yale University. Upon completion of his undergraduate studies in history, in 1963, Schmidt attended Yale Law School. Following graduation in 1966, he became a law clerk for Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren, and thereafter worked for two years in the U.S. Department of Justice, before joining Columbia Law School as a faculty member. His expertise as a legal scholar included the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, history of race relations in American law, and history of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Schmidt achieved tenure at Columbia in 1973, at age 29, and was named the Harlan Fiske Stone Professor of Constitutional Law in 1982. Schmidt was appointed Dean of the law school in 1984, where he served until 1986, before accepting the offer to be President of Yale University, succeeding A. Bartlett Giamatti, who resigned to become president of baseball&#x27;s National League.

==Yale University==
Schmidt was the president of Yale University from 1986 to 1992. In academics, he instituted several new and successful programs, but his attempt to reduce faculty stirred up controversy. He anticipated the need to repair the university&#x27;s physical infrastructure, which had fallen into disrepair, but widespread renovation was not carried out until the arrival of Schmidt&#x27;s successor Rick Levin. Most impressively, Schmidt raised over a billion dollars for Yale, a faster-growing endowment than at any other university.

Answering faculty reports of poor writing abilities among incoming freshmen, Schmidt convened a committee to review the issues, and after reflecting upon committee&#x27;s recommendations, he made significant changes to the writing programs, such as instituting writing tutors at each of the residential colleges, a program which remains today.

Under Schmidt&#x27;s leadership, Yale established the Ethics, Politics and Economics (EP&amp;E) program, which was modeled on the University of Oxford&#x27;s PP&amp;E program, and a number of interdisciplinary programs, including environmental sciences, molecular biology, and international studies. Schmidt questioned the validity of other academic programs, although his proposal to reduce the faculty by 11 percent was not well received.

Schmidt was criticized for maintaining his primary residence in New York City during his tenure as president of Yale, with his wife Helen Whitney, a documentary filmmaker. Schmidt collaborated with then-Mayor of New Haven, Connecticut John C. Daniels to hammer out a land deal that netted the City of New Haven $2.3 million, in 1990, and millions more in subsequent years.

==Edison Schools==
From 1992 to 1997, Schmidt served as the chief executive officer of Edison Schools, a for-profit venture, later renamed EdisonLearning, a for-profit corporation. The organization operates public schools in several districts He was President of the concern from 1992 to 1997 and Chief Education Officer of it from 1998 to 1999. From 1997 to 2007, Schmidt served as Edison&#x27;s Chairman and later a director on the board.

==City University of New York==
On May 6, 1998, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani appointed Schmidt the chair of a special task force to evaluate longstanding systemic issues at City University of New York, along with committee members Herman Badillo, Heather MacDonald, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research; former New York State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, Jacqueline V. Brady, a vice president of Nomura Securities International, Incorporated; Richard T. Roberts, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development; and Richard Schwartz, president and CEO of &quot;Opportunity America&quot; and special assistant to Mayor Giuliani. A year later, on June 7, 1999, the task force report entitled &quot;An Institution Adrift&quot; characterized the &quot;moribund conditions&quot; of a public University system &quot;caught in a spiral of decline&quot;. Schmidt and his colleagues called for a complete restructuring of the City University of New York system. Specifically, Schmidt advised CUNY to organize into a unified university system, rather than continue under a system of governance in which each of its 17-campuses runs itself as a separate fiefdom. Similarly, in a section on &quot;financial planning,&quot; Schmidt advised the university overhaul the &quot;passivity&quot; of CUNY&#x27;s central Executive Administration. Four years later, New York State Governor George E. Pataki appointed Benno C. Schmidt Jr. to the position of chairman of the City University of New York Board of Trustees. In 2003, Schmidt was reappointed to the position of chair. Prior, Schmidt served CUNY&#x27;s Board in the positions of Vice Chairperson, from 1999 to 2003. In 2006, Governor George Pataki reappointed Schmidt to the position of Chair for another seven-year term. In 2016, financial impropriety by the former City College of New York, and an investigation conducted by the New York State Office of the Inspector General, concluding the City University of New York financial system was &quot;ripe for abuse&quot; due to a lack of proper oversight of decentralized funds, resulting in &quot;financial waste and abuse,&quot; prompting Governor Andrew Cuomo to replace Schmidt with a new chairman, and most of the CUNY Board of Trustees with a new bloc of politically prominent trustees.

===Other professional and civic service===
Schmidt served as Director/Trustee of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation; chairman of board for the Council on Aid to Education - a not-for-profit providing colleges and universities assessment and strategic planning services; the National Humanities Center (NHC), and American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as an advisory board member of the Happy Hearts Fund, a nonprofit focused on rapidly rebuilding schools in disaster-stricken areas.

In 2014, Schmidt delivered a talk at the Yale commencement ceremony, entitled &quot;Governance for a New Era&quot;, or &quot;The Schmidt Report&quot;, and subtitled &quot;A Blueprint for Higher Education Trustees&quot;, in which the former University president harshly criticized passive governance over the nation&#x27;s public and smaller private institutions, which serve the vast majority of American college students. Schmidt issued a challenge to higher education leadership to step up and take responsibility for doing more to increase academic standards and graduation rates.

==Professional recognition==
In 1989 he was appointed Honorary Member of the Order of Australia (AM), for his service to the arts and agricultural development in Australia. In 1991, Schmidt was awarded Honorary Officer status (AO). The inscription reads, &quot;For service to the arts, agricultural development and Australian/American relations.&quot; In November 2010, Schmidt received the sixth annual Philip Merrill Award of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni (ACTA) for outstanding contributions to liberal arts education.

Schmidt made cameo appearances in two Woody Allen films, &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986) and &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992).

==Personal life and death==
Schmidt was married four times, with his first three marriages ending in divorce. He had three children and two stepchildren. He was known as a folk musician. Schmidt died at home in Millbrook, New York, on July 9, 2023, at age 81.

<text>Marand () is a city in the Central District of Marand County, East Azerbaijan province, Iran, serving as capital of both the county and the district.

Marand is among the major cities of East Azerbaijan province. It is in the northwest of the capital of the province, Tabriz. Marand has been known by various names in history, such as Maryana, Mandagarana, and Maranda.

==Etymology==
Moritz von Kotzebue and August von Haxthausen both described local legends that placed the burial spot of Noah&#x27;s wife at Marand. Both authors contended that the name of the city means &quot;the mother lies here,&quot; referring to Noah&#x27;s wife. According to Kotzebue:

==History==
The history of the town goes back to the pre-Islamic era. Between 815 till 850, Marand was primarily controlled by Mohammad ibn Ba&#x27;ith who was Iranicized to a considerable extent. The elders of Maragha who quoted his Persian poetry also praised his bravery and his literary ability. He was Iranicized to considerable extent and the statement of Tabari on him is evidence of the existence of the cultivation of poetry in Persian in northwest Persia at the beginning of the 9th century.

==Demographics==
===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 114,165 in 29,755 households. The following census in 2011 counted 124,323 people in 35,805 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 130,825 people in 40,275 households.

<text>State Highway 35 (SH 35) is a state highway near the southeastern edge of Texas, United States, that is maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). It runs primarily south–north, paralleling the Gulf of Mexico for much of its length, from a junction with Interstate 37 in Corpus Christi to Interstate 45 in southeastern Houston.

==Route description==
The southern terminus of SH 35 is at an interchange with Interstate 37 (I-37) near downtown Corpus Christi, concurrent with U.S. Route 181 (US 181). The two highways run as a freeway near Corpus Christi Bay before crossing Nueces Bay on the Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge and entering Portland. In Gregory, the two routes separate, with US 181 traveling towards Sinton, and the freeway segment of SH 35 ends shortly thereafter. After crossing FM 136, SH 35 runs eastward to Aransas Pass before turning towards the northeast. In Rockport, SH 35 runs as a divided expressway. After passing through Fulton, the highway crosses Copano Bay. SH 35 runs along the western edge of the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge before entering Refugio County. In Calhoun County, SH 35 has a junction with US 87 in Port Lavaca before crossing Lavaca Bay. The route then runs east to Palacios before turning north toward Blessing, where it resumes its northeasterly trajectory toward Bay City and Angleton. From here, SH 35 takes a turn to the north-northwest toward Alvin before heading north through Pearland and crossing the Sam Houston Tollway (Beltway 8) into Houston. SH 35 then crosses I-610 before reaching its northern terminus at I-45.

==History==
SH 35 was originally proposed on November 19, 1917 as a route from Paris to Houston. On September 17, 1918, the section of the road from Liberty to Houston was cancelled (as it overlapped SH 12), and the road was rerouted south to Anahuac. On January 20, 1919, the highway was rerouted through Coldspring, Cleveland, and Humble to end in Houston, while the old route was replaced by the new SH 35A. On August 21, 1923, the northern half of the highway had been renumbered as SH 49, with the new northern end now going east to the Louisiana state line. On November 14, 1927, it was extended to Alvin. On April 10, 1934, it had been extended southwest along cancelled SH 58 and SH 57, ending in Gregory. SH 35 Spur was designated from 35 to the Retrieve Prison Farm. This SH 35 Spur was cancelled on July 15, 1935. On February 21, 1938, a new SH 35 Spur was designated to Danbury, as SH 35 was rerouted to bypass Danbury. On September 26, 1939, the section north of Houston was removed when it was renumbered as U.S. Highway 59 and U.S. Highway 84. SH 35 Spur was renumbered as Spur 28. On October 5, 1972, SH 35 was extended to Corpus Christi along US 181. On January 15, 1986, an Angleton bypass opened, with the old route becoming Loop 558. On February 25, 1987, SH 35 was rerouted back over Loop 558, and the bypass became Loop 558 instead (now FM 523). On April 27, 1995, another bypass opened, so that SH 35 no longer goes through Aransas Pass or Rockport. On March 29, 2007, an Old Ocean bypass opened, with the old route becoming Loop 419 (now Spur 419).

SH 35A was a proposed spur route off SH 35 designated on March 18, 1918, with a route splitting off at Livingston, and travelling west to New Waverly. On January 20, 1919, the section of SH 35A south of Coldspring was cancelled, and the section north of Coldspring became the main route. The section of SH 35 from Livingston via Liberty to Anahuac was routed through Devers and was renamed SH 35A. On August 21, 1923, the section from Anahuac to Devers was renumbered as SH 61, and the section north of Devers was cancelled. By 1928, the Livingston to Liberty section was restored as SH 132. By 1933, that became a portion of SH 146.

SH 35B was a spur of SH 35 designated on November 27, 1922 from Jefferson to the Louisiana state line. On August 21, 1923, this was renumbered as SH 49.

An overlap of SH 35 with the Gulf Freeway was constructed in the 1980s. This portion extends from Spur 5 to Dowling Street (now Emancipation Avenue), a distance of about . This section contains three elevated lanes in each direction (briefly four southbound lanes near the southern terminus). This overlap section is 22 lanes wide, including mainlanes, feeder roads, and a reversible HOV lane.

==Future==

In Houston, SH 35 is Telephone Road and Reveille Street from its northern terminus at I-45. An upgrade of the facility (in a slightly different corridor) to freeway standards is planned, tentatively named the Alvin Freeway. As of 2006, only had been built, under the sign Spur 5 (constructed between 1996–99; officially opened September 1999; designated 1998). However, the mainlanes extend less than half a mile south of Interstate 45 adjacent to the University of Houston campus.

In early 2023, TxDOT unveiled construction bids for the first phase of the project, which will extend Spur 5 from its current southern terminus at US 90 Alt (Old Spanish Trail) to Griggs Road, just north of I-610. Phase 2 of the project will extend the freeway from Griggs Road to Dixie Drive. The estimated cost for the entire project is $366 million.

<doc id="1284002" wikidata="Q1026921" url="?curid=1284002" title="Lee Wing-tat">
<text>Lee Wing-tat (; born 25 December 1955) is a former Member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (LegCo), returned by direct election as representative of the New Territories West constituency. He was the former third Chairman of the Democratic Party (DP). He is seen as a conservative inside the party.

==Early life==
A Hakka, Lee was elected vice-chairman of the Hong Kong University Students&#x27; Union in 1979. He graduated from the Faculty of Science of the University of Hong Kong with a pass. He first participated in politics in the 1980s and was the vice-chairman of the Association for Democracy and People&#x27;s Livelihood (ADPL). He was elected to the District Council and the Regional Council in 1985 and 1986 respectively. He was a founding member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China.

In 1989, during the visit of Geoffrey Howe to Hong Kong, Lee protested at the conference and called Howe&#x27;s speech &quot;bullshit&quot;.

Lee left the ADPL and formed the United Democrats of Hong Kong, which developed into the Democratic Party in 1994. He was elected to the Legco in the same year. He once lost his seat in the 2000 election but was re-elected in 2004. He was vice-chairman of Democratic Party from 2002 to 2004 and was elected chairman at the sixth AGM of the DP in succession to Yeung Sum. His challenger for the Chairman&#x27;s post, Chan King-ming, was elected vice-chairman instead.

==Chairmanship of Democratic Party==

===Chief Executive Election===
In May 2005, Lee declared his intention to run in the Hong Kong Chief Executive Election, but only received 52 nominations and thus failed to get on the ballot. As a result, he withdrew from the election on 15 June. His participation in the election faced great criticisms within the party and the pro-democracy camp.

===Criticisms===
Lee was criticized for suppressing the second-tier members and &quot;Young Turks&quot; of the party. In early 2006, someone alleged to the &quot;Apple Daily&quot; that some senior members were involved in spying activities of China. The &quot;suspects&quot; were all Young Turks and included vice-chairman Chan King Ming and Gary Fan. The Young Turks later held a press conference to criticise the list of &quot;suspects&quot;, with some even directly naming Lee as responsible.

===Departure===
Lee did not seek a second term as party chairman in the party&#x27;s internal elections in December 2006.

==Views, policy positions and Legco voting==
In June 2010, he voted with the party in favour of the government&#x27;s 2012 constitutional reform package, which included the late amendment by the Democratic Party – accepted by the Beijing government – to hold a popular vote for five new District Council functional constituencies.

<doc id="1284012" wikidata="Q7128608" url="?curid=1284012" title="Palomar Mountain">
<text>Palomar Mountain ( ; ) is a mountain ridge in the Peninsular Ranges in northern San Diego County, California. It is known as the location of Palomar Observatory and Hale Telescope, and known for Palomar Mountain State Park.

==History==
The Luiseño name for Palomar Mountain was and High Point was called .

The Spanish name &quot;Palomar&quot;, meaning &quot;pigeon roost&quot; or &quot;place of the pigeons&quot;, comes from the Spanish colonial era in Alta California when Palomar Mountain was known as the home of band-tailed pigeons.

The peak was once called Mount Joseph Smith but reverted to its Spanish name, Palomar, in 1901.

During the 1890s, the population was sufficient to support three public schools, and it was a popular summer resort for Southern California, with three hotels in operation part of the time, and a tent city in Doane Valley each summer.

Nathan Harrison, the first African American homesteader in San Diego area, purchased several acres on the western slope of the mountain in the 1880s and graded a road that became a popular tourist route called Harrison&#x27;s grade. According to an article by Daniel Weiss, &quot;Harrison was briefly married twice, both times to Luiseño Indian women who were part of a community that lived on the mountain,&quot; and he was baptized into the Catholic faith &quot;by a Luiseño chief in Rincon who had converted to Catholicism.&quot; Harrison&#x27;s tall tales of the mountain&#x27;s fauna, including his overcoming of countless grizzlies and aggressive mountain lions, and his blithesome, joking disposition, made him locally famous among the county&#x27;s travelers.
==Palomar Observatory==
Palomar Mountain is most famous as the home of Palomar Observatory which includes the Hale Telescope. The 200-inch telescope was the world&#x27;s largest and most important telescope from 1949 until 1992. The observatory currently has four large telescopes, the most recent one being a 40-in robotic infrared one operational since 2021.

==Palomar Mountain State Park==
Palomar Mountain is the location of Palomar Mountain State Park, a California State Park. There are campgrounds for vacationers, and a campground for local school children until San Diego Unified School District was forced to close it due to state budget cuts. The park averages 70,000 visitors annually. The campgrounds in the park were temporarily closed on October 2, 2011, due to state budget cuts. The park was among 70 California State Parks threatened by budget cuts in fiscal years 2011–2012 and 2012–2013, but the park and the campgrounds remain open.

Palomar Mountain, especially in the state park area, is densely wooded with abundant oak and conifer tree species (pine, cedar, fir). Ferns are abundant everywhere in the shady forest. The forest is supported by annual precipitation totals in excess of 30 inches.

Beginning in the 1920s a fire lookout tower has been present on Boucher Hill on Palomar Mountain. The tower had been active until it was abandoned in 1983 and then was reactivated when the San Diego/Riverside County Chapter of the FFLA Forest Fire Lookout Association - San Diego/Riverside Chapter began manning it in 2012. Boucher Hill sees more than 11,000 visitors a season. The tower opens around May 1 in conjunction with the fire season and closes in early December. During this period the tower is typically staffed 7 days a week from 9am to 5pm.

Doane Valley, located within the State Park, is home to the Camp Palomar Outdoor School for 6th grade students in San Diego Unified School District.

== Oak Knoll Campground ==
At the base of Palomar Mountain on County Route S6 is Oak Knoll Campground, formerly known as Palomar Gardens. In the 1950s and 1960s, Palomar Gardens was made famous by its owner and resident, UFO contactee George Adamski. Adamski had a self-built, wooden observatory at Palomar Gardens and photographed objects in the night sky that he claimed were UFOs. Adamski co-authored the bestselling &quot;Flying Saucers Have Landed&quot; in 1953, about his alleged alien encounter experiences, and in particular his meetings with a friendly &quot;Space Brother&quot; from Venus named Orthon. The 1977 film &quot;The Crater Lake Monster&quot; had many scenes filmed on Palomar Mountain, including scenes shot at the summit restaurant, but not the scenes of the monster in a lake.

== High Point ==

High Point, in the Palomar Mountain range, is one of the highest peaks in San Diego County. At an elevation of , it is surpassed by Cuyamaca Peak (at ) and Hot Springs Mountain (the county&#x27;s highest point, at ). They are dwarfed by the higher San Bernardino Mountains a relatively short 52 miles to the north, in San Bernardino County, the San Jacinto Mountains 30 miles north in Riverside County and the high Mount Whitney some farther north. High Point is located approximately two miles east of the observatory. However, it is not accessible by the public from that direction as the observatory itself and adjacent land are private property, and the road to High Point from the observatory is blocked by a permanently closed gate. It may be reached via Palomar Divide Truck Trail, a dirt road that starts off Highway 79 near Warner Springs, California. The trip is 13 miles one way with 3000 feet of elevation gain via Palomar Divide Truck Trail. High Point can also be hiked on the Oak Grove Trail, the oldest established trail on the Palomar Ranger District. The hike is 13.5 miles roundtrip. There is an operational USFS fire lookout tower on High Point, built in 1964. It is 70 feet tall, making it the tallest USFS fire tower in California. It was brought back into service in 2009 and is staffed by the San Diego/Riverside County Chapter of the FFLA Forest Fire Lookout Association - San Diego/Riverside.

Other local peaks include:
*Birch Hill ()
*Boucher Hill ().

==Access==
South Grade Road, the stretch of San Diego County Route S6 going from State Route 76 to the summit provides access with over 20 hairpin turns over the distance of less than .

==Climate==
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Palomar Mountain has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps. Annual precipitation on the mountain averages 30–35 inches (highly variable from year to year), mostly falling between October and April. Snow falls during cold winter storms. Summers are mostly dry, except for thunderstorms in July to early September. The humid climate supports a forest of oak, pine, fir and cedar on large swaths of the mountain.

The upper elevations of the Palomar Mountain range have notably different habitats than its lower elevation foothills. The lower regions are in the California montane chaparral and woodlands sub-ecoregion, adapted to the xeric/dry Mediterranean climate with chaparral and woodlands flora. The higher regions are in the California mixed evergreen forest sub-ecoregion, with California black oaks, closed-cone pines, firs, and other California oaks and conifers. Higher elevations receive considerably more moisture than the coastal and inland valley lower slopes, with of precipitation. They can also receive snow from winter storms.

<doc id="1284017" wikidata="Q1756307" url="?curid=1284017" title="Mii-dera">
<text>, also known as just Onjo-ji, or , is a Buddhist temple in Japan located at the foot of Mount Hiei, in the city of Ōtsu in Shiga Prefecture. It is a short distance from both Kyoto, and Lake Biwa, Japan&#x27;s largest lake. The head temple of the Jimon sect of Tendai, it is a sister temple to Enryaku-ji, at the top of the mountain, and is one of the four largest temples in Japan. Altogether, there are 40 named buildings in the Mii-dera complex.

Mii-dera is temple 14 in the Saigoku Kannon Pilgrimage.

==History==
===Founding, and feuds===
Onjō-ji was founded in the Nara period. The temple was founded in 672 following a dispute over Imperial succession. Emperor Tenji had died, and his son was killed by Tenji&#x27;s brother, who was then enthroned as Emperor Tenmu. Temmu founded Onjō-ji in honor and memory of his brother.

The name &quot;Mii-dera&quot; (&quot;Temple of Three Wells&quot;) came about nearly two centuries later. It was given this name by Enchin, one of the earliest abbots of the Tendai Sect. The name comes from the springs at the temple which were used for the ritual bathing of newborns, and in honor of Emperors Emperor Tenji and Emperor Tenmu, and Empress Jitō, who contributed to the founding of the temple. Today, the Kondō, or Main Hall, houses a spring of sacred water. Under Enchin&#x27;s guidance, from 859 to his death in 891, Mii-dera gained power and importance, eventually becoming (along with Tōdai-ji, Kōfuku-ji, and Enryaku-ji) one of the four chief temples charged with the spiritual guidance and protection of the capital. It was during this time also that Enryaku-ji and Mii-dera split away from one another, developing two branches of the Tendai sect, called Jimon and Sanmon. For the most part, this was more a geographic rivalry than an ideological schism, but it was an intense one nonetheless, and only grew more severe after Enchin&#x27;s death.

The rivalry turned violent in the second half of the 10th century, over a series of official appointments to other temples, and similar slights. The zasu of Enryaku-ji in 970 formed the first permanent standing army to be recruited by a religious body. Mii-dera can be assumed to have established one very soon afterwards. In 989, a former abbot of Mii-dera by the name of Yokei was to become abbot of Enryaku-ji; but none of the monks of Enryaku-ji would perform services under his direction. He soon resigned. But in 993, the monks of Mii-dera took revenge, destroying a temple where Ennin, founder of Enryaku-ji&#x27;s Sanmon sect, had once lived. The monks from Enryaku-ji retaliated, destroying more than 40 places associated with Enchin. In the end, over 1,000 monks of Enchin&#x27;s Jimon sect fled permanently to Mii-dera, cementing the split between the two Sects. Over the course of the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries, there continued to be similar incidents, over the appointment of abbots (&quot;zasu&quot;), involving many &quot;sōhei&quot;, or warrior monks. Mii-dera was burned to the ground by the &quot;sōhei&quot; of Enryaku-ji four times in the 11th century alone. There were, however, times that the two united against a common enemy, including an attack on the Kōfuku-ji in Nara in 1081 (avenging the burning of the Mii-dera by Kōfuku-ji monks that same year), and a united attack on Nara once more in 1117.

===The Genpei Wars===
At the end of the 12th century, the attentions of the monks of Mount Hiei were turned towards a greater conflict: the Genpei War. The Taira and Minamoto families supported different claimants to the Chrysanthemum Throne, and in June 1180, the Minamoto brought their claimant, Prince Mochihito, to the Mii-dera, fleeing from Taira samurai. Mii-dera asked for aid from Enryaku-ji, but was denied. The monks of the Mii-dera joined the Minamoto army, and fled to the Byōdō-in, a Fujiwara clan villa, which had been converted to a monastery by Mii-dera monks (see Battle of Uji (1180)).

Angered at the Mii-dera/Minamoto alliance, Taira no Kiyomori ordered the destruction of Mii-dera, and of many of the temples of Nara (see Siege of Nara). 

The monks of Mii-dera figured once more in the Genpei War, fighting alongside Taira sympathisers against Minamoto no Yoshinaka, who invaded Kyoto in 1184, setting fire to the Hōjūjidono Palace and kidnapping the retired emperor, Shirakawa II.

Following the Genpei War, there was a long period of relative peace, as the temples of Kyoto and Nara, including the Mii-dera, were rebuilt. As the temples regained strength, rivalries reappeared, though little to no violence actually erupted between Mii-dera and Enryaku-ji. In 1367, when a novice from Mii-dera was killed at a toll barrier established by the temple of Nanzen-ji, warrior monks from Mii-dera set out to attack Nanzen-ji; when the &quot;shōgun&quot;″s forces were sent to quell the rebellion, they discovered Mii-dera&#x27;s monks to be supported by &quot;sōhei&quot; from Enryaku-ji and Kōfuku-ji as well. A year later, another battle erupted, over comments made by the abbot of Nanzen-ji; the monks of Mii-dera, along with their allies, defeated the shogun&#x27;s forces once again.

===Sengoku period and beyond===
In the late 16th century, Mii-dera, along with many of the other nearby temples, sought alliances, for military (defensive) strength, as well as military power. The territories of the Asai and Asakura families were closest to Mount Hiei, but these families, as well as others the temples had allied with, were rivals of Oda Nobunaga. These two families suffered heavy defeats at the hands of Nobunaga and his chief general Toyotomi Hideyoshi, so in 1571 they sought a stronger alliance with the temples. That same year, Nobunaga set to destroying everything on Mount Hiei, starting with the town of Sakamoto at the foot of the mountain, and setting his sights on Enryaku-ji at the summit. Much of Mii-dera was destroyed, as the warrior monks failed against Nobunaga&#x27;s large and highly trained samurai army.

Following these attacks, the monks of Mount Hiei were finally granted a reprieve, and rebuilt their temples once more. Mii-dera has never been attacked or destroyed since then.

==Halls and treasures==
Within the Kondō and Hondo (the Main Hall and Buddha Hall) of Mii-dera, there are at least six statues of the Buddha, sacred personal possessions of various Emperors, including Emperor Tenji, which are hidden away and shown only on rare, special occasions, as well as one large statue of the Miroku, or Maitreya, Buddha in the center of the Hall. The Kondo was built in 1599, and is a replacement for the original, built in 672 and destroyed in 1571.

Mii-dera also has a Kannon-do, built in 1072. 

The evening bell of Mii-dera appears in many tales and legends, including one of the warrior monk Musashibo Benkei and another of a vainglorious woman who dared to touch the forbidden bell. 

==Sub-temples==
===Enman-in===

The is a sub-temple () of Mii-dera. It may have been founded in 987 AD by Prince Goen, the son of Emperor Murakami in Okazaki in Kyoto, where it was called the Byōdō-in, although other records state that it was built with the support of Emperor Go-Suzaku in 1040 under the name of Enman-in. In 1052, the Kanpaku Fujiwara no Yorimichi changed his father&#x27;s villa in Uji into a temple, which became the famous Byōdō-in, and the original Byōdō-in in Okazaki was renamed the &quot;Mii-Byōdō-in&quot; due to its connection with Mii-dera, or the Sakurai-no-miya as recognition that it was a &quot;monzeki&quot; temple with an Imperial prince as head abbot. It was relocated to its present location within the precincts of Miii-dera in the early Edo Period. Its &quot;Shinden-zukuri&quot; style main residence was a gift of Empress Meishō in 1647. It was originally built in 1619 for use by Tokugawa Masako, the daughter of Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada and wife of Emperor Go-Mizunoo. The floor plan consists of a total of 6 rooms in 2 rows from north to south, and there is also a throne used by Emperor Mizunoo in one room in the northwest.The Kano school wall paintings in this structure were designated an Important Cultural Property in 1929; however, the painting in situ are reproductions, with the actual works stored at the Kyoto National Museum for preservation.

The gardens was designated a National Place of Scenic Beauty in 1934. The layout of the garden is attributed to Sōami, who is also responsible by for the rock garden at Ginkaku-ji in Kyoto.

Within the grounds of Enman-in is also the with a collection of Otsu-e votive prints which were popular with travelers on the Tōkaidō and Nakasendō roads in the Edo Period.

===Kōjō-in===
The is a sub-temple () of Mii-dera, built by (1541-1604). The Yamaoka clan was a cadet branch of the Rokkaku clan native to Ōmi Province, and Yamaoka Kagetomo was one of Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s generals. He took the tonsure in 1584, becoming . Following Hideyoshi&#x27;s death, he pledged fealty to Tokugawa Ieyasu and in 1603 became &quot;daimyō&quot; of the 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; Hitachi-Futto Domain in what is now Inashiki, Ibaraki. In 1601, he sponsored the construction of this chapel within Mii-dera.

The Kōjō-in is noteworthy for its , or Guest Hall, which was completed in 1601. This six by seven bay structure with a wood-shingled &quot;irimoya-zukuri&quot; roof has been designated as a National Treasure as a representative example of &quot;Shoin-zukuri&quot; architecture of the late Muromachi period. It is decorated inside with paintings by the Kano school, notably &quot;fusuma&quot; paintings by Kanō Sanraku. These painting were designated an Important Cultural Property in 1976.

The gardens was designated a National Place of Scenic Beauty in 1934. The gardens contain a large pond which extends almost to the edge of the verandah of the &quot;Kyakuden&quot;. The pond contains a central island and a number of monoliths, as a grouping of stones forming a dry waterfall giving a sense of depth. The garden is planted with trees and flowers which reflect the composition of the paintings within the &quot;Kyakuden&quot;.

The Kōjō-in and its gardens are open to the public only by reservation at least a week in advance.

===Zenpō-in===
The was a sub-temple () of Mii-dera, used as a retreat by its highest-ranking prelates. It was located between the Three-story Pagoda and the &quot;Kyōzō&quot; library of Mii-dera, but no structures remain today. The sub-temple was noted for its very large gardens, the , which were commented upon in several Edo Period works on famous gardens in Japan, (including the &quot;Omi Koshiji Sakuden&quot; and &quot;Tsukiyama Niwazoden&quot;) and were designated a National Place of Scenic Beauty in 1934. However, the gardens were destroyed in a landslide following heavy rains in 1941. The original layout diagrams for the gardens were later re-discovered, and archaeological excavations found that the edges of the pond and many of the stones of the garden were preserved in good condition. Reconstruction work commenced in 2017.

<text>The MG 08 (08) is a heavy machine gun (HMG) which served as the standard HMG of the Imperial German Army during World War I. It was an adaptation of Hiram Maxim&#x27;s 1884 Maxim gun design, and was produced in a number of variants during the war. The MG 08 also saw service during World War II in the infantry divisions of the German Army, although by the end of the war it had mostly been relegated to second-rate &quot;fortress&quot; units.

Named after 1908, the year it was adopted by the Imperial German Army, the MG 08 was a development of the license-made 01. The MG 08&#x27;s rate of fire depends on the lock assembly used and averages 500 rounds per minute for the Schloss 08 and 600 rounds per minute for the Schloss 16. Additional telescopic sights were also developed and used in large quantities during World War I to enable the MG 08 to be used in long-range direct fire and indirect fire support roles.

== Development and adoption ==
The German Rifle Commission began firing tests of the Maxim gun at Zorndorf in 1889. In 1892, Ludwig Loewe&#x27;s company signed a seven-year contract with Hiram Maxim for production of the gun in Berlin. The Imperial German Navy ordered Maxim guns from Loewe in 1894. The Navy deployed them on the decks of ships and for use in amphibious warfare. In 1896, Loewe founded a new subsidiary, the (DWM), to handle production. The agreement with Maxim concluded in 1898 and DWM received orders from Austria-Hungary, Argentina, Switzerland and Russia.

The Imperial German Army first considered using the Maxim gun as an artillery weapon The German light infantry troops began trials of the gun in 1898. The Guards Corps, II Corps and XVI Corps made more experiments in 1899. The tests produced a recommendation of independent six-gun detachments to march with the cavalry, with the guns mounted on carriages pulled by horses.

The Army purchased the modified MG 99 and MG 01 versions of the Maxim gun from DWM in limited quantities. The MG 99 introduced the sled mount that would remain standard in the MG 08. The MG 01 added lightweight spoked wheels, making possible the pushing and pulling of the weapon. The MG 01 was also exported to Chile and Bulgaria. By 1903, the German Army had 11 machine-gun detachments serving with cavalry divisions.
Criticisms of the MG 01 stressed its limited mobility and inability to keep up with the cavalry. The DWM and Spandau Arsenal developed the design further, decreasing weight by 7.7 kg, adding a detachable gun shield, an option for an optical sight, and removing the wheels. The result was the MG 08, which went into production at Spandau in 1908.

The German Army observed the effectiveness of the Maxim gun in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, many of them German exports. With the importance of the machine gun apparent, the Army asked for additional funding from the Reichstag to increase the supply of machine guns. After criticism of the request from Socialist deputies, the Army&#x27;s demand for six guns per regiment was reduced to six guns per brigade in 1907. The Army Bill of 1912 finally gave the Army its demanded six guns per regiment. On 3 August 1914, soon after the outbreak of World War I, the Army had 4,411 MG 08s, along with 398 MG 01s, 18 MG 99s and two MG 09s.

At the onset of World War I, Germany developed an aerodynamically refined bullet intended for machine gun use. This full metal jacket s.S. (, &quot;heavy spitzer bullet&quot;) boat tail projectile was loaded in the . The had an extreme range of approximately . From its 1914 introduction the was mainly issued for aerial combat and as of 1918 in the later stages of World War I to infantry machine gunners.

Another early-WWI improvement introduced in 1915 was a muzzle booster, a patent-protected Vickers invention, which was designated 08 S. Thanks to that MG 08 came up to its British and Russian analogs with their Vickers-licensed recoil boosters in its rate of fire (up from about 300-350 to 450–600 rds/min) and reliability.

== Training and use ==
Training was regulated by the Field Service Regulations of 1908, providing the German Army six years to train with the guns before the outbreak of World War I.

==Design details==
The gun used 250-round fabric belts of 7.92×57mm ammunition. It was water-cooled, using a jacket around the barrel that held approximately of water. Using a separate attachment sight with range calculator for indirect fire, the MG 08 could be operated from cover.

The MG 08, like the Maxim gun, operated on the basis of short barrel recoil and a toggle lock. Once cocked and fired the MG 08 would continue firing rounds until the trigger was released or until all available ammunition was expended.

The standard iron sightline consisted of a blade front sight and a tangent rear sight with a V-notch, adjustable from in increments. The 12 (ZF12) was an optional 2.5× power optical sight that featured a range setting wheel graduated or in increments. With the addition of clinometers fixed machine gun squads could set ranges of and deliver plunging fire or indirect fire at more than . This indirect firing method exploits the maximal effective range, that is defined by the maximum range of a small-arms projectile while still maintaining the minimum kinetic energy required to put unprotected personnel out of action, which is generally believed to be 15 kilogram-meters (). Its practical range was estimated at some up to an extreme range of when firing the long-range .

The MG 08 was mounted on a sled mount () that was ferried between locations either on carts or else carried above men&#x27;s shoulders in the manner of a stretcher.

Pre-war production was by (DWM) in Berlin and by the government Spandau arsenal (so the gun was often referred to as the ). When the war began in August 1914, 4,411 MG 08s were available to battlefield units. Production at numerous factories was markedly ramped up during wartime. In 1914, some 200 MG 08s were produced each month, by 1916—once the weapon had established itself as the pre-eminent defensive battlefield weapon—the number had increased to 3,000; and in 1917 to 14,400 per month.

==MG 08/15==
The MG 08/15 was the &quot;rather misguided attempt&quot; at a lightened and thus more portable light machine gun from the standard MG 08, produced by &quot;stepping-down&quot; the upper rear and lower forward corners of the original MG 08&#x27;s rectangular-outline receiver and breech assembly, and reducing the cooling jacket&#x27;s diameter to . It was tested as a prototype in 1915 by a team of weapon designers under the direction of an &quot;Oberst&quot;, Friedrich von Merkatz; this became the MG 08/15.

The MG 08/15 had been designed around the concept of portability, such as the French Chauchat, which meant that the firepower of a machine gun could be taken forward conveniently by assaulting troops, and moved between positions for tactical fire support; as such, the MG 08/15 was to be manned by two trained infantrymen, a shooter and an ammo bearer. In the attack the weapon would be fired on the move (marching fire) while on the defense the team would make use of the bipod from the prone position. To accomplish that, the MG 08/15 had a short bipod rather than a heavy four-legged sled mount, plus a wooden gunstock and a pistol grip. At the MG 08/15 had minimal weight savings over the MG 08, being &quot;a cumbersome beast to use in the assault.&quot; Intended to provide increased mobility of infantry automatic fire, it nevertheless remained a bulky water-cooled weapon that was quite demanding on the crews and never on par with its rivals, the Chauchat and the Lewis Gun. Accurate fire was difficult to achieve and usually in short bursts only. The fabric ammunition belts were prone to stretching and there were cartridge extraction problems when they were wet.

It was first introduced in battle during the French Second Battle of the Aisne (&quot;Chemin des Dames&quot; offensive) in April 1917. Deployment in increasingly large numbers with all front line infantry regiments continued in 1917 and during the German offensives of the spring and summer of 1918.

There were other, less prominent, German machine guns in WWI that showed more promising understanding of tactical firepower; such as the air-cooled 7.92 mm Bergmann MG 15nA which weighed &quot;a more manageable 13kg,&quot; had a bipod mount and was fed from a 200-round metal-link belt contained in an assault drum instead of fabric belts. Despite its qualities, it was overshadowed by the production volumes of the MG 08/15 and exiled to secondary fronts, being largely relegated to use in limited numbers on the Italian Front. The Bergmann MG 15nA was also used by the &quot;Asien-Korps&quot; in Sinai, Mesopotamia and Palestine. Being air-cooled, the Bergmann MG 15nA&#x27;s barrel would overheat after 250 rounds of sustained fire. Other light machine guns would maintain the water-cooling system, such as the Dreyse MG 10 and MG 15; with an air-cooled version produced just before the war, known as the &quot;Dreyse-Muskete&quot; or the MG 15.

Despite such developments, the MG 08/15 remained by far the most common German machine gun deployed in World War I, reaching a full allocation of six guns per company (72 guns per regiment) in 1918. By that time, there were four times as many MG 08/15 light machine guns than heavy MG 08 machine guns in each infantry regiment. To attain this goal, about 130,000 MG 08/15 were manufactured during World War I, most of them by the Spandau and Erfurt government arsenals. The heavy weight remained a problem though and a &quot;futile attempt&quot; to solve this problem was a late-war air-cooled version of the MG 08/15, designated as the &quot;MG 08/18&quot;; but it was only 1 kg lighter than the MG 08/15. The MG 08/18&#x27;s barrel was heavier and it could not be quickly changed; inevitably overheating was a problem. It was battlefield tested in small numbers during the last months of the war. As noted, &quot;the Maxim Gun was not a sound basis for an LMG.&quot;

=== Idiom ===
The designation 08/15 lives on as an idiom in colloquial German, &quot;nullachtfünfzehn&quot; (, pronounced &quot;&quot;), being used as a term to denote something totally ordinary and lacking in originality or specialness.

The name of the weapon (&quot;null-acht-fünfzehn&quot;) originally became a slang term in the German Army in the Second World War. Because of the 08/15&#x27;s tendency to jam, German soldiers used the name of the gun to refer to any thing that went wrong in their Army experiences.

== Aircraft versions ==
===lMG 08===

A lightened air-cooled version of the original water-cooled rectangular pattern-receiver MG 08 infantry automatic ordnance, the lMG 08, was developed by the Spandau arsenal as a rigidly mounted aircraft machine gun and went into production in 1915, in single-gun mounts, for use on the E.I through the E.III production versions of the Fokker Eindecker. A lower case letter &quot;L&quot; beginning the prefix meant &quot;luftgekühlt&quot; (air-cooled) rather than &quot;Luft&quot; (air).

The lMG 08s were later used in pairs by the time of the introduction of the Fokker D.III and Albatros D.I biplane fighters in 1916, as fixed and synchronized cowling guns firing through the propeller. The Parabellum MG14 built by DWM was a lighter (22 lbs) and quite different, air-cooled Maxim system gun with a very high rate of fire (600-700 rounds/min). It was introduced in 1915, and was, but not without serious problems on occasion (as noted by Otto Parschau), prototyped on Parschau&#x27;s own A.16/15 Fokker A.III &quot;green machine&quot; monoplane with the Fokker &quot;Stangensteuerung&quot; gun synchronizer, received back with the synchronized Parabellum by Parschau on May 30, 1915 and first used in quantity as the synchronized forward-firing armament on the five examples of the Fokker M.5K/MG &quot;Eindecker&quot; production prototype aircraft, and soon afterwards served as a flexible aircraft observer&#x27;s gun for rear defense.

The initial model of the air-cooled &quot;Spandau&quot; lMG 08 front-firing cowling machine guns had lost the stocks, grips, and bipods of the infantry MG 08s to adapt it to a fixed, forward-firing mount forward of an aircraft&#x27;s cockpit, with gun synchronization allowing safe firing through a spinning propeller&#x27;s arc. The 105 mm diameter cylindrical sheet metal water jacket used for the infantry&#x27;s MG 08, an important support member for the barrel, was initially over-lightened with cooling slots, with fourteen rows of such slots completely surrounding and running the whole length of the jacket&#x27;s circumferential sheetmetal.

These alternated between seven rows of nine &quot;oblong&quot; slots, alternating with seven more intervening rows of eight slots and twin round holes fore and aft of the slots apiece. Because of the important physical reinforcement provided by the cooling jacket on the MG 08 series of guns, the excessive slotting of the initial model of the air-cooled lMG 08 — amounting to slightly over 50% of the total area of the cylindrical cooling jacket&#x27;s original circumferential sheetmetal — rendered the gun as too fragile, to the point of making it impossible to fit the muzzle booster that the water-cooled infantry MG 08 guns could be fitted with.

The later models of lMG 08 air-cooled machine gun variously &quot;tweaked&quot; the amount of slotting of the barrel by reducing the amount of sheet metal removed from it in minor ways through at least two or three trial formats, and eventually in the final versions produced, had the slotting omitted at the extreme ends of the cooling jacket&#x27;s cylindrical member, with a 13 cm wide area of solid sheet metal at the breech end, and a 5 cm wide solid area at the muzzle end, giving the resultant gun much more rigidity. The lMG 08 also retained unchanged the rectangular rear receiver and breech assembly of the water-cooled MG 08 infantry weapon.

===LMG 08/15===
Later, the MG 08&#x27;s receiver would be lightened by being &quot;stepped down&quot; at its upper-rear and lower-forward corners as the more refined and lighter weight LMG 08/15 version was developed, using the same airframe mounting geometry as the earlier ordnance to allow interchangeability between the earlier lMG 08 and later LMG 08/15 models, with the still well-perforated cooling jacket reduced to a 92.5 mm diameter. The LMG 08/15 was introduced in 1917.

The lMG 08 and LMG 08/15 guns were always used on fixed-wing aircraft, as fixed forward-aimed synchronized firing ordnance initially in single mounts for Germany&#x27;s 1915-16 era Fokker Eindecker and Halberstadt D.II &quot;scout&quot; single-seat fighters, and by 1916 in dual mounts, first appearing on the mass-produced examples of Robert Thelen&#x27;s Albatros D.I and D.II fighters in late 1916, and singly on German &quot;C-class&quot; armed two-seat observation aircraft for synchronized forward-firing armament. The usual ammunition load for fighters was for longer, 500 round, belts, one for each gun.

A device, occasionally fitted to the rear surface of the later LMG 08/15&#x27;s receiver backplate, told the pilot how much ammunition was left to fire. Later on a significant upgrade to the gun&#x27;s aerial usability was the fitting of the Klingstrom device on the right side of the receiver, which allowed the gun to be cocked and loaded with one hand from the cockpit. Various cocking/charging handle styles evolved with a simplified distinctive long handled cocking/charging device finally becoming preferred late in the war.

LMG 08/15&#x27;s used the 30mm &quot;two hole&quot; ammunition belts of the flexible Parabellum MG14 machine gun rather than the wider &quot;three hole&quot; belts of the MG 08/15 water-cooled infantry weapon. It is possible that these belts were used as they were a bit lighter and less bulky than the wider &quot;three hole&quot; ground gun belts and certainly made for standardization which would have been easier for the armorers and in addition allowed for smaller and lighter &quot;tubes&quot; or &quot;chutes&quot; that guided the empty belts into storage containers in the aircraft after firing.

It is a common misconception that the tubes or chutes coming out of the fixed mounted aviation LMG 08/15 fixed guns were for expended cartridge cases. In actuality these attachments were for guiding the empty cartridge belts into a container inside the fuselage of the aircraft so that the belts would not interfere with the operation of the aircraft. As the entire MG 08 &quot;Spandau&quot; family of German machine guns ejected their empty cartridge cases forward through a round hole in the receiver&#x27;s lower forward surface, immediately under the aft end of the barrel&#x27;s cylindrical cooling-jacket (as can be clearly seen on many videos), these cartridge cases were guided out of the aircraft (except on Martin Kreutzer-designed Fokker biplane fighter aircraft, and the Fokker fighters designed by Kreutzer&#x27;s successor Reinhold Platz) through tubes from under the barrel to the bottom of the fuselage. With Fokker designed aircraft following the Eindecker, the cartridge cases were ejected without tubes from the receiver hole directly into open trays that guided the tumbling cartridge cases backward and sideways onto the sloped fuselage decking, which then streamed down past the cockpit on either side. These trays are clearly visible in photographs but have rarely been recognized for their purpose.

Hermann Göring, who flew both the Fokker Dr.I and Fokker D.VII was so annoyed with the case tumbling out in front of him that he had deflectors made on his aircraft to ensure the empty cartridge cases did not find their way into his cockpit. On photographs of Göring&#x27;s aircraft these plates, seen only on his aircraft, are very prevalent and have even been recognized in scale models of his aircraft copying his particular planes, but even then most historians have failed to recognize their purpose. Both empty belt guides and trays were attached directly to the machine guns rather than to the aircraft. In the famous film showing Australian officers handling the LMG 08/15s from Baron von Richthofen&#x27;s crashed triplane, the Fokker type belt tubes/chutes and empty cartridge trays can be clearly seen still attached to the guns.

More than 23,000 examples of the LMG 08/15 and an unknown number of the lMG 08 were produced during World War I.

== Anti-tank and anti-aircraft variant ==
A variant chambered in the same 13.2 x 92 mm SR round as the Mauser Anti-Tank Rifle was introduced in 1918. Designated MG 18 TuF (), it was issued in limited numbers in late World War I.

== Chinese version ==

Based on the commercial MG09, in 1935, the Chinese began to produce the derivative Type 24 Heavy machine gun, which was not based solely on German drawings and introduced several improvements and new features.

The Type 24 Heavy machine gun, first introduced to the National Revolutionary Army in 1935, designed to replace the original MG 08. It was the standard heavy machine gun for all Nationalists, Communists, and Warlords from 1935. They were usually made in the Hanyang Arsenal. Like the original MG 08, because of transportation difficulties, the M1917 Browning machine gun and other machine guns slowly replaced the Type 24 for the NRA after the Chinese Civil War. The PM M1910, and the SG-43 Goryunov (or Type 53/57 Machine gun) slowly replaced the Type 24 Heavy machine gun after the Chinese Civil War, but it was kept in service with the PLA, KPA and the NVA until the 1960s during the Vietnam War.

The Type 24 heavy machine gun&#x27;s tripod resembles the tripod of the MG 08. This gun is not able to be mounted on sledge mounts. When aiming at enemy infantry, it usually comes with a muzzle disk. When used as an anti-aircraft gun, it uses a metal pole to make the tripod higher and usually does not come with a muzzle disk. The gun&#x27;s receiver is similar to the MG 08&#x27;s gun body. Like the original MG 08, it needs a crew of four.

The Type 24 heavy machine gun is chambered with the 7.92×57mm Mauser round, the standard Chinese military rifle cartridge of Nationalist China.

After the Chinese Civil War, People&#x27;s Republic of China militia and reserve units converted a number of Type 24 HMG into the 7.62×54mmR Russian cartridge. They were used for training or as filming prop, and never entered service.

==Career==

Graves was born in Salina, Kansas, to parents who owned a trucking firm. After graduating from Kansas Wesleyan University with a business degree, he worked in human resources. In 1986, he was elected Kansas Secretary of State and in 1991, he was appointed as a representative of state governments to the Competitiveness Policy Council.

Following his tenure as governor, he became president of the American Trucking Associations.

<doc id="1284081" wikidata="Q5528808" url="?curid=1284081" title="Gayle McKeachnie">
<text>Gayle F. McKeachnie (born January 26, 1943) is a Utah Republican politician and was the fifth lieutenant governor of Utah from 2003 until 2005.

==Education==
McKeachnie received his B.A. from the College of Southern Utah and his J.D. from the University of Utah. For a time, McKeachnie was an adjunct professor at Brigham Young University&#x27;s J. Reuben Clark Law School.

==Public office==
McKeachnie was elected to four terms in the Utah State House of Representatives. From 1985 to 1986 he served as the majority whip for the Republican Party. After his service in the state legislature, McKeachnie served as the chairman of the board of trustees for Utah State University.

It was while serving as a university trustee that McKeachnie became Utah&#x27;s fifth Lieutenant Governor. In October, 2003, Utah Governor Michael O. Leavitt resigned his office, having been appointed to a position in the Bush Administration. Leavitt was succeeded by his lieutenant governor, Olene S. Walker, and to fill the vacancy that she had left in the office of Lieutenant Governor, Walker appointed McKeachnie.

The Walker–McKeachnie administration was short-lived, however. In May 2004, at the Utah State Republican Convention, Walker failed to win her party&#x27;s nomination to seek a full term, and in January 2005, both she and her lieutenant governor left office.

==Today==
Today, McKeachnie continues to be involved in Utah politics and policies. He is prominent in Utah as an expert on rural issues, including gas and oil-field discoveries. His expertise in both rural and energy issues makes him a highly sought-after advisor. McKeachnie served in the Huntsman administration as the leader of Rural Affairs and continues to do so in the Herbert administration. McKeachnie is also a close confidante of his successor as Lieutenant Governor, Gary Herbert, who served as Governor from 2009 to 2021.

McKeachnie also currently serves as a member of the Board overseeing the School and Institutional Trust Lands Association.

<text>Charles Edgar Duryea (December 15, 1861 – September 28, 1938) was an American engineer. He was the engineer of the first working American gasoline-powered car and co-founder of Duryea Motor Wagon Company. He was born near Canton, Illinois, a son of George Washington Duryea and Louisa Melvina Turner, and died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but spent most of his life working in Springfield, Massachusetts. It was in Springfield that Charles and his brother, Frank, produced and road-tested America’s first gasoline-powered car.

== Biography ==
Charles Duryea was born on December 15, 1861, near Canton, Illinois, to George Washington Duryea and Louisa Melvina Turner.

Duryea and his brother Frank (1869–1967) were initially bicycle makers in Washington, D.C., but later became world-renowned as the first American gasoline-powered car manufacturers, headquartered in Springfield, Massachusetts. Their design was inspired by a Benz gasoline-powered car that Charles saw at a fair in Ohio. Generally speaking, Charles engineered the automobiles, while Frank built, tested and raced them.

=== Tests of the first American gasoline-powered automobile ===
On September 21, 1893, the Duryea brothers road-tested the first-ever, working American gasoline-powered automobile on the Howard Bemis farm in Chicopee, Massachusetts. The Duryea&#x27;s &quot;motor wagon&quot; was a used horse drawn buggy that the brothers had purchased for $70 and into which they had installed a 4 HP, single cylinder gasoline engine. The car (buggy) had a friction transmission, spray carburetor and low tension ignition. Frank Duryea test drove it again on November 10 — this time in a prominent location: past their garage at 47 Taylor Street in Springfield. The next day it was reported by &quot;The Republican&quot; newspaper with great fanfare.

This particular car was put into storage in 1894 and stayed there until 1920, when it was rescued by a former Duryea engineer Inglis M. Uppercu and presented to the United States National Museum.

=== The Duryea Motor Wagon Company ===
On November 28, 1895, in Chicago, their vehicle, driven by brother Frank, had won America&#x27;s first car race. It ran to Evanston, Illinois and back. The only other finisher was one of three Benz cars mostly made in Germany. After Frank won, demand grew for the Duryea Motor Wagon. In 1896, the Duryea Brothers produced 13 cars by hand – in their garage at 47 Taylor Street – and thus Duryea became the first-ever commercially produced vehicle, and also the largest automobile factory in the United States. For the history of the company and its cars, see Duryea Motor Wagon Company.

Duryea sought out investors and buyers while his brother, Frank Duryea, primarily handled the mechanical side of the business.

A Duryea car was involved in America&#x27;s first known auto accident. New York City motorist Henry Wells hit a bicyclist with his new Duryea. The rider suffered a broken leg, Wells spent a night in jail and the nation&#x27;s first traffic accident was recorded in March 1896. In 1913, George Vanderbilt purchased and drove a Stevens-Duryea, but was one of few people in the United States who could afford one. His 1913 Duryea is Vanderbilt&#x27;s only original car kept at his Biltmore Estate.

Duryea ceased manufacturing in 1917.

Duryea died of a heart attack in Philadelphia on September 28, 1938, and was buried in Ivy Hill Cemetery, West Oak Lane.

==Legacy==
Duryea was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1973.

The annual Duryea Hillclimb is named in his honor.

The Charles Duryea Residence (located in Peoria&#x27;s historic West Bluff district) was named a City of Peoria Historical Landmark in July 2015; automobiles were manufactured in a barn on the property, which is no longer standing. An automobile built in Duryea&#x27;s barn in 1898 is on permanent display at the Peoria Riverfront Museum.

<doc id="1284105" wikidata="Q787812" url="?curid=1284105" title="Baba O'Riley">
<text>&quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; is a song by English rock band the Who, written by guitarist and principal songwriter Pete Townshend. It is the opening track to the Who&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; (1971). In Europe, it was released as a single in October 1971, coupled with &quot;My Wife&quot;. Performances of &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; appear on several Who live albums.

Widely regarded as one of the Who&#x27;s finest songs and as one of the greatest rock songs of all time, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; appears in &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;All-Time 100 Songs&quot; list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll.

==Background and composition==
Townshend wrote &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; for his &quot;Lifehouse&quot; project, a rock opera intended as the followup to the Who&#x27;s 1969 opera &quot;Tommy&quot;. In &quot;Lifehouse&quot;, a Scottish farmer named Ray would have sung the song at the beginning as he gathered his wife Sally and his two children to begin their move to London. When &quot;Lifehouse&quot; was scrapped, eight of the songs were salvaged and recorded for the Who&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot; (1971), with &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; as the lead-off track. The song title refers to two of Townshend&#x27;s primary inspirations at the time: Indian spiritual master Meher Baba and American minimalist composer Terry Riley.

According to Townshend, at the end of the band&#x27;s gig at the 1969 Isle of Wight Festival, the field was covered in rubbish left by fans, which inspired the line &quot;teenage wasteland&quot;. In another interview, Townshend said the song was also inspired by &quot;the absolute desolation of teenagers at Woodstock, where audience members were strung out on acid and 20 people had brain damage. The irony was that some listeners considered the song a teenage celebration: &#x27;Teenage Wasteland, yes! We&#x27;re all wasted!

==Recording==

The repeating set of notes (ostinato) in &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; that opens and underlies the song was derived from the &quot;Lifehouse&quot; concept, where Townshend wanted to input the vital signs and personality of Meher Baba into a synthesiser, which would then generate music based on that data. When this idea fell through, Townshend instead recorded a Lowrey Berkshire Deluxe TBO-1 organ using its marimba repeat feature to generate them. This modal approach was inspired by the work of minimalist composer Terry Riley.

The song was derived from a nine-minute demo, which the band reconstructed. &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; was initially 30 minutes in length, but was edited down to the &quot;high points&quot; of the track for &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;. The other parts of the song appeared on the third disc of Townshend&#x27;s &quot;Lifehouse Chronicles&quot; as &quot;Baba M1 (O&#x27;Riley 1st Movement 1971)&quot; and &quot;Baba M2 (2nd Movement Part 1 1971)&quot;. Dave Arbus, whose band East of Eden was recording in the same studio, was invited by Keith Moon to play the violin solo during the outro. In most live performances, this part is played instead by Daltrey on harmonica.

== Release ==
&quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; was released in November 1971 as a single in several European countries. However, in the United Kingdom and the United States, it was released only as part of the album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;. The song became one of the band&#x27;s most popular songs, as well as a popular staple of AOR radio, and remains on the classic rock radio canon.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; appears at No. 159 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. The song is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. The band Pearl Jam regularly plays a cover of the song during concerts, and a readers&#x27; poll in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded this cover as #8 in their &quot;Greatest Live Cover Songs&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Paste&quot; ranked the song number two on their list of the 20 greatest Who songs, and in 2022, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song number six on their list of the 50 greatest Who songs.
==Legacy==
&quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; was used as the theme song for the television series &quot;&quot; (2004–2013), with each &quot;CSI&quot; series using a Who song as its theme. The song was also used in the &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; episode &quot;Pictures of You&quot; (season 4, episode 13). The live version of the song from the album &quot;Who&#x27;s Last&quot; (1984) plays in the opening segment of the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;Out Where the Buses Don&#x27;t Run&quot; (season two, 1985). One of the working titles of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (1998–2006) was &quot;Teenage Wasteland&quot;, a reference to the repeated lyric in the song. The song was also used in the trailers for the films &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot; (1998), &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999), &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot; (2012), &quot;Jobs&quot; (2013), &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot; (2015), &quot;Free Guy&quot; (2021) and season 3 of &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. The song was also sung in the first season &quot;Sense8&quot; episode &quot;W. W. N. Double D?&quot; by Riley&#x27;s father at the airport.

&quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; was included in the soundtrack for the 1997 film &quot;Prefontaine&quot; and the 1999 film &quot;Summer of Sam&quot;. The song was used in the 10th episode of the 2010 Fox show &quot;The Good Guys&quot;. The song was featured in the 2004 romantic comedy film &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot;, and was also used in the beginning and end credits of the 2012 movie &quot;Premium Rush&quot;. The song has also been used in episode 14 of season one in the TV series &quot;House&quot; and in episode 10 of season one in the TV series &quot;The Newsroom&quot;. It was also used in episode one of the UK version of &quot;Life on Mars&quot;. A remixed version of this song, re-done by Alan Wilkis, appears in the 2012 remake of &quot;Need for Speed: Most Wanted&quot;, as well as the &quot;Family Guy&quot; season 13 episode &quot;Quagmire&#x27;s Mom&quot;, the third &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars&quot; special and episode 11 of season one of &quot;Superstore&quot;. The song is featured in an episode of &quot;Joe Pera Talks with You&quot;.

In October 2001, the Who gave a much-lauded performance of the song at the Concert for New York City. Since 2003, &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; has been played during player introductions for the Los Angeles Lakers during home games at the Staples Center. The song is played before live UFC events during a highlight package showing some of the most famous fights in the mixed martial arts company&#x27;s history. The song was used for the trailer of the &quot;EA Sports UFC 4&quot; game. It is also the official theme song of competitive eater Joey Chestnut.

At both the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics, the 120 BPM dance track &quot;The Road Goes on Forever&quot; by the Welsh electronic music producer High Contrast, which samples &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, is used during the countdown at the start of the proceedings. &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; was then performed by the Who as their first number during the last musical segment at the closing ceremony, with Roger Daltrey singing a changed lyric of &quot;Don&#x27;t cry/Just raise your eye/There&#x27;s more than teenage wasteland&quot;. &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; is also used as the pregame music at Sanford Stadium and is played right before kickoff at every University of Georgia home football game. In addition, the Boston College Marching Band has featured a rendition of the song at football and hockey games. It is also played at halftime of most New England Patriots home games, leading up to the second-half kickoff. It is also the entrance music for the New York Rangers at Madison Square Garden for every Rangers home playoff game.

In the course of a debate on Twitter, it was noted that &quot;Best Song Ever&quot; (2013) by One Direction bore a strong resemblance to the basic structure of &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;. Pete Townshend responded to the claims by denying that the Who were pursuing legal action, and stated that he was a fan of One Direction&#x27;s single and was happy that One Direction appeared to have been influenced by the Who, just as he had been influenced by earlier musicians such as Eddie Cochran.

<text>Dragon Dice is a collectible dice game originally made by TSR, Inc., and is produced today by SFR, Inc. It is one of only a handful of collectible dice games produced in the early 1990s. The races and monsters in &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; were created by Lester Smith and include some creatures unique to a fantasy setting and others familiar to the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game.

The game simulates combat between armies of fantasy races for control of a young world named Esfah. &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; classifies magical power by element: air, earth, fire, water, and death. Nearly every race in the game is composed of two of these elements. In the original edition, dragons and dragon-related dice (Dragonkin) were all composed of a single element each. However, SFR has since released &quot;hybrid&quot; dragons representing each two-element combination, in addition to white and ivory dragons (where ivory represents no elemental affinity and white represents affinity with all elements).

&quot;Dragon Dice&quot; was one of the last original games produced by TSR, and an unexpectedly high return of unsold units contributed to the financial crisis that resulted in the sale of TSR to Wizards of the Coast.

==Premise==
&quot;Dragon Dice&quot; is set in the fictional world of &quot;Esfah.&quot; Esfah was created by the goddess Nature, and the Father of All. These two deities had several children, each of whom represented one of the major elements described by Plato (Fire - Firiel, Earth - Eldurim, Wind - Ailuril, Water - Aguarehl), and one of whom was named &quot;Death.&quot; After Nature&#x27;s children created two races, the Coral Elves (Selumari) and Dwarves (Vagha), Death created its own set of races, the Goblins (Trogs) and Lava Elves (Morehl), bent on causing mischief and discord. Nature and her children became enveloped in a continuing war with Death, each causing the birth of several new races, including the Amazons, Firewalkers, Undead, Feral, Swampstalkers, Frostwings, Scalders, and Treefolk. Players, acting as army Commanders, assemble race units and compete against each other in a battle on selected terrain. Commanders may summon Dragons, representing the cardinal elements, which attack each other and all other creatures. Legendary units, Dragonhunter and Dragonmaster leaders of The Eldarim, each holding the power of one of Esfah&#x27;s elements, grew within the ebb and flow of the war.

Players then use their dice to represent either the forces of Good or Evil in this setting. For example, you could be anyone from the Coral Elf Commander, leading your army on a path to destroy Death races, driven by that which stole your peaceful existence and attacked Mother Nature, to the Treefolk General, leading a harmonious balanced life in Water and Earth. Or, maybe you just want to light stuff on Fire raging in tumultuous Air tides.
==Goal==
The goal of a standard game of &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; is to capture two of any of the terrains being fought over. This is achieved by one player&#x27;s armies controlling two terrains that have their terrain die turned to the eighth face, as explained below. The game can also be won if a player has the last surviving in play. Any number of players can share in this struggle.

==Types of dice==

===Units===
Any six-sided die or ten-sided die (see Monsters, below) that belongs to a race is a &quot;unit&quot;. The color(s) of the dice identify each race and represent the elements that comprise each. The dice come in four sizes, each corresponding to a particular amount of &quot;health&quot; from 1 to 4 points. One side on each unit die has an ID icon, which identifies the unit and generates results equal to the health of the die towards whatever action is being rolled for. The remaining sides have either normal action icons (representing magic, maneuvers, melee, missiles, or saves) or special action icons (SAI) that generate special effects or results. Generally, the more health a unit has, the more icons it will have. Units are also divided by class as well as size, reflecting their specialty. Most races have five classes of unit, plus monsters (or champions for the Eldarim), but while most races share a number of classes (Cavalry, Magic, Melee), some are unique to certain races (Light Magic, Light Melee, Light Missile).

&quot;MONSTERS&quot; are ten-sided dice that are units and have a single icon on each face which generate 4 points of effect (i.e.: 4 results) with the possible exception of some SAI effects. Monsters are part of a player&#x27;s army and each one counts as four points of health.

Players build armies of units to a predetermined amount of health. The standard game is 36 points of health, but smaller and even larger games are not uncommon.

There are other six-sided dice that are mono-colored called Dragonkin that are not considered units. There are other ten-sided dice that are mono-colored called artifacts that are a type of magic item. Both are part of the Advanced Rules.

===Terrains===
&quot;TERRAINS&quot; are eight-sided and have two colors that indicate what elements comprise the terrain. For example, a Swampland terrain is green and gold, showing it is made of earth and water. Each face of a terrain die is numbered and has an icon for missile, melee, or magic. The number and the icon shown indicate how far apart armies at that terrain are. If a Magic icon (starburst) is showing, then the armies are so far apart they can only cast spells. A Missile face (arrow) means they are close enough to shoot at each other, and a Melee icon (sword) means they are close enough for hand-to-hand combat to take place. Each player brings two terrains to the game, one Home terrain and one proposed Frontier terrain. Some races gain benefits such as extra maneuvers or saves if they are at a certain terrain. The goal of the game is to control two such terrains by &quot;turning&quot; them to the 8th face. An army capturing an 8th face also gains double maneuvers and double saves. The eighth face of terrains has one of four special icons: City, Temple, Tower and Standing Stones. Each gives an additional bonus to the army that possesses them.

&quot;EXAMPLES: An army with a Temple is immune to the effects of Death (black) magic and can &quot;bury&quot; dead units to render them unusable for magic. A City allows for the recruiting or promoting of units, a Tower allows for a Missile action to any other terrain, and Standing Stones allow that army to cast magic of that terrain&#x27;s color, even if the army is not made up of those colors.&quot;

SFR released the &quot;Battlefields&quot; expansion in August 2010, featuring two new terrains: Feylands (green/red) and Wastelands (blue/red). Four new 8th face icons were also introduced that can only be used at the Frontier location: Dragon Lair, Grove, Castle, and Vortex. Minor terrains (smaller eight-sided dice) were re-released as part of this expansion.

===Dragons===
&quot;DRAGONS&quot; are twelve-sided and of a single (or two mixed) . Each face has the image of a dragon part that will show what action the dragon takes when rolled against an army. Dragons must be summoned to a terrain through the use of magic. Players do not control dragons they summon, so bringing one into play can be risky since the possibility exists that it may attack the very player that summoned it. One dragon is brought to the game for every 24 health of units in play. Thus, in a 48 health game players would bring two dragons. SFR has released ten 2-colored HYBRID DRAGONS, 5 Ivory/color hybrid dragons, and a white dragon in both wyrm and drake forms. With the advent of these hybrid dragons, the total number of dragons is 44; 5 each of elemental wyrms and drakes, 10 each of hybrid wyrms and drakes, one each of ivory wyrm and drake, and one each of white wyrm and drake.

===Expansions Introduced by SFR===
2009: &quot;Acolytes of the Eldarim&quot;: This fully expanded race now includes 1-health commons, 2-health uncommons, and 3-health rares, along with new racial abilities and spells. Like the DragonHunters and DragonMasters, these dice are monochromatic, and available in black, blue, gold, green, or red. (Upon closer inspection, the dice themselves are a combination of ivory and the main color, which distinguishes them from Dragonkin.)

2009: &quot;Dragonkin Expansion&quot; re-releases the Dragonkin, which are 6-sided one-color units that can be summoned to a terrain and fight with the army there. Dragonkin come in 1-health commons, 2-health uncommons, 3-health rares, and 4-health Dragonkin Champions. Dragonkin will not fight against a dragon of the same color. For every full three points of other units a player brings to a game, he is allowed (but not required), to bring one point of dragonkin. Dragonkin are part of the Advanced Rules and start in the Summoning Pool.

2010: &quot;Battlefields&quot; includes two new basic terrain types, the Feylands (Fire and Water) and the Wastelands (Fire and Air). The terrains printed in white ink have the same four 8th Face types (City, Standing Stones, Temple, Tower) and are a part of the basic game. Also released as a part of this expansion are minor terrain versions of these new terrains (as well as Coastlands, Flatlands, Highlands, Swamplands). These minor terrains represent lesser objectives that may give your army a needed boost if you&#x27;re willing to take a risk. Minor terrains are part of the Advanced Rules.

The Battlefields expansion also contains special terrains printed in gold ink with new 8th Faces: the Dragon&#x27;s Lair, Grove, Castle, and Vortex. These special gold-printed terrains can only be placed at the Frontier. They can never be home terrains, so there will only be a maximum of one special terrain in play during a game. Otherwise, special terrains act just like normal terrains, except that their icon progression is set by the eighth face icon, not by their elemental colors.

2011: &quot;DragonCrusader and DragonZealots&quot; are Eldarim Champions (along with DragonLords / DragonMasters and DragonSlayers/DragonHunters) and have the ability to control dragons. Each DragonCrusader or DragonZealot that rolls its SFR logo allows the acting player to control one dragon. The dragon may be held motionless (i.e.: it is not rolled) and the army can attack it normally. Or the dragon may be made part of the attack against other dragons.

==The Races==
Each of the races of Dragon Dice has unique icons representing the basic action types - for instance Missile is a bow for Coral Elves, a slingshot for Goblins, and a flintlock pistol for Lava Elves. Each race also has access to different special icons on their rare or monster units. Beginning with Firewalkers, each later race also had unique spells using their magic color that only they could cast.

* Coral Elves (blue and green) are peaceable sea-dwelling elves who travel in flying &quot;coral ships&quot;.
* Dwarves (red and gold) are stalwart warriors with horned helmets, two-headed axes and shields.
* Goblins (gold and black) are disgusting, ravenous creatures who ride wolves or leopards and cast curses.
* Lava Elves (red and black) are fierce death-mages who wield pistols and rapiers.
* Amazons (ivory with purple icons), the game&#x27;s only humans, cast magic based on the terrain they are stationed at. (Per Chuck Pint, President of SFR, Amazons are WHITE units, NOT IVORY) (Per the rulebook, &quot;Amazons are ivory, which signifies that they are not inherently any specific aspect...&quot;)
* Firewalkers (blue and red) are warriors from the sun who flew to Esfah to join its battles for sport.
* Undead (black and ivory with green icons), the reanimated dead, can use only death magic.
* Ferals (gold and blue) are various races of humanoid beasts or birds who fight with stone knives.
* Swamp Stalkers (green and black) are hideous snake-people who mutate other races into themselves.
* Frostwings (black and blue) are furry flying creatures with an affinity for ice. (As the last TSR-published &quot;kicker&quot; pack, Frostwings were underprinted and have become atypically rare.)
* Scalders (red and green), the only &quot;kicker&quot; produced by Wizards of the Coast before the game&#x27;s production ceased, are twisted, malicious faeries and can harm those who attack them.
* Treefolk (gold and green) were printed by SFR after they acquired the abandoned licence. As they use the last unique combination of the game&#x27;s five colors, additional multi-colour races are unlikely.
* Eldarim are the original race of Esfah, and are represented by single colour promo dice called Champions, worth four health each. In 2009, SFR released a new expansion called &quot;Acolytes of Eldarim,&quot; single colour units of one to three health who have given up their racial heritage to learn from the Eldarim Champions. This &quot;kicker&quot; includes a new class of unit, the Shield Bearer.

==Gameplay==
Before the start of the game, units are divided into three separate armies, Home, Horde and Campaign. Each starting army must have at least one die, but no more than half the total health of the entire army (but this restriction only applies to the starting set-up and no longer applies after the game begins). The Home army defends a player&#x27;s Home terrain, the Horde army is placed at an opponent&#x27;s Home terrain, and the Campaign army is placed at the Frontier. Before the start of the game, players roll their Horde armies, and the player with the most maneuver points may choose the Frontier terrain, or to go first.

On a player&#x27;s turn, one is allowed two marches, or actions, with their armies. What action they may take depends on what icon is showing on the terrain face. However, a single army may not take two marches in the same turn.

&quot;EXAMPLE: A player has pulled all of their units into a single army at one terrain. On their turn they get only one march with that army.&quot;

===Maneuver===
Before taking an action with their army, a player may choose to attempt to move the terrain face up or down. They announce this, and if unopposed, change the terrain. If an opponent at the same terrain wishes to oppose the move, then both players roll their army, counting maneuver and ID icons for the total number of points rolled. If the acting player&#x27;s total is equal to or exceeds the opposing player&#x27;s total, then they win and may turn the terrain die one face up or down.

&quot;EXAMPLE: The terrain is a Coastland at 5, a missile face, and the player has a mostly melee army. By rolling to maneuver, and generating more maneuver and ID icons than any declared opponents, the acting player may turn it to 6, a melee face, which allows them to skirmish or charge their opponent.&quot;

===Magic===
If the terrain face is a Magic icon, a player may attempt to cast magic and roll their army, counting magic icons and IDs. Those dice on which an ID is rolled may double their magic total if they match at least one color of the terrain. After tallying points, the acting player may cast spells to help their own armies or hinder an opponent&#x27;s. Spells are assorted by color, and have varying effects such as inflicting damage, adding protection, or even summoning a dragon.

===Missile===
While at a terrain with a Missile face, the acting player can choose to shoot at an army at the same terrain or at the frontier. The army is rolled and all missile and ID icons are counted for the total number of hits. The targeted army is rolled for saves, and if enough saves are not generated, units are removed from the army and sent to the Dead Unit Area (DUA). The targeted player does not get to roll a return shot.

&quot;EXAMPLE: the acting player rolls 5 missile icons and 2 IDs for 7 hits. The targeted player rolls only 4 saves, so would send a total of 3 health of units to the DUA.&quot;

===Melee===
At a terrain with a melee (sword) icon showing, the acting player can choose to engage their opponent in a skirmish. The army is rolled, and all melee and ID icons are counted for the total number of hits on the targeted army. That army is then rolled for saves (like in a missile attack), and if enough saves are not rolled, the appropriate number of units are sent to the DUA. The targeted army then rolls for a counter-attack against the acting player&#x27;s army, who must then save against the attack or send units to the DUA as well.

&quot;EXAMPLE: The acting player declares a skirmish and rolls his army. He rolls 4 melee hits and an ID icon on a two health unit, for a total of six melee hits. The opposing army rolls for saves and generates four saves. That army would immediately lose two health worth of units. After choosing what to remove, the opposing army now reciprocates by rolling for melee hits, and the original acting army makes a save roll.&quot;

In the earliest editions of the game, the acting player may choose to engage in a charge attack. In a charge, the attacking army is rolled and all melee, maneuver, and ID icons are counted as hits (icons such as trample, which count as either maneuver or melee, in this context will count for both and are therefore worth double). The defending army is rolled at the same time, with saves tallied to block opposing hits and melee hits tallied to inflict damage on the attacking army, which cannot roll saves of its own.

&quot;EXAMPLE: The acting player declares a charge and rolls his army. She rolls 5 melee hits, 2 maneuvers, and 3 trample icons. Simultaneously, the defender rolls 6 saves, 3 melee hits, and 3 trample. The acting player tallies 5 melee + 2 maneuver + 6 trample (3 melee PLUS 3 maneuver, as the trample counts for both) for a total of 13 hits. The defender saves against 6 of these hits, taking 7 damage, AND hits back against the charging army for 6 damage (3 melee hits + 3 trample - the maneuver aspect of trample does not count as hits for non-charging armies). Ultimately, the acting army will remove 6 health of units to the DUA, and the defending army will remove 7.&quot;

In the revised editions of the game, charge and skirmish options disappeared in favor of rules clarity and for the sake of cohesive game play. In the modern version of the game, Melee actions follow the above mentioned &quot;skirmish&quot; rule and &quot;charging&quot; disappeared in favor of advanced racial abilities.

===Reinforce and reserves===
When a player has taken both marches, they may withdraw any number of units from terrains into the Reserves area. These units may then be sent to any terrain at the end of the player&#x27;s next turn during the Reinforcement phase, but before others are withdrawn into the Reserves. Units in the Reserves may take a march, but they may not maneuver a terrain and are limited to attempting friendly magic (they cannot target an opposing army or affect a terrain). The one exception to this is Amazons, which may take a missile action to their Home terrain or the Frontier while in reserves.

===Special Action Icons===
Some units and monsters have SAIs (Special Action Icons). For example, a CANTRIP icon allows for up to 4 points of magic during any action other than maneuvers that can be used immediately. A BULLSEYE icon rolled during a missile action targets an individual unit that must for saves before the targeted army does. The SMITE icon inflicts up to 4 hits on a target army, who cannot save against them and must remove that many health from the army before rolling for saves.

===Winning the game===
A player wins by maneuvering two terrains to the 8th face, or through attrition by removing all of an opponent&#x27;s pieces from the game.

==Publication history==
In 1993, Wizards of the Coast started a revolution in the games industry with the release of the first collectible card game (CCG), &quot;&quot;. TSR quickly entered the CCG market in 1994 with &quot;Spellfire&quot;. The following year, TSR released the collectible dice game &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; as a part of TSR&#x27;s 20th anniversary. Game historian Shannon Appelcline noted in his 2014 book &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot; that &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; (1995) was at the time &quot;a more innovative approach to the collectible industry&quot; compared to collectible card games such as &quot;Spellfire&quot; with its collectible dice, each having unique faces that provided different powers.

The first sets of &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; sold well at games stores, and TSR produced several expansion sets, ultimately creating a total of eight races and several promotional dice for the game. However, interest in &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; was waning. Appelcline related that by 1996, TSR was struggling financially and the company increased its involvement in the book trade in an attempt to pay off loans and handle its debt, which included &quot;sending massive reorders of &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; into book stores and increasing hardcover publication from two books a year to twelve. Both of these expansions flopped and because bookstore sales are ultimately returnable, TSR was the one left holding the bag. As 1996 ended Random House informed TSR that they would be returning about a third of TSR&#x27;s products – several million dollars&#x27; worth.&quot; TSR ended up with trailer-truckloads full of &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; being stored in their warehouse. These financial issues quickly led to TSR being bought by Wizards of the Coast (WotC) in 1997.

Shortly after the purchase, WotC released a &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; &quot;kicker&quot; for a ninth race. This would be WotC&#x27;s only addition to the &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; game.

In 2000, on the verge of disposing of a large number of unsold dice into landfill, WotC sold the rights to the game to SFR, Inc. By 2020, SFR had produced five more races — bringing the total to 14 — and completed several sets of promotional dice.

===&quot;Dragon Dice&quot; fiction===
Two short works of fiction accompanied gaming accessories, &quot;Tome of the Tarvanehl&quot; and &quot;Heart of Stone and Flame&quot;. The Dice Commander&#x27;s Manual also included short snippets of fiction as flavor text.

Several full-length paperback novels were written to promote the game: 
* In 1996, TSR published &quot;Cast of Fate&quot; by Allen Varney, a 310-page book that contained a new ivory Dragonslayer die in a hole cut through the pages of the book in the bottom right corner with all text arranged to accommodate the hole.
* TSR planned to publish &quot;Army of the Dead&quot; by Edo Van Belkom in 1997. It was also supposed to contain a unique die. With the sale of TSR to WotC and WotC&#x27;s lack of interest in &quot;Dragon Dice&quot;, publication was shelved indefinitely. WotC eventually returned the rights to Van Belkom at his request, and the book was published in 2003 without a special die by Prime Books.
* A third novel, &quot;Time of the Champions&quot; by Ed Stark, was advertised by TSR before its demise but was never published. 
* &quot;Chill Wind&quot; by Joseph Joiner was released in 2011, but Joiner passed away prior to releasing a sequel.
* In 2020, SFR partnered with TreeShaker Books to revitalize the literary universe. Cast of Fate was revised and rereleased; this new edition included &quot;Tome of the Tarvanehl&quot; and &quot;Heart of Stone and Flame&quot;. It also included Thunderfist and the Dragon which is a prequel to &quot;Chill Wind&quot; and which utilized flavor text written by Joseph Joiner that had been inserted in the version 3 rules booklet and which was expanded upon by Christopher D. Schmitz to complete the novella.
* In 2020, Treeshaker Books released Rise and Fall of the Obsidian Grotto, and Ashes of Ailushurai, both by Christopher D. Schmitz.
* In 2021, Treeshaker Books released Rise of the Champions by Christopher D. Schmitz and re-released Army of the Dead with Schmitz having revised Van Belkom&#x27;s original edition and adding roughly 30% new content; Thunderfist and the Dragon was released as a free digital download, and Chill Wind&#x27;s sequel was released. &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; was a cowritten novel by Christopher D. Schmitz and Sherif Guirgas. &quot;Tales of the First Age&quot; was also released in 2021, which collected the TreeShaker Books editions of Rise and Fall of the Obsidian Grotto, Army of the Dead, and Cast of Fate.
* In 2022 &quot;Secrets of the Shadowlands&quot; by Christopher D. Schmitz was released; also released was the second omnibus, &quot;The Cyrean Songs&quot; which collected Chill Wind, Eye of the Storm, and Secrets of the Shadowlands. It also included Thunderfist and the Dragon as a bonus.

===Videogame===
A computerized version, &quot;Dragon Dice&quot;, was published in 1997 by Interplay.

==Reception==
&quot;Arcane&quot; published reviews of several editions of &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; over several issues. In Issue 1, Steve Faragher rated the original game an excellent 9 out of 10, saying, &quot; this really is a superb game. The strategies available are virtually limitless and, in common with other great games, it&#x27;s hard to imagine two conflicts ever being the same.&quot; In Issue 5, Faragher rated the &quot;Monsters &amp; Amazons&quot; expansion set a disappointing 6 out of 10, commenting, &quot;&quot;So, interesting new dice but frankly not enough of them.&quot; In Issue 7, Chris Baylis rated the &quot;Firewalkers&quot; expansion set an above-average 8 out of 10, calling them &quot;much better balanced, in terms of dice variation as well as distribution, than the &quot;Amazons&quot;, particularly for a single-colour army.&quot; In Issue 11, Baylis rated the &quot;Dragon Dice Battle Box&quot; an average 7 out of 10, calling it well designed, but noting &quot;The only problems are the random assortment of dice - a fixed selection would have made things more playable - and the fact that the full rules refer to a couple of things that aren&#x27;t actually in the box, which can be annoying.&quot;

==Awards==
At the 1996 Origins Awards, &quot;Dragon Dice&quot; won for &quot;Best Fantasy or Science-Fiction Board Game of 1995.&quot;

<doc id="1284112" wikidata="Q175913" url="?curid=1284112" title="Kristina Söderbaum">
<text>Beata Margareta Kristina Söderbaum (5 September 1912 – 12 February 2001) was a Swedish-born German film actress, producer, and photographer. She performed in Nazi-era films made by a German state-controlled production company.

==Early life==

Söderbaum was born in Stockholm, Sweden; her father, Professor Henrik Gustaf Söderbaum (1862–1933), was the permanent secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

After both her parents died shortly after one another, Söderbaum moved to Berlin and enrolled in a theatre school.

==Career==

===Nazi era===

Beginning in 1935, Söderbaum starred in a number of films with director Veit Harlan, whom she married in 1939.
Harlan and Söderbaum made ten films together for the then state-controlled film production company UFA until 1945.

According to film historian Antje Ascheid, Söderbaum is frequently identified as &quot;most singularly representative of the Nazi ideal, as the quintessential Nazi star&quot;. As a beautiful Swedish blonde, Söderbaum had the baby-doll looks that epitomized the model Aryan woman. In fact, she had already played the role of the innocent Aryan in a number of feature films and was well known to German audiences. Her youth and beauty made her a symbol of health and purity and thus an exemplary specimen of the Nazi ideal of womanhood.

In a number of her films, she had been imperiled by the threat of &quot;rassenschande&quot; (&quot;racial pollution&quot;). Two such roles were Dorothea Sturm, the doomed heroine of the antisemitic historical melodrama &quot;Jud Süß&quot;, who commits suicide by drowning after being raped by the villain, and Anna in &quot;Die goldene Stadt&quot;, a Sudeten German whose desire for the city (in defiance of blood and soil) and whose seduction by a Czech result in her drowning suicide. As a result of her watery fate in these two films, as well as a similar end in her debut in Harlan&#x27;s 1938 film &quot;Jugend&quot;, she was given the mock honorary title &quot;Reichswasserleiche&quot; (&quot;Drowned Corpse of the Reich&quot;).

Other roles included Elske in &quot;The Journey to Tilsit&quot;, the wholesome German wife whose husband betrays her with a Polish woman, but finally returns, repentant; Elisabeth in &quot;Immensee&quot;, who marries a rich landowner to forget her unrequited love, and in the end decides to remain faithful even after she is widowed and her lover returns; Aels in &quot;Opfergang&quot;, a woman who dies after her love affair; Luise Treskow in &quot;The Great King&quot;, a miller&#x27;s daughter who encourages Frederick the Great; and Maria in &quot;Kolberg&quot;, a peasant girl who loyally supports the resistance to Napoleon and is the only survivor of her family.

===Postwar===

In the first few years after the war, Söderbaum was often heckled off the stage and even had rotten vegetables thrown at her. In subsequent years, she frequently expressed regret for her roles in anti-Semitic films.

After her husband was again permitted to direct films, Söderbaum played leading roles in a number of his films. These included &quot;Blue Hour&quot; (1952), &quot;The Prisoner of the Maharaja&quot; (1953), &quot;Betrayal of Germany&quot; (1954), and &quot;I Will Carry You on My Hands&quot; (1958). Their last joint project was a 1963 theater production of August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;A Dream Play&quot; in Aachen.

After Harlan&#x27;s death in 1964, Söderbaum became a noted fashion photographer. In 1974, she took a role in Hans-Jürgen Syberberg&#x27;s film &quot;Karl May&quot;. In 1983, she published her memoirs under the title &quot;Nichts bleibt immer so&quot; (&quot;Nothing Stays That Way Forever&quot;). In her later years, Söderbaum faded into obscurity but still took roles in three movies and the television series &quot;The Bergdoktor&quot;. Her last film was with Hugh Grant in the thriller &quot;Night Train to Venice&quot; in 1994. She died in 2001 in a nursing home in Hitzacker, Lower Saxony, Germany.

<text>Carol Molnau (born September 17, 1949) is an American politician who served as the 46th lieutenant governor of Minnesota, from 2003 to 2011. As of 2025, she is the most recent Republican to have been elected Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota.

Born in Carver County, Minnesota, she was elected as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1992 and served five terms. Molnau announced she would not run for re-election after she sold her farm to developers and would no longer be living in the area she had represented. She joined the Pawlenty ticket shortly thereafter, and was elected lieutenant governor in 2002 and re-elected in 2006.

She served as head of the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) in the Pawlenty administration, where she opposed state funding of the mass transit systems of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area.

==Confirmation as Mn/DOT commissioner==
The Minnesota Senate Transportation Committee voted in March 2004 to remove Molnau from her position as commissioner of Mn/DOT with some lawmakers citing that she lacked vision for the transportation needs of the state. The full senate later voted to confirm her. In Summer 2005, rumors began circulating that Governor Tim Pawlenty would drop Molnau from his ticket when he sought re-election in 2006, mainly because of their differences over state funding for the planned Northstar Commuter Rail linking St. Cloud and the Twin Cities. Pawlenty denied those rumors on August 1, 2005 and Molnau remained on the ticket, winning reelection on November 7, 2006. Then, in January 2007, as part of a renewed threat to remove her, Senator Steve Murphy opined that under Molnau the state&#x27;s transportation infrastructure was &quot;crumbling.&quot;

==State Highway 62==
In 2006, Molnau requested bids for a major highway reconstruction of Minnesota State Highway 62 and Interstate Highway 35W. Molnau&#x27;s office required applicants to pay all construction projects as they did the work, with the state reimbursing the contractor over the course of the project. As a result, no contractors submitted bids and the project was shelved until new funding streams could be developed a year later.

==I-35W bridge collapse==
In 2007 the I-35W Mississippi River bridge collapsed in Minneapolis. Molnau was unable to immediately assist in her capacity as Commissioner of Transportation because she was in China at the time. Molnau responded to complaints over her absence by stating she was presenting a paper on transportation. Subsequently some state legislators blamed her for her role as transportation commissioner for failing to advocate for robust funding of the state&#x27;s transportation infrastructure, while Governor Pawlenty continued to support her. Molnau was a controversial transportation commissioner; while she does not have a college degree and said she did not read bridge inspection reports, she frequently promoted herself as a transportation expert while refusing to ask for funding to fix hundreds of problem bridges in Minnesota. She defended her leadership, citing that three members of her leadership team were engineers. The bridge that collapsed was one of those problem bridges that inspectors found to be structurally deficient. The required repairs were not made before the tragedy. A plan to strengthen the fatiguing steel trusses under the bridge was scrapped, some claim in part due to the $2 million cost of those repairs, although Mn/DOT engineers &quot;scoffed&quot; at the suggestion that this was a major factor in the decision. From 2003 through August 2007, Mn/DOT had reduced its staff of 4,500 by 600. Her critics claim that her focus was on new roads—not maintenance of existing ones. In September 2007 the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that Molnau&#x27;s Director of Emergency Response was attending a class at Harvard on Emergency Response. The Director did not return when the bridge collapsed, and proceeded to spend several days in Washington, DC before returning to Minnesota over a week later. The Director was terminated after the outcome of an investigation by the State&#x27;s Legislative Auditor and the Department of Transportation.

== Removal as transportation commissioner ==
After the Interstate 35W bridge collapse some lawmakers publicly questioned her dual role as lieutenant governor and transportation commissioner. However, Molnau defended her roles, citing her predecessor, Mae Schunk, who was active in education throughout the state.

Fallout from the I-35W bridge collapse was evident in a January 2008 Minnesota Public Radio/Humphrey Institute poll, with only one in four Minnesotans approving of the job she was doing as Mn/DOT commissioner. State Senator Steve Murphy responded by saying that the Minnesota Senate would remove her if she does not step down from her post as Mn/DOT chief.

On February 28, 2008, Molnau was removed from her position as transportation commissioner by the State Senate by a party-line, 44–22 vote. Pawlenty considered her ouster a disappointing partisan move while legislators saw failures of leadership and management.

=== Molnau&#x27;s farm sale ===
In addition to the criticism following the I-35W bridge collapse, Molnau was also criticized for the sale of her family&#x27;s farm in 2000 near a highway improvement project she helped put on a fast track. Then-state Rep. Carol Molnau and her husband Steve Molnau sold a parcel of land for 3.3 million dollars near the Highway 212 project she had backed passed through the House of Representatives. Although the official sale date was May 23, 2000, 8 days after then-governor Jesse Ventura signed the Highway 212 project bill, Molnau stated that the sale had been in negotiations for several months. Additionally, a Carver County clerk stated that the sale date as recorded reflected the actual date of the sale, not the day of the real estate closing or the filing date.

<text>Robert Eugene Ladouceur (born July 3, 1954) is a retired American football coach. He began coaching the De La Salle High Spartans in Concord, California in 1979 when he was 25 years old. He took over a program that never had a winning season since the school&#x27;s establishment in 1965. His first season as head coach resulted in their first winning season. His second season resulted in their first appearance in the California Prep Football State Rankings and began De La Salle&#x27;s evolution into a perennial champion. From 1992 to 2004, he guided the team to 12 consecutive undefeated seasons, setting a national winning streak record for high school football of 151 consecutive wins—a record in US amateur sports exceeded only by the 159-game winning streak of Passaic High School in men&#x27;s basketball and the 459 match win streak of Brandon High School in men&#x27;s wrestling. Ladouceur was enshrined to the National High School Hall of Fame in 2001. His team topped the USA Today rankings five times and he is a three-time coach of the year. He retired on January 4, 2013 with a career record of 399–25–3. His .934 winning percentage is a record among coaches with 200 or more wins. Ladouceur is the all-time winningest coach in California high school football and has led the De La Salle program to numerous championships.
A film about his life called &quot;When the Game Stands Tall&quot; was released on August 22, 2014. The film, which stars Jim Caviezel as Coach Bob Ladouceur, Laura Dern as Bev Ladouceur, Michael Chiklis as assistant coach Terry Eidson, and Alexander Ludwig as running back Chris Ryan, is about the record-setting 151-game 1992–2003 high school football winning streak by De La Salle High School of Concord, California. The film is an adaptation of the 2003 book of the same name by Neil Hayes and published by North Atlantic Books. Bob married Lissa Ladouceur on January 3, 2015. De La Salle head coach Bob Ladouceur retired in January 2013 after winning his last Open Division state championship in December 2012.

<text>Joanne E. Benson (born January 4, 1943) is an American politician and educator who served as the 44th lieutenant governor of Minnesota from January 3, 1995, to January 4, 1999. A Republican, she was elected as Arne Carlson&#x27;s running mate. From 1991 to 1995, Benson served as a member of the Minnesota Senate.

== Early life and education ==
Benson was born in Le Sueur, Minnesota. She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in elementary education from St. Cloud State University.

==Career==

Benson was a member of the Minnesota Senate from 1991 to 1995. She became lieutenant governor when she and Arne Carlson won the 1994 Minnesota gubernatorial election in a landslide.

Benson later ran in the 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election in the Republican primary for governor, starting off as the front-runner. Despite her attempt to amass enough support within the GOP establishment to ward off any primary challengers, a late entrant to the race, St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, garnered enough delegates to win the Republican endorsement at the state convention. Placing third in the race for delegates behind Coleman and Allen Quist, Benson agreed not to challenge Coleman in the primary. He won the nomination but lost the general election to the Reform Party nominee, Jesse Ventura.

Upon leaving office in 1999, Benson became the first chief education officer of the Minnesota Business Academy. In that capacity, she worked with civic and state leaders to raise money for the school. Benson was a member of the Governor’s State Capitol 2005 Commission, a group of prominent Minnesota citizens who were tasked with advising then-Governor Tim Pawlenty on the 2005 centennial celebration of the Minnesota State Capitol.

== Personal life ==
Benson is married to Robert R. Benson. She has two children, six grandchildren, and three great grandchildren

<text>Mae A. Schunk (née Gasparac; born May 21, 1934) is an American politician and educator from Minnesota who served as the 45th lieutenant governor of Minnesota from 1999 to 2003. Elected on the same ticket as Jesse Ventura in the historic upset election of 1998 Minnesota gubernatorial election, she became the first Reform Party member elected as lieutenant governor of any state.

==Biography==
Prior to her tenure as lieutenant governor, she was a teacher for 37 years. In his memoir, Ventura mentioned that he chose her to &quot;balance out all the testosterone.&quot; During her term in office, she visited schools throughout the state and frequently read to students as part of her efforts to encourage literacy and appreciation for reading among young people.

In the 2000 presidential campaign, as polls showed Texas Governor George W. Bush and U.S. Vice President Al Gore tied in Minnesota within 2 weeks of Election Day, Schunk endorsed Gore at a rally held on Nicollet Avenue in downtown Minneapolis while Ventura committed himself to a third-party candidate, John Hagelin. Later, in an interview with CNN, Ventura commented that Schunk had asked him before making the endorsement and that he had consented to her decision.

Born to Croatian parents, Schunk lived with her husband, William Schunk (now deceased) in Inver Grove Heights, Minnesota; they have a son, Benjamin Schunk. Schunk was educated at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.

<text>Elliot Goblet is a comedy character created by the Australian comedian Jack Levi. The character is known for the deadpan delivery of one-line jokes. The style compares with the American comedian Steven Wright but developed independently. At first Goblet appeared with round glasses and a goatee beard, but the beard was later removed.

Created with assistance from Australian comedy teacher Pete Crofts, the Goblet character was launched onto the comedy scene with numerous TV performances on &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, &quot;The Midday Show&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;The Footy Show&quot;, &quot;Neighbours&quot; and other Australian TV variety and sketch shows.

<text>State Route 113 (SR 113) is a north–south state highway in the U.S. state of California that runs from around in the Sacramento Valley west of Rio Vista at State Route 12 to State Route 99 in Tudor. It serves as one of two important connecting routes between Interstate 80 and Interstate 5, bypassing Sacramento to the east; the other being Interstate 505 to the west. Past the southern terminus are Collinsville and Birds Landing around the Suisun Bay marshes. Cities along the route include Dixon, Davis, and Woodland. It also shares a stretch of Interstate 80 between just outside UC Davis and Dixon. The section running from Dixon to Woodland is a controlled-access freeway; the remainder is a standard road of two to four lanes. The freeway section spanning from the I-80 interchange in Davis to Woodland is called the Vic Fazio Highway, after the former U.S. House representative of the Davis area, who is credited with obtaining the funding for the freeway upgrade of that section.

==Route description==


State Route 113 begins at the intersection with State Route 12 between Fairfield and Rio Vista. It heads north on a rural two-lane highway towards the city of Dixon. After heading through the center of the city, it expands to four lanes before reaching Interstate 80. From there, SR 113 is co-routed along I-80, heading northeast towards the city of Davis. SR 113 then splits from I-80 onto its own freeway alignment, heading north near UC Davis. It is the four-lane freeway (known as the &quot;Vic Fazio Highway&quot;) connecting Interstate 80 in Davis to Interstate 5 in Woodland, thus rivaling Interstate 505 farther west. After leaving Davis, SR 113 continues north through rural areas for a short while, entering Woodland approximately later. Upon reaching I-5, it is co-routed for a short while and splits from I-5 a mile (1.6 km) later. From there, SR 113 leaves Woodland and again heads north on a rural two-lane highway, turning east and north again into the small community of Knights Landing, intersecting with State Route 45. It then heads northeast through the small community of Robbins, then turns east to end at State Route 99 towards Yuba City.

SR 113 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and south of the northern city limits of Woodland is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==

The four-lane freeway known as the Vic Fazio Highway connecting I-80 in Davis to I-5 in Woodland was completed in 1990.

<doc id="1284135" wikidata="Q7160511" url="?curid=1284135" title="Peg Lautenschlager">
<text>Peggy Ann Lautenschlager (November 22, 1955 – March 31, 2018) was an American attorney and Democratic politician who was the first chair of the Wisconsin Ethics Commission from 2016 to 2017, the 42nd Attorney General of Wisconsin from 2003 to 2007, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin from 1993 to 2001, a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly for the 52nd district from 1989 to 1993, and the Winnebago County District Attorney from 1985 to 1989. Lautenschlager was the first woman to serve as Attorney General of Wisconsin.

Lautenschlager&#x27;s son, Josh Kaul, is the current Wisconsin Attorney General. He was elected in the 2018 general election and re-elected in 2022.

==Early life and education==
Lautenschlager was born in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, to Milton Adam &quot;Fritz&quot; Lautenschlager (1926–2012), a sports coach, and Patsy Ruth &quot;Pat&quot; (née Oleson). She graduated from Goodrich High School (now Fond du Lac High School) in 1973 as valedictorian of her class. Lautenschlager was a Phi Beta Kappa and summa cum laude graduate of Lake Forest College, in 1977, majoring in history and mathematics. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin Law School in June 1980.

==Legal and political career==
After graduation from law school, Lautenschlager was an attorney in private practice in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, specializing in family and domestic abuse law. She served as a member of the adjunct faculties of the University of Wisconsin Law School, the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh, and Ripon College, and served as interim circuit court commissioner of Winnebago County.

Lautenschlager was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Wisconsin State Senate in November 1984, because she didn&#x27;t pursue charges against Manitowoc Sheriffs office, losing the race to incumbent Scott McCallum. Shortly after her defeat, she was appointed by Gov. Tony Earl to serve as district attorney for Winnebago County, becoming the first woman to hold the office. She served as district attorney from July 1985 to December 1988. Lautenschlager simultaneously served on the Wisconsin State Elections Board, the Governor&#x27;s Council on Domestic Abuse, the Democratic National Committee, and the Oshkosh Rape Crisis Center.

Lautenschlager was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1988, unseating a 32-year Republican incumbent. She served from 1989 to 1993 representing the Fond du Lac area. She chaired the Assembly Select Committee on Drug Enforcement, Education, and Treatment and Subcommittee on Corrections Systems Concerns. She also served on the Committees on Criminal Justice, Elections and Constitutional Law, Environmental Resources, Utilities and Mining, Natural Resources, Judiciary, and Education. She served as Vice-chair of Legislative Counsel Committees on Drug Enforcement and Review of Sexual Assault Laws. She decided not to seek re-election in 1992, and instead campaigned for the congressional seat held by incumbent U.S. Rep. Tom Petri. She narrowly lost in what was an unexpectedly close race.

===U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin===
In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed Lautenschlager the United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin, a position for which she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate and held until April 2001. In that capacity, she was the chief federal law enforcement officer for the state&#x27;s westernmost 44 counties. In 1996, Lautenschlager was appointed by Janet Reno to serve on the 15-member Attorney General&#x27;s Advisory Committee. She was the first Wisconsinite ever selected to serve on the committee.

===Attorney General of Wisconsin===
She was elected in 2002 as a Democrat to the office of Attorney General, succeeding Jim Doyle who successfully ran for governor. Her campaign raised more money than any previous Democratic campaign for that office. She defeated Vince Biskupic, the Republican candidate, 52% to 48%, despite being outspent by about $200,000. During this period she was a practicing lawyer and a part-time politics professor at Ripon College, in addition to serving as Chair of the Wisconsin Ethics Commission.

===Drunk-driving conviction and other controversy===
In February 2004, Lautenschlager pleaded guilty to drunk driving in Dodge County, about an hour away from Madison. The police report stated that she refused a blood test. Lautenschlager said that she had fallen asleep at the wheel, and had consumed only two glasses of wine earlier that evening. Lautenschlager reimbursed some of the costs and paid a fine of $784. Her driver&#x27;s license was also revoked for a year.
Also in 2004, a state Ethics Board investigated Lautenschlager&#x27;s use of her state car, ruling that her personal use of it exceeded state-allowed limits but finding &quot;no corrupt motive or intention to obtain a dishonest advantage&quot;.

===Re-election campaign===
In 2006, Lautenschlager faced a Democratic primary challenge from Dane County executive Kathleen Falk, a 2002 candidate for Governor and former Assistant Attorney General. Lautenschlager lost the Democratic nomination to Falk. Falk later lost the general election to former Western District of Wisconsin U.S. Attorney J. B. Van Hollen. Lautenschlager became the first incumbent Wisconsin Attorney General to lose a primary in 58 years.

==Death==
First diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004, Lautenschlager died on March 31, 2018, at her home in Fond du Lac, aged 62.

<text>Wireless wide area network (WWAN), is a form of wireless network. 
The larger size of a wide area network compared to a local area network requires differences in technology.
Wireless networks of different sizes deliver data in the form of telephone calls, web pages, and video streaming.

A WWAN often differs from wireless local area network (WLAN) by using mobile telecommunication cellular network technologies such as 2G, 3G, 4G LTE, and 5G to transfer data. It is sometimes referred as Mobile Broadband. These technologies are offered regionally, nationwide, or even globally and are provided by a wireless service provider. WWAN connectivity allows a user with a laptop and a WWAN card to surf the web, check email, or connect to a virtual private network (VPN) from anywhere within the regional boundaries of cellular service. Various computers can have integrated WWAN capabilities.

A WWAN may also be a closed network that covers a large geographic area. For example, a mesh network or MANET with nodes on buildings, towers, trucks, and planes could also be considered a WWAN.

A WWAN may also be a low-power, low-bit-rate wireless WAN, (LPWAN), intended to carry small packets of information between things, often in the form of battery operated sensors.

Since radio communications systems do not provide a physically secure connection path, WWANs typically incorporate encryption and authentication methods to make them more secure. Some of the early GSM encryption techniques were flawed, and security experts have issued warnings that cellular communication, including WWAN, is no longer secure. UMTS (3G) encryption was developed later and has yet to be broken.

<doc id="1284166" wikidata="Q1157716" url="?curid=1284166" title="Daiwa Securities Group">
<text>is a Japanese investment bank that is the second largest securities brokerage after Nomura Securities.

Major subsidiaries include &quot;Daiwa Securities&quot;, which offers retail services such as online trading to individual investors and investment banking services in Japan, as well as &quot;Daiwa Capital Markets&quot;, the firm&#x27;s international investment banking arm (with a presence across Asia, Europe and North America) that provides M&amp;A advisory, sales and trading services in a variety of financial products to corporate and institutional clients. Other group companies provide asset management, research and private equity fund services.

The company is the fourth largest shareholder in SL Green Realty.

==History==

===Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets===
The company was founded in 1999 as Daiwa Securities SB Capital Markets Co. Ltd., a joint venture between Daiwa Securities Group (Daiwa) and Sumitomo Bank (SB). It was renamed in 2001 to Daiwa Securities SMBC Co. Ltd., after Sumitomo Bank merged with Sakura Bank on 1 April 2001 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG). However, in 2010, SMBC acquired Nikko Cordial (Japan&#x27;s third-largest brokerage at that time). 

===Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Company===
Following this step, Daiwa dissolved the joint-venture with SMBC and re-acquired 100% of the shares in the company, before renaming it again as Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. Ltd. Finally, about two years later, the company was absorbed in a merger, leaving Daiwa Securities Co. Ltd as the sole entity.

=== DC Advisory ===
In May 2009, Daiwa acquired the corporate finance division of Close Brothers Group. In 2010, it was renamed to DC Advisory and now acts as the corporate finance arm of Daiwa.

<doc id="1284177" wikidata="Q6372129" url="?curid=1284177" title="Karl Ohs">
<text>Karl Ohs (November 18, 1946 – November 25, 2007) was an American politician who served as the 28th Lieutenant Governor of the state of Montana serving under Judy Martz.

==Background==
Karl Ohs was born in Malta, Montana, the son of a Swedish immigrant. He was a Montana rancher and farmer prior entering politics. He attended Montana State College (Later Montana State University) where he wrestled for the Fighting Bobcats and was a two time Big Sky Conference Champion. In 1969, Ohs left his studies in agricultural economics at Montana State University to help the family move to a new ranch in Pony, Montana in a Tobacco Root Mountain valley outside Harrison in Madison County. Ohs was only a few credits short of graduation when he left Montana State.

He stayed on to work the family ranch with his father and his brother, Jerry, and raised his four children, Brad, Eric, Brian and Elizabeth. While serving as Lieutenant Governor, Karl returned to MSU and completed his Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural business in 2004. Accepting his diploma and giving the commencement speech, Ohs said, &quot;I promised myself I would be back, but I never thought it would be 40 years.&quot;

==Political career==
Ohs political involvement was sparked when he attended Willie Nelson&#x27;s Farm Aid conference in St. Louis in September 1986. Carrying the vital spirit sparked by meeting with farmers and ranchers from all over the United States, Ohs returned home and began searching for ways and means of increasing economic options for Montana agriculture. In 1988, Ohs and nine other Montana ranchers and farmers formed MAGPI, Montana Agricultural Producers, Inc. Ohs served as Chairman of MAGPI, leading the company&#x27;s exploration of alternative products and alternative markets.

For MAGPI, alternative crops had to be accompanied by alternative markets. &quot;No sense in growing it if you can&#x27;t sell it and make a profit,&quot; Ohs often said. In 1989 and 1990, Ohs traveled throughout Montana, educating and encouraging farmers to consider canola as a contract crop, much as they did for barley. MAGPI also promoted production of weed seed-free hay, participating in programs to require only weed seed-free hay on US Forest Service and State owned lands: &quot;It&#x27;s win-win all way around: we need to get after our noxious weeds here in Montana and we need to find crops farmers can grow that have a market.&quot;

Ohs served in the Montana House of Representatives in 1995, 1997, and 1999. During the 1997 and 1999 sessions, he served as Majority Whip. During his time in the Montana State Legislature, Ohs sponsored the legislation that resulted in the purchase, by the state, of the Bovey properties in Virginia City and Nevada City, keeping the history and artifacts of Virginia and Nevada Cities accessible to future generations. Prior to his involvement in state politics, Ohs served 7 years on the Harrison, Montana school board (1978–1984). Running successfully for Lieutenant Governor in 2000 with gubernatorial candidate Judy Martz, Ohs was an active member of the administration, taking a leadership role is resolving complex or controversial issues facing the state including serving as chairman of the Governor&#x27;s Drought Advisory Committee during drought years and chairing the K-12 Public School Renewal Commission working across party lines to solve the Montana public schools&#x27; funding problems.

Ohs was best known for his role in peacefully ending the Montana Freeman standoff near Jordan, Montana. In 1996, asked for help by a former ranch hand whose daughter and granddaughter were inside, Ohs served as principal negotiator making 19 separate trips into the Freeman compound. His involvement earned him the 1998 The Louis E. Peters Memorial Service Award given by the FBI for public service. His efforts also served as a model for FBI handling of similar situations and Ohs traveled to Washington, D.C. to help the FBI develop negotiator training programs based on his experiences.

==Later years==
In 2002, Ohs was elected chairman of the National Lieutenant Governors Association. Following his four-year tenure as Lieutenant Governor, Ohs was elected chairman of the Montana Republican Party in 2005. Ohs chose not to seek the party post in 2007 due to his efforts to recover from surgery and chemotherapy for brain cancer. Ohs died of brain cancer on Sunday, November 25, 2007 at his home in Helena, Montana, aged 61. The Montana Law Enforcement Academy has dedicated a building to the late former Montana Lt. Gov. Karl Ohs.

==Personal life==
Starting in 1996, he owned and operated several small businesses in southwest Montana. Ohs had four children: Brad, Eric, Brian and Elizabeth.

<text>Bill Williams (May 29, 1960 – May 28, 1998) was an American video game designer, programmer, composer, and author born with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder. According to a medical encyclopedia Williams consulted when he was 12, people with cystic fibrosis weren&#x27;t expected to live past the age of 13.

Williams created a string of computer games from 1982 through 1990 for the Atari 8-bit computers and then the Amiga which are admired for their imaginative design concepts, innovative sound and music, and skillful implementation. &quot;Necromancer&quot; is a three-stage game about a wizard growing and controlling an army of trees. Scenarios in &quot;Alley Cat&quot; include stealthily drinking from the bowls of sleeping dogs, avoiding a sweeping broom to jump inside a fish bowl, and collecting ferns atop a bookcase protected by spiders. &quot;Mind Walker&quot;, one of the first games released for the Amiga, puts the player inside the head of a physics professor gone mad.

Late in his career he worked on a licensed game for the Nintendo Entertainment System and another for the Super NES, but became frustrated with the game business and left to attend the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago and write two theological works.

Williams died from cystic fibrosis in 1998, at the age of 37.

==Game design==
Bill Williams&#x27;s first published game was the vertically scrolling &quot;Salmon Run&quot; for the Atari 8-bit computers, published by the Atari Program Exchange in 1982. The player controls a salmon traveling upriver to mate while jumping waterfalls and avoiding bears and other obstacles.

He then wrote two games for Synapse Software: &quot;Necromancer&quot; (1982) and &quot;Alley Cat&quot; (1983). &quot;Alley Cat&quot; was begun by another programmer, John Harris, who abandoned the project. Each game is a collection of smaller games. &quot;Necromancer&quot; begins with a wizard growing and protecting trees, then, in the next stage, using those trees to crush spider eggs in stone vaults. &quot;Alley Cat&quot; takes place behind an urban apartment building and jumping through an open window starts one of six surreal minigames.

Synapse ported &quot;Salmon Run&quot; to the VIC-20, publishing it in 1983 under the label Showcase Software. In 1984, Synapse published the stress reduction package &quot;Relax&quot;, combining a sensor headband and minigames providing biofeedback. The software was a collaboration between Williams and fellow Synapse game designer Kelly Jones (who wrote the 1983 Atari 8-bit game &quot;Drelbs&quot;).

Williams then moved to the Amiga, designing and programming &quot;Mind Walker&quot;. It was published by Commodore in 1986 as one of the earliest releases for the new computer. He followed that game with &quot;Sinbad and the Throne of the Falcon&quot; (1987), and &quot;Pioneer Plague&quot; (1988). &quot;Pioneer Plague&quot; was the first Amiga game to make full use of the difficult to work with Hold-And-Modify mode for the in-game graphics. His final game for the platform was &quot;Knights of the Crystallion&quot; (1990):
For almost all of these Atari 8-bit and Amiga titles, Williams did the design and programming, created the art and sound effects, and composed the music. The credits often read, simply, &quot;by Bill Williams.&quot;

Near the end of his game development career he worked on &quot;Monopoly&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System and &quot;Bart&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; for Super NES. Both games were for Sculptured Software in Salt Lake City, Utah, though Williams worked out of his home. Company meddling during the development of the last game prompted Williams to abandon the video game industry completely, calling the experience &quot;Bill&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;. Some Super Nintendo sound driver code written by Williams during this time was used in other games.

==Writing==
Williams wrote the book &quot;Naked Before God: The Return of a Broken Disciple&quot;, published by Morehouse Publishing in May 1998 and in paperback in 2001. It imagines himself as a disciple of Jesus with cystic fibrosis in the present day, trying to understand his struggles with CF and diabetes, and Jesus&#x27;s message. A collection of poetry and short prose, &quot;Manna in the Wilderness: A Harvest of Hope&quot;, illustrated by his wife Martha Williams, was published posthumously in March 1999.

==Death==
Bill had been born with the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis, which affected his lungs and impaired his ability to breathe. In 1992, he moved to Chicago to study at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, but the city&#x27;s air pollution worsened his condition significantly, and he had to drop out after two years with only half of the program completed. He moved to Rockport, Texas, but his health continued to deteriorate until he died of complications from the disorder on May 28, 1998, one day before his 38th birthday.

<text>Luis Manuel Valentín Rodríguez-Varela y Sancena (13 February 1768–1826), also known as El Conde Filipino (literally, &quot;The Philippine Count&quot; in Spanish), was a Philippine protonationalist who flourished during the Spanish colonial era.

An insular Spaniard and an &quot;ilustrado&quot; who went to school in France, Rodríguez-Varela published a series of books advocating social change in the Spanish Philippines, inspired by the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. His most important work is &quot;El parnaso filipino&quot;, published in Sampaloc, Manila in 1814. 

He advocated the opening of local colleges to teach subjects such as mathematics, medicine, and navigation, as well as free primary schools for the poor. Rodríguez-Varela also believed that foreign powers held too much influence over the local economy, and he accordingly worked to limit Chinese intrusion in the region by bolstering the local business associations.

Along with José Ortega, Rodríguez-Varela was one of several people expelled from the island by Governor Juan Antonio Martínez on February 18, 1823, when they were accused of conspiring against the local Spanish government.

<text>The Jackknife (or Jack-knife) Bascule Bridge is a bascule bridge that spans the Kaministiquia River at Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, to link the city to Mission Island, one of two islands in the Kaministiquia River delta. The bridge was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway between August 1910 and April 1913. The contractor for the abutments and piers was Alexander Charles Stewart (1867–1944). The bridge had two decks, the lower deck for trains and the upper deck for vehicular road traffic.
The vehicular portion of the bridge was replaced by the Island Drive Bridge, which connects neighbouring McKellar Island to the mainland, in 2003. The connecting roadways and upper deck of the Jackknife Bridge were dismantled in 2004, but the lower deck continues to function as the only rail link to the islands.

== General overview ==
The Jackknife Bascule Bridge has a road width of 29 feet (or 8.84 meters. The length of the entire bridge is 374 feet (or 114 meters) in size.

<text>The Northrop M2-F3 is a heavyweight lifting body rebuilt from the Northrop M2-F2 after it crashed at the Dryden Flight Research Center in 1967. It was modified with an additional third vertical fin - centered between the tip fins - to improve control characteristics. The &quot;M&quot; refers to &quot;manned&quot; and &quot;F&quot; refers to &quot;flight&quot; version.

==Development==
Early flight testing of the M2-F1 and M2-F2 lifting body reentry configurations had validated the concept of piloted lifting body reentry from space. When the M2-F2 crashed on May 10, 1967, valuable information had already been obtained and was contributing to new designs.

NASA pilots said the M2-F2 had lateral control problems, so when the M2-F2 was rebuilt at Northrop and redesignated the M2-F3, it was modified with an additional third vertical fin - centered between the tip fins - to improve control characteristics.

After a three-year-long redesign and rebuilding effort, the M2-F3 was ready to fly. The May 1967 crash of the M2-F2 had torn off the left fin and landing gear. It had also damaged the external skin and internal structure. Flight Research Center engineers worked with Ames Research Center and the Air Force in redesigning the vehicle with a center fin to provide greater stability. At first, it seemed that the vehicle had been irreparably damaged, but the original manufacturer, Northrop, did the repair work and returned the redesigned M2-F3 with a center fin for stability to the FRC.

While the M2-F3 was still demanding to fly, the center fin eliminated the high risk of pilot-induced oscillation (PIO) that was characteristic of the M2-F2.

==Operational history==
First flight of the M2-F3, with NASA pilot Bill Dana at the controls, was June 2, 1970. The modified vehicle exhibited much better lateral stability and control characteristics than before, and only three glide flights were necessary before the first powered flight on November 25, 1970. The 100th flight of the heavy-weight lifting bodies was completed on October 5, 1972, with pilot Bill Dana soaring to an altitude of 66,300 feet (20,200 m) and a Mach number of 1.370 (about ) in the M2-F3. Over its 27 missions, the M2-F3 reached a top speed of (Mach 1.6). Highest altitude reached by the vehicle was 71,500 feet (20,790 m) on December 20, 1972, the date of its last flight, with NASA pilot John Manke at the controls.

A reaction control thruster (RCT) system, similar to that on orbiting spacecraft, was also installed to obtain research data about their effectiveness for vehicle control. As the M2-F3&#x27;s portion of the lifting body program neared an end, it evaluated a rate command augmentation control system, and a side control stick similar to side-stick controllers now used on many modern aircraft.

NASA donated the M2-F3 vehicle to the Smithsonian Institution in December 1973. It is currently hanging in the National Air and Space Museum along with the X-15 aircraft number 1, which was its hangar partner at Dryden from 1965 to 1969.

<doc id="1284222" wikidata="Q1193364" url="?curid=1284222" title="Succession to the Spanish throne">
<text>Succession to the Spanish throne follows male-preference cognatic primogeniture. A dynast who marries against the express prohibition of the monarch and the Cortes Generales, the legislative chamber of Spain, is excluded from the succession. Upon proclamation by the Cortes Generales, the monarch is to take an oath to discharge his duties faithfully, to abide by the Constitution and the law and ensure they are abided by, and to respect the rights of the citizens and of the Autonomous Communities. 

== Line of succession ==
The 1978 Constitution of Spain establishes the succession in favour of the heirs of King Juan Carlos I. 
 King Juan Carlos I (b. 1938)
** King Felipe VI (b. 1968)
*** (1) Leonor, Princess of Asturias (b. 2005)
*** (2) Infanta Sofía (b. 2007)
** (3) Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo (b. 1963)
*** (4) &quot;Don&quot; Felipe de Marichalar y Borbón, Lord of Tejada (b. 1998)
*** (5) &quot;Doña&quot; Victoria de Marichalar y Borbón, Lady of Tejada (b. 2000)
** (6) Infanta Cristina (b. 1965)
*** (7) &quot;Don&quot; Juan Urdangarin y Borbón (b. 1999)
*** (8) &quot;Don&quot; Pablo Urdangarin y Borbón (b. 2000)
*** (9) &quot;Don&quot; Miguel Urdangarin y Borbón (b. 2002)
*** (10) &quot;Doña&quot; Irene Urdangarin y Borbón (b. 2005)

==Succession uncertainties==
Section 1 of Article 57 of the 1978 Constitution of Spain provides that The Crown of Spain is hereditary to the &quot;&quot; of His Majesty Don Juan Carlos I de Borbón. To date, no clarification has been made whether this provision includes anyone beyond the direct descendants of King Juan Carlos. Successors may not be presumed to be synonymous with descendants. Section 3 of Article 57 further states that should all the lines designated by law become extinct, the Cortes Generales shall provide for succession to the Crown in the manner most suitable for the interests of Spain.

Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz and Infanta Margarita, Duchess of Soria, sisters of King Juan Carlos, respectively renounced their rights to the succession upon marriage but before the adoption of the Constitution. Similarly, the rights of earlier generations are clouded by renunciations and unapproved marriages which may or may not exclude them from succession. 

Section 5 of Article 57 provides that abdications and renunciations and any doubt in fact or in law that may arise in relation to the succession of the Crown shall be settled by an organic act. Unless and until one clarifies the rights of the extended Family of the King, it is unknown who or if anyone follows Infanta Cristina&#x27;s descendants in the line of succession.

===Possible interpretations===
*The Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the Cortes Generales, has the constitutional responsibility to clarify the succession when doubt arises. If &quot;&quot; is deemed to mean direct descendants, the succession ends with the heirs of Infanta Cristina.
* If the renunciations by Infanta Pilar and Infanta Margarita are not deemed valid, their descendants would follow the line of succession:
&quot;Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona (1913–1993)&quot;
** King Juan Carlos I (b. 1938)
**&quot;Infanta Pilar, Duchess of Badajoz and Viscountess of La Torre (1936–2020)&quot;
***&quot; Don Juan Gómez-Acebo y Borbón, 3rd Viscount of La Torre&quot; (1969–2024)
****(11) Don Nicolás Gómez-Acebo y Carney, 4th Viscount of La Torre (b. 2013)
***(12) Andrés De Follonosa y Marquïna- Viscount of La armería,Earl of La Mancha (b. 1998)
****(13) Alejandro Gómez-Acebo y Cano (b. 2004)
****(14) Guillermo Gómez-Acebo y Cano (b. 2005)
****(15) Álvaro Gómez-Acebo y Cano (b. 2011)
***(16) Don Luis Gómez-Acebo y Borbón (b. 1973)

****(28) Carlos Zurita y Borbón (b. 2018)

==Planned absolute primogeniture==
In its 2004 election manifesto, the victorious Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (PSOE) included plans to adopt absolute primogeniture, a proposal which was supported by the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative People&#x27;s Party. It was initially thought that the change would only apply to future generations but with all the major political parties in agreement that the system of male-preference primogeniture conflicts with the constitutionally established principle of gender equality, it was planned that the law would be changed before Letizia, then the Princess of Asturias, bore a son, thereby demoting Infanta Leonor in the line succession. The subsequent announcement, in 2006, that the Princess was pregnant with a second daughter, however, removed any immediate urgency in the passage of the necessary legislation.

<doc id="1284226" wikidata="Q1327762" url="?curid=1284226" title="Elementary class">
<text>In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, an elementary class (or axiomatizable class) is a class consisting of all structures satisfying a fixed first-order theory.

== Definition ==
A class &quot;K&quot; of structures of a signature σ is called an elementary class if there is a first-order theory &quot;T&quot; of signature σ, such that &quot;K&quot; consists of all models of &quot;T&quot;, i.e., of all σ-structures that satisfy &quot;T&quot;. If &quot;T&quot; can be chosen as a theory consisting of a single first-order sentence, then &quot;K&quot; is called a basic elementary class.

More generally, &quot;K&quot; is a pseudo-elementary class if there is a first-order theory &quot;T&quot; of a signature that extends σ, such that &quot;K&quot; consists of all σ-structures that are reducts to σ of models of &quot;T&quot;. In other words, a class &quot;K&quot; of σ-structures is pseudo-elementary if and only if there is an elementary class &quot;K&#x27;&quot; such that &quot;K&quot; consists of precisely the reducts to σ of the structures in &quot;K&#x27;&quot;.

For obvious reasons, elementary classes are also called axiomatizable in first-order logic, and basic elementary classes are called finitely axiomatizable in first-order logic. These definitions extend to other logics in the obvious way, but since the first-order case is by far the most important, axiomatizable implicitly refers to this case when no other logic is specified.

== Conflicting and alternative terminology ==
While the above is nowadays standard terminology in &quot;infinite&quot; model theory, the slightly different earlier definitions are still in use in finite model theory, where an elementary class may be called a Δ-elementary class, and the terms elementary class and first-order axiomatizable class are reserved for basic elementary classes (Ebbinghaus et al. 1994, Ebbinghaus and Flum 2005). Hodges calls elementary classes axiomatizable classes, and he refers to basic elementary classes as definable classes. He also uses the respective synonyms ECformula_1 class and EC class (Hodges, 1993).

There are good reasons for this diverging terminology. The signatures that are considered in general model theory are often infinite, while a single first-order sentence contains only finitely many symbols. Therefore, basic elementary classes are atypical in infinite model theory. Finite model theory, on the other hand, deals almost exclusively with finite signatures. It is easy to see that for every finite signature σ and for every class &quot;K&quot; of σ-structures closed under isomorphism there is an elementary class formula_2 of σ-structures such that &quot;K&quot; and formula_2 contain precisely the same finite structures. Hence, elementary classes are not very interesting for finite model theorists.

== Easy relations between the notions ==

Clearly every basic elementary class is an elementary class, and every elementary class is a pseudo-elementary class. Moreover, as an easy consequence of the compactness theorem, a class of σ-structures is basic elementary if and only if it is elementary and its complement is also elementary.

== Examples ==
=== A basic elementary class ===
Let σ be a signature consisting only of a unary function symbol &quot;f&quot;. The class &quot;K&quot; of σ-structures in which &quot;f&quot; is one-to-one is a basic elementary class. This is witnessed by the theory &quot;T&quot;, which consists only of the single sentence 
:formula_4.

=== An elementary, basic pseudoelementary class that is not basic elementary ===
Let σ be an arbitrary signature. The class &quot;K&quot; of all infinite σ-structures is elementary. To see this, consider the sentences

:formula_5 &quot;formula_6&quot;,

:formula_7 &quot;formula_8&quot;,

and so on. (So the sentence formula_9 says that there are at least &quot;n&quot; elements.) The infinite σ-structures are precisely the models of the theory

:formula_10.

But &quot;K&quot; is not a basic elementary class. Otherwise the infinite σ-structures would be precisely those that satisfy a certain first-order sentence τ. But then the set
formula_11 would be inconsistent. By the compactness theorem, for some natural number &quot;n&quot; the set formula_12 would be inconsistent. But this is absurd, because this theory is satisfied by any finite σ-structure with formula_13 or more elements.

However, there is a basic elementary class &quot;K&#x27;&quot; in the signature σ&#x27; = σ formula_14 {&quot;f&quot;}, where &quot;f&quot; is a unary function symbol, such that &quot;K&quot; consists exactly of the reducts to σ of σ&#x27;-structures in &quot;K&#x27;&quot;. &quot;K&#x27;&quot; is axiomatised by the single sentence formula_15, which expresses that &quot;f&quot; is injective but not surjective. Therefore, &quot;K&quot; is elementary and what could be called basic pseudo-elementary, but not basic elementary.

=== Pseudo-elementary class that is non-elementary ===
Finally, consider the signature σ consisting of a single unary relation symbol &quot;P&quot;. Every σ-structure is partitioned into two subsets: Those elements for which &quot;P&quot; holds, and the rest. Let &quot;K&quot; be the class of all σ-structures for which these two subsets have the same cardinality, i.e., there is a bijection between them. This class is not elementary, because a σ-structure in which both the set of realisations of &quot;P&quot; and its complement are countably infinite satisfies precisely the same first-order sentences as a σ-structure in which one of the sets is countably infinite and the other is uncountable.

Now consider the signature formula_16, which consists of &quot;P&quot; along with a unary function symbol &quot;f&quot;. Let formula_2 be the class of all formula_16-structures such that &quot;f&quot; is a bijection and &quot;P&quot; holds for &quot;x&quot; iff &quot;P&quot; does not hold for &quot;f(x)&quot;. formula_2 is clearly an elementary class, and therefore &quot;K&quot; is an example of a pseudo-elementary class that is not elementary.

=== Non-pseudo-elementary class===
Let σ be an arbitrary signature. The class &quot;K&quot; of all finite σ-structures is not elementary, because (as shown above) its complement is elementary but not basic elementary. Since this is also true for every signature extending σ, &quot;K&quot; is not even a pseudo-elementary class.

This example demonstrates the limits of expressive power inherent in first-order logic as opposed to the far more expressive second-order logic. Second-order logic, however, fails to retain many desirable properties of first-order logic, such as the completeness and compactness theorems.

The program launched in January 1985, initially airing on Mondays at 7:30 p.m. In its second season it was shifted to Sunday nights, airing after the network&#x27;s Sunday night newscast &quot;Sunday Report&quot;. It remained in that time slot until &quot;Sunday Report&quot; was expanded into the full one-hour &quot;CBC News: Sunday Night&quot; in 2004, at which time it moved to 7:00 p.m. Sunday evening.

Its original host was Patrick Watson, who left in 1987 to work on the documentary series &quot;The Struggle for Democracy&quot;. He was succeeded by Robert Scully, whose concurrent hosting of the news talk show &quot;Scully Rencontre&quot; on Télévision de Radio-Canada made him the first person in Canadian television history to simultaneously host programs on both the English and French services of the CBC. Scully hosted until 1997, when he was succeeded by Dianne Buckner, who hosted for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run.

&quot;Venture&quot;&#x27;s special features included a recurring documentary series called &quot;Back to the Floor&quot;, in which a chief executive officer works at an entry-level job within their own company for a day. &quot;Back to the Floor&quot; was a Gemini Award nominee for Best Reality Program or Series at the 19th Gemini Awards in 2004; the following year, the program won the award for the episode &quot;The Town Doctor&quot;.

In the show&#x27;s final season, Buckner was also concurrently host of &quot;Dragons&#x27; Den&quot;, CBC&#x27;s new reality series centred on entrepreneurship. On April 4, 2007, CBC announced the cancellation of &quot;Venture&quot;. The final episode was broadcast on September 2, 2007.

<text>Wassoulou () is a genre of West African popular music named for the Wassoulou cultural area.

Wassoulou music is performed mostly by women. Some recurring themes in the lyrics are childbearing, fertility, and polygamy. Instrumentation includes soku (a traditional fiddle sometimes replaced with modern imported instruments), djembe drum, kamalen n&#x27;goni (a six-stringed harp), karinyan (metal tube percussion) and bolon (a four-stringed harp). The vocals are often passionate and emphatic, and delivered in a call-and-response pattern.

Prominent Wassoulou artists include Nahawa Doumbia, Oumou Sangaré, Coumba Sidibe, Dienaba Diakite, Kagbe Sidibe, Sali Sidibe, Jah Youssouf, and Fatoumata Diawara.

<doc id="1284254" wikidata="Q94265" url="?curid=1284254" title="Vince DiCola">
<text>Vincent Louis DiCola (born November 11, 1957) is an American composer, keyboardist and arranger. He has composed scores for films such as &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, and &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot;. DiCola also pioneered the use of sequencers on his soundtrack recording for &quot;Rocky IV&quot;, one of the first to exploit the Fairlight CMI and Synclavier II&#x27;s computer&#x27;s sequencing capabilities.

==Life and career==
DiCola was born in 1957 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, to Italian-American parents. After majoring in percussion in college, DiCola began his professional music career upon moving to California in 1981. One of his early credits as a session musician was his synthesizer performance on Juice Newton&#x27;s albums &quot;Dirty Looks&quot; and &quot;Old Flame&quot; released in 1983 and 1985, respectively. His first major break came when he was chosen to co-write several songs on the &quot;Staying Alive&quot; soundtrack (1983) with Frank Stallone. Following his work on the &quot;Staying Alive&quot; project, he was recruited by Sylvester Stallone to write the original score for &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985), followed by scoring &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; (1986). Since then, he has been active in the capacity of producer, recorded and performed as both a solo artist and member of several bands, and continues to work as a session musician and contributor to film soundtracks as composer and performer.

DiCola counts Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer among his biggest influences in progressive rock music. He also admires film-music composers Thomas Newman, John Powell and Jerry Goldsmith.

==Awards==
In 1983, DiCola was a co-nominee for the Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special Grammy for co-writing the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Staying Alive&quot;, in spite of the poor critical reception of the film. He also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Song – Motion Picture for the song &quot;Far from Over&quot;, which he co-wrote with Frank Stallone for the same film.

At the time, critics didn&#x27;t appreciate his usage of electronic music in the &quot;Rocky IV&quot; soundtrack and he received a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Musical Score as a result.

==Transformers==
DiCola has had enough of a cult following amongst &quot;Transformers&quot; fans to have warranted the release of several albums of music related to the Transformers movie, as follow-ups to the release of the original 1986 &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; soundtrack.

First released as a BotCon&#x27;97 exclusive, the 2-CD set &quot;Til All Are One&quot; contains the first full score of the movie. BotCon 2001 saw the releases of &quot;The Protoform Sessions&quot; (featuring demos and rarities and including extended commentary from DiCola) and &quot;Artistic Transformations: Themes and Variations&quot;, containing solo piano renditions of songs from the soundtrack, as well as another complete score on a single disc named &quot;Lighting Their Darkest Hour&quot;.

He has been a guest at multiple Transformers conventions, including appearances at &quot;BotCon&#x27;97&quot;, &quot;BotCon&#x27;98&quot;, &quot;BotCon 2000&quot; and &quot;The Official Transformers Collectors&#x27; Convention 2004&quot; in Rosemont, Illinois.

An interview with DiCola was included on the Region 1 DVD release of &quot;The Transformers: The Movie&quot; released by Rhino Entertainment in the year 2000. However, this interview is not present on the 20th Anniversary Edition released by Sony and BMG in 2006.

DiCola credits his work on &quot;Transformers&quot; with getting his music exposed to a much wider audience and getting him the most attention and fame he has had as an artist.

==Solo works==
DiCola released his first solo work in 1986, an album simply titled &quot;Piano Solos&quot;. He later worked both as an arranger and performer on a 1991 multi-artist project called &quot;Artfully Beatles&quot;, which led him to release &quot;Artistically Beatles&quot;, an album of ten Beatles songs he arranged and performed, in 1993.

An additional solo album called &quot;Falling Off a Clef&quot; was released in 2004. In the same year, he completed the soundtrack to the low-rated 2004 film &quot;Sci-Fighter&quot;, collaborating with the composer Kenny Meriedeth in October 2003, using Kenny&#x27;s synthesizer and sound banks. The album &quot;Falling Off a Clef&quot; contains six new tracks (Castle of the Gods suite, Alien March, Fallen Angel, FS#7, A. P.B., Castle of the Gods Variation) + a selection of 20 tracks from Sci-Fighter soundtrack.

==Other works==
In addition to his solo work, DiCola has worked with various musical groups.

In 1991–1992 he began working with the 5-piece rock band Storming Heaven, releasing the album &quot;Life in Paradise&quot; in 1996. In addition to DiCola on keyboards, guitar and vocals, the Storming Heaven lineup included lead vocalist Rick Livingston, &quot;Jethro Tull&quot; drummer Doane Perry, guitarist Curtis Taylor, and keyboardist Casey Young. &quot;Life in Paradise&quot; was written during 1991.

The band was originally formed in January 1991. They spent the first half of the year creating the start of a musical suite entitled &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Journey&quot;, an idea that later was abandoned in favor of individual songs. &quot;It was supposed to be an entire album based on a kind of science fiction theme. Those first four songs (&quot;Cross the Line&quot;, &quot;Red Knight&quot;, &quot;The Passage&quot; and &quot;Dream House&quot;), they&#x27;re sort of like the opening four songs of a suite.&quot;

Around the same time in 1996, DiCola, Storming Heaven bandmate Doane Perry, and Tower of Power vocalist Ellis Hall formed a soul/progressive-rock trio named Thread and released their one and only self-titled album on CD.

In 1999, he recorded experimental and largely improvisational instrumental tracks under the name of The Firing Squad. These recordings remain officially unreleased but several tracks have been posted on YouTube.

In 2001, he worked again with Perry and released &quot;In-VINCE-ible!&quot;, a collection of diverse works from various past projects, with ex-members of Santana and Chicago assisting as session musicians, and featuring several special guests including Steve Walsh of Kansas and his Storming Heaven bandmates.

DiCola appeared as keyboardist on the first Hughes Turner Project album &quot;HTP&quot; in 2003.

He and Perry once again formed a trio, this time with bassist Paul Ill and called DPI, to release a three-track EP called &quot;Found Objects&quot; in 2006. Previously the trio had worked with vocalist Vincent Kendall and guitarist Reeves Gabrels in releasing a 42-minute suite called &quot;Pity the Rich&quot; based on recordings made at the same time. The jam-session style recordings for these releases were originally intended to be part of a new DiCola solo instrumental release, but while editing the tracks in his home studio DiCola felt they had the feel of a project for a band and chose to expand his original plan to include the other performers.

In 2007, &quot;Paulie&#x27;s Robot&quot; from &quot;Rocky IV&quot; was used in the episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Movin&#x27; Out&quot;, and in 2010, &quot;Training Montage&quot;, also from the &quot;Rocky IV&quot; soundtrack, was used in the episode &quot;Something, Something, Something, Dark Side&quot;.

In 2008, he was featured on the &quot;Gran Turismo 5 Prologue&quot; Original Soundtrack and was responsible (along with guitarist Doug Bossi) for arranging the series theme, &quot;Moon Over the Castle&quot;, which was written by Masahiro Andoh of T-Square, with which DiCola worked on their 2001 album Truth 21c (released as T-Square Plus).

He described his work on the Gran Turismo&#x27;s soundtrack&#x27;s project in an interview with Music4Games, noting that he collaborated with T-Square and Doug Bossi on the project, and looks forward to becoming involved with game music in the future.

In 2009, he composed the song &quot;Bound and Gagged&quot; as a submission for &quot;&quot;. The track featured DiCola on keyboards and drums, Kenny Meriedeth on guitars, and Rick Livingstone on vocals but was not selected by Michael Bay for the &quot;Transformers II&quot; soundtrack.

In 2011, he began composing music for the video game &quot;Saturday Morning RPG&quot; from Mighty Rabbit Studios. The game released on the iTunes App Store in March 2012.

In 2012, DiCola recorded the official theme for Chikara&#x27;s King of Trios professional wrestling event, alongside Kenny Meriedeth.

In 2013, DiCola released a Christmas medley that was featured as a part of the &quot;Saturday Morning RPG&quot; soundtrack ahead of a planned full soundtrack release for the game.

In 2014, DiCola along with Kenny Meriedeth, wrote the music for &quot;Angry Birds Transformers&quot; for Rovio.

DiCola also wrote original music for the video game &quot;&quot;.

In 2016, DiCola also alongside Meriedeth wrote original music for the video game &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan&quot;.

In 2019 DiCola features on the song &quot;This Isn&#x27;t Love&quot; from the album &quot;Exhibits&quot; by the rock band Work Of Art. He also toured in 2019 with Glenn Hughes playing keyboards on his &#x27;Glenn Hughes Performs Classic Deep Purple&#x27; tour.

<doc id="1284255" wikidata="Q5471425" url="?curid=1284255" title="Fort Kearny">
<text>Fort Kearny was a historic outpost of the United States Army founded in 1848 in the Western United States during the middle and late 19th century. The fort was named after Colonel and later General Stephen Watts Kearny. The outpost was located along the Oregon Trail near Kearney, Nebraska. The town of Kearney took its name from the fort. The &quot;e&quot; was added to Kearny by postmen who consistently misspelled the town name. A portion of the original site is preserved as Fort Kearny State Historical Park by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.

The fort became the eastern anchor of the Great Platte River Road and thus an important military and civilian way station for 20 years. Wagon trains moving west, were able to resupply after completing about a sixth (16%) of the journey. The fort offered a safe resting area for the eastern immigrants in this new and hostile land. Livestock could be traded for fresh stock and letters sent back to the states. The fort continued to expand over the years, until there were over 30 buildings before its closure in 1871. It took on additional roles as a Pony Express station, an Overland Stage station and a telegraph station.

==Origins and various missions of the fort==
The fort was built in response to the growth of overland emigration to Oregon after 1845. The first post, Fort Kearny, was established in the spring of 1848 &quot;near the head of the Grand Island&quot; along the Platte River by Lieutenant Daniel P. Woodbury. It was first called Fort Chiles, but in 1848 the post was renamed Fort Kearny in honor of General Stephen Watts Kearny.

In 1848, the Pawnee Nation negotiated a major treaty with the US government at Fort Kearny. Noted diplomat Jeffrey Deroine, a formerly enslaved man, served as an interpreter for this treaty.

Despite its lack of fortifications, Fort Kearny served as way station, sentinel post, supply depot, and message center for 49&#x27;ers bound for California and homeseekers traveling to California, Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. The earliest surviving photograph of the post, taken in 1858 by Samuel C. Mills, shows the post as a collection of adobe buildings without any wall or fortifications. By the 1860s, the fort had become a significant state and freighting station and home station of the Pony Express. During the Indian Wars of 1864–1865, a small stockade was apparently built upon the earth embankment still visible. Although never under attack, the post did serve as an outfitting depot for several Indian campaigns.

The fort was a precious source of provisions for emigrants on the early section of the trail for several decades during the height of the trail use until its abandonment in 1871. As it had been founded along the Platte River to protect emigrants on the trail westward, the fort became an important stop along the eastern part of the trail for the following decade, offering the sale of food, reliable mail service and other amenities. At the height of the pioneer trail use in the 1850s, as many as 2,000 emigrants and 10,000 oxen might pass through in a single day during the height of the trail season in late May.

One of the fort&#x27;s final duties was the protection of workers building the Union Pacific. In 1871, two years after the completion of the transcontinental railroad, the fort was discontinued as a military post. Its buildings were disassembled and moved West to outfit newer posts.

==Description==
The fort was intended mostly as a supply post, and not as defensive position in the Indian Wars. Throughout most of its history, the fort consisted mostly of wooden buildings surrounding a central parade ground without fortified walls. Throughout the decades of its use until the completion of the transcontinental railroad, the character of the buildings became slightly more permanent, changing from adobe and sod structures to wooden frame construction. Although it was in the heart of area inhabited by American Indians aka Native Americans, and was near the center of hostile action in the 1860s, no direct attack was ever made on the fort.

==History==

===First Fort Kearny===
The fort along the Platte River was the second of two army posts in present-day Nebraska to be named after Colonel Stephen W. Kearny of the US Army. In 1838, Kearny had scouted the area along the Missouri River at the mouth of Table Creek near present-day Nebraska City looking for a suitable location for an outpost to protect westward travelers. In 1846, following Kearny&#x27;s recommendation, the United States War Department had ordered the building of an outpost on the site and directed Kearny to construct one there. The Army then sent Colonel Kearny with a detachment of men from Fort Leavenworth up the Missouri to the area with orders to construct an outpost at the selected site.

The Army constructed a two-story wooden blockhouse on the site, which became known as Camp Kearny and later Fort Kearny. The Army quickly realized, however, the location was not chosen well, since few emigrants passed the site on their way west. Instead, the main routes of the trails preferred by emigrants lay to the north near Omaha and to the south. Construction was subsequently halted on the site, with the exception of the erection of a number of log huts for temporary quarters for a battalion of troops who wintered there in 1847–1848.

===Second Fort Kearny===
In September 1847, Kearny sent topographical engineer Lt. Daniel P. Woodbury westward along the Platte looking for a more suitable location for the outpost. Woodbury selected a site in present-day central Nebraska near the spot where the Trail westward from Independence, Missouri joined the trail westward from Omaha and Council Bluffs. Woodbury described the spot in his journals as:

:I have located the post opposite a group of wooded islands in the Platte River ... three hundred seventeen miles from Independence, Missouri, one hundred seventeen miles from Fort Kearny on the Missouri and three miles from the head of the group of islands called Grand Island.

In December Woodbury went to Washington, D.C., with orders to secure organization of the new post. Woodbury requested an appropriation of $15,000 for construction, while advocating the employment of Mormon emigrants for construction. Although he did not receive these provisions, Woodbury received permission to build the fort from scratch with soldier labor.

The Army abandoned the Table Creek post in May 1848 and arrived at the new site in June. Woodbury directed construction of the fort with 175 men as labor. They built wooden buildings around a four-acre (16,000 m2) parade ground, with cottonwood trees planted around the perimeter. Woodbury initially named the fort &quot;Fort Childs&quot; after Col. Thomas Childs, a famous soldier in the Mexican–American War, as well as Woodbury&#x27;s father-in-law. A directive from War Department, however, directed that the name &quot;Fort Kearny&quot; would be transferred to the new fort.

The fort grew rapidly into an important trail stop. By June 1849, Woodbury noted in his journals that 4,000 wagons had passed the fort so far that year, mostly on their way to California. The fort accumulated large stores of goods for travelers, with the directive of selling them at a beneficial cost to the emigrants. Specifically, the commander of the fort was authorized to sell goods at cost to emigrants, and in some cases of hardship, to give goods to them for free. In 1850, the fort acquired regular once-a-month mail service with the arrival of a stagecoach route between Independence, Missouri and Salt Lake City. It was the first regular mail service established along the trail.

==Trail Junction==
Fort Kearny&#x27;s location was chosen based on its proximity to the junction of several existing smaller trails, which joined into a single broader route that became known as the Great Platte River Road. At this location, immigrant trains from the Missouri River trail head converged and thousands of overland travelers passed by the fort each year. The Armies two functions included protection and aid to the thousands of emigrants moving westward and to protect the Indian tribes from the migrants and from other tribes. Over time, road ranches grew up nearby. Dobytown became the first settlement providing supplies and entertainment to the emigrants and the soldiers.

** Westport near Kansas City, used by most emigrants.
** Fort Leavenworth
** St. Joseph, Missouri
** Nebraska City became a major freight center during The Mormon War and after the discovery of gold in the Colorado and Montana Territories (1858-1865). Freighters found the Ox-Bow Trail, with more abundant grass and water although longer and prone to having muddy lowlands. This was replaced in 1858 by the &quot;Steam Wagon Road&quot; which was a more direct route and improved after 1862.
** Omaha, along with Florence, Nebraska, which served the Mormon Pioneers from Winter Quarters.

==Role in the Indian Wars==
The early years of the fort were relatively peaceful. After 1854, and the creation of the Nebraska Territory by the Kansas–Nebraska Act, the area around the fort in northern Kansas and southern Nebraska increasingly came under the hostile activity of the Cheyenne and Sioux tribes. In the summer of 1864, the irritation of the Native Americans at the encroachment by white settlers culminated in violent attacks on wagon trains along the Platte and the Little Blue River. During this time, soldiers from the fort began escorting wagon trains, and the fort became a center for refugees fleeing from attacks. Earthwork fortifications were constructed at the fort, and the Army ordered the deployment of the First Nebraska Cavalry and the Seventh Iowa Cavalry to the fort. By 1865, the conflict between Native Americans and white settlers had shifted westward away from the area of the fort.

==Later years and abandonment==
The construction of the Union Pacific Railroad across Nebraska starting in 1865 largely marked the end of the need for a fort to protect and supply wagon train emigrants. Following the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, the US Army issued an order for abandonment of the post on May 22, 1871. In 1875, the buildings were torn down and the materials removed to barracks at North Platte and Sidney. The troops of the fort were restationed to Omaha and its stores were relocated to Fort McPherson 70 miles (110 km) to the west. In December 1876, the grounds were given over to the United States Department of the Interior for disbursement to settlements under the Homestead Act. Within several years, little remained of the fort except for cottonwood trees and the 1864 earthwork fortifications.

==Fort Kearny State Historical Park==
In 1928, the Fort Kearny Memorial Association was formed by Nebraska citizens to raise money to purchase and restore part of the grounds. The organization was able to purchase of the original site, which it offered to the State of Nebraska. The State Legislature authorized the purchase, which became final on March 26, 1929. Thus acquired by the State of Nebraska in 1929, part of the original site is now operated as Fort Kearny State Historical Park by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission. The site has been entered on the National Register of Historic Places.

In cooperation with the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission, which operates the current State Historic Park, the Nebraska State Historical Society conducts ongoing archaeological investigations of the grounds. These digs have uncovered and marked the foundations of all major building on the site including headquarters, officers and troops quarters, parade grounds, storage and livestock stockade. A small theatre that shows a 20-minute history of the fort, a museum with collected artifacts and a reconstructed blacksmith shop with period cannons, caissons, tack and other equipment is behind the museum. There is space on the park for RV and trailer parking with some facilities. The park is only open during the summer months. Reenactors fire the authentic cannon every year on 4 July weekend ceremonies.

In June 2010, Governor Dave Heineman signed a Proclamation re-establishing the 2nd Battalion, Nebraska Veteran Cavalry; the unit will be at the Fort on three major holidays, Memorial Day weekend, July 4 weekend, and Labor Day weekend. This historical cavalry unit served at the fort during the Indian Wars, the unit is historically correct in every possible aspect; bugle calls used by the cavalry can be heard at differing times to announce the activities of the troop at the fort.

==Depiction in fiction==
In the novel &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; by Jules Verne, a train in the process of being hijacked by Sioux stops at Fort Kearny to request aid from the troops there. Such an event is somewhat of an anachronism, given that the conflicts with Native Americans had largely shifted away from the area by the time of the completion of the railroad.

The fort is prominently mentioned and described as a stop along the Oregon Trail in 1855 in the novel &quot;Westward Hearts (Homeward on the Oregon Trail Book 1)&quot; by Melody Carlson, 2012 chapter 25.

Fort Kearny also appears in the short-lived television western drama series &quot;The Loner&quot; starring actor Lloyd Bridges. The series, created and written by Rod Serling of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; fame, takes place in the late 1860s and features the fort in an episode titled &quot;Westward the Shoemaker&quot;. The &quot;Westward...&quot; episode concerns an Eastern European Jewish immigrant who seeks a new life in Nebraska Territory as a bootmaker but runs afoul of a card shark.

The fort is mentioned in the introduction to an episode of the TV series Wagon Train, &quot;The Willy Moran Story&quot; as the next destination of the settlers.

The fort is also referenced in the HBO television series Deadwood in episode 5 of the first series as the closest place to find smallpox vaccine.

The fort is mentioned in the 2014 film The Homesman, as the post Tommy Lee Jones character was stationed when a soldier with the US Dragoons.

The fort is a stop in the &quot;Oregon Trail&quot; video game.

The fort is mentioned in the Song &quot;One Black Sheep&quot; by Mat Kearney

The fort is featured in the series &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; where the shows protagonist Cullen Bohannon was imprisoned awaiting execution but was saved by and old ally named Doc.

<text>Benga is a genre of Kenyan popular music. It evolved between the late 1940s and late 1960s, in Kenya&#x27;s capital city of Nairobi. In the 1940s, the African Broadcasting Service in Nairobi aired a steady stream of soukous, South African kwela, Congolese finger-style guitar and various kinds of Cuban dance music that heavily influenced emergence of benga. There were also popular folk songs of Tanzania and Kenya&#x27;s Luo peoples that formed the base on benga creation.

== Luo Benga ==

The Luo of Kenya have long played an eight-string lyre called &quot;nyatiti&quot;, and guitarists from the area sought to imitate the instrument&#x27;s syncopated melodies. In benga, the electric bass guitar is played in a style reminiscent of the nyatiti. As late as the turn of the twentieth century, this bass in nyatiti supported the rhythm essential in transmitting knowledge about society through music. Opondo Owenga of Gem Yala, the grandfather of Odhiambo Siangla, was known for employing music as a means of teaching the history of the Luo. The father of the popular Luo Benga is non-other than The Famous George Ramogi (Omogi Wuod Weta) and CK Jazz. He helped the Benga enthusiasts by recording their Benga music in different labels in the capital city of Nairobi. Dr. Mengo of Victoria Jazz was a protege of George Ramogi.

In 1967, the first major benga band, Shirati Jazz, was formed by Daniel Owino Misiani (22 February 1940 – 17 May 2006). The group launched a string of hits that were East Africa&#x27;s biggest songs throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Shirati Jazz&#x27;s biggest rival was Victoria Jazz, formed in 1972 by Ochieng Nelly Mengo and Collela Mazee. Despite many personnel changes, Victoria Jazz remained popular throughout the 1970s, when the Voice of Kenya radio station pushed an onslaught of East African pop. Victoria C Band of Awino Lawi was one of the splinter group of Victoria Jazz.

1997 saw the death of three prominent Luo Benga artists, Okatch Biggy of &quot;Heka Heka Band&quot;, George Ramogi and Prince Jully. The &quot;Jolly Boys Band&quot; of Prince Jully was taken over by his wife Princess Jully and she has since been a leading female Benga musician.

Another famous benga band Migori Super Stars was formed in the mid-70s and was led by Musa Olwete which later split to form another popular benga band Migori Super Stars C with musicians such as Joseph Ochola (Kasongo Polo Menyo), Onyango Jamba, Ochieng&#x27; Denge denge and others.

More modern benga artists include Kapere Jazz Band and the rootsy Ogwang Lelo Okoth. The new millennium has seen the emergence of Dola Kabarry and Musa Juma. The latter saw his career cut short as he died in 2011. MJ, as he was popularly known to his fans, developed a kind of benga that infused elements of rumba. He was able to mold other musicians such as John Junior, Ogonji, Madanji, and his late brother Omondi Tonny.

Currently, Odhiambo Tusker of Malela Kings Band is considered the superstar of Luo Benga music, with all his music loved by people of all ages.

There are also other benga artists based in other countries other than Kenya, such as the American/Kenyan group Extra Golden.

<doc id="1284267" wikidata="Q302581" url="?curid=1284267" title="Aaron Rodgers">
<text>Aaron Charles Rodgers (born December 2, 1983) is an American professional football quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the California Golden Bears (where he set several career passing records, including lowest single-season and career interception rates), before being selected in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers, spending 18 seasons with the team. He is regarded among the greatest and most talented quarterbacks of all time.

After backing up Brett Favre for the first three years of his NFL career, Rodgers became the Packers&#x27; starting quarterback in 2008. In the 2010 season, he led them to a victory in Super Bowl XLV, earning the Super Bowl MVP. He was named Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 2011, and was voted league MVP by the Associated Press for the 2011, 2014, 2020, and 2021 NFL seasons. Rodgers is the fifth player to win NFL MVP in consecutive seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Favre, Joe Montana and Jim Brown. Rodgers has led the NFL six times in touchdown-to-interception ratio (2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020, 2021); six times in lowest passing interception percentage (2009, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021); four times in passer rating (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021); and four times in touchdown passing percentage (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021); three times in total touchdowns (2011, 2016, 2020); twice in touchdown passes (2016, 2020) and once in yards per attempt (2011) and completion percentage (2020).

Rodgers is first on the NFL&#x27;s all-time regular-season career passer rating list, with a regular-season career passer rating of over 100 (the first to ever have a career rating over 100) while also having had the highest passer rating, the best touchdown-to-interception ratio and the lowest passing interception percentage in NFL history throughout the entire 2010s decade. In the postseason, he is second in both touchdown passes and touchdown-to-interception ratio, fourth in passing yards, and eighth in all-time passer rating. In the regular season, he has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history at 4.34, holds the league&#x27;s lowest career interception percentage at 1.4 percent and the highest single-season passer rating record of 122.5. Rodgers is also a four-time winner of the Best NFL Player ESPY Award.

==Early life==
Rodgers was born on December 2, 1983, in Chico, California, the son of Darla Leigh (née Pittman) and Edward Wesley Rodgers. His father is a Texas-born chiropractor who played football as an offensive lineman for the Chico State Wildcats from 1973 to 1976. Rodgers is of English, Irish and German ancestry. The family moved to Ukiah, California, where he attended Oak Manor Elementary School. Edward Rodgers tossed a football with his sons Luke, Aaron and Jordan Rodgers, and told them not to drink and not to party in college or they would limit themselves in sports like he did. Aaron took this advice to heart. At the age of ten, he was featured on the front page of the &quot;Ukiah Daily Journal&quot; for his top performance at a local basketball free throw competition.

Later, the family moved to Beaverton, Oregon, where Rodgers attended Vose Elementary School and Whitford Middle School, and played baseball in the Raleigh Hills Little League at shortstop, center field and pitcher.

The Rodgers family returned to Chico in 1997, and Aaron attended Pleasant Valley High School, starting for two years at quarterback and garnering 4,421 passing yards. He set single-game records of six touchdowns and 440 all-purpose yards. Rodgers set a single-season school record with 2,466 total yards in 2001. He graduated from Pleasant Valley High School in spring 2002, after scoring 1310 in the SAT and with an A− average.

==College career==
Despite his impressive high school record, Rodgers attracted little interest from programs. In a 2011 interview with &quot;&quot;, he attributed the relative lack of attention in the recruiting process to his unimposing physical stature as a high school player at 5&#x27;10&quot; (1.78 m) and 165 lb (75 kg). Rodgers wanted to attend Florida State and play under head coach Bobby Bowden, but was rejected. He was only offered an opportunity to compete for a scholarship as a walk-on from University of Illinois. He declined the invitation, and considered quitting football to play baseball instead or giving up entirely on the idea of playing in professional sports and attending law school after completing his undergraduate degree.

He was then recruited to play football at Butte College in Oroville, a junior college about 15 miles (25 km) southeast of Chico.

===Butte===
====2002 season====
Rodgers threw 26 touchdowns in his freshman season at Butte, leading the school to a 10–1 record, the NorCal Conference championship, and a national ranking. While there, he was discovered by the California Golden Bears&#x27; head coach Jeff Tedford, who was recruiting Butte tight end Garrett Cross. Tedford was surprised to learn that Rodgers had not been recruited earlier. Because of Rodgers&#x27; good high school scholastic record, he was eligible to transfer to the University of California, Berkeley after one year of junior college instead of the typical two.

===California===
====2003 season====
As a junior college transfer, Rodgers had three years of eligibility at Cal. He was named the starting quarterback in the fifth game of the 2003 season, beating the only team that offered him a opportunity out of high school, Illinois. As a sophomore, he helped lead the Golden Bears to a 7–3 record as a starter.

In his second career start, Rodgers led the team to a 21–7 halftime lead against #3 USC. Due to injury, Rodgers was replaced in the second half by Reggie Robertson. The Bears won in triple overtime, 34–31. Rodgers passed for 394 yards and was named game MVP in the Insight Bowl against Virginia Tech.

In 2003, Rodgers tied the school season record for 300-yard games with five and set a school record for the lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.43%.

====2004 season====
As a junior, Rodgers led Cal to a 10–1 record and top-five ranking at the end of the regular season, with their only loss a 23–17 loss at USC. In that game, Rodgers set a school record for consecutive completed passes with 26 and tied an NCAA record with 23 consecutive passes completed in one game. He set a Cal single-game record for passing completion percentage of 85.3. Rodgers holds the Cal career record for lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.95 percent. Rodgers&#x27; performance set up the Golden Bears at first and goal with 1:47 remaining and a chance for the game-winning touchdown. On the first play of USC&#x27;s goal line stand, Rodgers threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by a second-down sack by Manuel Wright. After a timeout and Rodgers&#x27; incomplete pass on third down, USC stopped Cal&#x27;s run play to win the game. Rodgers commented that it was &quot;frustrating that we couldn&#x27;t get the job done.&quot; Overall, he finished the 2004 season with 2,566 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 66.1% pass completion percentage led the Pac-10. He finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting.

After Texas was picked over Cal for a Rose Bowl berth, the fourth-ranked Bears were awarded a spot in the Holiday Bowl, which they lost to Texas Tech, 45–31. After the season, Rodgers decided to forgo his senior season to enter the 2005 NFL draft.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
===2005 NFL Draft===
Rodgers was expected to be selected early in the 2005 NFL Draft as he had posted impressive numbers as a junior with Cal, throwing for 2,320 yards with a 67.5 completion rate in the regular season. He threw for 24 touchdowns and only eight interceptions in his last college season, impressing many NFL scouts. They commented that he was a &quot;talented strong-armed junior&quot; who &quot;combines arm strength, mechanics and delivery to make all the throws&quot;, but noted that his stats could be inflated due to playing in a quarterback-friendly system and that he would need to adjust to the more elaborate defensive schemes of the NFL.

Before the draft, Rodgers was confident that he would be drafted to the team he supported and grew up near, the San Francisco 49ers, who possessed the No. 1 overall pick in the draft. The 49ers, however, drafted quarterback Alex Smith out of Utah instead, and Rodgers slid all the way down to the 24th overall pick by the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers has said that he experienced much angst and restlessness when waiting to be selected several hours into the draft, as he had expected himself to be selected much sooner. Rodgers&#x27; slip to the 24th selection and the Packers choosing to pick Brett Favre&#x27;s future replacement became one of the biggest stories of the draft, though he was still the second quarterback selected. His drop in the draft was later ranked number one on the NFL Network&#x27;s Top 10 Draft Day Moments. Many teams drafting between the second and 23rd positions had positional needs more pressing than quarterback.

Rodgers is one of six quarterbacks coached by Jeff Tedford to be drafted in the first round of an NFL draft, joining Trent Dilfer, Akili Smith, David Carr, Joey Harrington and Kyle Boller.

===Green Bay Packers===
====Backup years: 2005–2007====
In , Rodgers agreed to a reported five-year, deal that included in guaranteed money and had the potential to pay him as much as if all incentives and escalators were met.

Rodgers spent his rookie season as the Packers&#x27; backup quarterback behind Brett Favre. The Packers were 4–12 at this point and he received his first extended look in the opening preseason game against the San Diego Chargers after replacing Favre. In his first NFL game, Rodgers completed two out of seven passes and was sacked twice. He continued to struggle through the preseason, before ending the preseason by converting two third downs and throwing a touchdown pass to tight end Ben Steele against the Tennessee Titans. Once the regular season began, Rodgers saw very little action that year. He played against the New Orleans Saints in the fourth quarter of a 52–3 victory, and completed his first career pass to fullback Vonta Leach for 0 yards. On Rodgers entered the game against the Baltimore Ravens at the end of the third quarter in a 48–3 loss. He completed eight of 15 passes for 65 yards and an interception.

After the Packers&#x27; losing season, head coach Mike Sherman was fired and replaced by Mike McCarthy. Rodgers was then placed in McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;Quarterback school&quot; for six hours a day several times a week. This focused on working on Rodgers&#x27; motor skills such as hand-eye coordination, finger dexterity, and mechanics. McCarthy also worked on Rodgers&#x27; release point, moving it from right beside the ear hole of his helmet to further below it, to give him a smoother release. When the 2006 preseason began, Rodgers played as the backup in all four games; he completed 22 out 38 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns. Rodgers saw very little action during the 2006 season, but did step in briefly on against the Philadelphia Eagles when Favre left the game due to injury. On Rodgers broke his left foot while playing against the New England Patriots in a 35–0 defeat at home, filling in for an injured Favre, and Rodgers missed the remainder of the 2006 season.

Following the team&#x27;s season-ending victory at Chicago, Favre announced that he would stay with the Packers for the 2007 season, again postponing Rodgers&#x27; hopes of becoming the Packers&#x27; starting quarterback. Prior to the 2007 season, rumors surfaced about a potential trade involving Rodgers in which he would be traded to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Randy Moss. However, Moss was traded to the Patriots during the second day of the 2007 NFL draft, and Rodgers stayed in Green Bay.

Rodgers stepped in when Favre was injured in the second quarter against the Dallas Cowboys on &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; on . Rodgers completed 18 passes for 201 yards, with no interceptions. He also threw his first touchdown pass but was sacked three times. Rodgers brought the team back from a 17-point deficit to a 3-point deficit, but the Cowboys went on to win 37–27.

====2008: Transition to starter====
Favre&#x27;s retirement announcement on opened up the Packers&#x27; starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the 2008 season. Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the New York Jets, which meant that Rodgers would become the starter.

Rodgers quickly proved that he was one of the best quarterbacks in the league by passing for 4,038 yards in his first season as a starter as well as throwing for 28 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions. As of the 2023 season, this still stands as the most interceptions he has thrown in a season. With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–19 at Lambeau Field. This marked the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a regular season game for the Packers. Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and two touchdowns (one passing and one rushing). In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the FedEx Air award winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the Lions.

During the fourth week of the season, Rodgers&#x27; streak of 157 consecutive pass attempts without an interception ended when he was intercepted by Derrick Brooks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The streak was the third-longest in franchise history behind Bart Starr (294) and Brett Favre (163). Rodgers suffered a severe shoulder sprain in the game but continued to start and played well in a win against the Seattle Seahawks two weeks later. Despite early successes, Rodgers had been unable to win a close game during the season despite seven opportunities to do so.

On , Rodgers signed a six-year, contract extension through the 2014 season. In Rodgers&#x27; first full season with the team, the Packers finished with a 6–10 record and missed the playoffs.

====2009====

For the opening game of the 2009 season, Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation. The Packers were trailing at the beginning of the fourth quarter when Rodgers completed a fifty-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings with about a minute remaining in the game to contribute to the 21–15 victory over the Chicago Bears.

Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for , when he passed for 988 yards, completed 74.5 percent of his passes, and recorded a passer rating over 110 for all three games played during the month.

After a 4–4 start to the season and a 38–28 loss to the previously winless Buccaneers, the team began to heat up. Rodgers led the Packers to five straight wins, in which he threw for a total of 1,324 yards, nine touchdowns, and two interceptions. Rodgers and the Packers won two of their last three games, finishing the second half of the season with a 7–1 record and an overall 11–5 record; good enough to secure a wild card playoff berth and clinch the fifth seed in the playoffs.

The Packers set a new franchise record by scoring 461 total points (third in the league), breaking the previous record held by the 1996 Super Bowl team (456). Rodgers became the first quarterback in NFL history ever to throw for 4,000 yards in both of his first two years as a starter. He finished the season fourth in passing yards (4,434), touchdown passes (30), passer rating (103.2), and yards per attempt (8.2) as well as eighth in completion percentage (64.7%), while also coming second among quarterbacks in rushing yards (316). His passing yardage made him second all-time in Packers history, behind only Lynn Dickey&#x27;s all-time single-season record. His passer rating of 103.2 was also third-highest in team history at the time, behind only Bart Starr&#x27;s 105.0 rating in and 104.3 rating in (minimum 150 attempts).
In the Wild Card Round, the Packers played the Arizona Cardinals, the same team they had previously beaten the week before, 33–7. Rodgers and Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner put on a show that later ranked second on NFL Network&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Quarterback Duels&quot;. Rodgers&#x27; first pass was intercepted by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Rodgers settled down after that miscue, however, and finished the game completing 28 of 42 passes for 423 yards, with four touchdown passes all in a second-half comeback. His 423 passing yards are the most by any quarterback in his first playoff game as well as his four touchdown passes and five total touchdowns. Warner shredded the Packers&#x27; second-ranked defense, completing 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards, five touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 154.1. Despite Rodgers&#x27; offensive efforts, the Packers lost the game when he fumbled on a controversial play in overtime. The ball was returned by Karlos Dansby for the winning touchdown in the 51–45 Cardinals victory. It was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history.

Due to his regular season performance, Rodgers earned a trip to his first Pro Bowl as the NFC&#x27;s third quarterback, behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre. However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was replaced due to his participation in Super Bowl XLIV, Rodgers became the NFC&#x27;s starter.

====2010: Super Bowl XLV season====

In 2010, Rodgers led the Packers to a 2–0 start, but then lost three of their next four games, including back-to-back overtime losses. The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers&#x27; record in overtime games to 0–5.

At midseason, Rodgers had already thrown nine interceptions compared to only throwing seven all of the previous season, and was 16th in the league with an 85.3 passer rating. Over the remainder of the regular season, however, his play improved as he threw 16 touchdowns to only two interceptions, completed 71.4% of his passes, and had a passer rating of 122.0.

In , in a 34–16 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Rodgers had 298 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn his first career NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. In , he sustained his second concussion of the season. Backup Matt Flynn was put into the game as Rodgers&#x27; replacement. The Packers lost the game 7–3 to the Lions. Against the Patriots, Rodgers missed the next week&#x27;s regular season start, ending his streak of consecutive starts at 45, which is tied for the second longest in team history.

After their road loss to the Patriots, the Packers found themselves at 8–6 and had to win their final two regular season games to qualify for the playoffs. Rodgers turned around the team&#x27;s performance; they won their final two regular season games, one of them against the New York Giants, where Rodgers completed 25 of 37 passes for 404 yards, with four touchdown passes, and with a passer rating of 139.9. It was his first regular season 400-yard passing game. For his effort against the Giants, he earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2010 season. In the next game, they defeated the Bears by a score of 10–3 in the regular season finale.

Rodgers was named the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Year for his passing performance in the 2010 season.
With a 10–6 record, the Packers entered the playoffs as a Wild Card and the seed. In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the seeded Eagles 21–16. In the Divisional Round, Rodgers completed 31 of 36 pass attempts for 366 yards and four touchdowns in a 48–21 blowout victory over the seeded Atlanta Falcons. It was the most points scored in Packers postseason history. During the contest, Rodgers tied an NFL record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games). Rodgers also set an NFL record by becoming the only quarterback to pass for ten touchdowns combined through three consecutive playoff games. On Rodgers had a 55.4 passer rating as the Packers beat the seed Chicago Bears 21–14 win to capture the NFC Championship.

After winning the NFC Championship, the Packers earned a trip to Super Bowl XLV against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the game, Rodgers completed 24 of 39 pass attempts for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the 31–25 win, and was named Super Bowl MVP for his performance. This would ultimately be his only Super Bowl appearance with the Packers.

From his playoff performance, Rodgers became only the third player in NFL history to pass for over 1,000 yards in a single postseason and also became one of only four quarterbacks to record over 300 yards passing, with at least three touchdown passes, and no interceptions in a Super Bowl. He finished with 1,094 passing yards, nine touchdown passes, two rushing touchdowns, and two interceptions, while completing 68.2% of his passes for a passer rating of 109.8. From this postseason, Rodgers also became the only player to pass for at least 900 yards and rush for at least two touchdowns in a single postseason. He was ranked 11th by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2011.

====2011: First MVP====
Because of the 2011 NFL lockout, the Packers and Rodgers did not schedule unofficial off-season workouts, despite many teams doing so. Rodgers and the Packers quickly quelled any concerns over their readiness by defeating the Saints, who had scheduled off-season workouts, 42–34. He had 312 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. After the game, Rodgers said in the press conference, &quot;I was going to ask myself, what would have happened if we had offseason workouts? I mean, could we have started any faster and scored more points tonight?&quot;

In Week 4, a 49–23 victory over the Denver Broncos, Rodgers had 408 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception and ran for two touchdowns to earn another NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor. In Week 6, a 24–3 victory over the St. Louis Rams, Rodgers converted on a career-high 93-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson. In Week 9, a 45–38 victory over the Chargers, he had 247 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2011 season. Rodgers and the Packers got off to a 13–0 start in 2011, tying the NFC record for most consecutive wins to start a season, but were upset by the Kansas City Chiefs 19–14 in week 15, ending their winning streak at 19 games, the second-longest winning streak in NFL history.

Rodgers finished the season with 4,643 passing yards, 45 touchdown passes, and six interceptions, good for a passer rating of 122.5, which as of 2024 is the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history. His passing yards, touchdown passes, and passer rating set single-season franchise records. In addition to passer rating, Rodgers led the league in touchdown to interception ratio (7.5, fourth-best all-time), touchdowns passing % (9.0%, second highest all-time), and yards per attempt (9.2, fourth-highest all-time since becoming an official stat in 1970), while finishing second in both touchdown passes (45, sixth-highest all-time) and completion percentage (68.3%), as well as fifth in passing yards. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month awards for September, October, and November, and FedEx Air Player of the Week six times (Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13). In week four, against the Denver Broncos, Rodgers became the only quarterback in NFL history to record over 400 passing yards with four touchdown passes, while also rushing for two touchdowns in the same game. He was the winner of the 2011 Galloping gobbler as MVP of the Thanksgiving game between the Packers and the Lions, a 27–15 Green Bay victory, and tied an NFL record for consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes (13).

The Packers became the fifth team in NFL history to finish the regular season with a 15–1 record. Rodgers played in 15 of the 16 games, with the only exception being Week 17 against the Lions, a game in which Rodgers was rested after the club clinched home-field advantage for the playoffs the previous week. In the game, Rodgers assisted backup quarterback Matt Flynn in his stellar 480-yard, six-touchdown performance by helping call some plays. The Packers&#x27; offense set franchise record for points scored in a season with 560, which as of 2016 is the third-most ever behind only the 2007 Patriots and 2013 Broncos.

Rodgers set numerous NFL records in 2011. He recorded a passer rating of over 100.0 in thirteen games during the season, including twelve games in a row (both records), and a passer rating of 110.0 or higher in twelve games, including eleven in a row (also records). Rodgers also won the league&#x27;s MVP award, receiving 48 of the 50 votes (the other two going to Drew Brees). He also finished second, behind Brees, for the AP Offensive Player of the Year award. Rodgers&#x27; 2011 season was later ranked as the third greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013, and was regarded as the most efficient.

The Packers were upset by the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants in the Divisional Round by the score of 37–20. The Packers&#x27; receiving corps dropped six passes in the loss and Rodgers finished the game with 264 passing yards, two touchdown passes, and an interception on his last pass attempt. The 2011 Packers became the only team in NFL history to go 15–1 and not win a playoff game, as well as being the fourth consecutive team to win at least 15 games and not win the Super Bowl. Rodgers was named to the Pro Bowl for his 2011 season to go along with a First-team All-Pro honor. He was voted by his fellow players as the best player in the league on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2012.

====2012====

Rodgers and the Packers started off the season with a 30–22 loss to the 49ers. With the loss, Rodgers lost his bet with the music group Boyz II Men, and had to wear an Alex Smith jersey during the next week of practice. Had the Packers won the game, Boyz II Men would have sung the national anthem during their next home game at Lambeau.

In Week 4, a 28–27 victory over the Saints, Rodgers had 319 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 6, against the undefeated Houston Texans, he tied the franchise record by throwing six touchdown passes, in a 42–24 victory, to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. The Texans had allowed only six total touchdowns passes during the season up to that point. This sparked a five-game winning streak which Rodgers completed 65.7% of his passes for 1,320 yards, 17 touchdowns, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 119.1. During that stretch, Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October. In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 291 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Packers past the Bears, 21–13, making them NFC North champions for the second consecutive year. In the season finale, despite Rodgers going 28 of 40 for 365 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions and a passer rating of 131.8, the Packers lost 37–34 against the Vikings. This ended the Packers&#x27; twelve-game winning streak against NFC North opponents.

The Packers finished with an 11–5 record, first in the NFC North, and clinched the #3-seed in the NFC playoffs. Rodgers led the league for the second straight year in passer rating (108.0) touchdowns passing % (7.1%), and touchdown-to-interception ratio (4.875), while finishing second in touchdown passes (39), third in completion percentage (67.2%), fifth in yards per attempt (7.78), and eighth in passing yards (4,295).

In the playoffs, the Packers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–10 in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 23 of 33 passes to ten different players for 274 yards and a touchdown. They were beaten 45–31 by the 49ers in the Divisional Round. Rodgers completed 26 of 39 passes for 257 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, while also rushing for 28 yards, in the losing effort. He earned his third career Pro Bowl nomination for his performance in the 2012 season. He was ranked sixth by his peers on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2013.

====2013====

On April 26, 2013, the Packers and Rodgers agreed to a 5-year, $110 million contract extension making him the highest paid player in NFL history. The Packers began their 2013 season against the reigning NFC champions, the 49ers, the team that also ended their playoff run the previous season. Rodgers went 21 for 37 in completions, 333 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in the 34–28 loss. The following week, Rodgers had a career-high 480 passing yards to tie the franchise record in the 38–20 home-opener win against the Washington Redskins. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Redskins. His 335 passing yards in the first half set a club record. He also became the first quarterback since Y. A. Tittle in 1962 to throw for at least 480 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions in a game. The following week, Rodgers saw his NFL record of 41 consecutive games without throwing multiple interceptions come to an end in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals by the score of 34–30.

After the loss to the Bengals, the Packers started rolling, winning their next four games. Against the Ravens, the Packers lost two receivers: Randall Cobb and James Jones. Cobb was sidelined with a broken leg and Jones with a sprained PCL. Against the Cleveland Browns, tight end Jermichael Finley was carted off the field with a bruised spinal cord, leaving Rodgers without three of his top four offensive weapons. The next week against the Vikings, Rodgers completed 24 of 29 passes in a 44–31 victory.

At home against the Bears in Week 9, Rodgers was sacked by Shea McClellin. He fractured his left clavicle in the process, and the speculation for his return ranged from a few weeks to an indefinite timetable that became a weekly spectacle of whether or when he might be cleared to play again. Before Rodgers had broken his collarbone, the Packers had won four straight games to climb to the top of the NFC North division with a 5–2 record. With Rodgers injured and unable to play, the Packers went winless over the next five weeks to fall to 5–6–1 on the season.

After rallying in December behind re-acquired backup quarterback Matt Flynn, the Packers had fought their way back to a 7–7–1 record going into the final week of the season. On December 26, Packers head coach Mike McCarthy announced Rodgers would return and start in the season-finale showdown against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field for the NFC North championship. Returning from the injury, Rodgers threw for 318 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the regular season finale against the Bears. Trailing 27–28 with under a minute to go in the game and facing the third 4th down of the drive, a 4th &amp; 8 from the 48-yard line, Rodgers connected with Cobb, who was also returning for his first game since breaking his leg in Week 6, for a 48-yard game-winning touchdown to clinch the NFC North and earn the right to host a home playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers as the fourth seed. Rodgers won the 2013 GMC Never Say Never Award for the come-from-behind, division-winning touchdown pass. Rodgers finished fifth in the league in passer rating (104.9), completion percentage (66.6%), and yards per game (282) while also finishing second in yards per attempt (8.75).

Rodgers led the Packers to the playoffs again, this time with an 8–7–1 record and were up against the team that eliminated them last year in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the 49ers. The Packers lost to the 49ers for the fourth consecutive time, 23–20 on a last second field goal at Lambeau Field, in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers recorded only 177 yards passing, his lowest in a playoff game, and one touchdown pass. He was ranked No. 11 by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2014.

====2014: Second MVP====
The Packers&#x27; 2014 regular season debut came against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks—a game in which they would go on to lose 36–16. In Week 2, the team began the game with a 21–3 deficit against the Jets, but came back and won 31–24. The 18-point comeback marked the biggest comeback in Rodgers&#x27; career. In the third week of the season, the Packers offense was shut down by the Lions&#x27; defense, 19–7. The Packers&#x27; 7 points were the fewest points allowed in a game Rodgers finished; the 223 yards of total Packer offense were the lowest since Rodgers took over at quarterback and his 162 passing yards were also a career low. For the third consecutive season, the Packers were off to a 1–2 start. In those three games, Rodgers threw five touchdowns and one interception combined, with a passer rating of 95.1. Amid widespread concern, Rodgers told the fans and the media, &quot;R-E-L-A-X. Relax. We&#x27;re going to be OK.&quot;

After their loss to the Lions, the Packers went on a four-game win streak, during which, Rodgers threw 13 touchdowns with no interceptions. In Week 4, a 38–17 victory over the Bears, he had 302 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. In Week 6, against the Miami Dolphins, Rodgers led the Packers to a game-winning drive with less than two minutes remaining. He completed a 4th &amp; 10 pass to wide receiver Jordy Nelson and mimicked Dan Marino&#x27;s famous fake spike play by completing a pass to wide receiver Davante Adams to get to within four yards of the endzone later in the drive. Rodgers then completed a touchdown pass to tight end Andrew Quarless to win the game 27–24. This play would later win Rodgers the GMC Never Say Never Moment of the Year Award. In Week 7, a 38–17 victory over the Carolina Panthers, he was 19-of-22 for 255 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.

In a Week 8 loss against the Saints, Rodgers finished 28 of 39 for 418 yards, with one touchdown pass and two interceptions, ending his 212 consecutive attempts without an interception streak—the second longest in team history. In the game, Rodgers injured his hamstring which appeared to have an effect on his play for the remainder of the game.
In Week 10, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers became the second player in NFL history and the first since Daryle Lamonica in 1969 to throw six touchdown passes in the first half. Rodgers finished 18 of 27 for 315 yards and six touchdowns despite only playing one drive in the second half to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Rodgers set multiple records during the game: most touchdown passes of 70 or more yards with 16—breaking the record held by Brett Favre and Peyton Manning, most consecutive touchdown passes without an interception at home—breaking the record also held by Favre and Manning, and became the first quarterback to ever have 10 touchdown passes against the same team in a season. The 55–14 victory tied the Packers&#x27; 55–7 win vs. the Titans in 2009 for the most points scored by a Rodgers-led offense.

In a Week 11 game against the 7–2 Eagles, Rodgers set a record for most consecutive attempts at home without an interception, breaking Tom Brady&#x27;s record of 288 consecutive attempts. In the 53–20 victory, he finished going 22 of 36, with 341 passing yards, three touchdown passes and no interceptions.

The 8–3 Packers met the 9–2 Patriots in Week 13, at Lambeau Field in what was Brady and Rodgers&#x27; first time playing against each other as starters. Rodgers finished going 24 of 38, with 368 passing yards and two passing touchdowns in the 26–21 Packers victory. For his efforts in the month of November, he earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month.

Rodgers suffered a calf injury in Week 16, against the Buccaneers, due to severe dehydration he endured from flu-like symptoms he suffered during the week.

In the Week 17 game against the Lions, Rodgers re-injured his left calf while extending a play and throwing a touchdown pass to Randall Cobb, then was helped off the field, and carted off to the locker room. After missing a series, Rodgers re-entered the game with the score tied 14–14. Despite being less mobile with the injury, Rodgers completed 13 of 15 passes for 129 yards and two scores against the league&#x27;s second-ranked defense. The Packers won 30–20, winning their fourth straight NFC North title. Rodgers finished 17 of 22 for 226 yards, two touchdown passes, no interceptions, a 139.6 passer rating, and a rushing touchdown to earn his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2014 season.

The Packers secured the second seed in the NFC, rewarding them with a playoff bye and a week off which helped Rodgers rest and rehabilitate his injured left calf. In the Divisional Round, the Packers were scheduled to play the 13–4 Cowboys, which marked the first time in NFL playoff history when a team which went undefeated at home (Packers) played against a team which went undefeated away (Cowboys). Rodgers helped secure a 26–21 victory by finishing 24 of 35 for 316 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 125.4 passer rating.

The Packers then traveled to Seattle to face the top-seeded Seahawks in a rematch of the regular season opener. In the NFC Championship Game, the Packers were leading 19–7 with just over five minutes to go, but the home team&#x27;s offense finally woke up and, with the assistance of a crucial Packers special teams gaffe on an onside kick, the Seahawks led 22–19, with 44 seconds remaining. Rodgers quickly drove downfield to set up a tying field goal, only to watch from the sidelines as the Seahawks won the coin toss in overtime and proceeded to score the game-winning touchdown on their first possession. Rodgers was 19-for-34 for 178 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions in the losing effort.

Rodgers finished the regular season first in touchdown-to-interception ratio (7.6), lowest interception percentage (1.0%), second in passer rating (112.2), yards per attempt (8.4), and touchdown passing percentage (7.1%), third in touchdown passes (38), seventh in passing yards (4,381), and ninth in completion percentage (65.6%). He set an NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts (512) at home without an interception, and touchdown passes (41).

Rodgers was voted the AP NFL Most Valuable Player for the 2014 season, receiving 31 votes, and was named NFC Offensive Player of the Year by the Kansas City Committee of 101 and Fed-Ex Air NFL Player of the Year. He was also named to the AP All-Pro team as the first quarterback, receiving 44 votes while runner-up Tony Romo received three. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the 2014 season. He was ranked as the second best player in the league among his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2015.

====2015====

In 2015, Rodgers had a down year by his standards. He threw for a career low 3,821 yards in which he played for at least 15 games, although he had 31 touchdowns to just eight interceptions. Rodgers completed only 60.7 of his passes, averaged only 6.7 yards per attempt and finished with a passer rating of 92.7, all career lows. Pro Bowl wide receiver Jordy Nelson&#x27;s absence due to injury for the season was considered a contributing factor in Rodgers&#x27; statistical drop compared to previous seasons.

In Week 3, a 38–28 victory over the Chiefs, Rodgers had 333 passing yards and five touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. During Week 9 against the Panthers, he finished with 369 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception. The interception came with only 1:47 left in the fourth quarter, and following the interception, Rodgers expressed frustration by throwing down a Microsoft Surface tablet. The Packers ended up losing the game 29–37.

On December 3, 2015, in a Week 13 match-up against the Lions, Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass caught by Richard Rodgers for 61 yards with 0:00 left to beat the Lions 27–23, after the game was extended due to a facemask penalty called on Detroit. The play was quickly dubbed as &quot;The Miracle in Motown.&quot;

The Packers made the playoffs as the fifth seed in the NFC with a 10–6 record. They defeated the Redskins 35–18 on the road in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. Rodgers finished the game with 210 yards and two passing touchdowns. In the Divisional Round against the Cardinals, Rodgers threw a 41-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass to Jeff Janis as time expired to send the game into overtime. However, the Packers lost 26–20 in overtime. Rodgers finished the game 24 for 44 for 261 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl and was ranked as the sixth best player by his peers on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2016.

====2016====
Throughout the first five games of the 2016 season, Rodgers&#x27; struggles from the 2015 season appeared to continue. Through those games, he completed 60.2% of his passes, averaged 6.5 yards per attempt, and posted a passer rating of 88.4—all of which were similar to his 2015 numbers. He also fumbled five times, and lost two. His lackluster performance through those games caused much speculation about the causes of his problems.
In a Week 7 &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot; game against the Bears, Rodgers rebounded by recording a franchise record and career-high 39 completions, breaking Brett Favre&#x27;s previous record of 36 in , also against the Bears. Rodgers recorded 326 passing yards for his first 300-yard passing game since Week 10 of the 2015 season in the 26–10 win. The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, Rodgers recorded a career regular season high of 60 rushing yards, and finished with four touchdown passes and a 125.5 passer rating.

After a Week 11 loss to the Redskins—the Packers&#x27; fourth in a row, putting them at 4–6—Rodgers was optimistic about the remainder of the season, saying, &quot;I feel like we can run the table, I really do.&quot; Despite widespread doubt over the likelihood of such a run, the Packers would go on to finish the season with six straight wins—as Rodgers said they could.

In a Week 12 &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game Rodgers appeared to injure his hamstring on a scrambling play against the Eagles. After the play, Rodgers went into an injury tent on the sideline to get his leg taped up. Rodgers, however, did not miss any snaps in the game and finished 30 out of 39 for 313 yards with no sacks or interceptions. His 300-yard performance was his fourth of the season and the first allowed by the Eagles&#x27; defense all season. The Packers won, 27–13, snapping their four-game losing streak.

In a 38–10 victory over the Seahawks in a Week 14 game, Rodgers and the Packers continued their recent offensive and defensive success. Rodgers finished with 246 passing yards, three touchdown passes and a 150.8 passer rating. The 150.8 passer rating was the best recorded against Seattle&#x27;s defense since head coach Pete Carroll took over in 2010. Rodgers did this despite suffering a calf injury early in the game. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Seahawks.

On December 20, 2016, Rodgers was selected to his third consecutive Pro Bowl and his sixth overall in his career.

During Week 16, Rodgers and Drew Brees tied the NFL record for most seasons with at least 35 touchdown passes with four—a record shared with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. In the game against the Vikings, Rodgers finished 28 of 38 for 347 yards, four touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week. His 300-yard performance was the first allowed by the Vikings&#x27; defense all season. He also set Packer regular season records for most 4,000-yard passing seasons (6), most completions in a season (374), and—with Jordy Nelson—most touchdowns by a quarterback/wide receiver combination with (59). Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.

Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a NFC North title and a playoff berth in 2016. The Packers defeated the Giants in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 25 of 40 passes for 364 yards and four touchdowns in the victory. They defeated the #1-seed Cowboys in the Divisional Round. With the game tied at 31 with only 18 seconds remaining with the ball on their own 32-yard line, Rodgers threw a 36-yard completion to tight end Jared Cook to put the Packers in Mason Crosby&#x27;s field goal range. Crosby converted the 51-yard attempt as time expired to win the game. Overall, Rodgers completed 28 of 43 passes for 355 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the victory. The Packers lost to the Falcons in the NFC Championship in the final game at the Georgia Dome. Rodgers completed 27 of his 45 passing attempts for 287 yards with three touchdowns and an interception in the losing effort.

In 2016, Rodgers finished with 401 completions and 610 attempts (both career highs), a 65.7% completion percentage, 4,428 passing yards, 40 touchdown passes, seven interceptions, a passer rating of 104.2, 369 rushing yards (career-high), and four rushing touchdowns. With his 40 touchdown passes, he led the league in the statistic for the first time in his career and became one of only four quarterbacks to pass for at least 40 touchdowns in multiple seasons. Rodgers also finished fourth in passing yards, completions, attempts, and passer rating. Among quarterbacks, he finished third in rushing yards and fifth in rushing touchdowns. He was ranked sixth by his peers on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2017.

====2017====

In a Week 1 victory over the Seahawks, Rodgers had his 50th career game with at least 300 passing yards. He finished the game with 311, but his streak of 251 consecutive passes without an interception came to an end when defensive tackle Nazair Jones picked him off in the first quarter. In a Week 2 loss of 34–23 to the Falcons, he had 343 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the first game in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. In Week 5, down by 28–31 against the Cowboys with less than two minutes on the clock, Rodgers led a nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in the 35–31 victory, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.

During Week 6 against the Vikings, Rodgers was taken off the field by his coaches and medical personnel after suffering a shoulder injury on a hit from Anthony Barr. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that Rodgers suffered a fractured right collarbone. The next day, on October 16, it was announced that Rodgers would have surgery on his broken collarbone. On October 19, he underwent surgery on his collarbone, and was officially placed on injured reserve the next day. A total of 13 screws were inserted to stabilize his collarbone.

Rodgers returned to practice on December 2, making him eligible to play in the upcoming Week 15 game. On December 12, it was announced that Rodgers was medically cleared by doctors and was set to start the next game against the Panthers. He was officially activated on December 16. As planned, Rodgers returned in Week 15 against the Panthers, where he finished with 290 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Packers lost 24–31. However, on December 19, Rodgers was placed back on injured reserve after the Packers were eliminated from playoff contention. He was ranked No. 10 by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2018.

====2018====
On August 29, 2018, Rodgers signed a four-year extension with the Packers worth $134 million featuring a $57.5 million signing bonus.

During &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot; against the Bears in Week 1, Rodgers left the game with a knee injury but returned in the third quarter. Down by 20 points, Rodgers finished with 286 passing yards and three touchdowns, leading the Packers rally to a 24–23 win. Despite a nagging knee injury, Rodgers had at least 40 pass attempts in each of the next three games. In the last of these, he threw his first interception in 150 attempts. In Week 5, Rodgers passed for 442 yards (the second-best of his career) and three touchdowns, but also two fumbles, in a 31–23 loss to the Lions. In the following game, a 33–30 victory over the 49ers, he had 425 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.

Following the bye-week, despite a continuing knee injury, Rodgers had his third consecutive week with a 100+ quarterback rating, which included 286 yards passing, no interceptions, and a go-ahead 40-yard touchdown pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in a 29–27 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.

In Week 14, against the Falcons, Rodgers set an NFL record by converting his 359th consecutive pass without an interception, breaking Tom Brady&#x27;s previous record. In Week 15, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers threw for 274 yards and an interception in a 24–17 loss. Rodgers&#x27; record streak without an interception ended with 402 pass attempts after he was intercepted by free safety Eddie Jackson. During Week 16 against the Jets, Rodgers finished with 442 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns. Trailing at one point by 15 points, Rodgers and the Packers won 44–38 in overtime. He matched his own feat of achieving at least 400 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns in a single game. The only other time in NFL history that occurred was when Rodgers accomplished it in 2011 against the Denver Broncos.

On December 18, 2018, Rodgers was named to his seventh Pro Bowl. He declined the appearance due to injury and was replaced by Russell Wilson.

In the regular season finale against the Detroit Lions, Rodgers suffered a concussion early in the game and would not return. He was then sent to the hospital to test for concussion symptoms. Because the Packers had already been eliminated from playoff contention, Rodgers answered questions about whether he should be playing, for fear of injury, by saying: &quot;That&#x27;s just not the way I lead, and I&#x27;m super-competitive, and I want to be out there with the guys and I look forward to being out there.&quot; Rodgers was later spotted at the Packers&#x27; facility after the game.

Rodgers finished the season with 372 completions, 597 attempts, 4,442 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, two interceptions and a passer rating of 97.6. His touchdown to interception ratio of 25:2 (12.5) ranks third best all-time (min. 300 attempts). In addition to setting the record for consecutive passes without an interception during the season, Rodgers set NFL records for interception percentage for a season, with only 0.335% of his passes being intercepted, and for the amount of thrown away passes. He was ranked eighth by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2019.

====2019====
Rodgers started the 2019 season with a new head coach in Matt LaFleur following the departure of Mike McCarthy. The Packers offense relied less on Rodgers&#x27; trademark passes and more on heavy formations and play-action throws to take advantage of running back Aaron Jones.

Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a 3–0 start with victories over the Bears, Vikings, and Broncos. In Week 4, against the Eagles on &quot;Thursday Night Football&quot;, he had 422 passing yards and two passing touchdowns, but also threw the game-ending interception as the Packers were handed their first loss of the season by a score of 34–27. In Week 7, against the Raiders, Rodgers posted his first-ever game with a perfect passer rating of 158.3, the first quarterback in team history to do so. He completed 25-of-31 passes for 429 yards and five touchdowns in the 42–24 victory. He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. In Week 17, against the Lions, Rodgers helped lead the team to a 23–20 comeback win. As a result of the victory, the Packers secured a first round bye in the playoffs. Rodgers finished the 2019 season with 4,002 passing yards, 26 passing touchdowns, and four interceptions.

In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Seahawks, Rodgers completed 16 passes on 27 attempts and threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns during the 28–23 win. In the NFC Championship Game against the 49ers, Rodgers completed 31 passes on 39 attempts and threw for 326 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw two interceptions, including one to Richard Sherman in the final two minutes of the game as the Packers lost 37–20. The loss marked Rodgers&#x27; third consecutive NFC Championship loss (a streak that would extend to four the following season). He was ranked 16th by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2020.

====2020: Third MVP====
Prior to a Week 5 bye, Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a four-game winning streak to start the 2020 season. That winning streak would end in Week 6 against the Buccaneers, in which Rodgers threw for 160 yards and two interceptions, including a pick-six (the third of his professional career), during the 38–10 loss. After a 3–2 stretch for the team, Rodgers threw for 211 yards and four touchdowns in a 41–25 victory over the Bears in Week 12. During the game, he became the 11th player in NFL history to eclipse 50,000 career passing yards, achieving the milestone on a 39-yard touchdown pass to tight end Robert Tonyan midway through the third quarter. In Week 13 against the Eagles, Rodgers threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns during the 30–16 win. Rodgers&#x27; third touchdown pass of the game was to wide receiver Davante Adams and it was his 400th career touchdown pass. Rodgers was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance in Week 13. On December 21, 2020, he was selected for the 2021 Pro Bowl. Rodgers was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month for his performance in December after passing for 15 touchdowns and one interception in five victories for the Packers. 
Overall, Rodgers finished the 2020 regular season with 4,299 passing yards, 48 passing touchdowns, and five interceptions. His passing touchdowns total set a new franchise record. He had seven total games with four passing touchdowns. He led the league in numerous statistical categories, including completion percentage, touchdown passes, and passer rating. On January 8, 2021, he made the 2020 All-Pro Team first-team. The Pro Football Writers of America named him the NFL MVP.

The Packers finished with a 13–3 record, won the NFC North, and earned a first-round bye for the NFC playoffs. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Rams, Rodgers threw for 296 yards and two touchdowns and also rushed for another touchdown during the 32–18 win. In the NFC Championship against the Buccaneers, Rodgers threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns, but also threw an interception and was sacked five times while being constantly pressured during the 31–26 loss. Rodgers fell to 1–4 in conference championship games, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to lose four in a row. After the season, he won the AP Most Valuable Player Award as well as the FedEx Air Player of the Year. He was ranked 3rd by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2021.

====2021: Fourth MVP====
Rodgers&#x27; 2021 season had a rough start, as he completed 15 of 28 passes for 133 yards and two interceptions as Green Bay lost 38–3 to the Saints at TIAA Bank Field. He was pulled in the fourth quarter for Jordan Love as his chance of a comeback was all but eliminated. However, Rodgers and the Packers recovered, going on a seven-game winning streak following the loss to New Orleans.

Following a positive test for COVID-19, Rodgers was placed on the COVID-19 reserve list on November 3. He missed 10 days per the league&#x27;s COVID-19 policies for unvaccinated players, including a game against the Chiefs. Despite answering &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m immunized&quot; when asked during the preseason if he had been vaccinated against COVID-19, he had not actually received a vaccination. Instead, he had received homeopathic treatment from his personal doctor. While unvaccinated, he committed multiple violations of NFL COVID-19 protocols for unvaccinated players, including attending parties with teammates while not using PPE and appearing unmasked at multiple postgame press conferences. After a review, he was fined $14,650 for violations of the agreed protocols and his team was fined $300,000.

Rodgers was activated off the reserve/COVID-19 list on November 13, and returned to play the next day against the Seahawks, a game the Packers won 17–0. In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 268 yards and three touchdowns in a 31–30 win over the Ravens, which clinched the NFC North title for the Packers for a third consecutive season and earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. On December 23, 2021, Rodgers was named to his tenth Pro Bowl.

In a Week 16 victory over the Browns, Rodgers threw his 443rd career touchdown pass, passing Brett Favre for the most all-time career touchdown passes in Packers history. For his play in the month of December, Rodgers earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month honors. He finished the 2021 season with 4,115 passing yards, 37 touchdowns, and four interceptions. On January 14, 2022, Rodgers earned his fourth career First-team All-Pro selection.

In the Divisional Round against the 49ers, Rodgers threw for 225 yards, but a poor performance by the special teams unit haunted the Packers, losing 13–10. It was Rodgers&#x27; fourth loss in as many games to the 49ers in the postseason and Rodgers&#x27; second home divisional loss. After the season, Rodgers won the AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award for the second consecutive season and the fourth time overall. Rodgers became the fifth player to win consecutive MVPs and first since Peyton Manning between 2008 and 2009. Rodgers joined Manning as the only players in NFL history to win at least four MVPs. He was ranked third by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2022.

====2022: Final season in Green Bay====
On March 8, Rodgers confirmed that he would return and play for the Packers for the 2022 season after speculations that Rodgers could retire or demand a trade to another team. There were reports that Rodgers and the Packers had agreed to terms on a 4-year, $200 million contract extension that would have made him the highest-paid player in NFL history, but Rodgers denied those reports on Twitter, stating that the numbers on the proposed contract were inaccurate, and that he had yet to sign such a contract. He did confirm, however, that he would return to play his 18th NFL season with the Packers.

On March 16, he officially signed his contract extension. The final terms of the contract was a 3-year contract (which replaced the final year of his existing contract) worth $150.8 million, with $101.5 million guaranteed. The new contract made him the highest paid player in North American sports history on an annual basis, surpassing the NBA&#x27;s Damian Lillard&#x27;s $49 million per annum contract.

In the season opener against the Vikings, Rodgers threw for 195 yards and an interception in the 23–7 loss. In Week 4 against the Patriots, Rodgers threw for 251 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw his fourth career pick-six to Jack Jones in the 27–24 overtime win. In Week 5 at London, Rodgers threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns in an upset loss against the Giants. In Week 8 against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday Night Football, Rodgers threw for 203 yards, two touchdowns and one interception as the Packers lost their fourth consecutive game in the 27–17 defeat. The next week against the Lions, Rodgers threw for 291 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions in the 15–9 loss. It was the first time since Week 15 of the 2017 season that Rodgers threw three interceptions in a game. Rodgers bounced back the following week against the Cowboys, completing 14-of-20 passes for 224 yards and three touchdowns in 31–28 overtime victory. Following a Week 11 loss to the Titans, Rodgers confirmed he has been playing with a broken thumb on his throwing hand he suffered in Week 5. A Week 12 loss to the Eagles left the Packers with a 4–8 record, but the team rallied off four consecutive wins to get to 8–8 before the regular season finale. The Packers finished with an 8–9 record and missed the postseason following a Week 18 loss to the Detroit Lions in a win-and-in scenario for Green Bay. Rodgers finished the 2022 season with 3,695 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, which marked the most for Rodgers in a single season since 2008. He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the &quot;NFL Top 100&quot; Players of 2023.

===New York Jets===
====2023: Achilles injury====
On April 26, 2023, Rodgers was traded to the Jets, along with the Packers&#x27; first and fifth-round selections in the 2023 NFL draft, in exchange for the Jets&#x27; first, second (via Cleveland) and sixth-round selections in the 2023 draft and a conditional second-round selection (which would have converted to a first if Rodgers played 65% of the offensive snaps in 2023, but it did not happen) in the 2024 NFL draft. The move echoed the career path of his predecessor Brett Favre, who similarly spent over fifteen years as quarterback of the Packers before being traded to the Jets. Although Joe Namath granted Rodgers permission to wear his retired No. 12 jersey, Rodgers announced that he would return to wearing the No. 8 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college career with the California Golden Bears. On July 26, 2023, Rodgers took a pay cut and agreed to a reworked contract with the Jets.

Making his Jets debut in Week 1 on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; against the Bills at MetLife Stadium, Rodgers injured his left ankle on just his fourth offensive snap after being sacked by Bills&#x27; defensive end Leonard Floyd. Rodgers was helped off the field and later carted to the locker room for further evaluation. Rodgers&#x27; backup Zach Wilson went on to lead the Jets to a 22–16 win in overtime. The next day, Rodgers was diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture and was later placed on injured reserve. Rodgers underwent surgery on September 13, with Dr. Neal ElAttrache placing an internal brace in his left Achilles with the goal of a mid-January return at the earliest. On November 29, the New York Jets opened the 21-day practice window for Rodgers. Limited in practice, Rodgers was cleared for functional activity but not contact. He was activated off injured reserve on December 20, but the Jets announced he would not play again this season after their Week 15 loss to the Dolphins mathematically eliminated them from playoff contention.

====2024====
After playing just four offensive snaps in his first season with the Jets due to an Achilles injury, Rodgers made his return on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in Week 1 to kick off the 2024 campaign. In his highly anticipated return, Rodgers completed 13 of 21 passes for 167 yards, one touchdown and one interception in a 32–19 loss to the defending NFC champion San Francisco 49ers. In the Jets&#x27; home opener against the New England Patriots, Rodgers completed 27 of 35 passes for 281 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets cruised to a 24–3 victory. In Week 5 in London, Rodgers became the ninth quarterback in NFL history to reach 60,000 passing yards but tied his career-high with three interceptions, including a game-sealing pick with under a minute left as the Jets lost 23–17 to the Vikings. Jets head coach Robert Saleh was unexpectedly fired after the London loss, with some analysts perceiving that he did not get along with Rodgers. When asked about it on &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot;, the quarterback firmly denied accusations that he had a role in Saleh&#x27;s termination. 

In Week 6, the Jets&#x27; first game after Saleh’s termination, Rodgers threw for 294 yards and two touchdowns, including a 52-yard Hail Mary pass to Allen Lazard to close out the first half, his fourth career such pass completion. However, another interception on the Jets&#x27; final drive doomed them as they lost 23–20 to the Buffalo Bills. Following the loss, the Jets traded for Davante Adams, with whom Rodgers had previously combined for over 600 receptions and 68 touchdowns during their eight seasons together in Green Bay. However, the Jets continued to struggle, as Rodgers threw two interceptions and led the offense to zero points in the second half of their Week 7 matchup against the Steelers, losing their fourth consecutive game. After a loss to the Patriots, Rodgers helped the Jets snap their five-game losing streak in Week 9 against the Houston Texans, throwing for 179 yards and three touchdowns in the second half after being shutout in the first half as the Jets won 21–13.

In Week 11 against the Colts, Rodgers threw two touchdowns and led the Jets to a season-high in points, but they fell short in a 28–27 loss, dropping to 3–7. During their bye week, it was revealed that Rodgers had been playing through hamstring, knee, and ankle injuries but had refused to get scans done in fear of how severe they would be. Despite this, he remained the starter following the bye week. Entering Week 14, Rodgers held an NFL-record 34-game drought without a 300-yard passing performance, which he broke on December 8 against the Dolphins. Despite recording his first 300-yard game in three years, the Jets fell 32–26 in overtime, eliminating them from playoff contention. On January 5, 2025, Rodgers completed his 500th touchdown pass to Tyler Conklin at MetLife Stadium against the Dolphins, becoming the fifth quarterback in NFL history with 500 touchdown passes. He finished the final game of the season with 274 yards, a season-high four touchdowns, and an interception as the Jets won 32–20, finishing with a record of 5–12. He finished the 2024 season with 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.

On February 13, 2025, the Jets announced their intention to part ways with Rodgers after two seasons. Rodgers is expected to be released with a post-June 1 designation, allowing the Jets to split his salary cap charges ($49 million) over two years. As such, the Jets must keep him on the roster until March 12, the start of the 2025 NFL year.

==Touchdown celebration==
Since becoming a starter in 2008, Rodgers has become known for his unique touchdown celebration, which he and his teammates have dubbed the &quot;Championship Belt.&quot; After a scoring play, Rodgers celebrates by making a motion as if he is putting an invisible championship belt on around his waist. Teammate Greg Jennings said of the celebration: &quot;It&#x27;s just something fun that he does. We get excited when we see it cause we know that he&#x27;s made a play or we&#x27;ve made a play as offense.&quot; The gesture drew the praise of WWE wrestler Triple H and has become common for Green Bay fans to mimic during games. He has also celebrated by doing the shoryuken, a jumping uppercut move from the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series.

== Alternative medicine advocacy ==
Rodgers has been vocal about his use of alternative medicine, and is a proponent of the legalization of psychedelic drugs. He revealed in 2022 that he had previously made offseason trips to Peru, where he consumed ayahuasca.

=== Views on COVID-19 ===
Rodgers is one of the most prominent American athletes to choose not to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus, and was critical of the NFL&#x27;s health and safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic. His stances on the COVID-19 vaccine were criticized by scientists, health officials, and some former players and commentators, due to concerns that Rodgers was spreading vaccine misinformation and potentially was risking the health of his teammates.

During the NFL season, Rodgers frequently appears on &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot;. One such interview in 2021 made headlines after Rodgers made several false and misleading statements about COVID-19, implying that unvaccinated people were not the group most affected by the pandemic and that ivermectin was beneficial for people with COVID-19. These and similar claims led some reporters to describe Rodgers as a conspiracy theorist.

==Political and social commentary ==
Rodgers has voiced support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his presidential campaign of 2024. Kennedy reportedly included Rodgers on his &quot;short list&quot; of possible vice presidential running mates, along with others, including Jesse Ventura and Nicole Shanahan.

On Adam Breneman&#x27;s podcast in 2022, former Packers backup quarterback DeShone Kizer said that Rodgers had expressed interest in 9/11 conspiracy theories at one of the first meetings between the two quarterbacks. Kizer described their discussion of conspiracy theories as &quot;a real thought experiment&quot;. Rodgers has also promoted the Tartarian architecture conspiracy theory.

In a January 2024 appearance on &quot;The Pat McAfee Show&quot;, Rodgers, without evidence, implied that comedian Jimmy Kimmel was an acquaintance of disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and that Kimmel&#x27;s name would possibly appear in soon to be released court documents listing Epstein&#x27;s associates. Kimmel denied the allegations and threatened to sue Rodgers for defamation if he repeated the claim. In a follow-up appearance on McAfee&#x27;s show the following week, Rodgers stated: &quot;I&#x27;m glad that Jimmy is not on the list. I really am. I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s the P-word [pedophile].&quot;

During a February 2024 appearance on the conspiracy-focused &quot;Look Into It&quot; podcast hosted by Eddie Bravo, Rodgers espoused numerous conspiracy theories on medicine, immigration, and John F. Kennedy. His claims included that AIDS and COVID were created by the government for the sake of pharmaceutical industry profits (see also discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories and Operation Denver).

In 2024, CNN reporter Pamela Brown reported that Rodgers had in 2013 shared false conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook massacre, claiming that the attack was an &quot;inside job&quot; perpetrated by the government. CNN simultaneously reported an allegation by an anonymous source that Rodgers had several years prior said &quot;Sandy Hook never happened...All those children never existed. They were all actors.&quot; In response, Rodgers said, &quot;I am not and have never been of the opinion that the events did not take place&quot; but did not say whether he had ever believed the Sandy Hook massacre was an &quot;inside job.&quot;

<doc id="1284285" wikidata="Q7920421" url="?curid=1284285" title="Venture Stores">
<text>Venture Stores, Inc. was a chain of retail stores aimed at the discount department-store market. John Geisse, formerly of Target Stores, and May Department Stores&#x27; executive vice president, Dave Babcock, founded the chain in 1968. Venture Stores expanded to operate over 70 stores with major market share in St. Louis, Chicago, and Kansas City, and expanded across various areas in the United States over a period of nearly 30 years, becoming the largest discount chain in Chicago. In January 1998, Venture Stores entered a Chapter 11 bankruptcy and closed within six months.

==History==
The chain was founded in 1968 when Target founder John F. Geisse went to work for May Department Stores. Under an antitrust settlement reached with the Department of Justice, May was unable to acquire any more retail chains at the time, and the department-store company needed a way to compete against the emerging discount-store chains. When May&#x27;s Dave Babcock learned that Geisse had resigned from Target Stores, he spoke with Geisse about starting a new discount retailer, resulting in the founding of Venture.

The first Venture store opened in Overland, Missouri on January 29, 1970, with a second location in Fairview Heights, Illinois opening on March 24, 1970. In 1976, Geisse retired and left Venture Stores, which had by that time expanded to 20 units.

In 1978, Venture Stores purchased 23 Turn Style locations in the Chicago area from Jewel food stores, and expanded to over 40 locations in the Chicago market area, with many city locations. It was the largest discount chain in Chicago with inner-city locations other than Zayre/Ames. In 1990, Venture separated from May and became a private corporation.

Venture&#x27;s advertising slogan during the 1980s was &quot;Save at Venture, Save With Style&quot;. or &quot;SWS&quot;. In the 1990s, Venture employed two other slogans; the first, tied to a companywide remodeling initiative aimed at making the stores more like Kohl&#x27;s, was &quot;See What&#x27;s New For You!&quot;. At the time Venture closed, its slogan was &quot;See What A Little Money Can Buy&quot;.

==Dining==

As was a common trend in American department stores, many Venture stores offered a dining area inside the store, typically called Cafe Venture. This area sold standard American fare, such as hamburgers and pizza, although one could also get a &quot;hot dog with the ends cut off.&quot; The dining area also contained a second area that sold popcorn, pretzels, and Icee drinks.

==Corporate affairs==
The Venture corporate headquarters were located in O&#x27;Fallon, Missouri.

==Bankruptcy==

By the late 1990s, the chain found that it was unable to compete against other retail chains, such as Kmart, Target, and Wal-Mart. Venture tried to return to its founding principles as an upscale discounter and remodeled most of its 90+ stores. While facing vast competition, Venture made a fatal mistake trying to expand into Texas instead of protecting its core markets. Venture sold the Texas stores to Kmart in 1996 and closed its distribution center in Corsicana, Texas. The company entered chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 20, 1998, and tried to operate with a smaller number of stores. The effort was not successful, and the company announced its closing on April 27, 1998. Liquidation of store inventory continued through July 1998. Most of the former Venture buildings were absorbed into other chains, primarily Kmart (for their new Big Kmart stores at the time), Others were absorbed by Kohl&#x27;s, ShopKo, and Burlington Coat Factory.

<doc id="1284289" wikidata="Q149670" url="?curid=1284289" title="Antiwar.com">
<text>Antiwar.com is an American political website founded in 1995 that describes itself as devoted to non-interventionism and as opposing imperialism and war. It has a right-wing libertarian perspective and is a project of the Randolph Bourne Institute. The website states that it is &quot;fighting the next information war”.

==Stance==
The site&#x27;s first objective, in its own words, &quot;was to fight against intervention in the Balkans under the Clinton presidency.&quot; It says it &quot;applied the same principles to Clinton&#x27;s campaigns in Haiti and Kosovo and bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan.&quot; Antiwar.com opposed the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and generally opposes interventionism, including the US bombing of Serbia and the US occupation of Afghanistan. It has also condemned aggressive military action and other forms of belligerence on the part of other governments, as well as what contributors view as the fiscal and civil liberties consequences of war. 

Wen Stephenson of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; described the site in 1999 as marked by &quot;a decidely right-wing cast of thought.&quot; Its founders described themselves as libertarians, and the two principal co-founders were involved in libertarian Republican politics at the time. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described it in as &quot;libertarian, anti-interventionist&quot; in 2016; James Kirchick in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it a &quot;paleoconservative clearinghouse&quot; in 2018; and Salon.com described in 2021 it as &quot;right-wing&quot;.

The site publishes opinion from a range of perspectives, publishing &quot;critiques of American foreign policy from the far left and the far right,&quot; according to &quot;The New Yorke&quot;r, and featuring writers such as the paleoconservative isolationist Pat Buchanan, right libertarians such as Ron Paul, and left libertarians such as Noam Chomsky, Juan Cole, and Code Pink co-founder Medea Benjamin.

==History==
The site was founded on 24 December 1995 by Justin Raimondo and Eric Garris, as a response to the Bosnian war. It is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation, operating under the auspices of the Randolph Bourne Institute, based in Atherton, California. It was previously affiliated with the Center for Libertarian Studies and functioned before that as an independent, ad-supported website.

In 2006, Google suspended it from its AdSense advertising network, which was then the source of a significant portion of its income, due to its hosting of explicit photos of abuses committed by United States troops at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, categorised by Google as &quot;gore&quot;.

=== Lawsuit against the FBI ===
In 2011, the site discovered it was being monitored by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After their Freedom of Information Act request failed to produce results, they worked with the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California which in May 2013 filed a freedom of the press lawsuit for full FBI records on Antiwar.com, Eric Garris and Justin Raimondo. The documents received in November 2013 indicated that the FBI in San Francisco, and later in Newark, New Jersey, began monitoring the site after Eric Garris passed along to the FBI a threat to hack the Antiwar.com website. The FBI mistakenly took this as an actual threat against its own website and began monitoring Antiwar.com and its editors. Eric Garris demanded the FBI correct its file. In September 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FBI must delete its memo documenting Garris&#x27; First Amendment activities.

In 2013, Eric Garris, Justin Raimondo, and Antiwar.com began a lawsuit against the FBI for incorrectly identifying Garris as a national security &quot;threat,&quot; and conducting an investigation into Antiwar.com as a potential threat. The lawsuit was conducted by the American Civil Liberties Union. The lawsuit stated that the FBI had incorrectly claimed that Garris had threatened to hack the FBI website after Garris reported a threat he received against Antiwar.com. The federal court ordered the FBI to amend their files and issue a correction to Garris. In 2017, the court ordered the FBI to give Antiwar.com access to all the records of the investigation without redaction and to pay $300,000 to the ACLU lawyers. Antiwar.com lost the part of the case that claimed violations of the Privacy Act by the FBI. Antiwar.com and the ACLU appealed the Privacy Act claim and the appeal went to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In 2019, the 9th Circuit three-judge panel unanimously ruled against the FBI and order them to expunge all records from the investigation. Civil Liberties groups like the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation hailed the ruling as a victory for privacy rights of journalists and activists.

== Antiwar News with Dave DeCamp ==
Antiwar News with Dave DeCamp, the current news editor of Antiwar.com, shares daily summaries of the top U.S. foreign policy news stories from a non-interventionist perspective. Dave DeCamp was announced as a runner-up awardee of the 2023 Pierre Sprey Award for Defense Reporting and Analysis for delivering &quot;a comprehensive and essential corrective to the tsunami of slanted misinformation that appears each day in our country&#x27;s mainstream media&quot;.

==Reactions==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Linton Weeks described it &quot;a thoughtful, well-organized site&quot; in 1999. Scott McConnell of &quot;The American Conservative&quot; wrote in 2010 the &quot;New York Press&quot; that Antiwar.com was &quot;strikingly successful&quot; and &quot;could claim more readers than Rupert Murdoch’s &quot;Weekly Standard&quot; once the [Balkan] war began.&quot; When Raimondo died in 2019, Patrick Buchanan said that &quot;In the three decades since [1991], no man in America worked harder or did more to resist the interventionist impulses of the American establishment and the wars they produced than Justin and his Antiwar website.”

David Bernstein included it in 2012 among &quot;far left anti-Israel sites that have ties to the anti-Semitic far-right or are known for playing footsie with anti-Semitism&quot;. Antisemitism scholar David Renton in 2021 gave the website as an example of how &quot;ideas [which] started in the American far right... migrated into British left-wing circles without people having any idea where they began.&quot; Anti-fascist researcher Matthew N. Lyons describes the &quot;paleocon-sponsored&quot; website as an example of left-right alliance.

In 2019, researchers from The Open University found that the crowdsourced MyWOT program labeled Antiwar.com as &quot;trustworthy&quot;, while the OpenSources evaluator tagged the website as &quot;conspiracy, clickbait and bias&quot;.

<text>Charles George Bluhdorn (born Karl Georg Blühdorn; September 20, 1926 – February 19, 1983) was an Austrian-born American industrialist. He built his fortune in auto parts and commodities such as zinc, and following a 1966 acquisition became CEO, chairman and president of the Hollywood movie studio Paramount Pictures. Paramount was a former subsidiary of Gulf and Western Industries, which Bluhdorn purchased in 1956 when it was called the Michigan Plating and Stamping Company.

By 1966, Bluhdorn had grown Gulf and Western to revenues estimated at $182 million (equivalent to $1.881b in 2024); that year it ranked 346th in the Fortune 500 list. The company grew through acquisition, including the takeovers of Stax Records in 1968, Sega in 1969, and Simon &amp; Schuster in 1975. Bluhdorn became known in Hollywood for his intense yet gregarious character. He appointed the reserved Frank Yablans as president of Paramount and the out-spoken Robert Evans as head of production, an uneasy and ill-matched team that eventually oversaw the release of hit films &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; (1974), and &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974). 

He died suddenly in 1983 aged 56.

==Early life==
Details of his upbringing are vague; according to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;: &quot;truth be told, Charlie wasn&#x27;t elucidative about a lot of things, including whether he was Jewish, which he kept Hollywood guessing about by posting a sentry outside the men&#x27;s room door.&quot;

He was born in Vienna, Austria, to an Austrian Jewish mother Rosa Fuchs and father Paul Blühdorn. Per &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Ridgefield (CT)&quot;, he was considered such a &quot;hellion&quot; that his father sent the 11-year-old to an English boarding school for disciplining. At 16, he moved to New York, studying at City College of New York and Columbia University. In 1946, Bluhdorn went to work at the Cotton Exchange, earning $15 a week. Other accounts say that he emigrated to the United States in 1942 and served in the U.S. Army Air Forces.

==Career== 

===Gulf+Western===
In 1956, Bluhdorn acquired Michigan Plating and Stamping, a small auto parts company that eventually grew into Gulf and Western Industries, a conglomerate that ranked 61st in the Fortune 500 by 1981. According to Robert Evans, in 1970 Bluhdorn had told him: &quot;Imagine, twelve years ago I was walking the streets selling typewriters door to door.&quot; Apart from Gulf and Western, Bluhdorn was a director and major shareholder of Bohack, Pueblo Supermarkets, and Ward Foods.
Holdings of Gulf and Western were blue-chip names such as Paramount Pictures, Madison Square Garden, and Simon &amp; Schuster, as well as less glamorous assets such as the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company, Pennsylvania Malleable Iron, and New Jersey Zinc. Paramount was suggested to Bluhdorn by Sumner Redstone and the acquisition was encouraged by Paramount&#x27;s head of publicity, Martin S. Davis. It was during Gulf and Western&#x27;s ownership of Paramount that it went from being number nine at the box office based upon total receipt sales, to number one. After the marketing success of &quot;Love Story&quot; in 1970, Bluhdorn appointed Frank Yablans as president of the studio and Robert Evans as head of production. Together they oversaw the studio in its heyday, releasing such hits as &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;, and &quot;Chinatown&quot;. In 1974, Bluhdorn stepped down as chairman of Paramount and hired Barry Diller as Paramount&#x27;s chairman and CEO.

===Dominican Republic===
Bluhdorn was very aware of the financial potential of the Dominican Republic and invested a significant amount of resources into its social and economic development. He is credited as being the father of the Dominican tourism industry. 

In 1967, Gulf and Western paid $54 million for the South Puerto Rico Sugar Company. Most of the company&#x27;s operations were in the Dominican Republic, where it owned the extensive Central Romana sugar mill in La Romana and of land. Nearly half of the land was used to produce sugar cane and, at the peak of the cane-cutting season, the company employed 19,000 people, making it the country&#x27;s largest private employer as well as the largest taxpayer and landowner. Gulf and Western acquired Consolidated Cigar Corporation in 1968 and later shifted its Canary Island cigar-making operations to La Romana. It also created Corporación Financiera Asociada (Cofinasa), a Dominican finance company. 

In 1969, the Dominican government and Gulf and Western Americas Corporation established an industrial free zone in La Romana. The zone was administered by Gulf and Western America&#x27;s Operadora Zona Franca de La Romana subsidiary.

As Gulf and Western had purchased Paramount in 1966, Bluhdorn had plans to turn the island into a moviemaking mecca. To sell the idea he constantly invited producers, directors, writers and movie stars, to get them to appreciate the natural beauty of the country.

During the 1970s, Gulf and Western developed of the sugar mill&#x27;s land into the Casa de Campo resort. Casa de Campo is home to three internationally renowned golf courses designed by Pete Dye – Teeth of the Dog, Dye Fore, and Links. One of Bluhdorn&#x27;s Dominican friends, Oscar de la Renta, was hired to do interior design for Casa de Campo. De la Renta also licensed his men&#x27;s wear line through Kayser-Roth, a Gulf and Western subsidiary. 

After a meeting between Bluhdorn and Warner Communications CEO Steve Ross in 1976, the New York Cosmos played against Haiti’s Violette AC in Santo Domingo. The soccer game was sponsored by the Central Romana division of Gulf and Western Americas.

In the early 1980s, construction of the Altos de Chavón village was completed. The project (which was financed by Gulf and Western) began in 1976, when a stone mountain had to be blasted for the construction of a nearby road. Bluhdorn had the idea of using the stones to re-create a sixteenth-century style Mediterranean village, similar to some of the architecture found in the historic center of Santo Domingo. The village was designed by former Paramount Pictures set designer Roberto Copa. Bluhdorn&#x27;s daughter, Dominique Bluhdorn, is the current president of the Altos de Chavón Cultural Center Foundation.

==Personal life==
Bluhdorn married Yvette M. LeMarrec, formerly of Paris, in the 1950s. He was a tireless executive who was once dubbed &quot;The Mad Austrian of Wall Street.&quot; He maintained his position as chairman of Gulf and Western Industries until his death. Although he lived in the United States from the age of 16 onward, he was infamous (and widely imitated) for his cement-thick Austro-German accent, which has been lampooned in interviews by former collaborators such as Francis Ford Coppola and Robert Evans.

Bluhdorn was a friend of former president of the Dominican Republic Joaquín Balaguer and former leader of Cuba Fidel Castro. Bluhdorn met Castro at a meeting in Havana, which lasted for around seven hours. According to Michael Eisner in his autobiography, &quot;Work in Progress&quot;, during his first pilgrimage to the Dominican Republic, Bluhdorn proposed an idea he had for a picture: a &quot;Bad News Bears&quot; sequel set in Cuba, in which Castro hits the winning home run (he also proposed a film in which Sitting Bull meets Hitler).

==Death== 
On February 19, 1983, Bluhdorn died aged 56 of a heart attack on his corporate jet while returning home to New York City from his Casa de Campo resort in the Dominican Republic. His private funeral services were held at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in Ridgefield, Connecticut. Among those who attended were friend and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

==Legacy==
In 1983, Donald Gaston established the Charles G. Bluhdorn Prize in Economics at Tufts University in Boston in memory of Bluhdorn. It is awarded annually to an undergraduate majoring in economics who has demonstrated outstanding scholastic ability. 

The Charles G. &amp; Yvette Bluhdorn Charitable Trust was a multi-million dollar charity overseen by their children. Between 2007 and 2013, the fund was spent down, and as of 2019 lists less than $3,000 in assets.

The 1990 film &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; was dedicated to Bluhdorn, &quot;who inspired it.&quot; His tumultuous relationship with Paramount executive Robert Evans was documented in Evans&#x27;s 1994 biographical book &quot;The Kid Stays in the Picture&quot; and in the 2002 film of the same title, as well as the 2022 series &quot;The Offer,&quot; where Bluhdorn is portrayed by Burn Gorman.

<text>Brian E. Dubie (born 9 March 1959) is an American politician who was the 80th lieutenant governor of Vermont from 2003 to 2011. He lost the 2010 election for governor of Vermont by fewer than 5,000 votes. He is a member of the Republican Party. 

He is a captain for American Airlines and a strategic advisor to growing companies. In 2012, he retired from the United States Air Force Reserve with the rank of colonel.

==Education and early career==

Brian Dubie attended public schools in Essex Junction, Vermont. He graduated from Essex Community Educational Center in 1977. He attended the United States Air Force Academy (1977–1980), returning to Vermont to join the Vermont Air National Guard and complete his degree work at the University of Vermont (UVM), where he earned a BS in mechanical engineering in 1982. He was president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers’ UVM chapter.

==Aerospace and aviation==

While a student at UVM, Dubie joined the Vermont Air National Guard. After graduation, he trained with the United States Air Force in the F-4 Phantom II and later the F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter aircraft. He continued to fly in the Air Guard as he began his career in the aerospace industry.

In 1982, Dubie joined Simmons Precision (now Goodrich Aerospace) in Vergennes, Vermont, where he was a project engineer and project manager. He developed fuel systems for military and commercial aircraft. In 1989, he left Simmons to fly for American Airlines, first in the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 aircraft, and currently in the Boeing 737-800. He has logged more than 10,000 hours in commercial aircraft.

As Vermont&#x27;s lieutenant governor, Dubie founded the Vermont Aerospace and Aviation Association (VAAA) in August 2006.

In October 2006, Dubie was elected chair of Aerospace States Association, a national, non-partisan organization of lieutenant governors and governor-appointees from every state, representing the grassroots of American aerospace.

He was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.

==Military==

All told, Brian Dubie logged more than 2,500 hours in military fighter aircraft. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Vermont Air National Guard, serving as instructor pilot, operations support flight commander of the 158th Fighter Wing. In 1998, he left the Air Guard to join the US Air Force Reserve, where he served as an emergency preparedness liaison officer in the National Security Emergency Preparedness Agency. Serving in that role, Dubie earned a Meritorious Service Medal, First Oak Cluster, for his actions at Ground Zero in New York City following the September 11 attacks. In September 2005, he served on the Gulf Coast in the relief effort for victims of Hurricane Katrina. He received the Meritorious Service Medal, Second Oak leaf Cluster, and the Air Force Commendation Medal, First Oak Leaf Cluster, for outstanding achievement at 1st Air Force Hurricane Katrina Operations Center. On June 2, 2012, Dubie retired from the military in a ceremony held at Camp Johnson, the Colchester headquarters of the Vermont National Guard.

==Political career==

Dubie&#x27;s first political experience came as a member of the Essex Junction School Board, in the same school system he had attended and where his children were enrolled. He served as a member from 1995 to 2000, and as chair from 1996 to 2000. His first run for lieutenant governor in 2000 was unsuccessful. He ran again and was elected in 2002, and won re-election by comfortable margins in 2004, 2006 and 2008.

The constitutional responsibilities of Vermont&#x27;s lieutenant governor are to preside over the state senate and to act as governor when the governor is absent from the state or incapacitated.

==2010 gubernatorial election==
On October 1, 2009, Dubie announced his candidacy for Governor of Vermont in 2010 to succeed four-term governor Jim Douglas.
In the general election on November 2, 2010, Dubie received 48% of the votes and Democrat Peter Shumlin 49%. On Wednesday November 3, Dubie indicated that he would not seek a recount, and conceded the election. The Vermont General Assembly (150 House members and 30 senators) selects the winner in contests for governor, lieutenant governor and treasurer when no candidate receives a majority of the vote. On January 6, 2011, the General Assembly elected Shumlin, 145 votes to 28.

==Personal life==

Dubie and his wife Penny have four children: daughters Emily and Casey, and sons Jack and Matt. Dubie&#x27;s brother, Michael Dubie, served as Adjutant General of Vermont and deputy commander of United States Northern Command, attaining the rank of lieutenant general in the United States Air Force before retiring in 2015.

<text>Ripsaw is a style of Mento, which originates from the Turks and Caicos Islands (specifically in the Middle and North Caicos). A very closely related variant, rake-and-scrape, is played in the Bahamas. Its most distinctive characteristic is the use of the common handsaw as the primary instrument, along with various kinds of drums, box guitar, concertina, triangle and accordion.

Ripsaw is a unique fusion of Mento and Burru, which replaces the grater (Instrument) used in traditional Mento with a handsaw (Instrument) to achieve a similar yet more variable sound. The saw is played by scraping an object, usually an old knife blade, along the saw&#x27;s teeth, while bending the saw to produce a different timbre. The sound is similar to a paper being ripped, and is believed to be the origin of the term &quot;ripsaw&quot;.

In the Bahamas, Cat Island is the only place to celebrate rake-and-scrape on a large scale. During June&#x27;s Labour Day celebration, the island holds a Cat Island Rake and Scrape festival.

<text>Rake-and-scrape is the traditional music of The Bahamas, alongside Junkanoo. It combines African musical elements with European musical elements to create a sound comparable to other Caribbean music while remaining distinct.

==History==
===Claims of Turk and Caicos origins===

Although it is claimed that rake-and-scrape was introduced to The Bahamas by Turk and Caicos immigrants in the 1920s, the claim has no evidence. In &quot;Sketches of Nassau&quot;, by Frank Wilson, published in 1864, he, criticizing the accent of the Black population of Nassau, uses this comparison to express his point: &quot;but the melody of the lute can seldom be heard above the gratings of the rasp and saw&quot;.

In the Nassau Times, published on the 6th of April, 1878, an account titled, &quot;Interesting Description of Life and Scenes in the Bahamas&quot;, mentions a band playing music for a couple recently married. He states: &quot;we met the musical instruments going to this feast of love. They consisted in of a tom tom, a hollow log and a pipe&quot;. The hollow log is referencing a scraping instrument similar to the Guiro of Cuba, or a Rasp as mentioned earlier in 1864 by Frank Wilson. The Pipe is referencing the Fife that would carry the melody role.

These two accounts are 19th-century references to rake-and-scrape in The Bahamas.

<doc id="1284303" wikidata="Q5300834" url="?curid=1284303" title="Doug Racine">
<text>Douglas Alan Racine (born October 7, 1952) is an American politician and former Vermont Secretary of Human Services, a former Vermont State Senator and was the 79th lieutenant governor of Vermont from 1997 to 2003. He is a Democrat. Racine was a candidate for the 2010 Democratic nomination for Governor of Vermont. He previously ran for governor in 2002, but lost to Republican Jim Douglas. In an election where no candidate won a majority, Douglas won a 45% plurality, and Racine declined to contest the outcome before the Vermont General Assembly.

==Biography==
Racine is a 1970 graduate of Burlington High School. He graduated with an A.B. in politics from Princeton University in 1974 after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;Changes in Interplay Competition in Vermont.&quot; Racine worked as a legislative assistant for Senator Patrick Leahy. He has long been involved in his family&#x27;s business, the Willie Racine&#x27;s, Inc. Jeep dealership founded by his father, of which he has served as vice president.

Racine served 5 terms in the Vermont Senate (1983–93). He was Chairman of the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee and President Pro Tem of the Senate (1989–93). He was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1996 and served three terms (1997–2003) with Governor Howard Dean.

He was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2002, but lost to Republican Jim Douglas. Because no candidate won a majority, the Vermont General Assembly had to decide. The General Assembly almost always votes for the candidate who received a plurality. Racine did not contest the results, and the legislature chose Douglas.

In 2006, Racine was again elected to the Vermont Senate, representing the Chittenden Senate District. He was re-elected in 2008.

Racine ran for the 2010 Democratic nomination for Governor of Vermont. In the 5-way Democratic primary on August 24, 2010, Racine placed second with 18,079 votes (24.22%) to first-place winner Peter Shumlin&#x27;s 18,276 votes (24.48%). Racine requested a recount, which reaffirmed Shumlin&#x27;s nomination. Shumlin then defeated Republican Lieutenant Governor Brian Dubie in the November 2, 2010 general election.

On November 30, 2010, Gov.-elect Shumlin nominated Racine to be his Secretary of Human Services. On August 12, 2014, Governor Shumlin announced the departure of Racine from the same post.

Prior to becoming an attorney, she worked as a teacher and community organizer, developing after-school programs to help keep kids involved in education and away from drugs and gangs. Madigan also volunteered as a high school teacher in South Africa during apartheid. Madigan later worked as a litigator for the Chicago law firm of Sachnoff &amp; Weaver (now Reed Smith LLP).

==Political career==

In 1998, at the age of 32, Madigan ran for Illinois state senator for the 17th District. She handily beat her primary opponent with 66% of the vote and ran unopposed in the general election. She served in that office from 1998 through 2003. She and Barack Obama served in the Senate together, sat next to each other, and their offices were next to each others. She sat on the judiciary committee.

In 2002, Madigan ran for Attorney General of Illinois and narrowly defeated DuPage County State&#x27;s Attorney Joe Birkett with 50.4% of the vote.

In 2004, Madigan became the first Illinois Attorney General in more than 25 years to personally argue a case before the United States Supreme Court. She successfully argued &quot;Illinois v. Caballes&quot;, where the court reaffirmed the ability of police officers to use specially trained dogs without a search warrant or probable cause to detect the presence of illegal drugs during traffic stops.

Madigan was one of many Illinois politicians with strained relationships with now-convicted former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. (See Rod Blagojevich controversies.) Her father Michael Madigan, Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives previously had a feud with Blagojevich, as highlighted by &quot;TIME&quot; magazine. On December 12, 2008, Madigan attracted national attention after filing a motion with the Supreme Court of Illinois to temporarily remove Governor Rod Blagojevich from office and install Lt. Gov. Pat Quinn. Although that court denied that motion without a hearing, Blagojevich was subsequently impeached and removed from office by the Illinois General Assembly, and Quinn was sworn in as governor. Blagojevich was later convicted in Federal court on 18 counts and sentenced to 14 years&#x27; imprisonment, based on the blatancy of his attempts to use his office for personal gain. Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit and U.S. Supreme Court upheld his convictions, on a subsequent appeal, the 7th Circuit threw out 5 of the convictions in 2015, but Blagojevich was resentenced to the same lengthy term of imprisonment.

In 2006, Madigan won re-election with 72.4% of the vote against Tazewell County State&#x27;s Attorney Stewart &quot;Stu&quot; Umholtz.

In 2008, Madigan was considered a potential candidate for Governor of Illinois or the United States Senate. However, on July 8, 2009, Madigan announced she was running for reelection as Illinois Attorney General instead of seeking higher office in 2010. Although she was also considered a possible replacement for Barack Obama&#x27;s Senate seat following his victory in the 2008 presidential election, Madigan described her chances of being appointed as &quot;less than zero.&quot; Instead, Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich appointed Roland Burris to fill that term, which appointment gave rise to the Blagojevich Senate appointment scandal and ultimately led to his federal convictions. Many speculated Madigan was &quot;Senate Candidate #2&quot; in the complaint against Blagojevich, although no wrongdoing on her part was implied.

She was widely believed to have the ambition to pursue a higher political office. In 2008 &quot;The New York Times&quot; named her among the seventeen most likely women to become the first female President of the United States. However, on July 15, 2013, Madigan, who was widely expected to run for governor of Illinois in 2014, announced she would not run because of her father&#x27;s decision to stay in his post as speaker of the Illinois House. Instead, she ran for reelection as state attorney general and won.

On September 15, 2017, Madigan announced she would not seek reelection in 2018.

In September 2019, Lisa Madigan joined Kirkland &amp; Ellis as litigation partner.

==Awards and honors==
*2005, received the John F. Kennedy &quot;New Frontier Award,&quot; presented to &quot;exceptional young Americans under the age of 40 whose contributions in elective office, community service or advocacy demonstrate the impact and value of public service in the spirit of John F. Kennedy.&quot;

==Personal life==
Madigan was born Lisa Murray. She changed her name when she was 18 and was formally adopted in her 20s by Michael Madigan. Madigan is married to cartoonist Pat Byrnes, and they have two daughters.

<doc id="1284310" wikidata="Q16194018" url="?curid=1284310" title="Mike Cox (American politician)">
<text>Michael Anthony Cox (born December 30, 1961) is an American attorney and politician who served as Michigan&#x27;s 52nd Attorney General from 2003 to 2011. He was the first Republican to hold that office since Frank Millard in 1955. Cox took office in 2003 and won re-election in 2006. Jennifer Granholm, who went on to become the Governor of Michigan, preceded him in office.

Cox lost the Republican gubernatorial primary election August 3, 2010, coming in third behind Rick Snyder and Pete Hoekstra.

==Early life and education==
Born in Detroit, Cox graduated from Detroit Catholic Central High School in 1980. He served in the United States Marine Corps from 1980 to 1983. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 1986 and earned his Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1989. 

== Career ==
He worked for the Oakland County Prosecutors&#x27; office from 1989 to 1990, then the Wayne County office from 1990 to 2002, before being elected attorney general. Cox successfully ran for re-election in 2006, after receiving the Republican party nomination at the August Michigan Republican Party Convention. Cox left office in 2010 due to term limit requirements ironically pushed for by predecessor Republicans when a Democrat was in office. In 2011 he joined the prominent Detroit law firm, Dykema Gosset. Cox recently left Dykema Gosset to start The Mike Cox Law Firm.

===Attorney General of Michigan===
As attorney general, Cox took a prominent role in taking on Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM). Cox has opposed BCBSM supported bills and challenged BCBSM in court for the alleged transfer of nonprofit funds to purchase a for-profit company.

In 2003, Cox created a cold case unit to investigate and prosecute cold cases. Cox&#x27;s team has had notable convictions including Coral Watts, Gary Leiterman, John Rodney McRae, two brothers who killed two Oakland County hunters, two people who killed Christopher Brown, six people who murdered Janet Chandler in 1979, and most recently, Timothy Dawson who was convicted of killing his wife.

====Internet Predator Unit====
After Cox became Attorney General in 2003, he restructured the Child and Public Protection Unit to focus on aggressively protecting children from adults who would attempt to prey on young children over the internet. Cox&#x27;s unit would identify those adults who would interact with children inappropriately and arrested more than 250 adults having one of the most successful units in the nation.

In 2006, the unit arrested Detroit consultant Ken Gourlay after Cox read a story in &quot;The New York Times&quot; depicting the abuse of Mr. Berry in the underground world of child pornography. In the story, Cox read that Mr. Berry was a Michigan resident and asked his team to investigate. Attorney General investigators found hundreds of computers with thousands of pornographic images in Gourlay&#x27;s possession. Eventually, Gourlay was convicted of several charges including enticing a child to engage in sexually abusive activity and was sentenced to six years by circuit court judge Archie Brown in 2007.

====Detroit Mayor&#x27;s mansion party====
Cox played a role in aftermath of a party at Manoogian Mansion, then the residence of Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick. Strippers were alleged to have been present at the party and allegedly assaulted; one dancer was murdered shortly after. Citing no evidence, no proof, and no witnesses, Cox declined to offer a subpoena, effectively closing an investigation by the State of Michigan into allegations of the &quot;wild party.&quot; The Michigan State Police continued its own separate investigation.

Cox interviewed the Mayor with his chief criminal prosecutor. The police noted that Cox insisted on interviewing the former mayor alone without Michigan State Police officers present, because there were allegations of media leaks. State police officers have testified that they had strong leads that needed to be followed regarding the Manoogian Mansion party, that the state police believed that the Detroit Police Department was destroying evidence in the case, but &quot;because of actions by Attorney General Mike Cox, they were powerless to stop them.&quot; A state police memo indicated that they had wanted to interview the mayor and the mayor&#x27;s wife, but because the attorney general had &quot;shut down&quot; the investigation, the state police could not get subpoenas, medical records or the cooperation of witnesses. In response, Cox said that he closed the investigation after interviewing more than 130 people who stated the party never took place, and called the accusations against him &quot;absolute bullshit&quot;. Cox explained that the focus of his investigation was whether Kilpatrick&#x27;s bodyguards were being paid illegal overtime to work the party. Cox also said that the police could have &quot;went&quot; to Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy if they wanted subpoenas. Cox stated that he closed the investigation without interviewing the alleged perpetrator of the assault because the allegations only involved a misdemeanor and the state police did not need to interview the alleged perpetrator. In addition, Cox said that newspaper reporters did not find evidence that the police did not find.

Seven years after the investigation, the party has not been proven to have occurred. However, after Cox ended the investigation, a records clerk at the police department has claimed that she saw a police report of an assault at the Manoogian Mansion. The chief of police from a nearby city alleged that he was invited to the party. A witness at a hospital claimed that an assault victim arrived for treatment with what appeared to be the then-mayor&#x27;s security detail, and the witness was told by a co-worker that the victim had been beaten by the mayor&#x27;s wife.
A 9-1-1 dispatcher has also given testimony under oath in a civil deposition about officers who were dispatched to the Mansion regarding a disturbance. She said she was told by responding officers that Cox was present at the party. Mike Cox denied the accusation in a TV interview. More recently, a woman who alleges that she also danced at the Manogian Mansion party has come forward and has sworn under oath that not only did the party happen, but that she witnessed an assault by the former mayor&#x27;s wife on Tamara Greene at the party. She also has alleged that several Detroit police officers were guests at the party.

==== Civil Rights ====
Mike Cox was one of the few elected officials to support the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative which was a constitutional amendment to ban racial and gender preferences for state institutions in 2006.

In February 2003, Cox refused then-Governor Granholm&#x27;s request for the State of Michigan to provide an amicus brief in support of the University of Michigan&#x27;s admissions policies which allowed racial preferences. After Cox&#x27;s refusal, then-Governor Granholm submitted a brief in her capacity as Governor supporting the University&#x27;s position, not on behalf of the State of Michigan.

The Michigan Civil Rights Initiative was passed by Michigan voters with a margin of 58%-42% in 2006 according to the Michigan Secretary of State. After passage, the group By Any Means Necessary challenged the constitutionality of the amendment in federal court to prevent implementation. As Attorney General, Cox immediately defended the constitutionality of the amendment and vigorously defended the amendment until his term ended in December 2010.

In October 2013, the Department of Attorney General argued the defense of MCRI in the U.S. Supreme Court. On April 22, 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the State in &quot;Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action.&quot;

====Adultery law====
Cox received nationwide press in 2007 when the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that adultery could be prosecuted as first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a resulting life in prison sentence. This unanimous decision was reached as a result of an appeal sought by Cox&#x27;s office on a drug case that touched in part on this strange loophole in the law. In November 2005, Cox himself admitted to committing adultery while accusing Oakland County lawyer Geoffrey Fieger of blackmail, claiming that he threatened to reveal the affair if Cox did not drop an investigation into Fieger&#x27;s campaign finance violations. Cox said his personal conduct was &quot;inexcusable&quot; and had reconciled with his wife.

Pursuant to MCL 750.31, however, only Cox himself, his wife, or parties to the marriage (if any) of the co-adulterer or adulterers with whom he committed felonies may pursue a complaint for prosecution of felony adultery. Cox did not recuse himself from the decision to file a complaint for prosecution of his adultery notwithstanding the apparent conflict of interest.

====Health care====
Cox joined nineteen other state attorneys general, all but one being Republican, in challenging the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act after its passage. Critics contended that this action was a political move because Cox was running for governor. Timothy Stoltzfus Jost, a professor of law at the Washington and Lee University, has criticized this unusual move as being not only &quot;frivolous&quot; but a waste of taxpayers&#x27; dollars.

====Same-sex marriage====
In April 2013, Cox became one of the first high-profile Republicans in Michigan to support same-sex marriage. Cox urged the legislature to overturn the 2004 constitutional amendment banning gay marriage and civil unions. Cox said his views &quot;evolved&quot;, and went on to say &quot;Usually, I hate it when politicians say their views have evolved, but I guess mine have,&quot; Cox said. &quot;Part of it is I&#x27;ve just become more libertarian. I still think of myself as a social conservative.&quot;

===2010 campaign for governor===

Cox filed paperwork to explore a bid for governor in 2008, and was the first person to form an exploratory committee. The Republican nominee in 2006, Dick DeVos, announced in November 2008 that he was not going to seek the GOP nomination in 2010. In March 2009, the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; reported that Cox led the likely Democratic challenger at the time, Lt. Governor John D. Cherry, by 41-34%. Cherry later decided not to run.

On May 27, 2009, Cox formally announced his candidacy for governor on Facebook and Twitter.

Local and national polling indicated in March 2010 that Cox was one of the front-runners for the Republican nomination, potentially defeating his potential Democratic opponents in the 2010 gubernatorial election by comfortable margins in hypothetical match-ups.

Cox finished third in the Republican gubernatorial primary, behind businessman Rick Snyder and Congressman Pete Hoekstra.

<text>Johnson&#x27;s algorithm is a way to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in an edge-weighted directed graph. It allows some of the edge weights to be negative numbers, but no negative-weight cycles may exist. It works by using the Bellman–Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of the input graph that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm to be used on the transformed graph. It is named after Donald B. Johnson, who first published the technique in 1977.

A similar reweighting technique is also used in a version of the successive shortest paths algorithm for the minimum cost flow problem due to Edmonds and Karp, as well as in Suurballe&#x27;s algorithm for finding two disjoint paths of minimum total length between the same two vertices in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

==Algorithm description==
Johnson&#x27;s algorithm consists of the following steps:
#First, a new node is added to the graph, connected by zero-weight edges to each of the other nodes.
#Second, the Bellman–Ford algorithm is used, starting from the new vertex , to find for each vertex the minimum weight of a path from to . If this step detects a negative cycle, the algorithm is terminated.
#Next the edges of the original graph are reweighted using the values computed by the Bellman–Ford algorithm: an edge from to , having length , is given the new length .
#Finally, is removed, and Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm is used to find the shortest paths from each node to every other vertex in the reweighted graph. The distance in the original graph is then computed for each distance (, ), by adding to the distance returned by Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm.

==Example==
The first three stages of Johnson&#x27;s algorithm are depicted in the illustration below.

The graph on the left of the illustration has two negative edges, but no negative cycles. The center graph shows the new vertex , a shortest path tree as computed by the Bellman–Ford algorithm with as starting vertex, and the values computed at each other node as the length of the shortest path from to that node. Note that these values are all non-positive, because has a length-zero edge to each vertex and the shortest path can be no longer than that edge. On the right is shown the reweighted graph, formed by replacing each edge weight by . In this reweighted graph, all edge weights are non-negative, but the shortest path between any two nodes uses the same sequence of edges as the shortest path between the same two nodes in the original graph. The algorithm concludes by applying Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm to each of the four starting nodes in the reweighted graph.

==Correctness==
In the reweighted graph, all paths between a pair and of nodes have the same quantity added to them. The previous statement can be proven as follows: Let be an path. Its weight W in the reweighted graph is given by the following expression:

formula_1

Every formula_2 is cancelled by formula_3 in the previous bracketed expression; therefore, we are left with the following expression for &quot;W&quot;:

formula_4

The bracketed expression is the weight of &quot;p&quot; in the original weighting.

Since the reweighting adds the same amount to the weight of every path, a path is a shortest path in the original weighting if and only if it is a shortest path after reweighting. The weight of edges that belong to a shortest path from &quot;q&quot; to any node is zero, and therefore the lengths of the shortest paths from &quot;q&quot; to every node become zero in the reweighted graph; however, they still remain shortest paths. Therefore, there can be no negative edges: if edge &quot;uv&quot; had a negative weight after the reweighting, then the zero-length path from &quot;q&quot; to &quot;u&quot; together with this edge would form a negative-length path from &quot;q&quot; to &quot;v&quot;, contradicting the fact that all vertices have zero distance from &quot;q&quot;. The non-existence of negative edges ensures the optimality of the paths found by Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm. The distances in the original graph may be calculated from the distances calculated by Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm in the reweighted graph by reversing the reweighting transformation.

==Analysis==
The time complexity of this algorithm, using Fibonacci heaps in the implementation of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm, is formula_5: the algorithm uses formula_6 time for the Bellman–Ford stage of the algorithm, and formula_7 for each of the formula_8 instantiations of Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm. Thus, when the graph is sparse, the total time can be faster than the Floyd–Warshall algorithm, which solves the same problem in time formula_9.

<text>Terri Lynn Land (born June 30, 1958) is an American politician who served as the 41st Michigan Secretary of State from 2003 to 2011. A member of the Republican Party, Land was elected to the Republican National Committee in 2012. She was the Republican nominee for the 2014 United States Senate race in Michigan, losing in the general election to Democrat Gary Peters. Land currently serves on the Board of Governors of Wayne State University.

== Early life and education ==
Land was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan. She grew up in Grandville, Michigan, graduating from Grandville High School, and attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, where she received a Bachelor of Arts in political science. In 2009, Land was awarded an honorary doctorate degree from Davenport University.

== Politics ==

=== Early political career ===
In 1980, Land joined the Grandville Planning Commission. At age 23, Land ran for the Michigan House of Representatives, unsuccessfully challenging incumbent Democrat Jelt Sietsema. From 1992 to 2000, she was the elected Clerk of Kent County, Michigan&#x27;s fourth-largest county. In 2000, with Governor John Engler&#x27;s encouragement, Land ran unsuccessfully for the Michigan State Board of Education.

=== Michigan Secretary of State ===
In 2002, Land became Michigan&#x27;s 41st Secretary of State, defeating Detroit-based attorney Melvin Hollowell 55%-43%, and took office on January 1, 2003. She and her husband contributed more than $1.9 million of their own money to her 2002 and 2006 Secretary of State campaigns.

The &quot;Grand Rapids Press&quot; editorial board praised Land for her technological transformation of state services, including updates to computer systems; expansion of Web services; consolidation of branch offices and &quot;expanded hours in new, larger locations&quot;; and changes that for the first time allowed Michigan customers to pay fees with credit cards and renew license plate registrations through self-service stations. The &quot;Press&quot; editorial board wrote that, over the opposition of some Republicans, Land &quot;advocated measures that would expand participation at the polls, including early voting, no-reason absentee voting and early registration for young voters.&quot;

In 2005, Land&#x27;s office announced an effort to use the Help America Vote Act to reduce potential voter fraud by removing names of voters who had died, moved out of Michigan, or changed their names. A &quot;New York Times&quot; investigation found that 33,000 people were removed from the rolls, while Land&#x27;s office said 11,000 voters were removed. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the removal of voter names. The &quot;Times&quot; pointed out that similar problems were seen in other states, as &quot;Republican and Democratic election officials ... struggled to interpret new federal laws, such as the Help America Vote Act.&quot; In October 2008, a federal judge ruled that the national Voting Rights Act had been violated and six states, including Michigan, were ordered to stop removing names from voter rolls. A spokesperson for Land&#x27;s office told the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, &quot;If you&#x27;re eligible to vote, you will be able to cast a vote on Election Day&quot;.

In 2006, Land was reelected, defeating Macomb County Clerk Carmella Sabaugh, 56%-42%. After serving two terms, the maximum allowed in the state, she was succeeded by Republican Ruth Johnson.

=== 2010 gubernatorial race ===
After exploring a bid for Michigan governor in 2010, Land decided not to run in June 2009, instead endorsing Mike Bouchard. She ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket with Bouchard the following year, but lost in the Republican primary.

=== 2014 U.S. Senate election ===

On June 3, 2013 Land announced her candidacy for the United States Senate in 2014. She ran unopposed in the primary and faced Democratic congressman Gary Peters in the general election.

According to an early analysis by the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, the U.S. Senate election in Michigan was considered one of the top 10 Senate races of 2014. Land outraised Peters throughout the campaign. Her largest independent backer was Americans for Prosperity, which spent $3.6 million in support of her candidacy.

In 2014, Land gave $3 million to her own campaign, saying, &quot;You can&#x27;t ask other people to invest in you if you don&#x27;t invest in yourself.&quot; In her federal financial disclosure form, she had not listed any bank accounts or other assets in her control worth that much. Her campaign said that it had mistakenly failed to disclose a joint account she had with her husband. A &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; review of financial disclosure forms showed Land and her husband had assets worth $35 million in 2014, with $1.5 million belonging to Land, and that &quot;candidates may typically tap liberally into joint accounts with their spouses.&quot;

In May 2014, Land gave a speech at the Mackinac Policy Conference, a three-day event that many of the state&#x27;s top business and civic leaders attend, which she read from notes. Following her speech, Land was swarmed by reporters and, unable to articulate a response to a question, pushed their microphones away, saying, &quot;I can&#x27;t do this.&quot;

Land was endorsed by the entire Michigan Republican delegation, as well as former congressman Pete Hoekstra, and the Family Research Council.

Her campaign was weighed down by various missteps and her reluctance to make public campaign appearances, particularly after the event in May. Peters opened up a consistent lead in the polls beginning in September. The Republican establishment effectively gave up on Land&#x27;s campaign the following month. In the November 4 general election, Land received 41.3% of the vote to Peters&#x27;s 54.6%.

=== Voting rights lawsuit ===

In September 2020, Land filed a lawsuit against Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson for allowing votes postmarked before Election Day to be counted after Election Day.

=== 2020 Wayne State University Board of Governors election ===

In September 2020, the Michigan Republican Party was required by law to withdraw its nomination of Diane Dunaskiss for the Wayne State University Board of Governors due to Dunaskiss&#x27;s failure to pay a 2018 campaign fee. In an emergency state committee session, Land replaced Dunaskiss as the party&#x27;s nominee. On November 3, 2020, Land was elected to an 8-year term on the board of governors.

2020 Michigan Fake Electors Case

As revealed by documents from the Federal Government retrieved via a FOIA request, Terri Lynn Land was listed as a fake elector for Donald Trump during the 2020 presidential election, but declined to attend, and was replaced by Ken Thompson.

== Personal life ==
Land married Dan Hibma in 1983. They live in Byron Center and have two children. According to financial disclosures, Land and her family have assets worth at least $34 million.

<text>CFGS-DT (channel 34), branded as , is a television station in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, serving the National Capital Region as an affiliate of Noovo. The station is owned by RNC Media, as part of a twinstick with TVA affiliate CHOT-DT (channel 40). The two stations share studios on Rue Jean-Proulx and Rue Buteau in the former city of Hull; CFGS-DT&#x27;s transmitter is located at Camp Fortune in Chelsea, Quebec.

CFGS-DT is the largest Noovo station that is not owned and operated by the network. It is also the second major network affiliate in Canada in a media market that is not owned by its associated network, after CHOT-DT.

==Overview==
It was originally broadcast on UHF channel 49 from its debut on September 7, 1986, until moving to its current over-the-air channel position in 2001. However, prior to changing its listings to national listings only, &quot;TV Guide&quot; always had this station listed as Channel 49.

CFGS&#x27;s operation is considerably smaller than sister station CHOT — the station only airs a 10-minute local newscast weekdays at 5:30 p.m. anchored by Louka Jacques, along with brief news updates in the morning and in the evening. There are only two anchors (one for the morning news update and one for the 5:30 p.m. news). For a brief period in 2006, there was an occasional commentary by former MP Françoise Boivin on stories that made headlines.

==Digital television and high definition==
The analog television shutdown and digital conversion, took place on August 31, 2011, however, CFGS-TV was granted a temporary extension for their analogue broadcasts. CFGS-DT began its digital broadcasts on its current assigned analogue channel, UHF 34 on October 31, 2011.

<text>The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Holdings, Inc. is an American company that provides commercial data, analytics, and insights for businesses. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, the company offers a wide range of products and services for risk and financial analysis, operations and supply, and sales and marketing professionals, as well as research and insights on global business issues. It serves customers in government and industries such as communications, technology, strategic financial services, and retail, telecommunications, and manufacturing markets. Often referred to as D&amp;B, the company&#x27;s database contains over 500 million business records worldwide.

== History ==
===1800s===
Dun &amp; Bradstreet traces its history to July 20, 1841, with formation of The Mercantile Agency in New York City by Lewis Tappan. Recognizing the need for a centralized credit reporting system, Tappan formed the company to create a network of correspondents who would provide reliable, objective credit information to subscribers. As an advocate for civil rights, Tappan used his abolitionist connections to expand and update the company&#x27;s credit information.

Despite accusations of personal privacy invasion, by 1844 the Mercantile Agency had over 280 clients. The agency continued to expand, opening offices in Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. By 1849, Tappan retired, allowing Benjamin Douglass to take over the booming business.

In 1859, Douglass transferred the company to Robert Graham Dun, who immediately changed the firm&#x27;s name to R. G. Dun &amp; Company. Over the next 40 years, Graham Dun continued to expand the business across international boundaries.

===1900s===
In March 1933, R. G. Dun &amp; Company merged with competitor John M. Bradstreet to form today&#x27;s Dun &amp; Bradstreet. The merger was engineered by Dun&#x27;s CEO, Arthur Whiteside. Whiteside&#x27;s successor, J. Wilson Newman, worked to extend the company&#x27;s range of products and services, expanding the company dramatically during the 1960s by engineering ways to apply new technologies to evolving operations. 

Moody&#x27;s, a credit reporting agency, was acquired by Dun &amp; Bradstreet in 1962. The Dun &amp; Bradstreet Data Universal Numbering System (D&amp;B D-U-N-S Number) was invented in 1963. Other companies acquired during this time included R.H. Donnelley, Official Airline Guides, Thomas Y. Crowell Co., Funk &amp; Wagnalls, Technical Publishing, and McCormack &amp; Dodge, all since divested.

In 1986, Dun &amp; Bradstreet acquired the education data company Market Data Retrieval (MDR). That year, Dun &amp; Bradstreet sold Technical Publishing to Cahners Publishing.

In 1996, the company restructured, creating three entities: Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Nielsen, and the Cognizant Corporation. Cognizant Corporation included Nielsen TV Ratings, Gartner Group, Clarke-O&#x27;Neill, Erisco, and several other lesser known entities. In 1999, Cognizant Corporation spun off Nielsen TV Ratings and shortly thereafter divested all its holdings, emerging as IMS Health. IMS Health continued to hold its prize incubator company that is today known as Cognizant Corporation.

On July 1, 1998, Dun &amp; Bradstreet split into two companies, one assuming the Dun &amp; Bradstreet name, while the other adopting the R.H. Donnelley name.

===2000s===
In 2000, Dun &amp; Bradstreet spun off Moody&#x27;s Corporation.

In 2001, Dun &amp; Bradstreet acquired Harris InfoSource International, Inc., a data company. In February 2003, the company acquired Hoover&#x27;s, a business reporting service.

On February 5, 2003, Dun &amp; Bradstreet restated prior period results to correct timing errors in recognizing some of the revenue associated with 14 of the company&#x27;s 200+ products, after reviewing its revenue recognition from 1997 through 2002. In August 2010, Dun &amp; Bradstreet spun off and sold its credit monitoring and management business to a newly formed company, Dun &amp; Bradstreet Credibility Corp. In 2007, Dun &amp; Bradstreet acquired AllBusiness.com and sold the company in 2012.

In October 2013, Bob Carrigan became the CEO of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.

<text>Saïd Taghmaoui (; born 19 July 1973) is a French actor. One of his major screen roles was that of Saïd in the 1995 French film &quot;La Haine&quot;, directed by Mathieu Kassovitz. Taghmaoui has also appeared in a number of English-language films, with roles such as Captain Said in &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999), Breaker in &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot; (2009), Sameer in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017), and The Elder in &quot;John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum&quot; (2019).

==Early life==
Saïd Taghmaoui was born in Villepinte, Seine-Saint-Denis, into a large family comprising eight children; he had four brothers and three sisters.

He has since pursued an international career, appearing in films in Germany, Italy, Morocco and the United States (&quot;Three Kings&quot;, 1999). Taghmaoui starred in &quot;Vantage Point&quot; (2008) as the leader of a terrorist group plotting to kidnap the U.S. president.

<text>Club International is a monthly British adult magazine published by Paul Raymond Publications that features softcore pictures of nude women. It is a sister magazine of the American magazine &quot;Club&quot;. 

==History and profile==
&quot;Club International&quot; was founded in 1972 and is published every four weeks, making thirteen issues per year. Each edition consists of one hundred printed pages and is staple-bound, with the exception of the slightly larger &quot;special edition&quot;, published at the start of each new volume, which has some 120 pages and flat glued binding.

&quot;Club International&quot; is published by Paul Raymond Publications, which publishes eight of the UK&#x27;s ten top adult magazines. Along with &quot;Mayfair&quot; magazine, &quot;Club International&quot; is considered one of Raymond&#x27;s most upmarket top shelf productions, with the photo spreads generally featuring more glamorous photosets shot by experienced photographers.

== Content ==
Each edition of &quot;Club International&quot; features ten photosets, with the exception of the slightly larger &quot;special edition&quot; which features between twelve and thirteen sets. The photosets are usually single-model shoots but there are also lesbian scenes. The shoots are generally softcore, and as such do not feature any sort of penetration or oral-genital contact. However some photoshoots feature the occasional &quot;pink&quot; shot, where a model exposes her vaginal lips. During the early to mid-1980s, a regular feature was &quot;Club Event&quot;, a picture sequence involving a group of models (usually about half a dozen) performing a form of striptease around a central theme such as a Christmas party, or whilst wearing (and removing) various types of uniforms.

=== Models ===
The magazine once offered the British TV newsreader Anna Ford a fee of £75,000 to appear naked in its pages, but she declined. It has, however, featured a number of well-known models and pornstars, such as Lexi Lowe, Tanya Tate, Monica Sweet, Zsanett Égerházi, Sandra Shine, Peaches, Silvia Saint, Stephanie Swift, and popular Hungarian model Sophie Moone (often credited as &#x27;Stella&#x27;). Also among the women featured is the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Girlfriend&quot;, presented as an amateur model who is the girlfriend of a &quot;Club International&quot; reader.

=== Features ===
Long-running features in &quot;Club International&quot; include its regular readers&#x27; letters page, &quot;Talkin&#x27; Blue&quot;, where &#x27;readers&#x27; share tales of their sexual experiences, and &quot;Peaches&quot;, a feature that covers anal sex (although the writing is far more explicit than the images that accompany the feature). As with a number of similar men&#x27;s magazines, there are the regular automotive features, editorials, video and book reviews, as well as a jokes page. Starting in 2008, a free DVD has been included with every issue.

===Online edition ===
&quot;Club International&quot; is also sold in digital format. Initially this was via the Paul Raymond digital newsstand from 2013 until that website closed. Subsequently it has been available digitally from the publisher&#x27;s main website.

<doc id="1284321" wikidata="Q1516701" url="?curid=1284321" title="Chinese immigration to Hawaii">
<text>The Chinese in Hawaii constitute about 4.7% of the state&#x27;s population, most of whom (75%) are Cantonese people with ancestors from Zhongshan in Guangdong. This number does not include people of mixed Chinese and Hawaiian descent. If all people with Chinese ancestry in Hawaii (including the Chinese-Hawaiians) are included, they form about 1/3 of Hawaii&#x27;s entire population. As United States citizens, they are a group of Chinese Americans. A minority of this group have Hakka ancestry.

== History ==
Historical records indicated that the earliest presence of Chinese in Hawaii dates back to the late 18th century: a few sailors in 1778 with Captain James Cook&#x27;s journey, more in 1788 with John Meares, and some in 1789 with American trader Simon Metcalfe, who reached Maui from Macau. Visiting the Sandwich Islands in 1794, Captain George Vancouver reported seeing one Chinese resident.
Encouraged by King Kamehameha I, Hawaii exported sandalwood to China from 1792 to around 1843. As a result, Chinese people dubbed the Hawaiian Islands &quot;Tan Heung Shan&quot; (), roughly &quot;Fragrant Sandalwood Hills&quot; in Cantonese. Between 1852 and 1899, around 46,000 Chinese immigrated to Hawaii. In 1900, the Chinese population in Hawaii was 25,767. More of these migrants were from Fukien and spoke Fukienese rather than Cantonese. An American missionary observing Maui in 1856 found that the primarily Cantonese shopkeepers and Fukienese laborers communicated in the Hawaiian language.

Although many came as laborers for sugar plantations in Hawaii, they concentrated on getting education for their children. When their contracts expired, many decided to remain in Hawaii and opened businesses in areas such as Chinatown. By 1950 most Chinese American men in Hawaii were educated and held good jobs. Today 95% of Chinese Americans in Hawaii live in Honolulu.

A significant minority of early Chinese immigrants to Hawaii, and even fewer to the Continental US, were Hakka, and much of the animosity between the Hakka and Punti Cantonese people carried over. In the first half of the 1800s, around 30 percent of Chinese in Hawaii were of Hakka, while only about 3 percent in the West Coast were Hakka. The largest surge of immigration in that century occurred after an 1876 treaty between the US and Kingdom of Hawaii led to an increased need for labor.

The majority of marriages between Chinese men and European women in Hawaii were between Cantonese men and Portuguese women. Portuguese and other European women married Chinese men. These unions between Cantonese men and Portuguese women resulted in children of mixed Cantonese-Portuguese parentage, called Cantonese-Portuguese. For two years to June 30, 1933, 38 of these children were born, they were classified as pure Chinese because their fathers were Chinese. A large amount of mingling took place between Chinese and European, Chinese men married Portuguese, Spanish, Hawaiian, Caucasian-Hawaiian, etc. Only one Chinese man was recorded marrying an American woman. Chinese men in Hawaii also married Puerto Rican, Portuguese, Japanese, Greek, and half-white women. There was a communal ban on intermarriages between the two groups for the first generation of migrants. In the middle of the 19th century, Hakka immigrants in America were excluded from membership in the Chinese organizations.

== Religion ==
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries in Hawaii, the early Chinese settlers were adherents of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism. Some even blended aspects of native Hawaiian beliefs into their own belief systems.

Today, due to the work of Christian missionaries in the late 19th century and the 20th century, many of the Chinese in Hawaii are adherents of Protestant and Roman Catholic Christianity. Still, about 100 Buddhist and ancestral temples remain. The minority who adhere to traditional Chinese religions pay pilgrimage to their ancestors annually. However, no accurate statistics of adherents within the Chinese community in Hawaiʻi are available.

<text>Permanent residency is a person&#x27;s legal resident status in a country or territory of which such person is not a citizen but where they have the right to reside on a permanent basis. This is usually for a permanent period; a person with such legal status is known as a permanent resident.

Permanent residency itself is distinct from right of abode, which waives immigration control for such persons. Persons having permanent residency still require immigration control if they do not have right of abode. However, a right of abode automatically grants people permanent residency. This status also gives work permit in most cases. In many Western countries, the status of permanent resident confers a right of abode upon the holder despite not being a citizen of the particular country.

==Nations with permanent residency systems==
Not every nation allows permanent residency. Rights and application may vary widely.

All European Union countries have a facility for someone to become a permanent resident, as EU legislation allows an EU national who moves to another EU country to attain permanent resident status after residing there for five years. The European Union also sets out permanent residency rights for long-term resident third country nationals under directive (2003/109/EC). A novel approach was the granting of rights across the national borders of states adhering to the directive. Permanent residents of European Union states who are citizens of another EU state enjoy extra rights; they can vote in European Parliament (and, in some cases, municipal and regional) elections in their country of residence. As an example, a Romanian citizen who emigrated to France would be able to vote in local and European Parliament elections in France (but not Romania). 

As for Hong Kong and Macau, both special administrative regions of China, they do not have their own citizenship laws, the term &quot;permanent residents&quot; refer to persons with the right of abode in these territories. Most permanent residents of Chinese descent are Chinese citizens according to Chinese nationality law.

Other countries have varying forms of such residency and relationships with other countries with regards to permanent residency.

The countries and territories that have some type of permanent resident status include:

== Non-standard forms of permanent residency ==

=== Former citizens or persons of origin ===
Some countries grant residency and other specific rights to former citizens or persons of origin in the country:

India does not permit dual citizenship, but former Indian citizens, and persons of Indian origin, are eligible to apply for an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card that allows them to live and work freely in India, apart from running for certain political office posts and occupying constitutional posts. They also cannot vote or buy agricultural land. Spouses who have no other connection to India other than being married to someone with or eligible for OCI can also apply for OCI if they have been married for at least two years. Once the marriage is dissolved, OCI status is automatically lost for spouse with no connection to India. In 2016, India allowed Permanent Resident Status to foreigners with some conditions.

Turkey allows dual citizenship, and former Turkish citizens by birth who have given up their Turkish citizenship with permission (for example, because they have naturalized in a country that usually does not permit dual citizenship, such as Austria, Germany, Japan or South Korea) and their descendants subject to certain conditions, can apply for the Blue Card (), which gives most of the citizens&#x27; rights back, e.g. the right to live and work in Turkey, the right to possess land or the right to inherit, but not the right to vote or the right to be employed as a public servant.

=== Treaties ===
Some countries have made treaties regulating travel and access to the job markets (non-government/non-military-related work)

* A citizen of an EU country can live and work indefinitely in other EU countries and in Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland (and citizens of these countries can live and work in EU countries). Permanent residence is acquired automatically after five years of residence.
* The Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement between Australia and New Zealand allows citizens of the two countries to live and work indefinitely in the other country, but the status is distinct from permanent residence in the country and expires each time a holder leaves the country. Despite this, the time a New Zealander spends in Australia on a Special Category Visa may count as permanent residence the purpose of acquiring citizenship.
* A citizen of a Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member state (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) can live and work in other member states.

However, for voting, being voted and working for the public sector or the national security in a country, citizenship of the country concerned is almost always required.

=== Investments ===
A &quot;golden visa&quot; is a permanent residency visa issued to individuals who invest, often through the purchase of property, a certain sum of money into the issuing country. Dating back to the 1980s, golden visas became much more popular and available in the 21st century. Golden visas require investments of anywhere from $100,000 in Dominica up to £2,000,000 in the UK. The most common method for obtaining a golden visa is through the purchase of real estate with a minimum value. Some countries such as Cyprus and Malta also offer &quot;golden passports&quot; to individuals if they invest a certain sum. The issuing of so-called &quot;golden visas&quot; has sparked controversy in several countries.

Since the 1990s, some countries have begun to offer golden passports - which give citizenship as well as residency rights - to foreign nationals who invest (often through the purchase of real estate properties) a certain sum into the issuing country&#x27;s economy. The issuing of EU passports by Cyprus and Malta has sparked controversy but is expected to produce billions of euros in revenue for the issuing countries.

== Limitations of permanent residents ==
Depending on the country, permanent residents usually have the same rights as citizens except for the following:

* They may not vote (though in some cases such as the UK&#x27;s Commonwealth citizens, and in New Zealand voting is allowed. Hong Kong and Macau allow permanent residents to vote regardless of nationality).
* They may not stand for public office (except European Union citizens permanently residing in other EU member states who may stand in local and European elections).
* In most cases, they may not hold public sector employment. Canada and New Zealand allow this; some countries, such as Brazil and Portugal, allow it only for permanent residents holding citizenship of certain countries.
* They may not usually apply for employment involving national security. In Singapore, male PRs who have been granted PR before the age of 18 have to serve national service. Most first-generation males are exempted.
* They may not own certain types of real estate.
* They are not issued the passport of that country (unless otherwise stateless or unable to obtain a passport from their country of nationality, in which case they may be entitled to a certificate of identity instead).
* They do not have access to the country&#x27;s consular protection (some countries such as Australia allow this).
* They may qualify to apply for citizenship after meeting a specified period of residence.

== Obligations of permanent residents ==
Permanent residents may be required to fulfill specific residence obligations to maintain their status. In some cases, permanent residency may be conditional on a certain type of employment or maintenance of a business.

Many countries have compulsory military service for citizens. Some countries, such as Singapore, extend this to permanent residents. However, in Singapore, most first generation permanent residents are exempted, and only their sons are held liable for national service.

In a similar approach, the United States has Selective Service, a compulsory &quot;registration&quot; for military service, which is required of all male citizens and permanent residents ages 18 to 26; this requirement theoretically applies even to those residing in the country illegally. Applications for citizenship may be denied or otherwise impeded if the applicant cannot prove having complied with this requirement.

Permanent residents may be required to reside in the country offering them residence for a given minimum length of time (as in Australia and Canada). Permanent residents may lose their status if they stay outside their host country for more than a specified period of time (as in the United States).

Permanent residents have the same obligations as citizens regarding taxes.

== Loss of status ==

Permanent residents may lose their status if they fail to comply with residency or other obligations imposed on them. For example:

* They leave the country beyond a maximum number of days (varies among countries but usually more than 2 years).
* They become a threat to national security, or they commit serious crimes and become subject to deportation or removal from the country.

== Access to citizenship ==
Usually, permanent residents may apply for citizenship by naturalization after a period of permanent residency (typically five years) in the country concerned. Dual/multiple citizenship may or may not be permitted.

In many nations, an application for naturalization can be denied on character grounds, sometimes allowing people to reside in the country (as non-domiciled) but not become citizens. In the United States, the residency requirements for citizenship are normally five years, even though permanent residents who have been married to a U.S. citizen for three years or more may apply in three years. Those who have served in the armed forces may qualify for an expedited process allowing citizenship after only one year, or even without any residence requirement.

== Automatic entitlement ==
Full permanent residence rights are granted automatically between the following:

* Ireland and the United Kingdom, including general election voting rights.
* The states of the Nordic Council.
* The Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation.
* The Republic of India and the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.
* Brazil grants permanent residence for Argentines and Uruguayans from start (they may choose both temporary or permanent). 
In some cases (e.g. the member states of the European Union), citizens of participating countries can live and work at will in each other&#x27;s states, but don&#x27;t have a status fully equivalent to that of a permanent resident. In particular, under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, Australia and New Zealand grant each other&#x27;s citizens the right to reside permanently and work in each country; however, the rights and entitlements of New Zealanders living in Australia under this arrangement (the so-called Special Category Visa) are somewhat short of those of Australian permanent residents, in particular with respect to unemployment benefits and similar benefits.

==Proof of permanent residency==
People who are granted permanent residency in a country are usually issued some sort of documentary evidence as legal proof of this status. In the past, many countries merely stamped the person&#x27;s passport indicating that the holder was admitted as a permanent resident or that he/she was exempt from immigration control and permitted to work without restriction. Other countries would issue a photo ID card, place a visa sticker or certificate of residence in the person&#x27;s passport, or issue a letter to confirm their permanent resident status.

*In Argentina, the non-citizens are issued an Argentine “DNI”, with the same characteristics for Argentinian citizens, showing back additional data saying the origin country and filling date.
*In Australia and New Zealand, a printout of permanent residence visa or resident visa is stuck to a page of the permanent resident&#x27;s passport (on 1 September 2015, Australia ceased issuing visa labels to holders of Australian visas).
*In Canada, permanent residents are issued a photo ID card known as Permanent Resident Card. They are also given an official document called a Confirmation of Permanent Residence or Record of Landing on the day that permanent resident status is conferred.
*In Costa Rica, permanent residents are issued a photo ID card commonly referred to as a &quot;cedula&quot;.
*In the countries of the European Union, residency permits are a photo ID card following a common EU design.
*In Germany, resident permits &quot;(Aufenthaltstitel)&quot; have been issued as photo ID cards following a common EU design since 1 September 2011. Prior to that date, residence permits were stickers (similar to visas) which were affixed to the resident&#x27;s passport.
*In Ghana, permanent residents are issued an Indefinite Residence permit which is in the form of a sticker attached into the resident&#x27;s passport.
*In Hong Kong, permanent residents are issued a Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card.
*In Japan and South Korea, all resident foreigners are issued a residence card, and for permanent residents this status is indicated.
*In Lithuania, permanent residents are issued a photo ID &quot;(Leidimas gyventi)&quot; following a common EU design.
*In Macao, permanent residents are issued a Macao Permanent Resident Identity Card (&quot;Bilhete de Identidade de Residente Permanente&quot;).
*In Malaysia, permanent residents are issued with a MyPR card similar to the MyKad issued to Malaysian citizens, the difference being the colour (red instead of blue) and additional information stating the cardholder&#x27;s country of origin.
*In the Republic of China (Taiwan), permanent residents are issued a blue photo ID card (APRC). A separate open work permit can also be issued to permanent residents allowing them to accept employment in any non-governmental positions for which they are qualified.
*In Singapore, permanent residents are issued a blue identity card with their photograph, thumb print and other personal particulars similar to citizen&#x27;s pink identity card
*In Slovakia, permanent residents were used to issued a red photo ID. Slovakia has switched to common EU design since 2011.
*In South Africa, permanent residents who have their passport endorsed, are issued a certificate and a standard national green identity book showing &quot;NON S.A. CITIZEN&quot;.
*In Switzerland, permanent residents are issued either a biometric ID card in accordance with Schengen regulations if they are non EU/EFTA national, or a paper permit in a yellow-coloured plastic wallet if they are an EU/EFTA national.
*In the United Kingdom, the applicant is issued with a photo ID card known as a Biometric Residence Permit which states that the permit is a Settlement permit for Indefinite Leave to Remain.
*In the United States, permanent residents are issued a photo ID card which is known as a Permanent Resident Card (or simply as a &quot;green card&quot;). Federal law requires that the card be carried on the person at all times.

==Brexit==
The European Union Settlement Scheme is a scheme launched in 2019 by the UK Home Office to process the registration of EU citizens resident in the United Kingdom prior to its departure from the European Union.

Successful applicants receive either &#x27;Pre-settled status&#x27; or &#x27;Settled status&#x27;, depending on the length of time they have been resident in the United Kingdom.

<text>Kristin James Benson (born November 7, 1974) is an American former Major League Baseball starting pitcher who played for several teams between 1999 and 2010.

A highly touted prospect, Benson was drafted first overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1996. He followed a strong rookie season in 1999 with an even stronger season in 2000, but those would prove to be the two best seasons of his career, as he underwent Tommy John surgery after the 2000 season. He posted three more good seasons from 2004 to 2006 with the Pirates, the New York Mets, and the Baltimore Orioles, but then underwent rotator cuff surgery, after which he was never again an effective Major League pitcher.

==High school==
Benson was born in Superior, Wisconsin. His parents were baseball fans who chose names for each of their children that began with &quot;K,&quot; a nod to the letter used as the scorecard designation for a strikeout. Benson attended Sprayberry High School in Marietta, Georgia with future MLB All-Star Marlon Byrd.

==College==
Benson attended Clemson University from 1993 to 1996. His teammates included fellow future major-leaguers Billy Koch and Matthew LeCroy both of whom played with him in the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. (Koch reported teammates referred to Benson as &quot;The Messiah&quot;.) In 1994, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Benson went undefeated during the regular season of his junior year (14–0 with a 1.40 ERA) with 178 strikeouts in 142 innings pitched.

Following this strong regular season, Benson led the Tigers to the NCAA postseason. Though he pitched only one game in the Atlantic regional playoffs, the Tigers&#x27; ace earned all-tournament recognition with an outing in which he allowed only one hit, struck out eight, and walked but one batter. The victorious Tigers, starring Benson, Koch, outfielder and Regional MVP Jerome Robinson, and all-tournament outfielder Gary Burnham, entered the 1996 College World Series on a three-year streak of number-one regional seeds. The presence of Benson, the expected number one selection in the 1996 MLB amateur draft (held that year on the same week as the CWS) helped draw additional attention to the spring series, transforming it into what one then-Clemson sports information official remembered as the &quot;Media World Series.&quot; (Benson was, in fact, drafted by the Pirates during the team&#x27;s trip to Omaha.) Despite his stellar regular season, Benson subsequently dropped two postseason decisions as the Tigers stumbled to a 2-2 CWS record. Nonetheless, the team&#x27;s two victories ended an eight-game CWS losing streak for Clemson and included a win over top-ranked Alabama.

Subsequently, Benson was named College Baseball&#x27;s Player of the Year, only the second (after fellow future major leaguer and Olympian Ben McDonald) to be so honored on the strength of his pitching alone. As a Tiger, he won the Baseball America Player of the Year, and ACC Player of the Year. The pitcher also became only the second baseball player and first Clemson athlete in any sport to be named the ACC Male Athlete of the Year. Other awards for his collegiate career include the Rotary Smith Award and ABCA Player of the Year, and recognition as unanimous consensus first-team All-American. He was also the recipient of the Dick Howser Trophy for his &quot;performance, character, leadership, and courage&quot;. He has also been inducted into the Clemson Hall of Fame in 2005 and the South Carolina Amateur Hall of Fame. In 2003, he was named to the ACC&#x27;s 50-Year Anniversary baseball team. A marketing student, Benson left Clemson prior to receiving his degree.

==Olympics==
In the 1996 Olympics, Benson had 17 strikeouts in as many innings and a 2–1 record, but with a 5.82 ERA. Benson beat Nicaragua to open up the games and then Japan, but it was his single loss (11–2 to eventual silver medalist Japan) which proved costly. Benson lasted only four innings and surrendered five runs, and the bullpen gave up another six, en route to an 11–2 loss that kept the Americans from advancing to the gold medal game. (Ultimately, the U.S. settled for a bronze medal, though this represented an improvement over the squad&#x27;s failure to medal in 1992.)

==Professional baseball==
Benson was the first pick of the 1996 Major League Baseball Draft. After being signed for what was a then-record signing bonus, he spent two years in the minor leagues with the Lynchburg Hillcats and Carolina Mudcats in 1997, and the Nashville Sounds in 1998. Benson made his first major league start on April 9, 1999. He became just the second number one overall pick to win his big league debut. His first strikeout was Sammy Sosa. Benson came in fourth place in the NL Rookie of the Year voting. He came up just shy of breaking the record for most strikeouts in team history by a rookie hurler. His best season came in with Pittsburgh when he posted career-highs in earned run average, strikeouts, innings pitched, and games pitched as well as his only double-digit strikeout games and his career-best three-hit complete game despite the fact that he is a groundball pitcher. That year, Benson broke the record for most strikeouts in Pirates history for a right-handed pitcher. After 2000, he needed Tommy John surgery and missed the entire season. He started the last game at Three Rivers Stadium and the first game ever at Great American Ballpark. Against the Mets, he broke the record for most sacrifice bunts in a game by a pitcher in MLB history with four.

On July 30, 2004, The Pirates traded him and Jeff Keppinger to The New York Mets for Jose Bautista, Ty Wigginton and Matt Peterson. During that period, Benson put together a string of 70 consecutive innings without surrendering a home run. He was awarded the Mets Best Pitcher during the month of September that year with a 0.76 ERA. He beat Randy Johnson twice in the inter league Subway Series, throwing 12 innings of shutout baseball against the Yankees.

On January 21, 2006, Benson was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for pitchers Jorge Julio and John Maine. Some speculated that the pitcher had been ushered out of town partly as an excuse for the Mets to part ways with his wife, outspoken model Anna Benson, who had &quot;perturbed team officials with her risqué wardrobe and provocative comments.&quot; Kris Benson also felt that the Mets had traded him because of his wife, a position disputed by Mets management. The newly minted Oriole beat the Mets that season in interleague play. During the game, he hit his first professional home run off All-Star and Cy Young Award-winner Pedro Martínez.

Benson missed the entire season with a torn rotator cuff. Steve Trachsel replaced Benson in their starting rotation before being traded to the Chicago Cubs for minor league players. On November 1, 2007, the Orioles declined to pick up his $7.5 million option and instead paid a $500,000 buyout.

On February 13, , the Philadelphia Phillies signed Benson to a minor league deal. On June 29, 2008, after two years away from competitive baseball, Benson made his Triple-A debut for the Lehigh Valley IronPigs, throwing 73 pitches. He played 11 games for the IronPigs, but was 1–4 with a 5.52 ERA. However, after two rough initial outings, he went 1–2 with a 3.80 ERA over his remaining 9 starts. He was released on August 30, 2008.

On February 21, , Benson signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Texas Rangers. Benson made the Opening Day 25 man roster as one of the Rangers&#x27; starting pitchers, but after a short stint on the disabled list, he was relegated to the bullpen in long relief. Benson had made over 200 consecutive starts before the move to the bullpen. After proving ineffective as a sporadic reliever upon his return, he was outrighted to the Rangers&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Oklahoma City RedHawks, on June 9, 2009.

On March 15, , Benson signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. On April 15, it was announced that Benson would be the fifth starter for Arizona. He had two effective starts when he first got called up, but injured his shoulder again during his third start against the Colorado Rockies. He also pitched for the Diamondbacks Triple-A affiliate in Reno, Nevada, the Reno Aces.

Before his injury Kris threw regularly in the 93-96 mph range, and, he said, “I think I maxed out at 98. After surgery, I topped out at 90.” 

Benson retired on January 10, 2011. He finished his 10-year career with a 70–75 record in 200 starts (206 appearances) and 61 no-decisions.

==Personal life==
Benson lived in Superior, WI until age 6, before he moved with his family to Milledgeville, GA. In 1988, Benson then moved to Kennesaw, GA. He has two younger sisters and one younger brother. 

In 1998, while playing with the Nashville Sounds in the minor leagues, he met his future wife, Anna Benson while she was working as a dancer in a local strip club. The Bensons were married in October 1999 (her second marriage, his first), the same year he reached the major leagues. The pitcher and model became a well-known baseball couple during Benson&#x27;s time in the major leagues. After Anna reported the couple had sex in the parking lot of Three Rivers Stadium, an experience they wished to replicate at every major league park, concern developed within the Pirates organization the &quot;wild-eyed brunette was getting in the way of her husband&#x27;s fastball...&quot; Her husband dismissed the Pirates treatment of his wife as &quot;a lot of jealousy and a lot of pettiness...&quot;&#x27; Anna filed for divorce on March 31, 2006, citing an &quot;irretrievably broken&quot; marriage., although later withdrew the petition. They had three children together (daughter Haylee, and sons P.J. and Devin James) and were also parenting Anna Benson&#x27;s daughter from her first marriage (Alyssa Warren). In July 2012, Kris filed for divorce, which was finalized later that year. On July 7, 2013, Anna was arrested for attacking Kris after breaking into his house. She was convicted on charges of aggravated assault and gun possession for the attack and sentenced to 15 years probation and three months of inpatient psychiatric therapy. In May 2022, Kris married Misty Martinez, former wife of his former teammate Hank Blalock.

Benson, who earned over $38 million during his playing career, has supported several charities since beginning his professional career. (In an interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; Anna Benson explained that at least one of her husband&#x27;s contracts had been structured with charitable contributions so that this income could not be taxed.) In 2001, after 9/11, the couple founded the non-profit organization Benson&#x27;s Battalion, whose work then-Rep. Melissa Hart praised in a citation to the Congressional Record in 2004. The Battalion raised funds for emergency services in the wake of 9/11. They also made considerable contributions to the Red Cross and United Way for 9/11 relief. In 2005, Benson assisted in a new charity, while with the New York Mets, called Tuesday&#x27;s Children. The charity helped children who lost a parent during the Twin Tower collapses. In recognition of various community service and charity efforts, Benson has been honored with the Pittsburgh Pirates team Roberto Clemente Award, the Thurman Munson Award, the Joan Payson Award, and the New Jersey Sports Writers Humanitarian of the Year Award.

The son of a school teacher and college dean, Benson had been described as studious and methodical in his approach to pitching, personally reserved, and, in comparison to his ex-wife, strait-laced and stoic.

Bob Ingham, along with brother Jack Ingham, purchased and raced Octagonal. Trained by John Hawkes, Octagonal made his debut late in 1994, and was crowned the Australian Champion Two Year Old on the strength of his autumn campaign, which comprised wins in the Todman Trial and AJC Sires Produce Stakes and close seconds in the STC Golden Slipper and AJC Champagne Stakes.

As a three-year-old, Octagonal won seven of his eleven starts, and took his record to 10 wins from 16 starts. In addition to beating a high-standard crop in Sydney&#x27;s three-year-old autumn triple crown - the Canterbury and Rosehill Guineas and the Australian Derby - Octagonal won the two richest weight-for-age races on the Australian calendar, the W. S. Cox Plate and the Mercedes Classic. With earnings of just short of A$4 million, Octagonal was voted the 1996 Australian Champion Three Year Old, Australian Horse of the Year, and remains the last horse to have won the triple crown. The Victoria (spring) and Australian Derby (autumn) double eluded him, however, as he was narrowly defeated by Nothin&#x27; Leica Dane in the Victoria Derby.

Octagonal returned to the track as a four-year-old, but his win the Underwood Stakes was the only highlight of a spring campaign that saw him unplaced in six of his seven starts. Meanwhile, the horses who had finished second to him in the triple crown - Saintly and Filante - won three races each, including the Epsom Handicap, the W. S. Cox Plate (where they were first and second), and the Melbourne Cup. Octagonal&#x27;s final campaign, during the autumn, was more consistent, and featured Group One wins in consecutive starts in the Chipping Norton Stakes, Australian Cup, and the Mercedes Classic. At his final start, he was runner-up in the AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes; a feat coincidentally emulated in the farewell of his champion son, Lonhro, seven years later.

Octagonal retired to stud after 28 starts with a record of 14 wins (10 Group 1), 7 seconds (6 in GI or GII races) and a third. He ended his racing career with a stakes tally of A$5,892,231, the highest of any galloper in Australasia to that point.

Octagonal Entered stud in 1997–2013 Woodlands Stud at Cootamundra, New South Wales and Shuttled in 1998–2001 to Haras du Quesnay France and was pensioned from stud duties in 2013. He is the sire of Australian Group One winning brothers Lonhro and Niello, the South African Group 1 winner, Suntagonal and Laverock whose wins include two Group 1 races: the Prix d&#x27;Ispahan at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris and the Gran Premio del Jockey Club at Milan, Italy&#x27;s, San Siro Racecourse.

He was euthanized on 15 October 2016 at the age of 24 years at Woodlands Stud at Denman in the NSW Hunter Valley. He was buried next to his fellow stallion mate Canny Lad. Owner Bob Ingham described his career as &#x27;heroic&#x27; and &#x27;life-changing&#x27;.

<text>The House of Komnenos ( Komnenoi; , , ), Latinized as Comnenus ( Comneni), was a Byzantine Greek noble family who ruled the Byzantine Empire in the 11th and 12th centuries. The first reigning member, Isaac I Komnenos, ruled from 1057 to 1059. The family returned to power under Alexios I Komnenos in 1081 who established their rule for the following 104 years until it ended with Andronikos I Komnenos in 1185. In the 13th century, they founded the Empire of Trebizond, a Byzantine rump state which they ruled from 1204 to 1461. At that time, they were commonly referred to as Grand Komnenoi (, ), a style that was officially adopted and used by George Komnenos and his successors. Through intermarriages with other noble families, notably the Doukas, Angelos, and Palaiologos, the Komnenos name appears among most of the major noble houses of the late Byzantine world.

==Origins==
The 11th-century Byzantine historian Michael Psellos reported that the Komnenos family originated from the village of Komne in Thrace—usually identified with the &quot;Fields of Komnene&quot; () mentioned in the 14th century by John Kantakouzenos—a view commonly accepted by modern scholarship. The first known member of the family, Manuel Erotikos Komnenos, acquired extensive estates at Kastamon in Paphlagonia, which became the stronghold of the family in the 11th century. The family thereby quickly became associated with the powerful and prestigious military aristocracy () of Asia Minor, so that despite coming from Thrace it came to be considered &quot;eastern&quot;. Aside from deriving legitimacy as rulers from familial links to the prominent Doukai (emperors Constantine X and Michael VII in particular), they also had a tradition linking them to Claudius Gothicus, the supposed grandfather of Constantine the Great. Many classical monuments dedicated to Claudius stood in the vicinity of Kastra Komnenon, which according to historian Maximilian C. G. Lau may have increased his appeal in the eyes of the Komnenoi.

The 17th-century French scholar du Cange suggested that the family descended from a Roman noble family that followed Constantine the Great to Constantinople, from whose cousin but although such mythical genealogies were common—and are attested for the closely related Doukas clan as well—the complete absence of any such assertion in the Byzantine sources argues against Du Cange&#x27;s view. The Romanian historian George Murnu suggested in 1924 that the Komnenoi were of Aromanian descent, but this view too is now rejected. Modern scholars consider the family to have been entirely of Greek origin.

Manuel Erotikos Komnenos was the father of Isaac I Komnenos (), and grandfather, through Isaac&#x27;s younger brother John Komnenos, of Alexios I Komnenos ().

==Founding the dynasty==
Isaac I Komnenos, a stratopedarch of the East under Michael VI, founded the Komnenos dynasty of Byzantine emperors. In 1057 Isaac led a coup against Michael and was proclaimed emperor. Although his reign lasted only until 1059, when his courtiers pressured him to abdicate and become a monk, Isaac initiated many useful reforms. The dynasty returned to the throne with the accession of Alexios I Komnenos, Isaac I&#x27;s nephew, in 1081. By this time, descendants of all the previous dynasties of Byzantium seem to have disappeared from the realm, such as the important Scleros and Argyros families. Descendants of those emperors lived abroad, having married into the royal families of Georgia, Russia, France, Persia, Italy, Germany, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and Serbia; this made it easier for the Komnenos family to ascend to the throne.

Upon their rise to the throne, the Komnenoi became intermarried with the previous Doukas dynasty: Alexios I married Irene Doukaina, the grandniece of Constantine X Doukas, who had succeeded Isaac I in 1059. Thereafter the combined clan was often referred to as () and several individuals used both surnames together. Several families descended from this wider clan, such as Palaiologos, Angelos, Vatatzes and Laskaris. Alexios and Irene&#x27;s youngest daughter Theodora ensured the future success of the Angelos family by marrying into it: Theodora&#x27;s grandsons became the emperors Isaac II Angelos (reigned 1185–1195 and 1203–1204) and Alexios III Angelos (reigned 1195–1203).

==Komnenoi as emperors==

Under Alexios I and his successors the Empire was fairly prosperous and stable. Alexios moved the imperial palace to the Blachernae section of Constantinople. Much of Anatolia was recovered from the Seljuk Turks, who had captured it just prior to Alexios&#x27; reign. Alexios also saw the First Crusade pass through Byzantine territory, leading to the establishment of the Crusader states in the east. The Komnenos dynasty was very much involved in crusader affairs, and also intermarried with the reigning families of the Principality of Antioch and the Kingdom of Jerusalem; Theodora Komnene, niece of Manuel I Komnenos, married Baldwin III of Jerusalem, and Maria, grandniece of Manuel, married Amalric I of Jerusalem.

Remarkably, Alexios ruled for 37 years, and his son John II ruled for 25, after uncovering a conspiracy against him by his sister, the chronicler Anna Komnene. John&#x27;s son Manuel ruled for another 37 years.

The Komnenos dynasty produced a number of branches. As imperial succession was not in a determined order but rather depended on personal power and the wishes of one&#x27;s predecessor, within a few generations several relatives were able to present themselves as claimants. After Manuel I&#x27;s reign the Komnenos dynasty fell into conspiracies and plots like many of its predecessors (and the various contenders within the family sought power and often succeeded in overthrowing the preceding kinsman); Alexios II, the first Komnenos to ascend as a minor, ruled for three years and his conqueror and successor Andronikos I ruled for two, overthrown by the Angelos family under Isaac II who was dethroned and blinded by his own brother Alexios III. The Angeloi were overthrown during the Fourth Crusade in 1204, by Alexios V Doukas, a relative from the Doukas family.

==Later family==
Several weeks before the occupation of Constantinople by crusaders in 1204, one branch of the Komnenoi fled back to their homelands in Paphlagonia, along the eastern Black Sea and its hinterland in the Pontic Alps, where they established the Empire of Trebizond. Their first &#x27;emperor&#x27;, named Alexios I, was the grandson of Emperor Andronikos I. These emperors – the Grand Komnenoi ( or in Greek) as they were known – ruled in Trebizond for over 250 years, until 1461, when David Komnenos was defeated and executed by the Ottoman sultan Mehmed II. Mehmed himself claimed descent from the Komnenos family via John Tzelepes Komnenos. The Trapezutine branch of the Komnenos dynasty also held the name of Axouchos as descendants of John Axouch, a Byzantine nobleman and minister to the Byzantine Komnenian Dynasty. A princess of the Trebizond branch is said to have been the mother of prince Yahya (born 1585), who reportedly became a Christian yet spent much of his life attempting to gain the Ottoman throne.

Another branch of the family, descendants of Constantine Angelos, founded the Despotate of Epirus in 1204, under Michael I Komnenos Doukas, great-grandson of Emperor Alexios I. This branch adopted the surnames Komnenos Doukas and are known as such in modern scholarship. Helena Doukaina Komnene, a child of that branch of the family, married Guy I de la Roche thereby uniting the Komnenos and the de la Roche houses, with Komnenos family members eventually becoming Dukes of Athens.

One renegade member of the family, also named Isaac Komnenos, established a separate &quot;empire&quot; on Cyprus in 1184, which lasted until 1191, when the island was taken from him by Richard I of England during the Third Crusade. His daughter, called the Damsel of Cyprus, married Thierry of Flanders during the Fourth Crusade and tried to claim the island.

When the Byzantine Empire was restored in 1261 at Constantinople, it was ruled by a family closely related to the Komnenoi, the Palaiologoi. The Palaiologoi ruled until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.

The last descendant of the dynasty is often considered to have been John Komnenos Molyvdos, a distinguished Ottoman Greek scholar and physician, who became metropolitan bishop of Side and Dristra, and died in 1719.

In 1782, the Corsican Greek notable Demetrio Stefanopoli obtained letters patent from Louis XVI of France recognizing him as the descendant and heir of the Emperors of Trebizond.

==Komnenian ancestry in Western Europe==
Irene Angelina, daughter of Isaac II Angelos and thus a descendant of Alexios I Komnenos, married Philip of Swabia (1177–1208), the King of Germany. From this union many of the royal and aristocratic families of Western Europe can trace a line of descent.

<doc id="1284381" wikidata="Q4730047" url="?curid=1284381" title="All of Our Names">
<text>All of Our Names is an album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah Harmer, released in 2004. It peaked at number 6 on the Top Canadian Albums chart and number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Heatseekers chart. &quot;Almost&quot; b/w &quot;Pendulums&quot; was released as a single with &quot;Almost&quot; reaching the top 20 on Canadian pop charts. A different version of the track &quot;Silver Road&quot;, recorded with The Tragically Hip and for the soundtrack for the film &quot;Men with Brooms&quot; had been previously released as a single in 2003.

The album won the Juno Award for Adult Alternative Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2005.

==History==
The album was recorded using Digital Performer at Harmer&#x27;s home. Drums and bass and guitars were recorded together using different rooms, and the rest of the album was multi-tracked individually.

Guest musicians on the album include Howie Beck, Gavin Brown, Jim Bryson and Ian Thornley. Harmer plays a number of instruments on the album, including guitar, bass, and drums.

It was released in the U.S. on Zoë Records.

==Reception==
Music critic Johnny Lofthus, writing for Allmusic, praised the album, calling it &quot;homey and gorgeous&quot; and calling Harmer&#x27;s voice &quot;starkly beautiful.&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s fully formed adult alternative stuff here, from the robust head-nod lilt of &#x27;Almost&#x27; to &#x27;New Enemy&#x27;s more stately melody... This immediacy helps sell &quot;All of Our Names&quot;, since music like this can be smothered by over-production.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 3 of 5 stars, stating it is &quot;suffused with a peaceful fatalism, a mood that&#x27;s as casually downbeat as Harmer&#x27;s overcast voice itself.&quot;

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;All of Our Names&quot; a B+ rating, writing: &quot;While it doesn&#x27;t top her priceless 2000 debut, &quot;You Were Here&quot;, the fluid, moody &quot;Names&quot; comes respectably close. With a voice as silvery and luminous as a full moon, Harmer constructs daring metaphors to convey emotional perplexities... songs like the rueful &#x27;Tether&#x27; display Harmer&#x27;s gift for setting human drama to fresh melodies.&quot; Paul Cantin of &quot;No Depression&quot; praised the album and remarked on its themes of rural life and the outdoors, also writing &quot;... while there&#x27;s nothing here that quite reaches the dramatic punch of the latter album&#x27;s standout songs... &quot;All Of Our Names&quot; confirms that Harmer is, by any other name, a formidable, singular talent who has amply rewarded the patience of her fans.&quot;

<text>TeleVideo Corporation was a U.S. company that achieved its peak of success in the early 1980s producing computer terminals. TeleVideo was founded in 1975 by K. Philip Hwang, a Utah State University, Hanyang University graduate born in North Korea who had run a business producing CRT monitors for arcade games since 1975. The company was headquartered in San Jose, California.
TeleVideo&#x27;s terminal protocol was popular in the early days of microcomputers and was widely supported by applications as well as terminal emulators (often referred to as &quot;TeleVideo 925 emulation&quot;).
TeleVideo also built CP/M-compatible 8-bit desktop and portable personal computers based on the Z80 processor. Up to sixteen of these machines could be connected to proprietary multi-user systems through serial interfaces.
In April 1983, TeleVideo introduced an MS-DOS 2.0-compatible personal computer based on the Intel 8088. This was introduced as the Model TS-1603 and included 128 KB RAM (expandable up to 256 KB), integrated monitor, modem and keyboard. The Model TS-1603 ran both TeleVideo PC DOS 2.0 and CP/M-86 1.1.

The company later turned to manufacturing Windows-compatible thin client computers, but eventually sold this business line to Neoware in October 2005. The latter was subsequently taken over by Hewlett-Packard in 2007.

On March 14, 2006, TeleVideo, Inc. filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

After more than 35 years in business and with millions of terminals sold worldwide, TeleVideo discontinued the manufacturing and sales of all terminal products as of September 30, 2011.

<doc id="1284484" wikidata="Q8012749" url="?curid=1284484" title="William Hutt (politician)">
<text>Sir William Hutt, KCB, PC (6 October 1801 – 24 November 1882) was a British Liberal politician who was heavily involved in the colonisation of New Zealand and South Australia.

==Background and education==
Hutt was born in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire. He was the brother of Sir George Hutt and John Hutt, the second governor of Western Australia. He was educated privately at Ryde, Isle of Wight, and Camberwell, and graduated BA (1827) and MA (1831) from Trinity College, Cambridge.

==Political career==
Hutt entered Parliament as MP for Kingston upon Hull in 1832, holding the seat until 1837, when William Wilberforce defeated him. He regained it in 1838 when Wilberforce was unseated on petition. He had an interest in colonial affairs, and became increasingly involved in them. He served as a member of the select committee on colonial lands in 1836; as a commissioner for the foundation of South Australia; as a member of the New Zealand Association from 1837; and as a member of the select committee on New Zealand in 1840. He also helped form (1839) the re-incarnated New Zealand Company, of which he later became a director and chairman.

After he ceased to be MP for Hull in 1841, he successfully stood for the seat of Gateshead, a seat that he retained for over 30 years. He served as Vice-President of the Board of Trade and Paymaster General under Lord Palmerston between 1860 and 1865 and under Lord Russell in 1865 and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1860.
In 1865 he became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.

==Personal life==
In 1831 Hutt married Mary (née Millner), Dowager Countess of Strathmore, widow of John Bowes, 10th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, to whose son John Bowes Hutt had been a tutor. She died in 1860, leaving him mining properties worth £18,000 a year.

The following year he married Frances Anna Jane &quot;Fanny&quot; Stanhope, a daughter of the Hon. Sir Francis Charles Stanhope. The couple had a London home in Grosvenor Square.

Hutt died at Appley Towers, Ryde, on 24 November 1882, aged 81, leaving his landed property to his brother, Sir George Hutt. Frances, Lady Hutt, died in September 1886.

==Eponymous geography==
Hutt is commemorated in the name of the Hutt River in the North Island of New Zealand and the cities of Lower Hutt and Upper Hutt, which stand on its banks. The Hutt River, South Australia and the Hutt River and Hutt Lagoon in Western Australia were also named in his honour. Hutt Street in Adelaide carries his name. The Bowes River in Western Australia was named after his wife Mary.

<doc id="1284496" wikidata="Q3525847" url="?curid=1284496" title="Thornley (band)">
<text>Thornley was a Canadian post-grunge and hard rock band formed by Ian Thornley in 2002. The band was started when Thornley returned to Toronto after the break-up of his earlier band, Big Wreck. With the help of Chad Kroeger of Nickelback, Thornley signed to Kroeger&#x27;s 604 Records. The last line-up of the band as Thornley had Paulo Neta (guitar), Dave McMillan (bass guitar), Christopher Henry (drums) and former Big Wreck member Brian Doherty (guitar).

==History==
The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Come Again&quot;, was produced by Gavin Brown, and released on 604 Records in 2004. Thornley toured Canada and the USA extensively after the album was released and &quot;Come Again&quot; was certified gold in Canada (50,000 units) by the CRIA, while also producing two No. 1 singles (&quot;So Far So Good&quot; also certified Gold in Canada, and &quot;Come Again&quot;). Thornley was nominated for two Juno Awards in the wake of &quot;Come Again&quot;: New Group of the Year and Rock Album of the Year. Thornley&#x27;s single &quot;Easy Comes&quot; was used in the intro video for the PlayStation Portable game &quot;ATV: Offroad: Blazin&#x27; Trails&quot;.

Thornley has stated in interviews that the return to the name &quot;Big Wreck&quot; serves to signal a shift from trying to write singles and write for maximum commercial success. This is an oblique reference to his time at the label of the Nickelback front man, himself known for admitting to writing to a formula that will provide maximum sales. Thornley was so unhappy with the commercialized sheen, and the meddling on the &quot;Come Again&quot; album (and its follow-up) that he, for a short time, released the demos for the &quot;Come Again&quot; album through his My Space page. A listen to these indicates exactly how much meddling and bad direction the songs suffered at the Kroeger-helmed label. The songs are much more raw and powerful than what was released. &quot;It was just time to make a record and somebody brought it up that we should call it a Big Wreck album. There was no one leaning over our shoulders saying, &#x27;You have to do this to get a hit.&#x27; And after the last couple of outings, I was pretty miffed with the whole recording process and people making me edit myself.&quot;

The band initially included Ken Tizzard (formerly of The Watchmen) on bass guitar and Sekou Lumumba (formerly of Edwin &amp; The Pressure) on drums. However, in October 2005, for unknown reasons, they left Thornley and moved on to other personal projects. Thornley continued touring immediately.

According to Ian Thornley&#x27;s October 2006 interview with Tina Peek of &quot;Crusher&quot; magazine, a second album was scheduled for release in early summer 2007. It was expected to be accompanied by a DVD entitled &quot;Thornley Live&quot;, which was shot across Canada in late 2005 by radio and television arts students from Ryerson University. In a November 2007 interview with the Oshawa based CKGE-FM 94.9 FM &quot;The Rock&quot;, Ian Thornley confirmed that the new album was then due to be released in early 2009, suggesting the reason for the delay was that &quot;it&#x27;s a bit of a headache getting a record made these days through the channels of a label ... so many people have to be on board&quot;. He also identified the likely producer as Nick Raskulinecz.

For album&#x27;s support Thornley toured with Three Days Grace, Thousand Foot Krutch, My Darkest Days, Nickelback, Hawksley Workman and many Canadian bands, and opened for Lenny Kravitz.

On December 12, 2008, Thornley released the first single, &quot;Make Believe&quot;, from their second album &quot;Tiny Pictures&quot;. The album itself was released on February 10, 2009. It was produced by Nick Raskulinecz (Foo Fighters, Velvet Revolver, Rush).

For their second album, Ian Thornley recorded all guitars on the record including lead and rhythm guitar as well as bass guitar. Daniel Adair, the drummer from the Canadian rock band Nickelback, played drums on the album. Chad Kroeger, also of Nickelback, co-wrote a track on the album with Ian Thornley along with Alain Johannes and Natasha Shneider of Eleven, who also co-wrote some of the tracks.

Thornley performed at Rock on the Range Canada in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on June 27, 2009.

Thornley also performed at Flemingpaloozza in Peterborough, Ontario, on September 7, 2009, as part of Fleming college&#x27;s orientation.

Thornley was also featured at the Paralympics in Vancouver on March 12, 2010.

In 2010, Thornley and Brian Doherty rekindled their friendship which led to the latter filling in for a Thornley show, and then joining the band as they naturally reconnected as musicians.

The band embarked on a Canadian tour titled &quot;An Evening with Thornley and Big Wreck&quot;. As a result of the tour&#x27;s success, the band took on the Big Wreck name, and all existing members of Thornley effectively became members of Big Wreck.

In July 2011, Ian Thornley left 604 records and signed with Anthem/SRO. His new manager is Andy Curran. A new album by Big Wreck, &quot;Albatross&quot;, has been recorded and was released on March 6, 2012.

On May 11, 2024, the band reunited for the first time in 13 years to perform a one-night only show at The Danforth Music Hall to celebrate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Come Again.&quot; The album was also released on vinyl for the first time ever on a special limited coloured vinyl. The album was also remastered and reissued digitally on streaming services with two previously unreleased songs.

<doc id="1284504" wikidata="Q5725137" url="?curid=1284504" title="Henry Ludington">
<text>Henry Ludington (May 25, 1738 – January 24, 1817) was an American soldier in the American Revolutionary War. He aided the effort by providing spies and was associated with John Jay in a ring of spies.

== Early life ==

Ludington&#x27;s father, William Ludington, was born in Branford, Connecticut, on September 6, 1702. He married Mary Knowles in 1730. Ludington was born in Branford on May 25, 1738 as the third of eight children. His older sisters were Submit and Mary, and Lydia, Samuel, Rebecca, Anne, and Stephen were younger than him. He went to school in Branford and received an education typical for colonial towns of the 18th century.

== Military ==
Ludington enlisted in the Connecticut Provincial Forces in September 1755, at the age of seventeen. He was with Captain Foote&#x27;s company of the Second Connecticut Regiment. He re-enlisted on April 19, 1756, served under Colonel Andrew Ward at Crown Point, and was discharged on November 13, 1756. He was called back again for fifteen days of service for the relief of Fort William Henry in August 1757. He re-enlisted on April 14, 1759, for the campaign of the Second Connecticut Regiment under Colonel Nathan Whiting and was a member of David Baldwin&#x27;s Third Company. He served in the French and Indian War from 1755 to 1760 and was in the Battle of Lake George where he witnessed the death of his uncle and cousin. He marched to Canada and participated in the Battle of Quebec on September 13, 1759. He then proceeded from Boston to Branford, Connecticut, in the spring of 1760 and retired from the military.

Ludington returned to civilian life and married his cousin Abigail on May 1, 1760. She was born on May 8, 1745, and was turning fifteen years old. They had twelve children, all born in Kent, New York, (then known as Philipse Upper Patent) and raised the family on a 229 acre farm.

Ludington was commissioned a lieutenant in recognition of his service. He resigned at the enactment of the Duties in American Colonies Act in 1765. He was affiliated with George Washington&#x27;s intelligence in the American Revolutionary War; the military commander Nathaniel Sackett asked Ludington for help to furnish spies in Dutchess and Westchester Counties, New York, to gather information on British activities.

Ludington collaborated with Enoch Crosby, an American Revolutionary War soldier who worked in the same territory. A shoemaker by trade, while traveling for his trade Crosby was able to obtain critical information important to Washington. Ludington aided Crosby with the objective to get information to American patriots. He also helped other spies, among them Benajah Tubbs and John Jay.

== Death and legacy ==
Ludington died at the age of 78 on January 24, 1817, and was buried in the churchyard of the town&#x27;s Presbyterian church. The grave is marked with a tombstone that has a short inscription:
His wife, Abigail, died at the age of 80 on August 3, 1825, and is buried beside him.

Ludington was the grandfather of Harrison Ludington, who was the 12th governor of Wisconsin. His daughter, Sybil Ludington, has received widespread recognition for her role in a horseback ride to alert her father&#x27;s Minute Men troops to meet the British army. A 2015 report in &quot;The New England Quarterly&quot; says there is little evidence backing the story; whether the ride occurred has been questioned since at least 1956.

<text>Texoma is an interstate region in the United States, split between Oklahoma and Texas. The name is a portmanteau of Texas and Oklahoma. Businesses use the term in their names to describe their intended service area. This includes 8 counties with a population estimate of 319,455.

==Definition==
Texoma is usually defined as the area on either side of the state border along the Red River valley, in particular the area around Lake Texoma. The surrounding area is alternatively referred to as Texomaland.
The Wichita Falls–Lawton and Paris–Hugo areas are often included in Texoma or Texomaland due to their proximity to the Red River and the Texas/Oklahoma border.

Texoma mainly comprises the area and cities surrounding Lake Texoma, which includes eight counties. Much of the population is concentrated in the Sherman–Denison Metropolitan Statistical Area and three Micropolitan Statistical Areas. The area around Bonham is also populous.

Most of the region is also part of the Dallas–Fort Worth Combined Statistical Area.

A portion of Texoma south of Lake Texoma has been designated an American Viticultural Area, the Texoma AVA. The Texas part of Texoma is served by the Texoma Council of Governments.

<text>South Mountain Park in Phoenix, Arizona, is the largest municipal park in the United States, and one of the largest urban parks in North America and in the world. It has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride.

==Geography and ecology==
South Mountain Park preserves in a natural state a mountainous area of or approximately of native desert vegetation. Originally called Phoenix Mountain Park, it was formed in 1924 when President Calvin Coolidge sold its initial 13,000 acres (53 km2) to the city of Phoenix for $17,000. It has since been expanded through bond programs during the 1970s into the early 1980s. It is located south of central Phoenix, hence the name. Since the naming, suburban growth has nearly surrounded the park. Ahwatukee now borders to the south and Laveen to the west.

South Mountain was originally known as the Salt River Mountains. The original mountain park committee consisted of J.C. Dobbins, chairman of the Phoenix city planning commission, Mrs. John Hampton, and H.B. Wilkinson. Dobbins Road, named after J.C. Dobbins, runs east and west just north of the park.

The park&#x27;s lookout point rises over 1000 feet (305 m) above the desert floor. Beyond the roads leading to ramadas and the summit, the park features 58 miles (93 km) of trails for cycling, hiking and horseback riding. Much of the original park infrastructure was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the early 1930s. The landmark Mystery Castle is located within its foothills.

There is a variety of flora and fauna within South Mountain Park. One of the most notable flora is the Elephant tree (&quot;Bursera microphylla&quot;), which exhibits multiple contorted trunk architecture.

 South Mountain Park is also notable for its chuckwalla population. With an average of 65 chuckwallas per hectare, South Mountain has the highest density of chuckwallas that has ever been reported. Further, male chuckwallas at South Mountain exhibit a &quot;carrot tail&quot; phenotype, which is unique to this population.

<doc id="1284528" wikidata="Q1282985" url="?curid=1284528" title="William Plomer">
<text>William Charles Franklyn Plomer (10 December 1903 – 20 September 1973) was a South African and British novelist, poet and literary editor. He also wrote a series of librettos for Benjamin Britten. He wrote some of his poetry under the pseudonym Robert Pagan.

Born of British parents in Transvaal Colony, he moved to England in 1929 after spending a few years in Japan. Although not as well known as many of his peers, he is recognised as a modernist and his work was highly esteemed by other writers, including Virginia Woolf and Nadine Gordimer. He was homosexual, and at least one of his novels portrays a gay relationship, but whether he lived as openly gay himself is unclear.

==Early life==
===Parentage and South Africa===
Plomer was born in Pietersburg, in the Transvaal Colony (now Polokwane in the Limpopo Province of South Africa) on 10 December 1903, to Charles Campbell Plomer (1870-1955) and Edythe, née Waite-Browne.

====Edythe Plomer, née Waite-Browne====
Edythe was a daughter of Edward Waite-Browne, of Cotgrave Place, Nottinghamshire, a &quot;gentleman farmer&quot; &quot;who died young of consumption&quot;. The widowed Mrs Waite-Browne employed French and English governesses for her daughters rather than sending them to school; despite &quot;drawing lessons, dancing lessons, and music lessons&quot;, they learned no domestic skills (William Plomer observing &quot;I doubt if they could have boiled a kettle, still less an egg&quot;), and any purchases were directed through their mother, meaning &quot;they had little idea of the value of money and knew nothing about business of any kind&quot;. Whilst in South Africa, Edythe Plomer suffered health that was &quot;indifferent from the start&quot;, falling ill and taking &quot;some time to recover&quot; from an operation.

====Charles Campbell Plomer====
Charles Plomer- &quot;an unwanted boy&quot; who grew up into &quot;a nervous, unstable man, prone to sudden, unreasonable fits of rage alternating with a great need for affection shown through hugs and kisses&quot;- was a younger son of Colonel Alfred George Plomer, of the Indian Army, later resident at Mayfair. Colonel Plomer, &quot;although the youngest son... had inherited a considerable fortune&quot; which he &quot;unwisely and unluckily&quot; attempted to increase by speculation, in one day losing around £100,000 (equivalent to over £3 million in 2024). William Plomer observed wryly in his autobiography of his grandfather&#x27;s lost fortune that &quot;the money would at any time have been convenient to his descendants.&quot; Charles Plomer (assessed by his son as &quot;a non-thinker, with no inclination for analysis and no far-sightedness to look ahead&quot;) lived a life of varied occupations; after Sherborne School, despite wanting to go into the Army like his elder brothers, due to asthma his father placed him as an apprentice in the wool trade at Bradford, where he lodged with a clergyman. The &quot;sociable&quot; Charles fell in with a high-living set of &quot;gilded youth&quot;, &quot;sons of rich manufacturers&quot;, and ended up surpassing the limits of his allowance when playing cards and billiards. This led to his being sent to Cape Town, South Africa, his father justifying this on the grounds that the climate would benefit Charles&#x27;s asthma. Having professed his intention to propose to his future wife, Edythe, he went armed with a letter of introduction to Cecil Rhodes, who recommended Charles join the Cape Mounted Rifles, a police regiment. Subsequently, he opened a cafe at Port Elizabeth and was swindled by his business partner; set up as a storeman and clerk at Queenstown before being employed as assistant to an old man there, leaving due to the jealousy of the old man&#x27;s &quot;sinister&quot; housekeeper daughter. Looking for work at Kimberley, he was advised instead to join the Bechuanaland Border Police; he ended up participating in the Jameson Raid, but as only Jameson and his officers were to be punished Charles, one of the rank-and-file, was sent to England and set free. His military exploits earned him public admiration (including that of the dancer and actress Mabel Love) and his father&#x27;s respect. Charles presented himself to Edythe&#x27;s family, the Waite-Brownes, bolstered by his new heroic status; the town was &quot;agog&quot; at his visit, and was &quot;with some difficulty restrained from providing a civic welcome&quot;. He was recalled to service, but soon entered the employ of a Pretoria newspaper, the &quot;Press&quot;, where he was tasked with visiting State President of the South African Republic Paul Kruger for &quot;snippets of political gossip&quot;. After a &quot;decade of sunlit drifting&quot;, however, the outbreak of the Second Boer War necessitated his departure from Pretoria; he was then appointed an inspector of transport accompanying convoys (&quot;a train of thirty wagons, each drawn by sixteen oxen&quot;) between Burgersdorp and Aliwal North, and transporting cattle from Bethlehem to Johannesburg. Aged thirty, Charles obtained his release from military service, and immediately returned to England with marriage to Edythe in mind; they were married in London in June 1901, Colonel Plomer &quot;delighted with the marriage, having feared that Charles might take to himself some uncouth colonial girl&quot;.

====William Plomer&#x27;s upbringing====
His father employed in the South African civil service Department of Native Affairs (per Plomer, &quot;a civil servant goes where he is told, and naturally wants his family with him&quot;), the family moved between England and South Africa several times during Plomer&#x27;s youth, with Plomer educated mostly in the United Kingdom. Whilst in England on leave, at the outbreak of the First World War, Charles Plomer offered his linguistic skills- French and Afrikaans- to the War Office, but upon it being established that he was in the employ of the South African civil service, he was sent back there and was commissioned a Captain in the South African forces, helping with enrolment and transport of African drivers and carriers for the campaign against the Germans in East Africa. A later attempt to be sent to France resulted in failure, with Charles being assigned to remain in South Africa as records officer for a corps of Africans in service as stevedores at ports and rail-heads in France. Later, Charles, having reached the rank of Inspector of Native Affairs, left the civil service and took over a trading station in the Zululand region, subsequently becoming a recruiting agent for mine workers at Natal, which his son considered a descent in status.

===The Plomer ancestry===
Plomer&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, Sir William Plomer (1760-1812), was Lord Mayor of London in 1781. Plomer observed in his autobiography of his family: &quot;it is not in the least illustrious, but a bourgeois line of which the fortunes have gone up and down and which has seldom stayed long in one place.&quot; The father of his great-uncle by marriage, both men being named William Downing Bruce, published a Plomer genealogy in 1847, claiming &quot;traditionally they derive from a noble Saxon knight, who lived in the time of King Alfred&quot;; Plomer looked disdainfully on this claim, calling it &quot;fiddlesticks&quot;, based on nothing more than the fact that &quot;Bruce&#x27;s son... had married my great-aunt Louisa, and he probably wished to make out that this alliance was as distinguished as it was lucrative- for Louisa was something of an heiress&quot;. Lacking interest in &quot;mere names and dates&quot;, he much preferred characters like &quot;Christopher Plomer, a canon of Windsor... unfrocked and clapped into the Tower in 1535 for criticizing, as well he might, the behaviour of his royal master, Henry VIII&quot;.

Plomer insisted on the pronunciation of his name as &quot;&quot; (to rhyme with &quot;rumour&quot;), although his family pronounced it in the usual way, rhyming with &quot;Homer&quot;; in his autobiography, Plomer addressed his rejection of the usual pronunciation, according to Christopher Heywood&#x27;s &quot;A History of South African Literature&quot; (2004), this stemming from embarrassment at his father&#x27;s occupation, and &quot;hinting an ancestor&#x27;s improbable job as plumier rather than plumber&quot;.

==Early work==
He started writing his first novel, &quot;Turbott Wolfe&quot;, when he was just 21, which brought him fame (or notoriety) in the Union of South Africa upon publication in 1925, which had inter-racial love and marriage as a theme. He was co-founder, editor and major contributor of the short-lived literary magazine &quot;Voorslag&quot; (&quot;Whiplash&quot;) with two other South African rebels, Roy Campbell and Laurens van der Post in 1926. It included material in both English and Afrikaans, and intended to publish in the Zulu language, and also attempted to portray the more superior standards of European culture, while promoting a racially equal South Africa. Campbell resigned in protest against the editorial control exerted by the financial backer of the magazine. It never gained a wide readership.

==1926: Japan==
Plomer became a special correspondent for the &quot;Natal Witness&quot;, but after Van der Post had met and befriended two Japanese men, one being the Japanese captain of a [yacht] cargo ship (&quot;Canada Maru)&quot;, Katsue Mori, he and Plomer sailed for Japan in September 1926, Plomer leaving South Africa for the last time. Plomer stayed in Japan until March 1929, completing two volumes of short stories (&quot;I speak of Africa&quot; and &quot;Paper Houses&quot;) as well as a collection of poetry. He became friends with academic, poet and author Sherard Vines. There he fell in love with a Japanese man, Morito Fukuzawa, who became the model for the title character of &quot;Sado&quot;.

==1929: England==

He then travelled through Korea, China, the Soviet Union, Poland, Germany, and Belgium to England and, through his friendship with his publisher Virginia Woolf and husband Leonard Woolf, entered the London literary circles. Among his friends there were Christopher Isherwood, W.H. Auden, Forster, J. R. Ackerley and Stephen Spender. The Woolfs, under their imprint the Hogarth Press, published &quot;Sado&quot; in 1931 and &quot;The Case is Altered&quot; in 1932, the latter becoming his most commercially successful novel.

In 1933 Plomer left Hogarth amicably (&quot;Selected Poems&quot; was published by Hogarth in 1940) and published &quot;The Child of Queen Victoria and Other Stories&quot; with Jonathan Cape.

He became a literary editor for Faber and Faber, and became chief reader and literary adviser to Jonathan Cape from 1937 to 1940, where he recognised the saleability of, and edited the first and many more of Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond series. Fleming dedicated &quot;Goldfinger&quot; to Plomer.

From 1937, Plomer took part in BBC Radio broadcasts, and contributed to the Aldeburgh Festival from its start in 1948. From the late 1950s, he contributed to frequent poetry readings and events, served on the Arts Council and the board of the Society of Authors.

He is known to have used the pseudonym &quot;Robert Pagan&quot;, notably for some of his poetry.

He was also active as a librettist, with &quot;Gloriana&quot;, &quot;Curlew River&quot;, &quot;The Burning Fiery Furnace&quot; and &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; for Benjamin Britten.

At least one source (Alexander) says that Plomer was never openly gay during his lifetime; at most he alluded to the subject. However Southworth says that he lived relatively openly as a homosexual in Japan, and portrayed gay relationships in a number of his novels, including &quot;Sado&quot;, &quot;The Case is Altered&quot;, and &quot;The Invaders&quot;.

==Later life and death==
He served as one of three judges with James Baldwin and Noni Jabavu, for a short story competition created by Nat Nakasa, launched in The Classic volume one, issue two (November 1968).

In later life he collaborated with artist Alan Aldridge on a book of children&#x27;s verse, &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot;.

Plomer described himself as &quot;Anglo-African-Asian&quot; in a 1967 article of that name, nearly 40 years after his return to England.

At the time of his death, his address was 43, Adastra Avenue in Hassocks, West Sussex; another source gives Lewes, the location of a nearby hospital, as place of death. He died on 20 September 1973 aged 69 in the arms of his partner of almost thirty years, Charles Erdmann. The date given by Encyclopaedia Britannica and in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; is incorrect.

==Recognition, legacy==
In 1951 Plomer was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

He was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by the University of Durham in 1959.

In 1966 he chaired the panel of judges for the Cholmondeley Award.

He won the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1963.

He was publicly tipped for the Poet Laureateship in 1967 and 1972.

He was awarded a CBE in 1968.

In 1958 he was elected president of the Poetry Society.

In 1976, the inaugural Mofolo-Plomer Prize, created by Nadine Gordimer and so named in honour of Basotho writer Thomas Mofolo and Plomer, was awarded to Mbulelo Mzamane. The judges for that year were Chinua Achebe, Alan Paton and Adam Small. Since then, Achmat Dangor, J. M. Coetzee, Njabulo Simakahle Ndebele, Rose Zwi and Peter Wilhelm have been other recipients of the prize.

Nadine Gordimer, in her introduction to a new edition of &quot;Turbott Wolfe&quot; in 2003, said that the novel deserved recognition as being in the &quot;canon of renegade colonialist literature along with Conrad&quot;, and others have noted its experimental narrative structure, which puts it (along with some of his other work) in the category of a modernist novel.

His last work, the collection of children&#x27;s poems entitled &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot;, won the 1973 Whitbread Award.

Durham University has an extensive collection of Plomer&#x27;s literary papers and correspondence, as well as his library of printed books, and lists a full bibliography on its website.

A portrait of Plomer seated on a chair, in oils, dated 1929, by Edward Wolfe, and several photographs of Plomer, by Howard Coster and others are held by the National Portrait Gallery in London.

<text>The Watchmen are a Canadian rock band. They were one of the most commercially successful bands in Canada in the mid to late 1990s. During their peak years, the band had one platinum record (&quot;In the Trees&quot;) and three more gold records (&quot;McLaren Furnace Room&quot;, &quot;Silent Radar&quot;, and &quot;Slomotion&quot;). The band has toured Canada a number of times, were the opening act for The Tragically Hip, and co-headlined a national tour with Big Wreck.

==History==
The Watchmen first came together in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1988. Founding members were Daniel Greaves, Joey Serlin, Sammy Kohn and Pete Loewen. After performing together for several years, they released an album, &quot;McLaren Furnace Room&quot;, in 1992.

In 1994, Loewen left the band and was replaced by Ken Tizzard. That same year, the band released their second album, &quot;In the Trees&quot;. The album was certified Platinum in Canada and is the band&#x27;s most successful album to date.

The band released the albums &quot;Brand New Day&quot; and &quot;Silent Radar&quot; in 1996 and 1998, respectively.

In 1999 the band performed as part of Humble &amp; Fred Fest at Fort York in Toronto. Kohn had left the band when they recorded their 2001 album &quot;Slomotion&quot;; the percussion tracks were created electronically. A single from the album, &quot;Absolutely Anytime&quot; was in the Top Ten on the Canadian charts for several weeks. While touring to support the album, the band took on drummer Ryan Ahoff.

In 2003, the Watchmen announced their farewell tour and their intention to disband. They returned to Winnipeg to perform at a fundraiser for the Israel national bobsleigh team.

In 2010, the Watchmen came together for a reunion show at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto. They have since continued to perform occasional shows across Canada.

The Watchmen are members of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

<doc id="1284540" wikidata="Q465764" url="?curid=1284540" title="Gretchen Bleiler">
<text>Gretchen Elisabeth Bleiler (born April 10, 1981) is an American former professional halfpipe snowboarder. She won a silver medal at the 2006 Olympics.

==Career==
Born in Toledo, Ohio, Bleiler aspired to compete in the Winter X Games from a very young age, and found her passion in snowboarding at age 11 (1992). She has been riding ever since and became professional in 1996. Among her accomplishments, she jump-started the invert revolution for female riders as the first to land a Crippler 540 in competition, and won more halfpipe competitions in 2003, 2005 and 2006 than any other female snowboarder. In the pre-Olympic season she won four of the five US Olympic halfpipe qualifiers and is also a four-time X Games gold medalist, most recently winning the superpipe at Winter X Games XIV.

In 2003, she was a U.S. snowboard Grand Prix champion, a U.S. Open of snowboarding champion, and a Triple Crown of Snowboarding champion.

She posed for the February 2004 issue of &quot;FHM&quot;, along with fellow snowboarder Tara Dakides and sportscaster Jamie Little.

Bleiler, who missed qualifying for the 2002 Winter Olympics due to a tiebreaker, won a silver medal in the women&#x27;s halfpipe at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy.

Starting in 2007, Bleiler expanded her career into snowboard and outerwear design, through Oakley and K2 Snowboarding, designing her own signature outerwear line for Oakley, and participating in the K2 Alliance, which develops and tests women&#x27;s products, as well as working on the graphics for several K2 Boards. In 2008, she helped to create a new all-female invitational superpipe competition at Snowmass called the Snow Angels Invitational.

While competing in the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, many considered Bleiler a gold medal favorite. However, she fell on both of her final runs, and took 11th place.

During the summer, Gretchen Bleiler coaches and mentors youth at High Cascade Snowboard Camp. In 2008, 2010, and 2014 she was awarded a Signature Session at High Cascade.

Bleiler announced her retirement in January 2014 after being injured in a 2012 training accident and failing to make the 2014 Winter Olympics team. She is currently pursuing speaking, writing, teaching, activism and being an entrepreneur; she is an owner of ALEX Bottle (which stands for &quot;Always Live EXtraordinarily&quot;) with her husband Chris.

<doc id="1284543" wikidata="Q7981310" url="?curid=1284543" title="Wellington, Washington">
<text>Wellington (later known as Tye) was a small unincorporated railroad community in the northwest United States, on the Great Northern Railway in northeastern King County, Washington.

Founded in 1893, it was located in the Cascade Range at the west portal of the original Cascade Tunnel under Stevens Pass. It was the site of the 1910 Wellington avalanche, the worst in U.S. history, in which 96 people died.

==1910 avalanche==

The Wellington avalanche was the deadliest avalanche in the history of the United States, marked by the total death count of 96.

For nine days at the end of February 1910, the Wellington area experienced a severe blizzard. Up to a foot (30 cm) of snow fell every hour, and, on the worst day, of snow fell. Two trains, a passenger train and a mail train, both bound from Spokane to Seattle, were trapped in the depot. Snow plows were present at Wellington and others were sent to help, but they could not penetrate the snow accumulations and repeated avalanches along the stretch of tracks between Scenic and Leavenworth.

Late on February 28, the snow stopped and was replaced by rain and a warm wind. Just after 1 a.m. on March 1, as a result of a lightning strike, a slab of snow broke loose from the side of Windy Mountain during a thunderstorm. A ten-foot high mass of snow, half a mile long and a quarter of a mile wide, fell toward the town. A forest fire had recently ravaged the slopes above the town, leaving very little to impede the avalanche.

The avalanche missed the Bailets Hotel (which also housed the town&#x27;s general store and post office), but hit the railroad depot. Most of the passengers and crew were asleep aboard their trains. The impact threw the trains downhill and into the Tye River valley. Ninety-six people were killed, including 35 passengers, 58 Great Northern employees on the trains, and three railroad employees in the depot. Twenty-three people survived; they were pulled from the wreckage by railroad employees who immediately rushed from the hotel and other buildings where they had been staying. However, the work was then abandoned because of the adverse weather conditions, and it was not until 21 weeks later (late July) that the last of the bodies were retrieved.

This was not the only avalanche in the region that winter. Three days later, 63 railroad workers were killed in the Rogers Pass avalanche nearby in British Columbia.
== Aftermath ==
Wellington was quietly renamed &quot;Tye&quot; during October because of the unpleasant associations of the old name. In the same month, the Great Northern Railway began construction of concrete snow sheds to shelter the nearby tracks. The depot was closed when the second Cascade Tunnel was completed in 1929; the town was then abandoned and it eventually burned.

Considered a ghost town, the old track and snow sheds remain and have been preserved as part of the Iron Goat Trail, which is accessible from U.S. Highway 2 near Stevens Pass or near Scenic, east of Everett.

Grey College (Afrikaans: &quot;Grey Kollege&quot;) is a semi-private English &amp; Afrikaans medium school for boys situated in the suburb of Universitas in Bloemfontein in the Free State province of South Africa, it is one of the 23 Milner Schools. The sister school is C&amp;N Sekondêre Meisieskool Oranje.

Grey College was ranked 1st among high schools in Africa by Africa Almanac in 2003 and 2013, based upon quality of education, student engagement, strength and activities of alumni, school profile, internet and news visibility.

== History ==

The school was officially opened on 13 October 1855 and the first headmaster was the Reverend Andrew Murray. Believed by scholars and alumni to be the third-oldest school in South Africa, there are in fact several other schools that were established at earlier dates as far back as 1738. With formal education being established later in the northern regions of the country, it is the oldest school north of the Orange River.

During his presidential inauguration speech in 1896, while addressing learners from Grey College, Marthinus Theunis Steyn mentioned that he envisioned a university for Bloemfontein where youth from all over the country could come and study. He supported the idea that Grey College should provide higher education to the people of the Orange Free State. As a result, the University of the Free State essentially came into existence in 1904 when a tertiary portion of Grey College was allocated for such purpose.

The school grounds consist of a number of historic buildings, of which five are Free State provincial heritage sites: the Main building and Hamilton Hall, the Andrew Murray House, the Brill House and the Tuck shop.

The school offers a number of scholarships such as the Badawi Legacy scholarship given in partnership with Montpellier Rugby Club to promote rugby, education and French culture. Old Greys donate funds to the Jock Meiring Trust and Bram Fisher Trust, funds used for the administration of school grounds and granting of scholarships.

Grey College is known nationally as being particularly strong at the sport of rugby, the &quot;secret&quot; handshake, and old boys speaking passionately about their school.

<text>Daniel Greaves (born 1 December 1970) is a Canadian rock vocalist and songwriter. He is known as the founder and lead singer of the band The Watchmen, and for his a capella singing.

==Career==

===The Watchmen===

In 1988, Greaves became the lead singer of The Watchmen, which he co-formed with Joey Serlin, Sammy Kohn and Pete Loewen. The Watchmen were a successful alternative rock band most active in the 1990s. Greaves also played keyboards and harmonica in the band. Between 1992 and 2001, they released six records internationally, toured extensively and built a substantial fan base in Canada and Australia. Each of their album releases achieved either gold or platinum status in Canada.

In 2003, the band members decided to separate and explore different opportunities individually, but still continue to perform with each other from time to time. Since the 2003 split, Greaves has worked with former Watchmen bandmate Ken Tizzard in the duo Audio Playground High + Wide. Tizzard and Greaves performed in a series of live visual music presentations at venues such as Ted&#x27;s Wrecking Yard and the Berkley Church. The Watchmen reunited several years after their split, and they continue to play regular concerts across Canada.

===Doctor===
After leaving The Watchmen, Greaves founded the band Doctor with bassist Rob Higgins, a former member of Change of Heart.

The duo was joined in studio by guitarist Jamie Edwards and drummer Dan Cornelius to record the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;High Is As High Gets&quot;, which was licensed on SUMO Music and released in 2004. The four musicians also began touring following the album&#x27;s release, with Carmen Lamont occasionally filling in for Edwards on guitar. Doctor broke up in 2005.

===Serlin Greaves===
Joey Serlin and Daniel Greaves of The Watchmen are set to release their debut album, &quot;Sad Songs For Sale&quot;, on May 28.

==Film and TV==

In between performing and recording with his bands, Greaves worked on a number of film and television projects. He was the music supervisor, composer, and audio mixer for the 2000 film, &quot;Kanadiana&quot; (featured in the Montreal World Film Festival), the 2002 feature film, &quot;The Risen&quot; (starring Alberta Watson and Eugene Lipinski), Trevor Cunningham&#x27;s 2003 feature film &quot;The Pedestrian&quot;, and director Brett Blackwell&#x27;s 2010 film, &quot;Happiness is Hate Therapy&quot;, which originally aired on Bravo!.

Later, The Watchmen tracks, &quot;The South&quot; and &quot;Sleep&quot;, were included on the soundtrack of the 2010 TIFF selected film &quot;The Whistleblower&quot;.

Greaves provided original music for MTV&#x27;s 2002 &quot;Everybody’s Doing It&quot;. His music can also be heard on regularly on &quot;CSI&quot; (CTV), &quot;Divine Design with Candice Olson&quot; (HGTV), and &quot;Take it Outside&quot; (HGTV).

==Other work and appearances==

In 2005, Greaves contributed vocals to the track &quot;This Longing&quot; on the Neverending White Lights debut CD &quot;Act 1: Goodbye Friends of the Heavenly Bodies&quot;. In 2006, he contributed to Winnipeg producer Darcy Ataman&#x27;s new tune &quot;A Song for Africa&quot; which was a benefit project to raise funds for African AIDS relief. In 2006, he composed the soundtrack to a new drinking and driving commercial commissioned by Saskatchewan Government Insurance (SGI).

Greaves has also been heard on the CBC Music radio network, as a fill-in host and as Saturday host of &quot;Weekend Mornings&quot; in 2021 and 2022.

==Personal life==
Greaves rarely spoke about his racial identity during the height of the Watchmen&#x27;s career; however, in 2020, amid the global reckoning around racism that followed the murder of George Floyd, he wrote a first-person essay for CBC Radio reflecting on how his upbringing as the son of a Black Canadian father and a Jewish mother had shaped him.

Greaves is a partner in Toronto&#x27;s Lakeview Restaurant with Fadi Hakim. In late 2010 the restaurant company opened a coffee shop called The Abbott in Toronto&#x27;s Parkdale. He and his wife Lisa also own The Motel Bar in Parkdale.

His brother, David Greaves, who has dual Canadian-Israeli citizenship, is a member of the Israeli Bobsled Team.

<doc id="1284561" wikidata="Q1271505" url="?curid=1284561" title="Little hermit">
<text>The little hermit (Phaethornis longuemareus) is a hummingbird that is a resident breeder in north-eastern Venezuela, northern Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and Trinidad. This lowland species occurs in various semi-open wooded habitats, e.g. mangrove, secondary forest, plantations and scrub. In Trinidad it also occurs in rainforest. It is fairly common in most of its range, and therefore listed as Least Concern by BirdLife International on the IUCN Red List.

Previously, several other small hermits were considered subspecies of this species. This includes the stripe-throated hermit (&quot;P. striigularis&quot;) of Central America and north-western South America, the minute hermit (&quot;P. idaliae&quot;) of south-eastern Brazil, the Tapajós hermit (&quot;P. aethopyga&quot;) of south-eastern Amazonia, and the black-throated hermit (&quot;P. atrimentalis&quot;) of western Amazonia. As presently defined, the little hermit is monotypic.

It is among the smallest hummingbirds and birds overall with a total length of about and a weight of . It is olive-green above with orange-ochraceous uppertail coverts and underparts (the belly often is greyer). As most other hermits, it has a long decurved bill, elongated central rectrices with whitish tips and a blackish mask bordered by a whitish-buff malar and supercilium. The upper mandible is black, the lower is yellow with a black tip. The male has a slightly darker throat than the female.

The males form communal leks where they sing and flash their tails to attract the females. The song varies over its range, but typically is high, squeaky, complex and repeated again and again.

The little hermit lays two eggs in a conical nest suspended under a large leaf. Incubation and fledging period not reported, but probably as relatives where incubations is 14–16 days, and fledging another 20–23 days.

The food of this species is nectar, taken from a wide variety of flowers (e.g. &quot;Heliconia&quot;), and some small insects and spiders. It feeds mainly by trap-lining.

<text>Ian Thornley (born July 21, 1972) is a Canadian rock guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter. He is best known for his work with the bands Big Wreck and Thornley.

==Career==
Born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Thornley studied jazz music at Boston&#x27;s Berklee College of Music in the 1990s and formed the band Big Wreck in 1993 with classmates David Henning, Brian Doherty, and Forrest Williams. They soon relocated from Boston to Toronto and eventually signed a US record deal with Atlantic Records. Their 1997 debut album, &quot;In Loving Memory Of...&quot;, was a significant hit that year on rock radio in both Canada and the US. Big Wreck released a follow-up in 2001, called &quot;The Pleasure and the Greed&quot;, and broke up in 2002.

The same year, Thornley auditioned with Velvet Revolver for the position of lead singer. He later stated that he did not feel comfortable singing without playing guitar. The band eventually chose Scott Weiland as their vocalist.

Later in 2002, Thornley formed a new band, simply titled Thornley, which released their first album, &quot;Come Again&quot;, in 2004. Their follow-up record, &quot;Tiny Pictures&quot;, was published in Canada on February 10, 2009, via 604 Records. It was produced and mixed by Nick Raskulinecz.

Ian Thornley left 604 Records in 2011 and signed with Anthem Records. During this time, he reunited with his former Big Wreck bandmate Brian Doherty to resurrect the group. They began work on a new album, entitled &quot;Albatross&quot;, which was released on March 6, 2012. The group toured Canada from April to July.

Big Wreck released their fourth studio album, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, in Canada on June 10, 2014, and in the US on July 15. It debuted at No. 5 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 4,000 copies in its first week.

In 2015, Thornley published the album &quot;Secrets&quot; under the name Ian Fletcher Thornley.

Big Wreck has since released the albums &quot;Grace Street&quot; (2017), &quot;...But for the Sun&quot; (2019), &quot;7&quot; (2023), and &quot;Pages&quot; (2023).

A 2011 survey of economics professors named Levitt their fourth favorite living economist under the age of 60, after Paul Krugman, Greg Mankiw and Daron Acemoglu.

==Career==
Levitt attended St. Paul Academy and Summit School in St. Paul, Minnesota. He graduated from Harvard University in 1989 with his BA in economics &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, writing his senior thesis on rational bubbles in horse breeding, and then worked as a consultant at Corporate Decisions, Inc. (CDI) in Boston advising Fortune 500 companies. He received his PhD in economics from MIT in 1994. He is currently the William B. Ogden Distinguished Service Professor and the director of Gary Becker Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics at the University of Chicago. In 2003 he won the John Bates Clark Medal, awarded every two years by the American Economic Association to the most promising U.S. economist under the age of 40.
In April 2005 Levitt published his first book, &quot;Freakonomics&quot; (coauthored with Stephen J. Dubner), which became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. Levitt and Dubner also started a blog devoted to Freakonomics.

==Work==
Levitt has published over 60 academic publications, studying topics including crime, politics and sports, through the framework of economics. For example, his &quot;An Economic Analysis of a Drug-Selling Gang&#x27;s Finances&quot; (2000) analyzes a hand-written &quot;accounting&quot; of a criminal gang, and draws conclusions about the income distribution among gang members. His most well-known and controversial paper (&quot;The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime&quot; (2001), co-authored with John Donohue) posits that the legalization of abortion in the US in 1973 was a major causal factor in the considerable reduction in crime that followed approximately eighteen years later.

=== The impact of legalized abortion on crime ===
Revisiting a question first studied empirically in the 1960s, Donohue and Levitt argued that the legalization of abortion could account for almost half of the reduction in crime witnessed in the 1990s. Their 2001 paper sparked much controversy, to which Levitt has said
&quot;. . . John Donohue and I estimate maybe that there are 5,000 or 10,000 fewer homicides because of it. But if you think that a fetus is like a person, then that&#x27;s a horrible tradeoff. So ultimately I think our study is interesting because it helps us understand why crime has gone down. But in terms of policy towards abortion, you&#x27;re really misguided if you use our study to base your opinion about what the right policy is towards abortion&quot;

In 2003, Theodore Joyce argued that legalized abortion had little impact on crime, contradicting Donohue and Levitt&#x27;s results. In 2004, the authors published a response, in which they claimed Joyce&#x27;s argument was flawed due to omitted-variable bias.

In November 2005, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist Christopher Foote and his research assistant Christopher Goetz, published a paper, in which they argued that the results in Donohue and Levitt&#x27;s paper were due to statistical errors made by the authors. When the corrections were made, Foote and Goetz argued that abortion actually increased violent crime instead of decreasing it.

In January 2006, Donohue and Levitt published a response, in which they admitted the errors in their original paper, but also pointed out that Foote and Goetz&#x27;s correction was flawed due to heavy attenuation bias. The authors argued that, after making necessary changes to fix the original errors, the corrected link between abortion and crime was now weaker but still statistically significant.

In 2019, Levitt and Donohue published a new paper to review the predictions of the original 2001 paper. The authors concluded that the original predictions held up with strong effects. &quot;We estimate that crime fell roughly 20% between 1997 and 2014 due to legalized abortion. The cumulative impact of legalized abortion on crime is roughly 45%, accounting for a very substantial portion of the roughly 50-55% overall decline from the peak of crime in the early 1990s.&quot;
