<text>The Union of Grodno was a series of acts of the Polish–Lithuanian union between Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The first acts were signed in 1432 during the Lithuanian Civil War of 1431–1435. The acts confirmed the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401). The Union established Sigismund Kęstutaitis as the Grand Duke of Lithuania and re-established Władysław II Jagiełło&#x27;s seniority and dynastic interest in Lithuania.

==Background==
After death of Vytautas in 1430, the Lithuanian nobles unilaterally selected Švitrigaila as the new Grand Duke. This violated the terms of the Union of Horodło of 1413, where Lithuanians promised not to elect a new Grand Duke without an approval from Poland. The Polish nobles were outraged and demanded that Švitrigaila acknowledged fealty to his brother Władysław II Jagiełło, King of Poland. Švitrigaila refused and the conflict grew into a civil war. In September 1431, Poland and Lithuania signed a two-year truce; however, on 31 August 1432, a group of nobles deposed Švitrigaila in support of Sigismund Kęstutaitis, brother of Vytautas. Sigismund resumed policy of union with Poland. A Polish delegation, sent to Lithuania by Władysław II Jagiełło and led by Zbigniew Oleśnicki, Bishop of Kraków, pronounced Sigismund as the Grand Duke of Lithuania for life on 30 September 1432. Sigismund swore loyalty to Poland in an act, signed in Grodno (Hrodna) on 25 October 1432. Władysław II Jagiełło confirmed both acts on 3 January 1433. Sigismund had to reconfirm his loyalty to these provisions on 20 January 1433, 27 February 1434, 6 December 1437 and 31 October 1439. Collectively all these acts are known as the Union of Grodno.

==Provisions==
The Union established a clear lord–vassal relationship between Władysław II Jagiełło (styled &quot;dominus nostra&quot; and &quot;frater seniorus&quot;) and Sigismund (styled &quot;supremus princeps ad tempora vitae&quot;). The act in essence confirmed the Union of Vilnius and Radom (1401) and granted Sigismund the same rights as Vytautas enjoyed during his reign. After Sigismund&#x27;s death, Lithuania was to return to the King of Poland; thus the Union of Grodno abandoned provisions of the Union of Horodło (1413), which envisioned that the Lithuanian nobility would elect their new Grand Duke with consent of the Polish nobles. Sigismund promised not to seek the Lithuanian crown and his son Michael Žygimantaitis had no dynastic rights to the throne of Lithuania. Thus Jagiełło&#x27;s dynastic interest in Lithuania was re-established, which is explained by the fact that in 1413 he had no children, while in 1432 he had two sons (Władysław III and Casimir IV). Sigismund also made territorial concessions to Poland, which received contested Podolia and part of Volhynia (except for Lutsk and Volodymyr-Volynskyi). After Sigismund&#x27;s death entire Volhynia was to unconditionally pass to Poland.

==Aftermath==
In 1435 Sigismund won the decisive Battle of Wiłkomierz thus ending the Lithuanian Civil War of 1431–1435. He established himself in Lithuania and began distancing from pro-Polish policies. Sigismund took advantage of dynastic struggle between the Jagiellons and the Habsburg dynasty over the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1437–1438 and attempted to form an anti-Polish coalition with the Teutonic Knights. The plan failed and Sigismund was forced to re-confirm the Union of Grodno in 1437 and 1439. Despite the declarations, after Sigismund&#x27;s murder in 1440, the Lithuanians unilaterally elected Casimir IV Jagiellon as their Grand Duke. The union between Poland and Lithuania was broken until 1447, when Casimir also became King of Poland.

<text>The Act of Mielnik or Union of Mielnik was an attempt to unite the Kingdom of Poland with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1501. It was not ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas or by the Polish Sejm (see Łaski&#x27;s Statute). The Act of Mielnik remained just a political project. Despite the failure to unify two countries into a single state, Poland and Lithuania were under a personal union until the Union of Lublin of 1569.

==Provisions==

After death of John I Albert, King of Poland, his brother Alexander Jagiellon, Grand Duke of Lithuania, became the most suitable candidate for the new king. Such a move would revive the Polish–Lithuanian union, a personal union between the two states. However, Alexander&#x27;s ambitions went further. The Act of Mielnik was drafted by Polish and Lithuanian diplomats on 3 October 1501 in Piotrków and confirmed on 23 October 1501 by Alexander (who was already elected as the Polish King but not yet crowned) and few members of the Lithuanian Council of Lords. On 30 October, twenty-seven Lithuanian nobles and boyars agreed to abide by the Union of Melnik. The act declared that Poland and Lithuania would be united into a single state with one ruler, one parliament (Great Sejm), one monetary system, and one army. The separate and independent position of the Grand Duke of Lithuania was eliminated, transferring the title to King of Poland. It meant that Alexander gave up his hereditary rights to the throne of the Grand Duchy. Such declaration sharply contrasted with the Union of Kraków and Vilna of 1499, which envisioned the Polish–Lithuanian union as an alliance of two equal partners.

==Jagiellon ambitions==
Such a declaration reflected changed priorities of the Jagiellon dynasty. In Lithuania, their patrimony, the Jagiellons had hereditary rights, while in Poland they had to be elected by the nobles. Earlier Jagiellons saw Lithuania as their stronghold to ensure their power in Poland and therefore supported Lithuania&#x27;s independence from Poland. However, as the Kings were educated and lived mostly in Poland, they began to focus on Polish affairs often regarding Lithuanian matters as secondary. As Jagiellons became monarchs of the Kingdom of Hungary and the Kingdom of Bohemia, they became interested in uniting the two countries into one, strengthening their positions for further dynastic expansion in Eastern and Central Europe. However, the Act of Melnik was not supported by Alexander&#x27;s brother Vladislas II, King of Bohemia and Hungary.

==Ratification==
The Act attracted only limited support among the Lithuanian nobles, chiefly Voivode of Trakai Jan Jurjewicz Zabrzeziński and Bishop of Vilnius Wojciech Tabor. Some Lithuanians hoped for Polish assistance in the Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars, especially after the defeat in the Battle of Vedrosha. Most nobles, including Grand Chancellor Mikołaj Radziwiłł, Bishop of Samogitia Martynas Lintfaras, regent of Navahrudak Albrecht Goštautas, were against the Act. The Act required that it would be ratified by the Lithuanian Seimas. However, the war with the Grand Duchy of Moscow postponed the Seimas until 1505 and by that time Alexander himself showed much less interest in ratifying the Act. It was hoped that the Act of Melnik could be ratified by the Polish Sejm in Radom in 1505. However, the Lithuanian Seimas in Brest rejected the Act and did not authorize the Lithuanian delegates to the Sejm in Radom to discuss the Act.

<text>The Polish–Lithuanian union was a relationship created by a series of acts and alliances between the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania that lasted for prolonged periods of time from 1385 and led to the creation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, or the &quot;Republic of the Two Nations&quot;, in 1569 and eventually to the creation of a unitary state in 1791.

== History ==
Important historical events included:
* 1385 – Union of Krewo, a personal union that brought the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Jogaila, to the Polish throne as a result of his marriage to Jadwiga of Poland in February 1386
* 1401 – Union of Vilnius and Radom, which strengthened the Polish–Lithuanian union
* 1413 – Union of Horodło, a treaty requiring Polish and Lithuanian noblemen to organize congresses to resolve issues of common interest. Essentially a heraldic union, the treaty granted many szlachta rights to Lithuanian nobility.
* 1432 (1432–34) – Union of Grodno, a declarative attempt to renew a closer union
* 1499 – Union of Kraków and Vilnius in which the personal union became a dynastic union and recognised the sovereignty of Lithuania and described relations between the two states
* 1501 – Union of Mielnik, a renewal of the personal union
* July 1, 1569 – Union of Lublin, a real union that resulted in creation of the semi-federal, semi-confederal Republic of the Two Nations (Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth)
* May 3, 1791 – Polish Constitution of May 3, 1791: abolished the elective monarchy and turned it into a hereditary monarchy and established a common state, the &quot;Rzeczpospolita Polska&quot; (Polish Commonwealth), in its place. The Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations modified the changes by stressing the continuity of binational status of the state. The changes were reversed completely in 1792 under pressure from the Russian Empire. In any case, the two Partitions carried out by Berlin and Saint Petersburg (in 1793, and 1795) led to the final collapse of the Commonwealth.

<text>Dharan () is a sub-metropolitan city in Sunsari District of Koshi Province, in eastern Nepal, which was established as a fourth municipality in the Kingdom in 1958. It is the third most populous city in eastern Nepal after Biratnagar and Itahari. The Nepali word &quot;dharan&quot; means a saw pit. The rainforest from which the tree trunks came is still just on the edge of the city. 
 Much later the British Gurkha camp opened in October 1960. The use of the camp by British Gurkhas finished in the mid-1990s. Dharan has an estimated city population of 173,096 living in 34,834 households as per the 2021 Nepal census. It is one of the cities of the &quot;Greater Birat Development Area&quot; which incorporates the cities of Biratnagar-Itahari-Gothgau-Biratchowk-Dharan primarily located on the Koshi Highway in Eastern Nepal, with an estimated total urban agglomerated population of 804,300 people living in 159,332 households. It is the largest city in the Koshi Province by Area. It covers 192.32 square kilometers while Biratnagar and Itahari is 2nd and 3rd biggest cities by Area

== Geography ==

Dharan is situated on the foothills of the Mahabharat Range in the north with its southern tip touching the edge of the Terai region at an altitude of 1148 ft (349m). Dharan bazaar grew up near Phusre where the old walking route to Dhankuta and a large part of the Eastern hills left the plains with the ascent of Sanghuri Danra. In the days when villagers in the hills made their annual trek to sell and buy goods this was a natural location for a market where hills and Terai met. In 1952 the construction of the Kosi barrage began and a narrow gauge railway was built to take stone from Phusre loaded at a locality now known as &quot;Railway&quot; to the site of the barrage near the Indian Border. The Koshi highway runs through the heart of the city thus connecting it with the provincial capital of Biratnagar as well as the Itahari junction of the east–west Mahendra highway (lying 41 km and 17 km south, respectively), and the Nepal-China border of Kimathanka (lying 115 km north). The road from Biratnagar was originally built and surfaced in connection with the building of Gopher Camp for the British Gurkhas. The road from Dharan to Dhankuta was financed by the UK and largely completed by 1982.

==History==

Dharan was the capital town of lowland Limbuwan kingdom of Morang. It was ruled by Limbu King Buddhi Karna Khebang. King Buddhikarna Khebang was the descendant of the ruler King Muray Hang Khebang of Phedap Kingdom . Since 1584 AD till 1774 AD, Dharan-Bijaypur was the capital city of Morang Kingdom of Limbuwan. It was also effective capital of the entire Limbuwan region or Ten Limbu Kingdoms which was also known as Pallo Kirat . Thus, in August 1774, the Gorkha King Prithivi Narayan Shah&#x27;s representatives Abhiman Singh Basnet, Parath Bhandari, Kirti Singh Khawas and Bali Baniya met the ministers of Morang state and agreed to come to good terms with the Gorkha Kingdom and accept the Gorkhali king as Maharaja and that in return the kingdom of Gorkha would retain the right of self-government of Limbu rulers in their kingdoms.

City, which is connected with the historical importance of Bijaypur started its development since 1985 BS. Then Prime minister Chandra Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana established Chandra nagar (now purano bazaar) and primeminister Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana
established Juddha nagar (now naya bazaar). City abstracted its name after &quot;Dharan&quot; (nepali word) a rectangular hollow dug under the ground and a low platform upon it for sawing logs with a big saw; one person on the platform and other below it. And, after the establishment of Dharan city, logs used to be widely split up here in &quot;Dharan&quot;. It took its present shape when Bijaypur village panchayat and Ghopa village panchayat were merged into Dharan municipality in 2035 BS.

<doc id="1270154" wikidata="Q3137684" url="?curid=1270154" title="Pre-colonial history of the Democratic Republic of the Congo">
<text>The pre-colonial history of the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo encompasses the history of the Congo Basin region up to the establishment of European colonial rule in the era of New Imperialism and particularly the creation of the Congo Free State and its expansion into the interior after 1885. As the modern territorial boundaries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo did not exist in this period, it is inseparable from the wider pre-colonial histories of Central Africa, the Great Lakes and Rift Valley as well as the Atlantic World and Swahili coast.

The current territory of the Democratic Republic of Congo was occupied by humans in the Paleolithic at least 80,000 years ago. Waves of Bantu migrations from 2000 BC to 500 AD moved into the basin from the northwest and covered the precolonial states absorbed or overthrown by the colonial powers.

The Bantu migrations added to and displaced the indigenous Pygmy populations in the southern regions of the modern Congo states. The Bantu imported agriculture and iron-working techniques from West Africa into the area, as well as establishing the Bantu language family as the primary set of tongues for the Congolese. Subsequent migrations from the Darfur and Kurdufan regions of Sudan into the north of Congo, as well as East Africans migrating into the eastern Congo, added to the mix of ethnic groups.

==Paleolithic==

The area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as 90,000 years ago, as shown by the 1988 discovery of the Semliki harpoon at Katanda, one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found, and which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish.

In 1960 the Ishango bone tool was discovered, fashioned from the fibula of a baboon with a sharp piece of quartz affixed to one end, perhaps for engraving. It was first thought to be a tally stick, as it has a series of what has been interpreted as tally marks carved in three columns running the length of the tool, but some scientists have suggested that the groupings of the notches indicate a mathematical understanding that goes beyond counting. It is now believed to be more than 20,000 years old.

==Bantu migration==
The Bantu expansion is thought to have reached modern day DRC as well as Northern Angola and Zambia possibly as early as 500 BC, and then gradually started to expand southward.

Their propagation was accelerated by the adoption of pastoralism and of Iron Age technology. The people living in the south and southwest were hunter-gatherer groups, whose technology involved only minimal use of metal technologies. The development of metal tools during this time period revolutionized agriculture and animal husbandry. This led to the displacement of the hunter-gatherer groups in the east and southeast.

The 10th century marked the final expansion of the Bantu in West-Central Africa. A rising population soon made intricate local, regional and foreign commercial nets possible, forming networks that traded mostly in salt, iron and copper.

==Upemba culture==
In the 5th century, a society began to develop in the Upemba depression along the banks of the Lualaba River in Katanga. This culture, known as the Upemba, would eventually evolve into the more significant Luba Empire, as well as the Kingdom of Lunda.

The process in which the primitive original Upemba society transitioned into the Luba kingdom was gradual and complex. This transition ran without interruption, with several distinct societies developing out of the Upemba culture prior to the genesis of the Luba. Each of these societies based the foundation of their society on that of the one which preceded it (much in the way that many aspects of Roman culture were borrowed from the Greeks). The 5th century saw this societal evolution develop in the area around present day Kamilamba at the Kabambasee, which was followed and replaced by a number of other cultures which were based around the cities of Sanga and Katango.

The region in which these cultures appeared is particularly rich in ore and these civilizations began to develop and implement iron and copper technology, in addition to trading in ivory and other goods. The Upemba established a strong commercial demand for their metal technologies and were able to institute a long-range commercial net (the business connections extended over 1500 km, all the way to the Indian Ocean). Additionally, the region was endowed with favorable agricultural conditions and a wealth of fish and game.

Its strong economy and food-base allowed the region to become extremely wealthy. So wealthy, in fact, that cities and centralized government based on a chieftain system developed. The political institution of the chieftain became generally accepted and these rulers became increasingly powerful, especially at the end of the 16th century.

==Effects of geography and climate==
Additionally, it must be mentioned that, as is this case today, the Congo River and its tributaries, as well as climatic conditions in general, play a powerful role in shaping the lives of the inhabitants of the Congo. The rivers are and were tremendously important to regional trade and provide a vast natural network for such activities, in addition to providing a source of food and water to the population.

It must also be mentioned that the climate is a major force in the Congo, which is made up primarily of tropical rainforest that sees some of the highest annual rainfall in the world. This high amount of rainfall makes it difficult to sustain agriculture, and subsequently a large population because the soil is simply too watered-down and prone to periodic floods to produce large quantities of food. For this reason, the population of the Congo has maintained a low population in addition to an extremely low population density.

Also, much has been made about the large number of hunter-gatherer groups that inhabit the Congo, especially the Pygmy population. The reason for this particular life-style being so prominent in the Congo is geographical and climatic: the area is simply not capable of producing a large amount of food from agriculture, and as a result, a portion of the population has continued to hunt and gather because it is a much more sustainable way of life.

==Cultural practices==

===Religion and Spirituality===

The Congo region was home to a wide array of ethnicities and communities and therefore differing spiritual and religious practices. Due to the scarcity in precolonial documentation the exact nature and dates of development of some of these practices remain elusive. The religions practised in precolonial Congo were as far as is known animistic in nature. They believed that places, objects and creatures could possess a spiritual essence and practised ancestral worship. 

According to the religion practised by the Bakongo people the world is split into the world of the living and the world of the dead. Shamans known as Nganga can mediate between these two worlds. A specific characteristic of the Kongo religion is the so-called cosmogram. It is believed the highest god, next to other high gods, resides at the top of the world, the spirits and other deities living below, followed by the physical realm populated by humans and animals, with water existing in the middle where the two worlds meet.

When people die, their souls leave their bodies to travel to the realm of the dead, but can still be contacted or called upon by means of prayer. The dead talk to the living through dreams, omens or through shamans.

Similar characteristics are seen in the Baluba religion, where priests can also serve as intermediaries between the natural and supernatural world. The traditional religious beliefs of the Luba people included the concept of a Universal Creator, a Leza or the Supreme Being, a natural world and a supernatural world. The supernatural world was where ancestral spirits lived, and what one joined the afterlife if one lived a righteous life.

The Bakuba people from the Kingdom of Kuba believed in a single creator deity, named Bumba or m&#x27;Bombo. He is said to have originally existed alone in darkness, in a universe consisting of nothing but primordial water. The creation took place when he vomited the sun, moon, animals and then humanity.

===Cannibalism===
The attitudes towards cannibalism in the Congo region varied significantly, with certain cultures practicing cannibalism in certain contexts while in other cultures cannibalism was either only practiced by certain individuals or shunned altogether and its practitioners dehumanized.

A personal indigenous first-hand account of ritualistic cannibalism can be found in the life story of Disasi Makulo, as written down by his son Akambu Makulo. Disasi, an indigenous traveller from the Eastern Congo region reported that upon his return to his native village after years of travel the villagers proposed a large feast in celebration of his arrival. They meant to take two slaves and have them slaughtered and served as part of the celebration meal. 

The specific practice of sacrificing and consuming slaves could be found among other cultures as well, such as the Azande, Lufembe, Basongye, Batetela and Ngombe. The slaves were normally war captives, acquired through inter-communal warfare. These slaves could either be used for labour or human sacrifice, or sold in the Arab slave trade.
Another type of cannibalism centered around the (partial) consumption of fallen enemies during conflict. This type of cannibalism was for instance practised by the Manyema, Bukusu and Basimba militias and slaves from Congo, Uganda and Tanzania used by Arab slave traders like Tippu Tipp, who had claimed the Eastern Congo for himself and Sultan Bargash bin Said el Busaidi.  

The most infamous militia were the so-called Zappo Zap, a subgroup of the Basongye people. They had a habit of eating their fallen enemies, and were said to consider human meat a delicacy. These warrior cultures were also used by both the Leopoldian forces as well as the Arab slavers during the Congo-Arab war. During the 1892–1894 war between the Congo Free State and the Swahili-Arab city-states of Nyangwe and Kasongo in Eastern Congo, there were reports of widespread cannibalization of the bodies of defeated Arab combatants by the Batetela allies of Belgian commander Francis Dhanis.

After the defeat of the Arab slavers, many militias were incorporated into the colonial army of the Congo Free State, including the Zappo Zap. The African-american missionary William Henry Sheppard wrote an first-hand account of a Zappo Zap attack on a number of villages, including descriptions of cannibalism. 

Although cannibalism was indeed practiced in the (eastern) Congo region, some of contemporary accounts were the result of exaggeration and miscommunication. Communities could use the accusation of cannibalism as a tool to dehumanize enemy tribes, and uncritical missionaries may have written down these second-hand accounts as truth. Certain Congolese cultures considered certain internal diseases as a form of cannibalism, as they believed an evil spirit was consuming the victim from the inside. When these people died, their bodies were put down at a safe distance from the village and cut open to examine the internal organs for irregularities. The combination of the word &quot;cannibalism&quot; and the eviscerated remains may have led missionaries with a poor understanding of local languages and racialised bias to prematurely conclude that these communities practised cannibalism.

==Kingdom of Kongo (1390–1914)==

By the 13th century there were three main confederations of states in the western Congo Basin. In the east were the Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza, considered to be the oldest and most powerful, which likely included Nsundi, Mbata, Mpangu, and possibly Kundi and Okanga. South of these was Mpemba which stretched from modern-day Angola to the Congo River. It included various kingdoms such as Mpemba Kasi and Vunda. To its west across the Congo River was a confederation of three small states; Vungu (its leader), Kakongo, and Ngoyo.

The dominant political force of the Congo region prior to and during the initial arrival of Europeans was the Kingdom of Kongo. The Kongo was a state located primarily in the southwest portion of the modern Congo, and also occupying portions of northern Angola and Cabinda. At its greatest extent, the kingdom reached from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Kwango River in the east, and from the Point Noire in the north to the Loje River in the south.

The kingdom was headed by a king known as the Manikongo, who exercised his authority over the six provinces that constituted the Kongo kingdom and the Bakongo (Kongo peoples). When the Kongo Kingdom was at its political apex in the 15th and 16th centuries, the King, who had to be a male descendant of Wene, reigned supreme.

He was elected by a group of governors, usually the heads of important families and occasionally including Portuguese officials. The activities of the court were supported by an extensive system of civil servants, and the court itself usually consisted of numerous male relatives of the King.

The villages were often governed by lesser relatives of the King who were responsible to him. All members of government were invested with their power under the auspices of a ritual specialist. The Manikongo personally appointed a kind of governor for each of the six provinces to oversee each from his capital, Mbanza-Kongo. The city is now known by the same name as the capital of an Angolan province, but was for a time renamed by the Manikongo to &#x27;São Salvador&#x27; in an effort to adopt Portuguese culture.

In its prime, the Kingdom exacted taxes, forced labor, and collected fines from its citizens in order to prosper. At times, enslaved peoples, ivory, and copper were traded to the Europeans on the coast. The most important harbor was Mpinda (modern Soyo). In addition to the six provinces, the Kongo kingdom also established a sphere of influence in a number of outlying areas from which it was able to extract tribute.

The kingdom was also at the center of an extensive Central African trade network in which it traded and produced large quantities of ivory, as well as manufacturing copperware, raffia cloth, and pottery, along with other natural resources (The eastern region of the Congo [such as the province of Katanga] is particularly rich in mineral resources, especially diamonds). These trade goods would also form, in addition to slaves, the backbone of the Kongo&#x27;s trade with Europeans (primarily the Portuguese), upon their arrival.

The aforementioned slave trade was to be a significant factor in bringing about the end of Kongo, as the elites of the kingdom allowed European slave traders to eliminate a significant percentage of the population.

When King Álvaro I, came to the throne in an environment of contestation in 1568, he immediately had to fight invaders from the east (who some authorities believe were actually rebels within the country, either peasants or discontented nobles) called the &quot;Jagas&quot;. To do this, he had to enlist the aid of the Portuguese based at São Tomé, who sent an expedition under Francisco de Gouveia Sottomaior to assist. At the same time, however, Álvaro had to allow the Portuguese to establish a colony in his province of Luanda in the south of his country. Kongo provided the Portuguese with support in their war against the Kingdom of Ndongo, located in the interior east of Luanda, when Portugal went to war with it in 1579. Eventually the Portuguese would gain control over most of the surrounding territory which led to increasing tensions with the Kongo.

At the Battle of Ambuila in 1665, the Portuguese forces from Angola defeated the forces of king Antonio I of Kongo; Antonio was killed with many of his courtiers and the Luso-African author Manuel Roboredo, who had attempted to prevent this final war. Nevertheless, the country continued to exist, at least in name, for over two centuries, until the realm was divided among Portugal, Belgium, and France at the Conference of Berlin in 1884-1885.

==Luba Kingdom (1585-1889)==

The Luba Kingdom arose out of the Upemba culture and was founded by King Kongolo around 1585. His nephew and immediate, Kalala Ilunga, expanded into an Empire over neighbouring states on the upper left bank territories of the Lualaba River. At its peak, the empire had about a million people paying tribute to its king.

The Luba Empire&#x27;s success was due in large part to its development of a form of a government durable enough to withstand the disruptions of succession disputes and flexible enough to incorporate foreign leaders and governments. It was based on the twin principles of sacred kingship and rule by council. The Luba model of governing was so successful, it was adopted by the Lunda Kingdom and spread throughout Katanga and northern Angola as well as northwestern Zambia and its Luapula Province.

==Lunda Kingdom (1665-1887)==

The birth of the Lunda Kingdom is traced back to Ilunga Tshibinda who left his brother&#x27;s Luba Kingdom and married a princess from an area in the south of Katanga. Their son, Mwaant Yav or Mwata Yamvo formed the central Lunda Kingdom there with a population of about 175,000 and became its ruler from 1660 to 1665. His title and name was passed to his descendants and successors as rulers of the kingdom.

The Lunda kings became powerful militarily and then politically through marriage with descendants of the Luba kings. The Lunda people were able to settle and colonialize other areas and tribes, thus extending their empire through southwest Katanga into Angola and north-western Zambia, and eastwards across Katanga into what is now the Luapula Province of Zambia. The empire became a confederation of a number of kingdoms or chieftainships which enjoyed a degree of local autonomy (as long as tributes were paid), with Mwata Yamvo as paramount ruler, and a ruling council (following the Luba model) to assist with administration.

In the 18th Century a number of migrations took place from the Lunda Empire as far as the region to the south of Lake Tanganyika. The Bemba people under Chitimukulu migrated from the Lunda Kingdom to Northern Zambia. At the same time, a Lunda chief and warrior called Mwata Kazembe set up an Eastern Lunda kingdom in the valley of the Luapula River.
==Yeke Kingdom (1856–1891)==

The Yeke Kingdom (or Garanganze Kingdom) in Katanga was short-lived, existing from about 1856 to 1891 under one king, Msiri, a Nyamwezi (also known as &#x27;Yeke&#x27;) from Tabora in Tanzania who got himself appointed as successor to a Wasanga chief west of the Luapula River by defeating the chief&#x27;s Lunda enemies.

Once installed he conquered the neighbouring tribes and expanded the chieftainship into a kingdom, taking over the western territory of Mwata Kazembe and subjugating tribes in the southwest, on the trading route to Angola. When King Leopold II of Belgium and British diamond magnate Cecil Rhodes heard that the Yeke Kingdom controlled east-west trade and was rich in copper and possibly gold, they sent competing expeditions to try to negotiate a treaty with the kingdom.

The Stairs Expedition sent by Leopold under the flag of his Congo Free State was the winner of this scramble for Katanga when it met and killed Msiri (putting his head on a pole as a &#x27;lesson&#x27; to his people), and installed a successor who would sign Katanga over to Leopold. The chieftainship continues to this day under the title &quot;Mwami Mwenda&quot; (&#x27;Mwenda&#x27; was one of Msiri&#x27;s names).

==Kuba Federation==
The Kuba Kingdom, or more accurately, the Kuba Federation, was a political entity (one comprising a collection of approximately twenty Bantu ethnic groups) that began to develop out of a number of decentralized, ethnically Bantu states (namely the Luba, the Leele, and the Wongo ethnic groups).

The federation&#x27;s capital was Nsheng, which is now modern Mushenge. The name “Kuba” is derived from the term used by the Luba (whose kingdom lay to the south of the Kuba) for the civilization.

Because of its relative remoteness in the southern Congo, Kuba was largely spared the turmoil of both Euro-American and Arab slave trades. As a result, the civilization was able to maintain itself until the 19th century. Also due mainly to its location, even after King Leopold II of Belgium established the Congo Free State in 1885, the Kuba were able to sustain their federation, which comprised some 100,000 square kilometers and had a population of approximately 150,000 inhabitants.

The Belgians began attempting to gain the acceptance of the Kuba in the early 1880s; however, the gifts Belgium attempted to give were always rejected and king aMbweeky aMileng threatened to behead any foreign intruders. As a result of their fear of white foreigners, it was not until the African-American missionary William Sheppard made contact with the Kuba that a foreigner would gain their acceptance. This was mainly due to his African blood and Sheppard was able to live amongst the Kuba for four months.

Eventually, after colonial officials were able to enforce their authority upon the Kuba near the end of the 19th century, the entire region became increasingly unstable. However, the well-organized Kuba fought relentlessly against the regime and the area was one of the main sectors of resistance to Belgium throughout its rule.

==Other states==
The Kongo and the Kuba were the largest political entities in the precolonial Congo area. However, there were numerous other, much smaller states scattered throughout the territory in the north and northeast, with Pygmies and other primarily hunter-gatherer populations located mostly in the southern portions of the region.

Of particular note is that the populations of the Eastern regions of the precolonial Congo were heavily disrupted by constant slaving, mainly from Zanzibari slave dealers such as the infamous Tippu Tip (though he would come after the Europeans&#x27; entrance onto the scene). The slave trade in this portion of Africa was primarily Arab in nature (in contrast to the European or Atlantic Slave Trade, which took place primarily in West Africa, the Arab slave trade was located on the eastern coast of the continent), with captured persons being shipped off to the Middle East or to holdings of Arabian kingdoms for labor.

<text>Georg Alexander Pick (10 August 1859 – 26 July 1942) was an Austrian Jewish mathematician who was murdered during The Holocaust. He was born in Vienna to Josefa Schleisinger and Adolf Josef Pick and died at Theresienstadt concentration camp. Today he is best known for Pick&#x27;s theorem for determining the area of lattice polygons. He published it in an article in 1899; it was popularized when Hugo Dyonizy Steinhaus included it in the 1969 edition of Mathematical Snapshots.

== Education and career ==
Pick studied at the University of Vienna and defended his Ph.D. in 1880 under Leo Königsberger and Emil Weyr. After receiving his doctorate he was appointed an assistant to Ernst Mach at the Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague. He became a lecturer there in 1881. He took a leave from the university in 1884 during which he worked with Felix Klein at the University of Leipzig. Other than that year, he remained in Prague until his retirement in 1927 at which time he returned to Vienna.

Pick headed the committee at the (then) German university of Prague, which appointed Albert Einstein to a chair of mathematical physics in 1911. Pick introduced Einstein to the work of Italian mathematicians Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita in the field of absolute differential calculus, which later in 1915 helped Einstein to successfully formulate general relativity.

Charles Loewner was one of his students in Prague. He also directed the doctoral theses of Josef Grünwald, Walter Fröhlich, and Saly Struik. Pick was elected a member of the , but was expelled after Nazis took over Prague.

After retiring in 1927, Pick returned to Vienna, the city where he was born. After the Anschluss when the Nazis marched into Austria on 12 March 1938, Pick returned to Prague. In March 1939 the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia. Pick was sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp on 13 July 1942. He died there two weeks later.

<doc id="1270157" wikidata="Q822127" url="?curid=1270157" title="New Jersey Route 25">
<text>Route 25 was a major state highway in New Jersey, United States prior to the 1953 renumbering, running from the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Camden to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City. The number was retired in the renumbering, as the whole road was followed by various U.S. Routes: US 30 coming off the bridge in Camden, US 130 from the Camden area north to near New Brunswick, US 1 to Tonnele Circle in Jersey City, and US 1 Business (since renamed Route 139) to the Holland Tunnel.

Route 1 largely became Route 25 in the 1927 renumbering. Route 25 was best known for the Route 1 Extension, which became the first controlled-access highway or &quot;super-highway&quot; in the United States that also connected the high traffic volume from the Holland Tunnel to the rest of New Jersey (with roads to other state destinations). The Holland Tunnel was the first vehicular connection between New York City and New Jersey, which are separated by the Hudson River.

The Route 1 Extension was built between 1925 and 1932 and was best known for the Pulaski Skyway. The skyway and portions of the currently designated Route 139 have been listed on the federal and NJ state registers of historic places since 2005 as part of a nominated portion of the Route 1 Extension.

==History==
===Routes 1 and 2: 1916-1927===
In 1916, two routes were defined by the state legislature:
*Route 1, from the south border of Elizabeth via Rahway and Metuchen to the north border of New Brunswick, and from the south border of New Brunswick via Hightstown and Robbinsville to the east border of Trenton.
*Route 2, from the south border of Trenton via White Horse, Bordentown and Burlington to the north border of Camden.

Route 1 used the existing Lincoln Highway from Elizabeth to New Brunswick, except for two sections between Rahway and New Brunswick (where the Lincoln Highway largely used the old Essex and Middlesex Turnpike). A new alignment was built on the northwest side of the Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor) in Woodbridge Township and Edison to avoid two grade crossings, and a detour around existing streets was made in Metuchen to avoid another one in favor of a tunnel. This route, including the realignments, was taken over in 1919, except between the south border of Rahway and downtown Metuchen, which was acquired in 1918.

South of New Brunswick, Route 1 used the old New Brunswick and Cranbury Turnpike (Georges Road) to Cranbury and the Bordentown and South Amboy Turnpike to Robbinsville. At Robbinsville, it turned west on Nottingham Way, running to the Trenton line on Greenwood Avenue. This section was all taken over in 1919.

Route 2 left Trenton on Broad Street, known as the White Horse Road, to White Horse. At White Horse it turned south on what was known as the White Horse Road Extension and Trenton Road, intersecting the Bordentown and South Amboy Turnpike northeast of Bordentown. There it turned southwest along the turnpike, named Park Street in Bordentown, continuing on the Florence Road (old Burlington Turnpike) through Florence Township to Burlington. From Burlington, Route 2 kept going southwest on the Westfield and Camden Turnpike, ending at the Camden border at Westfield Avenue. This was also taken over in 1919.

Several amendments in 1922 added to the routes. Route 2 was extended southwest through Camden to the proposed Benjamin Franklin Bridge, and a spur was added from Five Points northwest to the Tacony-Palmyra Ferry. More important was the extension of Route 1 north to the planned Holland Tunnel.

===Route 1 Extension: 1922-1932===

The Route 1 Extension is considered to be the first controlled-access highway or &quot;super-highway&quot; in the United States. The highway was built to carry large amounts of traffic from the Holland Tunnel to the rest of New Jersey. The south end of the extension was at Edgar Road in Linden, just south of Elizabeth and the Bayway Circle. Edgar Road had been built as a turnpike in the 19th century, and now serves as part of U.S. Route 1/9 south of the extension.

The road was built from 1925 to 1932. All, but the Pulaski Skyway, was finished by 1930. It was a full freeway, mostly elevated on embankments or viaducts, from four blocks west of the Holland Tunnel to just north of Newark Airport, and a high-speed surface road from there to Elizabeth (and beyond).

In summer of 1923, the NJ State Highway Commission decided that it would be an entirely new route, from the Lincoln Highway (Route 1) southwest of Elizabeth to the Holland Tunnel. Existing roads, which passed through downtown Newark, were already experiencing major congestion. Frederick Lavis, Assistant Construction Engineer of the New Jersey State Highway Department, explained this decision:
:&quot;The new highway will be the easterly end of the Lincoln Highway and will carry the greater part of the travel between New Jersey coast resorts, and Trenton, Philadelphia and points south of New York. It was to be made part of one of the main through routes from and to New York. It was stated that this route would undoubtedly be used as a main artery of transportation by trucks carrying freight from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and adjacent points to and from New York.&quot;
:&quot;It was reported that the highway will assume many of the characteristics of a railway, except that the rolling stock will be autos and auto trucks. It was pointed out that in order that the maximum amount of traffic could pass, the highway would have to be free from interruption.&quot; 
It was also decided that the road would have a minimum width of , which would be enough room for five lanes. The center one was intended as a vehicle breakdown lane since there were no shoulders, but was used as a &quot;suicide lane&quot; for passing slower traffic. At the time, it often took two or three hours to go the from New York City to the far border of Elizabeth, and the new highway would reduce travel time by over an hour. Grades would be at most 3.5%, and roadway curves would have radii of at least .

====Construction====
As part of the Holland Tunnel project, the New Jersey Interstate Bridge and Tunnel Commission and the New York State Bridge and Tunnel Commission widened the four blocks of 12th and 14th Streets in Jersey City from Jersey Avenue to Provost Street. 12th Street was widened west of Grove Street to , with the remaining block, at the toll plaza, being wide. 14th Street, and the two blocks of Jersey Avenue carrying westbound traffic to the 12th Street Viaduct, were widened to .

As part of the project, current U.S. Route 1-9 Truck was built under the Pennsylvania Railroad at Charlotte Circle and east to Tonnele Circle. This was bypassed by the Pulaski Skyway, the last part of the route to be built. Prior to its completion, traffic used what is now US 1-9 Truck.

The city of Elizabeth opposed the alignment along Spring Street, preferring the use of Division Street, but lost the argument.
===Route 25: 1927-1953===
 Route 1 largely became Route 25 in the 1927 renumbering and Route 1 again in the 1953 highway renumbering in New Jersey.

In the 1927 renumbering, the majority of the Jersey City-Camden corridor, made of Routes 1 and 2, was assigned Route 25. The one major difference was near Trenton; the new Route 25 bypassed Trenton via the old Bordentown and South Amboy Turnpike, cutting from Route 1 at Robbinsville southwest to Route 2 at Bordentown. Route 1 west from Robbinsville to Trenton became part of Route 33, and Route 2 became part of Route 37 from Trenton to White Horse and Route 39 from White Horse to Bordentown. Additionally, the former Route 1 between Elizabeth and New Brunswick became part of Route 27; a new alignment was planned from Elizabeth to south of New Brunswick, running east of the existing road and connecting directly with the Route 1 Extension. The short spur to the Tacony-Palmyra Ferry became Route S41N.

Also in 1927, U.S. Route 1 was assigned to Route 25 north of the New Brunswick area (temporarily signed along Route 27 until Route 25 was finished) and U.S. Route 130 was assigned south to Camden.

North of New Brunswick, the new wide alignment was completed September 27, 1930; the last part to open was the reconstruction of Edgar Road through Linden, held up by a grade crossing elimination with the Baltimore and New York Railway. The part of old Route 1 to the south border of New Brunswick became Route 25M. The Pulaski Skyway opened in 1932. Sources disagree about whether the old route (U.S. Route 1-9 Truck) became another Route 25M, Route 25T, or an un-suffixed section of 25. (The eastern half of the old road was part of post-1927 New Jersey Route 1.)

The embankment in Newark was doubled in 1949 with a new four-lane northbound roadway.

The Port of New York Authority, which superseded the two state tunnel commissions and took over authority for the Holland Tunnel, built the 14th Street Viaduct in order to avoid the turns to and from Jersey Avenue, but turned over authority over the viaduct to the New Jersey State Highway Commission. The four-lane, westbound viaduct, which was connected to the 12th Street Viaduct, was opened on February 13, 1951. 

Many bypasses were built south of New Brunswick:
*Burlington, (as Route 2), (ca. 1925)
*Pennsauken Township to Airport Circle east of Camden, (ca. 1927)
*Bordentown, (ca. 1928)
*Completed from Airport Circle west to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, (now U.S. Route 30), (ca. 1929)
*Hightstown and Cranbury, (ca. 1937)
*South Brunswick Township, (ca. 1942)
*Yardville, (the old road became Route 156), (ca. 1952)

In the 1953 renumbering, the whole route was decommissioned in favor of the U.S. Routes that were signed along it - US 30, US 130, US 1 and US 1 Business.

<text>Łodwigowo () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Grunwald, within Ostróda County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland. It lies approximately south-east of Ostróda and south-west of the regional capital Olsztyn. It is located in the historic region of Masuria.

==History==
The village surely existed in the 14th century. It is close to the site of the Battle of Grunwald (1410), which is commemorated by a museum and memorial site. It was devastated during the Polish-Teutonic wars, and then refounded by Polish people.

<text>Langtang Valley () also known as Lamtang Valley is a Himalayan valley in the mountains of north-central Nepal, known for its trekking routes and natural environment. 

== Administrative ==
The Langtang Valley lies in Rasuwa district of the Bagmati Province in Nepal. Situated about 80 kilometres north of the Kathmandu Valley, the valley lies within the Langtang National Park, which borders the Tibet Autonomous Region in Southwest China. Prior to the 2015 earthquake, 668 individuals were estimated to be living within the valley. 

== Ecology ==
The Langtang Valley lies within the Langtang National Park. The park contains a wide variety of climatic zones, from subtropical to alpine. Approximately 25% of the park is forested. Trees include the deciduous oak and maple, evergreens like pine, and various types of rhododendron. Animal life includes the Himalayan black bear, Himalayan tahr, Red monkey, languer Assam macaque, snow leopard, yak, red panda and more than 250 species of birds.

== Culture ==
Among themselves, the local inhabitants of the Langtang valley refer to each other as &#x27;Langtangpa&#x27;. They generally follow Tibetan Buddhism, and speak a Tibetan language that is closely related to the Tibetan spoken in Kyirong, southern Tibet. The Langtangpas regard the mountain Langtang Lirung as their &#x27;yu-lha&#x27;, their local country god. However, in the state census, the Langtangpas are categorised as Tamang. Langtang valley is believed to be the Beyul Dagam Namgo, one of the many hidden valleys blessed by Guru Padmasambhava. 

== Economy ==
The traditional livelihoods of the Langtangpas have centered around agropastoralism. Since the mid-1970s, tourism has grown to become an important source of livelihoods in the Langtang Valley. Swiss cheese-making was introduced in Langtang in the 1950s by Werner Schulthess. Over time, Swiss cheese became a popular product of Langtang, and its production in the valley continues to this day.

== Access ==
The nearest motorable roadhead for the Langtang Valley is Syaphrubesi, which is also the base for most treks into the Langtang Valley. The distance of Syaphrubesi from Kathmandu is 113 km. But due to bad road conditions, it usually takes 6-8 hours to drive from Kathmandu to Syaphrubesi. Just as for the Langtang National Park, entering the Langtang Valley requires everyone except locals to have the TIMS permit and the Langtang National Park entry permit.

== Tourism ==
The Langtang Valley trek, from Syaphrubesi to Kyanjin Gompa and back, is the third most popular trek in Nepal, after the Annapurna Circuit and Everest Base Camp (EBC) treks. Several treks go through the Langtang valley and link it to nearby valleys, like the Helambu valley. In most of these treks, one can stay at local &#x27;tea houses&#x27;, which are run by locals in nearly every village in the valley, and where one gets basic lodging and food. Around 2000, with the support of the United Nations Development Programme, some of these were equipped with solar panels so that hikers could shower with warm water. There are also several mountain-climbing options available in the Langtang valley, ranging from relatively easy-to-climb peaks around 5,000 m high, such as Kyanjin Ri and Tsergo Ri, to technically challenging peaks, such as Dorje Lhakpa and Langtang Lirung.

== 2015 Nepal earthquake ==
The village of Langtang was almost completely destroyed (1 building survived) by a massive avalanche caused by the April 2015 Nepal earthquake. The village suffered an estimated 310 deaths, including 176 Langtang residents, 80 foreigners, and 10 army personnel. More than 100 bodies were never recovered. Several other villages in upper Langtang valley were also destroyed. The Langtangpas who survived the destruction of the earthquake were evacuated by helicopter to Kathmandu, where a displaced persons camp was temporarily set up at the Yellow Gumba near Swayanmbhu. Many Langtangpas returned to the valley in the following months, and a significant amount of reconstruction was completed within the first year after the earthquake. By early 2018, the centuries-old gompa at Kyanjin Gompa, which had also been destroyed in the earthquake, had been rebuilt. The Swiss-cheese factory at Kyanjin Gompa village was destroyed too, but has been rebuilt and since then become operational again.

== Climate change ==
Since the mid-2010s, Langtangpas have noticed that most natural springs in the valley have gone dry. Scientists have attributed the reduction in the glacier area of the Langtang glacier directly to anthropogenic climate change since the 1970s. The intergovernmental organisation ICIMOD conducts periodic cryospheric research in the Langtang valley and Yala Glacier.

== Langtang Himal ==
Langtang Himal is a mountain range in the Himalayas which includes the following peaks:

<doc id="1270187" wikidata="Q856535" url="?curid=1270187" title="Current transformer">
<text>A current transformer (CT) is a type of transformer that reduces or multiplies alternating current (AC), producing a current in its secondary which is proportional to the current in its primary.

Current transformers, along with voltage or potential transformers, are instrument transformers, which scale the large values of voltage or current to small, standardized values that are easy to handle for measuring instruments and protective relays. Instrument transformers isolate measurement or protection circuits from the high voltage of the primary system. A current transformer presents a negligible load to the primary circuit.

Current transformers are the current-sensing units of the power system and are used at generating stations, electrical substations, and in industrial and commercial electric power distribution.

==Function==


A current transformer has a primary winding, a core, and a secondary winding, although some transformers use an air core. While the physical principles are the same, the details of a &quot;current&quot; transformer compared with a &quot;voltage&quot; transformer will differ owing to different requirements of the application. A current transformer is designed to maintain an accurate ratio between the currents in its primary and secondary circuits over a defined range.

The alternating current in the primary produces an alternating magnetic field in the core, which then induces an alternating current in the secondary. The primary circuit is largely unaffected by the insertion of the CT. Accurate current transformers need close coupling between the primary and secondary to ensure that the secondary current is proportional to the primary current over a wide current range. The current in the secondary is the current in the primary (assuming a single turn primary) divided by the number of turns of the secondary. In the illustration on the right, &#x27;I&#x27; is the current in the primary, &#x27;B&#x27; is the magnetic field, &#x27;N&#x27; is the number of turns on the secondary, and &#x27;A&#x27; is an AC ammeter.

Current transformers typically consist of a silicon steel ring core wound with many turns of copper wire, as shown in the illustration to the right. The conductor carrying the primary current is passed through the ring. The CT&#x27;s primary, therefore, consists of a single &#x27;turn&#x27;. The primary &#x27;winding&#x27; may be a permanent part of the current transformer, i.e., a heavy copper bar to carry current through the core. Window-type current transformers are also common, which can have circuit cables run through the middle of an opening in the core to provide a single-turn primary winding. To assist accuracy, the primary conductor should be centered in the aperture.

CTs are specified by their current ratio from primary to secondary. The rated secondary current is normally standardized at 1 or 5 amperes. For example, a 4000:5 CT secondary winding will supply an output current of 5 amperes when the primary winding current is 4000 amperes. This ratio can also be used to find the impedance or voltage on one side of the transformer, given the appropriate value at the other side. For the 4000:5 CT, the secondary impedance can be found as , and the secondary voltage can be found as . In some cases, the secondary impedance is &quot;referred&quot; to the primary side, and is found as . Referring the impedance is done simply by multiplying initial secondary impedance value by the current ratio. The secondary winding of a CT can have taps to provide a range of ratios, five taps being common.

Current transformer shapes and sizes vary depending on the end-user or switch gear manufacturer. Low-voltage single ratio metering current transformers are either a ring type or plastic molded case.

Split-core current transformers either have a two-part core or a core with a removable section. This allows the transformer to be placed around a conductor without disconnecting it first. Split-core current transformers are typically used in low current measuring instruments, often portable, battery-operated, and hand-held (see illustration lower right).

== Use ==

Current transformers are used extensively for measuring current and monitoring the operation of the power grid. Along with voltage leads, revenue-grade CTs drive the electrical utility&#x27;s watt-hour meter on many larger commercial and industrial supplies.

High-voltage current transformers are mounted on porcelain or polymer insulators to isolate them from ground. Some CT configurations slip around the bushing of a high-voltage transformer or circuit breaker, which automatically centers the conductor inside the CT window.

Current transformers can be mounted on the low voltage or high voltage leads of a power transformer. Sometimes a section of a bus bar can be removed to replace a current transformer.

Often, multiple CTs are installed as a &quot;stack&quot; for various uses. For example, protection devices and revenue metering may use separate CTs to provide isolation between metering and protection circuits and allows current transformers with different characteristics (accuracy, overload performance) to be used for the devices.

In the United States, the National Electrical Code (NEC) requires residual current devices in commercial and residential electrical systems to protect outlets installed in &quot;wet&quot; locations such as kitchens and bathrooms, as well as weatherproof outlets installed outdoors. Such devices, most commonly ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs), typically run both the 120-volt energized conductor and the neutral return conductor through a current transformer, with the secondary coil connected to a trip device.

Under normal conditions, the current in the two circuit wires will be equal and flow in opposite directions, resulting in zero net current through the CT and no current in the secondary coil. If the supply current is redirected downstream into the third (ground) circuit conductor (e.g., if the grounded metallic case of a power tool contacts a 120-volt conductor), or into earth ground (e.g., if a person contacts a 120-volt conductor), the neutral return current will be less than the supply current, resulting in a positive net current flow through the CT. This net current flow will induce current in the secondary coil, which will cause the trip device to operate and de-energize the circuit - typically within 0.2 seconds.

The burden (load) impedance should not exceed the specified maximum value to avoid the secondary voltage exceeding the limits for the current transformer. The primary current rating of a current transformer should not be exceeded, or the core may enter its non-linear region and ultimately saturate. This would occur near the end of the first half of each half (positive and negative) of the AC sine wave in the primary and compromise accuracy.

== Safety ==
Current transformers are often used to monitor high currents or currents at high voltages. Technical standards and design practices are used to ensure the safety of installations using current transformers.

The secondary of a current transformer should not be disconnected from its burden while current is in the primary, as the secondary will attempt to continue driving current into an effective infinite impedance potentially generating high voltages and thus compromising operator safety. For certain current transformers, this voltage may reach several kilovolts and may cause arcing. Exceeding the secondary voltage may also degrade the accuracy of the transformer or destroy it. Output voltage in open operation is limited by core saturation since the primary flux is no longer canceled by secondary flux, smaller current transformers may not actually incur dangerous voltages when operating nominally. Faster current transients from loads being switched on etc. can however still induce dangerous voltage levels due to high current slope.

== Accuracy ==
The accuracy of a CT is affected by a number of factors including:
* Burden
* Burden class/saturation class
* Rating factor
* Load
* External electromagnetic fields
* Temperature
* Physical configuration
* The selected tap, for multi-ratio CTs
* Phase change
* Capacitive coupling between primary and secondary
* Resistance of primary and secondary
* Core magnetizing current

Accuracy classes for various types of measurement and at standard loads in the secondary circuit (burdens) are defined in IEC 61869-1 as classes 0.1, 0.2s, 0.2, 0.5, 0.5s, 1 and 3. The class designation is an approximate measure of the CT&#x27;s accuracy. The ratio (primary to secondary current) error of a Class 1 CT is 1% at rated current; the ratio error of a Class 0.5 CT is 0.5% or less. Errors in phase are also important, especially in power measuring circuits. Each class has an allowable maximum phase error for a specified load impedance.

Current transformers used for protective relaying also have accuracy requirements at overload currents in excess of the normal rating to ensure accurate performance of relays during system faults. A CT with a rating of 2.5L400 specifies with an output from its secondary winding of twenty times its rated secondary current (usually ) and 400 V (IZ drop) its output accuracy will be within 2.5 percent.

=== Burden ===
The secondary load of a current transformer is termed the &quot;burden&quot; to distinguish it from the primary load.

The burden in a CT metering electrical network is largely resistive impedance presented to its secondary winding. Typical burden ratings for IEC CTs are 1.5 VA, 3 VA, 5 VA, 10 VA, 15 VA, 20 VA, 30 VA, 45 VA and 60 VA. ANSI/IEEE burden ratings are B-0.1, B-0.2, B-0.5, B-1.0, B-2.0 and B-4.0. This means a CT with a burden rating of B-0.2 will maintain its stated accuracy with up to 0.2 Ω on the secondary circuit. These specification diagrams show accuracy parallelograms on a grid incorporating magnitude and phase angle error scales at the CT&#x27;s rated burden. Items that contribute to the burden of a current measurement circuit are switch-blocks, meters and intermediate conductors. The most common cause of excess burden impedance is the conductor between the meter and the CT. When substation meters are located far from the meter cabinets, the excessive length of cable creates a large resistance. This problem can be reduced by using thicker cables and CTs with lower secondary currents (1 A), both of which will produce less voltage drop between the CT and its metering devices.

===Knee-point core-saturation voltage===
The knee-point voltage of a current transformer is the magnitude of the secondary voltage above which the output current ceases to linearly follow the input current within declared accuracy. In testing, if a voltage is applied across the secondary terminals the magnetizing current will increase in proportion to the applied voltage, until the knee point is reached. The knee point is defined as the voltage at which a 10% increase in applied voltage increases the magnetizing current by 50%. For voltages greater than the knee point, the magnetizing current increases considerably even for small increments in voltage across the secondary terminals. The knee-point voltage is less applicable for metering current transformers as their accuracy is generally much higher but constrained within a very small range of the current transformer rating, typically 1.2 to 1.5 times rated current. However, the concept of knee point voltage is very pertinent to protection current transformers, since they are necessarily exposed to fault currents of 20 to 30 times rated current.

===Phase shift===
Ideally, the primary and secondary currents of a current transformer should be in phase. In practice, this is impossible, but, at normal power frequencies, phase shifts of a few tenths of a degree are achievable, while simpler CTs may have larger phase shifts. For current measurement, phase shift is immaterial as ammeters only display the magnitude of the current. However, in wattmeters, energy meters, and power factor, phase shift produces errors. For power and energy measurement, the errors are considered to be negligible at unity power factor but become more significant as the power factor approaches zero. The introduction of electronic power and energy meters has allowed current phase error to be calibrated out.

==Construction==
Bar-type current transformers have terminals for source and load connections of the primary circuit, and the body of the current transformer provides insulation between the primary circuit and ground. By use of oil insulation and porcelain bushings, such transformers can be applied at the highest transmission voltages.
Ring-type current transformers are installed over a bus bar or an insulated cable and have only a low level of insulation on the secondary coil. To obtain non-standard ratios or for other special purposes, more than one turn of the primary cable may be passed through the ring. Where a metal shield is present in the cable jacket, it must be terminated so no net sheath current passes through the ring, to ensure accuracy. Current transformers used to sense ground fault (zero sequence) currents, such as in a three-phase installation, may have three primary conductors passed through the ring. Only the net unbalanced current produces a secondary current - this can be used to detect a fault from an energized conductor to ground. Ring-type transformers usually use dry insulation systems, with a hard rubber or plastic case over the secondary windings.

For temporary connections, a split ring-type current transformer can be slipped over a cable without disconnecting it. This type has a laminated iron core, with a hinged section that allows it to be installed over the cable; the core links the magnetic flux produced by the single turn primary winding to a wound secondary with many turns. Because the gaps in the hinged segment introduce inaccuracy, such devices are not normally used for revenue metering. 

Current transformers, especially those intended for high voltage substation service, may have multiple taps on their secondary windings, providing several ratios in the same device. This can be done to allow for reduced inventory of spare units, or to allow for load growth in an installation. A high-voltage current transformer may have several secondary windings with the same primary, to allow for separate metering and protection circuits, or for connection to different types of protective devices. For example, one secondary may be used for branch overcurrent protection, while a second winding may be used in a bus differential protective scheme, and a third winding used for power and current measurement.

==Special types==
Specially constructed &quot;wideband current transformers&quot; are also used (usually with an oscilloscope) to measure waveforms of high frequency or pulsed currents within pulsed power systems. Unlike CTs used for power circuitry, wideband CTs are rated in output volts per ampere of primary current.

If the burden resistance is much less than inductive impedance of the secondary winding at the measurement frequency then the current in the secondary tracks the primary current and the transformer provides a current output that is proportional to the measured current. On the other hand, if that condition is not true, then the transformer is inductive and gives a differential output. The Rogowski coil uses this effect and requires an external integrator in order to provide a voltage output that is proportional to the measured current.

==Standards==
Ultimately, depending on client requirements, there are two main standards to which current transformers are designed. IEC 61869-1 (in the past IEC 60044-1) &amp; IEEE C57.13 (ANSI), although the Canadian and Australian standards are also recognised.

==High voltage types==
Current transformers are used for protection, measurement and control in high-voltage electrical substations and the electrical grid. Current transformers may be installed inside switchgear or in apparatus bushings, but very often free-standing outdoor current transformers are used. In a switchyard, &quot;live tank&quot; current transformers have a substantial part of their enclosure energized at the line voltage and must be mounted on insulators. &quot;Dead tank&quot; current transformers isolate the measured circuit from the enclosure. Live tank CTs are useful because the primary conductor is short, which gives better stability and a higher short-circuit current rating. The primary of the winding can be evenly distributed around the magnetic core, which gives better performance for overloads and transients. Since the major insulation of a live-tank current transformer is not exposed to the heat of the primary conductors, insulation life and thermal stability is improved.

A high-voltage current transformer may contain several cores, each with a secondary winding, for different purposes (such as metering circuits, control, or protection). A neutral current transformer is used as earth fault protection to measure any fault current flowing through the neutral line from the wye neutral point of a transformer.

<text>Verus (died 219) was a Roman usurper.

Verus was a centurion, who had successfully raised to the rank of Roman Senator. He was the commander of the Legio III &quot;Gallica&quot;, a legion located in Syria, which supported Elagabalus bid for power (218).

Soon, however, the soldiers disenchanted with the reign of Elagabalus, and in the winter 218–219 Verus took the opportunity, proclaiming himself Roman Emperor, and leading the rebellion of the Third legion. However, Elagabalus had Verus executed, dispersed the legion and stripped Tyre, where its headquarters were, of its status of metropolis.

<text>A commodity pool is an investment structure where many individual investors combine their moneys and trade in futures contracts as a single entity in order to gain leverage. They are analogous to mutual funds wherein a fund is similarly set up expressly for trading in equity, except that mutual funds are open to public subscription whereas commodity pools and hedge funds are private.

Commodity pools are also called &quot;managed futures funds&quot;. The name &quot;commodity pool&quot; is a National Futures Association (NFA) legal term. In the United States, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the NFA, as opposed to the Securities and Exchange Commission, regulate commodity pools.

Many hedge funds are commodity pools. Funds that trade in commodities, which include many of the largest funds engaged in macro-strategies, are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as commodity pools and as commodity trading advisors (CTAs). In an address to the Securities Industry Association in 2004, Sharon Brown-Hruska, acting director of the CFTC, said that 65 of the top 100 funds in 2003 were commodity pools, and 50 out of the 100 largest hedge funds were CTAs in addition to being commodity pools.

<text>The Jönköping Regiment (), designation I 12, was a Swedish Army infantry regiment that traced its origins back to the 16th century. It was merged with another unit to form a new regiment in 1927. The regiment&#x27;s soldiers were originally recruited from Jönköping County, and it was later garrisoned there.

== History ==
The regiment has its origins in fänikor (companies) raised in Jönköping County in the 1550s and 1560s. In 1619, these units—along with fänikor from the nearby province of Östergötland—were organised by Gustav II Adolf into Östergötlands storregemente, of which eleven of the total 24 companies were recruited in Jönköping County. Östergötlands storregemente consisted of three field regiments, of which Jönköping Regiment was one. Sometime between 1623 and 1628, the grand regiment was permanently split into three smaller regiments, of which Jönköping Regiment was one.

Jönköping Regiment was one of the original 20 Swedish infantry regiments mentioned in the Swedish constitution of 1634, although it was mentioned as one of two regiments that should merge to form Småland Regiment, but that regiment was never formed and instead Jönköping Regiment and Kronoberg Regiment were kept separate. The regiment&#x27;s first commander was Lars Kagg. The regiment was allotted in 1684. The regiment was given the designation I 12 (12th Infantry Regiment) in a general order in 1816. Jönköping Regiment was garrisoned in Jönköping from 1909, before it was merged with Kalmar Regiment to form Jönköping-Kalmar Regiment in 1927.

<doc id="1270246" wikidata="Q83571" url="?curid=1270246" title="Federated database system">
<text>A federated database system (FDBS) is a type of meta-database management system (DBMS), which transparently maps multiple autonomous database systems into a single federated database. The constituent databases are interconnected via a computer network and may be geographically decentralized. Since the constituent database systems remain autonomous, a federated database system is a contrastable alternative to the (sometimes daunting) task of merging several disparate databases. A federated database, or virtual database, is a composite of all constituent databases in a federated database system. There is no actual data integration in the constituent disparate databases as a result of data federation.

Through data abstraction, federated database systems can provide a uniform user interface, enabling users and clients to store and retrieve data from multiple noncontiguous databases with a single query—even if the constituent databases are heterogeneous. To this end, a federated database system must be able to decompose the query into subqueries for submission to the relevant constituent DBMSs, after which the system must composite the result sets of the subqueries. Because various database management systems employ different query languages, federated database systems can apply wrappers to the subqueries to translate them into the appropriate query languages.

==Definition==
McLeod and Heimbigner were among the first to define a federated database system in the mid-1980s.

A FDBS is one which &quot;define[s] the architecture and interconnect[s] databases that minimize central authority yet support partial sharing and coordination among database systems&quot;. This description might not accurately reflect the McLeod/Heimbigner definition of a federated database. Rather, this description fits what McLeod/Heimbigner called a &quot;composite&quot; database. McLeod/Heimbigner&#x27;s federated database is a collection of autonomous components that make their data available to other members of the federation through the publication of an export schema and access operations; there is no unified, central schema that encompasses the information available from the members of the federation.

Among other surveys, practitioners define a Federated Database as a collection of cooperating component systems which are autonomous and are possibly heterogeneous.

The three important components of an FDBS are autonomy, heterogeneity and distribution. Another dimension which has also been considered is the Networking Environment Computer Network, e.g., many DBSs over a LAN or many DBSs over a WAN update related functions of participating DBSs (e.g., no updates, nonatomic transitions, atomic updates).

== FDBS architecture ==

A DBMS can be classified as either centralized or distributed. A centralized system manages a single database while distributed manages multiple databases. A component DBS in a DBMS may be centralized or distributed. A multiple DBS (MDBS) can be classified into two types depending on the autonomy of the component DBS as federated and non federated. A nonfederated database system is an integration of component DBMS that are not autonomous.
A federated database system consists of component DBS that are autonomous yet participate in a federation to allow partial and controlled sharing of their data.

Federated architectures differ based on levels of integration with the component database systems and the extent of services offered by the federation. A FDBS can be categorized as loosely or tightly coupled systems.

* Loosely Coupled require component databases to construct their own federated schema. A user will typically access other component database systems by using a multidatabase language but this removes any levels of location transparency, forcing the user to have direct knowledge of the federated schema. A user imports the data they require from other component databases and integrates it with their own to form a federated schema.
* Tightly coupled system consists of component systems that use independent processes to construct and publicize an integrated federated schema.

Multiple DBS of which FDBS are a specific type can be characterized along three dimensions: Distribution, Heterogeneity and Autonomy. Another characterization could be based on the dimension of networking, for example single databases or multiple databases in a LAN or WAN.

=== Distribution ===

Distribution of data in an FDBS is due to the existence of a multiple DBS before an FDBS is built. Data can be distributed among multiple databases which could be stored in a single computer or multiple computers. These computers could be geographically located in different places but interconnected by a network. The benefits of data distribution help in increased availability and reliability as well as improved access times.

==== Heterogeneity ====

Heterogeneities in databases arise due to factors such as differences in structures, semantics of data, the constraints supported or query language. Differences in structure occur when two data models provide different primitives such as object oriented (OO) models that support specialization and inheritance and relational models that do not. Differences due to constraints occur when two models support two different constraints. For example, the set type in CODASYL schema may be partially modeled as a referential integrity constraint in a relationship schema. CODASYL supports insertion and retention that are not captured by referential integrity alone. The query language supported by one DBMS can also contribute to heterogeneity between other component DBMSs. For example, differences in query languages with the same data models or different versions of query languages could contribute to heterogeneity.

Semantic heterogeneities arise when there is a disagreement about meaning, interpretation or intended use of data. At the schema and data level, classification of possible heterogeneities include:
* Naming conflicts e.g. databases using different names to represent the same concept.
* Domain conflicts or data representation conflicts e.g. databases using different values to represent same concept.
* Precision conflicts e.g. databases using same data values from domains of different cardinalities for same data.
* Metadata conflicts e.g. same concepts are represented at schema level and instance level.
* Data conflicts e.g. missing attributes
* Schema conflicts e.g. table versus table conflict which includes naming conflicts, data conflicts etc.

In creating a federated schema, one has to resolve such heterogeneities before integrating the component DB schemas.

==== Schema matching, schema mapping ====
Dealing with incompatible data types or query syntax is not the only obstacle to a concrete implementation of an FDBS. In systems that are not planned top-down, a generic problem lies in matching semantically equivalent, but differently named parts from different schemas (=data models) (tables, attributes). A pairwise mapping between &quot;n&quot; attributes would result in formula_1 mapping rules (given equivalence mappings) - a number that quickly gets too large for practical purposes. A common way out is to provide a global schema that comprises the relevant parts of all member schemas and provide mappings in the form of database views. Two principal approaches depend on the direction of the mapping:
# Global as View (GaV): the global schema is defined in terms of the underlying schemas
# Local as View (LaV): the local schemas are defined in terms of the global schema
Both are examples of data integration, called the schema matching problem.

=== Autonomy ===
Fundamental to the difference between an MDBS and an FDBS is the concept of autonomy. It is important to understand the aspects of autonomy for component databases and how they can be addressed when a component DBS participates in an FDBS.
There are four kinds of autonomies addressed:
* Design Autonomy which refers to ability to choose its design irrespective of data, query language or conceptualization, functionality of the system implementation.
Heterogeneities in an FDBS are primarily due to design autonomy.
* Communication autonomy refers to the general operation of the DBMS to communicate with other DBMS or not.
* Execution autonomy allows a component DBMS to control the operations requested by local and external operations.
* Association autonomy gives a power to component DBS to disassociate itself from a federation which means FDBS can operate independently of any single DBS.

The ANSI/X3/SPARC Study Group outlined a three level data description architecture, the components of which are the conceptual schema, internal schema and external schema of databases. The three level architecture is however inadequate to describing the architectures of an FDBS. It was therefore extended to support the three dimensions of the FDBS namely Distribution, Autonomy and Heterogeneity. The five level schema architecture is explained below.

=== Concurrency control ===
The &quot;Heterogeneity&quot; and &quot;Autonomy&quot; requirements pose special challenges concerning concurrency control in an FDBS, which is crucial for the correct execution of its concurrent transactions (see also Global concurrency control). Achieving global serializability, the major correctness criterion, under these requirements has been characterized as very difficult and unsolved.

== Five level schema architecture for FDBSs ==
The five level schema architecture includes the following:

* Local Schema is basically the conceptual model of a component database expressed in a native data model.
* Component schema is the subset of the local schema that the owner organisation is willing to share with other users of the FDBS and it is translated into a common data model. 
* Export Schema represents a subset of a component schema that is available to a particular federation. It may include access control information regarding its use by a specific federation user. The export schema helps in managing flow of control of data.
* Federated Schema is an integration of multiple export schemas. It includes information on data distribution that is generated when integrating export schemas.
* External schema is extracted from a federated schema, and is defined for the users/applications of a particular federation.

While accurately representing the state of the art in data integration, the Five Level Schema Architecture above does suffer from a major drawback, namely IT imposed look and feel. Modern data users demand control over how data is presented; their needs are somewhat in conflict with such bottom-up approaches to data integration.

<text>The Burnt River is a river which flows from its source at Miskwabi Lake in Highlands East, Haliburton County south into the Kawartha Lakes region. It empties into Cameron Lake in the city of Kawartha Lakes, part of the Trent–Severn Waterway. The town of Burnt River is located near its southern end.

The river was used to transport lumber to sawmills downstream. Later, the Victoria Railway was built along the river. The old railway bed is now a recreational trail.

The river was given its name after a forest fire in the region left the river&#x27;s water with an unusual colour.

==Fish species==

There are three major species of fish in the river including walleye, muskie and smallmouth bass. All three tend to grow smaller than those in the nearby lakes, however they may be legally caught according to local regulations. As well as conventional fishing techniques, the smallmouth bass may be caught while fly fishing.

<doc id="1270260" wikidata="Q1302299" url="?curid=1270260" title="Youth center">
<text>A youth center or youth centre, often called youth club, is a place where young people can meet and participate in a variety of activities, for example table football, association football (US soccer, UK football), basketball, table tennis, video games, occupational therapy and religious activities. Youth clubs and centres vary in their activities across the globe, and have diverse histories based on shifting cultural, political and social contexts and relative levels of state funding or voluntary action.

== Young social groups ==
Many youth clubs are set up to provide young people with activities designed to keep them off the streets and out of trouble, and to give them a job and an interest in activity. Some youth clubs can have a particular compelling force, such as music, spiritual/religious guidance and advice or characteristics such as determination.

In the United Kingdom, there are a number of national youth club networks, including:
* UK Youth
* Ambition
* National Association of Boys and Girls Clubs

In the United States, the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America is one of the most popular (or well known) youth clubs.

==Projects and activities==
Many youth clubs and projects are open to all people aged 15–21, although some clubs may still accept young people as old as 25. There are places where young people can meet with friends and practice new activities. Many youth clubs offer various activities, such as table tennis.

Youth clubs are there to help young people understand the world around them. They are there to advise young people with their future, to talk about the past and even help them with the present. Many clubs hold different sessions to educate young people about different topics regarding their health and worries, e.g. contraception. Youth clubs normally have a leader youth worker who normally organizes trips or workshops for the young people to contribute in, e.g. Show Racism the Red Card. They can also hold charity events and even volunteer to do many different things. Youth clubs will sometimes help young people to gain qualifications for their life ahead, e.g. The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award.

<text>Derive was a computer algebra system, developed as a successor to muMATH by the Soft Warehouse in Honolulu, Hawaii, now owned by Texas Instruments. Derive was implemented in , also by Soft Warehouse. The first release was in 1988 for DOS. It was discontinued on June 29, 2007, in favor of the TI-Nspire CAS. The final version is Derive 6.1 for Windows.

Since Derive required comparably little memory, it was suitable for use on older and smaller machines. It was available for the DOS and Windows platforms and served as an inspiration for the computer algebra system in certain TI pocket calculators.

<doc id="1270265" wikidata="Q1318274" url="?curid=1270265" title="Placeholder name">
<text>Placeholder names are intentionally overly generic and ambiguous terms referring to things, places, or people, the names of which or of whom do not actually exist; are temporarily forgotten, or are unimportant; or in order to avoid stigmatization, or because they are unknowable or unpredictable given the context of their discussion; or to deliberately expunge direct use of the name.

Placeholder names for people are often terms referring to an average person or a predicted persona of a typical user.

== Linguistic role ==
These placeholders typically function grammatically as nouns and can be used for people (e.g. &quot;John Doe, Jane Doe&quot;), objects (e.g. &quot;widget&quot;), locations (&quot;Main Street&quot;), or places (e.g. &quot;Anytown, USA&quot;). They share a property with pronouns because their referents must be supplied by context; but, unlike a pronoun, they may be used with no referent—the important part of the communication is not the thing nominally referred to by the placeholder, but the context in which the placeholder occurs.

In their &quot;Dictionary of American Slang&quot; (1960), Stuart Berg Flexner and Harold Wentworth use the term &quot;kadigan&quot; for placeholder words. They define &quot;kadigan&quot; as a synonym for &quot;thingamajig&quot;. The term may have originated with Willard R. Espy, though others, such as David Annis, also used it (or cadigans) in their writing. Its etymology is obscure—Flexner and Wentworth related it to the generic word &quot;gin&quot; for engine (as in the &quot;cotton gin&quot;). It may also relate to the Irish surname &quot;Cadigan&quot;.

== Examples ==
Placeholder words exist in a highly informal register of the English language. In formal speech and writing, words like &quot;accessory&quot;, &quot;paraphernalia&quot;, &quot;artifact&quot;, &quot;instrument&quot;, or &quot;utensil&quot; are preferred; these words serve substantially the same function, but differ in connotation.

Most of these words can be documented in at least the 19th century. Edgar Allan Poe wrote a short story entitled &quot;The Literary Life of Thingum Bob, Esq.&quot;, showing that particular form to be in familiar use in the United States in the 1840s. In Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot;, W. S. Gilbert makes the Lord High Executioner sing of a &quot;little list&quot; which includes:
... apologetic statesmen of a compromising kind,
Such as: What d&#x27;ye call him: Thing&#x27;em-bob, and likewise: Never-mind,
and &#x27;St: &#x27;st: &#x27;st: and What&#x27;s-his-name, and also You-know-who:
The task of filling up the blanks I&#x27;d rather leave to you.
Some fields have their own specific placeholder terminology. For example, &quot;widget&quot; in economics, engineering and electronics, or &quot;Blackacre&quot; and &quot;John Doe&quot; or &quot;Jane Doe&quot; in law. &quot;X-ray&quot; was originally a placeholder name for an unexplained phenomenon.

=== Companies and organizations ===
* &quot;Ace&quot; and &quot;Acme&quot; were popular in company names as positioning words in alphabetical directories. They were generic, laudatory of whatever products they were used to promote and appeared at the beginning of most alpha-sorted lists. (&quot;Acme&quot; is a regular English word from the Ancient Greek , meaning summit, highest point, extremity or peak, and thus sometimes used for &quot;best&quot;.) A well-known example of &quot;Acme&quot; as a placeholder name is the Acme Corporation, whose products are often seen in the Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner cartoons.
* &quot;Mom and Pop&quot; (in the United States) are occasional placeholders for the individual owners of a generic small family-owned business
* High Street (UK) or Main Street (US) for the business district of a small town or village, often contrasted as a commercial business entity against Threadneedle Street, City of London in the UK or Wall Street, New York City in America.
* &quot;Advent corporation&quot; is a term used by lawyers to describe an as yet unnamed corporation, while legal incorporation documents are being prepared. In the case of Advent Corporation, founder Henry Kloss decided to adopt this placeholder name as the formal legal name of his new company.
* &quot;NewCo&quot; or &quot;Newco&quot; is used in a similar way in the UK for an as-yet-unnamed company.
* Fictional brands such as Morley are often used in television and cinema as placeholders to avoid unintended product placement. &quot;Brand X&quot; has been used in television advertisements as a generic brand representing any other brand than the one being advertised.
* &quot;XYZ Widget Company&quot; has long been used in business and economics textbooks as a sample company. Also used as engraving text example on items such as plaques, trophy plates, etc. Occasionally appears on customizable promotional materials including stationery templates, business cards, advertising signage, cups, backpacks, and other &quot;swag&quot; samples.
* &quot;Contoso&quot;, &quot;Fabrikam&quot;, &quot;Wingtip Toys&quot;, &quot;Woodgrove Bank&quot;, &quot;Litware&quot;, and previously &quot;Northwind&quot; are used as fictional businesses in Microsoft&#x27;s training materials and documentation.
* &quot;Oceanic Airlines&quot; is used as a fictional airline in several films, TV programmes, and comic books, typically when it is involved in a disaster or another event with which actual airlines would prefer not to be associated.
* &quot;Octan&quot; is used by The Lego Group as a fictional oil company. Before 1992, they used real life oil companies Shell Oil, Exxon and Esso.

=== Computing ===

Placeholder names are commonly used in computing:
* &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;, and &quot;qux&quot; (and combinations thereof) are commonly used as placeholders for file, function and variable names. Foo and bar are derived from foobar.
* Hacker slang includes a number of placeholders, such as &quot;&quot; which may stand for any small piece of equipment. &quot;To frob&quot;, likewise, means to do something to something. In practice it means to adjust (a device) in an aimless way.
* Alice and Bob, alternatives for &quot;person A&quot; and &quot;person B&quot; when describing processes in telecommunications; in cryptography Eve (the eavesdropper) is also added.
* &quot;J. Random&quot; X (e.g. &quot;J. Random Hacker&quot;, &quot;J. Random User&quot;) is a term used in computer jargon for a randomly selected member of a set, such as the set of all users. Sometimes used as &quot;J. Random Loser&quot; for any not-very-computer-literate user.
* &quot;John&quot; and &quot;Jane Appleseed&quot;, commonly used as placeholder names by Apple.

====Domain names====
Certain domain names in the format &quot;example.tld&quot; (such as &quot;example.com&quot;, &quot;example.net&quot;, and &quot;example.org&quot;) are officially reserved as placeholders for the purpose of presentation. Various example reserved IP addresses exist in IPv4 and IPv6, such as in IPv4 documentation and in IPv6 documentation.

=== Geographical locations ===
Placeholders such as &quot;Main Street&quot;, &quot;Your County&quot;, and &quot;Anytown&quot; are often used in sample mailing addresses. &quot;Ruritania&quot; is commonly used as a placeholder country. Acacia Avenue has been used as shorthand for an average suburban residential street in Britain.

&quot;Something&quot;-stan and its demonym &quot;something&quot;-stani, where &quot;something&quot; is often profanity, is commonly used as a placeholder for a Middle Eastern or South Asian country/people or for a politically disliked portion of one&#x27;s own country/people. As an example, &quot;Londonistan&quot; is a placeholder name that evokes the perception of London&#x27;s high Muslim population.

&quot;Timbuktu&quot;, a real city in Mali, is often used to mean a place that is far away, in the middle of nowhere, or exotic. &quot;Kalamazoo&quot;, also a real city, is similarly used to indicate an unknown or far-away place. 

&quot;Podunk&quot; is used in American English for a hypothetical small town regarded as typically dull or insignificant, a place in the U.S. that is unlikely to have been heard of. Another example is &quot;East Cupcake&quot; to refer to a generic small town in the Midwestern United States.

Similarly, &quot;the boondocks&quot; or &quot;the boonies&quot; are used in American English to refer to very rural areas without many inhabitants.

In New Zealand English, &quot;Woop Woops&quot; (or, alternatively, &quot;Wop-wops&quot;) is a (generally humorous) name for an out-of-the-way location, usually rural and sparsely populated. The similar Australian English &quot;Woop Woop&quot;, (or, less frequently, &quot;Woop Woops&quot;) can refer to any remote location, or outback town or district. Another New Zealand English term with a similar use is Waikikamukau (&quot;Why kick a moo-cow&quot;), a generic name for a small rural town.

In British English, &quot;Bongo Bongo Land&quot; (or &quot;Bongo-bongo&quot; Land) is a pejorative term used to refer to Third World countries, particularly in Africa, or to a fictional such country.

=== Legal ===
* In ancient Roman law, the names &quot;Aulus Agerius&quot; and &quot;Numerius Negidius&quot; were used to represent the plaintiff and the defendant. The names were both wordplays, respectively meaning &quot;[I] set in motion&quot; and &quot;[I] refuse to pay&quot;. The model instruction to judges for civil suits began with &quot;si paret Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio sestertium decem milia dare oportere&quot;, meaning &quot;if [it] appears that Numerius Negidius ought to pay Aulus Agerius ten thousand sesterces...&quot;.
*In the United States and Canada, &quot;John Doe&quot; and the variations &quot;Jane Doe&quot; (for females) and &quot;John Roe&quot; or &quot;Richard Roe&quot; (for a second party): used in legal action and cases when the true identity of a person is unknown or must be withheld for legal reasons. &quot;Jane Roe&quot; was used for the then-unidentified plaintiff (Norma Leah McCorvey) in one of the most famous legal cases in United States history, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. These parties also appear in the legal fictions of the action in ejectment, which was the usual proceeding to quiet title to real property under common law pleading.
* &quot;Mopery&quot;: used in informal legal discussions as a placeholder for some infraction, when the exact nature of the infraction is not important.
* &quot;Blackacre&quot; and its neighbors &quot;Whiteacre&quot;, &quot;Greenacre&quot;, &quot;Brownacre&quot;, &quot;Greyacre&quot;, &quot;Pinkacre&quot;, etc. are used as placeholders for parcels of real property, usually on Law School examinations and the several State Bar Exams. They are sometimes located in &quot;Acre County&quot; in the fictional State of Franklin.
* &quot;Fnu Lnu&quot; is used by authorities to identify unknown suspects, the name being an acronym for &quot;First Name Unknown, Last Name Unknown&quot;. If a person&#x27;s first name is known but not the last, or vice versa, they may be called &quot;[real name] Lnu&quot; or &quot;Fnu [real name]&quot;, and an unidentified person may be &quot;Fnu Lnu&quot;. For example, a former interpreter for the United States military was charged as &quot;FNU LNU&quot;, and a mute man whose identity could not be determined was arrested and charged with burglary in Harris County, Texas under the name &quot;FNU-LNU&quot; (charges were later dropped because authorities could not communicate with the man). &quot;Fnu-Lnu&quot; conjunctions may also be used if the person has only a single name, as in Indonesian names. The name has been considered a source of humor when &quot;Fnu Lnu&quot; has been mistaken for the actual name of a person.
* &quot;X ben X&quot; (, or ) is used in Morocco by health and judicial authorities in cases where an individual&#x27;s identity cannot be determined. These cases include amnesiacs, suspects, hospital patients, and homeless people. In 2009, 80,000 abandoned orphans had the placeholder name of &quot;X ben X&quot; and 100 unidentified bodies are buried each year in Morocco under this status. 
* &quot;Ploni, Almoni,&quot; or &quot;Ploni Almoni&quot; are used in Israel, the names originating in the Hebrew Bible. &quot;Israel Israeli&quot; is a newer variant, used in Israel today. 

=== Medicine ===
* St. Elsewhere is often used as a placeholder name for any regional hospital or other care facility from which an admitted patient was referred. The medical slang is honored in the name of the 1980s television show of the same name.
* GOMER (Get Out of My Emergency Room) is a name in medical slang for any patient who continually uses emergency room services for non-emergency conditions; its use is informal and pejorative.
* Element names from the periodic table are used in some hospitals as a placeholder for patient names, ex. Francium Male.

=== Military ===
Often used in example names and addresses to indicate to the serviceman where to put his own details.
* &quot;Tommy Atkins&quot;, the generic name for a soldier of the British Army. Also, colloquially, &quot;Bill Oddie&quot;, rhyming slang on the nickname &quot;Squaddie&quot;.
* In the US Army and Air Force, &quot;Private&quot; (or &quot;Airman&quot;) &quot;Tentpeg&quot; and &quot;Snuffy&quot; are commonly used in examples (to explain various procedures) or cautionary tales. In the Marine Corps, &quot;Lance Corporal Schmuckatelli&quot; serves the same purpose.
* In the US Coast Guard, a generic Coast Guardsman is referred to as &quot;Joe Coastie&quot; (or &quot;Jane&quot;).
* In the Coast Guard, Navy, and Marines, a hypothetical member who has his act together is &quot;A.J. Squared-Away&quot;.
* In the Canadian Armed Forces, the generic name for a soldier is &quot;Private&quot;, &quot;Corporal&quot;, or any other &quot;[rank] Bloggins&quot;
* In the British Army, the fictional &quot;Loamshire Regiment&quot; is used as a placeholder to provide examples for its procedures such as addressing mail or specimen charges for violations of military law.

=== Numbers ===

* &quot;Umpteen&quot; is any annoyingly large number, as in the phrase &quot;for the umpteenth time&quot;.
* Placeholder telephone numbers are often allocated from ranges such as &quot;555&quot; (where +1-[area code]-555-1212 is reserved in North America for directory assistance applications) to avoid generating misdialled calls to working numbers. In the United Kingdom, Ofcom has set aside a range of numbers in larger geographic area codes, as well as fictional area code 01632 (0632 having been the code for Newcastle upon Tyne until replaced by 091 in the 1980s), for dramatic use.
* Common placeholders for postcodes in Canada include A1A 1A1 (a real postal code for Lower Battery Road, St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland) and K1A 0B2 (Canada Post Place in Ottawa). H0H 0H0 is reserved by Canada Post for fictional use (specifically for the mythical Santa&#x27;s workshop). In the United States, the ZIP Code 90210 (from TV series Beverly Hills 90210) is frequently used. Numeric codes with repeated or sequential digits like 12345 (a General Electric plant in Schenectady, New York), or 99999-9999 (unused but in a prefix range for the vicinity of Ketchikan, Alaska) may also appear. 00000, which lies in an unused prefix range, can be used without confusion.
* In computing, some magic numbers (and other uses of hexadecimal numbers) apply hexspeak to create memorable hexadecimal values, such as .

=== People ===
* Hudjefa (&quot;omitted&quot;), used by ancient Egyptian scribes when copying illegible pharaohs&#x27; names.
* Joe Bloggs
* John/Jane Doe
* John Q. Public
* Joe Schmoe
* Tom, Dick and Harry
* John Smith/Jane Smith
* What&#x27;s-their-name or what&#x27;s-their-face, for a person whose name is momentarily forgotten 
** Examples (declension): what&#x27;s-their-name, , what&#x27;s-their-face, whatstheirface, , , , , , , , 
*In Japanese, the name Yamada Taro (山田太郎) for men and Yamada Hanako (山田花子) for women.

===Science===
In chemistry, tentative or hypothetical elements are assigned provisional names until their existence is confirmed by IUPAC. Historically, this placeholder name would follow Mendeleev&#x27;s nomenclature; since the Transfermium wars, however, the consensus has been to assign a systematic element name based on the element&#x27;s atomic number. Examples of these systems in use would be &quot;ekasilicon&quot; (germanium) and &quot;ununseptium&quot; (tennessine) respectively.

Similarly, the name &quot;unobtainium&quot; is frequently used for a material of highly desired characteristics which does not exist or which would be prohibitively expensive to mine, procure or synthesize.

<text>Grail was a free extensible multi-platform web browser written in the Python programming language. The project was started in August 1995, with its first public release in November of that year. The last official release was version 0.6 in 1999.

One of the major distinguishing features of Grail was the ability to run client-side Python code, in much the same way as mainstream browsers run client-side JavaScript code.

The name Grail is thought to be a tribute to &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;, a film by the British comedy group Monty Python. The name follows a similar suit to that of Python&#x27;s─the programming language was too named after Monty Python.

As head coach, he led the Bengals to Super Bowl XXIII, which they lost to the 49ers 20–16, relinquishing the lead on a last-minute touchdown. He was also known for introducing the use of the no-huddle offense as a standard offense (as opposed to use at the end of the half).

Wyche coached Cincinnati from 1984 to 1991, and his 64 wins with the Bengals were the most by a coach in franchise history until he was surpassed by Marvin Lewis in 2011.

Wyche also played for the Washington Redskins, Detroit Lions, St. Louis Cardinals, and Buffalo Bills. He also coached at the University of South Carolina and Indiana University, and for the San Francisco 49ers, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Buffalo Bills.

==College career==
From 1963 to 1965, Wyche played college football at Furman University as a quarterback. He was also an initiated member of Kappa Alpha Order fraternity. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Furman University and his Master of Business Administration degree from the University of South Carolina.

==Professional career==
===Wheeling Ironmen===
From 1966 through 1967, Wyche played for the Wheeling Ironmen of the semi-professional Continental Football League.

===Cincinnati Bengals===
Wyche signed with the American Football League expansion Cincinnati Bengals for the 1968 season, when he started three games and also served as backup to John Stofa and Dewey Warren. In his rookie season, he completed 35 passes in 55 attempts (63.6 percent) for 494 yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed 12 times for 74 yards (a 6.2 average) and caught one pass for five yards.

In Wyche&#x27;s second season, 1969, he played in seven games, again starting three, as Bengals rookie Greg Cook eventually assumed the starting role. For the season, Wyche completed 54 passes in 108 attempts (50.0 percent) for 838 yards and seven touchdowns. He rushed 12 times for 109 yards (an 8.9 average) and one touchdown.

Wyche continued to play for the Bengals as they entered the National Football League in 1970 as part of the NFL–AFL merger. He played in all 14 games, once again starting three, with 26 completions in 57 attempts (45.6 percent) for 411 yards and three touchdowns. He rushed 19 times for 118 yards (a 6.2 average) with two touchdowns.

===Washington Redskins===
From 1971 to 1973, Wyche played for the Washington Redskins, who appeared in Super Bowl VII. Although playing in eight games during those two seasons, he did not attempt a pass. He primarily played as the team&#x27;s holder on field goals.

===Detroit Lions===
In 1974, Wyche played for the Detroit Lions, with only one pass attempted. He was also selected in the inaugural World Football League draft in 1974.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
In the 1976, Wyche signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. He completed his only pass completion for five yards. He was waived on September 24, 1976.

===Buffalo Bills===
Wyche was signed by the Buffalo Bills on October 27, 1976. He did not play any games during his time with the team.

==Coaching career==
=== University of South Carolina ===
In 1967, while at the University of South Carolina working on his MBA degree, Wyche was an assistant coach for the Gamecocks.

=== San Francisco 49ers ===
Wyche was an assistant coach and directed the passing game for the San Francisco 49ers from 1979 to 1982. He was on the coaching staff of the 1981 team that won Super Bowl XVI.

=== Indiana University ===
In 1983, Wyche was the head coach of the Indiana University Hoosiers, who finished 3–8. Future NFL head coach Cam Cameron was a quarterback on that team.

=== Cincinnati Bengals ===
Wyche was hired as the head coach of the Cincinnati Bengals in late December 1983. In his first three seasons, Cincinnati finished second each time, then fell to 4–11 in 1987. The next year, he led the Bengals to their second Super Bowl appearance, where they lost 20–16 to the San Francisco 49ers, who rallied to win with a touchdown pass from Joe Montana with 34 seconds remaining.

Wyche was known as the &quot;Always Innovative Sam Wyche&quot; by Norman Chad, as well as the nickname, &quot;Wicky Wacky Wyche&quot; for his unconventional play-calling. Wyche introduced the concept of having 12 or more players huddle on the field, then having a few leave the field. He called it the &quot;sugar huddle&quot;; it was meant to confuse the defense as to the personnel grouping. If defenses tried to adapt with their own substitutions, the Bengals snapped the ball, often leading to the defense being penalized for having too many players on the field. The NFL responded by changing the rules so that defenses could match the offensive substitutions before a snap was allowed. His Bengals were also the first to use the no-huddle/hurry-up offense as a base offense.

On December 10, 1989, during a game versus the Seattle Seahawks, Bengals fans began to throw snowballs onto the field in protest of what they believed to be a bad call by the officials. The Seahawks, who were at their own 4-yard line and an easy target from the bleachers, refused to continue until the snowball-throwing stopped, and play was halted by the officials. In order to stop the onslaught, Wyche was given a house microphone to try to calm the crowd. Wyche chided the fans who were doing the throwing, and alluded to the reputation of their in-state rivals, the Cleveland Browns:

After the Bengals lost that game he refused to allow the media into the locker room, a violation of NFL policy for which he was fined $3,000, an increase from a 1986 fine he was assessed for pushing a microphone out of a reporter&#x27;s hand. A year after the Seahawks game, he refused to allow a female reporter from &quot;USA Today&quot; in the locker room after a game, saying he did not want his players to be naked in front of her. The NFL fined him $27,000, the largest fine ever assessed against a coach. He complained that Commissioner Paul Tagliabue was more interested in fining him than finding a solution that worked.

During his Cincinnati tenure, Wyche also had an acrimonious relationship with Jerry Glanville, the head coach of the division rival Houston Oilers, whom he called a &quot;phony&quot;; the teams played each other twice each season. In one contest, after the Bengals had scored to extend their lead over the Oilers to 45–0, Wyche ordered his team to make an onside kick, potentially allowing them to retain possession, a move teams usually make only when the score is close late in the game. After defeating the Oilers 61–7 in 1989, Wyche waved derisively at Glanville as the teams left the field.

On December 24, 1991, just three years after the Bengals&#x27; Super Bowl appearance, Wyche was fired by owner Mike Brown, who had taken over the team upon the death of his father, club founder Paul Brown, four months earlier. Controversy erupted when the Bengals claimed Wyche had resigned, relieving the team of any future payments, but Wyche stated he was fired. His 61–66 record was the best of any Bengals&#x27; coach until 2011.

=== Tampa Bay Buccaneers ===
Wyche was hired by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as head coach in 1992. He spent the next four years as head coach of the Buccaneers, where he drafted Derrick Brooks, Warren Sapp, and John Lynch, players who would be key members of the successful Buccaneers teams under his successors, Tony Dungy and Jon Gruden. Wyche was dismissed at the conclusion of the 1995 season, having accumulated a 23–41 record over four straight losing seasons.

Near the end of his tenure with the Buccaneers, Wyche participated in a lighthearted pregame promotional piece for NFL Films. At the time, Jimmy Johnson, then the recently dismissed coach of the Dallas Cowboys, was rumored to be heading to Tampa Bay to displace Wyche. During the promo, Wyche was about to address his team when personnel assistant John Idzik ducked his head into the room. He beckoned Wyche out of the room, and instructed him to &quot;bring your playbook.&quot; Wyche disappeared, and in walked Johnson wearing a Buccaneers jacket, who then addressed &quot;his&quot; new team, to everyone&#x27;s surprise.

=== Buffalo Bills ===
From 2004 to 2005, Wyche was the quarterbacks coach for the Buffalo Bills.

=== High school ===
In 2002, 2003 and from 2006 to 2010, Wyche volunteered as the offensive coordinator and quarterback coach for the Pickens High School Blue Flame in Pickens, South Carolina. He helped the Blue Flame get to the second round of the playoffs in 2006. Wyche was a registered substitute teacher in Pickens County schools.

==Broadcasting career==
In 1996, Wyche worked as a sports analyst with Marv Albert on a weekly NFL game for NBC. In 1997, he was promoted to the studio on NBC&#x27;s weekly pre-game and half-time shows. He worked as an analyst for CBS with Kevin Harlan on the weekly NFL games from 1998 until week 2 in 2000 when his voice gave part way through a game between Miami and Minnesota. Beesley Reece came up from sideline reporting to do color commentary for the rest of that game. He returned to CBS in 2001, where he did the first two games of the NFL season with Gus Johnson, and Brent Jones. In 2006, he was a commentator on Westwood One&#x27;s NFL Thursday night coverage, with Dick Enberg. Also in 2006, he began working with Tom Werme broadcasting Southern Conference Football for Fox Sports South.

==Personal life==
Wyche and his wife, Jane, had two children, Zak and Kerry, and six grandchildren. He was a private pilot for many years. He also enjoyed golf, tennis, jogging and riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

Wyche underwent a biopsy on lymph nodes in his chest in 2000. His left Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve was severed during the procedure, leaving his voice consistently hoarse and scratchy. From 2004 to 2006, he was a volunteer at Pickens High School in South Carolina as a public speaker. He was an amateur magician.

Wyche&#x27;s brother, Bubba, was a quarterback at Tennessee and in the Canadian Football League (CFL) and World Football League (WFL).

On September 9, 2016, Wyche was admitted to the Carolinas Medical Center&#x27;s Dickson Heart Unit in Charlotte, North Carolina, awaiting a heart transplant due to congestive heart failure. Three days later, a heart was found, and on September 13, Wyche underwent a 4.5-hour transplant operation.

Wyche was diagnosed with melanoma in 2019 and died at his home in Pickens, South Carolina, on January 2, 2020, at the age of 74.

==Political career==
On November 4, 2008, Wyche secured a seat on the County Council for Pickens County, South Carolina. Running as a member of the Republican Party, Wyche defeated Democrat Wesley Burbage for the Pickens seat, by a margin of 6,478 votes to 1,639.

<doc id="1270289" wikidata="Q4937230" url="?curid=1270289" title="Boerum Hill">
<text>Boerum Hill (pronounced ) is a small neighborhood in the northwestern portion of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, bounded by Schermerhorn Street to the north and Fourth Avenue to the east. The western border is variously given as either Smith or Court Street, and Warren or Wyckoff Street as the southern edge.

Smith Street and Atlantic Avenue are the neighborhood&#x27;s main commercial districts. The Brooklyn High School of the Arts is in the neighborhood on Dean Street and Third Avenue. The neighborhood is part of Brooklyn Community District 2 and is served by the NYPD&#x27;s 84th Precinct.

==History==

Boerum Hill is named for the colonial farm of the Boerum family, which occupied most of the area during early Dutch settlement. According to the 1790 census, John Boerum&#x27;s family owned at least two enslaved people.

Most of the housing in Boerum Hill consists of three-story row houses built between 1840 and 1870. Despite the &quot;hill&quot; in the name, the neighborhood is relatively flat; some parts sit atop former marshes that bordered Gowanus Creek. In the 1950s, all the neighborhoods south of Atlantic Avenue and west of Prospect Park were known generically as South Brooklyn. Boerum Hill in particular was sometimes called &quot;North Gowanus&quot;. The name &quot;Boerum Hill&quot; was coined in early 1964 by Boerum Hill Association founder Helen Buckler, referencing the name of the colonial farmers.

From the early 1970s until about 2003, Boerum Hill was populated mostly by working class and middle-class African-American and Puerto Rican families. Since about the late 1990s, gentrification has changed the neighborhood to one of mostly upper-class individuals, though working-class families still reside in the immediate area.

In the early twentieth century, many of the buildings were run as boarding houses. Nearby was the union hall for ironworkers, who came to the city to work on bridges and skyscrapers. The north end of Smith Street was the center of New York City&#x27;s Mohawk community, who came mostly from Akwesasne and Kahnawake, Mohawk reserves in Quebec, Canada. (Akwesasne extends across national boundaries into New York state.) Many of the Mohawk men were ironworkers, while their wives worked at a variety of jobs and created the community for their families. For 50 years, the Mohawk families called their neighborhood &quot;Little Caughnawaga,&quot; after the homeland of Kahnawake. Many families would travel back to Kahnawake in the summer.

The Boerum Hill Historic District was first recognized and designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on November 20, 1973, after many years of advocacy by the Boerum Hill Association. The Boerum Hill Historic District was then listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Many of its buildings are landmarked.

In 2012, Boerum Hill had the sixth highest neighborhood median home prices among all New York City neighborhoods, and the highest of any neighborhood outside Manhattan.

==Culture==

Boerum Hill is known for its independent boutiques, restaurants and rows of brownstones. Boerum Hill is home to many artists who own art galleries in the neighborhood and to many young families, and biking is popular in the neighborhood and nearby Prospect Park. Cultural offerings include The Invisible Dog Art Center, Roulette, Issue Project Room, and BAM. There are also the Smith Street restaurant row and the Atlantic Avenue design district.

The neighborhood has been featured in several contemporary creative works. It is the setting of Spike Lee&#x27;s movie &quot;Clockers&quot; (1995), which was filmed in the Gowanus Houses. It is the setting for two of Jonathan Lethem&#x27;s novels: &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (1999), a crime mystery set on Bergen Street between Smith and Hoyt streets; and &quot;The Fortress of Solitude&quot; (2002), set primarily on one block in Boerum Hill (Dean Street between Nevins and Bond streets).

== Library ==
The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL)&#x27;s Pacific branch is at 25 Fourth Avenue near Pacific Street. Opened in 1905, it is Brooklyn&#x27;s oldest Carnegie library.

== Media ==
WBAI 99.5 FM, a non-commercial, listener-supported radio station, is part of the Pacifica Network and has studios and offices at 388 Atlantic Avenue.

<text>Rebecca &quot;Beckie&quot; Scott (born August 1, 1974) is a Canadian retired cross-country skier. She is an Olympic gold and silver medallist, and the first Canadian to win an Olympic medal in cross-country skiing. She is the founder of a national organization dedicated to improving health, wellness and education outcomes for Indigenous youth through sport and play. Scott was Chair of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Athlete Committee, and gained notoriety for her position during the Russian (2014–2019) doping scandal. She served as an International Olympic Committee member by virtue of being elected to the IOC Athlete&#x27;s Commission along with Saku Koivu between 2006 and 2014. She is married to the American former cross-country skier Justin Wadsworth. They have two children, Teo and Brynn.

==Career==

Scott was born in Vegreville, Alberta, but grew up in Vermilion, Alberta. Supported by her parents, she began cross-country skiing at the age of five. She entered her first competition at age seven and attended the Junior National Championships in 1988. She went on to win seventeen World Cup medals in sprint, individual
Scott is a three-time Olympian, participating at the 1998 Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan, the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy. Her best-placed finish in Nagano was 45th, but Scott won a gold medal in cross-country skiing at the Salt Lake City games. She originally finished third in the 5 km pursuit, but she was upgraded to the gold medal when winner Olga Danilova and runner-up Larissa Lazutina were eventually disqualified for using darbepoetin, a performance-enhancing drug. Scott was awarded a silver medal before receiving her gold medal in June 2004, almost two and a half years after the Olympics ended. She became the first Canadian and first North American woman to win an Olympic medal in cross-country skiing.

Scott is an Officer of the Order of Canada, and has been honoured with a variety of awards in Canada. She has been inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Ski Hall of Fame, and the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame. She has a Bachelor of Arts in English from the University of Waterloo and has twice received the John Semmelink Award, for demonstrating sportsmanship and ability in international competition. She holds honorary Doctorates of Laws from the University of Alberta, Mount Royal University and the University of British Columbia. Scott was inducted into the Alberta Order of Excellence on October 17, 2019.

On March 29, 2005, Scott agreed to join the World Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s (WADA) athlete committee.

On February 23, 2006, Scott was elected as an athlete member of the International Olympic Committee along with Finnish ice hockey player Saku Koivu. Scott retired on April 12, 2006, as the most decorated Canadian cross-country skier. 2006 was also her best season, with multiple victories and podiums on the World Cup circuit, to go with her Olympic silver in one of her races in Turin, and she lost out on winning her first World Cup overall season title to the great Marit Bjørgen by the smallest margin.

In September 2012, Scott was appointed to WADA&#x27;s executive committee. In September 2018, Scott resigned from the WADA compliance and review committee responsible for making a recommendation to end the Russian Anti-Doping Agency&#x27;s suspension from WADA.

==Charity==
In 2017, Scott established &quot;Spirit North&quot;, a charitable organization dedicated to improving health, wellness and education outcomes for Indigenous youth through equitable access to sport and play.

<text>The shortnose cisco (&quot;Coregonus reighardi&quot;) is a North American freshwater whitefish in the salmon family Salmonidae. One of the members of the broader &quot;Coregonus artedi&quot; species complex of ciscoes, it is native to the Great Lakes of Canada and the United States. Its population has been declining and it has disappeared from some of its earlier haunts. The last reported population was restricted to Georgian Bay off Lake Huron in Canada. It is thought that declines in the population of this fish may be linked with the arrival of the sea lamprey (&quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot;), in the Great Lakes. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the conservation status of this fish as &quot;critically endangered&quot;, and possibly extinct.

In 2024, the United States Geological Survey announced that the species had been rediscovered in Lake Superior.

==Description==
Reaching a maximum recorded length of and a maximum recorded weight of , the shortnose cisco is distinguished from the other whitefishes by its thicker body (nearly circular in cross-section), short head (the source of the fish&#x27;s common name), and small eye.

==Ecology==
Like many &quot;Coregonus&quot; species, the shortnose cisco is poorly understood, and little is known about its breeding or life-cycle except that it spawns in the spring at the lake bottom; the oldest specimen collected was eight years of age. 
The fish feeds on crustaceans, molluscs, and zooplankton.

==Status==
It is native to the Great Lakes, formerly occurring in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Ontario in Canada and the United States.
The IUCN considers &quot;C. reighardi&quot; to be Critically Endangered on the basis of plummeting population, caused by environmental degradation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Province of Ontario&#x27;s Ministry of Natural Resources, however, consider the species already extinct, on the basis that no specimen has been collected since 1985. The species was last confirmed present in Lake Ontario in 1964, in Lake Michigan in 1974, and in Georgian Bay in 1985. Predation by the alien sea lamprey (&quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot;), in combination with commercial overfishing, has contributed to the fish&#x27;s drastic reduction in numbers and possible extirpation. In 2024, it was announced that the species had been rediscovered in Lake Superior, where it is not previously known to have lived.

<text>John Keith Patrick Allen (17 March 1927 – 28 July 2006) was a British actor.

==Life and career==
Allen was born in Nyasaland (now Malawi), where his father was a tobacco farmer. After his parents returned to Britain, he was evacuated to Canada during the Second World War, where he remained to finish his education at McGill University in Montreal. Before returning to Britain, he gained experience as a local radio broadcaster and appeared on television in plays and documentaries.

Returning to the UK in 1953, Allen made his film debut in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; (1954). He subsequently appeared in character roles in many films, including &quot;Captain Clegg&quot;, &quot;The Wild Geese&quot;, &quot;The Sea Wolves&quot;, &quot;Puppet on a Chain&quot;, and &quot;Who Dares Wins&quot;. He was also the lead actor in the Associated-Rediffusion adventure series &quot;Crane&quot; (1963–65) and in the BBC1 series &quot;Brett&quot; (1971). Allen played Moriarty&#x27;s deputy Colonel Sebastian Moran in &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; and &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot;.

Allen made regular appearances in ITC television series during the 1960s and early 1970s, including &quot;The Power Game&quot;, &quot;The Baron&quot;, &quot;The Champions&quot;, &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Gideon&#x27;s Way&quot; and latterly &quot;UFO&quot; (in the episode &quot;Timelash&quot; 1971), although he never had an ongoing role in any of these series. Alongside Roger Moore, he made one episode of &quot;The Saint&quot; (&quot;The Man Who Could Not Die&quot;), broadcast in the UK in July 1965.

Allen also worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company in a number of stage roles, along with many BBC productions, including appearing as Mr Gradgrind in a television production of Dickens&#x27; &quot;Hard Times&quot; in 1977.

In 1967, Allen and his wife Sarah Lawson appeared together playing a married couple in the science fiction film, &quot;Night of the Big Heat&quot;. He and Lawson also played husband and wife in the BBC radio series, &quot;Stand By For West&quot;, based on the John Creasey novels about Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Roger West.

Allen&#x27;s distinctive, authoritative voice was familiar across the United Kingdom, even amongst those who did not recognise him as an actor. He dubbed Leon Greene, who played Rex, in the 1968 Hammer film &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot;.

Allen narrated the British Government&#x27;s &quot;Protect and Survive&quot; series of public information films in the 1970s; some of his lines in that production were re-recorded and sampled into the single &quot;Two Tribes&quot; by the band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. He also appeared in and voiced numerous commercials for house builder Barratt Homes and car manufacturers Ford and British Leyland among many others. His voice-over work led him to start up his own business, running a successful recording studio for voice-over work.

Allen provided the narration (the voice of Captain Star) for the 1989 children&#x27;s series &quot;TUGS&quot;. Allen remained uncredited for his work, which was revealed in an interview with the show&#x27;s producer Robert D. Cardona.

Allen&#x27;s voice was heard at the beginning of videocassettes distributed in the UK by Video Network in the 1980s, welcoming viewers and reading an anti-copying warning. He also narrated the first series of &quot;Blackadder&quot;, and appeared in the last episode, &quot;The Black Seal&quot;, as Edmund&#x27;s nemesis, Phillip of Burgundy – known to his enemies as &quot;The Hawk&quot;.

Allen&#x27;s voice became synonymous with British alternative comedy in the 1990&#x27;s after his recurring role as the Announcer for shows written by and starring Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, including &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;, &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot; and &quot;Bang, Bang, It&#x27;s Reeves and Mortimer&quot;.

In 2005, Allen became the voice of the British television channel E4, providing voiceovers for many of its idents and promotions.

Allen was also the voice of the &quot;Christian O&#x27;Connell Breakfast Show&quot; on XFM, the late show on 103.2 Power FM, Hirsty&#x27;s Daily Dose on Galaxy Yorkshire and briefly Virgin Radio.

==Personal life==
Allen married actress Sarah Lawson in 1960; the couple had two sons.

==Death==
Allen died on the morning of 28 July 2006, aged 79. He was survived by his wife (until her death on 18 August 2023) and their sons.

<text>Blue Cross Arena, also known as the War Memorial, is a multi-purpose indoor arena located in Rochester, New York. For hockey and lacrosse, its seating capacity is 10,662. The arena opened on October 18, 1955, as the Rochester Community War Memorial. It was renovated in the mid-1990s and reopened as The Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial, on September 18, 1998. It is home to the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League and the Rochester Knighthawks of the National Lacrosse League.

==History==

The arena was built on a downtown site as a replacement for Edgerton Park Arena, bounded by Exchange Boulevard on the west, East Broad Street on the north, the Genesee River on the east and Court Street on the south. The property was formerly the home of the Kimball Tobacco Co. and other retail buildings. Originally named the Rochester Community War Memorial, the arena opened on October 18, 1955. The building included a full stage on the south end and an exhibition hall located on the basement level. One of the members of the construction team was a young Robert Marella, who later achieved fame as professional wrestler Gorilla Monsoon. The arena&#x27;s first tenant was the Rochester Royals NBA basketball team, who played their final two seasons in Rochester at this arena. They were joined by the Americans the next year, who have played in the arena for 63 consecutive seasons.

On March 13, 1996, renovations to expand the arena took place, eliminating the permanent stage at the south end of the building. On July 24, 1998, Blue Cross Blue Shield and City officials announced that the name of the renovated arena would be Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial. On September 18, 1998, the arena reopened to the public during a formal ribbon cutting/rededication ceremony. DeWolff Partnership Architects completed the project as Architects of Record with Rossetti Architects in a consultant relationship. C.E. DeWolff, Senior Partner of DeWolff Partnership, Geno Rossetti of Rossetti Architects, were Design Associates who collaborated on features of the design. In 2018, the city terminated the arena management contract with long term operator SMG who had been running the arena since 2000. In July 2018, the city reached an agreement with Pegula Sports and Entertainment, owners of the Americans, Buffalo Sabres and Buffalo Bills and operators of KeyBank Center in Buffalo to operate the arena beginning on August 1, 2018. Shortly after the Pegula takeover the arena received updates of a new center scoreboard, a new ribbon board at the stage end of the arena and enhancements to the audio and video equipment. There are plans for expansion along the Exchange Boulevard side of the arena that will make room for additional office space and improved locker room facilities as well as planned upgrades to the bathrooms, new concessions and a restaurant.

Blue Cross Arena&#x27;s portable stage, which measures 80 feet deep by 80 feet wide, is said to be deeper than, and is nearly the same size as, the proscenium stage at Radio City Music Hall across the state in New York City.

==Notable events==
The first event at the facility was a public trade show held in the exhibition hall and featured such famous Rochester-based companies as Eastman Kodak, Haloid (now Xerox), Bausch &amp; Lomb, General Railway Signal and Rochester Products.

It hosted the 1956 NBA All-Star Game, the two-month finals of the American Bowling Congress tournament in both 1956 and 1966.

Judy Garland performed a one-night stand concert at the War Memorial on her comeback tour, the night of October 17, 1961.

A semifinal game and the final game of the ECAC Upstate-Southern Region tournament, an NCAA Division I men&#x27;s college basketball tournament organized by the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC), took place at the War Memorial in 1978; the tournament champion received an automatic bid to the 1978 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament.

World Wrestling Entertainment has run many shows at the arena, most notably several television tapings 1997&#x27;s In Your House 14: Revenge of the &#x27;Taker Pay Per View event. In 1990 at a television taping, Mr. Perfect won the Intercontinental title from The Texas Tornado and in 1994, Diesel (Kevin Nash) beat Razor Ramon for the Intercontinental title.

On July 28, 2007, the CIFL Championship Game was held in the arena. It was the first arena football game played in the venue since the Rochester Brigade folded in 2003.

Local high school basketball games are played here, most notably the New York State Public High School Section V (5) Championships at the end of each season. Additionally, the arena is the home of high school cheerleading championships each year. The arena also hosts college basketball, and Section V hockey and wrestling.

On Saturday and Sunday, March 8–9, 2008, the Blue Cross Arena played host to the 46th NYSPHSAA Wrestling Championships, just the second time the annual interscholastic event has been held in the Rochester area.

The arena attendance record of 11,650 was set December 3, 2003 when Syracuse University defeated St. Bonaventure University in men&#x27;s basketball. St. Bonaventure has hosted one of its home games in Rochester every year since 2002.

In 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg&#x27;s Tour of Gymnastics Champions.

On May 18, 2019, the arena held their first MMA event UFC Fight Night: dos Anjos vs. Lee.

In addition to sporting events, the arena hosts a wide variety of entertainment events, including live concerts, ice shows and the circus.

On November 1, 1965, The Rolling Stones played here in a concert that lasted only 7 minutes, when several thousand fans rushed the stage causing police to cancel the show. On August 9, 1971, The Who played at the War Memorial just five days before releasing their classic album &quot;Who&#x27;s Next&quot;.
Led Zeppelin played to a standing room audience concert on September 11, 1971. 
The Grateful Dead&#x27;s performance, on November 5, 1977, was recorded and later released as a live album, entitled &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks Volume 34&quot;. Part of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s performance on September 2, 1980, is included as bonus tracks on &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks Volume 21&quot;. The band performed at the arena ten times between 1973 and 1985.

Footage from Phish&#x27;s documentary &quot;Bittersweet Motel&quot;, was filmed here on December 11, 1997.

===Ice hockey===

Aside from the Rochester Americans, who play their home games in the arena, the Blue Cross Arena has played host to several notable ice hockey events and games. On November 12, 2003, the Buffalo Sabres and the defending Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils played the first National Hockey League regular season game in the venue. The game was made possible by then Sabres owner Tom Golisano, who hails from Rochester, and featured two Rochester natives: Brian Gionta of the Devils and Rory Fitzpatrick of the Sabres. It ended in a 2–2 tie. A second regular season game was held at the arena on October 26, 2005, with the Sabres falling to the Washington Capitals, 3–2 with 8,552 in attendance.

On March 23, 2006, Atlantic Hockey, an NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s ice hockey league, announced that its league tournaments in 2007, 2008, and 2009 would be held at the Blue Cross Arena. 2007 was the first time the tournament was held at a neutral site. The league continued to hold their tournament there each year through 2018 when it then moved to Buffalo&#x27;s LECOM Harborcenter. Additionally, the 2007 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Ice Hockey East Regional was held at the Blue Cross Arena. Attendance was low due to high ticket prices and distance from large Division I programs.

The Rochester Institute of Technology men&#x27;s hockey team has played periodic regular-season games at Blue Cross Arena instead of at their smaller on-campus rink, due to the large capacity. The RIT women&#x27;s hockey team hosted an exhibition game at the arena on October 16, 2021, after the Gene Polisseni Center was temporarily shut down for an ammonia leak.

Every year, the Blue Cross Arena hosts regular season Section V high school hockey games and the Section V Basketball championship.

<text>Reichenbach an der Fils is a town in the Esslingen district in Baden-Württemberg in southern Germany.

==Geography==
===Geographical Location===
The municipality of Reichenbach an der Fils is approximately 12 km (as the crow flies) east-southeast of the district town of Esslingen and about 25 km in the same direction from the state capital, Stuttgart. It is situated on the Fils River, which flows westward here, with the Reichenbach coming from the north, the Lützelbach from the northwest, and subsequently the Talbach from the southeast. The municipal area is predominantly located to the right of the river; its northern part belongs to the Schurwald subarea of the Schurwald and Welzheimer Wald natural region, while its smaller southern part along the river course belongs to the foothills of the central Swabian Alb. The lowest point at approximately 253 meters above sea level is at the outlet of the Fils, while the highest point, the Probst forested hill, reaches up to 446 meters above sea level in the northeast.

==Municipal Divisions==

Apart from the village of Reichenbach, the municipality of Reichenbach an der Fils includes no other settlements. Within the municipality&#x27;s area lie the vanished localities of Bornhausen or Bernhausen, Geroldsweiler or Gerensweiler, and Knollenhof.

===Neighboring Municipalities===
The municipality of Reichenbach an der Fils borders the following municipalities: the municipality of Hochdorf to the south, the town of Plochingen to the west, the municipalities of Baltmannsweiler to the northwest and Lichtenwald to the northeast, all of which are also in the district of Esslingen, as well as the town of Ebersbach an der Fils to the east in the district of Göppingen.

==History==
===From the Stone Age to the Middle Ages===

Traces of people from the Middle Stone Age (12,000–5000 BC) have been found on the heights of the Fils Valley, as well as on the terrain north of the Siegenhof.

Reichenbach an der Fils was first mentioned in a document in the year 1268. However, like many places, the exact time of birth remains in the darkness of history. The founding period of the village can be deduced from field names and compared with neighboring villages, likely between the 9th and 11th centuries. Thus, Reichenbach was a village in the Duchy of Swabia. Wilhelm Böhringer and Gustav Wohlbold, both former educators at the local elementary school, have researched state and church archives in the past and found the place mentioned for the first time in connection with a dispute between two noblewomen as &quot;Marquardus plebanus de Richenbach,&quot; recorded as a witness on a document from the year 1268.

The name of the village has nothing to do with wealth. Rather, it is named after the stream flowing through the municipality. To prevent confusion with municipalities of the same name, the designation &quot;Reichenbach an der Fils&quot; was introduced in 1906. At the end of the 13th century, Reichenbach came under the sovereignty of the Lords of Württemberg, after the Staufers and then the Dukes of Teck had previously held sway. In 1299, Duke Hermann of Teck relinquished all ownership and sovereignty claims in Reichenbach to Württemberg.

===Development in the Early Modern Period===
In 1534, the Protestant Duke Ulrich ordered that Württemberg, and therefore Reichenbach, should henceforth be Protestant according to the principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio.&quot; Originally, Reichenbach belonged to the district in Kirchheim, from 1485 to the district in Göppingen. The community developed slowly. During the recurring periods of war from the 16th to the 19th centuries, when Spanish, Swedish, Austrian, and especially French troops marched through the Fils Valley for nearly 300 years, Reichenbach became a battlefield through occupations, plundering, and combat. Even Napoleon traveled through the village in 1806.

After once having 600 inhabitants, Reichenbach was almost depopulated after the Thirty Years&#x27; War and numbered only about 50 residents. It was one of the most devastated villages in the district of Göppingen. It took 180 years for the village to recover from this dire time. Only at the beginning of the 19th century did noticeable migrations occur. In the economic history of the early Duchy of Württemberg, Reichenbach had long functioned as a mining town. Already in the 15th century, the Württemberg counts and later dukes had copper and manganese ores mined at Asang and in the Lützelbachtal, from which colors were obtained. In 1457, a coal mine was established in the direction of Baltmannsweiler. Not only were there occasional small coal seams in the sandstone, but also traces of gold and silver. At times, more than six adits were in operation. In 1561, a smelter was built, but mining was discontinued in 1739 due to insufficient output.

===After the Establishment of the Kingdom of Württemberg===
In the implementation of the new administrative structure in the Kingdom of Württemberg, founded in 1806, Reichenbach remained assigned to the district of Göppingen. The upswing of Reichenbach coincides with industrialization. The opening of the Filstalbahn railway in 1847 was of great importance, as this made Reichenbach a railway station and provided access to the network of the Württemberg Railway and the regional transportation routes. The establishment of the Heinrich Otto cotton spinning and weaving mill in 1879 brought further growth.

===Since the 20th Century===
The administrative reform during the Nazi era in Württemberg in 1938 led to Reichenbach being assigned to the district of Esslingen. After World War II, Reichenbach belonged to the state of Württemberg-Baden in the American occupation zone. With the founding of Baden-Württemberg in 1952, Reichenbach became part of the present-day federal state.

===Religions===
Since Duke Ulrich introduced the Reformation in 1534, Reichenbach has been predominantly Protestant. The Protestant overall parish of Reichenbach belongs to the Esslingen district of the Evangelical Church in Württemberg. After World War II, a Roman Catholic community was established again. The Catholic Church of St. Michael was built in 1954 and provided with its own parish in 1959. Today, the parish belongs to the pastoral unit Neckar-Fils in the Esslingen-Nürtingen deanery of the Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart. Additionally, there is a New Apostolic congregation in Reichenbach.

==Politics==
===Municipal Council===
The municipal council in Reichenbach consists of 18 members. It comprises elected honorary municipal councillors and the mayor as chairman. The mayor has voting rights in the municipal council. The local elections on 26 May 2019 resulted in the following outcome:

===Coat of Arms===

Blazon: &quot;Under a golden chief charged with a stag&#x27;s attire, Gules a plowshare argent.&quot;

The earliest evidence for the old village coat of arms is a coat of arms stone from 1588 at the town hall in Reichenbach, which shows it alongside the shield of the then responsible administrative city of Göppingen. With the stag&#x27;s attire as a symbol of Württemberg&#x27;s territorial sovereignty in the chief, a plowshare is connected, which was a popular rural symbol and is documented on Reichenbach boundary stones in 1685 as a marker; undoubtedly, it is older than the depiction from 1588. The current coat of arms design is attested in newer municipal seals and has been in use with the now customary colors since 1930.

===Flag===
The municipal flag is red-yellow (1966).

===Municipal Partnerships===
There is a municipal partnership between the municipality of Reichenbach an der Fils and the French city of Sainte-Savine.

==Economy and Infrastructure==
The municipality suffered greatly due to economic changes in the 1990s. At the beginning of the decade, the Otto company closed in Reichenbach. The Traub Drehmaschinen GmbH &amp; Co. KG (after whose founder the Hermann-Traub-Stadium of VfB Reichenbach is named) has been a subsidiary of the Esslingen INDEX-Werke since 1997, which at that time led to massive job cuts. Other companies include the corrugated board manufacturer Seyfert GmbH, the transport and logistics company Kraftverkehr Nagel Kurt Nagel GmbH &amp; Co., the electrical appliance manufacturer Electrostar, the plastics processor Oskar Voltz GmbH, as well as other medium-sized and small companies.

===Transport===

The four-lane Bundesstrasse 10, a heavily traveled road in southern Germany, runs through Reichenbach. There are also cross-connections via Baltmannsweiler or Lichtenwald into the Rems Valley, as well as the road via Hochdorf and Notzingen to Kirchheim unter Teck.
Stuttgart can be reached by car via the B 10 in about 25 minutes, and Stuttgart Airport is also about a 25 minute drive.
Since 1847, the railroad has been running through Reichenbach. It is the heavily traveled Fils Valley Railway from Stuttgart to Ulm, on which the ICE and TGV also run. The Reichenbach train station building was renovated in the fall of 2006. Today, there is a restaurant in the building, and it is also a residential building. The stop is served every half hour by metropolitan express trains between 5 a.m. and 1 a.m. There are also bus connections towards Lichtenwald and Schorndorf, towards Hochdorf and Kirchheim unter Teck, as well as to Plochingen. The local bus serves the districts of Risshalde and Siegenberg. A significant traffic structure is the Sainte-Savine Bridge, named after Reichenbach&#x27;s partner municipality Sainte Savine in France. It opens up the Voralb area and provides connections to the outdoor pool and the stadium. Shortly after the railway underpass comes the Fils Bridge, which was built in 1877. Until 2007, there was also a small shunting area with a rail connection to the aforementioned corrugated board factory. However, the rail facilities were completely removed during the 2007 renovation work. Since there is no longer an operational switch at the Reichenbach station due to the decommissioned rail connection, the station was downgraded to a stop in the fall of 2009.
There is also the Otto Munz footbridge for pedestrians and cyclists. It spans the railway tracks, Filsstrasse, the B 10 expressway, and the Fils River, facilitating access to the outdoor pool and stadium.
The neighboring municipalities of Plochingen and Ebersbach can be reached by train, while the other municipalities can be reached by bus.

===Educational Institutions===
In addition to a secondary school (Realschule), Reichenbach also has the Lützelbachschule, which is a primary and secondary modern school (Grund- und Hauptschule). The Brunnenschule, which was a pure primary school, was dissolved. The branch of the Marquardschule Plochingen, a special needs school, rounds out the educational offerings. A school in Reichenbach was first mentioned in 1580. However, in the 16th and 17th centuries, children attended school only during the winter. A summer school met with resistance from the population because the children had to do fieldwork, even though compulsory education had existed since 1649. An energetic teacher is said to have achieved at least having classes on Tuesdays and Fridays during the summer. It was not until 1735 that schooling became year-round. The first school building was a structure built in 1738 on Kirchstraße, which no longer exists today. In 1825, the community built a new school building on Schulstraße, and in 1897, the eastern half of the Brunnenschule was constructed. The western section of the former elementary school (Volksschule) was built in 1912. In 1953, the first buildings of the Lützelbachschule were constructed in Brühl, which was a major financial challenge for the community. A gymnasium and sports field were added five years later. The building for the secondary school (Realschule) was built in 1976. Students from the secondary modern school (Hauptschule) and secondary school from Hochdorf and Lichtenwald are also taught at this educational center. The local library, with more than 22,000 books as well as cassettes, DVDs, and videos, is also housed in the secondary school building.

The first kindergarten was established in 1844 on Kirchstraße but probably did not open year-round until the end of the 19th century. However, only children who were still too young for fieldwork were brought to the &quot;Kenderschüle.&quot; Today, there are eight kindergartens in Reichenbach: Robert-Schöttle-Kindergarten, Oskar-Voltz-Kindergarten, Siegenberg-Kindergarten, Michaelis-Kindergarten, Steinäcker-Kindergarten, Clärchen-Seyfert-Kindergarten, a forest kindergarten, and the Mini-Kindi in the town hall.

===Sports===
The soccer department of VfB Reichenbach currently plays in the Kreisliga A, while the now-dissolved chess department was one of the most successful in the district. The largest sports club in the town is TV Reichenbach with the following departments: competitive gymnastics, general gymnastics, children&#x27;s sports, health sports, athletics, handball, table tennis, volleyball, fistball, and &quot;Ballermänner&quot; (a traditional game). The lifeguards of the local DLRG group Reichenbach/Fils are also extremely successful nationwide, both in the youth (especially the female swimmers) and senior categories, and hold several German championships in lifesaving.

There is also the RSV Reichenbach with the sports of mountain biking, recreational sports, and radball (a form of cycling polo).

The Reichenbacher Schützengilde e.V. practices shooting sports according to the rules of the German Shooting Sport Federation in the Lützelbachtal valley. In the indoor shooting ranges, rifle and pistol shooting take place at 10m, 25m and 50m in all DSB disciplines.

==Culture and Sights==
Since 1983, the cultural initiative &quot;die halle&quot; in the former beer cellar has regularly offered concerts, cabaret, readings and parties.

==Churches==
===Evangelical Mauritius Church===

The tower of the Mauritius Church dates from 1522. The sandstone for its construction was quarried in the Lützelbach valley. Since the church interior had become too small, the church was expanded in the Art Nouveau style from 1905 to 1907 according to designs by the Stuttgart architects Richard Böklen and Carl Feil. Today it has almost 1,000 seats. In 1982, the organ with its Art Nouveau facade was expensively renovated. In 1997, the church interior underwent a thorough renovation; at the same time, the somewhat unsuccessful changes of the 1954 renovation were removed and the church was restored to its original state. Today, the Mauritius Church is one of the few Art Nouveau churches in southwestern Germany. The Mauritius Church with the rectory, the church forecourt with fountain and the cemetery behind it form an ensemble that is under monument protection.

===Catholic Church of St. Michael===
Until the Reformation, Reichenbach was Catholic, but when Duke Ulrich joined the Reformation in 1534, his subjects also became Protestant. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that Reichenbach again had a significant number of Catholics, and by around 1950 - also due to the influx of expellees and refugees from the World War II - a third of the inhabitants were Catholic. In 1953, construction of the Catholic church began. On 4 December 1954, Bishop Carl Joseph Leiprecht consecrated the church to the Holy Archangel Michael. It was renovated in 1988. Today the church has space for about 550 visitors. In addition, since 1962 five bells have been ringing, which could be bought through donations.

===Evangelical Siegenberg Church===
In May 1961, the wandering church was built as a wooden barrack. This provisional solution became necessary because the Siegenberg settlement was growing rapidly and already had 2,000 inhabitants. A few years later, a church building association collected donations, bought a building plot, started construction work and consecrated the church on Harvest Thanksgiving Day 1965. The church, furnished with a lot of natural wood, houses a church room with 150 seats under its roof, a parish hall separated from the church room by a folding wall, and two youth rooms.

===New Apostolic Church===
This Christian faith group had ten members in Reichenbach in 1921, and a year later held its first service. Until 1934, they had a room on Stuttgarter Strasse and then moved to Baltmannsweiler Strasse. When there were 60 members, it also became too cramped there, and the decision was made to build a church. This was consecrated on 27 October 1956. The property on Paulinenstrasse was renovated in 1988 and 1989. Meanwhile, the congregation has 120 members.

==Buildings==

===Town Halls===
It is not known when the first town hall in Reichenbach was built, although it was probably around 1590. Its location was near the Fils River, which then still had its old course and followed today&#x27;s Seestrasse (the riverbed was moved 800 meters to the south in 1696). There are reports from 1739 that the town hall was in a miserable condition and could only be entered at risk of life. But it took eight years before a new building could be decided upon. In 1751, a new town hall was completed, which was again too small and in need of repair by 1823; it was thoroughly renovated and expanded.

Although the building had again been much too small since 1900, people made do with finishing the attic. In 1959, the municipal council decided on a new building, construction of which began on 4 September 1961. The new building was inaugurated on 29 May 1964. The old town hall was demolished, as the Südwestbank wanted to build on this site. The bells of the old town hall can be found again in the entrance area of the new building; the tower clock now strikes in the Brunnenschule.

===Cinemas===
In the mid-20th century, the community had three cinemas. The &quot;Central-Lichtspiele&quot; opened in 1953. Also in 1953, the &quot;Neue Filmtheater&quot; opened on Wilhelmstrasse. In addition to the two permanent cinemas, there was a traveling cinema that was a guest on weekends in the hall of the gymnastics club. The last cinema closed its doors on Wilhelmstrasse in 1968.

===Spots halls===
The hall built by the gymnastics club in 1907 next to the railway lines served as a gymnasium and event hall for almost 70 years due to the lack of a larger event space. When Federal Highway 10 was built, the building was demolished. The new Brühlhalle was inaugurated on 15 May 1982. The construction costs amounted to about 10 million German marks.

===Outdoor Pool===
The outdoor pool opened on 29 May 1976. On this occasion, the then Parliamentary State Secretary at the Federal Minister for Research and Technology and later Federal Transport Minister Volker Hauff presented a check, and Mayor Richard Seeger jumped into the water from the diving tower in a tailcoat and top hat. Over 5 million bathers passed through the turnstiles in 25 years. As early as 1951, there was an outdoor pool located near the Fils defense system and the factory canal of the Otto Spinning Mill. This island pool was closed due to the construction of Federal Highway 10.

===Russian Cemetery===
During the World War II, there was a camp for Russian forced laborers near the Reichenbach train station. According to various sources, between 600 and 1,900 people lived there who had to work in the workshops of the German Reichsbahn. Eleven of the forced laborers who died during their captivity were buried in the municipal cemetery, and another 28, including 15 infants, in their own cemetery on the edge of the community.

<text>Toma Rosandić (; baptized as Tomaso Vincenzo, 22 January 1878 – 1 March 1958) was a Serbian and Yugoslav sculptor, architect and fine arts pedagog. Together with Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), he was the most prominent of Yugoslav sculptors of his day.

==Biography==
Rosandić was born in the Dalmatian city of Split, Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, Austria-Hungary, the son of a stoneworker. The family name, Rosandić originates from Cetinska Krajina, in the Dalmatian Hinterlands. During the early years in Split, Rosandić learnt to carve in wood as well as stone and was much inspired by the younger Meštrović who had moved there from Otavice. Both sculptors studied overseas before returning to Split, Rosandić touring Italy and exhibiting in Milan in 1906 and Belgrade in 1912.

He exhibited his artworks as a part of Kingdom of Serbia&#x27;s pavilion at International Exhibition of Art of 1911.

Something of their parallel development and underlying rivalry can be understood from their respective projects to combine sculpture and architecture. Both constructed a mausoleum, Rosandić for the Petrinović family (Supetar, on the island of Brač off Split) and Meštrović to the Račić family (Cavtat, south of Dubrovnik). Each exhibit the influence of Dalmatian history, but while Meštrović&#x27;s mausoleum is based on the principle of simplicity, Rosandić richly ornamented his building with a blend of Gothic and Renaissance motifs to express a more national character.
With the outbreak of World War I, Rosandić left for London where he exhibited at the Grafton Galleries in 1917 and later in Brighton and Edinburgh. During World War II, Rosandić settled in Belgrade. He was interned by the German occupation forces during the war, but was later released through the intervention of Dragomir Jovanović. Rosandić later testified at the Belgrade Process.

Rosandić was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts since 1948. He founded a prominent school in Belgrade known as the &quot;Master Workshop&quot;. Amongst the many artists and public personalities that frequented the workshop was Henry Moore, during his exhibition in Belgrade in March 1955.

In his maturity, Rosandić executed two of his greatest masterpieces: the pair of stone statues of a man struggling with a horse, which flank the entrance to the Federal Parliament building in Belgrade (today Parliament of Serbia), and a massive stone frieze of figures for a monument in Subotica, Vojvodina, Serbia (1952). Many of his bronze projects at this time were cast in the Voždovac foundry and other works by his hand can be found at the Toma Rosandić Memorial Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade.

Rosandić returned to Split before his death in 1958.

<text>South Brooklyn is a historic term for a section of the former City of Brooklyn – now the New York City borough of Brooklyn – encompassing what are now the Boerum Hill, Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, Gowanus, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Sunset Park and Red Hook neighborhoods. It was named for its location along the waterfront that was the southern border of the original Village of Brooklyn, and has remained widely used as a colloquialism despite it no longer being the southernmost point of the borough. It should not be confused with the geographic southern region of the modern borough of Brooklyn, which includes the neighborhoods of Gravesend, Seagate, Coney Island, Brighton Beach, Manhattan Beach, Sheepshead Bay, Gerritsen Beach, Marine Park, Mill Basin, and Bergen Beach.
&quot;South Brooklyn&quot; or &quot;Southern Brooklyn&quot; is also in use in the modern borough of Brooklyn, but without total consistency as to what it refers to. It has been used about neighborhoods as various and physically separated as Mill Basin, Bensonhurst, Carroll Gardens, Gowanus, Red Hook, Smith Street, Sunset Park, Windsor Terrace, as well as Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, and Park Slope.

==Transportation==
The New York City Subway&#x27;s IND Culver Line () serves the area at the Carroll Street and Smith–Ninth Streets stations. The line was originally named the &quot;South Brooklyn Line&quot; on some official subway maps. However, this obsolete name for the Culver Line may have referred to the South Brooklyn Railway, the original right of way of the BMT Culver Line; this right-of-way originally ran between Sunset Park, in the southern part of the former city of Brooklyn, and Coney Island, the southernmost area in the modern borough of Brooklyn.

The bus routes serve South Brooklyn as well.

<text>Patrick Joseph Cowley (October 19, 1950 – November 12, 1982) was an American disco and hi-NRG dance music composer and recording artist, best known for his collaborations with disco singer Sylvester. Along with Giorgio Moroder, he has been credited as a pioneer of electronic dance music.

==Early life==
Cowley was born October 19, 1950, in Buffalo, New York, to Ellen and Kenneth Cowley. The family originated in the Horseheads and Corning areas of New York and lived in Rochester. During his teenage years, Cowley became a successful drummer with local amateur bands before attending Niagara University and later the University at Buffalo to study English. In 1971, at the age of 21, Cowley moved to San Francisco to attend the City College of San Francisco (CCSF) where he studied music, specifically the use of synthesizers, from Gerald Mueller.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitchfork/artists/31867&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
Cowley met San Francisco-based musician Sylvester in 1978. Sylvester had asked Cowley to join his studio band after hearing some of his early synthesizer recordings. He played synthesizer on Sylvester&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Step II&quot; which included the hits &quot;You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real)&quot; and &quot;Dance (Disco Heat)&quot;. In addition, he wrote &quot;Stars&quot; and &quot;I Need Somebody to Love Tonight&quot; from his 1979 album &quot;Stars&quot;. Cowley also joined Sylvester&#x27;s live band and joined him on several world tours.

Cowley&#x27;s own hits included &quot;Menergy&quot; in 1981, a frank celebration of the gay club scene, and &quot;Megatron Man&quot;, which hit No. 1 and No. 2 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1981. That same year, Patrick Cowley was celebrated at the Menergy parties at The EndUp in San Francisco. Cowley recorded an album at The Stud in San Francisco. He also wrote and produced the dance single &quot;Right on Target&quot; for San Francisco artist Paul Parker, which reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart in 1982. &quot;Do Ya Wanna Funk&quot;, a collaboration with Sylvester, made No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart that same year. Cowley also did a 15&#x27;45&quot; long remix of Donna Summer&#x27;s &quot;I Feel Love&quot;, which is now a collector&#x27;s item. &quot;Mind Warp&quot;, his final album, was composed as he felt the increasing effects of HIV infection, and its songs reflect his increasing detachment from conventional reality as the disease progressed.

==Death==
During a world tour with Sylvester in late 1981, Cowley complained of feeling increasingly unwell. Upon returning to the United States, he visited a doctor who diagnosed food poisoning. Weeks later, with his condition only worsening, doctors again failed to identify what was wrong with him. At this early stage in the history of HIV/AIDS virus – at the time still referred to as &quot;gay-related immune deficiency&quot; (GRID) by American doctors – misdiagnosis was common and so Cowley, who was gay, was discharged from the hospital (in 1982) after doctors could do nothing more for him. Cowley died at his home in the Castro District neighborhood in San Francisco on November 12, 1982. He was 32 years old, an early victim of AIDS.

==Legacy==
Despite never fully achieving mainstream commercial success, Cowley is nevertheless regarded as a pioneer of early electronic music and the creator of hi-NRG, an uptempo strain of disco. Various 1980s artists such as Pet Shop Boys and New Order have cited his influence as a producer. Cowley has been described as &quot;a musical pioneer whose achievements rippled throughout queer culture and beyond into the disco mainstream&quot;.

Since the 2010s, Cowley&#x27;s profile has risen as &quot;listeners and scholars excavate disco&#x27;s intersection with gay liberation.&quot;

Amid the accompanying emergence of nu-disco in the late 2000s and early 2010s, profiles of Cowley in &quot;Gawker&quot; and other high-profile outlets have contributed to a resurgence of interest in his work. 2009 saw the release of &quot;Catholic&quot;, an album of post-punk-flavored collaborations with writer/singer Jorge Socarras, recorded from 1976 to 1979.

===Notable collaborations===
Cowley wrote and produced songs for several San Francisco musicians including friends Paul Parker and Frank Loverde. He was associated with many other musicians such as Kat Mandu, Maurice Tani and Linda Imperial.

<text>City Island Harbor is the protected body of water between City Island and Hart Island in the Bronx, New York City, open to Long Island Sound at its northern and southern extremities. It is not a true harbor, but a sound. Other minor islands in and around City Island Harbor include the Chimney Sweeps Islands, the Blauzes, and Rat Island. Green Flats Reef is exposed at low tide.

Every July 4, to celebrate Independence Day, there is a large fireworks show at nearby Orchard Beach. Hundreds of boats typically gather in the harbor to view the show.

On the evening of January 24, 2003, four local boys, 15 and 16 years old, were killed when their 8-foot dinghy sank in City Island Harbor. The boys placed a short phone call to 9-1-1 but no action was taken due to insufficient information. In any case, given the frigid water temperature it is unlikely they would have survived long enough for help to arrive. Their boat was found in February and all four bodies were found in the harbor a few months later.

<doc id="1270329" wikidata="Q327020" url="?curid=1270329" title="Alexander Gorchakov">
<text>Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov (Russian: Алекса́ндр Миха́йлович Горчако́в; 15 July 179811 March 1883) was a Russian diplomat and statesman from the Gorchakov princely family. He has an enduring reputation as one of the most influential and respected diplomats of the mid-19th century. Scholars agree that the termination of the demilitarisation of the Black Sea was Gorchakov&#x27;s greatest accomplishment but add that he stayed too long as foreign minister.

== Early life and career ==
Gorchakov was born at Haapsalu, Governorate of Estonia, and was educated at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum, where he had the poet Alexander Pushkin as a school-fellow. He became a good classical scholar, and learned to speak and write in French with facility and elegance. Pushkin in one of his poems described young Gorchakov as &quot;Fortune&#x27;s favoured son&quot;, and predicted his success.

On leaving the lyceum Gorchakov entered the foreign office under Count Nesselrode. His first diplomatic work of importance was the negotiation of a marriage between the Grand Duchess Olga and the crown prince Charles of Württemberg. He remained at Stuttgart for some years as Russian minister and confidential adviser of the crown princess. He foretold the outbreak of the revolutionary spirit in Germany and Austria, and was credited with counselling the abdication of Ferdinand I of Austria in favour of Francis Joseph. When the German Confederation was re-established in 1850 in place of the Frankfurt Parliament, Gorchakov was appointed Russian minister to the diet. It was here that he first met Prince Bismarck, with whom he formed a friendship which was afterwards renewed at St Petersburg.

The Emperor Nicholas found that his ambassador at Vienna, Baron Meyendorff, was not a sympathetic instrument for carrying out his schemes in the East. He therefore transferred Gorchakov to Vienna, where the latter remained through the critical period of the Crimean War. Gorchakov perceived that Russian designs against the Ottoman Empire, which was supported by Britain and France, were impracticable, and he counselled Russia to make no more useless sacrifices, but to accept the basis of a pacification. At the same time, although he attended the Paris conference of 1856, he purposely abstained from affixing his signature to the treaty of peace after that of Count Alexey Fyodorovich Orlov, Russia&#x27;s chief representative. For the time, however, he made a virtue of necessity, and Alexander II, recognising the wisdom and courage which Gorchakov had exhibited, appointed him minister of foreign affairs in place of Count Nesselrode.

== Minister of foreign affairs ==
Not long after his accession to office, Gorchakov issued a circular to the foreign powers in which he announced that Russia proposed, for internal reasons, to keep herself as free as possible from complications abroad, and he added the now-historic phrase, &quot;La Russie ne boude pas; elle se recueille&quot; (&#x27;Russia is not sulking, she is composing herself&#x27;). During the January Uprising in Congress Poland, Gorchakov rebuffed the suggestions of Britain, Austria and France for assuaging the severities employed in quelling it, and he was especially acrid in his replies to Earl Russell&#x27;s despatches. The Prussian support was assured by the Alvensleben Convention. In July 1863 Gorchakov was appointed Chancellor of the Russian Empire, expressly in reward for his bold diplomatic attitude towards an indignant Europe. The appointment was hailed with enthusiasm in Russia.

A rapprochement now began between the courts of Russia and Prussia, and in 1863, Gorchakov smoothed the way for the occupation of Schleswig-Holstein by German troops. That seemed equally favourable to Austria and Prussia, but it was the latter power that gained all the substantial advantages. When conflict arose between Austria and Prussia in 1866, Russia remained neutral and permitted Prussia to reap the benefits arising from the conflict and establish its supremacy in Germany.

In 1867 Russia and the United States concluded the sale of Alaska, a process which had begun as early as 1854 during the Crimean War. Gorchakov was not against the sale but always advocated for careful and secret negotiations and saw the eventuality of the sale but not the immediate necessity.

When the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 broke out, Russia argued for the neutrality of Austria-Hungary. An attempt was made to form an anti-Prussian coalition, but it failed because of the cordial understanding between the German and the Russian chancellors.

In return for Russia&#x27;s service in preventing Austro-Hungarian support being given to France, Gorchakov looked to Bismarck for diplomatic support on the Eastern Question, and he received an instalment of the expected support when he successfully denounced the Black Sea clauses of the Treaty of Paris (Treaty of London (1871)). That was justly regarded by him as an important service to his country and one of the triumphs of his career, and he hoped to obtain further successes with the assistance of Germany. However, the cordial relations between the cabinets of Saint Petersburg and Berlin did not last much longer.
In 1875, Bismarck was suspected of having designs to again attack France, and Gorchakov let him know in a way that was not meant to be offensive, but roused Bismarck&#x27;s indignation, that Russia would oppose any such scheme. The tension thus produced between the two statesmen was increased by the political complications of 1875–1878 in Southeastern Europe, which began with the Herzegovian insurrection and culminated at the Congress of Berlin. Gorchakov hoped to use the complications of the situation in such a way as to recover, without war, the portion of Bessarabia ceded by the Treaty of Paris, but he soon lost control of events, and the Slavophile agitation produced the Russo-Turkish War (1877-78).

The Peace of San Stefano, drafted by Gorchakov, Aleksandr Nelidov, and Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev, redrew Ottoman boundaries to further Russia&#x27;s economic and strategic plans. A key goal was control of the port city of Batumi on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, in addition to several strategic points in the Caucasus. Most importantly, Bulgaria was greatly enlarged to serve as the dominant power in the Balkans and be under Russian control. Britain, France, Germany and Austria-Hungary objected and radically reduced Russia&#x27;s gains at the Congress of Berlin (13 June to 13 July 1878). Gorchakov was honored as first plenipotentiary, but he left to the second plenipotentiary, Count Pyotr Andreyevich Shuvalov, not only the task of defending Russian interests but also the responsibility and odium for the concessions which Russia had to make to Britain and Austria-Hungary. He had the satisfaction of seeing the lost portion of Bessarabia restored to Russia but at the cost of greater sacrifices than he anticipated. On the whole Russia was humiliated again. Gorchakov considered the treaty the greatest failure of his official career. He continued to hold the post of foreign minister but lived chiefly abroad, with Dmitry Milyutin taking responsibility for foreign affairs.

==Later life==
Gorchakov resigned formally in 1882 and was succeeded by Nicholas de Giers. He died at Baden-Baden and was buried at the family vault in Strelna Monastery.

== Assessment ==
Prince Gorchakov devoted himself mostly to foreign affairs but also took some part in the great internal reforms of Alexander II&#x27;s reign: for example he submitted four projects of emancipation reform and also presented to analysis of the foreign experience of various reforms to Alexander II.

As a diplomat, he displayed many brilliant qualities: adroitness in negotiation, incisiveness in argument and elegance in style. His statesmanship, though marred occasionally by personal vanity and love of popular applause, was far-seeing and prudent. In the latter part of his career, his main object was to raise the prestige of Russia by undoing the results of the Crimean War, and it may fairly be said that he greatly succeeded.

<text>Cecília Benevides de Carvalho Meireles (7 November 1901 – 9 November 1964) was a Brazilian writer and educator, known principally as a poet. She is a canonical name of Brazilian Modernism, one of the great female poets in the Portuguese language, and is widely considered the best female poet from Brazil, though she objected to the word &quot;poetess&quot; because of gender discrimination.

She traveled in the Americas in the 1940s, visiting the United States, Mexico, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. In the summer of 1940, she gave lectures at the University of Texas, Austin. She wrote two poems about her time in the capital of Texas, and a long (800 lines) very socially aware poem &quot;USA 1940&quot;, which was published posthumously. As a journalist her columns (&quot;crônicas&quot;, or chronicles) focused most often on education, but also on her trips abroad in the western hemisphere, Portugal, other parts of Europe, Israel, and India (where she received an honorary doctorate).

As a poet, her style was mostly neosymbolist and her themes included ephemeral time and the contemplative life. Even though she was not concerned with local color, native vernacular, or experiments in (popular) syntax, she is considered one of the most important poets of the second phase of the Brazilian Modernism, known for nationalistic vanguardism. As a teacher she did much to promote educational reforms and advocated the construction of children&#x27;s libraries. Between 1935 and 1938, she taught at the short-lived federal-district university in Rio.

==Biography==
Meireles was &quot;orphaned at age three and raised by her maternal grandmother&quot; (Tapscott 160). As a poet, she made her debut at the age of eighteen, with &quot;Espectros&quot; (1919). It has been described as &quot;an airy and vague poetry, languid and fluid, set in an atmosphere of shadows and dreams.&quot; The collection of seventeen sonnets dealt with various historical personages. Although her next collections included lyrics in free verse, she still preferred traditional forms and symbolism. Between 1919 and 1927, she contributed to the magazines &quot;Árvore Nova&quot; and &quot;Terra do Sol&quot;. She was a key figure in the spiritual and transcendental magazine &quot;Festa&quot;. The Festa poets supported more traditional expression and universality than the futurists and avant-garde writers of São Paulo, whose Modern Art Week in 1922 caused much controversy. Meireles always retained symbolist traits. Especially Portuguese poetry interested her. She visited Portugal in 1934 and lectured there on Brazilian literature at the universities of Lisbon and Coimbra.

After 14 years without publishing a book of poetry, Meireles published one of her major works, &quot;Viagem&quot; [Voyage] (1939), which marked her poetic maturity. The book had received the annual Poetry Prize from the Brazilian Academy of Letters in 1938. The title refers to a spiritual journey where life and poetry join together. Meireles was a devout Catholic, but did not emphasize her religious or social stands. In the 1940s Meireles traveled widely and the sea became for her an important image. &quot;Mar Absoluto&quot; (1942) was sea poetry with the qualities of so-called pure poetry. In 1953 she participated in a symposium on the work of Gandhi, and India had a great influence on her work. She had taught herself both Hindi and Sanskrit. &quot;Romanceiro da Inconfidência&quot; (1953) was written in the style of medieval Iberian ballads. The work draws its subject from the first colonial attempt at Brazilian Independence, in Minas Gerais in 1789, and centers on the leader of the uprising, Joaquim José da Silva Xavier, who was hailed as another Jesus Christ. &quot;Giroflê, Giroflá&quot; (1956) was based on the author&#x27;s journeys to India and Italy.

Meireles was a prolific contributor to Brazilian periodicals, and for a time she served as education editor of Rio&#x27;s &quot;Diario de Noticías&quot;. She translated into Portuguese such diverse writers as Maeterlinck, Federico García Lorca, Anouilh, Ibsen, Tagore, Rilke, Virginia Woolf, and Pushkin. Her other works include plays and children&#x27;s books. Cecília Meireles died of cancer in Rio de Janeiro on 9 November 1964, two days after her 63rd birthday. During her career Meireles was affected by many of the literary movements of her time. However, her poetry always remained intensely personal.

In October 2009 she was one of the three featured authors at the &quot;Primeiro Congresso de Escritoras Brasileiras em Nova Iorque&quot; (First Congress of Brazilian Women Writers in New York) at the Centro Cultural Brasil / Brazilian Endowment for the Arts in Midtown Manhattan.

<text>USS &quot;Lamson&quot; (DD–18) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first ship named for Roswell Lamson.

==Construction==
&quot;Lamson&quot; was laid down on 18 March 1908, by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, launched on 16 June 1909, sponsored by Mrs. Henry S. Grove, and commissioned on 10 February 1910.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===
Assigned to the Atlantic Squadron, &quot;Lamson&quot; operated along the east coast and in the Caribbean from 1910 to 1916 participating in torpedo exercises, fleet maneuvers, and coastal patrol. Departing Key West, Florida on 7 May 1916, the destroyer arrived Dominican Republic two days later to support the Marines sent by President Woodrow Wilson to protect American interests during the Dominican revolt.

She returned to Key West in mid-June before sailing on the 28th for Vera Cruz. She joined other American ships in Mexican waters, as the Mexican political situation was still in turmoil. Following her return to Key West on 11 July, &quot;Lamson&quot; operated along the east coast and in the Gulf of Mexico until the United States entered World War I.

===World War I===
During the early months of the war, she patrolled the coastline before preparing for oversea service. Arriving Ponta Delgada, Azores on 26 July 1917, the destroyer performed escort and patrol duty for the next three months. &quot;Lamson&quot; departed the Azores on 6 October for escort operations out of Brest, France. She assisted survivors of &quot;Finland&quot; on 28 October after the merchant ship had been torpedoed by a German submarine.

The destroyer continued escort and patrol operations for the rest of the war, and aided in the victory of Allied forces by neutralizing the German U-boat threat to convoys. After the Armistice, &quot;Lamson&quot; departed Brest on 11 December 1918 and arrived at Charleston, South Carolina on 31 December. She decommissioned on 15 July 1919 and was sold on 21 November.

<doc id="1270374" wikidata="Q2729185" url="?curid=1270374" title="Bennett Park (New York City)">
<text>Bennett Park, also known as James Gordon Bennett Park, is a public park in New York City, named for James Gordon Bennett, Sr., the newspaper publisher who launched the &quot;New York Herald&quot; in 1835. It is located between Pinehurst and Fort Washington Avenues and West 183rd and 185th Streets in the Hudson Heights neighborhood of Washington Heights in northern Manhattan, on land purchased by Bennett in 1871, the year before his death. It sits opposite the northern Fort Washington Avenue entrance to the 181st Street subway station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line, serviced by the .

Bennett, Sr. passed ownership of the land – which included the site of Fort Washington, from which the Continental Army delayed the advance of British troops in 1776 – to his son, James Gordon Bennett, Jr., who in 1901 allowed the Sons of the American Revolution to erect a marble, bronze and granite stele designed by Charles R. Lamb to commemorate the battle. This was dedicated in 1901 and is now located on the eastern perimeter wall of the park. 

Bennett intended to donate the land to the city for use as a park, but died in 1918 without adding that bequest to his will. The land was therefore divided for sale, but the request of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society that the part of the property where Fort Washington stood be preserved was honored. In 1928, the site was acquired by the city, and, with additional land, was turned over to the Parks Department. The park opened in 1929.

In 1932, in commemoration of the bicentennial of the birth of George Washington, the Washington Heights Honor Grove Association planted an American elm tree, which is indicated with a marker. Other memorials in the park include the Emilio Barbosa Memorial, given in 1996 by Joseph Barbosa to honor his father, who died on the USS &quot;Nevada&quot; at Okinawa in 1945.

On the west side of the park lies an outcropping of Manhattan schist, which is the highest natural point in Manhattan – above sea level – with a square stone marker attesting to the fact. The schist is part of the bedrock foundation of New York City, which allows the construction of skyscrapers where it lies close to the surface.

The park&#x27;s playground was constructed in the 1940s, and service buildings were added in 1964.

Bennett Park hosts a variety of events, such as the Revolutionary War Reenactment, which Redcoats and George Washington&#x27;s army actors converge and fight in the park, reenacting the battle of Fort Washington. An annual Harvest Festival is held in the park&#x27;s field. 

As part of the &quot;Northern Manhattan Parks 2030 Master Plan&quot;, devised in 2010–11, the playground and comfort station in Bennett Park will be reconfigured to &quot;improve sight-lines and play value.&quot; In addition, the condition of the park&#x27;s perimeter will be improved.

<text>Felim Egan (8 November 1952 – 19 November 2020) was an Irish painter.

==Biography==
Born in County Donegal, Egan attended St Columb&#x27;s College in Derry before studying Art in Belfast and Portsmouth and at the Slade School of Art in London. He lived and worked in Sandymount, Dublin, Ireland. He painted restrained abstracts in which ghostly squares appear to float to the edge of a monochromatic canvas. The ethereal quality of his paintings owes itself in part to his technique of building up colour by applying layer after layer of thin acrylic mixed with powdered stone.

He represented Ireland at the Paris Biennale in 1980 and the São Paulo Art Biennial in 1985. In 1993 he won the Premier UNESCO Prize for the Arts in Paris, and he received the Gold Award at Cagnes-sur-Mer in 1997. Felim Egan was a member of Aosdána. Major exhibitions of his work were held at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester and the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin in 1995–96, and at the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam in 1999.

<doc id="1270413" wikidata="Q16243651" url="?curid=1270413" title="The Beaver (newspaper)">
<text>The Beaver is the fortnightly newspaper of the LSE Students&#x27; Union at the London School of Economics, England.

&quot;The Beaver&quot; has had some of its stories being picked up by the national press. One thousand copies are published and distributed around campus every other Tuesday during term time. Articles are also published online daily. &quot;The Beaver&quot; is governed its society which is free for any LSE student to join. The paper is made up of sections News, Opinion and Features in addition to its magazine &quot;Flipside&quot;. The Beaver also produces &quot;Beaver Sound,&quot; a multimedia podcast platform.

==History==
Named after the school&#x27;s mascot, the beaver, which was chosen &quot;as representing an industrious animal with social habits&quot;, &quot;The Beaver&quot; newspaper was first published in its recognised format on 5 May 1949, and is one of the oldest student newspapers in the UK. The British Library of Political and Economic Science holds print and digital archives of the paper dating back to this first issue, which was christened by George Bernard Shaw, one of the LSE&#x27;s founders. Since then it has gone through several makeovers, survived LSE&#x27;s turbulent history and emerged to be one of the most respected and widely read student newspapers in the UK.

==News==
&quot;The Beaver&quot;″s news section has consistently been among the strongest in UK student media, consisting of LSE, University of London and Higher Education stories from across Britain, sometimes being quoted in the national press, including &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Telegraph&quot;.

==Opinion==
Opinion publishes pieces discussing issues that are relevant to the LSE community, political analysis, social commentary, and debate. The extensive range of articles and letters featured reflects the broad readership of the paper. Contributions to the Comment section have been wide-ranging and varied, from former LSE Director Sir Howard Davies to lay students. The name of the section was changed from Comment to Opinion in 2020.

==Features==
The Features section of the paper deals with international relations, politics and strategic affairs. Interviews are a quintessential part of the section, and previous interviews conducted by Taryana Odayar have been with Economics Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen; ministers such as Marcelo Neri, the former Brazilian Minister of Strategic Affairs; North Korean defector Hyeonseo Lee; Dr Mattia Romani, Managing Director for Country and Sector Economics at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; and academics such as German Historian Sonke Neitzel. Other prominent interviewees have been Sir Nicholas Stern and Queen Noor of Jordan, and Ambassadors such as the Lithuanian Ambassador to the UK. In 2019, the Features section interviewed Alastair Campbell, former communications director to UK Prime Minister Tony Blair.

== Flipside==
Launched in 2018, &quot;Flipside&quot; encapsulates all the magazine sections of the Beaver. The primary feature of &quot;Flipside&quot; is a fortnightly interview featuring one or more prominent members of the LSE community. It also features sections which previously belonged to The Beaver – Sport and Part B – and created the new sections Social and Review. The name Flipside is a reference to the fact that relative to the other sections of the paper it is printed upside down which requires the user to flip the paper around to read it.

== Beaver Sound==
The Beaver Sound is the newspaper&#x27;s new multimedia podcast platform for news since 2019. The platform features series such as LSE Limelight, Crossing the Globe, Grimshaw Speakers, Guftagu (in collaboration with LSESU Pakistan Society), The LSE Starter Pack, and We Know The End.

<text>TransBrasil was a Brazilian airline which ceased operations on 3 December 2001. During most of its history, Transbrasil was owned by local entrepreneur Omar Fontana. Its aircraft usually featured a colorful livery, remarkably with a rainbow on the tail fin. Transbrasil&#x27;s base was President Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport in Brasília. From the 1970s and until its demise in 2002, Transbrasil was usually the third largest Brazilian airline after Varig and VASP, serving both domestic and international routes.

==History==
===First years as Sadia (1955–1972)===
Transbrasil was born in the State of Santa Catarina as a sister company of S/A Indústria e Comércio Concórdia, better known by its acronym Sadia. In 1953 Omar Fontana, a pilot and one of the sons of the founder of Sadia Attilio Fontana, noticed that a Douglas DC-3 remained parked at Joaçaba Airport, near Concórdia, for the entire weekend. Omar Fontana came up with the idea of leasing the aircraft for transporting the products of Sadia to São Paulo. In 1954 Sadia acquired its own Douglas DC-3 and started daily flights to São Paulo–Congonhas Airport, having Omar as one of its crew members. However, since it was not an airline with a regular schedule, it could not receive subventions from the government. In order to avoid this restriction, on January 5, 1955 Omar Fontana founded Sadia S/A – Transportes Aéreos with 35 employees, 3 Douglas DC-3s and 2 Curtiss C-46s. The first regular flight was operated on March 16, 1956.

Sadia enlarged Concórdia Airport so that a Douglas DC-3 could operate with full load and created the first route linking Concórdia with Videira, Florianópolis, and São Paulo–Congonhas. A short time later, Sadia was also operating to Londrina, Bauru, Ribeirão Preto and Brasília.

In November 1957, Sadia established a partnership with Real Transportes Aéreos and became a feeder airline at Florianópolis. Whereas Real&#x27;s Linneu Gomes got 50% of the shares of Sadia, Omar Fontana became part of the managing board of Real, where he gained airline experience. At this time Sadia moved its headquarters to São Paulo and expanded services to Rio de Janeiro–Santos Dumont and Porto Alegre. This partnership ended in 1961 with the demise of Real and Fontana bought back the shares he had earlier sold to Gomes.

In 1962 Sadia bought TASSA–Transportes Aéreos Salvador S/A and increased its presence in Bahia. Its fleet had now 15 Douglas DC-3s and 12 Curtiss C-46s serving 53 cities.

In 1967 most of Sadia network was eligible to receive subventions from the Federal government and aiming at those subventions Sadia bought five Handley Page Dart Heralds. In 1968 Sadia joined the shuttle service () between Rio de Janeiro-Santos Dumont and São Paulo-Congonhas airports, operated since 1959 by Varig, Cruzeiro do Sul and VASP. This service was abandoned only in 1999.

The first jet airliner type to be introduced into the fleet of Sadia, a stretched BAC One-Eleven Series 500, entered into service on September 17, 1970. In 1972 the name of the airline was changed to Transbrasil S/A Linhas Aéreas and its headquarters were moved to Brasília.
===Consolidation as Transbrasil (1972–1983)===
* 1973 - Transbrasil replaces its ageing Dart Heralds by new Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante light transport turboprops.
* 1974 - Transbrasil starts to phase out its remainder Bandeirantes, Heralds and 1-11s, replacing them with Boeing 727-100. By 1979, its fleet consisted only of 727-100s.
* 1983 - Its first Boeing 767-200 is delivered, and Transbrasil starts its international operations, initially with charter flights - and from 1989, with regular service - to Miami, Orlando and Washington D.C.

===Apogee and downturn (1983–2003)===


In 1990 Transbrasil fleet consisted of three 767-200, three Boeing 707 for cargo and passenger service (operated by its affiliated company, Aerobrasil) and 15 leased Boeing 737-300 and -400. In addition to domestic flights to most of the larger Brazilian cities, Transbrasil offered regular and charter service to Miami, Orlando, New York, Washington, Buenos Aires, Vienna, Amsterdam, London and even Beijing. During some time, due to discounted ticket prices and an aggressive commercial strategy Transbrasil surpassed VASP as the second largest Brazilian airline.

Despite its growing market share, Transbrasil was already experiencing financial problems. In 1987 after a formal request of its chairman Omar Fontana, Brazilian government took over Transbrasil management. However, soon Fontana started to disagree with the Brazilian Air Force officers nominated to run the company and in 1989 the intervention was cancelled. After Fontana stepped out from Transbrasil management due to health issues, the company was run by his son-in-law Celso Cipriani - a former police officer with no previous experience on airline management. Cipriani tenure on Transbrasil was controversial, and he has been formally charged with fraud, embezzlement of funds and property and mismanagement since then.

On January 14, 1994, Transbrasil created its regional subsidiary Interbrasil STAR to operate as feeder-carrier. Services started on July 3, 1995. 

In addition to the management problems, Transbrasil was also facing other difficulties, specially the reduced or no profit from its international routes, severe competition from other companies in the domestic front (specially TAM, a former air taxi company with a growing fleet) and growing expenses. Following the September 11 attacks, despite several government loans, Transbrasil was amassing huge debts with several suppliers. When Shell refused to further supply fuel without payment, Transbrasil&#x27;s then aging and reduced fleet was grounded on 3 December 2001. It never returned to the air, and was declared bankrupt in 2003 at the request of one of its major debtors - GE Capital Aviation Services.

===After bankruptcy (2003–2010)===
On 16 September 2009 the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court began the analysis of the legality of the bankruptcy of Transbrasil. The bankruptcy was confirmed on 2 October 2009.

That same year, the Public Ministry was preparing to file charges against the senior management of the company. The main accused being Celso Cipriani, who allegedly committed crimes that hastened the company&#x27;s demise.

In 2010, the debt which caused the bankruptcy of Transbrasil was invalidated by the Court of Justice of São Paulo.

On 15 February 2023, it was announced that the airframes of PT-TAA and PT-TAB would be moved away after being abandoned for 21 years at Brasília Airport. This finally happened on 17 February 2023.

==Destinations==

Transbrasil operated scheduled services to the destinations below. The list includes destinations served by subsidiaries Interbrasil STAR, Aerobrasil and also destinations operated under the airline original name Sadia.
==Fleet==

==Airline Affinity Program==
TransPass was the Frequent-flyer program of Transbrasil. Points could be used on Transbrasil and Interbrasil STAR services. Points held at the time of the airline&#x27;s collapse lost their value as no other airline took over the program. 

==Accidents and incidents==
===As Sadia===
* 4 August 1963: a Douglas C-49E registration PP-SLL en route from Joaçaba to Videira crashed into a hill when approaching Videira under poor visibility. All 10 occupants died.
* 3 November 1967: a Handley Page Dart Herald 214 registration PP-SDJ flying from São Paulo-Congonhas to Curitiba-Afonso Pena collided with a hill during approach to land at Curitiba. All crew and 21 passengers died, 4 passengers survived.
* 16 March 1968: Douglas C-47A-35-DL (DC-3) registration PP-AST en route from Miami to Arica Chile crashed near Tacna. All 4 occupants died.

===As Transbrasil===
* 22 January 1976: an Embraer EMB 110C Bandeirante registration PT-TBD operating flight 107 from Chapecó to Erechim, crashed upon take-off from Chapecó. Seven of the nine passengers and crew on board died.
* 12 April 1980: a Boeing 727-27C registration PT-TYS operating flight 303 flying from São Paulo-Congonhas to Florianópolis was on a night instrumental approach to Florianópolis Airport under a severe thunderstorm. The aircraft went off course, struck a hill and exploded. Probable causes are misjudgment of speed and distance, inadequate flight supervision, failure to initiate a go-around and improper operation of the engines. Of the 58 passengers and crew aboard, 3 passengers survived.
* 21 March 1989: Flight 801, a cargo Boeing 707-349C registration PT-TCS, flying from Manaus to São Paulo-Guarulhos, crashed at the district of Vila Barros in Guarulhos, shortly before touch-down at runway 09R. That day, at 12:00 the runway was going to be closed for maintenance and the crew decided to speed up procedures to touch-down before closure (it was already 11:54). In a hurry, one of the crew members, by mistake, activated the air-dynamic brakes and the aircraft lost too much speed to have enough aerodynamic support (Stall). As a consequence the aircraft crashed at approximately 2 km from the airport. There were 25 fatalities which of these three were crew members and 22 were civilians on the accident site. As well as the 22 fatalities, there were also over 200 injured on the ground. This aircraft was used in the filming of the movie &quot;Airport&quot;.

<text>Roswell Hawkes Lamson (30 March 1838 – 14 August 1903) was an officer in the United States Navy during the American Civil War.

==Biography==
Born in Burlington, Iowa, Lamson accompanied his natal family as Oregon Trail pioneers of 1847. He was appointed to the United States Naval Academy on 20 September 1858, with the rank of acting-midshipman, the first Oregonian to receive an appointment. After graduating in 1862, completing his training on active duty, he saw action in the Civil War. 

Promoted to lieutenant on August 1, 1862, he commanded the gunboat in joint Army-Navy operations on the Nansemond River, and played an important role in the capture of batteries at Hill&#x27;s Point in April 1863.

On 2 May 1864, at the New York Navy Yard, Lamson commissioned the gunboat , a former blockade runner captured off Wilmington, North Carolina, in November 1863. He spent the next seven months commanding &quot;Gettysburg&quot; while stationed off the Cape Fear River, as part of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, capturing several ships. 

Lamson was in the forefront of the attacks on Fort Fisher, which stood at the entrance of the Cape Fear River protecting the approach to Wilmington. In December 1864, an attempt was made to reduce the fort by means of a &quot;powder boat&quot; – in effect a floating bomb. The plan, concocted by General Benjamin F. Butler, called for the steamer to be loaded with 215 tons of gunpowder and sailed under the walls of the fort and detonated, destroying the fortifications and stunning the garrison into submission. On the night of December 23/24, the &quot;Louisiana&quot;, under Commander Alexander Rhind, was towed by , commanded by Lamson, to within 300 yards of the fort. Rhind set the fuzes and he and his crew abandoned ship, and were picked up by &quot;Wilderness&quot;, which promptly sailed for safety. After 80 minutes the ship finally exploded. Unfortunately the tide and an offshore breeze had moved the &quot;Louisiana&quot; further away from the fort, and the explosion had no effect. 

During the second attack, on January 15, 1865, after a preliminary naval bombardment, Lamson led a landing party of sailors and marines from &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, as part of a naval force assaulting the sea face of Fort Fisher, while the army attacked the landward face. Lamson and his men were pinned down under the ramparts of the fort by enemy fire, spending the night in a ditch. However, the attack by the navy diverted enough of the defenders to make the army assault successful, and the fort was taken. Lamson&#x27;s friend and fellow officer Samuel W. Preston was killed in the assault.

Lamson resigned from the Navy on July 6, 1866, and returned to Oregon, where he was appointed to be clerk of U.S. Customs. On January 9, 1895, he was reappointed lieutenant and placed on the retired list on April 15, 1895.

Lamson died in Portland, Oregon, on 14 August 1903.

Three U.S. Navy destroyers have been named in his honor.

<text>The Uwharrie Mountains () are a mountain range in North Carolina spanning the counties of Randolph, Montgomery, Stanly, and Davidson. The range&#x27;s foothills stretch into Cabarrus, Anson, Union, and Richmond counties.

The Uwharries were once a coastal mountain range; isostasy has slowly raised the eastern seabed until today they lie in the Piedmont of North Carolina over from the coast. Formed approximately 500 million years ago by accretion along the Gondwanan tectonic plate, they are thought to have once peaked at some , before eroding to a maximum of just over . The range&#x27;s high point is High Rock Mountain ( as measured by the NC Geodetic Survey), in southwestern Davidson County.

The Uwharrie lie within the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion. They give their name to the Uwharrie National Forest. Once entirely cleared for timber and farmland, the mountains were designated a U.S. National Forest in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. The woodlands have since returned, providing a haven for a diversity of wildlife, recreational facilities, and numerous Native American archeological sites.

In 1799, the discovery of gold at the nearby Reed Gold Mine in Cabarrus County led to America&#x27;s first gold rush.

The North Carolina Zoo, America&#x27;s first state-supported zoo, is located in the Uwharries region.

The Caraway Mountains, a segment of the Uwharries, are located in western Randolph County, west of Asheboro.

<doc id="1270458" wikidata="Q1313257" url="?curid=1270458" title="Eisenstein series">
<text>Eisenstein series, named after German mathematician Gotthold Eisenstein, are particular modular forms with infinite series expansions that may be written down directly. Originally defined for the modular group, Eisenstein series can be generalized in the theory of automorphic forms.

== Eisenstein series for the modular group ==

Let be a complex number with strictly positive imaginary part. Define the holomorphic Eisenstein series of weight , where is an integer, by the following series:

:formula_1

This series absolutely converges to a holomorphic function of in the upper half-plane and its Fourier expansion given below shows that it extends to a holomorphic function at . It is a remarkable fact that the Eisenstein series is a modular form. Indeed, the key property is its -covariance. Explicitly if and then

:formula_2

 \frac{1}{\left(m+n\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}\right)^{2k}} \\
&amp;= \sum_{(m,n) \in \Z^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}} \frac{(c\tau+d)^{2k}}{(md+nb+(mc+na)\tau)^{2k}} \\
&amp;= \sum_{\left(m&#x27;,n&#x27;\right) = (m,n)\begin{pmatrix}d \ \ c\\b \ \ a\end{pmatrix}\atop (m,n)\in \Z^2 \setminus \{(0,0)\}} \frac{(c\tau+d)^{2k}}{\left(m&#x27;+n&#x27;\tau\right)^{2k}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If then
:formula_3
so that
:formula_4
is a bijection , i.e.:
:formula_5

Overall, if then
:formula_6

and is therefore a modular form of weight . Note that it is important to assume that , otherwise it would be illegitimate to change the order of summation, and the -invariance would not hold. In fact, there are no nontrivial modular forms of weight 2. Nevertheless, an analogue of the holomorphic Eisenstein series can be defined even for , although it would only be a quasimodular form.


Note that is necessary such that the series converges absolutely, whereas needs to be even otherwise the sum vanishes because the and terms cancel out. For the series converges but it is not a modular form.

== Relation to modular invariants ==
The modular invariants and of an elliptic curve are given by the first two Eisenstein series:

:formula_7

The article on modular invariants provides expressions for these two functions in terms of theta functions.

== Recurrence relation ==
Any holomorphic modular form for the modular group can be written as a polynomial in and . Specifically, the higher order can be written in terms of and through a recurrence relation. Let , so for example, and . Then the satisfy the relation

:formula_8

for all . Here, formula_9 is the binomial coefficient.

The occur in the series expansion for the Weierstrass&#x27;s elliptic functions:

:formula_10

== Fourier series ==



Define . (Some older books define to be the nome , but is now standard in number theory.) Then the Fourier series of the Eisenstein series is

:formula_11

where the coefficients are given by

:formula_12

Here, are the Bernoulli numbers, is Riemann&#x27;s zeta function and is the divisor sum function, the sum of the th powers of the divisors of . In particular, one has

:formula_13

The summation over can be resummed as a Lambert series; that is, one has

:formula_14

for arbitrary complex and . When working with the -expansion of the Eisenstein series, this alternate notation is frequently introduced:

:formula_15

== Identities involving Eisenstein series ==

=== As theta functions ===
Source:

Given , let

:formula_16

and define the Jacobi theta functions which normally uses the nome ,

:formula_17

where and are alternative notations. Then we have the symmetric relations,

:formula_18

Basic algebra immediately implies

:formula_19

an expression related to the modular discriminant,

:formula_20

The third symmetric relation, on the other hand, is a consequence of and .

=== Products of Eisenstein series ===

Eisenstein series form the most explicit examples of modular forms for the full modular group . Since the space of modular forms of weight has dimension 1 for , different products of Eisenstein series having those weights have to be equal up to a scalar multiple. In fact, we obtain the identities:

:formula_21

Using the -expansions of the Eisenstein series given above, they may be restated as identities involving the sums of powers of divisors:

:formula_22

hence

:formula_23

and similarly for the others. The theta function of an eight-dimensional even unimodular lattice is a modular form of weight 4 for the full modular group, which gives the following identities:

:formula_24

for the number of vectors of the squared length in the root lattice of the type.

Similar techniques involving holomorphic Eisenstein series twisted by a Dirichlet character produce formulas for the number of representations of a positive integer &#x27; as a sum of two, four, or eight squares in terms of the divisors of .

Using the above recurrence relation, all higher can be expressed as polynomials in and . For example:

:formula_25

Many relationships between products of Eisenstein series can be written in an elegant way using Hankel determinants, e.g. Garvan&#x27;s identity

: formula_26

where

:formula_27

is the modular discriminant.

=== Ramanujan identities ===
Srinivasa Ramanujan gave several interesting identities between the first few Eisenstein series involving differentiation. Let

:formula_28

then

:formula_29

These identities, like the identities between the series, yield arithmetical convolution identities involving the sum-of-divisor function. Following Ramanujan, to put these identities in the simplest form it is necessary to extend the domain of to include zero, by setting

:formula_30

Then, for example

:formula_31

Other identities of this type, but not directly related to the preceding relations between , and functions, have been proved by Ramanujan and Giuseppe Melfi, as for example

:formula_32

== Generalizations ==
Automorphic forms generalize the idea of modular forms for general Lie groups; and Eisenstein series generalize in a similar fashion.

Defining to be the ring of integers of a totally real algebraic number field , one then defines the Hilbert–Blumenthal modular group as . One can then associate an Eisenstein series to every cusp of the Hilbert–Blumenthal modular group.

<doc id="1270468" wikidata="Q1779880" url="?curid=1270468" title="The Hurting">
<text>The Hurting is the debut studio album by British new wave band Tears for Fears, released on 7 March 1983 by Mercury Records distributed by Phonogram Inc. The album peaked at No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart in its second week of release and was certified Gold by the BPI within three weeks of release. The album also entered the Top 40 in several other countries including Canada, Germany, and Australia. It was certified Platinum in the UK in January 1985.

&quot;The Hurting&quot; is a loose concept album focusing on themes of child abuse, psychological trauma and depression. Despite its dark subject matter, the album was a huge commercial success. It contains Tears for Fears&#x27; first three hit singles – &quot;Mad World&quot;, &quot;Change&quot;, and &quot;Pale Shelter&quot; – all of which reached the top five in the UK and the Top 40 internationally. It also contains a new version of the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Suffer the Children&quot;, which had originally been released in 1981, while the album version of &quot;Pale Shelter&quot; is also a new recording. The album initially received mixed reviews but attracted retrospective critical acclaim.

The album was remastered and reissued in 1999, and included four remixes as bonus tracks and an extensive booklet with liner notes about the album&#x27;s creation. A 30th anniversary reissue was released on 21 October 2013, in both double-CD and deluxe four-disc boxed set editions. For the album&#x27;s 40th anniversary, new Dolby Atmos and 5.1 surround sound Blu-ray remixes by Steven Wilson, as well as a remastered vinyl edition of the original mix, was released in June 2023.

==Writing and recording==
After their band Graduate broke up in 1981, Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith formed a band with the name History of Headaches. Both took an interest in the work of psychotherapist Arthur Janov and renamed the band Tears for Fears after a phrase from his book.

The songs were written by Orzabal inspired by his own childhood traumas and the primal theories of Janov. Most of the songs were heavily inspired by the writings of Janov. &quot;Ideas as Opiates&quot; was named after a chapter in his 1980 book &quot;Prisoners of Pain&quot;, which also was a direct influence on the song &quot;The Prisoner&quot;. Musical influences included Gary Numan, Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel and Joy Division. 

Having worked with different producers on their first two singles, they recruited Chris Hughes to produce the album. The core of the band Orzabal and Smith worked in a close and democratic collaboration with producers Hughes and Ross Cullum, only using ideas all four of them agreed on. Prior to the album &quot;Mad World&quot;, originally thought of as a single b-side, was released and became a hit single. The first two singles &quot;Suffer the Children&quot; and &quot;Pale Shelter&quot; were re-recorded for the album.

== Critical reception ==
===Contemporary===
Contemporary reviews of the album were mixed. In &quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine, Fred Dellar gave the album a positive review and stated that &quot;there&#x27;s no doubting the talent on display.&quot; 

In the &quot;NME&quot; Gavin Martin&#x27;s review was negative, stating that &quot;this record and others like it are a terrible, useless sort of art that makes self pity and futility a commercial proposition&quot;, and that &quot;Tears for Fears and their listeners sound like they&#x27;ve given up completely, retreating from the practical world into a fantasy&quot;. He described the album&#x27;s music as &quot;just the sort of doom laden dross you&#x27;d expect from the lyrics: rehashed and reheated hollow doom with a bit of Ultravox here, diluted Joy Division poured everywhere, and the title track sounding suspiciously like one of the old pompous outfits with a welter of mellotrons – Barclay James Harvest per chance?&quot; 

&quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s Steve Sutherland felt that &quot;Tears for Fears&#x27;s pop primal therapy tends to luxuriate in the attention it attracts, sounds ironically happy to wallow inspirationally instead of seeking exorcism&quot;. However, he observed that &quot;the Tears for Fears formula – to translate childhood traumas into adult romance with Freudian fanaticism – is ludicrously laboured but, crucially, their lyrical lethargy is salvaged by what really sells them; their structural invention... sensibly, their suffering&#x27;s usually controlled to sound smooth&quot;, and that this was the strength of the record: &quot;The success of &quot;The Hurting&quot; lies in its lack of friction, in its safety and, for all their claims that coping with relationships has been warped beyond their ken, Tears for Fears have contrived an assured masterpiece of seduction&quot;.

In the US David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;Tears for Fears stand out among the current crop of identikit synth-pop groups by virtue of their resourceful, stylish songwriting and fetching rhythmic sway. Granted, the adolescent angst and bleak, pained romanticism of singer-instrumentalists Curt Smith and Roland Orzabel [&quot;sic&quot;] sometimes come off as an adequate imitation of Joy Division, at best. But for every lapse into sackcloth-and-ashes anguish on &quot;The Hurting&quot;, the duo&#x27;s debut album, there is a heady, danceable pop tune like &#x27;Change&#x27;... Tears for Fears may be too concerned with their own petty traumas, but it is a testimony to their refined pop instincts that they manage to produce this much pleasure from the pain.&quot;

===Retrospective===
Retrospective reviews regarded the album more highly. Reviewing the 1999 reissue for &quot;Q&quot;, Andrew Collins said, &quot;Despite its occasional bum note, &quot;The Hurting&quot; remains a landmark work... a highly emotional pop record, at its simplest&quot;. Bruce Eder of AllMusic noted that the album&#x27;s success was due to &quot;its makers&#x27; ability to package an unpleasant subject – the psychologically wretched family histories of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith – in an attractive and sellable musical format&quot; and said &quot;the work is sometimes uncomfortably personal, but musically compelling enough to bring it back across the decades&quot;.

For the 30th anniversary edition in 2013, Danny Eccleston of &quot;Mojo&quot; pondered, &quot;Has there ever been a more thoroughly miserable mainstream pop album than &quot;The Hurting&quot;?... Even when it is uptempo it is sombre, and at its most musically adventurous, in the cavernous minimalism of &#x27;Ideas as Opiates&#x27; and gnarly dissonances of &#x27;The Prisoner&#x27;, it&#x27;s almost unbearably bereft... But in essence, it was pop.&quot; 

Tom Byford of &quot;Record Collector&quot; summarised the album as &quot;a surfeit of complex ideas reflecting troubled upbringings married with immediate, infectious, hummable tunes&quot;. John Bergstrom of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that &quot;at times, the unflinching approach works to the album&#x27;s detriment, as Orzabal&#x27;s songwriting skirts cliché and the obtuse, teenage poetry that some critics seized on at the time of &quot;The Hurting&quot;″s release... But part of the brilliance of &quot;Hurting&quot; is that such histrionic moments are so seldom. Rather, time after time, as rendered by Orzabal and co-vocalist Curt Smith, the words connect at gut level and in sincere fashion.&quot; Calling the record &quot;simply one of the strongest, most fully-realized albums of the early-to-mid-1980s&quot;, Bergstrom noted its influence on later acts such as Trent Reznor, Smashing Pumpkins and Arcade Fire, and concluded, &quot;The albums that prove to be special, influential, and groundbreaking in their own time, and then in subsequent eras as well, are far and few between. Thirty years on, there is little doubt where &quot;The Hurting&quot; stands.&quot;

At least three of the songs from this particular album were sampled by one of the most mainstream R&amp;B artists. &quot;Memories Fade&quot; was reworked by Kanye West on his &quot;808s &amp; Heartbreak&quot; album into &quot;Coldest Winter&quot;. &quot;Pale Shelter&quot; was sampled by The Weeknd on the song &quot;Secrets&quot; on his &quot;Starboy&quot; album. &quot;Ideas as Opiates&quot; was sampled by Drake on the song &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, from his &quot;So Far Gone&quot; mixtape. 

&quot;Mad World&quot; was covered by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules originally for &quot;Donnie Darko&quot; soundtrack and later released as a single, topping UK Singles Charts.

== Track listing ==
All songs written by Roland Orzabal.

===Original release===


Notes
*† – The 1999 remastered version of the album incorrectly credits Curt Smith as co-writer and Mike Howlett as producer of &quot;Pale Shelter&quot; (Long Version). As confirmed on the original releases, Smith did not write any of the tracks for &quot;The Hurting&quot; and this version of &quot;Pale Shelter&quot; is actually the 1983 12&quot; extended version of the song, which was produced by Chris Hughes and Ross Cullum. Howlett produced the original 1982 version.
*†† – &quot;The Way You Are&quot; was originally a non-album track, although the 12&quot; version was included on the remastered version of &quot;The Hurting&quot; in 1999.

===30th anniversary editions (2013)===
Two deluxe editions of the album were released on 21 October 2013. One is a double CD comprising CDs 1 &amp; 2 (as below), and the other is a 4-disc boxed set comprising CDs 1–3 and a DVD (as below), a book containing interviews, a new essay from Paul Sinclair about the album, a replica of a 1983 tour programme, a discography and photos. The first 500 pre-orders from the Universal Music online store also included a vinyl 7&quot; single of &quot;Change&quot; in a rare earlier picture sleeve.

Notes
*† – Track 4, labeled as &quot;Ideas as Opiates (Alternate Version)&quot;, was intended to be the first version of the song (originally released as the B-side to &quot;Mad World&quot;) but was mistakenly replaced by a previously unreleased version of the album track.
*†† – Track 15, although labeled as &quot;We Are Broken&quot;, it was intended to be the version found as the B-side to &quot;Pale Shelter&quot;, however it was accidentally replaced with the audio track of &quot;Broken Revisited&quot; which is a slightly extended version of the original track and was first included as a bonus track on the limited edition cassette of &quot;Songs from the Big Chair&quot; in 1985 and later included on the 1999 remastered edition and 2006 deluxe edition of the same album.

===40th anniversary editions (2023)===
For the 40th anniversary of &quot;The Hurting&quot;, two editions were released, both featuring a new remaster of the original album by Miles Showell. One is a half-speed vinyl edition, the other a Blu-Ray Audio disc in Paul Sinclair&#x27;s SDE Surround Series, featuring the album in several formats (the aforementioned remaster; new stereo, 5.1 surround and Dolby Atmos remixes by Steven Wilson and an instrumental mix of the entire album) plus two newly discovered recordings from the aborted sessions with Mike Howlett: early versions of &quot;Mad World&quot; and &quot;Watch Me Bleed&quot;.

There had been a previous Blu-Ray Audio disc in the High Fidelity Pure Audio series released in 2014, but this disc didn&#x27;t feature any audio aside from a high resolution stereo remaster.

<doc id="1270475" wikidata="Q5556435" url="?curid=1270475" title="Graffiti 2">
<text>&quot;Graffiti 2 Powered by Jot&quot; was introduced in 2003 as a revised version of the original Palm OS handwriting system Graffiti. In January 2003, PalmSource announced the change explaining that Graffiti 2 was based on &quot;Jot&quot; by Communication Intelligence Corporation (CIC) and would replace the original version of Graffiti. Graffiti 2 made its debut in Palm OS 4.1.2 for Motorola DragonBall-based handhelds and in Palm OS Garnet 5.2 for ARM-based ones.

== History ==

The primary reason for the change was the fact that in April 1997 Xerox had sued PalmSource, Inc. over its use of Graffiti. After a legal fight lasting a number of years, and despite the dismissal of the case by a federal judge, Xerox won a reversal late in 2001 in the U.S. Court of Appeals.

As part of their press for the new handwriting recognition system, PalmSource said that Jot and Graffiti 2 more closely followed the standard ways of drawing letters and numbers than the original Graffiti did; they also said that lowering the learning curve would attract more new users to the platform. The change, on the other hand, alienated many long-time Palm users who were already happy with the previous version of Graffiti which they claimed was much easier to use (though perhaps not to learn).

A prominent issue cited by detractors is the number of stylus strokes required to draw a character. The original Graffiti recognition software required only a single stylus stroke for each alphanumeric character. Graffiti 2, however, required two strokes to draw some commonly used characters. This was perceived as extra work because the default settings for &quot;i&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, the fifth and second most frequently-used letters in English, required two strokes. Preferences settings allowed switching variants for letters P, T, Y and $, but none of them could be switched back to single stroke.

<doc id="1270480" wikidata="Q521475" url="?curid=1270480" title="Schönefeld">
<text>Schönefeld (, meaning &quot;beautiful field&quot;) is a suburban municipality in the Dahme-Spreewald district, Brandenburg, Germany. It borders the southeastern districts of Berlin. The municipal area encompasses the old Berlin Schönefeld Airport (SXF) and the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER).

==Geography==
It is located about southeast of the Berlin city centre, next to Berlin&#x27;s only airport, Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER).

In the north, Schönefeld adjoins to the Berlin boroughs of Tempelhof-Schöneberg, Neukölln, and Treptow-Köpenick with the localities of Lichtenrade, Gropiusstadt, Buckow, Rudow, Altglienicke, and Bohnsdorf. In the south, it borders Mittenwalde, in the west, Blankenfelde-Mahlow and in the east, Schulzendorf and Zeuthen.

===Civil parishes===
The Schönefeld municipal area comprises six districts (&quot;Ortsteile&quot;), former municipalities in their own right which were incorporated in 2003:
*Schönefeld proper
*Großziethen
*Selchow
*Kiekebusch
*Waltersdorf
*Waßmannsdorf

The settlement of Kienberg, part of Waltersdorf, was cleared of residents to permit expansion of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport and is to be developed as a commercial area.

==History and monuments==
The first preserved mention of Schönefeld in the Mittelmark territory dates back to 1242. &quot;Sconenfelde&quot;, then a possession held by the Lords of Selchow, is documented in the 1375 &quot;Landbuch&quot; (domesday book) of Emperor Charles IV, when he also ruled as Elector of Brandenburg. The village church, rebuilt in 1904/05 according to plans designed by Franz Heinrich Schwechten, includes a large Baroque altar. Waltersdorf and Waßmannsdorf also have village churches dating to the first half of the 13th century.

From 1933 onwards the Henschel aircraft company moved from Johannisthal Air Field to Schönefeld and had three runways laid out next to the village. More than 14,000 warplanes were built at the site until 1945, when the premises were occupied by the Red Army. In the Großziethen cemetery is a memorial to 200 prisoners of war and forced laborers who died during World War II. The Soviet Air Forces used the air field from 1946, one year later the Soviet Military Administration ordered the buildup of a civil air service supplying East Berlin.

Before German reunification, Schönefeld shared its borders partly with boroughs of former West Berlin (present-day Neukölln and Tempelhof-Schöneberg), and so from 1961 to 1990 it was separated from it by the Berlin Wall.

== Demography ==


==Economy and infrastructure==

===Transport===

*Berlin Brandenburg Airport
*Schönefeld (bei Berlin) station, opened in 1951 on the Berlin outer ring, is currently served by the Berlin S-Bahn lines S45 and S9
*Berlin Brandenburg Airport railway station beneath the airport Terminal 1 served by S-Bahn, Regional Express &quot;Airport Express&quot; and long distance IC trains, and an S-Bahn station at Waßmannsdorf, between there and the existing Schönefeld station served only by the S-Bahn.
* The Schönefled interchange connects the autobahns A13, A113 with its A117 branch-off, and A10 (&quot;Berliner Ring&quot;).
* Bundesstraßen B96A and B179

===Business===
The Airport-Center, an industrial area in Waltersdorf, and Berlin Brandenburg Airport are important sources of revenue for Schönefeld.

The head office of Private Wings is located in the General Aviation Terminal (Allgemeine Luftfahrt) on the property of Schönefeld Airport. Before its disestablishment, the East German airline company Interflug had its head office on the grounds of the airport. Bremenfly also had its head office in Schönefeld.

<doc id="1270497" wikidata="Q1344824" url="?curid=1270497" title="Freedom of movement">
<text>Freedom of movement, mobility rights, or the right to travel is a human rights concept encompassing the right of individuals to travel from place to place within the territory of a country, and to leave the country and return to it. The right includes not only visiting places, but changing the place where the individual resides or works.

Such a right is provided in the constitutions of numerous states, and in documents reflecting norms of international law. For example, Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts that:
* &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state.&quot;
* &quot;Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.&quot;

Some people and organizations advocate an extension of the freedom of movement to include a freedom of movement – or migration – between the countries as well as within the countries. The freedom of movement is restricted in a variety of ways by various governments and may even vary within the territory of a single country. Such restrictions are generally based on public health, order, or safety justifications and postulate that the right to these conditions preempts the notion of freedom of movement.

==Common restrictions==
Restrictions on international travel on people (immigration or emigration) are commonplace. Within countries, freedom of travel is often more limited for minors, and penal law can modify this right as it applies to persons charged with or convicted of crimes (for example, parole, probation, registration). In some countries, freedom of movement has historically been limited for women, and for members of disfavored racial and social groups. Circumstances, both legal and practical, may operate to limit this freedom. For example, a nation that is generally permissive with respect to travel may restrict that right during time of war.

Restrictions may include the following:

* national and regional official minimum wage tariff barriers to labour-market entry (free movement or migration of workers);
* official identity cards (internal passports, citizenship licenses) that must be carried and produced on demand;
* obligations on persons to register changes of address or of partner with the state authorities;
* protectionist local/regional barriers to housebuilding and therefore settlement in particular districts;
* trespassing into another individual&#x27;s property.
* motor vehicle normative road and highway design, in which pedestrian and bicycle access is severely restricted or absent

===Freedom of movement between private properties===
In some jurisdictions, questions have arisen as to the extent to which a private owner of land can exclude certain persons from land which is used for public purposes, such as a shopping mall or a park. There is also a rule of law that a landowner whose property has no public access can be awarded an easement to cross private land if necessary to reach his own property. Conversely, public nuisance laws prevent alternate use of public streets designated for public transit from being used for block parties and playing basketball.

Parents or other legal guardians are typically able to restrict the movements of minor children under their care, and of other adults who have been legally deemed incompetent to govern their own movement. Employers may legally set some restrictions on the movements of employees, and terminate employment if those restrictions are breached.

===Domestic restrictions===
Governments may generally sharply restrict the freedom of movement of persons who have been convicted of crimes, most conspicuously in the context of imprisonment. Restrictions may also be placed on convicted criminals who are on probation or have been released on parole. Persons who have been charged with crimes and have been released on bail may also be prohibited from traveling. A material witness may also be denied the right to travel.

Though travelling to and from countries is generally permitted (with some limitations), most governments restrict the length of time that temporary visitors may stay in the country. This can be dependent on country of citizenship and country travelled to among other factors. In some instances (such as those of refugees who are at risk of immediate bodily harm on return to their country or those seeking asylum), indefinite stay may be allowed on humanitarian grounds, but in most other cases, stay is generally limited. One notable exception to this is the free movement of people in the European Union, where citizens of any country in the EU and EFTA generally enjoy indefinite stay in other EU/EFTA countries.

Furthermore, restrictions on the right to relocate or live in certain areas of a country have been imposed in several countries, most prominently China.

In a child custody dispute, a court may place restrictions on the movement of a minor child, thereby restricting the ability of the parents of that child to travel with their child.

===Entrance restrictions in certain countries===
The Visa Restrictions Index ranks countries based on the number of other countries its citizens are free to enter without visa. Most countries in the world require visas or some other form of entrance permit for non-citizens to enter their territory. Those who enter countries in defiance of regulations requiring such documentation are often subject to imprisonment or deportation.

===Exit restrictions in certain countries===
Most countries require that their citizens leave the country on a valid passport, travel document issued by an international organization or, in some cases, identification document. Conditions of issuance and the governments&#x27; authority to deny issuance of a passport vary from country to country.

Under certain circumstances, countries may issue travel documents (such as laissez-passer) to aliens, that is, to persons other than their own citizens.

Having a passport issued does not guarantee the right to exit the country. A person may be prohibited to exit a country on a number of reasons, such as being under investigation as a suspect, serving a criminal sentence, being a debtor in default, or posing a threat to national security. This applies to aliens as well.

In some countries prohibition to leave may take the form of revocation of a previously issued passport. For example, the United States of America may revoke passports at will.

Some countries, such as the former Soviet Union, further required that their citizens, and sometimes foreign travelers, obtain an exit visa to be allowed to leave the country.

Currently, some countries require that foreign citizens have valid visas upon leaving the country if they needed one to enter. For example, a person who overstayed a visa in Czech Republic may need to obtain an exit visa. In Russia, the inconvenience goes even further as the legislation there does not formally recognize residency permits as valid visas; thus, foreign citizens lawfully residing in Russia need to obtain &quot;exit-entry&quot; visas in order to do a trip abroad. This, in particular, affects foreign students, whose original entry visas expire by the time they return home.

Citizens of the People&#x27;s Republic of China who are residents of the mainland are required to apply for exit and entry endorsements in order to enter the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau (and SAR residents require a Home Return Permit to visit the mainland). Since 2016, residents of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region have been required to deposit their passports with the police. Each trip abroad must be approved by the government, which is more difficult for members of the Uyghur ethnic group.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar require all resident foreigners, but not citizens, to obtain an exit visa before leaving the country.

==History==

=== Europe ===
When Augustus established the Roman Empire in 27 BC, he assumed monarchical powers over the new Roman province of Egypt and was able to prohibit senators from traveling there without his permission. However, Augustus would also allow more liberty to travel at times. During a famine in 6 AD, he attempted to relieve strain on the food supply by granting senators the liberty to leave Rome and to travel to wherever they wished.

In England, in 1215, the right to travel was enshrined in Article 42 of the Magna Carta:

:It shall be lawful to any person, for the future, to go out of our kingdom, and to return, safely and securely, by land or by water, saving his allegiance to us, unless it be in time of war, for some short space, for the common good of the kingdom: excepting prisoners and outlaws, according to the laws of the land, and of the people of the nation at war against us, and Merchants who shall be treated as it is said above.

In the Holy Roman Empire, a measure instituted by Joseph II in 1781 permitted serfs freedom of movement.

The serfs of the Russian Empire were not given their personal freedom until Alexander II&#x27;s Edict of Emancipation of 1861. At the time, most of the inhabitants of Russia, not only the serfs but also townsmen and merchants, did not have freedom of movement and were confined to their places of residence.

=== United Nations Declaration ===
After the end of hostilities in World War II, the United Nations was established on 24 October 1945. The new international organization recognized the importance of freedom of movement through documents such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966). Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, reads,
:(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State.
:(2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.

Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights incorporates this right into treaty law:

:(1) Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.
:(2) Everyone shall be free to leave any country, including his own.
:(3) The above-mentioned rights shall not be subject to any restrictions except those provided by law, are necessary to protect national security, public order, public health or morals or the rights and freedoms of others, and are consistent with the other rights recognized in the present Covenant.
:(4) No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country.

The ICCPR entered into force for the initial ratifying states on 23 March 1976, and for additional states following their ratification. In 1999, the U.N. Human Rights Committee, which is charged with interpreting the treaty, issued its guidelines for Article 12 of the ICCPR in its &quot;General Comment No. 27: Freedom of Movement&quot;.

While the treaty sets out the freedom of movement in broad and absolute terms, part four of Article 12 of the ICCPR admits that these freedoms may be restricted for a variety of reasons in the public interest. This clause is often cited to justify a wide variety of movement restrictions by almost every country that is party to it.

=== COVID-19 ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions on freedom of movement were implemented by many of the world&#x27;s governments.

==Examples of free movement arrangements between countries==

=== Commonwealth of Independent States ===

The countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States have concluded a number of agreements among themselves in the field of citizens&#x27; mobility rights, which regulate visa-free travel, recognition of documents, cooperation in the field of employment and the common labor market. Usually a travel passport is required for abroad visits, unless there are other agreements that a national identity document or internal passport is valid (a common market is a lesser degree of integration than a single market and separate agreements are more restrictive than the provisions of a single market).

The Eurasian Economic Union overlaps with the Commonwealth of Independent States.

=== Eurasian Economic Union ===

The single market has provided for the free movement of labor without work permits for the worker and his or her family members since 2012, including access to health care and recognition of educational credentials. The national identity document or internal passport is valid within the Union (a single market is a deeper degree of integration than a common market).

The Commonwealth of Independent States overlaps with the Eurasian Economic Union.

=== European Union ===
Within the European Union, residents are guaranteed the right to freely move within the EU&#x27;s internal borders by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004. Union residents are given the right to enter any member state for up to three months with a valid passport or national identity card, and over three months with evidence of &quot;sufficient resources... not to become a burden on the social assistance system&quot;. If the citizen does not have a travel document, the member state must afford them every facility in obtaining the documents. Under no circumstances can an entry or exit visa be required. There are some security limitations and public policy restrictions on extended stays by EU residents. For instance, a member state may require that persons register their presence in the country &quot;within a reasonable and non-discriminatory period of time&quot;. In general, however, the burden of notification and justification lies with the state. EU citizens also earn a right to permanent residence in member states they have maintained an uninterrupted five-year period of legal residence. This residency cannot be subject to any conditions, and is lost only by two successive years absence from the host nation. Family members of EU residents, in general, also acquire the same freedom of travel rights as the resident they accompany, though they may be subject to a short-stay visa requirement. Furthermore, no EU citizen may be declared permanently &quot;persona non grata&quot; within the European Union, or permanently excluded from entry by any member state.

==== Workers ====

Freedom of movement for workers is a policy chapter of the &quot;acquis communautaire&quot; of the European Union. It is part of the free movement of persons and one of the four economic freedoms: free movement of goods, services, labour and capital. Article 45 TFEU (ex 39 and 48) states that:

# Freedom of movement for workers shall be secured within the Community.
# Such freedom of movement shall entail the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality between workers of the Member States as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment.
# It shall entail the right, subject to limitations justified on grounds of public policy, public security or public health:
#: (a) to accept offers of employment actually made;
#: (b) to move freely within the territory of Member States for this purpose;
#: (c) to stay in a Member State for the purpose of employment in accordance with the provisions governing the employment of nationals of that State laid down by law, regulation or administrative action;
#: (d) to remain in the territory of a Member State after having been employed in that State, subject to conditions which shall be embodied in implementing regulations to be drawn up by the Commission.
# The provisions of this article shall not apply to employment in the public service.

===Schengen Area===

A different arrangement amongst 29 European countries, covers some but not all European Union member states together with some non-member states. The arrangement allows visa-free travel between the countries in this area, in general without border controls. A foreign national who holds a visa issued by any of these countries can travel freely within the area.

===Nordic Passport Union===

The Nordic Passport Union allows citizens of the Nordic countries – Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland – to travel and reside in another Nordic country without any travel documentation (e.g. a passport or national identity card) or a residence permit. Since 25 March 2001, all five states are also in the Schengen Area.

=== Mercosur ===
The Mercosur alliance between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay includes a freedom of movement area between its member states and five other associate states. Citizens don&#x27;t require a passport to travel through other Mercosur or associate countries. Freedom of movement also extends to certain associated countries (Chile, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), citizens of which can also travel to their territories without the need of a passport.

=== Central America ===

The Central America-4 Border Control Agreement abolished in 2006 land border checks among El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. The countries have adopted a harmonized external border and visitor policy.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===
The Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement between Australia and New Zealand allows citizens of each country to move between, and work within, the two countries with few limitations. The arrangement also extends to holders of permanent resident and resident return visas of Australia.

=== United Kingdom, Ireland, Isle of Man and Channel Islands ===
The Common Travel Area arrangements allow citizens of the United Kingdom and Ireland, and other British nationals resident in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands, to travel freely in this area. The arrangements also extend to certain foreign nationals who hold visas issued by these countries.

=== Gulf Cooperation Council ===
Saudi, Omani, Kuwaiti, Bahraini, Qatari, Emirati - Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) citizens do not need a visa to enter each other&#x27;s countries and they also have the right to work in each GCC country. GCC citizens can use a GCC national identity card (rather than a passport) to travel between these states.

=== Union State of Russia and Belarus ===

Freedom of movement between Russia and Belarus for local citizens exists similar to that which exists for British and Irish citizens within the Common Travel Area.

=== United States, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, and Palau ===

Citizens of the FSM, Marshall Islands, Palau, and the United States may enter, reside, study and work in each respective country indefinitely without a visa.

=== The Caribbean ===
Citizens of certain countries in the Caribbean (Antigua and Barbuda, Commonwealth of Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines) may enter, reside, study and work in each respective country indefinitely without a visa.

==Protection of right to freedom of movement in specific countries==
=== Asia ===

==== Burma/Myanmar ====
The military regime in Burma has been criticized for allegations of restrictions to freedom of movement. These include restrictions on movement by political dissidents, women, and migrant workers.

==== China (mainland) ====

In the mainland of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the hukou system of household registration makes internal migration difficult, especially for rural residents to move to urban areas. Many people move to places in which they do not have a local &quot;hukou&quot;, but local governments can restrict services like subsidized schooling, subsidized housing, and health insurance to those with local &quot;hukou&quot;. The system was used as far back as the Han dynasty for tax collection, and more recently in the People&#x27;s Republic to control urbanization. The Hukou system has also led many municipal governments to disregard the welfare of migrant workers as measures of wellbeing and economic progress are based almost exclusively on conditions for those with a local &quot;hukou.&quot;

Also, Chinese citizens are allowed to go from the mainland to Hong Kong or Macau only for travel, but not for residence unless they obtain the &quot;one-way permit&quot; from Chinese authorities. Currently, the issuance of the &quot;one-way permit&quot; is limited to 150 per day.

The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy claimed in 2000 that people in Tibet had to promise not to criticize the Chinese Communist Party before receiving official permission to leave for India or Nepal. Additionally, it alleged that people of Han descent in Tibet have a far easier time acquiring the necessary permits to live in urban areas than ethnic Tibetans do.

==== Hong Kong and Macau ====
As a part of the one country, two systems policy proposed by Deng Xiaoping and accepted by the British and Portuguese governments, the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau retained separate border control and immigration policies with mainland China. Chinese nationals had to gain permission from the government before travelling to Hong Kong or Macau, but this requirement was officially abolished for each SAR after its respective handover. Since then, restrictions imposed by the SAR governments have been the limiting factor on travel.

Under Basic Law of Hong Kong article 31, &quot;Hong Kong residents shall have freedom of movement within the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and freedom of immigration to other countries and regions. They shall have freedom to travel and to enter or leave the Region. Unless restrained by law, holders of valid travel documents shall be free to leave the Region without special authorization.&quot;

==== India ====
* Freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India though reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interest of the general public, for example, restrictions may be imposed on movement and travelling, so as to control epidemics.
* Freedom to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India, which is subject to reasonable restrictions by the State in the interest of the general public, or for protection of the scheduled tribes because certain safeguards, as are envisaged here, seem justified to protect indigenous and tribal peoples from exploitation and coercion.

====Israel====

Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, which has quasi-constitutional status, declares that &quot;there shall be no deprivation or restriction of the liberty of a person by imprisonment, arrest, extradition or otherwise&quot;; that &quot;all persons are free to leave Israel&quot;; and that &quot;every Israeli national has the right of entry into Israel from abroad&quot;. In practice, stay of exit orders are liberally issued by Israel courts, including on non-custodial fathers who are not in arrears in child support. In March 2012 a corruption scandal led to the arrest of two officials for allegedly having taken bribes to circumvent court ordered &quot;no exit&quot; travel abroad bans. Freedoms of movement within the West Bank and Gaza is not similarly protected and has been a source of controversy.

==== Japan ====
The Constitution provides for the freedom of movement within the country, foreign travel, immigration, and repatriation, and the Government generally respects them in practice. Citizens have the right to travel freely both within the country and abroad, to change their place of residence, to emigrate, and to repatriate voluntarily. Citizenship may be forfeited by naturalization in a foreign country or by failure of persons born with dual nationality to elect citizenship at the required age. The law does not permit forced exile, and it is not used.

==== Kuwait ====
Kuwait refuses admission to holders of Israeli passports as part of its boycott against Israel. In 2015 Kuwait Airways cancelled its route between New York and London following a decision by the U.S. Department of Transportation that the airline had engaged in discrimination by refusing to sell tickets to Israeli citizens. Direct flights between the US and Kuwait are not affected by this decision as Israeli citizens are not allowed to enter Kuwait.

==== North Korea ====
Travel to North Korea is tightly controlled. The standard route to and from North Korea is by plane or train via Beijing. Transport directly to and from South Korea was possible on a limited scale from 2003 until 2008, when a road was opened (bus tours, no private cars). Freedom of Movement within North Korea is also limited, as citizens are not allowed to move around freely inside their country.

==== Syria ====
Syrian citizens are prohibited from exiting the country without special visas issued by government authorities.

The Syrian Constitution states &quot;Every citizen has the right to liberty of movement within the territory of the State unless prohibited therefrom under the terms of a court order or public health and safety regulations.&quot;. In its mandated report on human rights to the United Nations, Syria has argued that because of this constitutional protection: &quot;in Syria, no laws or measures restrict the liberty of movement or choice of residence of citizens&quot;. Legislative Decree No. 29 of 1970 regulates the right of foreigners to enter, reside in and leave the territory of Syria, and is the controlling document regarding the issuance of passports, visas, and diplomatic travel status. The document specifically states &quot;The latter provision is intended merely to ensure that our country is not the final destination of stateless persons.&quot;

However, Syria has been criticized by groups, including Amnesty International for restrictions to freedom of movement. In August 2005, Amnesty International released an &quot;appeal case&quot;, citing several freedom of movement restrictions including exit restriction without explanation, refusal to issue passports to political dissidents, detention, restriction from entering certain structures, denial of travel documents, and denial of nationality. The United Nations Human Rights Committee issues regular reports on human rights in Syria, including freedom of movement.

There are certain restrictions on movement placed on Women, for example Syrian law now allows males to place restrictions on certain female relatives. Women over the age of 18 are entitled to travel outside of Syria, however a woman&#x27;s husband may file a request for his wife to be banned from leaving the country. From July 2013, in certain villages in Syria (such as Raqqa and Deir el-Zour), ISIS no longer allow women to appear in public alone, they must be accompanied by a male relative/guardian known as a &quot;mahram&quot;. People who tried to leave ISIS territory were routinely tortured and executed.

==== Palestine ====

The restriction of the movement of Israelis and Palestinians in Israel and the West Bank by Israel and the Palestinian National Authority is one issue in the Israel–Palestine conflict. In the mid-1990s, with the implementation of the Oslo Accords and the division of the West Bank into three separate administrative divisions, Israeli freedom of movement was limited by law. Israel says that the regime of restrictions is necessary to protect Israelis both in Israel proper and in the West Bank.

Checkpoints exist throughout and at entrances and exits to the West Bank that limit the movement of non-Israelis on the basis of nationality, age, and sex among other criteria. While many such checkpoints are static, many are random, or move around frequently. Full closures of the West Bank to any entrance or exit are frequent, generally taking place on Jewish Holidays.

Residents of Gaza are only allowed to travel to the West Bank in exceptional humanitarian cases, particularly urgent medical cases, but &quot;not&quot; including marriage. It is possible to travel from the West Bank to Gaza only if the person pledges to permanently relocating to Gaza. Gazan residents are only admitted to Israel in exceptional humanitarian cases. Since 2008, they are not allowed to live or stay in Israel because of marriage with an Israeli. Israelis who want to visit their partner in Gaza need permits for a few months, and Israelis can visit their first‐degree relatives in Gaza only in exceptional humanitarian cases.

=== Africa ===
Freedom of movement laws and restrictions vary from country to country on the African continent, however several international agreements beyond those prescribed by the United Nations govern freedom of movement within the African continent. The African Charter on Human and People&#x27;s Rights Article 12 outlines various forms of movement-related freedoms. It asserts:
# Every individual shall have the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of a State provided he abides by the law.
# Every individual shall have the right to leave any country including his own, and to return to his country. This right may only be subject to restrictions, provided for by law for the protection of national security, law and order, public health or morality. 
# Every individual shall have the right, when persecuted, to seek and obtain asylum in other countries in accordance with laws of those countries and international conventions.
# A non-national legally admitted in a territory of a State Party to the present Charter, may only be expelled from it by virtue of a decision taken in accordance with the law.
# The mass expulsion of non-nationals shall be prohibited. Mass expulsion shall be that which is aimed at national, racial, ethnic or religious groups.
The ideals of the Charter are, in principle, supported by all signatory governments, though they are not rigorously followed. There have been attempts to have intellectuals recognized as having special freedom of movement rights, to protect their intellectual ideals as they cross national boundaries.

==== South Africa ====
Under apartheid, freedom of movement for nonwhites was limited by pass laws beginning with the Natives (Urban Areas) Act 1923 requiring black men to have a pass with them to enter cities. After the National Party imposed apartheid in the 1950s, these laws were expanded to prohibit all non-whites from remaining in cities for longer than 72 hours. Beyond the African Charter on Human and People&#x27;s Rights, the Constitution of South Africa also contains express freedoms of movement, in section 21 of Chapter 2. Freedom of movement is guaranteed to &quot;everyone&quot; in regard to leaving the country but is limited to citizens when entering it or staying in it. Citizens also have a right to a passport, critical to full exercise of the freedom of movement internationally.

=== Europe ===
==== France ====
Many countries mention freedom of movement in their constitutional texts, but France does not. Freedom of movement in France is ruled both by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 and the Schengen Agreement of 1990, promoting freedom of movement and no more borders controls for European citizen on the European territory.

In theory, citizens in France are free to travel without any police control on the national territory. Although until the 1980s any person (either tourists or French citizens) had to fill up an information sheet then given to the police, writing on it its personal situation before booking a hotel room. This law does not exist anymore however.

Since the Schengen Agreement in 1990, freedom of movement slightly spread to 25 countries of the European Union (Cyprus is not a member yet; Ireland maintains an opt-out), and to Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as these countries own an associated status towards the EU. As European citizens, French people are free to go to one European country to another without restrictions.

France is one of the most welcomed countries in the world. Citizens are indeed able to travel to 186 destinations in the world, making France one of the most welcomed countries according to the Henley passport index.

==== Ireland ====
In Ireland, the Thirteenth Amendment was adopted in November 1992 by referendum in order to ensure freedom of movement in the specific circumstance of a woman traveling abroad to receive an abortion. However, with the successful repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Irish Constitution on 25 May 2018, which ensures the right to an abortion, this previous amendment is no longer necessary.

==== Italy ====
In Italy, freedom of movement is enshrined in Article 16 of the Constitution, which states:

&quot;Every citizen has the right to reside and travel freely in any part of the country, except for such general limitations as may be established by law for reasons of health or security. No restriction may be imposed for political reasons. Every citizen is free to leave the territory of the republic and return to it, notwithstanding any legal obligations.&quot;
==== Norway (Svalbard) ====
Uniquely, the Norwegian special territory of Svalbard is an entirely visa-free zone under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty.

==== Poland ====
Polish nationals holding dual citizenship are required to use Polish travel documents (a Polish passport or, within the European Union, a Polish National ID card (Dowód osobisty)) while travelling in the Schengen Area.

Poland requires all Polish citizens (including foreign citizens who are, who can be claimed to or are suspected to hold Polish citizenship) to enter and depart Poland using Polish travel documents.

==== Russia ====
Article 27 of The Russian Constitution states that &quot;1.Every who legally stays in the territory of the Russian Federation shall have the right to free travel, choice of place of stay or residence. 2.Everyone may freely leave the Russian Federation. Citizens of the Russian Federation shall have the right to freely return to the Russian Federation.&quot;

Freedom of movement of Russian citizens around the country is legally limited in a number of situations, including the following:
* In closed cities (mainly nuclear research centers). Special permits are necessary for both visiting and settling there.
* In certain areas near Russia&#x27;s international border.
* In areas with declared state of emergency.
* In the interests of justice (imprisonment, bailiff&#x27;s order, arrest, undertaking not to leave during a criminal investigation etc.).
* For citizens under military conscription.

Since the abandonment of propiska system in 1993, new legislation on registration of residence was passed. Unlike propiska, which was a permit to reside in a certain area, registration of residence as worded in the law is merely notification. According to the Russian legislation, there are two types of registration which a person may obtain simultaneously. Permanent registration is obligatory and gives the right for property ownership, temporary registration can be received for a period of time due to rental contract. However, administrative procedures developed &quot;in implementation&quot; of the registration law imposed some conditions on registration which effectively made it depend on the landlord&#x27;s assent. Since landlords are often not willing to register tenants or guests in their properties due to tax payments, many internal migrants are prevented from performing their legal duty to register. Before 2004, it was common for police to fine those having failed to register within 3 working days at a place of stay. In 2004, the maximum permitted registration lag was raised to 90 days making prosecution infeasible, removing practical obstacles to free movement.

The Russian citizens&#x27; right to leave Russia may be legally suspended on a number of reasons including:
* The case of obtaining access to classified documents while working for the state or the military, during the time when access is granted and up to 5 years afterwards. This limitation is commonly included as a provision in one&#x27;s contract of employment.
* Detention on being prosecuted as a defendant or suspicion of committing a crime.
* Military conscription.

According to the 62 article of the Russian Constitution, citizen of Russia may have the citizenship of a foreign State (dual citizenship), but that does not &quot;free him from the obligations stipulated by the Russian citizenship&quot;. Russian citizens possessing foreign citizenship may not enter or leave Russia on foreign travel documents. Russian consular offices do not grant visas to foreign passport holders who are (or are suspected to be) Russian citizens.

==== Serbia ====
Everyone has the right to move and settle freely in the Republic of Serbia, to leave it, and to return to it.

Freedom of movement and residence and the right to leave the Republic of Serbia may be restricted by the law if this is necessary for the conduct of criminal proceedings, protection of public order and peace, prevention of the spread of infectious diseases, or defense of the Republic of Serbia.

==== Turkey ====
According to Article 23 of the Turkish Constitution, each individual in the Republic of Turkey has the right to travel from one place to another.

The freedom of a citizen to travel abroad may be restricted due to his / her citizenship duty or criminal investigation or prosecution.

Citizens can neither be deported nor denied entry into the country.

==== United Kingdom ====
Britons have long enjoyed a comparatively high level of freedom of movement. Apart from Magna Carta, the protection of rights and liberties in this field has tended to come from the common law rather than formal constitutional codes and conventions, and can be changed by Parliament without the protection of being entrenched in a constitution.

It has been proposed that a range of specific state restrictions on freedom of movement should be prohibited under a new or comprehensively amended Human Rights Act. The new basic legal prohibitions could include: road tolls and other curbs on freedom of travel and private vehicle ownership and use; personal identity cards (internal passports, citizenship licenses) that must be produced on demand for individuals to access public services and facilities; and legal requirements for citizens to register changes of address or partner with the state authorities.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
The Constitution of Canada contains mobility rights expressly in section 6 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The rights specified include the right of citizens to leave and enter the country and the right of both citizens and permanent residents to move within its boundaries. However, the subsections protect poorer regions&#x27; affirmative action programs that favour residents who have lived in the region for longer. Section 6 mobility rights are among the select rights that cannot be limited by the Charter&#x27;s notwithstanding clause.

Canada&#x27;s Social Union Framework Agreement, an agreement between governments made in 1999, affirms that &quot;All governments believe that the freedom of movement of Canadians to pursue opportunities anywhere in Canada is an essential element of Canadian citizenship.&quot; In the Agreement, it is pledged that &quot;Governments will ensure that no new barriers to mobility are created in new social policy initiatives.&quot;

==== United States ====
Freedom of movement under United States law is governed primarily by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution which states, &quot;The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.&quot; As far back as the circuit court ruling in &quot;Corfield v. Coryell,&quot; 6 Fed. Cas. 546 (1823), freedom of movement has been judicially recognized as a fundamental Constitutional right. In &quot;Paul v. Virginia,&quot; 75 U.S. 168 (1869), the Court defined freedom of movement as &quot;right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them.&quot; However, the Supreme Court did not invest the federal government with the authority to protect freedom of movement. Under the &quot;privileges and immunities&quot; clause, this authority was given to the states, a position the Court held consistently through the years in cases such as &quot;Ward v. Maryland,&quot; 79 U.S. 418 (1871), the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases,&quot; 83 U.S. 36 (1873) and &quot;United States v. Harris,&quot; 106 U.S. 629 (1883).

Internationally, § 215 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (currently codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1185), it is unlawful for a United States citizen to enter or exit the United States without a valid United States passport.

The State Department refused to issue passports to citizens who declined to swear that they were not Communists. This practice was ended following the 1958 Supreme Court Case &quot;Kent v. Dulles&quot;.

===Oceania===

==== Australia ====
No federal Australian legislation guarantees freedom of movement within the Commonwealth of Australia. Various Australian laws restrict the right on various grounds. Until 1 July 2016, Norfolk Island had immigration controls separate from those of the remainder of Australia and a permit was required for Australian citizens or residents to enter. In August 2014 the Australian Commonwealth Government proposed regulating the rights of Australian citizens to travel to and from designated areas associated with terrorism.

=== Central America ===

==== Saint Martin ====
In the island of Saint Martin, divided between Sint Maarten (part of the Netherlands) and the Collectivity of Saint Martin (part of France), freedom of movement is allowed between both halves of the island as stated in the 1648 Treaty of Concordia. It is possible that this may have influenced the development of a common identity in the island, which has led to a proposed unification of it.

<text>The Band of the 10th of December was a secret Bonapartist society organized mainly from among lumpen proletariat, opportunists, and military leaders. The society helped progress Napoleon III&#x27;s election as president of the Republic of France on December 10, 1848.

It is also known as &quot;Society of December 10&quot; and it is analyzed in great detail by Karl Marx in his essay The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon.

<text>The Artillery Brigade () was a Finnish Army unit stationed in Niinisalo in western Finland. The Artillery Brigade trained conscripts and regular personnel for wartime artillery duties. In addition, it provided weather service in the Niinisalo region, and trained most of the Finnish Defence Forces&#x27; dogs. The total strength of the brigade was some 800 conscripts and 400 regular civilian and military personnel. On 1 January 2015, it was merged with the Pori Brigade.

The Artillery Brigade consisted (in 2001–2013) of the Satakunta Artillery Regiment, the Reconnaissance Battalion, the Artillery School, and the Satakunta Military Band. Every year, some 1,600 conscripts were trained by the brigade. The Satakunta Artillery Regiment fielded two cannon batteries, with equipment ranging from 122 mm light howitzers to 155 mm cannons and a support battery consisting entirely out of signals personnel and spotters. The regiment continues as a part of the Pori Brigade.

The Reconnaissance Battalion fielded a heavy rocket launcher battery, a UAV battery, a headquarters battery as well as a UAV reconnaissance battery. The conscripts participated in several live-fire exercises in the nearby firing range at Pohjankangas, before the two- or three-week-long national live-fire artillery exercise held once a year in Rovajärvi firing range in Lapland. In 2013, as a preliminary of the merger with the Pori Brigade, the 3rd Infantry Company was established as a part of the Reconnaissance Battalion. In 2015, the Reconnaissance Battalion was disbanded and its functions divided between Finland Proper Logistics Battalion, Satakunta Artillery Regiment and Ostrobothnia Jaeger Battalion.

The Artillery School, which was a part of the Artillery Brigade, provided university-level education for future artillery officers and continuing education for artillery regular personnel. The same function continues, but the School is now part of the Army Academy.

<text>Geissler is a small lunar impact crater that lies on the northern floor of the much larger walled plain Gilbert, near the eastern limb of the Moon. Just to the northeast of this crater, attached to the outer rim of Gilbert, is the crater pair of Weierstrass and Van Vleck.

The rim of Geissler is nearly circular, with a slight outward bulge toward the northwest. The rim is sharp-edged and not notably worn. The inner walls are simple slopes that run down gradually to the small interior floor, which has a diameter about one third that of the crater. This formation is not significantly eroded, and is otherwise undistinguished.

This crater was formerly designated Gilbert D before being assigned a unique name by the IAU in 1976.

<text>Illinois Central 121 (IC #121) was a diesel streamliner built in 1936 by Pullman-Standard and powered by Electro-Motive Corporation, which was used by the Illinois Central Railroad on the &quot;Green Diamond&quot;. Its fixed five-car consist was also the end of an era; the popularity of the early streamliners was their undoing, because the trains could not be lengthened or shortened to handle varying loads. It was the last streamliner built with the power car articulated with the train; future streamliners featured a matched but separable locomotive. The train was painted in a two-tone green livery, &quot;Cypress Green&quot; on the nose and below the window sills with &quot;Cedar Green&quot; above, separated by an aluminum strip. Extensive aluminum trim was applied.

==Consist==
The train&#x27;s fixed consist was:

* Car 121: Power car including driving cab, Winton 201-A 16-cylinder engine and generator, auxiliary generator, and train heating boiler. Below the floor, the first truck was powered, but the second, articulated with the second car, was not. A fuel tank was also mounted between the trucks.
* Car 122: Storage, Baggage and Mail car of which approximately half was the mail compartment.
* Car 123: Coach including conductor&#x27;s office, seating 56.
* Car 124: Coach including restrooms, seating 60.
* Car 125: Diner-Lounge-Observation including restrooms, kitchen, dining area seating 8, and observation lounge seating 20.

All passenger-carrying cars were air-conditioned, with radio communication between them. Full width rubber diaphragms joined the cars, and all cars were articulated (sharing a truck with the neighboring car).

== Operation ==

IC 121 operated the &quot;Green Diamond&quot; service between 1936–1947. The &quot;Green Diamond&quot; began each morning with an 8:55 departure as Train 50 from St. Louis Union Station, arriving at IC&#x27;s Central Station in Chicago at 1:50 . The train was then turned and serviced, for a 5:00 return as Train 51, arriving back in St. Louis by 9:55 . Seven stops were made en route, and the train ran to a 4-hour 55 minute schedule, being by far the fastest of IC&#x27;s three trains on that route. Wartime in 1943 added an extra 15 minutes to the schedule to cope with traffic congestion, but the train was otherwise unchanged.

On September 29, 1946, with the full dieselization of all Chicago-St.Louis passenger service, the &quot;Green Diamond&quot; was changed to train Nos. 20 and 21, the reservation requirement was dropped, and the timetable no longer referred to the train as a distinct trainset. Unsurprisingly, the trainset was withdrawn from service on February 28, 1947, being replaced by a new &quot;Green Diamond&quot;, an E-unit-hauled streamliner with regular lightweight cars.

The trainset was shipped to the ICRR&#x27;s shops at Paducah, Kentucky, for a complete overhaul, which took two months. The train emerged still in two-tone green, but with the &quot;Green Diamond&quot; names completely removed. It re-entered service on April 27, 1947, as the &quot;Miss-Lou&quot; (MISSissippi-LOUisiana) between Jackson, Mississippi, and New Orleans, Louisiana, operating as Trains 27 and 28. It left Jackson at 6:20 , arriving in New Orleans at 10:20 ; the return journey left at 6:20 and arrived in Jackson at 10:20 .

The trainset was finally retired on August 8, 1950, and sold for scrap.

<text>Gardner is a small lunar impact crater in the northeast part of the Moon. It was named after an American physicist Irvine Clifton Gardner in 1976. It lies due east of the crater Vitruvius, in a section of rough terrain north of the Mare Tranquillitatis. Gardner was previously designated Vitruvius A before being given its present name by the IAU. To the northeast of Gardner is the larger crater Maraldi.

It is a circular crater with sloping inner walls and an interior floor that occupies about half the total crater diameter. The southern half of the floor has a slight rise before reaching the inner wall. The crater is not significantly eroded, and the outer rim is relatively sharp and well-defined. The most distinctive feature is a row of four rounded hills along the northern floor of the crater.

To the south is an elevated area unofficially known as the &quot;Gardner Megadome&quot;. In the vicinity of the dome are satellite craters including Vitruvius B, H, and T, and Maraldi D.

<text>Galen is a small lunar impact crater that lies in the rugged region between the Montes Apenninus range to the west and the Montes Haemus in the east. It is located to the south-southeast of the crater Aratus, a slightly larger formation. Further to the west is the crater Conon, near the flanks of the Montes Apeninnus. Galen was previously designated Aratus A before being given a name by the IAU.

Galen is a circular crater with a bowl-shaped interior and a sharp rim that has not undergone significant erosion. The small interior floor has a lower albedo than the surrounding walls.

The crater is named after ancient Greek doctor Claudius Galen.

<text>Lola Aylings, was a manufacturer of rowing boats. It was formed in early 2001 when Lola Group (a racing car/composite engineering company) purchased Aylings (an existing boat manufacturer) and was based in Huntingdon, United Kingdom.

Aylings was founded in 1859, originally making rowing oars. It began producing boats in the 1980s (after buying Carbocraft) and kayaks in 1998 (after buying Kobra Kayaks)

The company moved from Weybridge to Huntingdon in 2003. It ceased production in 2007.

<doc id="1270545" wikidata="Q7105899" url="?curid=1270545" title="Oscar Browning">
<text>Oscar Browning (17 January 1837 – 6 October 1923) was a British educationalist, historian and &quot;bon viveur&quot;, a well-known Cambridge personality during the late Victorian and Edwardian eras. An innovator in the early development of professional training for teachers, he served as principal of the Cambridge University Day Training College (CUDTC) from 1891 to 1909. He was also a prolific author of popular histories and other books.

The son of a prosperous distiller, Browning was educated at Eton, and then King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. On graduating in 1860 he returned to Eton as an assistant master. A vociferous and active opponent of the school&#x27;s traditional curriculum and teaching methods, he introduced novel and progressive techniques to the classroom, to the general approval of his pupils but to the dismay of the Eton authorities. He was controversially dismissed from his post in 1875, ostensibly because of repeated disregard for school rules, but an underlying issue was disquiet arising from his lifestyle, particularly his close and affectionate relationships with boys under his care.

Browning returned to King&#x27;s, where he continued his individualistic approach to teaching, and rapidly established himself as a leading Cambridge personality. Again, his methods were far more popular with his students than with his colleagues. An avid social climber and self-promotionist, he cultivated a range of acquaintances in the social and political worlds – he stood unsuccessfully three times for Parliament – and published a number of books on English, European and world history. He also wrote on educational theory and produced a well-regarded biography of the writer George Eliot. Despite this output, he failed to gain scholastic recognition and was repeatedly overlooked for higher college posts and academic honours. However, his pioneering work in teacher education, particularly through his leadership of the CUDTC, was later recognised as a formative factor in the development of the university&#x27;s present-day Department of Education.

After his retirement in 1909 Browning moved to Rome and remained active as a writer until his death in 1923. Among his late works were two volumes of autobiography and further historical works, including a history of Italy. At the end of his life, having earlier been denied a knighthood, he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his services to education.

==Life==
===Childhood===

Oscar Browning was born on 17 January 1837, at No. 8 Cumberland Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London. His parents were William Shipton Browning, a prosperous distiller, and Mariana Margaret, née Bridge, the daughter of a sea captain. He was the fourth child, and two more daughters followed. Oscar was born prematurely, the survivor of twins the elder of who died stillborn; Oscar escaped the same fate only through the diligence and determination of a nurse.

While Oscar was still in his infancy the family moved to Windsor in Berkshire, where according to his own account Browning grew up in a succession of houses. One of these was close to the Long Walk, where &quot;Queen [Victoria] passed our windows in her almost daily ride&quot;. Browning&#x27;s early education was conducted in various schools and by tutors. Having failed to gain entrance to Eton College as a &quot;lower boy&quot; – on several occasions according to his own account – Browning was sent in 1848 to live with his elder brother William, by then curate of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Everdon, near Daventry, to prepare for the entrance examinations that would admit him to Eton as a Scholar. He passed in the summer of 1850, and took up his place the following January as a &quot;Colleger&quot;, just before his fourteenth birthday.

===Eton and Cambridge===
Browning was initially shocked by life at Eton, which his biographer Ian Anstruther describes at that time as &quot;a rough world of its own in which the weaker boys were helpless, and where the delights and depravities of vice were imposed on the youngest without restraint&quot;. In 1853 Browning began a journal, in which his descriptions of daily life suggest, say Pam Hirst and Mark McBeth in their account of Browning&#x27;s life, that Eton, &quot;[r]ather than a royally-endowed school [was] more like a Dickensian orphanage&quot;. Although his first Eton years were unhappy, his work pleased his tutor, William Johnson, who wrote of him: &quot;Oscar reads like a student of literature ... at last I have found a genuine student combining taste with knowledge, aesthetics with grammar, sociability with thoughtfulness&quot;. Johnson&#x27;s approach to education and teaching influenced Browning for the rest of his life.
Although not generally popular, Browning secured election to the exclusive Eton Society, known as &quot;Pop&quot;. He also won a contest to write and deliver a suitable oration when Albert, the Prince Consort, visited Eton on Founder&#x27;s Day in 1854. As Browning matured and his interests widened, his formal schoolwork suffered, to Johnson&#x27;s distress, but the scope and extent of his reading is evidenced by a list of his books, included in his journal in November 1854: Byron and Edward Gibbon are accompanied by works from Addison, Sydney Smith, Thomas Arnold, and many more writers, classic and contemporary. Summers were often spent in Brussels, where his mother and younger sisters had moved following his father&#x27;s death in 1853. On one occasion Browning contrived to be included in the royal party when the King of the Belgians visited the Emperor Napoleon III in Calais.
Browning left Eton in 1856, having gained entry to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he began in October. Students at King&#x27;s, the sister-foundation to Eton, were all Etonians, and Browning, who found their continuing association stifling, generally preferred the company of men from other colleges, especially Trinity, where he found kindred spirits who shared his growing radical approach to education. Unlike his Eton years, Browning&#x27;s time at Cambridge passed serenely.

He was invited to join the intellectual group known as the Apostles, was President of the Cambridge Union in 1859, and that same year was elected a fellow of King&#x27;s – a lifetime appointment which would provide a fallback should his career in other fields falter. In a wider sphere he discovered his political identity as a Radical Liberal, a disciple of John Stuart Mill. Among the more significant friendships initiated at Cambridge was that with Henry Sidgwick from Trinity College, later a leading educational reformer, of whom Browning would write: &quot;I consulted him on every important matter, and never failed to follow his counsel&quot;.

Browning graduated in 1860, taking fourth position in the Classical Tripos. His immediate future was undecided; perhaps travel, the English Bar, or an academic post at Cambridge. Instead, he accepted an invitation to return to Eton as an assistant master. Apart from the financial and domestic security this would bring, he saw it as an opportunity to put some of his more enlightened educational ideas into practice. He would later say that his objective as a schoolmaster was &quot;that every pupil of mine should have an experience as different as possible from what my own had been.&quot;

===Eton schoolmaster===
====Young reformer====
When Browning began teaching at Eton he found the college&#x27;s governance was largely unchanged from its foundation in the 15th century, and its general curriculum barely reformed from those days: classical Latin and Greek texts learned through repetition, a little mathematics, and all other subjects taught as optional extras. However, change was in the air; in 1861 the government set up the Clarendon Commission to enquire into the conditions of Britain&#x27;s nine leading public schools. 

When the commission investigated Eton, the newly-appointed headmaster, Edward Balston, presented a cautious traditionalist view of the curriculum and governance, and saw no need for significant changes. The 25-year-old Browning, giving evidence on 2 July 1862, gave a rather more radical viewpoint. He thought that too little recognition was given to scholarly prowess as against athletic achievement, and that the formal curriculum should be overhauled to include the teaching of French and history. His wider-ranging criticisms included the nature and standard of chapel services, and the over-tolerance of the boys&#x27; beer-drinking habits.

This reforming zeal was not shared by Browning&#x27;s more traditionally-minded colleagues, who included his exact contemporary Edmond Warre, a vociferous opponent of reform who in due course became Eton&#x27;s headmaster and later, provost. Nevertheless, the Clarendon Commission&#x27;s report, issued in 1864, was critical of the school and largely endorsed the views of Browning and the reformers. By this time Browning had become a housemaster, which provided him with scope to put his personal educational ethos into practice. His house, under the domestic supervision of his mother, was initially the smallest in the college, with just nine boarders. As the house grew, it became known for numerous characteristic features; Richard Davenport-Hines, in a biographical sketch, summarises the general ambience thus:
&quot;His house had a controversially Pre-Raphaelite tone; the food was nourishing and plentiful, the curtains were by William Morris ... There was much jolliness and ragging led by the man–boy at the centre, but the bronzes and marbles in his corridors discouraged rough-housing ... OB passionately desired to reform Eton so that it could educate an effective governing class for a democratic age; these new rulers, in his ideal, would rest their power on the Platonic virtues of wisdom and goodness as well as hereditary privilege.&quot;

Although not opposed to healthy physical activity – he was a keen climber and member of the Alpine Club, and promoted sports and games among the junior boys – Browning disavowed the cult of athleticism. As an alternative to &quot;Pop&quot;, which he thought had become infested with athletics-worship, he began a Literary Society, to which distinguished visiting speakers were invited. He instituted regular poetry and play readings, and encouraged the appreciation of music with performances by local musicians of works by emergent modern composers such as Brahms. Many wealthy and influential parents sought places for their sons in Browning&#x27;s house. As a result, his income rose spectacularly, from the assistant master&#x27;s stipend of £42 per annum plus fees from tutoring, to something between £2,500 and £3,000 as a result of his profits from boarding fees. &quot;I am so prosperous&quot;, he wrote in 1866, &quot;as almost to be astonished myself&quot;.

In 1868 Browning published his first full-length work, a school textbook in the form of a new edition of the writings of the Roman historian Cornelius Nepos. He was a regular contributor of articles and reviews to some of the leading contemporary journals. He extended his educational work beyond the boundaries of the school, becoming secretary of the Windsor and Eton Association for the Education of Women.

====Hornby and controversy====

In 1868 Balston resigned, and was succeeded as headmaster by James John Hornby. This appointment broke with the tradition that Eton headmasters always came from King&#x27;s College, Cambridge (Hornby was an Oxford man). The change was welcomed by Browning: &quot;We shall now be governed on the principles that universally obtain in human society&quot;. Hornby introduced modest curriculum and timetable changes which incorporated history, science, modern languages and other subjects into the main curriculum. However, the anti-reform instincts at Eton remained strong, and Hornby soon identified with the more traditionalist factions led by Warre. 

He was irritated by Browning&#x27;s independent outlook and objected to his teaching of &quot;modern&quot; history such as the French Revolution. Hornby thought that Browning neglected his real work, the teaching of classics, in favour of his experimental pedagogical methods and outside activities such as &quot;lecturing to ladies&quot;, and was critical of a supposed lack of discipline in his classes. Contrary to Hornby&#x27;s view, Browning, despite his unorthodox approach, attached great importance to the teaching of classics, and would later cite the classical education given at Eton as the chief reason for the pre-eminence of Etonians in public life.

Browning&#x27;s personal relationships with boys were a further matter of concern to Hornby. Although Browning took a firm personal line against homosexuality, masturbation and any other sexual practices, he maintained a series of romantic friendships with boys. He had favourites, who were often replaced with a brutal suddenness when they lost their appeal. Sometimes, one of these would accompany him on his regular European trips during the summer holidays, as did Gerald Balfour, the future prime minister&#x27;s brother, in 1869. Although this type of close, even affectionate master-boy relationship was considered generally acceptable in Victorian public school life, Browning&#x27;s flamboyance and mannerisms were contrary to Hornby&#x27;s vision for the school; Anstruther writes: &quot;The mere sight of Oscar Browning with his pale face and effeminate manner was enough in itself to make Hornby suspicious&quot;. Furthermore, Browning&#x27;s friendship with the artist Simeon Solomon was widely known. Solomon, like Browning, was an advocate of &quot;Greek love&quot;, a concept derived from Plato&#x27;s Dialogues which held that the highest form of love was that of men for each other, exclusive of physical expression. 

The two holidayed together, and Solomon was a frequent visitor to Eton – he exchanged with Browning a series of intimate letters in which they mutually extolled the beauties of various boys. In February 1873 Solomon was convicted of an act of gross indecency in a London public lavatory – a consensual act of sodomy with a mature working-class male was far from the ideals of Greek love, and Browning ended the relationship with Solomon immediately.

====Dismissal====

Hornby&#x27;s patience with Browning&#x27;s conduct was tested further in 1874, when Browning began a friendship with a boy from another house – acting with the full approval of the boy&#x27;s father. The boy was George Curzon, the future Conservative statesman and Viceroy of India. The nature of this association became the occasion for gossip amongst the staff; Curzon&#x27;s housemaster, Charles Wolley-Dod, complained to Hornby, who after some equivocation ordered Browning to end all contact with the boy during term-time. 

Browning was outraged by what he took as a slur on his morals, and a heated correspondence with Hornby ensued. Since he had the support of Curzon&#x27;s father, Lord Scarsdale, Browning challenged the headmaster&#x27;s injunction and appealed to the provost, who upheld Hornby. Under threat of dismissal unless he submitted, Browning did so reluctantly, while continuing to meet Curzon during the holidays.

According to Browning&#x27;s biographer Ian Anstruther, Browning seriously contemplated resignation in the summer of 1874, but was persuaded otherwise by his friend, the novelist George Eliot. He returned to Eton that autumn, but made little effort to lie low or adhere to regulations which he was accustomed to ignoring if inconvenient. One of these related to the maximum number of pupils for whom any master could act as tutor, that number being forty; Browning had forty-three. Although given a temporary dispensation from this rule by the provost, this expired in the summer of 1875. Browning did not seek a renewal of permission but continued to tutor his excess pupils. This act of insubordination, the latest in a long line of infringements and subversion of regulations, alongside the suspicions arising from the Curzon relationship, proved to be the last straw for Hornby. On 16 September 1875, after a series of tense meetings, he wrote a formal letter to Browning dismissing him from his post. 

This sudden action stunned Browning and all of Eton. Most of the assistant masters, and many of the parents of the boys in his house, petitioned Hornby and the Governing Body to retract the dismissal. On 9 November 1875, when the governing body met to consider the matter, they ratified Hornby&#x27;s decision. An appeal by Browning to public opinion led to a spate of supportive letters and editorials in the leading newspapers but to no avail. At the end of 1875, Browning closed his house and left Eton, his final request for a measure of financial compensation being rejected.

Browning spent the first months of 1876 with his family, and that summer travelled with them to Leipzig, taking along four of his former Eton pupils. He found time in August to visit Bayreuth, where he attended the first full performance of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; Cycle. Meanwhile, a petition against the rights of public school masters to dismiss their staff at will was presented to the House of Commons by Edward Knatchbull-Hugessen, but the House upheld such rights. A writer in &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; ridiculed the presumption of assistant masters in seeking to challenge the powers of headmasters, and stressed the dangers to schoolboys of such an example of insubordination. As to Browning, according to this anonymous correspondent, &quot;Mr Browning has peculiar ideas as to the proper method of educating boys at a public school&quot; – ideas inimical to Eton&#x27;s traditions of &quot;manliness and common sense&quot;.

===Fellow of King&#x27;s===
====Reforming don====

In September 1876, Browning returned to Cambridge and his King&#x27;s College Fellowship where, despite an outwardly cordial reception, he faced some animosity. Many of his King&#x27;s colleagues, all Etonians, were unimpressed by the circumstances of his departure from the school, and his reputation as a radical reformer gave further grounds for concern. This old guard obstructed his appointment to a college lectureship, which would have increased his income beyond the basic Fellow&#x27;s stipend of £300 a year. However, a group of more sympathetic dons, under John Robert Seeley, raised a subscription which funded an unofficial lectureship in history and enhanced Browning&#x27;s earnings by around £150 a year.

Browning believed that the function of the History school in King&#x27;s was to educate future statesmen. He began a history course on Treaties, and was able to augment his income with fees from students attracted to the course. Browning&#x27;s tutorials, held in his book-lined and lavishly decorated rooms, soon became famous; in the memory of one participant, &quot;his talk was like a flow of molten lava that bore every kind of reminiscence on its tide&quot;. Within months of his arrival he had founded the Political Society, where students presented papers for discussion and criticism, thereby anticipating the role of the seminar as a feature of English university education. 

He began other societies, in particular a group devoted to the music of Mozart which developed into a Musical Society to which leading contemporary performers were invited. He also instituted a regular series of &quot;at homes&quot; in his rooms, at which his students would be able to meet and converse with Browning&#x27;s distinguished friends and acquaintances, who might include George Eliot, Walter Pater, or John Ruskin. These occasions provided a stimulating adjunct to the learning process which, Mark McBeth observes, &quot;did not have to be unglamorous, mind-numbing, nor rigid; it could be entertaining as well as informative, and intellectually stimulating&quot;.

Using the 1874 Report of the Royal Commission on Oxford and Cambridge as a lever, Browning proposed a raft of reforms as to how King&#x27;s should reorganise itself. He argued that the college should place the needs of its students at its centre, and should provide the resources to support a student &quot;in any line of study that he might adopt&quot;, amid &quot;companions most congenial to an industrious and able man&quot;. He compared King&#x27;s unfavourably with its sister-college Trinity, and also suggested, undiplomatically, that the King&#x27;s College provost should be paid less and his living accommodation made smaller. Though largely ignored at the time, many of Browning&#x27;s ideas would be adopted in future years.

====Building a reputation====
In 1879 Browning became secretary of the Cambridge branch of the Oxbridge Teachers&#x27; Training Syndicate (TTS), formed the previous year with the object of bringing the training of teachers, at the time uncodified, into the purview of Oxford and Cambridge universities to provide a greater intellectual foundation for the profession. TTS students were not members of the university, but attended lectures and were examined and certificated by the university. Despite Browning&#x27;s enthusiasm, the syndicate struggled to establish itself in the face of the university&#x27;s general indifference to teacher education, but was warmly supported by the educationist and cleric George Ridding, who told Browning: &quot;The existence of such a Syndicate as yours appears to me to give ... the best possible opportunity for consultative construction of a future Theory for higher education&quot;. Two years later Browning published his first major book on educational theory, &quot;History of Educational Theories&quot;, later translated into several languages and reprinted several times up to 1905. In 1883 he edited a new version of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Tractate of Education&quot;.

Browning was appointed to a formal King&#x27;s College lectureship in 1880, and worked hard to establish himself as an academic historian. He published successful school textbooks on Modern England and Modern France, and edited a series of political memoranda and despatches from the Napoleonic era. He was elected to the Royal Historical Society in 1884, and was chairman of the society&#x27;s council in 1885. During the following years he wrote prolifically, but his work did not bring him the scholastic recognition he hoped for. His books were regarded by his peers as slipshod and inaccurate, one critic writing: &quot;If the reader is not particular about grammar and style, and is judiciously suspicious of dates, he, or more likely she, will derive both amusement and profit from Mr Browning&#x27;s pages&quot;.
In 1880 Browning&#x27;s long-time friend George Eliot (Mary Anne Evans) died; he was among the mourners at Highgate Cemetery when she was buried there on 29 December. Apart from his mother, she was the most influential woman in Browning&#x27;s life; some of his acquaintances thought he wanted to marry her. He decided to honour her memory by writing her biography with, he said, &quot;no claims to offer but a friendship of fifteen years, and a deep and unswerving devotion to her mind and character&quot;. 

Published in 1890 as part of a series on Great Writers, it was Browning&#x27;s most successful book, with 39 editions being issued up to 2012. He followed it up with two short literary lives, respectively of Dante Alighieri (published 1891), and Goethe (published 1892). By this time he had met and befriended Oscar Wilde, a friendship that lasted until Wilde&#x27;s scandal and imprisonment in 1895, when Browning contributed to the fund set up by Wilde&#x27;s friends to help pay his debts. 

Browning was acquainted through meetings or correspondence with leading literary figures such as Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Algernon Swinburne, and the unrelated Robert Browning. According to the critic Noel Annan, writing in 1983, Oscar Browning introduced himself presumptuously to the Poet Laureate with the words &quot;Hello, Tennyson, I&#x27;m Browning&quot;, and received the reply &quot;No, you&#x27;re not&quot;.

In 1881 Browning became treasurer of the Cambridge Union, a post he held for 21 years. In 1887 he became president of Footlights, serving until 1895. He also founded the Cambridge University Liberal Club in 1886, becoming its first Treasurer, and staying in post for a decade. During that time, he hosted a whole range of society events at his rooms in King&#x27;s, from committee meetings and sherry parties to the larger &quot;At Home&quot; evenings which offered a rare chance for men and women in Cambridge to socialise together. 

By 1888 he was sufficiently well known to be the subject of a caricature by W.B. Hayes (&quot;Hay&quot;), as one of the &quot;Men of the Day&quot;, in the society magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. In 1886 Browning entered active politics as a Gladstonian Liberal; in that year&#x27;s general election, as the Liberal Party&#x27;s candidate in the South London constituency of Norwood, where he was heavily defeated. He fought two further elections, in 1892 at East Worcestershire and in 1895 at Liverpool West Derby, in each case losing by large majorities. 

====Day Training College====
=====Inception=====

The Education Act, 1880 introduced compulsory education for children aged between five and ten. This greatly increased the demand for teachers and created a need for a better trained and more attractive teaching profession. Among the initiatives designed to meet this need was a government Code of Regulation issued in 1890, which led to the establishment of university-based day training colleges.

On 12 March 1891 Browning and his colleague Henry Sidgwick presented the Cambridge University Senate with a proposal to establish in Cambridge a Day Training College for elementary school teachers. The proposal received a &quot;Grace&quot; (provisional acceptance) from the Senate, on the basis of which Browning applied to the government&#x27;s Education Department for approval to open the college. Permission was granted in August 1891, before the Senate&#x27;s final assent. According to Browning, he and Sidgwick mutually decided not to wait, and declared the Cambridge University Day Training College (CUDTC) open in September 1891.

=====Growth=====
Browning became the CUDTC&#x27;s first principal, with a nominal salary of £10 per year. The CUDTC was not a &quot;college&quot; in the conventional Cambridge sense; apart from a few registered as non-collegiate, most of its students were attached to colleges such as King&#x27;s or Trinity, studying for Cambridge degrees alongside their CUDTC training. This heavy workload was made even more onerous by the university&#x27;s regulation that all students had to pass a first-year examination in Latin and Greek, known as &quot;Previous&quot;.

This examination was a significant hurdle to many of the students attracted to the CUDTC programme, as unlike most standard Cambridge entrants, they would not have studied classical languages at school. Browning&#x27;s solution was to personally coach these students, to a level that would satisfy the requirements of &quot;Previous&quot;. &quot;In this manner&quot;, he stated, &quot;we got our men through satisfactorily&quot;. As student numbers grew, a specialist classics lecturer was taken on by the DTC to help fulfil this task.
In its first year, 1891–92, the CUDTC registered just three students, rising to ten in its second year and twenty-two in its third. Its classes were conducted by Browning and a team of part-time lecturers. For many students, funding was a severe problem. Browning constantly lobbied the university for financial support, which was sparsely given, and sought funds from outside organisations. In conjunction with Samuel Barnett, the founder of East London&#x27;s Toynbee Hall settlement, he developed a student sponsorship scheme which had raised £385 (approximately £45,000 in 2017 terms) by 1893.

Initially, the CUDTC provided professional training opportunities only for elementary school teachers. Browning thought that the same training was relevant to secondary school teachers, although this was contrary to the traditional view of most secondary headmasters that university graduates did not require pedagogic training. Browning disagreed, arguing that the same pedagogic skills were required at all levels of teaching, whether in elementary, secondary or elite public schools. He proceeded cautiously, finally opening the CUDTC&#x27;s doors to trainee secondary teachers in 1897.

Despite the continuing growth of the CUDTC, the university provided no administrative support facilities or teaching premises; teaching took place wherever Browning could find accommodation, while the college&#x27;s office was in Browning&#x27;s King&#x27;s College rooms. In 1904 he was finally able to establish a permanent CUDTC headquarters at Warkworth House, a Victorian villa in Cambridge. The growth of the CUDTC ran alongside that of the Cambridge Training College for Women (CTC), founded in 1884 by Elizabeth Hughes. 

The two principals maintained a professional relationship that the educational historians Pam Hirsch and Mark McBeth describe as &quot;symbiotic&quot;, although one observer asserted that there was &quot;no cordiality whatever between the two&quot;. In his memoirs, Browning refers to Hughes as &quot;my old friend and enemy&quot;. Their respective training colleges shared facilities and examinations and were to an extent interdependent; they acted as &quot;flagships which had a material effect on raising the profile of education and teacher training in the United Kingdom&quot;.

=====Success and decline=====
A government inspector&#x27;s report on the CUDTC in 1900 recorded increases in numbers and efficiency – &quot;but more rapidly in efficiency than numbers&quot;. A subsequent inspection in 1903 produced more fulsome praise: &quot;The [students&#x27;] teaching exhibited manliness, independence and resource. The students were no longer the hobbled boys of the elementary teacher type. They were real members of the University.&quot; 

In his memoirs, Browning attempted to quantify CUDTC&#x27;s successes. He claimed that by 1907, 40 per cent of its students had obtained first or second-class honours in their university degrees, 28 per cent had gained third-class honours, 24 per cent had ordinary degrees, and 8 per cent were unaccounted for. All but a small handful of ex-students, he said, were engaged in educational work, as elementary or secondary teachers, training college lecturers, or government inspectors.

In 1909, when Browning was past 70, he reluctantly retired from the CUDTC principalship. The college continued, but without Browning&#x27;s force and drive its reputation declined. In the inter-war years the university&#x27;s interest in teacher training withered, and by 1939 the CUDTC had ceased to exist as a distinct entity; it had &quot;fall[en] to a sort of un-noticed death&quot;, according to Hirsch and McBeth.

===Later Cambridge years===
Alongside his CUTDTC role, Browning continued his various university duties. In 1895 he received the first of several late-career disappointments when he failed to be appointed as Regius Professor of History in succession to Sir John Seeley. The appointment, in the gift of the prime minister, Lord Rosebery, went instead to Lord Acton, evidently on the grounds that Browning&#x27;s scholarship lacked sufficient depth. On 17 November 1896, after a series of complaints about Browning&#x27;s overbearing manner, &quot;imperial conduct&quot; and bullying behaviour, he was forced to resign as Treasurer of Cambridge University Liberal Club, of which he was the founder. Browning was uncharacteristically reduced to tears when confronted with his behaviour and given little alternative but to resign. 

Browning continued to produce historical works: a study of Peter the Great in 1898 was followed by a &quot;History of Europe&quot; in 1901. He also provided an introduction to the 1900 edition of Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s notable textbook &quot;The State&quot;. In 1900 a formal portrait of Browning was painted by the Spanish artist Ignacio Zuloaga, one of numerous portraits and caricatures made in Browning&#x27;s later life.
In 1898 Browning&#x27;s former Eton pupil, George Curzon, was appointed Viceroy of Ireland and raised to the Irish peerage as Baron Curzon of Kedleston. In 1902, Curzon invited Browning to India, as his guest at Government House in Calcutta. For five weeks Browning lived and travelled in great style; on his return he wrote an account of his trip, &quot;Impressions of Indian Travel&quot; (1903). Further disappointments awaited him at Cambridge. After 21 years&#x27; service, he was replaced as treasurer of the Cambridge Union. In November 1902, he failed to be re-elected to King&#x27;s College Council, a place he had occupied for decades. 

In February 1904 his application for a Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt) was rejected. Despite the quantity and popularity of his books, he was considered more a journalist than a scholar. A year later, Browning&#x27;s private hopes of becoming provost of King&#x27;s were dashed when M.R. James was appointed to the vacancy. One of James&#x27;s earliest actions as provost was to advise Browning in 1906 that his history lectureship would not be renewed after three further years.

With his Cambridge days drawing to a close, Browning acquired a holiday home in the small seaside town of Bexhill. When not in Cambridge or travelling, he entered into the life of the town, playing golf, attending concerts, giving lectures and entertaining his friends. After meeting an eminent Christian Scientist, Daniel Mayer, on the train to Bexhill, Browning became a convert and a regular attendee of the sect&#x27;s meetings, while remaining a member of the Church of England. In 1909, no longer the CUDTC principal and with his King&#x27;s lectureship terminated, he saw no further reason for remaining in Cambridge and retired to his home in Bexhill.

===Retirement, Rome, death===
Browning&#x27;s stipend and pension, totalling about £700 a year (roughly £75,000 in 2017 terms), enabled him to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle in retirement. He visited the Middle East, and also Russia where he lectured on the &quot;Ideals of Education&quot; to the St Petersburg Guild of English Teachers. Each year he took extended holidays in Italy. When not travelling he was busy writing: his memoirs, &quot;Memories of Sixty Years at Eton, Cambridge, and Elsewhere&quot; appeared in 1910, and a &quot;History of the Modern World, 1815–1910&quot; was published the following year. He also wrote poetry, including (in Latin) an &quot;Ode to the Penis&quot; which, he informed his friend Lord Latymer was &quot;superficially rather smutty, but intrinsically very religious and spiritual&quot;.

The First World War began in August 1914, while Browning was in Italy. His offer to return to England as a stand-in teacher for those called to military service was ignored and he decided to remain in Rome. Here he enjoyed an agreeable life in the English colony, listening to music, serving on various committees and acting as President of the British Academy of Arts. He continued writing, publishing &quot;A General History of the World&quot; in 1915, and &quot;A Short History of Italy&quot; two years later.

After the end of the war, Browning wrote to Curzon, who in 1919 was serving as Britain&#x27;s Foreign Secretary, asking if Curzon could secure him a knighthood – he thought he deserved it for his services to British-Italian relations. Curzon could not deliver this; four years later, in the final months of his life, Browning was appointed to a lower honour, an OBE. 

Shortly before his death, Browning completed a second volume of memoirs, &quot;Memories of Later Years&quot; (1923). He died in Rome on 6 October 1923 after a short illness. His ashes were returned to Cambridge and placed in a vault within King&#x27;s College chapel.

==Appraisal==
In his biography, Anstruther stresses the complexity of Browning&#x27;s character, in which intelligence, wit, and a real love of youth combined with conceit, laziness, insensitivity and trouble-making. &quot;The needle on the balance swings back and forth violently between good and bad&quot;. This dual nature is reflected in the comments of Browning&#x27;s obituarists: according to the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, &quot;no man [was] more difficult to characterise nor more easy to misunderstand&quot;. The writer concedes that his aims generally exceeded his achievements, but acknowledges him as &quot;a man of great power and force ... possessed of a thorough knowledge of the world, with immense kindness of heart&quot;. 

Noel Annan, in a 1983 pen-picture, describes Browning as &quot;preposterous&quot; and &quot;a cracking snob&quot; but recognises Browning&#x27;s pioneer work in the field of teacher training: &quot;He saw that what the desperately poor young men who came to learn to teach in the State schools needed more than anything was encouragement. Shoals of letters from them and their parents showed what he meant to them&quot;. 
In her 1929 essay &quot;A Room of One&#x27;s Own&quot;, the writer Virginia Woolf depicted Browning as a misogynist, a personification of the patriarchal system which restricted women&#x27;s educational opportunities. Invoking a passage from Wortham&#x27;s biography, Woolf wrote: &quot;Mr Oscar Browning was wont to declare that ... irrespective of the marks that he might give, the best woman was intellectually the inferior of the worst man&quot;. The feminist scholar Jane Marcus, writing in 1985, characterised Browning as &quot;the great misogynist of his age, the heroic figure of the man with his finger in the dike against the rising tide of female education...[He] held the unofficial Chair of Applied Misogyny at Cambridge for many years&quot;. 

Hirsch and Peters, however, record that whatever his expressed prejudices, Browning took practical steps to support and develop educational opportunities for women and aid their educational advancement. A letter to Browning from Sidgwick suggests that Browning supported the then highly unfashionable idea that full Cambridge degrees should be awarded to women, a proposal that was not enacted until 1948. Furthermore, when the Political Society debated a motion in support of women&#x27;s suffrage, Browning voted in favour.

In his professional life Browning maintained discretion and decorum; according to Davenport-Hinds: &quot;His eccentricities enabled his protégés to share emotional intimacy without impermissible sexual contact&quot;. Beyond his Cambridge life, Browning acquired a set of rooms in St James&#x27;s Street, London, a base from which he entertained a variety of mainly working-class boys and men, over many years: &quot;Any youth whom OB liked&quot;, says Anstruther, &quot;to whom he thought he could do a kindness, perhaps in exchange for a little amusement, arrived, stayed and went away&quot;. Browning treated these acquaintances well, with generous gifts and hospitality, but as with the favourites from his Eton schoolmastering days, they were liable to be dropped without ceremony when Browning tired of them.
Although Browning was recognised as a gifted teacher, he acquired no standing as a scholar. Nevertheless, modern historians have recognised that his work in teacher education provided a foundation for the University&#x27;s present-day Faculty of Education, However, whereas Elizabeth Hughes&#x27;s memory is perpetuated through Hughes Hall, Browning&#x27;s contribution to education has no official recognition in Cambridge or elsewhere. According to Hirsch and McBeth, &quot;people knew who he was but not what he did&quot;. Thus he is remembered more as a &quot;character&quot;, a flamboyant, faintly ridiculous figure; such characterisation, say Hirsch and McBeth, has &quot;blurred and distorted any serious account of his achievements&quot;.

==Works==

Browning&#x27;s writings comprise historical works, mainly of the popular variety. He also wrote on educational matters, completed several literary biographies, and completed two volumes of memoirs.

<text>Freud is a tiny lunar impact crater that lies on a plateau within the Oceanus Procellarum, in the northwest part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It is located a few kilometers to the west of the Vallis Schröteri, a large, sinuous valley that begins to the north of the crater Herodotus, then meanders north, then northwest, and finally southwest, until it reaches the edge of the lunar mare.

<text>Fredholm is a small lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged ground to the west of the Mare Crisium. It was named after Swedish mathematician Erik I. Fredholm. It was previously designated Macrobius D. It lies midway between the prominent craters Macrobius to the north and Proclus almost due south.

This is a circular, symmetrical formation with a bowl-shaped interior. The inner walls gradually slope down towards the small, central floor, which is less than one quarter the total diameter of the crater. Neatly attached to the northern rim is the smaller Macrobius E.

<text>The Indochinese tiger is a population of the &quot;Panthera tigris tigris&quot; subspecies that is native to Southeast Asia. This population occurs in Myanmar and Thailand. In 2011, the population was thought to comprise 342 individuals, including 85 in Myanmar and 20 in Vietnam, with the largest population unit surviving in Thailand, estimated at 189 to 252 individuals during the period 2009 to 2014.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Panthera tigris corbetti&quot; was proposed as a scientific name for this specific population by Vratislav Mazák in 1968 based on skin colouration, marking pattern, and skull dimensions. It was named in honor of Jim Corbett.

In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised felid taxonomy and now recognizes the tiger populations of mainland South and Southeast Asia as belonging to the nominate subspecies &quot;P. tigris tigris&quot;. Results of a genetic study published in 2018 supported six monophyletic clades based on whole genome sequencing analysis of 32 tiger specimens. The specimens from Malaysia and Indochina appeared to be distinct from other mainland Asian populations, thus supporting the concept of six living subspecies.

==Characteristics==

The Indochinese tiger’s ground colouration is darker, with more rather short and narrow single stripes; its skull is smaller than that of the Bengal tiger. Eleven Indochinese tiger skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London, have 21–31 stripes. In body size, it is smaller than the Bengal and Siberian tigers. Males range in size from and in weight, from . Females range in size from and in weight, from .

==Distribution and habitat==
The Indochinese tiger is distributed in Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. Its historical range also included Cambodia, southern China and Vietnam. Results of a phylogeographic study, using 134 tiger samples across the global range, suggest that the historical northwestern distribution limit of the Indochinese tiger is the region in the Chittagong Hill Tracts and Brahmaputra River basin, bordering the range of the Bengal tiger.

In Myanmar, surveys were conducted between 1999 and 2002, confirming the presence of tigers in the Hukawng Valley, Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary and in two small areas in the Tanintharyi Region. The Tenasserim Hills is an important area, but forests are harvested there. In 2015, tigers were recorded by camera traps for the first time in the hill forests of Kayin State. Camera trap surveys between 2016 and 2018 revealed about 22 adult individuals in three sites that represent 8% of the potential tiger habitat in the country.

More than half of the total Indochinese tiger population survives in the Western Forest Complex in Thailand, especially in the area of the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary. This habitat consists of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests. Camera trap surveys from 2008 to 2017 in eastern Thailand detected about 17 adult tigers in an area of in Dong Phayayen–Khao Yai Forest Complex. Several individuals had cubs. The population density in Thap Lan National Park, Pang Sida National Park and Dong Yai Wildlife Sanctuary was estimated at 0.32–1.21 individuals per . Three subadult tigers were photographed in spring 2020 in a remote region of Thailand that are thought to be dispersing.

In Laos, 14 tigers were documented in Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area during surveys from 2013 to 2017, covering four blocks of about semi-evergreen and evergreen forest that are interspersed with some patches of grassland. More recent surveys have failed to detect any tigers, and the likelihood is that they have been extirpated as a result of poaching, fueled by demand from China.

In eastern Cambodia, tigers were last recorded in Mondulkiri Protected Forest and Virachey National Park during surveys between 1999 and 2007. In 2016, the Cambodian government declared that the tiger was &quot;functionally extinct&quot;. In April 2023, India signed a memorandum of understanding with Cambodia to assist the country with the tiger&#x27;s reintroduction. At least of the Cardamom Mountains of Tatai Wildlife Sanctuary could be used to host Bengal tigers.

From the 1960s and earlier, the Indochinese tiger occurred throughout the mountains in Vietnam, even in the midlands and Islands. In the report of the Government of Vietnam at the Tiger Forum in 2004, there would be tigers in only 17 provinces and they were living in fragmented and severely degraded forest areas. Tigers were still present in 14 protected areas in the 1990s, but none have been recorded in the country since 1997.
The population in Laos and Vietnam has declined significantly. According to the global tiger census of 2016, only two tigers were left in Laos and less than five in Vietnam. There is news of its extinction in both countries. In Laos, no tiger has been seen since 2013, when its populations were estimated at only two, and these two individuals vanished shortly after 2013 from Nam Et-Phou Louey National Protected Area, denoting they were most likely killed either by snare or gun. In Vietnam, a 2014 IUCN Red List report indicated that tigers were possibly extinct in Vietnam.

In China, it occurred historically in Yunnan province and Mêdog County, where it probably does not survive today. Thus, probably the Indochinese tiger now only survives in Thailand and Myanmar. In Yunnan&#x27;s Shangyong Nature Reserve, three individuals were detected during surveys carried out from 2004 to 2009.

==Behaviour and ecology==
In Thailand&#x27;s Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, seven female and four male tigers were equipped with GPS radio collars between June 2005 and August 2011. Females had a mean home range of and males of .

Between 2013 and 2015, 11 prey species were identified at 150 kill sites. They ranged in weight from . Sambar deer, banteng, gaur, and wild boar were most frequently killed, but also remains of Asian elephant calves, hog badger, Old World porcupine, muntjac, serow, pangolin, and langur species were identified.
==Threats==
The primary threat to the tiger is poaching for the illegal wildlife trade. Tiger bone has been an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 1,500 years and is either added to medicinal wine, used in the form of powder, or boiled to a glue-like consistency. More than 40 different formulae containing tiger bone were produced by at least 226 Chinese companies in 1993. Tiger bone glue is a popular medicine among urban Vietnamese consumers.

Between 1970 and 1993, South Korea imported of tiger bones from Thailand and from China between 1991 and 1993. Between 2001 and 2010, wildlife markets were surveyed in Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos. During 13 surveys, 157 body parts of tigers were found, representing at least 91 individuals. Whole skins were the most commonly traded parts. Bones, paws, and penises were offered as aphrodisiacs in places with a large sex industry. Tiger bone wine was offered foremost in shops catering to Chinese customers. Traditional medicine accounted for a large portion of products sold and exported to China, Laos, and Vietnam.

Between 2000 and 2011, 641 tigers, both live and dead, were seized in 196 incidents in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and China; 275 tigers were suspected to have leaked into trade from captive facilities. China was the most common destination of the seized tigers.

In Myanmar&#x27;s Hukaung Valley, the Yuzana Corporation, alongside local authorities, has expropriated more than of land from more than 600 households since 2006. Much of the trees have been logged, and the land has been transformed into plantations. Some of the land taken by the Yazana Corporation had been deemed tiger transit corridors. These are areas of land that were supposed to be left untouched by development in order to allow the region&#x27;s Indochinese tigers to travel between protected pockets of reservation land.

== Conservation ==

Since 1993, the Indochinese tiger has been listed on CITES Appendix I, making international trade illegal. China, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, and Taiwan banned trade in tigers and sale of medicinal derivatives. Manufacture of tiger-based medicine was banned in China, and the open sale of tiger-based medicine reduced significantly since 1995.

Patrolling in Thailand&#x27;s Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary has been intensified since 2006 so that poaching appears to have been reduced, resulting in a marginal improvement of tiger survival and recruitment. By autumn 2016, at least two individuals had dispersed to adjacent Mae Wong National Park; six cubs were observed in Mae Wong and the contiguous Khlong Lan National Park in 2016, indicating that the population was breeding and recovering.

In Thailand and Laos, this tiger is considered Endangered, while it is considered Critically Endangered in Vietnam and Myanmar.

===In captivity===
The Indochinese tiger is the least represented in captivity and is not part of a coordinated breeding program. As of 2007, 14 individuals were recognized as Indochinese tigers based on genetic analysis of 105 captive tigers in 14 countries.

<doc id="1270559" wikidata="Q342057" url="?curid=1270559" title="Acoma Pueblo">
<text>Acoma Pueblo ( , ) is a Native American pueblo approximately west of Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the United States.

Four communities make up the village of Acoma Pueblo: Sky City (Old Acoma), Acomita, Anzac, and McCartys. These communities are located near the expansive Albuquerque metropolitan area, which includes several large cities and towns, including neighboring Laguna Pueblo. The Acoma Pueblo tribe is a federally recognized tribal entity, whose historic land of Acoma Pueblo totaled roughly . Today, much of the Acoma community is primarily within the Acoma Indian Reservation. Acoma Pueblo is a National Historic Landmark.

According to the 2010 United States Census, 4,989 people identified as Acoma. The Acoma have continuously occupied the area for over 2,000 years, making this one of the oldest continuously inhabited communities in the United States (along with Taos and Hopi pueblos). Acoma tribal traditions estimate that they have lived in the village for more than two thousand years.

==Names==

The English name &quot;Acoma&quot; was borrowed from Spanish (1583) or (1598). The Spanish name was borrowed from the Acoma word meaning &#x27;person from Acoma Pueblo&#x27;. itself is derived from (singular; plural: ). The name does not have any meaning in the modern Acoma language. Some tribal authorities connect it to the similar word , &#x27;preparedness, place of preparedness&#x27;, and suggest that this might be the origin of the name. The name does not mean &#x27;sky city&#x27;. Other tribal elders assert that it means &#x27;place that always was&#x27;, while outsiders say it means &#x27;people of the white rock&#x27;.

&quot;Acoma&quot; has been spelled in various other ways in historical documents, including &quot;ákuma, ákomage, Acus, Acux, Aacus, Hacús, Vacus, Vsacus, Yacco, Acco, Acuca, Acogiya, Acuco, Coco, Suco, Akome, Acuo, Ako,&quot; and &quot;A’ku-me.&quot; The Spanish mission name was .

 is the Spanish word for &#x27;village&#x27; or &#x27;small town&#x27; and &#x27;people&#x27;. In general usage, it is applied both to the people and to the unique architecture of the southwestern native tribes.

The Acoma are called ( in Western Keresan, in Zuni, and in Navajo.

==Language==
The Acoma language is classified in the western division of the Keresan languages. In contemporary Acoma Pueblo culture, most people speak both Acoma and English, elders speak an endangered indigenous variant of New Mexican Spanish.

==History==

===Origins and prehistory===

Pueblo people are believed to have descended from the Ancestral Puebloans, Mogollon, and other ancient peoples. These influences are seen in the architecture, farming style, and artistry of the Acoma. In the 13th century, the Ancestral Puebloans abandoned their canyon homelands due to climate change and social upheaval. For more than two centuries, there were migrations in the area. The Acoma Pueblo emerged by the 13th century. However, the Acoma themselves say the Sky City Pueblo was established in the 11th century, with brick buildings as early as 1144 on the mesa. Evidence for their antiquity is the unique lack of adobe in their construction. This early founding date makes Acoma Pueblo one of the earliest continuously inhabited communities in the United States.

The Pueblo is situated on a mesa, about west of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The isolation and location of the Pueblo has sheltered the community for more than 1,200 years as they sought protection from the raids of the neighboring Navajo and Apache peoples.

===European contact===

The first mention of Acoma was in 1539. Estevanico, a slave and was the first person of African descent to explore North America, was the first non-Indian to visit Acoma and reported it to Marcos de Niza, who related the information to the viceroy of New Spain after the end of his expedition. Acoma was called the independent Kingdom of Hacus. He called the Acoma people &quot;encaconados,&quot; which meant that they had turquoise hanging from their ears and noses.

Lieutenant Hernando de Alvarado of conquistador Francisco Vázquez de Coronado&#x27;s expedition described the Pueblo (which they called &quot;Acuco&quot;) in 1540 as &quot;a very strange place built upon solid rock&quot; and &quot;one of the strongest places we have seen.&quot; Upon visiting the Pueblo, the expedition &quot;repented having gone up to the place.&quot; Further from Alvarado&#x27;s report:

It is believed Coronado&#x27;s expedition were the first Europeans to encounter the Acoma (Estevan was a native Moroccan). Alvarado reported that first the Acoma refused entry even after persuasions, but after Alvarado showed threats of an attack, the Acoma guards welcomed the Spaniards peacefully, noting that they and their horses were tired. The encounter shows that the Acoma had clothing made of deerskin, buffalo hide, and woven cotton, as well as turquoise jewelry, domestic turkeys, bread, pine nuts, and maize. The village seemed to contain about 200 men.

Acoma was next visited by the Spanish 40 years later in 1581 by Fray Agustín Rodríguez and Francisco Sánchez Chamuscado, with 12 soldiers, 3 other friars, and 13 others, including Indian servants. The Acoma at this time were reported to be somewhat defensive and fearful. This response may have been due to the knowledge of the Spanish enslavement of other Indians to work in silver mines in the area. However, eventually the Rodríguez and Chamuscado party convinced them to trade goods for food. The Spaniard reports say the pueblo had about 500 houses of either three or four stories high.

In 1582, Acoma was visited again by Antonio de Espejo for three months. The Acoma were reported to be wearing mantas. Espejo also noted irrigation in Acomita, the farming village in the north valley near San Jose River, which was two leagues from the mesa. He saw evidence of intertribal trade with &quot;mountain Querechos&quot;. Acoma oral history does not confirm this trade but only tells of common messengers to and from the mesa and Acomita, McCartys Village, and Seama.

Juan de Oñate intended to colonize New Mexico starting from 1595 (he formally held the area by April 1598). The Acoma warrior Zutacapan heard of this plan and warned the mesa and organized a defense. However, a pueblo elder, Chumpo, dissuaded war, partly to prevent deaths and partly based on Zutancalpo&#x27;s (Zutacapan&#x27;s son) mentioning of the widespread belief that the Spaniards were immortal. Thus, when Oñate visited on October 27, 1598, Acoma met him peacefully, with no resistance to Oñate&#x27;s demand of surrender and obedience reported. Oñate demonstrated his military power by firing a gun salute. Zutacapan offered to meet Oñate formally in the religious kiva, which is traditionally used as the place to make sacred oaths and pledges. However, Oñate was scared of death and in suspicious ignorance of Acoma customs refused to enter via ladder from the roof into the dark kiva chambers. Purguapo was another Acoma man out of four chosen for Spaniard negotiations.

Soon after Oñate&#x27;s departure, Gaspar Pérez de Villagrá visited Acoma by himself with a dog and a horse and asked for other supplies. Villagrá refused to get off his horse and left to follow Oñate&#x27;s party. However, Zutacapan convinced him to return to receive supplies. In questioning by Zutacapan, Villagrá said that 103 armed men were two days away from Acoma. Zutacapan then told Villagrá to leave Acoma.

On December 1, 1598, Juan de Zaldívar, Oñate&#x27;s nephew, reached Acoma with 20–30 men and peacefully traded with them and had to wait some days for their order of ground corn. On December 4, Zaldívar went with 16 armored men to Acoma to find out about the corn. Zutacapan met them and directed them to the homes with the corn. Zaldívar&#x27;s people then divided into groups to collect the corn. The traditional oral Acoma narrative tells that a group attacked some Acoma women, leading Acoma warriors to retaliate. The Spanish documents do not report an attack on the women and say that the division of the men was a reaction to Zutacapan&#x27;s plan to kill Zaldívar&#x27;s party. The Acoma killed 12 of the Spaniards, including Zaldívar. Five men escaped, although one died from jumping over the citadel, leaving four to escape with the remaining camp.

On December 20, 1598, Oñate learned of Zaldívar&#x27;s death and, after receiving encouraging advice from the friars, planned an attack in revenge, as well to teach a lesson to other pueblos. Acomas requested help from other tribes to defend against the Spanish. Among the leaders were Gicombo, Popempol, Chumpo, Calpo, Buzcoico, Ezmicaio, and Bempol (a recruited Apache war leader). On January 21, 1599, Vicente de Zaldívar (Juan de Zaldívar&#x27;s brother) reached Acoma with 70 soldiers. The Acoma Massacre started the next day and lasted for three days. On January 23, men were able to climb the southern mesa unnoticed by Acoma guards and breach the pueblo. The Spanish dragged a cannon through the streets, toppling adobe walls and burning most of the village, killing 800 people (decimating 20% of the 4,000 population) and imprisoning approximately 500 others. Almost all of the remaining inhabitants were enslaved or left the town. The pueblo surrendered at noon on January 24. Zaldívar lost only one of his men. The Spanish amputated the right feet of men over 25 years old, and by some accounts one or more toes of such enslaved men&#x27;s right feet, and forced them into slavery for 20 years. They also took males aged 12–25 and females over 12 away from their parents, putting most of them in slavery for 20 years. The enslaved Acoma were given to government officials and various missions. Two other Indian men visiting Acoma at the time had their right hands cut off and were sent back to their respective Pueblos as a warning of the consequences for resisting the Spanish. On the north side of the mesa, a row of houses still retains marks from the fire started by a cannon during this Acoma War. (Oñate was later exiled from New Mexico for mismanagement, false reporting, and cruelty by Philip III of Spain.)


Survivors of the Acoma Massacre rebuilt their community between 1599 and 1620. The town remained uninhabited for several months, out of fear of more attacks, until it began to be rebuilt in December 1599. Oñate forced the Acoma and other local Indians to pay taxes in crops, cotton, and labor. Spanish rule also brought Catholic missionaries into the area. The Spanish renamed the pueblos with the names of saints and started to construct churches in them. They introduced new crops to the Acoma, including peaches, peppers, and wheat. A 1620 royal decree created Spanish civil offices in each pueblo, including Acoma, with an appointed governor to take command. In 1680, the Pueblo Revolt took place, with Acoma participating. The revolt brought refugees from other pueblos. Those who eventually left Acoma moved elsewhere to form Laguna Pueblo.

The Acoma suffered high mortality from smallpox epidemics, as they had no immunity to such Eurasian infectious diseases. They also suffered raiding from the Apache, Comanche, and Ute. On occasion, the Acoma would side with the Spanish to fight against these nomadic tribes. Forced to formally adopt Catholicism, the Acoma proceeded to practice their traditional religion in secrecy, and combined elements of both in a syncretic blend. Intermarriage and interaction became common among the Acoma, other pueblos, and Hispanic villages. These communities would intermingle in a kind of creolization to form the culture of New Mexico.

====San Esteban Del Rey Mission====

Between 1629 and 1641 Father Juan Ramirez oversaw construction of the San Estevan Del Rey Mission Church. The Acoma were ordered to build the church, moving of adobe, straw, sandstone, and mud to the mesa for the church walls. Ponderosa pine was brought in by community members from Mount Taylor, over away. The church has an altar flanked by -high wood pillars. These are hand carved in red and white designs, representing Christian and Indigenous beliefs. The Acoma know their ancestors&#x27; hands built this structure, and they consider it a cultural treasure.

In 1970, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2007, the mission church was designated a National Trust Historic Site, the only Native American site in that ranking as identified by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a non-profit organization.

===19th and 20th century===

During the 19th century, the Acoma people, while trying to uphold traditional life, also adopted aspects of the once-rejected Spanish culture and religion. By the 1880s, railroads brought increased numbers of settlers and ended the pueblos&#x27; isolation.

In the 1920s, the All Indian Pueblo Council gathered for the first time in more than 300 years. Responding to congressional interest in appropriating Pueblo lands, the U.S. Congress passed the Pueblo Lands Act in 1924. Despite successes in retaining their land, the Acoma had difficulty in preserving their cultural traditions in the 20th century. Protestant missionaries established schools in the area, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs forced Acoma children into boarding schools. By 1922, most children from the community were in boarding schools, where they were forced to use English and practice Christianity. Several generations became cut off from their culture and language, with harsh effects on their families and societies.

===Present day===

About 300 two- and three-story adobe buildings stand on the mesa, with exterior ladders used to access the upper levels where residents live. Access to the mesa is by a road blasted into the rock face during the 1950s, navigable by car and bus. Footpaths down the mesa can still be used. Approximately 30 or so people live permanently on the mesa, with the population increasing on the weekends, as family members come to visit, and tourists, some 55,000 annually, visit for the day.

Acoma Pueblo has no electricity, running water, or sewage disposal. Reservation lands surround the mesa, totaling . Tribal members live both on the reservation and outside it. Contemporary Acoma culture remains relatively closed. According to the 2000 United States census, 4,989 people identify themselves as Acoma.

==Culture==

===Governance and reservation===
Acoma government was maintained by two individuals: a &quot;cacique&quot;, or head of the Pueblo, and a war captain, who would serve until their deaths. Both individuals maintained strong religious connections to their work, representing the theocracy of Acoma governance. The Spanish imposed a group to oversee the Pueblo, but their power was not taken seriously by the Acoma. The Spanish group would work with external situations and comprised a governor, two lieutenant governors, and a council. The Acoma also participated in the All Indian Pueblo Council, which started in 1598 and arose again in the 20th century.

The Acoma control approximately of their traditional land. Mesas, valleys, hills, and arroyos dot the landscape that averages about in altitude, with about of rain each year. Since 1977, the Acoma have increased their domain through several land purchases. On the reservation, only tribal members may own land and almost all enrolled members live on the property. The cacique is still active in the community and is from the Antelope clan. The cacique appoints tribal council members, staff, and the governor.

In 2011, Acoma Pueblo and the Pueblo of Santa Clara were victims of heavy flooding. New Mexico supplied more than $1 million to fund emergency preparedness and damage repair for victims, and governor Susana Martinez requested additional funding from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.


===Warfare and weaponry===
Historically, engagements in warfare were common for Acoma, like other Pueblos. Weapons used included clubs, stones, spears, and darts. The Acoma later would serve as auxiliaries for forces under Spain and Mexico, fighting against raids and protecting merchants on the Santa Fe Trail. After the 19th century, raiding tribes were less of a threat and Acoma military culture began to decline. The war captain position eventually would change to a civil and religious function.

===Architecture===

Acoma Pueblo has three rows of three-story, apartment-style buildings, which face south on top of the mesa. The buildings are constructed from adobe brick, with beams across the roof that were covered with poles, brush, and then plaster. The roof for one level would serve as the floor for another. Each level is connected to others by ladders, serving as a unique defensive aid; the ladders are the only way to enter the buildings, as the traditional design has no windows or doors. The lower levels of the buildings were used for storage. Baking ovens are outside the buildings, with water being collected from two natural cisterns. Acoma also has seven rectangular kivas and a village plaza, which serves as the spiritual center for the village.

===Family life===
About 20 matrilineal clans were recognized by the Acoma. Traditional child rearing involved very little discipline . Couples were generally monogamous, and divorce was rare. A quick burial followed death, then four days and nights of vigil. Women wore cotton dresses and sandals or high moccasin boots. Men wore cotton kilts and leather sandals. Rabbit and deer skin was also used for clothing and robes. In the 17th century, horses were introduced to the Pueblo by the Spanish. Education was overseen by kiva headmen, who taught about human behavior, spirit and body, astrology, ethics, child psychology, oratory, history, dance, and music.

Since the 1970s, Acoma Pueblo has retained control over education services, which have been keys in maintaining traditional and contemporary lifestyles. They share a high school with Laguna Pueblo. Alcoholism, drug use, and other health issues are prominent on the reservation and Indian Health Service hospitals and native healers cooperate to battle health problems. Alcohol is banned on the Pueblo. The community is served by the Acoma-Canoncito-Laguna (ACL) Hospital run by the Indian Health Services and located in Acoma. Today, 19 clans still remain active.

===Religion===
Traditional Acoma religion stresses harmony between life and nature. The Sun is a representative of the Creator deity. Mountains surrounding the community, the Sun above, and the Earth below help to balance and define the Acoma world. Traditional religious ceremonies may revolve around the weather, including seeking to ensure healthy rainfall. The Acoma also use kachinas in rituals. The Pueblos also had one or more kivas, which served as religious chambers. The leader of each Pueblo would serve as the community religious leader, or &quot;cacique&quot;. The cacique would observe the Sun and use it as a guide for scheduling ceremonies, some which were kept secret.

Many Acoma are Catholic, but blend aspects of Catholicism and their traditional religion. Many old rituals are still performed. In September, the Acoma honor their patron saint, Saint Stephen. For feast day, the mesa is opened to the public for the celebration. More than 2,000 pilgrims attend the San Esteban Festival. The celebration begins at San Esteban Del Rey Mission, and a carved pine effigy of Saint Stephen is removed from the altar and carried into the main plaza with people chanting, shooting rifles, and ringing steeple bells. The procession then proceeds past the cemetery, down narrow streets, and to the plaza. Upon arriving at the plaza, the effigy is placed in a shrine lined with woven blankets and guarded by two Acoma men. A celebration follows with dancing and feasting. During the festival, vendors sell goods, such as traditional pottery and cuisine.

===Subsistence===
Before contact with the Spanish, Acoma people primarily ate corn, beans, and squash. &quot;Mut-tze-nee&quot; was a popular thin corn bread. They also raised turkeys, tobacco, and sunflowers. The Acoma hunted antelope, deer, and rabbits. Wild seeds, berries, nuts, and other foods were gathered. After 1700, new foods were noted in the historical record. Staples included blue corn drink, pudding, corn mush, corn balls, wheat cake, peach-bark drink, paper bread, flour bread, wild berries, and prickly pear fruit. After contact with the Spanish, goats, horses, sheep and donkeys were raised.

In contemporary Acoma, other foods are also popular, such as apple pastries, corn tamales, green-chili stew with lamb, fresh corn, and wheat pudding with brown sugar.

Irrigation techniques such as dams and terraces were used for agriculture. Farming tools were made of wood and stone. Harvested corn would be ground with hands and mortar.

===Ethnobotany===
A list of Acoma Pueblo ethnobotany shows 68 documented plant uses.

In 1932, George R. Swank published a Master&#x27;s thesis titled &quot;The Ethnobotany of the Acoma and Laguna Indians,&quot; containing short sections on the Puebloans&#x27; history, culture and mythology as well as an extensive treatment of plant uses and names.

===Economy===

Historical Acoma economic practices are described as socialistic or communal. Labor was shared and produce was distributed equally. Trading networks were extensive, spreading thousands of miles throughout the region. During fixed times in the summer and fall, trading fairs were held. The largest fair was held in Taos by the Comanche. Nomadic traders would exchange slaves, buckskins, buffalo hide, jerky, and horses. Pueblo people would trade for copper and shell ornaments, macaw feathers, and turquoise. Since 1821, the Acoma traded via the Santa Fe Trail. The arrival of railroads in the 1880s made the Acoma dependent on American-made goods, which suppressed traditional arts such as weaving and pottery.

Today, the Acoma produce a variety of goods. They grow alfalfa, oats, wheat, chilies, corn, melon, squash, vegetables, and fruit, and they raise cattle. They have natural reserves of gas, geothermal, and coal resources. Uranium mines in the area provided work for the Acoma until their closings in the 1980s. After that, the tribe provided most employment. However, high unemployment rates trouble the Pueblo. The uranium mines left radiation pollution, causing the tribal fishing lake to be drained and some health problems within the community.

====Tourism====
Tourism is a major source of income for the tribe. In 2008, Pueblo Acoma opened the Sky City Cultural Center and Haak&#x27;u Museum at the base of the mesa, replacing the original, which was destroyed by fire in 2000. The center and museum seek to sustain and preserve Acoma culture. Films about Acoma history are shown and a café serves traditional foods. The architecture was inspired by pueblo design and indigenous architectural traditions, with wide doorways in the middle, which in traditional homes make the bringing of supplies easier. The windowpanes contain flecks of mica, a mineral which is used to create mesa windows. The complex is also fire resistant, unlike traditional pueblos, and is painted in light pinks and purples to match the landscape surrounding it. Traditional Acoma artwork is exhibited and demonstrated at the center, including ceramic chimneys crafted on the rooftop. Arts and crafts also bring income.

Acoma Pueblo is open to the public by guided tour from March until October, though June and July have periods of closure for cultural activities. Photography of the Pueblo and surrounding land is restricted. Tours and camera permits are purchased at the Sky City Cultural Center. While photography is allowed with permit, video recordings, drawings, and sketching are prohibited. All photography is forbidden within the church.

The Acoma Pueblo also has a casino and hotel the Sky City Casino Hotel. The casino and hotel are alcohol-free and are maintained by the Acoma Business Enterprise, which oversees most Acoma businesses.

===Arts===

At Acoma, pottery remains one of the most notable artforms. Men create weavings and silver jewelry, as well.

====Pottery====

Acoma pottery dates back more than 1,000 years. Dense local clay, dug up at a nearby site, is essential to Acoma pottery. The clay is dried and strengthened by the addition of pulverized pottery shards. The pieces then are shaped, painted, and fired. Geometric patterns, thunderbirds, and rainbows are traditional designs, which are applied with the spike of a yucca. A potter lightly strikes the side of the pot upon completion and holds it to his or her ear; if the pot does not ring, it will crack during firing. If this is found, the piece is destroyed and ground into shards for future use.

<doc id="1270564" wikidata="Q1251519" url="?curid=1270564" title="John J. Glennon">
<text>John Joseph Glennon (June 14, 1862 – March 9, 1946) was a prelate of the Roman Catholic Church, serving as Archbishop of St. Louis from 1903 until his death in 1946. He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1946.

==Early life and ministry==
John Glennon was born in Kinnegad, County Westmeath, Ireland, to Matthew and Catherine (née Rafferty) Glennon. After graduating from St. Finian&#x27;s College, he entered All Hallows College near Dublin in 1878. He accepted an invitation from Bishop John Joseph Hogan in 1882 to join the newly erected Diocese of Kansas City in the United States. Glennon, after arriving in Missouri in 1883, was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Hogan on December 20, 1884.

He was then assigned to St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Kansas City and, briefly returning to Europe, furthered his studies at the University of Bonn in Germany. Upon his return to Kansas City, Glennon became rector of the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception. He was later made vicar general (1892) and apostolic administrator (1894) for the diocese.

==Episcopal career==
On March 14, 1896, Glennon was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Kansas City and Titular Bishop of &quot;Pinara&quot; by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 29 from Archbishop John Joseph Kain, with Bishops Maurice Francis Burke and John Joseph Hennessy serving as co-consecrators. At age 34, he became one of the youngest bishops in the world.

===Archbishop of St. Louis===
Glennon was later named Coadjutor Archbishop of St. Louis on April 27, 1903. He succeeded Archbishop Kain as the third Archbishop of St. Louis upon the latter&#x27;s death on October 13 of that year. Realizing the Cathedral of St. Louis could no longer accommodate its growing congregation, Glennon quickly began raising funds for a new cathedral, the cornerstone of which was later laid on October 18, 1908.

He opened the new Kenrick Seminary in 1915, followed by the minor seminary in Shrewsbury. He delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Cardinal James Gibbons, and was appointed an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne on June 28, 1921.

====Politics and war====
On July 7, 1904, he offered the invocation at the second session of the 1904 Democratic National Convention. He opposed British rule in Ireland, and supported the leaders of the Easter Rebellion. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, Glennon declared, &quot;We are not a military nation, but we are at war... Churches have a duty in time of war not to promote hatred, racial or otherwise. Churches should give their moral aid and their physical support to the nation.&quot;

====Social issues====
He was an outspoken opponent of divorce, saying, &quot;The modern attitude makes a joke of the sacrament of matrimony.&quot; The Archbishop once lamented the fact that women were competing with men in the workforce, saying, &quot;Some of the women go downtown in the race and race beside the men...It is regrettable that men have to let them, are compelled to let them.&quot; He also condemned gambling games as &quot;unworthy of our Catholic people...causing much scandal,&quot; and prohibited dancing and drinking at church-sponsored events. The Archbishop sometimes threw the opening ball for the St. Louis Cardinals, but did not play any sports himself, once saying, &quot;I once tried golf, but I so disfigured the scenery that I never played again, in fear of public indignation and reprisal.&quot;
====Segregation====
Despite a rather popular tenure, as Archbishop of St. Louis he opposed racial integration in the city&#x27;s Catholic schools, colleges, and universities. During the early 1940s, many local priests, especially Jesuits, challenged the segregationist policies at the city&#x27;s Catholic schools. The St. Louis chapter of the Midwest Clergy Conference on Negro Welfare, formed locally in 1938, pushed the all-female Webster College to integrate first. However, in 1943, Glennon blocked the enrollment of a young black woman at the college by speaking privately with the Kentucky-based superior of the Sisters of Loretto, which staffed the college. 

When approached directly by pro-integration priests, Glennon called the integration plan a &quot;Jesuit ploy,&quot; and quickly transferred one of the complaining priests away from his mission at an African-American parish. The &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, an African-American newspaper with national circulation, discovered Glennon&#x27;s intervention and ran a front-page feature on the Webster incident. In response, Fr Claude Heithaus, SJ, professor of Classical Archaeology at Saint Louis University (SLU), delivered an angry sermon accusing his own institution of immoral behavior in its segregation policies. SLU began admitting African American students that summer when its president, Fr Patrick Holloran, SJ, managed to secure approval from the reluctant Glennon.

===Cardinal and death===

On Christmas Eve 1945, it was announced that the 83-year-old Glennon would be elevated to the College of Cardinals. He originally thought himself too old to make the journey to Rome, but eventually joined fellow Cardinals-elect Francis Spellman and Thomas Tien Ken-sin on their flight, during which time Glennon contracted a cold from which he did not recover. Pope Pius XII created him Cardinal Priest of &quot;S. Clemente&quot; in the consistory of February 18, 1946.

During the return trip to the United States, Glennon stopped in his native Ireland, where he was received by President Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly and Taoiseach Éamon de Valera. While in Dublin, he was diagnosed with uremic poisoning and later died, ending a 42-year tenure as Archbishop. The Cardinal&#x27;s body was returned to St. Louis and then buried at the Cathedral.

Glennon is the namesake of the community of Glennonville, Missouri. The only diocesan hospital for children, Cardinal Glennon Children&#x27;s Hospital, affiliated with St. Louis University Medical Center, was created in his name.

Wolff was born in 1945 in Birmingham, Alabama, the second son of Rosemary (Loftus) from Hartford, Connecticut, and Arthur Samuels Wolff, an aeronautical engineer who was a son of a Jewish doctor and his wife. The father had become Episcopalian, and Wolff did not learn about his father&#x27;s Jewish roots until he was an adult. (Wolff was raised and identifies as Catholic, like his mother.)

His parents separated when Wolff was five and his elder brother Geoffrey was twelve; he lived with his mother in a variety of places, including Seattle, Washington, when he was an adolescent. After she remarried, they lived in Newhalem, a small company town in the North Cascade Mountains, where his stepfather, Robert Thompson, worked at Seattle City Light. His father and brother lived on the East Coast during this period. Geoffrey knew nothing about where his brother was until he entered Princeton.

As a child, Wolff had a local paper route and was a Boy Scout. After attending Concrete High School in Concrete, also in the North Cascades, Wolff applied to and was accepted by The Hill School, located 35 miles from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He had applied under the self-embellished name &quot;Tobias Jonathan von Ansell-Wolff III&quot;, adopting part of one of his father&#x27;s personas, Saunders Ansell-Wolff 3d. When Wolff was found to have forged his transcripts and recommendation letters, he was later expelled.

Wolff served in the U.S. Army from 1964 to 1968, when he trained for Special Forces, learned Vietnamese, and served as an adviser in Vietnam. He holds a First Class Honours degree in English from Hertford College, Oxford (1972). After returning to the United States, in 1975, he was awarded a Wallace Stegner Fellowship in Creative Writing at Stanford University, where he earned an M.A.

While continuing to write, Wolff taught at Syracuse University from 1980 to 1997. He published his first short story collection in 1981. At Syracuse he served on the faculty with Raymond Carver and was an instructor in the graduate writing program. Authors who had studied with Wolff as students at Syracuse include Jay McInerney, Tom Perrotta, George Saunders, Alice Sebold, William Tester, Paul Griner, Ken Garcia, Dana C. Kabel, Jan-Marie Spanard, and Paul Watkins.

In 1997, Wolff transferred to Stanford, where he is the Ward W. and Priscilla B. Woods Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences. He has taught classes in English and creative writing, and also served as the director of the Creative Writing Program at Stanford from 2000 to 2002.

==Writing==
Wolff is widely known for his work in two genres: the short story and the memoir. His first short story collection, &quot;In the Garden of the North American Martyrs&quot;, was published in 1981. The collection was well received and several of its stories have since been published in a number of anthologies. Its publication coincided with a period in which several American authors who worked almost exclusively in the short story form were receiving wider recognition. As writers such as Wolff, Raymond Carver and Andre Dubus became better known, the United States was said to be having a renaissance of the short story. (Their 20th-century North American version of realism was often labelled as &quot;Dirty realism&quot; for its gritty veracity.)

Wolff repudiated this characterization. In 1994, in the introduction to &quot;The Vintage Book of Contemporary American Short Stories&quot;, he wrote:
Wolff&#x27;s 1984 novella &quot;The Barracks Thief&quot; won the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction for 1985. Most of the action takes place at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Three recent paratrooper training graduates are temporarily attached to an airborne infantry company as they await orders to report to Vietnam. Because most of the men in the company fought together in Vietnam, the three newcomers are treated as outsiders and ignored. When money and personal property are discovered missing from the barracks, suspicion falls on the three newcomers. The narrative structure of the book contains several shifts of tone and point of view as the story unfolds.

In 1985, Wolff&#x27;s second short story collection, &quot;Back in the World&quot;, was published. Several of the stories in this collection, such as &quot;The Missing Person,&quot; are significantly longer than the stories in his first collection.

Wolff chronicled his early life in two memoirs. &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; (1989), winner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Book Award for Biography, is devoted to the author&#x27;s adolescence in Seattle and Newhalem, a remote company town in the North Cascade mountains of Washington. The memoir describes the nomadic and uncertain life Wolff and his mother led after his parents divorced. His mother&#x27;s subsequent marriage to a man who was revealed as an abusive husband and stepfather deeply affected their lives. &quot;In Pharaoh&#x27;s Army&quot; (1994) records Wolff&#x27;s U.S. Army tour of duty in Vietnam.

He published a third collection of stories, &quot;The Night in Question&quot;, in 1997. His fourth short-story collection, &quot;Our Story Begins: New and Selected Stories&quot; (2008), includes both new and previously published stories.

Whether he is writing fiction or non-fiction, Wolff&#x27;s prose is characterized by an exploration of personal/biographical and existential terrain. As Wyatt Mason wrote in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Typically, his protagonists face an acute moral dilemma, unable to reconcile what they know to be true with what they feel to be true. Duplicity is their great failing, and Wolff&#x27;s main theme.&quot;

Elsewhere Wolff said of the personal nature of his work: &quot;I have to be able, with a straight face, to tell myself that something is nonfiction if I say it&#x27;s nonfiction. That&#x27;s why, although there are autobiographical elements in some of my stories, I still call them fiction because that&#x27;s what they are. Even though they may have been set into motion by some catalyst of memory.&quot;

In 1989, Wolff was chosen as recipient of the Rea Award for the Short Story. Wolff has received the O. Henry Award on three occasions, for the stories &quot;In the Garden of North American Martyrs&quot; (1981), &quot;Next Door&quot; (1982), and &quot;Sister&quot; (1985). In 2008, he was awarded The Story Prize for &quot;Our Story Begins&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Some of Wolff&#x27;s work has been adapted to film. &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life&quot; was adapted as a feature film directed by Michael Caton-Jones in 1993. It starred Leonardo DiCaprio as the teenage Wolff, Robert De Niro as Wolff&#x27;s abusive step-father Dwight, and Ellen Barkin as Wolff&#x27;s mother Rosemary.

In 2001, Wolff&#x27;s acclaimed short story &quot;Bullet in the Brain&quot; (from &quot;The Night in Question&quot;) was adapted as a short film by David Von Ancken and CJ Follini; it starred Tom Noonan and Dean Winters.

==Family==
Tobias Wolff&#x27;s older brother is the author Geoffrey Wolff. A decade before Tobias Wolff published &quot;This Boy&#x27;s Life,&quot; his brother wrote a memoir of his own about the boys&#x27; biological father, entitled &quot;The Duke of Deception&quot; (in which he alleges his younger brother was named after the Toby Jug). Wolff&#x27;s mother later settled in Washington, D.C. There she became president of the League of Women Voters.

Tobias Wolff is married and lives with his wife, Catherine Dolores Spohn, and three children in California.

<text>Franck is a small lunar impact crater that lies near the north end of Sinus Amoris, a bay on the northern part of Mare Tranquillitatis. Its diameter is 12 km. It was named after German physicist and Nobel laureate James Franck. The crater lies just to the southeast of Brewster, and farther to the south of Römer. Franck was previously designated Römer K.

This is a circular, bowl-shaped crater with a sharp rim that has not been significantly eroded. The interior walls slope down to the tiny floor at the midpoint. Just to the north of Franck is a joined pair of smaller craters, and the three nearly form a merged cluster of impacts.

<doc id="1270572" wikidata="Q493398" url="?curid=1270572" title="Khmer numerals">
<text>Khmer numerals ០ ១ ២ ៣ ៤ ៥ ៦ ៧ ៨ ៩ are the numerals used in the Khmer language. They have been in use since at least the early 7th century.

== Numerals ==

Having been derived from the Hindu numerals, modern Khmer numerals also represent a decimal positional notation system. It is the script with the first extant material evidence of zero as a numerical figure, dating its use back to the seventh century, two centuries before its certain use in India. Old Khmer, or Angkorian Khmer, also possessed separate symbols for the numbers 10, 20, and 100.

Each multiple of 20 or 100 would require an additional stroke over the character, so the number 47 was constructed using the 20 symbol with an additional upper stroke, followed by the symbol for number 7. This inconsistency with its decimal system suggests that spoken Angkorian Khmer used a vigesimal system.

As both Thai and Lao scripts are derived from Old Khmer, their modern forms still bear many resemblances to the latter, demonstrated in the following table:

== Modern Khmer numbers ==
The spoken names of modern Khmer numbers represent a biquinary system, with both base 5 and base 10 in use. For example, 6 () is formed from 5 () plus 1 ().
=== Numbers from 0 to 5 ===
With the exception of the number 0, which stems from Sanskrit, the etymology of the Khmer numbers from 1 to 5 is of proto-Austroasiatic origin.

* For details of the various alternative romanization systems, see Romanization of Khmer.
* Some authors may alternatively mark as the pronunciation for the word &quot;two&quot;, and either or for the word &quot;three&quot;.
* In neighbouring Thailand the number three is thought to bring good luck. However, in Cambodia, taking a picture with three people in it is considered bad luck, as it is believed that the person situated in the middle will die an early death.

==== Comparison to other Austroasiatic languages 1-5 ====
Whilst Vietnamese vocabulary is very Sinicized, the numbers 1-5 retain proto-Austroasiatic origins. 
=== Numbers from 6 to 20 ===
The numbers from 6 to 9 may be constructed by adding any number between 1 and 4 to the base number 5 (), so that 7 is literally constructed as 5 plus 2. Beyond that, Khmer uses a decimal base, so that 14 is constructed as 10 plus 4, rather than 2 times 5 plus 4; and 16 is constructed as 10+5+1.

Colloquially, compound numbers from eleven to nineteen may be formed using the word preceded by any number from one to nine, so that 15 is constructed as , instead of the standard .

* In constructions from 6 to 9 that use 5 as a base, may alternatively be pronounced ; giving , , , and . This is especially true in dialects which elide , but not necessarily restricted to them, as the pattern also follows Khmer&#x27;s minor syllable pattern.

=== Numbers from 30 to 90 ===
The modern Khmer numbers from 30 to 90 are as follows:

* The word , which appears in each of these numbers, can be dropped in informal or colloquial speech. For example, the number 81 can be expressed as instead of the full .

Historically speaking, Khmer borrowed the numbers from 30 to 90 from a southern Middle Chinese variety by way of a neighboring Tai language, most likely Thai. This is evidenced by the fact that the numbers in Khmer most closely resemble those of Thai, as well as the fact that the numbers cannot be deconstructed in Khmer. For instance, is not used on its own to mean &quot;four&quot; in Khmer and is not used on its own to mean &quot;ten&quot;, while they are in Thai (see Thai numerals). The table below shows how the words in Khmer compare to other nearby Tai and Sinitic languages.
* Words in parentheses indicate literary pronunciations, while words preceded by an asterisk only occur in specific constructions and are not used for basic numbers from 3 to 10.

Prior to using a decimal system and adopting these words, Khmer used a base 20 system, so that numbers greater than 20 were formed by multiplying or adding on to the cardinal number for twenty. Under this system, 30 would&#x27;ve been constructed as &quot;(20 × 1) + 10&quot; &quot;twenty-one ten&quot; and 80 was constructed as &quot;4 × 20&quot; &quot;four twenties / four scores&quot;. See the section Angkorian numbers for details.

=== Numbers from 100 to 10,000,000 ===

The standard Khmer numbers starting from one hundred are as follows:
Although is most commonly used to mean ten million, in some areas this is also colloquially used to refer to one billion (which is more properly ). In order to avoid confusion, sometimes is used to mean ten million, along with for one hundred million, and (&quot;one thousand million&quot;) to mean one billion.

Different Cambodian dialects may also employ different base number constructions to form greater numbers above one thousand. A few of the such can be observed in the following table:
=== Counting fruits ===
Reminiscent of the standard base 20 Angkorian Khmer numbers, the modern Khmer language also possesses separate words used to count fruits, not unlike how English uses words such as a &quot;dozen&quot; for counting items such as eggs.

=== Sanskrit and Pali influence ===
As a result of prolonged literary influence from both the Sanskrit and Pali languages, Khmer may occasionally use borrowed words for counting. Generally speaking, asides a few exceptions such as the numbers for 0 and 100 for which the Khmer language has no equivalent, they are more often restricted to literary, religious, and historical texts than they are used in day to day conversations. One reason for the decline of these numbers is that a Khmer nationalism movement, which emerged in the 1960s, attempted to remove all words of Sanskrit and Pali origin. The Khmer Rouge also attempted to cleanse the language by removing all words which were considered politically incorrect.

=== Ordinal numbers ===
Khmer ordinal numbers are formed by placing the word in front of a cardinal number. This is similar to the use of ที่ &quot;thi&quot; in Thai, and &quot;thứ&quot; (次) in Vietnamese.
== Angkorian numbers ==
It is generally assumed that the Angkorian and pre-Angkorian numbers also represented a dual base (quinquavigesimal) system, with both base 5 and base 20 in use. Unlike modern Khmer, the decimal system was highly limited, with both the numbers for &quot;ten&quot; and &quot;one hundred&quot; being borrowed from the Chinese and Sanskrit languages respectively. Angkorian Khmer also used Sanskrit numbers for recording dates, sometimes mixing them with Khmer originals, a practice which has persisted until the last century.

The numbers for twenty, forty, and four hundred may be followed by multiplying numbers, with additional digits added on at the end, so that 27 is constructed as twenty-one-seven, or 20×1+7.

== Proto-Khmer numbers ==
Proto-Khmer is the hypothetical ancestor of the modern Khmer language bearing various reflexes of the proposed proto-Mon–Khmer language. By comparing both modern Khmer and Angkorian Khmer numbers to those of other Eastern Mon–Khmer (or Khmero-Vietic) languages such as Pearic, Proto-Viet–Muong, Katuic, and Bahnaric; it is possible to establish the following reconstructions for Proto-Khmer.

=== Numbers from 5 to 10 ===
Contrary to later forms of the Khmer numbers, Proto-Khmer possessed a single decimal number system. The numbers from one to five correspond to both the modern Khmer language and the proposed Mon–Khmer language, while the numbers from six to nine do not possess any modern remnants, with the number ten *kraaj (or *kraay) corresponding to the modern number for one hundred. It is likely that the initial *k, found in the numbers from six to ten, is a prefix.

<text>Feuillée is a small lunar impact crater in the eastern part of the Mare Imbrium. It was named after French natural scientist Louis Feuillée. It lies less than a half crater diameter to the northwest of Beer, and the two formations form a nearly matched pair. To the west is the small but prominent crater Timocharis.

Like Beer, Feuillée is a circular, bowl-shaped formation with a small interior floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls. This sharp-edged crater is not notably worn or eroded, and lacks any distinguishing features. It does, however, lie across a wrinkle ridge in the surface of the lunar mare, a feature that is best observed under oblique lighting conditions when the crater is near the terminator.

The crater name is incorrectly spelled &quot;Feuillet&quot; on some lunar charts.

<doc id="1270577" wikidata="Q1326631" url="?curid=1270577" title="Kharraqan towers">
<text>The Kharraqan towers (as known as the Kharrakhan or Kharaghan towers; ) are a pair of mausolea built in 1067 and 1093, in the Kharraqan region of northern Iran, near Qazvin. They are notable for being an early example of geometric ornament, an early example of double domes, and one of the earlier tomb towers that appeared in the Seljuk era of medieval Iran during the 11th century.

The octagonal brick structures stand tall, and each side is wide. The surface of both mausolea demonstrate extensive use of geometry. The interior walls of the older mausoleum are decorated with paintings of various subjects. The eastern tower dates from 1067–68, and the western tower dates from 1093.

== Descriptions ==

=== Structure ===
Both mausolea have double shells for the domes; the inner shells are intact, but the outer shells on both towers are lost. There is no direct access to light through the windows on the outer and inner shells of the dome. However, the opposite positions of the window on the two shells allow indirect light into the first tower through the side window on the inner shell.

Both octagonal towers have 8 rounded buttresses - one per corner. Stronach and Young speculate there were vertical ribs for the demolished outer shell of the dome; however, they conclude from the lack of same ribs in the inner side that the ridges, accompanying the ribs, were decorative.

=== Exterior ===
Both towers have inscriptions of their architect on the exterior surface. Muhammad b. Makki al-Zanjani is inscribed on the earlier tower; Abu’l-Ma’ali b. Makki al-Zanjani, on the later tower. Stronach and Young indicate the two names refer to the same person—a local, unknown architect.

Also on the exterior of the buildings is an intricate geometric patterning formed of carved bricks. The brick also features lengthy inscriptions, both historical and Quranic. The historical inscription on the Eastern tower includes not only the architect, but also another name, possibly the mausoleum&#x27;s intended patron, which can only be partially read due to damage.

The Kufic inscription of Quranic text on the exterior walls of both towers, identically distributed across sides and buttresses, features Sura 59, verses 21-23, recognizable despite damage on buttresses. Samuel Stern asserts that these Suras are an unusual choice for mausolea, but points to the preceding verses as being more fitting. Parts of the inscriptions above the Western tower&#x27;s door can be recognized as Sura 23, Verse 115.

=== Interior ===
The eastern tower&#x27;s interior appears to have been fully decorated with frescoes, but only a few survive. There are paintings of mosque lamps in the niches, of pomegranate trees and peacocks in the piers alternating between them, and of a medallion surrounding peacocks and geometrical ornament near the top of the niches. There is also a band of Kufic calligraphy just below the beginning of the dome.

The western tower&#x27;s interior contains no plaster decoration; instead, there are a mihrab and additional brick ornament.

It is believed that the occupant of the eastern tower was Abu Sa&#x27;id Bijar and the occupant of the western tower was Abu Mansur Iltayti, according to Dr. Samuel Miklós Stern&#x27;s transliteration of the inscriptions on the towers.

== Interpretations ==
The Kharraqan towers exhibit more elaborate external design, individualized for each of the 8 sides, in comparison to other towers with more repetitive patterns. Oleg Grabar reminds that there is no concrete method of elucidating the meaning of the abstract, geometric decoration in Islamic architecture. Instead, the intricacy of the geometric pattern promotes appreciation of the visual design itself.

The subjects of wall paintings inside the western tower possess symbolic association with heaven. Abbas Daneshvari connects the light of the lamp with the light of the god, thus with paradise. Daneshvari further associates the interior paintings with paradise by emphasizing the iconographic role of peacocks, in sunburst medallions, as the bird of paradise. Peacocks appear in the Islamic medieval culture of Iran in literature and art objects such as textiles and ceramic wares.

==21st century==
Both towers were significantly damaged by the 2002 Bou&#x27;in-Zahra earthquake. They were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggesting it was one of the most powerful quakes in the region for approximately 900 years.

<text>Joseph Elmer Ritter (July 20, 1892 – June 10, 1967) was an American Catholic prelate who served as Archbishop of St. Louis from 1946 until his death in 1967. He was created a cardinal in 1961. He previously served as auxiliary bishop (1933–1934), bishop and later Archbishop of Indianapolis (1934–1946). Ritter was one of the cardinals elector who participated at the papal conclave in 1963.

Ritter is noted for ending racial discrimination in church schools in both of his archdioceses long before it became mandatory in the United States. He also ended hospital segregation in the Archdiocese of St. Louis and supported the education of African-American students.

==Early life and education==
Elmer Ritter was born on July 20, 1892, in New Albany, Indiana. He was the fourth of six children of Nicholas Ritter (1859–1944) and Bertha (née Luette) (1865–1941). His father owned the Ritter Bakery in New Albany (where the family also lived). Both parents were of German descent. According to a 1946 article in the &quot;St. Louis Star and Times&quot;.;&quot;It was one of those shops, now rare, in which the whole family, the mother, father and the whole family had to help, either in the store part, which was in the front, or in the bakery which was in the rear.&quot;Ritter said his father had a great reverence of education, saying, &quot;Dad gave us all a chance to go to college, but only if we applied ourselves.&quot; Ritter received his early education at the parochial school of St. Mary of the Annunciation Church in New Albany, where the students called him &quot;Apple-Pie Ritter&quot;.

===Religious calling===
During the seventh grade, Ritter decided to enter the priesthood. Ritter said &quot;There was no vision, no voice from heaven. I simply wanted to be a priest.&quot; In 1907, he enrolled at St. Meinrad&#x27;s Seminary in Saint Meinrad, Indiana, where he completed his studies in 1917.

==Priesthood==
Ritter was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of Indianapolis at St. Meinrad Seminary in the Abbey Church on May 30, 1917, by Bishop Joseph Chartrand.

After his 1917 ordination, the diocese assigned Ritter as a curate at St. Patrick Parish in Indianapolis. In 1920, they transferred him to Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral Parish in Indianapolis to serve as an assistant to Chartrand. In 1922, Ritter received an honorary doctorate of theology from Pope Pius XI. Ritter was named rector of the cathedral in 1925.

==Auxiliary Bishop of Indianapolis==
On February 3, 1933, Pius XI appointed Ritter as auxiliary bishop of Indianapolis and titular bishop of Hippos. He received his episcopal consecration on March 28, 1933, from Bishop Chartrand, with Bishops Alphonse Smith and Emmanuel Ledvina serving as co-consecrators.

As an auxiliary bishop, he also served as vicar general of the diocese from 1933 to 1934. At age 40, Ritter was one of the youngest Catholic bishops in the United States.

== Bishop of Indianapolis ==
Following Chartrand&#x27;s death, Pius XI appointed Ritter as the seventh bishop of Indianapolis on March 24, 1934.

In 1937, Ritter ordered the racial integration of three girls schools in the diocese. In reaction, the Ku Klux Klan in 1938 burned a cross in front of the cathedral rectory. Undaunted, Ritter in 1943 banned racial segregation in all Catholic schools in the diocese. Some community leaders threatened to sue the diocese; his decision was opposed by some clergy. The Klan paraded outside SS. Peter and Paul Cathedral in protest.

Ritter also reorganized the diocesan branch of Catholic Charities, introduced the Catholic Youth Organization to the diocese, and completed the construction of SS. Peter and Paul Cathedral. He reduced the diocesan debt by $3 million, .

In 1941, Ritter opened St. John&#x27;s Parish in Evansville, Indiana, the first African-American parish in that city.

== Archbishop of Indianapolis ==
The Diocese of Indianapolis was elevated to the status of an archdiocese by Pope Pius XII on October 21, 1944. Ritter was installed as its first archbishop on December 19, 1944.

==Archbishop of St. Louis==
Ritter was appointed the fourth archbishop of the Archdiocese of St. Louis by Pius XII on July 20, 1946, succeeding the late Cardinal John J. Glennon.

St. Louis grew quickly during the post-World War II economic boom. Ritter opened an average of three parishes per year in St. Louis city and county. Ritter raised more than $125,000,000 () to build sixty new parishes and sixteen high schools. He started fundraising for the Cardinal Glennon Memorial Hospital for Children in St. Louis in 1949.

Ritter also developed what is now known as the Annual Catholic Appeal, which remains a primary source of financial support for many archdiocesan educational and charitable activities.

In 1950, Ritter created 31 classrooms for special needs students in archdiocesan schools and two group homes.

Ritter in 1956 established a mission in La Paz, Bolivia, one of the first missions sponsored by an American diocese. Until that time, most Catholic missions had been run by religious institutes or societies of apostolic life. Parishioners in St. Louis regularly contributed more money to these foreign missions than any archdiocese of its size. Ritter served as president of the National Catholic Educational Association from 1955 to 1956, and was named an assistant at the pontifical throne on October 5, 1956.

===Desegregation efforts===
As one of his first acts as archbishop, Ritter announced that Webster College, a Catholic women&#x27;s college in Webster Groves, Missouri, would now accept African-American students. The Sisters of Loretto, who ran the college, had attempted to integrate it in 1945, but were blocked by Glennon. Ritter in 1947 also allowed the senior class of St. Joseph&#x27;s High School, then the city&#x27;s only African-American Catholic high school, to celebrate graduation for the first time at the Cathedral, alongside white students.

On August 9, 1947, Ritter announced an end to racial segregation in all five St. Louis diocesan high schools before the fall term. He declared, &quot;The cross on top of our schools must mean something,&quot; and expressed his belief in &quot;the equality of every soul before Almighty God&quot;.

A group of over 700 white Catholics from 49 St. Louis area parishes, calling themselves the &quot;Catholic Parents Association of Saint Louis and Saint Louis County&quot;, threatened to sue Ritter . The association claimed that Ritter&#x27;s order violated Missouri state law. Association Co-Chair William T. Rone said &quot;We do not want Negro children alongside our children in the schools.&quot; Ritter refused to meet with the association&#x27;s leaders; his spokesman said, &quot;He is the father of the whole flock and must care for all, regardless of race.&quot; Ritter then issued a pastoral letter, warning about possible excommunication for Catholics &quot;interfering with ecclesiastical office authority by having recourse to authority outside of the church&quot;.

After ruling out a lawsuit, the association did send a letter of protest to the apostolic delegate to the United States, Cardinal Amleto Giovanni Cicognani. Cicognani responded, &quot;I am confident that everyone will readily comply with what has been so clearly proposed by the ecclesiastical authority of the Archdiocese&quot;. Ritter later ordered all the parish schools to &quot;accept all children into parish schools without regard to race&quot;. These schools represented 25% of all students in the St. Louis area. Ritter also desegregated all Catholic hospitals in the archdiocese.

===Cardinal===
Ritter was created cardinal priest of &quot;SS. Redentore e S. Alfonso in Via Merulana&quot; by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of January 16, 1961.

Between 1962 and 1965, Ritter participated in all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council in Rome. Ritter was viewed as a liberal. He also protested against the Roman Curia&#x27;s oppressive actions and Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani&#x27;s draft on the sources of revelation at the Council.

Ritter in 1963 was &quot;dismayed&quot; and &quot;indignant&quot; after the rector of Catholic University of America, Monsignor William McDonald, refused to allow certain liberal theologians to speak at the university. On August 24, 1964, in line with reforms of the Second Vatican Council, Ritter celebrated the world&#x27;s first authorized mass in English at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis.

==Death, funeral and burial==
Ritter died on June 10, 1967, at DePaul Hospital in St. Louis after suffering two heart attacks that week. His body lay in state at the cathedral.

Ritter&#x27;s requiem mass was celebrated on June 15, 1967, at St. Louis Cathedral. At his request, it was a low funeral mass. Cardinal-designate John Cody was the main celebrant. In his sermon, Bishop Charles Helmsing spoke of Ritter&#x27;s liturgical leadership, particularly &quot;his concern for a liturgy of the Word that would truly inform and enlighten the people of God.&quot;

Ten archbishops, 48 bishops, and four abbots attended the mass. The prelates in attendance included Cardinals Richard Cushing, James Francis McIntyre, Lawrence Shehan, and Francis Spellman, along with Archbishops John Krol and Patrick O&#x27;Boyle. Fifty Protestant, Jewish, and Orthodox Christian leaders were present, representing the Episcopal Church, the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, the United Church of Christ, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Baptists, the Disciples of Christ, the Methodist Church, the Presbyterian Church, and the Salvation Army.

Ritter was buried in the priest&#x27;s lot at Calvary Cemetery in St. Louis, following his final wishes. On November 2, 1994, Archbishop Justin Rigali ordered Ritter&#x27;s remains to be removed from Calvary Cemetery and re-interred in the crypt of the new cathedral, now the cathedral basilica of St. Louis.

== Viewpoints ==

=== Ecumenism ===
In 1960, Ritter declared that Catholic students must obtain written permission from the archdiocese to attend secular or non-Catholic colleges. He was concerned about their exposure to secular influences and the doctrines of other religions.

In 1964, Ritter allowed a marriage ceremony that included both Catholic and Episcopal priests at St. Genevieve du Bois Catholic Church near St. Louis. It was the first such ceremony approved by a Catholic prelate in U.S.

=== Films ===
Ritter forbade Catholics from viewing the 1954 film &quot;The French Line&quot; under danger of committing serious sin. The film featured actor Jane Russell dancing in a scanty outfit in what was then considered a sexually-suggestive scene.

==Legacy==

*Ritter is commemorated by a wall mosaic work in the Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis. One side of the mosaic shows Ritter reaching out toward a group of people from other religions. The other side shows him reaching towards a multiracial group of school children.
*Ritter&#x27;s birthplace and childhood home in New Albany was saved from demolition in 2001 and later restored. It is now owned by the Cardinal Ritter Birthplace Foundation and is operated as a neighborhood center.
*Cardinal Ritter High School in Indianapolis is named in his honor.
*Cardinal Ritter College Prep High School in St. Louis is named in his honor.

==Honors==
* Honorary Doctorate of Theology from Pope Pius XI in 1922.
* Honorary Founder of Saint Louis University Award in 1961 from Saint Louis University &quot;in honor of his leadership and influence in the cause of education&quot;.
* Ecumenical Man of the Year Award in 1965 from the Metropolitan St. Louis Church Federation. However, Ritter declined the award, saying &quot;Grateful for the honor, I am united with you in efforts for Christian unity. But it is my practice to decline citations in line with what is obviously my duty&quot;.
* Honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Eden Theological Seminary in St. Louis in 1965.

<text>Fabbroni is a small lunar impact crater that lies along the northern edge of the Mare Tranquillitatis, at the eastern edge of the gap where the lunar mare joins Mare Serenitatis to the north. To the southeast is the crater Vitruvius.

Fabbroni is named after the Italian economist, chemist and naturalist Giovanni Fabbroni. It was previously designated Vitruvius E.

This is a circular crater with a conical interior formed by the inner walls gradually sloping down to the tiny floor at the midpoint. The northern rim of this crater lies along the southeastern flanks of the peak Mons Argaeus.

<text>Eckert is a tiny, isolated lunar impact crater in the northern part of the Mare Crisium (a circular region of relatively dark, flat material on the surface of the Moon). This crater forms a circular pit in the dark surface of the surrounding lunar mare. Just to the west is a wrinkle ridge in the mare surface, a feature that is prominent only under oblique lighting from the Sun. The nearest craters of note are Peirce to the west-northwest, and Picard to the southwest. Both of these craters lie in the Mare Crisium basin.

The crater is named for American astronomer Wallace John Eckert, and name was approved by the IAU in 1973.

<doc id="1270594" wikidata="Q1328733" url="?curid=1270594" title="Elger (crater)">
<text>Elger is a lunar impact crater that lies along the southern edge of Palus Epidemiarum, the Marsh of Epidemics, in the southwest part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. To the northeast is the flooded crater Capuanus, and farther to the northwest is Ramsden.

The crater is named after British astronomer Thomas Gwyn Elger.

The rim of this formation is rough and somewhat eroded formation, with a break and an outward bulge along the northern end, while a ridge intrudes into the southern rim. The interior has been resurfaced by lava, although the albedo of the floor is not quite as low as the lunar mare surface to the north.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Elger.

<doc id="1270609" wikidata="Q63694" url="?curid=1270609" title="Esclangon (crater)">
<text>Esclangon is a lunar impact crater that is located in the rugged terrain to the northwest of the prominent crater Macrobius, and east of Sinus Amoris. Its diameter is 15 km. It was named after French astronomer Ernest Esclangon. This formation was previously designated Macrobius L. Just to the west-southwest is the crater Hill. Lacus Bonitatis, the Lake of Good, is located to the east and northeast of Esclangon.

The interior of this crater has been flooded, leaving only a low rim above the surface being only about 400 meters deep. The rim is not quite circular, having bulges to the northeast and northwest, most likely the result of smaller craters that have merged with the main rim. The interior surface is level and nearly featureless.

<doc id="1270610" wikidata="Q1406824" url="?curid=1270610" title="William Henry Drayton">
<text>William Henry Drayton (September 1742 – September 3, 1779) was an American Founding Father, planter, and lawyer from Charleston, South Carolina. He served as a delegate for South Carolina to the Continental Congress in 1778-79 and signed the Articles of Confederation.

==Early life==
William Henry was born on his family&#x27;s plantation, Drayton Hall, on the bank of the Ashley River near Charleston. His father John Drayton had just completed construction of a massive main house on the rice plantation. His mother was Charlotta Bull Drayton, the daughter of the colony&#x27;s Governor William Bull. Drayton Hall would remain William&#x27;s home throughout his life.

In 1750, he was sent to England for his education. He first studied at Westminster School where he met Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. Then he went on to Balliol College, Oxford, before returning home in 1764. He read law and was admitted to the bar in South Carolina.

Drayton married Dorothy Golightly in 1764; they were the parents of South Carolina Governor John Drayton. He was the cousin of U.S. Representative William Drayton, the son of Judge William Drayton Sr.

==Career==
Drayton at first opposed the growing sense of colonial unity and resistance after the Stamp Act Congress but reversed his position as the Revolution grew nearer. He first wrote a series of published letters opposing the American actions. When they were published in England, he was made a member of the Colonial Council in 1772. Governor Bull appointed him to the Colony&#x27;s Court in 1774. However, later that year he wrote a pamphlet, the &quot;American Claim of Rights&quot;, which supported the call for a Continental Congress. Subsequently he was removed from all government positions, which completed his conversion to the Patriot cause.

He became a member of South Carolina&#x27;s Committee of safety in 1775 as well as the provisional Congress that functioned as the colony&#x27;s rebel government. In 1776, he and Arthur Middleton designed the Seal of South Carolina. When they began operating under an interim constitution in 1776, he returned to his seat on the council, serving as chief justice of state&#x27;s Supreme Court. When the South Carolina General Assembly unanimously voted for union with Georgia in 1776, Drayton became the chief champion of the proposal. The union was rejected by a Georgia convention on January 23, 1777, but Drayton continued to campaign in Georgia for union until Governor John A. Treutlen issued a reward for his arrest. In 1778, South Carolina sent Drayton as a delegate to the Continental Congress, where he gave strong support to the military, but he was no friend to the Natives: &quot;Cut up every Indian Cornfield and burn every Indian town,&quot; he proclaimed, so that their &quot;nation be extirpated and the lands become the property of the public.&quot;

==Death==
Drayton died of typhus on September 3, 1779 in Philadelphia, while serving in Congress. He was 37. His home, Drayton Hall, now lies within the expanded city of Charleston. It is operated as a museum and is open to the public for an admission fee.

<text>Dechen is a small, bowl-shaped crater that is located in the northwest part of the Oceanus Procellarum, near the northwest limb of the Moon. The rim of the crater projects slightly above the surrounding lunar mare, and the interior is symmetrical and nearly featureless. It lies to the northeast of the crater Harding, but is otherwise relatively isolated.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Dechen.

<text>Samuel Dickson Selvon (20 May 1923 – 16 April 1994) was a Trinidad-born writer, who moved to London, England, in 1950. His 1956 novel &quot;The Lonely Londoners&quot; is groundbreaking in its use of creolised English, or &quot;nation language&quot;, for narrative as well as dialogue.

==Life and work==
Samuel Dickson Selvon was born in San Fernando in the south of Trinidad, the sixth of seven children. His father was a first-generation Christian Tamil Indian immigrant from Madras and his mother was a Christian Anglo-Indian. His maternal grandfather was Scottish and his maternal grandmother was Indian. 

Selvon was educated at Naparima College, San Fernando, before leaving at the age of 15 to work. He was a wireless operator with the local branch of the Royal Naval Reserve from 1940 to 1945 during the Second World War. Thereafter, he moved north to Port of Spain, and from 1945 to 1950, worked for the &quot;Trinidad Guardian&quot; as a reporter and for a time on its literary page. In this period, he began writing stories and descriptive pieces, mostly under a variety of pseudonyms, including Michael Wentworth, Esses, Ack-Ack, and Big Buffer. Much of this early writing is to be found in &quot;Foreday Morning&quot; (eds Kenneth Ramchand and Susheila Nasta, 1989).

In 1950, Selvon moved to London, England, where he took menial jobs, eventually working as a clerk for the Indian Embassy, while writing in his spare time. His short stories and poetry appeared in various publications, including the &quot;London Magazine&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and &quot;The Nation&quot;. In London, he also worked with the BBC, producing two television scripts, &quot;Anansi the Spiderman&quot;, and &quot;Home Sweet India&quot;.

Selvon was a fellow in creative writing at the University of Dundee from 1975 until 1977. In the late 1970s, he moved to Alberta, Canada, and found a job teaching creative writing as a visiting professor at the University of Victoria. When that job ended, he took a job as a janitor at the University of Calgary in Alberta for a few months before becoming writer-in-residence there. He was largely ignored by the Canadian literary establishment, with his works receiving no reviews during his residency.

On a return trip to Trinidad, Selvon died of respiratory failure due to extensive bronchopneumonia and chronic lung disease on 16 April 1994 at Piarco International Airport; his ashes were subsequently interred at the University of the West Indies cemetery, St Augustine, Trinidad.

Selvon married twice: in 1947 to Draupadi Persaud, with whom he had one daughter, and in 1963 to Althea Daroux (deceased), with whom he had two sons and a daughter.

==Writing==
Selvon is best known for his novels &quot;The Lonely Londoners&quot; (1956) and &quot;Moses Ascending&quot; (1975). His novel &quot;A Brighter Sun&quot; (1952), detailing the construction of the Churchill-Roosevelt Highway in Trinidad through the eyes of young Indian worker Tiger, was a popular choice on the CXC English Literature syllabus for many years. Other notable works include the collection of stories &quot;Ways of Sunlight&quot; (1957), &quot;Turn Again Tiger&quot; (1958) and &quot;Those Who Eat the Cascadura&quot; (1972). During the 1960s and 1970s, Selvon converted several of his novels and stories into radio scripts, broadcast by the BBC, which were collected in &quot;Eldorado West One&quot; (Peepal Tree Press, 1988) and &quot;Highway in the Sun&quot; (Peepal Tree Press, 1991).

&quot;The Lonely Londoners&quot;, like most of Selvon&#x27;s later work, focuses on the migration of West Indians to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s, and tells, mostly in anecdotal form, the daily experience of settlers from Africa and the Caribbean. Selvon also illustrates the panoply of different subcultures that exist within London, as with any major city, due to class and racial boundaries. In many ways, his books are the precursors to works such as &quot;White Teeth&quot; (2000) by Zadie Smith and &quot;The Buddha of Suburbia&quot; (1990) by Hanif Kureishi. Selvon explained: 
&quot;When I wrote the novel that became &quot;The Lonely Londoners&quot;, I tried to recapture a certain quality in West Indian everyday life. I had in store a number of wonderful anecdotes and could put them into focus, but I had difficulty starting the novel in straight English. The people I wanted to describe were entertaining people indeed, but I could not really move. At that stage, I had written the narrative in English and most of the dialogues in dialect. Then I started both narrative and dialogue in dialect and the novel just shot along.&quot;In the late 1980s, Selvon wrote personal essays reflecting on his West Indian identity. These include &quot;Three into one can&#x27;t go – East Indian, Trinidadian or West Indian?&quot; (1986), in which Selvon reflects on the complexities of being of East Indian heritage, born and raised in Trinidad, and of West Indian identity. He also wrote &quot;Finding West Indian Identity in London&quot; (1987), in which he reflects on developing a West Indian consciousness after immigrating to London in 1950.

Selvon&#x27;s papers are now at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin, USA. These consist of holograph manuscripts, typescripts, book proofs, manuscript notebooks, and correspondence. Drafts for six of his 11 novels are present, along with supporting correspondence and items relating to his career.

==Awards and legacy==
Selvon was awarded two Guggenheim Fellowships (in 1955 and 1968), an honorary doctorate from Warwick University in 1989, and in 1985 the honorary degree of DLitt by the University of the West Indies. In 1969 he was awarded the Trinidad &amp; Tobago Hummingbird Medal Gold for Literature, and in 1994 he was (posthumously) given another national award, the Chaconia Medal Gold for Literature. In 2012 he was honoured with a NALIS Lifetime Achievement Literary Award for his contributions to Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s literature.

On what would have been his 95th birthday, 20 May 2018, Selvon was honoured with a Google Doodle.

<text>Dunthorne is a small lunar impact crater that is located to the northwest of the small lunar mare called Palus Epidemiarum, in the southwest part of the Moon&#x27;s near side. It was named after British astronomer Richard Dunthorne. It lies to the southwest of the crater Campanus, east of Vitello. Due south is Ramsden.

This crater is roughly circular and bowl-shaped, with an interior that has a higher albedo than the surrounding terrain. It lies in a region that has a number of rille systems, with the Rimae Hippalus to the northwest, and the Rimae Ramsden to the south and east.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Dunthorne.

<text>Ebergötzen is a village in the District of Göttingen in Germany in Lower Saxony. It is 15 km from Göttingen and belongs to the Samtgemeinde Radolfshausen. Ebergötzen has 1,927 inhabitants (December 2020).

Ebergötzen has achieved some fame as being the place where Wilhelm Busch, author of the &quot;Max und Moritz&quot; stories that make many consider him the &quot;Father of the Comic Strip&quot;, spent large parts of his childhood. Wilhelm Busch lived there from 1841 to 1846, staying with his uncle Georg Kleine, the pastor of Ebergötzen. He had a friendship with the miller&#x27;s son and neighbour, Erich Bachmann, and it is speculated that the tricks and experiences of the two boys are portrayed in &quot;Max and Moritz&quot;.

Ebergötzen is home to two tourist attractions, the Wilhelm Busch Museum, and the European Bread Museum.

<text>Daubrée is a lunar impact crater that is located to the southwest of the Mare Serenitatis, just to the west-southwest of the crater Menelaus in the Montes Haemus range. The small lunar mare Lacus Hiemalis lies along the southwest rim of Daubrée. The crater was named after French geologist Gabriel A. Daubrée. It was previously designated Menelaus S.

This is a horseshoe-shaped formation with the rim open to the northwest. The interior has been flooded by basaltic lava, leaving a level, featureless floor. The rim has a low cut through the southern end, and the eastern rim is attached to low ridges belonging to the Montes Haemus.

<doc id="1270630" wikidata="Q654812" url="?curid=1270630" title="Mariahilf">
<text>Mariahilf (; ; &quot;Mary&#x27;s help&quot;) is the 6th municipal district of Vienna, Austria (). It is near the center of Vienna and was established as a district in 1850. Mariahilf is a heavily populated urban area with many residential buildings.
It has a population of 31,621 (as of 2016-01-01) within an area of .

== Location==
Mariahilf is located southwest of Vienna&#x27;s centre (1st district). In the north, Mariahilfer Straße, Vienna&#x27;s most important shopping street, is its border with Neubau, in the south, the valley of the Vienna River, in the west, the Gürtel beltway.

It consists of the five neighbourhoods (historical &quot;Vorstädte&quot;, i.e. towns): Mariahilf, Gumpendorf, Windmühle, Magdalenengrund and Laimgrube.

== History ==
First settlements around the Roman roads of the area developed around the year 1000. In 1428, the name &quot;Im Schöff&quot; is mentioned for the first time, but this name was lost when the copy of a sacral painting from Passau was installed in a chapel of the graveyard, which came to be known as &quot;Mariahilf&quot; (&quot;Mary&#x27;s help&quot;).

More intensive settlement started only after the Second Turkish Siege of Vienna in 1683. The area was of some importance because the road to Schönbrunn Palace led through it.

&quot;Gumpendorf&quot; was mentioned in 1130 for the first time and developed from a Roman watchtower. It was subject to various feudal lords and was sold to the municipality of Vienna in 1798.

&quot;Magdalenengrund&quot; was originally known as &quot;Im Saugraben an der Wien auf der Gstätten&quot; (&quot;In the sow pit on the Wien on the meadow&quot;) and consisted only of vineyards. In 1698, some plots were released for construction.

The &quot;Laimgrube&quot; (clay pit) is probably the oldest part of Mariahilf. It was mentioned in 1291 for the first time, but has existed already since the 11th century. Its name is derived from the clay soil, which was used to produce bricks.

&quot;Windmühle&quot; (windmill) developed from a feudal holding used by various monastic orders. In 1529 it was destroyed during the First Turkish Siege. Emperor Ferdinand I had the ownership transferred to &quot;Johann Francolin&quot;, subject to the condition that he should build windmills there. However, he had only one mill built.

On March 6, 1850, the five &quot;Vorstädte&quot; of Gumpendorf, Mariahilf, Windmühle, Magdalenengrund and Laimgrube became part of Vienna as the Fifth District, Mariahilf. When Wieden was split into two districts in 1861, it became the 6th District. In 1862, some areas north of Mariahilfer Straße were ceded to the 7th District (Neubau).

Towards the end of the 19th century, Mariahilf had developed to become an important business district of Vienna. The Mariahilfer Strasse was a major shopping street; however, the big department stores were beyond the district boundary, over in the 7th District. The Mariahilfer area influenced the roads for mainly small and medium-sized businesses.

Between 1890 and 1907, the Kaunitzgasse steam power plant became one of the first electricity works in Vienna. Following the acquisition of the originally privately operated power plant, by the municipality of Vienna, it was decommissioned and converted into a substation.

&quot;Erinnern für die Zukunft&quot; (Remembrance for the Future) is a memorial project for the many residents of Mariahilf district who were murdered by the Nazi dictatorship in the 1938-1945 period.

Mariahilf is home to many of Vienna&#x27;s gay and lesbian residents and contains a sizable concentration of bars, clubs, restaurants and shops catering to the community, along with the Rosa Lila Villa community center.

In the 1990s, there were two minor changes in the district boundaries: in 1995 in the area of the belt on the border at the 15th District, and 1996 in the Europe Square in front of the West Railway Station, where the 6th, 7th and 15th District meet. Both border changes affected mainly the transport structures. The district affiliation of residential areas did not change.

== Population ==
The Mariahilf District was already, after its 1850 founding, very densely populated. In 1869, the district area had 67,642 inhabitants, a figure that was never surpassed. Until the beginning of the First World War, the population declined only slightly and remained largely stable. After the First World War began, the population almost continuously decreased. However, according to the last census in 2001, the population has largely stabilized and since 2006 has even risen slightly to 29,523 people.

=== Population structure ===
The age of people in Mariahilf, in 2001, differed in several ways from the Vienna citywide averages. So, Mariahilf had fewer children, but more young adults than the average for Vienna. In 2001, the proportion of residents under 15 years was, with 12.4%, below the Vienna value of 14.7%. The population aged 20 to 39 years in Mariahilf was, with 34.4%, more than the Vienna-average of 30.9%. The proportion of the population aged 60 years or more was 19.2%, slightly below the Vienna average (21.7%). The gender distribution in the district area corresponded to the community trend, with 47.1% men and 52.9% women. Mariahilf&#x27;s 35.8% compared, against Vienna&#x27;s city average of 41.2%, as much less often married than the average for Vienna.

=== Origin and language ===
The proportion of foreign-district residents in 2005 was 19.6% (Vienna citywide: 18.7%), and increased over 2001 (17.8%), along with the rising trend in the entire State. The highest proportion of foreigners, in 2005, represented approximately a 3.6% share of the district population as nationals from Serbia and Montenegro. Another 2.4% were Angolan, 1.5% Turkish, 1.3% Polish and 0.8% had Croatian or Bosnian citizenship. In total, for 2001, nearly 26.6% of the population of Mariahilf had not been born in Austria. About 5.6% expressed as a colloquial language Serbian, with Turkish 3.5% and 2.3% Croatian.

=== Religious preferences ===
The religion of the people in Mariahilf, during the 2001 census, ranked about average for Vienna, only the proportion of people with Roman Catholic or Islamic religion was slightly below average. In 2001, 47.4% of the inhabitants had membership in the Roman Catholic Church (Vienna citywide: 49.2%). There are three district Roman Catholic parishes, with the City Deanery 6 / 7. About 6.4% of residents were Islamic faith, 6.0% belonged to the Orthodox Church, and 5.2% were Protestant. Nearly 26.8% of the district population did not belong to any religious group, and 8.2% had no religion or other religious preference indicated.

== Politics ==

The Mariahilf district has always been contested between the political parties ÖVP and SPÖ. While the ÖVP commanded the majority in the years after the Second World War until 1969, it lost the district to the SPÖ in that year. After the SPÖ lost the majority again in 1978, the ÖVP was able to dominate the following elections.

When the Greens entered the district politics in the late 80s, the ÖVP and SPÖ started to rapidly lose votes. The competition with the Liberal Forum (LIF) in 1996 had a similar effect. The ÖVP also lost heavily in the elections of 2001. The SPÖ, after the losses of 1996, was able to compensate for its former losses and reclaimed the majority in the district.

In 2001 the Greens came in a close third to the ÖVP, whereas the Liberal Forum and the FPÖ suffered heavy losses. In the 2005 elections, the trend continued: The FPÖ lost heavily in the vote again and the Liberal Forum lost their seat on the district council, whereas the SPÖ and the Greens gained more votes. In 2005 the Greens came in second for the first time and thus attained the office of deputy district director. In the elections of 2010, the Greens and the ÖVP suffered heavy losses, while the SPÖ, FPÖ and BZÖ gained more votes.

== Education ==
Beside some buildings of the Vienna University of Technology, Mariahilf hosts the Franz Schubert Conservatory and the central vocational schools for electrical engineering, information technology, metallurgy, glass-ceramic, sanitary engineering, heating engineering and air conditioning technology.

== Coat of arms ==

The district&#x27;s arms combine those of the five independent communities from which it was formed in 1850:

* The inescutcheon (for Mariahilf) shows Don John of Austria standing in a ship flying the imperial banner. His victory over the Turks in the naval battle of Lepanto was attributed to the help of the Virgin Mary
* The first quarter (for Laimgrube) shows Saint Theobald in monastic garb before an altar; to his left stands a church. These arms go back to a chapel which was dedicated to St Theobald in 1621
* The second quarter (for Windmühle) also shows Saint Theobald, but as a bishop, with a church to his right
* The third quarter (for Magdalenengrund) shows the district&#x27;s namesake Mary Magdelene kneeling before the cross
* The fourth quarter (for Gumpendorf) shows three fleurs-de-lys on a &quot;chapé ployé&quot; field. These were the arms of the Muschinger family, who were lords of Gumpendorf in the 16th century

=== Theatres ===
The Theater an der Wien, on Wienzeile, was built in 1801 and is now one of the composite of the United Stages Vienna. Ludwig van Beethoven lived between 1803 and 1804 part-time in the building, where today a memorial room is dedicated. On Wallgasse street at the other end of the district, is the Raimund Theater, named after Ferdinand Raimund. The house, in the mid-1980s, belonged like the Theater an der Wien to the United Stages Vienna, and it is the venue for musicals. In addition to these two stages, there are smaller theaters, like the TAG, Theater an der Gumpendorferstraße, and the Theater Brett.

=== Museums ===
The District Museum of Mariahilf, on Mollardgasse street, is dedicated to, inter alia, focusing Ratzenstadl (Magdalenengrund), Theater an der Wien, and the Palais Kaunitz-Esterhazy. In the same house is also the Phonographic Vienna Museum, which deals with the history of the phonograph, also as the Glass Museum Mariahilf. A former flak tower is home to the &quot;Haus des Meeres&quot; (&quot;house of the sea&quot;), whose biggest attractions of the 2007 opening, included a 300,000 liter shark tank.

On Haydngasse street is located the Haydn-House of the composer Joseph Haydn, acquired in 1793 and inhabited until his death in 1809. Today, the house is a branch of the Vienna Museum. Other museums in Mariahilf are the &quot;Kaffeemuseum&quot; (coffee museum) with numerous exhibits on the topic of coffee, and the &quot;Sanitärhistorische Museum&quot; (Sanitary Historical Museum).

<doc id="1270631" wikidata="Q899597" url="?curid=1270631" title="Methoxy group">
<text>In organic chemistry, a methoxy group is the functional group consisting of a methyl group bound to oxygen. This alkoxy group has the formula .

On a benzene ring, the Hammett equation classifies a methoxy substituent at the &quot;para&quot; position as an electron-donating group, but as an electron-withdrawing group if at the &quot;meta&quot; position. At the &quot;ortho&quot; position, steric effects are likely to cause a significant alteration in the Hammett equation prediction which otherwise follows the same trend as that of the &quot;para&quot; position.

==Occurrence==
The simplest of methoxy compounds are methanol and dimethyl ether. Other methoxy ethers include anisole and vanillin. Many metal alkoxides contain methoxy groups, such as tetramethyl orthosilicate and titanium methoxide. Esters with a methoxy group can be referred to as methyl esters, and the —COOCH3 substituent is called a methoxycarbonyl.

===Biosynthesis===
In nature, methoxy groups are found on nucleosides that have been subjected to 2′-&quot;O&quot;-methylation, for example in variations of the 5′-cap structure known as cap-1 and cap-2. They are also common substituents in &quot;O&quot;-methylated flavonoids, whose formation is catalyzed by O-methyltransferases that act on phenols, such as catechol-&quot;O&quot;-methyl transferase (COMT). Many natural products in plants, such as lignins, are generated via catalysis by caffeoyl-CoA &quot;O&quot;-methyltransferase.

===Methoxylation===
Organic methoxides are often produced by methylation of alkoxides. Some aryl methoxides can be synthesized by metal-catalyzed methylation of phenols, or by methoxylation of aryl halides.

<doc id="1270633" wikidata="Q1751887" url="?curid=1270633" title="Warsaw dialect">
<text>The Warsaw subdialect ( ), or Warsaw dialect (), is a regional subdialect of the Masovian dialect of the Polish language, centered on the city of Warsaw. It evolved as late as the 18th century, under notable influence of several languages spoken in the city. After the destruction of Warsaw in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 the subdialect has been in decline. It is estimated that in modern times it is almost extinct as the native language and is preserved mostly in literary works.

==Classification==
The Warsaw dialect is composed mostly of the Polish language substratum, with notable (mostly lexical) influences from the Masovian dialect of Polish, as well as Russian, German, Yiddish and other languages.

The dialect was composed of a variety of different class dialects: the language of the suburbs differed from the language of the city centre and each professional group used its own version of the dialect, slightly different from the others. It is therefore difficult to state the exact classification.

==Geographic distribution==
The dialect was originally spoken in and around Warsaw, Poland. After 1944 it became dispersed as most of the inhabitants of Warsaw were either killed in the Warsaw Uprising or resettled in other parts of Poland. Currently it is almost completely extinct as a primary language and is mostly used by authors and artists for stylisation in literature, poetry and songwriting.

==History==
The Warsaw dialect became a separate dialect of the Polish language some time in the 18th century, when the Polish substratum was enriched with many borrowed words from the Masovian dialect. The mixture was then heavily influenced by the languages spoken by the burghers of Warsaw and the royal court of Poland. These included the Italian, Yiddish, French, Latin and English. In the 19th century during the Partitions of Poland the dialect incorporated a great number of borrowed words from German and then Russian.

Until World War II the language spoken by different classes and professions of Warsaw evolved independently, although were eventually mixed and interlinked. After the Warsaw Uprising, when the majority of its speakers were either killed or expelled and resettled in other parts of the world, the dialect became separated from its geographical roots and its users dispersed. After the war only a small number of pre-war Varsavians returned there while the vast majority of the inhabitants of the city came from other parts of Poland. Because of that, the language spoken in Warsaw became heavily influenced by other dialects of the Polish language. The only boroughs of Warsaw where the dialect was preserved to some extent were Praga and Wola.

Since the 1960s the uniformisation of the language spoken throughout Poland under the influence of the mass media (such as the television and radio) lead to a rapid decline in speakers of all the dialects of Polish, the Warsaw dialect included.

Among the notable artists who used the Warsaw dialect in their books, songs and poems are Hanka Bielicka, Wiktor Gomulicki, Stanisław Grzesiuk, Alina Janowska, Irena Kwiatkowska, Zygmunt Staszczyk, Stanisław Staszewski, Jarema Stępowski, Stefan Wiechecki and Stasiek Wielanek. The most extensive studies of the Warsaw dialect were carried out by Bronisław Wieczorkiewicz in his book &quot;Gwara warszawska wczoraj i dziś&quot; (&quot;The Warsaw Dialect Yesterday and Today&quot;).

===Sub-dialects===
As mentioned above, the Warsaw dialect was further divided onto several sub-dialects. Those included:
* Sub-dialects of different boroughs – for instance the language of Praga, Wola, Powiśle
* Professional sub-dialects – for instance the language of cabmen, shopkeepers, printers or policemen
* Sub-dialects of criminals – a regional version of grypsera
* Jewish sub-dialect – a regional version of the Yiddish language, largely influenced by the Polish language

All of the above sub-dialects were constantly mixing with each other and the lexical basis of most of them was similar.

===Derived dialects===
Due to the large number of prisons in Warsaw, the influence of the Warsaw dialect on the evolution of grypsera was immense and to some extent the shape of the latter language is a distant relative of the former.

==Phonology==
The basic phonology of the Warsaw dialect was that of the standard Polish language, with several notable differences.

The most important differences between literary Polish and the Warsaw dialect are the following:


==Vocabulary==
The Warsaw dialect has much of its lexicon borrowed from a variety of languages.

==Writing system==
The Warsaw dialect did not develop a literary form. It has been used by several authors in Polish literature and written with a standard set of Polish letters with different sounds denoted by approximation.

<doc id="1270638" wikidata="Q7259864" url="?curid=1270638" title="Pumpsie Green">
<text>Elijah Jerry &quot;Pumpsie&quot; Green (October 27, 1933 – July 17, 2019) was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) infielder who played with the Boston Red Sox (1959–62) and New York Mets (1963). A switch-hitter who threw right-handed, he was listed as tall and .

Green had the distinction of being the first black player to play for the Red Sox, the last pre-expansion major-league club to integrate. In his Boston tenure, he was used mostly as a pinch runner or day-off replacement for infielders Pete Runnels and Don Buddin. Green made his debut on July 21, 1959, pinch-running in a 2–1 loss against the Chicago White Sox.

==Early life==
Green was born in Boley, Oklahoma, the eldest of five children. One brother, Cornell Green, was a long-time safety for the Dallas Cowboys. Another brother, Credell Green, played football at the University of Washington and was drafted by the Green Bay Packers.

Green was named Elijah, after his father, but his mother called him &quot;Pumpsie&quot; from an early age, although Green related that he did not know the origin of the name. Green grew up in Richmond, California, and was a three-sport athlete at El Cerrito High School.

Since major-league baseball had not yet expanded to the West Coast, Green grew up a fan of the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. Green later stated that he may have been even better at basketball, but chose to play baseball when he was offered a baseball scholarship at Fresno State University. However, Green decided to attend Contra Costa College when Gene Corr, his high school baseball coach, became the baseball coach there and promised Green he would play shortstop if he attended. In Green&#x27;s final year of college, he tried out for the Oaks, and was signed to a contract.

==Minor league career==
In 1954, Green batted .297 in his second season with the Wenatchee Chiefs, an affiliate of the Oaks. In 1955, he was promoted to the Stockton Ports, the Oaks&#x27; top affiliate. Green&#x27;s contract was purchased by the Boston Red Sox during the 1955 season, but he was allowed to finish the season with Stockton before playing the 1956 season with the Albany Senators, a Red Sox affiliate. Green spent the 1957 season with the Oklahoma City Indians and San Francisco Seals, and the 1958 season with the Minneapolis Millers.

In 1959, Green was invited to the Red Sox&#x27;s major league spring training camp. Despite playing well and receiving much media attention, Green was sent back to Minneapolis. However, after hitting .320 through 98 games, he was promoted to the major league Red Sox.

==Major league career==
Green made his MLB debut on July 21, 1959, against the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park, entering the game in the top of the eighth as a pinch runner for Vic Wertz and playing shortstop in the bottom of the eighth and becoming the Red Sox&#x27;s first black player. He started the next day at second base, batting second and going 0-for-3. His first MLB hit came in his fourth game, on July 28 in Cleveland when he singled off of Jim Perry. That same day, pitcher Earl Wilson made his MLB debut, becoming the Red Sox&#x27; second black player. Green&#x27;s first at bat at Fenway Park was on August 4 against the Kansas City Athletics; he hit a triple off the Green Monster. Green played 50 games for the 1959 Red Sox, batting .233 and playing second base almost exclusively.

Green enjoyed a much more full-time role in 1960, playing 133 games, 69 at second base, and 41 at shortstop; he batted for a .242 average.

Green may have had his best season in 1961, posting career highs in home runs (6), RBI (27), doubles (12), and stolen bases (4); however, he also had the most errors of his career in 1961, with 16. Despite a hot start to the season, Green developed appendicitis in Washington, D.C. in May, which put him out of the lineup for about four weeks and kept him from playing at full strength for even longer.

In 1962, after a weekend of humiliating losses to the New York Yankees, Green along with Gene Conley got off the bus in the middle of a traffic jam in the Bronx to find a restroom, with the bus driver subsequently driving away without the players on board. Conley was not spotted until three days later by a &quot;New York Post&quot; sports reporter at the Idlewild International Airport trying to board a plane for Israel, with no passports or luggage.

After the 1962 season, Green was traded to the New York Mets along with Tracy Stallard and Al Moran in exchange for Felix Mantilla. Green played the majority of the 1963 season with the Buffalo Bisons but also played 17 games with the Mets. He played his final major league game with the Mets on September 26, 1963. Green played two more seasons in the minor leagues before retiring after the 1965 season. In a five-season major league career, Green was a .246 hitter with 13 home runs and 74 RBI in 344 games. His 196 career hits also included 31 doubles and 12 triples.

==After baseball==

Following his retirement from playing baseball, Green worked at Berkeley High School in Berkeley, California for over 20 years, serving as a truant officer, coaching baseball and teaching math in summer school. Green lived in El Cerrito, California, since seven years after his retirement from baseball. He was married to Marie for over 50 years.

On April 17, 2009, Green was honored by the Red Sox in a first-pitch ceremony, in recognition of 50 years since his breaking of the Red Sox color barrier. In February 2012, Green was honored by the city of El Cerrito, and presented with a proclamation honoring his &quot;distinguished stature in baseball history.&quot; In April 2012, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Jackie Robinson day at Fenway Park, and also attended Fenway&#x27;s 100th anniversary celebrations later that month.

On July 17, 2019, Green died at the age of 85. No cause was given.

<doc id="1270643" wikidata="Q1771680" url="?curid=1270643" title="Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese">
<text>Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is a Grade II listed public house at 145 Fleet Street, on Wine Office Court, City of London. Rebuilt shortly after the Great Fire of 1666, the pub is known for its literary associations, with its regular patrons having included Charles Dickens, G. K. Chesterton and Mark Twain.

The pub is on the Campaign for Real Ale&#x27;s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.

==Age==

Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese is one of a number of pubs in London to have been rebuilt shortly after the Great Fire of 1666. There has been a pub at this location since 1538. While there are several older pubs which have survived because they were beyond the reach of the fire, or like The Tipperary on the opposite side of Fleet Street because they were made of stone, this pub continues to attract interest due to the lack of natural lighting inside.

Some of the interior wood panelling is nineteenth century, some older, perhaps original. The vaulted cellars are thought to belong to a 13th-century Carmelite monastery which once occupied the site. The entrance to this pub is situated in a narrow alleyway and is very unassuming, yet once inside visitors will realise that the pub occupies a lot of floor space and has numerous bars and gloomy rooms. In winter, open fireplaces are used to keep the interior warm. In the bar room are posted plaques showing famous people who were regulars.

The pub is currently owned and operated by the Samuel Smith Old Brewery.

==Literary associations==

The literary figures: Oliver Goldsmith, Mark Twain, Alfred Tennyson, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, G.K. Chesterton, P. G. Wodehouse and Samuel Johnson are all said to have been &#x27;regulars&#x27;. However, there is no recorded evidence that Johnson ever visited the pub, only that he lived close by, at 17 Gough Square. At The Johnson Club supper, 13 December 1892, &#x27;an eloquent gentleman, present, an Irish former MP, pointed out that when Johnson acted on his suggestion &quot;let us take a walk down Fleet Street&quot; the Cheshire Cheese must of necessity have been included among his places of call.&#x27;

A 1680 broadside ballad called &quot;A New Ballad of the Midwives Ghost&quot; tells a fantastical story of how a midwife haunted the house where she died until she was able to induce the new residents there to dig up the bones of some bastard children she had made away with and buried there. The final lines of the ballad insist upon the veracity of the tale and even that the children&#x27;s bones may be seen for proof displayed at the Cheshire Cheese.

Charles Dickens had been known to use the establishment frequently, and it is alluded to in his &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;: following Charles Darnay’s acquittal on charges of high treason, Sydney Carton invites him to dine, &quot;drawing his arm through his own&quot; Carton leads him to Fleet Street &quot;up a covered way, into a tavern … where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine&quot;. R. L. Stevenson mentions the Cheese in &quot;The Dynamiter&quot; (1885), &#x27;a select society at the Cheshire Cheese engaged my evenings.&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; was in part the inspiration for the American children&#x27;s book &quot;The Cheshire Cheese Cat&quot; by Carmen Agra Deedy, Randall Wright and Barry Moser, which is set in the pub.

The Cheshire Cheese pub appears in Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;Ralph the Heir&quot;, where one of the characters, Ontario Moggs, is described as speaking &quot;with vigor at the debating club at the Cheshire Cheese in support of unions and the rights of man...&quot;

Wodehouse, though so many of his characters were members of posh London clubs, often preferred the homey intimacy of the pub. In a letter to a friend he wrote, &quot;Yesterday, I looked in at the Garrick at lunchtime, took one glance of loathing at the mob, and went off to lunch by myself at the Cheshire Cheese.&quot; The pub is mentioned by name in some of his books as well.

The Rhymers&#x27; Club was a group of London-based poets, founded in 1890 by W. B. Yeats and Ernest Rhys. Originally not much more than a dining club, it produced anthologies of poetry in 1892 and 1894. They met at the Cheshire Cheese and in the &#x27;Domino Room&#x27; of the Café Royal.

R. Austin Freeman in his 1913 novel &quot;The Mystery of 31 New Inn&quot; describes a luncheon at the pub in some detail, including mention of the beef-steak pudding and &#x27;the friendly portrait of the &quot;great lexicographer&quot; [Johnson] that beamed down...from the wall&#x27;.

According to the Betty Crocker cookbook, both Dickens and Ben Jonson dined on Welsh rarebit at this pub, although Jonson died almost a century before the dish is first known to have been recorded.

Soviet writer Boris Pilnyak visited the pub during his stay in London in 1923. He later wrote a story entitled &quot;Staryi syr,&quot; (&quot;old cheese&quot; in Russian) a part of which takes place in the Cheshire Cheese Pub. There is a chapter devoted to the Cheshire Cheese and the &#x27;Companions of the Cheshire Cheese&#x27; (W. B. Yeats&#x27; poem &quot;The Grey Rock&quot; 1914) in &quot;That Irishman: The Life and Times of John O&#x27;Connor Power&quot; by Jane Stanford.

Agatha Christie wrote that her fictional detective Hercule Poirot dined with a new client at the Cheshire Cheese in her 1924 story &quot;The Million Dollar Bond Robbery&quot;, adding a description of &quot;the excellent steak and kidney pudding of the establishment.&quot;
The founding meeting of the Medical Journalists&#x27; Association took place at the &#x27;Cheese&#x27; on 1 February 1967. At that time, health journalism was in its infancy, and medical doctors who wrote articles under their own name could be reported to the General Medical Council. From an initial membership of 48, the MJA now represents around 500 journalists, broadcasters and editors.

Alexander Theroux&#x27;s story &quot;An English Railroad&quot; is set in the Cheshire Cheese.

For around 40 years, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese was associated with a grey parrot named Polly. On its death in 1926 around 200 newspapers across the world wrote obituaries, while the news was read out on radio station 2LO.

In 1962, the pub gave the Museum of London a number of sexually explicit erotic plaster of Paris tiles recovered from an upper room. These tiles strongly suggest that the room was used as a brothel in the mid-eighteenth century.

<text>Michael Lupica (; born May 11, 1952) is an author and former American newspaper columnist, best known for his provocative commentary on sports in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; and his appearances on ESPN.

== Biography ==
Lupica was born in Oneida, New York, where he spent his pre-adolescent years, having attended St. Patrick&#x27;s Elementary School through the sixth grade. In 1964, he moved with his family to Nashua, New Hampshire, where he attended middle school and subsequently Bishop Guertin High School, graduating in 1970. In 1974 he graduated from Boston College. He first came to prominence as a sportswriter in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. Lupica wrote &quot;The Sporting Life&quot; column at &quot;Esquire magazine&quot; for ten years beginning in the late 1980s, and currently writes a regular column for &quot;Travel + Leisure Golf&quot;. He has also written for &quot;Golf Digest&quot;, &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;ESPN The Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Men’s Journal&quot;, and has received numerous awards including, in 2003, the Jim Murray Award from the National Football Foundation.

=== &quot;C&quot;olumnist ===
Lupica began working for the New York Daily News in 1977 and spent the majority of his career as a columnist there, except for brief stints with Newsday and The National Sports Daily. He wrote several sports columns during the week for the &quot;Daily News&quot;, as well as a signature Sunday column, &quot;Shooting from the Lip,&quot; which featured a traditional column followed by a series of short, acerbic observations from the week in sports. Later in his career he began writing a regular political column entitled &quot;Mondays with Mike,&quot; which is strongly liberal in orientation. He left the &quot;Daily News&quot; in July 2018.

Favorite Lupica targets included the New York Yankees (and will often state their massive payroll in most of his articles), James L. Dolan, Isiah Thomas, Notre Dame football, Rudy Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg, former President George W. Bush, and former Vice President Dick Cheney. Lupica has also been a harsh critic of the new Yankee Stadium and was a vehement opponent of the proposed West Side Stadium. He has likewise been highly critical of the Atlantic Yards project and the attendant construction of the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

=== Author ===
Lupica co-wrote autobiographies with Reggie Jackson and Bill Parcells and collaborated with screenwriter William Goldman on the nonfiction book &quot;Wait Till Next Year.&quot; Lupica also wrote the books &quot;Mad as Hell: How Sports Got Away From the Fans&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;How We Get It Back&quot; and &quot;Summer of ’98: When Homers Flew, Records Fell, and Baseball Reclaimed America&quot;, which detailed how the 1998 and the Mark McGwire/Sammy Sosa home run chase had allowed him to share a love for baseball with his son. Lupica has been listed a vocal critic of the steroid era.

Lupica is also a novelist; his work includes mysteries involving fictional NYC television reporter Peter Finley. One of them, &quot;Dead Air&quot;, was nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best First Mystery and the 1987 Anthony Award in the same category; and was also adapted into a television movie called &quot;Money, Power, Murder.&quot; He has written a novel for younger audiences called &quot;Travel Team.&quot; Lupica’s &quot;Bump and Run&quot; and &quot;Wild Pitch&quot; were best sellers. 2003 saw a sequel to &quot;Bump and Run,&quot; entitled &quot;Red Zone.&quot;In April 2006, his second children&#x27;s book, &quot;Heat,&quot; was published by Philomel. &quot;Heat&quot; is a fictional story based on the Danny Almonte scandal in the South Bronx Little League. In October 2006, Lupica&#x27;s third children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Miracle on 49th Street,&quot; was published. &quot;Summer Ball,&quot; a sequel to &quot;Travel Team,&quot; was released in 2007.

Lupica has also written several continuation novels for the characters created by the late crime author Robert B. Parker.

=== Television and radio work ===
Since 1988 Lupica has been one of the rotating pundits on &quot;The Sports Reporters&quot; on ESPN. He also briefly hosted an unsuccessful television chat program, &quot;The Mike Lupica Show,&quot; on ESPN2, as well as a short-lived radio show on WFAN in New York City in the mid-1990s. He has been a recurring guest on the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and &quot;The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour&quot;. Lupica has made frequent radio appearances on &quot;Imus in the Morning&quot; since the early 1980s. Lupica hosted a daily radio show on WEPN-FM from May 9, 2011, until August 21, 2015.

<text>The Warwickshire ring is a connected series of canals forming a circuit around the West Midlands area of England. The ring is formed from the Coventry Canal, the Oxford Canal, the Grand Union Canal, the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal and the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal. It is a popular route with tourists due to its circular route and mixture of urban and rural landscapes.

The ring totals 106 miles and has 115 locks, although there are two alternative routes through the southern part of Birmingham - from Kingswood Junction, one route follows the Grand Union Canal to Salford Junction, where it joins the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, and the other follows the Stratford Canal (north) and Worcester and Birmingham Canal to Gas Street Basin in central Birmingham. The latter route is slightly longer and has more locks, but many consider it to be more scenic and interesting.

==Route==
There is something of everything, in canal terms, around the Warwickshire Ring. There are wide beam and narrowbeam locks; there is idyllic open rolling countryside, and the grimness of industry, some of it removed, some of it improved, and some of it still there in all its awfulness. There are tourist honeypot sites, like Warwick Castle, and there are world class attractions like Drayton Manor Theme Park.

The ring is made up of parts of four canals.
*Grand Union Canal
*Birmingham and Fazeley Canal
*Coventry Canal
*Oxford Canal

===Grand Union Canal===
Starting at Braunston Turn, the route heads west along the Grand Union Main Line for five miles to Napton Junction, through pleasant farm land. The only village close to the canal is Lower Shuckburgh. This section was originally owned by the Oxford Canal. At Napton Junction, the Oxford Canal continues straight ahead, but the ring turns to the north, passing Napton Reservoirs on the left before descending through the first three locks at Calcutt. Prior to 1929, this section was owned by the Warwick and Napton Canal company, which amalgamated with several other companies to form the Grand Union Canal. One immediate benefit was a plan costing £881,000 to widen the locks. The original narrow locks, replaced by three wide beam ones in the 1930s, are still there alongside.

Turning westward, the canal heads towards Stockton locks. These eight locks carry the canal downhill to Long Itchington, and again the old narrow locks are still visible. After two more isolated locks, there are the Bascote four, with the top two forming a staircase. Six more locks take the canal on to the floor of the Leam (pronounced &quot;Lem&quot;) and Avon valleys. At Royal Leamington Spa, the ornamental Jephson Gardens commemorate Dr. Jephson, who lived from 1798 to 1878, who worked hard to establish the medical reputation of the spa, while tourist attractions at Warwick include the fourteenth century Warwick Castle, which is set in grounds laid out by the landscape architect Capability Brown.

The climb out of the Avon Valley begins at the two Cape Locks, where the Cape of Good Hope pub serves a locally brewed ale called Two Locks, on account of the brewery being two locks down from the pub. The route then turns right onto the line of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal, another of the constituent canals that made up the Grand Union Canal. To the left Saltisford Basin is run by a Canal Trust; it once led to the terminus of the Warwick and Birmingham Canal, prior to the construction of the Warwick and Napton Canal.

After climbing a few of the 21 Hatton Locks, the view opens up to show the enormous locks climbing the hill in an unbroken line westwards. Although heavy to operate, the locks fill and empty quickly. From Hatton top, there is a ten-mile respite from locks, punctuated by the Shrewley Tunnel, which passes under Shrewley village. The tunnel, which has a towpath and is wide enough to allow two boats to pass each other, emerges near to the village centre.

At Kingswood Junction, there is a choice of route. For those intending to go to Gas Street and Birmingham city centre, the narrowbeam Stratford-on-Avon Canal offers more locks and a longer passage, but for boaters going straight round the ring, the main line route is shorter and quicker. The five locks at Knowle raise the canal to its summit. They replaced six narrow locks in 1930, the remains of which can still be seen to one side of the channel, and are the last wide locks before Birmingham. After passing under the M42 motorway, an aqueduct carries the canal over the River Blythe, before it turns to the west near Solihull. The journey through Solihull is in a deep leafy cutting, shielding the boater from urban views. Trees then give way to disused wharves and housing estates.

The six Camp Hill locks are narrow beam and drop the canal down to Bordesley Junction, where the Warwickshire Ring turns to the right. Ahead is the route to Digbeth Basin: in the 1930s it was the Birmingham Hub of a national canal transport system. There are bonded warehouses, an ice house, a major Fellows Moreton &amp; Clayton warehouse, a banana warehouse and in Typhoo Basin, a tea warehouse.

From Bordesley Junction, Saltley Cut was reviled as the filthiest place on the whole canal system, with gas works, a power station, railway works and a chemical works all generating or receiving cargoes, and discharging waste into the canal. It has been cleaned up now, and there is new housing facing the waterfront. 

The five Garrison Locks lower the canal into the valley of the River Rea, which it crosses on an aqueduct. The Rea is a tributary of the River Tame, which it also crosses just before Salford Junction, where the Grand Union Canal meets the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal and the Tame Valley Canal. Nechells Shallow Lock once controlled the exit from the Grand Union Canal, but is no longer fitted with gates. The junction and the aqueduct are overshadowed by the road decks of spaghetti junction, which tower above them.

===Birmingham and Fazeley Canal===
At Salford Junction, boaters following the Warwickshire Ring turn to the right onto the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, which is sandwiched between the backs of factories and the M6 motorway. The route passes a major electricity high voltage distribution centre on the south bank, before reaching Erdington Hall, where a factory has been built over the canal, almost forming a tunnel, although one side remains open to the light. Close by was Fort Dunlop, where the Dunlop Rubber company made pneumatic tyres, employing 10,000 workers at the peak of production in the 1950s.
Eventually the canal re-emerges into the comparative calm of Minworth, where three locks lower the level of the canal. To the south is Minworth Sewage Treatment Works, one of the largest in Britain, capable of treating 220 million gallons (1000 Megalitres) per day. The canal continues through a cutting lined with trees, through the short Curdworth tunnel, which is long, to pass under the M6 Toll motorway. The first of the eleven Curdworth locks is immediately after the bridge, and the canal continues through open countryside and flooded gravel pits, although the M42 motorway is never far away to the east.

Some of the gravel pits have been landscaped to form Kingsbury Water Park, which covers and contains 30 lakes and pools, providing activities including walking, nature trails, sailing, windsurfing, power boating and horse riding. There is also a children&#x27;s farm at Broomey Croft. At Fazeley, the canal runs alongside Drayton Manor Theme Park, and crosses Bourne Brook, another tributary of the River Tame, to arrive at Fazeley Junction and the Coventry Canal.

===Coventry Canal===
The section of the Coventry Canal which turns to the left was actually built by the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal, because the Coventry Canal ran out of money. However, the Warwickshire Ring turns to the right, along the section built before the shortage of capital occurred. Near the junction is Fazeley Mill, which began making tape in 1886, and has continued to use the same processes ever since. There is also a mill which was built to Richard Arkwright&#x27;s pattern in 1791, and is one of the best surviving mills of its type.

A large aqueduct carries the canal over the River Tame, after which it is bordered by the houses and factories of Tamworth. Between the 1930s and 2001, the Reliant Car Company was based in Tamworth, and manufactured Reliant Robin cars beside the canal. Tamworth also has a castle, which exhibits a wide mix of architectural styles. The motte is Norman, the timbered hall is Elizabethan and the apartments are Jacobean.

Two locks raise the level of the canal in Tamworth, after which there is a long level section. Once beyond the housing estates of Tamworth, the canal passes the remains of Alvecote Priory and turns to the south-east. After being crossed by the M42 motorway, it joins the valley of the River Anker, which it follows on a ledge on the west side of the valley. It passes through the centre of Polesworth, and is then surrounded by farmland, before it begins to ascend out of the valley to Atherstone, through a flight of eleven narrow locks. Atherstone was a hatting town, where hats were made from Tudor times, including many for the armies of the world. Towards the end of the twentieth century, hats went out of fashion, and the economy of the town declined. Mercury was used to make certain types of felt, and its toxicity, which affects the brain, led to the expression &quot;Mad as a Hatter&quot;.

Between Atherstone and Nuneaton, the canal water is rust coloured, caused by leaching of minerals from the soil, and there are the remains of large granite quarries, many now landscaped and acting as nature reserves. A prominent feature is Mount Judd, a mountain created from waste material from Judkins Quarry.

To the south of Nuneaton is Marston Junction, where the Ashby Canal joins, and beyond that, the canal skirts the eastern edge of Bedworth in a long cutting. Shortly afterwards, the canal reaches Hawkesbury Junction, where the Coventry Canal continues for another into the centre of Coventry, and the Oxford Canal turns off to the south-east. Originally, the junction was a little further to the south at Longford.

At Hawkesbury Junction there is an old engine house, a graceful curved bridge and the Greyhound pub. Although not part of the Warwickshire Ring, the route into Coventry is a flagship of urban regeneration. The towpath has been cleaned up, resurfaced, lit, policed, and adorned with sculptures and other works of art, and is now a thoroughly pleasant place to walk or cruise. The journey is like a catalogue for a historic vehicle rally, for manufactured here were Daimlers, Rileys, Hillmans and Humbers.

Access to Coventry Basin is through a tiny bridge hole, which was designed so that it could be sealed off each evening by a large wooden beam. The basin has been beautifully and sympathetically restored, with new retail units blending seamlessly with buildings from another era. The focal point is a more than life sized statue of James Brindley standing in the centre.

===Oxford Canal===

From Hawkesbury Junction, the Oxford Canal twists and turns while generally heading south east, as its engineer James Brindley built a contour canal which closely followed the contours of the land. In the 1820s, it was straightened and shortened by creating cuttings and embankments to make it a better competitor to the railways, and the distance to Braunston was almost reduced from to . Where the original meanderings remain, the towpath is carried over the junction on elegantly engineered cast iron bridges, carrying the inscription &quot;Horseley Ironworks 1828&quot;.

Much of the route is rural, although the M69 motorway and the M6 motorway both cross the canal. Brinklow was once served by an arm of the canal, which is now disused, and an aqueduct on the main line near its start has been turned into an embankment by filling in the arches. At Newbold-on-Avon there is a tunnel, beyond which the scenery is much more urban, although the canal passes to the north-east of Rugby on an embankment, and is separated from it by a railway line.

There is quite a community of boaters and businesses at Hillmorton Locks, which were duplicated in the 1830s to alleviate congestion. The high Hillmorton Wireless Aerials, built in 1924, are a significant landmark for miles around. Beyond Hillmorton, the canal turns under the railway, and then passes under the M45 motorway, to head for Braunston. The very distinctive spire of Braunston Church is another landmark on the final part of the journey back to the start of the Warwickshire Ring.
